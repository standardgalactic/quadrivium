Your trusty Editor has
again tapped away at
the typew riter t o
introduce this second
fantastic issue of Your
Commodore.
YOU K N O W  I T  ON LY
seems a couple of months
ago that we were sunning
ourselves o n  t h e  beach
dreaming up the idea of a
great magazine to cater for
the needs o f  the  Com-
modore user. And yet here
we are in October looking
forward to cosy roaring ﬁres
and sitting in front of our
micros w i t h  t h e  w i n d
howling around outside the
window! But there are all
sorts o f  goodies o n  the
Commodore scene to look
forward t o  i n  t he  next
couple of months.
What the future holds
At this very time Com-
modore are launching their
new computers, the Plus 4
and t he  16, Currah are
announcing their speech
synthesiser, Cheetah will be
producing t h e  C o m -
modore version o f  their
infra-red joystick (the RAT!)
and the software companies
will be starting their build-
up t o Christmas with the
launch o f  undoubtedly
numerous ga m e s  a n d
utilities for the Commodore
range of machines.
The editorial team on
your Commodore has been
under intensive training to
enable their ﬁnely tuned
(?!) bodies and minds to
keep up to date with all the
latest happenings on the
Commodore front, so all
you need to do to ensure
that you are kept informed
is to make sure that you get
your c opie s  o f  Y o u r
Commodore regularly.
There is an easy way to do
this —  just look for  the
Subscriptions page in this
magazine, ﬁl l  i n  th e
coupon, write your cheque
and sit back and wait for
your c opie s  t o  c om e
popping thr ough y our
letterbbx. I t  sure beats
ﬁghting your way to the
shelves i n  y o u r  loc a l
newsagents!
Keeping in the present
Your views
This issue of  Your Com-
m odor e  w e  b e l i e v e
maintains the high stand-
ards set in the ﬁrst issue: we
have a review of the MIDI
by Chris Palmer, who apart
from being a bit of a whizz
on computers is something
of a  talented musician;
Runecaster h a s  b e e n
brought up from the Crypt
to tell us of Adventures and
other things; we have pages
packed w i t h  ne ws  a nd
software reviews; and we
have carried on our great
series on machine code and
BASIC. And, as if that isn't
enough, we also have some
fun games for you to type in
and hints on how to become written in condemnation of
a 'sneaky programmerl s o f t w a r e  piracy b u t  f e w
It is always difﬁcult when
starting up a new magazine
to gauge the response of the
most important pe ople
involved —  y o u ,  t h e
readers. So here is your
chance to get in on the act!
By now we hope that you
will have read the ﬁrst issue
of Your Commodore. The
ﬁrst question to be asked is:
did y ou enjoy what you
read? T h e n ,  w a s  i t
useful/informative/fun?
Did it tell you all you wanted
to know?
We consider ourselves
fairly approachable here in
the depths o f  the  Your
Commodore ofﬁces so why
don't you use the lines of
communication that we are
trying to open up? Tell us
what you would like to see
in the future — would you
like more games to type in,
more programming f e a -
tures, less reviews, etc, etc.
Those good or  lines of
communication can also be
used for getting into contact
with ot he r  Commodre
users; do you want to join a
local Commodore users'
group? A r e  y ou having
trouble ﬁnding your way
out o f  a  pa r tic ula r ly

All you have to do is
write to the Editor at the
London ofﬁce and we'll do
our best to help — either
directly or by printing your
letter within these hallowed
pages.
ASP ﬁghts software
piracy
Much has been said and
have taken a positive stand
against it. ASP is among
those few that have taken
action t o  he lp curb the
grave problem o f  home
copying o f  commercial
software.
ASP has already taken
steps t o  eliminate adver-
tisements in our magazines
which r e la t e  t o  t a pe
duplication f o r  piracy
purposes. W h i l e  i t  i s
appreciated that individuals
may take 'back-up' copies
of their own programs, it
should be noted that it is
ILLEGAL t o  c opy  c om -
mercially available software
for other than personal use.
Software pir a c y  i s
costing t h e  s oftwa r e
industry huge  sums o f
money which is detrimental
to the future development
of the  industry. I t  is i n
everybody's interests t o
dramatically reduce t h e
level o f  software piracy
primarily because ﬁr m s
need funds raised from
software sales t o  plough
back intro research a nd
development o f  n e w
products. This means that
the standard o f  software
products can only improve.
ASP hopes our action
will help combat this serious
problem i n  o r d e r  t o
maintain and improve the
high standards of the UK
software industry. We  are
asking you to do the same
by refraining from dupli-
cating or copying commer-
cially available software for
anything o t h e r  t h a n
personal use.

their layman's guide
to machine code in
part 2 of this series.
TO W R I T E  M A C H I N E

important t o  k n o w  t h e
space in memory which is
free from the clutches of the
operating system, the BASIC
i n te r p r e te r  a n d  t h e
peripheral control area. This
free space varies in different
models. I n  th e  C BM 64,
there i s ,  fortunately, a
healthy 4 K  o f  me mo ry

own machine code p ro -

loaded into the 4K memory
block starting from $C000
onwards. The character g$'
will be used from now on to
indicate where the number
is i n  h e x  ra th e r th a n
decimal).
In addition to the space
required t o  h o u se  t h e
program, a need will arise
for a few special memory
locations i n  'page ze ro '
which is at the bottom of
memory and extends from
address $0000 to  SONE In
Part 1  o f  this series, w e
learned th a t t h e  mi cro -
processor communicates
with the memory chips via a
set o f 16 wires called the
address bus and a  set o f
eight wires called the data
bus. The memory may be
considered as a huge block
of separately addressable
locations. Each location can
hold eight bits and each
location h a s  a  u n i q u e
'address' f o r  i d e n t i t y
purposes.
The b i n a r y  p a tte r n ,

sends o u t o n  the address
bus a t  a n y  o n e  ti m e ,
energises o n e  particular
memory l o ca ti o n . Th i s
pattern i s  t h e  address.
However, it is easier to think
of the address in terms of
hex rather th a n  binary.
Furthermore, it is convent-
ional to consider the pattern
on the 16-bit address bus in
two halves. The eight most
signiﬁcant bits (A0 to A15)

are known as the page and
the eight least signiﬁcant
bits (AO to A7) as the address
on t h e  page. I t  i s  also
conventional to refer to the
most signiﬁcant half of the
address bus as the high byte
address a n d  th e -  least
signiﬁcant half as the low
byte address. Refer to ﬁgure
21 w h i ch  illustrates t h e
concept o f a page and an
address on that page.
The example shows a
sample binary pattern, 0000
0011 1111 0100 which, when
tra n sl a te d  i n t o  h e x ,
becomes $03F4 (if you still
cling on to decimal, this is
1012). Note that only four
hex digits are required to
express a n y  o f  th e  64K
possible address combina-
tions. Returning t o  t h e
subject of pages and Figure
2.1, instead o f  saying the
absolute address is $03F4,
we could say the address is
$F4 on page $03. We could
drop th e  leading zero and
simply say page 3. Before
leaving the subject of pages,
it is worth studying some of
the ﬁgures involved i n
address work.
One page contains 256
addresses. In hex, the range
extends from $00 to  $FF.
There are 256 pages in the
complete memory map, so
again, the hex range is from
$00 to $FF. Check: 256 x 256
= 65,536 = 64K
If w e  have t o  w ri te
machine code without the
aid of an assembler, we are
forced t o  u s e  decimal
addresses because the CBM
64 does not cater for hex.
Although b r u t e  f o r c e
conversion f r o m  h e x  t o
decimal is quite in order,
you a re  strongly recom-
mended to keep in mind the
division of the address bus
into t w o  sections. W e
should remember th a t a
complete memory address
occupies two bytes, the high
byte for page and the low
byte f o r  address o n  th e
page. The high byte is worth
256 times as much as the
equivalent low byte.
To choose a  simple
example, i f the address is
$0305 (address 5 on page 3),
the decimal equivalent is 5 +
(256x3) = 773.
Let's t r y  t h e  m o r e
difﬁcult address, $250F, in
order to practise some hex
to decimal conversion. The
low byte is $OF which i n
decimal is 15 and the high
byte i s  $25 which i s  37
decimal. So the complete
address in decimal is 15 +
(256 x  37) =  9487. I f  you
intend to follow this series
without o b ta i n i n g  a n
assembler, i t  w i l l  b ri n g
dividends i f  you spend a
little time practising these
methods of converting hex
addresses to decimal.
The 6 5 1 0  m i c r o -
processor
When y o u  program i n
BASIC, the microprocessor,
the w o rkh o rse  o f  t h e
computer, remains unseen
in the background. There is
no need to know what type
it is, how many bits it can
handle at once, how many
registers there are inside it
or what is the repertoire ol
instructions. The situation
is different for the machine
code p ro g ra mme r. Th e
peculiarities of the resident
microprocessor a r e  a l l
important.
The mi cro p ro ce sso r
used in the Commodore 64
is a  6510A. Readers who
have been used to the well
known 6502 microprocessor
will be relieved to know that
the t w o  a r e  so ftw a re
compatible. T h e  o n l y
difference is that the 6510A
has a few special output pins
which the machine uses to
co n tro l  t h e  c a s s e tte
interface. I t  is possible to

P r o g r a m m i n g
plunge s t r a i g h t  i n t o
machine c o d e  program-
ming without troubling too
much about the technical
details o f  t h e  6510A.
However, it pays dividends
in the long run if some of
the internal behaviour i s
understood and it can also
be interesting for its own
sake.
Programs w ri tte n  i n
machine code for any given
microprocessor should,
subject to minor variations,
still run on any make o f
computer employing t h e
same microprocessor. That
is t o  say, machine code
programs a r e  micropro-
cessor ( r a t h e r  t h a n
machine) speciﬁc. T h e
'minor variations' mentio-
ned above include such
things as differences in the
way memory i s allocated
and t h e  a m o u n t  a n d
location o f  f r e e  space.
Machine code programs are
usually written with the aid
of an assembler and some
variation in syntax can be
expected between different
commercial versions.
It is better to begin by
reviewing t h e  m i c r o -
processor i n  relation t o
other main components of
the system. T h e  mi cro -
processor communicates
with t h e  r e s t  o f  t h e
computer via three bundles
of wires known as 'buses'.
As w e  have seen, t h e
address bus is responsible
for p i c k i n g  o u t  t h e
particular memory location
required by the program-
mer. T h e  d a ta  b u s  i s
responsible for sending or
receiving data to and from
the chosen location. The
control bus is a hotch potch
of wires, necessary for the
overall discipline o f  th e
system
The ROM chips
These c o n t a i n  ﬁx e d
information and can not be
subsequently altered by the
computer. The information
stored includes t h e  8 K
operating system o f  th e
computer (Commodore call
this the 'kernal' ROM). The
BASIC language interpreter
is also an 8K ROM. The most
important characteristic o f
ROMS is the permanence
of the stored information
which i s  retained a fte r
power is disconnected.
The RAM chips (Ran-
dom Access Memory)

ROMs, i s  th e  ability t o

they are 'random' access is
incidental because so also
are ROMs. In other words,
RAMS are really read/write
memories. Depending o n

MOS transistors. I he stored
information, however, is a
transient affair because it is
only a minute electrostatic
charge which leaks away in a
few milliseconds. Consequ-
ently, each stored bit must
be periodically re-charged
in order to compensate for
the leakage. This process,
called 'refreshing', is inher-
ent in the hardware design
and is not the responsibility
of the programmer. How-
ever, t h e  refresh-cycle
does take u p  extra time.

Inside the 6510A
From the viewpoint of the
programmer, the 6510A can
be c o n s i d e r e d  a s  a
collection of registers. Each

or two exceptions, all data
must b e  fe tch e d  f r o m
memory via the data bus
and routed to one or othe
of t h e  registers b e fo r
carrying out any operation.
A machine code program
will consist o f a series of
instructions which inform
the microprocessor which
registers are to be used to

carry out the current task.
Registers d o  n o t have
addresses, at least not in the
same w a y  a s  described
above. I f  an assembler is
used, they are called up by
special code letters, such as
A or X or Y etc which form
part o f  each instruction
Paths, within t h e  micro-
processor, connecting the
various registers together or
to the external buses are
sometimes called 'h i g h -
ways' because they ramify
over the chip area like main
trunk roads.
The registers
With one exception, all the
registers in the 6510A are
eight bits wide, the same as

Some commonly used
abbreviations
Before we even attempt to
w ri te  m a c h i n e  c o d e
programs or before even we
can attempt t h e  precise
deﬁnition o f  a  machine
code instruction, we must
understand the operation of
the microprocessor r e g -
isters. Certain bits in these
registers h a v e  sp e ci a l
signiﬁcance according t o
the position they occupy.
The following abbreviations
and conventions are, more
or less, standardised and will
be used from now on:
lsb=least signiﬁcant bit.
msb=most signiﬁcant bit.
Bit positions within a byte
are numbered 7 6 5 4 3 2 1 O.
Bit 0 is the kb.
Bit 7 is the msb.
A=the accumulator.
X=register X.
Y=register Y.
P=process status register.
PC=program counter.
PCL=low byte of PC.
PCH=high byte of PC.
SP=stack pointer.
ALU=arithmetic and logic
unit.
AR=address register.
ARL=low byte of AR.
ARH=high byte of AR.
Process status ﬂags:
N=negative (bit 7).
V=overﬂd'w (bit 6).
B=break (bit 4).
D=BCD (bit 3).
1=interrupt (bit 2)
Z=zero (bit 1).
C=carry (bit 0).
Figure 2 . 2  s h o w s  t h e
programmable registers and
the disposition o f  t h e
various bits.
A distinction i s  made
between directly program-
mable a n d  certain other
registers which, although
playing a vital role, remain
in the background, unseen
by t h e  p r o g r a m m e r .
Instructions e x i s t w h i c h
allow th e  programmer t o
transfer d a te  b e tw e e n
memory and registers.
Accumulator (A)
this register has a supreme
role. I t  i s  th e  only o n e
capable o f  p e rfo rmi n g
arithmetic processing. It is
involved in transfers to and
from memory and acts as
interim data storage during
a ri th me ti c a n d  l o g i c
operations. F o r  example,
during a simple addition of
two numbers using t h e
instruction ADC (ADd with
Carry), t h e  ﬁrst number
must pass to  the accumu-
lator and is then transferred
to a  temporary holding
register within the ALU. The
second number then enters
A, the addition is carried out
and the result sent back to
A. The ALL) in the 6510A, in
common w i th  nearly a l l
other microprocessors,
requires the two variables
ﬁrst, th e  add operator is
then activated and the result
passed to the accumulator,
replacing t h e  p re vi o u s
contents.
The dominance o f the
accumulator o v e r  o th e r
registers w i l l  b e  evident
when w e  later study the
complete instruction set of
the 6510A. However, th e
fact that only one accumu-
lator i s  p r e s e n t g i v e s
a m m u n i ti o n  f o r  t h e
protagonists of the rival Z80
microprocessor w h i c h
boasts eight accumulator
type registers. A  single
accumulator does tend to
be restrictive in organising
efﬁcient machine code.
The X and Y registers
Like the accumulator, the X
register and the Y register
(subsequently referred to as
X and Y) are both eight bits
wide. Th e y  h a v e  th r e e
primary uses i n  program-
ming:
•They ma ke  u p  f o r  th e
inconvenience o f  t h e
solitary a c c u m u l a to r .
Important data residing in A
can be transferred tempor-
arily by the use of TAX or
TAY and later when A  is
free, transferred back using
TXA or TYA.
•They ca n  serve a s u p -
counters or down-counters
for setting up machine code
loops. This is due to the ease
by w h i ch  th e y  c a n  b e
incremented or decrement-
ed by the instructions INX,
DEX, IN Y  o r  DEY. I t  i s
curious that the designers
failed t o  p r o v i d e  a n
equivalent instruction fo r
incrementing o r  decrem-
enting A. The only way is by
the relatively inefﬁcient
method o f  a d d i n g  o r
=
subtracting 1, using ADC or
SBC.
•They are fundamental to
the technique known a s
address modiﬁcation b y
indexing. When using an
indexed addressing mode
(denoted in assembly form
by a comma followed by X
or Y), the data in the X or Y
register i s  automatically
added to the given address.
The resultant is interpreted
as the ﬁnal address o f the
required data.
This idea was pioneered
by a  team a t Manchester
University and, at the time,
represented a step forward
in computer science. They
called the index register, the
'B b o x ' ,  presumably t o
differentiate i t  fr o m  t h e
accumulator A. Prior to this,
altering the address in loops
was c u m b e r s o m e .  I t
involved l o a d i n g  t h e
address p a r t  o f  a n
instruction from inside the
program. incrementing i t
and then storing it back in
the original position. I n
o th e r w o r d s ,  i t  w a s
necessary t o  a l te r  t h e
program in order to modify
the a d d re ss. I n d e x e d
addressing i s  s o  m u c h
cleaner to  work with and
certainly less error prone.
Most o f  t h e  indexable
instructions i n  th e  6510A
allow a  choice o f  using
either X  o r  Y  indexing.
Although indexed addres-
sing is dealt with in some
detail later, anticipation will
do no harm, so study the
following example:
Assume X contains 30 and
we write WA  100,X
The simple instruction LDA
130 w o u l d  h a v e  t h e
equivalent e ffe ct. Th e y
would b o t h  l o a d  t h e
contents of address 130 into
A. The advantage o f  the
indexed over th e  simpler
form will be apparent when
organising loops involving
action o n  co n se cu ti ve
addresses.
This should h e l p  t o
explain w h y  th e  address
bus, as well as the data bus,
has access to  the ALU. It
should be understandable,
if we realise that the index
register contents have to be
added to the operand. After
all, the address modiﬁcation
I

by indexing produces a
computed address and only
the ALU can truly compute.
The process status
register (P)
If we deﬁne a register as an
internal memory location
for holding o r processing
data, then the Process Status
register (P) is not a register at
all. It is in fact a collection of
isolated single-bit storage
cells (ﬂip-ﬂops). Each bit is
called a  'ﬂag' because i t
conveys certain information
in yes/no form either for the
beneﬁt of the machine or
the programmer. The ﬂags
play an important role in the
'branch/if type of instruc-
tions, the machine code is
equivalent to the IF/THEN
statement in BASIC. After
most i n stru cti o n s, t h e
relevant ﬂags are updated,
depending o n  th e  result
they give. It is important for
the programmer to under-
stand the exact signiﬁcance
of each ﬂag, that is to say,
under what conditions they
are set or reset. It is also
important to  know which
are under sole control of the
microprocessor and which
are directly programmable.
The N Bit
If this is 1, the last result
contained a  1  i n  b i t  7
position. The N bit is often
misleadingly called the 'sign
bit' because two's comple-
ment arithmetic recognises
bit 7 as the sign rather than
magnitude. If the number is
unsigned binary, the N ﬂag
merely indicates the state of
bit 7, It is automatically set
or reset and is not directly
programmable.
The V bit
If this bit is 1, it indicates that
the last instruction resulted
in t w o ' s  co mp l e me n t
overﬂow, that is to say, the
resultant number was too
large to ﬁt into a single byte.
The programmer will always
have the choice of working
in unsigned binary o r  in
two's complement form. If
unsigned binary is used, the
status of the V bit has no
importance. The V bit is also
used to indicate the status of

bit 6 o f a data byte when
using a  special instruction
known as the BIT test. It is
possible to clear the V bit to
zero by the CLV instruction
although t h e r e  i s  n o
corresponding instruction
to set it to 1.
The B bit
This i s set t o  1  when a
BRK (break) instruction is
encountered, It cannot be
directly programmed.
The D bit
The 6510A normally uses
straightforward b i n a r y
arithmetic but it is capable
of performing arithmetic on
the assumption that all data
is to be interpreted as BCD
(Binary Coded Decimal). To
force the use of BCD, the
programmer must set the D
bit to 1D by the instruction
sED (SEt Decimal). This state
remains until the instruction
CLD (Clear Decimal) is used.
BCD is not used very often
so we will leave the details
until a  later part o f  this
series.
The I bit
This is called the interrupt
mask or the inhibit enable.
If this bit is set to 1 by use of
SEI (SEt In te rru p t), a l l
interrupt re q u e sts a r e
refused until it is set to zero
by CLI (Clear Interrupt).
However, th e r e  i s  o n e
special ki n d  o f  interrupt
instruction, N M I  ( N o n
Maskable Interrupt), which
cannot b e  inhibited. The
subject o f  i n te rru p t i s
involved so it would be out
of place to deal with at this
stage.
The C bit
This is the Carry bit and is set
to 1 when a carry out from
the msb is detect& Instead
of the bit being pushed out
at the far end and lost, it is
'caught' and placed in the
bit At times, the program
mer will consider it as th
'ninth bit'. It can provide a
kind o f  bit-continuity
between o n e  by t e and
another. This is the essential
idea behind mutiprecision

work where two o r more
bytes are used, connected
end to  end, to  hold one
number.
The Z bit
This bit is automatically set
to 1 i f the last instruction
gave a zero result. It is easy
to interpret this back t o
front s o  i t  i s  w o r t h
emphasising. I f  result=0, Z
becomes 1. If result is non
zero, Z becomes O. It is used
by the branch instructions
BNE (Branch i f Non Zero)
and BEC? (Branch if Equal to
Zero).
The stack pointer (SP)
This is an eight-bit register
dedicated to the automatic
control of a special area in
page one of RAM deﬁned as
The Stack'. It is difﬁcult to
describe the action o f the
stack p o i n t e r  w i t h o u t
describing the stack so we
must b e  content a t th e
moment with the following
brief description:
(1) The contents o f SP is
interpreted b y the micro-
processor as the address of
the c ur r e nt ly  v a c a nt
location on the stack.
(2
a dress is always on page
one, rather than page zero,
a permanent 1 is hardwired
at the msb end of SP to act as
a ninth bit. If for example, SP
contains 0000 0111, which is
S07, t h e  a d d r e s s  i s
interpreted as 1 0000 0111
which is $107. That is to say,
the address is $07 on page

In part two of his
series on BASIC games
programming for VIC
20 users, B.M. Phillips
gets things under
control with PEEKs,
POKEs and moving I
about. •  
•
THIS IS THE SECOND OF A
ﬁve part series of BASIC
games programming for the
VIC 20. The series is primar-
ily intended for newcomers
to games programming, but
there might well be a tew
useful tips for seasoned pro-
grammers.
As y o u  w i l l  h a v e
discovered last month there
can be a lot of satisfaction in
creating a  unique screen
design, but it's static, non-
interactive, and you could
have used paper and pen to
achieve the  same result!
What you are really doing
when you design a screen
display is to create an arena,
whether it's for  a  space
battle, gunﬁght scenario, or
mowing a lawn. Let's have a
look at getting it all moving.
If you enter Listing 1 and
run it you will have a screen,

surrounded by a boundary,
containing a  star i n  the
middle. There are two ways
of making the star move.
Either interactively o r
under program control.
Most games programs
contain bot h elements.

press the keys or move the
joystick and the star moves.
The screen c a n  b e
regarded as a 22 x 23 matrix
with the bottom left hand
corner being designated
0,0. Characters (CH) and
colours (CL) can be POKEd
onto the screen using:
POKE P1-1-X-22*Y,CH
POKE P.24X-22sY,CL
where P1=8164
P2=38884
and all you have to do to put
the character anywhere on
the screen is to specify X and
Y. You also have to rub out
it's previous location, which
you do simply by POKEing a
space.
So far so good. All that
remairrs i s  t o  g e t  t h e
information from you into
the computer. There are lots
of ways of doing this —from
the keyboard, paddles,
joystick, lightpen, micro-
phone (if you have the
appropriate add-on) e tc .
The most wide ly  us e d
methods are the KEYS and
JOYSTICK, and I'll start off
by describing the two most
common methods of Key
Input.
The ﬁrst means of input
is GET A$. You can see how
this works if you add lines
330-500 (Listing 2) to the ﬁrst
program. The sequence of
events i s  quite  straight-
forward( but there's a
problem. When you press
"I" the star moves up the
screen. OK that's what we
want. Carry on pressing it
Lost it! Where's it gone?
Now you're in dangerous
waters. Y o u r  POKEing
around i n  memory loca-
tions is  best le ft alone.

computer! Tha t was a n
example o f  b a d  p r o -
gramming. For it to work it
relied on you stopping at
the screen boundary. One
of the ﬁrst rules in Games
programming is not to rely
on the player —they always
let you down. Instead, you
make it fool proof.
There are two easy ways
of doing this. The ﬁrst is to
look at the value of X and Y
and if they are outside of
your required range, either
deﬁne the  offending co-
ordinate to the other end of
the screen (wrap around)
i.e. 10 IF X > 21 THEN X=0
20 IF X < 0 THEN X=21
or stop it moving
i.e. 10 IF X < 0 OR IF
X > 21 THEN X=X1
If you modify lines 420-450
as shown in Listing 3, the star
will stay on the screen. You
are now in control of the
action. Why not have a goat
modifying i t  t o  give the
wrap around affect.
The other way round the
problem is to get the star to
"look" where it's going, by
PEEKing the location before
moving, and if it's OK carry
on, and if not stop dead.
rhis technique is shown by
adding lines 400-520 (listing
4) to the ﬁrst program which
will prevent the star moving
unless there's a blank space
available. This is the better
method in general, as it is
more ﬂexible, and that PEEK
can do far more than keep it

use i t  t o  init ia t e  a n
explosion, eat a monster, or
squash a  frog. PEEKS are
pretty useful.
You might have noticed
in running these programs
that a  subtle change has
come over the keyboard. All
the keys now auto-repeat.

This has the same effect in

try this method out, you'll

Getting to grips
with the joystick
Now you know how to get
input fro m th e  keys, the
joystick w i l l  present n o
problem. T h e  j o ysti ck
contains 5 switches, four for
movement and one for ﬁre
All you have to do is ﬁnd out
which one is closed, and
then continue as fo r the
keys. There are a number of
ways of doing this and one
of t h e  easiest i s  t h a t
described i n  t h e  "P r o -
grammer's R e fe r e n c e
Guide". I've adapted this for
use in our program below
(Listing 6 .  L i n e s 30-50
initialise the joystick, and
the subroutine (lines 1000-
1020) reads the values, and
updates X  and Y  accor-
dingly).
It's easy to  get charac-
ters moving around t h e
screen u n d e r  p ro g ra m
control. Again you use the
X,Y co-ordinate idea and
update X and Y each time
you go round the program
loop. A good way of doing
this is to use:
- X=X+DX
Y=Y+DY
The type of movement you
get depends on the values
of DX and DY. These can be
continuously re-calculated
as the program progresses
to give, f o r  example, a
projectile (Newton's Laws of
Motion), or made to change
if the object hits something.

Before we get on with
the Game — yes there's a
game in here somewhere —
it's worth thinking about
using the PRINT statement
to move things about. It's a
shame that the ' I C  hasn't
got a PRINT AT command, it
would m a k e  l i fe  easier.
However, y o u  c a n  u s e
PRINT t o  m o v e  things.
Type i n  and RUN listing
8. A rocket descends. Now,
that rocket i s  made u p
of 1 6  characters. H a v e
a g o  a t  writing a  p ro -
gram which POKEs those
characters o n  a n d  o f f
the screen. It won't be as
good — there are too many
characters. You could use
this idea for the ﬁnal stages
of a Lunar Lander program.
Start o ff with th e  rocket
descending a s  a  single
character, and when it gets
near to the ground switch to
a magniﬁed version of the
rocket co n tro l l i n g  t h e
display with PRINT.
Eat your heart out
Now for the game. In  the
last article I suggested that
you could use a  random
maze as the basis of a game.
The program in Listing 9 is
an example. You move a
snake around a  random,
shifting maze, eating hearts.
One point per heart, and if 5
hearts are on the screen at
any o n e  ti me  th e  game
ends. I've written the game
for key (1,1,K, and L) input,
but if you don't like these
keys change them. Better
still, if you ve got a joystick,
incorporate th a t i n  t h e
program.
Up to now we've moved
a single character around
the screen, but here we're
moving six. Actually we only
appear to be moving six. All
you have to do to move a
snake is to move the head
(HD), ﬁll in the space left
with a  body section (BD),
and blank out the tail. This
will g i v e  y o u  s m o o th
movement, and works well
even with quite long snakes.
You have to re-deﬁne the
position o f  e a ch  b o d y
section each time you go
round the loop, and this is
done in lines 5 3 0
snake "looks" where i t is
going, and if it meets itself,
the maze, or the boundary,
it stops (line 470), and i f it
meets a heart it eats it and
the score (SC) goes up by 1.
The n u m b e r  o f  hearts
generated is totalled (TL),
and the number of heartson
the screen at any time is
given by IL-SC (line 810).
As it stands the game is
playable, b u t i n  need o f
improvement. Presentation
is important, and it is untidy.
There shoul d  b e  so me
instructions, a  r e p l a y
facility, a high score record,
and a much neater screen
display particularly regard-
ing the scoring. But then it's
not ﬁnished — have a go
and see what you can do
with it. While you're at it

quite large enough —  o r

to k e e p  t h e  a r d e n t

even mo n th s! Al th o u g h
adventure g a m e s  m a y
come under many guises,
the prime area still seems to
come loosely u n d e r th e
banner o f  'swords a n d
sorcery', a generic title that
has seen such a boom over
the last decade in the world
of t h e  written w o r d  —
p ri n ci p a l l y i n  t h e i r
paperback versions. Th i s
type o f fantasy adventure,
although not to everyone's
taste, is very popular and

providing us with plenty of
varying p l o t s  f o r  t h e

Some people are unable
to relate t o  this form o f

fantastic for them to grasp
hold o f  i ts  fundamental
nature. No matter how well

Commodore's sale success,
most should appear in the

Deﬁning an
'Adventure Game'
The term 'adventure games'
covers a multitude of sins.
The purist would probably
say that they should be a
cross between a crossword
puzzle, a treasure hunt and
a ma ze , t h e  'crossword
puzzle' providing i n te r -
linked clues that enable the
player b o th  t o  ﬁn d  th e
treasure and, also, assist in
mapping the maze. Paper
and pencil are necessities to
the serious games player
since, i n  a l mo st e v e r y
adventure game, it is vital to
be able to  ﬁnd your way
around w i t h o u t  e i th e r
wasting moves (your lamp
may go Out too soon!) or
being i n  danger o f ,  fo r
example, walking into a trap
or b e i n g  tr a n s p o r te d
involuntarily to somewhere
else! Mapping an adventure
may b e  done i n  several
different ways a n d  i n  a
future 'tale' we will look at
this m o r e  closely; b u t ,
whatever yo u  d o , tr y  t o
ensure t h a t  y o u  k n o w
where you are and how to
get back to where you were!
Early days
A looser interpretation of an
adventure game is where
you take o n  th e  role o f
adventurer and merely (?)
have the freedom of choice
in which way to move and
subsequently ﬁnd 'adven-
ture'! Two early examples of
this form would be 'Halls of
Death' (Supersoft) and 'The
Valley' (APS) —  both o f
which are available for the
Commodore 6 4  a n d  th e
latter for the expanded VIC-
20. I n  e a c h  o f  th e se
programs you move around
a mapped area shown on
the screen; as you move you
may encounter some form
of unpleasant monster or an
artifact th a t will increase
your ﬁghting abilities either
magically or physically, Both
have excellent real-time
ﬁghting routines that make
the palms sweat and the
heart beat faster, The CBM
64 version of 'Halls of Death'
has a  graphics represent-
ation o f individual battles
and 'The Valley' gives you
the option of choosing one

Literary adventure
As we pointed out in our last
'tale', t h e  p u r e  t e x t
adventure offers the most
scope fo r  y o u  a n d  t h e
computer programmer's
imagination. O n  screen
graphics take up quite a bit
of your computer's valuable
memory space  (u n l e ss
continually accessed from
disc a s  w i l l  b e  m a n y
offerings in the future) and
the graphics have t o  b e
good to make up for this
limitation. Fortunately,
every now and then there is
a program that proves us
wrong. The ﬁrst to take up
this challenge successfully
was probably 'The Hobbit'
(Me l b o u rn e  H o u s e ) ,
originally available for the
Sinclair Sp e ctru m a n d
subsequently converted to
other machines, one being
the Commodore 64. 'The
Hobbit' broke new ground
on several counts and must
rate very highly i n  a n y
'adventure stakes'. ' T h e
Hobbit' has a scenario based
upon the classic book of the
same name by IAA. Tolkein
and a  copy o f the book
(published b y  Unwins)
comes with the computer
program. Reading the book
is beneﬁcial, not only to get
better acquainted with what
the adventure is all about
but also because it contains
many hints on how you may
play the game.
Over 5 0  scenes fro m
'The Hobbit' are represent-
ed graphically, obviously a
great deal of care has gone
into their production and
ﬁnding n e w  scenes i s i n
itself a  p l e a su re . T h e
program has been written
with the player in mind and
several points have to  be
commended highly. T h e
ﬁrst concerns the graphics
themselves: because these
are o n  occasion q u i t e
complex, they may take a
few seconds to draw. This is
ﬁne the ﬁrst time you see
them b u t  could become
boring and time-consuming
if they were drawn on every
entry to a particular scene.
In 'The Hobbit' you will be
N
1
LOKI
shown a  picture i n  all its
glory on your ﬁrst visit to
that location, thereafter you
only get the text description
unless you specify LOOK.
Some programs insist o n
performing a long-winded
'picture d ra w ' o n  every
entry and this can detract
from the steady ﬂow of the
adventure. T h e r e  a r e
several examples o f  such
increased playability within
'The Hobbit', o n e  o th e r
being th e  use o f  ALL o r
EVERYTHING; it is so much
simpler to  type TAKE ALL
rather than specify a list of
individual items either as:
TAKE ROPE (Return), TAKE
SWORD (Return), TAKE
FOOD (Return) TAKE KEY
(Return), etc or even: TAKE
ROPE AND SWORD AND
FOOD AND KEY!
'The H o b b i t '  a l s o
provides a framework that is
in itself interacting w i th
your moves and commands.
You will ﬁnd Gandalf the
Wizard a n d  Th o ri n  t h e
Dwarf wandering in and out
of your story apparantly of
their o w n  volition. They
may e v e n  t a k e  various
objects either lying around
or in your (you play Bilbo
the H o b b i t)  possession.
Further interaction e ve n
allows for you to talk to or
issue requests (commands)
to these characters — SAY
 TO THORIN "CARRY ME"
is a perfectly acceptable and
actionable command,
Playing 'The Hobbit' can
be a  fa s c i n a ti n g  a n d
rewarding e xp e ri e n ce .
Melbourne H o u se  h a v e
even published a  b o o k
called A  Guide to Playing
the Hobbit' that will help
the frustrated to  complete
the game (well...perhaps!).
Even with this book at one's
elbow, t h e  attraction o f
playing is hardly lessened —
surely this could be said of a
few games!
Whilst o n  the topic o f
playing gui des o r  h i n t
sheets, Level N i n e  have
solved this problem in a very
sensible and clever manner_
Hint sheets may be obtained
listing large numbers of, for
example, 'things' — look up
the 'things' —  yo u  a re
'interested in (they are listed
alphabetically) and you will
ﬁnd a number; look up this
number in the answers and
you will be given a useful
clue. T h e  answers a r e
'jumbled up' so that, if you
really o n l y w a n t a  clue
rather than a big 'cheat', it is
possible not to  spoil your
adventure by knowing too
much! 'Colossal Adventure'
for instance has some 320
'questions' and answers.
The Legend of Valhalla
Following th e  success o f
'The H o b b i t ' ,  L e g e n d
Software produced w h a t

A d v e n t u r e
lEt
has become another classic
adventure game —  'Val-
halla'. This was very heavily
promoted prior to  its ﬁrst
appearance as a Spectrum
program and appeared to
offer an adventure game
with animated graphics,
with numerous characters
who, it was said, could be
converted t o  your cause,
who would overhear your
conversations and who may
or m a y  n o t  b e  taki ng
independent action on their
own o r  someone else's
behalf th r o u g h o u t t h e
game. O n c e  i t  became
available, 'Valhalla' became
almost an overnight success.
Time passed a n d  ﬁnally
'Valhalla' has n o w  been
released f o r  t h e  C o m -
mododre 64. 'Valhalla' may
be viewed in several ways; it
may be played as a quest, or
looked on as a 'mini-movie'
with y o u  t h e  p l a y e r
interacting as little o r  as
much as you like to try and
inﬂuence the outcome o f
the action. As a quest you
must search for and obtain
six speciﬁed items i n  a
speciﬁed order.
'Valhalla' takes a b o u t
eleven minutes to load and,
for a good part of that time,
you will have the title page
to look at: this only shows
the name o f the company
(Legend) a n d  t h e  game
(Valhalla) but it'5 better than
looking at a blank screen —
perhaps y o u  should b e
swatting u p '  o n  t h e
i n s tr u c ti o n s ! H a v i n g
loaded, you are given the
o p ti o n  o f  l o a d i n g  a
previously 'saved' game.
Once into your adventure,
you may save the game at
any point —  but you may
only load in this data after
the initial program load! So
to move time back a little (to
just b e f o r e  y o u  l o s t
something valuable) w i l l
take you about 14 minutes.
Left t o  i ts o w n  devices,
'Valhalla' will have various
characters — gods, giants,
dwarves, etc have different
shapes to aid identiﬁcation
— appearing within the top
two thirds of the screen: this
is t h e  graphics w i n d o w
withirovhich you will see a
picture o f  yo u r  location
(always l o o ki n g  n o rth ).
Various items— food, wine,
rings, jewels, keys, etc may
be visible and you are at
liberty t o  pick them u p ,
providing another character
does not d o  so ﬁrst! The
lower third of the screen is
split into a six line window
te l l i n g  y o u  w h a t  i s
happening and a two line
window where yo u  ma y
enter y o u r  commands.
'Valhalla' will accept simple
one l e t t e r  d i r e c t i o n
commands N , S , E , W  —
and also move elaborate
sentences such a s  SAGA
PUT RING IN CHEST.
Time taken to draw each
location i s  a b o u t 12-15
seconds and the time taken
to action your commands
varies enormously depend-
ing on what other actions
(yours o r  those o f  t h e
computer) are already o n
the 'stack'. This can  b e
frustrating as you may wish
to change a  command
because a certain character
has entered the scene since
you entered a n . a s ye t,
unactioned command! I t
can be a little difﬁcult trying
to type in what you want to
do w h i l s t  t h e  a c t i o n
continues o n  th e  screen.
Creatures attack each other
(and you) with monotonous
regularity and whilst they
are slogging i t  o u t  o n
screen' you must patiently
wait your turn. They really
are an aggressive l o t but,
although many are killed
(including y o u ! )  t h i s
is only a temporary setback
and reincarnation seems to
be the order of the day —
everyone r e tu r n i n g  a s
strong as they were in the
ﬁrst place.
The instruction booklet
provides a  fa i r l y  cl e a r
picture of how you may do
various things: eat, ﬁght,
move, buy, sell, e tc but,
understandably, does n o t
tell you how to achieve very
much! 'Valhalla' players
seem to fall into two distinct
categories —  those th a t
absolutely love it and those
that think it is a total waste of
time. There does seem to be
a m u c h  greater leaning
towards r a n d o m  a cti o n
interferring with your idea
of p r o g r e s s  i n  m o s t
adventure games but, is this
purely aggravated because
you are not learning from
your mistakes? I suspect that
the 'story-line' is fairly thin
but does demand that you
walk a narrow (quick) path
in t h e  r i g h t directions.
Deviate fo r to o  long and
you w i l l  b e  l o st i n  th e
random factors. Make maps
and record what you do; do
not g e t  sidetracked t o o
often! It is a pity that you
cannot load a saved game at
any time. If you foresake the
quest, i t is an interesting
exercise t o  attempt th e
alteration o f  some o f the
characters' alignments —
bad to good (or vice versa).
'Valhalla' i s  certainly a
fascinating adventure and
will surely prove to  be a
classic of its type. It is worth
playing if only to  ﬁnd out
your alignment — lover or
hater! Write in and tell us
_which you are.

Whilst computers a r e
the ultimate lack-of-all-
Trades', they will always be
beaten when confronted by
a device actually designed
to perform the function.
Just wh a t  i s  M I D I
anyway?
For th e  uninitiated, t h e
phrase M I D I  stands f o r
Musical Instrument Digital
Interface. A s  w i t h  a n y
interface, it is a means o f
passing information b e t -
ween o n e  location a n d
another.
Taken i n  i t s  simplest
form, MIDI will enable you
to p l u g  o n e  keyboard
equipped with the interface
into another and merrily
send information b a c k -
wards a n d  f o r w a r d s
between them. A simple set
up would be one keyboard
'listening' via MIDI to what
is being played on the other
keyboard. The information
being sent from the ﬁrst
keyboard w o u l d  b e  a
number corresponding t o
the key being pressed o n
the keyboard. This would be
sent in digital form through
MIDI to the other keyboard.
When t h i s  k e y b o a r d
receives it, it 'plugs' it into its
circuits so that the rest of the
keyboard thinks one of its
own keys has been pressed.
All this happens very fast, so
that what you end up with is
two keyboards playing i n
unison.
Of course, this is only a
small p a rt o f  th e  infor-
mation that can be sent via
MIDI.
Anyone familiar w i th
synthesisers will know that
on most o f them you can
create a sound and store it in
the s y n t h ' s  i n t e r n a l
memory. This is known as a
patch. During use, any o f
these p a tch e s c a n  b e
recalled by pressing one or
two b u t t o n s  o n  t h e
synthesiser, far better than
trying to change the settings
on 5 0  o r  6 0  knobs and
sliders.
A MIDI equipped synth
will also allow you to send
the patch number you are
currently using through the
interface. So if you are using
two or more synths linked
together you can change
the patch number on one
and also have the patches
change o n  a l l  th e  other
synths,
All i n  all, what MID I
allows you to  do in these
situations i s  t o  duplicate
what you are doing on one
synth on up to 16 others.
How does i t  work?
The MID I system is based
around a  serial data bus,
similar in many ways to our
old friend, the R5232. As
with all things serial, it's got
to h a p p e n  fa s t. RS232
operations usually happen
at around 19K, that's about
2K of information a second.
The MIDI system can send
and receive data at 31.25K.
Not surprising when yo u
think that it might be called
upon t o  control sixteen
keyboards at once.
Each data 'word' consists
of ten bits. A start bit which
is ze ro , ei ght data b i ts
making up the information
byte and ﬁnally a stop bit set
at one. Anyone w h o  has
mu cke d  a b o u t  w i t h
deﬁning characters o n  a
Commodore will know all
about turning an eight bit
b i n a ry n u m b e r  i n t o
decimal, and vice versa, so I
won't g o  into all o f  that
now.
The format of the MIDI
commands is more complex
than j u s t a  single b y te
representing t h e  n o t e
played. It must also take into
account the information for
the attack and decay rate of
the n o t e  a n d  w h i c h
keyboard the note is to be
played o n . Also implem-
ented is a system of control
codes, which preface th e
information f o r  p a tc h
changes, bends and other
control information.
Enter the computer
So far we have looked at
computers making music on
their own and sythesisers
talking to each other. Now
comes the interesting part
of putting them together.
What a computer is best
at is manipulating data i n
one form o r another. We
also n o w  have keyboards
pushing data o u t o f their
MIDI sockets. The ﬁrst task
is to ﬁnd a way to intercept
this information and route
it into the computer.
Luckily th i s i sn't th a t
much o f a problem. Since
the history o f  interfacing
computers goes back a long
way, it wasn't long after the
advent of MIDI that the ﬁrst
c o m p u te r  i n t e r f a c e s
became available. Because
of t h e  Commodore 64's
popularity, a large number
of these interfaces are for
the '64.
Like a l l  p i e c e s  o f
hardware, it is the software
which really makes t h e
system perform. But before
getting too deeply involved
with the soft side of things, it
would be best to meditate
on the nature of time.
Now before you get too
worried I  j u s t w a n t t o
introduce you to a new sort
of t i m e ,  s t e p  t i m e .
Everything th a t goes o n
around us is said to happen
in real time. Now, i f  w e
could break all the events
that happen i n to  handy
'bite-size' chunks and have
them happen to us when we
wanted them to, time would
appear to be made up of a
series o f steps, hence step
time.

The simplest piece o f
computer music software is
a step time sequencer. Every

keyboard the computer will

a c o u p l e  o f  r e c e n t

idea o f  th e  direction i n
which things are heading.
Firstly, a large number of
the s y n t h e s i s e r  a n d

are starting t o  produce
stand-alone MIDI modules,

all th e  sound production
capabilities of a full synth,

observed the way prices of
computer hardware have
dropped can see that i t is
only a matter of time before
they are available for less

they are in an ideal situation

In the end

THE P R OB L E M  W I T H
reviewing adventure games
is that you have to play it in
it's entirity (if you are going
to be fair) and then not give
anything away (or not too
much at least). Now, if it is a
good game it must have the
following qualities to keep
the p l a ye r (adventurer)
enthralled. It should, if it is a
text adventure, be descript-
ive and humorous with a
strong plot. The same goes
for a  graphics adventure
with the obvious additions.
Some people argue that
once you've ﬁnished a n
adventure th a t's i t ,  t h e
game's over! This is true but
with some adventures like
the Zork Series, they are
very difﬁcult indeed and
take a long time to  solve.
The other question is why
pay the prices people ask for
adventures w h e n  normal
games cost maybe half the
price? If a lot of thought has
gone i n t o  i t  a n d  t h e
planning is meticulous, then
it should b e  w o rth  t h e
money.
The Dallas Qu e s t i s
maybe o n e  o f  th e  best

wise, but ﬁrst of all let me
tell you a little of the plot.
You are a  world famous
detective w h o  has been
summoned to South Fork by
Sue Ellen. The reason for
this is that she would like
you to recover a map that
describes the whereabouts
of a very rich oilwell so that

which Sue Ellen also gives

Jones' R i g h t  n o w , y o u
understand th e  p l o t; i t's
nearly a s  g o o d  a s  t h e
Television programme!
As w i t h  m o s t  n e w
adventures on the CBM 64
that I have seen they all have
some degree o f  humour
built i n . For example, on
Dallas Quest there are two
very obvious jokes. One is
to do with the owl (no clues)
and the other is when you
get to a Cannibal Village, it
says something about a feat
of c o u r a g e  a n d  y o u
mistakenly h e a r h i m  say
feets of courage and start to
dance. I n  this animation,
three sprites of dancing girls
are used.
This conveniently leads
to the graphics and I must
say th a t a  great deal o f
thought has gone into it.
Each movement leads to a
new high resolution screen
and I must confess that, as
the game came close to it's
conclusion, the screens got
even better! The pictures of
things like a giant statue of
"Chugalug Jones" o r  th e
'Airport' were very good
indeed. The only disadvant-
age i n  having such high
quality screens is they take a
long time to be reproduced.
Yet again, thought has been
visibly used because th e
writer has put in the facility
to switch off the screens so
as to save time and enable
you t o  g e t t o  th e  point
where you g o t killed last
time!
Now if you have played
adventures b e fo r e  a n d
wished you could save up to
where you're about to  try
something dangerous, then
this is the Rolls Royce o f
games i n  enabling tha t
facility. In fact this program
allows y o u  t o  sa ve  9
different games before you
have to re-save or update a
copy. When I played it, it
was used to the full. Along
with this feature you are
given the chanc6" to use 9
clues;' you don't have to but
you can if need be.
You w i l l  n o ti ce  th a t
throughout this review I
have not mentioned music,
the reason being that there
isn't much use of S.I.D. chip
at a l l  a n d  unfortunately
what little there is does not
score very highly with me.
So, ﬁnally having got
through without dropping
too m a n y  h i n ts i n  this
review, I  must reach my
conclusion. It is one of the
best games out on the CBM
64; i t shows that the 64's
graphic capabilities a r e
equal, if not better, than its
competitors and' also shows
that the software available
on this machine is of a very
high quality and gives credit
to the programmers, along
with Commodore.
And, if all else fails, there
will be someone to listen to
your strangled cri e s o f
anguish and maybe even
help you!

S.L.F.P.
There are various other
characters in this game such
as magnets and a metal head
which appear from time to
time. There are a couple of
drawbacks with this game
though: the scoring system
which is a little too complex
and, also, the fact that you
can't sel ect a  l e ve l  t o

There is one last add itio

Pascal is intended for data

is a high level language. It
would be wise to consider
your reasons for wanting to

no mean amount to pay for

up then if it is Pascal that
you want then this would
not be a bad buy.

arcade game. Pesky Painter
is a new version of a game
called Amidar. Originally an
arcade machine game when
produced for the Atari VCS
machine, ﬁnally it has come
to the Commodore.
For those w h o  aren't
familiar with the game, a
description is in order. Peter
the Painter has to clean the
spots of dirt off the palace
walls but Peter is, unfort-
unately, lazy. The king o f
the palace tells his servants
to keep an eye on him and if
Peter stops f o r  a  b ri e f

Peter has to feed the king's

route through the maze (I
won't say how!) and when
the pet is released it will go
the route you have chosen.
The next screen is similar
to the ﬁrst, except that you
now have to paint the walls.
The way Peter does this is to
run round the outside o f
each square. Wh e n  t h e
square is completely cut off
from the next by paint it ﬁlls
in and you get the points
inside that square. There is
also a n  incentive, i n  th e

all; it looks as if it has been

between a glossy cover. The

enjoyed th e  very original
teaching method and the
ability to step through a list
of mnemonics w i t h  a n
explanation o f  what each
was doing was really very
good. It is easy to go back to
little bits that you did not
quite understand and just as
easy to  go forward i f you
come across things y o u
already know. This is the
ﬁrst machine code tutor that
I have come across that
really uses the machine as a
teaching a i d .  M y  o n l y
criticism with the program is
that at times the choice of
colours makes some parts of
the program hard to  read
but that is all. It will not
teach you machine code in
just a few hours but with
perseverance i t  sh o u l d
prove an invaluable aid in

THIS IS A  G O O D  G AME
for pool enthusiasts or for
people w h o  just want to
potter about o n  the pool
table. I n  th i s  particular
package you get six games
for the price of one. Games
which include three o n e
player games and three two
player games.
I must confess that I am
not a very good pool player
and can never get the balls
in the pockets (except the
white!), so when I started to
play i t was with reserved
feelings. M y  feelings were
magniﬁed further with the
presentation a n d  t h e
graphics on this game. But
the actual game content
made up for this.
Obviously a  l o t  o f
thought has gone into the
various games contained in
this program with selections
such as p u t  any ball in any
pocket being easy to cope
with or at the other end of
the scale — put each ball in
its own pocket. To  make
things easier, at the bottom
of th e  screen there i s a
potting strength meter and
the cue is represented by a
cross which you line up with
the shot you have in mind.
COULD THIS BE THE O LD
Atari game converted fo r
the 64, you may ask? The
answer is yes and it is a little
surprising how sedentary it
now appears. Perhaps i t is
ow ﬁnally beginning t o
show its age.
The object of the game
is t o  guide Pitfall Harry
through t h e  j u n g l e  t o
ﬁnd and collect 32 pieces of
treasure including diamond
rings, money bags and gold
and silver bars. All this has to
be done within a 20 minute
time limit. Harry actually
starts the game with 2000
points tucked under h i s
belt. Every ti me  h e  falls
down o n e  o f  th e  holes
hidden i n  th e  jungle h e
loses 1 0 0  p o i n ts  a n d ,
similarly, every time he gets
run o ve r b y  o n e  o f  th e
marauding logs. H e  also
starts the game with 3 lives
but there are several ways
that h e  can lose them as
well. Scorpions and cobras
have to  be avoided at all
costs as do the crocodiles,
although H a rry i s  agile
enough to  jump on their
heads when their mouths
are shut. There are also the
swamps, t a r  p i t s  a n d
quicksand t o  a vo i d  a l -
though h a n d i l ), placed
swinging vines can provide
the necessary escape route.
To ﬁnd the treasure, Harry
has to use the underground
passages a s  w e l l  a s th e
jungle...but rather you than
me ma te  because I  just
found the whole thing a bit
too damn silly.

difﬁcult. The idea of  the
game is t o get as far as
possible in the twenty levels
while collecting as many
points as possible.
The collection of points
can be done in many ways.
Firstly, just by driving you
accumulate points as long as
you don't crash. Then the
other ways are as follows:
you c olle c t points  b y
bumping or crashing your
fellow drivers' cars or  by
only bumping them on the

T h e  level you are on also

have t o  overcome, from
relatively simple levels at
the beginning t o  totally
insane levels later on in the
game. Some obstacles I
encountered, like the road
concerned about is that of
Pegasis the winged horse.
As always i n  the s e
trouble times there are the
good guys and the bad guys.
You are, of course, the good
guy in white and the bad
guys are in black. The idea
of this game is to knock the
bad Pegasis riders from their
mounts wit hout  be ing
knocked off yourself. T o
make life  a  little more

jump from one island to
another to reach the other
side, proved too much for

The graphics aren't the
best in the world but it is still
quite addictive.
difﬁcult, if you hit the riders
from underneath you fall
off. The other drawback is
that you will usually be out-
numbered 2 to 1 or, as you
progress through the levels,
3 to 1 or 4 to 1!
This game can be played
with one or two players so

The ide a  o f  'Flying

means it's your job to shoot

the ﬁsh. Occasionally a duck
will quack its way across the
bottom of the screen. This
signiﬁes that you have been
awarded an extra ﬁsh due to
your increasing score.
It appears that a lot more
could and should have been
done with this program as
the graphics aren't exactly
superb and it is a very slow
starting ga m e . I  must
confess that I felt more sorry
for the poor eagles than I
did for  the blood thirsty
gamekeeper.
This game has eight
levels of play with levels 4-8
allowing you to shoot as far
or as close as you wish. This

THERE HAS BEEN SOME
misconception i n  t h e

that the above title was a
utility. Far from it, it is in fact
a game. The basis behind
the game is that a friend's

inﬁltrated b y  organised
crime. It's your job, by using

How d o  yo u  d o  this?
Well, with the aid o f this
System 15000 which i s  a
telephone modem package
(not a real one!) you phone
various computers and gain
access to special data. The
real fun is when you ﬁnd
that the only help you have
to start with is a telephone
number o f  a  Polytechnic
and t h e  password f o r  a
Company.
Two points to remember
about this game is that it is
very original and it's very
frustrating! Th e re  a r e  a
couple o f  disadvantages,
the ﬁrst being that there
aren't enough instructions,
after a l l  n o t  everyone
knows, h o w  t o  operate
a modem. Th e  other is,
whilst playing this game,
there a r e  certain times,
when t h e  p o l i c e  a r e
checking the modem link
and you have to go ofﬂine
for a  long time, a  little
excessive perhaps!
I recommend you play
this game if you can. It could
become a cult game in years
to come and listen to  the
dialing tones as they are

IT IS YOUR TASK TO SEE
Bozo safely home from the
boozer where he has been
swilling pints and pints of
wobble juice providing, that
is, that you want to. There
are two ways you can guide
him home — the long way
and via the short cut. The
long way home is also the
obvious way, along the road
and Bozo's home can be
reached either by turning
left o r  ri g h t o u t o f  th e
boozer. The road is full of
temptingly p r e tty  g i rl s
desperate to stop Bozo from
making it to his destination
and other obstacles such as
marauding grannies a n d
arrest-happy policemen.
Bumping into any of these
people can result in the loss
of h i s  reserve p i n ts o f

spare pints will lose Bozo

there are some far more
unpleasant obstacles t o
avoid. Hiding behind th e

ferent twist. Being totally
conﬁdent of your driving
ability, you have anticipated
your win in advance and
celebrated be f or e  t h e
race! A s  a  result, y ou
are drunk (with alcohol,
not success!) and you end
up driving the wrong race in
the wrong direction!
You have to try to dodge
other racing cars coming
towards you and also avoid
oil slicks on the track. At the
same tim e  ( i f  your c o-
ordination can stand it) you
must try not to crash your
car into the side of the road.
Your task is to complete
ﬁfteen laps unscathed. The
controls are: Z — left, M —
right.
Don't forget, you are
only allowed three crashes,
so get out there behind the
wheel and drive the race of
your life!

This month's look at
the books which

Commodore user's

Book Title:

Author:
James Gatenby

Mr. Gatenby's book appears
to be yet another introd-

time under the guiseof int-
roducing the reader to the
world of data processing. It

to store large amounts o f
data, display the data on the
screen in an attractive and
readable way, search th e
data for particular items and
print o u t  t h e  relevant
information a n d  s o r t ,
update and amend the data,
all at a  speed to  make
manual systems redundant.
The book introduces the
reader t o  th e  most basic
tenets of computing: terms
such a s  ' p r o g r a m s ' ,
'microchips'. 'cu rso r' o r
program commands such as
'LOAD', fo r example, are
explained. The greater part
of th e  rest o f  th e  book
seems t o  b e  devoted t o
teaching the reader BASIC

(and adults, too) the words
'learning' and 'fu n ' aren't
usually synonymous. M r
Noble sets out to crush this
idea with his book which
claims to  make education
fun by allowing his readers
to learn through game-type
situations. Children m a y
learn i n  their o w n  time,
unpressurised b y  t h e

The games cover such
diverse aspects a s  arith-

Book Title:
Commodore 64 Disk

Author:
David Lawrence a n d

Publisher:

Price:

THIS IS A BOOK THAT IS
long overdue. It seems that
Commodore h a v e  n o
intention of updating their
own manual, and the sheet
of c o r r e c t i o n s  t h e y
promised to send me have
not yet shown their face.
Sunshine books have done
it. A well written, easy to
understand b o o k  w h i c h
takes away the mystery o f
relative, user, and program
ﬁles. It is easy to just dip in
and ﬁnd out what you need
and try it. It usually works.
The demo programs are not
quite up to the mark though
and I feel that some users
may g e t bogged d o w n
when th e y t r y  t o  ste p
through what each program
is d o i n g ,  b u t  t h e i r
explanations make u p  fo r
that. If you have a 1541 drive
and a r e  s t i l l  h a v i n g
problems then this book
will save your sanity. A little
expensive at 7.95 but I think
I spent more than that on
aspirin w h e n  using t h e
Commodore manual.

D.I. Stephenson
Publisher:

Price:
£7.95
THIS IS NOT SO MUCH A
book for the machine code
beginner but fo r those of
you w i th  a  sprinkling o f
machine code knowledge
which yo u  wish t o  build
upon; the authors do claim,
however, that, so long as
you've g o t t o  grips with
BASIC and are prepared to
put in a lot of hard work, this
book may be used as an
introduction t o  machine
code. Most of the material
contained in the book may
be u se d  w i th  t h e  6502
processor which is similar to
the Commodore's 6510A
processor,
Throughout th e  book,
the text is illustrated with
many examples including
full listings accompanied by
hex dumps. An assembler is
needed to master machine
code; t h e  M I K R O  6 4
assembler has been used to
develop the programs listed
in this book. Each chapter is
concluded with a succinct
and useful summary of the forward introduction t o
chapter for quick and easy
reference a n d , s o  a s t o
check your progress as you
plough through the book,
short tests (with answers at
the back o f the book) are
provided.
The b o o k  sta rts b y
assessing BASIC, compilers,
interpreters, ROMs, RAMs
and other e n e ra l  t o  i c s
and moves on to discuss the
6502/6510A microproces-
sor, various modes, entering
and assembling code. I t
then covers th e  area o f
programming in which the
advantages o f  ma ch i n e
code o v e r  BASIC really
come to  the fore, namely
sort r o u t i n e s ,  h i g h -
resolution graphics, sound
and, ﬁnally, an outline o f
TIL logic for those readers
whose interests e xte n d
beyond m e r e  program-
ming.
Not so much a straight-
machine code, this book is
rather the serious program-
mer's guide t o  mastering
machine code language on
the Commodore 64.

THE BOOK'S OUTWARD
appearance i s bright and
eye-catching with a 'comp-
uters i n  sp a ce ' design
adorning the front cover. It
provides th e  Commodore
user, in particular the disc
system novice, with inform-
ation o n  disc systems and
printers available fo r  use
with his machine. As well as
assessing the disc drive, the
1541, a n d  d i s c  systems
peculiar to the Commodore
64, th e  b o o k covers th e
commands to be used with
the disc systems, primarily
LOAD and SAVE, various
disc utilities and, in greater
detail, the ﬁling actions, an
integral part of business and
database applications f o r
which d i s c  systems a r e
largely required. For those
of you who do not merely
intend t o  use yo u r disc
system as a means of storing
programs and data, but wish
to master the techniques of
copying and deleting ﬁles,
backing-up discs, writing
machine code disc routines
or reading data from dama-
ged discs, M r .  Sinclair's
book provides you with the
knowledge t o  fulﬁl these
highly important functions.
A whole chapter is devoted
to a database type program
which comprises a  l o n g
listing followed by a detai-
led explanation. Th e  last
chapter offers information
on t h e  various printer
available fo r use with th
Commodore 64 and summ
arises th e  ways i n  which
(and the success with which)
they fulﬁl their function.
To conclude, the author
beheves, quite rightly, that

1 =
disc systems are a must for
the serious programmer
due to the greater memory
capacity they append to the
computer. "Commodore 64
Disk Systems and Printers"
includes a few (maybe too
few) clear a n d  succinct
diagrams. The listings thro-
ughout the book are made
easier to follow by replacing
the usual indistinctive Com-
modore graphic symbols
with CHRS(n) commands. A
selection o f  t h e  u su a l
appendices a re  provided
covering, f o r  example,
Random Access Files, lists of
commands and hardware

expands upon, th e  most
salient points to remember
when creating yo u r own

to the fast and furious Fire,
where you have 3 minutes
to extinguish a  ﬁre, and
Godzilla, where the might
of t h e  Japanese a rme d

IN PART 1 OF THIS SERIES,

the d i ffe re n t ty p e s  o f
variable we ought to make
sure we know exactly what
is meant by 'variable', This
word, and many others used
loosely in everyday speech,
take on a more restricted
and precise meaning when
they are used by program-
mers. It would seem a hair
splitting distinction to point
Out that the terms 'variable'
and 'variable name' are not
quite th e  same, Variable
names, such as AB, BS, or Cl
are r e a l l y  s y m b o l i c

Even this is abbreviated to
three signiﬁcant d i g i ts.
Besides being error prone
for humans, th i s clumsy
notation would be beyond
the r e s o u r c e s  o f  t h e
Commodore 64 because we
are limited to nine digits of
precision including leading
zeros a fte r  t h e  decimal
point. T o  overcome th e
obstacle presented by large
and small numbers, we can
use exponential notation in
ﬂoating point numbers. This
notation consists o f  tw o
parts:
• T h e  signiﬁcant d i g i ts
terminated by the letter E
• The power of 10 multiplier
Example: 310 can be written
as 3.1E2 which means 3.1
multiplied by 10 raised to
the power 2. I n  ordinary
maths, this would be written
as 3.1 x 10 2.
Example: 0.00031 ca n  b e
written as 3.1E-4.
As a ﬁnal example, we
return to the charge on the
electron. Th i s  n o w  b e -
comes:
1.59E-19
(Note carefully th a t t h e
negative exponent is always
one more than the number
of noughts before the ﬁrst
signiﬁcant digit).
There are certain upper
limits to be observed. If you
exceed them, you will get a
nasty message fr o m  t h e
computer. These limits are
as follows:
+ or - 1.70141183E+38

Unless you are an astro-
physics enthusiast ( t h e
diameter of the universe is
predicted to be in the order
of 10 76 metres) you are
unlikely to  even approach
these l i mi ts. Y o u  m a y
wonder why Commodore
has imposed such a strange
set of digits for the upper
limits but, if you persevere
with our series on machine
code (running concurrently
in this magazine), you may
be able to crack the puz7le.
Be very careful when

power of 10 multiplier (the
exponent) is more impor-
tant th a n  t h e  signiﬁcant
digits (the mantissa). If you
are four out in the mantissa
you could be mildly out in
your calculations. If you are
four out in the exponent,
the mistake will border on
the ca ta stro p h i c. T h e
previous e xa mp l e s o f
exponential form may have
given th e  impression that
the mantissa must always be
a single digit followed by a
point. This is not so. There
are various ways of ﬁddling
around with th e  mantissa
and t h e  exponent. F o r
example, 2,456E5 ca n  b e
written as 24.56E4 or 245.6E3
or as 2456E2 because all
three forms represent the
same absolute number. It is
just a case of juggling with
the mantissa and exponent.
As you move the point, a
corresponding change must
be made to  the mantissa.

String variables
A string variable can hold
virtually anything. Although
a string can hold a number,
it ca n  also h o l d  letters,
punctuation a n d  special
characters. To  inform th e
computer that the variable
is to hold strings, the name
must end in the dollar sign
'S'. For example, AS, D3S.
SFS are all string variable
names. A l t h o u g h  t h e
mixture doesn't matter, the
total number of characters
in one string variable must
not exceed 255.
When we put something
into a string variable, i t is
vitally important to observe
the so-called 'matching'
rule. This simply means that
both sides of an assignment
must be string variables or in
equivalent stri n g  fo r m .
Before going into details of
mis-matching w e  m u s t
remember that when w e
wish to  assign a  string o f
characters t o  a  s tr i n g
variable, t h e y  m u s t  b e

For example, suppose w e
wish to store the following
 message in a string variable
named M$:
MS =  "DANGER !  UNEX-
PLODED BOMB"
Note t h a t  th e re  i s  n o

Arithmetical assign-

The kind o f  operation
performed depends on the
operator. There are three
classes of 'operator', but, for
the moment, we are only
interested in the algebraic
class. There are six of them,
and although they are listed

In normal algebra, C=AB

The operator /  is used
for dividing one variable or
number by another.

normal algebra.
The operator is used to
raise a number or variable to

have to  remember that a
number too small can cause
underﬂow errors although
the error message from the
computer w i l l  s ti l l  s a y

Example: PRINT 1 0
Parenthesis
The characters ' (' and ')' are
used to indicate parenthesis
or, using everyday lang-
uage, 'brackets'. They act as
a box to override the natural
rules of precedence in the
computer (see page 27 of
the Commodore 64 User
Manual). As recommended
in Part 1, use them liberally
because the arithmetic in
complex expressions can be
very hard to  follow i f too
much reliance is placed on
precedence. Paranthesis are
used exactly as they would
be i n  ordinary algebra
although, once again, it is
easy to make a mistake by
omitting the multiplication
operator.
! Example: D=A(B+C)
won't work as intended. It
would with normal pencil
and paper algebra but not
in BASIC. I t  should b e
written D=A*(B+C).
Another common source
rce of error which can cause
fru stra ti o n  i s  w h e r e
parenthesis a r e  u s e d
wrongly in division.
Example: D=(A+B)/C+D
intend t o  divide b y C+D
then i t should be written,
D=(A+B)/(C+D).
Rounding errors
It i s commonly supposed
that computing arithmetic is
dead accurate. Fo r  most
practical purposes, t h e
su p p o si ti o n  i s  t r u e .
However, slight errors can
creep d u e  t o  t h e  ﬁnite
precision o f  t h e  BASIC
interpreter. According t o
Commodore, the arithmetic
is correct to nine signiﬁcant
digits. Internal calculations
are taken to ten digits but,
before 'printing o u t  t h e
result, t h e  l a st d i g i t i s
dropped and the ninth digit
rounded. I f  y o u  a r e  a
newcomer t o  computing,
don't b e  disillusioned b y
this. A f t e r  a l l ,  h o w
important is an error in the
ninth digit? W e  should
remember t h a t  i n  p r e -
historic days, when the slide
rule was in constant use, we
were lucky t o  g e t three
signiﬁcant digit accuracy.
Even l o g s, w h i ch  w e r e
considered q u i t e  g o o d
enough for most technical
subjects, only gave four ﬁg-
ure accuracy. There can be a
slightly m o r e  se ri o u s
problem w h e n  using th e
special functions such as SIN
(x), C OS(x) e t c .  Th e se
functions are produced by
special m a c h i n e  c o d e
subroutines using equations
which are good approxi-
mations to the function over
most of the range, However,
the a c c u r a c y  o f  t r i g
functions deteriorates at the
extreme end of the range.
This again can be expected
because trigonometrical
functions in real life tend to
go a  b i t funny near the
limits. F o r  example, t h e
tangent o f  90 degrees is
inﬁnity s o  i t  i s  still a n
enormous number when it
is close t o  9 0  degrees.

Simon Roc man gives
you all sorts of hints
on how to become a
sneaky programmer.
SNEAKY
PROGRAMMING
ALL COMPUTERS A N D
computer systems have
their quirks, th e Com-
modore is no exception. A
good programmer will
know about and program
around them. A  sneaky
programmer will exploit
them to the full. This article
is all about how to be a
sneaky programmer.
A I M  Al el
Loading ﬁles
The Commodore tape
system is slow and reliable,
but it does have one feature
few people know about.
This is the ability to load a
selected ﬁle by using part of
the ﬁle name. To illustrate
this imagine that you have a
tape with three programs on
it called "JOHN", "JAMES"
and "GEORGE". To load the
ﬁrst program ("JOHN") you
can just type in LOAD and
press RETURN (o r  use
SHIFT/RUN STOP). If you
want to load the second ﬁle,
bypassing the ﬁrst you can
type LOAD "JAMES" and
the computer will search for
that ﬁle ﬁnding, but not
loading, "JOHN". What
most people miss is that it is
not necessary to type the
whole name in; just LOAD
"JA and pressing RETURN
will perform th e same
function, similarly to load
the last ﬁle, "GEORGE",
with the tape wound to the
beginning i t  i s  only
necessary to type LOAD
"G and press RETURN. This
not only saves time but
means that you can load a
speciﬁc ﬁle even when you
have forgotten the end of
the name.

and VIC. This enables auto-

In Britain we write the date
in the order day/month/
year, but in America they
use month/day/year. The
world I S O standard i s
however year/month/day
and for computers this is the
most logical method o f
storing a date if it has to be
manipulated. This format
allows the computer to son
the date. Take the 1st of
January 1984 and 25th of
September 1983. Wh en
used in the format 01011984
and 25081983 the date in
1983 has a greater value than
the one in 1984. It would be
possible t o  store th e
information like this and
then chop the number up
and sort all three bits
separately but this would be
slower and less efﬁcient
than having the dates held
as 19840101 and 19830825
which follow in sequential
order. When doing this it is
important that you rem-
ember to pad out the spaces
with zeros.
Toolkits
One of the commands often
found in add-on toolkits is
TRACE o r  I RON which
displays th e line being
executed as the program
runs. This is very useful
when debugging code. The
same sort of operation can
be performed with a STOP
command; before th e
program is run insert a STOP
before and after the loops
where you thi nk th e
program is going wrong.
Then when the 'program is
run i t  wi l l  break i n
displaying the line number.
You can continue usint; the
CONT command providing
that you do not cause any
errors or alter the program.
STOP has t h e  added
advantage that values can
be inspected by using a
PRINT while the computer
is in direct mode. Once the
program is debugged all the
SIOPs can be removed.
A I L  A I M
Rogue lines
When writing a program it is
quite common for there to
be a line which you are sure
is right but seems to be
causing the program to go
wrong. T h e  obvi ous
solution is to delete the
offending line to see if it was
the culprit. If it wasn't the
best bet is to re-enter the
line and try elsewhere. This
is a  l i t t l e  c o u n te r -
productive because you
end up typing things in
twice. A neater solution is to
REM out the line. If you
change the ﬁrst three letters
to REM then the line will do
nothing while you test the
program. When you want to
use the line again you can
just over type the REM with
the original letters. O f
course just taking bits out
does not cure a program-
ming problem but it can
reduce confusion when
several com pl i cated
operations are taking place
at once.
A n k  A M I
Screen editing ,4or
The Commodore screen
editor is one of the nicest
ways of entering programs
that anyone has come up
with. What you enter on the
screen is what you get. One
thing it does lack is the
ability t o  merge lines.
Imagine a  program with
these lines
5100 I FAS="SNEAKY"THEN
AS='"'
51 20 PRINT "SNEAKY
HUH?"
This routine will always print
"SNEAKY HUH? ".  T o
change it to only print the
message w h e n  A $ = "
SNEAKY" would mean re-
typing the PRINT "SNEAKY
HUH?" at the end of line
5100 and removing line
5120. The clever way to do
this is to list the two lines
and them move the cursor
to the space between the
5 1 20 an d  t h e  P RI NT
command. Enter a colon (:)
and move the cursor back
one space onto the colon.
Now hold down the shift
and press insert twenty
three times, until the colon
goes lust past the quotes
from AS" ". Still holding
down t h e  shi ft press
RETURN. The cursor will
move but the line will not
have been entered. Now
move the cursor up to the
line above the 5100 which
should still be on the screen.
This line may have the LIST
command above it. Type
LIST again and the ﬁrst part
of the 5100 line will fall into
place in front of the end of
the 5120 line. Move the
cursor up to this line and
press RETURN over it. This
operation sounds compli-
cated when described on
paper but if you try it, and
get into the habit of using it,
then you will save a lot time
when changing yo u r
programs.
AM1  A E I
Protection ,dir
There are times when you
want to protect a program
from prying eyes. Most
protection has to be done in
machine code especially
when you want to stop
people from pirating your
software. However, there
are cases where j ust
stopping a  person from
listing a line will sufﬁce. On
the Commodore 64 this can
be done using a shifted i in a
REM line. Just type
7 REM (Shifted L)
then when you list it the
result will be:
/  REM
?SYNTAX ERROR
READY.
Please do not use this in any
programs you send to "Your
Commodore" because we
will only have to remove
these lines t o  us e t he
program in the magazine.
IF7THEN100 may a t
ﬁrst glance seem to be a
syntax error, if Z what?. The
meaning i s really quite
simple. The line has the
same effect as saying
IFZ M E N U *  but saves
three bytes. This is called a
truth test and there are
sneaky ways in which it is
possible to use the equals
sign. Try PRINT 1=1, this will
give you the answer -1
which is the '64's way of
saying true. PRINT=1 will
return 0,  meaning false.
These operations should be
used with care and carefully
REMed because they can
get confusing. They are a
very useful and compact
way of making a comparison
and will work with strings as
well as numbers.
Incorporating routines
When writing a large system
it is common practice to
have a  set o f  standard
subroutines which can be
called from disc when
needed. On a small system it
is often desirable to do a
similar th i n g  b u t  t o
incorporate the routine in
each program. If you have a
BASIC extension i t  i s
possible to SAVE the routine
and then MERGE it into the
main program. However, if
you only have a standard
machine it will be necessary
to re-type the section of
code each time it is needed.
That i s unless you are
sneaky. With routines that
are less than a screenful you
can cheat. Load the small
routine and list it to the
screen. Make sure that you
have ﬁve lines spare at the
bottom and then load the
main program. Without
clearing the screen take the
cursor to the ﬁrst line of the
routine to be incorporated
and press RETURN. Do this
for all the lines you want to
merge. If you have more
than twenty lines in the
subroutine you can repeat
this process in twenty line
chunks.

on any unexpanded VIC 20.
In Rapier Punch, as a
knight in a darkened room
with only the areas you cross
lit up, your aim is to ﬁnd the
hidden tre a su re  c h e s t
before th e  timer reaches
zero and to move on to the
next level o f  th e  game.
There are 100 levels in the
game and details o f your
score, game level, number
of lives remaining and time
left to complete the game,
are displayed on the top line
of the screen. But your goal
is hampered b y  spinning
crosses, D r a g o n s  a n d
Dragons' eggs set on ending
each o f  your 3  lives and
safeguarding the treasure.
As you destroy these b y
ﬁring daggers o r  running
into them with your rapier,
and ﬁnally achieve t h e
ultimate i n  collecting the
treasure, y o u  accumulate
points.
The aim of Starbase is to
prevent a team of scientists,
diligently preparing t h e
surface o f Planet XA2 fo r
colonisation, f r o m  bei ng
captured by an alien force
attacking the planet and to
destroy a l l  t h e  a l i e n
spacecraft. This is achieved
by patrolling each o f the
four quadrants of the planet
(marked across the bottom
of t h e  screen) a n d  b y
destroying the alien ships
automatically o n c e  y o u
have them i n  your sight.
The top line of the screen
tells you how many men you
have l e ft o n  th e  planet's
surface a n d ,  o n c e  t h e
attacking aliens have been
destroyed and all your men
are captured, t h e  game
ends.
Both Rapier Punch and
Starbase need a  joystick,

This article consists of four
demonstration programs on
raster graphics. They are as
follows:
1. Splitting screen colour
2. M ix ing user-deﬁned
graphics with standard 'Pet'
graphics.
3. Switching between hi-
resolution and text.
4. Displaying more than 8
'sprites' on screen.
The program listings should
be typed i n  a nd saved
immediately before  a n y
attempt is  made t o  r un
them. If the programs have
been typed in correctly, you
will be given the option of
running the demonstration,
otherwise error reports will
be printed on screen.
One warning: before
even a t t e m p t i n g  t o
understand the concept of
raster interrupts, you should
have a  fairly reasonable
understanding of machine
language.

Included with each of
the four demonstrations is a
fully documented Assembly
language listing. These
should be studied carefully
until such time as you get an
understanding o f  t h e
procedure involved; b y
then you will be ready to
experiment on your own.
Raster interrupt
registers
There are three very im-
portant registers used with
raster Interrupts: the raster
compare register ($D012),
the interrupt status register
($13019) and the interrupt
enable register.
The raster itself scans the
screen a n d  i s  v is ible
between the dot positions
of 50 and 250, which is 200
dot positions altogether or
25 ﬁnes x 8 dots,
To obtain a ﬂicker free
screen display, the raster
compare register should be

set to a value which is out of Bit
the 'visible patch', eg, 0-49 0
(incl) and 250-255 ( id) .
The interrupt status 1
register, when read, gives
the c u r r e n t  s ta tu s  o f
interrupts, ie, if any bit set in
the interrupt status register
corresponds with a bit set in
the i n t e r r u p t  e n a b l e
register, then an interrupt
from that source will take or
is already taking, place.
The appropriate bits of
the interrupt status register
are as follows:
Condition
Set when raster
c o mp a r e  reac hes
the preset value,
Set when sprite
collides with back-
ground
2 S
e
t
 when sprite
collides with
another sprite
3 T r i g g e r e d  by light
pen/riﬂe.
4 T h i s  bit is set
whenever any of
the above bits are
set.
It is interesting to note that it
is standard procedure for
the 'VIC chip' to execute

Final Note
Once an interrupt has been
carried out, it is important to
write a  l f r  back t o  th e
correct bit in the interrupt
status register ($DM). This
signiﬁes that the interrupt
has been processed.
The fo rma t f o r  each
interrupt i s  basically th e
same; read th e  Assembly
listing carefully a n d  yo u
should get t o  understand
the method used in setting
up raster interrupts. Do not
be afraid t o  experiment.
Start with simple routines
and gradually w o rk your
way t o  u s i n g  mu l ti p l e
interrupts. Remember you
can but try.
Conversion hints
As all o f the four routines
use th e  Commodore 64's
extensive graphics facilities,
it is not even worth thinking
about converting t o  any
other micro, unless VIC 20
users think they can make
the necessary changes i n
each ro u ti n e , excluding
number 4 , as the VIC 20
does n o t support 'Sprite
Graphics'.
Set the sprite pointers of all the eight sprites In
block no. 13
Also make all the sprite colours white.

Resident 'agony uncle',
Simon Rockman
endeavours to solve II
your Commodore
problems.
Dear Sir,
What is CP/M? If! buy the
Commodore 6 4  C P / M
cartridge can I use software
from other machines?
Yours faithfully,
A Campbell.
Glasgow.
We answer,
CP/M i s  a n  operating
system. The ROM of a 64 can
be roughly divided up into
two sections, Basic a n d
Operating Systems; i n  the
64 it is known as the kernal.
CP/M replaces these and
uses a  Z8 0  c h i p  a s  a
processor. This allows the
computer to conform to a
rigid standard. A  b i t  o f
clever software, called the
NIOS, tells CP/M how your
machine is conﬁgured, that
it has a screen, disc and a
keyboard, a n d  translates
from the 64 hardware to the
CP/M so ftw a re . E v e r y
machine that runs CP/M has
its own BIOS which links into
standard CP/M. To CP/M all
computers look the same.
This m e a n s  t h a t  a n y
program written to conform
to the CP/M standard will
work o n  any o f the many
CP/M computers. There is
one major drawback. This is
the lack of a standard for a
disc format. Because th e
hardware for disc drives has
improved so rapidly it is not
possibly to read any disc on
any drive. This is especially
true o f the 1541 which is
totally non-standard. To run
any C P/M software using
the ' 6 4  cartridge i t  i s
necessary to ﬁnd a supplier
with the correct disc format.
These are very few and far
between. The other major
problem with C P/M discs
is th a t a  l o t  o f  C P / M
programs expect dual disc
system cannot cater for this.
CP/M usually requires an 80
column display, this means
that a n y  program which
uses this cannot be run on a
64. T h e  m o s t  u s e f u l
application left for CP/M on
the ' 6 4  i s  f o r  running
languages, CP/M provides
for all the major languages;
all you have to worry about
is disc size and format. Still
at £ 5 0  t h e  Commodore
cartridge is very cheap.
Dear Sir,
When typing i n  programs
from magazines o fte n  ﬁnd
that the lines in the listing
will not ﬁt in. How can I
squash all the text onto one
line? Another problem I
have with magazine listings
is when a program comes up
with an error message when
there is nothing wrong with
the line it says but another
line has a mistake in it.
Yours faithfully,
John Thomspon,
Newcastle.
We answer,
Since t h e  early days o f
Commodore computers life
has been made easy for the
programmer by the use of
shorthand commands. The
most common o f these is
the use of ? for PRINT, but
there are a whole bunch of
these commands which are
listed i n  the back o f your
manual (page 130 i f  you
have a Commodore 64). The
Commodore screen editor
will allow you to put eighty
characters on each line (88
abbreviations will cause the
line to expand past this, Try
this line:-
you will need to move the
cursor back t o  hit return
over it. When you list the
line i t will have expanded
out to six lines (more on a
VIC). Th i s i s  useful f o r
cramming subroutines onto
one l i n e  b u t makes th e
program very hard to work
on because each time you
want to change the line you
have t o  c o n v e r t e a ch
keyword b a c k  t o  i t s
shorthand form (or token).
For this reason the practice
should b e  a vo i d e d , i f
necessary split the line up
into two short lines. This will
be slower but easier to work
with.
The problem o f  t h e
computer reporting t h e
error message is one which
confuses a lot of ﬁrst time
users. T h e  c o m p u t e r
complains when i t detects
the error n o t necessarily
when the error occurs. The
usual p r o b l e m  w i t h
magazine programs occurs
with the READ and DATA
statements. I t  i s  q u i te
common t o  have a  short
loop within a program like
this:-
510 FOR JJ=Z TO Z+8:READ
NU:POKE JJ,NU :NEXT
520 DATA 12,42,95,11,49,1,
52,252
This routine is perfectly
OK ( i t w o n 't work here
because it is only part of a
program so don't type it in).
If you should miss a comma
from line 520 it will show up
as an error in line 510. This
will take the form of either
an ?illegal quantity error or
an ?out o f data error. The
former w i l l  happen  i f
missing a comma Has caused
the program t o  READ a
number greater that 255 (say
the comma between the 11

L e t t e r s
error will occur i f all the
other values are OK but it
runs out of data. The ?illegal
quantity error is produced
by the POKE trying to use
too large a  number. The
computer c a n n o t g u e ss
what you are trying to read
the data fo r  and so  will
never produce an error in a
data line, except when the
syntax i s  wrong. S o  b e
careful when using the line
number from an error i n
...report.
Dear Sir,
I want to put my name in a
box at the start of a program
but whenever I use a REM
and the graphics symbols
get a load of keywords that I
don't want, how can I ﬁx
this?
Yours faithfully,
Simon Jenson,
London
We answer,
In another letter we talked
about tokens, t he  short
form of keywords; you have
come across a  b u g  i n
Commodore BASIC. It takes
any shifted character and
converts it into a keyword.
This is particularly notice-
able in lower case mode,
Press the Commodore key
and shift to go into lower
case and then type:-
1 rem Your Commodore.
When you list it you get:-
1 rem gosubour lenomore
The c o m p u t e r  h a s
converted t h e  Y  i n to  a
gosub and the C into a len.
There is a way around this,
use quotes:-
1 rem "Your Commodore
will always list correctly, so
to draw a box around your
name start each line with a
'REM" '; there is no need
to close the quotes.
Dear Sir,
I am having an argument
with a friend, he says that
you should always have a
letter after a NEXT, b u t I
know that it works without,
who is right?
Yours faithfully,
Rawlings,
Bath,
We answer,
Both of you! If you miss out
the variable name after a
NEXT in a FOR...NEXT loop
the computer will look back
to see if it is in the middle of
any loops and assuming it is
it will use that variable, so
you a r e  right. However
don't get big headed, there
is a  school o f  thought,
known a s  s tr uc tur e d
programming which says
that not only must programs
work but they must be easy
to w o rk o n . That means
everything should be laid
out clearly. If you have a lot
of FOR...NEXT loops it can
get confusing as to  which
FOR a NEXT is referring to.
For this reason it is good
practice to label the NEXT.
There are two drawbacks to
this — memory and speed.
Putting the variable in takes
up memory, only one byte
but it still takes up a little.
On a '64 this may not matter
but on a 3.5K VIC every byte
matters. The  other draw-
back is speed. If you omit
the variable the computer
assumes that it is in the right
loop a n d  ploughs o n ,
however if you include the
variable i t  stops f o r  a
fraction o f  a  second t o
check that it  is the right
variable before proceeding.
For this last reason I would
omit the letter but this does
not mean that your friend is
wrong, just less efﬁcient,
Hint. You can save memory
in data statements by not
using zeroes. I f  you just
have a  comma the READ
statement will assume zero,
or null for strings:-
20 READ N
30 PRINT N,
40 NEXT
50 DATA 1,„1,3
Will produce
1 0  0  1  3

Your Commodore's
Alison Hiul heads
porth in search of 1111
some insight into the
soaring success of
Coventry-based
software company,
PSS.
I WAS SENT TO COVENTRY
yesterday. N o ,  m y  w o r k
colleagues hadn't agreed to
ostracize m e  fr o m  th e i r
company: the Coventry in
question was the Warwick-
shire city of motor industry
and m o d e r n  ca th e d ra l
fame. M y  mission —  t o
detect PSS's formula f o r
success. PSS, for the uninit-
iated i s  th e  acronym fo r
Personal Software Services.
Escorted b y  PSS's PR
agent, David Crossweller, I
reached m y  destination.
PSS's headquarters a r e
ensconced i n  a  slice o f
Midlands' suburbia. T h e
converted-semi e xte ri o r
concealed a  conglomera-
tion o f  ofﬁces brimming
with examples o f  th e i r
proliﬁc software o u tp u t
(both past a n d  present),
assorted pieces of hardware
and industrious staff, a l l
more in keeping with the
position th e y h o l d  a s a
thriving software company
in a  highly competitive
industry.
In the beginning.
PSS was instituted 2% years
ago b y  t w o  W a r w i c k
University management
science graduates, G a r y
Mays and Richard Cock-
ayne. These t w o  yo u n g
entrepreneurs, unwilling to
become yet two more cogs
in th e  wheel o f  a  large
company, decided to set up
th e i r o w n  b u s i n e s s .
A quarter-page advert-
isement f o r  c o m p u te r
games o n  tape instigated
their entry into the world of
computers. W i t h  a  l i ttl e
mental arithmetic a n d  a
modicum o f  c o m m o n
sense, the duo established
their business on the criteria
that a  5 0 p  ta p e  co u l d
justiﬁably b e  sold fo r ES.
Armed with no computing
knowledge but with their
couple o f  management
science degrees, Mays and
Cockayne advertised for the
tools with which to  build
their dream: the result —
a deluge o f replies from a
willing f o r c e  o f  p r o -
grammers.
Initial steps
PSS launched their career in
the software industry with
the creation o f their own
software library whereby
subscribers could borrow
and copy from a library of 30
tapes. F o r  reasons u n -
known t o  Gary Mays, i t
failed.
But, with the assistance
of a  Coventry business
enterprise scheme offering
them [40 a week to establish
their company, Mays and
Cockayne overcame th i s
initial setback. The money
kept them going for three or
four months until the birth
of th e i r  ﬁr s t successful
product, QSave, a fast-load
device for the ZX-81. The
software a n d  hardware
were sold as a  complete
package and, over a period
of 18 months, a sales ﬁgure
of 30,000 was achieved.
Commodore hits the
scene
Although PSS now design
and w r i t e  t h e i r  o w n
software, •they originally
marketed l a r g e l y  t h e
produce o f other software
houses. Having concentra-
ted mainly o n  Spectrum
software, b y  March 1983
they were unable to avoid
the advent of Commodore
onto th e  British market.
Claims Gary Mays:
"We didn't have a huge
success with Spectrum: we
came in too late. Everything
was ticking over nicely, but
it occurred t o  u s  th a t
Commodore were going to
be big".
The ﬁrst hurdle they had
to cross was the absence of
su i ta b l e  C o m m o d o r e
products. A  l o t  o f  their
software h a d  previously
been submitted by young-
sters b u t Gary Mays saw
Commodore as a different
kettle of ﬁsh altogether,
"For some reason Com-
modore s e e m s  t o  b e
different in that kids don't
program it".
"I went to Chicago for
the CES [Consumer Elect-
ronic Show] last June with
the sole intention of picking
up Commodore Software
from a stateside company".
Symbol Software came
to their rescue and they
soon h a d  a  h i t  w i t h
Neoclipse which featured in
the sta r l i st o f  various
computer magazines. Gary
Mays attributed Neoclipse's
success to its exploitation of
Commodore sprites a n d
graphics which ma n y o f
their rivals appeared t o
neglect. Also, quite simply,
'It was fun to play".
Birth of a concept
Now that PSS are producing
their own software, nearly
all t h e i r  programs a r e
produced b y  i n -h o u se
programmers rather than
freelancers, which has given
them tighter control over
both programs a n d  ti me
scales.
"We were ending u p
with a  product which, as
far as they [their external
programmers] w e re  co n -
cerned, was ﬁnished". And
"We never knew when i t
[the program] was coming".
How do PSS attain their
ideas? Gary Mays again:
"The initial spark for an idea
can come from anyone.
then Richard a n d  I  and
Campbell MacCausland,
the software manager, sit
around a table and thrash
ideas out until we agree".
Although hardly i n his
dotage himself, Gary Mays
says that one problem PSS
do face is getting onto the
same wave-length as th e
kids (of whom their market
is largely composed). So as
to escape th e  danger o f
swamping the market with
their own ideas, PSS include
w i th  t h e i r  p a c k a g e s
questionnaire cards to pick
the brains and ideas of their
buyers. This has proven a
very successful formula.
Until re ce n tl y, th e i r
Commodore games have
been largely arcade-type
games.
"We try to write simply
what th e  market wants'
Judging by the direction
in which PSS are now head-
ing, their users must b e
crying o u t fo r  something
more complex than a simple
arcade-type game.
Into battle
Midway, a wargame based
= :

P r o ﬁl e
PSS certainly seem to have
their ears to the ground as
far as coming up with the
right product at the right
time is concerned. Where
other companies w i t h ,
se e mi n g l y, a s  m u c h
potential have ﬂoundered,
they have not only survived
but h a v e  managed t o
achieve a 100% increase in
turnover within t h e  last
year. T h e  m a r k e t  h a s
exploded a n d  PSS have
kept abreast of it. They also
feel t h a t  success h a s
enabled them to take more
of a gamble; thus, they can
follow through ideas which
more cautious companies
can but dream about. And,
naturally, th e  higher th e
standards t h e y  s e t, t h e
higher the standards they
will be expected to  attain
and, thus, will endeavour to
maintain.
Advertising a n d  t h e
assistance of a PR company
are also quite indispensable
in a fast and furious business
which Gary Mays likens to
the record singles' market.
But PSS are blooming
under such pressure. When
questioned on his views on
the industry's future, Gary
once again borrowed the
record analop by suggest-
ing 'albums' o f  software.
These, he believes, would
work i n  everyone's favour
by extending the life o f a
piece of software.
"I think what we'll see
are compilation tapes o r
discs". But such a concept
seems a l i e n  t o  l'ISS's
competitors.
"At the moment, on the
one hand people talk to-
gether about issues, on the
other they don't talk about
money".
And so to  their future
with Commodore: d o e s
Gary Mays see PSS opting
increasingly f o r  C o m -
modore products?
"I think we've got to: it's
a world market rather than a
UK one."
With their acute insight
into the software industry 7 7
and courage to  pursue a
novel concept, I hope that
PSS d o  ma i n ta i n  t h e i r
conﬁdence in Commodore
as a  vehicle f o r  th e i r
C
on the famous World War II
battle, was PSS's ﬁrst British
produced package for the
Commodore. Although on
release for no more than 3
weeks, at the time of going
to press, the reaction t o
Midway already seems very
encouraging to  PSS's Gary
Mays.
"It was a bit of a gamble.
Alan (Alan Steel, Midway's
creator) h a s  b e e n  a
wargamer since t h e  age
of 16. H e  k e p t getting
different wargames but got
fed up with the standard. He
came to us and suggested he
wrote a wargame".
In fact, since a complete
wargaming system has now
been devised, M i d w a y
promises to be the ﬁrst of a
series.
On your bike
With their newest offering,
Hyper Biker, PSS are indeed
satisfying the latest craze,
Much to Gary Mays' relief,
an idea instigated 8  o r 9
months ago hasn't waned.
"Because B M X  biking
seems t o  b e  t a k i n g
off i n  a  so l i d  s o r t o f
way, i t ' s  ma i n ta i n i n g .
Practically every kid I  see
seems to have a BMX bike..
it looks good and applies
well to the computer
PS5's software manager,
Campbell MacCausland,
gave me a brief overview of
the game. It's a 4-player,3-D
game w i t h  j o ysti ck o r
keyboard control o f  th e
bike. Ga r y  M a y s  i n te r-
jected:
"The ﬁrst thing the play-
er has to get to grips with is
controlling th e  bike. A n
awful l o t o f research has
gone into getting it realistic
and playable".
With a selection of eight
different events to  choose
from, fo r example, a  ﬂat
race, an obstacle race or a
wheeling c o m p e ti ti o n ,
coupled with such accurate
bike co n tro l , Campbell
MacCausland believes Hy-
per Biker has captured as
closely as possible, the real
thing.
"We've really gone out
of our way in not just calling
the game BMX but trying to
simulate as near as possible
what would be done in BMX
competition".
Gary May and Richard Cockayne
With a scrolling display
enabling the background to
pass b y  a s  y o u  pedal,
graphics which they claim
cannot be faulted and the
afore mentioned features
incorporated into a game,
which, above all, is fun to
play. PSS believe they are
Onto a winner.
Gary Mays' retort to my,
perhaps, insolent remark
that maybe a child, thrilled
by th e  speed and excite-
ment of riding a BMX bike
would not be so enraptured
by the prospect of operating
a simulated B M X  b i k e
through t h e  medium o f
computer, m o n i to r  a n d
joystick, w a s  th a t th e re
was " .  . n o  reason why
competition i n  computer
games could n o t b e  th e
same as in a street".
Maybe, come Decem-
ber, a TV screen in a ﬁre-lit
sitting room will be more
enticing than a  w e t and
windy street, especially i f
Hyper Biker is as realistic as
its makers claim.
Magical mystery tour
With their latest brainchild,
'Swords and Sorcery', PSS
claim t o  have surpassed
anything yet imagined b y
th e mse l ve s o r  t h e i r
competitors. I n  fact, th e
concept of a computerised
version o f the role-playing
game, 'D u n g e o n s  a n d
D ra g o n s', h a s  b e e n
swimming around i n  PSS
brains for a long while. The
program design has been
underway for close on two
years now; actual program-
ming commenced 9 months
ago and is now nearing its
conclusion. Mike Simpson,
its creator, is a 'Dungeons
and Dragons' 'expert' and a
highly co mp e te n t p r o -
grammer.
Gary Mays is very proud
of his new baby: "Everyone
who's seen it said 'You can't
do it' ".
"We've tried to make it
the ultimate mix of Arcade
and Adventure. It'll be the
game of the year".
Campbell MacCausland
continues: " I t  makes th e
Hobbit seem like Pacman".
"The problem we're go-
ing to have is making people
believe it's as good as i t
really is".
The product uses th e
unique M I D A S  ( M u l t i
Dimensional Animation
System) syste m w h i c h ,
amongst o th e r  facilities,
provides full 3-D animation,
which, PSS believe, makes it
as close as you can get to a
video disc game.
"Swords a n d  Sorcery'
(which should be available
mid-October) allows you to
develop your own unique
character a n d  t o  experi-
ence, in that guise, a series
of adventures through asso-
rted underground co rri -
dors. Should you tire of one
adventure, with the aid of a
set o f expansive modules,
you m a y  transfer y o u r
character to  another. PSS
also h o p e  t o  provide a
networked system on both
the Spectrum a n d  C o m-
modore b y  January, thus
adding e v e n  f u r t h e r
dimensions to the game.
They expect to develop a
cult fo l l o w i n g  th ro u g h
'Swords and Sorcery'.
(I don't believe I can do
justice t o  'Swords a n d
Sorcery' in the allotted time
and space but we hope to
review th i s revolutionary
game i n  a future issue o f
'Your Commodore' —  so
keep your eyes peeled!).

LAST MONTH I SAID ALL
my routines would sit bet-
ween lines 1000 and 2999.
The ﬁr s t r out ine  t ha t
you m us t d o  w i l l  b e
an e x c e ption t o  t his .
This is perhaps the most
important routine i t  is the
one whic h saves y our
program t o  disc giving
version numbers and main-
taining three ( o r  more)
backups. As you develop
your program, y ou will
undoubtedly save it  onto
more than one disc. You
may later ﬁnd yourself, with
two discs with the  same
program but one will be a
later version than the other
— so how do you ﬁnd out?
— wha t was t he  latest
change to that program? —
probably you changed part
of one line to ﬁx a bug but
which line? Another thing
to remember is that it is a
good idea t o  save your
program before running it.
The reason for this is that it is
s4rprisingly easy to get a
BASIC program t o  hang
the computer. Common
ways o f  this happening
include using POKE without
setting variables or using the
wrong ones. This will almost
certainly result in memory
location zero being POKEd
with a random number thus
repointing the 64's memon,
around a nd pageing out
UV BASIC (unless y o u  a r e
lucky). Finally there are
obvious advantages to hav-
ing three or more backups
available —disc corruptions
being the ﬁrst which spring
to mind!
DOING IT
YOURSELF
No to the code. I have put
it at the end of the program
so that it is out of the way.
The line before it starts is an
END instruction in case your
program does not  stop
before it gets to this routine.
The routine will keep a
version number at the start
of the BASIC program so the
start of your program will
look like this:
10 rem"Program or
System Name
20 rem"Version 00
Note that in line ten you
must have t h e  closing
quotes and the number of
characters between t h e
quotes exactly correct be-
cause we are going to be
alterinRthe version number
which must b e  a  ﬁxed
number of bytes from the
start of the program. There
must b e  3 2  characters
between the  quotes, O n
line 20, the positioning of
the version num be r  is
equally as important.
The routine checks t h a t
lines 10 and 20 have been
entered correctly and gets
the current version number

In line 60080, set f$ to your
program name (make it less
than 15 characters though as
the version number will be
added on to this). Line 60100
opens the error channel to
the disc and, if we are not up
to version ﬁve, jumps over
the next bit of code which
scratches the oldest version
from the disc. The current
version o n  disc is  then
renamed giv ing i t  t h e
existing version number
then the version number in
this program is altered and
this program is saved under
the name in f$.
If you type this program in
and keep f$ as "system".
then run 60000 ﬁve times
you will end up with the
latest version on the disc
being called "system" and
the backup versions called
"system02", "system03",
etc. so you know where

The subroutine at 61000
reads t he  error channel
from disc until a  carriage
return is reached, printing it
as it goes along. The reason
for doing it this way rather
than using inputf is that this
formats it neatly and it is
unnecessary to check the
value of the status except
after you have saved the ﬁle.
Deﬁning standard
strings and constants
At the start of your program
you will need some stand-
ard strings and constants
that you will often use in
your programs. You will of
course add all your own
ones to this brief list.

The above is quite self
explanatory but you may
wonder why line 1020 is
included. A carriage return
is often required when
printing to a printer or a disc
drive and it is a very useful
way of truncating data on

1
input. If used regularly, it is
quicker and easier to type
q$ than chr$(13). The quotes
fchr$(34) cannot b e  typed
into a  string s o  i f  i t  i s
required, you will have to
type chr$(34). Once again, it
is easier to type qu$ and far
more reliable then trying to
remember its code every-
time. Th e  last o n e , th e
escape code, may not be
needed. If, however, you
are talking to an RS232 de-
vice such as a printer then
the escape code is essential
as the listening device will
perform special functions
depending o n  t h e  data
received after the escape. I
have included i t for com-
pleteness and as a further
example of the kind of thing
you will ﬁnd useful to set up.
Key to success
No matter how fast, fanciful,
clever a n d  ﬂe x i b l e  a
program is, the major key to
its success is how pleasant
and easy to  use it is. This
entails making th e  infor-
mation on the screen and
printer appear i n  a  neat,
formatted style. I t  a l so
means that the input of the
data wants to  be safe and
friendly. The BASIC input
command i s  provided o f
course but it falls far short of
the necessary standards and
ﬂexibility required. It does
allow full screen editing but
does not trap any characters
such as home or dr home,
cursor up, cursor down and
so on. It is evident that we
need a  ﬂexible b u t safe
utility to do this. We need to
specify where on the screen
we want to input, how long
the ﬁeld is, what sort of data
is to be typed into this ﬁeld
and so on. After all, you do
not w a n t accidental k e y
pushes t o  c a u s e  t h e
program to crash or wrong
data t o  b e  entered. Fo r
example, if we were asking
for a  number, a n d  w e
accidentally t y p e  1e45
instead ol 145 (not unlikely
due to the proximity of the
keys) w e  w o u l d  g e t
?overﬂow error when using
the basic input command
Even i f we entered i t as a
string then took the val of it
we would g e t th e  same
error. This is more likely
than yo u  may think as I
know of one package which
when inputting data, took
the v a l  o f  every string
regardless a n d  t h e n
produced this error in the
middle of an address! This
was because the post code
was something like 5e4 5ds.
This subroutine will re-
quire several variables
passed to  it. You will ﬁnd
that you can easily improve
the ﬂexibility o f this sub-
routine to include your own
special function keys, You
could h a v e  o n e  w h i ch
aborts the whole screen or
takes you t o  the bottom
entry and so on but each of
these keys will have to be
tested for separately in your
code. Th i s  ro u ti n e  w i l l
require the starting position
across the screen to be in
ac%, the starting position
down the screen to  be in
do%, 1% will be the length
of the ﬁeld, ty% will be the
type o f the ﬁeld and the
default will be in df$. The
default is what was in the
ﬁeld before  y o u  started
editing. I f  creating some-
thing, then i t will be zero
blank most likely but, i f
amending something, i t
should contain the details
from the ﬁle. The type will
be one of the 3 below.
Routine A is quite straight-
toward but is very ﬂexible.
Once you are happy that
you understand i t ,  t r y
adding a  function which
clears everything t o  th e
right o f the cursor. At the
moment, the only way out
of the routine is to  press
return b u t we can acIfJ to
this. Y o u  m a y  u se  t h e
function keys as when they
are pressed you can test the
ASCII of them. I suggest you
make this routine return
another variable such as fk
to say if a function key has
been pressed a n d  i f  so,
which o n e  i t  is. D o  n o t
forget to  set fk to  zero if
return was pressed though.

Our business expert, David
Crisp, assesses some of the
latest business software
releases for the Commodore.
THIS MONTH I'VE BEEN FEEDING
my 64 with some fairly low-cost
software which aims to  help you
work o u t your business or home
ﬁnances. The ﬁrst one I tried was
Autocalc M from Richard Shepherd
Software. It costs 04.95 on cassette
and 119.95 on disc and is a low cost
spreadsheet. A fte r  loading y o u
are asked whether you are using
tape or disc. This is ﬁne to start with
but, after having to specify tape or
disc more than a couple of times, it
becomes very much a  chore. I f
you have never used a spreadsheet
before I feel that this one may put
you off them, A good spreadsheet is
an invaluable a i d  f o r  ﬁnancial
planning and ﬁnancial analysis but
they are unforgiving things and can
be very frustrating.
This spreadsheet does all th e
important things that spreadsheets
should do t h e  frustrating thing is,
how it does it. When moving from
one part o f the sheet to  another
there is a very disturbing screen
ﬂash which tires the eyes after a
while, and with a machine with the
capabilities of the 64 there are much
smoother ways o f  performing a
sideways screen scroll.
Perhaps the most disturbing thini
about it was when it crashed. I had
spent about an hour copying in a set
of information and calculations and
intentionally put i n  a  division by
zero. Instead of the expected error
message the whole thing crashed.
On trying again with less informat-
ion it performed correctly and then
on a third run it crashed again. Dis-
turbing.
There i s n o  printer interface
software built in and my software
would not run at the same time as
this and so I was unable to test the
printout facility. A lot of people now
have Centronics printers and this
program is limited to just a few of
Commodore's own and a couple of
others. U s e  o th e r s  a n d  y o u
invalidate the guarantee.
The new documentation is bare-
ly adequate for a spreadsheet prog-
ram and only describes the bare
82 b o n e s  o f  w h a t t o  d o .  I  g e t
the impression t h a t  everything
is being left to the demonstration
ﬁles.
I was very disappointed with this
program a n d  w i th  i t s  l a ck o f

RICHARD SHEPHERD SOFTWARE
a printout o n  a  good range o f
printers. I would say that it is only
really suitable for people who want
to ﬁddle with a spreadsheet. If you
really want a spreadsheet to use in
your business then I  recommend
that you spend a little more money
and g e t  something w i th  m o r e
potential. It is true however that it is
a low price program and because of
this I feel that it is reasonable value
for mo n e y. Shame a b o u t th e
crashes.
After a couple of hours on that
one I loaded up Figaro from Saxon
Computing. The blurb on the back
was mouthwatering and I  couldn't
wait to get it into the machine. I had
L

S  o f t w e  re
to restrain myself f r o m  diving
straight in and so left the computer
to spend an hour with the manual.
I'm glad I  d i d . The amount o f
information was incredible.
The program is a type of database.
It is intended t o  store numeric
information a n d  analyse i t  i n
different ways presenting ﬁn a l
output as a  list o f  comparative
information or in virtually any type
of graph yo u  care t o  mention.
Because o f the complexity of the
program I only had time to work on
the demo ﬁles provided —  and
these impressed me. I feel that this is
a program t h a t  c o u l d  p r o v e
invaluable to  any business where
cash projections, growth rates, sales
targets, and seasonal forecasting etc
is invaluable. I  have doubts as to
whether many small business users
would be able to  stretch i t to its
limits but if there are any ﬁnancial
wizards o u t there w h o  want t o
impress th e  boss then this is a
winner.
Now the bad news. It says that
high resolution p ri n to u ts a r e
possible using Commodore a n d
Centronics printers, I tried with a CP
80 and a Smith Corona TP1 and got
nothing. Both printers checked out
OK and work well with Superbase
and Easy Script e tc . We 'll b e
checking with Saxon t o  try and
discover why things did not work;
hope I will be able to tell you about
the printout facility in a later issue,
In an article like this i t is not
possible to  describe its potential
fully as it would need a whole article
of its own. That may be possible in
the future. In the meantime, if you
feel that this is something you may
be able to use, I recommend you
pop down to  the local computer
store and have a look. I think you
will be impressed. Damn shame
about the printout.
Next day now, and I have just
loaded up Purchase Ledger from
Kemp. I  use a  purchase ledger
program in my business and it was
my intention to run this in parallel
with my existing system. Somebody
who knows a lot about purchase
ledgers has written this program.
Unfortunately, they don't seem to
be totally effective programmers.
This had a lot of potential as all the
functions were there. I t  was let
down b y  its poor display, non-
existent error trapping and incon-
sistent inputs. Some parts o t the
program require you to input 'yes'
as a whole word, other times just 'y'
will do. On the main option page, if
you make an incorrect entry, up
scrolls the screen and eventually the
whole menu disappears until you
have to guess what the menu said.
During stages 01 the program, one
touch o f  the break key will halt
everything and typing in CONT only
works sometimes. CAN'T CONT-
INUE ERROR comes up 50% of the
time. Re-RUN and it's goodbye to
your data.
Kemp manuals are always quite
good but simply warning you not to
touch the CLR/HOME key and then
saying, i f you do, just reposition
the cursor, is not good enough in a
business program. That type of thing
should b e  e r r o r  trapped a n d
Run/Stop keys should be displayed.
It can be argued that a program like
this is easy to  tailor to your own
needs, but speciﬁc entry points can
be put into a program to enable you
to tailor a program.
Needless to say, I did not run this
in parallel  w i t h  m y  existing
ledger a s ,  i n  s h o r t ,  i t  w a s
just not up to the job. Sorry.
Ten Superbase Stepping Stones
piled in front of me. Great I thought
as I  am a  Superbase fanatic. The
programs can only b e  ru n  with
Superbase and the titles I had for
review were as follows:
Club Records
Estate Agents
Job Costing
Purchase Day Book
Cash Book
Accountants Time Recording
Solicitors Time Recording
Stock Records
Travel Agents
Sales Day Book
Some of these I would not know
enough about to give a valid review
so I  will only be able to  give an
overview of what they were about. It
must be pointed out that these are
just stepping stones. They are not
complete applications. Each o n e
consists of ready formatted records
and pre-written report layouts. This
means that the easy bit is done t h e
hard part, which is linking it up to an
actual Superbase program, is not. To
be fair, i t is possible to use them
from a  me n u  and so  they are
ready t o  g o  i n  that respect b u t
it i s  a  long winded way t o  g o
about i t .  T h e y  a r e  excellent
for showing t h e  potential o f
Superbases a n d  c a n  easily b e
modiﬁed but, as I say, i t is not a
complete and fully running inter-
linked application.
To pick one out and show the sort
of thing they do was a hard job but in
the end I went to the Club Record
Controller. This I feel is one that
most people may be able to use. The
ﬁles set up are orientated towards
the sports type of club not the stamp
collector type b u t this could b e
modiﬁed. It will produce a members
list, overdue fees, equipment on
hire, what each person's particular
interests are, all the things in fact
that a club secretary would need to
know.
If you have or indeed are thinking
of b u yi n g  Superbase (which I
recommend) and are going to use it
for a n  application f o r  which a
Stepping Stone is available then it
would be a good buy. It would take a
lot of the groundwork out of writing
the ﬁnished article a n d  w o u l d
probably point out some little things
that are easily forgotten. Docu-
mentation with the Stepping Stones
is non-existent but you can print out
the HELP pages to produce a fairly
comprehensive D I Y  instruction
manual. All in all for the money they
cost they are a good buy and they
are something which I shall use in
the future. NICE WORK.
Back to Richard Shepherd and his
Cash Controller. Basically this is a
home budgeting system which
performs quite well. You put in the
amount you intend to  spend o n
such things as phone etc etc and, as
time goes on, it works out for you if
you are under or over budget. (My
bank manager usually does that
anyway). With this you can also keep
track of your bank account and it
will ta k e  i n t o  consideration
standing orders, e tc , a n d  w i l l
produce a statement on demand. To
me th e  most useful part was a
loan/mortagage calculator. I  cert-
ainly learned a thing or two on that
part. If a particular company gives
you a quote for credit it will work
Out a fourth variable from three you
must enter, e g , i f  yo u  borrow
0000.000 for 12 months at 21% APR
it will tell you how much you must
actually of b a c k .  Quite shocking
some o f  them. A  home budget
program would not be for me but I
am sure the loan/mortgage calcula-
tor will save m e  more than the
program costs. If you are looking for
this type of program then I feel that
you could not go far wrong with this
one.

The SX64, a portable
version of the W e
Commodore 64, has .
been freely available
for over six months and
seems to have
established a
solid base. David Crisp
weighs up the pros and
cons of Commodore's
portable micro.
The Commodore SX64 is a
Business/Home m i c r o
which has a  built i n  5 "
colour monitor and a built
in 1541 single disc drive. The
DX64 was intended to be a
dual dr iv e  version b u t
according to Commodore it
will not now be released. I
am led to believe that over-
heating of the second drive
is t h e  reason f o r  this.
However, an ordinary 1541
drive can still be connected
up through the serial port. It
comes with some free soft-
ware which I will deal with
later and a manual which is a
rehashed version o f  t he
regular 64 book with parts of
the 1 5 4 1   dis c  d r i v e
handbook mashed in. As
with m os t Commodore
documentation, this is  a
disaster and in many places
totally inaccurate. Some
work has been pout into
correcting errors that were
contained i n  or igina l
manuals but just as many
new mistakes seem to have
crept in.
The SX64 looks good. It is
dark grey and some thought
seems to have been put into
making i t  aesthetically
pleasing. There is a  very
thick, robust handle which
makes carrying the moder-
ately heavy machine much
E
parts on which to catch your
legs. T h e  fr ont o f  t he
machine, whe n opened,
reveals a  slightly smaller
keyboard than the normal
64 with dished white keys
with the graphics symbols
THE
1 6 4
REVIEWED
clearly m a r k e d .  T h e
keyboard ha s  a  slightly
empty feel but over all is
comfortable in use although
it is quite noisy. The key-
board section is very light
and due to that mine has
crashed t o  the  ﬂoor on
many occasions pulling its
lead from the socket but so
far it  shows no signs of
damage. The  lead which
connects the keyboard to
the m a c hine  c a n  b e
detached but I ﬁnd it does
not get in the way even
when it is carried around so
I leave mine in place all the
time.
What a view
On the left of the machine is
the ﬁv e  inc h monitor.
Despite being so small the
picture is surprisingly clear
and I  have n o  trouble
reading text providing there
is good colour separation.
There is slight pin cushion
distortion at the edges of
the screen but not enough
to have any detrimental
effect on clarity. The bright-
ness, contrast, c olour ,
vertical hold and volume
controls are under a small
panel on the right of the
machine. They are a little
ﬁddly but, once set, they do
not waver far, so are quite
adequate. I  once read a
review where the  writer
complained that there was
no tuning control but on a
colour monitor a tuner is
not required as there is
no DRIFT as on a normal TV
set. Also, hiding behind this
ﬂap is a reset button. This is
not a  reset button as on
most machines; i t  serves
only to reset the disc drive
in case of foul up. If you
have a  s e c ond d r i v e
plugged in and the device
number ha s  b e e n  s e t
through software, pressing
the reset button will mean
that the drive goes back to
device 8. A  nuisance if in
the middle of a program.
The disc drive i s  very

than the normal 1541 drive
and, t o  m y  mind, much
quieter as well but alas still
as painfully slow. Still at the
front end, the most obvious
thing is the large black hole
just above the drive. In the
original this was meant to
house the second drive but
is n o w  designated a s  a
storage slot. Commodore
say in the manual that it is
not advisable to store discs
in the slot; they d o  n o t
suggest what you can store
in there and so  th e  slot
remains relatively useless.
Cigarettes and matches live
in mine. Seriously I  have
always kept my discs in the
slot and although I would
not say this is a safe practice,
so far I have lost no data.
Suggestions please on what
an be kept in this slot.
Weighty problem
This is a portable machine
but as I  have said i t  i s
reasonably heavy. Unfor-
tunately it cannot be used
on a train or in a car etc, as it
is dependent o n  a  240 V
sufﬁx a l l  L OA D /S A V E
commands w i t h  ' ,8 ' . I f
you attempt t o  use tape.
eg w i t h  L O A D  " p r o g -
name" t h e n  you get the
response 'ILLEGAL DEVICE
NUMI3ER'. Many people say
that y o u  d o  n o t  n e e d
tape on a business mach-
ine, b u t i t  i s  often fo r -
gotten t h a t  th i s  i s  n o t
only a  business machine
and anyway hasn't anybody
heard of executive games?
As time goes on though and
more and more software is
being released on disc, the
lack of a tape port is getting
less and less of a nuisance.
The compiler fo r  th e
Commodore 64 will not run
on the SX64 and as far as I
know t h i s  i s  t h e  o n l y
program that will not. I f
anybody knows o f  other
programs that will not run
please write in and say as it
may be possible to print a
list of those programs and so
save other SX users time and
money.
In/Out.
On the top of the machine is
the cartridge port. This is a
nice place to have it as it is
easy to see and easy to get
at. No fumbling at the back
of the machine trying to pull
out International Football
only to ﬁnd you have also
pulled out the disc drive, TV
lead a n d  p ri n te r. I t  i s
difﬁcult not to notice that a
cartridge has been left in
but should you leave one in
and carry the machine then
you are likely t o  take a
reasonable sized chunk out
of your knee. At the back of
mains power supply so it is t  he m a c h i n e  a r e  t w o
only portable in the sense joystick ports. These are for
that i t can be taken from games and, I presume, the
place to place, but not used MOUSE when, and if, it is
on th e  way. In  use i t is released. Close by also at
identical to  the Commod- the back is the serial socket.
ore 6 4  except w h e n  i t  It is possible to plug in either
comes to  tape use. There a  second disc drive here or a
is n o  facility a t  a l l  t o  printer. I have heard some
use tape: in fact the routines people say that you can only
that handle tape i n  th e  have o n e  o r  t h e  o th e r
ROM have been savagely attached at once but if you
torn o u t. I  say savagely h a ve  a  s e c o n d  d r i v e
because that is all that was plugged i n  then you can
done. It would have been plug th e  printer into th
sensible w h e n  removing second drive, a  proces
tape functions fr o m  t h e  known as DAISY CHAIN-
ROM t o  have made a l l  INC. Th e re  i s  also t h e
commands default t o  the versatile USER PORT into
drive. This wasn't done and which y o u  ca n  p l u g  a l l
so i t i s still necessary to  manner o f things. Centro-

nics printers, IEEE interfaces,
in the U.S.A. even a poly-
graph ( l i e  detector), I
believe. The mains socket is
also here and ﬁnally the
audio/video socket. This
last one is very important. It
has be e n written tha t,
because t h e r e  i s  n o
modulated TV out socket,
it is not possible to plug
your SX64 into anything but
a Composite m onitor .
Almost true. For those of
you who are lucky enough
o have an SX64 and a Video
recorder then here is what
you do. Your video recorder
has probably got an aux.vid
in socket. Simply take the
video signal from the socket
of the 64 into the recorder
switch from tuner to AUX
and he y  presto! a  2 6 "
picture. The other advan-
tage of this is the fact that
the socket on the recorder is
usually at the front of the
machine and so there is no
swapping of leads behind
the television required.
With the SX64 the great
thing is the  lack o f  the
spaghetti of wires connect-
ing drives t o  computer,
printer to drives etc. This
means that you can usually
get g o i n g  b y  s im ply
connecting the mains and
turning on the power with
the large easy to ﬁnd, diff-
icult t o  h i t  accidentally,
I C
88 I n  use...
The SX64 is a pleasure to use.
Everything is easy to get at
and the screen can be tilted
up by using the carrying
handle. Because everything
is compact there is plenty of
room on a computer desk
for printers, second drives,
books etc and, because the
keyboard is remote, it is easy
to push it to one side while
making notes or  reading
manuals and so on. I use my
machine almost every day to
program, t o  review soft-
ware, and also to run my
business.
From a  programming
point of view the BASIC is a
little dated, There is no easy

way to program sound and
graphics without using a lot
of POKE commands. This is a
nuisance but with the many
utility- programs the s e
features become easy t o
use. Sound and graphics on
the 64s are excellent. The
SID chip controls sound and
it is a chip that many synthe-
sisers would be  proud to
have. There are four sound
channels including white
noise a n d  these a llow
stunning sound effects and
tunes. T h e  graphics a r e
really something, if you get
a chance look at Interna-
tional Football: that should
show y o u  h o w  m uc h
potential there is in the 645.
There are a  lack of  disc
handling commands a nd
loading a directory of a disc
wipes out anything you may
have in memory (if not using
special routines which add
disc commands). Channels
have t o  be  opened and
closed m a nua lly  a n d ,
although t h i s  m a k e s
programming a  little long
winded, I feel that at least I
can take a BASIC program
and l o a d  i t  i n t o  m y
Commodore 8096 without
needing to modify it. There
are prices to be paid for
compatibility but I feel that
some things are worth the
sacriﬁce. Look how much
the Electron had to sacriﬁce
to be compatible with the
BBC B and eat your hearts
out all the  Spectrum/QL
owners, (does QL stand for
Quite Late). There is not 64K
of user RAM on the  64
although there is a  good
chunk of it available. Some
extra RAM is also available
for machine code routines
which is not available for
BASIC programs. Because
Commodore peripherals
are intelligent you will ﬁnd
that, when you plug in a disc
drive for instance, no great
chunks of RAM are used up
to control it. Each 1541 drive
has its own on board RAM
and a 6502 processor to run
it. In the 64 there is what is
known as a kernal and this is
a boon to machine code
programmers; there is not
room i n  this review t o
describe i t  fully b u t  i n
simple terms it is a jump
table which allows some
compatibility be twe e n
machines whe n writing
code routines which need
to jump to speciﬁed ROM
routines.
If you are thinking about
getting a 64 and a portable
machine would be of use to
you t he n I  would n o t
hesitate in suggesting that
you have a good look at the
SX64. It has got its faults but
over all I feel Commodore
did a  g o o d  j o b  a n d ,
although it is expensive for
what it is, I would not be
without mine.

leaving messages o n  th e
answerphone and talking to
nice ladies, I still have not
got EASYSCRIPT o r EASY-
FILE (Please Commodore?).
I have got the boxes and the
documentation, I only lack
the programs. The software
that I have been able to look
at can only be described as
fair but as it is free I am not
moaning. High Flyer is a low
level business simulation
where you have to run your
own aircraft business and
the compendium of games
contains half a dozen games
that are being sold o ff in
their magazine as cheapies.
The demo disc I like. Apart
from some awful spelling
mistakes the demos are very
good a n d  I ' m  l o o ki n g
forward to Christmas when I
can have the all singing and

running 2 4  hours a  day.
Finally, there is a cloth bag
with a large velcro pad in
which you can store odds
and ends such as manuals
leads and ﬂoppies. It is big
enough to hold 2 standard
sized disc boxes and is a very
useful thing. A nice touch.

- the sophisticated spreadsheet
Easy to learn, easy to use - something that can't be said of many business programs.
But it's true of all the programs in the BUSICALC series,
BUSICALC 3 can handle all sorts of jobs - budgets, expenditure analysis, stock lists,
price lists, and product costing are just a few of the possibilities. Three-dimensional
formulae automatically access data stored on disk, so that you can easily pull
together information from several different sheets and summarise or manipulate it.
It's simple to transfer data to other programs such as Easy Script. And you can use
virtually any printer with BUSICALC 3, whether dot matrix or daisy wheel,
Commodore or non-Commodore.
For the CBM 64 and PET/CBM 4000 & 8000 series.
