SECURITY CONFIGURATION
AND PATCH MANAGEMENT
USING CHATGPT
Vulnerabilities are a persistent threat in the
cybersecurity 
landscape, 
and 
unpatched
vulnerabilities 
represent 
significant 
security
risks.
Prioritizing patches based on factors like risk
assessment, 
CVSS 
scores, 
and 
potential
exploitability is essential for effective patch
management. 
ChatGPT can serve as a proactive sentinel for
your 
system 
configurations, 
continuously
monitoring for deviations from secure baselines.
