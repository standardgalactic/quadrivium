Ariolasoit goes wild
Soft In The Head
THERE'S A VERITABLE EPIDEMIC OF NEW
software in the shops at the moment, so
let's go on with the news straight away.
Remember t h e  Alamo? Ariolasoft
does. The latest game from this proliﬁc
software house is called Wild West and
has all the traditional features of a classic
John Wayne movie. Big Nose Bill and his
boys have captured Fort Snake and you're
the hero who has to liberate this outpost.
On your quest you'll encounter such
well-tried western hazards as a bank
robber, a shoot-out with the sherrif and a
wild stagecoach ride. It's for the C64 and is
available o n  cassette (19.951 o r  disk
1E12.951.
DATA
STATEMENTS
If you'd prefer something a little more
cultural, why not take a look at Global
Software's Old Scores. It's an adventure
set around London's South Bank arts
complex and features The Dice Waltz
(one of Mozart's little gems. There's also
a voucher in each game which entitles the
purchaser to a free guided tour backstage
at the Royal Festival Hall.
Now on to a different track with the
computer version o f  Scalextric fr om
Leisure Genius. Produced under licence
from Hornby Hobbies the game incorp-
orates many of the features of the popular
Scalextric sets. You can design your own
tracks using straights, curves and chicanes
and each player has a 3D view of the track
ahead as well as a plan of the whole
4
"-gq'T:Sir
circuit. It's for the C64 and costs i9.95 on
cassette.
Martech has also been looking around
the toyshops to ﬁnd an idea for its latest
release. The game is called Zoidzilla and is
based around Tomy's range of Zoids.
You'll ﬁnd yourself on Zoidstar in the
middle of a war between Blue Zoids and
Red Zoids, Zoidzilla, the blue leader, has
been smashed into eight pieces all of
which are scattered behind enemy lines.
You're the unfortunate little Zoid who has
to go and retreive them. Look out for Red
Horn, leader o f  t h e  enemy forces!
Zoidzilla costs f8.95 on the C64.
Virgin has brought out a follow up to
Now Games - appropriately called Now
Games 2. This tape contains such popular

titles as Airwolf from Elite Systems, Tir Na
Nog from Gargoyle Games, Cauldron
from Palace Software, Chuckle Egg 2 from
A&F and World Cup from Artic. You can
get the lot for 18.95.
As reviewed in Your Commodore
(February 1986), you can now purchase
Rainbird's The Music System. According
to Rainbird, there's nothing like i t
whether you're Heaven 17 or a two ﬁnger
pianist its out now on cassette (114.95)
and disk 1117.95).
If you're one of those people who's
always talking about life, the universe and
everything, then you'll be happy to know
that you can now play The Hitchhikers
guide to the galaxy in the safety of your
home, courtesy of SDftsel. This is only one
of the games in a new range of Infocom
Classic Titles. The other four are Zork 1.
Seastalker, Planetfall and Deadline. The
prices of the games have also been
reduced so you can hitch around the
Milky Way for a mere 124.95 or try any of
the others for only 119.95.
If you enjoyed Hewson Consultants
Paradroid then you'll be pleased to here
that a sequel is at this moment winging its
inexorable way t o  your local shops.
Named Uridium the game is a fast arcade
style shoot-em-up. It will be available at
the end of February and there is also a plot
afoot to put both games on disk.
US Gold is still producing new titles
like there's no tomorrow. And there's
good news for C-16 and Plus/4 owners.
For 17.95 you can now buy yourselves a
copy of Beach Head.
Tony Rainktird makes music
Level 9 has added a third title to its
Silicon Dream series -  The Worm in
Paradise. The two previous games in the
trilogy were Snowball and Return to Eden,

Fed up with playing other peoples
games? Perhaps Activision has the answer
to your problem. You can now buy
Gamemaker: T h e  Computer Game
Design Kit. Using a joystick you can select
commands from a menu to produce and
animate characters, draw backgrounds,
create sound effects and compose
musical scores. The cassette costs £9.99
and the disk version is 114.99 including a
free blank disk to save your games on,
Supersoft has also come up with a
helpful program for the creative bods
among you. Flowcharter is a machine
language program ,which will display or
print a Basic program after it has been
written. When something goes wrong
with your latest program all you need to
do is call up a ﬂowchart and you'll be able
to see what your program is doing. It's
112.95 on tape and 114.95 on disk and it's
Out now.
Mastertronic, the UK budget software
house, has launched itself into t he
business world with a word processing
package called Ski Writer, The package
was originally released in the USA by
Prentice Hall but now world rights have
been jointly acquired by Mastertronic
Limited (UK) and Mastertronic Inter-
national In c (USA). It's available o n
cassette and disk at 11195 and 114.95
respectively. A  special version for the
C128 is on the cards and will be released
shortly. It is hoped that it will use all the
extra capabilities of the C128.
Back into space we go to look at CRL's
latest game, the title of which is probably a
1

candidate for the most terrible pun of
1986 -  Space Doubt. Loosely, the plot
features the USS Omnibus, transporting a
cargo of food to the hungry workers on
Planet Nibiondis, Of course you run into
trouble but ﬁnd out more by spending
17.95.
Time to spin off to the fairground and
have a look at an offering from Inter-
ceptor Micros. Wild Ride, a new arcade
game for  the C64, features a crazed
bomber in t e n t  o n  destroying t h e
rollercoaster i n  a n  amusement park.
Luckily, you - in your alternative persona
of a clown - are available to run along the
tracks and detonate the bombs. If you
want to endanger you life and your circus
career, it will cost you 16.95,

ARE YOU ONE OF THOSE PEOPLE WITH
a Commodore PET tucked awy in a cup-
board? Now, thanks to Supersoft, it could
be in for a new lease of life. The Supersoft
RAM PLUS boards allow any machine to
be upgraded to a full 32K - the most that
Basic will recognise. For 135 the RAM
PLUS 16 will upgrade a 16K PET and the
RAM PLUS 2 4  upgrades any  large
keyboard machine from 8K to 32K at a cost
of f  60.
The oldest 8K PETs with calculator style
keys and built-in cassette decks are also
catered for, They need a special board,
the RAM PLUS 245 which is also priced
at 160.
Not satisﬁed with this, Supersoft has
also produced the BASIC 2+4 Board which
allows any 40 column PET to run both
Basic 2 and Basic 4. And, lastly, there's the
RAM/ROM board, a  ROM/EPROM
emulator with 8K of battery backed up
RAM. Both of these are 165.
If you have ever experienced supply
problems caused by interference trans-
mitted via the mains supply, then you may
be interested in  Conblock electrical's
Smoothline Connector.
The unit provides four ﬁltered outlets
(each rated at six amps maximum) from
one 13 amps mains socket. It comes
complete with a mains lead and plug and
is ﬁtted with four miniature plugs for
wiring to the computer equipment.
Interference can be caused by other
home appliances being switched on or off
either manually or automatically. This can
result in data being corrupted. According
to Conblock, Smoothline is  the ﬁrst
serious attempt t o  eliminate these
problems.
Plugged in with Duraplug
Duraplug Electricals is also trying to
minimise y o u r  h o m e  c omput ing
problems with the latest version of its four
way socket outlets. The new Duraline
range comprises two models: the non-
fused 4135 and the fused 4136. New
features include a rocker on/off switch, a
neon mains on indicator and a removable
terminal cover for easy wiring. They cost
around 110 and ar e available fr om
electrical stores.
Trilogic is launching itself into the
C128 hardware market with its Vidcon 1,2
and 3 products. The Vidcon 1 allows any
monitor or TV to display the 80 column
output of the C128 in any of the 16 avail-
able colours. It costs 159.95. The Vidcon
2 (149,95) is similar but cannot be used
with a standard TV and the Vidcon 3 is a
monochrome version of Vidcon 1 and
costs 129.95.
Robcom -  now renamed Robotek -
has also started catering for the C128 user.
Two new products have recently been
launched. The ﬁrst allows you to use both
40 and 80 columns on a C128 on a normal
composite monitor. The second is an asset
for avid games players. Game Killer turns
off sprite protection so that you can't be
killed in any game you play. Both retail at
114.95.

More music from your
C64 with this superb
program from Tony
Crowther.
IF YO U  WO ULD LIKE T O
become a budding composer
or simply get your C64 to play
music as good as that on com-
mercial games t hen Mus ic
Master is what you need. In fact
I have used this program, and
some earlier versions, to enter
music into many of my own
programs, so that should give
you an idea of its versatility.
The m a i n  differ enc es
between Music Master and
many o f  t he other  'Music
Editor' programs -  available
either through magazines or
commercially - are that:
1) Music is entered in the form
of easy to understand DATA
statements.
2) Music to be played is stored
in memory as  code and a
machine code play routine will
play the music without inter-
fering with other programs.
You m a y  t h in k  t h a t  a
program which has t o  read
music from DATA statements
would be very slow but that's
not so. Music Master will read
around 200 musical statements
per second and set it up in
memory ready to be played by
the routine mentioned in 2)
above. Another important fact
to remember is that. once the
music has been transferred from
DATA s t a t e m e n t s  i n t o
memory. y ou c an save the
block of music to disk or tape
using a machine code monitor
and you will not have to go
through the DATA statements
again. But more of this later.
Program Format
As I've already mentioned, all
music is entered in the form of
DATA statements. The DATA
statements ar e broken int o
three sections: Data for Voice
one, Data for Voice two and
Data for Voice three. Music
Master expects t o  ﬁnd the
music data for each of the C64's
available v oic es  a t  t h e
following lines:
3000 DATA for voice one.
5000 DATA for voice two.
7000 DATA for voice three.
In order that Music Master
knows w her e eac h v oic e
ﬁnishes, each should end with
a special number. These are, -1,
-2, -3 for voices 1, 2 and 3 re-
spectively. When working with
Music Master, I usually set up
the program as follows so that I
don't forget the '-' number. If
you d o  then t h e  program
would probably stop working.
3000 DATA. voice 1 data.
4999 DATA-1
5000 DATA.voice 2 data.
6999 DATA-2
7000 DATA. voice 3 data.
0999 DATA-3
10
111101001111110111111110111010100001
NOTE. As in the above illust-
ration you must not put any
spaces after the word DATA. If
you do then the program will
not work properly.
Available Commands
A large number of commands
are av ailable w i t h  Mus ic
Master. Each one will effect
certain registers i n  the SID
chip. This is the device that
allows your C64 to play music.
Normally you would have to
POKE values i n t o  c er tain
registers of the SID chip but
Music Master will do this for
you, and do it very quickly. It is
therefore possible to change
parameters w h ile  music is
playing. Figure 1 lists the avail-
able c ommands  a n d  t h e
registers which they effect.
I w i l l  n o w  explain t h e
available commands.
•
Tempo
'-T' is the command used to set
the speed at which music is
played. After the '-T' there are
three digits which indicate the
speed, these range from 001 to
255. For example •-T003' would
set the tempo to three. There
must always be three digits
after the '-T'.
The m or e  technical
amongst you may be interested
to note that a value of •-T001'
would cause a  note t o  b e
played every 1/50th o f  a
second. A  speed o f  4002
would therefore cause a note
to be played every 1/25th of a
second. Memor y  loc ation
53247 is a ﬁne tune for the
speed. It is normally set to 255
but POKEing it with different
values will speed the tempo of
the music up.
Volume
•-4' is used to set the overall
volume of the music. This can

range from 000 t o 015. The
command - 4015 s ets  t h e
volume to maximum. I f  you
were to use numbers greater
than 0015 then you would start
to bring in some of the SID chip
ﬁlters. This is  because t he
register which is altered by this
command is also used to hold
titter information. I'll deal with
ﬁlters in more detail later.

Waveform
Each voice must have a wave
form set for it. The following
commands are used to choose
the type o f  wave for  each
voice:
-6000 - No sound
-6017 - Triangle
-6033 - Sawtooth
-6065 - Pulse
-6081 - Triangle and pulse
-6129 - White Noise
When y ou are using the
pulse waveform then the pulse
width mus t  b e  s et. T w o
commands are used to do this -
'-7' and •-8'. Again three digits
must b e entered after each
number. Use •-7' to set the high
byte of the pulse width and '-8'
to s et t h e  lo w  by te. T he
commands have the following
ranges:
-7000 to -7015 (high byte).
-800 to -8255 (low byte).
Envelopes
Not only  must you set the
waveform type for each voice
but y ou mus t also set the
envelope. T h e  envelope is
more commonly known as the
ADSR or Attack. Decay, Sustain
and Release. The command
—5xyz is used to set the attack
and decay while the command
-9xyz is used to set the sustain
arid r eleas e. T hes e t w o
commands alter the usual bit
patterns associated with the
ADSR settings. Each o f  the
parameters can have a value
between zero and 15. However
since each command operates
on two parameters the actual
•
numbers to use are a little com-
plicated to work out.
Firstly you will need to ﬁnd
the corresponding value of a
parameter i n  binar y . F o r
example, a setting of 15 would
have the binary pattern 1111
and one of nine would have the
pattern 1001.
Now let's take a look at the
'-5' command in more detail. If
we were to break down the
number following the '-5' into
binary then the number would
have eight is i.e.11111111. The
ﬁrst four  i s  represent t h e
Attack and the last four the
decay. If we therefore wanted
an attack of 15 and a decay of
11
nine the number would have
the following form:
11111001
Now w e  c an convert this
number to decimal as each 1
has a n  equivalent decimal
number depending o n  it s
position. This involves adding
these numbers up to ﬁnd the
number that has to follow the
5. Eac h pos ition has  t h e
following values:
ATTACK
128 6 4  3 2  1 6
Therefore an attack of 15 and
decay of nine would have a
value of:
128+64+32+16+8+1 or 249
Don't forget though that if
the number is less than 100 it
must still have three digits.
As mentioned before the
command '-9' is used to set the
sustain and release. This is
worked out as for  t he '-5'
command; the ﬁrst four is are
DECAY
8 
4

the sustain and the lower four
are the release. For example a
sustain of 3 and release of 5
would hav e t h e  following
patterns:

0011 0101 in binary or
32+16+4+1 = 53 in decimal.
Therefore the command would
be -9053.
This may sound compli-
cated but once you start to use
the commands you will soon
ﬁnd it very easy to work out the
values to follow them.
Special Effects
A number of special effects are
available with Music Master,
these help to make the notes
played sound a  little more
interesting.
Oscillators
•-W' will oscillate any notes
being played. T o  us e this
command enter:
-W1 to turn it on and
-WO to turn it off.
'-X' w ill alter t he pulse
width o f  any  notes being
played that have a pulse wave-
form. T h e  format f o r  t h e
command is:
-X1 on
-X0 off
is a  rather special
command as it will alter the
waveform of any notes while
they are playing. This allows for
some very interesting effects.
The c o m m a n d  h a s  t h e
following formats.
-Y1 change t o  Pulse while
playing
-Y2 change to Sawtooth
-Y3 change to Triangle
-Y4 change to Noise
-Y0 turn command off.
Filters
As mentioned earlier, i t  is
possible t o  alter t h e  ﬁlter
settings of the SID chip withthe
'-4' command. I'm afraid that
we will have to go back to using
binary again to show you how
this command works. First let's
have a look at what each does.
From t h e  above table y ou
should be able to see why the
volume can only go up to 15, As
an example, let's set a band
pass ﬁlter with a volume of
three. The binary pattern for
this would be:
001 000
If you refer to the above table
you will see that this is 36 so the
command to set up the values
would be
4036.
*-Jxyz' is used to set the ﬁlter
cut off frequency low byte. This
has a range from 000 to 007.
'-Kxyz' is used t o set the
high byte of the Cut off fre-
quency and has a range from
000 to 255.
'-H' is used to set the ﬁlter
resonance and again requires
you to use binary numbers. The
number has  t h e  following
format:
12
Look It Up
Many of the above commands
seem v e r y  c omplic ated.
Obviously we can't go into how
to use the SID chip in this
article as it would take a whole
series. It however you wish to
take a closer look at exactly
what the above commands do
then take a look in the C64 user
guide a n d  t h e  Reference
guide.
Note Format
Notes are extremely easy to
enter into the data. Each note
takes the form 'Octave Note
Length'.
The Octave ranges from
zero t o  seven. Zero is  the
lowest.
The Note has the corres-
ponding letter i.e. A B DCEF
and G.
Length is between zero and
99 and is the duration of time
that the note plays.
In or der  t o  double the
length of a note it is necessary
to double the duration Le. a
note length four is twice as long
as a note of length two and half
as long as a note of length
eight.
If y ou want t o  work  in
musical terms I usually ﬁnd it
best to give a crotchet a length
of eight_ This means that a
quaver has a length of four and
a minim has a length of 16. If
you require a dotted note then
the length of this is half way

between c omplete notes .
Therefore if a crotchet is length
eight then a dotted crotchet
has a length of 12 i.e. halfway
between eight and 16, Figure 2
should make this a little clearer.
Figure 3  shows which notes
correspond to which octave.
Sharps and Flats
If you wish to use sharps then
you preﬁx the note name with a
' # 'sign e.g. 4 CO. Flats are not
needed as a ﬂat always has an
equivalent sharp. For example
B ﬂat is the same as A sharp.

Now that we have covered all
of the available commands we
can get down to writing some
music,
As I  h a v e  pr ev ious ly
mentioned, the music data is
broken in t o  three sections.
Before we enter any musical
data into any section some
items must b e  set t o  their
default values. If you keep to
the following rules then you
should have no problems. Let's
take each important line in turn
Line .3000 should always
have the following form:
3000 DATA-4xyz, -Txyz, -Hxyz,
-1xyz, -Kxyz
where xyz is  a  three digit
number. This line sets up the
initial Volume, Tempo and
Filter settings. If you are not
using any ﬁlters then xyz for -It.
and -K should be 000. Do not
miss this out or you could get
some strange results.
Lines 3001, 5000 and 7000
should tak e t h e  following
form:
3001 DATA-6xyz, -5xyz,-9xyz,-
7xyz
This will set up the Waveform
and ADSR for each voice, The '-
7' command should only be
added if you are using the pulse
waveform.
If any voices are not being
used then they  should b e
either be padded with rests or
their waveforms padded out
with rests,
N.B. Music will repeat as soon
as Voice 1 has ﬁnished playing.
Examining Ex ample 1
should make things a  little
clearer. Voices 2 and three are
not used at all and Voice 1 plays
a simple musical Scale.
Playing Music
Once you have entered all the
music, make sure you save it
before attempting to play it. If
you d o n ' t  a n d  y o u  hav e
entered something wrong then
you could lose your work.
Before running any music,
Music Master should be loaded
into memory with
LOAD "MUSIC MASTER'',8 for
disk or .1 for tape.
Music Master c an b e in
memory while you are entering
a program as it will not conﬂict
with any Basic program.
Then make sure that your
Music Data is loaded and type:
SYS 49152
This will cause the music
data to be read into memory
from location 25600 onwards.
To play  t h e  music y ou
simply hav e t o  enter  t h e
command:
SYS 52000
the music will then start playing
until y o u  s t o p  i t  w i t h
RUN/STOP and RESTORE.
The SYS 49152 and SYS 52000
can be part of any normal Basic
program as long as you don't
use any lines that are needed
by the music data.
Once the music data has
been moved into memory the
Basic Data is no longer needed
so you could even load in other
programs and the music will
continue as long as the other
program doesn't use the same
memory o r  r edir ec t t h e
interrupts.
Once the music data is in
memory it is a simple matter to
SAVE t h e  D AT A a n d  t h e
Running pr ogr am w i t h  a
machine code monitor, The
Running program lies  fr om
location 52000 t o  location
53244.
The Music data starts at
location 25600 and the length
can be found by entering the
13
following line lithe Basic Data
is present.
FORI=0T099999:READ A $ :
NEXT
When the program returns
with an Out of Data' error then
type;
PRINT 1
the result is the length of the
data in memory.
Playing Around
One small feature of  Music
Master is an in-built 'Organ'.
Simply POKE location 5076 with
the Octave in which you want
to play and type:
SYS 49890
A picture of a keyboard will
appear o n  screen a n d  b y
pressing the keys indicated you
will be able to play music.
Getting It All In
There are three parts to Music
Master, MASTER LOAD is a
loader for the program which
displays a  reminder o f  t he
instructions. MASTER DATA 1
and MASTER DATA2 are used
to enter the machine code for
Music Mas ter  i n t o  y o u r
machine.
Type in and SAVE all three
programs separately. If using
cassette then SAVE MASTER
LOAD on a separate cassette to
the other two programs.
Once all programs have
been entered a n d  SAVk l.
LOAD in MASTER DATA1 and
RUN. Once the program has
ﬁnished L O A D  MAST ER
DATA2 and RUN. If you are
using cassette p la c e  t h e
cassette containing MASTER
LOAD in the data recorder and
make sure that it is positioned
at the end of this program. Now
type in the following:
POKE4 3.00 : P O K  E4 4,1 9 2
tP0KE45,00 :POKE46.208
Now type:
SAVE "MUSIC MAST ER
for disk or
SAVE "MUSIC MASTER".1,1
for tape.
You s hould n o w  hav e a
work ing v er s ion o f  t  he
program and should only need
to LO AD  'MASTER LO AD'
whenever you want to use the
program in future.

THERE AR E T W O  OTHER
GRAPHICS modes available on
the Commodore-16 in addition
to those described in the User
manual. These ar e M u lt i-
Colour Character mode and
Extended Background Colour
mode.
Multi-Colour
Character Mode
As well as being available in
high resolution, Multi-colour
mode can also be made to work
in low-res. Bit four of address
65287 (SFF07) contains t h e
'Multi-Colour mode select bit'.
It is important to make sure,
however, that the other Bits at
this address remain unaltered.
To turn Multi-Colour mode on
in-low resolution:
POKE 65287,PEEK (65287)OR 16
To turn Multi-Colour mode off
in low resolution:
POKE 65287,PEEK (65287) and
239
Why u s e  Multi- Colour
Character M o d e ?  W h e n
standard character mode is
used, each character has a
choice of only one background
colour and one foreground
colour, b u t  Multi- C olour
mode allows each pixel (dot) to
be any of four colours: either
background c olour , f or e-
ground/character c o lo u r ,
multi-colour in o r  m u lt i-
colour #2. Each 'dot' in Multi-
Colour mode is twice as wide as
Standard colour mode, giving
half the horizontal resolution.
Multi-Colour mode can be set
on or off for each character on
the screen, so that the Standard
and Multi-Colour modes can
be mixed on the screen at the
same time.
Bit three of each byte in the
TED Atrribute area ($0800-
$0BFF hex, 2048-3071 decimal)
controls whether each charac-
ter is in Multi-Colour mode or
not. Bit three is set for Multi-
Colour mode. This has the
limitations o f  only  allowing
colours zero to seven to be
used as the character colour, as
Bit three used to be the highest
bit o f  the character colour.
Therefore in  lo w  resolution
mode, if the colour is less than
eight (zero for Black through to
seven for  Yellow) then the
character i s  dis play ed i n
Standard mode; if the colour
number is eight to 15 then the
character is displayed in Multi-
Colour m o d e  w i t h  t h e
background colour being the
colour number minus 8. The
following table should make
things clearer;

disadvantage of disabling the

means that the cursor is not

The program in Figure 2
demonstrates h o w  M u l t i -
Colour character mode works.
Please note that the triangle
with a line below it represents a
Cursor Left symbol.
RUN the program. As both
Multi-Colour # 1 a n d  Multi-
Colour # 2 are both s et t o

see the specks of the fore-
ground colour showing on the
Multi-Colour characters. B y

colour immediately change the
colour of the these characters.
Programmable Multi-
Colour Characters
Of c our s e, M u lt i- C o lo u r
characters are of no use unless
the characters are reprogra-
mmed. As an exercise, try to
create s ome mu lt ic o lo u r
programmable characters by
refering to the article in this
series o n  pr ogr ammable
characters. Hint: As most of the
ROM characters are virtually
unreadable i n  Multi-Colour
character mode, there is no
need to move a ROM character
set down into the 1K block.
Instead, make sure that you
blank out the 'SPACE' charac-
ter w ith zeros t o  stop the
screen ﬁlling w ith rubbish.
Figure 3 shows my attempt.
There now follows as exp-
lanation o f  the Multi-colour

Extended Background
Colour Mode
Extended background colour
mode gives you control of the
background colour for EACH
character on the screen as well
as the foreground colour. Ext-
ended background c olour
allows, for instance, bright red
text on a dark blue background
on a white screen. In this mode
only the ﬁrst 64 characters (0-
63) of the character set can be
used. The reason is that the top
two bits of each character code
(bits six and seven), used to
select the background colour.
In 'upper case and graphics'
mode the ﬁrst 64 characters
contain a ll characters apart
from graphics. In 'Iower/upper
case mode', although the ﬁrst
64 characters appear to contain
only lower case, numbers and
punc tuation, c har ac ter s
written in both lower case and
upper case will be displayed in
upper case.

This month we start a new
series by Allen Webb which
will introduce you gently to
the hazards of machine code.
IN THIS SERIES, I PLAN TO INTRODUCE
the basics of machine code on the 6510/
6502 microprocessors. Before you throw
this magazine into the ﬁre in disgust, I
intend to make this series as lightweight as
possible with the inclusion of examples
which will be both instructive and useful. I
don't intend to make you an expert in
machine code - that's up to you. But you
should b e  able t o  write reasonably
complex programs b y  t he time I'v e
ﬁnished.
First, why learn machine code? Here
are a few reasons.
1. It is a fast and compact language which
uses the processor most efﬁciently.
2. It offers an intellectual stimulus by
requiring a  disciplined a n d  logic al
approach to programming.
3. It's more fun that Basic!
Before diving into the subject, I want
to consider what tools you will need to
help you in your endeavours. First, you
will need the necessary development
software, primarily an assembler and a
machine code monitor. The choice of this
software is vitally important since it can
mean the difference between a long,
happy relationship with machine code
and insanity.
when you look for an assembler, you
should look for the following features as a
minimum:
1) A sensible editor for writing the source
code.
2) An  assembler which supports both
labels and variables.
3) If possible - Macros (more of this later).
4) If you plan to write large programs -
disk based.
5) Ensure that the assembler will generate
a full source code listing on assembly with
symbol tables with full printer options.
A decent assembler is not cheap so
insist on the best you can afford, it's
probably the best investment you'll make.
W E L C O M E  T O  T H E
Similarly, the monitor should have the
following features:
1) Full commands for the manipulation of
blocks of code -  including search with
replace, relocate.
2) In-built assembler and dis-assembler
for "ﬁne tuning" of code.
3) Debugging and tracing tools such as
single step, break points etc.
4) Full Save/Load facilities with relocating
load.
To help you with your search, here are
some packages of note:
1. Mikro Assembler (Supersoft Cartridge
f57.50). This is a well loved old faithful
which has been around for quite some
time, not as sophisticated as some but
totally reliable.
Pros
1) Reliable
2) Contains simple monitor on board
3) Two pass, full label facility
4) Allows linked disk ﬁles
5) Supports both serial and parallel
printers
Cons
1) No debugging commands
2) 12K limit on single block of code. To
assemble larger programs, need to use a
few tricks.
3) Perhaps a little pricey
I am advised by Peter Calver of Supersoft
that a version for the 128 is in the pipeline
and that it will operate in 128 mode rather
than simply being the 64 version (sounds
good).
2. Assembler Monitor 64 (First Publishing
Ltd, E19.99 disk). This is  a combined
package which includes a monitor of fair
capabilities.
Pros
1) Sophisticated commands for macros,
conditional assembly etc.
2) Powerful disk options with linked ﬁles
and assembly from and to disk
3) Full printer options
4) Two pass with full labels
5) Reasonable price.
Cons
1) Disk only
2) No disassembler
3) Need to load a separate program for
alphabetic symbol tables
22
3. Machine Lightning (Oasis Software,
disk or  cassette). Released as a games
writing package, the assembler is highly
sophisticated and works as a stand alone.
Pros
1) Available on disk and cassette. Cassette
version works equally well on disk ﬁles.
2) Custom written operating system,
bristles with features including DOS.
3) Macros, full labels.
Cons
1) Expensive
2) Instructions comprehensive b u t
confused and poorly written
3) Behaves oddly if  you wish t o use
routines in the Basic ROM. I believe this is
an artefact due t o  the fact that the
graphics command sits behind this ROM.
4) Non standard monitor
4. Zoom Monitor (Supersoft, Disk: E14.95,
Cassette: L12.95, Cartridge: E18.75) In my
opinion, this is the best British monitor
I've seen (the American monitor from HES
is also pretty good). Fully relocatable so
that you can avoid your object code. In
light of the weak monitor in the Mikro
Assembler, this  is  its  ideal working
partner.
Pros
1) Almost all commands you will need
2) Available in all formats
3) Loads relocatable. Tape based object
codes c a n  b e  for c ed t o  reloc ate
absolutely.
4) Additional D O S commands a n d
hex/decimal conversions.
5) Format quite standard.
6) As s embler , dis as s embler a n d
debugging commands.
Cons
1) I can't ﬁnd any except that bidirectional
scrolling isn't supported.
If you have insufﬁcient funds but suf-
ﬁcient stamina, you can use two packages
given in Your Commodore:
1. Stev e Carrie's  package i n  t h e
November, December (1985) and January
(1986) issues. This provides an editor,
assembler and monitor and looks pretty
good. Not only that, it only costs the price
of three issues.
2. Hypabasic gives a beeb style assembler
which is  ideal t o  help you learn but
perhaps insufﬁcient for a 40K mega-game.

OK, you've got the software, what
other support do you need? Well, here it
is (in descending order of value):
1. A copy of one of the standard works on
the 6510/6502. I use Zaks although there
are others (Programming the 6502 by
Rodney Zaks - Sybex - ISBN 0-139588-046-
6).
2. A decent memory map of the 64 - the
Programmer's Reference Guide is as good
as any.
3. Membership to the Independent Com-
modore Products User Group -  I read
their quarterly newsletter (well, it's more
of a book actually) with great relish.
(Membership Secretary - lack Cohen, 30
Branchester Rd, Newbury Park, Ilford,
Essex) Even if  you don't want to write
machine code, join. It's great value for
money with hints, reviews, useful infor-
mation a n d  discounts o n  s oft and
hardware.
4. A learn to write machine code book.
But please buy with care, there's an awful
lot of garbage around and I have yet to
ﬁnd one that really teaches machine code
to a decent level.
Having s aid that, t h e  Beginner's
Assembly Language Course by  Derek
Bush and Peter Holmes is pretty good in
that it combines a simple assembler with a
decent book. Plenty of exercises are given
and the standard isn't bad.
OK, let's start work. Figure 1 gives a
simpliﬁed version o f  the 6502/6510's
architecture. It's really fairly simple. The
micro-processor comprises a number of
registers whic h converse w it h  o n e
another by use of the data and address
buses. You may ﬁnd it easier to think of
the registers as boxes of two sizes, eight
bits and 16 bits wide. First we have the
Accumulator (A on the diagram). This
register is involved in most of the data
transfers and arithmetic activities. The
accumulator is eight bits wide so it can
only contain numbers between zero and
255 (I'll explain why shortly). Along with
the accumulator, we have three other
eight bit registers. The X arid Y registers
are similar to the accumulator but of
lesser capabilities. They are mostly used as
counters and temporary storage. The bits
in the status register (5) are used to tell you
what's happening in the processor. II, for
example, a calculation results in a minus
value, bit seven (the negative ﬂag) will be
set. Only seven of the status register's bits
are used and these are called ﬂags.
The microprocessor uses an area of
memory (the stack) as a scratch pad to

enable it to remember where it's got to.
The current position of the stack is kept in
the stack pointer (SP). Similarly, the
microprocessor needs to know where it's
got to in a program. The address of the
current command is held in the program
counter (PC). This is a 16 bit register
holding any value between zero and
65535. That's why the 6502/6510 can only
directly address a maximum of 64K. But
more of that later.
Two types of basic data are required by
the system. First, a value of data. This trots
along the data bus. The machine also
needs to know where to stick it (no dirty
comments please). Hence the address
bus. The last bit o f  the micro is the
Arithmetic Logical Unit. This performs, in
conjunction with the accumulator, arith-
metic and logic  functions (surprised
huh?). You'll appreciate the functions of
the ALU once we move on to arithmetic
and logic functions.
Before I ﬁnish, it's time for a little toil
so activate your brain cells. I want to
discuss a little about binary, bits and other
sundry rubbish.
First, what does 1,732 mean?
Yes, I know it stands for one thousand
seven hundred and thirty two but what
does it represent? Well we're dealing with

C 6 4
counting to the base 10 (you know, the
number of ﬁngers on two hands).
If you accept that 1000 is 10 cubed. 100
is 10 squared, 10 is 10 to the power one
and one is 10 to the power zero, we can
rewrite 1,732 in another way:
1732 = 1 x 1 0
You may notice that the highest power
of the base is the number of digits less
one.
If we call the base to which we are
counting N. then the generalised form of
any number of n digits to that base will be:
Dn-
The n- 1 t e r m appears since b y
convention we call the lowest digit or bit
the zero digit or bit.
In binary, N=2, i.e. we have only two
digits. one or zero. The general form for a
binary number is therefore:
D n-
l+ D
Let us consider an example, the number
%101. (The % sign is the conventional sign
to represent binary). As with all numbers,
the right hand digit is the smallest. By
convention this is called bit zero. The next
left bit is bit one and the leftmost bit is bit
two (bit=binary digit). You w ill have
noticed (you did, didn't you?) that the bit
number equates to the corresponding
power of two. So our example becomes:
96101 = lx + Ox2 + lx1 = 5
Here is an eight bit number -%11001100.
This is equivalent to:
%11001100 = 1 x 2
+ 1x2
which equals 128+64+8+4 = 204.
From this you should be able to prove
for yourself that the largest number than
an eight bit register can hold is %11111111
or 255.
For our sins, we humans cannot think
easily in binary. I  ﬁnd decimal tough
enough but binary...forget it. You need
to k now binary f o r  the purpose o f
manipulating speciﬁc bits but that's about
all. A more convenient system is to use the
base 16 - the hexadecimal system. In this
system, any eight bit number occupies
just two digits and any sixteen bit number
just four digits. As you will ﬁnd, this
makes life easier although you may not
believe me at the moment.
If w e apply N=16 t o  our  general
expression we get:
Decimal value = D
D
D
Consider the number $0016. There are
three features to note:
1) As for binary, we preﬁx hexadecimal
with a character so that we know what
base is in use. In the case of hexadecimal,
we use S. Some systems, particularly users
of Z80 machines, use &H.
2) Although the number only needs two
digits, the two most signiﬁcant digits are
shown as zeros,
3) If we are counting in groups of 16, how
do we represent the numbers 10 through
to 15?
The answer is that we pinch some
alphabet characters thus:
A = 10
B = 11
C = 12
D = 13
E = 14
F = 15
So $0016 = 0)(4096 + ex256 + 1x16 + 6 i.e.
$0016 = 24
Similarly, consider $10AB.
$10AB= 1)(4096 + Ox256 + 10x16 + 11 = 4267
(A=10, B=11....remember?)
Again, you should be able to verify
that the largest numbers which can be
held in eight and 16 bits are:
eight bits...%11111111 SONE = 255
sixteen bits..%1111111111111111 =WEE =
65535
Finally, t o  help link  what you've
learned to what you should seek in an
assembler, here is an imaginary piece of
assembled source code:
24
This is  a  composite of several as-
semblers but gives the general features.
The ﬁrst column of numbers is the line
numbers used by the editor. The second
column shows the addresses occupied by
the assembled code. The next three hexa-
decimnal bytes are the actual machine
code. The next column holds labels and
the last column holds the mnemonics
which assist writing the program. Don't
worry about the details at the moment,
things will be clearer in the next part of
the series. Just note two things:
1. I've deliberately used binary, decimal
and hexadecimal t o  show their inter-
changeability in a decent assembler.
2. You should aim to get an assembler
which offers the facilities shown.
Because I'm a fundamentally nasty
person, here is your homework,
1. Write the decimal numbers zero to
inclusive in binary.
2. Perform the following conversions.
%10101010 to decimal
123 to binary
%111101111 to decimal
$4100 to decimal.
1123 to hexadecimal
3. For those of you who want to try a small
program, write a program in Basic which
will accept a binary number and convert it
to decimal.
Well, that's all for this time. To help
you with your searches for software, here
are some addresses.

thereby improving the product
continually.
About two years ago, TRIGSOFT designed a brand new
product for the CBM64, the DCLI.
Since then we have sold many thousands of these
devices, in fact the idea was so good that several other
manufacturers started to market similar devices.
Well now we have done it again, after months of design work, TRIGSOFT have
come up with a unique new cartridge for the CBM64 and CBM128, the UPC1.
It will be interesting to see if this idea is copied.

[how to make changes
to your ﬂoppy disks.
HOW OFTEN HAVE YOU
scratched your latest program-
ming masterpiece from your
disk only to  realise a  few
moments later that you didn't
have a back up?
No doubt up until now the
only option open to you was to
retype th e  whole program
from the beginning.
A little more understanding
of how the 1541 disk drive
works would enable you to res-
cue most scratched programs
and make numerous other
changes to your disk direc-
tories.
Before you start playing
around with the contents of
your ﬂoppy disks it is important
that you understand exactly
how information is stored on
them. If you don't and you start
changing areas of a disk you
can probably wave bye-bye to
the contents o f the whole
thing.
In order t o  make any
changes to a disk you will re-
quire access to some sort of
disk monitor program. This is a
program that will allow you to
examine the contents of any
areas on a  disk and make
changes to them. There are
many disk editors available on
the market and an extremely
comprehensive one was pub-
lished in the January 1986 issue
of Your Commodore.
Disk Structure
Any new disk must be format-
ted before it can be used by the
1541 disk drive. Formatting a
disk divides it into 35 circular
rings called tracks. Each o f
these tracks is then split up
further into a number of equal
sized segments called sectors.
Each track contains between 17
and 21 sectors. Figure 1 shows
this is a little more clearly. As
you can see from the diagram
the number of sectors is smaller
towards the centre of the disk
because each track is shorter.
How Much Room?
In the centre of the disk on
track 18 you will ﬁnd the disk
information track. Track 18 is
used to keep all necessary in-

formation about programs;
where they are stored and how
much room is free.
The ﬁrst sector of track 18 is
used to record which sectors of
the disk have been used. This
record is called the Block Avail-
ability Map or BAM. Every time
you make any changes to the
contents of your disk the RAM
is examined so that the disk
drive can ﬁnd out where it can
store information. The RAM is
updated every time you save or
scratch a ﬁle from the disk.
Figure 2 shows the contents of
the ﬁrst part of track 18.
Figure 2 shows that bytes
four to 143 of track 18 sector
zero hold the RAM. Four con-
secutive bytes are used to rep-
resent the BAM for each track
Figure 3 shows exactly how the
information is stored.
As you are no doubt aware,
a single byte can hold a number
up to 255 or 11111111 in binary.
From the binary representation
it can be seen that each byte
can store the information for
eight tracks. Each digit repre-
senting o n e  sector. A  one
would tell you that the sector
had been used while a zero
would tell you that it was still
free. F or  example 11111100
means that six sectors had been
used.
The ﬁrst byte of each group
of f o u r  holds  t h e  ac tual
number of sectors available on
the relevant track. Don't forget
the number o f  sectors gets
smaller towards the centre of
the disk.
27
Disk Info
Bytes 144 to 255 of track 18
sector zero are used to hold all
the disk information. This is the
information which is printed
out at the top of each directory
listing. Figure 4 shows exactly
what information is held on this
section o f  the disk. I f  y ou
wanted to change the title or ID
of a disk then it would be a
simple matter to read this infor-
mation in t o  y our computer
using your disk monitor, make
the necessary changes and
then rewrite the information
back to the disk.
Directory Info
The sectors from one upwards
on track 18 are used to hold the
ﬁle names and information
relating to any program you
have stored o n  disk. Each
sector is referred to as a direc-
tory block and will hold the
information for  about eight
ﬁles. The ﬁrst two bytes of each
block are used to give the track
and sector of the next directory
block. Figure 5 shows how each
directory block is laid out. If
there is  n o  more directory
information then these tw o
bytes will hold zero.
Each of the eight program
entries in each directory block
is made up of 30 bytes. These
are the ones that hold the
information about the type of
ﬁle; where it is held etc. Figure
6 shows the exact use of each of
the 30 bytes.
The ﬁrst by te o f  eac h
program entry is used to hold
the ﬁle type. If you have a look
at Figure 7 you will see that
there are ﬁve different types of
ﬁle that can be represented.
However this byte gives more
information than you may at
ﬁrst realise.
Bits zero to two are used to
indicate which of the ﬁve types
of ﬁle we are looking at. Bit
seven is used to tell the drive if
the ﬁle is properly closed or if
the ﬁle is still open. A  one
indicates that the ﬁle is open.
An open ﬁle can be seen on a
directory listing with an
beside the ﬁle type.
Bit six holds a very impor-
tant piece of information and a
large number of people are
unaware of this. It is used to tell
the disk drive whether or not
the ﬁle is protected. Setting this
bit t o  a '1' will prevent you

deleting the ﬁle by  normal P r o g r a m  Er as ur e s e c o n d l y ,  t h e  ﬁle  ty pe i s  I f  you delete a ﬁle by acci-

program you would change the
zero to 02. Your program will
now be rectiﬁed. However, the
BAM will not be updated and if
you save any other programs to
this disk you stand a very good
chance o f  overwriting y our
program. Therefore, make sure
that you copy the rescued ﬁle
onto a new disk.
Tutorial
It is  probably worth going
through a short tutorial to illu-
strate some of the changes that
can be made. All examples are
demonstrated with t he disk
editor that appeared in  the
January issue of Your Commo-
dore.
Firstly, y ou w ill need t o
format a  new disk with the
following command:
OPEN1,8,15,"NO:TEST,YC"
Please make sure that the
disk is blank before you enter
the above command as it will
wipe y o u r  d i s k  o f  a l l
information.
Next, type in the following
small program and SAVE it to
disk with the ﬁlename 'ONE':
10 REM THIS IS A VERY
20 REM SHORT TEST
30 REM PROGRAM
40 REM
SO REM THE END
OK, so it's nothing stunning
but it will serve our purpose
very well.
Now LOAD your disk editor
. _rogram a n d  examine t h e
111 ntents o f  track 18 sector
' ro. If you have a look at bytes
- 44 to 161 you will see that they
hold the name of  the disk,
Figure 8 shows what you should
see. Now we shall change the
disk name.
Change the letters o f  the
ﬁle name to 'DEMO'. Figure 9
gives an example of how your
disk should look now.
Now write the sector back
to your disk with the write
command and your changes
will hav e been made per-

manent. tf you want to check
this f or  yourself reset your
machine and load in the disk
directory, you will see that the
name has been changed.
Now we are going to delete
a ﬁle and then recover it.
Delete the test ﬁle from your
disk w i t h  t h e  f o llo w in g
command:
OPEN,1,8,1 5,"50: ONE"
If you now try to LOAD the ﬁle
you will be unable to do so.
LOAD in your disk editor
and take a look at track 18
sector one. Since 'ONE' is the
ﬁrst program on disk this is
where it will be saved.
Figure 10 shows how your
display should look. The '00'
byte w h i c h  in d ic a t e s  a
scratched ﬁle has been high-
lighted. N o w  c hange this
number to '02' and save the
sector back to disk.
If y ou n o w  reset y our
machine you should ﬁnd that
the example program will now
load in correctly. Don't forget
that i f  y ou save any  more
programs to that disk the re-
covered ﬁle will probably be
deleted.

William Fong is this
month's entry for the
competition.
THERE ARE A  NUMBER OF
Kung Fu programs available on
the market. Even though Kung
Fu Masters from William Fong
lacks some of the polish of its
commercial counterparts it is
still an excellent game and is
well worth the effort to type in.
As you progress through
the numerous levels o f  this
program you will meet a num-
ber of adversaries. The ﬁrst is a
very small a n d  very easily
defeated Kung Eu master. Next
you have to face the stick lady
who is intent on battering you
around the head and ankles
with a rather large piece of
wood. Then, well ill leave it up
to you to ﬁnd Out as no one in
the ofﬁce has managed to get
past this level,
Kung Fu Masters is a very
well presented program with
full instructions and a practice
option included.
C
Getting It AU In
Kung h i  Masters comprises
three programs. The ﬁrst is a
loader program which is used
to set up your C64 and load in
the ﬁnal two parts. Don't forget
to change '8,1' to '1,1' where
indicated if you are using tape
instead of disk.
The three programs should
be stored in this order.
KUNG FU LOADER
KUNG FU MASTERS1
KUNG FtJ MASTERS2
KUNG FU MASTERS2 is a
machine code program and
you must use the Easy Entry
program t o  b e  found else-
where in this issue to enter the
program. W h e n  y o u  save
KUNG FU2 you should save it
after KUNG FU MASTERS1 with
the ﬁle  name 'KUNG  F U
MASTERS2 a n d  i t  must b e
saved with a start address of
8192 and an end address of
12626.
The Easy Entry program will
check each line as you enter it
leaving little room for mistakes.

Melbourne House's
Gyroscope really gets the
adrenalin ﬂowing. Eric Doyle
recovered sufﬁciently to write
a review.
AS AN ARDENT ARCADE GAME FREAK, I
often wish that my latest favourite was
available for my home micro thereby
saving me hundreds of pounds feeding up
the machine for just one more go. Marble
Madness was one such addiction in which
you had to steer a marble around a
treacherous course whilst being attacked
on all sides by colliding objects and your
opponent's marble in a race for the ﬁnish
line. Now I have Gyroscope which was
obviously developed by someone with a
similar passion to mine but, in this case, it
is a one player game.
The action takes place on a geometric
landscape which has pitfalls galore. The
surfaces are divided up into squares
giving a 3D appearance with hills and
hollows to impede your progress. Your
task is to guide the gyroscope around
each section and into a hole at the end of
the course which leads to the next screen,
Sounds like a piece of cake, doesn't it?
Well it did to me but that delusion was
soon dispelled.
Crossing the landscape within the time
limit and controlling the wretched
gyroscope is the main preoccupation
throughout the game. The gyroscope
seems to have a mind of its own and
wanders about paying little heed to your
frantic joystick manipulations. At least,
that's how it seems!
The landscapes all slope downwards in
ramps and terraces which vary in width
and at the edge of each surface is a fatal
drop which seems t o  attract th e
gyroscope like a cliff attracts a pack of
lemmings, with similar tragic results.
As though this natural attraction was
not enough, the ﬁendish programmer has
devised a series of magnetic panels which
'throw' the gyroscope in the direction of
an arrow printed on the panel's surface
and invariably pointing to the nearest
chasm. Negotiating a path through a ﬁeld
of these little devices is rather like walking
through a mineﬁeld in lead diving boots;
just say a prayer, shut your eyes and go for
it. With luck and a little quick witted
thinking, you'll make it.
Paradnoia is not a natural attribute of
mine but I'm sure the little aliens which
wander about the landscape have got it in
for me. They seem to  lurk i n  wait,
knowing that they are guarding the only
possible route I can take. I'm sure I can
hear them cackling in anticipation of the
havoc they are going to reek when my
gyroscope comes within striking distance.
Slippery glass panels mean that your
gyroscope will slide about and accelerate
down slopes and only by pulling the
joystick in the opposite direction will you
prevent disaster.
Although the rules state that seven
lives are awarded, and this is indeed true
in versions for other machines, my C64
game only gives ﬁve lives and the ﬁrst
version would not allow me to progress
beyond the third level. Melbourne House
assures me that this was caused by a faulty
master tape and that all the versions
currently on sale are bug free. I must
congratulate Melbourne House on this
prompt reaction to my complaint and I am
assured that anyone who may have
acquired a rogue copy which may have
slipped through the net will be treated
with the same alacrity.
The game is worth every penny and
with 30 screens to cope with it will be a
long time before anyone discovers the
surprise at the end of the game.
Panic will be your worst enemy but if
you can keep your head when all about
are losing theirs, you'll be a man, my son

Dave Crisp looks at Micro-
Simplex, a computerised
cashbook for small
businesses.
Micro-Simplex
ALL TYPES OF BUSINESSES NEED TO KEEP
accounts. Ask any person running a small
business what they dread most and the
answer more often than not is book-
keeping and VAT.
In a business where most takings are
cash and accounts are kept weekly it is
quite common to ﬁnd people using the
Simplex D Cashbook system.
This is a manual cashbook and one that
seems to have been around since time
immemorial. I used it when I ﬁrst started
in business and very successful it was too.
First Steps to Computers
Many small business men have their ﬁrst
taste of a computer when they transfer
from manual simplex to Micro-Simplex.
Micro-Simplex i s  t h e  computerised
version of the cashbook and as such it is
possibly the easiest one to use. In essence
it does the same 'job as the simplex
cashbook b u t  there are many more
features.
The manual presumes you have no
knowledge o f  either computers o r
accounting and starts from square one. It
even tells you how to plug everything in.
The manual guides you in  a clear
logical way presenting procedures as they
appear in the program. Screen dumps are
found on pages where this clariﬁes the
text and so it is possible and indeed
recommended to go through the manual
once o r  t w ic e without us ing t h e
computer.
Hardware
The program itself is in a multipart format
and so between major menu-choices it is
usual to hear the disc start running and
loading that particular option. This does
not take much time and is not as bad as it
sounds.
Because so much information is stored
it is required that you have a separate
data-disc. This means that at certain times
there is a considerable amount of disk
swopping which after a few weeks use
does get rather irritating. The answer to
this is a second disc drive which makes
using the program so easy it is hard to
describe.
The cost of a second drive seems off-
putting but do not forget if you are in a
position to use Simplex then the cost of
that second drive can be offset against tax.
BUSINESS
Simplex is set up in such a way that you
can upgrade from a single to twin drives
mid-year without having to re-conﬁgure
the system. Most of Simplex is written like
this is a second disk drive which makes
gone into making the program easy to
use.
Support
When y ou buy  Simplex you need to
register as a user. This is free but I can
recommend spending another £25 and
becoming a member of the Simplex Users
Club, This membership entitles you to a
free updating service as well as keeping
you in  touch with other users via a
newsheet which also contains hints and
tips. Membership also allows you to use
the Hotline which is a godsend if you
suffer any problems.
Setting Up
BUSINESS
IF
Before you start with Simplex you must
'conﬁgure' t h e  system. This  means
41
E
entering company details, opening
balances, screen colours, type of printer
being used and so on. Once done you can
forget about it. Then you need to tell it a
little about how you want to keep your
accounts.
To d o  t h is  y o u  mus t  s e t  u p
departments for payments and receipts.
Lets take the example of a grocer as
they do in the manual.
You may want to split up receipts in
several headings. e.g. general takings,
alcoholic drinks, cig/tobacco, and
newspapers and so on or you may just
want one heading; for example. general
takings. This is entirely up to you when
you set up. The advantage of full analysis is
that i t  giv es  y o u  f a r  m o r e  sales
information.
With regard to expenses, the same
system is  used. You c an s plit y our
expenses into departments as above or
have one heading for all your stock.
For payments on items other than
stock there are spaces to add your own
plus the usual ones set up already such as
heat and light, rent, rates, telephone,
advertising etc.
All these headings have a number
which y ou use when entering either
receipts or payments.
When making a payment for business
stock this is the information you will need
to enter.
1 Payment number (used only to amend
mistakes)
2 Analysis code. Enter t he category
number e.g. 04 for cig/alcohol
3 Date/cheque number
4 T o whom paid
5 Amount
6 VAT Content (if applicable)
The format is roughly similar for other
payments/receipts a n d  tak es  o n ly
minutes to get the hang of.
Bank Routines
There a r e  r outines  f o r  managing
payments and withdrawals from the bank
as well as entering standing orders and
service charges etc.
Unpaid bills
When you receive a bill it is possible to
enter it as an unpaid bill. Then when you
come to pay it the information is there
already. These need not be entered but I

VAT 
C
ﬁnd that it does help. Also there is the fact
that at end year these unpaid bills are
taken into consideration in the proﬁt/loss
sheet.
Foul-ups
Everybody makes mistakes. One error in
your accounts can be carried through the
year if not picked up. Some accounting
systems have little or no error correction
whatever but simplex allows full error
correction though it can seem a little
complicated at ﬁrst use. Persevere though
and like most of simplex you will ﬁnd you
rarely have to refer to the manual.
Reports
Perhaps the most impressive thing about
Simplex is the volume of reports it can
print out.
It seems that you do not enter half the
information it can print out but so much
of the work is done 'underneath' Simplex.
There are reports for receipts, depart-
mental analysis, payments made to the
bank, payments made for business stock.
payments for other goods, weekly bank
reports, weekly cash reports, other
receipts, cheque reconcilliation lists,
audit trails and proﬁt and loss accounts.
VAT is often a nightmare. With Simplex
problems are almost non-existent. At the
end of a VAT quarter it will print out the
information you need to put on your VAT
return. It really is as easy as that. I have
seen Micro Simplex sold on this alone.
It will cope with VAT schemes A, B, C,
D, E, F and pharmacy scheme B which
covers most of the schemes in common
use. If you use a scheme other than this I
am afraid y ou w ill need a  bigger
Commodore.
I have installed Micro-Simplex i n
many small businesses and there have
been virtually no problems. Problems
have only arisen where operator error has
not been noticed but in these cases the
problem has always been sorted out with
no loss of data.
Improvements
Micro Simplex could be improved in one
respect. There are many software based
fast loaders available now and it would be
nice if one of these could be incorporated
into Simplex. Apart from that.. no moans.
It's satisfying that the only moan I can
come up with is one which is actually a
problem with the speed of the hardware
rather than a problem with the software.
Well done Simplex!

When asked about approval, Keith

been approved by the Galatic federation

Tape Trouble
SINCE YOUR COMMODORE TO O K
over Your 64, there is one most useful
feature which was available and now
seems to have fallen by  the wayside.
Messrs Digitape provided a service which
could supply a tape containing all of the
programs from a particular issue.
Your magazine certainly contains far
more useful utilities, but for those with
limited time at their disposal a similar ser-
vice would be most helpful.
Trusting that you will consider this a
constructive suggestion since a copy of
Steve's Disk Editor would mak e a n
excellent start.
K F Whittaker, Maidenhead
Thank y ou f o r  your k ind comments
regarding the contents of the magazine,
we do try to publish useful programs and
maintain a very high standard of listing.
However, we do realise that some of the
programs are extremely long, and very
difﬁcult to type in. You, and no doubt
many other readers, will be pleased to
know that this issue of the magazine sees
the start o f  t h e  Your  Commodore
Software Service. Each month we will be
making most programs available o n
cassette. We will not be offering a disk as
none of the programs will be protected so
that y o u  c an easily back them u p
yourselves.
This month we are not only offering a
cassette of most of the software in this
issue but we are also making available a
Best of Your Commodore cassette which
contains some of the best programs pub-
lished from the last year, one of which is
the disk editor that you mention.
Scratch'n'Save
I was very pleased to see the Disk Editor
which you published in the January issue
•
of the magazine, I have been looking out
for one for quite a while.
I have ﬁgured out how I can change
speciﬁc areas on a disk but I am still a little
unsure as to how the disc works. I have
also been told that you can recover a ﬁle
that has been scratched by using a disk
editor. Is this so? If it is then could you
please explain how you go about it.
G Higginbottom, Bognor Regis
Steve's Disk Editor has certainly sparked
up a lot of interest. We are a little limited
for space on the letters page to give you a
reply to your question here. Elsewhere in
this issue you will ﬁnd an article that
explains just how a disk is made up and
gives you some hints about changing the
content. You can rescue a scratched ﬁle
from your disk as long as you haven't
SAVfd anything else to it after the scratch
command, the procedure for rescueing a
ﬁle is explained in the article.
C-16 Plea
I feverishly ﬂicked through the January
1986 edition to read the Mastering the C-
16 article only t o  ﬁnd that it  wasn't
featured!
The whole o f  t he magazine was
conﬁned to the C64 (yet again!). I have
been subscribing to this magazine since it
ﬁrst started in '84, because it devoted its
editqriaJ t(I all,t he Commodore products,
now I ﬁnd that it is just for the 64. I can't
remember the last time I saw a program
for the Vic.
With the cheap sales of C-16s and
Plus/4s currently on offer there must be a
large number of these machines in use
together with lots of owners who are still
waiting to type in your programs. If there
are no features on these machines how do
you expect to get programs to publish?
Why don't y ou publish a  games
programming series like you did for the
Vic 20, I'm sure it would be welcome, Or
how about a listing of some of the pokes
44
that you can use on your machine?
C64 owners certainly seem to have a
good time. Do I need to upgrade after
getting what I  thought was a  good
CC) mputer.
Please remember us C-16 and Plus/4
owners in your magazine in future.
Unsatisﬁed Reader, St leonards
There has been no plot to forget the
owners of Commodore machines other
than the C64. We  d o try t o include
programs f o r  all o f  the Commodore
machines every issue. Some months
however, this just isn't possible. Take the
January issue for example. Mastering the
C-16 was due t o  b e published but
managed to get itself lost somewhere in
one of the many processes that articles
_have to go through before publication.
Don't despair however as the missing part
will be found in this issue and Joe Nicol-
son has lots of ideas for the future.
We agree with you that there must be a
lot of C-16 and Plus/4 owners out there,
Not a day goes by without some query
regarding these excellent little machines.
But material for these machines is a little
thin on the ground and very difﬁcult to
ﬁnd. Surely some of you C-16 and Plus/4
owners have produced some software
that you would like to share with other
people or  perhaps you may have dis-
covered some interesting things about
your machine. If you have then please
send them in as we are on the look out for
material all the time and depend on you,
the reader, for quite a lot of material
published in the magazine.
So how about it, all you C-76 and
Plus/4 owners, why not get in touch?
As for the poor Vic, even less material
is around for this little beast ie. No one can
remember the last time that we received
any material for this machine, So come on
Vic owners why don't you get in touch as
well? Surely not all Vics are sat gathering
dust in cupboards.

HAVING DISCOVERED AN old
treasure map, a group of kids
c alling thems elv es  T h e
Goonies set off to ﬁnd the loot
that will ﬁnancially save their
town from some greedy land
development company. I t  is
your job to get Mikey, Brad,
Chunk, Andy, Mouth, Data and
Stef to the treasure through
eight screens of bats, skulls,
deadly slime, crushing rocks
and a n  octopus. For  each
screen there are two Goonies
and you must use them both to
overcome the problems on the
screen and enter the nex t
stage.
The immediate problems
facing t he Goonies o n  t he
screen are not the only ones
because they are chased by the
mad Italian family the Fratellis.
Mrs Fratelli is the leader but
after seeing her, I  somehow
feel s he w ould b e  better
leading an Olympic shotput
team!
The ﬁrst screen begins in an
old derelict building which has
three ﬂoors. Here you must
ﬁnd the exit to the basement
and get each Goonie out. The
hazards are that Mrs Fratelli
continally r uns  along t h e
bottom level and any contact
with her is fatal. At ﬁrst the task
of getting both characters out
may seem difﬁcult but with the
aid of the money printer, Mrs
Fratelli can soon be avoided.
Having found the exit the
next two of the intrepid ex-
plorers are placed in an under-
ground cavern. The secret here
is to ﬁnd the key and open the
door at the bottom. However
the route to the key is littered
with traps. Huge boulders try to
crush y o u  t o  death a n d
electricity cables try to kill you
while you cross a deep pool of
water. As well as all this, a
rather unfriendly b a t  ﬂaps
wildly across the screen and
contact with h im  results i n
immediate death.
The n e x t  s ix  s c reens
become increasingly difﬁcult
and h a v e  s o m e  b iz a r r e
problems t o  overcome. The
third stage is very tricky and
takes quit e s ome t im e  t o
master. The task is to burst a
large pipe but avoid being
blasted by jets of steam which
are frequent. The use of the
two c har ac ter s  i s  v e r y
important here if you are to
succeed and an added hazard-
one of the Fratelli brothers - is
equipped w i t h  a  g u n  s o
dodging bullets i s  another
thing to keep in mind.
Screens f o u r  a n d  ﬁv e
feature ladders and platforms
whilst t h e  sixth has  s ome
deadly s lime t o  deal with.
Having seen t h e  ﬁlm  t w o
months ago, I recognised all
the previous screens which
gave me a slight advantage. The
seventh stage however posed a
problem -  on the shape of a
large octopus. When I saw the
ﬁlm the octopus scene was cut
out, and with only two men left
I didn't k now what t o  do.
Somehow, with extreme luck, I
managed t o  c omplete t h e
screen and entered the ﬁnal
stage, where the loveable, but
very deﬁnitely dead pirate,
One Ey ed Willie a n d  t h e
treasure were situated. Getting
the treasure was just reward for
the effort I  had put i n  t o
conquer the previous screens.
The game has an outstand-
ing feature in playability. The
essential changing o f  char-
acters i s  d o n e  s imply  b y
pressing the ﬁre button which
allows the game to continue
quickly. T h e  d e g r e e  o f
difﬁc ulty  i s  v e r y  g o o d
compared to games like Pitfall'
II etc. and this is certainly an
appealing factor. Some nice
music makes the games as a
whole entertaining but sadly
the graphics are not up to the
standard I have come to expect
from US Gold. The sets in the
ﬁlm ar e excellent b u t  t h e
reproduction in the game is
well below par. One advantage
the game boasts over the ﬁlm,
is the fact that the characters
thankfully do not speak!
No doubt the success of the.4
ﬁlm will make this a hit this
year.

masked hero of the old ﬁlms
and TV series. Here, he is trying
to rescue a beautiful senorita
from the clutches of the evil
Sergeant Garcia. Before you
can reach her though, you will
have several problems to solve
and objects to ﬁnd to help you
on your quest. Naturally, you
aren't told what these are and
you may ﬁnd things a  little
confusing at ﬁrst.
Zorro's two trademarks are
his marvelloys swordplay and
his mighty leaping over the
rooftops, swinging from the
chandeliers etc. and the game
features both these attributes
prominently. T he swordplay
with the guards is just designed
to slow you down and reduce
your bonus score but it is easy
to get too careless and lose one
of your lives. Leaping around
requires very careful position-
ing and you will usually have to
bounce several times on an
object to gain enough height to
jump up to where you want to
go. See-saws, trampolines.
curtain rails and large rubber
balls all appear.
The graphics are quite dis-
appointing, not very clear and
in uninspiring shades of brown
and yellow. The effect is of
some interesting ideas and
problems to be solved but not
particularly well implemented.

BOXING GAMES ARE ALL

from the actual bouts them-

selecting a head, body and legs
from thos given. You can name
your character and change the
colour of his skin and trunks
etc. You then assign values to
your boxer's strength in head
and body punches and also
what punishment he can take.
Then it's off to the gym for a
spot o f  practice. There are
eight moves to be mastered -
two punches, two feints, guard
up and down and move left and
right. The computer leads you
through a  series o f  training
routines.
In the ring, you have three
three-minute rounds t o  win
either on points or by a knock-
out. T h e  g r a p h ic s  a n d
animation are excellent. You
start against the number four
contender, Dip Stick. He is a
dirty ﬁghter and his favourite
punch is a decidedly low one to
your nether regions whic h
brings tears to your eyes and
makes your man go cross-eyed
and weak-kneed. If you win,
you have three more bouts to
get through before y ou're
allowed a crack at the champ.

AT LAST., A  SHOOT-EM-UP
with some original features. As
Starion from the Space Aca-
demy, you must ﬂy backwards
in time trying to repair the
damage i n  t h e  space-time
c ontinuum, d e lib e r a t e ly
destroyed by aliens who are
your technological superiors.
You ﬁnd yourself in a time
grid containing nine different
zones. Selecting a zone, you
must des troy  a  s pec iﬁed
number of enemy ships. These
are superbly depicted in 3-D
vector graphics. Every time you
shoot one, you can pick up the
alien's cargo which is in the
form of a letter. When you have
destroyed the entire enemy
ﬂeet, t h e  letters y ou hav e
collected n e e d  t o  b e  u n -
scrambled in order to give you
the natur e o f  t h e  cargo.
However, solving the anagram
is only half the problem. After
ﬂying through a time warp, you
must decide i n  which time
zone the cargo belongs. If you
choose correctly and visit the
appropriate planet, all well and
good. If not, you must battle
away to another warp and try
again. When you complete one
grid, y ou ar e let  loose o n
another eight. It's tough being
hero.
Control of the ship is fairly
simple. You can bank, dive,
climb and adjust your velocity.
Your instrument panel has two
radar screens giv ing t h e
location of the enemy as well as
indicators showing the number
of ships to be destroyed plus
fuel, oxygen and temperature
levels.
Starion is a highly original
space game. Well worth a
look.
HAVING BEEN THE BUTT OF
much adverse publicity over
previous titles- Theatre Europe
PSS seems likely to attract
similar attention with this latest
game whic h is  a  wargame
simulating the British attempt
to regain the Falkland Islands
after the Argentinian Invasion.
You have between 25 and 30
turns to either occupy all 10
settlements or totally destroy
the enemy forces. There are
four potential landing sites and
you c a n  inv es tigate t h e
defences in two of these using
the SAS and SBS. Those units
are important as they are the
only ones with the ability to
reconnoitre the surrounding

All your troops are given
four values, a n  aggression
factor, defence factor, move-
ment allowance and attack
range. The ﬁrst two numbers
will change due to the effects
of combat. After you land, you
get options to move, attack if
in range) o r  d o  nothing.
Combat ma y  b e  a t  close
quarters, over a distance for
artillery barrages or you may
summon up an air attack or
naval bombardment.
Movement depends o n
your movement allowance and
the type o f  terrain you are
crossing. Your move might be
cut short if there is an air attack
and ends automatically if you
move next to an enemy unit.
The graphics are simple and
clear which is  essential for
good wargaming. There are
ﬁve skill levels and the game
plays very well.

Rambo
Ocean
THE FILM RAMBO : FIRST
Blood part II was a box ofﬁce
smash hit both in America and
over here in England. If you
have seen it, you will know that
it is action all the way through
with Rambo b lo w in g  u p
absolutely everything in sight
in a desperate bid to rescue
POWs against insurmountable
odds and ﬁnishes off with a
totally incomprehensible - but
no doubt, very deep a n d
meaningful -  speech. Ocean
has now written a game loosely
based on the storyline of this
ﬁlm.
The actual game loads -
preceded b y  a  very good
picture o f  Rambo with his
rocket launcher -  with absol-
utely inc r edible inter r upt
driven music pumping away in
the background. When it's
loaded, you enter your name
and start.
Rambo is in the middle of
the jungle. Your ﬁrst task is to
ﬁnd the POW camp, cut free
the prisoner tied to a bamboo
cross in the camp and retreat to
a helicopter positioned to the
north of the camp. You have a
knife and a cross bow (which
may be loaded with normal or
explosive tipped arrows) but a
machine gun may be picked up
on the way to the camp when
you pass a secret temple. In
order to reach the camp, you
can e it h e r  blas t a l l  t h e
patrolling soldiers with your
machine gun and blow your
way t h r o u g h  w i t h  y o u r
explosive tipped arrows or you
can use a knife and sneak into
the camp - the former method
is more risky but gains more
points. In either case, by the
time y o u  hav e fr eed t h e
prisoner, t h e  guar ds  a r e
running about w it h  t h e ir
machine guns blazing away.
The best tactic here is to arm
yourself w ith t h e  explosive
tipped arrows and blow your
way through to the helicopter.
One useful tip here is to keep
ﬁring. That way, any  trees
which could impede Rambo's
progress a r e  des tr oy ed,
together w i t h  a n y  hos tile
soldiers.
Hav ing s u c c e s s f u lly
boarded the helicopter, you
must then go back for the main
body of prisoners. If you do
manage t o  locate and free
them without getting riddled
with lead, a helicopter gunship
is sent in pursuit. You have to
destroy t h e s e  fear s ome
machines -  actually a Mi124 -
and take the prisoners to the
safety o f  Thailand. I f  y ou
manage t o  d o  this, you g o
through t h e  whole process
again.
An energy band a t  the
bottom o f  the screen shows
Rambo's strength reserve and
this gradually decreases as he is
hit by  enemy ﬁre but i t  is
replenished upon completion
of each stage. As you would
expect, the game ends if the
energy drops to zero.
The most distinctive feature
of this game is the quality of
music and the variety of sound
effects, They ar e incredibly
atmospheric a n d  ac tually
increase the enjoyment of the
game rather than irritate you as
somtimes happens. I would go
as far as to say that the quality of
music by  Martin Galway, so I
am reliably informed) is higher
than that of the Monty Mole
tune by Rob Hubbard. Not only
that, the graphics are excep-
tionally good too. The way in
which Rambo runs around with
his muscles pulsating is quite a
sight and it is very satisfying
when several enemy soldiers
turn i n t o  s k eletons  a n d
disappear into the ground with
a crunch as soon as they are hit
by Rambo's machine gun ﬁre. I
also like the way in which the
guards fell to the ground when
their watch towers were blown
up.
The game is not however, a
gloriﬁed shoot-'em-up. There
is an element o f  adventure
involved in actually deciding
how to go about rescueing the
ﬁrst prisoner, locating the main
body of prisoners and ﬁnding
your way to Thailand.
Although t h e  hardened
arcade addicts among you may
ﬁnd it a little easy to complete
the mission, Rambo is a game
which is  technically brilliant
and also remarkably exciting,
challenging and very addictive.
One i n t e r e s t i n g  p o i n t
however, is that you are inst-
ructed never to engage the
enemy or to attempt a rescue in
the instruction leaﬂet and the
games intr o. I  wonder  i f
anyone is going to take this
advice?

FRED FLINTSTONE H A S
fallen in love. The object of his
desire is the delectable Wilma
but she doesn't know it yet.
Based o n  t h e  c hildr en's
cartoon series The Flintstones,
Yabba Dabba Doo has Fred
setting out to woo Wilma in
true caveman fashion.
This he decides to do by
building a house for the two of
them to settle down in. Starting
off w ith a  pile o f  assorted
stones. He must ﬁrst clear the
area o f  r u b b l e  b e f o r e
assembling h i s  des ir able
residence. The rocks are of two
types - ﬂat ones that should be
thrown into the pit and round
ones which, when correctly
placed, result in the approp-
riate bit of house appearing.
As Fred moves round col-
lecting bits of rock, he must
avoid c ollis ion w i t h  t h e
assorted dinosaurs. Meeting
with Wilma helps enormously,
as does ﬁnding his car. He also
needs to earn enough money
to hire a dinosaur to help him
put his roof up_
The main problem with this
game lies in moving Fred from
screen to screen. You can only
reach higher and lower streets
by moving diagonally at the
edge of the screen. This tends
to be a very hit or miss affair,
and what is wrong with the
normal method of leaving a
screen top and bottom, left and
right, I'll never know.
Yabba Dabba Doo is a very
colourful game and looks most
attractive but I  think that it
lacks lasting appeal and I ended
up being more annoyed with it
than entertained. G A M .

AT LAST SOMEONE IS EXPERI- effort, covering the develop-
menting with new concepts in m e n t  o f  a  renegade fr om
computer games. Deus  Ex infancy t o  death through a
Machina i s  a n  intellectual Shakespearian ages o f  man
falls well short of the medal
positions.
It is some considerable time
before you get your medal.
You start off in small local races
and if you do well enough, you
are invited t o  take part at
Crystal Palac e, t h e n  t h e
European and World Champ-
ionships before you reach the
Olympics and of course, you
have to improve constantly if
you are to progress.
The main problem with the
game is that you have very little
to do. Apart from determining
how fas t y o u r  m a n  r uns
throughout the race, the only
other action you have is in
changing lanes and only then if
driven strategy game. Starting
off with 10,000 Talers (the local
currency), you begin by trading
in corn and land, You must
feed your people a  certain
amount but can donate extra
food in the hope of attracting
immigrants. Next, y  o u  are
given the population statistics
for that year -  births, deaths
etc. You must then set the
budget for the following year
by adjusting levels for assorted
taxes. Then it's time to spend,
as you decide whether to build
markets, mills or develop your
army. You can also wage war,
but this comes later in  the
game. B a d  adminis tration

you select the hard difﬁculty

bars, one for speed, the other
for energy. The faster you go,
so your energy decreases.
Graphically, t h e  game
presents a rear view of your

height of the screen. All the
runners are drawn in white and
there are some problems when
they overlap.

The package comprises two
tapes, o n e  containing t h e

simultaneously with the game.
The sound track boasts many
famous names such as Jon
Pertwee, Ian Dury, and Frankie

tracks which give cryptic clues
towards the purpose of each
section of the game.
Although t h e  concept is
sound and the audio tape is
produced t o  a  v ery  h ig h
standard the games themselves
are disappointing and a little
suspended from ofﬁce for a
year.
Up to nine people can play,
but be warned, with each turn
taking a couple of minutes, you
will not ﬁnish playing in an
evening. Fortunately, it is easy
to save the current position.
Control of the game is entirely
via the joystick and is easy to
master. In order to win, you
must have certain assets as well
as live towns, a palace and a

opinion, considerably mor e

MOTOR RACING SIMULA-
tions have become more and
more sophisticated a n d  i n
complexity Revs is the best yet.
Superbly packaged with maps
of both the Brands Hatch and
Silverstone circuits, a Formula 3
Driver's Handbook and Special
Racing Programme no-one can
complain about a  lac k  o f
documentation,
A quick glance through the
books leaves you in no doubt
about t h e  pedigree o f  this
program with cars emblazoned
with Acorn Computer stickers.
Unfortunately this is unavoid-
able because t h e  technical
consultant is David Hunt who is
sponsored b y  t h e  s a id
company.
Controlling the Revs car is
an extremely complex business
and the 24 page manual guides
you step by step through the
training programme which is
equally applicable to the real
world of motor racing as it is to
the Revs world.
Control is exercised by key-
board keys and this is the one
weakness of the simulator. An
analogue joystick can be used
but a p a r t  f r o m  m y  o w n
Voltmace I know of very few
computer journalists w h o
possess one for the 64 let alone
home users. A combination of
paddle w i t h  k ey board o r
switched joystick can be used
which is  probably even less
help unless you make your own
paddle.
So it's keyboard then, and

Nowadays all this cash can be
saved by investing in this game
from Leisure Genius.
Basically i t  i s  merely a
simple Formula 1 simulation
this involves seven keys for
racing which i t  would have
been n i c e  t o  h a v e  a s
redeﬁnable but this program
makes few concessions.
Before commencing either
a practice session or a race, the
driver must set the angle of the
wings which hold the car down
on to the road. Both front and
rear w i n g s  c a n  b e  s e t
independantly w hic h gives
plenty o f  scope for  experi-
mentation,
Starting the engine involves
engaging the clutch, checking
for neutral gear. pressing the
starter andt hen the rev counter
can be increased to the required
turn over speed. As you can see
it is just like the real thing but
there is one important differ-
ence; the engine is far more
tolerant of misuse.
Steering and gear changes
are fairly standard procedures
using the rev counter as a guide
(hence the name Revs), If you
leave the track at any time the
handling of the car changes
accordingly. With grass under
the wheels the car will slither
about as though on an ice rink
and skill is required to avoid a
spin or stalling.
Wing mirrors are provided
to give warning of approaching
drivers who can be blocked
but its  advantage over t h e
opposition is  the ability t o
construct a track to your own
design or to use one of the 17
preset tracks based on actual
courses. Your own designs can
then be saved and stored for
future use on cassette or disk.
The race itself relies on your
ability t o  manipulate a n d
control the car's speed and
direction and, as such, offers
no advantage over the many
similar simulations currently
available. The only control you
can exert is  left and right
movement, accelerate a n d
brake. There ar e n o  gear
changes or complex rules to
follow.
Designing a track is great
fun giv ing a  f ull range o f
Scalextric track units such as
banked curves, chicanes, four
from overtaking by a crafty bit
of manoeuvring.
When the course can be
negotiated within the 1.40 time
limit you are ready for com-
petition at one of the three
levels depending on whether
you make the qualifying time
or not.
One really excellent facility
is the pseudo multi player races.
For example, two players can
indiv idually  c o m p le t e  a
qualifying round and then they
take turns to compete in a race.
During each race the role of
the other driver is simulated
based on the qualifying round
and at the end a score card is
displayed showing the statistics
and results.
Graphically it is obviously a
conversion from a BBC and I
feel far more could have been
done to the graphic display to
make it more slick. Despite this
and the fact that the sound
effects are a little irritating I
have got to say that this is the
most realistic and difﬁc ult
racing simulation which I have
seen and one which I would
heartily recommend though
beginners may prefer t o try
something a  l i t t l e  le s s
demanding before moving on
to this one.
F.D.
lengths of straight track and a
selection o f  normal curves
turning through various angles.
After placing the starting grid
where you want it, by moving a
cursor around the screen, you
can pick up a piece by cursor
selection and start to build up
your track.
The only problem I found
with this is that if you want to
make a change somewhere in
the middle of the track you
have to remove pieces working
backwards from the starting
grid, change t h e  offending
piece of track and then rebuild
back to the grid.
Two players can enjoy a
race a n d  I  w o u ld  highly
recommend it to anyone who
dislikes the control complexi-
ties displayed by similar games.

F Brun provides a
handy routine to turn
machine code into
data statements.
WHEN U SIN G  MA C H IN E
code, sprites, UDGs, hi res, or
in fact anything that uses blocks
of memory, it can be a bit of a
pain to handle, as the Com-
modore h as n o  built i n
machine co d e monitor as
standard. So what!, you might
say. I've got one here o n
cartridge/disk/tape. A h  yes,
that's dead easy to use, and you
could use a sprite designer to
design the sprites, likewise a
UDG d esi g n er f o r  t h e
characters. But, t h e major
problem comes with compat-
ability and clashing. It is highly
probable that the sprite/UDG
designer will sit in the same
place i n  memory a s your
beloved program. Even the
Your Commodore system for
machine code ﬁles and data
blocks can get a bit messy if you
don't have - or can't use - the
appropriate utilities.
The simple answer is to
incorporate the data/mc as
Basic Data statements. But, to
do that properly you have to
dump out the memory in hex
to a  printer ( how  many
monitors allow you to dump
decimal?), convert i t  t o
decimal, and then type it all
back in again.
To do this accurately you
have to be at least superhuman,
even a  Commodore User
writer!, however there is an
easier option.
With Data Maker, all you
have to do is to save your data
to disk, run the program, and
then you will be left with a self
standing Basic program with
neat lines of data, each line
having a checksum. This is so
that if at any time you get the
program a bit corrupted it will
sort out the mess and tell you
which line the problem was in
- rather than trapping the error
at the 'READ' stage of the
program, which is no use to
anybody. Mo st  magazines
prefer data to have checksums
in it as it reduces the amount of
people who think that it is the
magazine at fault rather than
their own typing.
The rest of the program will
automatically self destruct - so
DATA
MAKER
save it ﬁrst!
The program works b y
directly reading the data off the
disk, dumping it to a buffer
area in memory. This is then
read and compiled into the
data statements. The checksum
is calculated as it goes. The rest
of the program then pulls itself
up by its bootstraps and kills
itself off.
The problem for tape users
is t h at  t h e  Commodore
operating system does not
allow you to read a non-data
ﬁle off tape. For this you would
have t o  carefully write a
program that reads the code
into memory and then writes it
out byte-for-byte as a data ﬁle -
remembering to make the ﬁrst
two bytes the load address in
lo/hi format. T he program
could then be easily modiﬁed
to read in the data ﬁle and
convert this instead.
The program is restricted to
16K of code and 24K of Basic
program data. This is because
the Basic data will take up a lot
more room than the original
code, typically 3-4 times as
much. So the buffer needs to
be a lot smaller than the area
left for Basic. I chose a 16/24
split because that is useful for
most purposes. However,
changing t h e  p o kes t o
locations 55/56 in the ﬁrst line
and the value of 'M can alter
this for a  bigger or smaller
proportion as you wish.

This month Daryl
I Bowers hasn't
managed to m o v e
mountains but he's I
shifted some buildings'
I instead.
IN THIS MONTH'S ARTICLE
we have, as promised, the frog
movement routines and a joy-
stick reading routine. In addi-
tion to all that, you can have
some moving buildings iGaspl
Shock! Horror!). Go on then,
type it in!
The ﬁrst routine is 'PLAYER',
but its  ﬁrst line calls 'JOY-
READ', so I'll deal with that
immediately. This routine was
taken straight from page 345 of
the Programmer's Reference
Guide (henceforth referred to
as PRG) with lull explanation,
but I will just explain the values
it returns. The registers on exit
have the following values:
X - x direction movement
Y - y direction movement
A - nothing
Carry Flag -  if clear then ﬁre
button pressed
Right, all clear? Now back to
'PLAYER'. This routine uses
several variables which are all
very simple t o  understand:
'10YSTATU5' is zero when the
ﬁrebutton i s  n o t  pressed.
'NXY1LIMP' is set to the next
jump ty pe (z ero o r  one).
'MVLOOP i s  t h e  d e la y
between Frog movements. We
shall look at any others later on.
The ﬁrst thing -  having
called '10YREAD' -  is to see
whether the ﬁrebutton is still
pressed from the last jump, and
if it is, to ignore it. If it is not
pressed then '10YSTATUS' is
set to zero so that the next
depression o f  the ﬁrebutton
will not b e  ignored. I f  the
button is pressed and it had not
1
1
been pressed previously, then
'10YSTATUS' is set to one, and
'NXTJUMP' is set t o  one t o
make the next jump a large
one. The effect of this is to
make it necessary to press the
ﬁrebutton and release it every
time you want to make another
jump -  holding it down will
have no effect after the ﬁrst
jump.
Whic h b r i n g s  u s  t o
'NOFIRE'. F r o m  h e r e  t o
'NOMOVE' t h e  program is
concerned with movement in
the X direction. First of all we
decrease 'MV1.00r, and if it
hasn't reached zero we branch
straight to'NOMOVE'. Next we
replace 'MVLOOP' with 20 for
the next time the routine is
called.
Remembering that X  still
contains t h e  v a lu e  f r o m
'10YREAD' we now test to see if
the joystick is being moved left
or right. If zero then branch to
'NOMOVE'; if 255 (left) then
branch to 'LEFTMV'. The next
15 lines move the Frog right by
one pixel, and are identical
except in reverse to 'LEFTMV',
so I'll just explain this section.
The ﬁrst thing we do is to
test how far to the right the frog
is situated on the screen. If this
has reached its maximum then
go to 'NOMOVE'. Otherwise
we have two loops which in-
crease all the X positions in the
frog printing tables XTAB1 and
XTABlE3.
Whic h b r i n g s  u s  t o
'NOMOVE'. From here to the
end of the routine we have a
short piec e o f  c ode which
causes new puddles to appear
on the road, but this will have
no ef f ec t  u n t i l  t h e  f u l l
•ROADFILL' routine is added
next month. It starts off by
decreasing a large two byte
delay c ons is ting o f  t h e
variables 'CRATEDEL' as low-
byte and 'CRATEDEL2' as high
byte, with a total delay value of
10*256
the routine will be used only
every 2560th time.
Next we increase 'RAND-
POS' the position in our table
52
.•-••••••••••/
of random values 'RANDIAB'.
If the value at this position is
zero, then we branch to the
end of the routine, 'NOCRAT'.
If the value is one then we start
a new puddle by storing 10 (the
length o f  a  p u d d le )  i n
'CRATER'. If it is 255 then we
have reached the end of the
table and so reset 'RANDPOS'
to zero. (If you are wondering
about the label names, the
puddles started off by being
black craters -  but then I
thought they looked better as
blue puddles!)
Now w e have arrived at
'PRBLDNG' -  whic h i f  y ou
haven't already guessed, is the
routine to print the buildings
on the far right of the screen as
each new character is needed.
First a breakdown of the vari-
ables used:
BIDNG1 -  start address o f
buildings table
BLDNGTYPE - current building
- 0 = no building
BLDNGSTAGE -  character
column in current building
Second a breakdown of the
routine:
Lines
6150-6160 -Store hi-byte of 'BLDNG1' in $FC
6170-6180-Check 'BLIDNGTYPE' to see if it is 0 - if yes go
to 'NOBLDNG'
6190-6270 -Decrease X (BIDNGTYPE): if not zero add 40
to A and repeat. (This sets up the correct
position in the building table for the current
building.)
6280-6410- Retrieve and print characters of building
pointed to by Y (BLDNGSTAGE)
6420-6470 - Increase 'BLDNGSTAGE' - if equal to 10 then
go to 'NEWBLDNG'
6480-6520 - Add 10 to the value in Y
6530-6650 - Reset •BIDNGSTAGE' to 0, get a new building
type f r o m  'BLDNGTAB' t o  p u t  i n t o
'BLDNGTYPE', and increase 'BLDNGPOS'
6660-6710 -Print a blank 'building' on the right of the
screen
6720-6790 - Increase 'BLDNGSTAGE'; if equal to 10 then
'NEWBLDNG'
6810-6840 - As last month
have it! Next
So there we
month w e have two super-
duper routines t o  print our
puddles and move and animate
the Frenchman. See you soon!

When you are designing a game one of the longest jobs is de-
signing the sprites. If you are good at art then ﬁne, if not your
next monster will probably end up looking like a square box
with legs.
Now, Your Commodore comes to the rescue once again
with Sprite Ideas. If you have designed any sprites for games
and you don't mind other people seeing your masterworks
then why not send them into us. Each month we will be offering
ﬂO for the best entries.
Your sprites can be anything at all (within reason), if you've
designed a series of animated characters then send in the lot.
We'd love to have a look at them.
So, next time you are after an Ogre to put in your new game,
have a look in this section of the magazine and you may ﬁnd
just what you are looking for.
This month we are pleased to print an excellent series of Pacman sprites

Eric Doyle has been wearing
out his joystick on
Mastertronic C-16 range.
SOFTWARE SUPPORT FOR THE C-16 IS
steadily growing and Mastertronic's range
of games offers good quality at the
extremely low price of 11.99 each.
I looked at seven of the titles: Turni
Frutti, Squirm, Vegas Jackpot, Big Mac,
BMX Racers and Formula 1 Simulator.
Despite the lack of detailed gameplay
instructions, I discovered the full rules by
trial and error, which added a bit of spice
to the early stages of playing.
Tutti Frutti was a prime example of
living by my wits. All you are told is that
"Your job is to collect all the cherries from
the orchard, as they are now ripe and it's
fruit picking time". The instructions then
warn the player not to stand under any
had apples and to avoid the members of
the acid apple gang. Beyond this you are
on your own.
My previous experience with the Mr
Do type of game helped me to cope with
the ﬁrst screen. This involved collecting
cherries while being pursued by the acid
apple gang. Donning my secret identity of
Super Strawberry, t h e  King o f  t h e
Orchard and burrowing through the
orchard t o collect the cherries was a
relatively simple task, despite the falling
apples and the attempts of the gang to foil
my efforts.
Apart from being a danger, the apples
can offer valuable assistance by blocking
the path of the gangsters or by crushing a
pursuer who gets underneath a falling
Granny Smith.
Although it is not mentioned in the
instructions, the strawberry does possess a
disk which can be thrown in the direction
of an attacker. If the disk misses its mark it
will bounce around the screen until Super
Strawberry collects it or it eventually hits
its mark when it will automatically return
to its  owner f o r  re-use, just lik e a
boomerang.
BY MASTERTRONIC
INF
Screen two offered more of the same
kind of problem but proved to be slightly
harder_ After harvesting the fruit I was
dismayed to ﬁnd that the screen didn't
change. Perplexed. I wandered about the
screen undermining apples and zapping
gangsters for the sake of something to do.
Still nothing happened until the penny
dropped or, more accurately, all of the
apples dropped_ To complete this phase
you had to get all of the apples to the
bottom of the screen. Easy once you know
the secret!
The third screen had me totally foxed
until I realised that the idea now was to
push cherry labelled boxes at the gang to
eliminate them all in a Pacman-like maze.
After eating cherries on all the other
screens a word of explanation would have
been nice here, Thank goodness I'd now
explored every type of screen because
from this point on, though the difﬁculty
level rises gradually, the cycle of screens
follows the same pattern ad inﬁniturn.
The next game for consideration was
Squirm, which at ﬁrst resembles our old
friend Pacman. In this game the mazes are
not inhabited with the usual ghosts but
with three long wriggling worm-like
creatures called squirms. O ne of  the
squirms lays eggs, as it negotiates the
pathways of the maze, the others collect
the eggs up again. I had to squeeze in
somewhere amongst all this so that !could
collect all the eggs before the squirms got
to them.
There was I ,  happily ignoring the
instructions, when all of a sudden the
lights go out and there I am in the dark
groping along the passage walls. T o
prevent this from happening you must
snap up the elusive glow worms which
appear from time to time.
Success brings screen after screen of
inventive mazes. This gives little time for
boredom to set in despite the lack of
variation in the gameplay and, just when
you think you've sussed it all out, nasty
little twists ar e introduced. As  y ou
disappear down an invisible wormhole
for the ﬁrst time, you wonder what on
earth is happening and you start to worry
once more about every move you make.
One of my all-time favourite games is
Boulderdash, which must surely have
inspired Mastertronic's Rockman_ Not
that the two games are alike in anything
other t h a n  t h e  general theme o f
collecting diamonds and avoiding falling
rocks. This epitomises what I like about
this series of games: although the themes
of the games follow traditional lines there
is an obvious attempt to innovate and to
create interesting fusions of ideas rather
than jus t doing a  cheap copy o f  a
successful game.
The place is Africa in the 1890's and
mining fever has struck Ricky Rockman.
His self-imposed task is  t o  collect

diamonds by dashing about the screen
pushing boulders around and avoiding
the baddies, a deﬁnite case of only being
here for De Bere.
The game blends quick thinking with
strategy, t w o  almos t contradictory
requirements because the speed at which
Ricky's air runs out leaves very little time
to plan a route and calculate the conse-
quences of your actions. The random
element o f  baddies wandering about
undermining rocks and generally messing
up your strategy only adds to the feeling
of panic.
Given that all of the diamonds are
recoverable, the strategem involves how

R e v ie ws
to move the rocks and in what order the
diamonds must be tackled. One wrong
move and a gem will be trapped forever.
Success is  rewarded by  the exit sign
ﬂashing but what if  the doorway has
become blocked by falling debris? Have
no fear, another exit appears elsewhere
and if you die in your attempts to reach
the door the game resets the boulders to
their original position and all you have to
do is to dash for the exit.
All in all, it's great entertainment for
gamesters with trogladytic tendencies.
Las Vegas is the gambling capital of the
world, Monaco without the monacle, the
brashest side of the American dream. This
forms a  ﬁtting backdrop f o r  Vegas
Jackpot, the fruit machine simulator. The
strange fascination which the good old
one-armed bandits holds is a mystery to
me but addictive they certainly are. Even
when the money is only an electrical
impulse in the heart of the machine the
compulsion to play is still there. Perhaps it
is the crude analogy to life in this tech-
noc r atic  s o c ie t y .  Pe r h a p s  t h e
man/machine interface has become a
crucial element in society. Perhaps I'd
better get on and review this game!
The object of the game is to break the
bank by winning more than f  250. You
start the game with f100 and each pull of
the lever costs f t  How you play is your
own decision. You can pump the machine
full of cash or you can feed it up as you go
along. The winning 250 quid has to be in
your possession, not in the machine, so I
found that my tactic was to keep feeding
in the cash in ﬂO blocks.
The machine resembles a normal four
drum fruit machine with all the usual
features: cherries, melons, lemons etc.
Reading from the left of the display, if a
row of two or more of the same fruit is
revealed at the end of a spin, a sum of
money is awarded depending on the
number in the row and the probability of
the combination appearing.
A win allows you to gamble or just to
collect your winnings. I f  you gamble
successfully y ou are allowed another
gamble and so on until you decide to quit
while the going's good or the win equals
000. After a little while I found that I
could successfully time my gamble to win
every time. After two or three such wins
Galley 89/c16-mastertronic/3
Alternatively, some of the fruits have
numbers and if a row has a value greater
than six a number of nudges are awarded.
These nudges may also be gambled but
the stakes are higher because a nudge
nearly always given a  win but if  you
gamble you can lose all your nudges and
be left with nothing more than a free spin.
If a higher winning value was set for
this game it  would have been more
challenging And the graphical represen-
tation is adequate but I feel it could have
been given greater aesthetic appeal.
More Adventurers of Big Mac the Mad
Maintenance Man has as much to do with
hamburgers and clowns called Ronald as
it has to do with maintenance work. What
it actually involves is a secret agent whose
mission is to close down an enemy power
plant. The air in each chamber of the plant
is limited so the work has to be done
quickly_
The ﬁrst few problems are simply a
matter of timing but gradually more and
more thought has to go into the game.
Zapping guns and levers to pull, as well as
collapsing ﬂoors all add to the nightmare.
One excellent game feature is the
ability to skip through all of the screens
you have completed in previous games at
the beginning of a new game. This means
tht you can progress faster and see what
the game has to offer. If only this kind of
facility was included in every multiscreen
epic. A coded entry at the beginning of a
session would have been even better so
that you could carry your progress on
from day to day.
The graphics are simple but effective
and some of the strategy problems are
very difﬁcult to crack because, on the
later screens, the ex it is  not usually
57
revealed until near the end. By this time
you've probably destroyed the only route
available and keyboard suicide is the only
way out.
This was one of my two ﬁrm favourites,
unlike BMX Racers with which I was most
impressed until the bugs bit.
The idea behind BMX is to negotiate
courses as quickly as possible, collecting
ﬂags and energy on the way. Playing each
track is challenging but there are more
challenges here than was ever dreamed of
in Mastertronic's philosophy, methinks.
No d o u b t  they  w ould rather I
described these 'extra' features as a
characteristic of the game, in much the
same way as  a  c ar salesman would
describe a scratch on a new Rolls Royce as
a street-cred feature and charge extra for
it. Bugs. I call them, for bugs they are. Is it
fair that a  game whic h has t o  b e
completed as quickly as possible does
not allow you to accelerate across the

ﬁnish line? Actually, to be fair, it does
allow the acceleration but it does not
detect your bike crossing the line so you
disappear off the top of the screen into a
netherworld where you must wait until
your energy runs out. Similarly if you are
picking up a ﬂag or an energy pill you fail
if you are accelerating. Even some of the
obstacles can be passed by accelerating
through them.
The scoring system leaves a lot to be
desired as well. Slow progress is rewarded
with a higher score than a fast run because
score increases with time. The essential
element of a race is that of time, and
convention states that the faster the
competitor the greater the reward. Still,
Mastertronic br ok e w it h  convention
when they were the ﬁrst to venture into
low price products so perhaps they are
ready now to challenge game concepts as
well.
My last beef relates to the power pills
at the end of the second screen: why can't
I pick it up?. Perhaps there are no more

Rev lows
screens beyond it -another revolutionary
concept!
Come on Mastertronic get your act
into gear. You can produce good quality
stuff so make sure that you play test
sufﬁciently to get rid of such obvious
problems.
Turning now from the dross to the
gloss, Formula 1 Simulator is hard to beat.
As more and more driving simulators
appear, it is heartening to see that at least
one company can produce a game which
occupies so little memory and costs so
little money but can seriously take its
place amongst the rest and wipe the ﬂoor
with most.
The quality of the graphics is ﬁrst class
giving a smooth scrolling horizon with
features such as skyscrapers and bridges
which help y ou t o  work  o u t  y our
orientation on the course. Using these
landmarks, you soon learn which way the
next bend is liable to go and can align
your car accordingly.

conﬁrmation of the degree of directional
change is given by  a rotating steering
wheel which allows you to make ﬁne
adjustments in alignment.
The idea is to complete as many laps of

limit which is displayed to the left of the

not be disappointed, I will venture to
arrange t h e m  i n  s ome o r d e r  o f
preference.
Formula 1 Simulator and Big Mac !ﬁnd
hard to separate as equal favourites. This is
because they  test different abilities.
Formula 1  is  all action but Big Mac
requires a  l o t  o f  t h o u g h t  a n d
perseverence.
Rockman is extremely challenging but
not as varied as Mac, but beats Squirm and
Tutti Frutti for the same reasons.
Vegas Jackpot comes at the bottom of
this list purely because it is such an oddity.
You either like fruit machines or you
don't. Personally, I enjoyed the game but
the skill demanded is minimal.
Oh yes, there's still BMX Racers to
evaluate, I'd almost forgotten. Thank
goodness!
I am amazed at the value of Master-
tronic's catalogue of games. Admittedly
there are several which even they would
prefer to forget, but in general the quality
is excellent when weighed up against
price. I remember the caution with which
I received their ﬁrst offerings and as for
selling computer games in newsagents!
OK so everyone makes the odd mistake,
I'm not infallible.
Next month I hope to cast a wary eye
over Gremlin Graphics assortment for the
C-16 - Gremlin seems very pleased with
them. Wa t c h  t h i s  s pac e f o r  a n

We make life easier I
for you with our
machine code entry
program.
THE WORST THING ABOUT
Machine Code programming is
entering thousands of numbers
and then ﬁnding that t h e
program will not work. There is
nothing else that you can do
apart from go through all of the
listing trying t o  locate that
mistyped character w hic h
prevents the program fr om
working correctly.
Now there's an easier way
to enter your machine code
programs. With the Your Com-
modore machine code entry
program, each line of numbers
is checked as soon as you press
return. I f  you have made a
mistake you will be asked to re-
type the last line. Another
added bonus is that you can
save what you have entered at
any time to tape or disk and
carry on where you left off next
time y o u  c o m e  t o  y o u r
computer.
Using the Loader
Before you type in any machine
code program you must have
typed in  the machine code
entry program and have i t
saved onto tape or disk. When
you want to enter any of the
machine code programs that
are printed out in the form
used by this program you must
LOAD it into your computer.
When you RUN the program
you will be asked for the start
address of the program. The
start address is the ﬁrst number
in any machine code listing that
appears before the colon (e.g.
491520. You simply type in this
number and press return.
All that you have to do from
then o n  is  type i n  all the
numbers on a line. Do not type
any spaces and do not type
return, the program will do all
of that for you. If you have
made a mistake on any line the
computer will ask you to type
the line again. Once the line is
entered c o r r e c t l y  t h e
computer w i l l  automatically
prompt you for the next line of
data,
Saving and Loading
You can save your data to tape
or disk at any time by simply
entering the Fl key as the ﬁrst
character on any line. You will
then be asked for the start and
end address of the save. The
start address is the ﬁrst number
in t h e  lis ting as  already
mentioned. The end address is
the number of the last line plus
11. Don't forget to add 11 or the
last line entered will not be
saved.
To load back a program that
you have saved y ou simply
have to enter the F3 key as the
ﬁrst item on a line. You will
then be asked for the name of

Steve Carrie provides
an excellent extended
Basic with built in
assembler.
THIS PROGRAM IS A BASIC
extension which, in addition to
adding a few useful commands
to t h e  resident Basic, also
includes a n  in - lin e  6502
assembler.
The main code sits in 4K of
memory from $9000 to $
(36864 to 40959). This means
that there is 4K less Basic text
space. However, this  does
leave the memory from $C000
(49152) onwar ds  f r e e  f o r
machine code programs.
Both tape and disk users
may make use of this program.
For disk users there are a
couple of disk commands to
make life easier.
Entering The Program
First type in the small Basic
loader program. This will be
used to load in and initialise the
ﬁnished program. II you are
using tape, save this as the ﬁrst
program on the tape with the
ﬁnished utility after it.
Now type in and save the
four main Basic listings before
attempting to run them. Each
program performs a check on
the data to help guard against
errors. If an error is detected,
the line number is printed and
execution aborted.
Program f o u r  inc ludes
instructions to save the ﬁnished
program to a storage device. Be
sure t o  change the device

The Assembler
The assembler h a s  b e e n
designed to work interactively
with Basic. Source code is held
in REM statements within a
Basic program and assembled
using the ASSEMBLE command.
Basic variables may be passed
to the assembler and different
sections o f  c ode selectively
assembled. The SET command
is used to pass a value from the
assembler to a Basic variable.
A typical program format is
shown below. This  s imple
program uses a machine-code
subroutine t o  c hange t h e

line 10 - instructs Basic to pass
control to the assembler, begin
assembling a t  line 100 and
initialise the symbol table. If S
was used instead of I — e.g.
ASSEMBLE 100,5 — then the
symbol table would not be
cleared. This is useful when
1

assembling multiple sections of
code using the same symbols.
(See Special Features section).
Line 20 —  O n  return from
assembly, the Basic variable A is
given the value of assembler
symbol START.
Line 30 — This is then used to
call up the machine code.
Line 40 — Stops the program.
Because the source code is in
REMs, leaving out this line
would not incur an error.
Line 100 — This sets the start of
code to 49152 ($C000). The *
directive must always be the
ﬁrst instruction in any source
code program. (See Special
Features section).
Line 110 — This sets the symbol
BORDER to 53280.
Line 120 — The ! provides a
means of inserting commands

Special functions
The code origin directive* may
be used i n  a  special way.
Consider t h e  f o l l o w i n g
example.
Two separate programs are
required t o  ﬁll consecutive
blocks of memory begining at
49152 (SC000). T h e  ﬁr s t
program declares all symbols to
be used. The second program
therefore requires the symbol
table intac t. T h e  s ec ond
program may  als o deﬁne
symbols but not those deﬁned
in t h e  ﬁrst program. An y
symbols deﬁned here cannot
be u s e d  b y  pr ec eeding

In Program 2 ,  t he code
origin directive was given no
address. This reads as "follow

careful with this one. Besure to
give the full command if no
follow-on i s  required. This
follow-on feature allows large
linked ﬁles to be assembled.
The main limiting factor is the
symbol table.

[handy routines for

the screen.
THIS MONTH I  WANT T O
touch o n the well thrashed
subject of scrolls. As you will be
aware, scrolling is used as a
basis for many of the arcade
games av ailable. Initially ,
games used character scrolls
but with the hardware features
of the C64. single pixel scrolls
are possible.
When preparing this article,
I had t o  make the choice
between providing a versatile
character scroll package or a
less versatile character scroll.
Since many readers will have
interestes beyond the writing
of arcade games. I will cover
the former but with a view to
covering pixel scrolls at a later
date.
The loader  lis ted her e
provides the facilities to per-
form horizontal scrolls and
rolls. In part two, I will look at
vertical movement. So what are
scrolls and rolls. Well, both
involve the movement of the
contents of an area of screen.
In the case of a scroll, the
screen contents are lost as they
scroll - to be replaced with new
information. In this package,
spaces are inserted.
Consider a scroll to the left.
The screen area is moved to the
left, the leftmost column of
characters is lost. The screen
area is  simultaneously r e-
plenished b y  a  column o f
spaces on the right. In the case
of a  r oll,  t h e  column o f
characters leaving the area is
put on the other side of the
area giving continuous motion
of the screen -  just lik e a
conveyor belt.
Both scrolls and rolls have
their value, A  scroll is most
useful for the presentation of a
stream of information which is
longer than the screen area
involved, This could be a piece
of landscape in an arcade game
or a long piece of text. A roll is
suited t o  t h e  r epetitiv e
movement of a short piece on
information.
The commands to control
the scrolls and rolls have the
simple form:
SYS SA,TL,BL,FLAG1,FLAG2,NS
Where S A  =  49152 f o r
movement to the right and SA=
49155 for movement to the left.
TL speciﬁes the top line of
the area moved. The top of the
screen is line O. BL speciﬁes the
bottom line of the area moved,
The bottom of the screen has a
value o f  24. The commands
move the full width o f  the
screen.
FLAG1 speciﬁes the type of
movement:
FLAG 1 = 0 for a scroll
FLAG1 = 1 for a roll
FLAG2 speciﬁes the informa-
tion moved: Bit 0 controls the
characters and bit 1 controls
the colours.
Hence: •
FLAG2 1  moves the characters
only
FLAG2 = 2 moves the colours
only
FLAG2 = 3 moves both the
colours and characters
NS speciﬁes the number of
characters moved each time
the routine is called.
I mentioned earlier that
scrolls place a space in the new
column o f  the screen after
moving the information. In the
case of the colour scrolls, the
colour in the new column is set
to the current cursor colour.
I have provided the option
to move both colours and
characters since it is possible to
achieve s ome inter es ting
effects. T r y , f o r  example,
moving t h e  c olour s  a n d
characters i n  o p p o s i t e
directions.
Two demonstration listings
are provided to give an idea
how the routines are used. I
hope you ﬁnd them of value.

A number of people noticed
the absence of the demonstra-

issue of Your Commodore.
Sorry, the listing did get
missed, so it is printed here for
all those who are waiting to see
just what this superb package
can do.

directories with this
handy utility from
RI Miller
HAVE YO U  EVER WISHED
that you could make your disk
directories look a little more
interesting? Would you like
them to give you a little more
information? Now they can.
Rainbow Disk allows you to
split the disk directory into a
number of different coloured
sections.
Now you may have the
games on your disk highlighted
in red, your utilities could be
green and you could have a
blue section for data ﬁles.
Rainbow Disk is a  Basic
program and you should have
no problems typing i t  in .
However do make sure that
you save it before attempting
to RUN it.
Pretty Colours
Rainbow Disk is very easy to
use. You should ﬁrst design a
section divider by following
the on screen prompts, you can
even p u t  i n  y o u r  o w n
messages. Then when this
divider is stored on to disk all
ﬁles that appear below it will
appear in the new colour until
a new divider is reached.
Rainbow D i s k  i s  a n
extremely good addition to the
Disk Orderly program by Les
Allan featured in the October
1985 issue of Your Commo-
dore. Simply append a range of
coloured dividers to the end of
the disk and then use Disk
Orderly to sort all of the ﬁles
into the order that you require.

Your powers of
'deduction are tested
Ito the full by this
!program from D
Waldron*
YOU HAVE BEEN SET THE TASK
of ﬁnding ﬁve mines that the
evil Seepeayu has planted
within a grid. Your equipment
consists of an electron beam
emitter which can be ﬁred into
the grid. The mines affect your
beam depending on how near
to them the ray passes. Your ray
may pass straight through the
grid, it may be absorbed, it
could even be reﬂected back
on itself. You have to decide
where the ﬁve mines are by
studying what happens to your
rays.
In this game the idea is to
score as few points as possible.
You are awarded points for
each ray that you shoot and
each m in e  that y ou guess
incorrectly_
Full in s t r u c t io n s  a r e
included in the program.
No problems should b e
encountered when entering
the program but do make sure
that you read the LISTINGS
page to be found elsewhere in
this issue so that you under-
stand what all the mnemonics
mean,

Stuart Cooke opted out of
the rat race for a while to
look at the MS2000 mouse.
EVER SINCE COMPUTERS WERE
invented people have been trying to ﬁnd
some way of making them easier to use so
that John Smith can sit down at the
computer terminal and start work without
too much instruction.
One day some bright spark invented
the mouse, so called because it was a small
box that connected to the computer by a
long lead which looks rather lik e a
mouse's tail. Apple used a mouse to its
beneﬁt when it launched the Macintosh
computer. All software designed for this
machine is under control of the mouse.
No longer do you have to enter long
instructions you simply have to select one
of the pull down menus with the mouse
and make the appropriate choice o f
command.
Now Wigmore House has launched
the MS2000 mouse so that Commodore
owners can get a look at these exciting
devices.
First impressions
The M52000 comes complete with an
'advanced graphics' programs and a 13
page photocopied manual. The mouse
itself is  quite small a n d  v ery  w ell
constructed. Examining the underside of
the mouse reveals the rubber coated ball.
II is this ball that moves when the mouse is
dragged around your desk. The rubber
(oating gives good traction o n  most
surfaces. The ball is easily removed by
means of a sliding panel. Removal of the
ball is essential from time to time for
cleaning as when moving around the desk
the ball is bound to get covered in some
rubbish.
Documentation
S o f
In Use
Say Cheese
The manual is adequate and the only
problem is that a large amount of what I
consider to be necessary information is
missing.
How to load the software is covered in
detail and there is a general description of
how to use the mouse.
Most of the manual is given over to an
explanation of the graphics package. Each
available c ommand i s  d e a lt  w i t h
individually, each command being given
a short but useful description.
What is missing from the manual is a
detailed description o f  t h e  mous e
operation. No mention is made of how
you can use the mouse in your own
programs, how to detect the position of
the mouse or check whether either of the
two buttons are pressed. Surely this is a
serious omission as many people will want
to write their own programs that use the
mouse,
Moving the cursor to an icon, a small
picture, on the screen and pressing one of
the buttons will cause a speciﬁc action to
take place. For example moving the
pointer to the magnifying glass will cause
an area of the screen to be enlarged.
As previously mentioned the software
supplied with the mouse is a fairly comp-
rehensive graphics package. The mouse is
used not only to select options from the
menu but also t o draw on the high
resolution screen.
The ﬁrst thing that you notice about the
package, when you come to use it, is a
certain lack of 'professionalism'. Firstly,
there is no turbo loader on the graphics
package, though it is quite short and
doesn't take too long to load. Secondly,
the program does not auto run, you have
to type SYS 4096 after loading. It's a simple
82
matter to get a program to auto run thus
making it easier to get going.
Mice may be extremely easy items to
use but they do have their drawbacks. If
like me, you only see the wood on your
desk once a year when you have a mass
tidy, you'll soon run into problems. You
need quite a bit of desk space to use the
mouse.
Basically, the mouse is used to move a
pointer on screen, every movement of the
mouse being mimicked by the pointer.
Therefore, to move the cursor you simply
move the mouse across the desk, or in my
case across the books, letters, cassettes
and c offee c ups . N o  d o u b t  y o u
understand the problem.
The drawing package has  thr ee
different menus. Because of lack of space
on the screen, only one of these can be
seen at any one time. To select the menus
the pointer is simply moved to an icon
that looks lik e a rabbit, pressing the
button will then cause each menu to be
displayed in turn. Yes, that's right a rabbit.
Well the program is called CHEESE and is
controlled by a mouse so why not have a
rabbit? Oh, by the way, there is also an
undo function in  case you make any
mistakes. Undo erases the last thing done
to the graphics screen. What I can't ﬁgure
out is why this looks like a cat.
Because the program is so compre-
hensive it is probably worth mentioning
each function in turn.
Main Menu
The main menu consists of three icons:
The previous mentioned undo and menu
select icons, and one to select the tile
pattern. Whenever you ﬁll in an area on
the screen it is ﬁlled with this pattern.
There are 32 different tile options ranging
from a solid to ones that look like building
bricks. The inkpot icon and pencil icon
are also always available. These are used
to select the border and pen colour
respectively. An icon that looks like a
canvas is used to change the background
colour.

•
H a r d w a r e
Now on to the other functions.
It is possible to draw straight lines with
the straight line function. The mouse is
moved to one end of the line, the button
pressed, and the mouse again moved. The
line then follows behind the mouse
drawing a straight line from its starting
point. Freehand continuous and dotted
drawing are also provided. The thickness
of the line that you draw can also be
changed by the pencil icon.
It is  possible t o  draw circles and
rectangles and these can be either outline
of ﬁlled. Remember, if you select ﬁll, then
the current tile pattern will be used. A
picture of two icecream cones is used to
select the palate. This allows you t o
change one colour on screen to another.
Not only is it possible to ﬁll in circles
and boxes but it is possible to ﬁll an
irregular area on screen with the paint
brush icon. Again this uses the tile
patterns. Not only can you ﬁll areas with a
tile pattern but you can also use a spray
be available and will have a disk

can effect to ﬁll an area with dots, the
longer you leave the can over a speciﬁc
area the more dots ﬁll it, just like the ones
used to paint cars.
The actual drawing area that can be
seen on the screen at any one time is
smaller than the actual canvas. The scroll
icon is used to move the canvas up and
down so that you can work on the whole
area.
Rectangular areas of the canvas can be
copied. The size of the rectangle is left up
to you. I t  is also possible t o reverse
rectangular areas on the screen. You can
ﬂip the rectangle either horizonally or
vertically. A  mirror function is  also
available. This will allow you to mirror
whatever y o u  d o  across horizontal,
vertical and diagonal axis.
When ﬁnished you are able to save
your pictures on to tape or get a printout
on a Commodore compatible printer.
No provision is  made to save the V e r d i c t
pictures to disk, though I am told that a
cartridge version of the software will soon

)k Little Extra
A small section at the rear of the manual
explains how you can make the mouse
emulate a joystick by  turning on the
computer while a button is held down on
the mouse. This will allow you to use the
mouse with any software which uses a
joystick. This is very handy, though i
found it  wasn't too good for playing
games with and I did come across a small
problem with this. When you power on
your CM with the mouse attached, the
mouse continuously sends its position to
the CM. Because some of the joystick
positions cause characters to be printed
on screen you ﬁnd that a continuous
stream of spurious characters appear on
screen making it impossible to type in
anything on the keyboard, essential if you
want to load a game.
Even though I have mentioned a couple
of gripes about the MS2000 it cannot be
denied that it would make an excellent
addition to any CM. The construction of
the mouse is excellent and if you are into
graphics then the package is very good.
It's also great fun.

such as Warp 5, and individual loaders
produced by software houses for their
own use. Now we are in the best stages of
cartridge based turbo loaders,
Here, I have written about just two
from the half-dozen good ones that are
now available. One is comparatively low
priced, the other relatively high priced
but neither are simple turbo-loaders.
Both offer features which, I feel, make
them good value for money and because
of that a direct comparison would be
unfair so they must be looked at as
different add-ons with only fast loading in
common.
Limitations
One thing that I have not seen on any fast-
loader is the ability to fast load everything.
This is in many cases due to conﬂiction of
memory, where the fast loader is RAM
based, or  due t o the fact that some
software uses its own load routines. In the
early days of fast loading, any attempt to
fast load software such as Easy-Script and
Superbase resulted i n  t he machine
hanging up. But from what I have seen
recently it would seem that most loaders
now revert to normal loading if there is
going to be problems. This prevents much
plug pulling and switch switching in order
to get going again.
The Final Cartridge
This is much more than a fast loader. It is a
tool kit, a printer interface, and a monitor.
At ﬁrst look it seems quite expensive but
when you consider what the above would
cost as individual items it really is a good
buy.
On the top of the cartridge there is a
switch and a button. The switch allows
you to switch off the cartridge without
having to remove it which does save
considerable w e a r  o n  t h e  e d g e
connector, and the button allows you to
Screen dump from doodle using the Final Cartridge

reset the 64 for whatever reason you want.
I have read that pressing "reset" and "Q"
together results in  even un-resetable
programs resetting. Very useful at times. I
suspect that my manual was a pre-release
manual as I could ﬁnd no reference to this
fact though I must say that, on the whole.
the manual was still very good.
Function Keys
The Final Cartridge has been so well
thought out that the 'new' operating
system provides pre-deﬁnes those near
useless function keys. As soon as you plug
in, pressing the function keys give you
single key LIST. MONITOR, RUN, OFF.
DLOAD, DSAVE, CATALOG, and ﬁnally
Fﬁ gives y o u  various disk routines
84
including format. You may think that
having these keys pre-deﬁned will inter-
fere with anything that a program may try
to do with the keys. That did occur to me
but not until after I realised that I had
already been using programs that deﬁned
the keys for their own use a ﬂyway, such as
Micro-Simplex. With all the software I
tried I had no problems whatsoever.
Toolkit
There are many different kinds of tool kits
offering graphics aids, audio aids and so
on. This one is simply a programmer's aid
which helps  speed u p  and simplify
programming. Because of this you can
save a ﬁnished program and run it on a
machine without having to have the car-

tridge in place. Using toolkits which offer
special commands c an often cause
problems, as  r unning t h e  program
requires the presence o f  the toolk it
Commands supported b y  t h e  ﬁnal
cartridge are:
1. RENUMBER -  including GOTOS and
GOSUBS
2. APPEND - loads a second program on to
the end of a program resident in RAM.
3. AUTO -  automatically offers line
numbers when writing a Basic program.
The start number and increment are
entered in the form AUTO 10,10 and line
numbers 10,20,30,40 and so on are added
automatically.
6. HELP - when a program stops due to
syntax error typing HELP will present the
line number on screen and show you
exactly where the problem occurred.
5. FIND - search through a program and
displays the line numbers of any line
containing the target word. e.g. FIND
PRINT w o u l d  dis play  ev er y  l i n e
containing the command PRINT.
6. DEL used in the same format as AUTO,
DEL will delete any line numbers between
those speciﬁed. Useful in conjunction
with RENUMBER as it makes it easy to
move sub-routines around.
7. OLD - if you have ever typed NEW and
then realised you had forgotten to save
your program simply type OLD and it
reappears. Saves much hair-tearing and
computer hitting.
S. LIST - this is a simple listing command.
Will lis t some programs that cannot
otherwise be listed.
The rest of the toolkit commands are
concerned w it h  t h e  Disk Operating
system.
1. CATALOG -  displays on screen the
catalog of a disk without overwriting the
program in memory. Should have been
on the 64 to start with.
2. DSAVE - TURBO'SAVES• a program to
disk.
3. D1OAD -  single key stroke version of
LOAD.8,1 S i m p l y  t y p e  D L O A D
PROGNAME,
4. DVERIFY -  verify program written to
disk,
Though not the most comprehensive
toolkit does contain the most commonly
used commands quite impressive.
Monitor
The monitor, built-in and accessed by
pressing F2, is the same as the monitors
found on the larger commands. Here the
manual is a little presumptive and so if you
are not familiar with a monitor a good
book would help. Nice to have a good
monitor immediately to hand.
Printe dace
Used in conjunction with a Centronics
lead t he ﬁnal cartridge provides an
excellent Centronics interface. And with a
good Epson-type printer more or less
anything can be produced. Particularly
nice is the screen dump facility.
Pressing RESET and The CONTROL
key followed by a function key allows you
to get a screen dump of a text or high res-
olution screen. The dump of the high
resolution screen is  faithful copy o f
whatever was on the screen. But it will not
print out sprites. Using this I can now
dump some of the graphics I have been
unable to dump by any other means. Of
course i f  y ou are doing a dump o f
commercial software it does remove the
program from RAM and so you need to
re-load to continue. But I can live with
that.
Finally
I would buy the Final cartridge just on the
strength of its other facilities. Having a fast
loader is a bonus. There are some titles
that it  will not turbo-load but on the
whole it copes with most, At least it does
not hang up if you try to turbo.
Using the Final cartridge in conjunc-
tion with Micro Simplex was super. Any-
body who uses Simplex will know that
waiting for it to load its various functions is
a little tedious. With The Final Cartridge
the main program loads in 12 seconds -
Sub programs in about six. To conclude,
The Final Cartridge is by no means cheap.
But imagine buying a cartridge based fast-
loader, toolkit, printer interface and
screen dump cartridge separately. I would
be surprised if you had change from 180.

Trilogics CT Loader
The second cartridge I had the pleasure to
use was the Trilogic Cartridge.
Certainly it does not have the range of
facilities that the Final cartridge can boast
but it costs about 130 less.
This too has an on/off switch and one
version also has a reset switch. This idea
could well spread to more cartridges as
the damage cause to edge connectors by
rough pushing in and pulling out of
cartridge results in ﬂoppy results in ﬂoppy
cartridges and thus constant hang-ups.
Essentially, Trilogic's cartridge is a fast-
loader. Speed increases are certainly very
noticeable and about as fast as the Final
Cartridge. One nice touch is that any
graphics which are supposed to be on
screen, as the program loads, remain
there - very reassuring. There is nothing
more disconcerting than sitting in front of
a blank screen when you know that under
normal conditions you normally see ﬂags
85
maidens, a n d  s k ulls  giv ing v is ual
conﬁrmation that at least something is
going on.
Auto Switch Oft
As it happens this cartridge also leaves the
loading process alone if there are any
problems and s o loading reverts t o
normal, though I  found most of the
popular games loaded without any
problems -  even difﬁcult multi-part
games. I personally had no success with
Summer Games but I suspect that this was
due to mis-alignment of my drive heads
rather than the cartridge. It may be worth
pointing out here that if your drive is not
in top physical condition, fast loaders
seem to accentuate the problem. A drive
in good condition should behave as
normal. If you are having little success
with fast loaders or gradually start to ﬁnd
that programs will not verify or load then
head-alignment could be the problem.
Printing
A problem I  did ﬁnd when using the
Erilogic c a r t r id g e a l o n g  w i t h  a
Commodore printer was that nothing
happened. It would not even cough!
Tri logic acknowledges this and it is not
exactly a fault. But if you are using a
program which has to load from within
the program and print out as well, you will
need to switch the cartridge on and off
between printing. Once you get used to it
there is no problem, but its  rather a
ﬁddle.
I used this cartridge with Micro-
Simplex and it performed well, Loading
times were much the same and it made
using Simplex  almos t a  pleasure.
However, a  program such as  this
accentuates its inability to print with the
cartridge on.
Some disk commands are added with
the cartridge and in most cases there is no
need to sufﬁx load commands with ".8.
This is thoughtful and useful, and so the
correct syntax for  loading a program
becomes LOAD"PROGNAME".
If a directory of the disk is loaded the
programs are shown with colons where
needed and so, to load a program, you
simply cursor down t o  the relevant
program and type 10 (I shifted o):.
If y o u  l o a d  t h e  greater s ign,
LOAD" " t h e  error channel will be read
and displayed, much better than open
15,8,15 and so on.
I liked this cartridge very much and if I
had to b
many that cost more and since it has been
released it has dropped in price.

SOFTIORE FOR
Save your ﬁngers a lot of
work with our new software
service.
IT'S THREE O'CLOCK IN THE MORNING.
You sit at the computer keyboard having
just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of the superb programs
from Your Commodore. Your ﬁngers
reach for the keyboard and press the
letters K .  U  and N / .  You sit back
expectantly and...nothing happens.
Well, I'm sure that we have all had
problem before now. When it  does
happen it's a matter of spending hours
searching through the program for any
typing mistakes. No matter how long you
look or how many people help you, you
can usually guarantee that at least one
little bug slips through unnoticed.
Here, at Your Commodore, we pride
ourselves on the quality of listing that we
print. Unfortunately, this usually means
that they are also very long, thus taking
longer to type in and leaving more room
for errors. All of the listings in Your
Commodore are taken straight from a
printout o f  working programs, i t  is
therefore very unusual for errors t o
appear in the magazine.
Because of the length of our programs
we do get a large number of requests from
readers who would like us to put speciﬁc
programs on tape or disk for them.
Obviously this is very time consuming and
means that we can't spend as much time
working on the magazine as we would
like.
We are therefore proud to announce
the start of the Your Commodore Soft-
ware Service'. Most of the programs from
each issue of the magazine will now be

available on a single cassette for a price of
just [4.00. We will not be making disks
available since they would have to be a lot
more expensive and more difﬁcult to
post. This shouldn't cause you any
problems though as none of the programs
will be protected and it will be a simple
matter to save the programs to disk
yourselves.
All programs on the cassette will be
saved using a  tape turbo routine.
However, we cannot guarantee that all
programs will work correctly with this
turbo routine present. W e  therefore
recommend that before you use any of
the programs you make a copy of the
programs on your own cassette or disk
and use this version of the program not
the original.
This month we are not only going to
make available most of the programs from
this issue o n  cassette, w e  are also

- the sophisticated spreadsheet
Easy to learn, easy to use - something that can't be said of many business programs,
But it's true of all the programs in the BUSICALC series.
BUSICALC 3 can handle all sorts of jobs - budgets, expenditure analysis, stock lists,
price lists, and product costing are just a few of the possibilities. Three-dimensional
formulae automatically access data stored on disk, so that you can easily pull
together information from several different sheets and summarise or manipulate it.
It's simple to transfer data to other programs such as Easy Script_ And you can use
virtually any printer with BUSICALC 3, whether dot matrix or daisy wheel,
Commodore or non-Commodore.
For the CBM 64 and PET/CBM 4000 & 8000 series.
