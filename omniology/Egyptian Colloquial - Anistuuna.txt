A writer's prayer 
God, I have knowledge, 
So will you show me now 
How to use it wisely 
And find a way somehow 
To make the world I live in 
A little better place.. 
And make life with its problems 
A bit easier to face.. 
Grant me faith and courage 
And put purpose in my days.. 
And show me how to serve Thee 
In the most effective ways 
So all my education, 
My knowledge and my skill, 
May find their true fulfillment 
As I learn to do Thy Will 
And may I ever be aware 
In everything I do 
That knowledge come from learning.. 
And wisdom comes from you.

INTRODUCTION 
Arabic is one of the major languages in the world. It is widely spread on two 
continents. 
It is the official language of about 22 countries with a total 
population of about 120 millions which places it among the top ten tongues of 
the planet in regard to the number of speakers. 
Arabic belongs to the Semitic family of languages and the term Arabic is used to 
describe two different classes or forms of the same language. 
The first is jGHa or the 'pure' language, and it involves two levels, the 
Classical Arabic which is the language of the 'Kur'aan' the holy book of Islam, 
and the Modem Standard Arabic or the Modem Literary Arabic. 
The second 1.s the ? m ~ \ ~ ~ a .  
. . 
which is the colloquial or the common language, 
and it is of three levels. the Educated Spoken Arabic, the Enlightened Spoken 
Arabic, and the Illiterate Spoken Arabic. 
The main object of this book is to introduce the Educated Spoken Arabic or 
Language which takes the two features of both fuSHa and ^amrniyya and which 
is a kind of reduced fuSHa and standardized colloquial. It is the spoken Arabic 
of Egypt which aims to provide easy access to the Arabic which Egyptians, 
particularly the educated of Cairo and Alexandria, learn in the house and use in 
every day life. 
Thus this course is based on a functional approach yet the essential rules of 
grammar, which only without which communication may fail, will be provided. 
The main emphasis though will be on conversational pieces with vocabulary 
expressions and some idiomatic formulas that are commonly used in everyday 
life. In other words, the language itself will be presented not theories about it. 
The main concern is to ensure that learners can speak and understand the 
language in the shortest time available and in the simplest way possible. In 
short, the focus will be on fluency rather than accuracy. The explanation, rules, 
and instructions are also provided in English to ensure full understanding. Also 
a good amount of drills & exercises are provided to guarantee reinforcement. 

This book consists of: 
First: 
Preliminary stage involving 4 stages. 
Second: Two units, each unit consists of 5 lessons one of which is a review for 
the 4 previous lessons. 
Third: 
Appendices A, B, C 
Fourth: Glossary 
Fifth: 
Useful vocabulary for survi~al Arabic 
The preliminary stage consists of the very basic rules that any beginner should 
be familiarized with, as an introductory stage that is essential to Arabic language 
learning. This section is sequenced according to students' level. The teacher 
begins with stage 1 if the students ha\-e no idea about the Arabic language script. 
The teacher may move to stage 2 if the students know the Alphabets well but do 
not know how to read or wnte. The teacher may, as well, move directly to stage 
3 if the students know the basic rules of the Arabic script and can fairly read or 
write. Stage 4 is a continuum of stage 3. 
Each lesson begins with a picture, which illustrates the main objective of the 
lesson. 
In order to help students develop the language as fast as possible and to acquire 
native like pronunciation and intonation, a tape is also provided together with 
flashcards to challenge the students and enhance their listening comprehension. 
Reading comprehension and creating conversational skits are also reinforced. 
As the colloquial is basically the spoken language, listening and speaking are the 
two skills of the language that are intensively emphasized. Reading and writing 
are only used as a guide for students on learning the language and implementing 
their assignments. 
Some appendices are also added at the end for further instruction. 
A Glossary is also provided. 
A group of useful vocabulary words, which non-native speakers may need, to 
survive with Arabic at the very beginning.

Note: 
- ' is also called a glottal stop and it should precede all vowels when they occur at the 
1 
beginning of the word. In Arabic it may appear anywhere in the word beginning, 
! 
middle or end, or even, doubled. 
Example: 
*akl - 
baypi 
- 
badd - 
rn 8 and A are produced in modern standard Arabic only i-e. FuSHa (&/A) . 
. 
* H, i, c, t, 
have no equivalent in English (21~) 
. 
4 f One dupe to describe one sound. The idea of combining two letten to describe one 
sound does not exist in Arabic. Ex. ch / sh / th (2) . 
43 S, D, T and Z have no exact equivalent in ~ n ~ l i s h b u t  
they are the emphatic (velarized) 
version of the n o d  s, d, t and z (d/&h/b) / (&/i.~/b). 
How to produce the non-equivalent sounds 
* H sounds like a very emphatic h. (just imagine you have swallowed a spoonful of the 
hottest c h i  imaginable) (0. 
* x more guttural than its Scotch or German cousin (it is always better to exaggerate 
rather than under emphasize the guttural aspect) (^) ex. Van Gogh. 
* 
(peculiarity of the Semitic language) = to gag. constricting the muscles of the larynx 
so that the How of air through the throat is choked off (the voiced version of H). 
* it is the sound produced when gargling (similar to the very strongly rolled Parisian r). 
How to oroduce the Semi-eauivalent sounds 
To produce the glottal stop hawa '('19, a complete closure of the vocal cords is required, 
where compression of air is composed then a sudden blow of the air is produced. 
The Q (J) is like the normal K except that it is produced when the tongue is very far back 
in the throat roof of the mouth. 
The r 0) B more rolled than in English. 
The 1 (J) u not rolled as it is in English. 
The 'a' sound, that is used as a vowel, is sometimes velarized due to word context, as in: 
Arabic 
faar (mouse) 
faas 
(axe) 
English 
'ann 
'and

The Arabic Alphabet 
Note: The red line represents the iine on / under which the part of the letter should go. 

Characteristics of the Arabic Al~habet 
1. Many letters have the same shapes and the distinction is made only by the use of dots. 
j J 
i A 
- A -  A + A A +  
There is a great conformity in shape bemeen the letter when it appears at the 
beginning and when it appears at the h d ,  when it appears at the beginning (or in 
the middle) the bottom part only is deleted. 
Most of the letters have 3 forms, differing according to their location in the 
word, i.e. how they are joined with the other letters 
4. A repeated consonant is not written twice, rather a'cgJdy* is put on the letter instead. 
4 
5. There are 6 letters that cannot be connected to the following letters, but could be 
connected to the preceding ones only. 

9 
6. 
The Arabic language makes a clear distinction between masculine and feminine g e n k  
The feminine nouns are identified by the ("t" ~ b u u t a ~ l  
j) at the end. 
7. 
There is a letter that takes different shapes, even when it is in the same l o c a h  
(hanua " s "). (glottd stop) 
4 
(A)$$ 
( . 3 ) k J +  
8. 
There are four letters that are velarued (emphatic sounds) and they correspond to 
their non-velarized (non-emphatic sounds), such as: 
Emphatic sounds 
Non-emphatic sounds 
9. There arc 28 sounds (letters) in the Arabic language, 2 of which are considered semi- 
vowels because they can take both roles (consonant and vowel). If these two sounds 
are produced then they are consonants and not vowels. 
10. In almost all cams the d is read i in colloquial, except for a few words such as: 
- 
- 
taQ"ir J+& 
Qur9aan 
Qamuus ppu 
il Qaahira g J h u  
Qim dL, 
Q- 
J\A 
Qaanuun -u 
QmD &A 
11. The 
when is followed by "dip \ appears as such y , or 
if hand written. 
12.' P , j , v are loaned letters and written as such d 
c a 
c + 

General Rules for the Arabic Script 
1. 
There is a great deal of conformity between the letter and its sound. Almost wery word 
is written as it is pronounced. There is no opposition to be mentioned (whiie in English 
such opposition may occur; i.e. beard, heard, bird). 
2. 
Each letter should be emphasized or pronounced cIear!y. The notion of ueating" letters 
does not exist in the Arabic language, example: doing 
doin'. 
3. 
There is no capital letter. 
4. 
There is no verb "to be3 in Arabic ex. (idare) only the infinitive f
m
 i s 4  and the 
past tense (waslwere). 
5. 
Writing is from right to left: the opposite of all Latin languages. 
6. The Arabic letters are characterized by having ligatures that aiiow for connecting them 
together and therefore, from this point, there are no clear cut differences between the 
written words and the printed ones. 
7. The occurrence of 3 consonants is not allowed by any means. Any circumstances that 
may result with three consonants (as in the addition of suffies and prcfues), a vowel 
must be inserted right before the sufix or right after the pmfk This inserted vowd is in 
most cases the "i" sound. i.e. kusra. 
- 
8. 
Arabic language writing depends mainly on the cursive connecting system. 
9. 
What usuaily appears in writing is the consonants and the longvow&. Tl~eshort 
vowels appear only in the Qur'aan, dictionaries and primmy text books. 
10. Punctuation is not consistent and most writings neglect its us& The full stop appears 
mainly to separate paragraphs. The most commoniy used on- arc the full stop, comma 
and question mark. 

Consonants and Vowels 
-- 
- 
The Arabic language has 28 consonants (or sounds) 2 of which are semi- consonan-

Note: 
In this stage, focusing should only be on the shape of the letter as it appears in each 
location (beginning, middle and end). Reading or meaning is not necessary in this stage. 
All letters at the beginning or middle, are supposed to be written on the line except for 
3 -> J they go down the line no matter what their position is. 
Letters that have upper and bottom parts. 
t f / u / & S / d / f  t / D "  u^/& L ~ / C  C E 
This bottom part is lifted up on the line when they occur at the beginning or middle and 
bottom part appears again only when they occur at the end. 
Note: The upper pages (11&12) are repeated again. Please see end of the book to see how 
they can be used to help in reading.

(A) Short Vowels 
I^J-tH (I) 
There are 3 short vowels : FatUq Kiwa and l-bma 
the F d a  h expressed by 
x 
(corresponding toa sound) 
TheL-- - JS expressed by 
x 
(corresponding to i sound) 
the Damma is expressed by 
x 
(corresponding to u sound) 
Note: that x refera to any letter or sound. 
Every letter or consonant must have one of these short vow& t-il~>'(~arakant). 
Example: 
^ 
Ãˆ 
+ 
(ba 
bi 
bu) 
.- 
If any of the ktters does not have any of these vowels that means it is a no vowel 
situation and the letter appears with a 
-- Â£>J 
on top of i t  
0 
the Sukuun is expressed by x 
Example: 
4 
These short vow& duk are not part of the word structure They appear 
the 
letter as with the. 
and D~maorudertbektteraswiththe~ 
Read: 
A repeated consonant Is not written twice, rather a Jadda 
r instead. Thus 
the Jadda indicates 2 consonants, the first consonant always takes a "sukuun" sound and 
thenone of the 3 
with the second consonant. If the short vn-1

Masculine and Feminine 
In Arabic, it is a major factor to make a distinction between masculine and feminine 
words. 
I. The Indefinite words 
-- 
-- 
Each word indicates one item only. There is no indefinite article ( ~ n & i h  
dan) . 
Example: 
a student 
(one student only/ masculine) 
a word 
& 
(one word only1 feminine) 
Rule (2) 
t SAJ^A 
Arabic has no verb to be 
Eventually, \a and & are respectively masculine and feminine (demonstrative pronoun) 
i.e. English, this 
Example: 
This is a book. 
This is a picture. 
Note: 
The STRESS is usually on the next to the last syllable of the word, unless it is attracted 
by either a long vowel or two consonants at the end. 
I 
Example: 
A long vowel 
si/kir/teer 
I 
Two consonants at the end

Q*

where suffixes started with consonant *

13 
Notice that: 
The vowel inserted is always a SJÃ‘ 
xexcept when there is only 
one consonant separating the inserted vowel from the suffix. Then 
the inserted vowel should agree with the vowel within the suffix 
itself, this is what is called vowel harmony. 
The vowel preceding the suffix of the 1" person (sing.) and 2nd 
person (masc. & fern.) and 3 person (masc.) is associated with it. 
The associated Fatha 
'x preceding the (t) marbuta (in the feminine 
noun) is deleted (as in group 3) except when the result is 3 
consonants, then the insertion of a kasra x is needed before the (t) 
marbuta. 
In feminine nouns where the insertion of vowel is needed, it is 
inserted before the production of the (t) and the vowel is always a 
Kasra x .
