Here’s a straightforward argument. . .

Here’s a straightforward argument. . .
If Melbourne’s population reaches 5 million by 2032
then this city needs a massive investment in either
public transport or roads.

Here’s a straightforward argument. . .
If Melbourne’s population reaches 5 million by 2032
then this city needs a massive investment in either
public transport or roads.
If Melbourne is serious about combating climate change,
then it does not need a massive investment in roads.

Here’s a straightforward argument. . .
If Melbourne’s population reaches 5 million by 2032
then this city needs a massive investment in either
public transport or roads.
If Melbourne is serious about combating climate change,
then it does not need a massive investment in roads.
Therefore,
If Melbourne’s population reaches 5 million by 2032
and this city is serious about climate change,
then it needs a massive investment in public transport.

Here’s a straightforward argument. . .
Prem.
If Melbourne’s population reaches 5 million by 2032
then this city needs a massive investment in either
public transport or roads.
Prem.
If Melbourne is serious about combating climate change,
then it does not need a massive investment in roads.
Therefore,
Conc.
If Melbourne’s population reaches 5 million by 2032
and this city is serious about climate change,
then it needs a massive investment in public transport.

Formalising our Argument
If Melbourne’s population reaches 5 million by 2032,
then Melbourne needs a massive investment in public transport
or Melbourne needs a massive investment in roads.
If Melbourne is serious about climate change,
then Melbourne does not need a massive investment in roads.
Therefore,
If Melbourne’s population reaches 5 million by 2032
and Melbourne is serious about climate change,
then Melbourne needs a massive investment in public transport.
p = Melbourne’s population reaches 5 million by 2032.
q = Melbourne needs a massive investment in public transport.
r = Melbourne needs a massive investment in roads.
s = Melbourne is serious about climate change.

Formalising our Argument
If p,
then Melbourne needs a massive investment in public transport
or Melbourne needs a massive investment in roads.
If Melbourne is serious about climate change,
then Melbourne does not need a massive investment in roads.
Therefore,
If p
and Melbourne is serious about climate change,
then Melbourne needs a massive investment in public transport.
p = Melbourne’s population reaches 5 million by 2032.
q = Melbourne needs a massive investment in public transport.
r = Melbourne needs a massive investment in roads.
s = Melbourne is serious about climate change.

Formalising our Argument
If p,
then q
or Melbourne needs a massive investment in roads.
If Melbourne is serious about climate change,
then Melbourne does not need a massive investment in roads.
Therefore,
If p
and Melbourne is serious about climate change,
then q.
p = Melbourne’s population reaches 5 million by 2032.
q = Melbourne needs a massive investment in public transport.
r = Melbourne needs a massive investment in roads.
s = Melbourne is serious about climate change.

Formalising our Argument
If p,
then q
or r.
If Melbourne is serious about climate change,
then Melbourne does not need a massive investment in roads.
Therefore,
If p
and Melbourne is serious about climate change,
then q.
p = Melbourne’s population reaches 5 million by 2032.
q = Melbourne needs a massive investment in public transport.
r = Melbourne needs a massive investment in roads.
s = Melbourne is serious about climate change.

Formalising our Argument
If p,
then q
or r.
If s,
then Melbourne does not need a massive investment in roads.
Therefore,
If p
and s,
then q.
p = Melbourne’s population reaches 5 million by 2032.
q = Melbourne needs a massive investment in public transport.
r = Melbourne needs a massive investment in roads.
s = Melbourne is serious about climate change.

Formalising our Argument
If p,
then q
or r.
If s,
then ∼r.
Therefore,
If p
and s,
then q.
p = Melbourne’s population reaches 5 million by 2032.
q = Melbourne needs a massive investment in public transport.
r = Melbourne needs a massive investment in roads.
s = Melbourne is serious about climate change.

The Argument Form
p ⊃(q ∨r)

The Argument Form
p ⊃(q ∨r)
s ⊃∼r

The Argument Form
p ⊃(q ∨r)
s ⊃∼r
Therefore,
(p & s) ⊃q

The Argument Form
Premise:
p ⊃(q ∨r)
Premise:
s ⊃∼r
Therefore,
Conclusion:
(p & s) ⊃q

What we’ve done
To test the validity of the argument from premises p ⊃(q ∨r) and
s ⊃∼r to conclusion (p & s) ⊃q,

To test the validity of the argument from premises p ⊃(q ∨r) and
s ⊃∼r to conclusion (p & s) ⊃q,
we have tried to make the premises true and the conclusion false,

A proof tree is a graphical and mechanical way of determining
whether an argument form is valid, or whether a formula is a
tautology.

A proof tree is a graphical and mechanical way of determining

A tree for a set of formulas closes if and only if each of its branches
contains a contradiction. Then there’s no way for these formulas
to be true together.
