COMMODORE HAVE announced a
dramatic price cut on their PC I
personal computer, from E499.99 to
I:369.99, including mono monitor,
Able software and VAT. This puts the
Commodore PC I some E30 more
attractive than Amstrad's comparable
machine, and makes it the cheapest PC
TELECOM SOFT have been busy this
month with ﬁve major game releases
for the Amiga from Rainbird and
another two from Firebird. Rainbird's
jewel i n  the crown is undoubtedly
Starglider 2, the sequel to Jez San's
blockbuster, Starglider. Your mission
(should you choose to accept it) is to
annihilate the Egron army once and for
all, and destroy the beam projector on
their home planet, Novenia. The odds
are stacked against you, you can only
enter Egron system unarmed. On top
of that, your Hallucitron projector is
on the blink and it's generating some
pretty hairy images o f  hideous
monsters and mutated creatures.
Next up, Carrier Command, a
strategic shoot 'em up on the high seas.
Take the helm of a futuristic aircraft
carrier complete with ﬁghter planes
and amphibious assault craft. Whether
you attack the enemy installations with
planes, tanks or both, you'll have to
run the gauntlet of suface to surface
and surface to air missiles, lasers and
enemy tanks and planes.
Legend o f  the Sword, a  mega
adventure game, tells of the chronicles
of Anar, a mystical sword and a shield
whose magical aura protected the
inhabitants o f  A n a r  f o r  many
centuries. But now Anar has been
plunged into a state of turmoil and
fear by an invading force of telephone
engineers - oops, mutated humanoids
under the evil wizard Suzar. Only with
the combined powers of the sword and
shield is it possible to defeat the dark
forces.
Where did Napoleon keep his
armies? Up his sleevies! This could be
your chance to ﬁnd out for yourself!
The Universal Military Simulator is an
entirely new concept in war games. Re-
enact some o f the world's greatest
CommodoreBeats
Amstrad!
'clone' on the market in this country!
The PC I uses an 8088 processor
running at 4.77MHz, and comes with
the usual 512K RAM, expandable to
640K. Ready to run business software,
MS-DOS 3,2 and a  built i n  51/4'
360K ﬂoppy complete the picture.

military conﬂicts including the battle
of Hastings, Marston Moor, Waterloo
and Gettysburg against the computer
or with a  friend. The graphics are
rumoured to be superlative in 3-D,
view from any angle, or zoom in for
a spot-check on your troops. You're
not stuck with 'real' battles, you can
create your own situations, maps and
armies, even match heros fr o m
different time zones! How would you
like to pit Monty's Desert Rats against
Alexander the Great?
Firebird's ﬁrst contribution this
month is a superfast 3-D shoot 'em
up by David Braben, co-author o f
Elite. Virus is actually a conversion of
Zarch, currently knocking 'em dead on
the Archimedes. Invading aliens are
attacking your planet, polluting the
surface with a deadly virus. Your job
is to destroy the alien craft and thus
prevent the spread of the virus, Having
seen the Archimedes version, I can't
wait to see it on the Amiga.
Also from Firebird is Whirligig, a
space battle extravaganza. Whirligig
tells the story of ships with brains, kept
gleaming and mechanically healthy by
slaves - small humanoid bio-things,
skurrying around the ships to tend to
their every need. You are determined
to steal the to be born (?) and boldly
seek o u t brave new worlds. The
whirligig is actually an interspacial
shortcut to other worlds and times, but
you'll need to blast your way through
ﬂeets of alien spacecraft, picking up
new weapons as you go
Touchline: Starglider 2, Carrier
Command, Legend of the Sword and
Universal Military Simulator, all at
1_24.95 each, from Rainbird. Virus and
Whirligig cost E19.95 each, from
Firebird

Commodore v Chelsea
THOUGH COMMODORE are to
be commended for their sponsorship
of Chelsea FC, recent events must pose
a dilemma for both company and club.
The appalling behaviour of Chelsea
supporters a t the recent playoffs
against Middlesborough n o t only
reﬂects badly on both of the football
clubs but also on the companies who
support them,
The television coverage showed the
full horror of the incident as Chelsea
supporters surged across the pitch
towards t h e  Middlesborough
supporters. Projectiles, punches and
abuse were thrown w i th  equal
abandon as police battled to control
the melee. The greater tragedy is that
this incident not only discredits
football in this country but will also
feature strongly as the European
debate on the re-entry of English clubs
into full international competition
rages on. During this debate the video
recording of the incident will no doubt
be sh o w n  a n d  reshown w i t h
Commodore's name featuring strongly
and receiving some o f the tarnish.
Subliminal though this inference may
be, i t will exist. Can Commodore
afford to be connected with a team
who is supported by a strong hooligan
element?
Chelsea and other League clubs

BETHESDA S O F T W O R K S ,
developer of Gridiorn! (an American
football simulator) i s  accusing
California based software publisher
and distributor Electronic Arts o f
forcing their game o ff the market.
Bethesda claim that Electronic Arts
offered them ﬁrm development and
distribution contracts i n  order to
promote their own American football
game, 'John Madden Football'.
Under t h e  1 9 8 7  co n tra ct,
Electronic Arts gained exclusive
marketing rights to the Amiga and
Atari ST versions o f Gridiorn! and
prohibited Bethesda from developing
it for any other computer, according
Electronic Arts in $7.3
Million Lawsuit
to documents ﬁled in the California
federal court.
As a condition of the marketing
agreement, Electronic Arts also called
for major parts o f Gridiorn! to be
incorporated i n to  a  new game
featuring former Oakland Raiders
coach and current CBS commentator.
John M a d d e n , according t o
Bethesda's suit.
In a nutshell. Bethesda Software are
accusing Electronic Arts of conning
them into designing Gridiorn, and then
using the game as a basis for their own
'John Madden Football'. Would
anyone from Electronic Arts care to

The Graphic Environment Operating
System, that was once set to be bundled
with the Commodore 64C has at last
come of age
n i ts original format GEOS
consisted o f  a  single disk that
contained the Amiga style desktop
as well as GeoWrite and GeoPaint
applications programs. However,
these were incredibly basic programs
and w e r e  l i t t l e  m o r e  t h a n
demonstrations of what could be done
with a GEOS environment.
In December 1986 Berkley
Softworks, the author o f  GEOS,
released GEOS 1_2 with updated
versions o f GeoWrite and GeoPaint
and also the Writer's Workshop
(turned GeoWrite i n t o  a  f u l l
wordprocessor), Fontpack I (20 new
fonts), GeoDEX (card index system),
Deskpack (calender, graphics grabber
and icon editor) applications which
were followed later by a full database
program, GeoFile and GeoCalc the
spreadsheet.
Armed with all these a dedicated
user could turn GEOS into a workable
system. however you were soon
confronted by its limitations.
Now, four major factors have come
together which will spread the use and
variety o f  GEOS. Firstly, Berkley
Softworks h a s  m a d e  f u r t h e r
improvements to  existing packages
and has added more to  the range
including GeoPublish, GeoSpell and
GeoProgrammer. Secondly, th i s
expanding GEOS range is now being
distributed i n  greater quantities
through a  j o i n t venture w i t h
Microprose U K  which has meant
dramatic cuts in costs. Thirdly, GEOS
is being bundled with new disk drives
such as those supplied by Evesham
Micros and ﬁnally in this article we
review the ﬁrst third party books and
software.
want it, click it" system where a click
of a mouse or joystick button can load
in ﬁles, select options or swap disks.
Each package or program that you
add to the system must be installed
or keyed into your own copy of GEOS.
This not only prevents piracy but is
the beginning o f a mass ﬁle copy
session in which you create work disks
work disks. This is all backed up by
an improved and enlarged manual.
The new GEOS system and all
subsequent application programs
including the ones mentioned below
include the 1.3 version of desktop as
standard with its faster disk access and
keyboard shortcuts. Fo r frequently
used commands such as opening or
What is GEOS?
GEOS is a C64 and now Cl28 disk
operating system that attempts to
mimic the icons, pull down menus and
workbench system pioneered o n
machines s u c h  a s  t h e  A p p l e
Macintosh, Atari ST and Amiga. It's
a "You get what you see" or "if you
containing all the programs, ﬁles and
type fonts you will need.
This is important as GEOS is a
fully integrated system in which you
could create graphics in GeoPaint or
grab them from Print Shop, Print
Master or Newsroom disks and mix
them with text in GeoWrite documents
which can then be used for a standard
letter sent out by GeoMerge to some
or all o f the names and addresses
stored i n  a  GeoFile database o r
GeoDex card ﬁle.
Upgrades
1988 sees a more streamlined GEOS
system with many of the old upgrades
now included i n  the new standard
packs. GEOS itself is now supplied on
two disks so you now have an
automatic backup copy (once it's been
installed) and a  built-in disk copy'

closing disks, pressing two keys is a
lot faster than selecting options from
pull down menus. In true GEOS style
the keyboard shortcuts aren't buried
away in a manual but are alongside
the appropriate function or command
in the pull down menu.
Desktop 1.3 also includes more
printer drivers so that more printers
and interfaces can now be used to
printout GEOS text and graphics. A
full table and guide to help you install
the right printer driver are included
in the manual.
Deskpack Plus is the updated
version of Deskpack and includes the
original combination o f  Calender,
Icon Editor, BlackJack and Graphics
Grabber but now also includes the
GeoDex and GeoMerge programs that
were sold separately as GeoDex.
Similarly, t h e  o l d  Wri te r's
Workshop has been updated to form

versions and has the additional ability
to include customised headers and
footers and three types of printout in
almost any shape or size.
Expanding the Range
Berkley Softworks has released four
new packages to extend the GEOS
range -  Ge o Publish, Ge o Spell,
Fontpack Plus and GeoProgrammer.
GeoPublish adds a full desktop
publisher to the GEOS range and can
be used to  create newsletters and
magazines.
Creating a  page o r  a  longer
magazine couldn't be easier as each
step is described in detail in the manual
and demonstrated through worked
examples.
Before the task can begin you must
design a  master page format b y
deciding the height o f the headline,
what will appear at the foot of each
page and the number and size of the
columns of text. This can range from
a single column spread across the page
or two, three or four thinner columns
for a more professional look.
Once you have created master page
formats, or selected one of the sample
formats included on the GeoPublish
disk you're ready to make up the pages.

Switching to Page Layouts mode
allows you to box off parts of the page
and assign them to  either text o r
graphics. You don't actually have to
type in the text, you simply assign a
ﬁle either created by GeoWrite o r
converted b y  th e  te xt grabber.
GeoPublish will then paint in the text
in the space you've allocated with any
remaining words carried onto the next
page.
Similarly, you can assign a space
for graphics and then ﬁll i t with
anything stored in a GEOS picture
album. These ca n  range f r o m
GeoPaint masterpieces to  clip art
"grabbed" from Newsroom, Print
Master or Print Shop.
That's only half the story as each
box can be moved to anywhere on the
screen, altered in size and shape and
ﬁlled with a picture that can be cut
or cropped to ﬁt, reduced to ﬁt or
stretched to ﬁll the allocated space.
Whenever you change a  page
layout, GeoPublish automatically
redistributes the text through the pages
leaving you to  concentrate on the
design and layout.
GeoPublish introduces a  new
command tool to the existing pull
down menus and dialogue boxes which
usually pose yes/no questions but can
be used to select brush widths and ﬁll

patterns. This is a  toolbox which
contains up to 12 icons representing
additional commands that are speciﬁc
to the screen mode you are in and are
activated by a simple click of a joystick
or mouse button. They are at ﬁrst
confusing and will have you diving for
the manual, as you create your ﬁrst
masterpiece but they soon become
second nature and you wonder how
you ever managed without them.
Now with the pages ﬁlled with all
the text running neatly around the
appropriate graphics you can add a
headline (up to 192 point 2
high) or zoom in to edit part of a page.
In edit mode you can add and
delete words and even change the font
and point size to add cross heads and
captions to your text and graphics.
You can also use a mini graphics utility
to add the ﬁnal touches such as ruled
lines, circles o r boxes that can be
drawn in a variety of thicknesses and
ﬁlled in a selection of patterns.
The ﬁnal result should be a
masterpiece, if not you can add or edit
it or start again and then print it out
on a dot matrix printer or through
LaserPublish and a laser printer which
will greatly improve its appearance.
This isn't as drastic as it sounds as the
words and pictures will still be secure
in desk ﬁles as GeoPublish only
decides the order and positions that
they are used in.
Fontpack Plus can improve the
style and variety o f  any GEOS
document as it includes 43 new fonts
and ten of the best from Eontpack I.
These new fonts include some that
consist of symbols instead o f letters
and numbers so you can easily add
scientiﬁc and electronic notations as
well as trees, musical notes and house
contents. In other words everything
including the kitchen sink!
If a total of 53 fonts isn't enough,
and i t should be for most Geowrite
documents and to  spruce up most
GeoPublish pages then you can create
your own with GeoFont which is also
included on the Eontpack Plus disk.
This works the same as any
character editor and can either be used

to alter existing fonts or to create your
own including pictures which can add
character graphics to GEOS.
GeoSpell also includes GeoFont as
well as a 28,000 word, upgradabie spell
checker which can be used to correct
even the worst spulling mistakes in any
Geo Write ﬁle including any grabbed
by the text grabber and converted to
GeoWrite format.
Twenty-eight thousand may sound
a little low for a dictionary but you
can freely a d d  words t o  user
dictionaries and swap between them
at will.
GeoSpell makes u p  f o r  th i s
apparent lack of words through ease
of use as whenever it ﬁnds a word it
doesn't know you have the choice to
accept it as it is, use the alphabet keys
to search for any word that might be
stored in any of your dictionaries or
use the FIND key to produce a scrolling
list of possible options that can then
be used to replace the word as well
as every other time that word appears.
The transition fro m the user
friendly end user application GeoSpell
to the assembly language development
package GeoProgrammer is about the
biggest jump you can make.

YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
new ground as one of the ﬁrst pieces
of third party software and brings the
ability to  create GEOS programs
complete with pull down menus, icons
and dialogue boxes in the reach of the
Basic programmer.

es
ns
•
Becker Basic consists of 273 new
commands that are used in the input
and testing systems to create a Becker
Basic program that can then be run
as a  GEOS application by double
clicking its desktop icon or run on its
own through the third part o f the
program.
Each of these commands can be
renamed so their actions can be made
clearer. For example, PRINT could
become OUTPUT or even PAPER.
This may not seem important but a
renaming session could save you a lot
of time delving in the manual for the
right command.
These c o m m a n d s  i n c l u d e
programming tools such as TRACE,
and R E N U M B E R ,  stru ctu re d
programming controls I F /  THEN'
ELSE, R EPEAT, W H I L E  a n d
LOOP, 35 commands to create and
move sprites and 18 to  create the
modulations, alter the ﬁlters, change
the waveforms and set the envelopes
to make beautiful music.
The menus and dialogue boxes that
will give your programs that GEOS
touch are built and added to your
programs through the pull-down menu
and dialogue box construction sets.
With GEOS and Becker Basic in
memory it is quite remarkable that
there is 16K remaining fo r your
program. However, i f you add pull
down menus and dialogue boxes to
your code you'll be left with about 8K
as they require a second hi-res bitmap_
Conversely, if you avoid hires graphics
altogether you would gain an extra 8K
but the result wouldn't he a GEOS
program.
Creating a pull down menu o r
dialogue box couldn't be simpler as
the construction set generates the code
you need and saves i t on disk i n
response to simple questions such as
the number of menu items or dialogue
box options and the text they should
contain.
You can even have sub menus for
your pull down menus that can run
either horizontally or vertically down
or across the screen.
Dialogue boxes can include up to
six options ranging from yes or no to
which way to go at a junction in an
adventure. A simple branch command
will then direct the program to the
right section of code.
Here at last are two different ways
to c r e a te  G E O S  p ro g ra ms,
GeoProgrammer for the assembler
and Becker Basic for the others. Both
offer ease of use and the chance to
GEOS Books
GEOS
use GEOS's menus and boxes in their
programs. These not only provide two
good ways of programming on the C64
but also opens the door for more
GEOS applications.
The Ofﬁcial GEOS Programmers
Reference Guide, published b y
Bantam Computer Books, is the
ofﬁcial tome of facts and addresses for
programmers who wish to delve into
GEOS w i t h o u t  t h e  a i d  o f
GeoProgrammer.
Armed w i th  this manual the
assembler programmer can unlock the
GEOS macro routines to create icons,
menus, dialogue boxes, fonts as well
as new printer interfaces, graphics
libraries a n d  m u l t i  t a s k i n g
applications.
Four hundred and ﬁfty pages that
can provide the GEOS equivalent to
the C64 Programmers reference guide.
Having said that, it shouldn't scare off
ﬁrst time assembler programmers as
the book describes these routines
through labels that are indexed at the
end of the book, and therefore can be
substituted fo r the hex equivalent
when you start coding.

Abacus the company behind Becker
Basic, covers the whole spectrum of
GEOS fro m  hints and ti p s fo r
GeoWrite and GeoPaint users, a guide
for programmers and listings for three
GEOS programs.
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988

The hints and tips cover common
sense and shortcuts which make using
GEOS programs a lot easier, such as
writing your own error messages and
creating Geo Write form letters.
If you tire of the 50 hints and tips
crammed into the book you could type
in either a converter or font editor
which do the same job as GeoFont and
the Deskpack's text grabber or tackle
Edmon, a machine code monitor to
delve i n t o  programming a n d
converting GEOS.
This new burst of GEOS activity
which has included the development
of a GEOS desktop publisher and
spellchecker, t h e  re l e a se  o f
programming tools backed up with
information aimed at every level o f
user will attract more and more
interest in this valuable but underrated
operating system.
GEOS has now evolved from a
gimmick to mimic 16 bit machines to
a system with its own wordprocessor
complete w i t h  spelichecker,
spreadsheet, graphics package,
database and DTP package and also
has the ability to incorporate others
programs, ﬁles and pictures into the
system.
To paraphrase someone who was
actually describing the Amiga (but its
equally appropriate here), GEOS was
ﬁrst a child full of promise but couldn't
stand on its own, then it was a teenager
as it become more organised and useful
but still capable o f  throwing the
occasional tantrum; now it has come
of age.

program is called SIMPLE, an
acronym fo r Simple, Icons,
Menus, Pointers, Language and
Extension. This is an extension to the
normal BASIC language allowing you
to write programs operating i n  a
similar way to the WIMP and GEM
• systems but using the keyboard or a
joystick in place of a mouse. It consists
of a library of thirteen machine code
routines called b y the usual SYS
command which enable yo u  t o
perform such functions as handling a
pointer, drawing windows, a n d
generating pull down menus.
The pointer is a sprite - usually arrow-
shaped which forms the heart of the
system. It is moved around the screen
(known as the Desktop) and used to
select functions of the software simply
by pointing at words or pictures.
Icons are the pictures mentioned
before, representing actions within a
program. These actions are performed
by moving the pointer onto the picture
and pressing the select button.
Windows are areas o f  the screen
separated from the rest o f it by a
border. All work goes on within them
and they may be closed to leave the
screen below intact.

Pull-Down Menus are lists of options
which are pulled-down from a menu
bar at the head of the screen. A reverse
video bar is then moved up and down
the menu, and the select key pressed
to select an option. Then, the menu
may be removed from the screen.
Now that we all know what we're
talking about, I  will describe the
different commands o f SIMPLE in
detail. Also included is a reference
table (Figure I )  o f start addresses,
syntax, a n d  o t h e r  r e l e v a n t
information.
Commands
Desk does n o t need a n y extra
parameters and clears the screen to the
grey "Checkerboard" p a tte r n
commonly used i n  mouse-driven
software. The desk-pattern is stored in
the Character Code 64 and this may
be redeﬁned to create different desk
patterns. For example:
10 desk=5204
20 sys desk
MENU "Menu Header" prints the
heading for the pull-down menus at
the top of the screen. The heading may

be u p  to  38 characters long, fo r
example:
10 menu=5234:scnclr
20 sys menu "Menu() Menu' Menu2
Menu3"
Store & Fetch respectively store the
current screen in RAM, and bring it
back again. They do not require any
parameters and you can only have one
screen stored at a time. For example:
10 sre=528 I: fetch=5316: desk.5204
20 key:sys sre
30 sys desk:char1,I,I, "Press any key
to see keys."
40 getkey Msys fetch
ICON,x,y,i will print an icon on the
screen at any text position. •x' is the
x-coordinate, 'y' is the y-coordinate,
and 1' is the icon number. The ranges
for these parameters are as follows:
-I < x < 39 Range of X-Coordinate.
-1 < y < 24 - Range of Y-Coordinate.
-1 < i  <  15 - Range of icon number.
For example:
10 icn=5334:desk=5204
20 sys desk
30 x=int(rnd(I)*39) :y=int(rnd(1)*24)
:i=int(rnd(1)*15)

40 sys icn,x,y,i
50 goto 30
WIND° FV,x,y,w,h requires four
parameters and will set up a window
on the screen, draw a border, and clear
the window. 'x' and 'y' are the co-
ordinates of the top-left corner of the
window, 'w' is the width of the window,
and 'h' is the height of the window.
The ranges for these are as follows:
-1 < x < 38- Range of X-Coordinate.
-1 < y < 23- Range of Y-Coordinate.
0 < w < 39-x - Range of Width.
0 < h <  24-y - Range of Height.
For example:
10 window=5416:desk=5204
20 sys desk
30 sys window,5,5,10,10: p r i n t
"Window #  1"
40 sys window,10,1 0,10,10: print
"Window # 2 "
POSITION,x,y simply sets the co-
ordinates of the pointer to the inserted
values. It is used in conjunction with
the LOOP command to set the start
position of the movement. 'x' and 'y'
are the coordinates of the pointer and
are in the range below:
-I < x < 40 - Range of X-Coordinate.
-1 < y < 24 Range of Y-Coordinate.
For example:
10 pstn=5591
20 input"Pointer Coordinates"; x,y
30 sys pstn,x,y
40 ?"The Pointer is at"x;y
SHO !V& HIDE respectively print and
erase the pointer. When SHOW is
executed, the two characters under the
pointer are saved before it is printed.
HIDE then retrieves the characters
and puts them back on the screen.
For example:

SPEED,s -  as all the routines are
written in machine code, if there were
not a delay loop in the routines to
move the pointer etc... i t would zip
around the screen and be totally
uncontrollable. Also, people have
different reaction times, and may
prefer to have the pointer moving at
a slower speed than others. This
command will determine how slow or
fast the the pointer moves. 's' which
is the speed, must be in the range
below:
-1 <  s < 256 - Higher the value, lower
the speed.

MOVE i s  th e  mo st important
command in SIMPLE's vocabulary. It
draws the pointer, and allows it to be
moved around the screen until the
select button is pressed without erasing
everything i t moves over. Fo r an
example of it in use, see SPEED.
MAKE "Option]/  Option2/ Option-

Pull-down menus have a ﬁxed size of
8 by 9 characters with up to eight
options, and the last option is always
'Exit'. Each line of option text must

pointing to the SIMPLE font. This is
so that when you make a mistake in
a program, the screen doesn't clear to
a interference-type mess!
For example:
10 sys 6485:end
20 sys 6498:end
Type RUN 10 then type some rubbish.
The screen will blink, and your error
will be displayed.
Type RUN 20 then type some rubbish.
The screen will go crazy! Type RUN
10 to re-enable the interrupt.
Co-ordinate Sensing - after a MOVE
or POSITION command, locations
$D8 and $D9 hold th e  current
coordinates of the pointer. Thus, they
can also be changed by POKEing
directly.
Option Sensing -  after a  PU LL
command, th e  Option th a t was
selected is stored in $D9 -  the Y-
Coordinate of the pointer. This is so
that the pointer remains in a logical
place after pulling a  menu down.
Before moving the pointer again, you
must either assign the option number
to a variable or store it elsewhere in
RAM.
The SIMPLE Font - to improve the
Reverse Video, and create a space for
icons, a  new font i s deﬁned b y
SIMPLE starting at the address $2000.
This font can be redeﬁned in the usual
way by using a Character Designer.
The icons - to squeeze all ﬁfteen icons
into a character set, the characters
which make up the icons are not stored
in a strict sequential order - they skip
around alphabets etc... For a list of
screen codes which make up each icon,
see the reference table (Figure 1).
Again, these can be redeﬁned using a
Character Designer.
Special Characters -  there are some
character codes which are neither icons
or normal alphanumeric characters.
These are shown below:

Redeﬁning the Keys -  the listing
presented here is conﬁgured fo r a
joystick in port 1, using the ﬁre-button
as a select button. If you do not have
a joystick, or would prefer to use the
keyboard, you can change the keys
quite easily. The third section of the
reference table shows the addresses
you need to change the values in, and
the relevant values for a joystick in
port I ,  a n d  th e  cursor keys +
RETURN. However, you can use any
keys by poking their ASCII codes into
the locations shown.
Starting the System -  to take up as
little memory as possible, SIMPLE is
installed at the bottom of memory. It
operates only in text mode, and you
must not attempt to enter a Hires mode
as this will corrupt the program. As
it is at the bottom of RAM, the start
of program pointers must be set before
entering t h e  S I M P L E  L o a d e r
program, or before writing your own
SIMPLE programs. This is done as
follows and is very important:
POKE 10240,0:POKE 44,40:NEW
This sets the pointers. Now, you can
begin to type in the loader or begin
to write your own programs.
When you have typed in and debugged
the loader, RUN the program and
follow the instructions to  save the
code.
MONITOR
S "simple",8,1000,2801 -  Save To
Disk.
S "simple",1,1000,2801 - Save to Tape.
Then to reload the code, enter the
above pokes and type the following:
LOAD "simple",8,1 - Load from Disk.
LOAD "simple",1,1 -  Load from
Tape.
Type SYS 6485 (ENABLE) to set up
the interrupt and now program to your
heart's content. It's SIMPLE when
you know how!
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988

Using the Demonstration
Program
Before typing the demonstration
program in, you must set the bottom
of memory pointers as explained
previously. The program starts b y
loading the code ﬁle "simple" which
should already have been saved as
explained before. Tape users must
change line 10 to:
10 I F  C
"SIMPLE", I,!
Once the program has been run, you
can move the pointer anywhere on the
screen. Experiment with pressing the
select button. You will ﬁnd that
everything o n  screen will give a
reaction of some kind!
Clicking on one of the icons at the
base of the screen will result in a small
window to indicate what each icon
represents. Clicking on the desk-top,
title-window, o r  menu-header will
have the same result.
The four pull-down menus are
Screen, Pointer, Data, and Goodies.
The ﬁrst three consist of lists of the
SIMPLE routines. Selecting any o f
these will show a large window telling
you the syntax, etc o f the routine.
These windows are closed by clicking
on the reverse-video button saying
"OK".
The fourth pull-down menu has
four options: Input, Speed, Info, and
Quit. B y  selecting Input, you can
choose whether to  use Joystick o r
Keyboard. This is done by clicking on
the relevant icon.
When you select Speed, a window
will appear in the centre of the screen
with a bar showing the present speed.
You can change this setting b y
pointing at the position on the line
corresponding to the required speed.
Selecting Info just shows a window
of general information about the
program, which is removed by clicking
on OK in the usual way.
Finally, selecting Quit will exit the
program and reset the computer, but
be warned the reset performed is a cold
one, and the program cannot be
recovered.
Please note that I  would b e
interested to see any programs you
write using SIMPLE. You can send
these to me at the address below, on
tape or disk, enclosing an SAE. Send
to: Mark Everingham, 17 Collingwood

This will trick the computer into
believing that the basic now starts at
$4000 instead of $0801. Load in the
basic loader and run it; if error free,
the program will automatically save
itself as a block of data. If you reload
that data in the future remember to
add a I after the device number. The
data is saved in the following location
$2800437FF.
The sprites run from 160 to 223
in a compromise to avoid the area
$2000 traditionally set aside for re-
deﬁned character graphics and to
avoid the need of typing in line after
Line of data.
If only one o r  two sprites are
required then use the following
formula: (Sprite block No.-I60) *40 +
190 = the date line number at which
that sprite blocks d a ta  starts.
Remember to type in the following
three lines of data and alter the variable
BL to the number of data lines you
have in your ﬁnished program, less 1.
The small basic program AIR -

To hold a sprite enter the same number
for Start and End.
Any Sprite Editor program will

into the front and side of the hull and
turret and top. Every conceivable
ground weapon has been included in
this simulation from artillery to trucks,
mortars to tanks. Not surprisingly, this
game is recommended for advanced
players only!

Set in the War of Independance or,
as the Yanks like to  call i t, the
Revolutionary War, you get the
chance to re-enact the three major
battles -  Bunker Hill, Saratoga and
Monmouth.
Bunker Hill was a relatively small
conﬂict. Only a few thousand men
ﬁghting over a small area. Not only
did the Brits come second at Saratoga,
but the major defeat caused the French
(boo, hiss) to decide that this might
be the perfect opportunity for them
to also declare war upon us so that
we now had to ﬁght on two fronts.
The battle o f Monmouth was the
largest of the three battles and the time
when George Washington really came
into his own as a leader of men. So
here is your opportunity to rewrite the
history books and ensure that the good
old US of A really should be coloured
red on all the maps!
From Leisure Genius comes that
old favourite, Monopoly. This game
has probably caused more inter-family
rows than any other i n  history.
Monopoly players seem to come in two
forms. Those that play to win at any
cost and those who don't. The two
factions are totally incompatible with
neither side being able to see the point
of view of the other.
The computer version allows you
to play against either human o r
computer opponents or any mix of the
two. You can opt for a long or short
game and games can be saved midway
through. Control has been made as

excellent graphics for the monsters.
You need to ﬁnd and collect jewels
and ﬁreballs before being allowed past
the dragon and onto the next level.
On the Americana label comes
Bruce Lee a  platform game with
martial art elements. Bruce has to
collect all the lanterns in an area before
a door opens allowing access to the
next level. At the same time, he must
avoid the ministrations of ninjas and
the Green Yam°. The game looks very
dated but is still good fun to play.
Four games for under a pound each
is the boast o f  Microvalue's third
compilation. The games are Equinox,
an arcade adventure, Darksyde, a
shoot 'em-up, the Big KO, a boxing
simulation and a  platform game,
Mouse Trap.
Finally, with timing that is about
as good as one of \tinny Jones' tackles
comes FA Cup Football also on the
Ricochet label which arrived in the
ofﬁce two days after Wimbledon had
ﬂuked their win over Liverpool. As a
game, it is about as interesting as Don
Howe's tactics which, for those of you
who care little for football is not very
much.

leave objects lying around to help him

SPIRIT internal expansion memory boards in FAST MEMORY
with battery back-up/clock. Selectable autoconﬁgure or non-
autoconﬁgure. No soldering and includes full instructions,
diagrams and pictures on disc! Prices start as low as E225 but
due to the volotile price of DRAM chips at present, contact us
for a ﬁrm price. Send for demo disk and technical spec.
Programs requiring lmeg memory are out now and it won't be
long before 1.5 or 2 meg will be the normal. This board allows
you to populate it in 512K increments, and you can still expand
to a whoppong 10 megs!
HARD DRIVES
Where can you get a 2 meg hard drive for E499.95? or 40megs
for E750? Better still, a 65meg hard drive for only E895? From
us of course. These are true SCSI drives with the interface
allowing up to 7 devices on it, with a full year's warranty. These
are very affordable drives and due to the AMIGA being a
memory hungry beast we r e

background m u s i c  u s i n g
interrupts, and in the next few
pages we'll he looking at just two of
them. Both use the same kind o f
technique, so we'll see how that works
before getting down to  the serious
business.
When playing a tune in Basic, the
information is read as a series of data
statements and POKEd i n to  the
appropriate registers. In machine code
we will have to have the music stored
as a collection of numbers in memory,
and use strange incantations and terms
like 'load the accumulator' and 'store
the accumulator' in order to make the
appropriate noises. To those of you
who are frightened by machine code
programs, 'load the accumulator' and
'store the accumulator' can be thought
of, at least as far as this program is
concerned, as being analagous to
something like A=PEEK(register) and
POKE(register), A  respectively. I n
other words we're going to be looking
at a collection of memory locations,
getting information from them, and
then storing that information in the
correct registers to make a sound.
As in the Basic example we will
need a dummy set of data, or dummy
information in memory, to  tell the
program that it has reached the end
of the current data for the particular
tune that we've set it playing, and since
storing a -1 in a memory location is
rather difﬁcult (you try POKE 832,-
1 and see what happens!) we'll be using
the value 255, since a high frequency
value of 255 makes little sense to the
SID chip and simply produces an
extremely high pitched whine. If you
really want to make a high pitched
whine, then use value 254 instead and
leave the program to ﬁnish of its own
accord.
C64 PROGRAMMING
Making
Music
Continuing our music series, this month we look at the
use of interrupts when playing background music
By Peter Gerrard
Using Voices
In the program that follows we will
be using voices two and three to play
the background, interrupt driven
music, Voice one will be left free for
other devices and, as you might readily
appreciate, voices two and three can
also be used for miscellaneous noises
and sound effects, since an interrupt
driven tune, once started, cannot be
diverted unless we tell it to be diverted.
That is, voice three (in our example
anyway) is being used to  play a
sequence of notes, and it will play those
notes over and over again regardless
of anything else we might tell it to do.
The waveform is stored in memory
by the interrupt routine, the values for
the high and low value frequencies are
read in by the interrupt routine, and
so anything else that we might do
outside t h e  routine i s  sw i ftl y
overridden by the routine itself. We
might decide to make a noise using
voice three set to  the white noise
waveform, but our machine code
program soon recovers from this and
carries on without skipping a note. So,
we can play our two voice tune, have
one voice left over to do whatever we
want, and still have voices two and
three to use if we really want to.
A second important fa c t t o
remember about the interrupt routine
is that it can be played at a varying
rate. I once heard someone else's music
program, and was quite impressed by
the way in which one could speed up,
or slow down, the rate at which a
background tune was being played. It
was only in devising this programthat
I realised how trivial an exercise that
was!
Consider the following — the
interrupts on the Commodore 64 are
serviced every ﬁftieth of a second or
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
9
so, and i f we're playing an interrupt
driven tune, this means that ﬁfty times
a second the routine is going to be
activated and a note (or two, since
we're using two voices) will be played.
This is obviously much too fast, since
few of us are capable of registering that
many notes per second. We're not all
fans of The Ramones you know!
So, we insert a delay loop so that
a note is played only every (say) tenth
interrupt. This not only slows the rate
of note playing down to an acceptable
level, but it also allows other things
to be serviced by interrupts as well.
For example if we wanted to we could
have another interrupt routine i n
memory that was moving sprites
around, o r  rotating user-deﬁned
graphics a la Tony Crowther!
Such a routine might look like this:
C000 LDX $CFFF
C003 INX
C004 STX WEFT
C007 CPX # SOA
C009 BNE SC012
COOA LDX SOO
COOC STX SC FEE'
COOF JMP $(routine)
C012 .IMP SEA3l
Assume that we have diverted the
Hardware Interrupt Vector so that it
leaps off to $C000 instead of SEA3I
as usual. Then, everytime it gets there
we load the X register with the content
of m e m o r y  l o c a ti o n  S C R E E
(X-7PEEK(53247) if you like). Then we
increment the X register ( X
store the new value at WEFT' again
(POKE 53247,X). We then compare
this new value with SOA (Does X equal
10?), and if it is not equal then we jump
to location $C012 (if X< > 10 then go

to location $C012). If this is the case
then program execution simply jumps
off to the normal interrupt routine at
SEA31.
However, on the tenth time we get
here X will have been increased so that
it does equal 10, and so instead o f
jumping to SEA31 straightaway we
must ﬁrst of all reset our counter by
loading the X register with zero and
storing i t  a t  location S C FFF
(X=0:POKE 53247,0) before jumping
off to our own routine, wherever that
might be stored in memory.
Thus we can increase or decrease
the speed at which an interrupt driven
routine is serviced by just altering the
value that we're comparing the X
register to. At the moment it's set to
ten, so if we lower that to ﬁve then
the tune will be played twice as fast,
, Increase it to 20, and everything goes
at half rate. Quite easy, really.
Before presenting the routine itself,
we just need to explain now how it
works. Not by going through it line
by line, as in the example above. I f
you can fo l l o w  machine code
programs then you'll be able to do it
for yourself, but if you can't then this
is neither the time nor the place!
C64 PROGRAMMING
How It Works
Voice three is used to repeat a tune
over and over again. The information
for this tune, in low value/ high value
order, is stored in memory from $9E00
to S9EFF, and so we can have
something like 128 notes i n  this
particular little riff.
Voice two is used for the much
longer tune, and can indeed be said
to represent our musical soundtrack.
This one is stored in memory from
$9000 to $9DFF, in low value/high
value order again, thus giving us the
space to store some 1920 notes. Quite
a lot, and the top o f end o f Basic
memory is always a fairly safe place
to save information. Later on we'll see
how we can do away with even this,
and still have space fo r  a  long
soundtrack.
There are limitations however with
the space for all these notes. Voice
three is continually playing a  riff;
ideally one that is linked in to voice
two somehow, and i f we have (say)
96 notes in the riff then it makes sense
for voice two to be playing a tune that
has a  multiple o f  96 notes i n  i t,
otherwise things soon begin to sound
horribly discordant.

How do the notes get there in the
ﬁrst place? It is an easy task to modify
the synthesiser program so that, as well
as playing the notes, the low value and
high value frequencies are stored in
memory, fr o m  $9000 o r  S9FFF
depending on which voice you want
to have saved, Include the option to
delay a note or introduce a pause (the
space bar, for example, could be used
to put the values of 00,00 in for low
value/high value, which is as effective
a way of introducing a one note pause
as any), and there you have it. Regard
it as an exercise in programming the
SID chip and getting the brain cells
working, and if enough people write
in and complain perhaps the editor will
give me space to expand on the topic!
Having got the tunes in memory,
we must then load and ru n  the
program called Interrupt, and music
will be the result. For those of you
not of a musical turn of phrase (like
me) then the ﬁnal program in this
section will put a simple boogie riff
into memory for you and allow you
to listen to  i t. N o t very musical,
perhaps, but everyone has to  start
somewhere!

A
Short Interlude
T
Commodore 64, like other
processors is able to  handle
interrupts. The Commodore 64 makes
the use of interrupts particularly easy
by placing th e  R O M  interrupt
handling routine vector in RAM. This
is located a t $0314 /S0315 (l o t hi
format).
The interrupts take place 60 times
per second and are a  powerful
programming tool. There are many
short programs which use interrupts,
available in printed form, from books
and magazines.
Using Several Interrupts
The aim of this short machine code
program is to make the use of several
interrupt routines a  lot easier. ( I
developed the program initially for a
game I  was writing which required
several interrupt routines to operate
at once.) The routine is however very
useful for utility routines. First let us
examine what the problems are in
using more than one interrupt routine.
Each program is usually published
as an individual, stand alone program
which will usually have the following
format:
LDA # SOO
STA $0314
LDA #  $CO
STA S0315
CLI
RTS
*
!set interrupt disable
!place address of new
!routine into interrupt
!vect or
!clear interrupt disable
!start of routine
!main interrupt routine

Overcome the problems of using more than one
interrupt routine with this handy utility
By Michael Tinker
•N
This format means th a t tw o
interrupt routines cannot be used
together unless they are modiﬁed by
changing the JMP SEA31 at the end
of the ﬁrst routine to point to the
second. The start routine to change the
interrupt vector at the beginning of the
second ro u ti n e  t h e n  becomes
superﬂuous,
The short length of most interrupt
routines will allow more than one to
be in operation without any noticable
reduction in the computers speed, and
before clashing with the next interrupt.
Sixty interrupts per second, assuming
an average of three clock cycles per
instruction, allows about 5,000
instruction to be carried out before the
non-interrupt program grinds to  a
halt.
The solution I have come up with
is to keep a  table o f the interrupt
routine start address in the form of
a small array similar to the BASIC
DIM A(5). The control program is
called on each interrupt, and in turn
will call each o f the routines which
have their address in the table.
To use this method, only small
adjustments to the interrupt routines
are required. First of all remove the
usual start routine which usually
changes the interrupt vector, as this
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
24
CUD
task is carried out b y the control
program. Secondly, change the JMP
SFA31 at the end o f the routine to
RTS. This is because the routine is
called by the controller with a JSR
instruction.
• The routines can be added into the
table in any order; they are each called
in turn starting with routine 0 at the
start of the table.
(N.B. ensure that the interrupt vector
is not pointing to the controller when
you change the table, as it will attempt
to call a routine which is not present,
if the address is only partly changed
when there is an interrupt.)
The controller is particularly easy
to use because there is no need to
predeﬁne how many routines you wish
to use, entries in the table o f $0000
will not be called, therefore if you wish
you can even stop all the routine calls.
This i s particularly useful when
starting to use the computer when you
may not know how many routines will
be used.
Getting it all in
If you enter the Mikro Assembler
listing ﬁrst save a copy incase there
has been a catastrophic error and then
assemble; a SYS call to 49152 will start
the program, The basic listing is easier
to use as there is a checksum error
check as part of the listing. Also when
the program is run, the cursor will
reappear over the command SYS49I52
after a  short delay, so all that is
required is a further press of the return
key and it is away!
Next month we will look at a
program of more general use which
will have commands to  add and
remove routines from the table and
also list the contents, showing the
addresses which are being called. Until
then, happy interludes!

ostrich? It's pretty safe to bet the answer will he
no! In  fact there's only a minimal risk o f this
oecuring to the likes of you and me at the time of writing.
Karnov however, an Russian ex-circus strongman, appears
to have an afﬁnity for this and other bizzare disasters,
guaranteed to occur as frequently as wet afternoons in
August! The game tends to remind me of wet afternoons
too, nine levels of the most pathetic graphics you can imagine
'. more later!

GAME REVIEW
way past marauding creatures of every description, and a
few that even defy description, collecting useful objects along
the way. At the end of each level, you'll need to load the
next part from tape -  an annoying little distraction. The
jist of the plot is as follows: the Russian village of Creamina
(Karnov's retirement home) has a secret -  it's the hiding
place for one of the world's most awesome treasures (no,
not Paul Daniel's wage packet), stolen by Ryu, an evil
wizard, who left behind a few monsters to punish the
villagers for hiding the treasure in the ﬁrst place! Karnov
naturally decides he's the man fo r the job (obviously
after the insurance reward), and sets off to ﬁnd the pieces
of the map that will lead him to Ryu, the treasure and
the game's end.
Now to the graphics. The background features are solid
hut colourful while the moving objects (actually hardware
sprites) are well detailed. Where the whole thing falls to
pieces is the animation. All the sprites are animated using
just two positions, giving them a very jerky disposition,
but worst of all is the big blank space behind them! OK,
if this was a Plus/ 4 or Spectrum game, this is to be expected,
but there's no excuse for scrappy graphics on the C64!
As for the sound, equally pathetic - not even worthy
of a VIC 20! Assorted clicks and squeaks with a brief snatch
of monophonic Bach each time you die. Having said all
that, I did ﬁnd the game challenging and mildly addictive,
although not addictive enough to persuade me to buy
it!

COMMUNICATIONS
s the way forward
We look at the history of computer communications,
where it came from, where it is now, and where it is
going
By Mary Branscombe
T
sending data down a telephone
line has a history going back 160
years, and some of the common jargon
terms that have evolved alongside the
more traditional computer buzz words
can he traced right back to the days
of the Telegraphic transmission
systems in the Victorian era!
The earliest form of telegraphy -
being the ﬁrst form of totally electrical
and "wireless" communications
systems, and probably the earliest
form of electrical message sending, was
the remote actuation of electric relays
to punch holes in a piece of paper.
The letters o f  the alphabet were
deﬁned by a stream of these dots each
representing a 0 or a 1 and were thus
deﬁned between a mark and a space
signal.
This goes back as far as 1840, and
the ﬁrst reliable machines to do this
were traditionally kept for military
purposes. although the government
found that the new devices were very
useful fo r transmitting information
from one part o f  the country to
another.
The mark and space have been
replaced by holes punched into larger
paper tape, larger holes for mark, and
smaller ones for space - this code is
called Baudot, and is in common use
today in some of the more backward
corners o f  this planet. After this
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
27
development, l o n g e r  d i sta n ce
communications was made possible by
synchronising t h e  sending a n d
receiving stations by beginning each
letter with a start bit and concluding
it with a stop bit, so over the years
the standard was to send seven bits
of data; the start bit, the stop bit, the
code for the letter and, of course the
mark.
When after 100 years o r  so -
technology w a s  i n c r e a s i n g
dramatically -  there was a need to
access c o m p u t e r s  r e m o t e l y .
Telegraphy was the obvious way o f
doing this as the technology could
easily be interfaced with the new
computer systems and the information
was readily translatable. But back in
the 1950s computers were not the
machine we know today, processing
was never expected to come up with
instant results; jobs were assembled in
batches (hence th e  te rm batch
processing), fed into the computer by
paper tape and then run. Instant
collection and processing of data was
then considered quite amazing!
So the ﬁrst major application
which computer communications had
was to ensure that computers were fed
with up to date data, the paper tape
was then quite a fast way of inputting
large amounts of data and indeed this
saved a lot of time with computer entry
staff, who were employed exclusively

to enter data as quickly and as
accurately as possible.
Barbaric wasn't it?
Typical communications speeds were
at 50 or 75 bits per second and this
is N O T  t h e  b a u d  r a te  o f  a
communications system. Baud rate
and bits per second are more or less
identical a t lower communications
speeds, but at higher rates bits are
transmitted i n  different ways other
than changing the state of a signal from
high to low (and vice versa), additional
information is transmitted by detecting
the phase state o f a signal, so 1200
bits per second full duplex is actually
achieved by a 600 baud signal using
four phase angles (two for each end
of the communications stream).
In days gone by there were no
friendly on-line systems, n o  real
remote access, terminals were still yet
to have screens (let alone faster storage
devices) and there were literally
thousands of protocols, variants and
alternative communications systems
cropping up all over the shop.
The Telephone Network
By this time, all sorts of changes were
taking place. T h e  Te l e x  a n d
Telegraphy network, originally set up
to handle data, were taken over by
voice grade circuits (the earliest was
Bell's telephone design from 1876).
And likewise, communications
systems were being adapted to make
the most of the telephone system by
using audio tones to represent the state
of high and low in a pair of twisted
wires. Initially this was merely one
directional transmission and receiving
(half duplex as the terminology had
it), but by cleverly using two different
signals, full duplex (o r two way)
communication was possible.
Improved digitising and sampling
systems after the war (primarily)
developed for the encryption systems
set up for England and America to
communicate via the war) led to faster
baud rates -  although 50/75 bits/ s
were possible. The next step was to
move to 110bits/s, this soon moved
up to 300 bits/ s and only recently has
the limit been reached for accurate
data transmission along a voice grade
telephone line - 2400 bits/s.
Over the years little has actually
happened to  the way the data is
transmitted along a line; the start and
stop bits of the haudot code have been
C O MMU N IC ATIO N S
retained, but instead of a simple 5 bit
signal used to transmit the letters of
the alphabet, a new system has been
employed whereby a 7 bit extended
code can be used to transmit the letters
of the alphabet. This in fact was as
a direct need to transmit data other
than letters 1 2 8  more in fact.
To reduce the number of errors in
transmission due t o  line noises
(remember we are still talking about
voice grade telephone lines and think
how noisy they can be!), a further bit
was added to the stream of data - the
parity bit, which adds up all of the
bits in the main characters and then,
depending on whether the result is odd
or even, generate a 0 or a 1.
This system gave birth to  the
world's most adhered to standard -
ASCII, the common name for the
alphabet naturally IBM came along
with their own variant, but as the PCs
use ASC II instead o f  their own
EBCIDIC s y s t e m  ( u s e d  o n
mainframes). I  think you will agree
that IBM are licking their wounds and
trying to keep quiet about this one!
Higher Speeds
The fastest speed possible on an
ordinary voice grade telephone line is
usually regarded as 1200 bits/ s.
Beyond this, noise on the line, due to
"noisy" exchanges and poor cabling
has made anything faster very difﬁcult.
2400 b i ts / s i s  becoming mo re
common, and indeed the standard
transmission speed o f  TELETEX
services, the high speed version o f
telex.
Services
Communications these days is easy for
the microcomputer user -  most
computers have a  common facility
built into the hardware, be it by using
the standard RS232 interfaces, or by
some s u c h  s i m i l a r  s e r i a l
communications.
Software too abounds for many
computers. This is a far cry from the
ﬁrst d a y s  o f  c o m p u t e r
communications, when the required
"software" for communicating with
another computer involved making
direct links to a processor's data bus,
and then fooling the computer into
thinking it was reading from a very
fast keyboard!
These d a ys communications
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
28
packages are very sophisticated and
can handle many different baud rates.
They can operate in either full or half
duplex modes; they can effectively
emulate many different types o f
terminal, from DEC's VT52 and
VT100 and the Hazeltine to the more
modern graphics terminals a n d
professional workstations that support
graphics.
Software is fast becoming more
sophisticated than the modems that
are used to  communicate with the
telephone line, and the faster they are,
the more sophisticated the software
needs to be. For example, the new
generation of 2400 bitsfs modems can
now support special hardware
encryption devices that ensure your
data is unreadable as it goes down the
line. The only way you are to retrieve
this data is to use a similar modem
with the same decryption device at the
other end.
Communicating with a micro has
become more popular than with, say,
a data terminal. The reason is that a
computer can be programmed i n
software which would cost many
hundreds o f  pounds to  achieve i n
hardware! Many of the initial sales of
Amstrad PCs was not to the business
sector, but to those requiring cheap
and reliable terminals a  VT100
terminal can cost anything up to S1000
- but with a piece of £25 software
running on a £400 machine, you have
a terminal and a computer with on-
line storage, plenty of buffer memory
with all the extras attached.
Communications has really come
home for the micro.
Bulletin Boards
For the micro user, a  service has
sprung up since the mid-1970's called
the Bulletin Board is the ideal place
equivalent of the bulletin boards you
may have at work or in a social club.
Hackers are remarkably solitary
creatures, only mixing with their own
type -where possible, and to this end,
the bulletin board is the ideal place
to exchange ideas and programming
hints and tips, so it is small wonder
why these services haven't taken off
and spread all over the world.
On a Bulletin Board, you are likely
to ﬁnd a great many messages -have
a browse through a few and then you
will see that a great many of them are
requesting specialised information
about th e  inner workings o f  a
computer of a compiler. Occasionally

you w i l l  ﬁnd a  message saying
something to the effect that they will
be starting a  BBS (Bulletin Board
Service) of their own, so why not ring
them up on their number with their
modem set to such and such and have
a chat!
I am an owner of a small number
of well used computers - all of which
are hooked up to modems at some time
or another. I ring up BBS's daily, and
this is why I run up 150 telephone
bills a quarter! But the returns are
much more valuable than .E150. I have
downloaded priceless public domain
software instructions on how to build
my own Winchester drive fo r my
computer using surplus stocks (that
one saved m e  &MOO a n d  th e
interchange of information is friendly,
informed, intelligent and varied.
Every now and then we receive calls
from "hackers" asking fo r a  few
numbers to try out, and I often oblige
with a few o f the best known free
services. These people often log on for
a few minutes -  have a look round
and then disappear forever th i s isn't
hacking - and I  would contest that
breaking into government computer
establishments is hacking -  that is
sheer vandalism (sorry, b u t m y
favourite BBS system was brought to
its knees by a bunch of nerds). Real
hacking is carrying on the information
transfer and cameraderie among a
close knit group o f computer buffs.
You don't have to be clever, but if you
know something and y o u  have
something to  say o r  offer, then
welcome to the club!
It is true that BBSs have special
user groups, or access to certain parts
of the BBSs hard disk that are
unobtainable to the usual people, and
entry to these is honorary and entirely
at the discretion o f the Sysop (the
manager of the BBS). I am a member
of one arid I  wear i t like a medal
because it shows to each and every
other member of the SUG (Special
User Group) th a t w e  a l l  have
something special to offer each other,
be it technical help, knowledge of a
language, access to certain information
regarding the BBS software (a great
deal o f  which i s maintained b y
ourselves and friends) o r  simply
because you can offer some very useful
information a b o u t  i m p r o v i n g
services.
In short, accessing a BBS is like
entering a  group o f  friends that
communicate all over the world -  in
much the same way that a pen pal does
with paper, pen and ink!
C O MMU N IC A TIO N S
Professional Services
For the businessman there are a great
many services on offer. Financial data
services are available, but they have
to compete with the excellent services
offered b y Prestel and CEEFAX
although specialist services offer less
general information. Scientiﬁc
databases offering access to ﬁles and
programs all around the world are
hooked up (in the U K at least) by
JANET -  th e  Jo i n t Academic
NETwork, and access to  American
computer systems at Berkley, MIT and
others are possible by linking up
JANET th ro u g h  P S S , Bri ti sh
Telecom's Packet Switching System
and the international version called
IPSS.
Univesity computers are mainly
about powerful processing, and it is
often a good thing to try and gain
access to these systems i f you have
particularly large applications to run
on these machines. Or if you need to
access sp e ci ﬁc languages o r
information services that support the
science and engineering faculties
around the world.
Polytechnic computers a r e
probably t h e  l e a st interesting
computer systems available to  the
traveller. T h e y  o f f e r  s i m p l e
applications, but often offer a back
door entry into university computers
as they often have a PAD - very useful
way of accessing other computers from
a remote computer!
PADs are also very good at hiding
your tracks i f  you are a  hacker
interested i n prying into the inner
workings of a computer system. This
isn't merely done by logging on and
typing in a few commands, but by
reading up on the operating system
manuals, getting information out of a
'library, and asking your friends on a
BBS whether they have had any
experiences of such and such.
The spirit of hacking is learning._
so go on and learn something!
The Future
Not being particularly good a t
interpreting the future, I can only state
what may happen and not what is
going to happen. Computers are going
to have to get faster and faster. It is
true that even micros that move away
from IBMs self-imposed exile, are
using more and more powerful
processors and have more and more
memory that needs to be ﬁlled up more
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
29
and more quickly. After all, if you have
ever heard the old adage, "Th e
program expands to ﬁll the available
space", then you will no doubt see the
futility of accessing a database with
a modem running at 300 baud! How
are you going to  upload I  28K o f
program ﬁle using a slow speed?
The way around transmitting large
amounts of data down the line is to
go digital. By using a special digital
data line, you can theoretically go as
fast as 360,000 bits/ s (that's a far cry
from the 50 bits/ s 160 years ago!) and
even after speeds are possibly b y
splitting the telephone line so that the
Rx line (the receiving line) is on one
number, w h i l e  t h e  T x  l i n e
(transmitting) is on the other line!
Large mainframe establishments
are using parallel communications
over eight telephone lines nowadays,
and w i th  the data trafﬁc being
measured in gigabytes, the future of
parallel communications has to come
down to micro level in the next few
years.
Digital trafﬁc require special leased
lines at the moment, but with the
inclusion of X25 (which is just about
working - snigger) this leads the way
to parallel transmission down varying
frequencies, so you could transmit a
signal running on a carrier of 600 Hz
and 1200 Hz simultaneously, running
the Rx and the Tx signal at the same
time down the same cable with no loss
of data.
Light transfer is another option.
Using ﬁbre optical cable, modems may
soon be just transmitting bursts of light
down a  cable straight i n to  th e
telephone network. With this sort of
technology, only the speed o f  the
hardware is the limiting factor, so
transmitting at 360,000 baud may just
be a slow option -certainly we are
aiming for data transfer rates that are
faster than disk drives by the year 1990.
Of course this will all happen
overnight! Data cables using ﬁbre
optics are already i n  wide use
worldwide, but to be used over any
great distance requires a revolution in
manufacturing the optical cable, which
is very expensive at the moment.
Thankfully t h e  c a b l e
manufacturing companies a r e
developing ﬁbre optics so there will
be competing interests artiﬁcially
keeping th e  price o f  th i s n e w
technology high.
Faster c o m p u te r s , f a s t e r
communications lines and faster
modems, when will it all end? Never,
I hope!

I
machine code programming is to
jump straight in the deep end, and
start designing the routines yourself!
However it would be silly not to
take advantage of the library routines
already resident in your C64, namely
the Kernal and Basic Interpreter
routines. The saving i n  time and
memory should be obvious. After all,
why re-invent the wheel?
However, on the other side of the
coin, the ROM routines in your C64
have been written speciﬁcally to
operate the computer without i t
constantly crashing. Therefore a great
number o f safety checks have been
built into these ROM routines. This
has the drawback o f  making the
routines slower and less efﬁcient then
those you design yourself.
However, i f you ask yourself the
question, "Is i t really vital for the
routine I  need to execute that split
second quicker?", then you can make
a prudent decision, i.e. whether to
write a  routine yourself or use its
slower counterpart already in ROM.
As a whole, ROM routines, when
used correctly, execute quicker than
Basic. And this is an advantage you
should not forget!
The other disadvantage in using
ROM routines is if you want to make
your programs compatible with other
computers. Fo r example the BBC
computer uses the 6502 processor
which is completely compatible with
6510 (in fact, the 6502 is the parent
of the family o f microprocessors o f
which the 6510 is part of 1). So at least
in theory, any routine written for the
6510 can be executed on any BBC or
other compatible machine.
But obviously, even i f you don't
use any of the Kernal ROM routines,
there are still other difﬁculties to be
considered. For example, the screen
locations of the BBC computer are at
a different place in memory than those
of the CM.
Nevertheless, before using ROM
routines you should ask youself, if the
program needs to be portable.
Using ROM Routines
My advice is initially to kit yourself
Out with a decent disasembly of the
Commodore 64 Kernal and the Basic
ROMs.
The one which I use like a Bible
is called What's Really inside The
PROGRAMMINGMI
Calling a ROM routine
Byting
into the
6510
ROM routines can save you a lot of work and hassle.
But ﬁrst you'll have to learn how to use them - read on
Commodore 64 and written by Milton
Bathurst. I t  has the advantage o f
having l o ts  o f  remarks (some
disassemblies I've seen haven't got any
remarks!) and i t's published b y
DataCap, 12 Trixhai, B4545 Feneur,
Belgium. (1 bought my copy from
Boots.)
Studying such a  disassembly
thoroughly is a  very good way o f
learning how a professional machine
code program is written.
Secondly, it tells you all about the
routines in your Commodore ROM.
This allows you to use ROM routines
not only from the starting points which
are listed i n  ma n y books and
magazines (and also in this article), but
you can also use ROM routines in your
own way, maybe like nobody else has
used them before.
Most ROM routines are called with
a JSR  instruction, because th e
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
31
By Burghard-Henry Lehmann
majority of them are subroutines and
end with an RTS instruction. This
returns the program ﬂow back to your
own routine.
Before calling a ROM routine you
have to know which registers will be
used by it. Then, if you need any of
the values later on, you have to make
provisions to save them.
As we know there are two ways
of saving a variable. Transferring it
into the accumulator and then pushing
the contents of the accumulator onto
the machine stack o r  saving the
variable in an address (if possible, a
zero page address).
1 prefer saving in memory, because
it prevents the lethal bugs associated
with the intricacies o f the machine
stack and I know at all times where
everything is. Furthermore, I  can
recover things from that variable as
often as I like without having to worry
about pulling priorities.
It is important to be aware, which
memory locations are used b y the
ROM routine you want to call. This

is especially important when using a
zero page location. You then have to
know the exact calling address of the
ROM routine you want to use.
Although this may seem obvious,
some ROM routine listing calls give
the address of the vector and not the
proper start of the routine.
For example, one o f  the most
frequently used ROM routines is called
CHROUT, which sends an ASCII
character co n ta i n e d  i n  t h e
accumulator to  the current device
(mostly the screen). This can be called
from four different points: SFFD2,
SF ICA, SAB47 and $E716.
The start of the routine proper is
$E7 1 6 and is the best one to use i f
you don't want to waste any time.
SAB47 does some error checks before
jumping to the routine proper. $F1CA
is where the routine starts when it is
called from the vector at $0326.
Finally, $FTD2 is the vector on top
of the computer which in turn uses the
vector at $0326, which again starts the
routine proper at $F1CA.
ROM Typewriter
To give you a practical demonstration
of how ROM routines can be used I
have redesigned our little wordpro-
cessor program to work entirely with
ROM routines. This gives you a
demonstration o f some o f the most
often used ROM routines of the C64.
Also I have added an extra facility
which gives a printout of the current
line number and column number at
the top of the screen. This makes the
program more like a w o l
Figure I shows each ROM routine
I have used, in detail and what you
have to do to properly call them.
Figure 1 --• ROM Routines
Print (SEM)
Prints any ASCII character onto the
screen. Also executes non-printable
characters such as delete, cursor
movements, cursor home etc. Al l
registers are saved at the start of the
routine and recover again at the end,
including t h e  content o f  t h e
accumulator. So you don't have to
bother about saving anything.
P R O G R A M M I N G I I
Printstr (SABIE)
This routines prints a whole string of
characters ( m a x i m u m  z  2 5 6
characters!), including non-printable
characters at the current print position.
Before entering put the low byte of
the start of the string in memory into
the accumulator and the high byte into
the Y-register. Zero is used as the end-
marker of the string. Don't forget it!
All registers are corrupted b y the
routine and have, if necessary, to be
saved beforehand.
Printno (SBDCD)
Prints a  I6-Bit NUMBER a t the
current print position whose low byte
is contained in the accumulator, while
the high byte should be in the X-
register. This is used by basic to print
line numbers on the screen. A l l
registers are corrupted by this routine.
Plot (SFTFO)
Plots the current print position. The
current print position is contained in
the system variables $ID3 (column) and
$D6 (line). I f  the carry ﬂag is set,
transferred from those variables into
the X- and the Y-register. If the carry
ﬂag is clear, the values in the X-register
(column) and the Y-register (line) are
plotted onto the screen, that is, made
into the current print position. All
registers are corrupted by this routine.
Getin (SITE4)
Gets the value of the last key out of
the keyboard buffer and loads it into
the accumulator. If no key has been
pressed, 0  i s  loaded i n t o  th e
accumulator. A l l  registers a r e
corrupted by this routine.
(:Is ($E544)
Clears the whole Commodore screen
and places the current print position
to the top of the screen. All registers
are corrupted by this routine.
Let's n o w  look a t  th e  most
important points of the program which
you'll ﬁnd listed as always at the back
of the magazine.
In lines 340-350 I turn the system
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
32
cursor on b y loading the system
variable $CC with O. I f  i t should
contain a number larger than 0, the
cursor would be turned off.
The main loop o f  the program
consists o f  testing the keyboard,
exiting from the routine if Fl has been
pressed, printing the ASCII character
on the screen or executing a  non-
printable character, such as delete,
updating the line number if a new line
has been started and, ﬁnally, updating
the column number.
Since, as far as the operating
system is concerned, each line consists
of 80 characters, even though the
screen can only portray 40 character
lines, we have to make an adjustment
to the next 40 column line before
character 39 has been printed. This is
done in lines 570-650.
The ASCII character contained in
the accumulator is saved o n  the
machine stack. Then the current row
as contained in system variable $D6 is
incremented and the beginning of the
line plotted back to  column zero.
Finally, the A S C II character i s
recovered into the accumulator. Then
the ASCII character is printed.
After this the current line number,
contained in system variable $D6, is
saved in 251 and the current column
number, contained in system variable
$D3, is saved in 252. This is because
the print positions have to be replotted
in order to print the line number, and
column number at the top o f the
screen.
Next the current line number is
printed at the top of the screen. Since
the header takes up ﬁve lines, 5 is
subtracted from the current row as
contained in $D6 (lines 880-930). Next
the current column number is printed
at the top of the screen.
If a new line has been started, the
former column number is blanked out
with two spaces, otherwise one would
get column 11, instead of column 1
(lines 980-1090).
Finally, the current print position
is recovered from 251 and 252 and
replotted. Then the routine loops back
to get the next keypress.
The program as i t stands has
several drawbacks, such as the deletion
routine not working properly from one
line to the former. But I'll hope all
you people out there will get busy
mending these insufﬁencies and make
a fully working program out of it.

The Moving
Cursor Writes
/
word processing was a  thing o f
scorn. I n  a  review f o r  th e
Rubaiyat, Omar Khayyam wrote, The
moving ﬁnger writes; and, having writ,
moves on: nor all thy piety nor wit
shall lure it back to cancel half a line,
nor all thy tears wash out a word of
it.' Not very user friendly. When
Edward Fitzgerald translated the
Rubaiyat into ﬂorid verse, the age of
the typewriter was dawning and the
writing was on the wall for the moving
ﬁnger system.
Today the wordprocessor has
supplanted the typewriter and few
authors pummel plattens to beat their
unruly prose into a  semblance o f
literary w o r t h .  T h e  w o r d p r o
revolution means that corrections,
updates and re-arrangements can be
made with ease and there are few
people who would not beneﬁt from its
use.
Even for a humble job application,
the power o f the wordpro can be
harnessed to produce faultless text and
the days are numbered for liquid paper
correction ﬂuid. Even though the use

of the wordpro is so well accepted,
there is still the need to show what
is essential, what is desirable and which
features are rarely needed.
A wordprocessor is basically like a
typewriter. It allows text to be typed
in at the keyboard of a computer to
give a hardcopy on paper. Where a
wordprocessor differs lies in the fact
that it acts as an interface between the
keyboard and paper, expanding the
possibilities far beyond a typewriter's
wildest dreams.
The essential features o f  a
wordprocessor can he broken down
into three categories. There is the
actual entry o f text, the ability to
specify layout, and the facility to access
a printer and storage device. I n
addition to these essentials, the use of
a spelling checker can make life easier

Editing Facilities
The basic requirements of text editing
is to be able to type in characters at
a comfortable speed, see the text
displayed on the screen, and to correct
errors before the text is printed. All
of this can be achieved with many of
the microchip typewriters currently
available but a wordpro can do more.
Nobody's perfect so the wordpro
should allow the user to scan through
the te x t making deletions a n d
insertions. Major rewriting and the
addition of large blocks of text ought
to be possible.
Sometimes th i s modiﬁcation
process means that the whole structure
of the document needs to be changed.
In the bad old days this would mean
that yet another ball of paper would
whistle towards the wastepaper bin.
With a  wordprocessor i t is usually
possible to mark a block of text and
move it from one place to another or
to repeat it if it is a clause that is used
several times. This saves a  lot o f
retyping and consequently saves time
and tribulations.

With large documents, the user
may want to ﬁnd a particular word
or phrase and a search facility would
be useful. Mo st wordprocessors
contain a command line which in this
case is used to allow the searched for
text to be entered. The program will
then search through the document for
every occurence of the character string
and highlight it. At each ﬁnd the user
will be required to indicate whether
this occurence is the one desired. I f
it is not, the program will search for
the next appearance of the string.
The query is needed because the
program is not intelligent in the way
we are. If the desired string was the
word 'where', the computer would
highlight the string i n  words like
'wherefore', 'wherever', 'everywhere',
and so on as well as the word itself.
Added power can be added to this
command i f  a  replace function is
added. Now each time a word is found
it can be changed to another speciﬁed
word. As an example, the word 'Basic'
referring to the computer language
may be required in capitals. To search
for each occurrence would be tedious
but the search and replace function will
do most of the work for you. Once
again the user must okay any changes
because the word basic may have been
used i n  its true sense, o f meaning
fundamental in which case a change
is not necessary.
Formatting
On a printer the normal paper size is
A4 and a line width of between 60 and

80 characters is normal. The computer
screen of the C64 and Plus4/ C16 is
only 40 characters wide so it is difﬁcult
to show the shape of the ﬁnished text
as it will appear on the printed page.
To combat this many ingenious
methods have been tried.
Tasman's Tasword 64 program
uses a special small character set which
converts the screen to an 80 character
display. Even with the subsequent
halving o f horizontal resolution, the
characters are still readable but the
program also allows a  40 column
screen display to be used to clarify any
areas which may be a little difﬁcult
to read.
Most systems use the sideways
scroll which allows the viewer to scroll
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
37
across the page column by column.
This is as though the screen was a
window past which the page can be
scrolled left and right or up and down.
At any one time, the view is part of
the document measuring 40 characters
wide and 22 or more lines deep.
Homeword was a  cumbersome
program to use but had an excellent
feature which showed the formatted
page in the form of a window which
represented each character by a pixel
dot. Th e  general shape o f  the
document could then be seen and
altered to give a pleasing aspect.
Users o f the Cl28 with a  1901
monitor can access the 80 column
screen and many wordpros have
special versions included with the
normal C M  version to  enable this
facility to be used.
After treatment of text is the main
area where one vvordprocessor can
score heavily against another. The
minimum requirement is to be able to
specify the length and width of each
page b u t there is a  plethora o f
reﬁnements which can best b e
separated into two categories of style
and form.
In both cases the commands which
achieve the desired effect are produced
by special character strings, known as
embedded commands because they
form part of the text entry:
*it; this is an example of an embedded
command.
When the formatted viewing screen is
called u p , these commands are

executed rather than being displayed,
so the raw text is revealed:
This is an example of an embedded
command.
The theory only proves true to  a
limited degree because WYSIWYG is
not available. WYSIWYG simply
means What You See Is What You
Get and refers to  a screen display
which looks exactly the same as the
printed-out page. For many reasons
relating to efﬁcient use of memory and
character deﬁnition, it is not possible
to utilise WYSIWYG displays on the
Commodore. Instead a program may
highlight the characters which will
receive special attention by reversing
out the display o r  by some other
device.
Stylish Characters
Modern printers allow various styles
of characters to be used within a single
document. Enlarged characters, italics,
NLQ, different typefaces should all be
readily accessible to the user.
The overall appearance o f  the
document can be affected by the effect
known as justiﬁcation. This means
that characters can be aligned to the
left column leaving the right edge
looking ragged as each line has a
different number of characters. Right
justiﬁcation can also be employed
which means that extra spaces are
added to successive lines to make all
the lines the same width so that a
uniform block of text appears. Your
Commodore's pages right and left
justiﬁed. Glance through a  few
paragraphs of this text and you can
see the effect that this has on individual
lines.
If the line width is short, the
justiﬁcation process can result in two
words being separated on one line by
several spaces if the third word is too
long to ﬁt beside them. The way that
the third word is pushed onto the next
line is known as wordwrap and avoids
words being split in peculiar ways.
Let's see what happens when I give
the typesetter a headache by using a
very long word.
A l o n g  w o r d  l i k e
antidisestablishmentarianism causes
problems on a  line which has a
maximum character count of about 38
characters per line. There are two ways
in which this can be handled by the
typesetter. First, after the four short
WORDPRO R E V I E W
words a new line is started for the long
word. Th i s means th a t sixteen
characters are ranged across a line
which normally contains twice as
many characters. The result is a gappy
line. The second method o f treating
this situation is to break the longer
word but there is a convention to be
observed. Words should only be
broken down into syllables. The
computer program cannot tell where
syllables occur so some programs have
a device known as a 'soft hyphen'.
Soft hyphens are characters which
may or may not be displayed according
to a  single rule. Take the word
'somewhere' as an example.
If a soft hyphen is used the word
is written as some-where. When the
word some-where appears at the end
of a line it splits into its hyphenated
form. I f  there's enough ro o m,
somewhere isn't split and the soft
hyphen is ignored by the program.
The choice o f whether the soft
hyphen facility is useful or not depends
on the user. To create every word in
its hyphenated form would be a bind
but to be able to use it when previewing
the page before printout can avoid
problems occuring if changes are made
elsewhere in a paragraph which pulls
the word back into the middle of the
line. A hard hyphen would remain but
the soft one disappears.
When writing a  letter, my text
looks just as is does in this article; but
when submitting this article my
original text was double spaced. This
means that instead of issuing a single
carriage return at the end of the line,
two returns were sent leaving a blank
line between each printed line. This is
done so that there's plenty of space
for marking up special features such
as italics or for correcting grammar
and misspelt words.
Any wordprocessor for my use
must have the facility to double space
lines and the one I use can actually
triple space as well.
On the monitor each character is
given equal spacing. Some characters
like the letter 'm ' ﬁl l  the space
comfortably but letters like 'i' and 'I'
leave large gaps between themselves
and neighbouring characters. Examine
the text you're reading and you should
observe that the spaces between letters
are approximately the same on any
given line. This means that characters
next t o  the letter 'i • have been
automatically moved closer together.
This is known as proportional spacing.
The b e t t e r  p r i n te r s  c a n
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
38
proportionally space letters so the best
word processors are given commands
which allow access to this facility.
Patterns on a Page
The main features necessary to set up
a page for print are the margins. These
not only appear at the sides but also
at the top and bottom. To add to this
the page may not be A4 in height. So
there are ﬁve parameters which must
be expressed: page length, left and
right margins, and the bottom margin.
Left and right margins determine
the number of characters per line. The
normal value is 80 but there may be
occasions when a wide platten printer
is used and 132 characters or more can
he ﬁtted onto a  line. On  other
occasions AS paper may be required
so a much smaller page width might
be required.
The ability to  specify long and
short line widths is not the only feature
required because the preview option
needs to be able to range across this
number of characters, I f  it only has
a maximum o f  80 characters, the
preview screen is useless fo r wider
documents.
Once a line width is set, it is far
more interesting if the document has
indented sections t o  highlight
particular features. Some wordpros
allow temporary margins to  be set.
This could be done by simply inserting
spaces at the beginning of each line
but these spaces are saved when the
program is stored and means less space
for the document.
There are also occasions when each
paragraph may have a  heading,
correctly called a  sub-heading. One
way o f doing this is to indent the
following text to highlight each sub-
head. To  insert spaces on virtually
every line would be boring especially
when the power of the computer can
be called upon to do this dull task for
you,
Longer documents need page
numbers and for some uses each page
must have an identifying piece of text
across the top or bottom of the page.
It's a bind if you have to add this text
each time a new page is started or
ﬁnished. Even if the user accepts this
limitation, the real problem becomes
clear when a block of text is added
to the text later which completely
messes up the start and end o f the
pages following. Each page would Il

have to be laboriously altered. For this
reason a  header and footer facility
should be available.
The header and footer i s  a
command which allows a  string o f
characters to  be designated a t the
beginning of the text. This string will
then be repeated at the top or bottom
of each page and the facility normally
allows a  number character to  be
entered anywhere along the line A s
each new page begins the page number
is automatically incremented and
inserted.
The ﬁnal essential is a  centring
facility. To ﬁnd the correct position
for the start o f a  centred heading
means counting th e  number o f
characters in the heading, dividing it
by two and then subtracting this value
from th e  maximum number o f
characters per line. A centring facility
does this automatically but take care
when using expanded characters or
proportional spacing because I haven't
found a  program which copes
adequately with these situations.
Hard Lines
Some documents are longer than the
available memory allows. To  create
longer texts a linker can be useful. This
permits a line to be added to a ﬁle
which automatically searches for,
loads and prints the next document
in the chain.
When saving a document, there is
a need for a save and replace function.
The great disadvantage of a wordpro
is that i t stores the text as volatile
electrical impulses which can be wiped
out easily i f  the power supply is
interrupted. Regular saying of the text
is recommended i f disaster is to be
avoided. If the text is saved under a
new name each time, the disk soon ﬁlls
up with redundant ﬁles.
The alternative is to use the save
and replace function to  store an
ammended document under the same
name as before. The disadvantage with
this is that the program often uses the
inbuilt save and replace function of the
disk drive. This is a bugged feature
and can result in the loss of a ﬁle or
the corruption of another ﬁle.
It's difﬁcult to know if a wordpro
uses save and replace or if it scratches
the ﬁle before doing a normal save.
It is better to use two ﬁlenames and
address each on alternative saves.
The computer has a  limited
memory which is further reduced by
WORDPRO R E V I E W
the inclusion of the program itself. This
means that computer storage space is
at a premium and often a document
will overrun the allotted memory
space. Longer documents have to be
stored over several ﬁles and a linker
facility to chain them together makes
life a lot easier. A special code inserted
at the end o f  each document ﬁle
combines the ﬁles into a long chain
so th a t when each one ﬁnishes
printing, the next part loads and prints
automatically.
Special facilities to  call up the
directory and to send disk commands
are useful especially when formatting
a new disk for ﬁle storage. Equally,
the ability to send special codes to the
printer lengthens the life of a vvordpro
because p r i n te r  technology i s
advancing r a p i d l y  w i t h  n e w
commands and features being added
with each new machine.
Printers f a l l  i n t o  va ri o u s
categories. Commodore has its own
codes. Epson have a  different set,
compatibles may vary from the Epson
standard in small but important ways,
and there are still many manufacturers
doing their own thing where codes are
concerned.
There are three ways of combatting
the diversity needed. The cowards way
Out is to support one machine type and
let owners of the others battle with the
problem b y sending out character
string commands themselves or relying
on an external interface to cope with
the problem. The workman system is
to incorporate an interrogator which
asks for the information for creating
special effects. This information is then
stored as a block in memory which
asks for the information for creating
special effects, This information is then
stored as a block in memory which
can b e  saved and loaded when
required. The heroic, idiot-proof
system is my favourite where a front-
end is added to the program asking
what type o f printer is being used.
According to the response, a ready
made ﬁle is loaded from the master
disk and the system is up and running
from day one. This system also
incorporates the workman-like facility
for rare, exotic species of printer.
The more expensive wordpros
usually allow user deﬁned codes to be
issued, Special keys are reserved and
these can be pressed either to send
extra codes to  printers or to issue
strings of wordprocessor commands.
In all cases, colours of screen, border
and characters can be customised and
printouts should be easily aborted for
AmmonY O U R COMMODOREaugust1988
39
those times when some error becomes
obvious at a late stage.
Extra Powers
Many wordpros are now accompanied
by a spelling checker which will sift
through the text and query any word
which it doesn't recognise. The best
checker that I've used i s the one
accompanying Logotron's Writer
1295. It is both fast and has a good
initial vocabulary which can be edited
and expanded. Some spelling checkers
are laboriously slow and inﬂexible
incorporating words which, though
difﬁcult to spell, are hardly ever used
in common parlance.
A spell checker is a utility and not
a magic wand. For example, I seem
to have developed a  nasty habit o f
writing 'their' when I mean 'there'. I
know the difference but just can't seem
to break the habit. No spelling checker
will correct grammatical or syntaxial
errors so a command of the English
language is still a requirement of the
user.
For journalists like myself, a word
or character count is essential. Many
of the programs go beyond this and
give paragraph and sentence counts.
One feature which can be useful
if your work requires the manipulation
of ﬁgures is a  built-in calculator.
Normally these are limited in accuracy
to two decimal places for ﬁnancial
calculations.
The ﬁnal facility is one which is
purely a  business o r  club feature.
When a circular is to be sent as some
sort of mail shot, it can be extremely
time consuming changing addresses
and names t o  personalise these
communiques. A mail merge function
allows keywords from a  specially
constructed ﬁle to be substituted where
indicated in the text allowing a high
degree of customising to take place.
Most people will at some time be
subject to  the cunningly phrased
Reader's Digest special offer using
cosy phrases like: 'the Doyle family has
been specially selected', or 'imagine the
expression on the faces .of your friends,
Eric'. L o o k  careful l y a t  t h e
construction of the messages and you'll
soon realise that you're a victim of a
mail shot. How many children receive
special offers for themselves and their
wives or husbands! How many sub-
18 year olds have received the chance
to win a car of their own_ Computer
intelligence is limited!

The mail merge i s almost a
standard in small but important ways,
but some also l i n k through t o
databases which saves the unattractive
prospect of creating two such ﬁles. The
C128 version of Superscript can reside
in memory alongside Superbase. For
mail merge processing this has a
distinct advantage.
What to Look For
When buying a  wordpro the ﬁrst
consideration is to sit down and work
out w h i ch  facilities y o u  need.
anticipate those which may be of use
in the future and then start ploughing
through the range to ﬁnd a system that
suits your needs and your pocket.
Just because the program has
everything that you need doesn't mean
that it's deﬁnitely the one for you. If
possible ask fo r a  demonstration
because although most wordpros offer
similar basic features the way that the
end effect is achieved may not be
appealing.
Check that the program supports
the printer that you intend to use. A
bad selection here would be an
expensive error.
Some wordpros allow ﬁles to be
saved as ASCII ﬁles. The advantage
of these programs is that commonly
used ﬁles can be transferred to a new
wordpro i f  a  change i n  system is
considered and ﬁles can be transmitted
to any computer through a modem.
If modem linking is an essential
feature, Paperclip 128 has built-in
terminal software. A  comprehensive
program such as this means that
program hopping between wordpro
and terminal can be avoided.
Laziness should be avoided. It's
easy to say that buying the wordpro
that was everything, will cover all
future developments but the manual
will also be complex. This makes it
difﬁcult to sift out the essential features
that you require.
For most wordpros the manual is
an essential companion. Eventually
the commonly used codes will become
familiar but the lesser used commands
will have to be looked up. A manual
which has a potted guide to commands
can be a boon. Superscript has a very
useful menu display which can be
called up to readily access all of the
commonly used features. A program
with a Help screen can also be a good
buy.

Although the advantages of structured programming
are often mentioned, there seems little information
which explains how to achieve it! So for those of you
who would like to improve the standard of your
programs - read on!
By Derek Barrett
T
to admit to having done this,
home computer programmers
often write their programs by sitting
at the keyboard and just typing away.
If a new idea for a routine comes into
their head they slip in a GOTO and
add the new piece at the end. This leads
to 'Spaghetti' programs where GOTOs
are sprinkled randomly throughout
the code. Anyone who tries to read
such a program often ends up in a mess
trying to unscramble it.
This is not to say that the orderly
use of GOTOs is wrong sometimes the
only way round a problem is to use
them. It is only when they are used
indiscriminately that they lead to
confusion.
If you're used to designing your
programs by ﬂowcharts, you'll know
that even in the early stages, you must
think in terms o f the smallest detail
of code that will be needed in the ﬁnal
program. Constant redeﬁnition and
reﬁnement is needed to  the design
before it can be run.
The technique described i n  this
article allows you to start from simple
'root' ideas and reﬁne each step as you
progress through the design phase. The
ﬁnal design will look rather like an
inverted tree, with the branches
forming the paths of the design. That
is why the technique is called top down
design.
Each branch can be designed
independantly and in any order. Often
the easiest solution to a problem is to
start by thinking of how to produce
the output that will be required and
then work backwards through the
stages that are needed to produce that
output.
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988

Language Independant Code
An advantage of this method is that
the designs y o u  produce a r e
completely portable and can be coded
into any language on any computer.
So whether you program in Basic,
Pascal, Fortran or even assembler, the
same rules apply. You can also use the
technique fo r everyday decisions,
totally unrelated t o  computer
programming.
Think about this - you have just
produced a brilliant program. A friend
sees it and would like to run it on his
machine. However his computer is not
compatible, with a different dialect of
Basic, and anyway he prefers to
program in Pascal as he uses that at
work. With top down programming
there is no problem. Just give him a
copy of the design and he can code
it himself. This is much better than
trying to redesign the program from
your scrambled Basic.
The beauty of top down design is
that no complicated new terminology
or diagrams are used. If you can draw
a simple rectangle you can start to
design well-structured programs.
Right, let's get on with it. There
are only three elements to structured
design:
• Sequences
• Selection
• Repetition
Sequences
A sequence is the basic building block
of top down design; each box indicates
an action that will be carried out. The
top box indicates the program title and
is sub-divided into lower boxes which
indicate the processes needed for the
program to perform its function.
If you look at Figure 1 you'll see
A is a sequence of B to F which are
the main stages needed in a program
to compare the latest reading of a car
mileage with a previous reading and
printing the difference.
At this stage o f the design, the
program has been broken down into
manageable chunks with no attempt
to deﬁne the detail that will be needed
to code the problem. Imagine you are
writing a book_ Box A is the book title
and B to F are the chapter headings.
The contents of these chapters will be
written later. Similarly boxes B to F
will be broken down as the design
PROGRAMMING
continues until the ﬁnal solution is
reached. Each box contains one action
only and the temptation to group ideas
into one box must be avoided as it
rill lead to confusion.
Although Figure I  is shown as
being self-contained it could easily be
part of a much larger program, for
perhaps, a  vehicle ﬂeet servicing
record. Very often a large program is
best tackled by splitting it into sections
that can be considered seperately.
For those of you more familiar to
reading ﬂowcharts the position of the
linking lines from A to B, A to C etc.
may seem strange, but you will see the
reason for this when we expand the
ideas further.
Selection
This is the second of the structures to
be learnt and has the same function
as IF...THEN i n  Basic. The only
addition to  our simple box is the
addition of an 'o' in the upper right
of the box.
Figure 2 shows a simple example
of IF...THEN. You'll see that the
actions are a sub-division of box A
which serves as a 'Dummy' box i.e.,
it should be used as a comment line
in the ﬁnal code to aid legibility.
Box B is the IF part if the statement
and Box C contains a line to show
that nothing is to  be done i f  the
conditions of the IF statement is not
met,
Box D  forms the THEN part of
the statement. You will notice that the
instructions are written in pseudo code
to make it easier to use the features
of the language you will eventually
code in.
Figure 3 expands this example to
illustrate the IF...THEN...ELSE
construction found in most languages.
In this case there is an alternate action
to be taken, with the ELSE part of
the statement in box E. With this type
of construction, ﬂow is only allowed
to go from A to B or A to C.
In other words. if the condition of
B i s  TR U E, program ﬂo w  w i l l
continue at D  (C and E will not be
carried out). Conversely if B is FALSE
C and E will be carried out. You can
see from this that C in Figure 2 really
means ELSE DO NOTHING. A is a
selection of EITHER B or C but not
both. Figure 4 extends this to form
the CASE statement. In this case ﬂow
will go to one only of B,C,D or F.
Multiple conditions can also be
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
43
shown in the design (Figure 5) but you
must be careful as it is easy to design
a condition that can never be met, in
which case the program could 'hang
up' at that point. Box C can be coded
using the ELSE IF construction if your
language permits it. I t  is probably
better, at least until you are conﬁdent
in using the technique, to  use the
nested condition statements (Figure 6.)
Here boxes F,I and L  must be
included to allow ﬂow to continue if
the conditions a r e  n o t  m e t .
Incidentally I  have used letters
adjacent to the boxes purely for ease
when explaining the principle. Some
software designers use nested numbers
instead and I  tend not to bother at
all. It is entirely up to you.
Walking Through The Design
Before we go any further it is essential
that you check the design thoroughly
before you start to code it. The usual
method is to 'walk' through the design,
using dummy data, to ensure that it
has the desired result and that no
hidden traps have been put in.
The rule for reading a top down
design is to start at the top and work
down each branch, working from the
left to the right.
Draw up a table of dummy data
that will allow all the conditions of
the stage to be tested. Now 'walk'
through the design using this data to
see where you end up.
We have entered the design at A,
which is a sequence of B,C and D. Our
tests are only concerned with the detail
for C at this stage.

We have now reached the end of a
'branch' so we must go back to E. As
this is an IF...THEN condition we
cannot proceed to H or I so we exit
back to C which is also an IF___ THEN
so we go on to D. This is vital to the
concept of Top Down and believe me
it is easier to do than describe.

Get the idea now? But was it the result
you expected? I f  i t was you have
succeeded in your design. If it wasn't
then go back and re-design the bits
that didn't work. A lot of reﬁning is
often needed at this stage, but the more
time spent getting the design right leads
to less frustration when you run your
masterpiece and ﬁnd that i t doesn't
work as you expected, or, even worse,
doesn't work at all.
Repetition
On to the last of the three elements.
That o f  repetition, also known as
iteration. You've all used the familiar
FOR...NEXT construction o f Basic,
and p o s s i b l y  t h e  a l l i e d
REPEAT.... UNTIL or WHILE D O
of more advanced languages. These are
all forms of repetition. Repetition is
merely the forming of a loop to do
the same action many times over.
Once again we will use the familiar
rectangle but this time add an asterisk
(*) in the upper right of the box that
is used as the control element.
I'm afraid space doesn't allow us
to run the whole article, and so look
out for the second installment in the
near future.

POKES, data statements and variables
are needed to achieve the simplest beep
— things could certainly be easier. Due
to the physical structure of the chip,
most of SID's registers are immune to
PEEKS. This means that accepted bit
switching techniques won't work and
your programs become a  mess o f
variable arrays, or worse!
For e xa mp l e , P0KE53265,
(PEEK(53265)AND2"5) will set bit 5
of the VIC control register, enabling
VIC's bit map mode. P0KE54283,
(PEEK(54283)AND2 5) would be an
easy way to select voice 2's sawtooth
waveform, but as a PEEK to  that
location always returns a zero, as do
all S1D's registers (except the two
paddle registers at 54297 and 54298),
it's not a lot of use to us. This is one
problem easily solved

wedges itself into the 64's interrupt
system. All it does is set up a dummy
SID in RAM, copying its contents into
the real SID every 60th of a second.
Once the program is installed, any
value poked into the RAM table is
automatically co p i e d  i n t o  i t s
corresponding SID register. Thus you
can PEEK the RAM table, perform
your maths on the value, and POKE
it back again. The earlier example will
now work, once the address has been
changed to point to the RAM table.
The code was originally written to
sit at $C000 (49152), and load in direct
from disk, but to make things easier
still. I've produced a Basic generator
program that will install a working
version of the code anywhere in RAM,
and save a copy to disk. SIDR FAD
is the program generator, and before
you run it, make sure you set the base
address in line 60 (it defaults to 49152
($C000). Beware though, if you try to
put the code under the ROM, or any
reserved RAM area (zero page, screen
RAM etc), it won't work.
When you Run the generator, the
start and table address are displayed
and it's probably worthwhile writing
them down. Disk users get the option
here of saving a working copy of the
code to disk, just follow the screen
prompts. To load the code back again,
use LOAD"ﬁlename",8,1
With the code in place, SYS(base
address) will clear SID and initialise
the table. Any poke to the table will
automatically b e  copied t o  th e
corresponding SID register. Should
you happen t o  h i t RUNSTOP/
RESTORE, you will need t o  re-
initialise the table before using it again,
use either SYS(base address) o r
SYS(base address + 10). The latter will
re-initialise without clearing SID.

Getting it all in
SIDTEST is a demo program, load
and run it, and nothing happens! This
is because the program relies on
PEE King SID. Next, load and run the
generator program, and re-load SID
TEST. Now change line 10 to read
SID=(base+49) a n d  R U N  ( i f
SIDREAD was R u n  unaltered,
(base+49) should equal 49201). If all
has gone well, you'll know about it!
Once you've created a  working
copy of the code at a suitable address,
you're not restricted to using it in Basic
programs make use o f i t i n  your
machine code programs as well! I f
64 P R O G R A M M I N G
Figure I - ADSR cycle
your machine program also uses
interrupts - no problem. SIDREAD
automatically uses the contents o f
$0314 and $0315 for its Jump back
to the normal interupt system, so all
you need to do is initialise any other
interupt routines before initialising
SIDREAD.
Using the Tables
The tables are arranged i n  three
groups. Tables (a), (b), and (c) map

out the registers in their various groups
(individual voice controls, overall
controls and output registers), while
tables (d) to (h) show what each section
does within certain registers. Finally,
table (i) shows the ranges that SID's
functions can be set to.
To set any single bit in a control
register to a 'I', use this simple formula
(in conjunction with the SIDREAD
program):
POKE B A S E  +  R E G ,  P E E K
(BASE+REG) AND VALUE
Table d - Control byte: Registers 4, 11, 18
Table I - Sustain/Release: Registers 6, 13, 20
: 0 = start Release

and to turn a bit off, use:
POKE BASE + REG,PEEK (BASE
+ REG) OR 255-VALUE
Where BASE is the start o f the
RAM table, REG is the register
number and VALUE is the binary
'weight' of the bit in that register. (The
ﬁgure in the 'value' column o f the
table.)

contests, however i t didn't provide a  direct
confrontation between Patton (who arrived one week
after the landings) and Rommel (who was injured one week
before). Electronic Arts, not letting facts get in the way
of a good simulation, has produced a game that matches
these two in a head to head ﬁght.
The game was written by Chris Crawford, who wrote
the all time classic Eastern Front, and provides the same
simple but realistic game mechanics and a tough computer
opponent.
Unlike, other wargames where the object is to defeat
the enemy forces, Patton vs Rommel, is a battle for territory
in the shape of towns. The allied forces have just a few
days to break through the German lines and capture as
many towns as possible by moving through them. The
German player must halt their progress and maintain their
thin line of defence for as long as possible.
The state o f the game, which is played in turns, is
represented as a victory point total which will begin and
stay negative until the allies take towns, when i t will
gradually increase until a positive score announces an allied
victory. A German player must keep the score negative to
win the game either by halting the allied advance or by
retaking captured towns.
The screen display is entirely black and white, which
is never explained except it may be to mirror the Macintosh.
Though why ignoring the C64s excellent graphic capabilities
is beyond me.
Most of the screen is ﬁlled by a fraction of the battle
map and can be scrolled across it by moving a window
over the map icon. The dark areas represent high ground
and slows down progress that enters it. Conversely, the white
roads connecting the towns form the quickest way to travel.
There are just two types of units in the game infantry
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
49
and tanks although these symbols actually represent more
accurate forces, such as supporting artillery which are
displayed whenever a unit is selected. By clicking other icons
the units can be displayed instead as arrows showing which
way they are facing, circles representing the total and actual
strengths and by dots or widening cracks showing the
damage they have sustained, A badly cracked unit could
run if it met a determined and even weaker opponent.
To issue an order to a unit is a simple case of selecting
(clicking) it and then pointing to where you want it to go.
In the basic game it will try and move there as quickly
as it can but will stop and ﬁght any enemy units it goes
near. In the intermediate level you must give more speciﬁc
orders by clicking icons that command a  unit to turn
clockwise or anti-clockwise and move forward in one of
seven modes which range from the rapid movement, but
open to attack road to the artillery assault of static attack
mode.
Whatever your orders the computer will then carry them
out before either Patton or Rommel, and where appropriate
will comment on your performance and may even pass on
the odd tip.
Once you have broken through or  held the lines o f
defence several times you may be looking for the new
challenge that's ready and waiting, and allows you to edit
the game to produce a much tougher Expert level game.
Patton vs Rommel has a few quirks such as the mono
display, but is well thought out and will challenge even
experienced computer generals.

The Commodore tape system is renowned for its
reliability but unfortunately it is equally well known ﬁr
its lack of speed. Here's your chance to load programs
from tape almost as quickly and as reliably as when
using a disk drive

T
program which is saved as the
ﬁrst program on a  tape and
stores all the names of all the programs
on the tape presenting them as a menu.
Once a program is chosen the tape is
wound on at fast speed to the start
of that program, as this wind-on is
controlled entirely by the directory
program there is n o  need to  sit
watching the tape counter_
The program can then he loaded
using th e  fa st loader which i s
automatically installed b y  t h e
directory.
Creating The Program
First of all type in program 1. This
program contains the machine code
fast load routines. When the program
is correct SAVE a copy for later use
and then run the program.
Having run program I you should
delete the program using NEW and
then type in program 2. Do not run
the program at this stage or you may
cause the computer to crash with the
SYS command. SAVE a copy of the
program.
When you are satisﬁed that the
program is correct you should put a
blank tape into the recorder with the
junction o f the leader tape and the
magnetic recording tape positioned on
the felt pad of the cassette (accurate
positioning of the tape each time the
directory is altered and resaved means
the directory never overwrites other
programs on the tape).
With the tape in position type in
SYS 49887. This calls a machine code
routine to transfer the fast loader to
the end o f the BASIC program and
then saves both the BASIC and
machine code as a single composite
program. The composite program can
be loaded and saved in exactly the
same way as a normal BASIC program
but once the machine code is added
the BASIC program cannot be edited.
If there are any errors in the program
they must be corrected before calling
SYS49887.
To save a program from an ordinary
tape onto a directory controlled tape
you should ﬁrst load the directory
from the beginning of the cassette and
overwrite the appropriate D A TA
C64 PR O G R AMMIN G
statament with the name o f your
program. Take care not to alter the
length of the DATA statement and
cheek that PEEK (3072) returns the
number 169. On ce  th e  D A T A
statement is correctly altered you
should th e n  resave th e  altered
directory in the same position on the
tape as the original (by positioning the
junction between the leader tape and
the magnetic tape on the felt pad of
the cassette). Do not press stop, or
rewind the tape. Run the program and
follow the screen prompts. The tape
will wind on automatically to the start
of the sector in which the program is
going to be stored. Remove the tape
without rewinding and keep to one
side. Now load the program you want
to save and when correctly loaded
replace the directory tape i n  the
recorder and fast save the program
using ES "name o f program". The
program i s  n o w  saved o n  th e
appropriate sector and can be directly
accessed by the directory.
Loading Programs
This is the easy part. Load and run
the directory. Follow all the screen
prompts (especially the one that says
stop the tape!). Use fL  to load your
program and press the space bar or
Commodore key once the FOUND
a p p e a r s andthat'sal ltherei s
to it. This program is very efﬁcient at
ﬁnding and loading programs and is
the most invaluable program I have
ever used.
I never use cassettes larger than
C20 as I ﬁnd longer tapes take more
time to wind on to programs and they
stretch and break more easily. One side
of a C20 can store up to ten 20K
programs which I ﬁnd is enough on
one tape though the directory does
have sufﬁcient DATA statements for
up to 20 programs if you want to use
longer tapes.
The sectors deﬁned b y  th i s
program are large enough to  store
programs up to  20K, i f  a longer
program is saved it will occupy more
than one sector so be careful when
using long programs not to overwrite
any programs already stored on the
tape. I f  most o f your programs are
longer than 20K then the sector size
can be increased by increasing the 250
in l i n e  130 t o  su i t yo u r  o w n
requirements, or if your programs are
much shorter you can save time and
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988

tape b y  decreasing t h e  2 5 0
appropriately.
How the Directory Works
The tape motor can be controlled by
POKEing registers I and 192 with the
appropriate numbers (POKE 1,39
stops the tape and POKE1,7 starts it
again) a s i n  lines 110 t o  140.
Unfortunately the operating system
constantly checks to see i f a key is
depressed on the datasette and resets
both registers appropriately. The way
I have got round this is to have a tight
loop constantly POKEing the registers
until the space bar is pressed. This
allows the datasette to be changed
from PLAY to FASTFOR WAR D etc
without the tape motor starting up.
When the space bar is pressed the tape
motor is started (by POKE 1,7) and
the tape is wound on at fast forward
speed to the beginning of the chosen
sector.
The timing of the wind-on uses TI,
the internal clock of the 64 which is
incremented every I 60th of a second.
How long to wind on, and therefore
how far along the tape the sector is,
is determined by the number of the
chosen program and a constant (250
in this case). This divides the tape into
sectors of approximately 120cm length
which is about 50 secs of recording
time or 4.2secs at fast forward speed.
Each sector can hold about 20K o f
program using the fast load routines
or slightly less than 2K using a normal
save.
The machine code fastload i s
transferred into memory from 49152
to 50176. This area is not normally
used by BASIC and should not cause
problems with BASIC programs but
the fastload will be incompatible with
any machine code routines which use
this area o f memory. The program
alters the character dispatch vector
($308 & 309) to allow the EL, ES and
EV commands to be implemented. If
you want to  disable the fast load
routines then SYS5845 I will restore
the normal vectors while SYS49215
will reinstate the fast load.
The directory program can he used
without the fast load using the normal
save and load routines but the 250 in
line 130 needs to be greatly increased
to accomodate the greater tape length
needed by the slow save. If the machine
code i s  omitted th e n  th e  SYS
command mush also be omitted or the
computer will crash.

GAME R E V IE W
e's your chance to  become a  junior wizard,
apable of wielding limited powers who sets out
to become the chief wizard by beating the best seven
magicians in the land.
Armed with only four spells in your spellbook you stride
out into the wilderness which scrolls inside an unusual
circular window which is ﬂanked on either side by the
spelibook, image and physical, spiritual and mental levels
of you and your opponent.
The task ahead is split into three levels that must be
completed in order. First of all you must explore seven
towns that are spread across the land and do battle with
six monsters. Defeating these monsters will grant you access
to the treasure they guard which can be traded with the
relevant town for food to top up your three energy bars.
Once you have killed all six monsters and have delivered
the treasure to all six towns the seventh leads to level 2.
Level 2 provides a test to see whether a wizard is strong
enough to challenge the seven master magicians. The contest
comprises 30 monsters each with unique strengths and
abilities. Three of these possess magical artifacts that must
be collected i f the player is to gain access to level 3 and
a duel to the death with the seven wizards.
To complete the game the player must ﬁght and defeat
each of the master magicians, beginning with the Wolf Lord
and Bear Lord and ending with a ﬁnal battle with the Dragon
Lord.
The key to success in your quest lies in the spells that
you wield from the four that you can select at the beginning
of the game, to the others that you earn by defeating the
monsters in level 2. Any spells that you gain must be stored
on an empty page in your spell book, so there are times
in the game when you will have to face the difﬁcult decision
as to which spell to erase from your book.
The spells are split into three groups and represent the
magic drawn from physical, spiritual and mental power.
Physical spells include the more usual ﬁreballs, walls of
ice, magic missiles and rock showers associated with fantasy
games. However in Wizard Warz you can wield the Fear,
Evil eye, far Vision and protection from evil spiritual spells
and the mental trickery of Forget, Invisible and Mind rack.
The result is a mixture of arcade action and roleplaying
that creates one of the ﬁrst true arcade adventures. T . H .

days o f  computing. A
computer utopia was dawning,
the Z X  81 had matured into the
Spectrum and the V1C-20 was being
superceded by the Commodore 64.
Magazines were full of articles relating
to the revolutionary beneﬁts of the new
technology. Home accounts would be
held on computer, databases would
hold all the names, addresses and
birthdates of friends and relatives, and
the computer would even control the
improved household gadgets which
would result. To brutally paraphrase
Plato, the reality has proved to be less
than the dream.
Small businesses could certainly
beneﬁt through the use of the Cl28
and many would even ﬁnd the C64
and disk drive beneﬁcial but the
problem here is one o f credibility.
Amstrad's Al a n  Sugar observed
recently that business people prefer to
use equipment which is not identiﬁed
with the domestic market. Bigotry

By Norman Doyle
such as this probably explains why the
Commodore PET was so successful
with large and small businesses but,
in the shadow of the PC, the C128
has not prospered.
Application Error
Computopia was not achieved for one
main reason - in most cases the tasks
are not complicated enough to merit
the time and trouble of loading and
using the software. Until hard disks
become cheaper o r an even better
instant retrieval system is devised,
home acounts will be worked out on
cornﬂake packets, hi-tech database
will still be called Filofax and home
gadgets will retain an unfathomable
mind of their own. The only area where
a computer has proved beneﬁcial is in
the realm o f  wordprocessing and
leisure pursuits.
One o f  th e  mo st rewarding
pastimes is programming - it stretches
the mind and usually rewards the
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988

programmer with something that can
be used over and over again. One of
the less pleasurable aspects i s
debugging. Everyone would like to
create something that works ﬁrst time
but that isn't always possible.
Whatever t h e  ma ke  o f  th e
computer, one thing they all have in
common is the fearsome error message
generator. The Commodore 64 has 33
of these messages and the CI 28 has
44, as shown in the panel. Over the
next few issues First Steps will look
at each message in turn and consider
the reasons why these occur and how
to ﬁnd, correct and avoid them.
Too Many Files
Occurenee: rare
When this error is reported the
program has attempted to open more
than ten ﬁles. The simple solution is
to check that all the ﬁles are necessary
and prune out those which are not
needed or redundant.

If such an inordinate range of ﬁles
is necessary, it is unlikely that they will
be receiving information s i m -
ultaneously. In multiple ﬁle programs,
it is always good practice to open a
ﬁle, read o r  write the information
necessary and then close i t again
immediately.
File Open
Occurenee: program error
When opening a ﬁle there are three
values following the OPEN command.
The ﬁrst is the ﬁle number which can,
with few exceptions, be any number
between I and 255. The second value
is the device number and the third is
the secondary address w h i c h
determines the kind of operation that
is to take place.
The ﬁle number is the one used
when communicating with a  device
using ﬁle handling commands such as
PRINT # , IN PU T # a n d  GET#  .
This error means that an open ﬁle is
already using the value. I f  you like,
the ﬁle number is a connection from
the computer to one peripheral device.
Although several of these lines can be
attached to the same device, it is not
possible to  connect more than one
peripheral on a single line.
The solution to this problem is to
allocate a different number to the ﬁle.
With 255 numbers to choose from this
shouldn't be difﬁcult because only ten
ﬁles can be open at any one time (see
too many ﬁles).
File Not Open
Occurence: program error
This also relates to the ﬁle number and
occurs when a ﬁle handling command
uses a value which has not yet been
allocated to any device. The answer
to this is simple, either open a new
ﬁle or ﬁnd a ﬁle which has already
been opened and allocate the value to
the handling command.
File Not Found
Occurence: user error
This is principally a disk error and
simply means that a ﬁle for loading
or verifying has not been found on the
disk currently in the drive. This can
result when the wrong disk is in the
BEGINNERS
drive, i f  the directory has been
corrupted in some way, or through
typing errors.
The only way around the corrupted
disk error is to shrug your shoulders
and promise to be more careful in
future, format a new disk and start
again. Otherwise the answer is to check
the directory and then insert the
correct disk or correct the spelling of
the ﬁle name.
Be careful and this error should
never oectin
Device Not Present
Occurence: user error
This is displayed as a ﬁle command
issued to a peripheral which is not
connected or is turned off. Care should
be taken when this occurs. If the device
is connected it can usually be switched
on with no problem. If it has not been
connected the only safe solution is to
switch the computer off and start again
after connecting the device.

If the device is the cassette recorder
or disk drive and a  program is in
memory, which will be lost i f  the
computer is switched o ff, drastic
measures must be taken. Ensure that
the device is switched off and that any
other peripherals connected through it
are also off. Next check that the plug
is correctly positioned for insertion
and then conﬁdently push the device
connector into the relevant computer
port. DON'T wiggle the plug about.
Finally switch the device on.
This procedure is contrary to any
safety regulations and should only be
used as an emergency measure. Lack
of care will result, at best, i n the
computer doing a warm start or reset
—at worst you could damage the input/
output chips inside the computer,
peripheral or both!
Cartridges a n d  u s e r  p o r t
connections should ONLY be done
with the computer turned off. It is very
easy to misalign these connections and
short across terminals which should
never ever meet.

McGibbetts is back for another series of adventures
in Inﬁltrator II.
The world class printer, TV  and ﬁlm mega star,
consultant to every free world leader and all round nice
guy has been called back into action to once again thwart
the Mad Leader's evil schemes. The call came just in time
as you were sliding from the front page 23! Not exactly
the ideal situation for a hero who craves the limelight. Now
,e Mad Leader has reorganised his forces and you're back
usiness in another trio of impossible missions.
ission consists of three parts. First you must

he ﬁrst mission you must discover the Mad Leader's
ical labs and neutralise a vast o f deadly nerve gas,
n return in part two to discover and deactivate his
missiles and cause a meltdown in the Leader's nuclear
reactor before completing the game by tracking down the
madman himself and by installing a brain plant which turns

, Flying the Gizmo to the target requires a combination
kill to keep in the air and to make sure you arrive
ase with enough fuel to get home, strategy to plan and
cover your route and skill deciding your reactions to

you are the Inﬁltrator which happens to be your password
for friendly forces, but you can fool the enemy with the
password ID Overlord. If you give the wrong response then
you'll need all your wits as well as your Gizmo's guns,
rockets, ﬂares and chaff launchers to survive the battle.
At the base, the screen display and game changes from
a ﬂight simulator that incorporates thumbovision to a tense
ground mission. Whichever mission you are on, you will
be up against overhwelming odds and so you will have
to use cunning and stealth to gain entry rather than attempt
a doomed assault. Armed with joystick and selected false
papers you should be able to get past most guards, however
our hero has a sleeping gas cannister up his sleeve in case
the papers don't impress and a stock of grenades if things
get really tough.
Inside the buildings the display changes once again as
McGibbets searches through the rooms for more weapons,
a change of uniform, security passes and the key to his
mission either the vat of chemical gas, missiles or the Mad
Leader himself.
The game is both challenging and enjoyable as you relish
the chance to be a hero that's completely over the top,
and to add to the value the original Inﬁltrator is included
in the game pack. Two games for the price of one can't
be bad!

PROGRAMMING
Save on phone bills with this intelligent
modem software
W
constantly falling, bulletin
boards are using intelligent
modem equipment that accept a
variety o f incoming baud rates. The
caller wants to use as high speed as
possible to minimise both his waiting
time and telephone bill. Cheap RS232
type modems can often cope with both
3001300 and 1200/75 baud and unless
you are planning to upload software,
1200175 is by far the best to use - after
all, most of your time is spent reading
rather than writing.
A scrolling terminal emulator is
very easy to program i f you restrict
yourself t o  3001300 since t h e
Commodore RS232 implementation
can cope with this directly. There is
even a  perfectly useable BASIC
version in the Programmers Reference
Guide. However, t o  allow th e
computer to send at a different rate
to the one at which i t is receiving
requires a little more work. 1200 baud
is also too fast for BASIC and machine
code needs to be used to make sure
that the receiver buffer does not
overﬂow.
The real beneﬁt o f  the faster
reception i s  when i t  i s used t o
download software from a  bulletin
board. However, there is always the
problem of telephone line noise, and
so, some form o f error checking is
needed. This program uses the very
common xmodem protocol.
How it Works
o.1
ANN&
The program consists o f a BASIC
section that does all the setting up
required. There is no rush for this.
Terminal emulation and the xmodem
part are in the machine code section.
Terminal emulation consists o f
sending the character codes of the keys
pressed to  the RS232 output and
printing the received character codes
onto the screen. Bulletin boards work
in proper ASCII which has the upper
and lower case letters reversed,
compared with Commodore. This
conversion needs to be performed for
both transmitting and receiving. Any
control codes may be sent to the RS232
output, but they are ﬁltered out of the
input t o  p re ve n t misreceived
characters effecting the display.
Standard KERNAL routines have
been rewritten to allow an independent
baud rate.
The xmodem protocol consists of
sending or receiving 132 byte packets.
Each packet consists of SOH (ASCII
1) followed by the packet number and
the 2's complement o f  the packet
number, Then, there are 128 bytes of
data and ﬁnally a single byte checksum
calculated b y  ta ki n g  th e  least
signiﬁcant byte from the sum of the
data bytes. Transfer is initiated by the
receiving computer sending N A K
(ASCII 21).
The sending computer then sends
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
58
A
out the ﬁrst 132 byte packet. If the
packet number and the checksum are
correct, the receiving computer will
them send ACK (ASCII 6) and the
sender will send the next packet, but
if either of these values are wrong, then
NAK is sent to tell the sender to repeat
that packet. The ﬁnal packet has its
data padded out to  128 bytes by
control-Z (ASCII 26) characters, and
when the sending computer is asked
for another packet, i t  sends EOT
(ASCII 4) instead of SOH and waits
for a reply of ACK before stopping.
This may all seem a little long-
winded, but i t does mean that any
transmission error should be detected,
and t h e  whole ﬁl e  should b e
transferred correctly. A mistake of a
single byte can mean that a program
will not work.
Getting it all in
There are two versions of the program;
one for the C64 and one for the C128.
These are both BASIC programs
which poke i n  the machine code
program each time the progam is run.
The machine code section has built in
error checking and the BASIC section
can be modiﬁed as required. Simply
type it in. The Cl28 version works in
both 40 and 80 column modes and
automatically switches to fast mode
where possible.

In Use
When the program runs without any
errors, you will be confronted by a
menu. The baud rate and protocol
options are self evident. If neither is
used, then the RS232 port is set to
300/ 300 baud, 8 data bits, I stop bit
and no parity. This can be changed
if required.
Online opens the RS232 channel
and enters the terminal mode. This will
switch most modems online, but you
may have t o  d o  this manually.
Normally, you need to  dial the
required telephone number, wait until
you hear the computer answer tones
and then switch the modem to online.
You may also need to hit return a few
PROGRAMMING 111
By William Sellers
times to get the other computer to
acknowledge you. To get back to the
main menu, press Commodore-Q.
Xmodem send and receive are
(surprisingly) for sending and receiving
ﬁles with the )(modem protocol. To
use these, access the bulletin board
with the online option and activate ﬁle
transfer at  that end. Then press
Commodore-Q to return to the menu
and select the send or receive option
as required. You will then be prompted
for a  ﬁlename and the display will
show the status o f the ﬁle transfer.
When this has ﬁnished, you will be
returned to the main menu. To abort
at any stage, press Commodore-Q.
Xmodem on the host is often cancelled
with Control-X. Note: xmodem will

ASCII/ Pet conversion i s f o r
converting between the two character
coding systems. Conversion from
ASCII to Pet codes also removes any
line feeds from the ﬁle since these are
usually unwanted. Other control codes
are left unaltered.
Other Uses
Xmodem is often used for ﬁle transfer
along RS232 lines between computers
so this program is quite handy for
getting your Commodore to talk to
any other computers you may own -
assuming you have suitable software
for them.

n Trilogic launched its
xpert cartridge the boast
was that a RAM cartridge
can do anything that a ROM could
do. Trilogic proved true to its word
until the release o f Datel's Action
Replay Professional IV cartridge with
WA RP 25 fast disk loader, The Expert
just couldn't keep pace.
Now the RAM cartridge is hotting
up the cart wars with a new operating
system. Expert V3.2R, which includes
a n e w  program called Rocket
Turboload which intends to take on
WARP at its own high speed game.
The principal at stake is that The
Expert is based on a RAM chip which
can be programmed from disk or tape
A lltr IM M E I,M T
HARDWARE R E V I E W
but Dates ARP IV is ROM based.
This means that an update for The
Expert costs the price of a new disk
(13.50) but an update for ARP IV
means the price of a new cartridge
(currently 04.95).
Although The Expert offers many
more utilities, the ARP IV cartridge
has an extremely fast disk loader which
gives it a slight edge for some users.
Rocket Turboload attempts to
redress the balance in its favour but
how do the two systems compare?
Round One
Can the new Ever ca tridge
disk system broadside
WARP 25?
A program was chosen which ﬁlled up
202 blocks o f  computer memory
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988

($080 I -$CFFF). The saving disks were
freshly formatted so that the search
time for both system's reloaders would
be the same. To use WARP all that
needs to be done is to plug in the
cartridge, load the program for saving,
switch the cartridge in and then save.
After this a loader program is required
which loads as a no block boot,
The Expert is more ﬁddly to use.
First the operating system has to be
loaded into the cartridge, then the
routine follows a similar path as the
WARP system but a ﬁnal step has to
be added. A  fresh disk has to  be
formatted, a second program (Rocket
Turboload) has to be loaded, and the
program for saving is transferred from

the normal Expert disk to the newly
formatted d i sk through Rocket
Turboload.
On balance the ﬁrst round goes to
ARP IV for convenience but Expert
scores highly because fewer program
conditions trip out the system. ARP
IV efﬁciency against Expert reliability.
Round Two
Compression of the program rendered
a reduction from 202 to 172 blocks
on ARP IV. Expert initially reduced
the program to 158 blocks but after
processing through th e  Rocket
converter this increased to 167 blocks.
A slight points advantage to Trilogic.
Reloading the program through
the ARP IV  WARP system always
means loading the loader program
ﬁrst. This displays a menu and the
cursor has to  be moved onto the
program required. The RETURN key
then initialises the load. The load took
about ﬁve seconds.
Rocket is easier to use as long as
you know the program's name. Using
the normal LOAD command followed
by "R*progname,8,I automatically
boots the program. This load took
about seven seconds.
Although it is obvious that WARP
still has a slight edge on speed, the
need to  select through the loader
affects the overall speed depending on
how quickly the user loads and runs
the menu, selects the desired program
and presses RETURN. On balance the
second round goes to The Expert for
convenience of use.
HARDWARE R E V I E W
Round Three
The ﬁnal round is a measure of the
stamina o f  both the contestants.
Which can survive the longest'?
Both cartridges o ffe r special
'shaping' utilities through which pokes
and inﬁnite lives can be added, and
both have respectable memory
monitors. Once again The Expert has
the edge with joystick port swapping
so that all games will use the port of
your choice, a  Sprite Extractor
program to  allow the viewing and
saving a much improved sprite editor,
and an inﬁnite life creator which
doesn't work on all programs but will
work on many.
The knockout punch is rammed
home because T h e  Exp e rt i s
reprogrammable and there is still room
for future additions to the system at
low cost. ARP IV  additions would
have to be added onto a new chip and
sold at ten times the cost of an update
disk.
Naughty but Nice?
The co n tro ve rsy surrounding
cartridges swirls with ever increasing
intensity. Are these skeleton keys for
use by thieves to unlock protected
programs or are they useful teaching
utilities which can lay bare the bones
of programming structures? The fact
that the cartridges can be used to copy
most software programs does open up
the piracy ﬁeld but, as Alan Sugar
proved recently with his twin cassette
decks, it is not illegal to advertise or
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
61
sell equipment which has a legitimate
use.
Let's face it, many programmers
and programming houses makes use
of Th e  Expert and i ts  k i n  f o r
developmental a n d  exploratory
purposes. C a n  anyone  j u s ti fy
condoning through private use while
condemning a  product i n public?
Cartridges MUST never be used for
piracy but how can anyone learn
progressive programming techniques
without a cartridge?
The Expert's Sprite Extractor is a
good example of the positive use of
cartridges. Using this utility, sprites
can be lifted from commercial software
for examination o f  animation
routines. The animation characters
can then be saved to tape or disk. Using
the new Sprite Editor program these
characters can be reloaded and altered
to create new characters.
The sprite program gives full
facilities to view up to eight animation
sprites but allows the creation of over
240 in all. The sprites can be animated
to check fo r  glitches, viewed i n
multicolour o r  hi-res, enlarged,
ﬂipped, ﬂopped a n d  generally
manipulated into the required shapes.
This is a boon to programmers who
want to learn animation, few books
or magazines can teach the principles
in a more graphic form.
Cartridges may be potentially
harmful but what is the alternative for
serious programmers?
Round Up
For sheer adaptability and ﬂexibility,
The Expert is the best possible buy.
For convenience i t doesn't score so
well, the program is stored in a volatile
RAM chip and disappears if power is
disrupted for too long. The RAM is
dynamic and will hold the program if
the computer is switched off and on
quickly, however.
Every time the cartridge is used the
operation system has to be booted up
and this is the price that must be paid
for cheap upgradibility (well, this and
0.50 for the new disk!)
The addition of the Rocket system
has improved The Expert to a point
where it can considered to have no
equal. Some cartridges may have the
edge here and there, but who really
cares if one system loads a mere second
or two faster than another? What is
important i s the overall beneﬁts
offered and in this department The
Expert cannot be beaten.

The Disk
If you think that one of our programs looks very interesting, but you can't
afford the time to type it in then our software service will help you out
t's three o'clock in the morning. You sit at the computer
/
keyboard having just ﬁnished a marathon typing session
entering one of the superb programs from Your Commodore,
Your lingers reach for the keyboard and press the letters R.
U and N. You press R Ell IRN, sit back and nothing happens.
Everyone has probably faced this problem. When it does
happen it's a matter of spending hours searching through
the program for any typing mistakes. No matter how long
You look or how many people help you, you can usually
guarantee that at least one little hug slips through unnoticed.
The Your Commodore Software Service makes available
all of the programs from each issue on both cassette and disk
at a price of 0.00 for disk and l.:4.00 for cassette. None of the
documentation f o r  the programs is  supplied with the
software since it is all available in the relevant magazine.
Should you not have the magazine then back issues are
available from the following address:
INFON ET LTD. 5 River Park Estate, Berkhamsted. Herts
HP4 l i f t .
Tel: (04427) 76661
Please contact this address for prices and availability.
Programs on the disk will also be supplied as totally working
versions. i.e. when possible we will not use Basic Loaders
thus m a k in g  us e o f  t h e  programs  m u c h  easier.
Unfortunately at the moment we cannot duplicate C16 and
Plus/4 cassettes. However programs for these machines will
be available on the disk.
What programs are available'?
At the top of each article you will ﬁnd a strap containing
the article type. C64 Program etc. So that you Ca n see which
programs are available on which format, you will also ﬁnd a
couple of symbols after this strap. The symbols have the
following meaning:

GAME REVIEW
I
a horizontal scrolling playing area and you will have
some idea of what links is all about. Needless to say
though, the software industry prefers dressing mutton up
as lamb and there is the usual inane scenario.
You have to guide your scout craft across the surface
Of the planet Atavi i n what is described as a  unique
exploratory research mission. The planet is beautiful yet
remains an enigma. I'm not surprised seeing that it still
resembles a cross between a pinball machine and a breakout
game.
links has been released simultaneously on both the CM
and the Amiga and so both formats can usefully be
compared.
The object is to guide your probe around the planet
using your spaceglider. Translated, this means hit the ball
with your bat. Points are awarded for hitting bricks; sorry
objects that happen to be lying around. As well, there are
special objects such as mini worlds that when hit, can help
your cause by adding extra lives, restoring your bat size,
etc.
The bat is straight on one side and angled on the other.
Flipping between these two options allows you to control
the path of the ball. In practice, the ball tends to disappear
off screen and you spend large chunks of the game chasing
after it. This is by far the worst implemented part of the
game. One of the hazards that needs to be avoided is letting
your ball fall through a hole in the ground. Frequently,
I found that I was getting 'game over' messages with the
ball nowhere in sight because I couldn't move the bat quickly
enough to catch up. This is especially true on the CM version
which is rendered largely unplayable.
As you move along the playing area, you have to avoid
touching any of the moving objects. The ﬁrst touch reduces
your bat to half its usual size. The second touch kills you.
Bat size can be restored by guiding the ball onto the
appropriate object.
There are four different screens to try your luck on.
Guiding your ball onto a rotating ball, special objects, take
you onto a 'bonus screen' although no bonus is given to
your score. From here, you can select any of the other
screens to visit by guiding your ball into the appropriate
slot, Return visits to previously encountered screens results
in more moving objects to avoid and more holes to fall
through. There are effectively nine different skill levels as
you can alter the speed of the ball and the effects of gravity
upon it.
Graphics look quite slick on the Amiga although each
screen takes an age to load in. Conversely, on the CM,
all the screens are in memory at the same time but they
look fairly rough.
Despite what I have said, the idea behind links is quite
a good one and given more thought in the gameplay, it
could have been a good game. As it stands, the Amiga
version i s average while the C64 version i s quite
dreadful.

ollowing the ﬁrst three articles
in this series we are now at the
stage in which a relative ﬁle has
been set up and records entered into
it. These can be displayed in a browse
mode, amended and even printed out.
At the moment, however, they are
sorted i n  any order, appearing as
they've been written into the ﬁle.
The ﬁrst record you entered will
be record number I, the last entered
record is the last to appear on the
screen. Obviously, a ﬁle such as this
has only limited use, so we must decide
on a keyﬁeld routine, and then a sort
which will show the records in order
according to the keyﬁeld.
The ﬁrst routine we need is one
which will declare the keyﬁeld for the
ﬁle. You have the option of making
this permanent, but I have always pro-
grammed so that the keyﬁeld may be
changed so that the records can be
sorted in any ﬁeld. First of all the user
has to be able to change the keyﬁeld,
and to do that it would be a good idea
if we displayed the ﬁeld details for him
to look at while he decides.

So far we have the number o f the
desired ﬁeld to be keyed in the variable
kJ'. One advantage of doing it this
way is that just after a ﬁle has been
set up and before this routine has been
run for the ﬁrst time, KF will be 0,
which happens to be the number of
the ﬁrst ﬁeld.
Among all the other statements at
the beginning o f the program, you
might like to create a graphic image
of the KEY, with two left-graphic R
and a 0, like this:
I Okﬂ[cRl[cR]
I chose the 0 for the graphic instead
of the right-graphic on the W  key
because this graphic symbol does not
work in lower case: you get a W instead
of the round symbol. You might like
to show the graphic symbol in the
request for the keyﬁeld number:
440 next a:print:print "Which FIELD
to ":kfS
Now we have set up the keyﬁeld
variable, it is used inside the ﬁeld array
of the current ﬁle, then by storing the
keyﬁeld string from each record into
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988

-
an array to be sorted. We will call the
sorting string array RSRTSO. Since
this will be an array, it will have to
be DIMensioned in the beginning of
the program much like all the others
we have already dealt with.
Dynamic Arrays
A word o f  warning -  you cannot
DIMension this or the other sort array
which we will come to in a moment,
using a real number. If we did so, you
would only have to write a new record
over that number and you would get
a syntax error. For this reason, you
must use a dynamic array because you
cannot tell for each program ﬁle how
many records you might be going to
use, hence the variable number for the
DIM. Which variable you use in the
dynamic array depends on you.
If you program to halt the run at
the 49th new record created, resave the
housekeeping, CLR and then re-run
the program; you would be able to use
the RN variable inside the DIM:
[
Or, simpler but setting aside much
unused variable space, is to use the
very maximum number of records that
can be written, the AVAIL variables:
dim rsrtS(avail)
after which every possible record you
might e n te r h a s already been

DIMensioned for. You would never
get the dreaded 'Bad Subscript Error'
message with that, but you might have
100 records in the ﬁle and have the
arrays DI Mensioned for 40001
The method I use is to POKE all
the variables to a free page of RAM,
starting at DEC 4864. Everything, ﬁeld
names, lengths, RN and all the other
variables not yet mentioned are
POKEd there. When RN has increased
by 49 from when the program was last
RUN, the program executes a CLR
and then peeks all the location in
memory to get the variables back. The
arrays are then re-DIMensioned. The
housekeeping is then saved as a
BSAVE to disk for the next time the
ﬁle is accessed in a program RUN.
With this method it is not possible
to exceed the DIMensioned numbers
in the arrays, but neither is it necessary
to set aside huge amounts of variable
memory when i t is not required.
However, I digress slightly.
You must have DIM'd the array
RSRTS and RSRT%, either with
AVAIL or R N+50 or WO. Now we will
write the ﬁrst of the sort routine. We
have to read the keyﬁelds of all the
records currently i n the ﬁle, (and
deleted ones) into the string array
RSRTS, then sort them into alpha-
numeric order, ending up with the
actual record numbers stored in the
array RSRT%.
Why the %? Well, in case you have
not used integer arrays before, they
save much space on the disk when they
are stored. An  ordinary number is
stored to several decimal places, which
is wasteful of space, but an integar is
all we need for this application (since
there is never a need to read record
number 4.667)!
Let us begin the routine. You must
have opened the ﬁle. The screen is
cleared, and the message placed to
inform the user what is happening. I
have also programmed a display of the
record number which i s  being
processed s o  th a t th e  user has
something to watch. Time seems to
pass more quickly while you watch a
number change!
4360 rem * * * *  So rt RECORDs
routine ******
4370 print(elearscreen): p r i n t
"RECORD Processing Now"
The loop, I to the current record
number used plus, most important, the
variable storing the number of records
currently deleted is added to it, DREC
PROGRAMMING
OLD
and then the cursor is H OMEd
(without clear) to  show the record
being processed, which of course, since
PO is the loop name, is PO.
4380 forpo•
printpo
Then the record to be read variable
is declared as PO: BASIC 2, you have
your own, don't forget:
4390 rrec=po:drec=0: gosub 4130:rem
****drec is delete rn
4390 (BASIC 2 users) rp=po: gosub
4114: gosub 4130
Although we haven't seen this yet, the
following line will be explained i n
greater detail later. Basically, the loop
will detect records deleted, and will
ﬁnd the set character, C H M  (255).
Since this will mean nothing to the sort
routine, we declare the sort string for
this record as the lowest possible value,
a String of
4400 i f  diskS= chrS(255) th e n
drec=drec+1: r o u t %  (drec).po:
rsrtS(po)z: "ZZZZZZZZZZZZ": goto
4420
R OU T() is the array which stores the
deleted record numbers for future use.
They are stored at the time of deletion,
but i f this is a new sort, the sorted
record numbers change, and you
would end u p  overwriting good
records if this array was not updated!
Now we can look inside the DISKS.
Notice there is no gosub to the ﬁeld
string routine. What for? That would
merely slow things down. Instead,
M IDS and the ﬁeld pointers array with
the length of the ﬁeld array, FIELD()
is used to pick out the ﬁeld to sort,
KF. Then, because this ﬁeld might be
50 characters long. LEFTS is used to
take the left 12 characters to sort. The
loop is then ended. You may use more
characters i f you wish by increasing
this number inside the LEFTS.
4410 rsrtS(po)=IeftS (midS(diskS, fpoi
(k1),
FIELD (kf)),12)
4420 nextpo
At the end of this loop, the entire ﬁeld
has been scanned, the relevent ﬁeld has
been stored in the array RSRTS and
we are ready to Sort.

Yes, don't panic. You should have
realised that this routine would not
work for you. You require a separate
read routine. You will remember that
your read record routine reads the
record inside a loop, and ends with
the record neatly inside the array
DIST'S°. This routine could be used,
except that it is a waste of time reading
the entire record when you only need
to look at the single ﬁeld. So if you
have used the ﬁeld separated method,
you may take advantage of the fact
that you can only read one ﬁeld at
a time. Fo r  this application this
method has an advantage. Make these
changes to the above:
4390 drec=0:rem **** D O NOT use
the Read Routine. 4130
4390 (BASIC 2 users) r p
4114
4392 RECORD # 5, (po), (fpoi(kI):
gosub 3610
4394 RECORD 5 ,  (po), apoi(kf):

BASIC2 users:
4392 print #5, "p"+chr$ (101)+chr
$(1o)+chr5(hi)
+chrS (fpoi (kf):gosub 3610
4394 print #15, "p"4•chr$ (10 I)+chr
$(1o)+chrS( hi) + c h r S  ( fp o i ( k f) :
gosub3610
Then read the keyﬁeld into the sort
string array RSRTS(), no need to use
DISPS.
I
And you have achieved the same
result: the keyﬁeld of every record in
the ﬁle is stored in the string array
RSRTS. The RSRTS fo r records
which have been deleted are stored as
a string of Z characters, making sure
that they will be right at the end of
the sorted array.
You may like at this stage to store
the keyﬁeld string array into another
sequential ﬁle, to which new records
as they are entered into the ﬁle may
be added. This saves scanning the ﬁle
every time the ﬁle is sorted, but you
might not wish to do this. Close the
relative ﬁle, and use this routine to
store the sorted string array:
4430 n3S=left$ (nameS+• keydata+
16): dopen 3 ,  " p "  + (n35), dO, u8,
w: gosub3610
4400 fo rp o
rsrtS(po): nextpo

1 4450 Dclose 
I
 you typed them in. They look like this:
Now, because this routine will be used
for sorting records without scanning
the ﬁle, the next line skips the INPUT
of the sort string array. I shall come
to that later.
4460 goto4510:rem **** skip read ﬁle
Now we go into the sort routine. This
is the only routine which is not my
own. It is based on a routine called
'PetSort' which is public domain and
written by Nick Marcopoulos. In fact
the original needed some working on,
since i t  suggested that the record
number to the sort string and then
stripping off the record numbers after
the sort was ﬁnished, then reading the
sorted array into another array for the
sort result.
This was all quite cumbersome and
actually unnecessary, since the effect
of the sort is to shift the pointers in
the array RSRT% and does not move
the actual data contained in the strings
at all.
I removed the need of any second
array, which when you might have
4000 records is a  terrible waste o f
variable space, and the routine works
very well for this application. Double
check that you have typed i t  i n
correctly or the routine will simply not
work at all.
4510 print(cirscreen) "Sorting now...
Please Wait."
4520 n=rn+ drec:rem D R E C  will
be explained later
4530 fori=lton:rsrtok(i)=i:next
4540 w=n/ 2.61=5: ifn=0 then return
4550 ifw > thenk=17:ifw >  17 thenk
=59: i fw  > 59 then k=199: i fw  >199
t henk=673
4560 k=int ((k+1/ 3.38): form=Otok-I
4570 fori=m+k to n step k:w=rsrt%(i):
for j=i-k to m step-k
4580 if rsrtS(rsrt%(j)) > rsrtS(w) then
rsrt% (j+k)=rsrt%(j) (j):next
4590 rsrt%(j+k)=w:nexti:next:ifk I
then 4560
4600 return
Now the records are sorted, but the
effect will not be apparent until you
have changed the lines which request
the records read routine. At present
they are simply reading the record
number o f the ﬁle, not the sorted
record number. In case you ﬁnd this
difﬁcult to grasp, let me explain this
further. Your records are presently on
the disk, ﬁled in the order in which
PROGRAMMING
023:3
RECORD
1( 
)
 2 (  
)
 3 (  
)
 4 (  
)
5( 
)
 and so on. But the data they
contain might be:
I( 5 )  2( 2 )  3( 1 )  4( 3 )  5( 4 )  and
so On.
At present when you request record
number three in the ﬁle, you always
see the actual record three. Now we
have sorted them we have the sorted
order in an array: the array for the
above RECORDs would be:
RSRT% ( R E C OR D  R EQU ES-
TED)=ACTUAL RECORD
RSRT% (1)=3
R S RT% (2)=2
RS RT% (3)=4
RSRT% (4)=5
RSRT% (5)=1
You must remember that any array is
really a  label: when you request a
number inside the brackets of an array
you are asking for the label o f a
particular package, which is something
completely different. A browse of the
ﬁle shown above, using the sorted
record array RSRI%() would look at
record number three ﬁrst, then record
two next, then record four, and so on.
You will be unaware of this because
you will see record number 1 on the
screen while the ﬁle record, that
actually read, will be three. If you want
to see the ﬁle record number you are
actually accessing, you should add this
to the screen display routine:
4300 print"Sorted RECORD No:
";disp;" of":
;rn;"Virtual"; rsrt%(disp)
In the new part of the line, we have
used the sorted array RSRT% in
reverse to  get the virtual, the ﬁle,
record number.
Now the effect on the ﬁle has been
to arrange the records for display in
alphanumerical order. But why did we
want the deleted records to store a
"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZ" as the RSRTS?
Simple. The loop included not only
current record numbers, b u t also
deleted records. We shall go into more
detail in the next article but if you have
declared a loop, FOR P0=1 TO 5+2,
then PO Loops 7 times. But i f you
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
68
read back a string created inside that
loop using just 5; FOR P0=1 TO 5
then the loop will only read the ﬁrst
5. N o w  t h e  stri n g  containing
"ZZZZZZZZ" will have been sorted
to the end of the array and will not
be displayed because they are outside
the RN range.
Now you must go through your
routines carefully, and change every
request for a File Read or Write.
WREC=RN or WREC=DISP
to
WREC=RSRT% ( R N )  o
r
WREC=RSRT% (DISP)
and of course, for the BASIC 2 users,
to
RP=IISRT%(RN) 
o
r
RP=RSRT%(DISP)
before gosub to the record pointers
routine. To help you, here is a list of
the relevant line numbers. Basic 2
users, you declare RP as the relevant
RSRT%() before you branch to the
record pointers routine.
In the enter records routine, the
write record reads the record number
as RN, which is correct. But because
this record is a new one the sorted
array, R S R T )  does not exist for this
record. Since the enter records routine
adds new records to the end of the
ﬁle until the next sort, the new record
sorted number will be the end record
number, which here is RN. Thus we
add:
RSRT%(RN)=RN
to the Line 2580:
2580 wrec=rn:rsrt%(rn)=rn
Now we add the RSRT% to the browse
record routine so that the record
accessed is the sorted record.
2740 rrec=rsrt%(disp): rem **** get
RECORD number
We amend the edit record routine,
otherwise we will be amending the
wrong record!
3000 wrec=rsrt%((disp)): gosub 4070
Then the lines in the copy routine:
3140 rn=rn+1: wrec=rn: rsrt% (rn)=rn
3170 disp=rn:rrec=rsrt% (rn): ﬁn=ﬁn+1
And i f you wish, vou may show the
virtual record number in the hardcopy
routine from the browse menu:

3210 print # 4, "RECORD Number
"tdisp;" of ";rn;"
Virtual: ": rsrt%(disp)
Finally, now that you have a
keyﬁeld you might like to display on
the screen and on the hardcopy of the
ﬁle which ﬁeld i s the key. The
following lines and changes will do
that for you.
3230 i f k f = a  th e n p r i n t # 4,kf$;
:elseprint # 4,
4310 print:print:for amOtoc: ifa=kf then
printtab (3); MS; :elseprint" ";
Now we have to amend the house-
keeping ﬁle. We need to add a short
routine to store and read back the
sorted record numbers, as well as the
new program control variables. There
are more of those to come yet. Here
are the complete routines. BASIC 2,
I am sure it is not necessary for me
to write them for you as well. Just add
the new line numbers, the open state-
ments are the same.

Searching on the Keyﬁeld
Now you have gone to all this trouble
to sort the records, you may take
advantage o f it. After the sort, the
records appear on the screen, in alpha-
numeric order as you browse, one after
PROGRAMMING 111
another through the ﬁle. This is all very
well, but if you have 4000 records, it
would take a lot of browsing to ﬁnd
the particular entry you need.
Of course, you could use the goto
option on the browse menu, but
locating the individual record would
still take some time. What we need is
a search on the keyﬁeld. This is the
search routine I promised in a previous
article, which will ﬁnd any entry in
the keyﬁeld in 9 or less reads from
1000 records1
How does it work? It is actually
quite simple. Imagine you had a card
ﬁle o f names in alphabetical order.
There is no marking in the card ﬁle
showing where each letter begins or
ends; how would you look for one
name in that ﬁle?
You would look at a card about
the middle of the cardﬁle, and compare
the name there with the name you are
looking for. If the name is 'less than'
or a  lower alphabetical name, you
would look in the previous half of the
ﬁle for another sample. If the card you
selected was higher, you would look
in the next half of the ﬁle. When you
get close to it, you would look at indi-
vidual cards until you found the name
you were looking for or you knew it
was not present.
Keyﬁeld Search
Do not forget, you must have opened
the relative ﬁle for accessing. BASIC
2 users, you must have opened the
Error Channel 15.
First, the once extra read counter,
the NUdge counter is set to O. This
will be explained in a moment. The
request string is inputed into n$.
3030 nu=0:yy=0
3040 print"Enter Search Data:"
3050 input n$
3060 bn=rn/2:bin=bn
1
Now we come to the processing. BN
is the beginning number which is the
nuber of records divided by 2, in other
words, the routine ﬁnd the middle of
the ﬁle. The BIN  variable is the
number which will be processed from
now on.
The record number is assigned into
RREC. Note the RS RT%() array ﬁnd
the sorted record number. This is
important.
3070 rrec=rsrt%(int(bin))
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988
69
1
BASIC 2:
3070 rp=rsra(int(bin)):gosub 4114
Then the record i s  read. Field
separated method users w o u l d
probably be as well to copy the single
ﬁeld read method I used in the third
article for the sorted keyﬁeld string
RSRT$: o r  t o  write their o w n
subroutine.
3075 RECORD ft 5, (rrec), (fpoi(k0):
gosub 3610
3077 RECORD # 5, (rrec), (fpoi(k0):
gosub 3610
3080 input # 5, (disp$(1(0): gosub 3610
Using the i nstr function the
keyﬁeld string is searched fo r the
request string. If the match is found
then the RREC is declared as the
number for reading and the display
number is quoted fo r the display
record routine. (Otherwise there will
be blanks on the RECORD screen.)
The counter to show a positive search
result, YY, is set to I, and then the
routine branches back to the display
part of the browse routine so that the
matched record is displayed.
3080 gosub 4120: gosub 4180:iﬁnstr
(dispS(kf),n$)
>Othen rrec=rsrt% (int(bin)):disp=int
(bin): yy=1: goto 2750
But the record read might not provide
a match. I n  that case the routine
continues into 3090, where the BN
variable is again halved, having the
effect of quartering the ﬁle. A quick
check is made in case the BN variable
has been halved to less than I. If it
has then the nudge variable is set to
one for one last try. This is because
some ﬁles will have many records with
very similar keyﬁelds, taking a dis-
proportionate number of entries in a
particular part of the ﬁle. The nudge
allows one more read.
3090 b n =b n / 2:iﬁnt(bn) <1 t h e n
nu=nu+I:bn =I
lithe nudge variable has already been
set to  one, then the routine ends,
displays the 'ﬁle not found' message.
and returns to the browse with the
record number changed to the nearest
record found to the match request.
This is useful to move the ﬁle display
to a particular part of the ﬁle even
when you know the requested string
will not be found.

3100 i f Os >1 then print "File Not
Found:" :sleep 2
:rree=rsrt% (int(bin)): disp=int (bin):
goto 2750
Now we do the comparisons: i f the
requested search string, NS is 'greater
than' i.e. a higher alphanumeric value,
then the keyﬁeld string just read, then
the halved processing number BN is
added to the BIN number to give the
next record number to inspect, and the
routine branches back to  the next
record read.
Likewise, if the value of the string
read is 'less than' the string requested
then th e  halved number B N  i s
deducted from the BIN number. In this
way the ﬁle is repeatedly halved until
the record is found o r the nudged
variable is greater than 1, showing that
the record is not present in the ﬁle.
3110 i f n S  >  dispS(kf) t h e n
bin=bin+bn:goto 3070
3120 ifnS <  dispS(kf) then bin=bin-

3122 sr=0: iﬁen (n$) > len (dist:4 (kI))
then return
Then the search loop is started to the
length o f the ﬁeld string minus the
length of the search string:
3124 fors=ltolen (dispS(kf))-len(nS)-1
Using MIDS, the ﬁeld string is scanned
from left to right until there is one
character less than the length of N$.
If a match is found then the loop is
closed and the SR result is set to I:
3126 ifmidS (dispS(k1), s, len (n1.)-
thens=len
(dispS(k0)-len (nS)-1: sr=1: return
After the loop has ﬁnished, DISPS has
been searched without result, so the
routine RETURNs with SR as 0:
3138 nexts:return
There is the keyﬁeld search_ In the next
article 1 will provide the routines for
deleting records, and a  sequential
search method which will ﬁnd any data
anywhere within a ﬁle.

u may have noticed that our
V
o
listings are free of those horrible little
black blobs which send you searching
around the keyboard for  a suitable
graphic symbol. You may also have
noticed the funny numbers by the side
of each line of the listing. Fret no more,
it's all part of our easy entry aid.
Instead of those nasty graphics and
rows o f  countless spaces in PRINT
statements and strings we use a special
coding s y s tem. T h e  c o d e ,  o r
mnemonic, is  always contained i n
square brackets and you'll soon learn
to decipher their meanings.
For example, I  SA] would mean
type in a Shifted AL or an ace of spades
in layman's terms, and 1 SA10] would
mean a row of (en of these symbols.
[S+2] means hold down the shift
key and press the plus key twice. It
doesn't take a great leap of  logic to
realise that [C-I-21 means exactly the
same thing except that the Commo-
dore key (bottom left of the keyboard)
is held down instead of the shift key.
If more than two spaces appear in a
statement then this will be printed as
[SPC41 o r ,  exceptionally, [SSPC41.
Translated into English this means
press the spacebar four times or in the
latter case hold the shift key down
while you do it.
A string of special characters could
appear as:
[CTRL N ,  D O WN  2,LEFT5,BLUE,
1
This would be achieved by holding

for the C64.
down the CTRL key as you press N,
press the cursor key down twice, the
cursor left key ﬁve times, press the key
marked BLUE while holding down the
CTRL key, press the F 3 key and,
ﬁnally hold the Commodore key down
while pressing the number two key (C2
would of  course make the computer
print in brown).
Always remember that you should
only have a row of graphics characters
on your screen with no square brackets
and no commas, unless something like
this appears:
[SS],[0
In this case the two characters should
have a comma between them.
On rare occasions [REV T ] will
appear in a listing. This is a delete
symbol and is created by entering the
line up to this mnemonic. Then type a
closing quotation mark (SHIFT & 2)
and delete it. This gets the computer
out of quotes mode. Hold down CTRL
and press t h e  number  nine k ey
(RVSON), type the relevant number of
reversed T s  and then hold down
CTRL and press zero (RVSOFF).
Next type another quotation mark and
delete it again. Now ﬁnish the line and
press RETURN.
A list of these special cases is given
in the table but remember that only
one of  these mnemonics will appear
outside of a PRINT string: the symbol
for pi. This may appear when its value
is needed in a calculation so this may
look something like:
YOUR COMMODORE august 1988

:er=2*[PI]*R:
Ignore the square brackets and just
type i n  a  shifted upward pointing
arrow (ie. the pi symbol).

"Yes, it's the very latest, the industry compatible Multi-font
LC-10 from Star, there are features included as standard not
found on printers sometimes twice the price...
"Well, there's the Star front control panel so you don't have to
ﬁddle with DIP switches -
a built-in push tractor
for low form tear-off.
And you don't even
have to take the tractor
paper out to autoload single
sheetswith the LC-10's paper
parking. There's a large 4K
buffer - it's even got six NLQ fonts
as standard. It prints at a realistic
120 cps and has a really fast NLQ
