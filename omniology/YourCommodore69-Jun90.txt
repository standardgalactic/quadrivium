A What's small, furry, cute and goes splat if run over by a juggernaut?
Wrong, Adrian's not small!
Audlogenic has signed something that has
absolutely nothing to do with Emlyn Hughes.
Lone Wolf or scandalous foory managers.
Yea., its signed its ﬁrst arcade license.
Exterminator is rhe incredibly surreal
arcade machine reported about in our Neon
Zone column some months ago. Surreal for
the fact rhat you ore a bug exterminator
who must literally squash the population of
bugs that have taken over a quiet family-
like neighbourhood (a neighbourhood
much like your very own).
Expect it to appear on your Commy
64 sometime in the Autumn (probably).
A IMPOSSAMOLE - the game that puts hair on your

Guess what I'VE read. Don't know? I've got my hands on a copy of the ﬁlm
script for Robocop II written by comic supremo Frank Miller. and I can
exclusively reveal that the Ocean game (currently being programmed) is
going to be one violent motha. mainly because the ﬁlm features even
MORE violence/action than the prequel.
It features nor one but two robocops. and the second one (le, NOT
Murphy). has ro be seen to be believed. There are some wicked ﬁtght
sequences that Ocean II be lapping up.

as could be. rum, rum,
turn, turn, I've lost my
sanity! Hove we got a
sionkingly good issue for you! Have
we?
Yeeehhhh! Course we hove!
And would I lie to you? Not only
have we got the best game re-
views that a C64 mag could ever
have, but there's o pull-our supple-
ment in the middle of the mag that
offers you a COMPLETE guide to
football and your computer (with
the World Cup just round the corner,
what better time to do it?).
Of course. the rest of the mog is
so stuffy you could stick it in the
ground and wave a ﬂog from it.
With Ashley now performing the
honours on the games front nigh on
solely, you con be guaranteed that
every piece of software is a new os
0 fresh egg.
There is also a new regular
column for those of you with a bit
of 'get up and go'.. ond a fondness
of rubber. called (unsurprisingly)
'Point and Rubber' and features
reviews of live roleplay and
Paintball games. plus details how
you can participate yourself.
And there's yet another poster.
plus a few games and a demo on
the cassette, not bad for E1.95 eh?
Just one thing. I would like to
thank the following very much,
without whom this issue would hove
been very drab indeed (Just like
our competitors): Arsenal Football
Club for the use of their ground for
an hour. Olympus Sports for the
loan of ten quality football shirts,
and Wembley Stadium for the
trannies,
Cheers.

SHORT BUT
ABUSIVE
Oi you, rat features, I was very
angry that you didn't put Hackatak
in the March issue. I thought the
article on Graphic Sex was brilliant.
Sohaile Hassan, Wimbledon
PA. Who are you called rat
features? I hope the extra-
extended 12 inch remix last issue
more than compensoted (I've
swallowed a ﬂaming dictionary).
Even better stuff is coming up
though, read the rest of this ish to
ﬁnd out what.
DATEL DREAMS
Glad to see the magazine's getting
better, loads of reviews and all
that. plenty of tips. But!! No
adventure section. there's a lot of us
out here waiting for a good
adventure section for reviews, tips,
help, etc.
Having got all that off my chest. I
bought an Action Replay Mk VI
Cartridge from Datel Electronics via
an advertisement in YC. I had it
about a week and one morning
when I inserted the cartridge the
computer hung up with no
keyboard control. I phoned Darel's
technical deportment and they
suggested that I should clean the
motherboard on my C64.
After doing this the cartridge has
worked perfectly ever since. I
would recommend the AIR Mk VI
to anyone, especially those like me
who are a bit dubious of mail
order. Datel is good to its word and
I can't imagine how I managed
without the Mk VI as it odds another
dimension to the C64.
Even games with no pause
facility con be paused using the
screen edit function. Could you
please give my thanks to the
gentlemen at Datel who answered
my query for their excellent service.
Ifs nice to say something good
about a ﬁrm instead of
complaining about shoddy goods,
bad service. etc. Thank you
Lee Murdie, Northumberland
PA: It's good to see somebody
other than the YC lads that
appreciates a good service when
they see one. The Datel gents work
hard, and they deserve any praise
which is aimed in their direction.
We do hove on adventure
column, it's not quite as regular as
yo might wish for though.
NO WORRIES
I recently bought my ﬁrst issue of YC
(the March edition). due to the fact
that my favourite ever mag. CU.
has now become totally Amiga.
The only problem I have with your
mog is that it doesn't have enough
colour. I also have these questions:
1. Will you ever cover the Amiga (I

certainly hope nor)?
2. Who the hell does Rik Henderson
think he is?
3. Are you going to have a comic
strip?
4. Are you on drugs?
Paul MuHard, Northampton
PA: 1. Nope, never, not on your
nelly, would we lie to you guy! 2.
The Archbishop of Stratford-Upon-
Bognor! 3_ Several mate, One of
which is already around! 4. Nope,
but I'm rather partial to Jelly Tots!
GASP!!!
Yo Posty!
What on ultra cool mog you've
got. I goes down to my local
newsogents and I see a strange
looking magazine with a tape on
the front. Wow._ What is this? So I
decides to buy it and, well, I am
completely blown away by the
whole shabang. Not only is it solely
64, but it also has all the main
features of other leading
magazines.
After reading every possible
word in YC the ﬁrst I think is, hold it!
This has o lot of potential, I give YC
3 months to become one of the
best magazines ovoilable. All I con
say is, CU, Zzap and C-4-VG, watch
it, there's o new mag in town, it's
called Robo-YC_
Anyway. after all this heeavy
grovelling, I ask you one meagre
favour, ond that is for my letter to
be printed so that my name will be
immortalised into the pages of the
magazine of the future.
Mark Smith, Nabal, South Africa
PS. I hope you can acknowledge
my suggestions:
1) More colour (or colour on the
major reviews and features)
2) Adventure helpline like other
mays.
3) Larger Hockatak and Neon
Zone.
4) Compos for us overseas readers
(I get your magazines one month
lore).
5) High quality games on tape.
And 6) Not to introduce Amiga
games or anything else, because
there is for too much coverage for
that overgrown microchip.
And, 7) Up-to-date charts so we
can see 'what's where'!

PPS. YC rules, deﬁnitely!
PPPS. Give yourselves a slap on the
back and give me more stuff for
my money.
PPPPS Boy, hove you guys made
my day or what?
PA: Mark, consider your meagre
favour to be granted, grovelling
gets you everywhere.
GIBBER, GIBBER,
BLAAAH!
For o number of years I_ have been
buying YC as and when it was
available in the bookshops.
During this period your magazine
improved so much rhot last
October, with rhe introduction of
series on the -1-4 computer, I would
hove put YC at the top of the
computer magazine soles list. With
these thoughts in mind I decided to
take out a regular subscription and
consequently sent off my cheque
for twelve months subs.
After two telephone calls to your
distribution ofﬁce, at my expense. I
ﬁnally received the 1st edition a
few days ago.
At this point words fail me. I can
only assume that the editor of YC
has gone completely raving mod
or maybe he is suffering from some
kind of senile decay, because the
drivel contained within the covers of
YC cannot be the product of the
same mind that turned our such
brilliant stuff two months ago!
Please do not, repeat not. send
any more editions to my address.
Regards the balance of my
subscription, you can use it to
obtain medical help for the editor.
H. Dunn, Warrington
PA: Consider it dunn, Rik's been in
need of some serious help for
years. Once his brain is straight
though. I think you'd better watch
thot he doesn't tell you where to
stick your money.
On dot highly abusive note I
reckon I'd better sign off (I may be
hard, but Rik is carbon) and I'll
leave you wiv this joke. What do
you call a rabbit that tries to cross
the M25 with a hot and socks on?
Dead!

In rhe ﬁrsr of his regular
reporrs from countries afar,
Paul Rigby speaks to Karl
Buiter, programmer of
Sentinel Worlds 1.
M
you receive? This is the
transport barge New Moon'
out of Norjaenn town, We
hove been attacked (...) like
nothing we've ever seen (...) out of
nowhere (...) losing fuel, hurry
Caldoore we're sitting ducks out
here. Mayday. Mayday (...) Oh No
- Oh my God. They're coming
bock: (end of transmission).
Karl Buiter has a fascination for
space. His ﬁrst commercial release,
EOS (Earth Orbit Station) was never
seen over here. although it was
released for the C64. The game
followed NASA's plans for the next
50 years of space exploration. His
inspiration for EOS, and ultimately
Sentinel Worlds, was the ﬁlm 2001:
A Space Odyssey. Now I don't
know about you„ but this ﬁlm foxed
me sideways. Karl understood it,
(I'll have to ask to tell me what it's
about. sometime) and it became,
along with movies ,like the Star
Wars Trilogy: the catalyst for a
career in games programming. As
Karl says himself'
"It's something that I'm starting
to specialise in. Being involved in
one topic you become expert in it.
Naturally you become involved in
the next project in the same area
as it's easier to make that jump.'
The actual idea for Sentinel
Worlds (from which the leading
paragraph comes from), came
from a book Karl was writing at the
time. The plot was re-used for the
design of a table-top RPG. So after
E05 was ﬁnished it proved
tempting for Karl to utilise the story
for the basis of Sentinel Worlds. The
plot wos highly modiﬁed. mind
you, as many additions and
changes were made while basic
ideas such as place names and
characters were kept.
"The intent of Sentinel Worlds
was to follow the concept of the re-
discovery of magic".
This merging of the D&D and
the science ﬁction world is an
intriguing concept but scattered
with many pitfalls that Karl has,
largely managed to avoid with
great aplomb. When Sentinel
Worlds appeared there were
scattered comments about the
underlying similarity between it and
Electronic Arr's Stafﬂight,
"I think there's some natural
similarities. But it's almost like
comparing two Dungeon and
Dragon-type games. There's
obviously going to be similarities in
character development, what they
can do. etc. With regard to
combat, I took a different
approach as I went for real-time
action, a  faster dog-ﬁght type of
mode rather than a slow strategic
approach that Stafﬂight took, Other
similarities may have come from
YC 1 3

the fact that the producer of both
products was the some J o e
Yborra. Although he doesn't get a
whole lot of credit he is the
bounceboord for ideas. So it's likely
that the same philosophies will
appear. There is no conscious effort
to copy anybody, though:"
There hove always been
fantasy role-playing games. They're
everywhere! From the Stares,
Europe and the UK. Single
character, parry-based, they come
in big boxes, small boxes, cornﬂake

boxes... So was there a need for a
SF RPG to try to resurrecr some form
of balance? Maybe offer some
form of choice?

who read Asimov 0 0

effort to crecte games which star

cience ﬁction sense there isn't
always that evil antagonist, Rorner .
!here is some sort of problem which
involves technology or which • -
involves science and technology in
the plot. As on industry as a
science ﬁction ik_lcroely on un
tapped market
By 'technology' Karl megt(s that
the story involves it r0 a nigh'
degree. Not just introducing
technology by using objects but the
14 i n
and
concept that, without technology,
the story does not exist_ I think
we're talking heavy SF book-type
plots here. If thor is the case, great!
We could do with some originality
in the RPG scene. Karl wants to
increase the involvement of
characters in his future work. The
use of interaction, for example. This
would be to the detriment of
combat of course - well
something's got to go_ However
some combat will stay. As Karl says
"it's got to be a  game". There must
it I see that little girl with
be on element of action to spur the
adrenalin. However, too many
RPGs rely on combat to see the
player through the plot. This form of
game is generally the product of a
barren imagination. I've played too
rnony RPGs of this nature ond.
generally, they bore me stiff. Yes.
even killing gers boring after a
while. Another head blown off?
Yawn_ Is this the genre that Karl
wishes to distance himself from.
Returning to Sentinel Worlds, for
a sec., I was most impressed with
the game. However, no game is
perfect, so now was the rime to get
all of those pent-up troubles off my
hest. Who better to discuss them
with than the author. One of the
•chtt'acter attributes, in Sentinel
Worlds, iSchatisma. My query was,
" l e s  it doNonything?" -  it didn't
se ,m to matter if this attribute was
high or low. A bug or an unused
section of, he game or what?
"Its ve subtle. It extends the
length of co0Vetsation that you
may have witheach individual_ It's
sorri' hing which•'s hard to onalyse
thhigh direct tests. So a low
charisma would produce a shorter
conversatIon. Port of the fault may
be that the conversation trees were
11(7)1
go h o t  they wanted out of the
conversation real early on so
Charisma didn'7 play a port.'
Another nagging trouble I had
was with some of the outdoor
sequences, journeying in the ATV.
for example. I thoughuthat some of
the trips were a littleOlf long and
tedious: A similar draWbock
appeared when you were on a
planet and you tried to lead your
team through corridors. •ond so on. I
found it time consuming
manoeuvring each character
around obstacles.
'At the time I thought it was
somewhat important. I was loolsino
at it from a designer, instead of a
player, point of view. Thar
everything -as to be in scale.
Planets have to be huge, realistic in
size. I was thinking that a RPG was
a realistic simulation of rhe

has changed guile a bit since
Sentinel Worlds.'
Right, alter that cri:icism. I did
think that the interaction "'.'as well
done. How was ir developed?
I was nor overly impressed by
the yes/no query system seen in
many games. I wonted to have
much more of c conversation
system. When you look at that you
realise that a conversation is just a
ser of possible questions and
another set of possible answers.
Once you pass through one
answer, that answer's g a t  to lead
to another set of questioris. Forming
a natural tree system, using a set of
paths which lead to another set of
paths."
One of the most enjoyable
aspects of thiOnteraction system is
the atmosphere. Development of
characters is a most important and
often overlooked feature of RPGs.
Sentinel Worlds makes ail effort to
inject some much needed
atmosphere. This atmosphere
even more essential in a scenario
which is, by default, so vast, Karl
said that his next game will have
on advonced conversation tree. In
fact, hatlescribed ir more as a
network where you con go down a
conversation path, come straight
back up agairrand so on as you

don't hove to follow a set structure.
Piracy is a big problem. as I'm
sure you know. Many companies
have a variety of "solutions' to the
dilemma. Karl. instead of
introducing a codewheel system
favoured by many other Electronic
Arts programs, decided to have a
paragraph book (also seen in
Wasteland, for example). The
theory being that the game would

more involved in what the

The main mission can be solved
without any 'reference to these sub-
missions. The overall game is by no
means linear. You can rake any
number of directions. The game is
not really any bigger than Sentinel
Worlds_ It relies more on
quality rorher than quantity."
Ah, quality. A word not often
used in the software industry.
Sentinel Worlds, while by no means
perfect, has got a high level of
quality to it as well as addictiveness

exciting prospect. The pure science
theory he proposes is very
intriguing, especially if you combine
this with a high degree of character

should see a highly original, in-
depth game. One thing's for sure
though. it'll hove a funky

WORLD CHAMPIONSHIP
BOXING MANAGER 4
Supplier: Goliath Games
Price: £9.99 (Cass) £14.99 (Disk)
ou've been a
football manager, a
hockey coach, a
pony trap driver, a deep
sea research agent, the
owner of a ﬂea circus (all
before breakfast) and
now a boxing manager,
You have the onerous task
of choosing an up and
coming boxer and turning
him into a star. This may
happen in real life - after
all. Tyson was beaten by
an unknown - but even if
it doesn't you con make it
happen on your 64.
To start with you have
to sign in. Then you are
faced with as motely
crew of hopeful
youngsters that any real
manager has ever had to
choose from. They will
want to negotiate their •
contracts on the spot
though as new hopefuls
you can probably take
advantage of them at
ﬁrst. The contract consists of
a minimum world
ranking, minimum
number of bouts and
average percentage of
purse for the following
year. This contract is
reviewed each year and
as a ﬁghter gains
experience the
negotiations will become
more and more ﬁerce.
Once you've got your
troop of merry men you
can start fulﬁlling their
contracts by setting up
some bouts. Grab the
phone and a list of other
managers will be
displayed. Each one has
ﬁve ﬁghters in his camp of
various placings in the
world. You can arrange a
ﬁght between one of his
ﬁghters and one of yours
but if the ﬁght is
mismatched he won't
agree to it. Once a
potential ﬁght has been
agreed on then a deal
over the purse has to be
bargained for. If you're
too greedy then he'll tell
you and after rhree
attempts he hangs up,
refusing to speak to you
again.
Assuming all goes well
around the negotiation
table you can start training
schedules for your boxer.
To get them to rhe peak
of rheir physical condition
every day will need to be
carefully planned. The
training methods are
punch bag, sparring, ring
work, rood work and
weight training. These all
affect a different aspect of
your boxer's abilities. A
quick trip to the physio will
give you a latest report of
your ﬁghter's strengths and
weaknesses.
r
Day by day the
running of the business is
all down to you. If the
phone rings no one else is
going to answer it. Post
won't open itself either.
There are two boards of
control for the boxing
world who have to
conﬁrm the legality of
each bout by post. As well
as the physio and trainer
there ore scouts who you
con assign to spy on
potential opponents.
Goliath sensibly opted
to use commentary
instead of a graphical
ﬁght sequence and it
works very nicely indeed.
Between rounds your
boxer's physog is
displayed sporting any
cuts and bruises he may
have picked up. You
have the responsibility for

patching him up using
your odrenalin, water
bottle, sponge and cold
iron. The commentators
give a rough estimate of
who's up on points but if
the bout goes the distance
expect to chew a few
nails whilst waiting for the
verdict.
Very compulsive,
dangerously addictive,
refreshingly different and
nicely presented.
If you like
management games and
don't like the added
hassles of handling
ﬁnances (there's none of
that here), then it's on
absolute must. Send a
copy to Tyson. He might
learn a thing or two.

violence, jelly tots,
violence. and sex, what
juicy morsel has System 3
thrown into the proverbial
bowl of fruit? A game so
cute that the bottom of
your stomach will touch
the roof of your mouth in
an effort to empty its
contents.
What is this game
about? Well sit back dear
reader and get a bucket
handy, you may well
need it.
Flimbo hod a
gorgeous girlie who cared
for his every whim, and
they skipped ond danced
merrily amongst the
butterﬂies and tulips,
singing and frolicking in
the sunlight. Unfortunately,
there was one who did
not enjoy prancing his
dainty toes around
meadows, for he was
mean and most
importantly. dying. And
being such a grouch this
fellow did kidnap poor
Flimbette and lock her
in his laboratory.
The reason behind
this dastardly deed
wos that the evil one
was wasting away
and he needed the life
juice off of a nubile
female to restore himself.
Flimbo, however, hod
other plans for his
girlfriend (probably
involving farm animals
and rubber tubing), so he
has vowed to win her
bock, no matter what the
odds.
Kept your lunch? My
word are you hard. I ber
you've been bred on a
diet of Zippy. Bungle and
Bogpuss! Anyway, as
Flimbo you must save
your sweetheart using all
your powers, even though

your head seems ro be
malformed. and this is not
going to be easy,
especially because your
head seems to be
malformed_
Now after the beat-
em-up boom the shooty
craze. and the driving
game frenzy, the latest
fashion (apart from the
obvious 'World Cup'
orientated money
grabbers) is the cute
game. And why not?
The success of games
like Bubble Bobble,
Rainbow Islands, and
Super Wonderboy
cannot be overlooked,
and seeing os these
are all coin-op
conversions, they have
been far longer in
/
development than
we can imagine.
Flimbo's Quest on
the other hand, is
totally and truly
original, and brings
a new cutesy wuresy
character into the hay.
There are ﬁve levels to
go through. each one
being a different area of
the land which you must
progress through. On each
level there is a shop,
where you con buy things
and, most importantly,
deposit a password that
allows you entry into the
next area, and the next

level. This word though
has been broken up into
individual letters, and they
are scattered around in
the shape of mutants.
Luckily you have on
ability to know what
mutant holds each letter,
so you must seorch the
level that you're on and
ﬁnd the mutant, kill it and
a scroll will appear
Collect this scroll and
deposit it back or the shop
for a lettet.
There ore also other
objects scattered around
in the shape of
mutants, and once
shot you will
ﬁnd such things
as money
bags, invincibility, and
extra lives. The money
bags can buy you
extensions to your
ﬁrepower, etc. much in
the mould of many of this
genre.
There are also extra
rooms where tonnes of
cash can be won, if you
collect it in the right order.
It is very Japanese in style,
and in this case iris good
to see that Europe con
match the best of them,
Although Flimbo's is a
platform and ladder style
of game, it hos certainly
brought this ancient
medium right up to dote.
The gaps in the walls have
parallax scrolling, and rhe
monsters ore sometimes
made up of much more
than one sprite (the slow,
cumbersome Woodlouse
kind of creature for
instance).
The graphics ore
nothing short of excellent,
and being of the cure
variety, are bright even
when the backgrounds
may be very evil indeed.
Ilimbo himself is set to
become a cult hero (like
Dizzy, Manic Minor, and
Rockford) and System 3's
ﬁrst solo release (without
the intervention of
Activision) not only
deserves, but is set to
become a classic.
Maybe when the
sequel arrives and
everybody has Flimbo's
posters on their walls you'll
get my drift It's just a
shame that hers so
sickeningly. painstakingly
cute!

5  u b  and Bob are back!!
Yes, Bubble Bobble
fans, dust off your
joysticks and prepare for
more.-marathon gaming
sessions! The good news is
that the game is just as
great. just as addictive
and just as cute as it's
predecessor. The bad
news is that Bub and Bob,
intrepid bubblers of the
prehistoric world, have
been changed from dinky
dinosaurs to chubby
cherubs. The scenario is
thin to soy the least_ It
looks as if the
programming was the
priority because there is
no real reason for the
famous due to be there
other than to face the
fresh challenge. Sounds
good to me...
In case you missed our
on the original Bubble
Bobble game,. Bub and
Bob had to take on
myriods of evil monsters
and eat as much food as
possible. It was a game of
real high scoring action,
Rainbow Islands retains
the same atmosphere of
frantic action and point
grabbing tactics. Bob and
is , B o b  had to work their way

monsters or whatever. The
1,... I i
game loads level by level
but this doesn't take very
long and you'll hardly
notice the pause.
The islands are made
up of platforms. The idea
is to reach the guardian of
the island at the top of
every fourth screen.
Whichever hero you use
A  Looks like he's got a case of cutitousl
A  Up above the trees and houses...
you'll ﬁnd that they ore
extremely easy to control.
They can run around and
jump as usual. but their
weapons hove been
changed into rainbows.
These take some getting
used to. Rainbows can be
run along and jumped off
to reach higher platforms.
They can stack on top of
one another to form
ladders. Casting a rainbow
along the ground
sometimes reveals extra
fruits to collect.
Monsters ore knocked
out by being hit with a
rainbow. These then form
fruits, jewels or powers.
Falling on top of rainbows
breaks them and sends
them tumbling down the
screen. This shower of
rainbows kills any
monsters or collects any
uneaten food for you.
Finally, rainbows can be
cast at food or objects to
collect them. There are
seven different jewels to
collect_ Grab one or more
of each and you will be
awarded a bonus life.
There is a strict rime
limit on each screen.
Hong around for too long
and the 'Hurry up'
message appears. Then
water starts rising up the
screen and the monsters
turn on angry red and
move foster. our heroes
die on contact with a
monster and they can't
swim either! Reaching the
top of the screen is
awarded with a huge
chest of goodies that falls
down to spray its contents
all over the place. These
con be collected for bonus
points.
The powers are very
useful indeed. Shoes
speed up your movement
considerably. Yellow
potion pots speed up the
casting of rainbows and
red ones add to the
number of rainbows cast
at once (up to three).

Ve,e,
[here are also super
powers that pop up from
time to time. These might
grant huge bogs of cash
for big bonus points or a
really deadly power to
destroy large amounts of
monsters_ Srars explode
when collected and the
shrapnel kills any monsters
it touches.
Fruit and veg litters
each screen. Collecting
gigantic amounts of iris
rhe way to massive scores
and more can be found
by careful use of
rainbows. The game is a
frantic race for points in
the two player mode.
Gameplay wise Rainbow
Islands is dangerously
addictive, Once you get
the hang of the subtleties
of rainbow use you'll be
absolutely hooked. The
island's guardians ore
suitably tough and a
w,orthy challenge to Bub
and Bob's rainbow casting
skills.
The game has been
beautifully designed and
programmed. Every
character, from the
monsters to the fruit is
superbly drawn and
brilliantly coloured. The
whole game bears on
uncanny resemblance to
an explosion in a jelly tot
factory. The screen scrolls
upwards very smoothly
and there are no ﬂickers,
no glitches, nothing. It's
very hard to fault a game
which is so great all round.
My advice is to buy it once
you've ﬁnished reading
this. Then get it home,
load it up and prepare to
play for hours and hours.
Oh, the sound is good
too. If you only ever buy
one game for your 64
make it Rainbow Island.

mugging is criminal and

The water has started
its journey and in a mad
dash against the ﬂow you
must lay pipes which give
you points and keep the
water moving. Placing
any connecting pipes on

place them. Forthcoming
pipes are shown in a

the column. When placing
pipes you must ensure

making that section of the

unusual features include
ending points for the ﬂow
and holes in the grid walls

of these causes it to enter
the screen via a similar
hole on the other side of
the grid).

continues (if it stops both
players lose). The winner
in the two player game is
the one with the most full
pipes when the ﬂow stops.
A useful tactic is to divert
the ﬂow away from your
fellow player's pipes arid
with any luck they won't
notice until iris too late.
A fun game with
some nice touches and
the two player mode is
likely to lead to many a
poke in the ribs. A worthy
offering, one that aims
and does please.

No, I'm not describing
the rush to the newsagents
when the new YC comes
out. I'm describing the
latest arcade conversion
from Activision. The game
has little resemblance to a
packet of jelly tots, other
than the fact the graphics
are brightly coloured.
Don't let this primary fault
in the game put you off
though, because it's
otherwise a great little
wheeze.
For starters the gome
can be played by up to
four players_ This brings rhe
spirit of competition
somewhat to the fore! To
fully utilise the four player
option you're going to
have to invest in a joystick
splitter lead, and of course
ﬁnd three other maniac
drivers with no sense of
sportsmanship. The idea is
very similar to the Super
Sprint arcade game. You
have to beat the
opposition over the ﬁnish
line any which way you
can. This needs to be
done as quickly as
possible. because you
only have a limited
amount of time but y
also have a sparse
supply as well.

bad news for the leader in
turn because the bock
arker now has
reasonable chance of
becoming the leader. On
each track there is a
shortcut. This is always a
dangerous option
because the shortcuts
generally consist of
motorways or railroads.

I ﬁghter pilot who has just
been laid off because
of old age. Who said that
life begins or forty?
Anyway, the chances are
that life as we know it will
never be the same agoin.
This is because of o jolly
nosh/ bunch of aliens who
are living under the Paciﬁc
Ocean. They're nor
content to wait for the
greenhouse effect to
drown the entire Human
Race. Oh no. they're
going to speed up the
process by making rhe
seas rise from below.
Now this is good news
for drought ridden third
world countries but bad
news for everyone eke.
That's why they've
contacted you. After all,
being down on your luck,
broke and unemployed
you're the ideal
condidate. As well as
being a damn ﬁne pilot.
So the lure of hundreds of
megabucks has convinced
you (beyond the pose of
claiming to hove saved
the world) that you should
do the job.
The very nice men or
the UN have kindly lent
you 15.000 credits to buy
equipment with. There is a
great build-your-own
underwater death
machine shop ro spend it
all in. This appears or the
beginning of each level
and the points which you
hove accumulated can be
spent as credits. There ore
four different ships. These
cost between three and
seven thousand credits
and differ in design and
the amount of extra bits
you can odd to them.
These extra bits are
very varied and quite
interesting. There are
three rypes of cannon,
ond three formations of
each: four types of missile:
four special powers;
unintelligent drones: and
eight rypes of modules.
The drones act like
bulldozers, ﬂying in
straight lines and blasting
away. The modules ﬂy in
set patterns, little circles
and lines and destroy
anything that hits them.
The powers ore smart
bomb. ﬂamethrower,
lightning bolt and claw
arm.
All of rhese extra
features odd greatly to
the game's appeal and
lasting interest. There is
plenty of action in the
game proper, with loads
of ﬂying and static hazards
-o blast into little bits of

level there lurks a power

above all others. These
guardians will do their
utmost ro stop the deadly
ﬂow from your guns.
The game is
technically superb. with
terriﬁc sound and great
graphics. Although rhey
ore quite dull-looking.
and the missiles ore jerky,
the scrolling of the screens
and the general
movement is very nice.
Although I tend to avoid
comparisons with Amiga
versions, this is very true to
iris elder brother and
retains almost identical
playobiliry.
Shoot em up fans will
love this game. Its the
best ever bloster on the
64 and very good value
for money. Amazingly
addictive and extremely
playable. Get it. seal
yourself into your
bedroom, draw the
curtains and blast off.

trend of cute games
comes Logotron's
Cloud Kingdoms. As well
as being similar to several

also extremely addictive
and highly playable. You

however he rolls, bounds
and bounces around each
of the sixteen playing
areas. These kingdoms all
have a different theme,
like Ice Kingdom or Flying
Kingdom. Each one is
deviously constructed to
cause you as many
problems as possible. The
basic idea of each level is
the same: to snap up
every little diamond.
power and fruit before the
rime runs our. At the start
of each game you ore
given 99 on the timer
11(
with which you must
complete all sixteen
levels.
If you think that this
sounds like a tall order
then you'd be right. Every
rime you fall through the
ﬂoor into space you lose a
life, and prolonged
contact with the insects
that infest the levels also
kills you off. Every life lost
also deducts ten from the
timer. Luckily for
completion's sake you con
get extra time back. There
are alarm clocks in various
places which give bonus
seconds, and completing
a level also tops up the
timer.
Starting each game is
done by selecting from a
choice of four levels. This
begins at Oa 06. 09 and
10, but as you advance
the range of levels to
choose from also
advances. This option lets
you travel back levels as
well so if you're conﬁdent
enough about a level you
can do it all over again to
get some time.

Your bouncy chum is
extremely responsive to
your conrrol. To a limited
degree he con be steered
in rhe air. Getting into the
air in the ﬁrst place is done
either by jumping or
rolling over a wing. These
catapult you into the air
and you turn grey. plus
you can ﬂy around for a
few seconds. This con be
bad news because the
chances are you'll ﬂy into
a sealed chamber and
not be able to get out
again.
Various items are
impossible to reach
withour the point pots.
These let you draw in
extra ﬂoor to run over.
You may even ﬁnd that
you need to use several
of them in a row to
complete a level. Other
physical problems ore
pinball bumpers, ice,
rebounding fences and
disappearing squares.
Cloud Kingdoms is o
very nice piece of
programming indeed.
Everything is well
designed, from the rubber
heroes disapproving frown
to the animated title
pages. There's a wicked
soundtrack on the high
score and title pages and
the in game FX add to the
atmosphere. As for
gomeplay, you won't be
able to put the joystick
down once you're srarted.
Looks like cure games are
copping the honours this

smile, a mutilation
and a whole lot of
fun. The circus has one
performance to earn
enough cash to pay off
the lease, but Freddy has
his own designs and they
ore ﬁendish to say the
least.
Roll up, roll up, up to
ﬁve players can roll up.
The events are still
performed individually but
the competitive edge is
there. The ﬁrst performance
is Horace the High Diver.
This perilous act has
Horace diving from
increasing heights into
decreasing receptacles.
On his downward journey
he must spin (waggle the
stick), and perform the
requested moves
(memorise these, reading
the instructions during
ﬂight can be dangerous).
Ar the termination of the
dive Horace must be in
line with the receptacle or
the performance ends.
Freddy has the nasty habit
of appearing with a fan to
blow Horace off course.
Next, Jeffy-Joe the
Juggler with his sea lion
accomplice performs
juggling fears upon a
unicycle. Drop too many
objects ond you're off but
watch our for Freddy as he
tempts your accomplice
with a ﬁsh and then
introduces a little
explosive power to top
your performance. Fail to
return Freddy's gift and
you ore out for the count.
Finola of the Flying
Fuller Family is a short
lived performance as she
leaps from trapeze to
trapeze. Catch enough
ropes and she will
Supplier: Mindscope
Price: £9.99 Cassette £14.99 Disk
encounter the burning
hoops but hang around
too long and Freddy will
hasten your downfall.
Knancy Knife has a
rash and a half, as she
rests upon the spinning
wheel you throw your
deadly blades at balloon
targets between her
limbs. Freddy throws
bombs between you and
Knancy to distract you
and, at the end of the act,
she is unbolted, which
makes the performance
fall ﬂat_
The penultimate
performance takes place
on the high wire with Tony
Tiptoe. Balance is essential
but so is speed. On level
one, Freddy wheels Out
the cannon but level two
sees the advent of the
circular saw blades. When
Tony falls he grabs the
rope but Freddy appears
to prise open his ﬁngers.
The ﬁnal act is
Fernando the Human
Cannonball. Examine the
powder level in the
cannon and then position
the target, set the cannon
angle and away you go.
If you manage to avoid
the posts and rhe ground
you may just hit the
target. On this ﬁnal
'7V7ZZZ7
performance Freddy
places a bung in the end
of the cannon with
disastrous results.
After each
performance you ore
judged by the clowns. The
more entertaining your
act the more the clowns
abuse each other and the
more money you raise. If
you don't raise ten
thousand the circus is
doomed and Freddy has
his wicked way_ An
entertaining game with
some excellent humour
bur in places the graphics
could be a little stronger.

repayments,..
Yes. Doily Double
recreates the thrills of a
day at the races. Take our
your life savings and stick
it on potential tubes of
Bostik in the hope that
one of them won't
collapse before reaching
rhe line. Ever wondered
why horses ore
nicknamed nags? That's
because it's what rhe wife
does when you get home
after blowing all your
dash. -
The game is
packaged brilliantly.
Okay, so the box is
nothing special. Nor is the
disk and no you don't get
o wind up plastic horse
(shame). You do however
get a superb newspaper-
like instruction and form
sheet. This doubles as o
protection sheer to deter
piracy. The form from over
three hundred races is
printed and the horses do
run true to form - most of
rhe time -just as in real
life.
Unfortunately the
horses are ﬁctitious so you
can't try to recoup your
losses on Desert Orchid in
the Cheltenham Gold Cup
recenrly, Fortunately this
also means that it won't
let you down again
eirher. Despite Orchid's
absence you con still lose
oodles of money though.
The graphical
representation of the
game is about as good as
Desert's form at the cup.
Bad. However, this parr of
any horsie game tends to
be secondary ro the
gameploy.
Despite the
Legoishness the horses do .

run (cit least the ones you
haven't backed do). The
sound COnSiSt5 of forty
noises as the nags try their
best to rob you blind ond
burps as you select bers
and so on. Neither
graphics nor sound ore as
important as the form of
horses and this is realistic
enough to satisfy ardent
turf accountonts,
There's no disguising
rhe fact rhor this game is
based upon pure greed.
You're at the races for no
reason other than to
gamble and make
money. There are nine
types of bet ro use, from
the Daily double to exotic
bets like Quintella and
Parlay. (Durrell° is a bet
where you predict both
ﬁrst and second places
(not easy). Parlay is a bet
over two horses in
different races. These are
or top of the normal win
place and show.
Your current betting
status con be coiled up. or
you can view present or
later races_ A certain
amount of forward
planning can thus be used
to budger your ﬂutters_
You can take between
$1004500 with you and
after each race any wins
you might hove will be
displayed plus the
awaited outcome of
Parlays.
And that's it. Nothing
very special but quite
compulsive if you're into
horse racing. Not nearly as
cure as many of the other
games this month so if
you don't like gambling
you're better off spending
your money on jelly tors
(approximately 75
packets if you bought the
disk version).

WHO FRAMED
ENTERTAINMENT
INTERNATIONAL
He's Bock. Yer another
astonishing YC world exclu-
sive! The weird... The
wacky... The
wonderful. Simon Power
'has been drogged our of
semi-retirement to write
almost exclusively for rhe
fun magazine. You read
his stuff here, and you
read his stuff FIRST.
T
oasis in a _jungle full of
naked women -
Basildon, on a mission
to meet the jolly nice people at
that good or sunny Entertainment
International software house.' He
muttered to himself with glee.
"Visions of a depressing looking
pre-fab corrugated yukky, 1
wouldn't run a business from their
image' started to appear in my
mind,' He continued merrily.
"On arriving at launch pod 3,
parking my new little run around, I
drew, from its sheath, my blade
and storied to hack a path through
the ruffage to the Entertainment
International front door.
''Shock, horror, gasp, wow,
could I believe my eyes, is this
really happening to me. etc, etc.
all that crop. These people that
gave us such visual delights as
Space Ace and Dragon's Lair ore.
and this is as true as all the puns
about the Pope relieving his bowels
in rhe woods, animated. Its true, all
the guys and girls that work there
are cartoons. Rag. Rabbit step
aside. the Entertainment Interna-
tional team is here!" Becoming
over zealous he falls from his seat in
convulsions.
"All are cartoons or 'Toons'
except one. And her name is
Coldilocks,.. Sorry wrong story. Her
name was Marisa. Marisa wants to
be a shark one day, or a dog
called Rex (More of that later) but
Is quite happy for now to deal with
all the annoying interviews with the
press."
"Marisa is os scrummy os o bowl
of cherries on a cold winters night!
And was extremely keen to pass on
lots of hot _juicy information about
the goings on in their camp. So
here goes. All you ever wanted to
know obout the people who put
out games under the Empire and
Titus labels." Please forgive him for
the rather corporate last sentence,
YC 4 7

The company was founded in
October 1987. by tvio happy go
lucky toons - Simon Jeffrey and Ian
Higgins. Operations began in a
small dark, dismal back room, but
being fun roans who liked to
boogie on down to the latest hor
bear they soon hod the place
rocking.
"In between all the partying
and food ﬁghts with their roan
buddies (it is rumoured that one of
these such chaps is Sir Bugs himself.)
They managed to start producing
some amazing action games for all
Commodore machines (C64.
Amiga and PC)."
"The ﬁrst game was under the
'Titus' label and was 'Crazy Cars'.
'Crazy Carts II' was soon to follow,
which gave them their hottest,
fastest, slickest, biggest seller to
dare. 'Crazy Cars I & II' still sell on
the budger label 'Hirsquad
give the player a chance or smash-
ing up a BMW, Porsche or a Ferrari,
while trying to see some of Amer-
ica's biggest and bestest tourist
hang-outs. Speed is the name of
the game - which was so addictive
even the Government tried to ban
it!!!" He becomes hysterical and
raises his voice to an extreme level.
"But will the 'Crazy Cars' duo
soon be ﬂung from the Entertain-
ment Internotional number 1 spot?
They seem to think so because,
they have what is going to be the
early sensation of the nineties. Due
for release in the beginning of
March is the gome that will hit the
nation harder than a gale force
wind. It is so exciting that even the
bond of merry toons who work
there can't stop playing. After the
game was ﬁrst seen by them, a
party bigger than no other resulted
-  which was the biggest, the best,
the longest and rhe loudest one
ever... The label is Titus - the game
is Pipemania.
ment emerges from him as his tale
is told.
"Okay, so maybe that is a slight
exaggeration. Maybe the party
didn't last as long as I implied. Bur,
what the hell_ The game is good - I
should know - I've played it„ so
there. There's no need to be
jealous though. Old Uncle Simon
will tell you all about it." He begins
to colm down.
"The graphics are neat and are
what some may call - simple. The
background music could become a
little annoying with time. But we all

Stunt Car Racer
This one is an arcade game. Well,
it's a sort of simulation. Erm... it's o

must race both drivers in turn on

about... twelve drivers, This one's a
bit different from all of the others,
in that the graphics ore vectors,
surely the future of the fastest racing
games.
The 'car' is rendered pretty well,
and the track moves pretty fast as
well. This game is really

 Aw, go on...

Not content with that lot? Well
luckily for you the furure holds some
pretty hot poop releases on the ol'
Commy 64 racing front. Amongst
the forthcoming attractions ore, for
example, Drivin' Force, by Digital
Magic. Drivin' Force allows you to
race all sorts of vehicles, from
formula One cars to Werbikes,
round loads of Power Drift style
tracks. This one is o megohit on the
sixteen bit machines. and Digitol
Magic have been inundated with
requests from dealers for a
Commodore 84 version. At the
time of going to press it was still in
rhe very early stages, but it's bound
to be a corker if it's anything like
the other versions.
Hard Drivin', the arcade licence
converted by DOMOrk should be
hitting the shops at about the some
rime as this issue of YC. Most of you
will be familiar with the arcade
version, in which you hack around
various tracks and smash into cows,
amongst other things. It'll probably
be a pretty hot conversion, but one
criticism of other versions has been
that it's a fairly easy to complete
and doesn't hold much appeal
once it is ﬁnished_
Who's to soy what's going to
happen beyond that? No doubt
someone like Ocean will be
announcing the rights to Chase HQ
II or some point. And another thing.
Super Monaco Grand Prix has been
around in the arcades for last six
months now, and no one has
announced the license.
Whossamatter folks? Too scared of
such an awesome conversion tosk?
At least let us know who's gor he

he Labyrinthe is a live
roleploying system oased in
reo y e  complex in Kent.
Live ro playing is like
laying a fanrasy g o re  for real.
You take the part of a  warrior,
wizard, scout, priest or whatever
and ploy them as if you were that
person. This extends to the costing
of spells and all of the combat your
character gers involved with,
No more will the chance of
success or failure depend on a dice
roll. If something goes wrong it's
because you mode ir that way. The
intrepid YC team of Adrian Boris
Pumphrey, Rikki Tikki Henderson
and the infamous Eugene
“Chainsow" Cotter-Cairns
descended upon Chislehurst with
reinforcements to give it a bash.
There is little actual danger
involved in live roleplaying. The
weapons ore generally a
combination of corrymat and silver
tope and ore on the most port
safe. Reckless blows are nor
permitted, nor is misuse of the
shield. The worst you can do is run
into a wall or trip over. The caves
are very chalky though so you'll
need to take old clothing. Costume
can be as elaborate or as simple as
you wish. It's you character after oil.
First timers will be given a
training session and a lesson in
safety. The age limit o f sixteen will
be strictly adhered to but younger
players con arrange special
dungeons. Don't go expecting to
be half hearted about it - you're in
and involved 100%. But the

He gave a little whimper and

looked around ot the other
occupants of the tavern. There were
another couple of warrior types,
including on Eastern ﬁghter called
Kintaro, one or Iwo priests, a smelly
Half Orc called Gonad and o
Hobbit. This little guy must hove
about 5 tall and introduced himself
as Slyrooth Daggerpickens.
The atmosphere was quire easy
once we got chafﬁng. However the
air was broken by the entrance of a
strange wizardly character, he
walked in and I could almost see
his aura of power. He said that his
name was Sardis and that he
needed a parry of adventurers. An
earthquake near the town of
Mange hod uncovered an ancient
scroll, This needed bringing back

Approaching Mange, the Half

and making pleasant snufﬂing
noises. When we asked what he
was up to he said "Can't ya smell
it?''. Then the wind changed
direction and the stench of rotting
corpses hit us. As if to punctuate this
smell, three rotting Humanoids
approached us. Duckworth the
priest rattled off some harsh Qu i
sounds, paused as if listening, and
told us they were undead. At this
point DK suddenly went mad! The
blows seemed to almosr bounce
off him as he madly sloshed at the
living dead.
Once they fell (quite quickly
actually) he turned and charged
into the rest of the party! We oil hit
the deck, except for the hapless
Boris. He stood his ground_

After a while we met a

tricks. Our he made the mistake of
calling DK stupid so the inevitable
happened. While his berserk rage
was occurring I crawled away to a

us about the tunnel. Looking at the
mop I ascertained that ir was the
right tunnel.

dispatched the ghoul and sat
huddled in the tunnel whilst DK
argued with a shimmering snake.
The argument ended with the
snake spraying him with a contact
poison while he smegged the git!
He felt very ill afterwards as the
poison worked through his veins.
Faced with the prospect of his
death. I forced him to drink ﬁve
healing potions while the priests
cured his locational damage.
DK was up on his feet again.

this frightened him away back
down the tunnel. However, I
looked forward to this confrontation
- someone to match my powers
against. Muttering words of magic I
wove a spell of magic armour
about myself. Then I gasped in
shock as he produced a Gnome -
sixth level spell! This was too much
for me to face alone; I cast another
spell which camouﬂaged me with
the wall (raising my hand to
indicate that I was invisible).
Gonad took on the Gnome in
pure darkness with me in support.
We soon dealt with it, and the
Mummy, the druid was on his own
now. Faced with Gonad,. Kintaro
and me he soon succumbed to the
odds. Nor before he crippled
my arm though. As he fell I
used my good arm to grab
the staff away from him.
Then it was hunt the priest

FLAME ON
, Stuart Green looks or the
comic renaissance, whilst
Rik Henderson revies the
laresr in mainstream
LIFORNIAN'S
ITH ATTITUDE
I
slowly recover from the media
overkill that was the Batman
movie, and with several more
multi million dollar comic based
movies in production thot ten years
ago the comic industry was on its
knees. In America a hordcore half
million readers were supporting an
industry thot in the ﬁfties and sixties
had been quite used to selling a
million plus of top selling titles. And
in Britain the anthology comic, that
hod been the publishers' mainstay
since time immemorial was slowly
going to the wall to leave 2000 AD
practically on its rod in your local
newsagents.
Despite what you may read
elsewhere, it was nor fancy re-
readings of the superhero myths
that kickstarted the now
fashionable comic renaissance. but
the pioneering philosophies of
independent publishers both here
and in the States.
LOVE AND
ROCKETS
First among the independents is
Fantographics Books of California. In
1982 they started to publish their
ﬁrst regular comic Love and Rockets
(quarterly, b/w E1.95), written and
drawn by Mexican American
brothers, Gilbert and Joimie
Hernondez. who had spent much
of the seventies on the dole,
ﬂanging our or LA pub gigs. Always
big comic fans - their mother hod
collected them and passed on her
enthusiasm to her sons, they'd read
everything, from o staple diet of
Marvel, DC's, Archie comics, to the
more left ﬁeld experiments of the
sixties underground artists. In 1981
this all storied to come together in
the ﬁrst issue of Love and Rockets;
the locol punks and punkettes: the
music. the Brothers Mexican
heritage, the comic dreomscope.
drown in an elegant clear line.
Jamie introduced two female
characters. Moggie and Hopey, in
the title strip, as port of a futurist
world replete with the usual comic/
sci-ﬁ parophanalla of Hover Cars,
Spaceships and dinosaurs. Even
then it was so much imaginatively
conceived junk, unnecessary
padding to the most charming,
sexy, smart-mouthed cast of
characters since Stan Lee ﬁrst said
'make mine marvel'. Within ﬁve
issues much of it had been
jettisoned in favour of a series of
stories that revolve around Maggie
and Hopey and rhe people they
know in Hoppers 13. Los Angeles,
It's like all the Rebel movies Francis
Ford Coppola always dreams of
making, that John Hughes couldn
even conceive of.
Gilbert focussed his attention on
creating the mythical Mexican
village of Palomar with a series of
stories that go under the collective
title of Heartbreak Soup, His cast,
that ranges from Tonantzin who set
herself on ﬁre in protest against the
world's starving, to Luba, owner of
the local cinema and mistress of
the bath house. Its a rich and
complex .
of toles thot weave together with
all the myth and magic of Mexican
folk toles and comic fantasy.

NEAT STUFF
Then there is Jaimie 'Tank Girl'
Hewlett, ond Phillip 'Wired World'
Bond's favourite comic Neat Stuff
(quarterly. b/w). by Peter Bagge
humour comic that contains some
of the funniest and most accurate
comedy of the previous decode.
Bogge concentrates his vision on
the loonies who populate the Great
American suburbs. For instance, The
Bradleys: Mom. Pop. Buddy, Bobs
and Butch the all-American family:
spiteful, small-minded, petty and
hysterical. A picture of o group of
people held together by nothing
more than blood, they don't like
each other or all. When they erupt.
Bogge's cartooning does
hallucinatory cartwheels, his
characters distorting into hilarious
visages of sharks teeth, and evil
popping eyes.
SINNER
Sinner (quarterly, b/w 61,95) by
Jose Munoz and Carlos Sampayo
mines the more familiar territory of
the private eye. Originally taking its
cues from the hard boiled pulp of
Raymond Chandler and Dashiell
Hammett, Sinner has developed
into an investigation of the Big City,
any city, any place but New York.
The deadbeats, the drunks, the
panhandlers, the lost and the
lonely, all get a look in as Alock
Sinner tries to come to terms with
his own devils as well as those of
the city he loves to hate.

DA REVIEW BIT
NIGHT BREED #1
Epic Comics
This is on adaptation of the
forecoming horror shocker from
Clive Barker, and if rumours ore
true, it seems as if the comic may
do better than the movie itself. This
is a shame though, because the
ﬁlm looks as if it could be truly
stunning, whereas John Wagner,
Alan Grant, and Jim Baikie's version
falls very short of the mark we have
come to expect from comics with
Mr. Barker's name attached.
Its nor as if it's bad, just when
compared to some truly horriﬁc
tales, like Hellblazer and Sandman,
Night Breed owes for too much to
the gore aspect than the ability to
shock the mind, Also Jim Baikie's
artwork does nor lend itself ro this
side of the comic industry,
Not SO much OS let down, more
a third buy after Hellblazer and
Sandman.

Being edited by two of the
industry's most respected comic strip
ortists, Garry Leach and Dave Elliott,
there is con be no doubt that the
quality inside this compilation of
short strips will be very high indeed.

upstanding members of the trade

issue, for me, is mode by a truly
excellent Bojeffries by Alan Moore
