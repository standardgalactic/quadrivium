Preface
Why study geometry? Those who have progressed far enough in their mathematical edu-
cation to read this book can probably come up with lots of answers to that question:
 Geometry is useful. It’s hard to ﬁnd a branch of mathematics that has more practi-
cal applications than geometry. A precise understanding of geometric relationships
is prerequisite for making progress in architecture, astronomy, computer graphics,
engineering, mapmaking, medical imaging, physics, robotics, sewing, or surveying,
among many other ﬁelds.
 Geometry is beautiful. Because geometry is primarily about spatial relationships, the
subject comes with plenty of illustrations, many of which have an austere beauty in
their own right. On a deeper level, the study of geometry uncovers surprising and
unexpected relationships among shapes, the contemplation of which can inspire an
exquisitely satisfying sense of beauty. And, of course, to some degree, geometric
relationships underlie almost all visual arts.
 Geometry comes naturally. Along with counting and arithmetic, geometry is one of
the earliest areas of intellectual inquiry to have been systematically pursued by human
societies. Similarly, children start to learn about geometry (naming shapes) as early as
two years old, about the same time they start learning about numbers. Almost every
culture has developed some detailed understanding of geometrical relationships.
 Geometry is logical. As will be explored in some detail in this book, very early in
Western history geometry became the paradigm for logical thought and analysis, and
students have learned the rudiments of logic and proof in geometry courses for more
than two millennia.
All of these are excellent reasons to devote serious study to geometry. But there is a
more profound consideration that animates this book: the story of geometry is the story of
mathematics itself. There is no better way to understand what modern mathematics is, how
it is done, and why it is the way it is than by undertaking a thorough study of the roots of
geometry.

Preface
Mathematics occupies a unique position among the ﬁelds of human intellectual in-
quiry. It shares many of the characteristics of science: like scientists, mathematicians strive
for precision, make assertions that are testable and refutable, and seek to discover universal
laws. But there is at least one way in which mathematics is markedly different from most
sciences, and indeed from virtually every other subject: in mathematics, it is possible to
have a degree of certainty about the truth of an assertion that is usually impossible to attain
in any other ﬁeld. When mathematicians assert that the area of a unit circle is exactly ,
we know this is true as surely as we know the facts of our direct experience, such as the
fact that I am currently sitting at a desk looking at a computer screen. Moreover, we know
that we could calculate  to far greater precision than anyone will ever be able to measure
actual physical areas.
Of course, this is not to claim that mathematical knowledge is absolute. No human
knowledge is ever 100% certain—we all make mistakes, or we might be hallucinating or
dreaming. But mathematical knowledge is as certain as anything in the human experience.
By contrast, the assertions of science are always approximate and provisional: Newton’s
law of universal gravitation was true enough to pass the experimental tests of his time, but
it was eventually superseded by Einstein’s general theory of relativity. Einstein’s theory,
in turn, has withstood most of the tests it has been subjected to, but physicists are always
ready to admit that there might be a more accurate theory.
How did we get here? What is it about mathematics that gives it such certainty and thus
sets it apart from the natural sciences, social sciences, humanities, and arts? The answer
is, above all, the concept of proof. Ever since ancient times, mathematicians have realized
that it is often possible to demonstrate the truth of a mathematical statement by giving a
logical argument that is so convincing and so universal that it leaves essentially no doubt.
At ﬁrst, these arguments, when they were found, were mostly ad hoc and depended on the
reader’s willingness to accept other seemingly simpler truths: if we grant that such-and-
such is true, then the Pythagorean theorem logically follows. As time progressed, more
proofs were found and the arguments became more sophisticated. But the development of
mathematical knowledge since ancient times has been much more than just amassing ever
more convincing arguments for an ever larger list of mathematical facts.
There have been two decisive turning points in the history of mathematics, which to-
gether are primarily responsible for leading mathematics to the special position it occupies
today. The ﬁrst was the appearance, around 300 BCE, of Euclid’s Elements. In this mon-
umental work, Euclid organized essentially all of the mathematical knowledge that had
been developed in the Western world up to that time (mainly geometry and number theory)
into a systematic logical structure. Only a few simple, seemingly self-evident facts (known
as postulates or axioms) were stated without proof, and all other mathematical statements
(known as propositions or theorems) were proved in a strict logical sequence, with the
proofs of the simplest theorems based only on the postulates and with proofs of more com-
plicated theorems based on theorems that had already been proved. This structure, known
today as the axiomatic method, was so effective and so convincing that it became the model
for justifying all further mathematical inquiry.
But Euclid’s Eden was not without its snake. Beginning soon after Euclid’s time,
mathematicians raised objections to one of Euclid’s geometric postulates (the famous ﬁfth
postulate, which we describe in Chapter 1) on the ground that it was too complicated to
be considered truly self-evident in the way that his other postulates were. A consensus

Preface

developed among mathematicians who made a serious study of geometry that the ﬁfth
postulate was really a theorem masquerading as a postulate and that Euclid had simply
failed to ﬁnd the proper proof of it. So for about two thousand years, the study of geometry
was largely dominated by attempts to ﬁnd a proof of Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate based only on
the other four postulates. Many proofs were offered, but all were eventually found to be
fatally ﬂawed, usually because they implicitly assumed some other fact that was also not
justiﬁed by the ﬁrst four postulates and thus required a proof of its own.
The second decisive turning point in mathematics history occurred in the ﬁrst half
of the nineteenth century, when an insight occurred simultaneously and independently to
three different mathematicians (Nikolai Lobachevsky, J´anos Bolyai, and Carl Friedrich
Gauss). There was a good reason nobody had succeeded in proving that the ﬁfth postulate
followed from the other four: such a proof is logically impossible! The insight that struck
these three mathematicians was that it is possible to construct an entirely self-consistent
kind of geometry, now called non-Euclidean geometry, in which the ﬁrst four postulates
are true but the ﬁfth is false. This geometry did not seem to describe the physical world
we live in, but the fact that it is logically just as consistent as Euclidean geometry forced
mathematicians to undertake a radical reevaluation of the very nature of mathematical truth
and the meaning of the axiomatic method.
Once that insight had been achieved, things progressed rapidly. A new paradigm of the
axiomatic method arose, in which the axioms were no longer thought of as statements of
self-evident truths from which reliable conclusions could be drawn, but rather as arbitrary
statements that were to be accepted as truths in a given mathematical context, so that the
theorems following from them must be true if the axioms are true.
Paradoxically, this act of unmooring the axiomatic method from any preconceived no-
tions of absolute truth eventually allowed mathematics to achieve previously undreamed of
levels of certainty. The reason for this paradox is not hard to discern: once mathematicians
realized that axioms are more or less arbitrary assumptions rather than self-evident truths,
it became clear that proofs based on the axioms can use only those facts that have been
explicitly stated in the axioms or previously proved, and the steps of such proofs must be
based on clear and incontrovertible principles of logic. Thus it is no longer permissible to
base arguments on geometric or numerical intuition about how things behave in the “real
world.” If it happens that the axioms are deemed to be a useful and accurate description of
something, such as a scientiﬁc phenomenon or a class of mathematical objects, then every
conclusion proved within that axiomatic system is exactly as certain and as accurate as the
axioms themselves. For example, we can all agree that Euclid’s geometric postulates are
extremely accurate descriptions of the geometry of a building on the scale at which humans
experience it, so the conclusions of Euclidean geometry can be relied upon to describe that
geometry as accurately as we might wish. On the other hand, it might turn out to be the
case that the axioms of non-Euclidean geometry are much more accurate descriptions of
the geometry of the universe as a whole (on a scale at which galaxies can be treated as uni-
formly scattered dust), which would mean that the theorems of non-Euclidean geometry
could be treated as highly accurate descriptions of the cosmos.
If mathematics occupies a unique position among ﬁelds of human inquiry, then ge-
ometry can be said to occupy a similarly unique position among subﬁelds of mathematics.
Geometry was the ﬁrst subject to which Euclid applied his logical analysis, and it has been
taught to students for more than two millennia as a model of logical thought. It was the

xiv
Preface
subject that engendered the breakthrough in the nineteenth century that led to our modern
conception of the axiomatic method (and thus of the very nature of mathematics). Un-
til very recently, virtually every high-school student in the United States took a geometry
course based on some version of the axiomatic method, and that was the only time in the
lives of most people when they learned about rigorous logical deduction.
The primary purpose of this book is to tell this story: not exactly the historical story,
because it is not a book about the history of mathematics, but rather the intellectual story of
how one might begin with Euclid’s understanding of the axiomatic method in geometry and
progress to our modern understanding of it. Since the axiomatic method underlies the way
modern mathematics is universally done, understanding it is crucial to understanding what
mathematics is, how we read and evaluate mathematical arguments, and why mathematics
has achieved the level of certainty it has.
It should be emphasized, though, that while the axiomatic method is our only tool for
ensuring that our mathematical knowledge is sound and for communicating that soundness
to others, it is not the only tool, and probably not even the most important one, for dis-
covering or understanding mathematics. For those purposes we rely at least as much on
examples, diagrams, scientiﬁc applications, intuition, and experience as we do on proofs.
But in the end, especially as our mathematics becomes increasingly abstract, we cannot
justiﬁably claim to be sure of the truth of any mathematical statement unless we have
found a proof of it.
This book has been developed as a textbook for a course called Geometry for Teachers,
and it is aimed primarily at undergraduate students who plan to teach geometry in a North
American high-school setting. However, it is emphatically not a book about how to teach
geometry; that is something that aspiring teachers will have to learn from education courses
and from hands-on practice. What it offers, instead, is an opportunity to understand on
a deep level how mathematics works and how it came to be the way it is, while at the
same time developing most of the concrete geometric relationships that secondary teachers
will need to know in the classroom. It is not only for future teachers, though: it should
also provide something of interest to anyone who wishes to understand Euclidean and
non-Euclidean geometry better and to develop skills for doing proofs within an axiomatic
system.
In recent years, sadly, the traditional proof-oriented geometry course has sometimes
been replaced by different kinds of courses that minimize the importance of the axiomatic
method in geometry. But regardless of what kinds of curriculum and pedagogical methods
teachers plan to use, it is of central importance that they attain a deep understanding of the
underlying mathematical ideas of the subject and a mathematical way of thinking about
them—a version of what the mathematics education specialist Liping Ma [Ma99] calls
“profound understanding of fundamental mathematics.” It is my hope that this book will
be a vehicle that can help to take them there.
Many books that treat axiomatic geometry rigorously (such as [Gre08], [Moi90],
[Ven05]) pass rather quickly through Euclidean geometry, with a major goal of devel-
oping non-Euclidean geometry and its relationship to Euclidean geometry. In this book, by
contrast, the primary focus is on Euclidean geometry, because that is the subject that future
secondary geometry teachers will need to understand most deeply. I do make a serious
excursion into hyperbolic geometry at the end of the book, but it is meant to round out the

Preface
xv
study of Euclidean geometry and place it in its proper perspective, not to be the main focus
of the book.
Organization
The book is organized into twenty chapters. The ﬁrst chapter introduces Euclid. It
seeks to familiarize the reader with what Euclid did and did not accomplish and to explain
why the axiomatic method underwent such a radical revision in the nineteenth century.
The ﬁrst book of Euclid’s Elements should be read in parallel with this chapter. It is a good
idea for an aspiring geometry teacher to have a complete copy of the Elements in his or her
library, and I strongly recommend the edition [Euc02], which is a carefully edited edition
containing all thirteen volumes of the Elements in a single book. But for those who are
not ready to pay for a hard copy of the book, it is easy to ﬁnd translations of the Elements
on the Internet. An excellent source is Dominic Joyce’s online edition [Euc98], which
includes interactive diagrams.
The second chapter of this book constitutes a general introduction to the modern ax-
iomatic method, using a “toy” axiomatic system as a laboratory for experimenting with the
concepts and methods of proof. This system, called incidence geometry, contains only a
few axioms that describe the intersections of points and lines. It is a complete axiomatic
system, but it describes only a very small part of geometry so as to make it easier to con-
centrate on the logical features of the system. It is not my invention; it is adapted from the
axiomatic system for Euclidean geometry introduced by David Hilbert at the turn of the last
century (see Appendix A), and many other authors (e.g., [Gre08], [Moi90], [Ven05]) have
also used a similar device to introduce the principles of the axiomatic method. The axioms
I use are close to those of Hilbert but are modiﬁed slightly so that each axiom focuses on
only one simple fact, so as to make it easier to analyze how different interpretations do
or do not satisfy all of the axioms. At the end of the chapter, I walk students through the
process of constructing proofs in the context of incidence geometry.
The heart of the book is a modern axiomatic treatment of Euclidean geometry, which
occupies Chapters 3 through 16. I have chosen a set of axioms for Euclidean geometry
that is based roughly on the SMSG axiom system developed for high-school courses in
the 1960s (see Appendix C), which in turn was based on the system proposed by George
Birkhoff [Bir32] in 1932 (see Appendix B). In choosing the axioms for this book, I’ve
endeavored to keep the postulates closely parallel to those that are typically used in high-
school courses, while maintaining a much higher standard of rigor than is typical in such
courses. In particular, my postulates differ from the SMSG ones in several important ways:
 I restrict my postulates to plane geometry only.
 I omit the redundant ruler placement and supplement postulates. (The ﬁrst is a theo-
rem in Chapter 3, and the second is a theorem in Chapter 4.)
 I rephrase the plane separation postulate to refer only to the elementary concept of
intersections between line segments and lines, instead of building convexity into the
postulate. (Convexity of half-planes is proved in Chapter 3.)
 I replace the three SMSG postulates about angle measures with a single “protrac-
tor postulate,” much closer in spirit to Birkhoff’s original angle measure postulate,
more closely parallel to the ruler postulate, and, I think, more intuitive. (Theorems
equivalent to the three SMSG angle measure postulates are proved in Chapter 4.)

xvi
Preface
 I replace the SMSG postulate about the area of a triangle with a postulate about the
area of a unit square, which is much more fundamental.
After the treatment of Euclidean geometry comes a transitional chapter (Chapter 17),
which summarizes the most important postulates that have been found to be equivalent to
the Euclidean parallel postulate. In so doing, it sets the stage for the study of hyperbolic
geometry by introducing such important concepts as the angle defect of a polygon. Then
Chapters 18 and 19 treat hyperbolic geometry, culminating in the classiﬁcation of parallel
lines into asymptotically parallel and ultraparallel lines.
Chapter 20 is a look forward at some of the directions in which the study of geometry
can be continued. I hope it will whet the reader’s appetite for further advanced study in
geometry.
After Chapter 20 come a number of appendices meant to supplement the main text.
The ﬁrst four appendices (A through D) are reference lists of axioms for the axiomatic sys-
tems of Hilbert, Birkhoff, SMSG, and this book. The next two appendices (E and F) give
brief descriptions of the conventions of mathematical language and proofs; they can serve
either as introductions to these subjects for students who have not been introduced to rig-
orous proofs before or as review for those who have. Appendices G and H give a very brief
summary of background material on sets, functions, and the real number system, which is
presupposed by the axiom system used in this book. Finally, Appendix I outlines an al-
ternative approach to the axioms based on the ideas of transformations and rigid motions;
it ends with a collection of challenging exercises that might be used as starting points for
independent projects.
There is ample material here for a full-year course at a reasonable pace. For shorter
courses, there are various things that can be omitted, depending on the tastes of the in-
structor and the needs of the students. Of course, if your interest is solely in Euclidean
geometry, you can always stop after Chapter 16 or 17. On the other hand, if you want to
move more quickly through the Euclidean material and spend more time on non-Euclidean
geometry, there are various Euclidean topics that are not used in an essential way later in
the book and can safely be skipped, such as the material on nonconvex polygons at the end
of Chapter 8 and some or all of Chapters 14, 15, or 16. Don’t worry if the course seems
to move slowly at ﬁrst—it has been my experience that it takes a rather long time to get
through the ﬁrst six chapters, but things tend to move more quickly after that.
I adhere to some typographical conventions that I hope will make the book easier to
use. Mathematical terms are typeset in bold italics when they are ofﬁcially introduced, to
reﬂect the fact that deﬁnitions are just as important as theorems and proofs but ﬁt better
into the ﬂow of paragraphs rather than being called out with special headings. The symbol
 is used to mark the ends of proofs, and it is also used at the end of the statement of a
corollary that follows so easily that it is not necessary to write down a proof. The symbol
// marks the ends of numbered examples.
The exercises at the ends of the chapters are essential for mastering the type of thinking
that leads to a deep understanding of mathematical concepts. Most of them are proofs.
Almost all of them can be done by using techniques very similar to ones used in the proofs
in the book, although a few of the exercises in the later chapters might require a bit more
ingenuity.

Prerequisites
Because this book is written as a textbook for an advanced undergraduate course, I
expect readers to be conversant with most of the subjects that are typically treated at the
beginning and intermediate undergraduate levels. In particular, readers should be comfort-
able at least with one-variable calculus, vector algebra in the plane, mathematical induc-
tion, and elementary set theory. It would also be good to have already seen the least upper
bound principle and the notions of injective and surjective functions.
Students who have had a course that required them to construct rigorous mathematical
proofs will have a distinct advantage in reading the book and doing the exercises. But for
students whose experience with proofs is limited, a careful study of Appendices E and F
should provide sufﬁcient opportunities to deepen their understanding of what proofs are
and how to read and write them.
Acknowledgments
I am deeply indebted to my colleague John Palmieri, who has taught from two different
draft versions of this book and contributed immeasurably to improving it. I owe just as
much thanks to my students, many of whom—especially Natalie Hobson, Dan Riness, and
Gina Bremer—have generously and patiently provided detailed suggestions for helping
the book to serve students better. Of course, I owe enormous gratitude to a long list of
authors who have written rigorous texts about Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry that
have educated and inspired me, especially Marvin Greenberg [Gre08], Robin Hartshorne
[Har00], George Martin [Mar96], Richard Millman and George Parker [MP91], Edwin
Moise [Moi90], and Gerard Venema [Ven05].
Additional Resources
I plan to post some supplementary materials, as well as a list of corrections, on the
website www.ams.org/bookpages/amstext-21. For the sake of future readers, I encourage
all readers to make notes of any mistakes you ﬁnd and any passages you think could use
improvement, whether major or trivial, and send them to me at the email address posted on
the website above. Happy reading!

Chapter 1
Euclid
The story of axiomatic geometry begins with Euclid, the most famous mathematician in
history. We know essentially nothing about Euclid’s life, save that he was a Greek who
lived and worked in Alexandria, Egypt, around 300 BCE. His best known work is the El-
ements [Euc02], a thirteen-volume treatise that organized and systematized essentially all
of the knowledge of geometry and number theory that had been developed in the Western
world up to that time.
It is believed that most of the mathematical results of the Elements were known well
before Euclid’s time. Euclid’s principal achievement was not the discovery of new mathe-
matical facts, but something much more profound: he was apparently the ﬁrst mathemati-
cian to ﬁnd a way to organize virtually all known mathematical knowledge into a single
coherent, logical system, beginning with a list of deﬁnitions and a small number of as-
sumptions (called postulates) and progressing logically to prove every other result from
the postulates and the previously proved results. The Elements provided the Western world
with a model of deductive mathematical reasoning whose essential features we still emu-
late today.
A brief remark is in order regarding the authorship of the Elements. Scholars of Greek
mathematics are convinced that some of the text that has come down to us as the Elements
was not in fact written by Euclid but instead was added by later authors. For some portions
of the text, this conclusion is well founded—for example, there are passages that appear in
earlier Greek manuscripts as marginal notes but that are part of the main text in later edi-
tions; it is reasonable to conclude that these passages were added by scholars after Euclid’s
time and were later incorporated into Euclid’s text when the manuscript was recopied. For
other passages, the authorship is less clear—some scholars even speculate that the deﬁni-
tions might have been among the later additions. We will probably never know exactly
what Euclid’s original version of the Elements looked like.
Since our purpose here is primarily to study the logical development of geometry and
not its historical development, let us simply agree to use the name Euclid to refer to the
writer or writers of the text that has been passed down to us as the Elements and leave it to
the historians to explore the subtleties of multiple authorship.

Reading Euclid
Before going any further, you should take some time now to glance at Book I of the Ele-
ments, which contains most of Euclid’s elementary results about plane geometry. As we
discuss each of the various parts of the text—deﬁnitions, postulates, common notions, and
propositions—you should go back and read through that part carefully. Be sure to ob-
serve how the propositions build logically one upon another, each proof relying only on
deﬁnitions, postulates, common notions, and previously proved propositions.
Here are some remarks about the various components of Book I.
Deﬁnitions
If you study Euclid’s deﬁnitions carefully, you will see that they can be divided into
two rather different categories. Many of the deﬁnitions (including the ﬁrst nine) are de-
scriptive deﬁnitions, meaning that they are meant to convey to the reader an intuitive sense
of what Euclid is talking about. For example, Euclid deﬁnes a point as “that which has
no part,” a line as “breadthless length,” and a straight line as “a line which lies evenly
with the points on itself.” (Here and throughout this book, our quotations from Euclid are
taken from the well-known 1908 English translation of the Elements by T. L. Heath, based
on the edition [Euc02] edited by Dana Densmore.) These descriptions serve to guide the
reader’s thinking about these concepts but are not sufﬁciently precise to be used to justify
steps in logical arguments because they typically deﬁne new terms in terms of other terms
that have not been previously deﬁned. For example, Euclid never explains what is meant
by “breadthless length” or by “lies evenly with the points on itself”; the reader is expected
to interpret these deﬁnitions in light of experience and common knowledge. Indeed, in all
the books of the Elements, Euclid never refers to the ﬁrst nine deﬁnitions, or to any other
descriptive deﬁnitions, to justify steps in his proofs.
Contrasted with the descriptive deﬁnitions are the logical deﬁnitions. These are def-
initions that describe a precise mathematical condition that must be satisﬁed in order for
an object to be considered an example of the deﬁned term. The ﬁrst logical deﬁnition in
the Elements is Deﬁnition 10: “When a straight line standing on a straight line makes the
adjacent angles equal to one another, each of the equal angles is right, and the straight line
standing on the other is called a perpendicular to that on which it stands.” This describes
angles in a particular type of geometric conﬁguration (Fig. 1.1) and tells us that we are
entitled to call an angle a right angle if and only if it occurs in a conﬁguration of that type.
(See Appendix E for a discussion about the use of “if and only if ” in deﬁnitions.) Some
other terms for which Euclid provides logical deﬁnitions are circle, isosceles triangle, and
parallel.

Postulates
It is in the postulates that the great genius of Euclid’s achievement becomes evident.
Although mathematicians before Euclid had provided proofs of some isolated geometric
facts (for example, the Pythagorean theorem was probably proved at least two hundred
years before Euclid’s time), it was apparently Euclid who ﬁrst conceived the idea of ar-
ranging all the proofs in a strict logical sequence. Euclid realized that not every geometric
fact can be proved, because every proof must rely on some prior geometric knowledge;
thus any attempt to prove everything is doomed to circularity. He knew, therefore, that
it was necessary to begin by accepting some facts without proof. He chose to begin by
postulating ﬁve simple geometric statements:
 Euclid’s Postulate 1: To draw a straight line from any point to any point.
 Euclid’s Postulate 2: To produce a ﬁnite straight line continuously in a straight line.
 Euclid’s Postulate 3: To describe a circle with any center and distance.
 Euclid’s Postulate 4: That all right angles are equal to one another.
 Euclid’s Postulate 5: That, if a straight line falling on two straight lines make the
interior angles on the same side less than two right angles, the two straight lines,
if produced indeﬁnitely, meet on that side on which are the angles less than the two
right angles.
The ﬁrst three postulates are constructions and should be read as if they began with
the words “It is possible.” For example, Postulate 1 asserts that “[It is possible] to draw a
straight line from any point to any point.” (For Euclid, the term straight line could refer
to a portion of a line with ﬁnite length—what we would call a line segment.) The ﬁrst
three postulates are generally understood as describing in abstract, idealized terms what
we do concretely with the two classical geometric construction tools: a straightedge (a
kind of idealized ruler that is unmarked but indeﬁnitely extendible) and a compass (two
arms connected by a hinge, with a sharp spike on the end of one arm and a drawing im-
plement on the end of the other). With a straightedge, we can align the edge with two
given points and draw a straight line segment connecting them (Postulate 1); and given a
previously drawn straight line segment, we can align the straightedge with it and extend
(or “produce”) it in either direction to form a longer line segment (Postulate 2). With a
compass, we can place the spike at any predetermined point in the plane, place the drawing
tip at any other predetermined point, and draw a complete circle whose center is the ﬁrst
point and whose circumference passes through the second point. The statement of Postu-
late 3 does not precisely specify what Euclid meant by “any center and distance”; but the
way he uses this postulate, for example in Propositions I.1 and I.2, makes it clear that it
is applicable only when the center and one point on the circumference are already given.
(In this book, we follow the traditional convention for referring to Euclid’s propositions by
number: “Proposition I.2” means Proposition 2 in Book I of the Elements.)
The last two postulates are different: instead of asserting that certain geometric con-
ﬁgurations can be constructed, they describe relationships that must hold whenever a given
geometric conﬁguration exists. Postulate 4 is simple: it says that whenever two right angles
have been constructed, those two angles are equal to each other. To interpret this, we must
address Euclid’s use of the word equal. In modern mathematical usage, “A equals B” just
means the A and B are two different names for the same mathematical object (which could

4
1. Euclid
be a number, an angle, a triangle, a polynomial, or whatever). But Euclid uses the word
differently: when he says that two geometric objects are equal, he means essentially that
they have the same size. In modern terminology, when Euclid says two angles are equal,
we would say they have the same degree measure; when he says two lines (i.e., line seg-
ments) are equal, we would say they have the same length; and when he says two ﬁgures
such as triangles or parallelograms are equal, we would say they have the same area. Thus
Postulate 4 is actually asserting that all right angles are the same size.
It is important to understand why Postulate 4 is needed. Euclid’s deﬁnition of a right
angle applies only to an angle that appears in a certain conﬁguration (one of the two ad-
jacent angles formed when a straight line meets another straight line in such a way as to
make equal adjacent angles); it does not allow us to conclude that a right angle appearing
in one part of the plane bears any necessary relationship with right angles appearing else-
where. Thus Postulate 4 can be thought of as an assertion of a certain type of “uniformity”
in the plane: right angles have the same size wherever they appear.
Postulate 5 says, in more modern terms, that if one straight line crosses two other
straight lines in such a way that the interior angles on one side have degree measures adding
up to less than 180ı (“less than two right angles”), then those two straight lines must meet
on that same side of the ﬁrst line (Fig. 1.2). Intuitively, it says that if two lines start out
?

“pointing toward each other,” they will eventually meet. Because it is used primarily to
prove properties of parallel lines (for example, in Proposition I.29 to prove that parallel
lines always make equal corresponding angles with a transversal), Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate
is often called the “parallel postulate.” We will have much more to say about it later in this
chapter.
Common Notions
Following his ﬁve postulates, Euclid states ﬁve “common notions,” which are also
meant to be self-evident facts that are to be accepted without proof:
 Common Notion 1: Things which are equal to the same thing are also equal to one
another.
 Common Notion 2: If equals be added to equals, the wholes are equal.
 Common Notion 3: If equals be subtracted from equals, the remainders are equal.
 Common Notion 4: Things which coincide with one another are equal to one an-
other.
 Common Notion 5: The whole is greater than the part.

Whereas the ﬁve postulates express facts about geometric conﬁgurations, the common
notions express facts about magnitudes. For Euclid, magnitudes are objects that can be
compared, added, and subtracted, provided they are of the “same kind.” In Book I, the
kinds of magnitudes that Euclid considers are (lengths of) line segments, (measures of)
angles, and (areas of) triangles and quadrilaterals. For example, a line segment (which
Euclid calls a “ﬁnite straight line”) can be equal to, greater than, or less than another line
segment; two line segments can be added together to form a longer line segment; and a
shorter line segment can be subtracted from a longer one.
It is interesting to observe that although Euclid compares, adds, and subtracts geomet-
ric magnitudes of the same kind, he never uses numbers to measure geometric magnitudes.
This might strike one as curious, because human societies had been using numbers to mea-
sure things since prehistoric times. But there is a simple explanation for its omission from
Euclid’s axiomatic treatment of geometry: to the ancient Greeks, numbers meant whole
numbers, or at best ratios of whole numbers (what we now call rational numbers). How-
ever, the followers of Pythagoras had discovered long before Euclid that the relationship
between the diagonal of a square and its side length cannot be expressed as a ratio of whole
numbers. In modern terms, we would say that the ratio of the length of the diagonal of a
square to its side length is equal to
p
2; but there is no rational number whose square is 2.
Here is a proof that this is so.
Theorem 1.1 (Irrationality of
p
2). There is no rational number whose square is 2.
Proof. Assume the contrary: that is, assume that there are integers p and q with q ¤ 0
such that 2 D .p=q/2. After canceling out common factors, we can assume that p=q is
in lowest terms, meaning that p and q have no common prime factors. Multiplying the
equation through by q2, we obtain
2q2 D p2:
(1.1)
Because p2 is equal to the even number 2q2, it follows that p itself is even; thus there is
some integer k such that p D 2k. Inserting this into (1.1) yields
2q2 D .2k/2 D 4k2:
We can divide this equation through by 2 and obtain q2 D 2k2, which shows that q is
also even. But this means that p and q have 2 as a common prime factor, contradicting
our assumption that p=q is in lowest terms. Thus our original assumption must have been
false.
□
This is one of the oldest examples of what we now call a proof by contradiction or
indirect proof, in which we assume that a result is false and show that this assumption
leads to a contradiction. A version of this argument appears in the Elements as Proposition
VIII.8 (although it is a bit hard to recognize as such because of the archaic terminology
Euclid used). For a more thorough discussion of proofs by contradiction, see Appendix F.
For details of the properties of numbers that were used in the proof, see Appendix H.
This fact had the consequence that, for the Greeks, there was no “number” that could
represent the length of the diagonal of a square whose sides have length 1. Thus it was not
possible to assign a numeric length to every line segment.
Euclid’s way around this difﬁculty was simply to avoid using numbers to measure
magnitudes. Instead, he only compares, adds, and subtracts magnitudes of the same kind.

6
1. Euclid
(In later books, he also compares ratios of such magnitudes.) As mentioned above, it is
clear from Euclid’s use of the word “equal” that he always interprets it to mean “the same
size”; any claim that two geometric ﬁgures are equal is ultimately justiﬁed by showing
that one can be moved so that it coincides with the other or that the two objects can be
decomposed into pieces that are equal for the same reason. His use of the phrases “greater
than” and “less than” is always based on Common Notion 5: if one geometric object (such
as a line segment or an angle) is part of another or is equal (in size) to part of another, then
the ﬁrst is less than the second.
Having laid out his deﬁnitions and assumptions, Euclid is now ready to start proving
things.
Propositions
Euclid refers to every mathematical statement that he proves as a proposition. This is
somewhat different from the usual practice in modern mathematical writing, where a result
to be proved might be called a theorem (an important result, usually one that requires a
relatively lengthy or difﬁcult proof); a proposition (an interesting result that requires proof
but is usually not important enough to be called a theorem); a corollary (an interesting
result that follows from a previous theorem with little or no extra effort); or a lemma (a
preliminary result that is not particularly interesting in its own right but is needed to prove
another theorem or proposition).
Even though Euclid’s results are all called propositions, the ﬁrst thing one notices
when looking through them is that, like the postulates, they are of two distinct types. Some
propositions (such as I.1, I.2, and I.3) describe constructions of certain geometric conﬁg-
urations. (Traditionally, scholars of Euclid call these propositions problems. For clarity,
we will call them construction problems.) These are usually stated in the inﬁnitive (“to
construct an equilateral triangle on a given ﬁnite straight line”), but like the ﬁrst three
postulates, they should be read as asserting the possibility of making the indicated con-
structions: “[It is possible] to construct an equilateral triangle on a given ﬁnite straight
line.”
Other propositions (traditionally called theorems) assert that certain relationships al-
ways hold in geometric conﬁgurations of a given type. Some examples are Propositions I.4
(the side-angle-side congruence theorem) and I.5 (the base angles of an isosceles triangle
are equal). They do not assert the constructibility of anything. Instead, they apply only
when a conﬁguration of the given type has already been constructed, and they allow us to
conclude that certain relationships always hold in that situation.
For both the construction problems and the theorems, Euclid’s propositions and proofs
follow a predictable pattern. Most propositions have six discernible parts. Here is how the
parts were described by the Greek mathematician Proclus [Pro70]:
(1) Enunciation: Stating in general form the construction problem to be solved or the
theorem to be proved. Example from Proposition I.1: “On a given ﬁnite straight line
to construct an equilateral triangle.”
(2) Setting out: Choosing a speciﬁc (but arbitrary) instance of the general situation and
giving names to its constituent points and lines. Example: “Let AB be the given ﬁnite
straight line.”

Reading Euclid
7
(3) Speciﬁcation: Announcing what has to be constructed or proved in this speciﬁc in-
stance. Example: “Thus it is required to construct an equilateral triangle on the
straight line AB.”
(4) Construction: Adding points, lines, and circles as needed. For construction prob-
lems, this is where the main construction algorithm is described. For theorems, this
part, if present, describes any auxiliary objects that need to be added to the ﬁgure to
complete the proof; if none are needed, it might be omitted.
(5) Proof: Arguing logically that the given construction does indeed solve the given
problem or that the given relationships do indeed hold.
(6) Conclusion: Restating what has been proved.
A word about the conclusions of Euclid’s proofs is in order. Euclid and the classical
mathematicians who followed him believed that a proof was not complete unless it ended
with a precise statement of what had been shown to be true. For construction problems,
this statement always ended with a phrase meaning “which was to be done” (translated
into Latin as quod erat faciendum, or q.e.f.). For theorems, it ended with “which was
to be demonstrated” (quod erat demonstrandum, or q.e.d.), which explains the origin of
our traditional proof-ending abbreviation. In Heath’s translation of Proposition I.1, the
conclusion reads “Therefore the triangle ABC is equilateral; and it has been constructed
on the given ﬁnite straight line AB. Being what it was required to do.” Because this last
step is so formulaic, after the ﬁrst few propositions Heath abbreviates it: “Therefore etc.
q.e.f.,” or “Therefore etc. q.e.d.”
We leave it to you to read Euclid’s propositions in detail, but it is worth focusing
brieﬂy on the ﬁrst three because they tell us something important about Euclid’s conception
of straightedge and compass constructions. Here are the statements of Euclid’s ﬁrst three
propositions:
Euclid’s Proposition I.1. On a given ﬁnite straight line to construct an equilateral trian-
gle.
Euclid’s Proposition I.2. To place a straight line equal to a given straight line with one
end at a given point.
Euclid’s Proposition I.3. Given two unequal straight lines, to cut off from the greater a
straight line equal to the less.
One might well wonder why Euclid chose to start where he did. The construction of
an equilateral triangle is undoubtedly useful, but is it really more useful than other funda-
mental constructions such as bisecting an angle, bisecting a line segment, or constructing
a perpendicular? The second proposition is even more perplexing: all it allows us to do is
to construct a copy of a given line segment with one end at a certain predetermined point,
but we have no control over which direction the line segment points. Why should this be
of any use whatsoever?
The mystery is solved by the third proposition. If you look closely at the way Postulate
3 is used in the ﬁrst two propositions, it becomes clear that Euclid has a very speciﬁc inter-
pretation in mind when he writes about “describing a circle with any center and distance.”
In Proposition I.1, he describes the circle with center A and distance AB and the circle with
center B and distance BA; and in Proposition I.2, he describes circles with center B and
distance BC and with center D and distance DG. In every case, the center is a point that

8
1. Euclid
has already been located, and the “distance” is actually a segment that has already been
drawn with the given center as one of its endpoints. Nowhere in these two propositions
does he describe what we routinely do with a physical compass: open the compass to the
length of a given line segment and then pick it up and draw a circle with that radius some-
where else. Traditionally, this restriction is expressed by saying that Euclid’s hypothetical
compass is a “collapsing compass”—as soon as you pick it up off the page, it collapses, so
you cannot put it down and reproduce the same radius somewhere else.
The purpose of Proposition I.3 is precisely to simulate a noncollapsing compass. After
Proposition I.3 is proved, if you have a point O that you want to be the center of a circle
and a segment AB somewhere else whose length you want to use for the radius, you can
draw a segment from O to some other point E (Postulate 1), extend it if necessary so that
it’s longer than AB (Postulate 2), use Proposition I.3 to locate C on that extended segment
so that OC D AB, and then draw the circle with center O and radius OC (Postulate 3).
Obviously, the Greeks must have known how to make compasses that held their sep-
aration when picked up, so it is interesting to speculate about why Euclid’s postulate de-
scribed only a collapsing compass. It is easy to imagine that an early draft of the Elements
might have contained a stronger version of Postulate 3 that allowed a noncollapsing com-
pass, and then Euclid discovered that by using the constructions embodied in the ﬁrst three
propositions he could get away with a weaker postulate. If so, he was probably very proud
of himself (and rightly so).
After Euclid
Euclid’s Elements became the universal geometry textbook, studied by most educated
Westerners for two thousand years. Even so, beginning already in ancient times, schol-
ars worked hard to improve upon Euclid’s treatment of geometry.
The focus of attention for most of those two thousand years was Euclid’s ﬁfth pos-
tulate, which usually strikes people as being the most problematic of the ﬁve. Whereas
Postulates 1 through 4 express possibilities and properties that are truly self-evident to
anyone who has thought about our everyday experience with geometric relationships, Pos-
tulate 5 is of a different order altogether. Most noticeably, its statement is dramatically
longer than those of the other four postulates. More importantly, it expresses an assump-
tion about geometric conﬁgurations that cannot fairly be said to be self-evident in the same
way as the other four postulates. Although it is certainly plausible to expect that two lines
that start out pointing toward each other will eventually meet, it stretches credulity to ar-
gue that this conclusion is self-evident. If the sum of the two interior angle measures in
Fig. 1.2 were, say, 179:999999999999999999999999998ı, then the point where the two
lines intersect would be farther away than the most distant known galaxies in the universe!
Can anyone really say that the existence of such an intersection point is self-evident? The
ﬁfth postulate has the appearance of something that ought to be proved instead of being
accepted as a postulate.
There is reason to believe that Euclid himself was less than fully comfortable with his
ﬁfth postulate: he did not invoke it in any proofs until Proposition I.29, even though some
of the earlier proofs could have been simpliﬁed by using it.
For centuries, mathematicians who studied Euclid considered the ﬁfth postulate to be
the weakest link in Euclid’s tightly argued chain of reasoning. Many mathematicians tried

After Euclid
9
and failed to come up with proofs that the ﬁfth postulate follows logically from the other
four, or at least to replace it with a more truly self-evident postulate. This quest, in fact,
has motivated much of the development of geometry since Euclid.
The earliest attempt to prove the ﬁfth postulate that has survived to modern times was
by Proclus (412–485 CE), a Greek philosopher and mathematician who lived in Asia Mi-
nor during the time of the early Byzantine empire and wrote an important commentary
on Euclid’s Elements [Pro70]. (This commentary, by the way, contains most of the scant
biographical information we have about Euclid, and even this must be considered essen-
tially as legendary because it was written at least 700 years after the time of Euclid.) In
this commentary, Proclus opined that Postulate 5 did not have the self-evident nature of a
postulate and thus should be proved, and then he proceeded to offer a proof of it. Unfortu-
nately, like so many later attempts, Proclus’s proof was based on an unstated and unproved
assumption. Although Euclid deﬁned parallel lines to be lines in the same plane that do not
meet, no matter how far they are extended, Proclus tacitly assumed also that parallel lines
are everywhere equidistant, meaning the same distance apart (see Fig. 1.3). We will see in
Chapter 17 that this assumption is actually equivalent to assuming Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate.
Fig. 1.3. Proclus’s assumption.
After the fall of the Roman Empire, the study of geometry moved for the most part
to the Islamic world. Although the original Greek text of Euclid’s Elements was lost until
the Renaissance, translations into Arabic were widely studied throughout the Islamic em-
pire and eventually made their way back to Europe to be translated into Latin and other
languages.
During the years 1000–1300, several important Islamic mathematicians took up the
study of the ﬁfth postulate. Most notable among them was the Persian scholar and poet
Omar Khayyam (1048–1123), who criticized previous attempts to prove the ﬁfth postulate
and then offered a proof of his own. His proof was incorrect because, like that of Proclus,
it relied on the unproved assumption that parallel lines are everywhere equidistant.
With the advent of the Renaissance, Western Europeans again began to tackle the
problem of the ﬁfth postulate. One of the most important attempts was made by the Italian
mathematician Giovanni Saccheri (1667–1733). Saccheri set out to prove the ﬁfth postulate
by assuming that it was false and showing that this assumption led to a contradiction. His
arguments were carefully constructed and quite rigorous for their day. In the process, he
proved a great many strange and counterintuitive theorems that follow from the assumption
that the ﬁfth postulate is false, such as that rectangles cannot exist and that the interior angle
measures of triangles always add up to less than 180ı. In the end, though, he could not ﬁnd
a contradiction that measured up to the standards of rigor he had set for himself. Instead,
he punted: having shown that his assumption implied that there must exist parallel lines
that approach closer and closer to each other but never meet, he claimed that this result is
“repugnant to the nature of the straight line” and therefore his original assumption must
have been false.

10
1. Euclid
Saccheri is remembered today, not for his failed attempt to prove Euclid’s ﬁfth pos-
tulate, but because in attempting to do so he managed to prove a great many results that
we now recognize as theorems in a mysterious new system of geometry that we now call
non-Euclidean geometry. Because of the preconceptions built into the cultural context
within which he worked, he could only see them as steps along the way to his hoped-for
contradiction, which never came.
The next participant in our story played a minor role, but a memorable one. In 1795,
the Scottish mathematician John Playfair (1748–1819) published an edition of the ﬁrst six
books of Euclid’s Elements [Pla95], which he had edited to correct some of what were then
perceived as ﬂaws in the original. One of Playfair’s modiﬁcations was to replace Euclid’s
ﬁfth postulate with the following alternative postulate.
Playfair’s Postulate. Two straight lines cannot be drawn through the same point, parallel
to the same straight line, without coinciding with one another.
In other words, given a line and a point not on that line, there can be at most one line
through the given point and parallel to the given line. Playfair showed that this alternative
postulate leads to the same conclusions as Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate. This postulate has a no-
table advantage over Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate, because it focuses attention on the uniqueness
of parallel lines, which (as later generations were to learn) is the crux of the issue. Most
modern treatments of Euclidean geometry incorporate some version of Playfair’s postulate
instead of the ﬁfth postulate originally stated by Euclid.
The Discovery of Non-Euclidean Geometry
The next event in the history of geometry was the most profound development in mathe-
matics since the time of Euclid. In the 1820s, a revolutionary idea occurred independently
and more or less simultaneously to three different mathematicians: perhaps the reason the
ﬁfth postulate had turned out to be so hard to prove was that there is a completely consistent
theory of geometry in which Euclid’s ﬁrst four postulates are true but the ﬁfth postulate is
false. If this speculation turned out to be justiﬁed, it would mean that proving the ﬁfth
postulate from the other four would be a logical impossibility.
In 1829, the Russian mathematician Nikolai Lobachevsky (1792–1856) published a
paper laying out the foundations of what we now call non-Euclidean geometry, in which
the ﬁfth postulate is assumed to be false, and proving a good number of theorems about it.
Meanwhile in Hungary, J´anos Bolyai (1802–1860), the young son of an eminent Hungarian
mathematician, spent the years 1820–1823 writing a manuscript that accomplished much
the same thing; his paper was eventually published in 1832 as an appendix to a textbook
written by his father. When the great German mathematician Carl Friedrich Gauss (1777–
1855)—a friend of Bolyai’s father—read Bolyai’s paper, he remarked that it duplicated
investigations of his own that he had carried out privately but never published. Although
Bolyai and Lobachevsky deservedly received the credit for having invented non-Euclidean
geometry based on their published works, in view of the creativity and depth of Gauss’s
other contributions to mathematics, there is no reason to doubt that Gauss had indeed had
the same insight as Lobachevsky and Bolyai.
In a sense, the principal contribution of these mathematicians was more a change of
attitude than anything else: while Omar Khayyam, Giovanni Saccheri, and others had also

The Discovery of Non-Euclidean Geometry
11
proved theorems of non-Euclidean geometry, it was Lobachevsky and Bolyai (and pre-
sumably also Gauss) who ﬁrst recognized them as such. However, even after this ground-
breaking work, there was still no proof that non-Euclidean geometry was consistent (i.e.,
that it could never lead to a contradiction). The coup de grˆace for attempts to prove the
ﬁfth postulate was provided in 1868 by another Italian mathematician, Eugenio Beltrami
(1835–1900), who proved for the ﬁrst time that non-Euclidean geometry was just as con-
sistent as Euclidean geometry. Thus the ancient question of whether Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate
followed from the other four was ﬁnally settled.
The versions of non-Euclidean geometry studied by Lobachevsky, Bolyai, Gauss, and
Beltrami were all essentially equivalent to each other. This geometry is now called hyper-
bolic geometry. Its most salient feature is that Playfair’s postulate is false: in hyperbolic
geometry it is always possible for two or more distinct straight lines to be drawn through
the same point, both parallel to a given straight line. As a consequence, many aspects of
Euclid’s theory of parallel lines (such as the result in Proposition I.29 about the equality
of corresponding angles made by a transversal to two parallel lines) are not valid in hy-
perbolic geometry. In fact, as we will see in Chapter 19, the phenomenon of parallel lines
approaching each other asymptotically but never meeting—which Saccheri declared to be
“repugnant to the nature of the straight line”—does indeed occur in hyperbolic geometry.
One might also wonder if the Euclidean theory of parallel lines could fail in the op-
posite way: instead of having two or more parallels through the same point, might it be
possible to construct a consistent theory in which there are no parallels to a given line
through a given point? It is easy to imagine a type of geometry in which there are no par-
allel lines: the geometry of a sphere. If you move as straight as possible on the surface of
a sphere, you will follow a path known as a great circle—a circle whose center coincides
with the center of the sphere. It can be visualized as the place where the sphere intersects a
plane that passes through the center of the sphere. If we reinterpret the term “line” to mean
a great circle on the sphere, then indeed there are no parallel “lines,” because any two
great circles must intersect each other. But this does not seem to have much relevance for
Euclid’s geometry, because line segments cannot be extended arbitrarily far—in spherical
geometry, no line can be longer than the circumference of the sphere. This would seem to
contradict Postulate 2, which had always been interpreted to mean that a line segment can
be extended arbitrarily far in both directions.
However, after the discovery of hyperbolic geometry, another German mathematician,
Bernhard Riemann (1826–1866), realized that Euclid’s second postulate could be reinter-
preted in such a way that it does hold on the surface of a sphere. Basically, he argued that
Euclid’s second postulate only requires that any line segment can be extended to a longer
one in both directions, but it does not speciﬁcally say that we can extend it to any length
we wish. With this reinterpretation, spherical geometry can be seen to be a consistent ge-
ometry in which no lines are parallel to each other. Of course, a number of Euclid’s proofs
break down in this situation, because many of the implicit geometric assumptions he used
in his proofs do not hold on the sphere; see our discussion of Euclid’s Proposition I.16 be-
low for an example. This alternative form of non-Euclidean geometry is sometimes called
elliptic geometry. (Because of its association with Riemann, it is sometimes erroneously
referred to as Riemannian geometry, but this term is now universally used to refer to an
entirely different type of geometry, which is a branch of differential geometry.)

12
1. Euclid
Perhaps the most convincing conﬁrmation that Euclid’s is not the only possible con-
sistent theory of geometry came from Einstein’s general theory of relativity around the turn
of the twentieth century. If we are to believe, like Euclid, that the postulates reﬂect self-
evident truths about the geometry of the world we live in, then Euclid’s statements about
“straight lines” should translate into true statements about the behavior of light rays in
the real world. (After all, we commonly judge the “straightness” of something by sighting
along it, so what physical phenomenon could possibly qualify as a better model of “straight
lines” than light rays?) Thus the closest thing in the physical world to a geometric triangle
would be a three-sided ﬁgure whose sides are formed by the paths of light rays.
Yet Einstein’s theory tells us that in the presence of gravitational ﬁelds, space itself is
“warped,” and this affects the paths along which light rays travel. One of the most dramatic
conﬁrmations of Einstein’s theory comes from the phenomenon known as gravitational
lensing: this occurs when we observe a distant object but there is a massive galaxy cluster
directly between us and the object. Einstein’s theory predicts that the light rays from the
distant object should be able to follow two (or more) different paths to reach our eyes
because of the distortion of space around the galaxy cluster.

This phenomenon has indeed been observed; Fig. 1.4 shows a photograph taken by the
Hubble Space Telescope, in which a distant loop-shaped galaxy (circled) appears twice in
the same photographic image because its light rays have traveled around both sides of the
large galaxy cluster in the middle of the photo. Fig. 1.5 shows a schematic view of the same

1. Euclid
The catch is that one must scrupulously ensure that the proofs of the theorems do not
use anything other than what has been assumed in the postulates. If the axioms represent
arbitrary assumptions instead of self-evident facts about the real world, then nothing except
the axioms is relevant to proofs within the system. Reasoning based on intuition about
the behavior of straight lines or properties that are evident from diagrams or common
experience in the real world will no longer be justiﬁable within the axiomatic system.
Looking back at Euclid with these newfound insights, mathematicians realized that
Euclid had used many properties of lines and circles that were not strictly justiﬁed by his
postulates. Let us examine a few of those properties, as a way of motivating the more
careful axiomatic system that we will develop later in the book. We will discuss some of
the most problematic of Euclid’s proofs in the order in which they occur in Book I. As
always, we refer to the edition [Euc02].
While reading these analyses of Euclid’s arguments, you should bear in mind that
we are judging the incompleteness of these proofs based on criteria that would have been
utterly irrelevant in Euclid’s time. For the ancient Greeks, geometric proofs were meant to
be convincing arguments about the geometry of the physical world, so basing geometric
conclusions on facts that were obvious from diagrams would never have struck them as
an invalid form of reasoning. Thus these observations should not be seen as criticisms
of Euclid; rather, they are meant to help point the way toward the development of a new
axiomatic system that lives up to our modern (post-Euclidean) conception of rigor.

Analysis.
In Euclid’s proof of this, his very ﬁrst proposition, he draws two circles, one
centered at each endpoint of the given line segment AB (see Fig. 1.6). (In geometric dia-
grams in this book, we will typically draw selected points as small black dots to emphasize
their locations; this is merely a convenience and is not meant to suggest that points take
up any area in the plane.) He then proceeds to mention “the point C, in which the circles
cut one another.” It seems obvious from the diagram that there is a point where the circles
intersect, but which of Euclid’s postulates justiﬁes the fact that such a point always exists?
Notice that Postulate 5 asserts the existence of point where two lines intersect under certain
circumstances; but nowhere does Euclid give us any justiﬁcation for asserting the existence
of a point where two circles intersect.
Euclid’s Proposition I.3. Given two unequal straight lines, to cut off from the greater a
straight line equal to the less.

Analysis. In his third proof, Euclid implicitly uses another unjustiﬁed property of circles,
although this one is a little more subtle. Starting with a line segment AD that he has just
constructed, which shares an endpoint with a longer line segment AB, he draws a circle
DEF with center A and passing through D (justiﬁed by Postulate 3). Although he does
not say so explicitly, it is evident from his drawing that he means for E to be a point that
is simultaneously on the circle DEF and also on the line segment AB. But once again,
there is nothing in his list of postulates (or in the two previously proved propositions) that
justiﬁes the claim that a circle must intersect a line. (The same unjustiﬁed step also occurs
twice in the proof of Proposition I.2, but it is a little easier to see in Proposition I.3.)
Euclid’s Proposition I.4. If two triangles have the two sides equal to two sides respec-
tively, and have the angles contained by the equal straight lines equal, they will also have
the base equal to the base, the triangle will be equal to the triangle, and the remaining
angles will be equal to the remaining angles respectively, namely those which the equal
sides subtend.

This is Euclid’s proof of the well-known side-angle-side congruence theorem
(SAS). He begins with two triangles, ABC and DEF , such that AB D DE, AC D DF ,
and angle BAC is equal to angle EDF . (For the time being, we are adopting Euclid’s
convention that “equal” means “the same size.”) He then says that triangle ABC should
be “applied to triangle DEF .” (Some revised translations use “superposed upon” or “su-
perimposed upon” in place of “applied to.”) The idea is that we should imagine triangle
ABC being moved over on top of triangle DEF in such a way that A lands on D and the
segment AB points in the same direction as DE, so that the moved-over copy of ABC
occupies the same position in the plane as DEF . (Although Euclid does not explicitly
mention it, he also evidently intends for C to be placed on the same side of the line DE as
F , to ensure that the moved-over copy of ABC will coincide with DEF instead of being
a mirror image of it.) This technique has become known as the method of superposition.

16
1. Euclid
This is an intuitively appealing argument, because we have all had the experience
of moving cutouts of geometric ﬁgures around to make them coincide. However, there
is nothing in Euclid’s postulates that justiﬁes the claim that a geometric ﬁgure can be
moved, much less that its geometric properties such as side lengths and angle measures
will remain unchanged after the move. Of course, Propositions I.2 and I.3 describe ways of
constructing “copies” of line segments at other positions in the plane, but they say nothing
about copying angles or triangles. (In fact, he does prove later, in Proposition I.23, that it
is possible to construct a copy of an angle at a different location; but that proof depends on
Proposition I.4!)
This is one of the most serious gaps in Euclid’s proofs. In fact, many scholars have
inferred that Euclid himself was uncomfortable with the method of superposition, because
he used it in only three proofs in the entire thirteen books of the Elements (Propositions I.4,
I.8, and III.23), despite the fact that he could have simpliﬁed many other proofs by using
it.
There is another important gap in Euclid’s reasoning in this proof: having argued that
triangle ABC can be moved so that A coincides with D, B coincides with E, and C
coincides with F , he then concludes that the line segments BC and EF will also coincide
and hence be equal (in size). Now, Postulate 1 says that it is possible to construct a straight
line (segment) from any point to any other point, but it does not say that it is possible
to construct only one such line segment. Thus the postulates provide no justiﬁcation for
concluding that the segments BC and EF will necessarily coincide, even though they have
the same endpoints. Euclid evidently meant the reader to understand that there is a unique
line segment from one point to another point. In a modern axiomatic system, this would
have to be stated explicitly.

In the proof of this proposition, Euclid uses another subtle property of inter-
sections that is not justiﬁed by the postulates. Given a line segment AB, he constructs an
equilateral triangle ABC with AB as one of its sides (which is justiﬁed by Proposition I.1)
and then constructs the bisector of angle ACB (justiﬁed by Proposition I.9, which he has
just proved). So far, so good. But his diagram shows the angle bisector intersecting the
segment AB at a point D, and he proceeds to prove that AB is bisected (or cut in half)
at this very point D. Once again, there is nothing in the postulates that justiﬁes Euclid’s
assertion that there must be such an intersection point.

uses Proposition I.3 to choose a point F on that line such that EF is the same length as
BE. Here is where the ﬁrst problem arises: although Postulate 3 guarantees that a line
segment can be extended to form a longer line segment containing the original one, it does
not explicitly say that we can make the extended line segment as long as we wish. As we
mentioned above, if we were working on the surface of a sphere, this might not be possible
because great circles have a built-in maximum length.
The second problem arises toward the end of the proof, when Euclid claims that angle
ECD is greater than angle ECF . This is supposed to be justiﬁed by Common Notion 5
(the whole is greater than the part). However, in order to claim that angle ECF is “part of”
angle ECD, we need to know that F lies in the interior of angle ECD. This seems evident
from the diagram, but once again, there is nothing in the axioms or previous propositions
that justiﬁes the claim. To see how this could fail, consider once again the surface of a
sphere. In Fig. 1.12, we have illustrated an analogous conﬁguration, with A at the north
pole and B and C both on the equator. If B and C are far enough apart, it is entirely
possible for the point F to end up south of the equator, in which case it is no longer in
the interior of angle ECD. (Fig. 1.13 illustrates the same conﬁguration after it has been
“unwrapped” onto a plane.)

Some of these objections to Euclid’s arguments might seem to be of little practical
consequence, because, after all, nobody questions the truth of the theorems he proved.
However, if one makes a practice of relying on relationships that seem obvious in diagrams,
it is possible to go wildly astray. We end this section by presenting a famous fallacious
“proof” of a false “theorem,” which vividly illustrates the danger.
The argument below is every bit as rigorous as Euclid’s proofs, with each step justi-
ﬁed by Euclid’s postulates, common notions, or propositions; and yet the theorem being
proved is one that everybody knows to be false. This proof was ﬁrst published in 1892 in a
recreational mathematics book by W. W. Rouse Ball [Bal87, p. 48]. Exercise 1D asks you
to identify the incorrect step(s) in the proof.
Fake Theorem. Every triangle has at least two equal sides.
Fake Proof. Let ABC be any triangle, and let AD be the bisector of angle A (Proposition
I.9). We consider several cases.
Suppose ﬁrst that when AD is extended (Postulate 2), it meets BC perpendicularly.
Let O be the point where these segments meet (Fig. 1.14(a)). Then angles AOB and
AOC are both right angles by deﬁnition of “perpendicular.” Thus the triangles AOB and

AOC have two pairs of equal angles and share the common side AO, so it follows from
Proposition I.26 that the sides AB and AC are equal.
In all of the remaining cases, we assume that the extension of AD is not perpendicular
to BC. Let BC be bisected at M (Proposition I.10), let ` be the line perpendicular to BC
at M (Proposition I.11), and let AD be extended if necessary (Postulate 2) so that it meets
` at O. There are now three possible cases, depending on the location of O.
CASE 1: O lies inside triangle ABC (Fig. 1.14(b)). Draw BO and CO (Postulate
1). Note that the triangles BMO and CMO have two pairs of equal corresponding sides
(MO is common and BM D CM), and the included angles BMO and CMO are both
right, so the remaining sides BO and CO are also equal by Proposition I.4. Now draw
OF perpendicular to AB and OG perpendicular to AC (Proposition I.12). Then triangles
AFO and AGO have two pairs of equal corresponding angles and share the side AO,
so Proposition I.26 implies that their remaining pairs of corresponding sides are equal:
AF D AG and FO D GO. Now we can conclude that BFO and CGO are both right
triangles in which the hypotenuses BO and CO are equal and the legs FO and GO are
also equal. Therefore, the Pythagorean theorem (Proposition I.47) together with Common

20
1. Euclid
Notion 3 implies that the squares on the remaining legs FB and GC are equal, and thus
the legs themselves are also equal. Thus we have shown AF D AG and FB D GC, so by
Common Notion 2, it follows that AB D AC.
CASE 2: O lies on BC (Fig. 1.14(c)). Then O must be the point where BC is
bisected, because that is where ` meets BC. In this case, we argue exactly as in Case
1, except that we can skip the ﬁrst step involving triangles BMO and CMO, because
we already know that BO D OC (because BC is bisected at O). The rest of the proof
proceeds exactly as before to yield the conclusion that AB D AC.
CASE 3: O lies outside triangle ABC (Fig. 1.14(d)). Again, the proof proceeds
exactly as in Case 1, except now there are two changes: ﬁrst, before drawing OF and OG,
we need to extend AB beyond B, extend AC beyond C (Postulate 2), and draw OF and
OG perpendicular to the extended line segments (Proposition I.12). Second, in the very
last step, having shown that AF D AG and FB D GC, we now use Common Notion 3
instead of Common Notion 2 to conclude that AB D AC.

Modern Axiom Systems
We have seen that the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry made it necessary to rethink
the foundations of geometry, even Euclidean geometry. In 1899, these efforts culminated in
the development by the German mathematician David Hilbert (1862–1943) of the ﬁrst set
of postulates for Euclidean geometry that were sufﬁcient (according to modern standards of
rigor) to prove all of the propositions in the Elements. (One version of Hilbert’s axioms is
reproduced in Appendix A.) Following the tradition established by Euclid, Hilbert did not
refer to numbers or measurements in his axiom system. In fact, he did not even to refer to
comparisons such as “greater than” or “less than”; instead, he introduced new relationships
called congruent and between and added a number of axioms that specify their properties.
For example, two line segments are to be thought of as congruent to each other if they have
the same length (Euclid would say they are “equal”); and a point B is to be thought of as
between A and C if B is an interior point of the segment AC (Euclid would say “AB is
part of AC”). But these intuitive ideas were only the motivations for the choice of terms;
the only facts about these terms that could legitimately be used in proofs were the facts
stated explicitly in the axioms, such as Hilbert’s Axiom II.3: Of any three points on a line
there exists no more than one that lies between the other two.
Although Hilbert’s axioms effectively ﬁlled in all of the unstated assumptions in Eu-
clid’s arguments, they had a distinct disadvantage in comparison with Euclid’s postulates:
Hilbert’s list of axioms was long and complicated and seemed to have lost the elegant
simplicity of Euclid’s short list of assumptions. One reason for this complexity was the ne-
cessity of spelling out all the properties of betweenness and congruence that were needed
to justify all of Euclid’s assertions regarding comparisons of magnitudes.
In 1932, the American mathematician George D. Birkhoff published a completely
different set of axioms for plane geometry using real numbers to measure sizes of line
segments and angles. The theoretical foundations of the real numbers had by then been
solidly established, and Birkhoff reasoned that since numerical measurements are used
ubiquitously in practical applications of geometry (as embodied in the ruler and protractor),
there was no longer any good reason to exclude them from the axiomatic foundations of

geometry. Using these ideas, he was able to replace Hilbert’s long list by only four axioms
(see Appendix B).
Once Birkhoff’s suggestion started to sink in, high-school text writers soon came
around. Beginning with a textbook coauthored by Birkhoff himself [BB41], many high-
school geometry texts were published in the U.S. that adopted axiom systems based more
or less on Birkhoff’s axioms. In the 1960s, the School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG),
a committee sponsored by the U.S. National Science Foundation, developed an inﬂuen-
tial system of axioms for high-school courses that used the real numbers in the way that
Birkhoff had proposed (see Appendix C). The use of numbers for measuring lengths and
angles was embodied in two axioms that the SMSG authors called the ruler postulate and
the angle measurement postulate. In one way or another, the SMSG axioms form the basis
for the axiomatic systems used in most high-school geometry texts today. The axioms that
will be used in this book are inspired by the SMSG axioms, although they have been modi-
ﬁed in various ways: some of the redundant axioms have been eliminated, and some of the
others have been rephrased to more closely capture our intuitions about plane geometry.
This concludes our brief survey of the historical events leading to the development
of the modern axiomatic method. For a detailed and engaging account of the history of
geometry from Euclid to the twentieth century, the book [Gre08] is highly recommended.

six parts: enunciation, setting out, speciﬁcation, construction, proof, and conclusion.
1C. Choose several of the propositions in Book I of the Elements, and rewrite the statement
and proof of each in more modern, idiomatic English. (You are not being asked to
change the proofs or to ﬁll in any of the gaps; all you need to do is rephrase Euclid’s
proofs to make them more understandable to modern readers.) When you do your
rewriting, consider the following:
 Be sure to include diagrams, and consider adding additional diagrams if they
would help the reader follow the arguments.
 Many terms are used by Euclid without explanation, so make sure you know what
he means by them. The following terms, for example, are used frequently by
Euclid but seldom in modern mathematical writing, so once you understand what
they mean, you should consider replacing them by more commonly understood
terms:
– a ﬁnite straight line,
– to produce a ﬁnite straight line,
– to describe a circle,
– to apply or superpose a ﬁgure onto another,
– the base and sides of an arbitrary triangle,
– one angle or side is much greater than another,
– a straight line standing on a straight line,
– an angle subtended by a side of a triangle.

 In addition, the following terms that Euclid uses without explanation are also used
by modern writers, so you don’t necessarily need to change them; but make sure
that you know what they mean and that the meanings will be clear to your readers:
– the base of an isosceles triangle,
– to bisect a line segment or an angle,
– vertical angles,
– adjacent angles,
– exterior angles,
– interior angles.
 Euclid sometimes writes “I say that [something is true],” which is a phrase you
will seldom ﬁnd in modern mathematical writing. When you see this phrase in
Euclid, think about how it ﬁts into the logic of his proof. Is he saying this is a
statement that follows from what he has already proved? Or a statement that he
thinks is obvious and does not need proof? Or a statement that he claims to be true
but has not proved yet? Or something else? How might a modern mathematician
express this?
 Finally, after you have rewritten each proof, write a short discussion of the main
features of the proof, and try to answer these questions: Why did Euclid construct
the proof as he did? Were there any steps that seemed superﬂuous to you? Were
there any steps or justiﬁcations that he left out? Why did this proposition appear
at this particular place in the Elements? What would have been the consequences
of trying to prove it earlier or later?
1D. Identify the fallacy that invalidates the proof of the “fake theorem” that says every
triangle has two equal sides, and justify your analysis by carefully drawing an example
of a nonisosceles triangle in which that step is actually false. [Hint: The problem has
to do with drawing conclusions from the diagrams about locations of points. It’s not
enough just to ﬁnd a step that is not adequately justiﬁed by the axioms; you must ﬁnd
a step that is actually false.]

congruence criteria (SAS, ASA, AAS).
(b) Do the homework exercises in the chapter that introduces triangle congruence
criteria.
(c) Explain whether the axioms used in the book ﬁll in some or all of the gaps in

Chapter 2
Incidence Geometry
Motivated by the advances described in the previous chapter, mathematicians since the
early twentieth century have always proved theorems using a modern version of the ax-
iomatic method. The purpose of this chapter is to describe this method and give an example
of how it works.
Axiomatic Systems
The ﬁrst important realization, due to Hilbert, is that it is impossible to precisely deﬁne
every mathematical term that will be used in a given ﬁeld. As we saw in Chapter 1, Eu-
clid attempted to give descriptive deﬁnitions of words like point, straight line, etc. But
those deﬁnitions were not sufﬁciently precise to be used to justify steps in proofs. Hilbert’s
insight was that from the point of view of mathematical logic, such deﬁnitions have no
meaning. So, instead, he proposed to eliminate them from the formal mathematical de-
velopment and simply to leave some terms ofﬁcially undeﬁned. Such terms are called
primitive terms—they are given no formal mathematical deﬁnitions, but, instead, all of
their relevant properties are expressed in the axioms. In Hilbert’s axiomatic system, for
example, the primitive terms are point, line, plane, lies on, between, and congruent.
Here, then, is the type of system we will be considering. An axiomatic system consists
of the following elements:
 primitive terms (also called undeﬁned terms): technical words that will be used in
the axioms without formal deﬁnitions;
 deﬁned terms: other technical terms that are given precise, unambiguous deﬁnitions
in terms of the primitive terms and other previously deﬁned terms;
 axioms (also called postulates): mathematical statements about the primitive and
deﬁned terms that will be assumed to be true without proof;
 theorems: mathematical statements about the primitive and deﬁned terms that can
be given rigorous proofs based only on the axioms, deﬁnitions, previously proved
theorems, and rules of logic.
23

24
2. Incidence Geometry
Each primitive term in an axiomatic system is usually declared to be one of several
grammatical types: an object, a relation, or a function.
 A primitive term representing an object serves as a noun in our mathematical gram-
mar. Some geometric examples are point and line.
 A primitive term representing a relation serves as a verb connecting two objects of
certain types, yielding a statement that is either true or false. A common geometric
example is lies on: it makes sense to say “a point lies on a line.”
 A primitive term representing a function serves as a sort of “operator” that can be
applied to one or more objects of certain types to produce objects of other types.
A common geometric example is distance, which can be applied to two points to
produce a number, so it makes sense to say “the distance from A to B is 3.”
The theorems in an axiomatic system might not all be labeled “theorems”—in a partic-
ular exposition of an axiomatic system, some of them might be titled propositions, corol-
laries, or lemmas, depending on their relationships with the other theorems of the system.
But logically speaking, there are no differences among the meanings of these terms; they
are all theorems of the axiomatic system.
The Axioms of Incidence Geometry
To illustrate how axiomatic systems work, we will create a “toy” axiomatic system that
contains some, but not all, of the features of plane geometry. (It is a genuine axiomatic
system; the word “toy” is meant to suggest that it axiomatizes only a very small part of
geometry, so we can learn a great deal by playing with this system before we dive into
a full-blown axiomatization of Euclidean geometry.) Because it describes how lines and
points meet each other, it is called incidence geometry. (The word incidence descends
from Latin roots meaning “falling upon.”)
Incidence geometry is based on Hilbert’s ﬁrst three axioms (I.1, I.2, and I.3 in Ap-
pendix A). It has three primitive terms: point, line, and lies on. Grammatically, “points”
and “lines” are the objects in our system, while “lies on” is a relation that might or might
not hold between a point and a line: if A is a point and ` is a line, then “A lies on `”
is a meaningful mathematical statement in our system; it is either true or false, but not
both. The meanings of the primitive terms are to be gleaned from the axioms, which we
will list below. Intuitively, you can think of points in the same way we thought of them
in Euclidean geometry—as indivisible locations in the plane, with no width or area—and
you can think of lines as straight one-dimensional ﬁgures with no width or depth; but these
descriptions are not part of the axiomatic system, and you have to be careful not to assume
or use any properties of points and lines other than those that are explicitly stated in the
axioms. Hilbert once remarked that one should be able to substitute any other words for
the primitive terms in an axiomatic system—such as “tables,” “chairs,” and “beer mugs” in
place of “points,” “lines,” and “planes”—without changing the validity of any of the proofs
in the system.
In addition to the primitive terms, we deﬁne the following terms:
 For a line ` and a point A, we say that ` contains A if A lies on `.
 Two lines are said to intersect or to meet if there is a point that lies on both lines.

The Axioms of Incidence Geometry
25
 Two lines are parallel if they do not intersect.
 A collection of points is collinear if there is a line that contains them all.
The preﬁx “non” attached to the name of any property negates that property—for example,
to say that three points are noncollinear is to say that it is not true that they are collinear,
or equivalently that there is no line that contains them all.
In addition, we will use the terms of mathematical logic with their usual meanings.
See Appendix E for a summary of the terminology and conventions of mathematical logic.
Note that in modern mathematics (in contrast to Euclid’s Elements), to say that two objects
are equal is to say that they are the same object, while to say two objects are distinct or
different is simply to say that they are not equal. When we say three or more objects are
distinct, it means that no two of them are equal. In general, a phrase like “A and B are
points” should not be taken to imply that they are distinct points unless explicitly stated. On
the other hand, a phrase like “at least two points” means two distinct points and possibly
more, while “exactly two points” means two distinct points, no more and no fewer. (We
will sometimes explicitly insert the word “distinct” in such phrases to ensure that there is
no ambiguity, but it is not strictly necessary.)
In our version of incidence geometry, there are four axioms:
 Incidence Axiom 1: There exist at least three distinct noncollinear points.
 Incidence Axiom 2: Given any two distinct points, there is at least one line that
contains both of them.
 Incidence Axiom 3: Given any two distinct points, there is at most one line that
contains both of them.
 Incidence Axiom 4: Given any line, there are at least two distinct points that lie on
it.
The second and third axioms could be combined into a single statement: given any two
distinct points, there is a unique line that contains both of them. But we have separated
the existence and uniqueness parts of the statement because they are easier to analyze this
way.
Because of Axioms 2 and 3, we can adopt the following notation: if A and B are any
two distinct points, we will use the notation
 !
AB to denote the unique line that contains
both A and B. If A and B are points that have already been introduced into the discussion,
this notation is meaningful only when we know that A and B are distinct; if they happen to
be the same point, there could be many different lines containing that point, so the notation
 !
AB would not have a deﬁnite meaning. If we say “
 !
AB is a line” or “let
 !
AB be a line”
without having previously introduced A and B, this should be understood as including the
assertion that A and B are not equal. Thus such a statement really means “A and B are
distinct points and
 !
AB is the unique line containing them.”
Because of the terms we have chosen—point, line, and lies on—you will probably ﬁnd
yourself visualizing points and lines as marks on paper, much as we did when studying
Euclid’s propositions. This is not necessarily a bad idea, because we have deliberately
chosen the terms to evoke familiar objects of geometric study. But you must develop the
habit of thinking critically about each statement to make sure that it is justiﬁed only by the

26
2. Incidence Geometry
axioms, deﬁnitions, and previously proved theorems. For example, here are two similar-
sounding statements about points and lines, both of which are true in the usual Euclidean
setting:
Statement I. Given any point, there are at least two distinct lines that contain it.
Statement II. Given any line, there are at least two distinct points that do not lie on it.
As we will see later in this chapter, Statement I can be proved from the axioms alone,
so it is a theorem of incidence geometry (see Theorem 2.42). However, Statement II cannot
be proved from the axioms (see Exercise 2D). The justiﬁcation for the latter claim depends
on some extremely useful tools for deepening our understanding of an axiomatic system:
interpretations and models.
Interpretations and Models of Incidence Geometry
In a certain sense, the theorems of an axiomatic system are not “about” anything; they
are just statements that follow logically from the axioms. But the real power of axiomatic
systems comes in part from the fact that they can actually tell us things about whole classes
of concrete mathematical systems. Here we describe how that works.
An interpretation of an axiomatic system is an assignment of a mathematical deﬁni-
tion for each of its primitive terms. Usually, our interpretations will be constructed in some
area of mathematics that we already understand, such as set theory or the real number sys-
tem. Although these other subjects are ultimately based on their own axiomatic systems,
we will simply take them as given for the purposes of constructing interpretations.
An interpretation of an axiomatic system is said to be a model if each of the axioms
is a true statement when the primitive terms are given the stated deﬁnitions. Typically, an
axiomatic system will have many different models. (The main exception is an axiomatic
system that is self-contradictory: for example, if we added a ﬁfth incidence axiom that said
no line contains two distinct points, then we would have a system that admitted no models.)
One source of the power of axiomatic systems is that any theorems we succeed in proving
in the axiomatic system become true statements about every model because they all follow
logically from the axioms, which are themselves true statements about every model.
Let us explore some models of incidence geometry. We start with a very simple one—
in fact, in a certain sense, it is the simplest possible model because every model must have
at least three points by Axiom 1.
Example 2.1 (The Three-Point Plane). In this interpretation, we deﬁne the term point
to mean any one of the numbers 1, 2, or 3; and we deﬁne the term line to mean any one
of the sets f1;2g, f1;3g, or f2;3g. (Here we are using a standard notation for sets: for
example, f1;2g is the set whose elements are 1 and 2 and nothing else. See Appendix G.)
We say a “point” lies on a “line” if that “point” (i.e., number) is one of the elements in that
“line” (i.e., set of two numbers). (In this example, we are placing quotation marks around
the primitive terms to emphasize that we have assigned arbitrary meanings to them, which
may have nothing to do with our ordinary understanding of the words.)
It is convenient to visualize the three-point plane by means of a diagram like that of
Fig. 2.1. In diagrams such as these, dots are meant to represent “points,” and line segments
are meant to represent “lines”; a “point lies on a line” if and only if the corresponding dot
touches the corresponding line segment. It is important to remember, however, that the

Interpretations and Models of Incidence Geometry
27
ofﬁcial deﬁnition of the interpretation is the description given above, in terms of numbers
and sets of numbers; the diagram is not the interpretation. In particular, looking at the
diagram, one might be led to believe that the “line” containing 1 and 2 also contains many
other “points” besides the two endpoints; but if you look back at the deﬁnition, you will
see that this is not the case: each “line” contains exactly two “points.” The line segments
in the drawing are there merely to remind us which sets of “points” constitute “lines.”

We will check that the three-point plane is a model for incidence geometry by showing
that each of the four incidence axioms is a true statement about this interpretation. Axiom
1 is true because 1, 2, and 3 are three “points” that are not all contained in any one “line,”
so they are noncollinear. To prove that Incidence Axiom 2 holds, we have to prove that
for each pair of distinct “points,” there is a “line” that contains them. In this case, we can
prove this by enumerating the possible pairs directly: the “points” 1 and 2 are contained in
the “line” f1;2g; the “points” 1 and 3 are contained in the “line” f1;3g; and the “points”
2 and 3 are contained in the “line” f2;3g. Axiom 3 holds because each of these pairs of
“points” is contained in only the indicated “line” and no other. Finally, to prove Axiom 4,
just note that each “line” contains exactly two “points” by deﬁnition.
//
In our proof that the three-point plane is a model, we carried out everything in gory
detail. As the models get more complicated, when we need to prove that the axioms hold by
enumeration, we will not bother to write out all possible lines and points; but you should be
able to see easily how it would be done in each case. (If it’s not obvious how to do so, you
should pick up your pencil and write down all the possibilities!) Also, from now on, after
we have given deﬁnitions for “point,” “line,” and “lies on” for a particular interpretation,
we will often dispense with the awkward quotation marks. Just remember that whenever
we use these terms in the context of an interpretation, they are to be understood as having
the meanings we assign them in that interpretation.
Here are some more models.
Example 2.2 (The n-Point Plane). The previous example can be generalized as follows.
For any integer n  3, we can construct an interpretation by deﬁning a point to be any one
of the numbers 1;2;3;:::;n; deﬁning a line to be any set containing exactly two of those
numbers; and deﬁning lies on to mean “is an element of ” as before. Fig. 2.2 illustrates this
interpretation when n D 4, and Fig. 2.3 illustrates it for n D 5.
Remember, in these pictures, the only “points” in the geometry are the ones indicated
by dots. In the illustration of the 5-point plane, some pairs of lines, such as f1;3g and
f2;4g, appear to cross; but in the interpretation those lines do not intersect because there is

no point that lies on both of them. Many other illustrations are possible—for example, Fig.
2.4 shows two other illustrations of the four-point plane. In one of these illustrations, the
“lines” are drawn as curves for convenience, but the corresponding sets of points are still
“lines” in the model. Although the three illustrations look very different, they all represent
exactly the same model because they have the same points, the same lines, and the same
“lies on” relation.

We can show that for each n  3, the n-point plane is a model of incidence geometry.
Because 1, 2, and 3 are noncollinear points, Axiom 1 is satisﬁed. For any pair of distinct
points i and j , the line fi;j g is the unique line that contains them, so Axioms 2 and 3 are
satisﬁed. Finally, Axiom 4 is satisﬁed because each line contains two distinct points by
deﬁnition.
//
Example 2.3 (The Fano Plane). In this interpretation, we deﬁne a point to be one of the
numbers 1;2;3;4;5;6;7 and a line to be one of the following sets:
f1;2;3g;
f3;4;5g;
f5;6;1g;
f1;7;4g;
f2;7;5g;
f3;7;6g;
f2;4;6g:
(See Fig. 2.5.) As before, lies on means “is an element of.” It is easy to check by enumer-
ation that the Fano plane satisﬁes all four axioms, so it is a model of incidence geometry.
(The veriﬁcation is not hard, but writing down all the details would take a while. If you are
not convinced that the axioms are all satisﬁed, check them!) Note that we have drawn the
“line” f2;4;6g as a circle for convenience, but it is still to be interpreted as a line in this
geometry, no different from any other line.
//
In all of the models we have introduced so far, “points” have been numbers and “lines”
have been sets of points. There is nothing about the axioms that requires this. Here is a
model that is not of this type.

Example 2.4 (The Amtrak Model). In this interpretation, we deﬁne point to mean any
one of the cities Seattle, Sacramento, or Chicago; and line to mean any one of the following
Amtrak passenger rail lines: the Coast Starlight, the Empire Builder, or the California
Zephyr. We deﬁne lies on to mean that the city is one of the stops on that rail line. The
route map of these lines is shown in Fig. 2.6. We leave it to the reader to check that this is
a model.

Fig. 2.6. The Amtrak model.
The Amtrak model has a lot in common with the three-point plane: both have exactly
three “points” and three “lines,” and each “line” contains exactly two “points.” In fact, in a
certain sense these two models are essentially the same, except for the names given to the
points and lines. To describe this relationship more precisely, we introduce the following
terminology: suppose we are given two models A and B of a given axiomatic system. An
isomorphism between the models is an assignment of one-to-one correspondences between
the primitive objects of each type in A and the objects of the same type in B in such a way
that all of the primitive relations and functions are preserved. For models of incidence
geometry, this means a one-to-one correspondence between the points of A and the points
of B and a one-to-one correspondence between the lines of A and the lines of B, with the
property that a given point of A lies on a given line of A if and only if the corresponding
point of B lies on the corresponding line of B. If such a correspondence exists, we say
the two models are isomorphic. This means they are “the same” in all of the features that
are relevant for this axiomatic system, but the names of the objects might be different. The

Amtrak model is isomorphic to the three-point plane under the correspondence
1 $ Seattle;
f1;2g $ Coast Starlight;
2 $ Sacramento;
f1;3g $ Empire Builder;
3 $ Chicago;
f2;3g $ California Zephyr:
None of the other models we have introduced so far are isomorphic to each other. If two
models have different numbers of points, they cannot be isomorphic because there cannot
be a one-to-one correspondence between their points. Other than the 3-point plane and the
Amtrak model, the only other two models we’ve seen that have the same number of points
are the Fano plane and the 7-point plane; for those, see Exercise 2E.
The variety of models we can construct is limited only by our imagination. Here is
another model that is isomorphic to the three-point plane; it illustrates again that lines do
not necessarily need to be sets of points.
Example 2.5 (The Three-Equation Model). Deﬁne point to mean any of the ordered
pairs .1;0/, .0;1/, or .1;1/; and line to mean any one of the following equations:
x D 1;
y D 1;
x Cy D 1:
(See Fig. 2.7.) We say that a point .a;b/ lies on a line if the equation is true when we
substitute x D a and y D b. Thus, for example, the point .1;0/ lies on the lines x D 1 and
x Cy D 1, but not on y D 1. You should convince yourself that this is indeed a model of
incidence geometry and that it is isomorphic to both the three-point plane and the Amtrak
model.
//

Some Nonmodels
Next, let us consider some interpretations that are not models.
Example 2.6 (One-Point Geometry). Here is a silly interpretation of incidence geometry:
we deﬁne point to mean the number 1 only; in this interpretation, there are no lines, and
so no point lies on any line. Axiom 1 is obviously false in this interpretation, so this is
not a model of incidence geometry. However, it is interesting to note that Axioms 2–
4 are actually all true. For example, because there are no lines, it is true that for every
line (all none of them!), there are at least two points that lie on it. The other axioms are
true for similar reasons. (These are examples of statements that are said to be “vacuously
true” because their hypotheses are never satisﬁed; see Appendix E for a discussion of such
statements.)
//

Some Nonmodels
31
Example 2.7 (The Three-Point Line). In this interpretation, we deﬁne point to mean any
one of the numbers 1, 2, or 3, line to mean only the set f1;2;3g, and lies on to mean “is
an element of ” (see Fig. 2.8). You can check that in this interpretation Axiom 1 is false,
but Axioms 2, 3, and 4 are all true; thus this interpretation is not a model of incidence
geometry.

For the rest of the interpretations in this section, we will leave it to you to ﬁgure out
why they are not models (see Exercise 2A).
Example 2.8 (Three-Ring Geometry). In this interpretation, a point is any one of the
numbers 1;2;3;4;5;6; a line is any one of the sets f1;2;5;6g, f2;3;4;6g, or f1;3;4;5g;
and lies on means “is an element of” (see Fig. 2.9).

Example 2.9 (One-Two Geometry). Here is yet another interpretation that has exactly
three points: a point is 1, 2, or 3; a line is any set consisting of exactly one or two points,
namely f1g, f2g, f3g, f1;2g, f1;3g, or f2;3g; and lies on means “is an element of” (see Fig.
2.10).
//
Example 2.10 (Square Geometry).
Deﬁne an interpretation of incidence geometry by
letting point mean any of the vertices of a square, line mean any of the sides of that square,
and lies on mean the point is one of the endpoints of the side (see Fig. 2.11).

2. Incidence Geometry
Consistency and Independence
The interpretations above serve to illustrate some important concepts regarding axiomatic
systems. An axiomatic system is said to be consistent if it is impossible to derive a contra-
diction from its axioms, and it is inconsistent if it is possible to derive such a contradiction.
For example, as we mentioned above, if we add the ﬁfth axiom no line contains two dis-
tinct points to the axioms of incidence geometry, we would obtain an inconsistent system
because the axioms immediately lead to a contradiction (in fact, the new axiom and Axiom
4 are already direct contradictions of one another).
It is usually not too hard to prove that a given axiom system is inconsistent: just show
how to derive a contradiction. On the other hand, it might be very difﬁcult to prove that
the system is consistent, because you would have to show that nobody, however clever,
will ever ﬁnd a way to derive a contradiction from its axioms. Fortunately, however, there
is a handy shortcut: if you can prove that an axiomatic system has a model, then no con-
tradiction can follow from the axioms, because any result that follows logically from the
axioms—including any potential contradiction—would have to be true in the model.
Of course, this argument depends on knowing that there is no contradiction in the
model. For that, we have to rely on the theoretical context in which the model is con-
structed. For example, the three-point plane is based on the elementary theory of ﬁnite sets.
Provided we are sure there can be no contradiction in that theory, then we can conclude
that incidence geometry is consistent. For that reason, one often says that demonstrating
the existence of a model proves relative consistency of an axiomatic system, with relation
to the system in which the model is constructed: provided the system we used to construct
the model is consistent, it follows that our axiomatic system is also consistent. Our con-
struction of the three-point plane proves that incidence geometry is consistent if set theory
is consistent. (Virtually all mathematicians believe that it is.) In the end, we have no way
to prove absolute consistency of any mathematical system, just as we have no way to prove
the absolute truth of any of the theorems of geometry; but if we are willing to accept on
faith the consistency of some simple theories, that often allows us to prove the consistency
of other more complicated theories by constructing models.
Closely related to consistency is the notion of independence of axioms. When we
construct an axiomatic system, we would like the list of axioms to be as short as possible—
it would be undesirable to assume more axioms than we actually need. For example, there
would be no reason to add a ﬁfth axiom to incidence geometry that said there exist at least
two distinct points because that statement is already provable from the other four. (In fact,
it is provable from Axiom 1 alone.)
Thus we make the following deﬁnition: given an axiomatic system A, a statement
P about the primitive and deﬁned terms of A is said to be independent of A if it is not
possible either to prove or to disprove P using the axioms of A. Like consistency, inde-
pendence of a statement can be very hard to prove directly; but once again, models provide
a shortcut. If there exists a model of A in which P is a false statement and there also exists
another model of A in which P is a true statement, then P is deﬁnitely independent of
A. (If P were provable within A, then it would have to be true in every model; while if it
were disprovable, it would have to be false in every model.)

Some Inﬁnite Models
33
For example, consider the statement every line contains exactly three points. By ex-
amining the models above, we can show that this statement is independent of the axioms
of incidence geometry because it is false in the three-point plane but true in the Fano plane.
More interestingly, we can prove that each of the four axioms of incidence geometry
is independent of the other three. To do so, we just need to exhibit for each axiom an
interpretation in which the other three axioms are true and that axiom is true as well (the
three-point plane will do for this) and then exhibit another interpretation in which the other
three axioms are true but our chosen axiom is false. In fact, we have already seen such
interpretations: Examples 2.7–2.10 describe interpretations in which three of the axioms
are true, but in each case a different one is false. (See Exercises 2A and 2B.) Thus each
of the four axioms is independent of the other three; no axiom could be removed and still
allow us to prove all the same theorems.
Some Inﬁnite Models
Each of the models we have examined so far contains only ﬁnitely many points. Next,
we will examine models with inﬁnitely many points; these are much closer to our usual
understanding of Euclidean geometry.
Our ﬁrst inﬁnite model should be familiar to you from analytic geometry and calcu-
lus. It is named after the seventeenth-century French philosopher and mathematician Ren´e
Descartes (1596–1650), who was the ﬁrst to use pairs of numbers to represent points in the
plane [Des54].
Example 2.11 (The Cartesian Plane). The Cartesian plane is an interpretation in which
a point is deﬁned to be any ordered pair .x;y/ of real numbers; the set of all such ordered
pairs is denoted by R2. A line is deﬁned to be any set of points .x;y/ that is the entire
solution set of an equation of one of the following two types:
x D c
for some real constant c (a vertical line)I
y D mx Cb
for some real constants m and b (a nonvertical line):
(A horizontal line is the special case of a nonvertical line with m D 0, or in other words a
line deﬁned by an equation of the form y D b; but we have no need to treat the horizontal
case separately.) We say that a point .x;y/ lies on a line if the ordered pair .x;y/ is
a solution to the given equation. For a nonvertical line, the constant m in the equation
y D mx Cb is called the slope of the line.
//
Theorem 2.12. The Cartesian plane is a model of incidence geometry.
Proof. To see that Axiom 1 is true in this model, consider the three points .0;0/, .0;1/,
and .1;0/. There is no vertical line that contains them all, because they do not all have the
same x-component. If there were a nonvertical line containing all three points, deﬁned by
an equation of the form y D mx Cb, then plugging in .x;y/ D .0;0/ would imply b D 0,
while plugging in .x;y/ D .0;1/ would imply b D 1, which is a contradiction. Thus these
three points are noncollinear.
To see that the Cartesian plane satisﬁes Axiom 2, suppose .x1;y1/ and .x2;y2/ are
two different points; we have to show that there is a line that contains both of them. This
is a standard exercise in analytic geometry—ﬁnding the equation of a line through two

34
2. Incidence Geometry
points. We consider two cases, depending on the relationship between the x-values and
leading to vertical and nonvertical lines.
CASE 1: x1 D x2. If we set c D x1 D x2, then both points .x1;y1/ and .x2;y2/ satisfy
the equation x D c, so there is a vertical line containing both of them.
CASE 2: x1 ¤ x2. In this case, recalling a little high-school analytic geometry, we can
write down the two-point formula for a line:
y D mx Cb;
where m D
Åy2 y1
x2 x1
ã
;
b D
Åx2y1 x1y2
x2 x1
ã
:
(2.1)
A straightforward computation shows that both .x1;y1/ and .x2;y2/ are solutions to this
equation, so this shows that there exists a line containing our two points.
To prove Axiom 3, suppose that .x1;y1/ and .x2;y2/ are two different points and `
and `0 are two lines that contain both of them. We will show that ` and `0 are in fact the
same line. We have three different cases to consider.
CASE 1: Both ` and `0 are vertical. In this case, the two lines are deﬁned by equations
x D c and x D c0, respectively. Because the point .x1;y1/ lies on both lines, we have
x1 D c and x1 D c0. By transitivity, c D c0, so both lines are the same. Thus in this case
there is only one line containing the two points.
CASE 2: Both ` and `0 are nonvertical. Then they are deﬁned by equations y D
mx C b and y D m0x C b0, respectively. Because .x1;y1/ and .x2;y2/ both lie on `, we
conclude that
y1 D mx1 Cb;
y2 D mx2 Cb:
Subtracting the ﬁrst equation from the second and simplifying leads to the conclusion that
m is given by the same formula as in (2.1). Then we can insert this back into the ﬁrst
equation and solve for b, to conclude that b is also given by (2.1). Exactly the same
argument shows that m0 and b0 are given by the same formulas, so we conclude again that
the two lines are actually the same.
CASE 3: One line is vertical and the other is not. Then one is described by an equation
of the form x D c, and the other by y D mx Cb. The fact that both points are on the line
x D c implies that x1 D c D x2, and then the second equation implies y1 D mx1 C b D
mx2 C b D y2. This yields .x1;y1/ D .x2;y2/, which contradicts our initial assumption
that the points were distinct. Therefore this case cannot occur. This completes the proof of
Axiom 3.
Axiom 4 is much easier to prove. Suppose ` is any line. If ` is a vertical line deﬁned
by x D c, then it contains the distinct points .c;0/ and .c;1/. If it is nonvertical, deﬁned
by y D mx Cb, then it contains both .0;b/ and .1;mCb/.
□
Our next interpretation is also familiar.
Example 2.13 (Spherical Geometry). Spherical geometry is the interpretation in which
a point is deﬁned to be a point on the surface of the unit sphere in R3 (that is, an ordered
triple .x;y;z/ of real numbers such that x2 C y2 C z2 D 1), and a line is deﬁned to be a
great circle, which is a circle on the surface of the sphere whose center coincides with the
center of the sphere. (A great circle can also be thought of as the intersection of the sphere
with a plane through the origin in R3; see Fig. 2.12.) This is not a model of incidence




38
2. Incidence Geometry
Here are three potential axioms that we might wish to add to the axioms of incidence
geometry.
The Elliptic Parallel Postulate. For each line ` and each point A that does not lie on `,
there are no lines that contain A and are parallel to `.
The Euclidean Parallel Postulate. For each line ` and each point A that does not lie on
`, there is one and only one line that contains A and is parallel to `.
The Hyperbolic Parallel Postulate. For each line ` and each point A that does not lie on
`, there are at least two distinct lines that contain A and are parallel to `.
We will explain the nomenclature of the elliptic and hyperbolic parallel postulates at
the end of this section. The postulate we are calling the Euclidean parallel postulate is not,
of course, the same as Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate (which is also sometimes called the Parallel
Postulate). Ours is closer to Playfair’s postulate (see p. 10), but we have chosen a slightly
stronger statement that emphasizes the similarities and contrasts among the three different
parallel postulates.
The elliptic parallel postulate could be stated more simply as “There are no parallel
lines.” But again, the statement given here was chosen to emphasize its relationship with
the other parallel postulates.
Let’s begin our discussion by looking back at some of the interpretations that we intro-
duced earlier in this chapter and asking which (if any) of the parallel postulates are satisﬁed
in some of those interpretations. Because we are asking this question in the context of the
interpretations, not in our axiomatic system, we will not try to construct formal proofs the
way we will do for theorems within the axiomatic system; instead, we will give informal
(but hopefully convincing) arguments for why our conclusions are true.
Example 2.19 (Parallelism in Finite Models of Incidence Geometry).
 The Three-Point Plane: In this model, any two lines intersect in one point, so there
are no parallel lines. Thus the elliptic parallel postulate holds.
 The Four-Point Plane: Look ﬁrst at the line ` D f1;2g. There are two points not
on this line, namely 3 and 4. Consider A D 3: there are three lines that contain 3,
and by checking them one at a time, we see that exactly one of them (namely f3;4g)
has no point in common with `, so it is parallel to `. Similarly, considering the point
A D 4, once again we see that f3;4g is the unique line through A and parallel to `.
We can do the same thing with the line f3;4g: there are two points (1 and 2) not on it,
and in each case f1;2g is the unique line through that point and parallel to `. We can
see by symmetry that the other four lines will work the same way: the entire diagram
looks the same if we rotate it 120ı, and after one or two such rotations each line will
end up in the same position as either f1;2g or f3;4g, so the same argument will apply.
Thus the Euclidean parallel postulate holds in this model. (This is not quite a rigorous
proof, but it is meant to convince you that you could easily write down a complete
proof by enumeration if you took the time.)

Parallel Postulates
39
 The Five-Point Plane: In this case also, there are two kinds of lines up to symmetry
(sides of the pentagon and diagonals of the pentagon). By choosing one line of each
type and checking each of the three points not on it, you can verify that there are
always exactly two parallels to the given line through each point. Thus the hyperbolic
parallel postulate holds in this model.
//
It is important to note that a model might not satisfy any parallel postulate. Here is an
example.
Example 2.20. Consider the model of incidence geometry illustrated in Fig. 2.17: the
points are the numbers 1;2;3;4;5; the lines are the sets f1;2g, f2;3g, f3;4g, f4;1g, f1;5;3g,
and f2;5;4g; and lies on means “is an element of.” (We leave it to you to check that this is
indeed a model.) Let ` be the line f1;2g. Then there is exactly one line that contains the
point 3 and is parallel to `, namely the line f3;4g. However, if we look instead at the point
5, we see that there is no line that contains 5 and is parallel to `, because the lines that
contain 5 (namely f1;5;3g and f2;5;4g) both intersect `. Because the parallel postulates
all say that something has to be true for every line and every point not on that line, none of
the parallel postulates are true in this model.

In the exercises, you will be asked to explore parallelism in some of our other interpre-
tations of incidence geometry. But before we go any further, let us observe that we already
have enough information to conclude that none of the parallel postulates can be proved or
disproved from the axioms of incidence geometry.
Theorem 2.21. Each of the three parallel postulates is independent of the axioms of inci-
dence geometry.
Proof. The Euclidean parallel postulate is true in the four-point plane and false in the
three-point and ﬁve-point planes; the hyperbolic parallel postulate is true in the ﬁve-point
plane and false in the other two; and the elliptic parallel postulate is true in the three-point
plane and false in the other two.
□
We can also ask which parallel postulates are satisﬁed in our inﬁnite models. Let us
ﬁrst see how to tell when two lines are parallel in the Cartesian plane.
Lemma 2.22 (Parallelism in the Cartesian Plane). In the Cartesian plane, parallel lines
have the following properties:
(a) Any two distinct vertical lines are parallel.
(b) Two distinct nonvertical lines are parallel if and only if they have the same slope.
(c) No vertical line is parallel to any nonvertical line.

40
2. Incidence Geometry
Proof. First, suppose ` and `0 are two distinct vertical lines, described by x D c and x D c0,
respectively. The assumption that the lines are distinct means that c ¤ c0. No point .x;y/
can lie on both lines, because it would have to satisfy x D c and x D c0. This proves (a).
Next, suppose ` and `0 are distinct nonvertical lines described by equations y D mx C
b and y D m0x Cb0, respectively. Assume ﬁrst that they have the same slope, which means
m D m0. Since we are assuming that the lines are distinct, we must have b ¤ b0. If there
were a point .x0;y0/ where the two lines intersect, then that point would have to satisfy
both y0 D mx0 C b and y0 D m0x0 C b0 D mx0 C b0. By algebra, therefore, we obtain
b D b0, which is a contradiction. Therefore, there can be no such intersection point, so the
lines are parallel.
Conversely, assume that the lines have different slopes: m ¤ m0. We will show that the
lines are not parallel by showing there exists a point .x0;y0/ where they intersect. Consider
the following point:
.x0;y0/ D
Å b0 b
mm0 ; m b0 b
mm0 Cb
ã
:
(2.2)
By direct substitution, we can see that this point satisﬁes both equations, so the two lines are
not parallel. (In case you wondered, formula (2.2) comes from solving the two equations
simultaneously for x0 and y0; but the only thing that matters for the proof is that the
resulting point is actually a solution of both equations.) This completes the proof of (b).
Finally, to prove (c), assume ` is a vertical line deﬁned by the equation x D c and `0
is a nonvertical line deﬁned by y D mx C b. It is easy to check that the point .x0;y0/ D
.c;mc Cb/ lies on both lines, so they are not parallel.
□
Theorem 2.23. The Cartesian plane satisﬁes the Euclidean parallel postulate.
Proof. Let ` be a line and let A be a point not on `. Write the coordinates of A as .x0;y0/.
Because there are two types of lines, we have two cases to consider.
CASE 1: ` is vertical. Then ` is described by an equation of the form x D c for some
real constant c. The assumption that A does not lie on ` means that x0 ¤ c. Let c0 D x0,
and let `0 be the vertical line deﬁned by the equation x D c0. Then A lies on `0 (by deﬁnition
of “lies on” in this model), and Lemma 2.22 shows that `0 is parallel to `. This shows that
there is at least one line that contains A and is parallel to `.
To prove uniqueness, suppose `00 is another line parallel to ` and containing A. Then
Lemma 2.22 shows that `00 is also vertical, so it must be described by an equation of the
form x D c00 for some constant c00. The fact that A lies on `00 implies that x0 D c00; thus
c00 D c0, which means that `0 and `00 are actually the same line.
CASE 2: ` is nonvertical. In this case, ` is described by an equation of the form
y D mx C b. Before we proceed with the proof, let us reason heuristically for a moment.
We are looking for a line `0 containing A and parallel to `. Lemma 2.22 tells us that `0 will
be parallel to ` if and only if it is distinct from `, is nonvertical, and has the same slope as
`, namely m; thus `0 must necessarily have an equation of the form y D mx Cb0 for some
constant b0 different from b. We also want it to contain A, which means that .x0;y0/ must

Parallel Postulates
41
be a solution to the equation, or in other words y0 D mx0 Cb0. By algebra, therefore, we
must have b0 D y0 mx0.
With this heuristic reasoning in hand, we now proceed with the formal proof. Deﬁne
b0 D y0 mx0, and let `0 be the nonvertical line whose equation is
y D mx Cb0:
(2.3)
Then simple algebra shows that .x0;y0/ solves (2.3), so A lies on `0. Because A does not
lie on `, it follows that ` and `0 must be distinct lines, and because they have the same
slope m, they are parallel by Lemma 2.22. This shows that there exists at least one line `0
containing A and parallel to `.
To prove that it is unique, suppose `00 is any other line containing A and parallel to
`. Lemma 2.22 shows that `00 is nonvertical and has slope m, so it must have an equation
of the form y D mx Cb00 for some constant b00. Because A lies on `00, the same algebraic
computation as before shows that b00 D y0  mx0 D b0, so in fact `00 is the same line
as `.
□
Let us brieﬂy consider our other inﬁnite interpretations.
Example 2.24 (More Parallelism in Incidence Geometry).
 Spherical Geometry: It is a straightforward (though not necessarily easy) exercise
in analytic geometry to show that any two great circles on the sphere must intersect
each other in exactly two antipodal points. (We will not prove it, but you should take
some time to convince yourself that it is true, perhaps by drawing diagrams or looking
at a globe.) Thus there are no parallel lines in this geometry, so the elliptic parallel
postulate is satisﬁed.
 Single Elliptic Geometry: Because two great circles on the sphere always intersect
in a pair of antipodal points, two “lines” in single elliptic geometry always intersect
in a single “point.” Once again, there are no parallel lines, so the elliptic parallel
postulate is satisﬁed.
 The Beltrami–Klein Disk: In this model, it is easy to see that given any line and any
point not on that line, there are inﬁnitely many parallels to the given line through the
given point. (Look back at Fig. 2.13, which shows an example of three parallels to a
line ` through a point A.) Thus the hyperbolic parallel postulate is satisﬁed.
 The Poincar´e Disk: Again, it straightforward (though not quite as easy as in the
Beltrami–Klein disk) to see that the hyperbolic parallel postulate is satisﬁed. (See Fig.
2.14.) In this case, to check all possibilities, one would have to consider separately
all combinations of lines of type (a) or lines of type (b) of Example 2.16, together
with the point at the center of the circle or a point away from the center. You should
take a few minutes to convince yourself that in each case, there are inﬁnitely many
parallels to the given line through the given point.
 The Poincar´e Half-Plane: A similar argument by cases shows that the hyperbolic
parallel postulate is satisﬁed in the Poincar´e half-plane and that there are inﬁnitely
many parallels through a given point not on a line.
 The Hyperboloid Model: Of the models we have introduced, the hyperboloid model
is one of the harder ones to visualize, so it is probably not easy to guess which, if any,

42
2. Incidence Geometry
of the parallel postulates it satisﬁes. With a bit of analytic geometry, one can prove
that this model also satisﬁes the hyperbolic parallel postulate.
//
The names of the elliptic and hyperbolic parallel postulates are explained, at least in
part, by the two surface models we introduced in this chapter: the hyperbolic parallel pos-
tulate is satisﬁed in the hyperboloid model, while the elliptic parallel postulate is satisﬁed
in spherical geometry (and a sphere is a special case of an ellipsoid).
Theorems in Incidence Geometry
So far in our discussion of incidence geometry, we have explored three of its four elements
as an axiomatic system: primitive terms, deﬁned terms, and axioms. Now we are ready to
introduce the fourth and most important element: theorems. Throughout the rest of this
chapter, we assume the four incidence axioms, and we will construct our proofs rigorously
within that axiomatic system. Before reading this section, it would be a good idea to read
through Appendices E and F, which describe the conventions of mathematical logic and
typical methods of proof.
Let’s begin with something simple.
Theorem 2.25. Given any point A, there exists another point that is distinct from A.
Before we prove the theorem, let us take some time to discuss the process of writing
such a proof. Usually, there are ﬁve stages to writing a proof:
1. Decode what the theorem statement means and what needs to be proved.
2. Choose a template for proving that type of statement.
3. Brainstorm about how the proof should go.
4. Construct the logical steps of the proof.
5. Write the proof in easily readable paragraph form.
Let’s walk through each of these stages in turn for Theorem 2.25. We are going to be ex-
tremely careful this time through, so that you can see how strictly we need to pay attention
to detail in order to ensure that our proofs are airtight.
1. Decode what the theorem statement means and what needs to be proved. The
statement of Theorem 2.25 is a universal existence statement. In its “top-level” structure, it
is a universal statement, with “given any point A” as its universal quantiﬁer. The statement
being quantiﬁed is an existence statement: “there exists another point that is distinct from
A.” Thus we might symbolize the whole statement this way, with the understanding that A
and B represent points: “8A; 9B; B ¤ A.”
2. Choose a template for proving that type of statement. Often, the structure of the
theorem statement tells you immediately what kind of template to set up. In this case, we
use Template F.12 (see Appendix F) for a universal existence proof. It looks like this:

□
We did not include a speciﬁc step to prove that B is a point, because it is reasonable
to expect that our choice of B will make that obvious. The template does not tell us how
we should go about producing the point B, so we leave that to the next step.
3. Brainstorm about how the proof should go. At ﬁrst glance, it might seem that there
is hardly anything to prove here. After all, Axiom 1 says there exist at least three distinct
points. Why can’t we just say “let A be one of them, and let B be another”?
To answer this question, we have to remember that each statement in an axiomatic
system means precisely what it says, nothing more and nothing less. Axiom 1 says that
there exist three distinct points; it does not say we get to choose one of them in advance.
(As pointed out in Appendix F, it is useful to imagine that a mischievous gremlin chooses
them, with an eye toward making our proof as difﬁcult as possible.) We are given an
arbitrary point A; the axiom says there exist three distinct points, but the points chosen by
the gremlin might have nothing to do with A. In particular, we cannot assume that one of
them is equal to A.
So all we can say is that there exist three distinct noncollinear points; let’s call them
C, D, and E. Can we just say that C is a point distinct from A? Well, no—just as the
axiom does not say we can count on one of the points being equal to A, it also does not say
we can count on any particular one of them being unequal to A. It could happen that C is
actually the same point as A!
Yes, you will say, but one of them must be different from A! Now we’re getting
somewhere: it is evident that since the two points C and D are different from each other,
then one of them must indeed be different from A. But to be thorough, this is something
we need to prove: Axiom 1 says that there exist three points that are different from each
other; it does not say anything about being different from a predetermined point A.
Since we do not know which of the three points is different from A, our proof is going
to have to be split into cases. This is where we have to be careful to ensure that our cases
are known to exhaust all possibilities. We cannot take our cases to be “C is different from
A,” “D is different from A,” and “E is different from A,” because that would be assuming
that at least one of them is different from A, which is exactly what we’re trying to prove!
Instead, we can take our two cases to be “C is different from A” and “C is equal to A.”
One of these will certainly be true.
At this point, the rest of the proof comes naturally: if C is different from A, then we
can just take B D C; and if C is equal to A, we can take B D D. In each case, it follows
easily from what we already know that B is not equal to A.

4. Construct the logical steps of the proof. Now that we have seen the main ideas
that will go into the proof, we just need to organize the argument into a two-column proof.
There will be two cases, depending on whether C D A or not; and each case will include
the two steps of the existence proof: choosing B and proving that B ¤ A.

□
5. Write the proof in easily readable paragraph form. Finally, having worked out the
logic of the proof, we need to write it in a form that is easily understandable by a human
reader, meaning in paragraph form. The idea is to take the exact steps that are laid out in
the two-column format and express them clearly and ﬂuently in standard English. When
you do this, sometimes you will ﬁnd that multiple steps can easily be compressed into
one statement without causing confusion; other times, additional explanations need to be
added. As you describe the steps, the justiﬁcation for every step should be immediately
clear to the reader. This does not mean, though, that you have to write out every justiﬁ-
cation explicitly—if you think a reader is likely to see immediately why a step is true (as
when going from step 6 to step 7 above), there is no need to write the reason explicitly
in the proof. On the other hand, if you’re not sure whether a reason will be clear to your
intended audience, it’s usually safer to err on the side of including more.
Here is the ﬁnal form of the proof.
Proof of Theorem 2.25. Let A be an arbitrary point. Axiom 1 guarantees that there exist
three distinct points; let’s call them C, D, and E. Since they are distinct, we know that
C ¤ D. Either C is distinct from A or it is not. If C ¤ A, then we can let B D C and
conclude that B is a point different from A. Otherwise, if C D A, we can let B D D,

Theorems in Incidence Geometry
45
and then the fact that C ¤ D ensures that B is different from A. In either case, we have
produced a point B that is distinct from A.
□
If you look over this written proof, you might decide that introducing the symbol B
to represent the chosen point doesn’t add anything to the clarity of the proof. It would be
perfectly legitimate to shorten the proof as follows.
Another proof of Theorem 2.25.
Let A be an arbitrary point. Axiom 1 guarantees that
there exist three distinct points; let’s call them C, D, and E. Since they are distinct, we
know that C ¤ D. Either C is distinct from A or it is not. If C ¤ A, then C is a point
different from A. Otherwise, if C D A, then the fact that C ¤ D ensures that D is a point
different from A. In either case, we have produced a point that is distinct from A.
□
Here is another simple theorem.
Theorem 2.26. Given any point, there exists a line that contains it.
Again, let’s walk through the steps of constructing a proof.
1. Decode. Once again, this is a universal existence statement. To write it symboli-
cally, let’s borrow the symbol “2” from set theory to symbolize “lies on,” even though lines
in incidence geometry need not be sets of points. With the understanding that A represents
a point and ` represents a line, we can symbolize the theorem statement as “8A; 9`; A 2 `.”
2. Choose a template. The template for this proof will be just like the preceding one,
starting with “let A be an arbitrary point” and then proceeding with the existence proof.
3. Brainstorm. After introducing our arbitrary point A, we need to think about how to
produce a line containing A. We have only one theorem so far, and it does not say anything
about lines, so it is no help. The only axiom that asserts the existence of a line is Axiom 2,
but that requires two points. Now our previous theorem comes to the rescue: it tell us that
there exists a point different from A, and then Axiom 2 says there exists a line containing
these two points.
4. Construct the logical steps. Next we need to write the steps of the proof in two-
column format. From now on, for simplicity, we will often omit the titles of separate parts
or cases of short proofs. Here is a two-column proof:
Statement
Reason
1.
Let A be an arbitrary point.
(hypothesis)
2.
There exists a point B distinct from A.
(Theorem 2.25)
3.
There exists a line ` containing A and B.
(Axiom 2)
4.
There exists a line ` containing A.
(logic)
□
5. Write the proof. Here is the ﬁnal form of the proof:
Proof of Theorem 2.26.
Let A be a point. By Theorem 2.25, there is another point B
distinct from A, and by Axiom 2, there is at least one line ` that contains both A and B.
This line ` satisﬁes the desired conclusion.
□

46
2. Incidence Geometry
The preceding theorem has the following useful corollary. Because the proof (by
cases) is so simple, we will just go straight to the ﬁnal paragraph-style proof.
Corollary 2.27. If A and B are points (not necessarily distinct), there is a line that con-
tains both of them.
Proof. Let A and B be any two points. If they are distinct, then Axiom 2 guarantees that
there is a line that contains them, while if they are not distinct, then Theorem 2.26 yields
the same conclusion.
□
Recall that for any pair of distinct points A and B, we have deﬁned the notation
 !
AB to
mean the unique line containing A and B, whose existence and uniqueness are guaranteed
by Axioms 2 and 3 (see p. 25). The next theorem illustrates a common way in which the
uniqueness statement of Axiom 3 is used.
Theorem 2.28. If ` is a line and A and B are two distinct points on `, then
 !
AB D `.
1. Decode. The “top-level” structure of the theorem statement is an implication. Since
`, A, and B all appear in the hypothesis and conclusion without being quantiﬁed, we can
infer that there is an implicit universal quantiﬁer for all three symbols. So we can read
the statement as if it started with “For every line ` and for all points A and B . . . .” The
hypothesis of the implication is written as a conjunction (“` is a line and A and B are
two distinct points on `”); but since we have now subsumed “` is a line” in the quantiﬁer,
we can rewrite the hypothesis simply as “A and B are two distinct points on `.” In more
detail, this is a conjunction: “A lies on ` and B lies on ` and A ¤ B.” The conclusion is
“
 !
AB D `.” With the understanding that A and B represent points and ` represents a line,
we can summarize the statement as follows (again using “2” to denote “lies on”):
8`; 8A; 8B;

A 2 ` ^ B 2 ` ^ A ¤ B

 !
AB D `:

use that template.

3. Brainstorm. This is essentially an exercise in understanding two things: the deﬁni-
tion of the notation
 !
AB and the meaning of Axiom 3. By deﬁnition,
 !
AB is the (unique)
line containing A and B. On the other hand, our hypothesis says that ` is also a line con-
taining A and B. Axiom 3 says there is at most one line containing A and B, which really
means that if we happen to ﬁnd two such lines, they must be equal. This is the crux of the
proof.

□
Our next theorem gives a useful criterion for deciding when three points are non-
collinear. (Recall that this means there is no line that contains all three of them.)
Theorem 2.29. If A and B are distinct points and C is any point that does not lie on
 !

then A, B, and C are noncollinear.
1. Decode. Once again, this is a universal implication, with an implicit universal
quantiﬁer for A, B, and C. The hypothesis of the implication is a conjunction (“A and B
are distinct and C does not lie on
 !

Until we go through the brainstorming step, there is not much more detail that can be

3. Brainstorm. The ﬁrst thing to notice is that there is in fact something to prove here.
The hypothesis tells us immediately that A, B, and C do not all lie on the speciﬁc line
 !
AB ; however, in order to prove that A, B, and C are noncollinear, we have to show that
there does not exist any line that all three points lie on. This is a nonexistence statement,
so as explained in Appendix F, the most promising approach will be an indirect proof:
we will assume that there does exist a line containing all three and derive a contradiction.
Suppose ` is a line containing A, B, and C. It follows from Theorem 2.28 that ` D

□
The rest of our theorems about incidence geometry will be left for you to prove as
exercises. When brainstorming about the proofs, be sure to be on the lookout for previous
theorems that might be useful.
Our next theorem is the converse of the preceding one.
Theorem 2.30. If A, B, and C are noncollinear points, then A and B are distinct, and C
does not lie on
 !
AB .
You will be asked to prove this theorem shortly. But to get you started, let’s think
about what needs to be done. This is a universal implication (with an implicit universal
quantiﬁer for A, B, and C), whose conclusion is a conjunction. Thus a direct proof would
begin by assuming that A, B, and C are noncollinear points, and then there would be two
parts: Part 1 would prove that A and B are distinct, and Part 2 would prove that C does
not lie on
 !
AB .
If you start thinking about how to set up this proof, things get complicated pretty
quickly. How could we prove that A and B are distinct? We don’t have an axiom or
theorem whose conclusion is that two points are distinct (apart from Axiom 1, which can-
not be applied to previously given points). Nor do we have an axiom or theorem whose
conclusion is that a point does not lie on a line. For that matter, how would we go about
using the hypothesis that A, B, and C are noncollinear? As we observed above, this is a
nonexistence statement, and it’s hard to see how the nonexistence of a line is going to be
of much use.
The problem here is that all the parts of the theorem statement—the hypothesis and
the two conclusions—are negative statements. The hypothesis is that there does not exist

Theorems in Incidence Geometry
49
a line containing A, B, and C; the ﬁrst conclusion is that A and B are not equal, and the
second conclusion is that C does not lie on
 !
AB . In situations like this, if you ﬁnd yourself
spinning your wheels when you try to brainstorm about how to set up a proof, it’s a good
time to try a different strategy. If a direct proof doesn’t seem to be working, maybe a
contrapositive proof will, or an indirect proof.
For this theorem, it turns out that a contrapositive proof works nicely. The starting
assumption will be the negation of the conclusion: either A and B are equal or C lies on
 !
AB (which includes the assumption that A ¤ B). Under this assumption, you have to
prove that A, B, and C are collinear, meaning that there is a line that contains them all.
Because the starting assumption is a disjunction, your proof will have two cases.
Now you should be ready to construct the proof yourself. (See Exercise 2K.)
In the preceding theorem, there is nothing special about the point C: if A, B, and C
are noncollinear, the same argument also shows that A and C are distinct, as are B and C;
and it also shows that A does not lie on

BC and B does not lie on

let us state this as a corollary. Because it follows immediately from Theorem 2.30 (with
the names of the points changed), we do not need to write out the proof.

Recall Statements I and II that we introduced in Chapter 2 (see p. 26). As you are
asked to show in Exercise 2D, Statement II is independent of the axioms of incidence
geometry because it is true in some models and false in others, so it cannot be a theorem
of incidence geometry. On the other hand, Statement I is a theorem of incidence geometry,

Chapter 3
Axioms for Plane Geometry
Starting in this chapter, we describe a modern, rigorous axiomatic system within which
all of Euclid’s theorems of plane geometry (and more) can be proved. To begin with, we
describe an axiomatic system that does not include any parallel postulate; this system is
called neutral geometry. Like Euclid, we will prove as many theorems as we can without
relying on a parallel postulate. When the Euclidean parallel postulate is added to the postu-
lates of neutral geometry, we obtain an axiomatic system called Euclidean geometry, and
when the hyperbolic parallel postulate is added instead, we obtain hyperbolic geometry.
Taken together, this collection of axiomatic systems is called plane geometry.
The postulates we will be using are based roughly on the SMSG postulates proposed
for high-school geometry courses in the 1960s (see Appendix C), from which most axiom
systems used in high-school geometry textbooks are descended. The SMSG postulates,
in turn, were based ultimately on the axiomatic system proposed in 1932 by George D.
Birkhoff (Appendix B), the ﬁrst mathematician to introduce the real number system into
the foundations of geometry. The axioms introduced here are closely related to those that
are typically used in high-school courses, but they adhere to a higher standard of rigor.
Although Euclid treated the geometry of three-dimensional space in addition to plane
geometry and both Hilbert’s system and the SMSG system contain postulates that describe
the geometry of space, our treatment is limited to plane geometry alone. This is not because
three-dimensional geometry is not important (it is), but rather because our main purpose is
to explore the way axiomatic systems are used to make mathematics rigorous, and plane
geometry serves that purpose perfectly well. Once you have thoroughly understood the
approach to plane geometry developed in this book, it should be an easy matter to extend
your understanding to the geometry of space.
Because our axiom system uses both set theory and the theory of the real number
system as underlying foundations, we assume all of the standard tools of set theory (sum-
marized in Appendix G) and all of the standard properties of the real numbers (summarized
in Appendix H) as given.

3. Axioms for Plane Geometry
The proofs in this subject range from very easy to extremely challenging. In order
that you might have a bit of forewarning about how difﬁcult a proof is likely to be before
you start to tackle it, we use the following rating system for our proofs in plane geometry,
borrowed from the movies:
 Rated G: simple, straightforward proofs that you should understand thoroughly and
be able to reconstruct on your own. Many of these proofs would be quite appropriate
to explain to high-school students. All of the geometry proofs in this book are rated
G unless otherwise speciﬁed.
 Rated PG: proofs that are a little less straightforward than the G-rated ones. Some
might use slightly more advanced techniques, while others use only elementary tech-
niques but contain unexpected ideas or “tricks.” You should understand these thor-
oughly; but you might not have thought of them yourself, and you might ﬁnd it a
little challenging to reconstruct them on your own unless you have made an effort to
commit the main ideas to memory.
 Rated R: proofs that are considerably more difﬁcult than most of the proofs in the
book because they use more advanced techniques, or they use elementary techniques
in highly unconventional ways, or they are unusually long and intricate. You should
attempt to follow the logic of these proofs, but you would ordinarily not be expected
to be able to reconstruct them without a great deal of effort.
 Rated X: proofs that are too advanced or too complex to be included in this book at
all.
From now on, we will present all of our proofs in paragraph form, since such proofs
are usually the easiest kind to understand. But you are encouraged to continue constructing
proofs ﬁrst in two-column format before writing them in paragraph form, to help you make
sure you have correctly worked out the logical steps and their justiﬁcations.
Points and Lines
Every axiomatic system must begin with some primitive terms. In our axiomatic approach
to geometry, there are four primitive terms: point, line, distance (between points), and
measure (of an angle). The terms point and line represent objects, while distance and
measure represent functions: distance is a function of pairs of points, and measure is a
function of angles (to be deﬁned later).
Although we do not give the primitive terms formal mathematical deﬁnitions within
our axiomatic system, here is how you should think about them intuitively:
 Point: a precise, indivisible “location” in the plane, without any length, width, depth,
area, or volume. Euclid’s description of a point as “that which has no part” is as good
as any.
 Line: a set of points in the plane that forms a “continuous straight path” with no
width, no gaps, and no bends, extending inﬁnitely far in both directions.
 Distance between points: a nonnegative real number describing how far apart two
points are.
 Measure of an angle: a real number between 0 and 180 inclusive (representing de-
grees), describing the size of the opening between two rays with a common endpoint.

Points and Lines
55
It cannot be overemphasized that these are not mathematical deﬁnitions; they are just
intuitive descriptions to help you visualize what the terms mean when they are used in
postulates and in further deﬁnitions. We will never use any of these descriptions to jus-
tify steps in a proof. (It would be impossible to do so while maintaining rigor, because
many of the key terms that appear in these descriptions—such as “location,” “straight,”
and “opening”—have themselves not been formally deﬁned!) The only mathematical con-
tent that can be ascribed to the primitive terms is what the postulates tell us about them.
As a general rule, we use capital letters to denote points, and we use lowercase letters
in the range `;m;n;::: to denote lines. Most of these symbols, however, can also be used
to represent other objects, so it is always necessary to say what each particular symbol is
meant to represent.
Here is our ﬁrst postulate.
Postulate 1 (The Set Postulate). Every line is a set of points, and there is a set of all
points called the plane.
This postulate does not contain much geometric information, but it sets the stage for
everything we are going to do later. It tells us that we can use all of the tools of set theory
(subsets, intersections, unions, etc.) when talking about lines or other collections of points.
It rules out models in which lines are anything other than sets of points—such as, for
example, the Amtrak model of Chapter 2.
Using the vocabulary of set theory, we can deﬁne some commonly used geometric
terms. If ` is a line and A is a point, we deﬁne both A lies on ` and ` contains A to be
synonyms for the statement A 2 `. The set postulate thus frees us from having to consider
“lies on” as a primitive term.
We deﬁne the following terms just as we did in incidence geometry: a set of points is
said to be collinear if there is a line that contains them all; and two lines ` and m are said
to intersect if there is at least one point that lies on both of them. (In this context, this is
just a special case of the set-theoretic deﬁnition of what it means for two sets to intersect.)
If A is a point that lies on both lines ` and m, we also say that ` and m meet at A. We say
that ` and m are parallel, denoted by ` k m, if they do not intersect. By this deﬁnition, no
line is parallel to itself since—as we will see below—every line contains at least one point
and thus intersects itself. (Some high-school geometry texts deﬁne parallel lines in such
a way that every line is parallel to itself. Which deﬁnition is chosen is a matter of taste
and convenience, and each author is free to choose either deﬁnition, as long as he or she
uses it consistently. For our purposes, the deﬁnition we have chosen is much more useful.
Besides, it has an excellent pedigree: it is essentially the same as Euclid’s deﬁnition.)
The next postulate begins to give the theory a little substance. You will recognize it as
Axiom 1 of incidence geometry.
Postulate 2 (The Existence Postulate).
There exist at least three distinct non-
collinear points.

56
3. Axioms for Plane Geometry
This postulate still does not tell us very much about our geometry, but without it we
could not get started because we could not be sure that there exist any points at all!
Our third postulate corresponds to Euclid’s ﬁrst postulate. But ours says more: whereas
Euclid assumed only that for any two points, there is a line that contains them, we are as-
suming in addition that the line is unique. (It is clear from Euclid’s use of his ﬁrst postulate
in Proposition I.4 that he had in mind that the line should be unique, even though he didn’t
state it as part of the postulate. Our postulate rectiﬁes this omission.)
Postulate 3 (The Unique Line Postulate).
Given any two distinct points, there is a
unique line that contains both of them.
You will also recognize this as the combination of Axioms 2 and 3 of incidence geom-
etry. (Axiom 4 of incidence geometry is true in our axiomatic system as well, but we do
not need to assume it as a separate postulate because it will follow from Postulate 5 below.)
If A and B are two distinct points, we use the notation
 !
AB to denote the unique line
that contains both A and B, just as in incidence geometry (see p. 25). As before, if A
and B have not been previously mentioned, then a phrase such as “Let
 !
AB be a line”
is understood to mean “Let A and B be distinct points and let
 !
AB be the unique line
containing them.”
Distance
So far, our geometric postulates have not strayed very far from the axioms of incidence
geometry. In fact, you can check that every model of incidence geometry described in
Chapter 2 in which each line is a set of points (as opposed to, say, a railroad line) is also a
model of the axiomatic system we have described so far. Our next two postulates, though,
take us in a very different direction, by introducing the real numbers into the study of
geometry.
Postulate 4 (The Distance Postulate). For every pair of points A and B, the distance
from A to B is a nonnegative real number determined by A and B.
We use the notation AB to denote the distance from A to B. This postulate gives us
no details about the distance AB other than that it is a nonnegative real number and that it
is completely determined by the points A and B. (So, for example, if A0 D A and B0 D B,
then A0B0 D AB; and the distance from A to B will be the same tomorrow as it is today.)
The next postulate is what gives distance its geometric meaning. It expresses in rigorous
mathematical language our intuitive understanding of what we do with a ruler (Fig. 3.1):
we align it with a line along which we wish to determine distances and then read off the
distance between two points by subtracting the numbers that appear at the corresponding
positions on the ruler. Of course, the postulate says nothing about physical rulers; it is
called the “ruler postulate” merely as a way to remember easily what it is about.
If X and Y are sets, recall that a function f WX ! Y is said to be injective if f .x1/ D
f .x2/ implies x1 D x2; it is said to be surjective if for every y 2 Y there exists x 2 X

such that f .x/ D y; and it is said to be bijective if it is both injective and surjective. (See
Appendix G for a brief review of these concepts.)
Postulate 5 (The Ruler Postulate). For every line `, there is a bijective function
f W` ! R with the property that for any two points A;B 2 `, we have
AB D jf .B/f .A/j:
(3.1)
If x and y are real numbers, we often refer to the quantity jy  xj as the distance
between x and y. If ` is a line, a function f W` ! R that satisﬁes equation (3.1) for all
A;B 2 ` is said to be distance-preserving, because (3.1) says that the distance between
the points A and B is the same as that between the numbers f .A/ and f .B/. A distance-
preserving bijective function from ` to R is called a coordinate function for `. With this
terminology, we can summarize the ruler postulate as follows: for each line, there exists a
coordinate function. Once a particular coordinate function f has been chosen for a line,
then the number f .A/ associated with a point A is called the coordinate of A with respect
to f .
One immediate consequence of the ruler postulate is the following.
Theorem 3.1. Every line contains inﬁnitely many distinct points.
Proof. Let ` be a line. By the ruler postulate, there exists a coordinate function f W` ! R.
Because f is surjective, for each positive integer n, there is a point Xn 2 ` such that
f .Xn/ D n. All of the points fX1;X2;:::g must be distinct because f is a well-deﬁned
function and assigns different values to them.
□
This theorem immediately implies the fourth axiom of incidence geometry.
Corollary 3.2 (Incidence Axiom 4). Given any line, there are at least two distinct points
that lie on it.
□
We have now shown that all four axioms of incidence geometry are true in our ax-
iomatic system. (Incidence Axiom 1 is the existence postulate; Incidence Axioms 2 and 3
follow from the unique line postulate; and we have just proved Incidence Axiom 4.) There-
fore, Theorems 2.25–2.42 (including Corollaries 2.27, 2.31, and 2.39) are now theorems
of neutral geometry, with exactly the same proofs.
It is important to note that the ruler postulate does not say that there is a unique coor-
dinate function, only that there is at least one. In fact, as we will soon show, every line has
many different coordinate functions. Because the distance postulate guarantees that the
distance between any two points is a well-deﬁned number, one thing that we can conclude
from the ruler postulate is that any two coordinate functions for the same line yield the
same distances between pairs of points.

58
3. Axioms for Plane Geometry
The next two lemmas are the mathematical analogues of “sliding the ruler along the
line” and “ﬂipping the ruler end over end.” The proofs of these lemmas are rated PG,
not because they are hard but because they use the concepts of injectivity and surjectivity,
which might still be relatively new to some readers.
Lemma 3.3 (Ruler Sliding Lemma). Suppose ` is a line and f W` ! R is a coordinate
function for `. Given a real number c, deﬁne a new function f1W` ! R by f1.X/ D
f .X/Cc for all X 2 `. Then f1 is also a coordinate function for `.
Proof. To show that f1 is a coordinate function, we must show that it is bijective and
distance-preserving. First, to see that it is surjective, suppose y is an arbitrary real number.
We need to show that there is a point P 2 ` such that f1.P / D y, which is equivalent to
f .P / C c D y. Because f is surjective, there is a point P 2 ` such that f .P / D y  c,
and then it follows that f1.P / D y as desired.
Next, to see that f1 is injective, suppose A and B are points on ` such that f1.A/ D
f1.B/; we need to show that A D B. A little algebra gives
0 D f1.A/f1.B/
D .f .A/Cc/.f .B/Cc/
D f .A/f .B/:
Thus f .A/ D f .B/, and the fact that f is injective implies A D B. This completes the
proof that f1 is bijective.
Finally, we have to show that f1 is distance-preserving. If A and B are any two points
on `, the deﬁnition of f1 and the fact that f is distance-preserving imply
jf1.B/f1.A/j D
.f .B/Cc/.f .A/Cc/

D jf .B/f .A/j
D AB;
which was to be proved.
□
Lemma 3.4 (Ruler Flipping Lemma). Suppose ` is a line and f W` ! R is a coordinate
function for `. If we deﬁne f2W` ! R by f2.X/ D f .X/ for all X 2 `, then f2 is also a
coordinate function for `.
Proof. Exercise 3A.
□
The preceding two lemmas are the basic ingredients in the proof of the following
important strengthening of the ruler postulate.
Theorem 3.5 (Ruler Placement Theorem). Suppose ` is a line and A;B are two distinct
points on `. Then there exists a coordinate function f W` ! R such that f .A/ D 0 and
f .B/ > 0.
Proof. Given `, A, and B as in the hypothesis, the ruler postulate guarantees that there
exists some coordinate function f1W` ! R. Let c D f1.A/, and deﬁne a new function
f2W` ! R by f2.X/ D f1.X/Cc. Then the ruler sliding lemma guarantees that f2 is also
a coordinate function for `, and it satisﬁes f2.A/ D 0 by direct computation.
Because A and B are distinct points and coordinate functions are injective, it follows
that f2.B/ ¤ 0. Thus we have two cases: either f2.B/ > 0 or f2.B/ < 0. If f2.B/ > 0,

Distance
59
then we can set f D f2, and f satisﬁes the conclusions of the theorem. On the other hand,
if f2.B/ < 0, then we deﬁne a new function f W` ! R by f .X/ D f2.X/. The ruler
ﬂipping lemma guarantees that f is a coordinate function. It follows from the deﬁnition of
f that f .A/ D f2.A/ D 0 and f .B/ D f2.B/ > 0, so f is the function we seek.
□
It is worth noting that the SMSG system (Appendix C) includes the ruler placement
theorem as an additional postulate, instead of proving it as a theorem, and many high-
school texts follow suit. The main reason seems to be that proving the ruler sliding and
ﬂipping lemmas, on which the ruler placement theorem depends, requires a good under-
standing of the properties of bijective functions, which high-school students are unlikely
to have been introduced to. (Be warned, however, that some texts, such as [UC02], state
as a postulate an even stronger version of the ruler placement theorem, which claims that
it is possible to choose a coordinate function for a line such that any chosen point on the
line has coordinate 0 and any other chosen point has coordinate 1. Since another postulate
speciﬁes that coordinate functions are distance-preserving, this would lead to the contra-
dictory conclusion that the distance between every pair of distinct points is equal to 1. This
inconsistency is glossed over without comment in [UC02].)
Here are some important properties of distances that can be deduced easily from the
ruler postulate.
Theorem 3.6 (Properties of Distances). If A and B are any two points, their distance has
the following properties:
(a) AB D BA.
(b) AB D 0 if and only if A D B.
(c) AB > 0 if and only if A ¤ B.
Proof. Let A and B be two points. By Corollary 2.27, there is a line ` containing both A
and B. By the ruler postulate, there is a coordinate function f W` ! R, and it satisﬁes AB D
jf .B/f .A/j. The properties of absolute values guarantee that BA D jf .A/f .B/j D
jf .B/f .A/j D AB, which is (a).
Statement (b) is an equivalence, so we need to prove two implications: if AB D 0,
then A D B; and if A D B, then AB D 0. Assume ﬁrst that AB D 0. Because f is
distance-preserving, this implies jf .B/f .A/j D 0, which in turn implies f .B/ D f .A/.
Because f is injective, this implies A D B. Conversely, assume that A D B. Then AB D
jf .B/f .A/j D jf .A/f .A/j D 0 because f is a well-deﬁned function.
Finally, we prove (c). If we assume that AB > 0, then it follows from (b) that A ¤ B.
Conversely, if A ¤ B, then (b) implies AB ¤ 0. Since the distance postulate implies that
distances cannot be negative, it follows that AB must in fact be positive.
□
Betweenness of Points
The ruler postulate provides the tools we need to address many important issues that
Euclid left out of his axiomatic system. The ﬁrst of these has to do with what it means for
a point on a line to be “between” two other points. We already know what “betweenness”
means for numbers: if x;y;z are three real numbers, we say that y is between x and z
if either x < y < z or x > y > z. Let us introduce the notation x  y  z to symbolize

60
3. Axioms for Plane Geometry
this relationship. From elementary algebra, it follows that whenever x, y, and z are three
distinct real numbers, exactly one of them lies between the other two.
Using the notion of betweenness of numbers, we can deﬁne betweenness for points:
given points A, B, and C, we say that B is between A and C if all three points are distinct
and lie on some line ` and there is a coordinate function f W` ! R such that f .A/f .B/
f .C/; according to the deﬁnition above, this means that either f .A/ < f .B/ < f .C/ or
f .A/ > f .B/ > f .C/. (See Fig. 3.2.) We symbolize this relationship with the notation
AB C.
A
B
C
Fig. 3.2. B is between A and C, symbolized by AB C.
This deﬁnition corresponds well to our intuitive idea of what we mean when we say
that one point is between two others. There is one awkward thing about it, though: to say
B is between A and C means that f .B/ is between f .A/ and f .C/ for some coordinate
function f ; it does not immediately rule out the possibility that a different coordinate
function f1 might put the points in a different order, so that, for example, f1.A/ might be
between f1.B/ and f1.C/. By our deﬁnition, this would imply that A is also between B
and C! We will see below that this cannot happen. But ﬁrst, we need to establish some
basic properties of betweenness.
Theorem 3.7 (Symmetry of Betweenness of Points). If A;B;C are any three points, then
AB C if and only if C B A.
Proof. Both statements mean the same thing: namely, that A, B, and C are distinct points
that lie on some line `, and there is a coordinate function f W` ! R such that either f .A/ <
f .B/ < f .C/ or f .A/ > f .B/ > f .C/.
□
The most important fact about betweenness is expressed in the next theorem.
Theorem 3.8 (Betweenness Theorem for Points). Suppose A, B, and C are points. If
AB C, then AB CBC D AC.
Proof. Assume that A, B, and C are points such that AB C. This means that A;B;C
all lie on some line ` and there is some coordinate function f W` ! R such that either
f .A/ < f .B/ < f .C/ or f .A/ > f .B/ > f .C/. After interchanging the names of A and
C if necessary, we may assume that f .A/ < f .B/ < f .C/. (This is justiﬁed because the
statement of the theorem means the same thing after A and C are interchanged, by virtue
of Theorems 3.6(a) and 3.7.) Then because the absolute value of a positive number is the
number itself, we have the following relationships:
AB D jf .B/f .A/j D f .B/f .A/I
BC D jf .C/f .B/j D f .C/f .B/I
AC D jf .C/f .A/j D f .C/f .A/:
Adding the ﬁrst two equations and subtracting the third, we ﬁnd that all of the terms on the
right-hand side cancel. Thus AB C BC AC D 0, which is equivalent to the conclusion
of the theorem.

The next theorem was one of the axioms in Hilbert’s original axiomatic system for
Euclidean geometry. (In later revisions, he found that he could get by with a somewhat
weaker axiom; see Axiom II.3 in Appendix A.)
Theorem 3.9 (Hilbert’s Betweenness Axiom). Given three distinct collinear points, ex-
actly one of them lies between the other two.
Proof. Suppose A, B, and C are distinct collinear points. Let ` be the line containing
them, and let f W` ! R be a coordinate function for `. Since f is bijective, it follows
that f .A/, f .B/, and f .C/ are three distinct real numbers. By algebra, exactly one of
these numbers lies between the other two; without loss of generality, let us say that f .A/
f .B/f .C/. (If this is not the case, we can just rename the points so that it is.) Therefore,
by deﬁnition of betweenness, B is between A and C. Thus we have shown that at least
one of the three points is between the other two.
Now we need to prove that only one point can be between the other two. Suppose for
the sake of contradiction that, say, A  B  C and A  C  B both hold (which could be
the case, for example, if some other coordinate function f1 had the property that f1.A/ 
f1.C/f1.B/.) Then the betweenness theorem implies
AB CBC D AC;
AC CCB D AB:
(3.2)
Adding these two equations together, we obtain AB C AC C 2BC D AB C AC, from
which it follows algebraically that BC D 0. On the other hand, since we are assuming B
and C are distinct, Theorem 3.6(c) implies that BC > 0, which is a contradiction.
□
We can now resolve the awkward question raised by our deﬁnition of betweenness:
whether it is possible to have two coordinate functions f1 and f2 for the same line such
that f1.B/ is between f1.A/ and f1.C/, while, say, f2.A/ is between f2.B/ and f2.C/.
The next lemma shows that no such anomaly is possible.
Corollary 3.10 (Consistency of Betweenness of Points). Suppose A;B;C are three
points on a line `. Then A  B  C if and only if f .A/  f .B/  f .C/ for every coor-
dinate function f W` ! R.
Proof. On the one hand, if f .A/  f .B/  f .C/ for every coordinate function f , then
AB C by deﬁnition. Conversely, assume that AB C and suppose f is any coordi-
nate function for `. The assumption A B C means, in part, that A, B, and C are three
distinct points, and therefore f .A/, f .B/, and f .C/ are three distinct real numbers. There-
fore, one of these numbers is between the other two. If, say, f .A/ were between f .B/ and
f .C/, then by deﬁnition we would also have B  A  C, which contradicts Hilbert’s be-
tweenness axiom. The same reasoning shows that f .C/ cannot be between f .A/ and
f .B/, so the only remaining possibility is that f .B/ is between f .A/ and f .C/.
□
Theorem 3.11 (Partial Converse to the Betweenness Theorem for Points). If A, B, and
C are three distinct collinear points such that AB CBC D AC, then AB C.
Proof. Suppose A, B, and C are distinct collinear points such that AB C BC D AC.
Exactly one of the three points lies between the other two. If C were between the other two,
then the betweenness of points theorem would imply AC C CB D AB. Therefore, both
equations in (3.2) hold, and the same argument as in the proof of Theorem 3.9 leads to a

contradiction. Similarly, assuming that A is between the other two leads to a contradiction,
so the only other possibility is that AB C.
□
Because of this theorem, some authors choose to deﬁne betweenness differently: one
can deﬁne A  B  C to mean that A, B, C are distinct collinear points such that AB C
BC D AC, and the previous theorem shows that this deﬁnition is equivalent to the one
we gave. The deﬁnition in terms of distances has the advantage that, unlike our deﬁnition,
it obviously does not depend on any choice of coordinate function for a line. We have
chosen the deﬁnition we did because it is much more closely connected to our intuitive
understanding of betweenness and because it is a deﬁnition commonly used in high-school
geometry texts.
The previous theorem is only a partial converse to the betweenness theorem because it
applies only when we know in advance that the three points are collinear. In fact, a stronger
version of the converse is true in neutral geometry as well: for any three distinct points A,
B, C, it is the case that AB CBC D AC if and only if AB C. The proof will have to
wait until later (see Corollary 5.20).
The next theorem gives a useful characterization of the points on a line in terms of
betweenness. It says, roughly speaking, that there are ﬁve possible locations for a point on
the line

AB D fP W P AB or P D A or AP B or P D B or AB P g:

Proof. For brevity, let S denote the set of points on the right-hand side of (3.3). By
deﬁnition of S, we have
P 2 S , P AB or P D A or AP B or P D B or AB P:
(3.4)
The theorem statement says that the two sets

AB and S are equal. Thus we have to prove
that each set is contained in the other (see Theorem G.1 in Appendix G and the discussion
preceding it).
First we show that

AB  S. Let P be an arbitrary point of
 !
AB . Then either P is
equal to one of the points A or B or it is not. If P D A or P D B, then P 2 S by (3.4). On
the other hand, if P is not equal to A or B, then the three points A, B, and P are distinct
(because we are also assuming A ¤ B), so Hilbert’s betweenness axiom guarantees that
one of the following holds: P AB, AP B, or AB P . In each case, (3.4) implies
again that P 2 S.
To show the reverse inclusion, assume P 2 S. This means that it satisﬁes one of the
ﬁve conditions in (3.4). If P D A or P D B, then P 2

other hand, if P satisﬁes one of the three betweenness relations, then P , A, and B are

B, and Theorem 2.28 guarantees that ` D

The deﬁnition of betweenness applies only to three distinct points; but in some cir-
cumstances it is useful to extend it to larger sets of points. If A1;A2;:::;Ak are k dis-
tinct points that all lie on a line `, we write A1  A2    Ak to mean that there is
some coordinate function f W` ! R such that either f .A1/ < f .A2/ <  < f .Ak/ or
f .A1/ > f .A2/ >  > f .Ak/.
The next lemma is an easy analogue of Theorem 3.7.
Lemma 3.13. If A1;A2;:::;Ak are distinct collinear points, then A1 A2 Ak if and
only if Ak A2 A1.
Proof. When translated into statements about coordinates, both statements mean the same
thing.
□
Theorem 3.14. Given any k distinct collinear points, they can be labeled A1;:::;Ak in
some order such that A1 A2  Ak.
Proof. Let ` be a line containing all k points, and let f W` ! R be a coordinate function
for `. The coordinates of the given points are k distinct real numbers, so they can be
arranged in a sequence from smallest to largest. Then we can just label the given points as
A1;:::;Ak, with the labels chosen so that f .A1/ < f .A2/ <  < f .Ak/.

f .C/, and p D f .P /. The hypothesis A  B  C implies a < b < c (because the other
inequality a > b > c would contradict our choice of f ). Because p is a real number, it
follows that one and only one of the following arrangements must hold: p D a, p D b,
p D c, p < a < b < c, a < p < b < c, a < b < p < c, a < b < c < p. Each of these
corresponds to one and only one of the relations in (3.5).

Theorem 3.16. Suppose A;B;C;D are four distinct points. If any of the following pairs
of conditions holds, then AB C D:

(3.6)
AB C and AC D
or
(3.7)
AB D and B C D:

On the other hand, if AB C D, then all of the following conditions are true:
AB C;
AB D;
AC D;
and
B C D:
(3.9)
Proof. Suppose A;B;C;D are distinct points and one of the hypotheses (3.6)–(3.8) holds.
In each case, it follows from the ﬁrst of the two hypotheses and the deﬁnition of between-
ness that three of the four points are collinear, and then it follows from the second hy-
pothesis that the fourth point also lies on the same line. Let ` be a line containing all four
points, and let f W` ! R be a coordinate function such that f .A/ < f .B/. Write a D f .A/,
b D f .B/, c D f .C/, and d D f .D/.

64
3. Axioms for Plane Geometry
Assume ﬁrst that (3.6) holds. Because AB C and a < b, it follows that a < b < c.
The assumption B  C  D implies that either b < c < d or b > c > d holds, but only
the ﬁrst is compatible with a < b < c. Thus we have a < b < c < d, which implies
AB C D.
Next, assume (3.7) holds. As before, this implies a < b < c and a < c < d, which
together imply a < b < c < d and therefore A  B  C  D. The argument for (3.8) is
similar.
To prove the second statement, just note that the assumption AB C D means that
there is some coordinate function f W
 !
AB ! R such that f .A/ < f .B/ < f .C/ < f .D/
(or the other way around), which implies immediately that any three of the four points
satisfy the conditions in (3.9).
□
Segments
Suppose A and B are two distinct points. We deﬁne the segment from A to B, denoted by
AB, to be the following set of points:
AB D

P W P D A or P D B or AP B

:
A segment is also sometimes called a line segment. In words, the segment AB is the set
comprising A and B and all points between them. It is obvious from the deﬁnition and the
symmetry of betweenness that AB D BA. We deﬁne the length of AB to be the distance
AB. We say two segments AB and CD are congruent, symbolized by AB Š CD, if they
have the same length:
AB Š CD
,
AB D CD:
We can extend the deﬁnition of parallelism to segments, but it is a bit more compli-
cated than the deﬁnition for lines. If AB and CD are segments, we say that AB and CD
are parallel if the lines containing them are parallel: AB k CD means that
 !
AB k
 !
CD .
Similarly, to say that a segment AB is parallel to a line ` is to say that
 !
AB k `. Note that
AB k CD is a more restrictive condition than simply saying that the two segments do not
intersect—for example, two segments can be disjoint without being parallel (see Fig. 3.4).
Parallel
Nonparallel
Fig. 3.4. Parallel and nonparallel segments.
The deﬁnition of a segment AB includes the stipulation that A and B are distinct
points, so every segment has positive length. The statement “AB is a segment” should be
understood as including the assertion that A and B are distinct, so it is short for “A and B
are distinct points and AB is the segment from A to B.” If A and B are points that have
already been introduced into the discussion, it is not meaningful to refer to AB until we
have veriﬁed that A and B are distinct.
The next lemma expresses an important relationship between segments and lines.

Lemma 3.17. If A and B are two distinct points, then AB 

The next theorem is our analogue of Euclid’s second postulate, which asserts that it is
possible “to produce a ﬁnite straight line continuously in a straight line.” Although Euclid
did not say precisely what he meant by “produce,” the way he actually uses the postulate
is by extending a segment to form a longer segment and choosing an arbitrary point on the
extended part. Our theorem makes this possibility explicit.
Theorem 3.18 (Segment Extension Theorem). If AB is any segment, there exist points
C;D 2
 !
AB such that C AB and AB D.
Proof. Given a segment AB, let f W
 !
AB ! R be a coordinate function such that f .A/ D 0
and f .B/ > 0, and let c and d be real numbers such that c < 0 and d > f .B/. Because
f is surjective, there are points C;D 2
 !
AB such that f .C/ D c and f .D/ D d. Because
f .C/ < f .A/ < f .B/ < f .D/ by construction, it follows that C  A  B and A  B 
D.
□
If AB is a segment, we deﬁne the endpoints of AB to be the points A and B, and the
interior points of AB to be all points in AB other than A and B. The set of all interior
points of AB is denoted by IntAB. (Thus P 2 IntAB if and only if AP B.)
This deﬁnition seems straightforward, but there is a subtlety to it that might not be
immediately evident. A segment is just a set of points in the plane, and there might be
different ways to express the same set of points that could lead to a different pair of points
being considered as the endpoints. To see why this is an issue, consider the analogous case
of lines: if we tried to deﬁne the “special points” of
 !
AB to be the points A and B, this
deﬁnition would not make sense, because someone else might designate the same line as
 !
CD for two completely different points C;D on the same line. Thus if we want to talk
about “the endpoints” of a segment, we need to show that there is a way to characterize
them that doesn’t depend on the notation we choose to use for the segment.
To this end, suppose S is a set of points in the plane. A point P 2 S is called a passing
point of S if there exist distinct points X;Y 2 S such that X P Y ; and P is called an
extreme point of S if it is not a passing point.
Lemma 3.19. Suppose S and T are sets of points in the plane with S  T . Every passing
point of S is also a passing point of T .
Proof. Assume P is a passing point of S. Then there are distinct points X;Y 2 S such
that X  P  Y . Since X and Y are also points of T , this shows that P is also a passing
point of T .
□
The next proof is rated PG. We won’t use this theorem or its corollary in any serious
way in the book, but we include it here to justify referring to “the endpoints” of a segment.
Theorem 3.20. Suppose A and B are distinct points. Then A and B are extreme points of
AB, and every other point of AB is a passing point.

66
3. Axioms for Plane Geometry
Proof. First we show that A is an extreme point. Suppose for the sake of contradiction
that it is a passing point. Then there exist distinct points X;Y 2 AB such that X AY .
Then it follows from Theorem 3.15 (together with the fact that A ¤ B) that B must satisfy
one of the following conditions: B  X  A  Y , B D X, X  B  A  Y , X  A  B  Y ,
B D Y , or X  A  Y  B. The ﬁrst three conditions imply B  A  Y , which contradicts
the fact that Y 2 AB; and the last three imply X AB, which contradicts X 2 AB. Thus
A must be an extreme point. A similar argument shows that B is also an extreme point.
Now suppose P is a point of AB other than A or B. Then by deﬁnition AP B, so
P is a passing point.
□
Thanks to Theorem 3.20, the endpoints of a segment are exactly its extreme points,
and these depend only on the segment, considered as a set of points in the plane, not on the
particular points used to deﬁne it. The next corollary makes this precise.
Corollary 3.21 (Consistency of Endpoints of Segments). Suppose A and B are distinct
points and C and D are distinct points, such that AB D CD. Then either A D C and
B D D, or A D D and B D C.
Proof. The preceding theorem shows that the set of extreme points of AB is equal to
fA;Bg, and because AB D CD, this set is also equal to fC;Dg. Thus fA;Bg D fC;Dg,
and the result follows.

Recall that in the Elements, Euclid stated ﬁve properties of magnitudes that he called
“common notions,” which he used when comparing line segments, angles, and areas (see
Chapter 1). The next theorem gives modern analogues of all ﬁve of Euclid’s common
notions as they apply to segments, in the order in which Euclid stated them. (Later we will
see how the common notions also apply to angle measures.)

Proof. Statements (a) and (d) are immediate consequences of the deﬁnition of congruence
together with familiar properties of equality. To prove (b), just note that under the given
hypotheses, the betweenness theorem for points and the deﬁnition of congruence imply
AC D AB CBC D A0B0 CB0C 0 D A0C 0:
The proof of (c) is similar.
Finally, to prove (e), assume that A;B;C are points such that A  B  C. By the
betweenness theorem for points and algebra, we have AC AB D BC, and by Theorem
3.6, BC > 0. By substitution, therefore, AC AB > 0, which implies AC > AB.

The next lemma relates the deﬁnition of a segment to coordinate functions.

if f .A/ > f .B/:
(3.11)
Proof. Let A and B be distinct points, and let f W
 !
AB ! R be a coordinate function for
 !
AB . First we prove (3.10). For this purpose, assume that f .A/ < f .B/. To prove that
the two given sets are equal, we have to show that each one is contained in the other. We
will prove ﬁrst that AB  fP 2
 !
AB W f .A/  f .P /  f .B/g, and then we will prove the
opposite inclusion.
Let P be a point in AB. By Lemma 3.17, this implies that P 2

AB . By deﬁnition
of a segment, the hypothesis means that P D A, P D B, or A  P  B. We consider
each case in turn. Assuming P D A, the fact that f is a well-deﬁned function implies
f .P / D f .A/. Together with our hypothesis that f .A/ < f .B/, this implies f .A/ 
f .P /  f .B/. Similarly, P D B implies f .P / D f .B/, which in turn implies f .A/ 
f .P /  f .B/. Finally, if AP B, then the consistency theorem for betweenness implies
that f .A/f .P /f .B/, which means either f .A/ < f .P / < f .B/ or f .A/ > f .P / >
f .B/. Since we have assumed that f .A/ < f .B/, only the ﬁrst set of inequalities can
occur, and again they imply f .A/  f .P /  f .B/. This completes the proof that AB 

Conversely, let P be a point in the right-hand set of (3.10); this means that P lies on

(3.12)
There are three possibilities: f .P / D f .A/, f .P / D f .B/, or f .P / is distinct from both
f .A/ and f .B/. In the ﬁrst case, injectivity of f implies P D A, so certainly P 2 AB.
Similarly, if f .P / D f .B/, then P D B, and again we conclude P 2 AB. Finally, if
f .P / is distinct from f .A/ and f .B/, then injectivity of f implies f .P / ¤ f .A/ and
f .P / ¤ f .B/. Thus the inequality (3.12) actually implies f .A/ < f .P / < f .B/, which
in turn implies AP B. Once again, we conclude that P 2 AB. This proves (3.10). The
proof of (3.11) is identical, but with the inequalities reversed.

Theorem 3.24. If A;B;C are points such that AB C, then the following set equalities
hold:
(a) AB [BC D AC.
(b) AB \BC D fBg.
Proof. Let A;B;C be points such that A  B  C, which implies in particular that they
are collinear. Let ` be the line containing A, B, and C, and let f W` ! R be a coordinate
function for ` such that f .A/ D 0 and f .C/ > 0. (The existence of such a function is
guaranteed by the ruler placement theorem.) Then the fact that A  B  C means that
f .A/ < f .B/ < f .C/.
First, we prove (a). This is an assertion that two sets are equal, so we need to prove
two things: every point in the left-hand set is also in the right-hand set, and vice versa.
Begin by assuming that P 2 AB [BC. This means that either P 2 AB or P 2 BC,
and in either case P 2 `. In the case that P 2 AB, Lemma 3.23 shows that f .A/ 
f .P /  f .B/, and then by transitivity of inequalities it follows that f .P / < f .C/. Thus
f .A/  f .P / < f .C/, which implies P 2 AC. A similar argument shows that P 2 BC
implies P 2 AC. Thus we have shown that AB [BC  AC.
Conversely, assume that P 2 AC. Then P 2 `, and Lemma 3.23 shows that f .A/ 
f .P /  f .C/. Now by the trichotomy law for real numbers, there are three cases: f .P / <
f .B/, f .P / D f .B/, or f .P / > f .B/. In the ﬁrst two cases, we have f .A/  f .P / 
f .B/ and thus P 2 AB. In the third case, f .B/ < f .P /  f .C/, which implies P 2 BC.
Thus AC  AB [BC, and we are done.
The proof of (b) is left to you (see Exercise 3E).
□
Corollary 3.25. If AB C, then AB  AC and BC  AC.
Proof. This follows immediately from the preceding theorem and the basic set-theoretic
facts that X  X [Y and Y  X [Y for any sets X and Y .

Midpoints
If P , A, and B are points, we say that P is equidistant from A and B if PA D PB.
Suppose AB is a segment. A point M is said to be a midpoint of AB if M is an interior
point of AB that is equidistant from A and B. If M is a midpoint of AB, we often say that
M bisects AB, and we also say that a segment or line bisects AB if it intersects AB only
at M.
The next lemma gives some useful alternative characterizations of midpoints.
Lemma 3.26. Let AB be a segment, and let M be a point. The following statements are
all equivalent to each other:
(a) M is a midpoint of AB (i.e., M 2 IntAB and MA D MB).
(b) M 2
 !
AB and MA D MB.
(c) M 2 AB and AM D 1
2AB.
Proof. We need to prove the equivalences (a) , (b), (b) , (c), and (c) , (a), which
amounts to six implications in all. In situations like this, it is not necessary to prove all
six implications, as long as we prove enough to allow us to conclude that any one of the

Segments
69
statements implies each of the others. In this case, we will prove (a) ) (b) ) (c) ) (a).
(Do you see why this sufﬁces?)
First, we prove (a) ) (b). Assume M is a midpoint of AB. Then by deﬁnition
MA D MB, and M 2 AB 
 !
AB , so (b) holds.
Next we prove (b) ) (c). Suppose M is a point on
 !
AB such that MA D MB. By
Theorem 3.12, one of the following ﬁve things must be true: M AB, M D A, AM 
B, M D B, or A B M. If M AB, then the theorem on the whole segment greater
than the part implies that MB > MA, which contradicts the hypothesis; similarly AB 
M implies AM > BM, which is also a contradiction. In each of the remaining cases,
M 2 AB, which is one of the conclusions we need to prove. Now if M D A or M D B,
then one of the distances MA or MB is zero and the other is positive, again contradicting
the hypothesis, so the only remaining possibility is AM B. The betweenness theorem
then implies AM C MB D AB. Substituting AM for MB in this equation, we obtain
2AM D AB, which implies AM D 1
2AB.
Finally, we prove (c) ) (a). Suppose M is a point in AB such that AM D 1
2AB.
Because AB is a segment and thus AB > 0, our assumption implies 0 < AM < AB. If
M D A, then AM D 0, which is a contradiction, and if M D B, then AM D AB, which
is also a contradiction; so M is an interior point of AB. Then the betweenness theorem
yields
AM CMB D AB D 2AM:
Subtracting AM from both sides, we conclude that MB D AM, and therefore M is a
midpoint of AB.

In his Proposition I.10, Euclid proved that every segment has a midpoint by show-
ing that it can be constructed using compass and straightedge. For us, the existence and
uniqueness of midpoints can be proved more straightforwardly using the ruler postulate.
Theorem 3.27 (Existence and Uniqueness of Midpoints). Every segment has a unique
midpoint.
Proof. Let AB be a segment. We must prove two things: existence (AB has at least one
midpoint) and uniqueness (AB has at most one midpoint).
To prove existence, let f W
 !
AB ! R be a coordinate function for
 !
AB such that f .A/ D
0 and f .B/ > 0; such a function exists by the ruler placement theorem. If we write b D
f .B/, then the ruler postulate implies that
AB D jf .B/f .A/j D jb 0j D b:
Because f is bijective, there is a unique point M 2
 !
AB such that f .M/ D 1
2b. We will
show that M is a midpoint of AB. First, because 0 < 1
2b < b, Lemma 3.23 shows that M
lies on AB. Next, the ruler postulate and a little algebra show that
AM D jf .M/f .A/j D
 1
2b 0
 D 1
2b D 1
2AB:
Therefore, it follows from Lemma 3.26 that M is a midpoint of AB.
To prove uniqueness, suppose that M 0 is another midpoint of AB. By Lemma 3.26,
AM 0 D 1
2AB D 1
2b:
(3.13)

3. Axioms for Plane Geometry
Using the same coordinate function f as above, let m0 D f .M 0/. Because M 0 lies on AB
(by deﬁnition of a midpoint), we have 0  m0  b by Lemma 3.26, so the ruler postulate
gives
AM 0 D
f .M 0/f .A/
 D
m0 0
 D m0:
(3.14)
Comparing (3.13) and (3.14), we see that f .M 0/ D m0 D 1
2b D f .M/. Because f is
injective, it follows that M 0 D M, and uniqueness is proved.
□
You might wonder why we needed the last paragraph of this proof—didn’t we already
show in the second paragraph that M is unique when we wrote “there is a unique point M 2
 !
AB such that f .M/ D 1
2b”? The answer is that, although the ruler postulate guarantees
that there is a unique point M such that f .M/ D 1
2b, this is not precisely the same as
saying there is a unique midpoint M, for the simple reason that neither the deﬁnition of
midpoint nor Lemma 3.26 says anything whatsoever about what f .M/ is supposed to be.
In order to turn this idea into a proof that M is the only midpoint, we have to show that
every midpoint must satisfy f .M/ D 1
2b for this coordinate function, which is essentially
what we did in the last paragraph. In general, when you are asked to prove existence and
uniqueness of something, the safest course is usually to write two separate proofs, one for
existence and one for uniqueness.
It is also important to understand why we need to prove the existence of the midpoint
of AB, when we have not bothered to prove the existence of other geometric objects such
as the segment AB itself. The reason is that just deﬁning an object does not, in itself,
ensure that such an object exists. For example, we might have deﬁned “the closest point to
A in the interior of AB” to be the point in IntAB whose distance to A is smaller than that
of every other point in the interior of AB. This is a perfectly unambiguous deﬁnition, but
unfortunately there is no such point, just as there is no “smallest positive real number.” If
we wish to talk about “the midpoint” of a segment, we have to prove that it exists.
On the other hand, when we deﬁne a set of points, as long as the deﬁnition stipulates
unambiguously what it means for a point to be in that set, then the set exists. Thus the
deﬁnition of the segment AB needs no further elaboration, because it yields a perfectly
well-deﬁned set. Of course, if we are not careful, we might inadvertently deﬁne a set
only to discover that it is empty. Thus in order to be sure that the deﬁnition of a segment
describes something interesting, we might wish to verify that segments contain plenty of
points. The next theorem guarantees that they do.
Theorem 3.28. Every segment contains inﬁnitely many distinct points.
Proof. Let AB be a segment, and let f W
 !
AB ! R be a coordinate function such that
f .A/ D 0 and f .B/ > 0. Let b D f .B/. For each positive integer n, there is a point Xn 2
 !
AB such that f .Xn/ D b=n. Because f is a well-deﬁned function, the points fX1;X2;:::g
are all distinct; and because 0 < b=n  b, Lemma 3.23 shows that Xn 2 AB for each n.
□
Since Euclid gave circles a prominent place in his postulates, we might ask similar
questions about them. We deﬁne a circle to be a set consisting of all points whose distance
from a given point is equal to a given positive number. The given point is called the center
of the circle, and the given distance is called its radius. If O is any point and r is any
positive number, the circle with center O and radius r is denoted by C.O;r/; thus
C.O;r/ D fP W OP D rg:
(3.15)

Rays
71
Euclid’s Postulate 3 asserted that it is possible to describe a circle with any center and
any radius. Here is our version of that postulate.
Theorem 3.29 (Euclid’s Postulate 3). Given two distinct points O and A, there exists a
circle whose center is O and whose radius is OA.
Proof. Let O and A be distinct points, and let r D OA. Since O and A are distinct, r is a
positive number, so C.O;r/ is a well-deﬁned set described by (3.15).
□
Exercise 3H shows that every circle, like every segment, contains inﬁnitely many
points.
Rays
Given distinct points A and B, we deﬁne the ray from A through B (Fig. 3.6), denoted
by
!
AB , to be the set
!

Intuitively, this is the point A together with all of the points in the same half of

!a ;
!b ;
!c ,
!r ;
!s ;
!t . In this case, we use the notation
 !
r to denote the line containing
!r . To
say “
!r is a ray” is to say that there are two distinct points A and B such that
!r D
!
AB .
The point A is called the endpoint or starting point of
!
AB , and any point on the ray other
than A is called an interior point of
!
AB . We use the notation Int
!
AB to denote the set of
all interior points of
!
AB ; thus P 2 Int
!
AB if and only if AP B or P D B or AB P .
Just as with lines and segments, the notation
!
AB has meaning only if A and B are distinct,
and a statement such as “
!
AB is a ray” is understood to mean “A and B are distinct points
and
!
AB is the ray from A through B.”
The endpoint of a ray, like the endpoints of a segment, doesn’t depend on what notation
we use to denote the ray; we will prove this below (see Corollary 3.41).
Just as we did with segments, we can extend the deﬁnition of parallelism to include
rays. If
!r is a ray and S is a line or a segment or another ray, to say that
!r is parallel to
S means that the line
 !
r is parallel to the line containing S.
The next lemma gives a useful criterion for deciding when a point is not on a ray.
Lemma 3.30. Suppose A and B are distinct points and P is a point on the line
 !
AB . Then
P …
!
AB if and only if P AB.
Proof. Let A and B be distinct points and let P 2
 !
AB be arbitrary. Theorem 3.12 shows
that one of the ﬁve relations in (3.4) must hold. If P …
!
AB , then four of the conditions
are ruled out by the deﬁnition of
!
AB , so the only remaining possibility is P  A  B.

Conversely, if P  A  B, then by deﬁnition of betweenness, P ¤ A and P ¤ B, and by
Hilbert’s betweenness axiom, neither AP B nor AB P holds; thus P …

Be sure to observe the distinction between the notations AB,
!
AB , and
 !
AB , which all
designate sets of points in the plane, and the notation AB, which designates a real number
(the distance from A to B, or the length of the segment AB).
The next lemma is the analogue for rays of Lemma 3.23.
Lemma 3.32 (Coordinate Representation of a Ray). Suppose A and B are distinct

The preceding lemma is most useful when used in combination with the ruler place-
ment theorem, which allows us to choose our coordinate function judiciously for a given
ray. If A and B are distinct points, let us say that a coordinate function f W
 !
AB ! R is
adapted to the ray
!
AB if f .A/ D 0 and f .B/ > 0. (If the ray is designated only by a
single letter, as in
!a , then to say that the coordinate function is adapted to
!a just means
that it sends the endpoint of the ray to zero and a point in the interior of the ray to a pos-
itive number.) The ruler placement theorem says that for every ray, there is an adapted
coordinate function.
Lemma 3.33 (Representation of a Ray in Adapted Coordinates). Suppose A and B are
distinct points and f W
 !
AB ! R is a coordinate function adapted to
!
AB . If P is any point
on

AB , then P 2
!
AB if and only if f .P /  0, and P 2 Int
!
AB if and only if f .P / > 0.

Proof. Given the hypotheses, it follows from Lemma 3.32 that P 2
!
AB if and only if
f .P /  f .A/, and since f .A/ D 0, this is equivalent to f .P /  0. This proves the ﬁrst
statement.
To prove the second statement, assume ﬁrst that P 2 Int
!
AB . Then f .P /  0 by the
previous argument, and in addition P ¤ A, which implies f .P / ¤ f .A/ because f is
injective. It follows that f .P / > 0. Conversely, assume that f .P / > 0. The argument
in the previous paragraph shows that P 2
!
AB , and P cannot be equal to A because then
f .P / D f .A/ D 0 would contradict our assumption. Thus P 2 Int

This relationship between coordinate functions and rays allows us to prove some im-
portant properties of points on rays. The next lemma is an extremely useful partial converse
to Theorem 3.22(e) (the whole segment is greater than the part). Note that the actual con-
verse to that theorem is not true, because AC > AB does not imply A  B  C even if
A;B;C are assumed to be collinear (see Fig. 3.8). However, if we assume in addition that
B and C are in the “same direction from A” (or, more precisely, that they are interior points
of the same ray starting at A), then we can conclude the converse implication (Fig. 3.9).

Lemma 3.34 (Ordering Lemma for Points). Suppose
!a is a ray starting at a point A,
and B and C are interior points of
!a such that AC > AB. Then AB C.
Proof. Let
!a be a ray starting at A, and let B;C be points in Int
!a such that AC > AB.
Let f W
 !
a ! R be a coordinate function adapted to
!a . Then Lemma 3.33 shows that
f .B/ > 0 and f .C/ > 0. By deﬁnition of a coordinate function, therefore,
AC D jf .C/f .A/j D jf .C/0j D f .C/I
AB D jf .B/f .A/j D jf .B/0j D f .B/:
Our hypothesis therefore implies that f .C/ > f .B/, and because f .A/ D 0 we have
f .C/ > f .B/ > f .A/. Thus AB C by deﬁnition of betweenness.
□
One of the most basic constructions in Euclidean geometry is marking off a segment
of a certain predetermined length along a ray. Euclid justiﬁes this with his Proposition I.3,
which says that given two segments, it is possible “to cut off from the greater a straight line
equal to the less.” The next theorem is our analogue of that proposition. There are several
differences, however: ﬁrst, we do not need to assume that we already have a segment of the
desired length to use as a model; giving a number that is to be the length of the new segment
is sufﬁcient. (Euclid, of course, could not state his proposition this way because he did not
use numbers to measure lengths.) Second, whereas Euclid has to start with a segment that
is already longer than the model segment, our concept of a ray extending inﬁnitely far in
one direction frees us from having to worry about how long the initial segment is. The
proof of this theorem is very similar to that of the theorem on existence and uniqueness of
midpoints.

Theorem 3.35 (Segment Construction Theorem). Suppose
!a is a ray starting at a point
A and r is a positive real number. Then there exists a unique point C in the interior of

Proof. Exercise 3J.
□
The uniqueness part of this theorem is extremely important in its own right and is
often used on its own without the existence part. For this reason, it is worth restating as a
separate corollary.
Corollary 3.36 (Unique Point Theorem). Suppose
!a is a ray starting at a point A, and
C and C 0 are points in Int
!a such that AC D AC 0. Then C D C 0.

rays are said to be collinear rays if there is a line that contains both of them, and they are
said to be opposite rays if they have the same endpoint and their union is a line. The next
proof is rated PG, not because the steps are terribly hard, but because it could end up being
a lot of work if the parts are proved in a different order from the one given here.
Theorem 3.38 (Rays with the Same Endpoint). Suppose
!
AB and
!
AC are rays with the

(a) If A, B, and C are collinear, then
!
AB and

AC are collinear.
(b) If
!
AB and

AC are collinear, then they are either equal or opposite, but not both.

AC are opposite rays if and only if C AB.
Proof. The assumption that
!
AB and

AC are rays means, in particular, that neither B nor
C is equal to A (but B could be equal to C). Let f W
 !
AB ! R be a coordinate function
adapted to
!
AB . We will use this coordinate function in several of the arguments below.
First we will prove (a). Suppose A, B, and C are collinear, which means there is a
line ` containing all of them. Since the distinct points A and B both lie on `, it follows
from Theorem 2.28 that ` D

Next we will prove (b). Assume
!
AB and
!
AC are collinear. The hypothesis implies
that C 2
 !
AB , so we can consider the real number f .C/, where f is the coordinate function
introduced in the ﬁrst paragraph. Because C ¤ A, we see that f .C/ ¤ 0. Thus either
f .C/ > 0 or f .C/ < 0, but not both. On the one hand, if f .C/ > 0, Lemma 3.32 shows
that
!
AC D fP 2

so the rays are equal. On the other hand, suppose f .C/ < 0. We will prove that

AB . To prove the reverse inclusion,
let P 2
 !
AB be arbitrary. If f .P /  0, then (3.18) shows P 2
!
AB ; while if f .P / < 0,
then (3.19) shows that P 2
!
AC . In either case P 2
!
AB [
!
AC as claimed. Thus the union
of
!
AB and
!
AC is a line, which means by deﬁnition that they are opposite rays.
To prove (c), suppose
!
AB and
!
AC are opposite rays. Arguing as in the preceding
paragraph, we conclude that f .C/ < 0 (since otherwise
!
AB and
!
AC would be equal, not
opposite), and therefore Lemma 3.32 shows that
!
AB and
!
AC are described by formulas
(3.18) and (3.19), respectively. A point P is in both sets if and only if f .P / D 0, which is
true if and only if P D A; thus
!
AB \
!
AC D fAg. The argument in the preceding paragraph
shows that
!
AB [
!
AC D

AC .
Next we prove (d). Obviously, if
!
AB and
!
AC are equal, they have lots of interior
points in common. Conversely, suppose they have an interior point in common, say P .
Since P is not equal to A, it follows that both lines
 !
AB and
 !
AC contain the two distinct
points P and A, so they must be the same line. Thus
!
AB and
!
AC are collinear, so part (b)
shows that they must be equal or opposite. If they were opposite, they would have only A
in common by part (c), so in fact they are equal.
Finally, we prove (e). Suppose ﬁrst that
!
AB and
!
AC are opposite rays. By (c), the
only point they have in common is A, so in particular C …
!
AB . By Lemma 3.30, this
implies C AB. Conversely, if C AB, then Lemma 3.30 shows that C …

two rays cannot be equal and thus are opposite.
□
Theorem 3.39 (Opposite Ray Theorem). Every ray has a unique opposite ray.
Proof. Let
!
AB be a ray. By the segment extension theorem, there exists a point C such
that C AB. Then
!
AC is opposite to
!
AB by Theorem 3.38(e). This proves existence.
To prove uniqueness, suppose that
!
AC 0 is another ray that is opposite to
!
AB ; we will
show that
!
AC 0 is equal to the ray
!
AC we constructed above. Theorem 3.38(e) shows that
C 0  A  B, which means that C 0 lies on
 !
AB . Note that

AB D
!
AC [
!

3.38(c), so C 0 lies either on

AC . Now, the fact that C 0  A  B implies that
C 0 …
!
AB (by Lemma 3.30), so C 0 2

ray. Then it follows from Theorem 3.38(d) that

AC 0 D

Now we can prove that the endpoint of a ray is well deﬁned and does not depend on
the choice of points used to deﬁne the ray. The proof is based on the following theorem.

which implies X  A  B  Y and therefore X  A  B. In each case, we have X  A  B,
which implies X 62
!

Next we’ll show that every other point of

Plane Separation
We are now ready for our next postulate. This one gives crucial information about how
segments and lines intersect.
Postulate 6 (The Plane Separation Postulate). For any line `, the set of all points
not on ` is the union of two disjoint subsets called the sides of `. If A and B are distinct
points not on `, then A and B are on the same side of ` if and only if AB \` D ¿.
If ` is a line and A;B are points not on `, then we say A and B lie on opposite sides
of ` if they do not lie on the same side. Here are some easy consequences of the plane
separation postulate.
Theorem 3.43 (Properties of Sides of Lines). Suppose ` is a line.
(a) Both sides of ` are nonempty sets.
(b) If A and B are distinct points not on `, then A and B are on opposite sides of ` if and
only if AB \` ¤ ¿.

Fig. 3.13. A and B are on opposite sides of `.
Proof. We prove (b) ﬁrst. Given two distinct points A;B that do not lie on `, the plane
separation postulate yields two implications: if A and B are on the same side of `, then
AB \` D ¿, and if AB \` D ¿, then A and B are on the same side. Taking the contra-
positives of these two implications shows that AB \ ` ¤ ¿ if and only if A and B lie on
opposite sides of `.
Now we prove (a). By Theorem 2.33, there is a point A … `, and by Theorem 3.1,
there is a point C 2 `. By Euclid’s segment extension theorem, there is a point B 2
 !
AC
such that A  C  B. Because the two lines ` and
 !
AC are distinct, they meet only at C,
so neither A nor B lies on `. Since C 2 AB \ `, it follows from (b) that A and B lie on
opposite sides of `. Thus both sides are nonempty.
□
The plane separation postulate serves several purposes. First of all, this is the postulate
that ensures that we are really talking about the geometry of a plane and not the geometry
of three-dimensional (or even higher-dimensional) space. To see why three-dimensional
geometry cannot satisfy the plane separation postulate, just imagine a line in space—you
will see very quickly that there is no way to divide all the points not on the line into two
disjoint subsets such that two points are in the same subset if and only if the line segment
between them intersects the line.
More importantly, the plane separation postulate gives an explicit axiomatic justiﬁ-
cation for a whole raft of “geometrically obvious” facts that Euclid often assumed from
diagrams without comment. Many of these follow from the fact that every line has exactly
two distinct sides. Thus if ` is a line and A;B;C are points not on `, we can draw the
following conclusions from the plane separation postulate:
 If A and B are on the same side of ` and B and C are also on the same side, then A
and C are on the same side, so AC does not intersect `.
 If A and B are on opposite sides of ` and B and C are also on opposite sides, then A
and C are on the same side, so AC does not intersect `.
 If A and B are on opposite sides while B and C are on the same side, then A and C
are on opposite sides and thus AC intersects `.
If ` is a line, either of the sides of ` is called an open half-plane. The union of an open
half-plane together with the line that determines it is called a closed half-plane. If ` is a
line and A is a point not on `, we use the notation OHP.`;A/ to denote the open half-plane
consisting of all points on the same side of ` as A (Fig. 3.14) and CHP.`;A/ to denote the

Chapter 4
Angles
After lines, segments, and rays, the next most important ﬁgures in plane geometry are
angles. The purpose of this chapter is to give the deﬁnition of angles and establish their
basic properties.
There are a number of relationships involving angles that appear “obvious” in dia-
grams and which Euclid took for granted. In order to be conﬁdent that our theorems follow
logically from the axioms without relying on our geometric intuition, we have to be sure to
prove all such relationships. Because of this, many of the proofs in this chapter are rather
technical. The payoff for this effort will come in the next chapter when we start discussing
triangles, and we can freely use the relationships that have been rigorously proved in this
chapter.
Angles
We deﬁne an angle to be a union of two rays with the same endpoint (Fig. 4.1). If the two
rays are denoted by
!a and
!b , then the angle formed by their union is denoted by †ab; if
they are denoted by
!
OA and
!
OB , then the angle is denoted by †AOB. (Which notation
we use will usually depend on whether we need to refer individually to points on the rays.)
The common endpoint is called the vertex of the angle, and the two rays are called its sides.

4. Angles
Our deﬁnition of †ab allows for the possibility that the rays
!a and
!b are collinear.
If they are, Theorem 3.38(b) shows that there are two cases: either
!a and
!b are opposite
rays, in which case †ab is called a straight angle, or they are the same ray, in which case
†ab is called a zero angle (see Fig. 4.2). An angle formed by two noncollinear rays (i.e.,
an angle that is neither a straight angle nor a zero angle) is called a proper angle. It follows
from Theorem 3.38(a) that †AOB is a proper angle if and only if the three points A;O;B
are noncollinear. For most purposes, we will restrict our attention to proper angles. But in
some cases it is useful to allow more general angles, so without further qualiﬁcation, the
term “angle” can mean any of the above types.
It is important to be aware that an angle is a set of points in the plane—the union of
two rays—not a number of degrees. Thus for two angles to be equal means that they are
both literally the same set of points. For example, †ab D †ba, because both notations
designate exactly the same union of rays. Also, if A0 is any interior point of
!
OA and B0 is
any interior point of
!
OB , then †A0OB0 D †AOB, thanks to Theorem 3.38(d). As a set of
points, a straight angle is the same thing as a line, while a zero angle is just a ray.
Just as we did for endpoints of segments and rays, we must verify that our deﬁnition
of the vertex of an angle does not depend on the notation we choose to designate the angle.
For a proper angle, the next theorem shows how the vertex can be distinguished from all
other points.
Theorem 4.1. If †ab is a proper angle, then the common endpoint of
!a and
!b is the only
extreme point of †ab.
Proof. Suppose †ab is a proper angle, and let O denote the common endpoint of
!a and
!b . If P is any point in †ab other than O, then P is either an interior point of
!a or an
interior point of
!b ; without loss of generality, let us say P 2 Int
!a . Then it follows from
Theorem 3.40 that P is a passing point of
!a , and thus by Lemma 3.19 it is also a passing
point of †ab.
To show that O is an extreme point, suppose for contradiction that it is not. Then
there are points X;Y 2 †ab such that X  O  Y . Since neither X nor Y is an endpoint
of
!a or
!b , they must both be interior points of their respective rays. If X and Y were
interior points of different rays, say X 2 Int
!a and Y 2 Int
!b , then it would follow from
Theorem 3.38(d) that
!a D
!
OX and
!b D
!
OY and from Theorem 3.38(a) that
!a and
!b
were collinear, contradicting the assumption that †ab is a proper angle. Thus both points
must lie in the same ray, say
!a . But Theorem 3.40 shows that O is an extreme point of
!a ,
so this is impossible.
□
Corollary 4.2 (Consistency of Vertices of Proper Angles). If †AOB and †A0O0B0 are
equal proper angles, then O D O0.
Proof. Theorem 4.1 shows that O is the only extreme point of †AOB and O0 is the only
extreme point of †A0O0B0, so the fact that †AOB D †A0O0B0 implies O D O0.
□
Notice that Theorem 4.1 and Corollary 4.2 only apply to vertices of proper angles.
Because a zero angle is just a ray, its vertex is its endpoint, which is well deﬁned by
Corollary 3.41. However, there is no such result concerning the vertex of a straight angle:
if †AOB and †A0O0B0 are straight angles with †AOB D †A0O0B0, then O and O0 could
be any two different points on the line
 !
AB . For convenience, if †AOB is a straight angle,

Angles
85
we will still sometimes refer to O as its “vertex,” but we have to remember that which
point is called the vertex depends on which rays we use to designate the straight angle.
In order to speak about the size of an angle, we need to introduce the concept of
angle measure. In our approach to plane geometry, the measure of an angle, like the
distance between points, is a primitive term. Its meaning will be captured in the next two
postulates. Many features of angle measures are closely analogous to features of distances;
our treatment is designed to highlight those analogies. We begin with a postulate about
angles that corresponds to the distance postulate.
Postulate 7 (The Angle Measure Postulate). For every angle †ab, the measure of
†ab is a real number in the closed interval Œ0;180 determined by †ab.
We use the notation m†ab to denote the measure of †ab (or m†AOB if the angle
is designated by three points). If this measure is equal to the real number x, we write
m†ab D xı and say that †ab measures x degrees. Technically speaking, an angle mea-
sure is just a real number, so xı and x both stand for the same real number; the degree
symbol is placed there traditionally as a reminder that we are measuring angles on a scale
of 0 to 180. Of course, as you are aware from calculus, it is possible to measure angles
using other scales such as radians; if radian measure is desired, one can just modify this
postulate and the next by replacing the number 180 with . Since high-school geometry
courses use degrees exclusively, we will stick with them.
The next postulate is analogous to the ruler postulate. In order to state it concisely, we
make the following deﬁnition. If
!r is a ray starting at a point O and P is a point not on
the line
 !
r , the half-rotation of rays determined by
!r and P, denoted by HR.
!r ;P /, is
the set whose elements are all the rays that start at O and are contained in the closed half-
plane CHP.
 !
r ;P / (see Fig. 4.3). It follows from the deﬁnition that HR.
!r ;P / contains the
following rays:
 the ray
!r ;
 the ray opposite
!r ;
 every ray starting at O and lying on the same side of
 !
r as P .
If
!a is another ray starting at O and not collinear with
!r , sometimes for convenience we
will use the notation HR
!r ;
!a

to denote the half-rotation determined by
!r and any point
on the same side of
!r as the ray
!a .
It is important to understand clearly that a half-rotation is a set of rays, not a set of
points. (If we took the union of all the rays in HR.
!r ;P /, we would get a set of points,
namely CHP.
 !
r ;P /; but that is not what a half-rotation refers to.)
Postulate 8 (The Protractor Postulate). For every ray
!r and every point P not on
 !
r , there is a bijective function gWHR.
!r ;P / ! Œ0;180 that assigns the number 0 to
!r and the number 180 to the ray opposite
!r and such that if
!a and
!b are any two
rays in HR.

Theorem 4.3 (Properties of Angle Measures). Suppose †ab is any angle.
(a) m†ab D m†ba.
(b) m†ab D 0ı if and only if †ab is a zero angle.
(c) m†ab D 180ı if and only if †ab is a straight angle.
(d) 0ı < m†ab < 180ı if and only if †ab is a proper angle.
Proof. Let HR.
!r ;P / be any half-rotation containing both of the rays
!a and
!b , and let
gWHR.
!r ;P / ! Œ0;180 be a coordinate function for it starting at
!r . The protractor postu-
late says that m†ab is given by (4.1). Because this formula gives the same value when
!a
and
!b are interchanged, it follows that m†ab D m†ba; this proves (a). (This can also be
proved simply by noting that the notations †ab and †ba denote exactly the same angle—
i.e., the same set of points—and the measure is completely determined by the angle.)
If †ab is a zero angle, then
!a D
!b , so g.
!a / D g!b  because g is a well-deﬁned
function of rays. Thus m†ab D 0ı by (4.1). Conversely, if m†ab D 0ı, then (4.1) shows
that g.

; since g is injective, this implies that
!a D

To prove (c), suppose ﬁrst that m†ab D 180ı. Assume without loss of generality that
g.

!a and

!a D
!r . Because
g assigns the number 180 only to the ray opposite
!r , it follows that
!a and
!b are opposite
rays, which means that †ab is a straight angle.
Conversely, suppose †ab is a straight angle. To show that m†ab D 180ı, it is easiest
to work with a specially chosen half-rotation. If we choose any point P …
 !
a , then both of
the rays
!a and
!b are contained in HR.

this half-rotation starting at
!a , then g.
!a / D 0 and g!b  D 180, so (4.1) gives m†ab D
180ı.
Finally, (d) follows from the previous two parts, because they show that 0ı < m†ab <
180ı if and only if †ab is neither a zero angle nor a straight angle, which is the case if and
only if it is proper.
□
Part (a) of the preceding theorem illustrates an important feature of our approach to
angles: in contrast to the treatment of angles in trigonometry and calculus, we don’t use
positive and negative signs to distinguish between “clockwise” and “counterclockwise”
angle measures. (In fact, it is not even clear what meanings could be assigned to those
words in the context of our axiomatic system.) Also, we restrict our angle measures to be
less than or equal to 180ı. For situations in which we need to consider angle measures
larger than 180ı, we make the following deﬁnition. Suppose †ab is an angle. We deﬁne
the reﬂex measure of †ab (see Fig. 4.4), denoted by rm†ab, to be the number
rm†ab D 360ı m†ab:
We will sometimes call m†ab the standard measure of †ab to distinguish it from the

reﬂex measure. (The word reﬂex is derived from the Latin word for “bent back.” Many
high-school textbooks deﬁne a “reﬂex angle” to be an angle whose measure is greater than
180ı. However, that terminology would be inconsistent with our deﬁnitions because the
angle †ab is the same union of two rays whether we are interested in its reﬂex measure or
its standard measure. This is why we have adopted the convention that one angle can have
two different types of measure.)
In addition to straight angles, zero angles, and proper angles, there are some other
special types of angles that are deﬁned in terms of their measures. We say that an angle
†ab is a right angle if m†ab D 90ı, it is an acute angle if 0ı < m†ab < 90ı, and it is a an
obtuse angle if 90ı < m†ab < 180ı. Two angles †ab and †cd are said to be congruent,
written †ab Š †cd, if they have the same measure:
†ab Š †cd
,
m†ab D m†cd:
Note that we say two angles are congruent if their measures are equal. To say that two
angles are equal is to say that they are exactly the same angle.
The next theorem is our version of Euclid’s Postulate 4.
Theorem 4.4 (Euclid’s Postulate 4). All right angles are congruent.
Proof. Any two right angles have the same measure, which means by deﬁnition that they
are congruent.
□
The next theorem is one of the most important consequences of the protractor postu-
late. It is analogous to Euclid’s Proposition I.23 but is proved in a very different way.
Theorem 4.5 (Angle Construction Theorem). Let O be a point, let
!a be a ray starting
at O, and let x be a real number such that 0 < x < 180. On each side of
 !
a , there is a
unique ray
!b starting at O such that m†ab D x.
Proof. Let O,

P be a point on the chosen side. Let g be a coordinate function for HR.

Betweenness of Rays

Observe that just having a common side is not sufﬁcient for two angles to be adjacent: in
Fig. 4.7, the two angles †ab and †bc share the common side
!b , but they are not adjacent
because
!a and
!c are not on opposite sides of
 !
b .
!a
!b
!c
Fig. 4.7. †ab and †bc are nonadjacent angles sharing a common side.
The next theorem shows that one way to form adjacent angles is to place the common
ray between the other two. This corresponds to the situation in Fig. 4.6(b).
Theorem 4.12. If
!a ,
!b , and
!c are rays such that
!a 
!b 
!c , then †ab and †bc are
adjacent angles.
Proof. By the hypothesis, the angles †ab and †bc share the common side
!b , so we need
only show that
!a and
!c are on opposite sides of
 !
b . Since the deﬁnition of betweenness
of rays includes the stipulation that no two of the rays
!a ,
!b , and
!c are collinear, it follows
that neither
!a nor
!c is contained in
 !
b . By the Y-lemma, therefore,
!a and
!c are either
on opposite sides of
 !
b or on the same side. Assume for the sake of contradiction that they
are on the same side. It then follows from the deﬁnition of a half-rotation that
!a ,
!b , and
!c
all lie in the half-rotation HR

D 0 while g.
!a / and g.
!c / are both positive, this is impossible. Thus our assumption
is false, and
!a and
!c must be on opposite sides of
 !
b .
□
As Fig. 4.6 suggests, the converse of the preceding theorem is false: two angles can
be adjacent without any of the rays being between the other two. In Fig. 4.6(a), none of
the three rays is between the other two because two of the rays are collinear; while in Fig.
4.6(c), the same is true because there is no half-rotation that contains all three rays. (We
will prove a partial converse below; see Lemma 4.26.)
Because none of the rays is between the other two, the betweenness theorem for rays
does not apply in cases (a) and (c) of Fig. 4.6. However, for case (a), there is a simple
substitute for the betweenness theorem. (We’ll address case (c) later in this chapter.) First
we need to introduce some more terminology.
Two proper angles †ab and †cd are said to be supplementary if m†ab Cm†cd D
180ı and complementary if m†ab Cm†cd D 90ı.
Theorem 4.13. Supplements of congruent angles are congruent, and complements of con-
gruent angles are congruent.
Proof. Suppose †ab is supplementary to †cd and †a0b0 is supplementary to †c0d 0, and
assume that †cd Š †c0d 0. Then
m†ab D 180ı m†cd D 180ı m†c0d 0 D m†a0b0:

92
4. Angles
Therefore, †ab Š †a0b0. The same argument works for complements of congruent angles,
with 180ı replaced by 90ı.
□
Two angles form a linear pair if they are both proper, they share a common side, and
their nonshared sides are opposite rays. (It then follows from the X-lemma that their non-
shared sides are on opposite sides of the line through the shared side, so they are adjacent.)
For example, in Fig. 4.6(a), if we are given that
!a and
!c are opposite rays, then †ab and
†bc form a linear pair. The next theorem is the analogue of Euclid’s Proposition I.13, but
our proof is different, being based on the protractor postulate.
Theorem 4.14 (Linear Pair Theorem). If two angles form a linear pair, then they are
supplementary.

postulate, there is a coordinate function g for this half-rotation satisfying g.

!a and
!c are not collinear with
!b , it follows that
!b is not equal to either
!a or
!c , and therefore
0 < x < 180. Thus
m†ab D jx 0j D x;
m†bc D j180xj D 180x:
Adding these two equations yields the result.
□
Euclid’s deﬁnition of a right angle, translated into modern terminology, is any angle
that forms a linear pair with another angle that is congruent to it. For us, the statement that
any such angle is a right angle is the following corollary to the linear pair theorem.
Corollary 4.15. If two angles in a linear pair are congruent, then they are both right
angles.
Proof. If two congruent angles form a linear pair, their measures add up to 180ı by the
linear pair theorem. Since the measures are equal, they must both be 90ı.
□
Note that the converse to the linear pair theorem is certainly not true, because two
angles can be supplementary without being adjacent. However, if we add the hypothesis
that the angles are adjacent as well as supplementary, then we obtain the following par-
tial converse. It is Euclid’s Proposition I.14, with essentially the same proof (except that
we express angle comparisons in terms of degree measures). Notice how the unique ray
theorem is used in the proof; this technique will reappear frequently.

Proof. Suppose †ab and †bc are adjacent supplementary angles that share the common

!c 0 be the ray opposite
!a . Then †ab and †bc0 do in fact form a linear pair
by deﬁnition. Thus m†ab C m†bc0 D 180ı by the linear pair theorem. By hypothesis,
we also have the equation m†ab C m†bc D 180ı. Subtracting these two equations, we
conclude that m†bc0 D m†bc.
We noted above that
!a and
!c 0 lie on opposite sides of
 !
b ; and because †ab and †bc
are adjacent by hypothesis,
!a and
!c also lie on opposite sides of
 !
b . It follows therefore
that
!c and
!c 0 are on the same side of
 !
b . Because m†bc0 D m†bc, the unique ray
theorem shows that
!c D
!c 0. Therefore
!c is opposite
!a , which means that †ab and †bc
form a linear pair.
□
Two angles are said to form a pair of vertical angles if they have the same vertex,
they are both proper, and their sides form two distinct pairs of opposite rays. Thus if †ab
and †cd are two proper angles with the same vertex, to say they are vertical angles means
either that
!a and

The Interior of an Angle
For points, the statement that B is between A and C is equivalent (essentially by deﬁni-
tion) to the statement that B is an interior point of AC. This is how we will usually use
betweenness of points in geometric proofs: instead of using a coordinate function for a line
(which we will rarely mention from now on), we will conclude that a point B is between
two other points A and C because it is in the interior of AC, either because we chose it
that way or because we can prove it from other properties of the given conﬁguration.
Betweenness of rays is also related to a notion of “interior” (of an angle), which in
turn is closely related to plane separation. Developing this relationship rigorously requires
some work. Once we have done the work, we will relegate coordinate functions for rays to
the background, just as we have done with coordinate functions for lines.
Suppose †AOC is a proper angle. We deﬁne the interior of †AOC , denoted by
Int†AOC, to be the set of all points that are on the same side of
 !
OA as the ray
!
OC and
on the same side of
 !
OC as
!
OA (see Fig. 4.12). In other words, a point B is in the interior
of †AOC if and only if it satisﬁes both of the following conditions:
 B and C are on the same side of
 !
OA, and
 B and A are on the same side of
 !
OC .

4. Angles
(b) If no two of the rays are collinear and one ray lies in the interior of the angle formed
by the other two (Fig. 4.6(b)), then that ray is between the other two by Lemma 4.21,
so the betweenness theorem for rays shows that the largest angle measure is the sum
of the two smaller ones.
(c) The only other possibility is that no two of the rays are collinear and none of the rays
lies in the interior of the angle formed by the other two (Fig. 4.6(c)). This case is
covered by the next theorem.
The proof of the following theorem is rated PG.
Theorem 4.22 (The 360 Theorem). Suppose
!a ,
!b , and
!c are three distinct rays with the
same endpoint, such that no two of the rays are collinear and none of the rays lies in the
interior of the angle formed by the other two. Then
m†ab Cm†bc Cm†ac D 360ı:
(4.2)
Proof. Let O be the common endpoint of
!a ,
!b , and
!c , and choose points A 2 Int
!a ,
B 2 Int
!b , and C 2 Int
!c . The fact that no two of the rays are collinear implies that neither
A nor B lies on
 !
OC , and similar statements hold for
 !
OA and
 !
OB . Consider the following
possibilities:
 A and B are on the same side of
 !
OC ,
 A and C are on the same side of
 !
OB ,
 B and C are on the same side of
 !
OA.
If any two of these statements were true, then one of the rays would be in the interior of
the angle formed by the other two; therefore at least two of them must be false. Without
loss of generality, let us assume that the ﬁrst two are false, so that A and B are on opposite
sides of
 !
OC and A and C are on opposite sides of
 !
OB . The situation is illustrated in Fig.
4.13.

Let D be a point such that D O A, and let

It follows from the X-lemma that D is on the opposite side of both lines

A, so D is on the same side of
 !
OB as C and on the same side of

d is in the interior of †bc. It follows from Lemma 4.21 that

(4.3)

while the linear pair theorem tells us that
m†ab Cm†bd D 180ı;
m†ac Cm†cd D 180ı:
Adding these last two equations together and substituting (4.3) for m†bd C m†cd, we
get (4.2).
□
Now we are ready to prove the equivalence of the concepts of betweenness and interior
for angles. The next lemma has another PG-rated proof.
Lemma 4.23 (Interior Lemma). Suppose
!a ,
!b , and
!c are three rays with the same
endpoint, no two of which are collinear. Then
!b lies in the interior of †ac if and only if
!a 
!b 
!c .
Proof. One of the implications—being in the interior implies betweenness—is exactly
what Lemma 4.21 says.
Conversely, suppose
!a 
!b 
!c , and assume for the sake of contradiction that
!b is not
in the interior of †ac. It is also not the case that
!a is in the interior of †bc, for that would
imply
!b 
!a 
!c , which is impossible by Theorem 4.9. For similar reasons,
!c is not in the
interior of †ab. Therefore the hypotheses of the 360 theorem are satisﬁed, and we have
m†ab Cm†bc Cm†ac D 360ı:
On the other hand, because we are assuming
!a 
!b 
!c , the betweenness theorem implies
m†ab Cm†bc D m†ac:
Subtracting these two equations, we obtain m†ac D 360ı  m†ac, from which we con-
clude that m†ac D 180ı and thus †ac is a straight angle. Since we are assuming that
!a
and
!c are noncollinear, this is a contradiction, which proves that our assumption must be
false and therefore
!b is in the interior of †ac.
□
Thanks to this lemma, we can now use positions of points with respect to lines to
determine when one ray is between two others. The interior lemma shows that a possible
alternative deﬁnition for betweenness of rays would be to deﬁne
!a 
!b 
!c to mean that
!b
is in the interior of †ac. Many authors do in fact adopt this deﬁnition. We have chosen the
deﬁnition we did because it is more closely analogous to the deﬁnition of betweenness of
points and because it corresponds to our intuitive concept of what it means for one ray to
be between two others. From now on, we will use both characterizations of betweenness
interchangeably. For example, it is often useful to use the 360 theorem in the following
alternative form, which follows immediately from the 360 theorem and the interior lemma.
Corollary 4.24 (Restatement of the 360 Theorem in Terms of Betweenness). Suppose
!a ,
!b , and
!c are three distinct rays with the same endpoint, such that no two of the rays
are collinear and none of the rays lies between the other two. Then
m†ab Cm†bc Cm†ac D 360ı:

The interior lemma and the 360 theorem are the keys to proving some very useful
criteria for deciding when one ray is between two others. To begin, we have the following
important converse to the “whole angle greater than the part” theorem. Like its counterpart
for segments, this lemma will be extremely useful throughout the book.

Lemma 4.25 (Ordering Lemma for Rays). Suppose
!a ,
!b , and
!c are rays with the same
endpoint, such that
!b and
!c are on the same side of

a and m†ab < m†ac (Fig. 4.14).
Then
!a 
!b 
!c .

Fig. 4.14. The ordering lemma for rays.
Proof. First we wish to apply Theorem 4.9, which says that exactly one of the rays is
between the other two. To do so, we need to verify that all three rays lie in some half-
rotation and no two of them are collinear.
The hypotheses guarantee that
!a ,
!b , and
!c all lie in HR.
!a ;
!c /. They also guarantee
that neither
!b nor
!c is collinear with
!a (because then that ray would lie on
 !
a , not on one
side of it). To show that
!b and
!c cannot be collinear either, suppose for contradiction that
they are. Then they are either equal or opposite by Theorem 3.38(b). If they are equal, then
m†ab D m†ac, which contradicts our hypothesis. If they are opposite, then the X-lemma
shows that they are on opposite sides of
 !
a , which also contradicts our hypothesis. Thus
no two of the rays are collinear.
Therefore, the hypotheses of Theorem 4.9 are satisﬁed, and we conclude that exactly
one of the three rays lies between the other two. If
!b 
!a 
!c , then
!b and
!c are on
opposite sides of
!a , contradicting our hypothesis. On the other hand, if
!a 
!c 
!b , then
the betweenness theorem for rays implies m†ab D m†ac C m†bc. Since no two of the
rays are collinear, †bc is a proper angle, which implies m†bc > 0 and therefore m†ab >
m†ac, again contradicting our hypothesis. Thus the only remaining possibility is
!a 
!b 
!c , which is what we wanted to prove.
□
The next criterion for betweenness is a partial converse to Theorem 4.12. The proof
of the second part is rated PG.
Lemma 4.26 (Adjacency Lemma). Suppose †ab and †bc are adjacent angles sharing
the common side
!b . If either of the following conditions holds, then
!a 
!b 
!c .
(a)
!a ,
!b , and
!c all lie in a single half-rotation.
(b) m†ab Cm†bc < 180ı.
Proof. First assume that (a) holds. By Theorem 4.9, exactly one of the rays lies between
the other two. If
!a is the one between the other two, then the interior lemma implies that
!a
lies in the interior of †bc, which means in particular that
!a and
!c lie on the same side of
 !
b . This contradicts our hypothesis, so this case is impossible. The same argument with
!a
and
!c reversed shows that
!c cannot be between the other two either. The only remaining
possibility is
!a 
!b 
!c .
Now assume (b). By the Y-lemma, there are exactly three possibilities for the location
of
!c with respect to
 !
a (see Fig. 4.15):

lemma implies that B and A are on the same side of
 !
OC and B and C are on the same
side of
 !
OA. This means BA does not intersect
 !
OC , so C cannot be between B and A;
and BC does not intersect
 !
OA, so A cannot be between B and C. The only remaining
possibility is that B is between A and C.
□
In this chapter, we have seen quite a few characterizations of what it means for one ray
to be between two others. Using these various characterizations thoughtfully will free us
from having to work with the deﬁnition of betweenness in terms of coordinate functions;
henceforth, we will never again need to refer to coordinate functions for rays.
Suppose
!a ,
!b , and
!c are three rays with the same endpoint, no two of which are
collinear. From the results of this chapter, we see that any one of the following conditions
implies
!a 
!b 
!c :

!b lies in the interior of †ac (interior lemma).

!b and
!c are on the same side of
 !
a , and m†ab < m†ac (ordering lemma for rays).
 †ab and †bc are adjacent, and
!a ;
!b ;
!c lie in a half-rotation (adjacency lemma).
 †ab and †bc are adjacent, and m†ab Cm†bc < 180ı (adjacency lemma).
 There are points A 2 Int
!a , B 2 Int
!b , and C 2 Int
!c such that AB C (between-
ness vs. betweenness).
All of these characterizations will be useful to us in different circumstances. It will be a
good idea to remember the conditions on this list and be able to choose the one that is most
relevant to the problem at hand whenever you need to prove that one ray is between two
others.
Conversely, if we know that
!a 
!b 
!c , then the following are all true:
 No two of the rays are collinear (deﬁnition of betweenness).
 All three rays lie in some half-rotation (deﬁnition of betweenness).
 m†ab Cm†bc D m†ac (betweenness theorem for rays).
 m†ac > m†ab and m†ac > m†bc (whole angle is greater than the part).
 †ab and †bc are adjacent (Theorem 4.12).

!b lies in the interior of †ac (interior lemma).
Angle Bisectors and Perpendiculars
Suppose †ab is a proper angle. A ray
!r is called an angle bisector of †ab if
!r
is between
!a and
!b and m†ar D m†rb. The next theorem is our analogue of Euclid’s
Proposition I.9, but we give a different proof based on the angle construction theorem.
Theorem 4.28 (Existence and Uniqueness of Angle Bisectors). Every proper angle has
a unique angle bisector.
Proof. Let †ab be a proper angle. The angle construction theorem shows that there is a
ray
!r on the same side of
 !
a as
!b such that m†ar D 1
2m†ab. The ordering lemma for
rays implies that
!a 
!r 
!b , and then the betweenness theorem for rays implies
m†rb D m†ab m†ar D m†ab  1
2m†ab D 1
2m†ab;
so m†ar D m†rb by transitivity. Thus
!r is an angle bisector of †ab.

Exercises
101
To prove that
!r is the unique bisector, suppose
!r 0 is another one, which means that
!a 
!r 0 
!b and m†ar0 D m†r0b. The betweenness theorem for rays implies that
m†ab D m†ar0 Cm†r0b D 2m†ar0;
so m†ar0 D 1
2m†ab D m†ar. The interior lemma implies that
!r 0 is on the same side of
 !
a as
!r , and so the unique ray theorem guarantees that
!r 0 D
!r .
□
The restriction to proper angles is necessary in this theorem. For example, if †ab is
a straight angle, there are two different rays that one might consider to be its “bisectors.”
Instead of talking about bisectors in this case, we use the following terminology. Two
distinct lines ` and m are said to be perpendicular if they intersect at a point O and one of
the rays in ` starting at O makes an angle of 90ı with one of the rays in m starting at O.
In this case, we write ` ? m, and we say ` is perpendicular to m at O.
Theorem 4.29 (Four Right Angles Theorem). If ` and m are perpendicular lines, then `
and m form four right angles.
Proof. Exercise 4H.
□
The following theorem is Euclid’s Proposition I.11.
Theorem 4.30 (Constructing a Perpendicular). Let ` be a line and let P be a point on
`. Then there exists a unique line m that is perpendicular to ` at P .
Proof. Exercise 4I.

Chapter 5
Triangles
Many important theorems of Euclidean geometry are theorems about the geometric prop-
erties of triangles. We begin by introducing the relevant terminology.
Deﬁnitions
We deﬁne a triangle to be a union of three segments AB, BC, and AC formed by three
noncollinear points A, B, and C. The points A;B;C are called the vertices (singular:
vertex) of the triangle, and the segments AB, BC, AC are called its sides or edges. (We
will most often use the term “sides,” but “edges” is sometimes preferred when there is a
possibility of confusion with sides of lines.) The triangle whose vertices are A, B, and C
is denoted by 4ABC. Note that, in contrast to Euclid, we deﬁne a triangle to include only
the points on the line segments, not the points in the “interior.”
The next proof is rated PG.
Theorem 5.1 (Consistency of Triangle Vertices). If 4ABC is a triangle, the only ex-
treme points of 4ABC are A, B, and C. Thus if 4ABC D 4A0B0C 0, then the sets
fA;B;Cg and fA0;B0;C 0g are equal.
Proof. Exercise 5A.
□
If 4ABC is a triangle, the angles of 4ABC are the three angles †BAC, †ABC,
and †BCA. When there is only one angle under discussion at a given vertex (so there can
be no confusion about which angle is meant), we will often label an angle by its vertex
alone instead of using the “ofﬁcial” notation, so the three angles of 4ABC can also be
referred to as †A, †B, and †C, respectively. At other times, for clarity, we might label
some of the angles in a drawing with numbers and refer to them as †1, †2, etc. For
example, in Fig. 5.1, the notations †A and †1 both refer to †CAB; †B and †2 refer to
†ABC; and †C and †3 refer to †BCA. These notations are just a convenient shorthand,
and there should always be enough information given so that the reader can replace each
such abbreviation with the full notation without any trouble.

Caution is required, however, when using diagrams in proofs. It is acceptable to refer
to a diagram to establish the meaning of an abbreviation such as †1; but each symbol that
is so deﬁned should be mentioned in the text of the proof, using a phrase such as “Let †1
denote the angle shown in Fig. 5.1.” Similarly, diagrams can sometimes be used to simplify
the statements of hypotheses, as in “Assume that the three angles marked in the diagram are
right angles.” (Such assumptions must always be stated, not left for the reader to infer from
the diagram.) However, a diagram can never be used to justify a conclusion. Even if it is
“obvious” from a diagram that two lines, rays, or segments intersect or that a certain angle
is acute or that three points are collinear, if such facts are not part of the hypothesis, then
they must always be proved according to the conventions outlined in Appendix F. Most
of the theorems of the preceding two chapters were designed to give us tools for justifying
such conclusions.
This is not to say that diagrams have no place in rigorous geometric proofs. In fact,
well-chosen diagrams are essential for making geometric proofs easy to follow. If you
don’t believe it, try reading some of Euclid’s proofs, or the proofs in this chapter, while
covering up the diagrams that go with them. As soon as a proof refers to more than one
or two points, lines, rays, or segments, you will probably ﬁnd yourself drawing a diagram
to help you remember how all the elements are related to each other. The goal of good
mathematical writing is communication, and in geometry more than any other subject,
diagrams play an essential role.1
Let us continue with our deﬁnitions. If †1 and †2 are two angles of a triangle, a side
of the same triangle is said to be included between †1 and †2 if its endpoints are the
vertices of those angles; thus, for example, in 4ABC, the side AB is included between
†A and †B. Similarly, an angle of a triangle is said to be included between two sides if
those sides meet at the vertex of the angle; thus †B is included between AB and BC. We
say a side is opposite an angle (or an angle is opposite a side) if the vertex of the angle is
not one of the endpoints of the side; thus, for example, †C is opposite AB.
Triangles can be classiﬁed by the relationships among their side lengths:
 An equilateral triangle is one in which all three sides have the same length.
 An isosceles triangle is one in which at least two sides have the same length.
 A scalene triangle is one in which all three side lengths are different.
1It is interesting to note that a group of logicians [ADM09] have recently developed a rigorous
axiom system for Euclidean geometry that includes some axioms designed speciﬁcally for drawing
conclusions from diagrams. But of course all such conclusions must be explicitly justiﬁed by the
axioms and cannot rely on geometric intuition.

Intersections of Lines and Triangles
105
They can also be classiﬁed by their angle measures:
 An equiangular triangle is one in which all three angles have the same measure.
 An acute triangle is one in which all three angles are acute.
 A right triangle is one that contains a right angle.
 An obtuse triangle is one that contains an obtuse angle.
Note that our deﬁnition of isosceles triangles is different from Euclid’s, which stipulates
that an isosceles triangle has only two congruent sides; we consider an equilateral triangle
to be a special case of an isosceles triangle.
In an isosceles triangle, the base is the side that is not congruent to the other two, if
there is one (if the triangle is equilateral, any side can be considered the base), and the base
angles are the two angles that include the base. In a right triangle, the side opposite the
right angle is called the hypotenuse, and the other two sides are called the legs.
Intersections of Lines and Triangles
Before we study geometric properties of triangles, we need to establish some “obvious”
results about conditions under which lines and triangles intersect. The ﬁrst one is a simple
application of the plane separation postulate.
Theorem 5.2 (Pasch’s Theorem). Suppose 4ABC is a triangle and ` is a line that does
not contain any of the points A, B, or C. If ` intersects one of the sides of 4ABC, then it
also intersects another side (see Fig. 5.2).
A
B
C
?
`
Fig. 5.2. Pasch’s Theorem.
Proof. Assume without loss of generality that ` intersects AB. If it also intersects BC,
we are done, so assume it does not do so. Then B and C are on the same side of `, while
A and B are on opposite sides. It follows that A and C are on opposite sides, and thus AC
must intersect `.
□
Corollary 5.3. If 4ABC is a triangle and ` is a line that does not contain any of the
points A, B, or C, then either ` intersects exactly two sides of 4ABC or it intersects none
of them.
Proof. Exercise 5B.
□
Pasch’s theorem is named after Moritz Pasch, a nineteenth-century German mathe-
matician who was one of the ﬁrst to point out many of the unstated assumptions in Euclid’s
Elements. He proposed that the statement of Theorem 5.2 be added to Euclid’s geome-
try as an additional axiom; it is in fact included (often under the name Pasch’s Axiom) in

106
5. Triangles
some modern axiom systems, including Hilbert’s (see Axiom II.4 in Appendix A). In most
systems, however, some version of the plane separation postulate is used instead.
The next theorem is related to Pasch’s theorem, but it is slightly different—whereas
Pasch’s theorem says that a line that intersects one side of a triangle must intersect one of
the other sides, our next theorem applies to a ray that intersects a vertex, provided it lies
between the two sides that meet at that vertex.
Theorem 5.4 (The Crossbar Theorem). Suppose 4ABC is a triangle and

□
Euclid would never have thought to prove theorems such as these last two, because
the existence of a second intersection point would have been obvious from the picture.
For example, in his proof of Proposition I.10, Euclid implicitly uses the crossbar theorem
without acknowledging it. But our modern understanding of the axiomatic method requires
that every such statement be justiﬁed.
Students sometimes have a hard time remembering the distinction between the cross-
bar theorem and the betweenness vs. betweenness theorem because the diagrams that go
with both theorems are very similar. But there is a big difference in the circumstances
under which the two theorems can be applied: in order to apply the betweenness vs. be-
tweenness theorem, we have to know in advance that all three rays intersect the line `. The
crossbar theorem, in contrast, applies when we do not yet know that
!
AD intersects
 !
BC ,
provided we know that it lies between
!
AB and
!
AC .
Congruent Triangles
Two triangles are said to be congruent if there is a one-to-one correspondence between
their vertices such that all three pairs of corresponding angles and all three pairs of cor-
responding sides are congruent. The notation 4ABC Š 4DEF means that these two

triangles are congruent under the speciﬁc correspondence A $ D, B $ E, and C $ F ;
thus it means speciﬁcally that
AB Š DE;
BC Š EF ;
CA Š FD;
†A Š †D;
†B Š †E;
†C Š †F:
(See Fig. 5.4.) In diagrams like this, we will frequently follow the common convention of
using matching marks to indicate which sides and angles are assumed to be congruent to
each other. Note that the order in which the vertices are listed in the notation 4ABC Š
4DEF is signiﬁcant.

Theorem 5.5 (Transitive Property of Congruence of Triangles). Two triangles that are
both congruent to a third triangle are congruent to each other.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the transitive properties of congruence of
segments and angles.
□
In order to prove that two triangles are congruent, in principle one must prove that six
different “parts” of one triangle (three sides and three angles) are congruent to the six cor-
responding parts of the other. Conversely, if we know that two triangles are congruent, then
we can conclude from the deﬁnition that all six pairs of corresponding parts are congruent.
We know from our experience with physical objects that it is usually not necessary
to check all six congruences in order to conclude that two triangles are congruent. If
you make a triangle out of three sticks, there is only one triangle that can be made—any
two people using three sticks of the same lengths will make congruent triangles. This
observation is expressed mathematically in Euclid’s Proposition I.8, nowadays called the
SSS (or side-side-side) congruence theorem. Another such result is one of Euclid’s earliest
results, Proposition I.4. Called the SAS (side-angle-side) congruence theorem, it asserts
that two triangles are congruent if there is a correspondence between their vertices such
that two pairs of corresponding sides and the included angles are congruent.
Euclid’s proofs of Propositions I.4 and I.8 used a highly unusual technique, called the
method of superposition, which we described in Chapter 1. As we noted there, this argu-
ment is not justiﬁed by Euclid’s postulates, so we have to look for some other way to prove
SAS and SSS congruence. In fact, it is not possible to prove either SAS or SSS congruence
from the neutral geometry postulates we have introduced so far: in the next chapter, we
will describe an interpretation of our axiomatic system (called taxicab geometry) in which

108

Postulates 1–8 are true, as are all ﬁve of Euclid’s postulates, but the SAS and SSS congru-
ence theorems are actually false. This shows that these theorems do not follow from the
other postulates.
There are two ways to remedy this situation. One way is to try to mimic Euclid’s
method of superposition—this would require introducing one or more new postulates that
assert the existence of certain kinds of “motions” of the plane, or more precisely bijective
functions from the plane to itself (called transformations of the plane) that preserve all
geometric properties such as distances and angle measures. In recent years, this transfor-
mational approach has been adopted by a few high-school geometry textbooks. It has an
appealing naturalness to it and leads to an interesting study of transformations for their
own sake, in addition to justifying Euclid’s original arguments for SAS and SSS. Its chief
disadvantage is that if one is striving for rigor, one must work rather hard right at the be-
ginning to prove a list of properties of transformations before one can use them to prove
anything very interesting. For reference, the basic features of this approach are described
in Appendix I.
On the other hand, a simpler approach is just to adopt the SAS congruence criterion
itself as a postulate. In one form or another, this is the approach adopted by Hilbert,
Birkhoff, SMSG, and most high-school texts, and it is the approach we adopt here. Having
just studied the preceding two chapters of this book, which consist largely of proofs of
facts about lines, segments, rays, and angles that most people would consider intuitively
obvious, you will probably be relieved to know that adopting SAS as a postulate will allow
us very quickly to start proving interesting geometric theorems.
With this motivation in mind, we introduce our next postulate.
Postulate 9 (The SAS Postulate). If there is a correspondence between the vertices
of two triangles such that two sides and the included angle of one triangle are con-
gruent to the corresponding sides and angle of the other triangle, then the triangles
are congruent under that correspondence.
All of the other congruence criteria for triangles can be deduced from the SAS pos-
tulate combined with our other postulates. Here is the ﬁrst example. It is the ﬁrst part of
Euclid’s Proposition I.26, with the same proof. (The other part is AAS congruence, which
is Theorem 5.22 below.)
Theorem 5.6 (ASA Congruence). If there is a correspondence between the vertices of
two triangles such that two angles and the included side of one triangle are congruent to
the corresponding angles and side of the other triangle, then the triangles are congruent
under that correspondence.
Proof. Suppose 4ABC and 4DEF are triangles such that †A Š †D, †B Š †E, and
AB Š DE. If AC Š DF , then 4ABC Š 4DEF by SAS, and we are done. So assume
for the sake of contradiction that AC 6Š DF . By the trichotomy law, one of these sides
must be longer than the other; without loss of generality, let us say that AC > DF . By
Euclid’s segment cutoff theorem (Corollary 3.37), there is an interior point C 0 2 AC such
that AC 0 Š DF (Fig. 5.5). The two triangles 4ABC 0 and 4DEF satisfy the hypotheses
of the SAS postulate, so they are congruent. It follows from the deﬁnition of congruence
that †ABC 0 Š †E. Since AC 0 C by construction, the betweenness vs. betweenness

4.11(e) (the whole angle is greater than the part). Thus by substitution, m†ABC > m†E.
This contradicts our hypothesis that these two angles are congruent and rules out the pos-
sibility that AC and DF are not congruent.
□
The next theorem corresponds to Euclid’s Proposition I.5.
Theorem 5.7 (Isosceles Triangle Theorem). If two sides of a triangle are congruent to
each other, then the angles opposite those sides are congruent.

bisector, AB Š AC by hypothesis, and AG is congruent to itself; thus 4BAG Š 4CAG
by SAS. It follows from the deﬁnition of congruence that †B Š †C.
□
This proof is simple, short, and easy for most people to follow. This is in sharp contrast
to Euclid’s elaborate proof, which required extending two lines, drawing two additional
line segments, and applying SAS twice. Because that proof has been a stumbling block for
geometry students at least since the Middle Ages, it was given the epithet pons asinorum,
Latin for “bridge of fools” (literally “bridge of asses”), reﬂecting the fact that only serious

110

and hard-working students succeeded in crossing it (and perhaps also reﬂecting the fact
that the diagram included with Euclid’s proof resembles a bridge).
There is another, even simpler, proof of the isosceles triangle theorem, apparently
discovered by Pappus of Alexandria about 600 years after Euclid’s time. It is so simple
that it sometimes requires a second look to see what’s going on.
Pappus’s Proof of the Isosceles Triangle Theorem.
As before, suppose 4ABC is a
triangle in which AB Š AC. Under the correspondence A $ A, B $ C, and C $ B,
the triangles 4ABC and 4ACB satisfy the hypotheses of the SAS postulate (because
AB Š AC, AC Š AB, and †BAC Š †CAB), and therefore 4ABC Š 4ACB. Thus
the corresponding angles †B and †C are congruent.

Fig. 5.7. Pappus’s proof of the isosceles triangle theorem.
This proof might be a little surprising if you haven’t seen it before. To understand how
it works, it helps to visualize two copies of 4ABC, one a mirror image of the other. (See
Fig. 5.7; I am indebted to the beautiful geometry text by Harold Jacobs [Jac03] for the idea
of illustrating the proof this way.) Intuitively, the crux of the idea is that 4ABC is congru-
ent to its mirror image. During the centuries since Pappus’s proof was ﬁrst written down,
some mathematicians questioned whether it is legitimate to apply SAS to two triangles that
happen to be the same triangle. But now that we have a more precise understanding of the
meanings of mathematical statements, it is clear that our SAS postulate does indeed apply
here, because its statement does not stipulate that the two triangles in question are distinct.
The next theorem is Euclid’s Proposition I.6.
Theorem 5.8 (Converse to the Isosceles Triangle Theorem). If two angles of a triangle
are congruent to each other, then the sides opposite those angles are congruent.
Proof. Exercise 5D.
□
Corollary 5.9. A triangle is equilateral if and only if it is equiangular.
Proof. If 4ABC is equilateral, then the isosceles triangle theorem shows that any two
of its angles are congruent to each other. Conversely, if 4ABC is equiangular, then the
converse to the isosceles triangle theorem shows that any two sides are congruent to each
other.

Theorem 5.10 (Triangle Copying Theorem). Suppose 4ABC is a triangle and DE is
a segment congruent to AB. On each side of

The point F whose existence is asserted in the previous theorem is actually unique,
once we decide on a speciﬁc side of

DE . Like the unique point and unique ray theorems,
this uniqueness statement is often very important in its own right, so it is worth stating as
a separate theorem. This is Euclid’s Proposition I.7, but our proof is different.
Theorem 5.11 (Unique Triangle Theorem). Suppose DE is a segment and F and F 0 are
points on the same side of

DE such that 4DEF Š 4DEF 0 (Fig. 5.8). Then F D F 0.

Next comes the most natural-seeming congruence theorem of all, the SSS congruence
theorem. Somewhat surprisingly, proving it takes considerably more work than proving
ASA. It is Euclid’s Proposition I.8, but we give a different proof that avoids the unjustiﬁed
use of superposition.
Theorem 5.12 (SSS Congruence). If there is a correspondence between the vertices of
two triangles such that all three sides of one triangle are congruent to the corresponding
sides of the other triangle, then the triangles are congruent under that correspondence.

Proof. Let 4ABC be a triangle. We will show that m†ACm†B < 180ı; the argument
for any other pair of angles is exactly the same. Let †1 denote either of the exterior angles
adjacent to †A (Fig. 5.13). The exterior angle inequality implies
m†1 > m†B;
(5.2)
and the linear pair theorem implies
m†1 D 180ı m†A:
(5.3)
Substituting (5.3) into (5.2), we obtain 180ı  m†A > m†B, which is equivalent to the
inequality we want to prove.
□
Corollary 5.15. Every triangle has at least two acute angles.
Proof. Suppose 4ABC is a triangle, and assume for the sake of contradiction that it has
no more than one acute angle. Without loss of generality, we may assume that neither †A
nor †B is acute, so m†A  90ı and m†B  90ı. Therefore, m†ACm†B  90ıC90ı D
180ı, contradicting Corollary 5.14.
□
The next theorem combines Euclid’s Propositions I.18 and I.19, with the same proofs.
It says roughly that the largest side of a triangle is opposite the largest angle, and the
smallest side is opposite the smallest angle.
Theorem 5.16 (Scalene Inequality). Let 4ABC be a triangle. Then AC > BC if and
only if m†B > m†A.
Proof. Assume ﬁrst that AC > BC (Fig. 5.14). By Euclid’s segment cutoff theorem

(Corollary 3.37), we can choose a point D in the interior of AC such that CD Š CB. By
the isosceles triangle theorem, †CBD Š †CDB. Now, the betweenness vs. betweenness
theorem implies that

BC , so m†CBA > m†CBD. On the other hand, the
exterior angle inequality implies that m†CDB > m†CAB. Putting these results together,
we ﬁnd
m†CBA > m†CBD D m†CDB > m†CAB:
Conversely, assume that m†B > m†A. By the trichotomy law for real numbers, there
are three possibilities for the lengths AC and BC: AC < BC, AC D BC, or AC > BC. If
AC < BC, then the proof in the preceding paragraph shows that m†A > m†B, which is a
contradiction. If AC D BC, then the isosceles triangle theorem shows that m†B D m†A,
which is also a contradiction. The only remaining possibility is that AC > BC.

Corollary 5.17. In any right triangle, the hypotenuse is strictly longer than either leg.
Proof. By Corollary 5.15, a right triangle has two acute angles, so the right angle is strictly
larger than either of the other two angles. Thus the result follows from the scalene inequal-
ity.
□
Our third major inequality is a version of the familiar adage that “the shortest distance
between two points is along a straight line.” It is Euclid’s Proposition I.20.

□
The triangle inequality applies only to three noncollinear points. It is often useful to
have a more general version of the inequality, which applies when there are more than three
points and when the points are allowed to be collinear or not even assumed to be distinct.
Its proof is our ﬁrst example of a proof by mathematical induction. Now would be a good
time to review the discussion of induction proofs in Appendix F.
Theorem 5.19 (General Triangle Inequality).
(a) If A;B;C are any three points (not necessarily distinct), then
AC  AB CBC;

Proof. Suppose A, B, and C are any three points. There are several cases to consider:
CASE 1: If A;B;C are noncollinear, then the original triangle inequality applies, so
(5.4) holds with “less than” instead of “less than or equal to.”
CASE 2: If the three points are collinear and distinct and AB C, then the between-
ness theorem for points shows that (5.4) holds with an equal sign.
CASE 3: If the three points are collinear and distinct and A  C  B, then Theorem
3.22(e) (the whole segment is greater than the part) implies that
AC < AB < AB CBC:
(The last inequality follows from the fact that distances between distinct points are posi-
tive.) An analogous argument works if B AC.
CASE 4: If A D C but B is distinct from A and C, then AB CBC D 2AB > 0 D AC;
thus again the strict inequality holds.
CASE 5: Finally, if A D B or B D C, then one of the terms on the right-hand side of
(5.4) is zero, while the other term is equal to the left-hand side, so equality holds.
Looking back over these cases, we see that equality holds in Cases 2 and 5, while the
strict inequality holds in all other cases. This proves (a).
We will prove (b) by induction on n. The base case n D 3 is taken care of by part
(a). Let n be an integer greater than or equal to 3, and assume that the inequality is true
for every collection of n points; we need to prove the analogous inequality for an arbitrary
collection of nC1 points, A1;:::;AnC1. We compute
A1AnC1  A1An CAnAnC1 

A1A2 CA2A3 CCAn1An

where the ﬁrst inequality is justiﬁed by the base case, and the second by the inductive
hypothesis. This completes the induction step and thus the proof.
□
Corollary 5.20 (Converse to the Betweenness Theorem for Points). If A, B, and C are
three distinct points and AB CBC D AC, then AB C.
Proof. Suppose A;B;C are distinct and AB CBC D AC. The preceding theorem shows
that this equation holds if and only if A D B, B D C, or AB C. Since we are assuming
A, B, and C are distinct, only the third possibility can occur.
□
The exterior angle, scalene, and triangle inequalities all apply to sides or angles within
a single triangle. By contrast, our ﬁnal inequality, which corresponds to Euclid’s Propo-
sitions I.24 and I.25, compares sides and angles in two different triangles. The geometric
intuition behind this inequality is that if you use two segments of ﬁxed lengths to make
triangles and let the included angle vary as if the two segments were connected by a hinge,
then the opposite side gets larger as the angle gets larger (Fig. 5.17). We will not use this
theorem until Chapter 17, but it will play a very important role when it does appear. Its
proof is rated PG. (Our proof of the ﬁrst part is a little different from Euclid’s proof of
Proposition I.24, for reasons that will be explained in the proof.)
Theorem 5.21 (Hinge Theorem). Suppose 4ABC and 4DEF are two triangles such
that AB Š DE and AC Š DF . Then m†A > m†D if and only if BC > EF .
Proof. First suppose m†A > m†D. Using the triangle copying theorem (Theorem 5.10),
make a copy of 4ABC by letting G be the point on the same side of

EF . Euclid gives a proof that works only when G and D are on the

EF , which is why we are using a different argument. This proof is a little
longer, but it does not require the consideration of separate cases.)
Now we have m†GDE D m†A > m†FDE by hypothesis, so the ordering lemma
for rays shows that
!
DF is in the interior of †GDE. In particular, this means that
!
DG and

Let

!
DP is between

DF , it follows that P is on the same side of

Therefore, we can apply the ordering lemma for rays once more to conclude that

DP is in
the interior of †GDE. Thus by the crossbar theorem,

DP meets the interior of GE at a
point H. It follows from SAS that 4DHF Š DHG, and therefore HF D HG.
Now consider the distance EF . By the general triangle inequality, we have
EF  EH CHF D EH CHG:
Because E  H  G, the last expression on the right is equal to EG, so we conclude that
EF  EG D BC. If EF were equal to BC, then 4ABC and 4DEF would be congruent

by SSS, which is impossible because †A is not congruent to †D; so in fact we must have
EF < BC as desired. This completes the proof that m†A > m†D implies BC > EF .
To prove the converse, assume that BC > EF . By trichotomy, there are three possi-
bilities: m†A < m†D, m†A D m†D, or m†A > m†D. By the argument in the ﬁrst
part of the proof, the ﬁrst possibility would imply BC < EF , which contradicts our hy-
pothesis. Similarly, the second possibility would imply BC D EF by SAS, which is also
a contradiction. The only remaining possibility is m†A > m†D.
□
More Congruence Theorems
In this section, we will use the exterior angle inequality to prove some more congruence
theorems for triangles. It is remarkable that a theorem about inequalities plays a crucial
role in the proofs of so many theorems about congruence, which are essentially statements
that certain things are equal.
The next theorem is the second half of Euclid’s Proposition I.26, with the same proof.
Theorem 5.22 (AAS Congruence). If there is a correspondence between the vertices of
two triangles such that two angles and a nonincluded side of one triangle are congruent to
the corresponding angles and side of the other triangle, then the triangles are congruent
under that correspondence.

Fig. 5.19. Proof of the AAS congruence theorem.
Proof. Suppose 4ABC and 4DEF are triangles such that †A Š †D, †B Š †E, and
AC Š DF . If AB Š DE, then the two triangles are congruent by SAS (or ASA), so
assume for the sake of contradiction that AB ¤ DE. Then one of these lengths, say DE,
is greater than the other. By Corollary 3.37, there is a point E0 in the interior of DE such
that DE0 Š AB (Fig. 5.19). Then SAS implies that 4ABC Š 4DE0F , so in particular
†B Š †DE0F . Since †E is also congruent to †B, transitivity of congruence implies
that †DE0F Š †E. But †DE0F is an exterior angle of 4E0EF , while †E is a remote
interior angle, so this contradicts the exterior angle inequality.
□
Let us pause to make an important observation about rigor. Whenever a postulate or
a previously proved theorem is used as justiﬁcation for a step in a proof, it is absolutely
essential to ensure that the hypotheses of the postulate or theorem are satisﬁed. In the
course of the preceding proof, to justify the application of the exterior angle inequality, we
asserted without proof that †DE0F is an exterior angle of 4EE0F and †E is a remote
interior angle. To support these claims, we would have to verify that the deﬁnitions of
exterior and remote interior angles are satisﬁed. Verifying that †DE0F is an exterior
angle of 4E0EF means checking that it forms a linear pair with one of the interior angles

120
5. Triangles
of the same triangle. Since we chose E0 so that D  E0  E, it follows from Theorem
3.38(e) that
!
E0D and
!
E0E are opposite rays; thus because †DE0F and †EE0F share the
common ray
!
E0F and their other rays are opposite rays, they do indeed form a linear pair.
Since †E is an angle of 4EE0F but not the one that forms a linear pair with †DE0F , it
is a remote interior angle.
In this situation, it was reasonable to leave out the justiﬁcations for these claims be-
cause two things were true: the truth of the claims was immediately obvious from the
diagram, and the detailed proof of the claims was short, easy, and based on simple facts
that we have already used many times before. When both of these conditions hold, it is
entirely acceptable to make the assertion and leave it to the reader to ﬁll in the details if
he or she is curious. In fact, in most cases a proof will be easier to follow if justiﬁca-
tions of simple claims like these are not included, because they can cause an argument to
get so bogged down in the veriﬁcation of easy details that it’s hard to see the forest for
the trees. (By contrast, in the proof of the exterior angle inequality, the veriﬁcation that
!
BM 
!
BX 
!
BP was anything but obvious and therefore had to be written out.)
When you are reading a proof, if you encounter a claim that you don’t see immediately
how to prove, you should stop and ﬁgure out how to prove it; once you have done so, you
can decide whether the author was justiﬁed in leaving out the justiﬁcation according to the
criteria mentioned above. When you are writing a proof, you are responsible for ensuring
that each claim you make is fully justiﬁed; once you have worked out the justiﬁcation for
yourself, you can decide whether including the details will make the proof easier or harder
to understand. It’s a judgment call every time, and there are no rigid rules. At ﬁrst, you will
probably be safer if you err on the side of including more such justiﬁcations; but as you
gain experience and facility with proof-writing, you will get better at making such choices.
We now have four results that allow us to conclude that two triangles are congruent
if they have three congruent pairs of corresponding parts: SAS, ASA, SSS, and AAS. Are
there any other such theorems? We would not expect to have an AAA congruence theorem,
because two triangles with the same angles might differ by a scale factor. (As we will see
in Chapter 12, such triangles are said to be similar.)
The only other possible congruence theorem would be what we might call an “ASS
congruence theorem”—one that says two triangles are congruent if there is a correspon-
dence between their vertices such that two sides and a nonincluded angle of one triangle
are congruent to the corresponding parts of the other. If you experiment for a while, you
will probably ﬁnd that there are typically two noncongruent triangles that can be built with
the same two side lengths and a given nonincluded angle. Here is a counterexample that
proves that “ASS congruence” is not a theorem in neutral geometry.
Example 5.23 (There Is No ASS Congruence Theorem). Let A and B be two distinct
points, and let P be a point not on
 !
AB . By the segment construction theorem, there is
a point C on the ray
!
AP such that AC Š AB. Choose any point D 2
 !
BC such that
B  C  D (see Fig. 5.20). Because A …
 !
BC , 4DAB and 4DAC are both triangles.
These triangles have two pairs of congruent sides (DA Š DA and AB Š AC), and the
nonincluded angle †D is common to both; thus they satisfy the hypotheses of ASS. How-
ever, they are not congruent, because B C D implies that BD > CD.
//
It is worth taking careful note of what we did here. Most theorems in geometry are
stated as universal implications: “If x satisﬁes property P.x/, then it satisﬁes property

Q.x/,” with the tacit understanding that this is being asserted “for all x.” To disprove
such a statement, it is necessary to exhibit a counterexample—that is, to prove there exists
an x that satisﬁes P.x/ but not Q.x/. It is not enough just to observe that an x with
certain properties would be a counterexample, unless you can prove the existence of such
an x. This is why we took pains to show how our postulates and previous theorems actually
imply the existence of two triangles that satisfy the ASS hypotheses but not the conclusion.
Fig. 5.20 does suggest, though, that the possibilities are limited, and there should be at
most two different triangles with congruent sides and nonincluded angle. The next theorem
shows that this is indeed the case.
Theorem 5.24 (ASS Alternative Theorem). Suppose 4ABC and 4DEF are two trian-
gles such that †A Š †D, AB Š DE, BC Š EF (the hypotheses of ASS). Then †C and
†F are either congruent or supplementary.
Proof. Exercise 5G.
□
One consequence of the preceding theorem is the following limited version of ASS
congruence, sometimes abbreviated as AsS (“angle-side-longer-side”) congruence.
Theorem 5.25 (Angle-Side-Longer-Side Congruence). Suppose 4ABC and 4DEF
are two triangles such that †A Š †D, AB Š DE, BC Š EF (the hypotheses of ASS),
and assume in addition that BC  AB. Then 4ABC Š 4DEF .
Proof. Exercise 5H.
□
One situation in which the hypotheses of the preceding theorem are automatically
satisﬁed is when the nonincluded angles are right angles. In this case, the two sides are
necessarily the hypotenuse and one leg of each triangle, so the following theorem is called
the HL (“hypotenuse-leg”) congruence theorem.
Theorem 5.26 (HL Congruence). If the hypotenuse and one leg of a right triangle are
congruent to the hypotenuse and one leg of another, then the triangles are congruent under
that correspondence.

Models of Neutral Geometry
We have now introduced all of the postulates of neutral geometry (see Appendix D for the
statements of the postulates). For easy reference, here is the list:
1. The Set Postulate,
2. The Existence Postulate,
3. The Unique Line Postulate,
4. The Distance Postulate,
5. The Ruler Postulate,
6. The Plane Separation Postulate,
7. The Angle Measure Postulate,
8. The Protractor Postulate,
9. The SAS Postulate.
Eventually, we will add one of the following parallel postulates to this list:
10E. The Euclidean Parallel Postulate,
10H. The Hyperbolic Parallel Postulate.
When we add the Euclidean parallel postulate to the neutral postulates, this axiomatic
system becomes Euclidean geometry; when we add the hyperbolic parallel postulate, it
becomes hyperbolic geometry. (In the next chapter, we will prove that adding the elliptic
parallel postulate would result in an inconsistent axiomatic system.)
In this chapter, we make a short digression from the development of our axiomatic
system in order to describe two very different models of neutral geometry and some in-
terpretations that are not models. Throughout this chapter, because we are working with
interpretations, we will not be constrained to work within our axiomatic system; instead,
we allow ourselves to use whatever standard facts from the rest of mathematics are conve-
nient. Because of this, you will ﬁnd that the arguments in this chapter have a very different
ﬂavor from the rest of our treatment of geometry.

The Cartesian Model
125
We often denote a vector by a boldface lowercase letter such as a or b. If a D hx1;y1i
and b D hx2;y2i are two vectors, their vector sum and vector difference are deﬁned by
aCb D hx1 Cx2;y1 Cy2i;
ab D hx1 x2;y1 y2i:
It is straightforward to check from the deﬁnitions that displacement vectors satisfy the
following identity (see Fig. 6.2): for any three points A;B;C,
Vec.AB/CVec.BC/ D Vec.AC/:
(6.1)
If a D hx1;y1i and b D hx2;y2i are vectors, their dot product, denoted by ab, is the
real number obtained by multiplying their corresponding components together and adding:
ab D x1x2 Cy1y2:
The dot product satisﬁes the following commutative and distributive laws, as you can easily
verify from the deﬁnition:
ab D baI
.a˙b/c D ac˙bcI
c.a˙b/ D ca˙cb:
The length of a D hx1;y1i is the number
kak D paa D

x12 Cy12:
With these preliminaries out of the way, we are ready to turn the Cartesian plane into
a model of neutral geometry.
Example 6.1 (The Cartesian Plane). The Cartesian plane is the interpretation of neutral
geometry in which the primitive terms have the following meanings:
 A point is an ordered pair .x;y/ of real numbers.
 A line is any set of points .x;y/ that is the entire solution set of an equation of one
of the following two types:
x D c
for some real constant c (a vertical line)I
y D mx Cb
for some real constants m and b (a nonvertical line):
 The distance between two points A D .x1;y1/ and B D .x2;y2/ is

The deﬁnition of angle measure is motivated by the familiar relation between dot
products and angles that you probably learned when you studied vector algebra: a b D
kakkbkcos, where  is supposed to be the measure of the angle between the vectors a and
b. The function arccosWŒ1;1 ! Œ0;180 is the arccosine function. In elementary treat-
ments of trigonometry, this function is usually deﬁned as the inverse of the cosine function:
if x is a real number in the interval Œ1;1, then arccos.x/ is the unique number  2 Œ0;180

(in degrees) such that cos D x. However, for the purpose of constructing a model of neu-
tral geometry, in order to avoid circularity, we need a deﬁnition of the arccosine function
that does not presuppose any knowledge of angles or trigonometric functions. Thus we
deﬁne it by the following formula:

(Fig. 6.3), while the inte-
gral in the denominator represents the arc length of the entire upper unit semicircle; thus
the fraction expresses the percentage of the semicircle that lies between those two points.
The factor of 180 ensures that our angle measures lie in the range from 0 to 180. Using
the tools of advanced calculus, one can prove that the arccosine function has all of the
properties that one expects from its trigonometric interpretation. (Note that both integrals
in (6.4) are improper integrals because the integrands are not deﬁned at t D ˙1, so one
of the things that has to be proved is that the integrals converge.) We will not prove all of
these properties; but one such property that is easy to prove, and which will be useful in
examples, is given in the following lemma.

Lemma 6.2 (Right Angles in the Cartesian Plane). Suppose †AOB is an angle in the

vectors. Then †AOB is a right angle if and only if ab D 0.
Proof. Let †AOB, a, and b be as in the hypothesis, and assume ﬁrst that ab D 0. Then
(6.3) shows that m†AOB D arccos.0/. By (6.4), this is

Conversely, assume that †AOB is a right angle. If we deﬁne a real number r by

We already showed in the previous paragraph that this equation holds when r D 0. Because
the integrand is strictly positive as long as 1 < t < 1, it follows from elementary properties
of integrals that the left-hand side of (6.6) is less than the right-hand side when r > 0
(because we are integrating over a smaller interval) and greater than the right-hand side
when r < 0; therefore the only value of r that can satisfy (6.6) is r D 0. Looking back at
the deﬁnition of r, we see that this implies ab D 0.
□
The crucial fact about the Cartesian plane is that all of the postulates of neutral geom-
etry are true in this interpretation, so it is a model of neutral geometry. To verify this, we
need to prove that each of the nine postulates is a true statement in the Cartesian interpre-
tation.
A few of the postulates are quite easy to verify.
Theorem 6.3. The Cartesian plane satisﬁes the set postulate, the existence postulate, the
unique line postulate, and the distance postulate.
Proof. The set postulate is satisﬁed because every line is a set of points by deﬁnition, and
the collection of all points is the set R2. Theorem 2.12 showed that the Cartesian plane
satisﬁes the existence postulate (because it satisﬁes Incidence Axiom 1) and the unique
line postulate (because it satisﬁes Incidence Axioms 2 and 3). The distance postulate is
satisﬁed because the deﬁnition of the distance between points A and B in the Cartesian
plane always yields a nonnegative real number completely determined by A and B.
□
The proofs that the other ﬁve postulates are satisﬁed are somewhat more involved. As
you read the next few proofs, be sure to bear in mind that these are not being carried out
within the axiomatic system of neutral geometry. In order to prove that the Cartesian plane
satisﬁes the neutral postulates, we are free to use the full mathematical theory within which
the interpretation is constructed—in this case, that means set theory, the real numbers,
analytic geometry, vector algebra, and calculus (all of which are based ultimately on set
theory).
The next proof is rated R.
Theorem 6.4. The Cartesian plane satisﬁes the ruler postulate.
Proof. Let ` be a line in the Cartesian plane. We need to show that there is a coordinate
function for `, i.e., a bijective function f W` ! R such that
AB D jf .B/f .A/j
for all A;B 2 `:
(6.7)
We will handle the vertical and nonvertical cases separately.
Suppose ﬁrst that ` is a vertical line. This means that there is a certain constant c
such that ` is the set of all points .x;y/ satisfying the equation x D c; in other words, `

128
6. Models of Neutral Geometry
is the set of all points of the form .c;y/ for arbitrary y 2 R. Deﬁne f W` ! R by setting
f .x;y/ D y for all .x;y/ 2 `. To show that f is a coordinate function, we have to show
ﬁrst that it is bijective. To prove injectivity, suppose .x1;y1/ and .x2;y2/ are points on `
such that f .x1;y1/ D f .x2;y2/. From the deﬁnition of f , this means that y1 D y2, and
the fact that both points are on ` means that x1 D c D x2. Thus .x1;y1/ D .x2;y2/, so f
is injective. To prove surjectivity, let r 2 R be arbitrary, and just note that .c;r/ is a point
on ` such that f .c;r/ D r.
Finally, we need to show that f satisﬁes (6.7). If A D .x1;y1/ and B D .x2;y2/
are two points on `, then x1 D c D x2, so the distance formula (6.2) reduces to AB D

.y2 y1/2 D jy2 y1j, which is obviously equal to jf .B/f .A/j. (Here we have used
the standard algebraic fact that
p
r2 D jrj for any real number r.)
Now suppose ` is nonvertical. Then there are constants m and b such that ` is the set
of all points .x;y/ that satisfy the equation
y D mx Cb:
(6.8)
Deﬁne f W` ! R by
f .x;y/ D x

1Cm2:
(6.9)
(Although this formula would make sense for any .x;y/ 2 R2, we are deﬁning f .x;y/
only when .x;y/ is a point of `, meaning that it satisﬁes (6.8).)
To show that f is injective, suppose .x1;y1/ and .x2;y2/ are points on ` that sat-
isfy f .x1;y1/ D f .x2;y2/. From the deﬁnition of f , this means that x1
p
1Cm2 D
x2
p
1Cm2, and because
p
1Cm2 ¤ 0, this in turn implies that x1 D x2. Since both
points are on `, (6.8) implies
y2 D mx2 Cb D mx1 Cb D y1:
(6.10)
Thus we have shown .x1;y1/ D .x2;y2/, so f is injective.
To show that f is surjective, suppose r is an arbitrary real number. If we set x0 D
r=
p
1Cm2 and y0 D mx0 C b, then .x0;y0/ is a point on `, and an easy computation
shows that f .x0;y0/ D r.
Finally, we need to show that f satisﬁes (6.7). Suppose A and B are arbitrary points
on `. If we write A D .x1;y1/ and B D .x2;y2/, then the fact that they are both on ` means
that y1 D mx1 Cb and y2 D mx2 Cb. Using formula (6.2) for the distance, we obtain

□
In case you are wondering where the coordinate function f of (6.9) came from, here is
the heuristic reasoning that led to it. Once the equation of the line is expressed in the form
(6.8), it is tempting to use x as a coordinate function along the line, because (6.8) shows
that x can take any value and y is uniquely determined once x is known. Thus the function
f .x;y/ D x is a bijective function from ` to R, as you can easily check; but unfortunately
it does not satisfy (6.7) except in the special case m D 0 (which represents a horizontal
line). The solution is to rescale the x-coordinate by a constant multiple. A little trial and
error leads to the constant
p
1Cm2 and thus to the coordinate function f we have deﬁned.
The proofs of the remaining postulates are quite a bit longer. Rather than carrying
them out in detail, we just sketch the main ideas involved in each.
The following proof is rated R; the missing details, although they would take a while
to write out in full, are not beyond our scope.
Theorem 6.5. The Cartesian plane satisﬁes the plane separation postulate.
Sketch of proof. Suppose ` is a line. Then it is either a vertical line deﬁned by an equation
of the form x D c or a nonvertical line deﬁned by an equation of the form y D mx Cb. In
either case, we deﬁne a function LWR2 ! R as follows:
L.x;y/ D
®
x c
if ` is vertical;
y mx b
if ` is nonvertical:
Then it is immediate that a point .x;y/ lies on ` if and only if L.x;y/ D 0.
We deﬁne two subsets of the plane by
SC D f.x;y/ W L.x;y/ > 0g;
S D f.x;y/ W L.x;y/ < 0g:
By the trichotomy law for real numbers, every point not on ` is in one and only one of
these sets, so the set of points not on ` is the union of the two disjoint sets SC and S.
The other fact that needs to be proved is that for any two distinct points A;B … `,
AB \` D ¿ if and only if A and B lie on the same side of `. As we observed in the proof
of Theorem 3.43, this is equivalent to proving that AB \` ¤ ¿ if and only if A and B lie
on opposite sides.
The proof relies on two algebraic facts that we leave to you to verify. Let A D .x1;y1/
and B D .x2;y2/ be two distinct points that do not lie on `, and for any t 2 R, deﬁne a
point Pt 2 R2 by the formula

for each t 2 R:
(6.11)
In addition, by applying Lemma 3.23 (coordinate representation of a segment) to the co-
ordinate functions constructed in the proof of Theorem 6.4, we can prove the following
parametric characterization of the segment AB:
AB D fPt W 0  t  1g:
(6.12)
(Note that Lemma 3.23 was proved after we had introduced only Postulates 1–5, and we
have veriﬁed all of those postulates in the Cartesian plane, so the lemma applies here as
well.) Granting these facts, we can proceed with the proof.
Assume ﬁrst that A and B are on opposite sides of `, which means that L.A/ and
L.B/ have opposite signs. Interchanging the names of A and B if necessary, we may
assume that L.A/ < 0 and L.B/ > 0. Deﬁne a real number t by
t D
L.A/
L.B/L.A/:
Our assumptions guarantee that the numerator and denominator are both positive and the
numerator is strictly less than the denominator, so 0 < t < 1. Together with (6.12), this
implies that Pt 2 AB; and then (6.11) implies that L.Pt/ D 0, so that Pt 2 `. Therefore
AB \` ¤ ¿ as required.
Conversely, assume that AB \ ` ¤ ¿. Using (6.12), this implies that there is some
t 2 Œ0;1 such that Pt 2 `. If t were equal to 0 or 1, then Pt would be equal to A or B,
respectively; since we are assuming A and B do not lie on `, this is impossible. Thus
0 < t < 1. The fact that Pt 2 ` implies that L.Pt/ D 0, which by (6.11) means L.A/ C

L.B/L.A/

D 0. Because t ¤ 0, we can solve this equation for L.B/ to obtain
L.B/ D t 1

L.A/:
Because we know 0 < t < 1, the fraction on the right-hand side has negative numerator
and positive denominator, so L.A/ and L.B/ have opposite signs. This implies that A and
B are on opposite sides of ` as required.
□
The proof of the angle measure and protractor postulates is the most involved of all,
so we just brieﬂy sketch the main ideas. The proof of the following theorem is rated X;
one place where it is carried out in full is [MP91, Section 5.4].
Theorem 6.6. The Cartesian plane satisﬁes the angle measure postulate and the protrac-
tor postulate.
Sketch of proof.
With some basic tools of advanced calculus, it can be shown that the
arccosine function deﬁned by (6.4) is a bijective function from the interval Œ1;1 to the
interval Œ0;180. The angle measure postulate follows easily from this fact together with
some straightforward properties of the dot product.

The following corollary is an immediate consequence of Theorems 6.3–6.7.
Corollary 6.8. The Cartesian plane is a model of neutral geometry.
□
Thus we are assured that all of the theorems we have proved and will prove within the
axiomatic system are true statements about the Cartesian plane.
Corollary 6.9. The postulates of neutral geometry are consistent.
□
In addition, Theorem 2.23 showed that the Cartesian model satisﬁes the Euclidean
parallel postulate. Thus we have the following corollaries as well.
Corollary 6.10. The Cartesian plane is a model of Euclidean geometry.
□
Corollary 6.11. The postulates of Euclidean geometry are consistent.
□
A noteworthy fact about the Cartesian model is that every model of Euclidean geome-
try is isomorphic to it. Recall from Chapter 2 that an isomorphism between two models of
an axiomatic system is a bijective correspondence between the objects of the two models
that preserves all of the relevant relationships. For models of neutral geometry, this means
a one-to-one correspondence between the points of one model and the points of the other,
which takes lines to lines, distances to distances, and angle measures to angle measures.
An axiomatic system is said to be categorical if any two models of it are isomorphic to
each other. The basic fact about Euclidean geometry is that it is categorical: every model
of Euclidean geometry is isomorphic to the Cartesian plane. We do not yet have the tools
to prove this, but in Chapter 13 we will sketch a proof.
The Poincar´e Disk Model
Our next interpretation was ﬁrst introduced as a model of incidence geometry in Chapter 2.
Here we expand on that interpretation in order to make it into a model of neutral geometry.
Example 6.12 (The Poincar´e Disk). Let O D .0;0/ denote the origin in the Cartesian
plane, let C denote the circle in the Cartesian plane with center O and radius 1, and let D
denote the set of all Cartesian points whose Cartesian distance from O is strictly less than
1 (the points “inside” the circle C).
 A point is a Cartesian point lying in D, or in other words an ordered pair .x;y/
satisfying x2 Cy2 < 1.
 A line is a set of either one of the following two types:
(a) the set of all Cartesian points in D that lie on some Cartesian line through O or
(b) the set of all Cartesian points in D that lie on some Cartesian circle that intersects
the circle C perpendicularly.
 The distance between two points A and B in the Poincar´e disk model is the number
given by the formula

(6.14)

6. Models of Neutral Geometry
Fig. 6.7. Congruent pentagons in the Poincar´e disk.
Proof. We now have seen a model of neutral geometry (the Cartesian plane) in which the
Euclidean parallel postulate is true and another model (the Poincar´e disk) in which it is
false.
□
As we will show in Chapter 17, the Euclidean parallel postulate is equivalent to Eu-
clid’s ﬁfth postulate, so it follows also that Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate is independent of the
neutral postulates. Moreover, because Euclid’s ﬁrst four postulates are true in every model
of neutral geometry, this also shows that Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate is independent of his other
four.
As we discussed in Chapter 2, the only way to prove consistency of an axiomatic
system is relative to some other axiomatic system that we assume to be consistent. Our
proofs of the consistency of Euclidean geometry and hyperbolic geometry are based on the
assumption that the axiomatic underpinnings of set theory (and therefore also those of the
real numbers, vector algebra, analytic geometry, and calculus) are themselves consistent,
as virtually all mathematicians believe they are.
A remarkable thing about the Poincar´e disk model is that it is possible to deﬁne a
version of it using only the postulates of Euclidean geometry, not any particular model.
To see how this is done, assume that the postulates of Euclidean geometry are true; thus
we assume there is a set of points—which we call the Euclidean plane—satisfying all of
the axioms of Euclidean geometry. Then in the deﬁnition of the Poincar´e disk, in place
of the origin in the Cartesian plane, we can use any arbitrary point O in the Euclidean
plane, and in place of Cartesian lines, circles, distances, and angle measures, we use their
Euclidean counterparts. This leads to the conclusion that if the postulates of Euclidean
geometry are consistent, then the postulates of hyperbolic geometry are also consistent. It
was this observation that ﬁnally convinced mathematicians that hyperbolic geometry is no
less logically rigorous than its Euclidean counterpart.

Some Nonmodels
135
There are other models of hyperbolic geometry in addition to the Poincar´e disk. The
Beltrami–Klein model (Example 2.15), the Poincar´e half-plane model (Example 2.17),
and the hyperboloid model (Example 2.18) can all be turned into models of neutral ge-
ometry by suitably deﬁning distances and angle measures, and as we observed in Chapter
2, they all satisfy the hyperbolic parallel postulate. In fact, in Beltrami’s watershed pa-
per [Bel68] proving the consistency of hyperbolic geometry, he introduced three of these
models (Beltrami–Klein, Poincar´e disk, and Poincar´e half-plane) and proved that they are
all isomorphic to each other. He didn’t know about the hyperboloid model, which was
developed somewhat later, but it is isomorphic to the other three as well.
The deﬁnitions of distances and angle measures in these models are even more in-
volved than the deﬁnition of the Poincar´e disk model that we have given here, and are
more effectively studied in the context of differential geometry, a subject that brings so-
phisticated tools of calculus to bear on geometric questions. See [dC76] for an introduction
to differential geometry at the advanced undergraduate level.
As you can probably guess by looking at the complexity of the Poincar´e disk model,
proving Theorem 6.13 would be a challenging task indeed, which is why we have not
attempted to write down a proof. This is one reason it took so long for mathematicians
to realize that it was possible to construct a consistent model of non-Euclidean geometry
and therefore that Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate cannot be proved from the other ones. When we
study non-Euclidean geometry later in the course, we will often refer to the Poincar´e disk
model as a source of intuition.
Some Nonmodels
Next, we introduce a few interpretations of neutral geometry that are not models, because
one or more of the postulates are not satisﬁed. Looking at such nonmodels is useful be-
cause it demonstrates why we need the various postulates: if we can show that there is an
interpretation in which one of the postulates is false but some others are true, then we have
shown that the postulate that fails is independent of the ones that don’t.
To warm up, let us revisit some simple nonmodels that we touched on earlier.
Example 6.16 (One-Point Geometry). One-point geometry is the interpretation in which
there is exactly one point and there are no lines. We may deﬁne distances and angle mea-
sures however we like, because there are no pairs of points and no angles to which they
might apply. This satisﬁes all of the postulates of neutral geometry (vacuously) except the
existence postulate.
//
Example 6.17 (The Three-Point Plane). The three-point plane of Example 2.1 satisﬁes
the set postulate, the existence postulate, and the unique line postulate. However, no matter
how we deﬁne distances, it cannot satisfy the ruler postulate, because there is no bijective
function between any line in this interpretation and R, for the simple reason that each line
contains only two points, while R is an inﬁnite set. The same argument shows that no
interpretation with only ﬁnitely many points can be a model of neutral geometry.
//
Example 6.18 (Spherical Geometry). Spherical geometry is the interpretation described
in Example 2.13, in which a point is deﬁned to be a point on the surface of the unit sphere
in R3 and a line is a great circle on the sphere, i.e., a circle on the surface of the sphere
whose center coincides with the center of the sphere. No matter how we deﬁne distances

6. Models of Neutral Geometry
and angle measures, this interpretation cannot be turned into a model of neutral geometry
because it does not satisfy the unique line postulate.
//
Although the sphere does not satisfy all the postulates of neutral geometry, Riemann
argued that it does satisfy Euclid’s ﬁrst four postulates, provided we are careful how we
interpret them. For example, it is a straightforward exercise in three-dimensional analytic
geometry to prove that any two distinct points on the sphere are contained in a great circle,
so Euclid’s Postulate 1 is satisﬁed. The trickiest postulate to interpret is Euclid’s Postulate
2: if we interpret a “ﬁnite straight line” to mean an arc of a great circle and interpret
“produce” to mean that we can extend any arc to a longer arc in both directions, then this
postulate is also satisﬁed. The other three postulates are satisﬁed as well. However, as
we mentioned in Chapter 1, Euclid’s proof of the exterior angle inequality (Proposition
I.16) does not work on the sphere, and in fact that theorem is false in this interpretation.
This illustrates the fact that Proposition I.16 actually requires more postulates than Euclid
assumed. The postulates of neutral geometry are designed to ﬁll in these gaps.
Example 6.19 (Single Elliptic Geometry). Single elliptic geometry is the interpretation
of Example 2.14, in which a point is deﬁned to be a pair of antipodal points on the surface
of the unit sphere and a line is the set of all pairs of antipodal points lying on a speciﬁc
great circle. This interpretation satisﬁes the set, existence, and unique line postulates, as
well as the elliptic parallel postulate, as you can check. However, there is no way to deﬁne
distances and angle measures in such a way that the other postulates of neutral geometry
are true in this interpretation. We do not quite have the tools to prove this yet; but in the
next chapter we will show that there exist parallel lines in every model of neutral geometry,
which shows that single elliptic geometry cannot be such a model.
//
The next two nonmodels are the most important ones in this chapter.
Example 6.20 (The Rational Plane). In this interpretation, we deﬁne a point to be an
ordered pair .x;y/ of rational numbers and a line to be the set of all rational solutions
.x;y/ of an equation of one of the following two types:
x D c
for some rational constant cI
y D mx Cb
for some rational constants m and b:
Distances between points and measures of angles are deﬁned exactly as in the Cartesian
plane. (Note that the distance between two points might not be a rational number, but
this is not a problem because the distance postulate says that distance is supposed to be a
uniquely deﬁned real number.)
//
The rational plane satisﬁes the set, existence, unique line, and distance postulates, as
you can easily check. However, the next theorem shows that it is not a model of neutral
geometry.
Theorem 6.21. The rational plane does not satisfy the ruler postulate.
Proof. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that the ruler postulate were satisﬁed. Con-
sider the line ` deﬁned by the equation x D 0, which is the set of all points of the form

Thus y0 D ˙

is a contradiction.
□
One reason the rational plane is signiﬁcant is that it satisﬁes all ﬁve of Euclid’s pos-
tulates (or at least reasonable modern interpretations of those postulates) and yet some of
Euclid’s theorems are not true in it. Thus it demonstrates that some of the steps that Euclid
used in his proofs were not justiﬁed by his postulates. One such step occurs right away in
his very ﬁrst proof: in Proposition I.1 (constructing an equilateral triangle), Euclid starts
with an arbitrary line segment AB and draws circles with centers at A and B, both with
radius equal to AB. He then mentions “the point C, in which the circles cut one another.”
However, Euclid’s postulates do not guarantee that there exists such a point. For exam-
ple, in the rational plane, take A and B to be the points .1;0/ and .1;0/, respectively, so

Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is a point C D .x;y/ in the rational
plane that lies on both of the circles of radius 2 with centers at A and B (see Fig. 6.8). Be-
cause CA D CB D 2, the Cartesian formula for distance yields the following simultaneous
equations for the coordinates x and y:
4 D .CA/2 D .x C1/2 Cy2;
4 D .CB/2 D .x 1/2 Cy2:
Expanding the right-hand sides and subtracting the second equation from the ﬁrst, we
see that most of the terms cancel, yielding 0 D 2x  .2x/, which implies x D 0. Then
substituting this back into the ﬁrst equation, we obtain 4 D 1Cy2, or y2 D 3. This means
y D ˙

Lemma 6.22. Suppose n is a positive integer. If pn is not an integer, then it is irrational.


Independence of the Neutral Geometry Postulates
139
It can also be shown that taxicab geometry satisﬁes all ﬁve of Euclid’s postulates. This
demonstrates that Euclid’s proof of the SAS congruence theorem (Proposition I.4) is not
justiﬁed by his postulates, because if it were, it would have to be true in this model.
Independence of the Neutral Geometry Postulates
One desirable characteristic of any axiomatic system is that it should not contain any un-
necessary axioms. In particular, any axiom that can be proved as a theorem based on the
remaining axioms is redundant and does not need to be included in the system. The way
to avoid redundant axioms is to ensure that each axiom is independent of the others in the
sense we described in Chapter 2, meaning that it can neither be proved nor disproved from
the other axioms.
Of course, for pedagogical reasons, it is sometimes desirable to include some redun-
dant axioms—if their proofs would be too long or hard for the intended audience, for
example—and this is regularly done in high-school geometry books. But for the purpose
of understanding the structure of axiomatic Euclidean geometry, it is useful to know if the
postulates we have chosen are independent.
Some of our postulates require previous postulates before they even make sense—for
example, the angle measure postulate refers to half-rotations, which are deﬁned in terms
of sides of lines, which depend on the plane separation postulate for their very deﬁnition.
For this reason, we restrict our attention to the question of whether each postulate is inde-
pendent of the preceding ones. If the answer were no, then in a strictly logical sense, that
postulate would add nothing new to the axiomatic system and could have been omitted.
The next theorem shows that each of the neutral postulates does add something new
to our axiomatic system.
Theorem 6.24. Each of the postulates of neutral geometry is independent of the ones that
preceded it.
Sketch of proof. Because the Cartesian plane is an interpretation in which all nine neutral
postulates are true, to prove that each successive postulate is independent of the previous
ones, we need only exhibit a model in which the preceding postulates are true and the
new one is false. We consider each of the postulates in turn. For Postulate 1, there are no
preceding postulates, so we begin with the second.
2. THE EXISTENCE POSTULATE: One-point geometry (described in Example 2.6) is
an interpretation in which the set postulate is true but the existence postulate is false.
3. THE UNIQUE LINE POSTULATE: Square geometry (Example 2.10) is an interpreta-
tion in which Postulates 1 and 2 are true but Postulate 3 is false.
4. THE DISTANCE POSTULATE: If we start with the three-point plane and deﬁne the
distance between any two points to be equal to 1, we get an interpretation in which
Postulates 1–3 are true but the distance postulate is false.
5. THE RULER POSTULATE: Again start with the three-point plane, but now deﬁne the
distance between any two distinct points to be 1, while the distance between any point
and itself is zero. This satisﬁes the ﬁrst four postulates but not the ruler postulate.
6. THE PLANE SEPARATION POSTULATE: There is a three-dimensional analogue of
the Cartesian plane, in which points are ordered triples of real numbers, lines are

140
6. Models of Neutral Geometry
sets of points satisfying pairs of independent simultaneous linear equations, and the
distance between two points .x1;y1;z1/ and .x2;y2;z2/ is

.x2 x1/2 C.y2 y1/2 C.z2 z1/2:
(6.15)
Using an analysis similar to the one we used for the Cartesian plane, it can be shown
that this interpretation satisﬁes Postulates 1–5 but not the plane separation postulate.
7. THE ANGLE MEASURE POSTULATE: If we start with the Cartesian plane but rede-
ﬁne the measures of all angles to be, say, 360ı, then the ﬁrst six postulates hold but
the angle measure postulate does not.
8. THE PROTRACTOR POSTULATE: As in the previous example, start with the Cartesian
plane, but now redeﬁne all angle measures to be 0ı. Then Postulates 1–7 are satisﬁed,
but the protractor postulate is not.
9. THE SAS POSTULATE: As we noted above, taxicab geometry is an interpretation in
which Postulates 1–8 are all satisﬁed, but the SAS postulate is not.
Thus each of the nine postulates of neutral geometry is independent of all of the previous
ones.

Chapter 7
Perpendicular and Parallel
Lines
In this chapter, we undertake an in-depth study of properties of perpendicular and parallel
lines in neutral geometry.
Perpendicular Lines
First we focus on perpendicular lines. Recall that if ` and m are lines, we say by deﬁnition
that ` and m are perpendicular, denoted by ` ? m, if they intersect at a point O and at
least one of the rays in ` starting at O makes a right angle with at least one of the rays in
m starting at O. The four right angles theorem (Theorem 4.29) shows that in this case, all
four angles formed by ` and m are right angles.
Sometimes it is also useful to talk about segments or rays being perpendicular to other
segments, rays, or lines. In that case, as we did for parallelism, we need a slightly more
complicated deﬁnition. If S1 is a segment, ray, or line and S2 is another segment, ray, or
line, we say that S1 and S2 are perpendicular, symbolized also by S1 ? S2, if S1 and S2
intersect and the lines containing them are perpendicular (see Fig. 7.1).
Fig. 7.1. Perpendicular segments.
Given a line ` and a point A 2 `, Theorem 4.30 showed that there is a unique line that
is perpendicular to ` through A. The next theorem (corresponding to Euclid’s Proposition
141

142
7. Perpendicular and Parallel Lines
I.12) is complementary to that one: it shows that we can always ﬁnd a unique perpendicular
to ` through a point A not on `. Constructing such a line is called dropping a perpendicular
from A to `. As mentioned in Chapter 1, Euclid’s proof of Proposition I.12 relied on facts
about intersections of lines and circles that were not justiﬁed by his postulates. We will be
able to justify those facts in Chapter 14, but the following proof circumvents the problem
by avoiding the use of circles altogether. The reason we did not prove this theorem in
Chapter 4 is that the proof uses the SAS postulate.
Theorem 7.1 (Dropping a Perpendicular). Suppose ` is a line and A is a point not on `.
Then there exists a unique line that contains A and is perpendicular to `.
Proof. First we will prove existence. Choose three points B;C;D 2 ` such that B C D.
By the angle construction theorem, there is a unique ray on the other side of ` from A that
makes an angle with
!
CD that is congruent to †ACD. Choose A0 on that ray such that
CA0 Š CA, and let m D
 !
AA0 . The proof will be completed by showing that m ? `.
Now, †ACD Š †A0CD by construction. Note also that †ACB and †ACD form
a linear pair, as do †A0CB and †A0CD (Fig. 7.2). Because †ACB and †A0CB are
supplements of the congruent angles †ACD and †A0CD, they are also congruent to each
other.
Because A and A0 are on opposite sides of `, there is a point F where AA0 intersects `.
If F is equal to C, then †AFD and †A0FD form a linear pair. Since they are congruent
by construction, they are both right angles. This means that m ? `, and we are done.

On the other hand, suppose F ¤ C. Then either F 2 Int

the argument is the same in both cases except with the roles of B and D reversed, we may
assume that F 2 Int

CD . Since †ACF Š †A0CF , CA Š CA0, and CF is congruent to
itself, we have 4ACF Š 4A0CF by SAS. Therefore †AFC Š †A0FC. Since these
angles are congruent and form a linear pair, they are both right angles, and thus m ? `.
This completes the proof of existence.
Now we have to prove uniqueness. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that m and m0
are two distinct lines through A and perpendicular to `. Let F be the point where m meets

Perpendicular Lines
143
`, and let F 0 be the point where m0 meets ` (Fig. 7.3). Then F ¤ F 0 because otherwise m
would be equal to m0, and A, F , and F 0 are noncollinear because collinearity would imply
A 2 `. Thus 4AFF 0 is a triangle. By the four right angles theorem, both †AFF 0 and
†AF 0F are right angles. Thus 4AFF 0 has two right angles, which contradicts Corollary
5.15 (every triangle has at least two acute angles).
□
In the situation of the preceding theorem, the point F where m intersects ` is called
the foot of the perpendicular from A to `.
There will be many situations in which it is important to know whether the foot of a
perpendicular to a given line lies in a certain ray or segment within that line. There are
some simple criteria that can be used to determine this. We begin with rays.
Theorem 7.2. Suppose
!
AB is a ray, P is a point not on
 !
AB , and F is the foot of the
perpendicular from P to
 !
AB (Fig. 7.4).
(a) F D A if and only if †PAB is a right angle.
(b) F 2 Int

Proof. Let
!
AB , P , and F be as in the hypothesis. We begin by proving the “only if ” part
of each statement.
For (a), suppose F D A. This means that
 !
PA is perpendicular to
 !
AB , so †PAB is a
right angle by the four right angles theorem.
Next, for (b), suppose F 2 Int
!
AB . Because P …
 !
AB , the points P , F , and A are
noncollinear, so they form a right triangle with right angle at F . It follows from Corollary
5.15 that †PAF is acute, and our hypothesis guarantees that †PAF D †PAB.
For (c), assume that F lies in the ray opposite
!
AB . Then just as above, 4PFA is
a right triangle with right angle at F , and thus †PAF is acute. In this case, †PAF and
†PAB form a linear pair and are thus supplementary, from which it follows that †PAB
is obtuse. This completes the proofs of the “only if ” parts.
Now, the “if ” parts follow from these: suppose ﬁrst that †PAB is a right angle. Then
F cannot lie in Int
!
AB , because the argument above would imply that †PAB is acute; and
F cannot lie in the interior of the ray opposite
!
AB , because then †PAB would be obtuse;
so F D A is the only possibility. Similarly, if †PAB is acute, then F cannot be equal to
A or lie in the interior of the ray opposite
!
AB , so it must lie in Int
!
AB . The argument for
(c) is the same.

The Altitudes of a Triangle
Many applications of the preceding theorem are based on dropping a perpendicular
from a vertex of a triangle to the line containing the opposite side. If 4ABC is a triangle
and F is the foot of the perpendicular from a vertex A to the line
 !
BC that contains the
opposite side, then the segment AF is called the altitude from A to BC .
In general, an altitude to a side might or might not intersect that side (see Fig. 7.5).
The next theorem shows how to determine where the foot of an altitude is located.

Theorem 7.3. Let 4ABC be a triangle, and let F be the foot of the altitude from A to

(a) F D B if and only if †B is right, and F D C if and only if †C is right.
(b) B F C if and only if †B and †C are both acute.
(c) F B C if and only if †B is obtuse, and B C F if and only if †C is obtuse.
Proof. Part (a) follows immediately from Theorem 7.2(a).
Next we prove (c). Note that F B C if and only if F lies in the interior of the ray
opposite
!
BC , which by Theorem 7.2(c) is true if and only if †B is obtuse. The argument
for †C is similar.
Finally, to prove (b), suppose B F C. Then (a) shows that neither B nor C is a right
angle, and (c) shows that neither one is obtuse, so they must both be acute. Conversely,
suppose †B and †C are both acute. Then (a) shows that F is not equal to B or C, and (c)
shows that it cannot satisfy F B C or B C F . By Theorem 3.12, the only remaining
possibility is B F C.
□
Corollary 7.4. In any triangle, the altitude to the longest side always intersects the interior
of that side.
Proof. Let 4ABC be a triangle, and assume the vertices are labeled so that AB is the
longest side. Then †C is the largest angle by the scalene inequality. At least two of the
angles of 4ABC are acute; thus if any angle is not acute, it must be †C. It follows that
†A and †B are both acute, and the result follows from the previous theorem.
□
Corollary 7.5. In a right triangle, the altitude to the hypotenuse always intersects the
interior of the hypotenuse.
Proof. The hypotenuse is the longest side.

Perpendicular Lines
145
In any triangle, a segment joining a vertex to the midpoint of the opposite side is
called a median of the triangle. Ordinarily, the median and the altitude to a given side are
different; but for the base of an isosceles triangle they are not.
Theorem 7.6 (Isosceles Triangle Altitude Theorem). The altitude to the base of an
isosceles triangle is also the median to the base and is contained in the bisector of the
angle opposite the base (see Fig. 7.6).

Perpendicular Bisectors
Suppose AB is a segment. A perpendicular bisector of AB is a line that is perpen-
dicular to AB and contains its midpoint.

Proof. Exercise 7B.

The Distance from a Point to a Line
We all understand from our everyday experience that the shortest distance from a point
to a line is along a straight path perpendicular to the line. For example, if you want to get
to a nearby road, you will have the shortest distance to walk if you follow a path that meets
the road at right angles. We can now give a rigorous geometric justiﬁcation for this fact.
First we start with some general deﬁnitions. Suppose S is a set of points in the plane
and P is any point (which might or might not lie in S). A point C 2 S is said to be a
closest point to P in S if P C  PX for every point X 2 S. Note that for certain sets,
there might be more than one closest point, and for others, there might be none at all, as
the following examples show.
If there is a closest point to P in S, we deﬁne the distance from P to S, symbolized
by d.P;S/, to be the distance from P to any closest point in S.
Example 7.11 (Closest Points).
(a) If S is any set of points and P 2 S, then the distance from P to itself is zero, while
the distance from P to any other point of S is positive; thus P itself is the unique
closest point to P in S, and d.P;S/ D 0.
(b) If C is a circle and O is its center, then the distance from O to every point of C is the
same, so every point on C is closest to O and d.O;C/ is equal to the radius of C.
(c) If AB is a segment and S is the set of all interior points of AB, then there is no closest
point to A in S.
//
The next simple lemma can be useful in identifying closest points.

Perpendicular Lines
147
Lemma 7.12 (Properties of Closest Points). Let P be a point and let S be any set of
points.
(a) If C is a closest point to P in S, then another point C 0 2 S is also a closest point to
P if and only if P C 0 D P C.
(b) If C is a point in S such that PX > P C for every point X 2 S other than C, then C
is the unique closest point to P in S.
Proof. Exercise 7E.

The next theorem shows that the closest point on a line is easy to ﬁnd: it is the foot of
the perpendicular from the point to the line. It also says that points farther away from the
foot are also farther away from the original point.

(a) F is the unique closest point to P on `.
(b) If A and B are points on ` such that F AB, then PB > PA.
Proof. Exercise 7F.
□
The next theorem shows that segments also have unique closest points. Its proof is
rated PG; the only place it will be used in this book is in Exercise 8A.
Theorem 7.14 (Closest Point on a Segment). Suppose AB is a segment and P is any
point. Then there is a unique closest point to P in AB.
Proof. Exercise 7G.
□
If ` and m are two distinct lines, a point P is said to be equidistant from ` and m if
d.P;`/ D d.P;m/. This deﬁnition is useful for expressing the following property of angle
bisectors, analogous to the perpendicular bisector theorem.
Theorem 7.15 (Angle Bisector Theorem). Suppose †AOB is a proper angle and P is a
point on the bisector of †AOB. Then P is equidistant from

OA and
 !
OB . (See Fig. 7.10.)
Proof. Exercise 7H.
□
Like the perpendicular bisector theorem, the angle bisector theorem has an important
converse. However, the full converse is not true: a point can be equidistant from the lines
containing the sides of an angle without lying on the bisector, because it might not be in
the interior of the angle. But if we assume in addition that the point is in the interior, then

it must lie on the bisector, as Theorem 7.17 below will show. The proof will rely on the

Parallel Lines
Now we are ready to start studying parallel lines. Recall that our deﬁnition of parallel
lines is simply lines that do not intersect.
One consequence of the deﬁnition of parallelism is immediate.
Lemma 7.18. Suppose ` is a line and S is a segment, ray, or line that is parallel to `.
Then all points of S lie on the same side of `.
Proof. Let A be any point of S. We need to show that every other point B 2 S is on the
same side of ` as A. If B D A, there is nothing to prove, so suppose B is a point of S
that is distinct from A. Then the line containing S is

Many of the criteria for determining when two lines are parallel refer to the following
situation: suppose ` and `0 are lines (not necessarily assumed to be parallel). We say that a
line t is a transversal for ` and `0 if t, `, and `0 are all distinct and t intersects ` and `0 at
two different points (Fig. 7.12). If t is a transversal for ` and `0, we often say that ` and `0
are cut by t.

Fig. 7.12. A transversal.
A transversal makes eight different angles at the points of intersection with the lines
that it cuts, which can be classiﬁed into several different categories. In order to describe
these efﬁciently, we introduce the following terminological shortcut, which is an extension
of our convention for saying that “a ray lies on a side of a line”: if †AOB is an angle and
S is one of the sides of the line
 !
OA, we will say that †AOB lies on side S if the ray
!
OB
lies on that side (which just means, of course, that its interior points lie on side S).
Suppose t is a transversal that intersects ` at A and `0 at A0. The interior angles are
the two angles made by t and ` on the same side of ` as A0 and the two angles made by

150
7. Perpendicular and Parallel Lines
t and `0 on the same side of `0 as A. (Note that in general, it is not enough to say “the
same side of `0 as `” or vice versa—we are not insisting that ` and `0 are parallel, so not
all points of ` will necessarily be on the same side of `0.) The exterior angles are the other
four: the two angles made by t and ` on the opposite side of ` from A0 and the two angles
made by t and `0 on the opposite side of `0 from A. Thus in Fig. 7.12, the interior angles
are †3, †4, †5, and †6, while the others are exterior angles.
Two angles, one of which has its vertex at A and the other at A0, are called
 alternate interior angles if they are interior angles lying on opposite sides of the
transversal;
 consecutive interior angles if they are interior angles lying on the same side of the
transversal; and
 corresponding angles if one is an interior angle and the other is an exterior angle and
both lie on the same side of the transversal.
Thus in Fig. 7.12, we have the following pairs of angles.
 Alternate interior angles: †3 and †6; †4 and †5.
 Consecutive interior angles: †3 and †5; †4 and †6.
 Corresponding angles: †1 and †5; †2 and †6; †3 and †7; †4 and †8.
When proving theorems involving angles formed by transversals, it is important to
verify that two angles that are claimed to be alternate interior angles (or corresponding
angles or consecutive interior angles) do indeed satisfy the deﬁnitions. Usually this will
follow very easily from the way the angles are deﬁned (as well as being evident from the
diagram), and in these cases it can simply be asserted that a pair of angles is as it appears.
But occasionally there are situations in which it is not at all straightforward to show that
an angle lies on a certain side of a line, so a detailed proof must be given. We will mention
these situations when they arise.
The next theorem is one of the most important criteria for proving that two lines are
parallel. It is Euclid’s Proposition I.27, with the same proof.

Theorem 7.19 (Alternate Interior Angles Theorem). If two lines are cut by a transversal
making a pair of congruent alternate interior angles (Fig. 7.13 ), then they are parallel.
Proof. Suppose ` and `0 are lines and t is a transversal that meets them at A and A0,
respectively. (The assumption that t is a transversal includes the assertion that ` and `0 are

distinct.) We need to show that the existence of a pair of congruent alternate interior angles
implies ` k `0. We will prove the contrapositive: if ` and `0 are not parallel, then neither
pair of alternate interior angles can be congruent.
Assume ` and `0 are not parallel. Let B be the point where ` meets `0 (Fig. 7.14),
and choose points C and C 0 such that C AB and C 0 A0 B. Note that both †CAA0
and †C 0A0A are exterior angles for 4AA0B, so the exterior angle inequality shows that
m†CAA0 > m†AA0B and m†C 0A0A > m†A0AB. Thus neither pair of alternate interior
angles is congruent.

Here are several other important criteria for parallelism, all of which follow easily
from the preceding theorem. The ﬁrst of these is Euclid’s Proposition I.28.

Corollary 7.21 (Consecutive Interior Angles Theorem).
If two lines are cut by a
transversal making a pair of supplementary consecutive interior angles (Fig. 7.16), then
they are parallel.
Proof. Exercise 7K.
□
Corollary 7.22 (Common Perpendicular Theorem). If two distinct lines have a common
perpendicular (i.e., a line that is perpendicular to both), then they are parallel.
Proof. Suppose ` and `0 are distinct lines and t is a line perpendicular to both of them.
Then ` and `0 cannot intersect t at the same point, because there is only one perpendicular
to t through a given point. Thus the intersection points are different, which means that t
is a transversal for ` and `0. Because it makes a pair of congruent corresponding angles, it
follows that ` k `0.
□
One property of parallel lines that is familiar from our everyday experience is that they
are everywhere the same distance apart. To make this idea precise, we make the following
deﬁnitions. If A and B are points and m is a line, we say that A and B are equidistant
from m if d.A;m/ D d.B;m/. If ` is another line, we say that ` is equidistant from m if
all points on ` are equidistant from m.

152
7. Perpendicular and Parallel Lines
We will show that if two lines are equidistant, then they are parallel. In fact, we can
prove something much stronger: as long as there are at least two distinct points on one line
that are the same distance from another line and on the same side of that line, it follows
that the two lines are parallel. The next proof is rated PG.
Theorem 7.23 (Two-Point Equidistance Theorem). Suppose ` and m are two distinct
lines and there exist two distinct points on ` that are on the same side of m and equidistant
from m. Then ` k m.
Proof. Let A and B be distinct points on ` that are on the same side of m and equidistant
from m, and assume for the sake of contradiction that ` and m are not parallel. Let X be
the (unique) point where they intersect. Then X cannot be between A and B, because that
would force A and B to lie on opposite sides of m. Without loss of generality, assume that
AB X (Fig. 7.17), which implies AX > BX.

Let F be the foot of the perpendicular from A to m, and let G be the foot of the
perpendicular from B to m, so the hypothesis means AF D BG. First we need to prove
that F , G, and X are all distinct. Assume they are not; then we will show that in fact
F D G D X, and this will lead to a contradiction. If either F or G were equal to X, then
 !
AB would be perpendicular to m, which would imply F D G D X. On the other hand,

AB because the unique perpendicular to m through F would
contain both A and B, and once again we would have F D G D X. In either case, we
conclude AF D AX > BX D BG, contradicting our assumption that AF D BG.
Next we need to show that F  G  X. The common perpendicular theorem implies
that

that ` and m intersect must have been wrong.
□
Corollary 7.24 (Equidistance Theorem). If one of two distinct lines is equidistant from
the other, then they are parallel.
Proof. Suppose ` and m are distinct lines and ` is equidistant from m. Since the lines are
distinct, there can be at most one point that lies on both, so there are inﬁnitely many distinct
points that lie on ` and not on m. At least two of these points must lie on the same side of

m. The hypothesis implies that these two points are equidistant from m, so Theorem 7.23
implies that ` k m.
□
In high-school geometry, you might have been introduced to some or all of the above
theorems and corollaries as “if and only if ” statements. For example, in some high-school
texts, the name “alternate interior angles theorem” is given to a statement like the follow-
ing: if two lines are cut by a transversal, then the two lines are parallel if and only if the
transversal makes congruent alternate interior angles, with similar statements for Corol-
laries 7.20–7.22 and 7.24. Be sure to observe that we have only proved one implication in
each of these theorems—in every case, we have proved sufﬁcient criteria for parallelism
(“congruent alternate interior angles imply parallel lines”) but not necessary consequences
of parallelism (“parallel lines make congruent alternate interior angles”). The converses of
all of these theorems are true in Euclidean geometry, as we will see later; however, they
are decidedly false in hyperbolic geometry, so they cannot be proved using the axioms of
neutral geometry.
The Existence of Parallel Lines
The next theorem is our version of Euclid’s Proposition I.31. It shows that parallel
lines exist in abundance. We give a proof that is different from Euclid’s, because it allows
us to prove a little more than Euclid did (namely, the ﬁnal statement about a common
perpendicular).
Theorem 7.25 (Existence of Parallels). For every line ` and every point A that does not
lie on `, there exists a line m such that A lies on m and m k `. It can be chosen so that `
and m have a common perpendicular that contains A.

Fig. 7.18. Constructing a parallel.
Proof. Let ` be a line and let A be a point not on `. Let t be the line through A and
perpendicular to ` (which exists and is unique by Theorem 7.1), and then let m be the line
through A and perpendicular to t (which exists and is unique by Theorem 4.30); see Fig.
7.18. Because ` and m have t as a common perpendicular, they are parallel.
□
It is important to note that the preceding theorem is a theorem in neutral geometry,
so it is true in every model of neutral geometry. We can now say conclusively that the
elliptic parallel postulate is inconsistent with the postulates of neutral geometry, because
it contradicts the preceding theorem. Therefore, neither spherical geometry nor single
elliptic geometry is a model of neutral geometry, because they both satisfy the elliptic
parallel postulate.

154
7. Perpendicular and Parallel Lines
On the other hand, it is equally important to note that we have not yet claimed that
the parallel through A is unique. Indeed, we will see later that as long as we are working
in the context of neutral geometry, it need not be. You might be tempted to think that
we have actually proved uniqueness, because the lines t and m we constructed in the proof
above were the unique ones through A and perpendicular to ` and t, respectively. However,
this in itself does not prove that m is the unique line through A and parallel to `; it only
proves that it is the unique such line that can be constructed by this procedure. This is
a good illustration of why it is usually necessary to provide a proof of uniqueness that is
separate from the proof of existence. It is the uniqueness of the parallel through A that
distinguishes Euclidean geometry from non-Euclidean geometry; and it cannot be proved
from the axioms of neutral geometry.

Chapter 8
Polygons
So far, we have concentrated most of our attention on triangles because they are the basic
building blocks for most geometric shapes. Nearly as important as triangles are ﬁgures with
four or more sides. Roughly speaking, a closed ﬁgure formed by three or more segments
joined end to end is called a polygon. This chapter is devoted to developing some basic
properties of polygons in neutral geometry.
Polygons
Here is the ofﬁcial deﬁnition. A polygon is a union of n distinct segments for some n  3,
satisfying the following conditions:
(i) There are n distinct points A1;:::;An such that the given segments are A1A2, A2A3,
. . . , An1An, AnA1.
(ii) Two of the segments intersect only if they share a common endpoint, in which case
the two intersecting segments are noncollinear.
Fig. 8.1 shows several examples of polygons, while Fig. 8.2 shows some examples of
unions of segments that are not polygons.

sides), pentagon (ﬁve), hexagon (six), heptagon (seven), octagon (eight), nonagon (nine),
decagon (ten), and dodecagon (twelve). Sometimes we will call a polygon with n sides an
n-gon.
The deﬁnition of a polygon requires that each pair of adjacent edges must be non-
collinear, to rule out cases like the “pentagon” ABCDE pictured in Fig. 8.5, which has
a pair of collinear adjacent edges. This union of line segments is actually a quadrilateral,

not a pentagon. If we allowed it to be considered as a pentagon just by picking one of the
points in the middle of a side and calling it a vertex, there would be nothing stopping us
from adding two, three, or a hundred more vertices to the same ﬁgure. One of the main
reasons why we require properness in the deﬁnition of a polygon is so that each polygon
will have an unambiguous number of edges and vertices.
Just as we did for triangles, in order to talk about “the vertices” of a polygon, we
should ﬁrst verify that they do not depend on the particular notation chosen to designate
the polygon. The PG-rated proof of the next theorem is somewhat more difﬁcult than that
of the corresponding theorem for triangles since vertices of polygons might not be extreme
points. Since we will not use this result anywhere in the book, we leave the proof as an
exercise with hints. (For the kind of polygons on which we will focus most of our attention,
called convex polygons, there is an easier proof; see Theorem 8.3 below.)
Theorem 8.1 (Consistency of Polygon Vertices).
Suppose P D A1 :::An and Q D
B1 :::Bm are polygons such that P D Q. Then the two sets of vertices fA1;:::;Ang and
fB1;:::;Bmg are equal.
Proof. Exercise 8A.
□
Convex Polygons
Some of the most important theorems we will prove about polygons, like theorems we
have already seen about triangles, refer to the interior angles of the polygon. For a trian-
gle 4ABC, the interior angles are just the angles of the triangle: †ABC, †BCA, and
†CAB. But when deﬁning interior angles for general polygons, there is a complication
that did not arise in the case of triangles. To see why, consider the quadrilateral ABCD
pictured in Fig. 8.6: the two edges that meet at D determine †CDA, which is by deﬁni-
tion one of the “angles of ABCD.” However, for vertices that “point inward” like D, we
would wish to use the reﬂex measure of †D as the “interior angle measure” at that vertex
instead of its standard measure. This will be an issue, for example, in deﬁning what we
mean by congruence of polygons (where we wish to say that the interior angle measures
of corresponding angles are equal), in deﬁning equiangular polygons (since it is the inte-
rior angle measures that should be equal), and in deﬁning interior angle sums for arbitrary

polygons. As we will see later in this chapter, it is possible to classify the vertices of an
arbitrary polygon into convex vertices (which point outward) and concave vertices (which
point inward), but doing so takes a good deal of work. For most of the purposes we have
in mind it is sufﬁcient to focus on polygons that do not have this problem.
For that reason, we will primarily restrict our attention to polygons that “lie on one
side of each edge.” More precisely, we make the following deﬁnitions. Suppose P is a
polygon. Any line that contains an edge of P is called an edge line for P . We say that
P is a convex polygon if for each edge line ` of P , the entire polygon P is contained in
one of the closed half-planes determined by `. A polygon that is not convex is called a
concave polygon. The polygons in Figs. 8.3 and 8.7 are convex; however, the one in Fig.
8.6 is concave because A and B are on opposite sides of

Fig. 8.7. A convex polygon.
Suppose P is a convex polygon and ` is an edge line for P . Then by deﬁnition of
convexity, there is one and only one side of ` that contains points of P . For convenience,
we call that the P -side of `. The deﬁnition of convexity implies that every point of P is
either on ` or on the P -side of `. The next lemma shows exactly which points lie on `.
Lemma 8.2 (Edge-Line Lemma). If P is a convex polygon and AB is an edge of P , then

consecutive with B. Then C cannot lie on

The edge-line lemma is a major ingredient of the proof of the following theorem.
Theorem 8.3. If P is a convex polygon, then the extreme points of P are its vertices and
no other points.
Proof. Exercise 8B.
□
Despite the terminology, a convex polygon (which is, after all, just a union of seg-
ments) is not a convex set, because there are many pairs of points on the polygon such
that the segment connecting them is not contained in the union of the edges. But the two
notions of convexity are closely related, as we will see later in the chapter.
For the special case of convex polygons, we can deﬁne several concepts relating to
interior angle measures without difﬁculty. First, if P is a convex polygon, we simply deﬁne
the interior angle measure of each of its angles to be the standard measure of that angle.
We say a polygon is equilateral if all of its side lengths are equal, and it is equiangular if
it is convex and all of its interior angle measures are equal. A regular polygon is one that
is both equilateral and equiangular.
A major focus of our study will be congruence of polygons. For convex polygons, the
deﬁnition of congruence is a straightforward generalization of the deﬁnition for triangles.
Two convex polygons are said to be congruent if there is a one-to-one correspondence be-
tween their vertices such that consecutive vertices correspond to consecutive vertices and
all pairs of corresponding sides and all pairs of corresponding angles are congruent. The
notation A1 :::An Š B1 :::Bn means that the polygons A1 :::An and B1 :::Bn are congru-
ent under the correspondence A1 $ B1, . . . , An $ Bn. We are restricting the deﬁnition
to convex polygons for now because this deﬁnition might give undesired congruences for
nonconvex polygons, since it doesn’t distinguish between convex and concave vertices.
For example, each of the polygons pictured in Fig. 8.9 has twenty congruent sides and
twenty right angles; thus there is a correspondence between their vertices such that con-
secutive vertices correspond to consecutive vertices and all pairs of corresponding angles
and all pairs of corresponding sides are congruent. But we do not want to consider these
polygons to be congruent to each other, for obvious reasons. At the end of the chapter, we
will brieﬂy describe how congruence can be deﬁned for nonconvex polygons.

160
8. Polygons
Fig. 8.9. Noncongruent polygons.
Because convexity of polygons is such an important property, it is useful to have sev-
eral different ways of characterizing it. The next few theorems will describe several such
ways.
Theorem 8.4 (Vertex Criterion for Convexity). A polygon P is convex if and only if for
every edge of P , the vertices of P that are not on that edge all lie on the same side of the
line containing the edge.
Proof. Let P be a polygon. First assume that P is convex, and let AB be one of the edges
of P . By deﬁnition, all of the vertices of P are contained in one of the closed half-planes
deﬁned by
 !
AB . The edge-line lemma shows that no vertices other than A and B lie on
 !
AB , so all of the other vertices actually lie in the corresponding open half-plane, which
means that they all lie on the same side of
 !
AB .
Conversely, assume that P has the property that for every edge, the vertices not on
that edge all lie on the same side of the line containing the edge. If AB is any edge, then it
follows from the hypothesis that all of the vertices of P lie in one of the closed half-planes
deﬁned by
 !
AB ; since a closed half-plane is a convex set, it follows that all of the edges of
P lie in that closed half-plane as well. Thus P is convex.
□
Corollary 8.5. Every triangle is a convex polygon.
Proof. Let 4ABC be a triangle. For each edge of 4ABC, the vertices not on that edge lie
on one side of the line containing the edge, for the simple reason that there is only one such
vertex, and it does not lie on the line because the vertices of a triangle are noncollinear.
□
The next characterization relates convexity of a polygon to interiors of angles.
Theorem 8.6 (Angle Criterion for Convexity). A polygon P is convex if and only if for
each vertex Ai of P , all the vertices of P are contained in the interior of †Ai except Ai
itself and the two vertices consecutive with it (see Fig. 8.10).
Proof. Exercise 8C.
□
To describe the next criterion for convexity, we introduce another deﬁnition. Recall
that we have deﬁned two segments to be parallel if the lines containing them are parallel.
More generally, we say that two segments are semiparallel if neither of the segments inter-
sects the line containing the other (Fig. 8.11). Thus segments AB and CD are semiparallel
if AB \

and semiparallel implies disjoint; but neither of these implications is reversible, as Fig.
8.11 illustrates.

Disjoint, not semiparallel
Fig. 8.11. Parallel, semiparallel, and disjoint segments.
Theorem 8.7 (Semiparallel Criterion for Convexity). A polygon is convex if and only if
all pairs of nonadjacent edges are semiparallel.
Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that P is convex. Given any pair of nonadjacent edges of P , say AB
and CD, Theorem 8.4 implies that A and B lie on one side of
 !
CD , so AB \
 !
CD D ¿. A
similar argument shows that CD \

AB D ¿, so AB and CD are semiparallel.
Conversely, suppose that all pairs of nonadjacent edges are semiparallel. Choose an
arbitrary edge of P , and label the vertices A1;:::;An consecutively in such a way that the
chosen edge is A1A2. Because P is a polygon, A3 does not lie on
 !
A1A2 . Let S denote
the side of
 !
A1A2 that contains A3. If there are more than three vertices, the hypothesis
implies that A3A4 does not meet
 !
A1A2 , so A4 also lies on side S. Continuing in this way,
we see that A3;A4;:::;An all lie on side S. The same argument works starting with any
other edge, so P is a convex polygon by the vertex criterion.
□
One way in which convex polygons frequently arise is by splitting other convex poly-
gons into two pieces along a line segment. Some typical situations are illustrated in Fig.
8.12; in each of these pictures, a large convex polygon is split into two smaller convex
polygons by a line segment connecting two points on the large polygon.
The next theorem will demonstrate an important and useful fact: the new polygons that
result from such splittings are always convex. To streamline the statement of the theorem,
let us introduce a few deﬁnitions. If P is a convex polygon, a chord of P is a line segment
whose endpoints both lie on P but are not both contained in any single edge.

(a) If both B and C are (necessarily nonconsecutive) vertices (Fig. 8.14(a)), we can label
the vertices of P as A1;:::;An such that B D Ai and C D Aj with i < i C 1 < j ,
and then
P1 D A1 :::Ai1BCAjC1 :::An
and
P2 D BAiC1:::Aj 1C:
(b) If one of the endpoints of the chord (say B) is a vertex but the other is not (Fig.
8.14(b)), we can label the vertices so that B D Ai and C 2 IntAj Aj C1 with i < j < n,
and then
P1 D A1 :::Ai1BCAjC1 :::An
and
P2 D BAiC1:::Aj 1Aj C:
(c) If neither B nor C is a vertex (Fig. 8.14(c)), we can label the vertices so that B 2
IntAiAiC1 and C 2 IntAj AjC1 with i < j < n, and then
P1 D A1 :::AiBCAjC1 :::An
and
P2 D BAiC1:::Aj C:
It is not immediately obvious that P1 and P2 will necessarily be polygons (for ex-
ample, do the deﬁnitions guarantee that three consecutive vertices are necessarily non-
collinear?); but the next theorem shows that they are indeed polygons, and in fact they are
always convex. This proof is rated PG.
Theorem 8.9 (Polygon Splitting Theorem). If P is a convex polygon and BC is a chord
of P , then the two subpolygons cut off by BC are both convex polygons.
Proof. Let P D A1 :::An be a convex polygon, let BC be a chord of P , and let P1 and
P2 be the subpolygons cut off by BC as in the deﬁnition above. The proofs that P1 and
P2 are convex polygons are identical except for notation, so we will consider only P2.
We need to show that P2 is in fact a polygon; but ﬁrst we will show that all pairs
of nonadjacent edges of P2 are semiparallel. Any two nonadjacent edges of P2 that are
already edges (or parts of edges) of P are automatically semiparallel because P is convex;
so we need only show that if AkAkC1 is any edge of P2 not adjacent to BC, then BC
and AkAkC1 are semiparallel. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that they are not. One
way this can happen is that there is a point X 2 BC \
 !
AkAkC1 . If X D B or X D C, then
X 2 P , so X actually lies in AkAkC1 by the edge-line lemma, but this is a contradiction
because AkAkC1 is not adjacent to BC. On the other hand, if B  X  C, then either B
and C both lie on
 !
AkAkC1 , which again contradicts the edge-line lemma, or B and C lie
on opposite sides of
 !
AkAkC1 , which contradicts the deﬁnition of a convex polygon.
The other possibility is that there is a point X 2
 !
BC \AkAkC1. The argument in the
preceding paragraph shows that X cannot lie on BC, so either B  C  X or X  B  C;
without loss of generality, assume it is the former. In this case, B and X are two points
of P lying on opposite sides of the line
 !
Aj Aj C1 (which contains C), again contradicting
the fact that P is convex. This completes the proof that BC and AkAkC1 are semiparallel,
and thus all pairs of nonadjacent edges are semiparallel.
Now we can verify that P2 is a polygon. We have just seen that nonadjacent edges are
semiparallel, so they are disjoint. Adjacent edges intersect at their endpoints by deﬁnition
of P2. To complete the proof, we need only show that no two adjacent edges are collinear,
which also implies that they intersect only at their endpoints. Of course, if neither of the
edges is BC, then this follows from the fact that P is a polygon. On the other hand, BC
cannot be collinear with BAiC1, because then C would be a point of P on
 !
AiAiC1 but not
on AiAiC1, contradicting the edge-line lemma. Similarly, BC cannot be collinear with

not on that edge by deﬁnition of convex polygons. If Q 2 IntP , then by part (a), Q lies
in every open half-plane determined by an edge and the vertices not on that edge, and
therefore it also lies in every such closed half-plane.
Conversely, suppose Q lies in every closed half-plane determined by an edge of P
and the vertices not on that edge. If Q actually lies in each of the corresponding open
half-planes, then it is in IntP  RegP by part (a). On the other hand, if Q lies on the line
determined by one of the edges, then the edge-line lemma shows that it actually lies on the
edge, so Q 2 P  RegP .
□
The next lemma expresses the intuitively obvious fact that if a line segment starts in
the interior of a convex polygon and ends in its exterior, then it must cross the polygon
somewhere.
Lemma 8.11. Suppose P is a convex polygon, A is a point in IntP , and B is a point in
ExtP . Then AB intersects P .
Proof. By Lemma 8.10(a), the fact that A 2 IntP means that A is on the P -side of each
edge line, while the fact that B … IntP means that there is at least one edge line such that B
is not on the P -side of that edge line. This means that AB meets at least one edge line, and
it might meet more than one (see Fig. 8.16). Since there are only ﬁnitely many edge lines,
there can be only ﬁnitely many such intersections on AB; let X be the intersection point
on AB closest to A. Let V and W be the vertices such that X 2
 !
V W . We will complete
the proof by showing that X is actually on the edge V W , which is part of P .

Fig. 8.16. Proof of Lemma 8.11.
Let m denote the line containing the edge adjacent to V W at V . If X also lies on m,
then X must be equal to V (because adjacent edge lines intersect only at their common
vertex). In that case X 2 P and we are done. On the other hand, if X does not lie on m,
then the stipulation that X is the intersection point closest to A ensures that AX does not
meet m, which means that A and X are on the same side of m. Since A is on the P -side
of m, so is X. By Theorem 3.46, the portion of
 !
V W on the P -side of m is exactly the
ray
!
V W , so we have shown that X 2
!
V W . The same argument with W and V reversed
shows that X 2

The next theorem explains, at least in part, the relationship between our two notions
of convexity.

Q
Fig. 8.20. A polygonal path from P to Q.
Proof. We will give a full (R-rated) proof of (a), but we’ll just sketch the main ideas in the
proofs of the other two statements.
Let P be a polygon, and let Q be a point not on P . Clearly Q cannot be both an
interior point and an exterior point of P , because it is not possible for a ray to have both
even and odd parity. In order to show that Q is either an interior point or an exterior point,
we have to show that all rays starting at Q and missing the vertices have the same parity.
Thus suppose
!
QC and
!
QD are any two distinct rays starting at Q and not containing
any vertices of P . Assume for the time being that
!
QC and
!
QD are not opposite rays (see
Fig. 8.21). Notice that because Q … P , the number of points in †CQD \ P is equal to
the number of points in
!
QC \P plus the number of points in
!
QD \P ; thus it sufﬁces to
show that †CQD must intersect P an even number of times.
Q

D
P
Fig. 8.21. Counting intersections between a polygon and an angle.
One case is easy to dispense with: if all of the vertices of P are in the interior of
†CQD, then all of the edges are in the interior as well because the interior of a proper
angle is a convex set; thus in this case the number of intersections is zero. Since zero is
even, the lemma is proved in this case. Henceforth, we assume that at least one vertex of
P is in the exterior of †CQD.
The crux of the argument is Lemma 8.14 below, which says roughly that the number
of intersections of a segment with a proper angle is one when one endpoint of the segment
is in the interior of the angle and the other is in the exterior; and otherwise it is zero or two.
We will give a precise statement of the lemma and prove it after the end of this proof.
To see why this does the trick, we argue as follows: if we start at a vertex of P that
is exterior to the angle and count up the number of intersection points edge by edge, then
the running total number of intersections remains even as long as we stay in the exterior of
the angle; it changes from even to odd or odd to even only when we add an odd number,
which occurs exactly when one endpoint of the edge is in the interior of the angle and the

Nonconvex Polygons
169
other is in the exterior. Thus we will have counted an even number of total intersections
whenever we are at an exterior vertex and an odd number whenever we are at an interior
vertex. When we come back to the original exterior vertex, therefore, the total number of
intersections must be even. This proves that
!
QC and
!
QD have the same parity when they
are not opposite rays.
If
!
QC and
!
QD are opposite rays, we can choose a third ray
!
QE that is noncollinear
with them and does not contain any vertices of P . The argument above shows that both
!
QC and
!
QD have the same parity as
!
QE , and thus they have the same parity as each
other. This completes the proof of (a).
The X-rated proofs of the other two conclusions, when written out in full detail, are
somewhat more complicated than what we have already done, but the underlying ideas are
not too hard to explain. To prove (b), the ﬁrst step is to show that if AB is a segment
that does not intersect P , then A and B have the same parity. This is easy if one of the
rays
!
AB or
!
BA does not contain any vertices of P . To handle the general case, one can
show that there is some number  2 .0;180/ such that the rays starting at points of AB,
lying on one side of
 !
AB , and making an angle of ı with one of the rays in
 !
AB all miss
the vertices of P and all have the same number of intersections with P (see Fig. 8.22(a)).
Once this is veriﬁed, it follows by induction that if two points A and B are connected by
a polygonal path that does not intersect P , then they are either both interior points or both
exterior points. The contrapositive of this statement is (b).

(b)

To prove (c), one shows that there is a polygonal path that starts by going from A
to a point very close to the nearest edge, then follows along parallel to the edges until it
gets to the edge nearest to B, then goes straight to B (see Fig. 8.22(b)). The tricky part is
showing that by placing the segments close enough to the edges, it is possible to choose
them in such a way that they do not intersect P . Once this is veriﬁed, it then follows from
the argument in the preceding paragraph that the entire polygonal path from A to B lies in
either IntP or ExtP .
□
To complete the proof of part (a) of the preceding theorem, we need the following
lemma. Its proof is rated R.
Lemma 8.14. If †CQD is a proper angle and AB is a segment such that A and B are
not on †CQD and Q is not on AB, then the number of intersections of AB with †CQD
is exactly one when one endpoint of AB is in the interior of the angle and the other is in
the exterior; and otherwise it is zero or two.

170
8. Polygons
Proof. First, we will show that the number of intersection points of AB with †CQD is
always zero, one, or two. If there were three or more intersection points, then at least two
of them would have to lie on one of the lines
 !
QC or
 !
QD ; but if that were the case, then
the entire segment AB would be contained in that line. Since we are assuming that neither
A nor B lies on †CQD, the only way this can happen is if AB is contained in the ray
opposite
!
QC or the ray opposite
!
QD ; but this would imply that AB contains no points
on †CQD, contradicting the assumption that there are at least three. It follows that there
cannot be more than two intersection points.
Thus to prove the lemma, it sufﬁces to show that AB intersects †CQD exactly once
if and only if one of the endpoints of AB is in the interior of †CQD and the other is in the
exterior.
Assume ﬁrst that one endpoint of AB is in the interior of the angle and the other is in
the exterior. Without loss of generality, say A is in the interior. Then AB must intersect at
least one of the lines
 !
QC ,
 !
QD (because otherwise B would also be in the interior of the
angle), and it might intersect both. Let X be the point of intersection on AB closest to A,
and for deﬁniteness say that X 2
 !
QC (see Fig. 8.23). Because AX does not meet
 !
QD ,
C
D

Q
B

it follows that X is on the same side of
 !
QD as A, which in turn is the same side as C, so
X lies in
!
QC (and not its opposite ray). Thus there is at least one intersection between
AB and †CQD. We need to show that X is the only such point. On the one hand, in AX,
there are no intersection points with the angle other than X itself, because we chose X to
be the closest one. On the other hand, the X-lemma implies that all points of XB other
than X are on the opposite side of
 !
QC from A, and thus also on the opposite side from
!
QD ; thus XB cannot contain a second intersection point either. This proves that there is
exactly one intersection point.
Conversely, assume that AB intersects †CQD exactly once, and call the intersection
point X. Again without loss of generality, we may as well assume that X lies on
!
QC . One
of the two points A or B, therefore, is on the same side of
 !
QC as D; renaming the points
if necessary, we can assume that
A is on the same side of
 !
QC as D.
(8.1)
Thus we are again in the situation illustrated in Fig. 8.23. Now, the Y-lemma guarantees
that the entire segment XA (except X) lies on the same side of
 !
QC as A, and hence on the
same side as D; thus if AX met
 !
QD , the intersection point would have to be a point of
!
QD , not its opposite ray. Since are assuming that AB meets †CQD only once, there can
be no such intersection. It follows that
A is on the same side of
 !
QD as C.
(8.2)


172
8. Polygons
To prove the converse, we will actually prove its contrapositive: if it is not true that Q
lies in the interior of each angle, then Q does not have odd parity. Assume therefore that
for at least one of the angles †ABC of P , Q does not lie in its interior; thus either Q lies
on the angle or it lies in its exterior.
CASE 1: Q lies on †ABC. Without loss of generality, let us say Q 2
!
BC (Fig.
8.24(b)). Then Q cannot lie in BC because we are assuming Q … P . The edge-line
lemma shows that the ray opposite
!
QB does not intersect P at all. That ray therefore has
even parity, so Q has even parity.
CASE 2: Q is in the exterior of †ABC. Then Q is on the opposite side of
 !
AB from
C or on the opposite side of
 !
BC from A; without loss of generality, let us say it is the
former. Then any ray starting at Q and parallel to
 !
AB remains on the same side of
 !
AB
as Q, and thus does not intersect P (Fig. 8.24(c)), and once again we conclude that Q has
even parity.
□
Because of the previous theorem, for convex polygons we can use whichever deﬁnition
of interior and exterior is more convenient for the problem at hand. For polygons that are
not already known to be convex, however, we have no choice but to use the deﬁnition in
terms of parity.
Using the preceding theorem, we can prove a more accurate statement about intersec-
tions of rays with a convex polygon.
Corollary 8.16. Suppose P is a convex polygon and Q 2 IntP . Then every ray starting
at Q intersects P exactly once.
Proof. Let
!r be a ray starting at Q. If
!r passes through a vertex of P , then it meets P at
that vertex; while if it misses all the vertices, then it must have odd parity, so it must have
at least one intersection point with P . In either case,
!r intersects P at least once.
Now we must show that
!r cannot meet P more than once. Assume for the sake of
contradiction that there are at least two points of intersection; call them R and S. Af-
ter renaming the points if necessary, we may assume that QR < QS, which implies that
Q  R  S by the ordering lemma for points. Because R 2 P , there is some edge line `
containing R. The fact that Q 2 IntP implies that Q is on the P -side of ` by Lemma
8.10. This means in particular that Q does not lie on `, so ` and
 !
QS are distinct. By the
X-lemma, Q and S lie on opposite sides of `. But this is a contradiction, because the fact
that P is convex implies that every point of P lies either on ` or on the P -side of `.
□
Convex and Concave Vertices
Suppose P is a polygon, V is a vertex of P , and
!r is a ray starting at V and not
containing any other vertices of P . Then
!r is said to be inward-pointing if Int
!r intersects
P an odd number of times, and it is said to be outward-pointing if Int
!r intersects P an
even number of times. The idea is that along an inward-pointing ray, the points between
V and the next intersection with P are all interior points of P . We say that V is a convex
vertex if every inward-pointing ray starting at V lies in the interior of †V ; and V is a
concave vertex if every such ray lies in the exterior of †V .
Lemma 8.17. If P is a convex polygon, then every vertex of P is a convex vertex.

These textbooks typically do not give precise deﬁnitions of the “interior” or the “interior
angle measure” of a general polygon. After having seen how intricate some of the proofs
are in the last part of this chapter, you can probably appreciate why not. High-school
students generally do not have any trouble accepting notions such as interior points and
interior angle measures without proving that they are well deﬁned.

us say that Q is a strong passing point of S if there exist points X;Y 2 S such that

of S but not a strong passing point. (Although it is not needed for this proof, you
can check that every strong passing point of S is also a passing point, while every
extreme point of S is also a weak extreme point.) Prove the theorem by showing that
if P D A1 :::An is a polygon, then a point of P is a weak extreme point if and only
if it is one of the vertices A1;:::;An. The hard part is showing that a vertex is a weak
extreme point. To prove this, let Ai be a vertex, and assume for contradiction that it
is a strong passing point. Let r be a positive number less than the distance from Ai
to any edge that does not contain Ai (Theorem 7.14), and show that there exist points

Quadrilaterals
After triangles, the next most important ﬁgures in geometry are quadrilaterals. In this chap-
ter, we explore some properties of quadrilaterals that can be proved in neutral geometry.
Convex Quadrilaterals
Recall that a quadrilateral is a polygon with four sides. In addition to all of the standard
terminology that we use for general polygons, there are some terms that are speciﬁc to
quadrilaterals: two sides of a quadrilateral that are not adjacent are called opposite sides,
and two vertices or angles that are not consecutive are called opposite vertices or opposite
angles. For example, if ABCD is a quadrilateral, then A and C are opposite vertices, as
are B and D; and AB and CD are opposite sides, as are BC and DA. There are only
two diagonals: AC and BD. Note that no three vertices of a quadrilateral can be collinear,
because any three vertices are the endpoints of a pair of adjacent sides (namely, the ones
that do not contain the missing vertex).
Here are some special types of quadrilaterals. A quadrilateral is called a
 trapezoid if it has at least one pair of parallel sides;
 parallelogram if it has two different pairs of parallel sides;
 rhombus if all four of its sides are congruent;
 rectangle if it has four right angles;
 square if all four sides are congruent and all four angles are right angles.
Theorem 9.1. Every rectangle is a parallelogram.
Proof. If ABCD is a rectangle, then
 !
AB and

CD are parallel by the common perpendic-
ular theorem, as are

(a) If the diagonals of a quadrilateral intersect, then the quadrilateral is convex.

Theorem 8.7 showed that a polygon is convex if and only if each pair of nonadjacent
sides is semiparallel. For quadrilaterals, it turns out that only one pair of sides needs to be
checked.
Theorem 9.5. If a quadrilateral has at least one pair of semiparallel sides, it is convex.

Convex Quadrilaterals
177
Proof. We prove the contrapositive: assuming that ABCD is a nonconvex quadrilateral,
we prove that it does not have a pair of semiparallel sides. Thus assume ABCD is non-
convex. By Theorem 8.7, this implies that there is at least one pair of opposite edges that
are not semiparallel. Without loss of generality, we can assume that AD and BC are not
semiparallel (Fig. 9.3). We need to show that AB and CD are not semiparallel either.

Fig. 9.3. A nonconvex quadrilateral does not have semiparallel sides.
The fact that AD and BC are not semiparallel implies that one of these two segments
must intersect the line containing the other. Again without loss of generality, let us say that
AD intersects
 !
BC at a point E. Now, E cannot be a vertex, because then ABCD would
have three collinear vertices; so E must be an interior point of AD. Since B, C, and E are
distinct collinear points and E … BC, one of the relations E  B  C or B  C  E must
hold. Assume it is the former; the argument for the latter case is nearly identical.
The assumption E B C implies that E and C are on opposite sides of
 !
AB . On the
other hand, the Y-lemma applied to the ray
!
AD implies that E and D are on the same side

implies that AB and CD are not semiparallel either.

Often, before we can apply the preceding results, it is necessary to verify that we ac-
tually have a quadrilateral to begin with. Since the general deﬁnition of a polygon includes
several conditions that would have to be veriﬁed, this could be tedious. Fortunately, for
convex quadrilaterals we have the following shortcuts. The ﬁrst one says roughly that if
you connect the four corners of a cross, you automatically get a convex quadrilateral.
Lemma 9.9 (Cross Lemma). Suppose AC and BD are noncollinear segments that have
an interior point in common. Then ABCD is a convex quadrilateral.

Fig. 9.4. The cross lemma.
Proof. Let E be a point that lies in both IntAC and IntBD, which means AE C and
B  E  D (Fig. 9.4). Since AC and BD are noncollinear, the lines
 !
AC and
 !
BD are
distinct, so they intersect only at E. In particular, this implies that A, B, C, and D are
distinct points.
The main point is to show that the set ABCD D AB [BC [CD [DA is a polygon.
By construction, it is the union of four segments determined by four distinct points, so we
need only show that consecutive edges are noncollinear and distinct edges intersect only at
common endpoints.
To prove that consecutive edges are noncollinear, note that if, say, AB and BC were
collinear, then the lines
 !
AC and
 !
BD would intersect at two distinct points (E and B),
contradicting the observation in the ﬁrst paragraph. The same argument shows that no
other three points are collinear either.
To prove that distinct edges intersect only at common endpoints, note ﬁrst that adjacent
edges intersect only at their endpoints because no three vertices are collinear. It remains
only to show that nonadjacent edges do not intersect. Consider the edges AB and CD.
The fact that A  E  C implies that A and C lie on opposite sides of
 !
BD, and then the
Y-lemma implies that all interior points of
!
BA are on the opposite side of
 !
BD from all
interior points of
!
DC . That leaves only B and D as possible intersection points; but since
B ¤ D, we conclude that AB and CD are disjoint. The same argument shows that BC
and DA are disjoint. Thus ABCD is a quadrilateral, and it is convex because its diagonals
intersect.
□
Lemma 9.10 (Trapezoid Lemma). Suppose A, B, C, and D are four distinct points such
that AB k CD and AD \BC D ¿. Then ABCD is a trapezoid.
Proof. Once again, the main point is to prove that ABCD is a polygon. If any three ver-
tices were collinear, then the lines
 !
AB and
 !
CD would intersect, contradicting the hypoth-
esis that they are parallel. To prove that distinct edges intersect only at common endpoints,
note as before that adjacent edges intersect only at their endpoints because no three vertices
are collinear; and the hypotheses imply that opposite edges do not intersect at all. Thus
ABCD is a quadrilateral, and because it has a pair of parallel sides it is a trapezoid.
□
The next lemma is really just a special case of the trapezoid lemma, but it is so fre-
quently useful that it is worth stating as a separate lemma.
Lemma 9.11 (Parallelogram Lemma). Suppose A, B, C, and D are four distinct points
such that AB k CD and AD k BC. Then ABCD is a parallelogram.

Proof. Given such points A, B, C, and D, the trapezoid lemma implies that ABCD is a
trapezoid, and then the hypothesis implies that it is in fact a parallelogram.

The next three theorems are generalizations of familiar results about triangles.
Theorem 9.12 (SASAS Congruence). Suppose ABCD and EFGH are convex quadri-
laterals such that AB Š EF , BC Š FG, CD Š GH, †B Š †F , and †C Š †G (Fig.

shows that m†ABD D m†ABC m†DBC D m†EFG m†HFG D m†EFH. Now
4ABD and 4EFH are congruent by SAS, so it follows that AD Š EH and †A Š †E.
The two triangle congruences imply †ADB Š †EHF and †BDC Š †FHG; and then
Lemma 9.3 implies †ADC Š †EHG. Since all eight pairs of corresponding parts are
congruent, we conclude that ABCD Š EFGH.

9. Quadrilaterals
Proof. First, using the triangle copying theorem (Theorem 5.10), let G be the point on the
chosen side of
 !
EF such that 4EFG Š 4ABC (see Fig. 9.6(b)). Then let H be the point
on the same side of
 !
EF such that 4EFH Š 4ABD (Fig. 9.6(c)).
We wish to use SASAS to prove that EFGH Š ABCD; but before we do so, we
need to verify that EFGH is a convex quadrilateral. For this purpose, we will use the
cross lemma. The angle criterion for convexity guarantees that C is in the interior of
†BAD, so m†BAD > m†BAC (the whole angle is greater than the part). Because
†FEH Š †BAD and †FEG Š †BAC, substitution implies m†FEH > m†FEG. It
follows, ﬁrst of all, that G and H are distinct points, since otherwise †FEH would be
equal to †FEG; and since neither G nor H lies on
 !
EF , all four of the points E;F;G;H
are distinct. Moreover, the ordering lemma for rays implies that
!
EF 
!
EG 
!
EH . Thus
!
EG must intersect IntFH by the crossbar theorem. The same argument shows that
!
FH
meets IntEG. Since these two lines can intersect only at one point, that point must lie in
both IntFH and IntEG. Thus EFGH is a convex quadrilateral by the cross lemma.
We have AB Š EF by hypothesis, and the congruences 4EFG Š 4ABC and
4EFH Š 4ABD imply FG Š BC, †EFG Š †ABC, EH Š AD, and †FEH Š
†BAD. Therefore, EFGH is congruent to ABCD by SASAS.
□
Parallelograms
When we think of parallelograms, we typically think of them not only as ﬁgures whose
opposite sides are parallel, but also as ﬁgures whose opposite sides are congruent and
whose opposite angles are congruent. We cannot yet prove that every parallelogram has
these properties; in fact, just like many familiar properties of parallel lines, they cannot be
proved in neutral geometry. However we can prove that having either congruent opposite
angles or congruent opposite sides is a sufﬁcient condition for a convex quadrilateral to be
a parallelogram. (In fact, if we assume congruent opposite sides, we do not even need to
assume convexity, as Theorem 9.17 below demonstrates.)
The next proof is rated PG.
Theorem 9.15. A convex quadrilateral with two pairs of congruent opposite angles is a
parallelogram.
Proof. Suppose ABCD is a convex quadrilateral with †A Š †C and †B Š †D (see Fig.
9.7). We need to show that
 !
AB k

CD and
 !
AD k

BC . The proofs of both statements are
the same, so we only prove the ﬁrst one.

Assume for the sake of contradiction that

AB and

CD are not parallel. Then they
meet at a point X (see Fig. 9.7). Because AB and CD are semiparallel, X does not lie

Parallelograms

on AB or CD. Thus it must be the case that either A  B  X or X  A  B. Without
loss of generality, we may assume the former. This means that X is on the opposite side
of
 !
BC from A. Since A and D are on the same side of
 !
BC (because AD and BC are
semiparallel), it follows that D and X are also on opposite sides of
 !
BC , so D  C  X.
Therefore, the angles marked †1 and †2 in Fig. 9.7 form a linear pair, as do †3 and †4.
From the linear pair theorem and the hypothesis, we have
m†2Cm†D D m†2Cm†1 D 180ı;
m†4Cm†A D m†4Cm†3 D 180ı:
(9.1)
Adding these two equations yields m†2Cm†4Cm†D Cm†A D 360ı.
On the other hand, Corollary 5.14 applied to 4XBC and 4XAD shows that
m†2Cm†4 < 180ı;
m†ACm†D < 180ı:
(9.2)
Adding these two inequalities yields m†2Cm†4Cm†D Cm†A < 360ı, which contra-
dicts the equation we derived above.

Corollary 9.16. Every equiangular quadrilateral is a parallelogram.
Proof. An equiangular quadrilateral is convex by deﬁnition, so it satisﬁes the hypotheses
of the preceding theorem.

Draw diagonal AC, and label the angles †1 D †BAC, †2 D †ACB, †3 D †DCA,
and †4 D †CAD as in the diagram. It follows from SSS that 4ABC Š 4CDA, and
therefore †1 Š †3 and †2 Š †4. The diagram suggests that B and D are on opposite
sides of
 !
AC . Provided this is true, †1 and †3 are congruent alternate interior angles for
the transversal

and †4 are congruent implies that

It remains to show that B and D are indeed on opposite sides of
 !
AC . This is one
instance in which a fact that appears to be obvious from the diagram is actually quite tricky
to prove. (If we knew in advance that ABCD was a convex quadrilateral, then this would
follow immediately from Lemma 9.2; but until we prove that it is a parallelogram, we have
no easy way to prove that it is convex.)

9. Quadrilaterals
Assume for the sake of contradiction that B and D are not on opposite sides of
 !

Since no three vertices of a quadrilateral are collinear, neither B nor D can be on

they must both be on the same side of the line. There are two cases to consider (Fig. 9.9):

CASE 1: AB D BC. In this case, the hypothesis implies CD D AB D BC D AD,
and thus 4ACB Š 4ACD by SSS. Then the unique triangle theorem guarantees that
B D D. This contradicts the fact that the vertices of a polygon are all distinct.
CASE 2: AB ¤ BC. Then one of them is larger; without loss of generality, say AB >
BC. By the scalene inequality, this implies that m†2 > m†1. Using the congruences we
proved above, we also have m†2 > m†3 and m†4 > m†1. The ordering lemma for rays
implies that

AB must intersect CD and also that

CD must intersect AB. Since these two lines can only
have one point in common (otherwise A;B;C;D would all be collinear), the intersection
point must lie on both AB and CD. But again, this contradicts the fact that ABCD is a
polygon and completes the proof.

Using these results, we can prove some interesting criteria for identifying special types

(a) If its diagonals bisect each other, then ABCD is a parallelogram.
(b) If its diagonals are congruent and bisect each other, then ABCD is equiangular.

Exercises

In Euclidean geometry, as we will see, an equiangular quadrilateral is just a rectangle,
and a regular quadrilateral is a square. But Theorem 9.19 and its corollary did not mention
rectangles and squares for a good reason: since we will not be able to prove an angle-
sum theorem until we introduce the Euclidean parallel postulate, we do not know that
equiangular quadrilaterals have 90ı angles. (In fact, in hyperbolic geometry, they do not!)

Chapter 10
The Euclidean Parallel
Postulate
From this point on in our study of Euclidean geometry, we ofﬁcially add the Euclidean
parallel postulate to our list of axioms. Thus, in addition to the nine axioms of neutral
geometry, we assume the following new axiom.
Postulate 10E (The Euclidean Parallel Postulate). For each line ` and each
point A that does not lie on `, there is a unique line that contains A and is parallel
to `.
The term Euclidean geometry refers to the axiomatic system consisting of the primi-
tive terms and axioms of neutral geometry together with the Euclidean parallel postulate.
(We call this the “Euclidean parallel postulate” because it enables one to prove all of the
theorems that Euclid proved. But, as we know, this is not one of the postulates that Eu-
clid assumed. We will explain the relationship between this postulate and Euclid’s ﬁfth
postulate later in this chapter and in Chapter 17.)
As we saw in Chapter 7, the axioms of neutral geometry are already sufﬁcient to prove
that for every line ` and every point A … `, there exists at least one line through A and
parallel to `. Thus the real content of the Euclidean parallel postulate is the statement
that there is only one such line. We will see that many familiar properties of Euclidean
geometry follow from this postulate.
The ﬁrst such property is a converse to the alternate interior angles theorem. It is
part of Euclid’s Proposition I.29, the ﬁrst proposition in which he makes use of his ﬁfth
postulate. Our proof is a little different from his because we are using Postulate 10E in
place of Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate.
Theorem 10.1 (Converse to the Alternate Interior Angles Theorem). If two parallel
lines are cut by a transversal, then both pairs of alternate interior angles are congruent.

10. The Euclidean Parallel Postulate
Proof. Suppose ` and `0 are parallel lines cut by a transversal t, and let A and A0 denote
the points where t meets ` and `0, respectively. Choose either pair of alternate interior
angles, and choose points C 2 ` and D 2 `0 such that the chosen angles are †CAA0 and
†AA0D (Fig. 10.1).

By the angle construction theorem, there is a ray

A0E on the same side of t as D
that makes an angle with
!
A0A that is congruent to †CAA0. It follows from the alternate
interior angles theorem that
 !
A0E is parallel to `. By the Euclidean parallel postulate,
therefore,
 !
A0E is in fact equal to `0. Since D and E are on the same side of t, this means
that
!
A0E and
!
A0D are the same ray, and therefore †AA0D D †AA0E. Since †AA0E is
congruent to †CAA0 by construction, we conclude that †AA0D Š †CAA0.
□
The next two corollaries follow easily from the preceding theorem; they are the second
and third parts of Euclid’s Proposition I.29.
Corollary 10.2 (Converse to the Corresponding Angles Theorem). If two parallel lines
are cut by a transversal, then all four pairs of corresponding angles are congruent.
Proof. Exercise 10A.
□
Corollary 10.3 (Converse to the Consecutive Interior Angles Theorem). If two parallel
lines are cut by a transversal, then both pairs of consecutive interior angles are supple-
mentary.
Proof. Exercise 10B.
□
Many additional properties of parallel lines are based on the following innocent-
looking lemma. It is named after the Greek mathematician Proclus, who ﬁrst stated it
in his ﬁfth-century commentary on Euclid’s Elements [Pro70, p. 371]. (Proclus thought
he had given a proof of this lemma that did not rely on Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate; but as
we remarked in Chapter 1, his proof assumed without justiﬁcation that parallel lines are
equidistant.)
Lemma 10.4 (Proclus’s Lemma). Suppose ` and `0 are parallel lines. If t is a line that is
distinct from ` but intersects `, then t also intersects `0.
Proof. Suppose t is a line that is distinct from ` and intersects ` at A (Fig. 10.2). If t
does not intersect `0, then t and ` are two distinct lines parallel to `0 through A, which
contradicts the Euclidean parallel postulate.

m and `. Since all of the angles made by m and ` are right angles, so are the angles made
by m and `0, and thus m ? `0.

Corollary 10.6. Suppose ` and `0 are parallel lines and m and m0 are distinct lines such
that m ? ` and m0 ? `0. Then m k m0.

pendicular to `0, and therefore m and m0 are parallel because they have `0 as a common
perpendicular.

AG (Fig. 10.5). Theorem 10.5 shows that

ABGF is a rectangle and thus convex. Therefore, B and F are on opposite sides of

by Lemma 9.2, which implies that †FGA and †BAG are alternate interior angles for the
transversal
 !
AG . It follows from the converse to the alternate interior angles theorem that
†FGA Š †BAG, and so 4FGA Š 4BAG by AAS. This implies AF D BG, which
means that A and B are equidistant from m. Since A and B were arbitrary points on `,
this shows that ` is equidistant from m, and the same argument shows that m is equidistant
from `.
□
Corollary 10.9 (Symmetry of Equidistant Lines). If ` and m are two distinct lines, then
` is equidistant from m if and only if m is equidistant from `.
Proof. By the equidistance theorem and its converse, both statements are equivalent to
` k m.
□
As we mentioned in Chapter 7, the alternate interior angles theorem and its corollaries,
all of which are valid in neutral geometry, are merely sufﬁcient criteria for parallelism; they
do not assert any necessary properties of parallelism. The converses that we just proved,
on the other hand, are properties of lines that are known to be parallel and have been
proved only in Euclidean geometry because their proofs depend on the Euclidean parallel
postulate.
We end this section with one ﬁnal consequence of the Euclidean parallel postulate.
This is Euclid’s Proposition I.30.
Theorem 10.10 (Transitivity of Parallelism). If `, m, and n are distinct lines such that
` k m and m k n, then ` k n.
Proof. Exercise 10D.
□
Theorem 10.10 seems so “obvious” that you might be tempted to think it should fol-
low immediately from the deﬁnition of parallel lines together with the axioms of neutral
geometry. But if the Euclidean parallel postulate were false, then for some line m and
some point A … m, there would be two different lines parallel to m and passing through A
and therefore not parallel to each other (Fig. 10.6). Thus this theorem cannot be proved
without the Euclidean parallel postulate (or something equivalent to it).

Angle-Sum Theorems

Angle-Sum Theorems
The next theorem is one of the most important facts in Euclidean geometry. To state it
concisely, we introduce the following terminology. If P is a convex polygon, its angle
sum, denoted by .P /, is the sum of the measures of its angles. (Later, we will deﬁne
the angle sum for a more general polygon as the sum of its interior angle measures.) For
example, for a triangle 4ABC, the angle sum is just
.4ABC/ D m†ACm†B Cm†C:
The following theorem is the second half of Euclid’s Proposition I.32; our proof is a slight
modiﬁcation of his.
Theorem 10.11 (Angle-Sum Theorem for Triangles). Every triangle has angle sum
equal to 180ı.
A
B
C
D

Fig. 10.7. Proof of the angle-sum theorem for triangles.
Proof. The diagram in Fig. 10.7 makes the proof seem nearly obvious; the only work that
has to be done is to justify what the diagram seems to be telling us. Let 4ABC be a
triangle. By Theorem 7.25, there is a line m through A and parallel to
 !
BC . We can choose
points D;E on m such that D is on the same side of
 !
AC as B, and E is on the same side
of
 !
AB as C. Since
 !
BC and m are parallel, Lemma 7.18 shows that B and C are on the
same side of m. Combining these relations and using the interior lemma, we conclude that

AD 
!
AB 
!
AC and
!
AB 
!
AC 
!
AE . Thus the linear triple theorem shows that
m†DAB Cm†BAC Cm†CAE D 180ı:
(10.1)
On the other hand, it follows from Theorem 4.12 that D and C are on opposite sides
of
 !
AB . Therefore, †DAB and †ABC form a pair of alternate interior angles for the
transversal
 !
AB . Similarly, †CAE and †ACB form a pair of alternate interior angles for
the transversal
 !
AC . It follows from the converse to the alternate interior angles theorem
that m†DAB D m†ABC and m†CAE D m†ACB. Substituting these relations into
(10.1) completes the proof.
□
The next corollary is the other half of Euclid’s Proposition I.32.
Corollary 10.12. In any triangle, the measure of each exterior angle is equal to the sum
of the measures of the two remote interior angles.
Proof. This is an immediate consequence of the angle-sum theorem and the linear pair
theorem.

equal to 60ı if and only if it is equilateral.

Theorem 10.14 (30-60-90 Theorem). A triangle has interior angle measures 30ı, 60ı,

Theorem 10.15 (45-45-90 Theorem). A triangle has interior angle measures 45ı, 45ı,

Proof. Exercise 10G.
□
Another important application of the angle-sum theorem is to prove that Euclid’s ﬁfth
postulate follows from the Euclidean parallel postulate together with the theorems of neu-
tral geometry.
Theorem 10.16 (Euclid’s Fifth Postulate). If ` and `0 are two lines cut by a transversal
t in such a way that the measures of two consecutive interior angles add up to less than
180ı, then ` and `0 intersect on the same side of t as those two angles.
Proof. Suppose `, `0, and t satisfy the hypotheses. First note that ` and `0 are not parallel,
because if they were, the converse to the consecutive interior angles theorem would imply
that the two consecutive interior angles would have measures adding up to exactly 180ı.
Thus there is a point C where ` and `0 intersect. It remains only to show that C is on the
same side of t as the two interior angles whose measures add up to less than 180ı.

chosen so that †1 and †3 are the two interior angles whose measures add up to less than
180ı. Assume for the sake of contradiction that C is on the opposite side of t from these
two angles (Fig. 10.8). Because †1 and †2 form a linear pair, as do †3 and †4,
m†2 D 180ı m†1;
m†4 D 180ı m†3:
Adding these two equations and using the fact that m†1Cm†3 < 180ı yield
m†2Cm†4 D 360ı .m†1Cm†3/ > 180ı:
Because †2 and †4 are two angles of 4AA0C, this contradicts Corollary 5.14.

Angle-Sum Theorems
191
In fact, as we will show in Chapter 17, the converse is also true: if we assume Euclid’s
Postulate 5 in addition to the postulates of neutral geometry, the Euclidean parallel pos-
tulate follows as a theorem. Thus, in the presence of the axioms of neutral geometry, the
Euclidean parallel postulate and Euclid’s Postulate 5 are equivalent, which means that if
either one of them is added to the postulates of neutral geometry as an additional postulate,
then the other one can be proved as a theorem. When we are ready to begin our study
of non-Euclidean geometry, we will see that there are many other statements that are also
equivalent to the Euclidean parallel postulate.
Theorem 10.17 (AAA Construction Theorem). Suppose AB is a segment and ˛, ˇ, and
 are three positive real numbers whose sum is 180. On each side of

C such that 4ABC has the following angle measures: m†A D ˛ı, m†B D ˇı, and
m†C D ı.

Now we can prove Euclid’s Proposition I.1. (This result is also true in neutral ge-
ometry, but it is somewhat harder to prove in that context. Since we will only need it
in Euclidean geometry, we prove it only in that case. For a proof that works in neutral
geometry, see [Mar96, Theorem 20.15].)
Corollary 10.18 (Equilateral Triangle Construction Theorem). If AB is any segment,
then on each side of
 !
AB there is a point C such that 4ABC is equilateral.
Proof. Apply the AAA construction theorem with ˛ D ˇ D  D 60ı. The resulting triangle
is equilateral by Corollary 5.9.

Angle-Sum Theorems for Polygons
The angle-sum theorem for triangles extends easily to convex polygons with any num-
ber of vertices. This proof is rated PG because of its use of mathematical induction, which
might still be a little unfamiliar to some readers.
Theorem 10.19 (Angle-Sum Theorem for Convex Polygons). In a convex polygon with
n sides, the angle sum is equal to .n2/	180ı.
Proof. We will prove the theorem by induction on n. The base case is n D 3 (triangles),
which was proved in Theorem 10.11. For the inductive step, let n be an integer greater than

There is also an angle-sum theorem for arbitrary (not necessarily convex) polygons.
Recall from Chapter 8 that the interior angle measure at a vertex of a polygon is deﬁned to
be the standard angle measure at a convex vertex, but the reﬂex angle measure at a concave
one. The proof of this theorem is rated X, so we can only sketch the main ideas.
Theorem 10.22 (Angle-Sum Theorem for General Polygons). If P is any polygon with
n sides, the sum of its interior angle measures is .n2/	180ı.

Fig. 10.12. Proving the angle-sum theorem for general polygons.
Sketch of proof. As in the convex case, the proof is by induction on n, with the base case
taken care of by Theorem 10.11. The idea of the proof of the inductive step is the same
as in the convex case: write P D A1A2A3 :::AnC1 in such a way that the diagonal A1A3
cuts P into a triangle and an n-sided polygon, and apply the inductive hypothesis. There
are two stumbling blocks that make the proof much more difﬁcult than in the convex case.
The ﬁrst is proving that it is always possible to ﬁnd three consecutive vertices A1, A2, A3
such that the interior of the diagonal A1A3 lies in the interior of the polygon. The second is
proving that once such vertices have been found, the interior angle measures of the original

polygon at A1 and A3 are the sums of those of the two smaller polygons. (There are many
cases to check, because some interior angle measures are reﬂex measures, while others are
ordinary measures.)
□
Quadrilaterals in Euclidean Geometry
The preceding results lead to some new properties of quadrilaterals that could not be proved
in neutral geometry.
Theorem 10.23 (Angle-Sum Theorem for Quadrilaterals). Every convex quadrilateral
has an angle sum of 360ı.
Proof. Apply Theorem 10.19 with n D 4.
□
Corollary 10.24. A quadrilateral is equiangular if and only if it is a rectangle, and it is a
regular quadrilateral if and only if it is a square.
Proof. Let ABCD be a quadrilateral. If it is equiangular, then its angle measures are all
360ı=4 D 90ı by Theorem 10.23, so it is a rectangle. Conversely, if it is a rectangle, then
it is convex by Corollary 9.8, and thus equiangular. (Recall that convexity is part of the
deﬁnition of an equiangular polygon.)
Now suppose ABCD is regular, meaning equiangular and equilateral. Then it is a
rectangle by the argument in the preceding paragraph, and because it is also equilateral
it is a square. Conversely, if ABCD is a square, then it is an equilateral rectangle by
deﬁnition, and thus it is also equiangular by the argument in the preceding paragraph.
□
Because the Euclidean parallel postulate allows us to draw many more conclusions
about parallel lines, it also allows us to derive many more properties of parallelograms.
The properties expressed in the next few theorems are probably already familiar. Parts
(a)–(c) of the next theorem are essentially the same as Euclid’s Proposition I.34.
Theorem 10.25. Every parallelogram has the following properties.
(a) Each diagonal cuts it into a pair of congruent triangles.
(b) Both pairs of opposite sides are congruent.
(c) Both pairs of opposite angles are congruent.
(d) Its diagonals bisect each other.
Proof. Exercise 10I.
□
Next, we have some new criteria for a quadrilateral to be a parallelogram or a rectan-
gle. The ﬁrst one is Euclid’s Proposition I.33, with essentially the same proof.
Theorem 10.26. If a quadrilateral has a pair of congruent and parallel opposite sides,
then it is a parallelogram.
Proof. Suppose ABCD is a polygon in which AB and CD are congruent and parallel.
Draw the diagonal AC, and label the angles as shown in Fig. 10.13. Because ABCD is
a trapezoid, it is convex, and therefore B and D lie on opposite sides of
 !
AC by Lemma

perpendicular theorem, so the preceding theorem implies that ABCD is a parallelogram.
Therefore, †A and †B are both right angles by Theorem 10.25(c), so ABCD is a rectan-
gle.

Here is a useful application of Theorem 10.27.

that ABCD is a rectangle with AB D CD D a and AD D BC D b.

The next corollary is Euclid’s Proposition I.46. His proof is very similar to our proof
of Theorem 10.28, but specialized to the case of a square.
Corollary 10.29 (Square Construction). If AB is any segment, then on each side of

there are points C and D such that ABCD is a square.
Proof. Just apply the preceding theorem with a D b D AB.

These properties of parallelograms lead to the following interesting theorem about
triangles. In any triangle, a segment connecting the midpoints of two different sides is
called a midsegment (Fig. 10.16).

vertices if necessary, we may assume that D is the midpoint of AB and E is the midpoint
of AC (Fig. 10.17). Let F be the point on the ray opposite

†AED and †CEF are vertical angles and are thus congruent, so 4AED Š 4CEF by

implies that DF and BC are both parallel and congruent, so DE k BC. Using the fact
that D  E  F , we compute BC D DF D DE C EF D 2DE, which can be solved for

then ˛.4ABC/ means the area of the triangular region consisting of 4ABC together
with its interior.
Admissible Decompositions
In order to derive formulas for areas, we will need to carve certain regions into smaller
regions and use the area addition property. Suppose P is a polygon. An admissible de-
composition of P is a ﬁnite collection fP1;:::;Png of other polygons such that the regions
RegP1, . . . , RegPn are nonoverlapping and RegP D RegP1 [[RegPn. When this is
the case, it follows from the area addition property that ˛.P / D ˛.P1/CC˛.Pn/.
In order to make practical use of the area addition property, we will need to verify that
some common constructions yield admissible decompositions. The following lemma will
be our primary tool for constructing admissible decompositions. Its proof is rated PG.
Lemma 11.1 (Convex Decomposition Lemma). Suppose P is a convex polygon and
BC is a chord of P . Then the two convex polygons P1 and P2 described in the polygon
splitting theorem (Theorem 8.9) form an admissible decomposition of P , and therefore
˛.P / D ˛.P1/C˛.P2/.
Proof. Throughout this proof, we will use the same notation as in the proof of Theorem
8.9, and we will use the results of Lemma 8.10 to characterize the interiors and regions of
the various convex polygons. First we have to show that RegP1 and RegP2 are nonover-
lapping, which means that their interiors are disjoint. Note that P1 and P2 lie in opposite
closed half-planes determined by
 !
BC . (If either vertex of BC, say B, is an interior point
of an edge AiAiC1 of P , this follows from the fact that Ai B AiC1; while if both B and
C are vertices of P , it follows from the angle criterion for convexity and Theorem 4.12.)
Thus it follows from Lemma 8.10 that every point in the interior of P1 lies on one side of
 !
BC while every point in the interior of P2 lies on the other side, so the interiors of the two
polygons are disjoint.
Next, we need to prove that RegP D RegP1 [RegP2. First assume Q is a point in
RegP . If Q 2
 !
BC , then it must lie on BC because it is contained in the closed half-planes
determined by
 !
AiAiC1 and C and by
 !
Aj AjC1 and B. Since BC is contained in both P1
and P2, it follows that Q is contained in RegP1 [RegP2. On the other hand, if Q …
 !
BC ,
then it must lie on one side or the other of this line; without loss of generality, assume it
lies on the P2-side. Then Q also lies in the appropriate closed half-plane determined by
each of the edges of P2 (which are some of the closed half-planes determined by edges of
P ), so it lies in RegP2 and therefore in RegP1 [RegP2.
Conversely, assume Q 2 RegP1 [RegP2 and assume for deﬁniteness that Q lies in
RegP1. If Q is on one of the edges of P1 that also lie on P , then clearly Q 2 P  RegP .
If Q is on BC, then Q lies on both P1 and P2; because these are convex polygons, it
follows that Q lies in the appropriate closed half-plane deﬁned by each of the edges of P1
and by each of the edges of P2, which implies that it lies in all of the appropriate closed
half-planes deﬁned by edges of P . Therefore, it lies in RegP .
Finally, suppose Q 2 IntP1. In this case, we will prove that Q 2 IntP and therefore
is in RegP . For this purpose, it is easiest to use the parity deﬁnition of interior points (see
Theorem 8.15). For any point Y 2 IntBC, the ray opposite

The next proof is also rated PG.
Theorem 11.7 (Area of a Square). The area of a square of side length x is x2.
Proof. The claim is that s.x/ D x2 for every positive real number x. We will prove this in
several steps of increasing generality.
STEP 1: x is a positive integer. In this case, we write x D n and use Lemma 11.6 to
conclude that s.n/ D s.n1/ D n2s.1/ D n2.
STEP 2: x is a positive rational number. Write x D m=n, where m and n are positive
integers. Let P be any square of side length m; we will prove that s.m=n/ D .m=n/2 by
computing the area of the auxiliary square P in two different ways (see Fig. 11.12).

On the other hand, we can think of P as being decomposed into n2 smaller squares of side

Equating (11.2) and (11.3) and solving for s.m=n/, we obtain s.m=n/ D .m=n/2 as de-
sired.
STEP 3: x is any positive real number. By trichotomy, there are three possibilities:
s.x/ < x2, s.x/ > x2, or s.x/ D x2. First suppose s.x/ < x2. Then because s.x/ and x
are both positive, it follows that

s.x/ < x. Thus we can choose some rational number r
such that

s.x/ < r < x and therefore s.x/ < r2 < x2. On the one hand, Step 2 ensures
us that s.r/ D r2, so by substitution we conclude that s.x/ < s.r/. On the other hand, the
fact that r < x guarantees that s.r/ < s.x/ by Lemma 11.4. This is a contradiction, which

Chapter 12
Similarity
The idea of “scaling” geometric objects is ubiquitous in our everyday experience. When
you draw a map or enlarge a photo or instruct your computer to use a different font size,
you are creating a new geometric object that has the “same shape” as the old one but has all
of its parts reduced or enlarged in size proportionally. In geometry, roughly speaking, two
ﬁgures that have the same shape but not necessarily the same size are said to be similar to
each other.
Deﬁnitions
Before we give a more precise deﬁnition of similarity, let us review some standard termi-
nology regarding ratios and proportions, because these terms are frequently confused in
everyday speech. If x and y are positive real numbers, the ratio of x to y is just the quo-
tient x=y. A proportion is an equality between two ratios, such as x1=y1 D x2=y2. Two
ordered pairs of positive numbers .x1;y1/ and .x2;y2/ are said to be proportional if their
ratios are equal: x1=y1 D x2=y2. Simple algebra shows that this equation can be written
in several equivalent ways:
x1
y1
D x2
y2
,
y1
x1
D y2
x2
,
x1
x2
D y1
y2
,
x2
x1
D y2
y1
,
x1y2 D x2y1:
We also say that three or more ordered pairs .x1;y1/;:::;.xn;yn/ are proportional when
their ratios are all equal: x1=y1 D x2=y2 D  D xn=yn.
Here is our ofﬁcial deﬁnition of similarity. If P1 and P2 are polygons, we say they are
similar polygons if there is a correspondence between their vertices such that consecutive
vertices correspond to consecutive vertices, all pairs of corresponding interior angle mea-
sures are equal, and all pairs of corresponding side lengths are proportional. In particular,
congruent polygons are always similar. The notation P1 
 P2 means that P1 is similar to
P2. When we name the polygons by listing their vertices, the order of the vertices indicates
the correspondence, just as in the notation for congruence.
For example, if 4ABC and 4DEF are triangles, the notation 4ABC 
 4DEF
means that 4ABC is similar to 4DEF under the correspondence A $ D, B $ E, and

Suppose P1 
 P2, and let r denote the common ratio of lengths of sides of P1 to
those of P2. Then it follows from the deﬁnition of similarity that each side of P1 has
length equal to r times that of the corresponding side of P2. This common ratio r is called
the scale factor of the similarity, or the constant of proportionality. The next theorem is
essentially Euclid’s Proposition VI.21. Our proof is similar in spirit to his but is translated
into more algebraic language.
Theorem 12.1 (Transitive Property of Similarity). Two polygons that are both similar
to a third polygon are similar to each other.
Proof. Suppose P D A1 :::An, P 0 D A0
1 :::A0
n, and P 00 D A00
1 :::A00
n are polygons such
that A1 :::An 
 A0
1 :::A0
n and A0
1 :::A0
n 
 A00
1 :::A00
n. For each i, the interior angle measure
at Ai is equal to that at A0
i, which in turn is equal to that at A00
i , so it follows from transitivity
of equality that the interior angle measures at Ai and A00
i are equal. The hypothesis implies
that there are positive numbers r and s such that the following equations hold for each i:
AiAiC1 D r A0
iA0
iCi;
A0
iA0
iC1 D s A00
i A00
iCi:
By substitution, therefore, we conclude that
AiAiCi D rs A00
i A00
iC1:
This shows that all pairs of corresponding sides of P and P 00 are proportional, so the two
triangles are similar.
□
The Side-Splitter Theorem
Our ﬁrst main goal is to develop some shortcuts for proving similarity of triangles, anal-
ogous to congruence theorems like SAS and AAS. The main tool for proving that such
shortcuts work will be the following theorem, which shows that a line parallel to one side
of a triangle cuts off proportional segments from the other two sides. This is the ﬁrst half
of Euclid’s Proposition VI.2.

Subtracting 1 from both sides and simplifying, we obtain DB=AD D EC=AE, which is

We have followed the lead of Euclid (as do most high-school texts) in using the theory
of area to prove this theorem. In fact, it is possible to give a proof that does not use areas at
all (and therefore does not require the area postulate)—see [Ven05, Chapter 7] for such a
proof. That proof is considerably more involved than the one we have given here; because
of that and because the area-based proof is perfectly rigorous and is much more likely to
be found in high-school texts, we have chosen to stick with Euclid’s approach. There is
little to be gained by avoiding the use of area in the treatment of similar triangles.
Triangle Similarity Theorems
The next theorem is the most important criterion for similarity. The closest Euclid comes to
this theorem is his Proposition VI.4. His statement is slightly weaker—he assumes all three
pairs of corresponding angles are congruent, not just two—but, of course, once we have
two congruences, the third follows from the angle-sum theorem. Our proof is somewhat
different from Euclid’s, but they are both based on the side-splitter theorem.
Theorem 12.3 (AA Similarity Theorem). If there is a correspondence between the ver-
tices of two triangles such that two pairs of corresponding angles are congruent, then the
triangles are similar under that correspondence.
Proof. Suppose 4ABC and 4DEF are triangles such that †A Š †D and †B Š †E.
By the angle-sum theorem for triangles, the measure of the third angle in each triangle is
equal to 180ı minus the sum of the measures of the other two, from which it follows that
†C Š †F . It remains only to prove that
AB
DE D AC
DF D BC
EF :
(12.6)
If any one of the ratios in (12.6) is equal to 1, then 4ABC is congruent to 4DEF by
ASA, and the theorem is true because all three ratios are equal to 1. So let us suppose that
all of these ratios are different from 1. We will prove the ﬁrst equality in (12.6); the proof
of the other equality is exactly analogous.
Since AB ¤ DE, one of them is larger—say, DE > AB. Choose a point P in the
interior of DE such that DP Š AB, and let ` be the line through P and parallel to

equation in (12.6).

This is one of the most important theorems in Euclidean geometry. Nearly every
geometry book has some version of it, although some high-school textbooks take it as an
additional postulate instead of proving it.
The next theorem shows that similar triangles can be readily constructed in Euclidean
geometry once a new size is chosen for one of the sides. It is an analogue for similar
triangles of the triangle copying theorem, Theorem 5.10. (Euclid’s Proposition VI.18 gives
a similar result with a similar proof but stated for more general polygons, not just triangles.)

12. Similarity
It is important to observe that although Theorem 5.10 showed that it is always possible
in neutral geometry to construct a triangle congruent to a given one, this construction of
similar triangles only works in Euclidean geometry because it uses Euclid’s Postulate 5
and the AA similarity theorem. In fact, we will see later that in hyperbolic geometry, it is
impossible to construct noncongruent similar triangles!
Here are some other useful criteria for similarity. These are Euclid’s Propositions VI.5
and VI.6, respectively.

Theorem 12.7 (Two Transversals Theorem). Suppose ` and `0 are parallel lines, and m

or `0. Let M and N be the points where m and n, respectively, meet `; and let M 0 and N 0

Proof. Because X does not lie on either ` or `0, it follows that the three collinear points
M, M 0, and X are all distinct. Thus one of them is between the other two.
CASE 1: M X M 0. In this case, we will show that N X N 0 as well. Suppose one
of the other possible betweenness relations holds, for example X  N  N 0. This implies
that X and N 0 are on opposite sides of `. However, the assumption M  X  M 0 implies
that X and M 0 are on the same side of ` (by the Y-lemma), and Lemma 7.18 implies that
M 0 and N 0 are on the same side of `. Thus X and N 0 are on the same side of `, which is a
contradiction. A similar contradiction follows from X N 0 N, so the only possibility is
N X N 0.
Because N and N 0 are on opposite sides of m, it follows that †NMX and †N 0M 0X
are alternate interior angles for the transversal m to ` and `0. Thus †NMX Š †N 0M 0X
by the converse to the alternate interior angles theorem. The same argument shows that
†MNX Š †M 0N 0X. Therefore, 4XMN 
 4XM 0N 0 by AA.

CASE 2: X M M 0 or X M 0 M. The argument is the same in both cases, so we
may as well assume the former. In this case, 4XM 0N 0 is a triangle and M is an interior
point on the side XM 0. Because ` k `0, it follows from the side-splitter theorem that N is
an interior point of XN 0 and XM=XM 0 D XN=XN 0. Thus 4XMN 
 4XM 0N 0 by the
SAS similarity theorem.

The midsegment theorem (Theorem 10.30) showed that any segment that bisects two
sides of a triangle is parallel to the third side. The next theorem is a generalization of that:
it says that any segment that cuts two sides of a triangle in the same proportion is parallel
to the third side. It is the second half of Euclid’s Proposition VI.2.
Theorem 12.8 (Converse to the Side-Splitter Theorem). Suppose 4ABC is a triangle
and D and E are interior points on AB and AC, respectively, such that

DE is parallel to

Proof. Exercise 12C.

Proportion Theorems
Similar triangles can be used to prove many important theorems about proportionality.
Here are two of them. The ﬁrst one says that the bisector of an angle of a triangle divides
the opposite side into segments that are proportional to the other two sides. Its proof is rated
PG. This is the ﬁrst half of Euclid’s Proposition VI.3, with essentially the same proof. (The
second half is the converse; see Exercise 12D.)
Theorem 12.9 (Angle Bisector Proportion Theorem). Suppose 4ABC is a triangle and
D is the point where the bisector of †BAC meets BC (Fig. 12.7). Then

Let †1, †2, †3, and †4 be as shown in Fig. 12.8. Because E AC, it follows that

that †2 Š †4. Combining the two angle congruences that we have just proved with the
fact that †1 Š †2 (by deﬁnition of angle bisector), we obtain †3 Š †1 Š †2 Š †4. The
converse to the isosceles triangle theorem then implies that EA D AB. Substituting this

Proof. First we prove (a). If B D B0, then the theorem follows immediately from the
two transversals theorem applied to t and t0, so assume that B and B0 are distinct points.
Let t00 be the line through B0 and parallel to t; by Proclus’s lemma, there are points A00
and C 00 where t00 intersects ` and n, respectively. (See Fig. 12.9. In the ﬁgure, B0 is
pictured between A0 and C 0, but the proof works equally well if the points are ordered in
other ways.) Then AA00B0B and BB0C 00C are parallelograms by the parallelogram lemma,
from which it follows that AB D A00B0 and BC D B0C 00. Therefore, to prove the theorem,
it sufﬁces to show that
A00B0

Collinearity and Concurrence Theorems
221
If C 00 D C 0, then t00 D t0, and the result follows trivially. On the other hand, if C 00 ¤ C 0,
then we can apply the two transversals theorem to t0 and t00 and obtain (12.10).
To prove (b), assume AB C. This implies that A and C are on opposite sides of m.
On the other hand, it follows from Lemma 7.18 that A and A0 are on the same side of m,
as are C and C 0. Thus A0 and C 0 are on opposite sides of m, so A0 B0 C 0. The reverse
implication is proved in the same way.
□
This theorem is called the “parallel projection theorem” because it suggests parallel
light rays projecting images of points of one line onto another line. In this context, part (a)
of the theorem says that parallel projection preserves ratios of lengths, and part (b) says
that it preserves betweenness.
Collinearity and Concurrence Theorems
The properties of similar triangles also yield some useful theorems about intersections
between lines and triangles. Admittedly, the next two theorems are not particularly exciting
in their own right; but they turn out to be essential tools for proving a number of interesting
and surprising geometric results (e.g., Theorem 12.13 and Exercises 14Q and 14X).
The ﬁrst such theorem was proved around 100 CE by an ancient Greek mathematician
named Menelaus of Alexandria. Its proof is rated PG.
Theorem 12.11 (Menelaus’s Theorem). Let 4ABC be a triangle. Suppose D;E;F are
points different from A;B;C and lying on
 !
AB ,
 !
BC , and
 !

two of the points lie on 4ABC or none of them do. Then D, E, and F are collinear if

Remark.
To make the statement of Menelaus’s theorem easier to remember, it is useful
to introduce the following deﬁnition: if 4ABC is a triangle, a transversal for 4ABC is
a line that intersects each of the edge lines
 !
AB ,
 !
BC , and
 !
CA but none of the vertices A,
B, or C. Note that Corollary 5.3 to Pasch’s theorem implies that a transversal must meet
either two sides of the triangle or none (see Fig. 12.10). The “only if ” part of Menelaus’s
theorem is equivalent to the statement that whenever a transversal meets

For the converse, let D;E;F be points satisfying the hypothesis and assume that
(12.11) holds. At least one of the points D;E;F does not lie on 4ABC; assume without
loss of generality that F is such a point. First, we will show that

The Golden Ratio

This quadratic equation has two solutions, given by
x D 1˙

:
The only positive solution is x D ', given by (12.18), so a=b must be equal to this number.
Conversely, if ABCD is a rectangle in which the side lengths are a and b with a D
'b, then a straightforward computation shows that (12.19) is satisﬁed, which shows that
ABCD is a golden rectangle.
□
The golden ratio shows up in a surprising variety of contexts. Euclid was already aware
of many of the special properties of segments whose lengths are related by this ratio, which
he called extreme and mean ratio (see, for example, Propositions II.11, VI.30, XIII.1–6,
XIII.8–9). It is an irrational number, '  1:618034:::, and the fact that it is a solution to
equations (12.20) and (12.21) implies the following remarkable numerical relationships:
'  1:618034:::;

' D ' 1  0:618034:::;
(12.23)
'2 D ' C1  2:618034::::
(12.24)
It has close connections with such mathematical concepts as the Fibonacci numbers and
logarithmic spirals, both of which arise frequently in mathematical descriptions of natural
phenomena (if you don’t know what these are, look them up). Ever since the Renaissance,
the golden ratio has played a role in the philosophy of art as well, with many authors
arguing that golden rectangles are the most aesthetically pleasing rectangles. The beautiful
book [Liv02] by Mario Livio gives an engaging and thorough historical account of the
golden ratio in mathematics and culture.
For now, we will content ourselves with presenting one important application of the
golden ratio. (Others will appear in Chapter 16.) We have studied three special triangles so
far: the 60-60-60, 30-60-90, and 45-45-90 triangles. The golden ratio allows us to analyze
one more special triangle. A golden triangle is an isosceles triangle in which the ratio of
the length of each leg to the length of the base is equal to the golden ratio (Fig. 12.15).

Perimeters and Areas of Similar Figures
When two polygons are similar, it is reasonable to expect that other geometric quantities
in addition to side lengths should be related in a simple way. One such quantity is the
perimeter of a polygon, which is deﬁned as the sum of the lengths of all its sides. We
denote the perimeter of P by perim.P /.
Theorem 12.16 (Perimeter Scaling Theorem). If two polygons are similar, then the ratio
of their perimeters is the same as the ratio of their corresponding side lengths.
Proof. Suppose P and P 0 are similar polygons, and let r be the scale factor of the sim-
ilarity, so each side of P is r times as long as the corresponding side of P 0. If the side
lengths of P are s1;:::;sn and those of P 0 are s0

□
A geometric quantity associated with polygons is said to be one-dimensional if the
corresponding quantities of similar polygons have the same ratio as the corresponding side
lengths. Thus side lengths and perimeters are one-dimensional quantities. The next two
theorems describe two more such quantities.
Theorem 12.17 (Height Scaling Theorem). If two triangles are similar, their correspond-
ing heights have the same ratio as their corresponding side lengths.
Proof. Exercise 12L.
□
Theorem 12.18 (Diagonal Scaling Theorem). If two convex quadrilaterals are similar,
the lengths of their corresponding diagonals have the same ratio as their corresponding
side lengths.
Proof. Exercise 12M.
□
By contrast, areas scale differently. The next theorem is Euclid’s Proposition VI.19.
Theorem 12.19 (Triangle Area Scaling Theorem). If two triangles are similar, then the
ratio of their areas is the square of the ratio of their corresponding side lengths; that is, if
4ABC

Right Triangles
Right triangles are among the most important ﬁgures in Euclidean geometry. In previous
chapters, we have already seen some important properties of right triangles:
 Every right triangle has two acute angles (Corollary 5.15).
 The hypotenuse is the longest side of a right triangle (Corollary 5.17).
 The altitude to the hypotenuse meets the interior of the hypotenuse (Corollary 7.5).
 The area is one-half the product of the lengths of the legs (Lemma 11.9).
In this chapter, we will develop many more such properties.
The Pythagorean Theorem
Our ﬁrst fact about right triangles is arguably the most important theorem in all of Eu-
clidean geometry and indeed one of the most important in all of mathematics.
Theorem 13.1 (The Pythagorean Theorem). Suppose 4ABC is a right triangle with
right angle at C, and let a, b, and c denote the lengths of the sides opposite A, B, and C,
respectively (Fig. 13.1). Then a2 Cb2 D c2.

D ˛.W XYZ/C˛.4ZP W /C˛.4WQX/C˛.4XRY /C˛.4YSZ/:
It follows from SAS that each of the triangles in the sum above is congruent to 4ABC.
This implies, ﬁrst, that each such triangle has area equal to 1
2ab and, second, that each
hypotenuse has the same length as the hypotenuse of 4ABC, namely c. Once we show
that W XYZ is a square, we can conclude that

D c2 C2ab:
(13.3)
Equating (13.2) and (13.3) and subtracting 2ab from both sides, we obtain a2 Cb2 D c2.
It remains only to prove that W XYZ is a square. We showed above that its side lengths
are all equal to c, so we only need to show that its angles are right angles. First we will show
that †QW X, †XW Z, and †ZWP satisfy the hypotheses of the linear triple theorem.
Clearly
!
WP and
!
WQ are opposite rays. Because †QW X is acute and †QW Z is obtuse
(being supplementary to the acute angle †ZWP ), it follows from the ordering lemma
for rays that

W X 
!
W Z . The same argument shows that

therefore the linear triple theorem applies: m†QW X C m†XW Z C m†ZWP D 180ı.
Because †QW X and †ZWP are congruent to the two acute angles of the right triangle
4ABC, they are complementary, so it follows that †XW Z is a right angle. The same
argument applies to each of the other three angles of W XYZ.
□
Later in this chapter, we will give an even shorter proof based on similar triangles.
It is important to know that the converse to the Pythagorean theorem is also true. It is
Euclid’s Proposition I.48, the last proposition in Book I.
Theorem 13.2 (Converse to the Pythagorean Theorem). Suppose 4ABC is a triangle
with side lengths a, b, and c. If a2 C b2 D c2, then 4ABC is a right triangle, and its
hypotenuse is the side of length c.
Proof. Exercise 13C.
□
Applications of the Pythagorean Theorem
The Pythagorean theorem abounds with applications. We present just a few of them here.
Theorem 13.3 (Side Lengths of 30-60-90 Triangles). In a triangle with angle measures
30ı, 60ı, and 90ı, the longer leg is
p
3 times as long as the shorter leg, and the hypotenuse
is twice as long as the shorter leg.
Proof. Exercise 13D.
□
Theorem 13.4 (Side Lengths of 45-45-90 Triangles). In a triangle with angle measures
45ı, 45ı, and 90ı, the legs are congruent, and the hypotenuse is
p
2 times as long as either
leg.

□
Theorem 13.5 (Diagonal of a Square). In a square, each diagonal is
p
2 times as long
as each side.
Proof. The diagonal is the hypotenuse of a right triangle whose legs are two sides of the
square.
□
The next application, at face value, does not appear to have anything to do with the
Pythagorean theorem, or even with right triangles. It gives an answer to the following
question: which triples of positive numbers can be the side lengths of a triangle? Obviously
they have to satisfy the constraints imposed by the triangle inequality: each number must
be strictly less than the sum of the other two. The next theorem, whose proof is rated PG,
says that this is the only limitation. It is Euclid’s Proposition I.22, but with a decidedly
different proof.
Theorem 13.6 (SSS Existence Theorem). Suppose a, b, and c are positive real numbers
such that each one is strictly less than the sum of the other two. Then there exists a triangle
with side lengths a, b, and c.
Proof. To ﬁgure out how to proceed, we will reason heuristically for a moment: let us
pretend that we have already found such a triangle and see what the Pythagorean theorem
tells us. Suppose 4ABC is a triangle in which the sides opposite A, B, and C have lengths
a, b, and c, respectively. Relabeling if necessary, we may assume that a  b  c. Let F
be the foot of the perpendicular from C to AB (Fig. 13.5); since we have arranged for AB

to be the longest side, it follows from Corollary 7.4 that F lies in the interior of AB. Let
h D CF , x D BF , and y D FA. Then the betweenness theorem for points implies that
c D x Cy;
(13.4)
and the Pythagorean theorem implies
b2 D y2 Ch2;
(13.5)
a2 D x2 Ch2:
(13.6)
Subtracting (13.6) from (13.5) and substituting (13.4) for x Cy, we obtain
b2 a2 D y2 x2 D .y Cx/.y x/ D c.y x/:
(13.7)

Now (13.7) and (13.4) are a pair of linear equations for the unknowns x and y, which can
easily be solved to yield
x D c2 b2 Ca2

y D c2 a2 Cb2

(13.8)
It then follows from (13.6) that
h D

a2 x2:
(13.9)
With these computations as motivation, let us proceed with the formal proof. As
above, we can assume that the three numbers are labeled so that a  b  c. Then the
hypothesis implies, in particular, that c < a Cb.
We begin by deﬁning real numbers x and y by (13.8). The ﬁrst thing we need to
check is that x and y are positive. The assumption that c is the largest of the three numbers
implies that c2b2  0, and thus c2b2Ca2  a2 > 0, so x is positive. A similar analysis
shows that y is positive.
Next, we need to check that x < a. We compute
a x D a  c2 b2 Ca2
2c
D 2ac c2 Cb2 a2
2c
D b2 .c a/2
2c
:
(13.10)
The fact that a C b > c implies that b > c a. Because b and c a are nonnegative, this
in turn implies b2 > .c a/2, so (13.10) shows that a x is positive. Thus a > x, which
implies a2 > x2, so we can deﬁne a positive real number h by (13.9). A direct (albeit
tedious) computation then shows that (13.4), (13.5), and (13.6) are all satisﬁed by these
choices of x, y, and h.
Let AB be any segment of length c. Because 0 < x < a  c, there is a point F in the
interior of AB such that BF D x. Let m be the line perpendicular to
 !
AB at F , and let C
be a point on m such that CF D h. Then the betweenness theorem for points together with
(13.4) shows that FA D c x D y, and the Pythagorean theorem together with (13.5) and
(13.6) yields
BC D

x2 Ch2 D a;
AC D

y2 Ch2 D b:
Thus 4ABC has the desired side lengths.
□
The preceding proof relies on the Pythagorean theorem, which is true only in Eu-
clidean geometry. In fact, the SSS existence theorem is actually true in neutral geometry,
but its proof is considerably harder. One source for the proof is [Mar96, Theorem 20.15].
In practice, the next corollary, which can be viewed as a complement to the AAA
construction theorem (Theorem 10.17), is the most useful application of the SSS existence
theorem.
Corollary 13.7 (SSS Construction Theorem). Suppose a, b, and c are positive real
numbers such that each one is strictly less than the sum of the other two, and AB is a
segment of length c. Then on either side of
 !
AB , there exists a unique point C such that
4ABC has side lengths a, b, and c opposite vertices A, B, and C, respectively.
Proof. The preceding theorem implies that there is a triangle with side lengths a, b, and
c, so on each side of
 !
AB we can make a copy of that triangle with AB as one of its sides.
Uniqueness follows from the unique triangle theorem (Theorem 5.11).

13. Right Triangles
Similarity Relations in Right Triangles
The theory of similar triangles yields some important relations involving the altitude to the
hypotenuse of a right triangle. The ﬁrst one is Euclid’s Proposition VI.8, with the same
proof.
Theorem 13.8 (Right Triangle Similarity Theorem). The altitude to the hypotenuse of
a right triangle cuts it into two triangles that are similar to each other and to the original
triangle.
A
B
C
F
Fig. 13.6. The right triangle similarity theorem.
Proof. Let 4ABC be a right triangle with right angle at C, and let F be the foot of the
altitude from C to the hypotenuse (Fig. 13.6). By Corollary 7.5, F is an interior point of
AB. We will show that 4CBF 
 4ACF 
 4ABC.
Because 4CBF and 4ABC share †B and have right angles at F and C, respectively,
it follows from the AA similarity theorem that 4CBF 
 4ABC. Similarly, 4ACF
and 4ABC share †A and have right angles at F and C, so 4ACF 
 4ABC. Since
similarity is transitive, we also have 4CBF 
 4ACF .
□
The most important application of the preceding theorem is to derive relationships
among the lengths of the various line segments in Fig. 13.6. To state these relationships
concisely, let us introduce some standard terminology. If 4ABC is a right triangle with
right angle at C and F is the foot of the altitude from C, then BF is called the projection
of BC onto the hypotenuse, and AF is called the projection of AC onto the hypotenuse.
(If you visualize the triangle sitting upright on its hypotenuse, you can think of these pro-
jections as representing the shadows of the legs cast onto the hypotenuse by an overhead
light source.)
If x and y are positive real numbers, the number m D pxy is called the geometric
mean of x and y. It is the unique positive number such that
x
m D m
y :
The geometric mean is also sometimes called the mean proportional. For brevity, we will
often say “one segment is the geometric mean of two others” to mean that the length of the
ﬁrst segment is the geometric mean of the lengths of the other two.

Similarity Relations in Right Triangles
237
Theorem 13.9 (Right Triangle Proportion Theorem). In every right triangle, the fol-
lowing proportions hold:

Using the proportionality relations of the preceding theorem, we can present a very
short proof of the Pythagorean theorem. This is essentially the same as the second proof
offered by Euclid (Proposition VI.31) but translated into modern algebraic language.
Proof of the Pythagorean theorem by similar triangles. Let 4ABC be a right triangle
with its right angle at C, let a, b, and c denote the lengths of the sides as in the statement
of the theorem, and let x, y, and h be deﬁned as in the proof of Theorem 13.9. Cross-
multiplying the last two equations in (13.11) and adding them together, we obtain
a2 D cx;
b2 D cy;
a2 Cb2 D c.x Cy/:
Since x Cy D c, this proves the theorem.

13. Right Triangles
Trigonometry
Trigonometric ratios like sine and cosine are usually introduced in the context of the Carte-
sian plane. However, they can also be deﬁned purely in terms of axiomatic Euclidean
geometry, where they have some important geometric applications. In this section, we
introduce the main deﬁnitions and the most important results.
Suppose  is any positive real number less than 90. By the AAA construction theorem,
there exists a right triangle in which one angle has measure . If 4ABC and 4A0B0C 0 are
any two such triangles with m†C D m†C 0 D 90ı and m†A D m†A0 D , then 4ABC 
4A0B0C 0 by the AA similarity theorem (Fig. 13.8). Thus the following ratios are equal:
BC
AB D B0C 0
A0B0 ;
AC
AB D A0C 0
A0B0 :
Therefore, these ratios (length of opposite leg to length of hypotenuse and length of adja-
cent leg to length of hypotenuse) are independent of the choice of right triangle with an
angle of measure  and depend only on the number .

Fig. 13.8. Deﬁning trigonometric ratios.
We can thus make the following deﬁnitions: for any real number  such that 0ı <
 < 90ı, we deﬁne the sine of , denoted by sin, to be the ratio of the length of the leg
opposite the  angle to the length of the hypotenuse in any right triangle with an angle
whose measure is ; similarly, we deﬁne the cosine of , denoted by cos, to be the ratio
of the length of the leg adjacent to the  angle to the length of the hypotenuse in any such
right triangle. Succinctly, we can write
sin D
opposite
hypotenuse;
cos D
adjacent
hypotenuse:
For angle measures that are not between 0ı and 90ı, we have to make special deﬁnitions.
First of all, for obtuse angle measures, we deﬁne
sin D sin.180ı /
and
cos D cos.180ı /
if 90ı <  < 180ı.
Then for the special measures 0ı, 90ı, and 180ı, we deﬁne
sin0ı D 0;
cos0ı D 1I
sin90ı D 1;
cos90ı D 0I
sin180ı D 0;
cos180ı D 1:
(13.12)
These deﬁnitions will be justiﬁed by the simple statements of the theorems we will prove
below.
We can also deﬁne the sine and cosine of an angle to be the sine and cosine of its
measure: if †A is any angle, the sine of †A, denoted by sin†A, is deﬁned to be the sine

Trigonometry
239
of m†A, with a similar deﬁnition for the cosine of †A. Thus, for example, if 4ABC is
a right triangle with its right angle at C, we can write
sin†A D BC
AB ;
cos†A D AC
AB :
There are also other standard trigonometric ratios—the tangent, cotangent, secant, and
cosecant—that can be deﬁned similarly; but for our purposes the sine and cosine will be
sufﬁcient.
Some simple properties of the sine and cosine follow easily from the deﬁnitions.
Theorem 13.10. Suppose  2 Œ0;180. Then
0 < sin < 1
if and only if
0ı <  < 90ı or 90ı <  < 180ı;
(13.13)
0 < cos < 1
if and only if
0ı <  < 90ı;
(13.14)
1 < cos < 0
if and only if
90ı <  < 180ı.
(13.15)
Proof. These facts follow immediately from the deﬁnitions and the fact that the hypotenuse
of a right triangle is strictly longer than either leg.
□
Theorem 13.11. The cosine function is injective.
Proof. Suppose ˛ and ˇ are numbers in Œ0;180 such that cos˛ D cosˇ. Let x denote the
common value of these two cosines. Suppose ﬁrst that 0 < x < 1. It follows from Theorem
13.10 that ˛ and ˇ are both strictly between 0ı and 90ı. Construct right triangles 4ABC
and 4A0B0C 0 with AB D A0B0 D 1, m†A D ˛, m†B D ˇ, and m†C D m†C 0 D 90ı
(Fig. 13.9). (Such a triangle is easily constructed by ﬁrst constructing an angle with the
desired measure, marking a point on one ray at a distance 1 from the vertex, and dropping
a perpendicular to the other ray.) Our assumption implies that AC D A0C 0 D x. Therefore,
4ABC Š 4A0B0C 0 by HL, and so ˛ D ˇ.

Next, suppose 1 < x < 0. Then ˛ and ˇ are both strictly between 90ı and 180ı, and
we have
cos.180ı ˛/ D cos˛ D cosˇ D cos.180ı ˇ/:
It follows from the argument in the previous paragraph that 180ı ˛ D 180ı ˇ, and thus
˛ D ˇ.
Finally, if x is one of the special values 1, 0, or 1, then it follows from the deﬁnitions
and Theorem 13.10 that both ˛ and ˇ must be equal to 0ı, 90ı, or 180ı, respectively, and
thus they are equal to each other.
□
The most important fact about sines and cosines is the following identity. We use the
traditional notation for powers of the sine and cosine functions: for any positive integer n,
sinn  and cosn  mean .sin/n and .cos/n, respectively.

240
13. Right Triangles
Theorem 13.12 (The Pythagorean Identity). If  is any real number in the interval
Œ0;180, then sin2  Ccos2  D 1.
Proof. First suppose 0ı <  < 90ı, and let 4ABC be a right triangle with right angle at
C and with m†A D . (Such a triangle exists by the AAA construction theorem.) If we let
a;b;c denote the lengths of the sides opposite A, B, and C, respectively, then a2Cb2 D c2
by the Pythagorean theorem, and sin D a=c and cos D b=c by deﬁnition. Using a little
algebra, we compute
sin2  Ccos2  D

Next, if 90ı <  < 180ı, the preceding computation applies to 180ı , so the deﬁni-
tions of sine and cosine for obtuse angles yield
sin2  Ccos2  D sin.180ı /2 Ccos.180ı /2 D 1:
Finally, when  is one of the special angle measures 0ı, 90ı, or 180ı, the formula follows
directly from the deﬁnitions (13.12).
□
The next theorem is a generalization of the Pythagorean theorem to nonright triangles.
It will be used in the next section to prove that the postulates for Euclidean geometry are
categorical.
Theorem 13.13 (Law of Cosines). Let 4ABC be any triangle, and let a, b, and c denote
the lengths of the sides opposite A, B, and C, respectively. Then
a2 Cb2 D c2 C2ab cos†C:
(13.16)
Proof. Write  D m†C. Note that 4ABC has at least two acute angles, so at least one
of the angles †A and †B is acute. Since formula (13.16) is unchanged when a and b are
interchanged, we can interchange the names of the vertices A and B if necessary to ensure
that †B is acute. Let F be the foot of the perpendicular from A to
 !
BC , and deﬁne real
numbers h and x by h D AF and x D CF (Fig. 13.10). We consider three cases, depending
on the size of .
Fig. 13.10. Proof of the law of cosines.
CASE 1: 0ı <  < 90ı. Then F 2 IntBC by Theorem 7.3, and therefore BF D ax.
By deﬁnition, cos†C D x=b; and by the Pythagorean theorem,
c2 D h2 C.a x/2;
b2 D h2 Cx2:

241
Subtracting the second equation from the ﬁrst and simplifying, we obtain
c2 b2 D a2 2ax:
Substituting x D b cos†C and rearranging, we obtain (13.16).
CASE 2:  D 90ı. In this case, cos†C D 0 by deﬁnition, and (13.16) just reduces to
the Pythagorean theorem.
CASE 3: 90ı <  < 180ı. In this case, F lies in the interior of the ray opposite
!
CB by Theorem 7.2. This implies F  C  B and therefore FB D a C x. Now we have
cos†C D cos.180ı / D x=b, and the Pythagorean theorem gives
c2 D h2 C.a Cx/2;
b2 D h2 Cx2:
Again subtracting the second equation from the ﬁrst and simplifying, we obtain
c2 b2 D a2 C2ax D a2 2ab cos†C
as before.

The next theorem should be familiar from your prior study of trigonometry. It is
actually true for more general angles than we prove here, but for simplicity we prove it
only for angle measures less than 90ı. This theorem (or actually Corollary 13.17, which
follows from it) will play an important role in Chapter 16. Its proof is rated PG.
Theorem 13.15 (Sum Formulas). Suppose ˛ and ˇ are real numbers such that ˛, ˇ, and
˛ Cˇ are all strictly between 0ı and 90ı. Then
sin.˛ Cˇ/ D sin˛ cosˇ Ccos˛ sinˇ;
(13.18)
cos.˛ Cˇ/ D cos˛ cosˇ sin˛ sinˇ:
(13.19)
Proof. Let
!r be a ray starting at a point O, and let
!s and
!t be rays starting at O, both
on the same side of

r , such that m†rs D ˛ and m†rt D ˛ Cˇ. It then follows from the
ordering lemma for rays that

Let A be the point on

from A to

F to

AG . Because 4AOF and 4AOG are right triangles, the angle-sum theorem
for triangles gives m†OAF D 90ı  ˇ and m†OAG D 90ı  ˛  ˇ < m†OAF . Since

Because any two triangles with the same side lengths are congruent, it should come
as no surprise that all of the important geometric properties of a triangle can be computed
purely in terms of its side lengths. The law of cosines shows how the cosine of each angle
can be expressed in terms of side lengths. The next formula, which was written down
by the Greek mathematician Heron of Alexandria in the ﬁrst century CE, gives such an
expression for the area.
Theorem 13.18 (Heron’s Formula). Let 4ABC be a triangle, and let a;b;c denote the
lengths of the sides opposite A, B, and C, respectively. Then

□
Categoricity of the Euclidean Postulates
Recall from Chapter 6 that an axiomatic system is said to be categorical if given any two
models of it, there is an isomorphism between them. For models of Euclidean geometry, an
isomorphism means a one-to-one correspondence between the points of one model and the
points of the other, which takes lines to lines, distances to distances, and angle measures
to angle measures. We now have all the tools we need to prove that the postulates of
Euclidean geometry are categorical. The complete (R-rated) proof is not terribly hard, but
it is a little long, so we will merely sketch the main ideas here.
Theorem 13.19. The postulates for Euclidean geometry are categorical.
Sketch of proof.
Suppose M and M0 are two models of Euclidean geometry. We begin
by deﬁning a map F from the points of M to the points of M0.
Choose an arbitrary point O in M, and choose a line ` containing O. Let m be the line
perpendicular to ` at O, and choose points X 2 ` and Y 2 m such that OX D OY D 1.
Now make similar choices O0, `0, m0, X0, and Y 0 in M0 (see Fig. 13.12).
First, if P is any point of M that lies on `, we deﬁne P 0 D F.P / as follows: if
P D O, then P 0 D O0; if P 2 Int
!
OX , then P 0 is the unique point in Int
!
O0X0 such that
O0P 0 D OP ; and if P is in the interior of the ray opposite
!
OX , then P 0 is the unique point
in the interior of the ray opposite
!
O0X0 such that O0P 0 D OP .
Now if Q is a point of M that does not lie on `, we deﬁne Q0 D F.Q/ as follows. Let
P be the foot of the perpendicular from Q to `, let P 0 D F.P / as above, and let n0 be the
line in M0 perpendicular to `0 at P 0. If Q is on the same side of ` as Y , then let Q0 be

the point of n0 on the same side of `0 as Y 0, such that P 0Q0 D PQ; while if Q is on the
opposite side of ` from Y , let Q0 be the unique point of n0 on the opposite side of `0 from
Y 0, such that P 0Q0 D PQ.
To prove that this map deﬁnes an isomorphism, we need to check several things. For
brevity, for any point Q in the model M, we will let Q0 denote the corresponding point
F.Q/ in M0.
STEP 1: F preserves distances. More speciﬁcally, we have to show that if Q1 and
Q2 are any points of M, then Q0
1Q0
2 D Q1Q2. This is done in several stages: ﬁrst, when
Q1 and Q2 both lie on ` (using the deﬁnition of F ); second, when they both lie on a line
perpendicular to ` (again using the deﬁnition of F ); third, when they both lie on a line
parallel to ` (using the fact that opposite sides of a rectangle are congruent); and ﬁnally,
when none of the above are true (by drawing a right triangle in M with Q1 and Q2 as
vertices and legs parallel to ` and m, and an analogous triangle in M0, and using the fact
that the Pythagorean theorem holds in both M and M0).
STEP 2: F preserves betweenness of points. This means that if Q1  Q2  Q3, then
Q0
1  Q0
2  Q0
3. This follows easily from the fact that F preserves distances, by virtue of
the betweenness theorem for points and its converse.
STEP 3: F takes lines to lines, rays to rays, and segments to segments. In other words,
if k is any line, segment, or ray in M, then the set of all points of the form Q0 for Q 2 k is
a line, segment, or ray, respectively, in M0. This is an easy consequence of Step 2, because
lines, segments, and rays can be characterized in terms of betweenness.
STEP 4: F maps points of M bijectively to points of M0. if Q1 and Q2 are distinct
points of M, then Q0
1Q0
2 D Q1Q2 ¤ 0, so Q0
1 and Q0
2 are also distinct; thus F is injective.
To show that F is surjective, let Q0 be any point of M0, and let P 0 be the foot of the
perpendicular from Q0 to `0; then it is an easy matter to ﬁnd points P and Q in M such
that F.P / D P 0 and F.Q/ D Q0.
STEP 5: F preserves angle measures. The fact that F preserves zero angles and
straight angles is an easy consequence of the fact that it preserves betweenness. Because
F preserves distances, the law of cosines together with the fact that the cosine function is
injective shows that it preserves measures of proper angles.
□
The signiﬁcance of this theorem is that we can now be sure that every model of Eu-
clidean geometry is isomorphic to the Cartesian plane. Thus the Cartesian plane is, in a

sense, the only model of Euclidean geometry—in any other model, the points, lines, dis-
tances, angles, and areas will have exactly the same properties, with only the names of the
objects changed.

Circles
The next objects we will study are circles. Euclid placed circles on a high pedestal in his
development of geometry: one of his ﬁve axioms asserted, in essence, the possibility of
constructing a circle that has any given point as center and goes through any other given
point, and his ﬁrst three propositions were constructions making essential use of circles.
In our approach to geometry, circles play a less pivotal role, but they are important
nonetheless. For us, circles are sets of points, and their existence follows immediately
from the deﬁnitions (see Theorem 3.29). But we will have a number of signiﬁcant theorems
describing their properties.
Deﬁnitions
We begin by recalling some deﬁnitions. In Chapter 3, we deﬁned a circle as a set consisting
of all points whose distance from a given point is equal to a certain given positive number.
The given distance is called the radius of the circle, and the given point is called its center.
If O is any point and r is any positive number, the circle with center O and radius r is
denoted by C.O;r/:
C.O;r/ D fP W OP D rg:
When we do not need to refer speciﬁcally to the center and radius, we will name circles by
script letters near the beginning of the alphabet, such as C, D, E (most often C).
Here is some important terminology regarding circles. Suppose C D C.O;r/ is the
circle with center O and radius r.
 Any segment that has O as one endpoint and a point on C as the other endpoint is
called a radius of C (plural: radii).
 A chord of C is any segment whose endpoints both lie on C.
 A diameter of C is a chord that contains the center of C.
 Two circles are said to be concentric if they have the same center.
247

248
14. Circles
 A point P is an interior point of C if OP < r. The set of all interior points of C is
called the interior of C and is denoted by IntC.
 A point P is an exterior point of C if OP > r. The set of all exterior points of C is
called the exterior of C and is denoted by ExtC.
Note that the term radius is used in two different senses: it can mean a positive real
number, the common distance from the center to each point on the circle (usually called
“the radius” of the circle); or it can mean a line segment from the center to a point on the
circle (usually called “a radius” of the circle). It should always be clear from the context
which is meant. It follows from the deﬁnitions that every radius of C.O;r/ has length r.
Similarly, the word diameter is used with two different meanings: it can mean either
a chord containing the center, as deﬁned above (usually called “a diameter” of C); and it
can also mean the length of a chord containing the center, which is a real number (usually
called “the diameter” of C). The next lemma shows that all diameters have the same length,
so the phrase “the diameter of C” is justiﬁed.
Lemma 14.1. If C is a circle of radius r, then every diameter of C has length 2r, and the
center of C is the midpoint of each diameter.
Proof. Write C D C.O;r/. Suppose AB is a diameter of C, which means that A and B
lie on C and O 2 AB. Clearly O cannot be equal to A or B, because points on C have
distance r from O. It follows that AO B, so the betweenness theorem for points implies
that AB D AO COB D r Cr D 2r. Since O is an interior point of AB that is equidistant
from A and B, it is the midpoint.

The following lemma expresses a simple but important fact about circles.
Lemma 14.2. Two concentric circles that have a point in common are equal.
Proof. Suppose C.O;r/ and C.O0;r0/ are concentric circles and P is a point on both.
Then O D O0 because they are concentric, and r D OP D O0P D r0, which shows that
they have the same radius. By deﬁnition of circles, they are the same circle.

Circles and Lines
In Euclid’s Elements, we frequently encounter situations in which circles and lines are
supposed to intersect and in which it is obvious from a diagram that they do intersect;
but Euclid’s postulates are often not sufﬁcient to guarantee the existence of an intersection
point.
In this section, we explore the question of when a line and a circle can be shown to
intersect. The ﬁrst theorem shows that the possibilities for intersections are limited. It is
Euclid’s Proposition III.10.
Theorem 14.3. No circle contains three distinct collinear points.
Proof. Let C D C.O;r/ be a circle, and assume for the sake of contradiction that there are
three distinct points A;B;C 2 C that are all collinear. One of them is between the other
two, so without loss of generality say that AB C (Fig. 14.1). By deﬁnition of a circle,

OA D OB D OC D r, which means that 4AOB, 4AOC, and 4BOC are all isosceles
triangles. From the isosceles triangle theorem we conclude that
†2 Š †1;
†1 Š †4;
and
†4 Š †3;
where the angles are labeled as in Fig. 14.1. It follows by transitivity that †2 Š †3.
Because A, B, and C are collinear, †2 and †3 are congruent angles forming a linear pair,
so they are both right angles. But then †1 and †4 are also right angles, so 4AOC contains
two right angles, which is impossible.
□
As a consequence of the preceding theorem, every line that intersects a circle contains
either one or two points of the circle. There is a name for each type of line. Suppose C is
a circle and ` is a line. We say ` is tangent to C if ` \C contains exactly one point (Fig.
14.2) and ` is a secant line for C if ` \C contains exactly two points (Fig. 14.3). If ` is
tangent to C and P is the unique point in ` \ C, then P is called the point of tangency,
and we say ` is tangent to C at P.
Fig. 14.2. A tangent line.
Fig. 14.3. A secant line.
First we study secant lines. Note that secant lines and chords are closely related:
from the deﬁnitions, it follows that every secant line contains a unique chord (the segment
whose endpoints are the two points where the line intersects the circle), and every chord is
contained in a unique secant line (the line containing its endpoints).
Theorem 14.4 (Properties of Secant Lines). Suppose C is a circle and ` is a secant line
that intersects C at A and B. Then every interior point of the chord AB is in the interior
of C, and every point of ` that is not in AB is in the exterior of C.

Fig. 14.4. Proof of Theorem 14.4.
Proof. We will prove the ﬁrst statement and leave the second to Exercise 14A. Suppose
P is an interior point of AB, so A  P  B (Fig. 14.4(a)). Let O be the center of C, and
let r be its radius. First consider the case in which O 2

O is certainly an interior point of C. If P is an interior point of AB other than O, then
either P 2 IntOA or P 2 IntOB. In the former case, OP < OA D r (the whole segment
is greater than the part), so P 2 IntC; the proof in the latter case is the same.
Now consider the case in which O …
 !
AB , so A, B, and O are noncollinear. Because
OA D OB, it follows from the isosceles triangle theorem that †OAB Š †OBA. On the
other hand, †OPB is an exterior angle for 4OAP , from which it follows that m†OPB >
m†OAP D m†OBA. Thus the scalene inequality applied to 4OPB implies that OB >
OP . This means that OP < r, so P is an interior point of C.
□
The following theorem is essentially equivalent to Euclid’s Propositions III.1 and III.3.
Theorem 14.5 (Properties of Chords). Suppose C is a circle and AB is a chord of C.
(a) The perpendicular bisector of AB passes through the center of C.
(b) If AB is not a diameter, a radius of C is perpendicular to AB if and only if it bisects
AB.
Proof. Exercise 14B.
□
The next theorem rectiﬁes another one of the omissions in Euclid’s logic, by giving
conditions under which a circle and a line can be guaranteed to intersect. Euclid tacitly
used the result of this theorem, for example, in his proof of Proposition I.12, his version of
the theorem on dropping a perpendicular (see Exercise 14C).
Theorem 14.6 (Line-Circle Theorem). Suppose C is a circle and ` is a line that contains
a point in the interior of C. Then ` is a secant line for C, and thus there are exactly two
points where ` intersects C.
Proof. Let O be the center of C and let r be its radius. If ` contains O, then by the segment
construction theorem, there are two distinct points on ` whose distance from O is r (one
on each ray starting at O), and these points lie on C, so ` is a secant line. For the remainder
of the proof, assume that O … `.
Let P be a point on ` that lies in the interior of C. If F is the foot of the perpendicular
from O to `, then Theorem 7.13 together with our hypothesis implies that OF  OP < r.

similar computation shows that B 2 C. Since A and B are distinct points, ` is a secant line
as claimed.
□
Now we turn our attention to tangent lines. Note that the deﬁnition of a tangent line
to a circle stipulates only that it is a line that intersects the circle in exactly one point. But
like many other concepts in Euclidean geometry, the intuitive idea of “tangency” comes
freighted with other associations about how the line and the circle are situated with respect
to each other—for example, we think of the “direction” of a tangent line as being deter-
mined by the circle in a certain way, and we think of a tangent line as touching the circle
but not going inside it. The next two theorems justify some of those associations. The ﬁrst
is equivalent to Euclid’s Propositions III.16 and III.18.
Theorem 14.7 (Tangent Line Theorem). Suppose C is a circle and ` is a line that inter-
sects C at a point P . Then ` is tangent to C if and only if ` is perpendicular to the radius
through P .
Proof. Let O be the center of C and let r be its radius. Suppose ﬁrst that ` ? OP ; we will
show that ` is tangent to C at P . Because P is the foot of the perpendicular from O to `, it
follows from Theorem 7.13 that any other point Q 2 ` distinct from P satisﬁes OQ > OP
(Fig. 14.6). This means that OQ ¤ r, so Q … C; thus P is the only point of `\C, which
means that ` is tangent to C.

Conversely, suppose ` is tangent to C at P . If Q is any point of ` other than P , then
Q cannot lie on C because then ` would be a secant line by deﬁnition; and Q cannot lie
in the interior of C because then ` would be a secant line by Theorem 14.6. Thus Q is
exterior to C, which means OQ > r. Since OP D r, it follows that P is the closest point
to O on `, and thus OP ? ` by Theorem 7.13.
□
Corollary 14.8. If C is a circle and A 2 C, there is a unique line tangent to C at A.
Proof. Given C and A as in the hypothesis, the preceding theorem shows that a line is
tangent to C at A if and only if it is perpendicular to OA at A. Since there is a unique such
perpendicular, there is a unique tangent line at A.
□
The next theorem is an analogue for tangent lines of Theorem 14.4.
Theorem 14.9 (Properties of Tangent Lines). If C is a circle and ` is a line that is
tangent to C at P , then every point of ` except P lies in the exterior of C, and every point
of C except P lies on the same side of ` as the center of C.
Proof. Suppose ` is tangent to C at P , and let O be the center of C. The tangent line
theorem implies that P is the foot of the perpendicular from O to `. If Q is any point of
` other than P , then OQ > OP by Theorem 7.13. This means Q is in the exterior of C,
which proves the ﬁrst claim.
To prove the second, let Q be a point of C different from P . We need to show that OQ
does not meet `. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is a point X 2 OQ \ `.
Then X cannot be equal to Q because then ` would intersect C at the two distinct points
P and Q. Thus either X D O or O X Q. In either case, it follows that OX < OQ D r,
so X 2 IntC, contradicting the result of the preceding paragraph.
□
Intersections between Circles
Next we address the question of determining when two circles intersect. The next theorem
ﬁlls another glaring gap in Euclid’s logic. In his ﬁrst proof (Proposition I.1), he constructs
two circles whose radii are equal to the distance between their centers and concludes that
there is a point where they intersect. The next theorem justiﬁes this conclusion (see Exer-
cise 14D).
Theorem 14.10 (Two Circles Theorem). Suppose C and D are two circles. If either of
the following conditions is satisﬁed, then there exist exactly two points where the circles
intersect, one on each side of the line containing their centers.
(a) The following inequalities all hold:
d < r Cs;
s < r Cd;
r < d Cs;
where r and s are the radii of C and D, respectively, and d is the distance between
their centers.
(b) D contains a point in the interior of C and a point in the exterior of C.
Proof. Write C D C.O;r/ and D D C.Q;s/, and let d D OQ denote the distance between
the two centers. First assume that the hypotheses of (a) are satisﬁed. If d were equal to
zero, then the last two inequalities would imply s < r and r < s, which is a contradiction.

Intersections between Circles
253
Thus d is positive, and both r and s are positive by deﬁnition of circles. A point P is in the
intersection of C and D if and only if OP D r and QP D s. Because the three inequalities
hold, the SSS construction theorem (Corollary 13.7) guarantees that there are exactly two
such points, one on each side of
 !
OQ. This proves that condition (a) is sufﬁcient.

Fig. 14.7. Proof of the two circles theorem.
Now suppose that condition (b) is satisﬁed. We will prove that all three inequalities of
(a) hold, from which the conclusion follows. The hypothesis is that there is a point A 2 D
that is in the interior of C and another point B 2 D that is in the exterior of C (Fig. 14.7).
These facts can be summarized as follows:
OA < r;
OB > r;
QA D QB D s:
The general triangle inequality applied to the points O, A, and Q implies
d D OQ  OACAQ < r Cs;
s D AQ  AO COQ < r Cd;
so the ﬁrst two inequalities in (a) hold. (We could have written down a third triangle
inequality with OA on the left-hand side, but it is not helpful in proving (a), as you can
verify for yourself.) On the other hand, we can apply the general triangle inequality to O,
B, and Q to obtain
r < OB  OQ CQB D d Cs:
Thus the third inequality in (a) is satisﬁed, so condition (b) is also sufﬁcient.
□
There is another way that two circles can intersect: we say that two circles are tangent
to each other if they intersect at exactly one point (see Fig. 14.8).

Arcs and Inscribed Angles
Roughly speaking, an arc is a part of a circle cut off by two points on the circle. More
precisely, we make the following deﬁnitions (see Fig. 14.9). Suppose C D C.O;r/ is a
Minor arc

circle and A and B are two distinct points on C. If †AOB is a proper angle, we deﬁne the
minor arc bounded by A and B to be the set consisting of A, B, and all points on C that
are in the interior of †AOB; and we deﬁne the major arc bounded by A and B to be the
set consisting of A, B, and all points on C that are in the exterior of †AOB. If †AOB is
a straight angle (or, equivalently, if AB is a diameter), each set consisting of A, B, and all
points of C on one side of
 !
AB is called a semicircle. In general, an arc is a subset of a
circle that is either a major arc, a minor arc, or a semicircle. The points A and B deﬁning
the arc are called its endpoints, and all other points of the arc are called its interior points.
(We will prove shortly that endpoints and interior points are well deﬁned, independently
of the notation used to specify the arc.) It is immediate from the deﬁnitions that any two
distinct points on a circle are the endpoints of exactly two different arcs that intersect only
at those two points, and the entire circle is the union of those two arcs. These two arcs are
called conjugate arcs; thus for every arc, there is a unique arc of the same circle that is
conjugate to it.
Given a circle C, an arc of C can be unambiguously designated by specifying its two
endpoints and one point in its interior. The notation ¯
ACB means the arc with endpoints
A and B and with C as an interior point. More speciﬁcally, if †AOB is proper and
C 2 Int†AOB, then ¯
ACB means the minor arc with endpoints A and B; if †AOB is
proper and C 2 Ext†AOB, then ¯
ACB means the major arc with endpoints A and B; and
if †AOB is a straight angle, then ¯
ACB means the semicircle deﬁned by the intersection of
C with CHP
 !

. If it is clear from the context or unimportant which of the two arcs
bounded by A and B is meant, we will sometimes use the simpler notation ı
AB to denote
one of the arcs with endpoints A and B. (Some writers always use a three-letter notation
like ¯
ACB to denote a major arc and a two-letter notation like ı
AB to denote a minor one;
but since it is important for us to be able to refer to a generic arc ı
AB without knowing in
advance whether it is major or minor, we do not follow that convention.)



Arcs and Inscribed Angles
257
Central Angles and Inscribed Angles
Every arc is naturally associated with an angle whose vertex is at the center of the
circle, and we can use this angle to measure the “size” of the arc in degrees, as follows.
If ı
AB is any arc on C.O;r/, the angle †AOB is called the central angle associated with
ı
AB. We deﬁne the arc measure (or just measure) of ı
AB, denoted by m ı
AB, as follows:
 m ı
AB D m†AOB (the standard measure of †AOB) if ı
AB is a minor arc;
 m ı
AB D rm†AOB (the reﬂex measure of †AOB) if ı
AB is a major arc;
 m ı
AB D 180ı if ı
AB is a semicircle.
Lemma 14.15. Any two conjugate arcs have measures adding up to 360ı.
Proof. Two conjugate arcs are either a minor arc and its conjugate major arc, in which
case their measures add up to 360ı by deﬁnition, or two semicircles, in which case both
measures are 180ı.
□
There is another kind of angle that appears in the study of circles and is closely related
to arcs. If C is a circle, an angle is said to be inscribed in C if its vertex lies on C and the
interiors of both of its rays intersect C (Fig. 14.13).
A
B
C
Fig. 14.13. An inscribed angle.
Suppose †ABC is an angle inscribed in C, and suppose further that A and C are the
two points where the sides of the angle meet C. The points A and C determine two arcs of
C: the arc ¯
ABC, containing B, and its conjugate arc, which we denote simply by ı
AC. We
call ¯
ABC the inscribed arc for †ABC, and we call the conjugate arc ı
AC its intercepted
arc. In this situation, we also say that †ABC is inscribed in ¯
ABC . In particular, an angle
inscribed in a semicircle is an inscribed angle whose vertex lies on the circle and whose
sides intersect the circle at the endpoints of a diameter.
The oldest known relationship between inscribed angles and arcs is very old indeed:
the ﬁrst proof of the following theorem is generally attributed to the Greek mathematician
Thales (pronounced “Thay-leez”) of Miletus, who lived in Asia Minor almost 300 years
before Euclid. This result appears in Euclid as part of Proposition III.31, with essentially
the same proof as the one given here.
Theorem 14.16 (Thales’ Theorem). Any angle inscribed in a semicircle is a right angle.
Proof. Suppose †ABC is inscribed in a semicircle, and let C D C.O;r/ be the circle
containing the semicircle (Fig. 14.14). Suppose further that A and C have been chosen to
lie on C. Then AC is a diameter of C, and OA D OB D OC D r. Because 4AOB and
4BOC are both isosceles, we have †A Š †1 and †C Š †2, where †1 D †ABO and

180ı D m†ABC Cm†ACm†C
D m†ABC Cm†1Cm†2
D m†ABC Cm†ABC:
It follows that m†ABC D 90ı as claimed.
□
Thales’ theorem has the following important converse.
Theorem 14.17 (Converse to Thales’ Theorem). The hypotenuse of a right triangle is a
diameter of a circle that contains all three vertices.
Proof. Exercise 14I.
□
One important application of Thales’ theorem is to prove the existence of tangent lines
containing a point outside a circle. (This can be viewed as a complement to Corollary 14.8,
which proved the existence of a tangent line containing a point on the circle.) This result
appears in Euclid as Proposition III.17, but with a different proof.
Theorem 14.18 (Existence of Tangent Lines through an Exterior Point). Let C be a
circle, and let A be a point in the exterior of C. Then there are exactly two distinct tangent
lines to C containing A. The two points of tangency X and Y are equidistant from A, and
the center of C lies on the bisector of †XAY .
Proof. Let O be the center of C. To see how to proceed, suppose X is a point on C such
that
 !
AX is tangent to C at X. Then †AXO is a right angle by the tangent line theorem, and
therefore AO is a diameter of a circle that contains A, O, and X by the converse to Thales’
theorem. Thus we can look for tangent lines by constructing a circle whose diameter is
AO and ﬁnding the points where that circle intersects C. (See Fig. 14.15.)
Let D be the circle whose center is the midpoint of AO and whose radius is 1
2AO;
thus AO is a diameter of D. Then D contains the point O in the interior of C and the point
A in the exterior of C, so the two circles theorem shows that C and D have exactly two
points of intersection—call them X and Y . Because †AXO is inscribed in a semicircle
of D, it is a right angle by Thales’ theorem. Thus
 !
AX is tangent to C by the tangent line
theorem. The same argument shows that
 !
AY is tangent to C. Because OX D OY , the

triangles 4AXO and 4AYO are congruent by HL. Therefore, AX D AY , which means
that the points of tangency are equidistant from A. Moreover, OX consists of interior
points of C except for X, and
 !
AY consists of exterior points except for Y , so OX does not
intersect
 !
AY and thus O is on the same side of
 !
AY as X; similarly O is on the same side
of
 !
AX as Y . This means O 2 Int†XAY , and since †OAX Š †OAY , it follows that O
lies on the bisector of †XAY .
To prove that these are the only tangent lines, note that the argument in the ﬁrst para-
graph shows that if ` is any line through A and tangent to C, then the point of tangency has
to lie on both C and D, so it must be equal to either X or Y .
□
The next theorem is a signiﬁcant generalization of Thales’ theorem. Its proof is rated
PG.
Theorem 14.19 (Inscribed Angle Theorem). The measure of a proper angle inscribed in
a circle is one-half the measure of its intercepted arc.
Proof. Suppose †ABC is a proper angle inscribed in the circle C D C.O;r/, with A and
C chosen to lie on the circle. Let D be the other endpoint of the diameter containing B,
and let ` be the line tangent to C at B (see the upper left diagram in Fig. 14.16). Note that
the points A, C, and D all lie on the same side of ` by Theorem 14.9. It follows that
!
BA,
!
BC , and
!
BD all lie in one half-rotation, so if they are all distinct, one of them must be
between the other two. The proof of the theorem is divided into ﬁve cases, depending on
the arrangement of these rays. All ﬁve cases are illustrated in Fig. 14.16.
CASE 1:
!
BD is equal to
!
BA or
!
BC . Without loss of generality, suppose
!
BD D
!
BC .
Then B O C, and OB and OA are congruent because they are both radii of C. It follows
that †ABC and †OAB are congruent by the isosceles triangle theorem. Since †AOC is
an exterior angle for 4OAB, we have
m†AOC D m†ABC Cm†OAB D 2m†ABC:
Because B lies in the exterior of †AOC, it follows that the arc ı
AC intercepted by †ABC
is a minor arc, so m ı
AC D m†AOC D 2m†ABC.

Because

OC 

OD . Subtracting the
second equation in (14.1) from the ﬁrst and using the betweenness theorem for rays, we

The remaining possibility is that

implies m†AOC D 2m†ABC. Since D is in the interior of †AOC, the intercepted arc

CASE 4:

A and C are on opposite sides of

on the opposite side of

AC is intercepted by both †ABC and
†ADC. Thus these angles are congruent, so 4PAD 
 4P CB by AA similarity, and the
result follows.
□
Inscribed and Circumscribed Polygons
Next we explore the ways in which polygons and circles interact. Suppose P is a polygon
and C is a circle. We say that P is inscribed in C, or equivalently that C is circumscribed
about P , if all of the vertices of P lie on C (Fig. 14.19).

Not every polygon can be inscribed in a circle. For example, as the next theorem
shows, a necessary condition is that the polygon be convex.
Theorem 14.23. Every polygon inscribed in a circle is convex.
Proof. Suppose C is a circle and P is a polygon inscribed in C. To show that P is convex,
it sufﬁces to show that any two nonadjacent edges are semiparallel. Since nonadjacent
edges are nonintersecting chords of C, it sufﬁces to show that nonintersecting chords are
semiparallel. Suppose, therefore, that AB and CD are nonintersecting chords, and assume
for the sake of contradiction that they are not semiparallel. Without loss of generality, we
may assume that
 !
AB intersects CD at a point P (Fig. 14.20). Now P cannot be in AB
because we are assuming the chords do not intersect. By Theorem 14.4 applied to the
secant line
 !
AB , this means that P is an exterior point of C. On the other hand, because
P 2 CD, the same theorem applied to the secant line

CD implies that P is an interior point
of C (if C P D) or on C (if P D C or P D D). In either case, this is a contradiction,
so AB and CD are semiparallel.

A polygon that can be inscribed in a circle is called a cyclic polygon. If P is a cyclic
polygon, then a circle that is circumscribed about P (or, equivalently, in which P is in-
scribed) is called a circumcircle for P , and the center of the circumcircle is called a cir-
cumcenter for P . The next theorem shows, among other things, that every cyclic polygon
has a unique circumcircle and circumcenter and describes how to ﬁnd them. Recall that
two or more lines, rays, or segments are said to be concurrent if there is a point that lies
on all of them.

Theorem 14.24 (Circumcircle Theorem). A polygon P is cyclic if and only if the per-
pendicular bisectors of all of its edges are concurrent. If this is the case, the point O
where these perpendicular bisectors intersect is the unique circumcenter for P , and the
circle with center O and radius equal to the distance from O to any vertex is the unique
circumcircle.
Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that P is cyclic, and let C be a circumcircle for P (Fig. 14.21). Then
each edge of P is a chord for C. By Theorem 14.5, the perpendicular bisector of each
edge passes through the center of C, so it follows that the perpendicular bisectors are all
concurrent.
Fig. 14.21. The circumcircle theorem.
Conversely, suppose that the perpendicular bisectors of all of the edges of P are con-
current, and let O be a point where they all meet. By the perpendicular bisector theorem
(Theorem 7.8), O is equidistant from both endpoints of each edge. If we list the vertices in
sequence as A1;:::;An, this implies OA1 D OA2, OA2 D OA3, . . . , and OAn1 D OAn.
If we let r D OA1, it then follows that all of the vertices lie on the circle C.O;r/, so P is
cyclic.
To prove that the circumcircle is unique, suppose C.O;r/ and C.O0;r0/ are both cir-
cumcircles for P . Then the perpendicular bisectors of all the edges of P pass through
both O and O0. If O0 ¤ O, this means that all of the perpendicular bisectors are the same
line, which means that all of the edges of P are either collinear or parallel. Since adjacent
edges intersect and are noncollinear, this is impossible. Thus O D O0. Because the two
circumcircles are concentric and both pass through the vertices, they are the same circle by
Lemma 14.2.
□
Using this theorem, it is easy to come up with examples of convex quadrilaterals that
are not cyclic (see Exercise 14U). For triangles, however, the situation is much simpler.
This theorem is Euclid’s Proposition IV.5, and our proof is essentially the same as his.
Theorem 14.25 (Cyclic Triangle Theorem). Every triangle is cyclic.
Proof. Let 4ABC be any triangle (Fig. 14.22). Let ` be the perpendicular bisector of
AB, and let m be the perpendicular bisector of BC. If ` were parallel to m, then
 !
AB
would be parallel to
 !
BC by Corollary 10.6, which is impossible by deﬁnition of a triangle.
Thus ` and m must intersect.
Let O be a point where ` and m intersect. Because O is on the perpendicular bisector
of AB, it is equidistant from A and B by the perpendicular bisector theorem; and because it

is also on the perpendicular bisector of BC, it is equidistant from B and C. In other words,
OA D OB D OC. If we set r D OA, it follows that 4ABC is inscribed in C.O;r/, so it
is cyclic.
□
Corollary 14.26 (Perpendicular Bisector Concurrence Theorem). In any triangle, the
perpendicular bisectors of all three sides are concurrent.
Proof. The circumcenter is a point where the perpendicular bisectors meet.
□
Corollary 14.27. Given three noncollinear points, there is a unique circle that contains
all of them.
Proof. Three noncollinear points determine a triangle, and the circle in question is the
triangle’s circumcircle.
□
As we mentioned above, not every quadrilateral is cyclic, but there is a simple neces-
sary and sufﬁcient criterion. The “only if ” part of the next theorem is Euclid’s Proposition
III.22. The proof of the theorem is rated PG.
Theorem 14.28 (Cyclic Quadrilateral Theorem). A quadrilateral ABCD is cyclic if and
only if it is convex and both pairs of opposite angles are supplementary: m†ACm†C D
180ı and m†B Cm†D D 180ı.
Proof. Suppose ﬁrst that ABCD is a cyclic quadrilateral. Theorem 14.23 shows that it is
convex. Let C be its circumcircle (Fig. 14.23); then †A is inscribed in C, and its inter-
cepted arc is ¯
BCD. Similarly, †C is inscribed in C with intercepted arc ¯
DAB. Since the
measures of conjugate arcs add up to 360ı by Lemma 14.15, the inscribed angle theorem
yields
m†ACm†C D 1
2m ¯
BCD C 1
2m ¯
DAB D 1
2 .m ¯
BCD Cm ¯
DAB/ D 180ı:
Exactly the same argument shows that †B and †D are supplementary. This proves that
the opposite angle condition is necessary.
Conversely, suppose ABCD is a quadrilateral that is not cyclic. We need to prove
that either it is nonconvex or it has a pair of nonsupplementary opposite angles. If it
is nonconvex, we are done, so assume henceforth that ABCD is convex. Let C be the
circumcircle for 4ABC. Because ABCD is not cyclic, D does not lie on C (Fig. 14.24).

The diagonals AC and BD have a point X in common by Theorem 9.4. Because X is an
interior point of the chord AC, it is in the interior of C by Theorem 14.4. Because
 !

contains X, the line-circle theorem shows that it is a secant line, and therefore it meets
C at a second point E. Because all points of C are on one side of the tangent to C at B
(Theorem 14.9), E must lie on
!
BD and not its opposite ray. Thus either B  E  D or
B D E. The argument is nearly the same in both cases, so we will just give the details
for the former case. The quadrilateral ABCE is cyclic, so the result of the ﬁrst paragraph
shows that its opposite angles are supplementary. In particular, this means
m†BCE Cm†BAE D 180ı:

From betweenness vs. betweenness, we conclude that

and †BCD are not supplementary.
□
Circumscribed Polygons
Now we introduce a concept that is, in a certain sense, complementary to inscribed
polygons. If AB is a segment and C is a circle, we say that AB is tangent to C if the line
 !
AB is tangent to C and the point of tangency lies on AB. If P is a polygon and C is a
circle, we say that P is circumscribed about C, or equivalently that C is inscribed in P ,
if every edge of P is tangent to C (Fig. 14.25). If C is inscribed in P , we say that C is an
incircle for P and its center is an incenter for P . A polygon that has an incircle is said to
be a tangential polygon.
Fig. 14.25. A tangential polygon.
Lemma 14.29. If C is an incircle for a polygon P , then the point of tangency for each
edge is an interior point of the edge.

266
14. Circles
Proof. Let C be an incircle for P , and assume for contradiction that some edge is tangent
to C at a vertex V . Then the other edge that shares the vertex V is also tangent to C at
V , and by Corollary 14.8, this means that the two edges are collinear. This contradicts the
deﬁnition of a polygon.
□
Just like cyclic polygons, tangential polygons are always convex. This fact is consid-
erably harder to prove than its cyclic counterpart. We begin with a technical lemma, which
will also be useful in the next chapter. This proof is rated PG.
Lemma 14.30. Let P be a polygon circumscribed about a circle C. Suppose A is any
vertex of P , and E and F are the points of tangency of the two edges containing A. Then
there are no points of P in the interior of 4AEF .
Proof. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that there is a point of P in Int4AEF .
Label the vertices of P as A1;:::;An with the labels chosen so that A D A1. Let i be the
smallest index such that AiAiC1 contains a point in Int4AEF , and let X be such a point
(Fig. 14.26). We wish to show that Ai is an exterior point of 4AEF . Note that E and F
are interior points of their respective edges by Lemma 14.29, so A is the only vertex of P
on 4AEF . Now Ai cannot be equal to A, because the two edges containing A intersect
the triangle 4AEF itself but not its interior; thus Ai does not lie on 4AEF . It is also
the case that Ai … Int4AEF , because Ai is also on the edge Ai1Ai, which does not
contain any interior points of 4AEF by our choice of i. Therefore Ai is an exterior point
of 4AEF and X is an interior point, which implies that AiX contains a point on 4AEF
by Lemma 8.11. Since AiX  AiAiC1, we also conclude that AiAiC1 intersects 4AEF .
Now, the edge AiAiC1 is contained in a tangent line, so it contains no interior points of
C and therefore no interior points of the chord EF by Theorem 14.5. On the other hand,
AiAiC1 cannot intersect either AE or AF , because distinct edges of P can intersect only
at a common vertex. This is a contradiction, and thus the lemma is proved.

Theorem 14.31. Every tangential polygon is convex.
Proof. Suppose P is a tangential polygon, and let C D C.O;r/ be its inscribed circle. Let
` be an edge line of P ; we will show that all vertices of P are contained in CHP.`;O/.
Assume for the sake of contradiction that this is not the case: then there is a vertex A that

Inscribed and Circumscribed Polygons
267
is on the opposite side of ` from O. This implies that there is a point X where AO meets
` (Fig. 14.27). Let G be the point of tangency of ` with C, so G is a point of P . We will
show that G lies in the interior of 4AEF , which contradicts the result of Lemma 14.30.
Because G lies on C and is not equal to E or F , Theorem 14.9 guarantees that G
lies on the same side of
 !
AE as F and on the same side of
 !
AF as E. To prove that
G 2 Int4AEF , it remains only to show that G lies on the same side of
 !
EF as A. Since
O lies in the interior of †EAF , the crossbar theorem shows that there is a point Y where
the ray
!
AO meets EF . We need to show that Y is actually an interior point of the segment
AO. It is easy to check that 4AEO Š 4AFO by SSS, which implies †EAO Š †FAO
and therefore 4EAY Š 4FAY by SAS. Consequently, †EYA and †F YA are congruent
to each other and thus are both right angles. Since EY is the altitude to the hypotenuse of
the right triangle 4AEO, it follows that Y 2 IntAO as claimed.
Because we are assuming that A and O lie on opposite sides of `, we have AX O;
and since Y is an interior point of C and X is exterior, we have OX < OY and therefore
X Y O by the ordering lemma for points. Together, these two relations imply AX 
Y O by Theorem 3.16, which in turn implies AX Y . Thus A and X are on the same
side of
 !
EF . If G and X were on opposite sides, then GX would intersect
 !
EF at a point
Z. Now, G and X are both interior points of †EAF , which is a convex set, so this means
that Z would also be in Int†EAF . The portion of
 !
EF in Int†EAF is exactly IntEF , so
Z lies on EF . This is a contradiction, because Z lies on the tangent line `, which contains
no interior points of C.
We have shown that for each edge line of P , all of the vertices of P lie in one of
the closed half-planes determined by that edge line. Since closed half-planes are convex
sets, it follows that all of P lies in the same closed half-plane, and thus P is a convex
polygon.
□
Corollary 14.32. If P is a tangential polygon, then the interior of its incircle is contained
in the interior of P .
Proof. Suppose P is a tangential polygon and C is its incircle. Let X be any point in
IntC. Because P is convex, to prove that X 2 IntP , we need only show that X lies on the
P -side of each of the edge lines of P . Let ` be one of the edge lines, so ` is a tangent line
to C (Fig. 14.28). It follows from Theorem 14.9 that every point of C lies on the P -side

of `. If we let m be the line through X and parallel to `, then m is a secant line by the
line-circle theorem. Let Y be one of the points where m meets C. Then Y lies on the
P -side of `, and XY does not meet `, so X lies on the P -side as well.

We are now ready for the main theorem about inscribed circles. Because most of the
groundwork has already been laid, we leave the proof as an exercise.
Theorem 14.33 (Incircle Theorem). A polygon P is tangential if and only if it is convex
and the bisectors of all of its angles are concurrent. If this is the case, the point O where
these bisectors intersect is the unique incenter for P , and the circle with center O and
radius equal to the distance from O to any edge line is the unique incircle.
Proof. Exercise 14O.
□
The next theorem is Euclid’s Proposition IV.4, with the same proof.
Theorem 14.34 (Tangential Triangle Theorem). Every triangle is tangential.
Proof. Let 4ABC be a triangle. Let
!r be the bisector of †A and let
!s be the bisector
of †B (Fig. 14.29). By virtue of the incircle theorem, we just need to show that these rays
intersect and that their intersection point also lies on the bisector of †C.

To see that they intersect, ﬁrst note that the crossbar theorem implies that
!r intersects
BC at an interior point X. Then the crossbar theorem applied to 4ABX shows that
!s
intersects AX at a point O. Thus O lies on the bisector of †A, so it is equidistant from
 !
AB and
 !
AC by the angle bisector theorem; and it also lies on the bisector of †B, so it is
equidistant from
 !
AB and
 !
BC . By transitivity, it is equidistant from
 !
AC and
 !
BC . If we
can show that O is in the interior of †C, it will then follow from the converse to the angle
bisector theorem that it lies on the bisector of †C as well, and then the incircle theorem
will show that 4ABC is tangential with O as its incenter.
The fact that
!r is in the interior of †A means, in particular, that O lies on the same
side of
 !
AC as B; and the fact that
!s is in the interior of †B means that O lies on the same
side of
 !
BC as A. Thus O is in the interior of †C as required.
□
Corollary 14.35 (Angle Bisector Concurrence Theorem). In any triangle, the bisectors
of the three angles are concurrent.
Proof. The incenter is a point where all three bisectors meet.
□
We have now seen three different concurrence theorems for triangles, and associated
with each concurrence theorem is a “center” where three lines meet: the medians meet at

Inscribed and Circumscribed Polygons
269
the centroid (Theorem 12.13), the perpendicular bisectors of the sides meet at the circum-
center (Corollary 14.26), and the angle bisectors meet at the incenter (Corollary 14.35).
There is one more important center associated with triangles, described in the next theo-
rem.
Theorem 14.36 (Altitude Concurrence Theorem). In any triangle, the lines containing
the three altitudes are concurrent.
Proof. Exercise 14P.
□
The point where the lines containing the altitudes meet is called the orthocenter of
the triangle. In general, the four centers of a triangle (centroid, incenter, circumcenter,
orthocenter) are all distinct, except in the case of equilateral triangles (see Exercise 14R).
Next we explore the question of which quadrilaterals are tangential. We begin with
the following simple special case.
Lemma 14.37. Every kite is a tangential quadrilateral.

Fig. 14.30. A kite is a tangential quadrilateral.
Proof. Suppose ABCD is a kite with AB D BC and CD D DA (Fig. 14.30). Then the
diagonal BD cuts ABCD into two congruent triangles 4ABD and 4CBD by SSS, and
thus †ABD Š †CBD and †ADB Š †CDB. Let O be the point where the bisector of
†A meets BD. By SAS, 4ABO Š 4CBO and 4ADO Š 4CDO, so it follows that
!
CO
bisects †C. Therefore the bisectors of all four angles of ABCD meet at O, so ABCD is
tangential by the incircle theorem.
□
For general quadrilaterals, there is a simple necessary and sufﬁcient criterion, analo-
gous to the one for cyclic quadrilaterals. This proof is also rated R.
Theorem 14.38 (Tangential Quadrilateral Theorem).
A quadrilateral ABCD is tan-
gential if and only if it is convex and both pairs of opposite side lengths have the same sum:
AB CCD D AD CBC.
Proof. First suppose ABCD is a tangential quadrilateral, and let C be its incircle. Theo-
rem 14.31 shows that ABCD is convex. Let E, F , G, and H denote the points of tangency
of the sides AB, BC, CD, and DA, respectively (Fig. 14.31). By Theorem 14.18, A is
equidistant from E and H, and similarly each of the other vertices is equidistant from the

points of tangency on the two edges that meet at that vertex. Let w, x, y, and z denote the
lengths of the segments shown in the diagram. Then AB C CD and AD C BC are both
equal to w Cx Cy Cz, so they are equal to each other.
To prove the converse, suppose ABCD is a convex quadrilateral in which AB C
CD D AD C BC.
On the one hand, if AB D BC, then the hypothesis implies that
CD D AD as well, so ABCD is a kite and thus is tangential by Lemma 14.37. On the
other hand, suppose AB ¤ BC. Renaming the vertices if necessary, we may assume
that AB > BC. The hypothesis implies AD  CD D AB  BC > 0, so it follows that
AD > CD as well.

in the interior of AD such that DF D DC (see Fig. 14.32(a)). The fact that AB BC D
AD CD together with the betweenness theorem for points implies that AF D AE also.
Thus 4BCE, 4DCF , and 4AFE are all isosceles triangles. It follows from Theorem
7.6 that in each of these isosceles triangles, the altitude to the base is contained in both the
perpendicular bisector of the base and the bisector of the angle opposite the base. Thus
the bisectors of †A, †B, and †D are contained in the perpendicular bisectors of the three
sides of 4EFC (see Fig. 14.32(b)). Because the perpendicular bisectors of the sides of a
triangle are all concurrent (by Corollary 14.26), these three lines all intersect at a point O.

We need to check that O lies on each of the angle bisectors themselves and not their
opposite rays. This is where the assumption of convexity comes in. Because ABCD is
convex, both rays

AD and
!
BC lie on the same side of

AB . The bisectors of †A and †B
make acute angles with
!

BA, respectively (because their measures are one-half of
the measures of proper angles), so Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate shows that the lines containing
those rays intersect on the same side of
 !
AB as the points C and D, and thus the intersection
point O lies on the bisectors of †A and †B. A similar argument starting with
 !
DA shows
that O lies on the bisector of †D. It remains only to show that O also lies on the bisector
of †C.
The angle bisector theorem shows that O is equidistant from

D because AD and BC are semiparallel. A similar argument shows that O is on the
same side of

CD as B. Thus O 2 Int†C, so it lies on the bisector of †C by the partial
converse to the angle bisector theorem. It follows from the incircle theorem that ABCD is
tangential.
□
Regular Polygons and Circles
There is a close relationship between regular polygons and circles. The next theorem shows
why.
Theorem 14.39. Every regular polygon is both cyclic and tangential, and its incenter is
equal to its circumcenter.
Proof. Exercise 14T.
□
If P is a regular polygon, the point O that is both the incenter and circumcenter is
called the center of P . Any angle of the form †AOB, where A and B are consecutive
vertices of P , is called a central angle of P ; it is a central angle of both the inscribed and
circumscribed circles.
Theorem 14.40 (Central Angles of a Regular Polygon). Every central angle of a regular
n-gon has measure 360ı=n.
Proof. Let P be a regular n-gon, let O be its center, and let C be its circumcircle. Let
A;B;C be any three consecutive vertices of P , and draw OA, OB, and OC. Label †1
through †4 as shown in Fig. 14.33.
The isosceles triangles 4AOB and 4BOC are congruent to each other by SSS, and
thus the base angles †1, †2, †3, and †4 are all congruent. Because O is in the interior of
P (since O is also the circumcenter of P ), it follows that

Fig. 14.33. A regular polygon inscribed in a circle.
So far, all of our theorems about inscribed and circumscribed polygons have started
with a given polygon and asked whether there was a circle inscribed in it or circumscribed
about it. Now we reverse the process: we start with a given circle and look for regular
polygons that can be inscribed in it or circumscribed about it. The next lemma simpliﬁes
the process of proving that an inscribed polygon is regular.
Lemma 14.41. Every equilateral polygon inscribed in a circle is regular.
Proof. Suppose P is an equilateral polygon inscribed in a circle C (see Fig. 14.33 again,
but now we are assuming only that P is equilateral, not necessarily regular). Then P is
convex by Theorem 14.23, so we need only prove it is equiangular. Let O be the center of
C, and let A;B;C be any three consecutive vertices of P . Label †1 through †4 as in the
preceding proof. Then as before, 4AOB Š 4BOC by SSS, so †1 Š †2 Š †3 Š †4.
Let ˇ denote the common measure of these angles.
The vertices A and C must be on opposite sides of
 !
OB , because otherwise they would
have to coincide with each other by the unique triangle theorem. Thus †2 and †3 are
adjacent angles. Because they are base angles of isosceles triangles, they are both acute,
so it follows from the adjacency lemma that m†ABC D m†2Cm†3 D 2ˇ.
Now, the same argument applies to any three consecutive vertices of P ; since all of the
vertices are equidistant from O and all of the sides of P are congruent, all of the triangles
formed by O and two consecutive vertices are congruent to each other. Thus all of the
base angles of these triangles have measure ˇ, and so each angle of P has measure 2ˇ. It
follows that P is equiangular and thus regular.
□
Theorem 14.42. Suppose C is a circle, n is an integer greater than or equal to 3, and P
is any point on C. Then there is a regular n-gon inscribed in C that has P as one of its
vertices.
Proof. We consider two cases, depending on whether n is even or odd. First suppose n is
even, and write n D 2k with k an integer greater than 1. Let O be the center of C, let Q
be the point on C such that Q O P , and denote the two sides of
 !
OP by S1 and S2. Let

!
ri be the ray starting at O on side S1 that makes
an angle with
!
OP of measure i, and let
!
si be the ray starting at O on side S2 that makes
the same angle measure with
!
OP . Let Ai be the point where
!
ri meets C, and let Bi be the
point where
!
si meets C (Fig. 14.34(a)). Then P D PA1A2 :::Ak1QBk1 :::B2B1 is an
n-gon inscribed in C. We will show that it is a regular n-gon.

consecutive vertices of P is an isosceles triangle with angle  at O, so all n triangles are
congruent to each other. This implies immediately that P is equilateral.
In case n is odd, the argument must be modiﬁed in the following ways. First, write
n D 2k  1 for some integer k > 1, and write  D 360=n. Then deﬁne A1;:::;Ak1 and
B1;:::;Bk1 exactly as before, and let P D PA1A2 :::Ak1Bk1 :::B2B1 (Fig. 14.34(b)).
The same argument shows that all of the triangles formed by O and two consecutive
vertices of P are congruent, except that we need a special argument for the triangle
Ak1OBk1. In this case, it is easy to check that the three rays

Chapter 15
Circumference and
Circular Area
You undoubtedly have a sense of what it means to measure or compute the circumference
of a circle: intuitively, it is the length of a string that would be required to wrap once around
the circle, or the distance the circle would roll on a ﬂat surface between successive times
when a given point on the circle touches the ground. Similarly, it is intuitively clear that
a circular region (that is, a circle together with its interior) should, like polygonal regions,
have a well-deﬁned area, expressing how much of the plane is included inside the circle.
In the context of our axiomatic system, however, our theories of length and area are
not yet equipped to make sense of the circumference or area of a circle. The length of a
segment is deﬁned to be the distance between its endpoints, but that deﬁnition does not
give us any help in deciding how to assign a length to a circle. Also, the area postulate
guarantees that every polygonal region has a well-deﬁned area, but that does not permit us
to assign areas to sets with other sorts of boundaries such as circles. We have to introduce
new deﬁnitions for these concepts.
The problem of ﬁnding relationships among the radius, circumference, and area of a
circle is among the oldest in geometry. Euclid, to be sure, included very few propositions
about circumferences and areas of circles (Propositions III.30 and XII.2, for example).
But the subject was brought to dramatic fruition by the work of the brilliant Greek mathe-
matician Archimedes of Syracuse (ca. 287 BCE–212 BCE). Archimedes used a technique
called the method of exhaustion to derive the relationship between areas of circles and their
circumferences (see [Arc02] or [Arc97] for Heath’s translation of Archimedes’ work). In
this chapter, we present modern deﬁnitions of circumferences and circular areas that are di-
rectly inspired by the work of Archimedes, and our proofs of the main theorems are based
directly on his.

15. Circumference and Circular Area
Circumference
Archimedes approximated circumferences of circles by inscribing regular polygons in
them and increasing the number of sides to get better and better approximations. This
idea is at the root of our modern deﬁnition of circumference and arc length, but we will
extend it by considering all inscribed polygons rather than just regular ones.
First we recall some fundamental properties of the real numbers. (See Appendix H.)
If S is a set of real numbers, an upper bound for S is a real number b such that b  x for
every x 2 S. (An upper bound might be an element of S or it might not be.) A number b is
called a least upper bound for S if b is an upper bound and if in addition no number less
than b is also an upper bound. For example, if S is the closed interval Œ0;1, then 2 is an
upper bound, while 1 is the least upper bound. If T is the set of all negative real numbers,
then every nonnegative number is an upper bound, and 0 is the least upper bound. On the
other hand, some sets of real numbers, such as the set of integers, have no upper bounds,
and therefore no least upper bounds.
One of the most important properties of the real numbers is the least upper bound
property: if S is any nonempty set of real numbers and S has an upper bound, then S
has a unique least upper bound. The least upper bound of a set S is also called its supre-
mum and is often denoted by supS. We will use the least upper bound property to deﬁne
circumferences and areas of circles.
Let C be a circle. Following Archimedes, we would like to consider inscribed poly-
gons as reasonable approximations to C. Intuitively, it appears that the perimeter of any
inscribed polygon should be strictly less than the circumference of C, and as we choose
polygons with more and smaller sides, we expect to be able to make their perimeters as
close as we like to the circumference of C. Physically, this corresponds to ﬁnding an ap-
proximate measure for the circumference by measuring distances between closely spaced
points on the circle and adding them up.
All of this is just vague intuition so far, because we do not have a mathematical deﬁ-
nition of circumference. But it suggests what the ofﬁcial deﬁnition should be. Suppose C
is a circle. We wish to deﬁne the circumference of C to be the least upper bound of the set
of perimeters of all polygons inscribed in C. In order for this deﬁnition to make sense, we
need to show that this set is nonempty and has an upper bound. It is certainly nonempty,
because if we choose any three distinct points A;B;C 2 C, then 4ABC is inscribed in C.
Before we prove that it has an upper bound, we need to prove a couple of lemmas that
will be useful several times throughout the chapter.
Lemma 15.1. Suppose C is a circle. Given any polygon inscribed in C, there is an-
other inscribed polygon with larger perimeter and larger area; and given any polygon
circumscribed about C, there is another circumscribed polygon with smaller perimeter
and smaller area.
Proof. First suppose P D A1A2 :::An is inscribed in C. The line
 !
A1A2 cuts C into two
arcs by Theorem 14.13, one that is on the P -side of the line and one that is not. Let C
be any point in the interior of the arc on the non-P -side, and let P 0 D A1CA2 :::An (Fig.
15.1). By our choice of C, neither A1C nor CA2 can intersect any edge of P except at A1
and A2, so P 0 is a polygon. Because it is inscribed in C, it is convex.

Circumference
281
To see that perim.P 0/ > perim.P /, note that both polygons share the same edges,
except that P 0 has the two edges A1C and CA2 where P has only A1A2. Since A1A2 <
A1C CCA2 by the triangle inequality, the result follows. To see that ˛.P 0/ > ˛.P /, note
that A1A2 is a chord of P 0, so the convex decomposition lemma gives
˛.P 0/ D ˛.P /C˛.4A1A2C/ > ˛.P /:

Next consider a circumscribed polygon Q D B1B2 :::Bn, and let O be the center of
C. The ray
!
OB2 meets C at a point F . Since B2 2 ExtC, it follows that O F B2. Let m
be the line perpendicular to
 !
OB2 at F . Then m is tangent to C by the tangent line theorem.
Because †B1B2O is acute (since its measure is half that of the proper angle †B1B2B3
by Theorem 14.18), Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate guarantees that m meets
!
B2B1 at a point C on
the same side of
 !
B2O as B1. Since B2 is on the opposite side of m from points of C by
Theorem 14.9, it follows that C is in the interior of B1B2. Similarly, there is a point D on
the other side of
 !
B2O where m meets IntB2B3. Deﬁne Q0 D B1CDB3 :::Bn. It follows
from Lemma 14.30 that CD does not meet any of the edges of Q except at its endpoints,
so Q0 is a polygon. The new edge CD is tangent to C by construction, as are all of the
original edges of Q. Because the point of tangency of B1B2 lies on the opposite side of m
from B2, it follows that B1C is tangent to C, and the same argument shows that DB3 is
also tangent. Thus Q0 is a polygon circumscribed about C.
Next we verify that the perimeter of Q0 is smaller than that of Q. We have
perim.Q/ D B1B2 CB2B3 CCBnB1;
perim.Q0/ D B1C CCD CDB3 CCBnB1:
(15.2)
By the triangle inequality, CD < CB2 C B2D. Because C and D are interior points of
B1B2 and B2B3, respectively, the triangle inequality and the betweenness theorem for
points imply
B1C CCD CDB3 < B1C CCB2 CB2D CDB3 D B1B2 CB2B3:
Substituting this into (15.2), we see that perim.Q0/ < perim.Q/.
Finally, because CD is a chord of the convex polygon Q, the convex decomposition
lemma gives
˛.Q/ D ˛.Q0/C˛.4B2CD/ > ˛.Q0/:

The next lemma is a slight reﬁnement of the preceding one for inscribed polygons.
Lemma 15.2. Suppose C is a circle with center O, and P is a polygon inscribed in C
such that O … IntP . Then there is another polygon P 0 inscribed in C that has larger area
and perimeter than P and that satisﬁes O 2 IntP 0.

Fig. 15.3. Proof of Lemma 15.2.
Proof. The assumption that O … IntP means that there is at least one edge of P such that
O is either on the edge or on the side opposite the P -side of the edge (Fig. 15.3). Label
the vertices of P as A1 :::An in such a way that A1A2 is the edge in question. Let m
be the perpendicular bisector of A1A2; then m contains O by Theorem 14.5. The line m
intersects C exactly twice, once on the P -side of
 !
A1A2 and once on the opposite side. Let
C be the point of intersection that is not on the P -side, and let P 0 D A1CA2 :::An. It
follows just as in the preceding lemma that P 0 is an inscribed polygon with larger area and
perimeter than P .
We need to show that O 2 IntP 0. Note that A1A2 is a chord of P 0. If O 2 A1A2,
then it is in the interior of P 0 by Lemma 8.8. On the other hand, suppose O … A1A2.
Because O lies on the bisector of †A1CA2 (by the isosceles triangle altitude theorem), it
is in the interior of that angle, so it is on the same side of
 !
A1C as A2 and on the same
side of
 !
A2C as A1; in addition, it is on the same side of
 !
A1A2 as C by construction.
Thus it is in the interior of 4A1A2C. By the convex decomposition lemma, RegP 0 D
RegP [Reg4A1A2C, so O 2 RegP 0. Since O does not lie on P 0 itself, it follows that
O 2 IntP 0.
□
Now we can prove that the set of perimeters of inscribed polygons has an upper bound.
It turns out that the perimeter of any circumscribed polygon will do. The next proof is rated
PG.
Theorem 15.3. The perimeter of every polygon circumscribed about a circle is strictly
larger than the perimeter of every polygon inscribed in the same circle.
Proof. Let C D C.O;r/ be a circle. Suppose P D A1 :::An is an inscribed polygon in C
and Q D B1 :::Bm is a circumscribed one. It follows from Corollary 14.32 that O is an
interior point of Q. It might or might not be an interior point of P , but for starters, let us
assume that it is. (We’ll show how to remove this assumption later.) Thus each ray starting
at O intersects P and Q exactly once each by Corollary 8.16.
For each vertex Ai of P , let Ci denote the point where
!
OAi meets Q (see Fig. 15.4).
Suppose Ai and AiC1 are consecutive vertices of P (with AnC1 interpreted to mean A1),


284
15. Circumference and Circular Area
CASE 1: Ci D Ai and CiC1 D AiC1. In this case, there must be at least one vertex
Bj0 2 Int†CiOCiC1 that does not lie on AiAiC1, for otherwise the chord AiAiC1 would
be contained in Q, which is impossible because a circumscribed polygon contains no in-
terior points of the circle. Using ﬁrst the ordinary triangle inequality and then the general
triangle inequality, we obtain
AiAiC1 D CiCiC1 < CiBj0 CBj0CiC1  bi:
In all of the remaining cases, we can assume that either Ci ¤ Ai or CiC1 ¤ AiC1;
without loss of generality, let us say it is the latter. In these cases, the general triangle
inequality yields CiCiC1  bi, so by transitivity it sufﬁces to show that AiAiC1 < CiCiC1.
Note that OAi D OAiC1 D r because both Ai and AiC1 lie on C, and that OCiC1 > OAiC1
and OCi  OAi because no point of Q is in the interior of C.
CASE 2: Ci D Ai but CiC1 ¤ AiC1. Because †OAiC1Ai is one of the base angles of
the isosceles triangle AiOAiC1, it is acute, and therefore †AiAiC1CiC1 is obtuse, so it is
the largest angle in 4AiAiC1CiC1. By the scalene inequality,
AiAiC1 < AiCiC1 D CiCiC1  bi:
CASE 3: Ci ¤ Ai, CiC1 ¤ AiC1, and OCi D OCiC1. In this case, 4AiOAiC1 
4CiOCiC1 by the SAS similarity theorem. Thus AiAiC1=CiCiC1 D OAiC1=OCiC1 < 1,
so
AiAiC1 < CiCiC1  bi:
CASE 4: Ci ¤ Ai, CiC1 ¤ AiC1, and OCi ¤ OCiC1. Without loss of generality, we
can assume that OCiC1 > OCi. Let P be the point on OCiC1 such that OP D OCi. Then
the argument of Case 2 shows that AiAiC1 < CiP , and the argument of Case 3 shows that
CiP < CiCiC1. Thus
AiAiC1 < CiP < CiCiC1  bi:
This completes the proof under the assumption that O 2 IntP .
Finally, we have to consider the possibility that O … IntP . Lemma 15.2 shows that
there is another inscribed polygon P 0 that has larger perimeter than P and such that O 2
IntP 0; then the preceding argument applied to P 0 shows that
perim.P / < perim.P 0/ < perim.Q/;
so the theorem is true in this case as well.
□
Theorem 15.3 shows that the perimeter of any circumscribed polygon is an upper
bound for the set of perimeters of inscribed polygons. Now we can give the ofﬁcial deﬁni-
tion of the circumference of a circle. Let C be a circle, and let .C/ be the set of perimeters
of all polygons inscribed in C. The circumference of C, denoted by circum.C/, is deﬁned
as the least upper bound of the set .C/. Because this set is nonempty and has an upper
bound, circum.C/ is a well-deﬁned real number.
The following corollary is a useful tool for estimating circumferences.
Corollary 15.4. Let C be a circle. If P is any polygon inscribed in C and Q is any polygon
circumscribed about C, then
perim.P / < circum.C/ < perim.Q/:

Approximations by Regular Polygons
285
Proof. Since circum.C/ is deﬁned as the least upper bound of the set .C/ and perim.P /
is an element of this set, perim.P /  circum.C/. Similarly, since perim.Q/ is an up-
per bound for .C/ by Theorem 15.3 and circum.C/ is the least upper bound, we have
circum.C/  perim.Q/.
To show that both of the inequalities are strict, we must show that neither perim.P /
nor perim.Q/ can be equal to the least upper bound of .C/. Lemma 15.1 shows that there
is another inscribed polygon P 0 whose perimeter is larger than that of P ; thus perim.P /
is not an upper bound for .C/, so it cannot be equal to circum.C/. Similarly, the same
lemma shows that there is another circumscribed polygon Q0 with perim.Q0/ < perim.Q/.
Theorem 15.3 shows that perim.Q0/ is also an upper bound for .C/, so perim.Q/ cannot
be equal to the least upper bound circum.C/.
□
Approximations by Regular Polygons
Although the deﬁnition of circumference is phrased in terms of arbitrary inscribed poly-
gons, for many computational and theoretical purposes it is useful to restrict our attention
to regular polygons as Archimedes did. Theorem 14.42 shows that they are abundant.
Recall that Corollary 14.32 showed that the interior of the inscribed circle is entirely
contained in the interior of a circumscribed polygon. This is certainly not the case for
inscribed polygons, as simple examples show. But for regular inscribed polygons, the
center of the circle, at least, is an interior point, because it is the same as the center of the
circumscribed circle by Theorem 14.39.
We will show below that perimeters of inscribed regular polygons are sufﬁcient to
determine the circumference of a circle. The key is the following theorem, which shows
that perimeters of inscribed and circumscribed regular polygons get closer and closer to
each other as the number of sides increases. This proof is rated R.
Theorem 15.5. Suppose C is a circle of radius r, P is a regular n-gon inscribed in C,
and Q is a regular n-gon circumscribed about C, with n  12. Then
perim.Q/perim.P / < 800r
n2 :
Proof. Let O be the center of C. By replacing Q with another circumscribed regular n-
gon congruent to the ﬁrst, we may assume that each ray starting at O and passing through
a vertex of P also contains a vertex of Q. Let A and A0 be two consecutive vertices of
P , and let B and B0 be the vertices of Q on the same rays. Let F be the foot of the
perpendicular from O to BB0, and let G be the point where OF meets AA0 (Fig. 15.6).
Note that 4OAG and 4OBF are similar right triangles (by AA) and OA and OF have
length r because they are both radii of C. If we set ˛ D 360ı=.2n/, then m†AOG D ˛.
Deﬁne the following lengths:
a D AG;
b D BF;
c D FG:
Then

Next, because OG=OF < 1, similarity shows that AG=BF < 1, or
a < b:
(15.5)
The Pythagorean theorem applied to 4OAG yields .r  c/2 C a2 D r2, which simpliﬁes
to 2rc D a2 Cc2. With (15.4) and (15.5), this implies 2rc D a2 Cc2 < 2a2 < 2b2, or

The estimate given by this theorem is not very useful for practical computations, be-
cause it is necessary to use a very large value of n in order to counteract the effect of the
800 in the numerator. But by judiciously choosing the number of sides of the polygon, it is
possible to derive much more accurate estimates of the circumference. For example, if n is
a multiple of 6, then the estimate (15.9) can be replaced by k D n=6, which has the effect
of replacing 123 in (15.12) by 63, thus yielding a ﬁnal error bound of 100r=n2 instead of
800r=n2.
The main signiﬁcance of Theorem 15.5 is theoretical: it guarantees we can make the
difference between the perimeter of P and the circumference of C as small as we wish by

taking n large enough. One consequence of this is that we can express the circumference
as a limit, as the following corollary shows.

Proof. Let C D C.O;r/ and C0 D C.O0;r0/ be two circles. Suppose Pn is a regular n-
gon inscribed in C and P 0
n is a regular n-gon inscribed in C0 (Fig. 15.8). Let A;B denote
any two consecutive vertices of Pn, and let A0;B0 denote any two consecutive vertices
of P 0
n. The central angles †AOB and A0O0B0 both measure 360ı=n by Theorem 14.40.
Since OA=O0A0 D OB=O0B0 D r=r0, it follows from the SAS similarity theorem that

follows that Pn and P 0
n are similar with scale factor r=r0, and therefore by Theorem 12.16,
their perimeters have the same ratio. Thus by Corollary 15.6, we have

Suppose C.O;r/ and C.O0;r0/ are any two circles, and denote their circumferences
by C and C 0, respectively. The preceding theorem shows that C 0=C D r0=r, which is
equivalent to C=r D C 0=r0. Since this is true for any two circles, it follows that the ratio
of circumference to radius is the same number for all circles. Since the diameter of every
circle is twice its radius by Lemma 14.1, it also follows that the ratio of circumference to
diameter is the same for all circles: C=d D C=.2r/ D C 0=.2r0/ D C 0=d 0. This common
ratio of circumference to diameter is a positive real number called pi and denoted by .
Corollary 15.8 (Circumference of a Circle). The circumference of a circle of radius r is
2r.
Proof. Let C be a circle of radius r, and let d denote its diameter and C its circumference.
Then the deﬁnition of  gives  D C=d, so C D d D 2r.
□
In particular, if C is a circle of radius 1 (called a unit circle), the preceding corollary
shows that its circumference is exactly 2.
Approximations of 
The preceding discussion established a theoretical deﬁnition of , but it did not give
us any idea of its value. It was proved by Johann Lambert in the eighteenth century that 
is an irrational number, so to evaluate it numerically, the best we can hope for is an approx-
imation. The key to estimating it is the following corollary, which follows immediately
from Corollary 15.4.
Corollary 15.9. Let C be a unit circle. If P is any polygon inscribed in C and Q is any
polygon circumscribed about C, then
1
2 perim.P /    1
2 perim.Q/:

We can use this idea to give a very rough approximation to .
Theorem 15.10. 3 <  < 4.
Proof. Let C be a unit circle, and let P be an inscribed regular hexagon and Q a circum-
scribed square (see Fig. 15.9). Then an easy argument shows that the perimeter of P is
exactly 6 and that of Q is 8. The result follows from Corollary 15.9.
□
Of course, by examining polygons with more sides, we can do much better than this
crude estimate. By using inscribed and circumscribed regular 96-gons together with some
amazingly ingenious rational approximations to square roots, Archimedes [Arc97,Arc02]
was able to prove that the ratio of circumference to diameter lies strictly between 3 10

and 3 1
7, which yields 3:1408 <  < 3:1429. (It is important to note that Archimedes did
not consider  to be an exact number, but he considered circumferences and diameters
to be “magnitudes” in the same sense that Euclid used the word, and it made sense to
compare ratios of two magnitudes to ratios of other magnitudes. This is the sense in which
Archimedes’ results can be considered as approximations to .)
Since that time, many innovative geometric and analytic methods for estimating 
have been devised, and although it is hard to imagine a practical use for any accuracy
beyond one or two dozen decimal digits (  3:141592653589793238462643:::), setting
new accuracy records in the calculation has become a popular way to test the limits of
computing power. As of mid-2012,  has been calculated to an accuracy of 10 trillion
(1013) decimal digits.
The ﬁrst use of the symbol  in this context was in the eighteenth century, and it caught
on quickly after that. It is unfortunate, though, that the eighteenth-century authors chose
to give a name to the ratio of circumference to diameter, because in many ways the more
fundamental ratio is that of circumference to radius, or 2. In many, many mathematical
formulas, from geometry to trigonometry to complex analysis to probability to Fourier
analysis,  occurs almost exclusively in the combination 2. Several mathematicians have
argued recently for the introduction of a new fundamental circle constant,  (the Greek
letter tau, representing “one turn”), which is equal to 2 and represents the circumference
of a unit circle (see [Har12] for an eloquent defense of the proposal). The idea makes good
logical and pedagogical sense, but centuries-old mathematical customs are hard to change.
Area of a Circular Region
A circular region is the union of a circle and its interior. If C is a circle, the region
consisting of C and its interior is called the circular region bounded by C and is denoted
by RegC. In order to speak of the area of a circular region, we need a new deﬁnition,
analogous to the deﬁnition of circumference. If C is any circle, we wish to deﬁne the area
of RegC to be the least upper bound of the set of areas of inscribed polygons. To verify
that this is well deﬁned, we need to show that the set of such areas is nonempty and has
an upper bound. It is certainly nonempty, because there are inscribed polygons. The next
theorem shows that the area of any circumscribed polygon will serve as an upper bound.
Theorem 15.11. Let C be a circle, let P be a polygon inscribed in C, and let Q be a
polygon circumscribed about C. Then ˛.Q/ > ˛.P /.

Area of a Circular Region
291
Proof. Write P D A1 :::An and Q D B1 :::Bm as in the proof of Theorem 15.3. As we did
in that proof, we begin by assuming that O lies in the interior of P . For each i D 1;:::;n,
let Ci be the point where
!
OAi meets Q. Let Pi D 4AiOAiC1, and let Qi be the polygon
formed by OCi, OCiC1, and the portion of Q in the interior of †CiOCiC1. Then the
pizza lemma (Lemma 11.2) shows that
˛.P / D ˛.P1/CC˛.Pn/;
˛.Q/ D ˛.Q1/CC˛.Qn/:
(15.13)
For each i, the segment AiAiC1 is a chord of the convex polygon Qi, and one of the
polygons in the admissible decomposition of Qi that it deﬁnes is exactly Pi. If we let Q0
i
denote the other, then the convex decomposition lemma gives
˛.Qi/ D ˛.Pi/C˛.Q0
i/ > ˛.Pi/:
Inserting this into (15.13) shows that ˛.Q/ > ˛.P / as claimed.
If O … IntP , Lemma 15.2 shows that we can ﬁnd an inscribed polygon P 0 that has O
in its interior and satisﬁes ˛.P 0/ > ˛.P /. The argument in the preceding paragraph then
applies to P 0, and we conclude that ˛.Q/ > ˛.P 0/ > ˛.P /.
□
Because of the preceding theorem, for any circle C, we can deﬁne the area of RegC
to be the least upper bound of the set of areas of inscribed polygons. This approach, ﬁrst
introduced by the ancient Greeks and developed to a high art by Archimedes, is known
as the method of exhaustion, because as we consider inscribed polygons with more and
smaller sides, their areas eventually use up, or “exhaust,” all of the available space inside
the circle.
As we do for polygons, for simplicity we often refer to the “area of C,” denoted by
˛.C/, with the understanding that this means the area of the circular region bounded by C.
The next three results are the analogues for areas of Theorem 15.5, Corollary 15.6,
and Theorem 15.7.
Theorem 15.12. Suppose C is a circle of radius r, P is a regular n-gon inscribed in C,
and Q is a regular n-gon circumscribed about C, with n  12. Then
˛.Q/˛.P / < 800r2
n2
:
Proof. We use the same notation as in the proof of Theorem 15.5. From the pizza lemma,
it follows that the areas of P and Q can be computed by summing the areas of n isosceles
triangles, each of which shares two consecutive vertices with P or Q and has its other
vertex at O. Referring to Fig. 15.6, we see that each of the triangles in Q has a base of
length 2b and height r, while each one in P has a base of length 2a and height r c. Thus
˛.Q/ D n 1
2.2b/r D nbr;
˛.P / D n 1
2.2a/.r c/ D nar nac;
from which it follows that

Corollary 15.13. Let C be a circle, and for each n  3, let Pn be a regular n-gon inscribed

Proof. This follows exactly as in the proof of Corollary 15.6.
□
Now that we have deﬁned the area of a circle, we need to ﬁgure out how to compute
it. The key insight is the following beautiful theorem ﬁrst proved by Archimedes. The
geometric idea of the proof is illustrated in Fig. 15.10: when n is even, the area of an
inscribed regular n-gon is equal to the area of a certain parallelogram whose base is half
the perimeter of the polygon and whose height is slightly less than the radius of the circle.
(When n is odd, the parallelogram is replaced by a trapezoid whose two bases have lengths
that add up to the perimeter.) As the number of sides increases, the base approaches half
the circumference of the circle, and the height approaches the radius. The proof of the
theorem is a more algebraic version of the same idea.

Theorem 15.14 (Archimedes’ Theorem). For any circle C of radius r,

(15.15)
Proof. Let C be a circle of radius r, and let Pn be an inscribed regular n-gon. As in the
proof of Theorem 15.12, the area of Pn is the sum of the areas of n isosceles triangles, each
of which has base of length 2a and height r c, with a and c as in the proof of Theorem
15.5. Therefore ˛.Pn/ D 1

Generalizations
The approach we used for deﬁning the area of a circle as the least upper bound of areas
of inscribed polygons can easily be adapted to other closed curves such as ellipses or to
ﬁgures bounded by combinations of curves and line segments such as the region between
a parabola and a line. Archimedes was able to compute many such areas by adapting the
method of exhaustion. However, for each different type of ﬁgure, new tricks and insights
are needed for simplifying the formulas and computing the appropriate limits, so this ap-
proach is only applicable to rather special regions. Exercise 15C outlines the results for
sectors of circles (regions bounded by two radii and an arc). With the development of in-
tegral calculus in the seventeenth century, the method of exhaustion was systematized and
developed into a method for computing areas of very general ﬁgures.
Generalizing the circumference of a circle turns out to be a little trickier. For closed
curves that bound convex regions, such as ellipses, circumference can be deﬁned in a
manner very similar to our deﬁnition of circumference of a circle, as the least upper bound
of the perimeters of inscribed polygons. However, for curves that are not convex, this
method does not work because perimeters of inscribed polygons can actually be longer
than the curves they are meant to approximate. And for nonclosed curves such as arcs of
circles or portions of parabolas, inscribed polygons do not even make sense.
It is possible to develop a theory of length for more or less arbitrary curves in the
plane by approximating them with polygonal paths and taking limits in a suitable sense,
but the details are tricky. This is exactly how lengths of curves are deﬁned in calculus, and
the deﬁnition leads to the familiar formula for arc length that is studied in multivariable
calculus courses.

Chapter 16
Compass and Straightedge
Constructions
A prominent theme in the history of Euclidean geometry is the construction of geometric
ﬁgures using and straightedge. As we remarked in Chapter 1, Euclid based his ﬁrst three
postulates on the types of ﬁgures (circles and lines) that can be constructed using a col-
lapsible compass and an unmarked straightedge. A substantial number of propositions in
the Elements are solutions to construction problems. As a result, a favorite preoccupation
of geometers since Euclid has been searching for ways to construct new ﬁgures.
Constructions played a vital role in Greek mathematics because for the ancient Greeks,
the only way to assert that a mathematical object (such as a particular equilateral triangle,
square, or angle bisector) exists was to give an algorithm for constructing it. In our modern
axiomatic approach to geometry, we have not placed a similar emphasis on constructions
because our modern understanding of the axiomatic method gives us a different way of jus-
tifying the existence of mathematical objects: the existence of certain objects is explicitly
stated in the postulates, and the existence of others can then be derived from those.
Compass and straightedge constructions should not be confused with the types of the-
orems that we have called “construction theorems,” such as the angle construction theorem
(Theorem 4.5) and the SSS construction theorem (Corollary 13.7). Those theorems merely
assert the existence of certain geometric objects, but they are mute on the question of how
those objects might be constructed by hand. By contrast, every compass and straightedge
construction theorem describes an algorithm for producing a particular geometric ﬁgure
while following the strict limitations imposed by Euclid’s ﬁrst three postulates.
Many clever and useful constructions are described in the Elements, including ones
involving triangles, quadrilaterals, parallel lines, areas, circles, and inscribed and circum-
scribed polygons. Many of these constructions are suitable for high-school students and
offer opportunities for deepening one’s understanding of fundamental geometric relation-
ships. These techniques of construction are also useful in practical settings such as drafting
or navigation or whenever computer graphics are unavailable or impractical.

16. Compass and Straightedge Constructions
In this chapter, we can introduce only a selected sampling of constructions, to illustrate
how they can be solved within the context of our modern axiomatic system. Many of the
constructions are easier to do than to read, so after the ﬁrst few we leave many of them to
the reader as exercises.
At the end of the chapter, we address one of the most important issues in the history of
geometric constructions: the fact that some construction problems are impossible to solve
using only compass and straightedge.
Basic Constructions
We begin with a careful description of what is meant by compass and straightedge con-
structions in Euclidean geometry. The following operations, based on Euclid’s ﬁrst three
postulates, are allowed:
 Given two distinct points A;B, construct the line segment AB.
 Given a line segment in the plane, extend it in either direction to form a line segment
longer than any predetermined length.
 Given two distinct points in the plane, construct the circle centered at the ﬁrst point
and passing through the second point.
In addition, although they are not mentioned in Euclid’s postulates, the following opera-
tions are allowable in compass and straightedge constructions:
 Given two nonparallel lines, locate the point where they intersect.
 Given a circle and a secant line, locate the two points where they intersect.
 Given two nontangential circles, locate the points (if any) where they intersect.
All other constructions (such as cutting off a portion of a longer line segment congruent
to a shorter one or bisecting an angle) must be built up out of these basic operations.
Throughout this chapter, we assume all the postulates of Euclidean geometry.
As we mentioned in the introduction, Euclid begins Book I with the solution to a
construction problem (Proposition I.1). We begin in the same place.
Construction Problem 16.1 (Equilateral Triangle on a Given Segment). Given a seg-
ment AB and a side of
 !
AB , construct a point C on the chosen side such that 4ABC is
equilateral.

Solution. Given AB and CD satisfying the hypothesis, by the preceding construction we
can ﬁnd a point X such that CX Š AB (see Fig. 16.3). Draw the circle C with center C
and passing through X, and let E be the point where C meets the interior of CD. (To see
that there is such a point, note that
!
CD contains a point on C by the segment construction
theorem and this point lies in the interior of CD because CD is larger than the radius of
C.) Then AB Š CX by construction, and CX Š CE because they are both radii of C.
Thus AB Š CE by transitivity.
□
This justiﬁes what we regularly do with a physical (noncollapsing) compass: opening
the compass to the length of a given line segment, lifting the compass off the paper, and
using it to mark off a segment of the given length on a longer line segment somewhere else.
The preceding construction shows how to accomplish the same thing with a “collapsing
compass” of the type Euclid’s axioms envision. Henceforth, we will simply refer to this
operation as “cutting off a segment on CD congruent to AB,” with the understanding that
it is justiﬁed by Construction Problem 16.3.
When we use a physical compass to ﬁnd an intersection point between a circle and
a segment or another circle, it is usually unnecessary to draw the entire circle; all that is
needed is a small arc of the circle near the desired intersection point. In order to make
our drawings less cluttered from now on, we will often draw only enough of the circles to
locate the desired points. Similarly, if there are line segments that are needed only to prove
the correctness of a construction but not to complete it, we will indicate them with dashed
lines.
The next construction is Euclid’s Proposition I.9.

bisector.

(Fig. 16.4). Let B be the point where C meets
!s . Now construct a point C on the opposite
side of
 !
AB from O such that 4ABC is equilateral. Draw OC.
We need to show that
!
OC bisects †rs. First, we have to verify that C lies in the
interior of the angle. Note that †OAB is acute (being a base angle of the isosceles triangle
4OAB) and m†CAB D 60ı because 4ABC is equilateral. Because †OAB and †CAB
are adjacent by construction, it follows from the adjacency lemma that
!
AO 
!
AB 
!
AC
and thus that B and C are on the same side of
 !
OA. A similar argument shows that A and
C are on the same side of
 !
OB , and thus C 2 Int†AOB as required.
Finally, we note that 4OAC and 4OBC are congruent by SSS, so m†BOC D
m†AOC, and thus
!
OC is the bisector of †AOB as claimed.
□
The statement of the preceding construction referred to the bisector of an angle as the
object to be constructed. Since a bisector is technically a ray, which is inﬁnitely long, we
cannot of course draw the entire angle bisector. Whenever we talk about “constructing a
ray,” what is really required is to construct enough points to completely determine the ray:
the endpoint and at least one interior point of the ray. Similarly, to “construct a line” means
to construct two points on the line. Once this is done, the rules of compass and straightedge
constructions allow us to draw as much of the ray or line as needed.
We leave the next few elementary constructions as exercises. For some of them, we
have provided diagrams that suggest an approach. For many of them, the proof of the
corresponding existence theorem can easily be adapted to provide a construction algorithm.
If you get stuck, you can always look at the way Euclid performed the same constructions.
When you write up a solution to a construction problem, make sure you include the
following: (a) a careful description of each step of the construction; (b) a justiﬁcation
for the existence of each intersection point unless the justiﬁcation will be obvious to your
reader (for example, no justiﬁcation is needed for locating the intersection point between
two lines that can easily be shown to be nonparallel); (c) a proof that the given construction
does indeed satisfy the required conditions.
The next four constructions are Euclid’s Propositions I.10, I.11, I.12, and I.22, respec-
tively. The ﬁrst one is most commonly used to locate the midpoint of a segment.

segments whose lengths have certain desired ratios. Here we present four of those con-
structions. The ﬁrst two are Euclid’s Propositions VI.9 and VI.10.
Construction Problem 16.15 (Cutting a Segment into n Equal Parts). Given a segment
AB and an integer n  2, construct points C1;:::;Cn1 2 IntAB such that AC1  
Cn1 B and AC1 D C1C2 D  D Cn1B.

Construction Problem 16.16 (Cutting a Segment in a Rational Ratio). Given a segment
AB and a rational number x strictly between 0 and 1, construct a point D 2 IntAB such
that AD D x AB.
Solution.
Because x is rational, we can write x D m=n for some integers m and n with
0 < m < n. Use the previous construction to mark points C1;:::;Cn1 that divide AB
into n equal parts, and then let D be the mth point starting from A. Because the distance
between successive points is .1=n/AB, it follows that AD D .m=n/AB D x AB.

The next construction appears twice in the Elements, once as part of Proposition II.14
and once on its own as Proposition VI.13.
Construction Problem 16.17 (Geometric Mean of Two Segments). Given two segments
AB and CD, construct a third segment that is their geometric mean.
Solution. Exercise 16L. (See Fig. 16.7.)

AB at B, and mark point C on
that line such that BC Š BM (see Fig. 16.8). Draw CA. Because CB < CA, we can draw
the circle C with center C and passing through B, and let D be the point where C meets
IntCA. Then draw the circle D with center A and passing through D, and let E be the
point where D meets

This implies AB=AE D '. Because ' > 1, it follows that AE < AB, and therefore E is
an interior point of AB.
□
Area Constructions
The Elements included a large number of constructions involving areas. Most of these
describe how to construct a polygon of a certain type with the same area as another given
polygon. To illustrate how they work, we present just a few of them here. The ﬁrst is
Euclid’s Proposition I.42.
Construction Problem 16.19 (Parallelogram with the Same Area as a Triangle). Sup-
pose 4ABC is a triangle and †rs is a proper angle. Construct a parallelogram with the
same area as 4ABC and with one of its angles congruent to †rs.
Solution.
Given 4ABC, construct the line ` through A and parallel to
 !
BC (Fig. 16.9).
Construct the ray
!
r0 starting at B, lying on the same side of
 !
BC as A, and making an angle
with
!
BC congruent to †rs. Let D be the point where
!
r0 meets ` (extended if necessary).
Locate the midpoint M of BC, and draw the line m through M and parallel to
 !
r0 . Locate
the point E where m meets `.
Because DE k BM and ME k BD, it follows from the parallelogram lemma that
DEMB is a parallelogram. Its area is equal to .BM/h, where h is the distance between the
lines ` and
 !
BC , while ˛.4ABC/ D 1
2.BC/h, which in turn is equal to .BM/h because
M is the midpoint of BC. The angle †DBM is congruent to †rs by construction.

EY D AD by construction, we conclude that

Recall that Euclid did not use numbers to measure areas; instead, areas were consid-
ered as “magnitudes” (like line segments and angles), which could only be added, sub-
tracted, and compared to other magnitudes of the same type. Thus the closest Euclid could
come to “calculating the area” of a given geometric ﬁgure was to construct a square that
had the same area, a process that is traditionally called “squaring” the ﬁgure. The next two
propositions are special cases of Euclid’s Proposition II.14.
Construction Problem 16.21 (Squaring a Rectangle). Given a rectangle, construct a
square with the same area as the rectangle.
Solution. Exercise 16M.

Fig. 16.11. Squaring a convex polygon.
Proof. Let P be a convex n-gon. Choose a random point in IntP and connect it to each
of the vertices of P , giving an admissible decomposition of P into n triangles T1;:::;Tn
by the pizza lemma (see Fig. 16.11(a)). For each triangle Ti, construct a rectangle Ri
with the same area (Construction Problem 16.19). Next, construct a segment AB, and use
Construction Problem 16.20 to construct a rectangle ABC1D1 with the same area as R1
and with AB as one of its edges. Then construct a second rectangle C1D1D2C2 with the
same area as R2, with C1D1 as one of its edges, and with C2 and D2 on the opposite side
of
 !
C1D1 from AB. Continuing in this way for R3;:::;Rn, we obtain a large rectangle
ABCnCn with the same area as P , as shown in Fig. 16.11(b). Finally, use Construction
Problem 16.21 to construct a square with the same area as the large rectangle.
□
(The full strength of Euclid’s Proposition II.14 applies to arbitrary polygonal regions,
not just convex ones; the only missing ingredient for proving the general case is the fact
that arbitrary polygonal regions admit admissible decompositions into triangular regions,
which we have not proved.)
Our last area construction does not appear explicitly in the Elements, but Euclid could
easily have done it using the theorems he had already proved.

Construction Problem 16.23 (Doubling a Square). Given a square, construct a new
square whose area is twice that of the original one.
Solution. Exercise 16N.
□
Circle Constructions
Many constructions in the Elements involve circles. Here we present just a few of
them. These are Euclid’s Propositions III.1, IV.4, and IV.5.
Construction Problem 16.24 (Center of a Circle). Given a circle, construct its center.
Solution. Exercise 16O.
□
Construction Problem 16.25 (Inscribed Circle). Given a triangle, construct its inscribed
circle.
Solution. Exercise 16P.

Construction Problem 16.26 (Circumscribed Circle). Given a triangle, construct its
circumscribed circle.
Solution. Exercise 16Q.
□
Constructing Regular Polygons
Our last six construction problems all focus on regular polygons inscribed in circles. The-
orem 14.42 showed it is always possible to inscribe a regular polygon with any number of
sides in a circle. However, as we will see, constructing them with compass and straightedge
can be a much more difﬁcult problem.
Our ﬁrst regular polygon construction is Euclid’s Proposition IV.6.
Construction Problem 16.27 (Square Inscribed in a Circle). Given a circle and a point
A on the circle, construct a square inscribed in the circle that has one vertex at A.
A

Solution. Exercise 16R. (See Fig. 16.12.)
□
Next we consider pentagons. The construction of a regular pentagon inscribed in a
circle appears in the Elements as Proposition IV.11 and is one of the gems of Euclidean
geometry. To motivate the construction, consider that the central angles of a regular penta-
gon all measure 72ı, which is twice the measure of the smaller angle of a golden triangle.

306
16. Compass and Straightedge Constructions
Thus it should not be surprising that the following algorithm begins by constructing two
golden triangles.
Construction Problem 16.28 (Regular Pentagon Inscribed in a Circle). Given a circle
and a point A on the circle, construct a regular pentagon inscribed in the circle that has
one vertex at A.

Fig. 16.13. Inscribing a regular pentagon.
Solution. Let C be the given circle and A the given point (Fig. 16.13). Locate the center
O of C. Draw AO, extend it past O, and mark the point P where the extended segment
intersects C. Locate the point G in the interior of PO such that PO=P G is equal to the
golden ratio (Construction Problem 16.18). Draw the circle D with center P and passing
through G, and let C and D be the two points where D intersects C. (These points exist
because C contains the points P 2 IntD and A 2 ExtD.) Then draw the circle with center
C and passing through D, and let B be the other point where this circle meets C; and
similarly, draw the circle with center D and passing through C, and let E be the other
point where this circle meets C. Draw the pentagon ABCDE, which is inscribed in C by
construction.
We will show that ABCDE is equilateral. Note that P C Š P G because both are
radii of the same circle, and similarly OP Š OC. Since PO=P C D PO=P G, which is
the golden ratio, it follows that 4POC is a golden triangle, and thus m†POC D 36ı.
Similarly, m†POD D 36ı. Since D and C lie on opposite sides of
 !
OP by the two circles
theorem, †POC and †POD are adjacent angles, and thus m†COD D 72ı.
Now, 4BOC and 4DOE are both congruent to 4COD by SSS, and therefore
m†BOC D m†DOE D 72ı. The linear triple theorem applied to †AOB, †BOC, and
†COP implies that m†AOB D 72ı, and similarly m†AOE D 72ı; thus 4AOB and
4AOE are both congruent to the three triangles 4BOC, 4COD, and 4DOE by SAS.
It follows that AB D BC D CD D DE D EA, so ABCDE is equilateral, and thus it is
regular by Lemma 14.41.

Next we have Euclid’s Proposition IV.15.

Construction Problem 16.29 (Regular Hexagon Inscribed in a Circle). Given a circle
and a point A on the circle, construct a regular hexagon inscribed in the circle that has
one vertex at A.

The next two constructions do not appear explicitly in the Elements, but they can be
derived easily from other constructions that do appear.
Construction Problem 16.30 (Equilateral Triangle Inscribed in a Circle). Given a cir-
cle and a point A on the circle, construct an equilateral triangle inscribed in the circle that
has one vertex at A.
Solution. Exercise 16U. (See Fig. 16.15.)
□
Construction Problem 16.31 (Regular Octagon Inscribed in a Circle). Given a circle
and a point A on the circle, construct a regular octagon inscribed in the circle that has one
vertex at A.
Solution.
Let C be the circle and let O be its center. First inscribe a square with one
vertex at A, and then bisect each of its central angles and add a new vertex where the
bisector meets C (see Fig. 16.16). Each of the eight resulting central angles has measure
45ı, so all eight triangles formed by O and two consecutive vertices are congruent to each
other. Thus the resulting octagon is equilateral and hence regular.
□
Finally, we have Euclid’s Proposition IV.16.
Construction Problem 16.32 (Regular 15-gon Inscribed in a Circle). Given a circle and
a point A on the circle, construct a regular ﬁfteen-sided polygon inscribed in the circle that
has one vertex at A.
Solution. Exercise 16V. (See Fig. 16.17.)
□
Impossible Constructions
Even though Euclid was able to produce constructions for a great many geometric ﬁgures,
there were a number of seemingly simple construction problems that he was unable to
solve. Four of the most famous are the following:
 TRISECTING AN ANGLE: Given an arbitrary proper angle †ABC, construct an angle
whose measure is 1
3m†ABC.

308
16. Compass and Straightedge Constructions

 DOUBLING A CUBE: Given an arbitrary segment AB, construct a segment CD such
that the cube with side length CD has twice the volume of that with side length AB.
 SQUARING A CIRCLE: Given an arbitrary circle, construct a square with the same
area as the circle.
 CONSTRUCTING A REGULAR HEPTAGON: Given an arbitrary circle C, construct a
regular seven-sided polygon inscribed in C.
During the two millennia after Euclid, many mathematicians strove to ﬁnd algorithms to
solve these construction problems, but no one succeeded. Finally, in the nineteenth century,
mathematicians were able to prove rigorously that none of these construction problems
have solutions in general. (Of course, for some particular starting conﬁgurations, it might
be possible to perform the construction—for example, a 90ı angle can be trisected by ﬁrst
constructing an equilateral triangle and then bisecting one of its angles. But the nineteenth-
century mathematicians showed that there is no general construction algorithm that will
precisely trisect every angle.) In this section, we examine the arguments leading to these
impossibility proofs.
Constructible Points, Lines, Circles, and Numbers
Every construction starts with some given data. For the purpose of proving that some
constructions are impossible, let us assume that to begin with, we are given two points O
and I such that the distance between them is equal to 1. We say that a line, circle, or point
is constructible if it can be produced by a ﬁnite (perhaps empty) sequence of compass and
straightedge construction steps of the six types described at the beginning of this chapter,
starting only with the points O and I. (Whenever it is necessary to choose a “random”
point satisfying certain properties, it is always possible to choose a speciﬁc constructible
point satisfying the desired properties. For example, to choose a random point in the
interior of a segment, you can construct its midpoint. We leave it to you to work out the
details in each speciﬁc case.)
We say that a real number r is a constructible number if there exist a pair of con-
structible points A and B such that AB D jrj. (Thus r is constructible if and only if r is

Impossible Constructions
309
constructible.) Let K denote the set of all constructible numbers. The key to understand-
ing which constructions are impossible is to study the algebraic properties of K. For this
purpose, we need to introduce a few basic concepts from abstract algebra. For much more
detail about the algebraic ideas touched upon here, see any good abstract algebra text, such
as [Her99].
A subset F  R is called a ﬁeld if it contains 0 and 1 and is closed under addition,
subtraction, multiplication, and division by nonzero elements of F . (Algebraists study a
more general notion of ﬁelds that do not need to be subsets of R, but this limited deﬁnition
will be ample for our purposes.) If F1;F2  R are ﬁelds such that F1  F2, then we say
that F1 is a subﬁeld of F2 and that F2 is an extension of F1. For example, two obvious
subﬁelds of R are R itself and the ﬁeld Q of rational numbers. Obviously R is the largest
subﬁeld of R; the next lemma shows that Q is the smallest.
Lemma 16.33. Every subﬁeld of R contains Q.
Proof. Suppose F is a subﬁeld of R. Then by deﬁnition, F contains 0 and 1; and if it
contains a positive integer n, then it contains nC1 because it is closed under addition. Thus
by induction it contains all positive integers. Since it is also closed under subtraction, it also
contains all negative integers, and since it is closed under division by nonzero elements, it
contains all rational numbers.
□
Theorem 16.34. The set K of constructible numbers is a subﬁeld of R.
Proof. It follows from the deﬁnitions that 0 is constructible because OO D 0, and 1 is
constructible because OI D 1. Suppose x and y are constructible numbers. This means
that there are constructible points A;B;C;D such that AB D jxj and CD D jyj (Fig.
16.18). If x D 0, then it is immediate that x Cy, x y, and xy are constructible, as is x=y
provided y ¤ 0; and a similar remark holds if y D 0. So henceforth we assume that both
x and y are nonzero.
To show that x C y is constructible, we need to show how to construct two points
whose distance is jx Cyj. Assume without loss of generality that jyj  jxj. Draw AB and
extend it past B to form a longer segment such that the extended part is longer than CD.
Then by drawing a circle with center B and length CD and marking the two points where
this circle meets the line
 !
AB , we can construct segments of lengths jxjCjyj and jxjjyj.
Since jx Cyj is equal to jxjCjyj when x and y have the same sign and to jxjjyj when
they don’t, this shows that x Cy is constructible. Since x and y are also constructible,
so are x y D x C.y/ and y x D y C.x/.
Next, to show that xy is constructible, we need to show how to construct two points
whose distance is jxyj. First construct a rectangle whose side lengths are jxj and jyj, and
then construct a new rectangle with the same area but with one side of length 1 (Construc-
tion Problem 16.20). The other side has length jxyj as desired. (See Fig. 16.19(a).)
To complete the proof that K is a ﬁeld, we need to show that x=y is constructible.
Construct a rectangle of side lengths jxj and 1, and then construct a new rectangle with the
same area (namely jxj) but with one side of length jyj. The other side of this rectangle has
length jx=yj as desired (Fig. 16.19(b)).
□
Thanks to Theorem 16.34 and Lemma 16.33, every rational number is constructible.
The next theorem shows that K contains more than just the rational numbers.

also that a D 0.

Theorems 16.34 and 16.35 together show that every quadratic extension of Q is con-
tained in K. But more is true: let us say that a subﬁeld F  R is an iterated quadratic
extension of Q if there is a ﬁnite sequence of subﬁelds F0  F1    Fn  R such that
F0 D Q, Fn D F , and each Fi is a quadratic extension of Fi1. It follows immediately
from Theorems 16.34 and 16.35 that every number in an iterated quadratic extension of Q
is constructible.
An important step on the way to the proofs of impossibility of the ancient construc-
tion problems was the realization that the converse is true. The following theorem was
essentially proved by Ren´e Descartes in 1637 [Des54]. Its proof is rated PG.
Theorem 16.38 (Characterization of Constructible Numbers). A real number is con-
structible if and only if it is contained in some iterated quadratic extension of Q.
Proof. As we noted above, Theorems 16.34 and 16.35 imply that every number in an it-
erated quadratic extension of Q is constructible. Thus we need only prove the converse.
Suppose r is a constructible number. This means that there is a ﬁnite sequence of construc-
tion steps starting with two points O and I whose distance is 1 and ending with points P
and Q whose distance is jrj.
The key is to work in the Cartesian model. Using the method described in the proof
of Theorem 13.19, we can deﬁne an isomorphism between the Euclidean plane and the
Cartesian plane that sends O to .0;0/ and I to .1;0/. Each construction step then yields a
certain line, circle, or point in the Cartesian plane. Our plan is to keep careful track of the
ﬁelds containing the coordinates of all points that we produce along the way.
Suppose F is any subﬁeld of R. Let us say that a point .x;y/ in the Cartesian plane is
an F -point if both x and y are elements of F . Then a line is called an F -line if it passes
through two F -points, and a circle is called an F -circle if its center is an F -point and it
passes through at least one F -point.

312
16. Compass and Straightedge Constructions
It will be helpful to see what can be said about the equations of F -lines and F -circles.
If ` is a nonvertical F -line passing through F -points .x1;y1/ and .x2;y2/, then it is de-
scribed by an equation of the form y D mx C b with m and b given by (2.1) (see p. 34).
Because F is closed under the basic arithmetic operations, it follows that both m and b
are in F . Similarly, a vertical F -line is given by an equation x D c with c 2 F . If C is
an F -circle centered at an F -point .x1;y1/ and passing through another F -point .x2;y2/,
then it is described by an equation of the form
.x x1/2 C.y y1/2 D .x2 x1/2 C.y2 y1/2;
which can be simpliﬁed to
x2 Cy2 CAx CBy D C
for some numbers A;B;C, all of which are elements of F .
The heart of the proof is the establishment of the following facts:
(a) If `1 and `2 are nonparallel F -lines, then they intersect at an F -point.
(b) If C is an F -circle and ` is an F -line that is a secant line for C, then the coordinates
of their intersection points lie either in F or in some quadratic extension of F .
(c) If C1 and C2 are distinct F -circles that intersect at two points, then the coordinates
of their intersection points lie either in F or in some quadratic extension of F .
To prove (a), suppose `1 and `2 are nonparallel F -lines. If they are both nonvertical,
they are given by formulas y D m1x C b1 and y D m2x C b2, with m1;m2;b1;b2 2 F .
The assumption that they are nonparallel means m1 ¤ m2 by Lemma 2.22. Then a little
algebra shows that the coordinates of their intersection point .x;y/ are given by
x D  b2 b1
m2 m1
;
y D b1m2 b2m1
m2 m1
;
both of which are in F . The case in which one of the lines is vertical is similar but easier.
To prove (b), suppose ` is a nonvertical F -line given by y D mx C b and C is an
F -circle given by x2 Cy2 CAx CBy D C. Substituting mx Cb for y yields a quadratic
equation for x whose coefﬁcients all lie in F . The assumption that ` is a secant line means
that this equation has solutions, and the quadratic formula shows that they lie either in F
(in case the expression under the square root sign in the quadratic formula has a square
root in F ) or in a quadratic extension of F (if not). Inserting these solutions for x into the
equation y D mx Cb yields solutions for y in the same subﬁeld. Again, the case in which
` is vertical is easy.
Finally, to prove (c), suppose C1 and C2 are F -circles described by equations
x2 Cy2 CA1x CB1y D C1;
x2 Cy2 CA2x CB2y D C2;
with A1;B1;C1;A2;B2;C2 2 F . Subtracting these equations shows that any intersection
point .x;y/ has to satisfy
.A1 A2/x C.B1 B2/y D .C1 C2/:
(16.1)
If we assume C1 and C2 have two intersection points, then this linear equation must have
a solution, so A1  A2 and B1  B2 cannot both be zero (unless C1 D C2 as well, which
would contradict our assumption that the circles are distinct). Thus (16.1) is the equation

Impossible Constructions
313
for an F -line (vertical if B1 D B2, nonvertical otherwise), and we are back in the situation
of part (b).
Recall that we are assuming r is a constructible number, which means that jrj is equal
to the distance between two constructible points P and Q. Thus there is a ﬁnite sequence
of construction steps starting with O and I and leading to P and Q. We will show by
induction on the number of steps that P and Q have coordinates lying in some iterated
quadratic extension of Q. Because O and I are Q-points and at the start of the process
there are no lines or circles to intersect, the ﬁrst construction step can only yield a Q-line
or a Q-circle. The algorithm continues to produce Q-lines and Q-circles until the ﬁrst
time we construct an intersection point, which must be either a Q-point or an F1-point
for some quadratic extension F1  Q. Suppose by induction that after the kth step of the
construction there is an iterated quadratic extension F  Q such that everything we have
constructed so far is an F -line, F -circle, or F -point. If the next step is to construct a line
or circle using already-identiﬁed points, then it will be an F -line or F -circle by deﬁnition.
If the next step is to identify an intersection point, then it will be either an F -point or an
F 0-point for some quadratic extension F 0  F , either of which is an iterated quadratic
extension of Q. This completes the induction.
Let G denote an iterated quadratic extension of Q that contains the coordinates of
all points produced in the construction algorithm. The formula (6.2) for distance in the
Cartesian plane shows that jrj is equal to the square root of an element of G, and therefore
it lies either in G or in some quadratic extension of G, and thus in some iterated quadratic
extension of Q.
□
The Trisection Problem
With these algebraic tools in hand, it is now possible to attack the classical construction
problems. We begin with the trisection problem. Let us say that an angle is a constructible
angle if both of the lines containing its rays are constructible lines.
Theorem 16.39. Let  2 Œ0;180 be arbitrary. Then there is a constructible angle with
measure ı if and only if cos is a constructible number.
Proof. If  is equal to 0, 90, or 180, then it is obvious that there is a constructible ı angle,
and cos is equal to 1, 0, or 1, each of which is a constructible number; so the theorem
is true in those cases. Moreover, if 90 <  < 180, there is a a constructible angle with
measure  if and only if there is one with measure 180ı   (starting with either angle,
just extend one of its rays to construct a linear pair), and cos is constructible if and only
if cos.180ı / D cos is constructible. Thus it sufﬁces to restrict our attention to the
case 0 <  < 90, and we assume this is the case henceforth.
Suppose ﬁrst that cos is constructible. The assumption that 0 <  < 90 implies 0 <
cos < 1. Let AB be a segment whose length is cos. Construct the line ` perpendicular
to
 !
AB through B and the circle C with center A and radius 1. Because cos < 1, B lies
inside C, so ` is a secant line for C. Let C be one of the points where ` and C intersect
(Fig. 16.20). Then 4ABC is a right triangle in which cos†CAB D AB=AC D cos.
Since the cosine function is injective, it follows that m†CAB D .
Conversely, suppose there is a constructible  ı angle †rs, and let A denote its vertex.
Mark off the point C 2 Int

so cos is a constructible number.
□
Let us pause to look back at what we have done so far. Theorem 16.38 shows that a
number is constructible if and only if it is contained in some iterated quadratic extension
of Q; and Theorem 16.39 shows that an angle is constructible if and only if its cosine is
a constructible number. Our next task is to ﬁnd an angle whose cosine does not lie in any
such extension of Q. As we will see below, a 20ı angle will serve this purpose.
The preceding theorem shows that there is a constructible 20ı angle if and only if
cos20ı is a constructible number. To see if this is the case, let us write r D cos20ı. The
triple angle formula for the cosine (Corollary 13.17) reads
cos3 D 4cos3  3cos:
Applying this with  D 20ı and using the fact that cos60ı D 1
2, we obtain
1
2 D 4r3 3r:
(16.2)
To make this a little easier to analyze, let us set x D 2r and note that x is constructible if
and only if r is. Making this substitution in (16.2) and multiplying through by 2, we get
x3 3x 1 D 0:
(16.3)
In order to analyze this equation, we will use some standard deﬁnitions and facts about
polynomials, most of which should already be familiar to you. A real polynomial in one
variable is a function f WR ! R that can be written in the form
f .x/ D anxn Can1xn1 CCa1x Ca0;
(16.4)
for some nonnegative integer n and some real numbers a0;:::;an. Suppose f is such a
polynomial. We need the following standard deﬁnitions:
 The highest power of x that appears in the formula for f (i.e., the number n) is called
the degree of f .
 The numbers a0;:::;an multiplying the powers of x are called the coefﬁcients of f .
 Polynomials of degrees 1, 2, and 3 are called linear, quadratic, and cubic polynomi-
als, respectively.
 A number x such that f .x/ D 0 is called a root of the polynomial.
 A polynomial whose highest-degree term has a coefﬁcient of 1 is called monic.

Impossible Constructions
315
Here are the facts we need. The proofs of these can be found in most advanced calculus
textbooks.
 Two polynomials are equal (i.e., determine the same function) if and only if all of
their corresponding coefﬁcients are equal.
 A polynomial of degree n has at most n real roots.
 Every polynomial of odd degree has at least one real root.
 If f is a monic polynomial of degree n that has n distinct real roots r1;:::;rn, then
f can be factored as follows:
f .x/ D .x r1/.x r2/.x rn/:
 If a and b are real numbers such that f .a/ < 0 and f .b/ > 0, then f has at least one
real root strictly between a and b.
The reason we need these facts is to prove the following lemma.
Lemma 16.40. Equation (16.3) has no constructible solutions.
Proof. First we will show that (16.3) has no rational solutions. Suppose for the sake of
contradiction that x D p=q is such a solution, and assume it has been written in lowest
terms, meaning that p and q have no common prime factors. Substituting this into (16.3)
and multiplying through by q2, we get
p3
q D 3pq Cq2:
Since the right-hand side is an integer, this shows that p3 is divisible by q. Thus any prime
that divides q must also divide p, which contradicts our assumption that p and q have no
common factors unless q D ˙1. It follows that x D p=q is an integer. On the other hand,
writing the equation in the form x.x2 3/ D 1 shows that x itself must be ˙1 (since these
are the only integer factors of 1). However, neither x D 1 nor x D 1 solves the equation,
so this is a contradiction.
Let f be the cubic polynomial f .x/ D x3 3x 1. A direct computation shows that
f .2/ D 3, f .1/ D 1, f .1/ D 3, and f .2/ D 1 (see Fig. 16.21), so in fact f has three
distinct roots, lying in the intervals .2;1/, .1;1/, and .1;2/. If we denote the three
roots by r;s;t, then we can factor f as follows:
f .x/ D .x r/.x s/.x t/ D x3 .r Cs Ct/x2 C.rs Crt Cst/x rst:
(16.5)
Because these polynomial functions are equal, all of their corresponding coefﬁcients are
equal. The x2-coefﬁcient of f .x/ is zero, which implies that
r Cs Ct D 0:
(16.6)
Now suppose that one of the roots is constructible, say x D r. This means that r lies
in some iterated quadratic extension of Q. Let Fm  Fm1    F1  F0 D Q be a
sequence of quadratic extension ﬁelds such that r 2 Fm; we can assume that these ﬁelds
have been chosen such that m is as small as possible. Because f has no rational roots, we
know that m  1. We can write r in the form r D a Cbpe, with a;b;e elements of Fm1
such that pe … Fm1. Substituting this value for r and expanding, we obtain

implies
t D r s D 2a:
However, 2a 2 Fm1, so we have shown that f has a root in Fm1. This contradicts our
assumption that m was the smallest number of quadratic extensions needed to ﬁnd a root
of f .
□
The next theorem was ﬁrst proved by the French mathematician Pierre Wantzel in
1837.
Theorem 16.41. There is no constructible 20ı angle.
Proof. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there is a constructible 20ı angle. The-
orem 16.39 shows that r D cos20ı is a constructible number, and thus x D 2r is also
constructible. But x is a solution to (16.3), so this is a contradiction.
□
Corollary 16.42. There is no algorithm for trisecting an arbitrary angle with compass and
straightedge.
Proof. If there were such an algorithm, we could start with points O and I whose distance
is 1, construct an equilateral triangle with OI as one of its sides, and then trisect one of its
60ı angles, yielding a constructible 20ı angle, which is impossible.
□
Despite the fact that it has been known for 175 years that trisection with straightedge
and compass is impossible, there is always a steady stream of well-meaning amateur math-
ematicians who claim that they have discovered a trisection algorithm, probably because
the problem is so easy to state while the impossibility proof requires some rather sophis-
ticated mathematical background to understand. Most such attempts either produce close
approximations but not exact trisections or use the compass and straightedge in some ille-
gitimate way; but you can be sure that all of them are wrong if they claim to have produced
an algorithm that trisects an arbitrary angle while following the classical rules for using
straightedge and compass. Underwood Dudley has written an amusing book [Dud94]
exploring some of the many failed attempts and the people who continue to attempt the
impossible.

Impossible Constructions

Doubling a Cube and Squaring a Circle
With the same tools, we can address two more of the ancient construction problems.
Theorem 16.43. There is no algorithm for doubling an arbitrary cube with compass and
straightedge.
Proof. If there were such an algorithm, then we could start with a segment of length 1 and
construct a segment of length
3p
2, implying that the number x D
3p
2 is a constructible
number. Let Fm    F0 D Q be a sequence of quadratic extension ﬁelds such that
x 2 Fm, again with m chosen as small as possible. As before, we can write x D a Cbpe
with a;b;e 2 Fm1 and pe … Fm1. Then b ¤ 0, because b D 0 would mean x 2 Fm1,
contradicting our assumption that m is the smallest possible such integer. We compute
0 D x3 2 D

a Cbpe
3 2 D .a3 C3ab2e 2/C.3a2b Cb3e/pe:
As before, Lemma 16.33 implies that .a3 C3ab2e 2/ D .3a2b Cb3e/ D 0, from which
it follows that a bpe is another solution to the same equation. Since real numbers have
unique cube roots, this is a contradiction.
□
To attack the problem of squaring the circle, we need to introduce one more bit of
algebraic terminology. A real number x is said to be algebraic if there is some polynomial
f with rational coefﬁcients such that f .x/ D 0; it is said to be transcendental otherwise.
For example, if x is any number in a quadratic extension ﬁeld Q
pe

, then x D a Cbpe
with a, b, and e rational, and a simple computation shows that x2 2ax Ca2 b2 D 0, so
any such number is algebraic. Somewhat more generally, we have the following lemma.
It is not terribly hard to prove, but the R-rated proof would require a detour into algebra
that would take us a little too far aﬁeld, so we will just state it. You can ﬁnd a proof in
[Her99, Chapter 5].
Lemma 16.44. Every constructible number is algebraic.
In 1882, it was proved by the German mathematician Ferdinand von Lindemann that
 is transcendental. The X-rated proof, which is quite hard, can be found in [HW08]. As
a consequence, we have the following theorem.
Theorem 16.45. There is no algorithm for squaring an arbitrary circle with compass and
straightedge.
Proof. If there were such an algorithm, we could begin by constructing a circle of radius
1, which has area , and then construct a square with the same area. The side of this
square would have length p, and since the set of constructible numbers is closed under
multiplication, we could then construct a segment of length . This would imply that  is
constructible and hence algebraic, a contradiction.
□
Constructible Polygons
Finally, we address the problem of constructing regular polygons. The next lemma
shows that it is intimately connected with the problem of constructing speciﬁc angles.
Lemma 16.46. Let n be an integer greater than or equal to 3. Then there is a constructible
regular n-gon if and only if there is a constructible angle whose measure is 360ı=n.

318
16. Compass and Straightedge Constructions
Proof. First suppose there is a constructible regular n-gon P . By Theorem 14.39 it has
a circumcircle C. This circle is the same as the circumcircle of any three consecutive
vertices, so we can draw the circle, locate its center O, and draw the segments connecting
O to two consecutive vertices of P . The central angle formed by these two segments has
measure 360ı=n by Theorem 14.40.
Conversely, suppose there is a constructible angle with measure 360ı=n. Let †POQ
be such an angle, and draw any circle C with center O. Then by repeatedly copying this
angle on both sides of
 !
OP and marking the points where the various rays meet C, we can
recreate the conﬁguration shown in Fig. 14.34 (see p. 273). The proof of Theorem 14.42
shows that the resulting polygon is a regular n-gon.
□
Using this lemma, we can immediately identify at least one nonconstructible polygon.
Theorem 16.47. No regular nine-sided polygon can be constructed using straightedge and
compass.
Proof. By Lemma 16.46, if it were possible to construct a regular nine-sided polygon,
then it would be possible to construct an angle whose measure is 360ı=9 D 40ı. But then
we could bisect this angle and construct a 20ı angle, which we know to be impossible.
□
Euclid showed how to construct regular polygons with 3, 4, 5, 6, and 15 sides. More-
over, the technique we used for constructing a regular octagon (bisecting each central an-
gle) can be applied to any regular polygon to construct one with twice the number of sides.
Thus Euclid’s methods can also be used to construct regular polygons with 8, 10, 12, 16,
20, 24, or 30 sides or in fact any regular polygon with 2k times as many sides as an already-
constructed one. All of this was known in ancient times.
Long before Wantzel’s solution to the trisection problem, Carl Friedrich Gauss made
a surprising discovery. In 1796, when he was nineteen years old, Gauss recorded in his
diary the ﬁrst major contribution to the theory of constructible polygons in more than
2000 years: he showed that a regular 17-gon (a heptadecagon) can be constructed with
straightedge and compass. What he actually proved was that the cosine of 360ı=17 can be
written in the following form:

This is a horrible-looking expression, but the only thing you need to notice about it is
that it is built up from integers using only addition, subtraction, multiplication, division,
and square roots; thus it is a constructible number. (Gauss did not actually write down
an algorithm for constructing a regular heptadecagon; this was ﬁrst done by Johannes
Erchinger a few years later. In principle, you could construct such an algorithm by using
this formula and following the algorithms used to solve the construction problems in this
chapter, although the resulting algorithm might not be very efﬁcient.)
In addition, Gauss noticed that the techniques that led to this formula for cos.360ı=17/
also led to analogous formulas for cos.360ı=p/ whenever p is a prime number of the form
p D 2.2n/ C 1 for some nonnegative integer n. Such prime numbers are called Fermat
primes after the French mathematician Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665), who ﬁrst studied
them. The only known Fermat primes are 3, 5, 17, 257, and 65537, which are of the
form 2.2n/ C1 for n D 0;1;2;3;4. It is known (as of 2012) that 2.2n/ C1 is not prime for

5  n  32, but it is not known if there are any other Fermat primes or even whether there
are ﬁnitely many or inﬁnitely many of them.
The same technique Euclid used to construct a regular 15-gon can easily be adapted
to construct a regular polygon with pq sides given a regular p-gon and a regular q-gon,
provided that p and q have no common prime factors. Using this, Gauss showed that a
regular n-gon can be constructed whenever n is either of the form 2k for some integer
k  2 or of the form 2kp1 pm for k  0 and some distinct Fermat primes p1;:::;pm.
In the same 1837 paper in which he solved the trisection problem, Pierre Wantzel
proved that the converse is also true, leading to the following theorem, whose proof is
decidedly X-rated. (See [Har00, Theorem 29.4] for a proof.)
Theorem 16.48 (Characterization of Constructible Regular Polygons). A regular n-
gon can be constructed with straightedge and compass if and only if n is either a power of
2 or a power of 2 times a product of distinct Fermat primes.
Corollary 16.49. There is no constructible regular heptagon.

The Parallel Postulate
Revisited
As we have noted before, a major preoccupation of geometers from the time of Euclid until
the nineteenth century was trying to show that Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate could be proved from
his other postulates. Many “proofs” were offered, only to be found later to be ﬂawed. We
now know that no such proof exists, because the Euclidean parallel postulate is independent
of the other postulates of Euclidean geometry, as the models of Chapter 6 demonstrate.
Nonetheless, in the process of searching for a proof, mathematicians were able to
show that a great number of theorems can be proved without the ﬁfth postulate. Even more
importantly, they discovered a number of alternative postulates that could serve just as well
as the ﬁfth postulate. In this chapter, we will explore some of those other postulates.
To that end, let us turn our clock back to the moment before we introduced the Eu-
clidean parallel postulate: just before the beginning of Chapter 10. All of the results of
the present chapter are results in neutral geometry. Throughout the chapter, we assume
the postulates of neutral geometry (Postulates 1–9), but no parallel postulate, Euclidean
or otherwise. Thus we have at our disposal only the things that we proved in Chapters 3
through 9, when we were not relying on the parallel postulate. Some notable results that
we cannot use are the converse to the alternate interior angles theorem and its corollaries,
the angle-sum theorems, theorems about similarity, and the Pythagorean theorem.
Postulates Equivalent to the Euclidean Parallel Postulate
The postulate we chose to use in our axiomatic treatment of Euclidean geometry is Pos-
tulate 10E, which we are calling the Euclidean parallel postulate. In the remainder of this
chapter, we will refer to this postulate as the EPP. Our main task in this chapter is to explore
some of the postulates that have been discovered to be equivalent to the EPP, meaning that
if one of them is added to the postulates of neutral geometry as an additional postulate,
then the others follow as theorems. In this chapter, we will describe a number of such
postulates, which we call Euclidean postulates.
321

322
17. The Parallel Postulate Revisited
We begin with the oldest one of all.
Euclidean Postulate 1 (Euclid’s Fifth Postulate). If ` and `0 are two lines cut by a
transversal t in such a way that the measures of two consecutive interior angles add up to
less than 180ı, then ` and `0 intersect on the same side of t as those two angles.
Our ﬁrst theorem shows that the EPP and Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate are equivalent.
Theorem 17.1. In the context of neutral geometry, Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate is equivalent to
the Euclidean parallel postulate.
Proof. We have already shown in Chapter 10 that the nine postulates of neutral geometry
plus the EPP are sufﬁcient to prove Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate. (Although we cannot simply
quote the theorems of Chapters 10–15 the way we could in Euclidean geometry, we can
refer to the proofs of those theorems to show that certain statements follow if the Euclidean
parallel postulate is assumed.) Thus we need only prove the converse. Assume therefore
that Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate is true, along with all the postulates of neutral geometry. We
need to show that the EPP holds, or, more precisely, that given any line ` and any point A
not on `, there is one and only one line m that contains A and is parallel to `.
Let ` be a line and let A be a point not on `. Theorem 7.25 (which is valid in neutral
geometry) shows that there is at least one line m through A and parallel to `, so we have to
show that there cannot be more than one such line. Theorem 7.25 also shows that we can
choose our parallel line m so that ` and m admit a common perpendicular that contains A.
Let t be such a common perpendicular, and let F be the point where t meets ` (the foot of
the perpendicular from A to `).
Suppose m0 is another line through A and not equal to m. We will show that m0 must
intersect `. If m0 D t, then m0 certainly intersects `, so we can assume m0 ¤ t. Because
m is the unique perpendicular to t at A, m0 is not perpendicular to t. The two rays in m0
starting at A make angles with
!
AF that form a linear pair, and neither is a right angle, so
one of them must be acute. Choose a point S in the interior of the ray that makes an acute
angle with
!
AF , and choose G 2 ` on the same side of t as S (Fig. 17.1).
A
F
G

Fig. 17.1. Proof that Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate follows from the EPP.
Now, †SAF and †AFG form a pair of consecutive interior angles for the transversal
 !
AF to ` and m0. Because †AFG is a right angle and †SAF is acute, the sum of their
angle measures is less than 180ı. Therefore, Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate implies that the lines
m0 and ` meet, so m0 is not parallel to `.
□

Postulates Equivalent to the Euclidean Parallel Postulate
323
As explained in Chapter 1, a common mistake in early attempts to prove that Euclid’s
ﬁfth postulate follows from the other four was assuming that parallel lines are equidistant.
The next theorem shows that this assumption is actually equivalent to the EPP.
Euclidean Postulate 2 (The Equidistance Postulate). If two lines are parallel, then each
one is equidistant from the other.
Theorem 17.2. In the context of neutral geometry, the equidistance postulate is equivalent
to the Euclidean parallel postulate.
A
P
Q
R
F
G
`
m
n
Fig. 17.2. Proof that the equidistance postulate implies the EPP.
Proof. Theorem 10.8 showed that the equidistance postulate follows from the EPP. To
prove the converse, assume that the equidistance postulate holds. We will prove that the
EPP holds.
Suppose ` is a line and A is a point not on `, and assume for the sake of contradiction
that m and n are two distinct lines through A and parallel to ` (see Fig. 17.2). Let F be the
foot of the perpendicular from A to `. If P and Q are any points on m such that P AQ,
then P and Q are on opposite sides of n (because m and n are distinct), so one of them, say
Q, must also be on the opposite side of n from F . Let G be the foot of the perpendicular
from Q to `. Because ` k n, both G and F are on the same side of n, so G and Q are on
opposite sides of n. That means QG must intersect n at a point R. Because m k `, the
equidistance postulate implies QG D AF , and because n k `, the equidistance postulate
implies RG D AF . Thus by transitivity, QG D RG. This means that Q and R are both
points in the interior of
!
GQ at the same distance from G, so the unique point theorem
(Corollary 3.36) implies that Q D R. But since m and n are distinct lines, they intersect
only at A, so this is a contradiction.
□
Here are four other postulates that can readily be shown to be equivalent to the EPP.
We leave the proofs as exercises.
Euclidean Postulate 3 (Playfair’s Postulate). Two straight lines cannot be drawn through
the same point, parallel to the same straight line, without coinciding with one another.
Euclidean Postulate 4 (The Alternate Interior Angles Postulate). If two parallel lines
are cut by a transversal, then both pairs of alternate interior angles are congruent.
Euclidean Postulate 5 (Proclus’s Postulate). If ` and `0 are parallel lines and t is a line
that is distinct from ` but intersects `, then t also intersects `0.
Euclidean Postulate 6 (The Transitivity Postulate). If `, m, and n are distinct lines such
that ` k m and m k n, then ` k n.

17. The Parallel Postulate Revisited
Theorem 17.3. In the context of neutral geometry, each of the four preceding postulates
is equivalent to the Euclidean parallel postulate.
Proof. See Exercises 17A–17D.
□
Next we present a postulate on the existence of similar triangles that was proposed
by the English mathematician John Wallis in 1693. As we will see in the next chapter,
similarity is a characteristically Euclidean phenomenon.
Euclidean Postulate 7 (Wallis’s Postulate). Given any triangle 4ABC and any positive
real number r, there exists a triangle 4DEF similar to 4ABC with scale factor r D
DE=AB D DF=AC D EF=BC.
The next proof is rated PG.
Theorem 17.4. Wallis’s postulate is equivalent to the Euclidean parallel postulate.
Proof. The similar triangle construction theorem (Theorem 12.4) shows that the EPP im-
plies Wallis’s postulate: given 4ABC and r, let DE be any segment whose length is r
times the length of AB, and then Theorem 12.4 guarantees the existence of a point F such
that 4DEF

the perpendicular from A to `. We know there is one line m through A and parallel to `,

Angle Sums and Defects
One of the most important consequences of the Euclidean parallel postulate is the angle-
sum theorem for triangles—as we have seen in the last several chapters, it leads to a host of
consequences in Euclidean geometry and seems to be a quintessentially Euclidean theorem.
As the next theorem will show, it turns out that it is true only in Euclidean geometry,
because it is equivalent to the EPP.
Euclidean Postulate 8 (The Angle-Sum Postulate). The angle sum of every triangle is
equal to 180ı.
In a moment, we will prove that the angle-sum postulate is equivalent to the EPP.
Before we do so, we need the following lemma. The proof of this lemma and that of the
theorem that follows it are both rated R.

FG as follows. First let T1 be
the point on
!
FG such that F T1 Š AF . Then let T2 be the point such that F  T1  T2

Tn1 Tn TnC1 and ATn Š TnTnC1. For notational convenience, let T0 D F .
For each n  1, we have ATn1 Š Tn1Tn and thus †Tn1ATn Š †Tn1TnA by the
isosceles triangle theorem; let n denote the common measure of these two angles. We
will show by induction that the following equation holds for each n:
m†FATn D 1 CCn:
(17.1)
For the base case n D 1, this is true by deﬁnition of 1. Assuming that (17.1) holds for
some n  1, it follows from betweenness vs. betweenness, the betweenness theorem for
rays, and the induction hypothesis that
m†FATnC1 D m†FATn Cm†TnATnC1 D .1 CCn/CnC1:
This proves that (17.1) holds for each positive integer n.
For each n, the points F , A, and Tn are noncollinear, so
1 CCn D m†FATn < 180ı:
If we choose n large enough that n" > 180, then at least one of the n angle measures

which is not less than 180ı). Thus we can choose i such that i < " and set X D Ti, so that
m†AXF D i < " as desired.
□
Theorem 17.6. The angle-sum postulate is equivalent to the Euclidean parallel postulate.
Proof. Theorem 10.11 showed that the angle-sum postulate follows from the EPP. To
prove that the angle-sum postulate implies the EPP, we will actually prove the contra-
positive: assuming the EPP is false, we will prove that there is a triangle whose angle sum
is not equal to 180ı.
The assumption that the EPP is false means that there exist at least one line ` and one
point A through which there are two or more lines parallel to `. Let F be the foot of the
perpendicular from A to `. At least one of the lines through A and parallel to `, say m, is
not perpendicular to
 !
AF . Arguing just as in the proof of Theorem 17.1, we see that one of
the rays in m must make an acute angle with
!
AF . Choose a point S in the interior of that
ray and a point G 2 ` on the same side of
 !
AF as S (Fig. 17.5). Deﬁne real numbers ˛ and
ˇ by
˛ D m†FAS;
ˇ D 90ı ˛:
Then our assumptions guarantee that both ˛ and ˇ are strictly between 0ı and 90ı, and
they satisfy ˛ C ˇ D 90ı. We will show that there must exist a right triangle whose two
acute angles have measures smaller than ˛ and ˇ, respectively, which means that it violates
the angle-sum postulate.

Thus the angle-sum postulate is false.
□
Notice that the triangle we constructed in the previous proof has angle sum strictly less
than 180ı. Our next theorem will show that this is the only way the angle-sum postulate
can fail: it is impossible in neutral geometry for angle sums of triangles to be greater than
180ı. This theorem was ﬁrst stated and proved by Giovanni Saccheri in his 1733 book
Euclid Freed of Every Flaw [Sac86], in which he attempted to prove Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate
by contradiction. We will give a proof that was published by Adrien-Marie Legendre in
1794. It is rated R.

Theorem 17.7 (Saccheri–Legendre). In neutral geometry, the angle sum of every triangle
is less than or equal to 180ı.
Proof. Let 4ABC be an arbitrary triangle, and label its angle measures as follows:
˛ D m†A;
ˇ D m†B;
 D m†C:
Assume for the sake of contradiction that ˛ Cˇ C > 180ı.

(17.2)
Subtracting this from our assumed inequality ˛ Cˇ C > 180ı yields ˛ > , and then the
hinge theorem implies that BC > AD. The idea of the proof is that if we make a large
number of copies of ABCD, this small inequality will add up to a large inequality that
violates the general triangle inequality.
Label the side lengths of ABCD as
a D BC;
c D AB D CD;
e D AD;
so that a e > 0. Let n be a positive integer large enough that n.a e/ > 2c.
Now let A0B0 be any segment of length c, and choose points A1 and B1 on one side of
 !
A0B0 so that A0B0B1A1 Š ABCD. (This is possible by Theorem 9.14.) On the opposite
side of

A1B1 from A0 and B0, choose points A2 and B2 such that A1B1B2A2 Š ABCD.
Continue constructing n trapezoids in this way (Fig. 17.7).
For each i D 1;:::;n  1, the two angles at Bi have angle measures  C  and ˇ, so
they are supplementary by (17.2). Therefore, by the converse to the linear pair theorem,
Bi1, Bi, and BiC1 are collinear. Since this is true for each i, all of the points B0;:::;Bn
are collinear. (We are not claiming that the Ai’s are collinear, though.) It follows by

our choice of n such that n.a e/ > 2c. This contradiction shows that our assumption of
an angle sum greater than 180ı is impossible.
□
In order to delve deeper into the relationships between angle sums and parallel postu-
lates, let us study this phenomenon more closely. The Saccheri–Legendre theorem shows
that in neutral geometry, the angle sum of a triangle is never more than 180ı, but it might
be less. We will deﬁne a quantity called the defect of a triangle, which measures how much
less it is for any given triangle. Speciﬁcally, if 4ABC is a triangle, we deﬁne its defect,
denoted by ı.4ABC/, to be the difference
ı.4ABC/ D 180ı .4ABC/ D 180ı .m†ACm†B Cm†C/:
The Saccheri–Legendre theorem shows that the defect of every triangle is nonnegative; it
is equal to zero if and only if the triangle satisﬁes the angle-sum formula of Euclidean
geometry. The angle-sum postulate can be rephrased as the assertion that every triangle
has zero defect.
More generally, we can deﬁne an analogous quantity for convex polygons with any
number of sides. If P is a convex n-gon, we deﬁne its defect, denoted by ı.P /, to be the
difference
ı.P / D .n2/	180ı .P /:
In particular, for a convex quadrilateral DEFG, this means
ı.DEFG/ D 360ı .DEFG/:
A convex polygon has zero defect if and only if it satisﬁes the angle-sum formula of Eu-
clidean geometry.
The next theorem expresses the most important property of defects. We will use it in
the next section to prove a surprising equivalence with the EPP. Its proof is rated R.
Theorem 17.8 (Defect Addition). In neutral geometry, suppose P is a convex polygon
and BC is a chord of P . Let P1 and P2 be the two convex polygons formed by BC as in
the polygon splitting theorem (Theorem 8.9). Then ı.P / D ı.P1/Cı.P2/.

17. The Parallel Postulate Revisited
Next consider the case in which one of the points (say B) is a vertex but C is not
(Fig. 17.8(b)). As in the proof of Theorem 8.9, choose vertex labels so that B D Ai and C
is in the interior of Aj AjC1, so
P1 D A1 :::Ai1BCAjC1 :::An
and
P2 D BAiC1:::Aj 1Aj C:
In this case, three things have to change in the preceding argument: ﬁrst, in place of (17.4),
the linear pair theorem gives
m†Aj CB Cm†BCAj C1 D 180ı:
Second, in P2, the single vertex Aj D C is now replaced by two vertices Aj and C, so
the term mAj1CB in (17.6) has to be replaced by two terms m†Aj Cm†Aj CB on the
right-hand side of (17.5). Finally, the number of vertices of P2 is now j i C2. When we
insert these changes into the calculations above, we obtain two additional 180ı terms that
cancel each other out, and the result remains true as before.
Finally, when neither point is a vertex (Fig. 17.8(c)), we can label the vertices so that
B 2 IntAiAiC1 and C 2 IntAj AjC1 and write
P1 D A1 :::AiBCAjC1 :::An
and
P2 D BAiC1:::Aj C:
In addition to the changes in the preceding paragraph, (17.3) now has to be replaced by
m†AiBC Cm†CBAiC1 D 180ı;
the term m†Ai1BC has to be replaced by m†Ai Cm†AiBC in (17.6), and the number
of vertices of P1 becomes n C i j C 2. In this case there are two more 180ı terms that
also cancel, yielding the desired result.
□
Corollary 17.9 (Saccheri–Legendre Theorem for Convex Polygons). In neutral geom-
etry, if P is a convex n-gon, then the angle sum of P satisﬁes
.P /  .n2/	180ı:
Therefore, the defect of a convex polygon is always nonnegative.
Proof. Exercise 17F.
□
The preceding corollary is true for nonconvex polygons as well, but it is a little more
work to prove and we do not need it.
Clairaut’s Postulate
A basic fact of Euclidean geometry is that rectangles exist in abundance—see, for example,
Theorem 10.28, which shows that a rectangle can be constructed with any given segment
as one of its sides. The proof of that theorem relied on the EPP in several ways, as you
can check. Note that rectangles all have angle sums of 360ı. Now that we know that the
angle-sum theorem is closely related to the validity of the EPP, we might expect that it
would be difﬁcult to construct rectangles without the EPP. In fact, the relationship is much
deeper than you might have suspected.
In the mid-eighteenth century, a French mathematician named Alexis Clairaut pro-
posed the following surprising substitute for Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate.
Euclidean Postulate 9 (Clairaut’s Postulate). There exists a rectangle.

Clairaut’s Postulate
331
The proof of the next theorem is rated R.
Theorem 17.10. Clairaut’s postulate is equivalent to the Euclidean parallel postulate.
Proof. Theorem 10.28 showed that the EPP implies Clairaut’s postulate. Conversely, we
will prove in several steps that Clairaut’s postulate implies the angle-sum postulate. Since
we have already shown that the angle-sum postulate implies the EPP, that sufﬁces.
Assume there exists a rectangle. Note that the common perpendicular theorem implies
that rectangles are parallelograms in neutral geometry. However, the proof that opposite
sides of parallelograms are congruent uses the converse to the alternate interior angles
theorem and thus does not work in neutral geometry, so we cannot conclude that rectangles
have congruent opposite sides.

Fig. 17.9. Constructing a larger rectangle.
STEP 1: If m is any positive real number, there exists a rectangle whose side lengths
are all greater than m. The key observation is that given one rectangle, we can construct
another rectangle whose shortest side is at least twice as long as the shortest side of the
original one. Let ABCD be a rectangle, and without loss of generality suppose CD is its
shortest side. Using Theorem 9.14, we can ﬁnd points E and F on the opposite side of
 !
CD from A and B such that CDEF Š CDAB (Fig. 17.9).
Because †ADC and †CDE are right angles that share
!
DC and lie on opposite sides
of it, the partial converse to the linear pair theorem shows that
!
DA and
!
DE are opposite
rays, so AD E. A similar argument shows that B C F . Thus ABFE is a rectangle.
Its side lengths satisfy
EF D AB  CD;
AE D AD CDE D 2AD  2CD;
BF D BC CCF D 2BC  2CD:
Now do the same construction again using AE: let G and H be points on the opposite
side of
 !
AE from B and F such that AEGH Š AEFB. The same argument as in the
preceding paragraph shows that BFGH is a rectangle, and all four of its side lengths are
greater than or equal to 2CD.
To complete Step 1, we just start with any rectangle and apply the construction above
repeatedly, at least doubling the minimum side length each time. After ﬁnitely many steps,
we obtain a rectangle whose side lengths are all strictly greater than m.
STEP 2: Every right triangle has zero defect. Let 4ABC be a right triangle with right
angle at C. Let m be the length of the longest leg of 4ABC, and let PQRS be a rectangle

lemma for points implies C  A  F . Thus the hypotheses of the defect addition theorem

Since ı.CDEF / D 0 and all defects are nonnegative, it follows that both terms on the
right-hand side must be zero. In particular, 4ABC has zero defect as claimed.

vertices have been labeled so that AB is the longest side. Then the altitude from C meets
AB at an interior point F and cuts 4ABC into two right triangles, 4AFC and 4CFB.
Step 2 and the defect addition theorem imply that ı.4ABC/ D ı.4AFC/Cı.4CFB/ D
0C0.
□
The remarkable thing about Clairaut’s postulate is that it seems to have ﬁnally achieved
at least part of what geometers had been seeking for so many centuries: although Clairaut
did not succeed in proving that Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate followed from the other four (as we
now know he could not possibly have done), he did show that the ﬁfth postulate can be
replaced by an assumption that seems just as straightforward and self-evident as the other
four postulates and does not mention lines being parallel or being extended arbitrarily far.
We might speculate that if Euclid had realized he could use Clairaut’s postulate in place
of his own ﬁfth, nobody would have expended much effort trying to improve on Euclid’s
postulates. (After all, is there really a big difference between assuming the existence of a
rectangle and assuming the existence of a circle with any center and any radius?) Had this
been the case, the entire course of mathematics history might have been radically different.
One is even tempted to wonder whether non-Euclidean geometry—and with it our modern
understanding of the axiomatic method—would ever have been discovered without the
motivation provided by the awkward ﬁfth postulate.
However, even though Clairaut’s postulate provided an entirely reasonable resolution
to the nonintuitiveness of Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate, it still did not resolve the question of
whether the ﬁfth postulate was independent of the others. The answer to that question
would not come until a century after Clairaut’s death.
Our last Euclidean postulate is a minor variation on Clairaut’s postulate, recast in terms
of triangles.

Euclidean Postulate 10 (The Weak Angle-Sum Postulate). There exists a triangle with
zero defect.
Theorem 17.11. The weak angle-sum postulate is equivalent to the Euclidean parallel
postulate.
Proof. The EPP implies the weak angle-sum postulate, because it implies that every trian-
gle has zero defect (and there exists a triangle because there are three noncollinear points).
Conversely, assume that 4ABC is a triangle with zero defect. We may assume that the
vertices have been labeled so that AB is the longest side. Let F be the foot of the altitude
to AB as in the proof of Theorem 17.10 (see Fig. 17.11). The defect addition theorem
guarantees that ı.4AFC/ C ı.4CFB/ D ı.4ABC/ D 0. Since both terms on the left-
hand side are nonnegative, they must both be zero. In particular 4AFC is a right triangle
with zero defect, so m†FCACm†CAF D 90ı.

Similarly, †DCF is a right angle, so AFCD is a rectangle. Thus Clairaut’s postulate is

It’s All or Nothing
The results we have developed in this chapter now enable us to answer a question that
might have occurred to you when we ﬁrst started talking about parallel postulates in neutral
geometry: is it possible for a model of neutral geometry to satisfy neither the Euclidean
nor the hyperbolic parallel postulate? Of course, for any given line ` and point A not on `,
either the parallel to ` through A is unique or it is not. But can it happen that for some lines
and some points the parallels are unique, while for others they are not? The next theorem
shows that it is not possible. Its proof is rated PG.
Theorem 17.12 (The All-or-Nothing Theorem). In neutral geometry, if there exist one
line `0 and one point A0 … `0 such that there are two or more distinct lines parallel to `0
through A0, then for every line ` and every point A … `, there are two or more distinct lines
parallel to ` through A.

334
17. The Parallel Postulate Revisited
Proof. Suppose there exist such a line `0 and point A0. This implies that the Euclidean
parallel postulate is false. Therefore, by Theorem 17.10, no rectangle exists.
Now suppose ` is an arbitrary line and A is a point not on `. We will show that there
are at least two distinct lines m and m0 through A and parallel to `. Let F be the foot of
the perpendicular from A to `, and let m be the line perpendicular to
 !
AF at A; thus m is
one line parallel to ` through A.

To ﬁnd another one, choose any point G 2 ` other than F , and let t be the line per-
pendicular to ` at G (Fig. 17.13). Then t and
 !
AF are parallel because they have ` as a
common perpendicular, so A … t. Let H be the foot of the perpendicular from A to t. The
common perpendicular theorem implies that AH k FG and AF k GH, so AFGH is a
parallelogram by the parallelogram lemma, which has three right angles by construction.
If
 !
AH were equal to m, then the fourth angle of AFGH would be a right angle because
m ?

AH is a
line distinct from m that is parallel to ` through A.

Corollary 17.13. In every model of neutral geometry, either the Euclidean parallel postu-
late or the hyperbolic parallel postulate holds.
Proof. The preceding theorem shows that if the Euclidean parallel postulate is false, then
the hyperbolic parallel postulate is true.

in his list of proposed postulates for Euclidean geometry (Appendix B). Note that
the SAS similarity postulate also implies the SAS postulate, by applying it in the
special case in which AB=DE D AC=DF D 1. Thus Birkhoff used this postulate as a
substitute for both the Euclidean parallel postulate and SAS; this is one way in which
he was able to keep the number of his postulates down to four.]


Chapter 18
Introduction to
Hyperbolic Geometry
In this chapter, we begin our study of hyperbolic geometry. This is the axiomatic system
consisting of the primitive terms and postulates of neutral geometry together with the hy-
perbolic parallel postulate. It gets its name primarily from the hyperboloid model, which
is the model of hyperbolic geometry most closely analogous to the sphere. Some authors
call it Lobachevskian geometry in honor of Nikolai Lobachevsky, one of its discoverers.
We know it is consistent because Beltrami [Bel68] constructed models of it based on the
Beltrami–Klein model, the Poincar´e disk, and the Poincar´e half-plane.
The Hyperbolic Parallel Postulate
In addition to the nine postulates of neutral geometry, throughout this chapter and the next
we assume the following postulate.
Postulate 10H (The Hyperbolic Parallel Postulate). For each line ` and each
point A that does not lie on `, there are at least two distinct lines that contain A
and are parallel to `.
Every theorem in neutral geometry is also a theorem in hyperbolic geometry, includ-
ing the Saccheri–Legendre and defect addition theorems from the preceding chapter. In
addition, the work we did in the preceding chapter quickly yields several other theorems
in hyperbolic geometry: because the Euclidean parallel postulate is false in hyperbolic ge-
ometry, each of the postulates that we showed to be equivalent to the EPP is also false. In
particular, we have the following important theorem.
Theorem 18.1. In hyperbolic geometry, there does not exist a rectangle.
Proof. This follows from Theorem 17.10, which shows that the existence of a rectangle is
equivalent to the EPP.

18. Introduction to Hyperbolic Geometry
The next theorem expresses one of the most fundamental features of hyperbolic ge-
ometry.
Theorem 18.2 (Hyperbolic Angle-Sum Theorem). In hyperbolic geometry, every convex
polygon has positive defect.
Proof. By the Saccheri–Legendre theorem, every triangle has nonnegative defect. Because
the EPP is false, Theorem 17.11 shows that the weak angle-sum postulate is also false, so
no triangle has zero defect. The only possibility, therefore, is that every triangle has positive
defect. The result for convex polygons with more than three vertices is then proved by
induction on the number of vertices, just as in the proof of Corollary 17.9.
□
One of the oddest features of hyperbolic geometry follows from the fact that Wallis’s
postulate is false: we cannot construct similar triangles with arbitrary scale factors. In
fact, the next theorem shows that we cannot construct similar triangles at all in hyperbolic
geometry (except for congruent triangles, which are similar for silly reasons).
Theorem 18.3 (AAA Congruence Theorem). In hyperbolic geometry, if there is a corre-
spondence between the vertices of two triangles such that all three pairs of corresponding
angles are congruent, then the triangles are congruent under that correspondence.
Proof. Suppose 4ABC and 4DEF are triangles in which †A Š †D, †B Š †E, and
†C Š †F . If any side of 4ABC is congruent to the corresponding side of 4DEF ,
then the two triangles are congruent by ASA. So suppose for the sake of contradiction
that all three pairs of corresponding sides are noncongruent: AB ¤ DE, AC ¤ DF , and
BC ¤ EF . Since there are three inequalities and each one must be either “greater than” or
“less than,” at least two of them must go in the same direction. Without loss of generality,
let us assume that AB < DE and AC < DF .

(Fig. 18.1). It follows from SAS that 4DPQ Š 4ABC, and therefore †DPQ Š †B Š
†E and †DQP Š †C Š †F . By the polygon splitting theorem, PQFE is a convex
quadrilateral (in fact, a trapezoid by the corresponding angles theorem). Since †EPQ is
supplementary to †DPQ and therefore also to †E, and since †FQP is supplementary
to †DQP and thus to †F , it follows that PQFE has angle sum equal to 360ı and defect
zero. This contradicts the hyperbolic angle-sum theorem.
□

The Hyperbolic Parallel Postulate
339
This theorem is remarkable because it implies that it is impossible to construct a scale
model or a scaled image of anything—in a hyperbolic world, a photograph would neces-
sarily distort the shape of its subject unless it were actual size.
Another way of interpreting the AAA congruence theorem is that it guarantees the
existence of an “absolute” standard of length, independent of any arbitrary conventions.
In Euclidean geometry, the distances given to us by the distance postulate are in a certain
sense arbitrary: we could multiply all distances by a positive constant c and all areas by c2,
and the theorems of Euclidean geometry would still be true with this new distance scale.
(This just corresponds to changing the units of our measuring scale, as from feet to meters.)
Thus if two remotely separated civilizations in a Euclidean universe wanted to agree on a
unit of length, they would have to rely on some physical phenomenon having the same
properties in both locations, such as the wavelength of light emitted from a certain kind of
atom.
However, in hyperbolic geometry things are very different. If our hypothetical civ-
ilizations lived in a hyperbolic world, they could simply agree that the universal unit of
length is, say, the side length of a 45ı-45ı-45ı triangle. (There always exists such a trian-
gle in hyperbolic geometry, although this is not easy to prove.) Because the AAA theorem
guarantees that all such triangles are congruent, there would be no ambiguity about what
this length is. (There is no ambiguity about what a 45ı angle is either, since it can be
described as an angle created by the bisector of a right angle, and a right angle in turn can
be described as any angle that forms a linear pair with a congruent angle.)
Here is one more consequence of the AAA congruence theorem; it shows another way
in which hyperbolic geometry differs markedly from Euclidean geometry.
Theorem 18.4. The postulates of hyperbolic geometry are not categorical.
Proof. Let M be a model of hyperbolic geometry (such as the Poincar´e disk). Choose any
positive real number c ¤ 1, and create a new model Mc by deﬁning the points, lines, and
angle measures to be the same as those of M but deﬁning distances in Mc to be c times
the corresponding distances in M.

To see that the models M and Mc cannot be isomorphic, begin by constructing an
isosceles right triangle 4ABC in M with legs of length 1 and right angle at C. (See Fig.
18.2. Such a triangle is easily constructed by drawing two perpendicular rays and marking
off a segment of length 1 along each of the rays.) We have no way of knowing what the
measures of its acute angles are, but we do know that they are equal (by the isosceles
triangle theorem) and less than 45ı (by the hyperbolic angle-sum theorem). Let  denote

340
18. Introduction to Hyperbolic Geometry
the common measure of †A and †B. Thus M contains an isosceles right triangle with
angle measures --90ı and legs of length 1.
Let 4A0B0C 0 denote the corresponding triangle in Mc. (It is actually the same trian-
gle, but with different side lengths.) Then our deﬁnition of Mc guarantees that 4A0B0C 0
has angle measures --90ı and legs of length c. Assume for contradiction that there is an
isomorphism F between M and Mc. If we let A00 D F.A/, B00 D F.B/, and C 00 D F.C/,
then by deﬁnition of an isomorphism, 4A00B00C 00 is an isosceles right triangle in Mc with
angle measures --90ı and legs of length 1. Then 4A0B0C 0 and 4A00B00C 00 are two
triangles in Mc that satisfy the AAA hypotheses but are not congruent, thus contradicting
the AAA congruence theorem.
□
Although the preceding theorem shows that there are nonisomorphic models of hyper-
bolic geometry, that is only part of the story. It is a fact (which we will not prove) that every
model of hyperbolic geometry is isomorphic to one of the models Mc that we constructed
above. Thus, in a sense, the axioms of hyperbolic geometry are categorical except for a
more or less arbitrary “scale factor.”
It is worth thinking about why this argument doesn’t work in the Euclidean case. Start-
ing with the Cartesian model M, we can certainly create a new model Mc by multiplying
all of the distances by a positive constant c. But these two models turn out to be isomor-
phic: an isomorphism F WM ! Mc can be deﬁned by letting F.x;y/ D .cx;cy/ for every
point .x;y/ in the model M. If we started with a different model M0 and multiplied its
distances by c to create a new model M0
c, this particular technique might not be available,
but Theorem 13.19 guarantees that there is some isomorphism from M0 to M0
c. A way to
visualize the situation is to imagine the ﬁrst model M as a large life-size painting and Mc
as a reproduction of that painting at a smaller scale. When you look at Mc, it’s impossible
to tell (without relying on external clues) whether you’re looking at the original painting
from far away or looking at the reduced reproduction from nearby. In hyperbolic geometry,
you would see the difference, because the reduction would necessarily distort angles and
therefore shapes of objects.
Saccheri and Lambert Quadrilaterals
After triangles, rectangles are probably the second most important ﬁgures in Euclidean
geometry. Since rectangles are nonexistent in hyperbolic geometry, it is natural to look for
other ﬁgures that might play analogous roles.
There are two obvious ways that one might attempt to construct a rectangle with-
out beneﬁt of the Euclidean parallel postulate, each of which leads to a useful class of
quadrilaterals in hyperbolic geometry. One way is to start with a segment AB, construct
congruent perpendicular segments AD and BC on the same side of
 !
AB (Fig. 18.3), and
join C and D to form a quadrilateral ABCD. The other is to start with two segments AB
and BC meeting perpendicularly at B, construct perpendiculars to them at A and C, and
let D be the point (if there is one) where the two perpendiculars meet (Fig. 18.4).
In Euclidean geometry, Theorem 10.27 would imply that the quadrilateral pictured in
Fig. 18.3 must be a rectangle, and the angle-sum theorem for quadrilaterals would imply
that the one pictured in Fig. 18.4 must be a rectangle. But in hyperbolic geometry, the
remaining angles cannot be right angles, because that would violate the hyperbolic angle-
sum theorem. Thus we make the following deﬁnitions. A Saccheri quadrilateral is a

quadrilateral with a pair of congruent opposite sides that are both perpendicular to a third
side, and a Lambert quadrilateral is a quadrilateral with three right angles.
Saccheri quadrilaterals are named after Giovanni Saccheri (whom we met in Chapter 1
and heard from again in the preceding chapter), and Lambert quadrilaterals are named after
the Swiss mathematician Johann Heinrich Lambert (1728–1777). Although the nomencla-
ture is well established in Western tradition, it is not historically accurate: both types of
quadrilaterals were studied many centuries earlier by Islamic mathematicians such as Omar
Khayyam.
When we draw ﬁgures in hyperbolic geometry, it is generally impossible to make all
the line segments appear straight while making all distances and angles appear correct,
simply because the plane in which we are drawing our pictures is a Euclidean plane (at
least to a very close approximation). We will generally attempt to make the angles look
correct and to make the lines look straight whenever possible. But sometimes lines have to
be drawn as curves in order to make the angles appear correct, and it is usually impossible
to make all distances appear correct. A useful way to visualize hyperbolic ﬁgures is in the
Poincar´e disk model (see Examples 2.16 and 6.12, in which all angles are correct but most
lines look like arcs of circles. Fig. 18.5 illustrates Saccheri and Lambert quadrilaterals in
the Poincar´e disk model. In these ﬁgures, the hyperbolic “lines” containing the sides are
shown as dashed lines or curves, to make it clear that each side is part of a diameter or a
circle intersecting the unit circle perpendicularly.
Fig. 18.5. Saccheri and Lambert quadrilaterals in the Poincar´e disk model.
For a Saccheri quadrilateral, we make the following deﬁnitions:
 The two congruent opposite sides are called the legs.
 The side perpendicular to the legs is called the base.
 The side opposite the base is called the summit.
 The two angles adjacent to the summit are called the summit angles.

342
18. Introduction to Hyperbolic Geometry
 The segment joining the midpoints of the summit and the base is called the midseg-
ment.
In a Lambert quadrilateral:
 The angle that is not a right angle is called the fourth angle.
 The vertex of the fourth angle is called the fourth vertex.
Here are a few elementary properties, whose proofs are left for you to carry out.
Theorem 18.5 (Properties of Saccheri Quadrilaterals). Every Saccheri quadrilateral
has the following properties:
(a) It is a convex quadrilateral.
(b) Its diagonals are congruent.
(c) Its summit angles are congruent and acute.
(d) Its midsegment is perpendicular to both the base and the summit.
(e) It is a parallelogram.
Proof. Exercise 18B.
□
Analogously, for Lambert quadrilaterals, we have the following properties.
Theorem 18.6 (Properties of Lambert Quadrilaterals). Every Lambert quadrilateral
has the following properties:
(a) It is a convex quadrilateral.
(b) Its fourth angle is acute.
(c) It is a parallelogram.
Proof. Exercise 18C.
□
There are also some important properties of Saccheri and Lambert quadrilaterals in-
volving comparisons between side lengths, but they are somewhat less elementary to prove.
The key is the following lemma.
Lemma 18.7 (Scalene Inequality for Quadrilaterals). Suppose ABCD is a quadrilat-
eral in which †A and †B are right angles. Then AD > BC if and only if m†D < m†C.

Proof. First assume that AD > BC (Fig. 18.6). Let E be the point in IntAD such that
AE D BC. Then ABCE is a Saccheri quadrilateral, so its summit angles (labeled †1
and †2 in the diagram) are congruent. By the exterior angle inequality, m†D < m†1,
and therefore m†D < m†2 by substitution. If we can show that
!

!

follows that m†2 < m†BCD (the whole angle is greater than the part), so by transitivity
m†D < m†BCD and we are done.
To show that

the interior of †DCB. It follows from the interior lemma that

CD . This
completes the proof that AD > BC implies m†D < m†C.
To prove the converse, assume that m†D < m†C. By trichotomy, we must have
AD < BC, AD D BC, or AD > BC. If AD < BC, then the preceding argument im-
plies m†D > m†C, which is a contradiction. Similarly, if AD D BC, then ABCD is a
Saccheri quadrilateral, and Theorem 18.5 implies that †D Š †C, again a contradiction.
The only remaining possibility is that AD > BC.
□
Theorem 18.8. In a Lambert quadrilateral, either side between two right angles is strictly
shorter than its opposite side.
Proof. Suppose ABCD is a Lambert quadrilateral with fourth vertex D. We need to
show that AD > BC and CD > AB. Since †D is acute by Theorem 18.6, it follows that
m†D < m†C, so Lemma 18.7 implies that AD > BC. The same argument with A and
C reversed shows that CD > AB.
□
There are also corresponding inequalities for Saccheri quadrilaterals, which can be
proved by using the fact that the midsegment of a Saccheri quadrilateral divides it into two
Lambert quadrilaterals.
Theorem 18.9. In a Saccheri quadrilateral, the base is strictly shorter than the summit,
and the midsegment is strictly shorter than either leg.
Proof. Exercise 18D.

Asymptotic Rays
In hyperbolic geometry, because there are two or more lines through a point that are par-
allel to a given line, it is natural to ask exactly how many parallels there are and how to
distinguish them from each other.
To get an idea of how to identify the different kinds of parallel lines, suppose that `
is a line and A is a point not on ` and that m and m0 are two distinct lines through A and
parallel to `. Now imagine a third line n going through A but free to rotate around A (Fig.
18.7). What will happen as the direction of n changes? Most people would guess correctly
that as n rotates from m to m0, it remains parallel to `. What happens when we rotate it past
m0? At some point in the rotation, the line has to start intersecting `. As we will see below,
as n rotates toward `, there is one last direction at which it is parallel to `, and any further

rotation results in a line that intersects `. Our main goal in this section is to understand
exactly what happens in that direction. It is useful to focus ﬁrst on rays starting at A.
If
!
AB and
!
CD are two rays, we say that
!
AB is asymptotic to
!
CD if all of the
following conditions are satisﬁed (see Fig. 18.8):
(i)
!
AB and

(iii) Every ray between

The idea is that as a ray rotates around A toward
!
CD , the direction of
!
AB is the last
direction in which the ray does not intersect
!
CD . (We are not claiming yet that there is
such a ray; we are just giving a name to such a ray in case it does exist.) We use the
notation

in the deﬁnition of asymptotic rays implies that these rays intersect
 !
AC only at their two
distinct endpoints, so X cannot be on

AC . If X is on the same side of
 !
AC as D and
B, then by Theorem 3.46 it must lie on both rays
!
AB and
!

property (ii).
The only remaining possibility is that X is on the opposite side of
 !
AC from B and D.
It follows that X is not in either ray

!
CD , so X AB and X C D. The exterior

Asymptotic Rays
347
Next we need to develop three important properties of asymptotic rays that we will use
later in our analysis of parallel lines: symmetry, endpoint independence, and transitivity.
The proofs of these three properties use only the deﬁnition, existence, and uniqueness of
asymptotic rays, together with some familiar facts from neutral geometry and the small
angle lemma; but they are rather detailed and technical, so on ﬁrst reading you might want
to read the theorem statements carefully but skim the proofs.
The ﬁrst property we need is a symmetry relation. Notice that the deﬁnition of asymp-
totic rays is asymmetric: in property (iii) of the deﬁnition of asymptotic rays,
!
AB and
!
CD
play very different roles. Nonetheless, as the next theorem shows, the relation “asymptotic
to” is reversible. This proof is rated PG.
Theorem 18.12 (Symmetry Property of Asymptotic Rays). Suppose
!
AB and
!
CD are
two distinct rays. Then
!
AB j
!
CD if and only if
!
CD j

AB .
Proof. It sufﬁces to prove that
!
AB j
!
CD implies
!
CD j
!
AB , because the argument is the
same in both directions. Assume
!
AB j

CD . It is immediate from our hypothesis that the
ﬁrst two conditions in the deﬁnition of
!

AB lie on the

To show that the third condition is satisﬁed, let

CA and
!
CD ,
and assume for the sake of contradiction that
!
CE does not intersect
!
AB (Fig. 18.13). Since
m†ECD is a positive number, the small angle lemma (Lemma 17.5) guarantees that there
is a point X 2
!
CE such that m†AXC < m†ECY . We need to verify that X is in the
interior of †BAC. On the one hand, the fact that
!
CE lies in the interior of †ACD implies
that X is on the same side of
 !
AC as D and hence also as B. On the other hand,
!
CE does
not intersect
!
AB by hypothesis, and it cannot intersect the ray opposite
!
AB because that
ray is on the wrong side of
 !
AC ; thus X is on the same side of
 !
AB as C. It follows that X
is in the interior of †BAC, so the assumption
!
AB j
!
CD implies that
!
AX intersects
!
CD
at a point Y . It follows from betweenness vs. betweenness that A  X  Y , and therefore
†AXC is an exterior angle for 4CXY . But by construction, †AXC is smaller than the
remote interior angle †ECY , which contradicts the exterior angle inequality.
□
The next theorem shows that if we start with a pair of asymptotic rays, then changing
the endpoint of one of them to another point on the same line does not change the fact that
they are asymptotic. (By the symmetry property we just proved, the same is true if we
change the endpoint of the other ray.) This proof is also rated PG.

AB .
The hypothesis implies that
!
CD and

and B lie on the same side of that line. On the other hand, the fact that

AC 0 

Now we need to show that the three deﬁning properties of asymptotic rays are satisﬁed

C 0D . To prove (i), note that
!
AC 
!
AC 0 
!
AB implies that B and C are on
opposite sides of
 !
AC 0 (Theorem 4.12). Also, D and C are on opposite sides of the same
line because C  C 0  D. Therefore B and D are on the same side of
 !
AC 0 , and the Y-
lemma then implies that
!
AB and
!
C 0D are on that side as well. Next, (ii) follows from
the fact that
!
AB and
!
C 0D are contained in the parallel lines
 !
AB and

CD . To prove (iii),
suppose
!
AX is any ray between

AB as C 0,
and the fact that m†BAX < m†BAC 0 < m†BAC implies that

AB 

AX 
!
AC by the

!
AX must intersect

CD because

!
AX
is on the same side of

AC 0 as B and thus also as D, the intersection point must in fact be

C 0D . This completes the proof of (iii) and shows that r j s0.
Conversely, assume

AC 0 

The hypothesis implies that B and D are on the same side of

that C and D are on opposite sides; thus B and C are on opposite sides of that line, which
means that †CAC 0 and †C 0AB are adjacent angles. Since all three rays

In keeping with the analogy between asymptotic triangles and ordinary triangles, we
make the following deﬁnitions. If @BACD is an asymptotic triangle, the segment AC is
called its ﬁnite edge, the angles †BAC and †ACD are called its angles or interior angles,
and the points A and C are called its vertices. Two asymptotic triangles are said to be
congruent if there is a correspondence between their vertices such that the corresponding
angles are congruent and the ﬁnite edges both have the same length. Thus @BACD Š
@B0A0C 0D0 means that †A Š †A0, †C Š †C 0, and AC Š A0C 0.
If @BACD is an asymptotic triangle, we deﬁne the angle sum and defect of @BACD,
denoted respectively by .@BACD/ and ı.@BACD/, to be the numbers
.@BACD/ D m†ACm†C;
ı.@BACD/ D 180.@BACD/:
An exterior angle of @BACD is any angle that forms a linear pair with either †A or †C
(see Fig. 18.21). Given an exterior angle, the interior angle that is not adjacent to it is
called the remote interior angle for that exterior angle.
There are many striking ways in which asymptotic triangles behave similarly to ordi-
nary triangles. In this section we will explore several of them. If we think of the missing
“angle” at inﬁnity as being a zero-degree angle, then the statements of these theorems
should not be too surprising.

Chapter 19
Parallel Lines in
Hyperbolic Geometry
In this chapter, we undertake a detailed analysis of parallel lines in hyperbolic geometry.
The key observation is that pairs of parallel lines fall into two distinct classes: two lines are
said to be asymptotically parallel if they are parallel and one of them contains a ray that is
asymptotic to a ray in the other; they are said to be ultraparallel if they are parallel but not
asymptotically parallel. If ` and m are lines, we will use the notation ` j m to mean that ` is
asymptotically parallel to m. (There is no standard notation for ultraparallel lines.) The no-
tation ` k m means simply that ` and m are parallel, so they could be either asymptotically
parallel or ultraparallel. Thanks to Theorem 18.10, any two lines that contain asymptotic
rays are automatically asymptotically parallel.
We will see that among all parallels to a given line through a given point, there are
exactly two lines that are asymptotically parallel to the given line, and these are “closest”
to the given line in a certain sense. All other parallel lines through the given point are
ultraparallel. In the Poincar´e disk model, asymptotically parallel lines are those that would
meet at a point on the boundary of the circle (if the boundary were included in the model),
while all other pairs of lines that don’t meet are ultraparallel (see Fig. 19.1).

19. Parallel Lines in Hyperbolic Geometry
Our main task in this chapter is to show that the two classes of parallel lines can be dis-
tinguished in three different ways. First, we will classify parallels to a given line ` through
a given point A not on ` in terms of the angles they make with the perpendicular from A to
`. Second, we will classify parallel lines according to whether they admit a common per-
pendicular or not: ultraparallel lines have a common perpendicular, while asymptotically
parallel lines do not. Finally, we will classify parallel lines in terms of the distance between
them: asymptotically parallel lines approach each other arbitrarily closely in one direction
(hence the designation “asymptotic”) and diverge in the other direction, while ultraparallel
lines diverge from each other in both directions.
Let us begin with a couple of lemmas that will simplify some of the arguments to
come. First we record a basic property of asymptotically parallel lines that follows from
endpoint independence of asymptotic rays.
Lemma 19.1. Suppose ` and m are asymptotically parallel lines. If A is any point on `
and C is any point on m, then one of the rays in ` starting at A is asymptotic to the ray in
m starting at C and lying on the same side of

Parallel Lines and Common Perpendiculars
359
In the situation of the theorem, there are two lines through A that are both asymptotically
parallel to `, but they are not asymptotically parallel to each other because they intersect at
A. The problem is that they contain rays that are asymptotic to different rays in `.
Parallel Lines and Common Perpendiculars
Our next main result in this chapter is a classiﬁcation of parallel lines according to whether
they admit a common perpendicular or not. A familiar feature of parallel lines in Euclidean
geometry is that they always have inﬁnitely many common perpendiculars, because any
line perpendicular to one of two parallel lines is also perpendicular to the second (Theorem
10.5). In hyperbolic geometry, common perpendiculars are much harder to come by. In
this section, we develop the tools for ﬁnding them.
Theorem 19.4 (Uniqueness of Common Perpendiculars). If ` and m are parallel lines
that admit a common perpendicular, then the common perpendicular is unique.
Proof. Assume for the sake of contradiction that ` and m are parallel lines with two distinct
common perpendiculars t and t0 (Fig. 19.7). If t and t0 meet ` at A and A0, respectively,
and they meet m at B and B0, then AA0B0B is a rectangle, which is impossible.

In fact, as we will see below, there exist parallel lines that admit no common perpen-
diculars. The next theorem gives a useful condition that is sufﬁcient to guarantee that a
common perpendicular exists.
Theorem 19.5. Suppose ` and m are parallel lines. If there are two distinct points on `
that are equidistant from m, then ` and m have a common perpendicular.

Proof. Suppose ` k m, and P and Q are distinct points on ` such that d.P;m/ D d.Q;m/
(Fig. 19.8). Because ` and m are parallel, P and Q lie on the same side of m. Let F and
G be the feet of the perpendiculars to m from P and Q, respectively. Then PQGF is
a trapezoid by the trapezoid lemma, and the assumption that d.P;m/ D d.Q;m/ implies
that it is a Saccheri quadrilateral. If MN is the midsegment of PQGF , then
 !
MN is
perpendicular to both ` and m by Theorem 18.5(d).
□
The next theorem and its proof are due to David Hilbert. The proof, which is rated R,
draws on most of the hyperbolic results we have proved so far.
Theorem 19.6 (Ultraparallel Theorem). Two distinct lines are ultraparallel if and only
if they admit a common perpendicular.
Proof. Let ` and m be two distinct lines. Assume ﬁrst that they admit a common perpen-
dicular t. Then they are parallel by the common perpendicular theorem, so they are either
ultraparallel or asymptotically parallel. Suppose they are asymptotically parallel. Let A
and C be the points where t meets m and `, respectively. By Lemma 19.1, there are points
B 2 m and D 2 ` such that

!
CD , and therefore @BACD is an asymptotic trian-
gle. But m†AC m†C D 180ı, which contradicts the angle-sum theorem for asymptotic
triangles. The only remaining possibility is that ` and m are ultraparallel.

m
Fig. 19.9. Lines with a common perpendicular must be ultraparallel.
Conversely, assume ` and m are ultraparallel. Let A and B be two distinct points on
m. Then A and B are on the same side of ` by Lemma 7.18. If A and B are equidistant
from `, then Theorem 19.5 shows that ` and m have a common perpendicular, and we are
done. Assume therefore that they are not equidistant; without loss of generality, we may
assume that d.A;`/ > d.B;`/. We will show that there are two other points on m that are
equidistant from `.
Let F and G be the feet of the perpendiculars from A to ` and from B to `, respec-
tively, and choose points X and Y such that AB X and F G Y (Fig. 19.10). Because
AF > BG, we can choose a point C in the interior of AF such that CF Š BG. Let
!r be
the ray starting at C, on the same side of
 !
AF as B, and making an angle with
!
CF that is
congruent to †GBX. We will show below that
!r intersects
!
AX at a point D. Accepting
this for the moment, we continue the proof as follows. Let E be the point on
!
BX such
that BE Š CD, and let K and L be the feet of the perpendiculars from D to ` and from
E to `, respectively. Since
 !
EL k
 !
BG by the common perpendicular theorem, L is on the
same side of
 !
BG as E, which is the opposite side from
 !
AF . In particular, this implies that
F G L. (We are not making any claims about which side of
 !
BG the points D and K
are on; we have pictured them on the same side as
 !
AF , but they might be on the other side
or even on
 !
BG . The proof works exactly the same in all three cases.)


362
19. Parallel Lines in Hyperbolic Geometry
Endpoint independence of asymptotic rays implies that
!v j
!
AX , and then the transitive
property of asymptotic rays implies that
!u j
!v , so @UFGV is an asymptotic triangle. The
exterior angle inequality for asymptotic triangles implies that m†4 > m†2. It follows
algebraically that the complements of these two angles satisfy the opposite inequality:
m†3 < m†1.
Because CF Š BG and †C Š †B, it follows from the SA congruence theorem that
@RCFS Š @XBGV . Thus m†5 D m†3, and by substitution, m†5 < m†1 as claimed.
From the ordering lemma for rays, we conclude that
!s is between
!u and

AX at a point Z. Consider now the intersection
of the line

r is parallel to

FZ and meets

AF only at C, it does
not contain any of the vertices A, F , or Z and does not meet FZ. Thus Pasch’s theorem
shows that

r intersects AZ. Because the ray
!r is the part of
 !
r on the same side of
 !
AF
as Z, the intersection must in fact be in the ray
!r . This proves that
!r intersects
!
AX and
thus completes the proof of the ultraparallel theorem.

Distances between Parallel Lines
Our ﬁnal way of classifying parallel lines is in terms of the distances between them. One
essential feature of parallel lines in Euclidean geometry is that they are equidistant. In
fact, many people think of equidistance as a deﬁning characteristic of parallel lines. In
hyperbolic geometry, things are very different, as we will see. In this section, we will
show that parallel lines are never equidistant and that asymptotically parallel lines and
ultraparallel lines behave very differently with respect to distance.
Our ﬁrst theorem shows that no two lines can be equidistant in hyperbolic geometry.
Theorem 19.7. Suppose ` and m are two different lines. No three distinct points on ` are
equidistant from m.
P
Q
R
F
G
H
`
m
Fig. 19.12. Two lines cannot have three equidistant points.
Proof. Let ` and m be distinct lines, and suppose P , Q, and R are three distinct points
on ` such that d.P;m/ D d.Q;m/ D d.R;m/. Without loss of generality, we may assume
that P Q R. Since ` and m are not the same line, these distances cannot all be zero, so
none of the points P;Q;R lies on m. At least two of them have to be on the same side of
m, so Theorem 7.23 implies that ` k m. Therefore all three points are on the same side of
m (because otherwise ` and m would have to intersect).
Let F , G, and H be the feet of the perpendiculars to m from P , Q, and R, respectively
(Fig. 19.12). Then PQGF , QRHG, and PRHF are all Saccheri quadrilaterals with bases

Distances between Parallel Lines
363
FG, GH, and FH, respectively. It follows that the two summit angles of each quadrilat-
eral are congruent: †FPQ Š †PQG, †GQR Š †QRH, and †FPQ Š †QRH. By
transitivity, therefore, †PQG Š †GQR. Since these two angles form a linear pair, they
are both right angles. But they are also summit angles of Saccheri quadrilaterals, so they
are acute. This is a contradiction.
□
Next we prove a simple lemma about distances between nonparallel lines: it says
that if two rays form an acute angle, then there are points on one ray that are arbitrarily
far from the other. This lemma is named after the Greek philosopher Aristotle (384–322
BCE), because he implicitly used it as part of an argument that the universe must have
ﬁnite size.1 The following proof is for the case of hyperbolic geometry; but this lemma
also holds in Euclidean geometry, with an easier proof (see Exercise 19B).
Lemma 19.8 (Aristotle’s Lemma). Suppose
!r and
!s are rays with the same endpoint
such that †rs is acute, and c is any positive real number. Then there is a point P 2
!r such
that d

P;
 !
s

> c.
Proof. Let O be the common endpoint of
!r and
!s , and let A be an arbitrary point in the
interior of
!r (Fig. 19.13). Let B be the point on
!r such that O  A  B and AB D OA.
Let F and G be the feet of the perpendiculars from A and B to
 !
s , respectively.
A
B
C
O
F
G
!r
!s
Fig. 19.13. Proof of Aristotle’s lemma.
Drop a perpendicular from B to
 !
AF , and call the foot C. Then C cannot be equal
to A, because then 4OAF would have two right angles; and C cannot lie in the interior
of
!
AF , because then the right triangle BAC would have an obtuse angle at A. It follows
that C A F and that 4ABC is a right triangle with right angle at C. Because †BAC
and †OAF are vertical angles, they are congruent, and therefore 4OAF Š 4BAC by
AAS. In particular, this means that CA D AF , and therefore CF D 2AF . Now CFGB
is a Lambert quadrilateral with its fourth vertex at B, and thus Theorem 18.8 implies that
BG > CF D 2AF . This shows that given any interior point A 2
!r , we can ﬁnd another
point B 2
!r whose distance from
 !
s is more than twice as large as that of A.
1Aristotle’s argument goes roughly like this [Ari39, Book 1, Part 5]: Assume the universe is
inﬁnitely large. Then any two rays emanating from the center of the earth must have inﬁnite length.
Because the distance between the rays becomes arbitrarily large as you go farther out, the distance
between their “ends” must be inﬁnite. Because the entire universe obviously(!) rotates about the
earth once each day, this means that the “ends” of the rays have to traverse an inﬁnite distance in a
ﬁnite amount of time, which is impossible.

364
19. Parallel Lines in Hyperbolic Geometry
Repeating the above construction, we can ﬁnd another point B0 2
!r whose distance is
more than twice that of B. After ﬁnitely many such constructions, we eventually obtain a
point P 2
!r whose distance from
 !
s is greater than c as claimed.
□
Aristotle’s lemma is the key ingredient in the proof of the following analogous lemma
about distances between parallel lines. It is rated PG.
Lemma 19.9. Suppose ` and m are parallel lines and
!r  ` is a ray that is not asymp-
totic to any ray in m. For any positive real number c, there is a point P 2

The following theorem shows that the distance between ultraparallel lines is smallest
where they meet the common perpendicular and increases without bound in both directions
from there.
Theorem 19.10. Suppose ` and m are ultraparallel lines and A is the point where ` meets
their common perpendicular.
(a) If B is any point on ` other than A, then d.B;m/ > d.A;m/.
(b) If B and C are points on ` such that AB C, then d.C;m/ > d.B;m/.
(c) Given any positive real number c, on each side of the common perpendicular there
exists a point P 2 ` such that d.P;m/ > c.

Proof. Let F be the foot of the perpendicular from A to m. To prove (a), let B be an
arbitrary point on ` that is distinct from A, and let G be the foot of the perpendicular from
B to m (Fig. 19.15). Then ABGF is a Lambert quadrilateral, so BG > AF by Theorem
18.8. This implies d.B;m/ > d.A;m/.
Next, to prove (b), suppose B and C are any two points on ` such that AB C, and
let G and H be the feet of the perpendiculars from ` to m. Because ABGF and ACHF
are both Lambert quadrilaterals, their fourth angles †ABG and †BCH are both acute.
Because †CBG forms a linear pair with †ABG, it is obtuse. Therefore, the scalene
inequality for quadrilaterals (Lemma 18.7) applied to BCHG implies that CH > BG,
which means that d.C;m/ > d.B;m/.
Finally, (c) follows immediately from Lemma 19.9 applied to either of the rays in `
starting at A.

Our ﬁnal theorem is analogous to the preceding one, but this time for asymptoti-
cally parallel lines. Among other things, it explains the geometric signiﬁcance of the term
“asymptotically parallel.” It shows that if ` and m are asymptotically parallel lines, then
the distance from ` to m decreases in the direction of their asymptotic rays and becomes
arbitrarily small, while it increases in the opposite direction and becomes arbitrarily large.
The proof is rated PG.

As was mentioned in Chapter 1, in the early 1700s, the Italian mathematician Gio-
vanni Saccheri set out to prove by contradiction that Euclid’s ﬁfth postulate follows from
the other four. To do so, he assumed that the Euclidean parallel postulate was false and
proceeded to prove a great many consequences of that assumption, which we now recog-
nize as theorems in hyperbolic geometry. At the end of his work, he arrived at a result
essentially equivalent to Theorem 19.11 above. He then wrote that this is “repugnant to the
nature of the straight line,” and concluded that therefore his original assumption must have
been false. This, of course, does not qualify as a contradiction, because he had not given
mathematical deﬁnitions for “repugnant” or “the nature of a straight line.” In 1733, he pub-
lished his work, triumphantly titled Euclides ab Omni Naevo Vindicatus (“Euclid Freed of
Every Flaw”) [Sac86]. If he had been prepared to recognize the signiﬁcance of his own
discovery instead of falling back at the last minute on his intuition regarding parallel lines,
he might have been credited as the originator of non-Euclidean geometry a century before
Bolyai, Lobachevsky, and Gauss.

Chapter 20
Epilogue: Where Do We Go
from Here?
In the preceding chapters, we have explored the roots of axiomatic geometry and have seen
some of the ways in which our knowledge of Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometries can
be placed on a ﬁrm axiomatic foundation. In this ﬁnal chapter, we take a step back to look
around at some of the other ways that geometry can be studied and used. Modern geometry
is a vast ﬁeld of study, with applications in almost every other ﬁeld of mathematics as well
as in countless areas of science and practical endeavors. Now that we have solid ground to
stand on, let’s take some time to see what we can see from here.
Solid Geometry
In addition to the plane geometry that we have studied in this book, most geometry
courses since the time of Euclid have also included a study of three-dimensional ﬁgures
(traditionally called “solid geometry”). Among the SMSG postulates, there are seven that
are speciﬁcally tailored for three-dimensional geometry (Postulates 5, 6, 7, 8, 10, 21, and
22 in Appendix C), and most high-school geometry courses include at least a short treat-
ment of three-dimensional geometry. Typical topics include intersection properties of lines
and planes in space and volumes and surface areas of geometric solids such as polyhedra,
cones, cylinders, and spheres.
We have focused our attention only on plane geometry, because all of the central ideas
and techniques of axiomatic geometry are already well illustrated in the study of geometry
in two dimensions. However, three-dimensional geometry has obvious practical applica-
tions, and now that you have become proﬁcient with the axiomatic approach to geometry,
you should ﬁnd it easy to apply these ideas to solid geometry.

20. Epilogue: Where Do We Go from Here?
Analytic Geometry and Calculus
Although the axiomatic method presented in this book is extremely efﬁcient for prov-
ing most of the basic properties of lines, angles, polygons, and circles that we have dis-
cussed, at some point it is necessary to go beyond these simple shapes. For physics, engi-
neering, computer graphics, art, and most mathematical applications, one needs to be able
to analyze more complicated geometric ﬁgures, starting with ellipses, parabolas, and hy-
perbolas and continuing with such specialized curves as logarithmic spirals, leminscates,
and catenaries. (If you don’t know what these are, they’re easy to look up online.) Al-
though some of these geometric ﬁgures can be studied within the axiomatic framework,
the complications grow rapidly and it soon ceases to be fun.
The invention of coordinate geometry by Descartes in the seventeenth century brought
powerful new tools to bear on geometric problems. From this point of view, all kinds of
curves can be treated in a uniﬁed way as solution sets to equations in two variables, so arbi-
trary geometric shapes can be studied just as easily as lines, angles, polygons, and circles.
The crowning achievement of the mathematicians who pursued this point of view was the
development of calculus, which provided systematic techniques for analyzing areas, arc
lengths, angle measures, shapes of curves, and much more. Many of these techniques
extend almost effortlessly to three dimensions or even more.
Because the postulates of Euclidean geometry are categorical, every model of Eu-
clidean geometry is isomorphic to the Cartesian model (see Theorem 13.19). Thus no gen-
erality is lost by focusing on the Cartesian model—any statements involving only points,
lines, distances, and angle measures that are true in the Cartesian model will be true in
every model of Euclidean geometry, and vice versa. For this reason, and because the tools
offered by the Cartesian model are so powerful, when mathematicians study any Euclidean
phenomena beyond the theorems discussed in this book, they almost invariably do so in
the context of the Cartesian model. (Axiomatic Euclidean geometry provides the under-
lying motivation for the deﬁnitions of the Cartesian model and remains the simplest way
to understand elementary facts about polygons and circles, so the work you have done in
studying this book has by no means been wasted!)
Spherical Geometry
This book has concentrated on Euclidean geometry and hyperbolic geometry, because
those are the geometries that can be studied efﬁciently using some variant of Euclid’s ax-
ioms. We mentioned in Chapter 1 that spherical geometry can be viewed (if you squint)
as an interpretation of the axiom system comprising Euclid’s ﬁrst four postulates plus the
elliptic parallel postulate. But we have not pursued spherical geometry axiomatically, be-
cause many of the neutral postulates (most notably the ruler postulate) would have to be
radically modiﬁed in order to hold on the sphere.
This is not to say, however, that spherical geometry is unimportant—after all, it is a
much better description of the large-scale geometry of the surface of the planet we live on
than either Euclidean or hyperbolic geometry, and the very word geometry descends from
the Greek word geometrein, meaning “to measure the earth.” Spherical geometry has vital
practical applications (such as navigation, mapmaking, astronomy, and global positioning
systems), as well as being a rich and fascinating area of study from a purely mathematical
point of view.

20. Epilogue: Where Do We Go from Here?
371
It is possible to revise some of the neutral postulates to obtain an axiomatic system
that describes the geometry of the sphere (one way to do this is described in [Gre08]).
But it is much more efﬁcient, and much more powerful, to approach spherical geometry
analytically. Because a sphere can be modeled as a certain subset of R3, all of the tools of
three-dimensional analytic geometry and calculus are available. Using these techniques,
it is possible to prove many theorems analogous to the ones we have proved in the Eu-
clidean setting, such as results about distances and angles, spherical triangles (all of which
have angle sums greater than 180ı), areas, and arc lengths. There is an entire branch of
trigonometry called spherical trigonometry, which studies the relationships between side
lengths and angle measures in spherical triangles.
Further Topics in Hyperbolic Geometry
In hyperbolic geometry, in contrast with spherical geometry, the axiomatic approach
can take us somewhat farther. As you have seen in Chapters 18–19, it is possible to carry
out a detailed qualitative analysis of the theory of parallel lines, for example. However, as
soon as one attempts to address more quantitative questions, such as angle sums of speciﬁc
triangles or circumferences of circles or areas or trigonometric relationships, the axiomatic
approach quickly becomes bogged down.
Much more can be done than we have attempted. In particular, one hyperbolic phe-
nomenon that is of central importance but that we have not treated is area. To treat area
axiomatically in the hyperbolic setting, one need only introduce an area postulate analo-
gous to our Euclidean area postulate. The deﬁnition of an area function makes perfectly
good sense in hyperbolic geometry. However, the requirement that unit squares have area
1 obviously does not make sense, because there are no squares in hyperbolic geometry.
So what should take the place of this property? We could pick some arbitrary ﬁgure and
assign area 1 to it, such as a 45ı-45ı-45ı triangle; but why that ﬁgure and not some other?
This turns out to be a rather deep question, and studying it leads to new insights into
hyperbolic geometry. It turns out, surprisingly, that we have already seen an area function
in hyperbolic geometry. Recall from Chapter 17 that the defect of a polygon is the differ-
ence between the expected angle sum in Euclidean geometry and its actual angle sum. It
is immediate from the deﬁnitions that congruent polygons have the same defect, and the
defect addition theorem shows that defects add like areas, at least in the special case of a
convex simple region cut into two by a chord. From here, it is relatively straightforward
to extend the deﬁnition of defect to general polygonal regions and prove that it actually
satisﬁes the two deﬁning properties of an area function.
So defect is an area function, but are there any others? Well, yes: it is easy to check
that any constant multiple of the defect is also an area function. (Remember, so far we have
not insisted that the area function must give a particular result for any speciﬁc region.)
Here is the amazing fact: in hyperbolic geometry, every area function is a constant
multiple of the defect. This is quite messy to prove from the axioms, which is why we have
not done so; but if you are interested, you can ﬁnd a complete proof in [MP91].
Thus, in each model of hyperbolic geometry, there are lots of area functions, but they
are just constant multiples of each other. That still leaves open the question of which
constant is appropriate. Given that hyperbolic geometry possesses a natural length scale
(as described in Chapter 18 after the proof of the AAA congruence theorem), one might
expect that there should be a natural choice of units for measuring area too. There is, but it

372
20. Epilogue: Where Do We Go from Here?
is not completely straightforward to describe. It can be shown that very small hyperbolic
triangles have very small defects and therefore look very much like Euclidean triangles.
(This is a familiar phenomenon in spherical geometry as well: on the scale of a city block,
for example, triangles on the surface of the earth have angle sums that are practically
indistinguishable from 180ı.) Thus as the side lengths of triangles get smaller, their defects
approach zero. A reasonable requirement for an area function, therefore, is that the areas of
small triangles should be very close to the the area that the Euclidean area formula would
give, 1
2.base/.height/.
In any model of hyperbolic geometry, for each positive real number s there exists an
isosceles right triangle with legs of length s. (Just choose points on two perpendicular lines
at a distance s from the intersection point.) All such triangles with the same leg lengths
are congruent by SAS, so they have the same defect; let ı.s/ denote the defect of any such
right triangle. In Euclidean geometry, such a triangle would have area equal to 1
2s2. This is
not the case in hyperbolic geometry, but it can be shown that in every model of hyperbolic
geometry, the following limit exists:
k D lim
s!0
1
2s2
ı.s/:
(20.1)
With this choice of k, a natural deﬁnition of area in hyperbolic geometry is given by the
defect formula:
˛.P / D k ı.P /:
Then (20.1) guarantees that for small isosceles right triangles, the area is better and better
approximated by 1
2s2. Note that different models of hyperbolic geometry (corresponding
to different constant multiples of the distance) will give different values of k.
This formula has lots of interesting consequences. One of the most striking is that
in any model of hyperbolic geometry, there is a universal upper bound on the areas of
triangles: since defects of triangles are always less than 180ı by deﬁnition, it follows from
the defect formula that the area of every triangle is less than 180k.
Transformational Geometry
To the ancient Greeks, there was but one geometry: it was the science of shape, and it
described the absolute, eternal, true relationships among shapes in the real world. As our
understanding of the foundations of geometry (and mathematics) has deepened, we have
seen our conception of geometry evolve to encompass ever more varied kinds of geometry:
the Cartesian plane, hyperbolic geometry, spherical geometry, ﬁnite incidence geometries,
to name a few. The variety is fascinating, but it makes one yearn for a uniﬁed framework
in which to understand them all.
One approach to such a uniﬁcation is based on the notion of transformations of the
plane, which are just bijective maps from the plane to itself. These include as an im-
portant special case the rigid motions described in Appendix I: bijective maps from the
plane to itself that preserve all relevant geometric properties (angle measures, betweenness,
collinearity, and distances). As Appendix I shows, in neutral geometry one can postulate
the existence of certain rigid motions as an alternative to the SAS postulate.
Whichever approach is taken to the axioms, rigid motions form a fascinating subject of
study in their own right. They also lead naturally to a study of symmetry: in any geometry,
one can deﬁne a symmetry of a geometric ﬁgure to be a rigid motion that takes the ﬁgure

20. Epilogue: Where Do We Go from Here?
373
to itself. For example, a Euclidean square has rotational symmetries about its center and
reﬂection symmetries across its diagonals. The set of all symmetries of a given ﬁgure
forms a structure known as a group and is called the symmetry group of the object. In
general, a group is a set of unspeciﬁed objects endowed with a “multiplication” operation
that is associative but not necessarily commutative, that has an identity, and such that each
object has an inverse. Groups are one of the main topics in the mathematical ﬁeld known
as abstract algebra. For symmetry groups, the “multiplication” is actually composition
of symmetries, the identity is the transformation that takes every point to itself, and the
inverse of any symmetry is the transformation that “undoes” the symmetry by taking every
point back to where it started.
The study of transformations has become quite popular in geometry courses in North
American secondary schools, and most such courses include some treatment of rigid mo-
tions and symmetries regardless of whether the axiom system is based on the SAS postulate
or the reﬂection postulate.
In the late nineteenth century, shortly after the discovery of hyperbolic geometry, the
German mathematician Felix Klein (whose name adorns the Beltrami–Klein model of hy-
perbolic geometry) suggested a unifying framework for understanding all of the geometries
that were known at the time (Euclidean, hyperbolic, and spherical geometries, among oth-
ers), based on a generalization of rigid motions. He observed that for each of the known
geometries, the set of all rigid motions forms a group, called the symmetry group of the ge-
ometry, and the symmetry groups of the different geometries have very different algebraic
properties. In an inﬂuential paper originally published in 1872 [Kle93], Klein proposed
using the symmetry groups themselves as a unifying principle for classifying geometries.
Thus we now deﬁne a Klein geometry to be a set of “points” together with a group of bijec-
tive maps from that set to itself, called symmetries of the geometry, with the property that
given any two points in the set, there is a symmetry that takes one to the other. Euclidean,
hyperbolic, and spherical geometries can all be viewed as Klein geometries, as can many
others. This approach to unifying geometries is now known as the Erlangen program,
because Erlangen, Germany, is where Klein originally published his proposal.
The Erlangen program did not turn out to be the basis for the grand uniﬁcation of
geometry that Klein had hoped it would be; that honor went to differential geometry, de-
scribed below. However, the mathematical philosophy that Klein espoused—characterizing
a mathematical subject in terms of the properties preserved by a group of symmetries—has
become enormously inﬂuential and pervades most ﬁelds of mathematics today.
Diﬀerential Geometry
Klein’s proposal did not become the universal organizing principle for geometry as
he had hoped, primarily because mathematicians soon realized that there were even more
general notions of geometry that did not ﬁt into the Klein program because they were not
sufﬁciently uniform. For example, although spherical geometry provides a good approxi-
mate model for the surface of the earth, it breaks down at a certain level of detail because
the earth is not perfectly round. There is another more general framework that subsumes
Klein geometries and opens the door to much more general geometries.
To understand what it is, it is worth going back to the time of Gauss, one of the original
discoverers of non-Euclidean geometry. Around the same time as he was exploring non-
Euclidean geometry, in a completely separate series of investigations, Gauss had been

374
20. Epilogue: Where Do We Go from Here?
using the tools of calculus to study the geometric properties of curves and surfaces and
had developed some highly sophisticated techniques for the purpose. (It apparently didn’t
occur to him to make the connection between his surface investigations and non-Euclidean
geometry.)
Gauss’s techniques were reﬁned and generalized by successive generations of mathe-
maticians and gradually coalesced into a systematic framework for studying geometry in
just about any guise in which it might manifest itself. That framework is known as dif-
ferential geometry. It uses the tools of calculus to study shapes of curves, surfaces, and
their higher-dimensional analogues. It is possible to use differential geometry to construct
models of Euclidean geometry, hyperbolic geometry, spherical geometry, as well as every
Klein geometry, and to compare them and classify them. Most of the theorems of hyper-
bolic geometry that we have mentioned but not proved, such as the defect formula for area,
can be proved straightforwardly using the tools of differential geometry.
Forty years after the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry, Beltrami used differential
geometry to construct models of hyperbolic geometry and to show that his models were
all isomorphic to each other. Using these tools, one can also show that, although the
axioms for hyperbolic geometry are not categorical, the only ﬂexibility is the one we have
already discussed: given any two models of hyperbolic geometry, it is always possible to
ﬁnd a positive constant c such that if the distances in one model are all multiplied by c,
then the models are isomorphic. This is very similar to spherical geometry—two spheres
of different radii are nonisomorphic geometries, but it is always possible to multiply the
distances in one model by a constant so that they become isomorphic.
Thus a reasonable next step for those who want to continue their study of geometry
toward the frontiers of modern research is to look into differential geometry. A good
place to start at the undergraduate level is the book [dC76], which treats the differential
geometry of curves and surfaces. There you will ﬁnd the tools you need to make a deep
study of spherical geometry, to construct all of the various models of hyperbolic geometry
and understand the relationships among them, and much more. Don’t stop here—a vast
world of geometry awaits your exploration!

Appendix A
Hilbert’s Axioms
David Hilbert ﬁrst published his axiomatic system for Euclidean geometry in 1899, and
then he repeatedly revised it thereafter. The list below is based on the tenth German edition
of Hilbert’s book, using the 1971 translation by Leo Unger [Hil71] (slightly edited to use
more familiar notation and terminology).
In Hilbert’s axiomatic system, the primitive objects are point, line, and plane; and the
primitive relations are lies on, between, and congruent.
Group I: Axioms of Incidence
I.1 For every two points A;B there exists a line that contains each of the points A;B.
I.2 For every two points A;B there exists no more than one line that contains each of the
points A;B.
I.3 There exist at least two points on each line. There exist at least three points that do
not lie on any line.
I.4 For any three points A;B;C that do not lie on the same line, there exists a plane P
that contains each of the points A;B;C. For every plane, there exists a point which
it contains.
I.5 For any three points A;B;C that do not line on one and the same line, there exists no
more than one plane that contains each of the three points A;B;C.
I.6 If two points of a line ` lie in a plane P , then every point of ` lies in the plane P .
I.7 If two planes P , Q have a point A in common, then they have at least one more point
B in common.
I.8 There exist at least four points which do not lie in a plane.
Group II: Axioms of Order
II.1 If a point B lies between a point A and a point C, then the points A;B;C are three
distinct points of a line, and B then also lies between C and A.

AC such
that C lies between A and B.
II.3 Of any three points on a line, there exists no more than one that lies between the other
two.
II.4 Let A;B;C be three points that do not lie on a line, and let ` be a line in the plane
ABC which does not meet any of the points A;B;C. If the line ` passes through a
point of the segment AB, it also passes through a point of the segment AC or through
a point of the segment BC.
Group III: Axioms of Congruence
III.1 If A;B are two points on a line ` and A0 is a point on the same line or on another
line `0, then it is always possible to ﬁnd a point B0 on a given ray of `0 starting at A0
such that AB Š A0B0.
III.2 If segments A0B0 and A00B00 are congruent to the same segment AB, then A0B0 and
A00B00 are congruent to each other.
III.3 On a line `, let AB and BC be two segments which, except for B, have no points in
common. Furthermore, on the same line or another line `0, let A0B0 and B0C 0 be two
segments which, except for B0, have no points in common. In that case, if AB Š A0B0
and BC Š B0C 0, then AC Š A0C 0.
III.4 Let †rs be an angle in a plane P and `0 a line in a plane P 0, and let a deﬁnite side
of `0 in P 0 be given. Let
!
r0 be a ray on `0 starting at a point O0. Then there exists in
the plane P 0 one and only one ray
!
s0 such that †r0s0 Š †rs and at the same time all
the interior points of †r0s0 lie on the given side of `0.
III.5 (SAS) If for two triangles 4ABC and 4A0B0C 0 the congruences AB Š A0B0,
AC Š A0C 0, and †BAC Š †B0A0C 0 hold, then the congruence †ABC Š †A0B0C 0
is also satisﬁed.
Group IV: Axiom of Parallels
IV.1 (EUCLID’S AXIOM) Let ` be any line and A a point not on it. Then there is at most
one line in the plane determined by ` and A that passes through A and does not
intersect `.
Group V: Axioms of Continuity
V.1 (ARCHIMEDES’ AXIOM) If AB and CD are any segments, then there exists a num-
ber n such that n copies of CD constructed contiguously from A along the ray
!
AB
will pass beyond the point B.
V.2 (LINE COMPLETENESS) An extension of a set of points on a line with its order and
congruence relations that would preserve the relations existing among the original
elements as well as the fundamental properties of line order and congruence that
follow from Axiom Groups I–III and from Axiom V.1 is impossible.

Appendix B
Birkhoﬀ’s Postulates
These postulates are taken from the 1932 article A set of postulates for plane geometry,
based on scale and protractor, by George D. Birkhoff [Bir32]. In Birkhoff’s system, the
primitive terms are point, line, distance, and angle.
Postulate I (The Postulate of Line Measure). The points A;B;::: of any line ` can be
put into one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers x so that jxB xAj D d.A;B/
for all points A;B.
Postulate II (The Point-Line Postulate). One and only one straight line ` contains two
given points P;Q (P ¤ Q).
Postulate III (The Postulate of Angle Measure). The half-lines `;m;::: through any
point O can be put into one-to-one correspondence with the real numbers a.mod 2/
so that, if A ¤ O and B ¤ O are points on ` and m, respectively, the difference am 
al .mod 2/ is †AOB. Furthermore, if the point B on m varies continuously in a line r
not containing the vertex O, the number am varies continuously also.
Postulate IV (The Similarity Postulate). If in two triangles, 4ABC, 4A0B0C 0, and for
some constant k > 0, d.A0;B0/ D kd.A;B/, d.A0;C 0/ D kd.A;C/, and also †B0A0C 0 D

Appendix C
The SMSG Postulates
These axioms, published in the 1961 textbook [SMSG] by the School Mathematics Study
Group, form the basis for most axiom systems used in U.S. high-school geometry texts
today. In the SMSG axiom system, the primitive terms are point, line, and plane.
Postulate 1. Given any two distinct points there is exactly one line that contains them.
Postulate 2 (Distance Postulate). To every pair of distinct points there corresponds a
unique positive number. This number is called the distance between the two points.
Postulate 3 (Ruler Postulate). The points of a line can be placed in a correspondence
with the real numbers such that:
1. To every point of the line there corresponds exactly one real number.
2. To every real number there corresponds exactly one point of the line.

Appendix E
The Language
of Mathematics
In this appendix, we describe in some detail the language mathematicians use to express
theorems and their proofs. After the discovery of non-Euclidean geometry prompted a
reevaluation of the way mathematical terminology was used by Euclid and other mathe-
matical writers (see Chapter 1), mathematicians realized that the language we use to state
theorems and construct their proofs must have a precise, unambiguous meaning. Over
the past hundred years or so, mathematicians have developed a system of conventions for
expressing mathematical ideas, which is designed to minimize the possibility of ambiguity.
The purpose of this appendix is to describe the “grammar” for constructing and in-
terpreting mathematical arguments. As we do so, it is good to bear in mind that our
discussion about mathematical statements and their logic is not itself a rigorous mathe-
matical discussion—in particular, we are not going to try to treat mathematical logic itself
as an axiomatic system. (It can be done, but that’s another subject entirely.) This means
that some of the terms we use to describe statements will not get rigorous deﬁnitions and
the claims we make about the validity of mathematical deductions will not get rigorous
proofs. Instead, we will describe the rules for constructing and interpreting mathematical
statements and appeal to common sense and everyday experience with logical reasoning to
justify them.
Simple Statements
The basic building blocks of mathematical proofs are mathematical statements. These
are assertions of facts about “mathematical objects”—things like numbers, points, lines,
vectors, sets, functions, angles, triangles—the usual ﬂora and fauna of mathematical dis-
course.
Most importantly, a mathematical statement must be unambiguous, and it must be
either true or false, but not both. (For any particular statement, we might not know whether
it is true or false, but it must in principle be one or the other.) Thus an English sentence such
383

384
E. The Language of Mathematics
as “This statement is false” cannot be considered as a mathematical statement, because if it
were true, we would have to conclude that it was false; and if it were false, we would have
to conclude that it was true. Similarly, “The number 42 is interesting” cannot be considered
as a mathematical statement unless we are prepared to give an unambiguous deﬁnition of
the concept of an “interesting number.”
Mathematical statements can be wonderfully complex, but the complicated ones are
all built up in a systematic way from simpler ones. The basic building blocks are simple
statements (also called atomic statements), which are ones that cannot be expressed as
combinations of smaller statements. They can be written using mathematical symbols, or
words in English (or some other natural language), or some combination of the two. Here
are some examples of simple statements (in these examples, we assume that a, b, and c
represent speciﬁc real numbers; A, B, and C represent points; and ` and m represent lines):
 2C2 D 4.
 0 < 1.
 sin D 0.
  D 3.
 a 2 R.
 ` ? m.
 A lies on `.
 b C
p
b2 4ac
2a
D 5.
 a is positive.
 †ABC is acute.
 †ABC is a right angle.
Simple mathematical statements typically come in two basic types. The ﬁrst type
expresses a mathematical relationship between two mathematical objects. Some of the
mathematical objects that appear in the sentences above are 2C 2, 4, 0, 1, , sin, a, R,
`, m, A, and †ABC. The “verb” in such a statement is a mathematical relation, such as
“equals” (D), “is less than” (<), “is an element of ” (2), “is perpendicular to” (?), or “lies
on” (no symbol). All the sentences above except the last three are of this type.
The other type of simple statement has “is” as its verb and expresses the fact that a
particular mathematical object has a particular property (such as “acute” or “positive”) or
is a particular type of object (such as a “right angle”). The last three sentences are of this
type.
Notice that not all of the statements in the list above are true—for example, the state-
ment “ D 3” is patently false; while we do not know if the last seven statements are
true until we are told what the letters a;b;c;`;m;A;B;C stand for. However, once par-
ticular values for all of these letters are chosen, they are all perfectly good mathematical
statements regardless of whether they are true or false.

Logical Connectives
385
Logical Connectives
To express more complicated mathematical thoughts, we can combine simple statements
together to create compound statements: these are statements built up from simple state-
ments using logical connectives, which are words that function somewhat like grammatical
conjunctions in the structure of mathematical statements. There are ﬁve basic logical con-
nectives: and, or, not, implies, and if and only if.
Conjunctions
The easiest logical connective to understand is and. If P and Q are any mathemati-
cal statements whatsoever, then “P and Q” is another mathematical statement, called the
conjunction of P and Q. It is sometimes symbolized by P ^ Q. For example, we might
combine the ﬁrst two statements in our list above to form the statement “2 C 2 D 4 and
0 < 1.”
Whether a conjunction is true or not depends only on whether the individual statements
that are being combined are true. As the wording suggests, the conjunction “P and Q” is
true when P and Q are both true, and it is false otherwise. This rule is summarized in a
display called a truth table. Such a table lists every possible combination of truth values of
the individual statements P and Q, together with the resulting truth value of the compound
statement “P and Q.” Here is the truth table for “and”:
P
Q
P ^ Q
T
T
T

F
F

(E.1)
Although logical symbols like “^” are useful for analyzing the structure of mathe-
matical logic, when mathematicians write mathematical statements in English (as we ordi-
narily do when writing up proofs for human consumption), it is customary to avoid logical
symbols and write out the logical connectives using English words. Conjunctions are usu-
ally written using the word “and”; but there are a few other ways they can be expressed,
some of which might not at ﬁrst appear to be conjunctions. All of the following sentences
express the conjunction of the two statements “a is a positive number” and “a < 10”; in
each case, the italicized word(s) convey the same mathematical meaning as and:
 a is a positive number and a < 10.
 a is a positive number in addition to being less than 10.
 a is a positive number such that a < 10.
 a is a positive number but a < 10.
 a is a positive number less than 10.
(As the last example shows, sometimes there is not any word at all that explicitly marks a
sentence as a conjunction.)

386
E. The Language of Mathematics
Disjunctions
The next logical connective is or. If P and Q are mathematical statements, then “P
or Q” is a mathematical statement, called the disjunction of P and Q. It is symbolized
by P _ Q.
Before we describe the mathematical meaning of a disjunction, let’s look at the way
“or” is used in everyday speech. In ordinary English, “or” might be interpreted in different
ways, depending on the context: most often it is interpreted as exclusive or, which means
“one or the other, but not both”; while other times it is interpreted as inclusive or, meaning
“one or the other or both.” For example, if you’re eating at Joe’s diner and Joe tells you,
“The sandwich comes with soup or salad,” you will understand immediately that you can
have one or the other, but not both. On the other hand, if you’re applying for a job and
Joe says, “You need to have a high-school diploma or two years’ experience,” you will
understand equally well that it is ﬁne if you have both.
For mathematical statements, this kind of ambiguity and dependence on context will
not do. In order to interpret a sentence like “a is an integer or a < 10” as a mathematical
statement, we must be able to agree on an unambiguous, well-deﬁned meaning that de-
pends only on the truth or falsity of the simple statements that make it up (“a is an integer”
and “a < 10”), not on the context in which it’s written.
For these reasons, mathematicians have agreed on the convention that the word “or”
in a mathematical statement always means inclusive or. Thus if P and Q are statements,
then “P or Q” is a statement that is true if P is true or if Q is true or if both are true; and
otherwise it is false. Its precise meaning is captured in the following truth table:
P
Q
P _ Q
T
T
T
T
F
T
F
T
T
F
F
F
There are only two common ways of expressing disjunctions in English sentences:
 a is an integer or a < 10.
 Either a is an integer or a < 10.
Note that the addition of “either” does not change the fact that the “or” in a mathematical
statement is an inclusive or. If you want to express exclusive or in a mathematical context,
the only way to do so is to say explicitly what you mean: “a is an integer or a < 10, but
not both.”
In the strict grammar of mathematical statements, logical connectives such as “and”
and “or” can be used only to connect statements, not to connect mathematical objects,
properties, or relations. In an English sentence, we might say “a is positive or zero,” but
to analyze that sentence we have to recognize it as a disjunction in which two complete
statements are joined by “or”: “either a is positive or a is zero.” Similarly, equations
involving the “plus or minus” symbol are secretly disjunctions: the statement x D ˙1
really means “either x D C1 or x D 1.”

Logical Connectives
387
Negation
The third logical connective is the word not; it is in some ways the simplest, but it can
present surprising challenges. If P is a mathematical statement, then “not P ,” symbolized
by :P (or 
P in some books), is also a mathematical statement, called the negation of
P. It is false when P is true and true when P is false, as summarized in this truth table:
P
:P
T
F
F
T
When writing mathematical statements in English, we usually express the negation
of a statement by inserting the word “not” at a grammatically appropriate place in the
sentence; but when necessary, it can also be expressed by preceding the sentence with a
negating phrase such as “it is not the case that . . . .” The negation of a symbolic relation
(like D, <, or 2) is usually expressed by placing a slash through the relation symbol (as in
¤, –, or …). Each of the following sentences expresses the negation of “a is equal to 0”:
 a is not equal to 0.
 a ¤ 0.
 It is not the case that a D 0.
 It is not true that a D 0.
 It is false that a D 0.
Negation is easy to understand when it is applied to a simple statement; but when it is
applied to a compound statement, things can get complicated. It is important to know how
to simplify the negations of compound statements.
To negate a conjunction P ^ Q, we just look at the truth table (E.1) to see that P ^ Q
is false whenever P is false or Q is false or both are false. This suggests that the negation
of “P and Q” should have the same truth values as “not P or not Q.” The following truth
table shows that this is indeed the case:
P

P ^ Q
:.P ^ Q/

Thus wherever the negation of a statement such as “P and Q” occurs, we can freely replace
it with the statement “not P or not Q.” A similar analysis shows that the negation of P _ Q
has the same truth value as :P ^ :Q:
P

:.P _ Q/

In brief, the negation of a conjunction is the disjunction of the negations, and the negation
of a disjunction is the conjunction of the negations.

388

Of course, we can also negate a negation. Because every statement is either true or
false but not both, the negation of a negated statement has the same truth value as the
original statement. That is, :.:P / has the same truth value as P , as the following truth
table shows:

Conditional Statements
The most important logical connective in mathematics is implies. If P and Q are math-
ematical statements, then “P implies Q” is a mathematical statement, symbolized by
P ) Q (or, in some books, P ! Q). The expression “If P , then Q” means exactly
the same thing. Any such compound statement is called an implication or a conditional
statement. In the conditional statement P ) Q, the statement P is called the hypothesis,
and Q is called the conclusion.
In everyday English, the words “implies” and “if/then” carry many shades of meaning,
such as causation or temporal proximity, that would be difﬁcult or impossible to interpret
in the bright unambiguous light of mathematics. When the veterinarian says, “If your cat
has eaten poison, then she will die,” you will probably understand that the vet is express-
ing a causal relationship (as well as a short time span) between the hypothesis and the
conclusion. Contrast this with the sentence “If your cat is white, then she will die.” A
(perhaps slightly pedantic) case can be made that this sentence is true, because if your cat
does happen to be white, then it certainly is the case that she will die, just because all cats
die. However, under ordinary circumstances, most people would probably consider this
statement to be nonsense, because there is no relationship between the hypothesis and the
conclusion; and some might even consider it to be false for this reason.
In formal mathematical discourse, if we want to interpret “implies” as a logical con-
nective, then we must be prepared to give a deﬁnite truth value to the statement P ) Q
whenever P and Q are two mathematical statements, and that truth value must depend
only on the truth values of P and Q. The clearest way to see what that truth value should
be is to consider the circumstances under which we would consider a conditional statement
to be false. Suppose a teacher says to a class, “If you scored higher than 95% on the exam,
then you got an A.” When they look at their papers, here is what the ﬁrst four students ﬁnd:
 Alice scored 99% on the exam and got an A.
 Bob scored 85% on the exam and got a B.
 Carmela scored 94% on the exam and got an A.
 Duane scored 100% on the exam and got a B.
Alice and Bob would certainly believe that the teacher was telling the truth: in Alice’s case,
the hypothesis is true and the conclusion is true, while in Bob’s case they are both false.
In Carmela’s case, the hypothesis is false, but the conclusion is true nonetheless; Carmela
might be pleasantly surprised, but she would have no reason to think the teacher was not
telling the truth, because the teacher said nothing about what would happen to someone
who did not score higher than 95%. But Duane’s case is different: the hypothesis is true
(he scored higher than 95%), but the conclusion is false (he did not get an A), and he will

Conditional Statements
389
indignantly conclude that the teacher’s statement is false. The inescapable inference is this:
the only time a conditional statement is clearly false is when the hypothesis is true but the
conclusion is false.
To ensure that every mathematical statement has an unambiguous meaning, mathe-
maticians have agreed to interpret every conditional statement in this way: if P and Q are
statements, then the conditional statement P ) Q is false in the case that P is true and
Q is false; in all other cases, the conditional statement is true. This is summarized in the
following truth table:
P
Q
P ) Q
T
T
T
T
F
F
F
T
T
F

T
(E.2)
This can lead to some unexpected interpretations. For example, the following mathematical
statements are silly, but they are all true:
 If
p
2 D 1, then
p
2 > 100.
 If
p
2 > 100, then  > 3.
 If  > 3, then
p
2 ¤ 1.
(You should convince yourself that each of these statements is true by using the truth table
above.) Of course, it would be hard to conceive of a situation in which a mathematician
would write statements like these (other than as illustrations of how to interpret conditional
statements); but the fact that each of them has an unambiguous interpretation as a true
statement turns out to be of great importance in ensuring that our logic is sound. We will
revisit this issue later in this appendix.
In English sentences, there is a wide variety of ways of expressing conditional state-
ments. All of the following English sentences mean the same thing:
 If a is negative, then a < 1.
 a being negative implies a < 1.
 Assuming a is negative, it follows that a < 1.
 Given that a is negative, a < 1.
 Suppose a is negative; then a < 1.
 Whenever a is negative, a < 1.
 Provided that a is negative, a < 1.
 a being negative is a sufﬁcient condition for a < 1.
 For a to be negative, a necessary condition is that a < 1.
In every one of these statements, the hypothesis is “a is negative,” and the conclusion is
a < 1. Pay special attention to the last two sentences: in sentences like these, the sufﬁcient
condition is always the hypothesis (the hypothesis is sufﬁcient to ensure that the conclusion
is true), while the necessary condition is the conclusion (if the hypothesis is true, it is
necessary that the conclusion also be true).
The hypothesis does not need to come ﬁrst.
All of the statements above can be
rephrased so that the conclusion is stated ﬁrst; it is the key words such as “if ” and “given”

390
E. The Language of Mathematics
that signal the hypothesis, not the word order. All of the following sentences also mean “If
a is negative, then a < 1”:
 a < 1 if a is negative.
 a < 1 is implied by a being negative.
 a < 1, assuming that a is negative.
 a < 1 given that a is negative.
 a < 1, supposing that a is negative.
 a < 1 whenever a is negative.
 a < 1 provided that a is negative.
 For a < 1, a sufﬁcient condition is that a is negative.
 a < 1 is a necessary condition for a to be negative.
Because implications form such an important part of mathematical discourse, it is
very important to know how to negate them. The key is the truth table (E.2): it shows that
the implication P ) Q is false exactly when P is true and Q is false, and in no other
circumstances. Thus :.P ) Q/ has the same truth values as P ^ :Q. The following
truth table conﬁrms this:
P
Q
P ) Q
:.P ) Q/

P ^ :Q

Beginning students frequently lose sight of this fact, and when faced with the task of writ-
ing the negation of an implication like P ) Q, they want to write another implication
(such as :P ) :Q or :P ) Q or P ) :Q or even Q ) P ). If you remember the
following mantra, you will avoid falling into this trap:
The negation of an implication is never an implication.
Instead, it is a conjunction: the negation of P ) Q is P ^ :Q. For example:
STATEMENT:
If a2 D 4, then a D 2.
NEGATION:
a2 D 4 and a ¤ 2.
Starting with the implication P ) Q and negating it once, we get the conjunction
P ^ :Q, as we have seen. Then if we negate again, following the rule for negating a
conjunction discussed above, we obtain :P _ Q. How can this be, given that the negation
of a negation is supposed to have the same meaning as the original statement? A glance at
the truth tables for P ) Q and :P _ Q reveals the answer:
P

P ) Q

This shows that the statements P ) Q and :P _ Q are always equivalent. Thus if it is
convenient, we can always replace an implication by the corresponding disjunction.

Conditional Statements

The Contrapositive and Converse of an Implication
Given an implication P ) Q, we can form two other closely related implications. The
ﬁrst one, called the contrapositive of the original implication, is the statement :Q ) :P .
The contrapositive turns out to have exactly the same truth value as the original implication.
In everyday English, this is usually easy to recognize. For example, think back to the
teacher’s announcement that we discussed earlier: “If you scored higher than 95% on the
exam, then you got an A.” If this statement were true, then any student who did not get an
A would be justiﬁed in concluding that he did not score higher than 95% on the exam, so
the contrapositive is also true: “if you did not get an A, then you did not score higher than
95% on the exam.”
The following truth table shows that the contrapositive has the same truth value as the
original implication in every case:

The second important related implication is called the converse of the original implica-
tion. Given an implication P ) Q, its converse is the implication Q ) P . By examining
the truth tables for an implication and its converse, we can see that there is no necessary
relation between the two statements—the fact that either one is true does not necessarily
tell us anything about the truth of the other.

For example, consider the following mathematical statements about a real number a:

If a2 > 0, then a ¤ 0.
[Both the original implication and its converse are always true.]
STATEMENT:
If a > 2, then a > 0.
CONVERSE:
If a > 0, then a > 2.
[The original implication is always true, but the converse is
false, for example, when a D 1.]
STATEMENT:
If a2 D 4, then a D 2.
CONVERSE:
If a D 2, then a2 D 4.
[The original implication is false when a D 2, but the converse
is always true.]
STATEMENT:
If a > 0, then a < 2.
CONVERSE:
If a < 2, then a > 0.
[The original implication is false whenever a  2, and the con-
verse is false whenever a  0.]

E. The Language of Mathematics
In ordinary discourse, it is very common to confuse statements with their converses.
For example, when a teacher says to a class, “If you scored higher than 95% on the exam,
then you got an A,” the students might reasonably expect that if they got an A, it means
they must have scored higher than 95%; this is why Carmela was surprised by her grade
in our previous example. But from a strictly logical point of view, this conclusion would
not be justiﬁed. In mathematical reasoning, it is vital that we strictly observe the distinc-
tion between a statement and its converse—knowing that an implication is true tells us
absolutely nothing about the truth of its converse.
Biconditionals
This brings us naturally to the last of our logical connectives: if and only if. If P and
Q are mathematical statements, then “P if and only if Q” is a mathematical statement,
called a biconditional statement or an equivalence and symbolized by P , Q (or some-
times P $ Q). This statement is true when P and Q are both true or both false, and it is
false otherwise. The truth table below shows that its meaning is exactly the same as that of
the conjunction “P implies Q and Q implies P .”

In an English sentence, a biconditional statement can be phrased in several ways. Here
are some ways of expressing the biconditional statement formed from the two statements
“a ¤ 0” and “a2 > 0”:
 a ¤ 0 if and only if a2 > 0.
 a ¤ 0 is equivalent to a2 > 0.
 a ¤ 0 is a necessary and sufﬁcient condition for a2 > 0.
 a ¤ 0 precisely when a2 > 0.
Some writers abbreviate “if and only if ” as “iff.” This is a handy shortcut when writing
on the blackboard or in one’s own informal notes; but the best advice from experienced and
careful writers is to avoid using this abbreviation in formal writing. When you write proofs
to be read by others, it is much easier on the reader if you write out the full phrase.
A few words are in order regarding the meaning of “only if ” in the phrase “if and only
if.” We can break the statement “P if and only if Q” into two parts: “P if Q,” and “P
only if Q.” As we observed above, “P if Q” is one way of expressing the implication
Q ) P . (The statement to which the word if is attached is always the hypothesis, whether
it comes ﬁrst or last in the sentence.) On the other hand, “P only if Q” expresses the other
half of the biconditional, namely P ) Q. This can be confusing, because the appearance
of the word “if ” just before Q seems to suggest that Q is the hypothesis; but when “if ”
appears in the combination “only if,” it always signals the conclusion. Thus the following
two sentences mean the same thing:
 If a > 1, then a is positive.
 a > 1 only if a is positive.

Conditional Statements
393
Mathematicians seldom use “only if ” on its own to express a conditional statement because
it can be confusing; but because it appears so frequently in biconditionals, it is important
to be clearly aware of which implication it expresses.
Equivalence and Equality
It is worth taking a second look at the term “equivalent.” As explained above, the
statement “P is equivalent to Q” is a way of saying P , Q, which means that P and Q
have the same truth values. If this is known to be the case (that is, if “P , Q” is known
to be a true statement), then Q can be deduced from P and vice versa, wherever either
one appears in a logical argument. We have already seen several examples of equivalent
statements: no matter what statements P and Q represent,
:.P ^ Q/
is always equivalent to
:P _ :QI
:.P _ Q/
is always equivalent to
:P ^ :QI
:.P ) Q/
is always equivalent to
P ^ :QI
P ) Q
is always equivalent to
:Q ) :P:
Note that the word equivalent applies only to statements, not to mathematical objects
(numbers, points, lines, etc.). It does not make sense to say “
p
4 is equivalent to 2.”
Instead, when you want to say that two mathematical objects are the same, use “equal”:
“
p
4 is equal to 2.” Only statements can be equivalent; only mathematical objects can be
equal. (Full disclosure: it should be noted for the record that, in higher mathematics, one
can deﬁne a type of relation called an equivalence relation between mathematical objects,
and once such a relation has been deﬁned, one can say that objects that satisfy that relation
are “equivalent” to each other. But that always requires a special deﬁnition, and we never
use the term “equivalent” in that way in this book.)
Although, as explained in Chapter 1, Euclid used the word “equal” to mean “the same
size,” in modern mathematics the word typically means only one thing: to say that math-
ematical objects are equal is to say that they are the same object. Thus an equation like
a D b is a statement that the symbols a and b represent the very same number (or point
or line or whatever type of object a and b stand for). When we write 2=4 D 1=2, we are
asserting that these are two different mathematical expressions for the same real number.
To say that two mathematical objects are distinct or different means simply that they are
not equal.
This interpretation leads immediately to several important properties that equality has,
no matter what kinds of objects it is used with. Suppose a, b, and c represent mathematical
objects of any type whatsoever. Equality satisﬁes the following properties:
 REFLEXIVE PROPERTY OF EQUALITY: a D a.
 SYMMETRIC PROPERTY OF EQUALITY: If a D b, then b D a.
 TRANSITIVE PROPERTY OF EQUALITY: If a D b and b D c, then a D c.
 SUBSTITUTION PROPERTY OF EQUALITY: If a D b, then b may be substituted for
some or all occurrences of a in any mathematical statement.
These are not really mathematical properties; rather, they are logical properties that follow
immediately from our interpretation of the word equal.

E. The Language of Mathematics
Quantiﬁers
When we ﬁrst described mathematical statements at the beginning of this appendix, we
insisted that every statement must be either true or false, but not both. As a consequence,
a sentence like “a > 0” cannot actually be considered to be a statement until we assign
a speciﬁc value to the symbol a, like a D 2 or a D . But this is far too limiting: in
ordinary mathematical discourse, we frequently make statements in which symbols stand
for whole classes of objects, and we have no trouble interpreting such sentences as true or
false. For example, most people would probably consider the following two sentences to
be unambiguous mathematical statements, with the ﬁrst one true and the second one false:
 If x is a real number, then x2  0.
 If n is an integer, then n > 0.
We will see in this section how to analyze such sentences.
First let us introduce some terminology. A variable is a mathematical symbol (usually
a letter) that has not been assigned a speciﬁc value but is used to stand for any value within
some speciﬁed set of allowable values; this set of allowable values is called the domain of
the variable. A sentence containing one or more variables is called an open sentence (or
sometimes a predicate), provided that it becomes a (true or false) mathematical statement
whenever each of the variables is assigned a speciﬁc value from its domain.
Thus, for example, suppose we agree that the variable n is to represent an unspeciﬁed
integer (so the domain of n is the set of all integers). Then “n > 0” is not a statement
because we cannot know whether it is true or false without further specifying what n is;
instead, it is an open sentence. Any variable that appears in an open sentence and has not
been assigned a value is called a free variable. For purposes of discussing the logic of
open sentences, we will often use a notation such as P.x/ to symbolize a generic open
sentence that has x as a free variable, with notations such as Q.x;y/, R.x;y;z/, etc.,
symbolizing open sentences with more than one free variable. (If some symbols have
already been assigned speciﬁc values, as in “let a D 2,” then they are not considered to be
free variables.)
To turn an open sentence into a statement, we need a quantiﬁer. There are two types
of quantiﬁers in mathematical logic: universal and existential. Let’s examine each in turn.
Universal Quantiﬁers
The ﬁrst type of quantiﬁer we will study is called a universal quantiﬁer; it is usually
expressed with a phrase such as “for all.” The basic syntax works like this. Suppose P.x/ is
an open sentence with one free variable x, in which the domain of x is some predetermined
set D of mathematical objects. (For example, D could be the set of real numbers, denoted
by R; or the set of all integers, denoted by Z; or the set of all points in the plane; or the set
of all isosceles triangles.) Then the following is a valid mathematical statement, called a
universal statement:
for all x, P.x/.
This statement is true if P.x/ becomes a true statement no matter what element of the
domain D is substituted for x; otherwise it is false. This universal statement can be sym-
bolized as follows:
8x;P.x/:

Quantiﬁers
395
The phrase “for all x” (or 8x) in this statement is called a universal quantiﬁer. It is not a
statement in itself but rather is a “preﬁx” that can be attached to an open sentence to turn
it into a statement. For example, consider the open sentence “x2  0.” If we agree that x
represents an arbitrary real number, then “for all x, x2  0” is a universal statement, which
happens to be true. On the other hand, “for all x, x > 0” is a false universal statement,
because there is at least one allowable value we can substitute for x (x D 0, for example)
that makes it false.
Besides “for all,” there are other ways that universal quantiﬁers can be expressed in
English. Each of the following sentences means the same as “8x; x2  0”:
 For all x, x2  0.
 For each x, x2  0.
 For every x, x2  0.
 Given any x, x2  0.
 Every x satisﬁes x2  0.
 For any x, x2  0.
You will notice that the word “given” can be interpreted either as a universal quantiﬁer or
as the hypothesis of an implication. When it is used in an implication, it usually signals
the presence of an implicit universal quantiﬁer, which we will discuss below.
One must be extremely careful about using “any” to express a universal quantiﬁer,
however, because it might not always be interpreted as intended. For example, suppose we
try to deﬁne a new term called a “happy set,” with the following deﬁnition: “we say that
S is a happy set if any number in S is positive.” Does S being a happy set mean that, if
we choose any arbitrary number in S, then it will necessarily be positive (in other words,
every number in S is positive)? Or does it mean just that there is some number in S that
is positive? If you use “any” to express a universal quantiﬁer, make sure that it cannot be
easily misinterpreted.
In order to correctly interpret a quantiﬁed statement, we must know the domain of each
quantiﬁed variable; otherwise the statement is meaningless. For example, the statement
“for all n, n  1” is false if we understand the domain of n to be the set of all integers.
However, if we change the domain to be the set of all positive integers, then it becomes a
true statement. And if we take the domain to be the set of all points in the plane, then it is
not a statement at all, because it is meaningless to say that a point in the plane is greater
than or equal to 1.
There are various ways that the domain of a quantiﬁed variable can be speciﬁed. One
way is to stipulate in advance that certain variables represent elements of a certain do-
main. This is what we did in the examples above, when we stipulated that x represents an
arbitrary real number.
It is usually clearer, however, to specify the domain of a quantiﬁer in the quantiﬁed
statement itself. This can be done by indicating the domain right in the quantiﬁer:
 For all x 2 R, x2  0.
 For all real numbers x, x2  0.
 8x 2 R, x2  0.

396
E. The Language of Mathematics
Alternatively, the domain of a universal quantiﬁer can be speciﬁed in the body of the state-
ment being quantiﬁed, usually as part of the hypothesis of an implication:
 For all x, if x 2 R, then x2  0.
 8x; x 2 R ) x2  0.
An open sentence with two or more free variables can be turned into a statement by
adding universal quantiﬁers for all of the variables. For example, if Q.x;y/ is an open
sentence with free variables x and y, both with domain D, then we can form the universal
statement “For all x and y in D, Q.x;y/.” This can be symbolized as 8x;y 2 D;Q.x;y/.
The following statements all mean the same thing:
 For all real numbers x and y, x Cy D y Cx.
 For all x;y 2 R, x Cy D y Cx.
 8x;y 2 R, x Cy D y Cx.
If the variables don’t all have the same domain, then they can be expressed with multiple
quantiﬁers. For example, the following two statements mean the same thing (here ZC
denotes the set of positive integers):
 For all real numbers x and y and all positive integers n, .xy/n D xnyn.
 8x;y 2 R; 8n 2 ZC; .xy/n D xnyn.
It is possible that the domain of a quantiﬁed variable might actually contain no ele-
ments that satisfy the hypothesis. For example, consider the following statement:
 For all real numbers x, if x2 < 0, then x < 0.
Whenever x is a real number, the hypothesis of this implication is false (because x2 is
never negative), so according to the truth table for implications, the implication is true.
This means that the universal statement is true.
A similar thing happens if the domain contains no elements at all, for example:
 For all integers n strictly between 0 and 1, n2 > 0.
In this case, the domain (integers strictly between 0 and 1) contains no elements. To
analyze this statement, we can rephrase it by moving the domain into the hypothesis of the
quantiﬁed statement:
 For all n, if n is an integer strictly between 0 and 1, then n2 > 0.
Now you can see that the hypothesis is false for every n, so once again the quantiﬁed
statement is true. (You can think of it this way: the conclusion n2 > 0 is true for all
of the integers n between 0 and 1—all none of them!) A universal statement in which
the domain has no elements (or no elements that satisfy the hypothesis in the case of a
universal implication) is said to be vacuously true.
In practice, universal quantiﬁers are often not explicitly expressed at all when the
statement being quantiﬁed is an implication. The following three statements have exactly
the same meaning:
 If x 2 R, then x2  0.
 For all x, if x 2 R, then x2  0.
 For all x 2 R, x2  0.

Quantiﬁers
397
The ﬁrst of these three statements is an example of a statement with an implicit universal
quantiﬁer. This occurs in the following situation: if an implication contains the same free
variable(s) in both the hypothesis and the conclusion and there are no explicit quantiﬁers
for those variables, then the sentence is to be understood as if each free variable were
governed by a universal quantiﬁer. Thus the following statement should be interpreted as
if it were preceded by “For all n”:
 If n is a positive integer, then n  1.
(Of course, the domain of each variable must be made clear, either in the surrounding
context or by being explicitly speciﬁed as part of the hypothesis.) Most mathematical
theorems are stated in the form of universal implications, with the universal quantiﬁer
either implicit or explicit.
We mentioned earlier that we would revisit the issue of why the truth table we have
given for P ) Q is the appropriate one. Universal implications make this abundantly
clear. Consider the following universal statement:
for every real number x, if x > 1, then x > 0.
Everyone would agree that this is a true statement. Let’s see what it means for a few
speciﬁc values of x:
x
x > 1
x > 0
x > 1 ) x > 0
0
F
F
T
1
F
T
T

If we want to say that the implication “x > 1 ) x > 0” is true for every real number x,
then the table above shows that we have to consider it to be true when the hypothesis and
conclusion are both false (as when x D 0), when the hypothesis is false but the conclusion
is true (x D 1), and when they are both true (x D 2). Since we have already agreed that
it is false when the hypothesis is true but the conclusion is false, we have no choice but to
accept that the truth table for P ) Q must be as we deﬁned it.
Existential Quantiﬁers
The other kind of quantiﬁer is called an existential quantiﬁer and is usually expressed
with a phrase such as “there exists.” If P.x/ is an open sentence with one free variable x,
then the following is a valid mathematical statement, called an existence statement or an
existential statement:
there exists x such that P.x/.
Symbolically, this is written
9x;P.x/:
(Notice that there is no speciﬁc logical symbol for the phrase “such that”: in an existence
statement, that phrase serves only as “connective tissue” between the object x whose exis-
tence is being asserted and the statement P.x/ that it is supposed to satisfy. In the symbolic
version of the statement, its place is taken by a comma.) This existence statement is true if
there is at least one x in the given domain such that P.x/ is a true statement, and it is false
otherwise.
Just like variables in universal quantiﬁers, the variable in an existential quantiﬁer must
have a clearly speciﬁed domain, so we know what kind of object is being asserted to

398
E. The Language of Mathematics
exist. The domain can be determined by the context, for example by saying something
like “throughout this discussion, the variable x represents a real number.” But it is usually
better to specify the domain in the statement itself. This can be done by including the
domain in the quantiﬁer: “there exists x 2 R such that x2 D 2.” Alternatively, the domain
can be speciﬁed by including it in the condition to be satisﬁed by the object: “there exists
x such that x 2 R and x2 D 2.” Notice that when the domain is speciﬁed in the body of
an existential statement, it becomes part of a conjunction; but, as we saw earlier, when it is
speciﬁed in the body of a universal statement, it becomes part of the hypothesis.
Here are some ways that an existential quantiﬁer can be expressed in an English sen-
tence. All of these sentences mean the same thing.
 There exists x 2 R such that x2 D 2.
 For some x 2 R, x2 D 2.
 There is a real number x such that x2 D 2.
 There is at least one x 2 R such that x2 D 2.
A common variation on the theme of existence statements is a statement of existence
and uniqueness. Instead of “there exists x in D such that P.x/,” we might say “there
exists a unique x in D such that P.x/.” Its meaning should be clear: whereas an ordinary
existence statement asserts that there exists at least one x 2 D satisfying the given con-
dition, an existence and uniqueness statement asserts that there is one and only one such
x. For example, in Chapter 3 we study the following existence and uniqueness statement:
“given any two distinct points, there is a unique line that contains both of them.” An exis-
tence and uniqueness statement is often symbolized by adding an exclamation point after
the symbol for “there exists”; thus “there exists a unique x in D such that P.x/” can be
symbolized as
9Šx 2 D;P.x/:
(E.3)
As always, the domain of the quantiﬁer must be either speciﬁed or understood from the
context.
“Existence and uniqueness” is not really a new kind of quantiﬁer; rather, it is just
shorthand for the conjunction of two separate statements, one asserting existence (“there
exists at least one such x”) and the other asserting uniqueness (“there exists at most one
such x”). We already know what the existence assertion means. The uniqueness assertion
is really a short way of saying “if x1 and x2 are elements of D that satisfy P.x1/ and
P.x2/, then they are equal.” (Note the implicit universal quantiﬁer in this statement.) Thus
we can expand the existence and uniqueness statement (E.3) as follows:

9x 2 D;P.x/

^

8x1;x2 2 D;P.x1/ ^ P.x2/ ) x1 D x2

:
(E.4)
It is important to understand the distinction between the mathematical terms “unique”
and “distinct”: to say that something is unique is to say that any two objects satisfying
the same condition must be equal to each other; while to say that two or more objects are
distinct is to say that they are not equal to each other. Mathematically, these terms are
not interchangeable, even though in nonmathematical contexts, they are sometimes used
interchangeably. For example, in computer science, one speaks of the number of “unique
visitors” to a website during a certain period of time, meaning the number of different
people who logged on to the site. A mathematician would prefer to call these “distinct
visitors.”

Quantiﬁers
399
Mixed Quantiﬁers
As we mentioned earlier in the section on universal quantiﬁers, open sentences with
multiple variables need multiple quantiﬁers to turn them into statements. If two or more
variables are quantiﬁed by quantiﬁers of the same type (universal or existential), then it
does not matter what order we express the quantiﬁers in. The following two universal
statements are equivalent:
 For every x 2 R and every n 2 Z, .x2/n D x2n.
 For every n 2 Z and every x 2 R, .x2/n D x2n.
Similarly, the following existence statements mean the same thing:
 There exist x 2 R and n 2 Z such that xn D 1.
 There exist n 2 Z and x 2 R such that xn D 1.
(Note that when the existence of more than one object is being asserted, the grammatically
appropriate phrase is “there exist” in place of “there exists.”)
However, if one sentence has two (or more) quantiﬁers of different types, then the
order makes a big difference. Consider the following two statements:
 For every x 2 R, there exists y 2 R such that y > x.
 There exists y 2 R such that for every x 2 R, y > x.
The ﬁrst statement says that given any real number x, there must exist a real number y that
is larger than x. This is a true statement, because given x, we can take y D x C 1, which
satisﬁes y > x. Because of the order in which the quantiﬁers were stated, x is given to us
ﬁrst, and we are allowed to choose y depending on x.
The second statement is very different: it says that there exists some real number y,
which has the property that it is greater than every real number x. This is certainly not true.
The moral is that when quantiﬁers of different types are used in the same sentence,
order matters.
Negating Quantiﬁed Statements
Just as negations of ordinary compound statements can be simpliﬁed, we can also
simplify negations of quantiﬁed statements by paying close attention to their meanings.
Let us begin with universal statements. A universal statement such as “8x 2 D; P.x/”
is true when every x 2 D (if there are any) satisﬁes the statement P.x/. Therefore it is
false if and only if there is some x in D that does not satisfy P.x/. The negation of this
universal statement, therefore, is an existence statement:
STATEMENT:
8x 2 D; P.x/.
NEGATION:
9x 2 D; :P.x/.
Notice that the domain has not changed, because to conclude that the original statement is
false we must ﬁnd some x in the original domain D that satisﬁes :P.x/.
Now consider existence statements. A negated existence statement is called a nonex-
istence statement. Often it is simplest to express such a statement simply by replacing
“there exists” by “there does not exist.” Thus, for example, we could express the negation

400
E. The Language of Mathematics
of “there exists a real number x such that x2 D 2” in the form “there does not exist a real
number x such that x2 D 2.”
However, for purposes of analyzing negated existence statements, it is also important
to be able to expand them the way we did with negated universal statements. In order for
the statement “9x 2 D;P.x/” to be false, it must be the case that there is no element of D
that satisﬁes the condition P.x/, which is the same as saying all elements of D (if there
are any) satisfy :P.x/. Thus the negation of an existence statement is equivalent to a
universal statement:
STATEMENT:
9x 2 D; P.x/.
NEGATION:
8x 2 D; :P.x/.
These rules can be combined to negate very complicated mathematical statements. To
do so efﬁciently, it is usually easiest if you write the statement in symbolic form and then
read the statement from left to right, negating as you go. Each time you see a universal
quantiﬁer in the original statement, replace it by an existential quantiﬁer and negate the
whole statement that follows it (the part being quantiﬁed). When you see an existential
quantiﬁer, replace it by a universal quantiﬁer and negate the statement that follows it.
When you see a conjunction, disjunction, or implication, negate it according to the rules
we discussed earlier in this appendix.
Here is an example of how to negate a complicated statement step-by-step. The state-
ment we will negate is the following:
 For every line ` and every point A, if A does not lie on `, then there exists a line m
such that A lies on m and m is parallel to `.
We begin by writing the statement in symbolic form. For the purpose of symbolizing it,
we let L denote the set of all lines and P the set of all points; we use 2 to mean both “is
an element of ” (a set) and “lies on” (a line), and k to mean “is parallel to.”
 8` 2 L; 8A 2 P ; A … ` ) .9m 2 L; A 2 m ^ m k `/:
Here is a step-by-step process for negating this statement. (Remember that the negation of
an implication is a conjunction and the negation of a conjunction is a disjunction.) Each of
the statements in this sequence is equivalent to the previous one:
1. :

8` 2 L; 8A 2 P ; A … ` ) .9m 2 L; A 2 m ^ m k `/

:
2. 9` 2 L; :

8A 2 P ; A … ` ) .9m 2 L; A 2 m ^ m k `/

:
3. 9` 2 L; 9A 2 P ; :

A … ` ) .9m 2 L; A 2 m ^ m k `/

:
4. 9` 2 L; 9A 2 P ; A … ` ^ :

9m 2 L; A 2 m ^ m k `

:
5. 9` 2 L; 9A 2 P ; A … ` ^

8m 2 L; :.A 2 m ^ m k `/

:
6. 9` 2 L; 9A 2 P ; A … ` ^ 8m 2 L; A … m _ m ¬ `:
Now we can rephrase the negation as an English sentence:
 There exist a line ` and a point A such that A does not lie on `, and for every line m,
either A does not lie on m or m is not parallel to `.
To rephrase it a little more ﬂuently, it is best to go back to statement 4, in which the
nonexistence statement has not been expanded:

Mathematical Deﬁnitions
401
 There exist a line ` and a point A not on `, with the property that no line contains A
and is parallel to `.
Special care must be taken when negating an existence and uniqueness statement.
Recall that such a statement can always be expanded into a conjunction like statement
(E.4): the ﬁrst part is the existence statement, and the second part is a universal implication
expressing uniqueness. The negation will therefore always be a disjunction. Simply stated,
there are two ways for an existence and uniqueness statement to be false: either existence
can fail (if there is no object satisfying the given conditions) or uniqueness can fail (if there
are at least two distinct such objects).
To see how this works in practice, consider the following (false) existence and unique-
ness statement:
 There exists a unique real number x such that x2 D 2.
Symbolically,


9x 2 R; x2 D 2

^

8x1;x2 2 R; .x12 D 2 ^ x22 D 2/ ) x1 D x2

.
Following the procedure outlined above, we can negate this statement systematically by
working from left to right. For clarity, we leave the negated existence statement unex-
panded as before.

.
In words, this means the following:
 Either there does not exist a real number whose square is equal to 2 or there exist two
different real numbers whose squares are both equal to 2.
This, of course, is a true statement (why?).
Mathematical Deﬁnitions
We end this appendix with a few words about mathematical deﬁnitions. In rigorous modern
mathematics, to give a term a mathematical deﬁnition means to specify a precise, unam-
biguous condition that an object x must satisfy, in the form of an open sentence P.x/, in
order for x to be considered as an instance of the term being deﬁned.
When stating a deﬁnition, it is conventional to introduce the condition with the word
“if ”; however, in the context of a deﬁnition, it is always understood that x satisﬁes the
deﬁnition if and only if P.x/ is true. For example, suppose we wish to deﬁne greebsnitch
as a mathematical term. We might write,
We say x is a greebsnitch if x is a real number greater than 42.
In this case, the deﬁning condition is the open sentence “x is a real number greater than
42,” and what the deﬁnition means is the following biconditional:
x is a greebsnitch , x 2 R and x > 42:
Once the deﬁnition is made, the two open sentences “x is a greebsnitch” and “x 2 R and
x > 42” are thenceforth equivalent, so either one can be deduced from the other.

EC. As mentioned in the text, most mathematical theorems are universal implications. Of-
ten when the theorem statement is written, the universal quantiﬁer is implicit. Each of
the following statements contains one or more implicit universal quantiﬁers. Rewrite
each statement (in ordinary English, not symbols), making the quantiﬁer(s) explicit;
then negate the quantiﬁed statement. (The symbol Š means “is congruent to”; its
meaning is discussed in Chapters 3 and 4, but you don’t need to know what it means
to do this exercise.)

Appendix F
Proofs
A theorem is a mathematical statement together with a proof of that statement. So what
is a proof? Of course, it is meant to be a convincing argument that the theorem follows
logically from the axioms and previously proved theorems. But in ordinary discourse,
different people might be convinced by different types of arguments. The mathematical
community, by contrast, has reached a near-universal consensus about what constitutes a
valid and convincing proof. This is what gives modern mathematics its power.
In its most basic form, a mathematical proof is just a sequence of mathematical state-
ments, connected to each other by strict rules that describe what types of statements may
be added and in what order. If, by following these rules, you produce a sequence of state-
ments, the last of which is the statement of the theorem you’re trying to prove, then you
have produced a proof that will convince any mathematically educated reader or listener
beyond reasonable doubt that your theorem is correct.
In this appendix, we focus on the underlying structure of a proof as a sequence of
statements, each justiﬁed according to the conventions of mathematical reasoning. To
make that structure as plain as possible, we begin by presenting our proofs in a “two-
column” format, similar to the way proofs are introduced in some high-school geometry
courses. In the left column is the sequence of statements that constitute the proof; in the
right column are the reasons that justify the steps.
The Structure of Mathematical Proofs
There are several different types of proofs, each of which is appropriate in certain circum-
stances. We will discuss the most important types later in this appendix. But to give us
something concrete to work with now, let’s start by talking about the simplest type of proof
of the simplest type of theorem statement, an implication: P ) Q. Here is a “template”
for a proof of this implication:

□
The “□” is an end-of-proof symbol, which in modern mathematical writing usually
takes the place of the q.e.d. (or q.e.f.) that Euclid used to indicate the end of a proof.
The idea of this kind of proof is this: to verify that P ) Q is true, we need only verify
that whenever P is true, it follows logically that Q is also true. If P happens to be false,
then the implication is automatically true, as you can see by examining the truth table for
“implies.” This is why we get to carry out the proof under the assumption that P is true.
The proof will be correct provided that each step is justiﬁed by one or more of the
following six types of reasons:
 by hypothesis,
 by a deﬁnition,
 by an axiom,
 by a previously proved theorem,
 by a previous step in the same proof,
 by the laws of logic.
Let us examine each of these types of justiﬁcation in turn. We will illustrate the way
these justiﬁcations are used by exhibiting “snippets” of proofs that exemplify the types of
moves we can make and how they are justiﬁed.
By hypothesis: As we explained above, the proof of an implication is carried out under
the assumption that the hypothesis is true. So the ﬁrst step of most proofs is to assume that
the hypothesis is true, and the justiﬁcation for this step is “by hypothesis.” Later, we will
see some other kinds of hypotheses that can be assumed in different types of proofs.
By a deﬁnition: In Appendix E, we explained that a deﬁnition is always a biconditional
statement (even though most deﬁnitions are worded using only “if ”). Thus a deﬁnition
yields two implications, either of which can be used to justify any step of a proof. For
example, if we have deﬁned a greebsnitch to be a real number greater than 42, we may
make either of the following moves in a proof:
Statement
Reason
. . .
(. . . )
x is a greebsnitch.
(. . . )
x 2 R and x > 42.

y 2 R and y > 42.

(deﬁnition of greebsnitch)

(. . . )
“By deﬁnition” is also an appropriate justiﬁcation for a step that merely serves to
deﬁne a new symbolic name by giving it a speciﬁc value. For example:
Statement
Reason
. . .
(. . . )
Let x D
p

(deﬁning x)
. . .
(. . . )
By an axiom: A mathematical proof is always carried out in the context of a partic-
ular axiomatic system. At any point, one or more of the axioms can be used to justify a
statement. For example, one of the axioms of incidence geometry in Chapter 2 (Incidence
Axiom 4) states that every line contains at least two points. Here is an example of how that
axiom can be used in a proof in incidence geometry:
Statement
Reason
. . .
(. . . )
m is a line.
(. . . )
There exist two distinct points A and B that lie on m.
(Incidence Axiom 4)
. . .
(. . . )
In order to use an axiom to justify a step, it is essential to have already established that
the hypotheses of the axiom are satisﬁed, which includes verifying that the object you are
applying it to is an element of the correct domain. For example, Incidence Axiom 4 applies
to every line, so in order to apply it to m in the snippet above, all we need to verify is that
m is a line. But Incidence Axiom 2 applies to two distinct points, so if we wish to apply it
to points A and B, we must ﬁrst establish in a previous step that A and B are distinct.
By a previously proved theorem: Similarly, once a theorem has been proved within the
context of the axiomatic system, the statement of that theorem can be used to justify a step
in a later proof, in the same way you would use an axiom. Of course, you have to ensure
that you only use previously proved theorems, so as to avoid circular reasoning, and, just
as in the case of axioms, it is vital to check that the hypotheses of the theorem are satisﬁed
before you can apply it.
By a previous step in the same proof: Usually, the justiﬁcation for a step in a proof
is some combination of reasons, including one or more previous steps in the proof. It is
always understood that the immediately preceding step is part of the justiﬁcation for each
statement in a proof, so if your statement is justiﬁed by that step together with some other
reasons (such as a deﬁnition or an axiom), just cite the other reasons. However, if your
reasoning depends on one or more steps other than, or in addition to, the immediately pre-
ceding one, you should cite all such previous steps (including the immediately preceding
one if appropriate) as part of your justiﬁcation. For example, in the proof snippet above, if
the use of Incidence Axiom 4 did not come immediately after the assertion that m is a line,

408

the proof might look like this:

(. . . )
. . .
(. . . )
10.
There exist distinct points A and B
that lie on m.
(Incidence Axiom 4 and Step 6)
. . .
(. . . )
By the laws of logic: The rules for interpreting logical statements discussed in Ap-
pendix E lead to many general principles for deducing that if certain types of statements
are true, then another related statement must also be true. For example, if P and Q are
statements and we know that P ) Q is true and also that P is true, then we can conclude
logically that Q must be true. Similarly, if we know that P _ Q is true and that Q is false,
then we can conclude that P must be true.
Such principles are called rules of inference, and they are studied intensively in logic
courses. The two rules of inference mentioned in the preceding paragraph can be summa-
rized in the following tables:
P ) Q
P
Q
P _ Q
:Q
P
In each case, the statements above the line are called the premises, and the statement below
the line is called the conclusion. The rule of inference says that if the premises are known
to be true, then it can be concluded logically that the conclusion is also true.
Rules of inference can often be seen to be true by common sense; more formally, they
are veriﬁed by examining truth tables. For example, to justify the ﬁrst rule of inference
we described above, just notice that in the truth table for P ) Q, there is only one row in
which P ) Q is true and P is also true, and in that row, Q is true. The second rule can
similarly be justiﬁed by examining the truth table for P _ Q:

Here are some other commonly used rules of inference. They can all be justiﬁed by ap-
pealing to appropriate truth tables.

There are also rules of inference that apply to quantiﬁed statements. First consider
universal quantiﬁers: if we know that the statement “8x 2 D; Q.x/” is true and we also
know that a is an element of D, then we can conclude logically that Q.a/ is true. Thus we

The Structure of Mathematical Proofs
409
have the following rule of inference:
8x 2 D; Q.x/
a 2 D
Q.a/
(This is exactly what we did in the last two proof snippets above: Incidence Axiom 4 is the
universal statement that for every line `, there exist two distinct points that lie on `, and a
previous step says that m is a line, so we can conclude logically that there exist two distinct
points that lie on m.)
Existence statements are handled a little differently. If an axiom, previous theorem,
or previous step established an existence statement, such as “there exists a line containing
A and B,” then we can introduce a symbolic name to refer to such an object, as in “let `
be a line containing A and B.” Note that such a statement must always be justiﬁed by a
previously proved or assumed existence statement.
If a certain step in our proof is an existence assertion that gives a name to the object that
is being asserted to exist, such as “there exists x 2 D such that Q.x/,” then this statement
in itself serves to introduce the symbol x into the discussion as an element of the domain
D that satisﬁes Q.x/, and we can thenceforth use the fact that x has those properties. This
corresponds to the following rule of inference:
9x 2 D; Q.x/
x 2 D ^ Q.x/
For example, suppose a step in our proof says “there exists a line ` containing A.” There-
after, the symbol ` is understood to represent a speciﬁc line that contains A.
When you use an existence statement to justify the introduction of an object, it’s im-
portant to bear in mind that you cannot assume anything about the object other than what’s
guaranteed by the existence statement. Thus, having introduced ` with a statement like
“there exists a line ` containing A,” you cannot count on ` having any special properties
except the fact that it contains A. It’s useful to imagine that the actual value to be as-
signed to the variable is being chosen by a mischievous and annoyingly literal gremlin.
The gremlin is required to choose a value that satisﬁes the stated condition, so if the ex-
istence statement says “there exists a real number x between a and b,” you know that the
gremlin will choose some real number between a and b. But if there’s any way the grem-
lin can choose it so as to complicate or invalidate your proof (say, by choosing zero or a
number extremely close to a or b or a very large negative number or an irrational number),
then he will probably do so. Your proof has to work no matter what real number between
a and b the gremlin chooses.
Another situation in which the laws of logic are used in proofs is in applying the
reﬂexive, symmetric, transitive, and substitution properties of equality. Thus, for example,
if Q.x/ is an open sentence with one free variable and a;b;c are variables representing
any types of objects whatsoever, the following are valid inferences:
Q.a/
a D b
Q.b/
a D b
b D c
a D c
In proofs, the typical justiﬁcation for the left-hand inference is “by substitution” (or “by
substitution into equation .n/,” if it is clearer), and the justiﬁcation for the right-hand one

410
F. Proofs
is “by transitivity.” It is usually not necessary to give an explicit justiﬁcation when using
the reﬂexive and symmetric properties of equality.
We use the laws of logic all the time in proofs, often in concert with other types of
justiﬁcation. It is usually not necessary to cite “logic” explicitly as a reason, except in one
circumstance: if a step is justiﬁed solely by the laws of logic and one or more previous
steps, it can be helpful to mention “logic” as a justiﬁcation, so it is clear to the reader that
no other theorem or axiom is being used. Here is a simple example:

(. . . )
5.
` ¤ m.
(. . . )
6.
` and m are parallel.
(Steps 2 and 5, logic)
. . .
(. . . )
The remarkable thing about mathematical proofs is that each of these forms of justiﬁ-
cation is simple, universal, and for the most part noncontroversial. If you write a proof that
includes every step and explains why each step is justiﬁed in one or more of these ways,
then nobody will argue with the correctness of your proof.
Of course, most proofs are not written with this level of detail, because they would be
exceedingly long and boring to read. But if you understand the principles of how proofs
are constructed and make sure that your proofs could in principle be written in this way,
you will be able to write convincing arguments and avoid mistakes. You will also be able
to read and understand other people’s proofs and judge whether they are valid or not.
Direct Proofs
Just as there are several types of mathematical statements, there are several types of ar-
gument that can serve as proofs. In the next few sections, we will summarize the most
important types and give a template for constructing each type.
The most straightforward type of proof is called a direct proof: this is one in which
we assume the hypotheses and then, using the rules of deduction that we discussed above,
derive the conclusion. It is easiest to set up when applied to a simple implication. This is
the type of proof template we introduced as an illustration at the beginning of this appendix.
For convenience, here it is again:

Notice that the last step is the statement of the theorem being proved, which follows
logically from the preceding steps. This is the point of a proof: to construct a series of

411
statements, each of which follows logically from the preceding ones and such that the last
one is the theorem being proved. Euclid always ended his proofs with a restatement of
what had been proved. In practice, unlike Euclid, modern mathematicians do not usually
restate the theorem being proved as the ﬁnal step, provided that the structure of the proof
makes it obvious that the theorem follows. Thus a direct proof of an implication is more
likely to appear as follows:

There are a number of variations on direct proofs. One of the most common is proof
by contrapositive. Because the contrapositive of an implication is equivalent to the original
implication, we can always prove an implication by proving its contrapositive instead, if
that is more convenient. Here is the template:

Proofs of Universal Statements
The simple implications we have been considering so far are not very realistic; most
theorem statements contain variables and (implicit or explicit) universal quantiﬁers. Here
is the basic template for proving a universal statement:
Template F.3 (Universal Statement).

Proof.

Reason
Let x be an arbitrary element of D.
(hypothesis)

□
Pay close attention to the wording of the ﬁrst step in this template. The word “let” is
generally reserved for a special role in mathematical arguments: it should be used only to
introduce a new symbolic name for something. One situation in which it occurs frequently
is when assigning a speciﬁc value to a variable: “let a D 2.” Another such situation is one
we talked about earlier, in connection with the rule of inference for an existence statement:
if we have established that there exists an object with a certain property, then we can use

412
F. Proofs
the word “let” to introduce a symbolic name for such an object: “let ` be a line containing
A and B.”
A third situation in which “let” is appropriate is at the beginning of a proof of a univer-
sal statement, as in the template above, to introduce a symbol that represents a universally
quantiﬁed variable in the proof. You should avoid using “let” to introduce anything other
than a new symbolic name—for example, it would not be appropriate to use “let” to in-
troduce an assumption, as in “let AB and AC be equal.” It would be much better to say
“assume that AB and AC are equal,” or “suppose AB and AC are equal.” (Occasionally,
mathematicians do carelessly use the word “let” instead of “assume” or “suppose” in sen-
tences like these, but your proofs will be clearer if you learn from the start to use “let” only
to introduce new symbolic names.)
The other important word in the ﬁrst step is “arbitrary.” This is reserved for universally
quantiﬁed objects and indicates that the symbol x can stand for any unspeciﬁed element
of the domain D. This means that we are not allowed to assume anything special about it
except that it is an element of D (unless the subsequent steps in the proof call for such an
assumption, an example of which we will see in the next template we consider). As long
as we remember this restriction, the steps of our proof will be applicable to any element of
D whatsoever, and we will have proved that each element x 2 D must satisfy the conclu-
sion Q.x/. It is not always necessary to include the word “arbitrary” when introducing a
universally quantiﬁed variable; you will often see the ﬁrst step in a universal proof written
simply as “let x 2 D.” But including the word “arbitrary” reminds us that x has to stand
for any and every element of the speciﬁed domain and that we can make no other special
assumptions about it. Imagine that the actual value assigned to x has been chosen by the
same gremlin we mentioned earlier and that he has worked hard to ﬁnd any weak spots in
your logic and exploit them.
Many of the templates we give here can be combined to obtain more complicated
proof structures, for example by embedding one type of proof as a series of steps inside a
longer proof of a different type. An important and common instance of this occurs when
the theorem statement is a universal implication. In this case, the structure of the proof
combines the patterns for proving both a universal statement and an implication. The vast
majority of all theorems in mathematics are stated as universal implications (often with an
implicit universal quantiﬁer), so it is important to become very familiar with the template
for such proofs.

Of course, a universal implication can also be proved by proving the contrapositive; we
leave it to you to ﬁgure out the details of all the possible variations on such combinations.
You will see many of them in action in the proofs you encounter throughout this book.

413
Proofs of Conjunctions
Another type of theorem you will encounter is one in which you must prove a con-
junction. Most often, the conjunction occurs as the conclusion of an implication, as in
“P ) Q1 ^ Q2.” In this case, the idea is simple: to prove the conclusion, we must prove
that Q1 and Q2 are both true, so the proof will have two parts, one for each conclusion.
Here is what the template looks like:
Template F.5 (Proof of a Conjunction).

The hypothesis P is stated before the beginning of Part 1 to make it clear that it can
be used throughout both parts of the proof.
Proofs of Equivalence
A common type of theorem is an equivalence theorem, one that asserts a biconditional
like P , Q. As we discussed in Appendix E, this statement is equivalent to the conjunc-
tion “P ) Q ^ Q ) P ,” so a proof of equivalence has to be carried out in two parts like
a proof of a conjunction.

F. Proofs
A common variation on this pattern is to prove one or the other of the implications by
proving its contrapositive. For example, a common way to prove P , Q is ﬁrst to prove
P ) Q and then to prove :P ) :Q.
Proof by Cases
Another important variation on direct proof is proof by cases. This is needed whenever
you need to prove that two or more different hypotheses lead to the same conclusion. The
most common example of this is a theorem whose hypothesis is a disjunction (an “or”
statement). For example, suppose we want to prove a statement of the form “P1 _ P2 )
Q.” In this case, the hypothesis tells us that either P1 or P2 is true, but we don’t know
which one; you need to show that either hypothesis leads to the conclusion that Q is true.
For such a theorem, it is necessary to carry out two proofs, one for the case in which P1 is
true, and the other for the case in which P2 is true. The template looks like this:
Template F.7 (Proof by Cases).

Note the difference between cases and parts of a proof: as explained in the preceding
section, your proof will have multiple parts when you have two or more different con-
clusions to prove, with the same or different hypotheses. On the other hand, it will have
multiple cases when there is only one conclusion to prove, but it must be proved under
two or more different hypotheses. The typical patterns are summarized in the following

Proofs by cases can be useful even when there is not a disjunction in the hypothesis.
If, at any point during a proof, you have deduced a statement of the form P1 _ P2, then
it is legitimate to divide the remainder of the proof into cases depending on whether P1 is
true or P2 is true.
In fact, sometimes cases are useful even when no disjunction is evident. If one of two
(or more) possibilities must hold and different proofs are needed to handle the different

possibilities, then a proof by cases is called for. In effect, we introduce a disjunction of the
form R _ :R (which is always true by the laws of logic) and then use those two cases to
continue the proof. Consider the following snippet:

In practice, in cases like this, the explicit statement of the disjunction (Step 6 in the
preceding snippet) is frequently omitted from the proof, as long as it will be obvious to the
reader that at least one of the speciﬁed cases must hold.
Another situation in which proof by cases is useful, albeit in a more subtle way, is
when the conclusion of the theorem is a disjunction, as in a theorem of the form “P )
Q1 _ Q2.” In this case, we need to prove that Q1 or Q2 is true, but we might not know
in advance which one. One way to do this is to choose one of the two conclusions, say
Q1, and consider two cases: either Q1 is true or it is not. If it is true, then the conclusion
Q1 _ Q2 is true automatically by the laws of logic. In the case that Q1 is not true, you
have to prove that Q2 is true (using the assumption :Q1 if necessary). Here is how the
template looks:

□
Be sure you don’t fall into the trap of trying to use “assume Q1” and “assume Q2” as
your two cases: a proof by cases works only if you already know that one of two (or more)
alternatives must be true, either by hypothesis or by an axiom or by the rules of logic or
because you have already proved it. When we are trying to prove Q1 _ Q2, we do not

416
F. Proofs
know that Q1 or Q2 must be true until after we prove it, so assuming that one or the other
must be true amounts to circular reasoning. However, we do know that either Q1 or :Q1
must be true (by logic), which is why the proof template given above works.
Indirect Proofs
All of the types of proofs we have discussed so far are variants of direct proofs: we assume
one or more hypotheses and reason directly until we reach the desired conclusion(s). Now
we will discuss a very different type of proof, called an indirect proof, in which we assume
that the theorem statement is false and derive a contradiction. For this reason, an indirect
proof is also called a proof by contradiction. One example is the proof given in Chapter 1
that
p
2 is irrational (see Theorem 1.1).
An indirect proof can be used for any type of theorem. Here’s the general template:
Template F.9 (Indirect Proof).
Theorem. Q.
Proof.
Statement
Reason
Assume :Q.
(hypothesis for contradiction)
. . .
(. . . )
Goal:
Contradiction.
(. . . )
Conclusion:
Q.
□
The “contradiction” can be any statement that is known to be false, but usually it is a
statement of the form R ^ :R, where R is any statement whatsoever. Typically, one of the
previous steps in the proof asserts some mathematical statement R, and then a later step
asserts its negation, :R. The contradiction step then refers to the two contradictory steps
as reasons.
As with other forms of proof, the ﬁnal step restating the theorem that has been proved
can be omitted if it will be clear to the intended readers that the proof is complete. But
in indirect proofs, especially long ones, the logic can get a little complicated, so it is of-
ten worth restating the result anyway just to remind the reader why we were deriving a
contradiction.
The idea of an indirect proof is this: the statement Q, being a mathematical statement,
is either true or false. The proof shows that if Q were false, it would lead to a proof of
something we know to be false. Therefore, the only remaining possibility is that Q is true.
More formally, indirect proofs are justiﬁed by the following rule of inference:
:Q ) .R ^ :R/
Q
In words, if the falsity of Q implies a contradiction, then Q must be true. This can be
veriﬁed by looking at the truth table for the statement :Q ) .R ^ :R/.

Existence Proofs
417
Because the ﬁrst step in an indirect proof is the assumption of the negation of what
is to be proved, it is vitally important that you be able to precisely formulate the negation
of any mathematical statement. This is why we focused so much attention on negations in
Appendix E.
The most common use of indirect proof is to prove an implication, such as P ) Q.
In that case, the hypothesis for contradiction is the negation of P ) Q, which is P ^ :Q.
Thus we get to assume both that P is true and that Q is false. Since P is what we would
normally assume for a direct proof, only the :Q assumption needs to be labeled as a
hypothesis for contradiction. The template looks like this:
Template F.10 (Indirect Proof of an Implication).

Existence Proofs
Many theorems in geometry are existence statements. Existence proofs do not really con-
stitute a separate kind of proof, because existence is typically proved by some combination
of the direct or indirect methods we have already introduced; but because existence proofs
display some special features of their own, it is useful to treat them separately.
A simple existence statement is one of the form “9y 2 E; Q.y/.” To prove such a
statement, we need only show that there is one element y in E that satisﬁes the condition
Q.y/. We get to choose or construct the element in any way that is convenient. (In this
case, it is the proof writer who chooses it, not the gremlin!) Once we have chosen it,
we then need to prove that it satisﬁes the condition Q.y/. Thus a proof of existence will
typically have two parts: the ﬁrst part describes how to construct or choose an appropriate
element y 2 E, and the second part proves that y has the desired properties.
This kind of proof is often called a constructive proof, because the object y whose
existence is being asserted is sometimes “constructed” in the way one constructs geometric
ﬁgures. Even if y is not really constructed but is just chosen from among some already-
existing set of objects, this type of proof is still called a constructive proof as long as it
gives a deﬁnite formula, rule, or algorithm for how to choose y. Here is a template:
Template F.11 (Constructive Existence Proof).

□
The ﬁrst part of a constructive existence proof might require a little more ingenuity
than other kinds of proofs, because there are no general guidelines about how to construct
or choose an object that satisﬁes the desired conditions; you have to look at each particular
situation and ﬁgure out how to use the given information to ﬁnd an object of the right type.
In practice, the fact that y is an element of the set E is often obvious from the way y
is deﬁned, so that part of the conclusion might not be mentioned explicitly. Moreover, the
proof that y satisﬁes the condition Q.y/ is sometimes deeply embedded in the choice of
y, so the two parts of an existence proof might not be easily separable; in such cases, it is
permissible to present the entire proof in one part, as long as it is easy for the reader to see
that you have proved that Q.y/ holds for the chosen value of y.
Most often, an existence statement occurs as the conclusion of a different type of
statement, such as a universal statement. Templates for such proofs are simply combina-
tions of the template for an existence proof with the appropriate template for the enclosing
statement. Here is a template for one of the most common types of existence theorems:
Template F.12 (Universal Existence Proof).
Theorem. 8x 2 D; 9y 2 E; Q.x;y/.
Proof.
Statement
Reason
Let x be an arbitrary element of D.

(. . . )
Part 2: Proof that y 2 E and Q.x;y/
. . .
(. . . )
Goal:
y 2 E ^ Q.x;y/.
(. . . )
□
The important feature of this template is that, due to the order in which the quantiﬁers
appear, the universally quantiﬁed variable x is introduced ﬁrst, and then you get to choose
or construct y in a way that might depend on x; typically, different choices of x will result
in different choices of y. For example, to prove the statement 8x 2 R; 9y 2 R; y > x, we

Existence Proofs
419
would start by letting x be an arbitrary real number and then deﬁning y by some formula
involving x, such as y D x C1.
Existence statements often appear as conclusions in other types of statements as well,
such as universal implications, multiple quantiﬁers, etc. For example, consider the state-
ment “for every pair of real numbers a;b, if a < b, then there is a real number y such
that a < y < b.” This is a universal implication with two universal variables and with an
existence statement as its conclusion. To write a constructive proof of this theorem, you
get to start by assuming all of the hypotheses:
Statement
Reason
Let a and b be real numbers.
(hypothesis)
Assume a < b.
(hypothesis)
. . .
(. . . )
After that, you construct an appropriate y (for example, you could set y D .a Cb/=2)
and then show that it satisﬁes the required conclusion. All of the propositions of Euclid
that solve geometric construction problems are universal existence theorems of this type,
and there are many more throughout this book.
Existence theorems frequently come paired with uniqueness theorems. As explained
in Appendix E, an existence and uniqueness statement like 9Šy 2 E; Q.y/ is really a con-
junction of two statements: the existence statement “9y 2 E; Q.y/” and the uniqueness
statement “8y1;y2 2 E; Q.y1/ ^ Q.y2/ ) y1 D y2.” Thus an existence and uniqueness
proof will have two parts, one part for existence and one for uniqueness. Here’s a template:
Template F.13 (Universal Existence and Uniqueness Proof).

□
There are three common ways to structure a proof of uniqueness:
 Assume y1 and y2 are arbitrary elements of E satisfying Q.x;y1/ and Q.x;y2/, and
prove that y1 D y2. (This is the direct approach followed in the template above.)
 Assume that y1 is an arbitrary element of E satisfying Q.x;y1/, and prove that y1
is equal to the element y 2 E that was produced in the ﬁrst part of the proof. (To

420
F. Proofs
be logically complete, one would then argue that if y1 and y2 are two elements of E
satisfying Q.x;y1/ and Q.x;y2/, then they are both equal to y and thus equal to each
other by transitivity. But it is usually unnecessary to write out this step explicitly.)
 Alternatively, you can use an indirect proof of uniqueness: assume that y1 and y2 are
distinct elements of E satisfying Q.x;y1/ and Q.x;y2/, and derive a contradiction.
All other things being equal, direct proofs are generally preferable to indirect ones;
but for uniqueness proofs, sometimes the extra information provided by the assumption
y1 ¤ y2 is needed to get the proof going, and in such cases an indirect proof of uniqueness
might be the only kind available.
It is also possible to prove existence theorems indirectly, by assuming that there is
no object satisfying the desired conditions and deriving a contradiction. But constructive
existence proofs are always preferable when they can be found, because they come with
explicit algorithms for producing the objects in question, which can be extremely useful in
applications. All of the existence proofs in this book are constructive.
Nonexistence Proofs
Closely related to existence proofs are proofs of nonexistence statements. For exam-
ple, having deﬁned certain points A, B, and C, we might wish to prove that there is no
line that contains them all. Of course, as explained in Appendix E, a negated existence
statement is equivalent to a universal statement: “for every line `, it is not true that ` con-
tains A, B, and C,” so we could attempt to prove this universal statement. But it is almost
always easier to prove nonexistence indirectly, by assuming that an object exists with the
given properties and deriving a contradiction. Here is a template for the simplest case:
Template F.14 (Nonexistence Proof).

Proof by Mathematical Induction
The last type of proof we will consider is mathematical induction. This is a very specialized
type of proof for proving universal statements about integers. We use it only a few times
in this book, but it is indispensable in those instances.
Here is an intuitive description of how it works: suppose we wish to prove that a
statement Q.n/ is true whenever n is a positive integer. We could start checking individual
values—showing that Q.1/ is true, Q.2/ is true, Q.3/ is true, etc. But of course, that would

Proof by Mathematical Induction
421
never lead to a proof that the statement is true for every positive integer, because some very
large n might be a counterexample, and we might never get far enough to discover it. But
suppose, while checking values, we discover a systematic argument that allows us to prove
that whenever Q.n/ is true, it follows logically that Q.n C 1/ must necessarily also be
true. We could prove Q.1/ by hand and then program a computer, using our systematic
argument, to print out a proof that Q.2/ follows from Q.1/, then that Q.3/ follows from
Q.2/, etc. Although this would still only produce proofs of ﬁnitely many cases, if our
systematic argument is sound, then we can be conﬁdent that the statement could eventually
be veriﬁed for any speciﬁc positive integer. Mathematical induction is a formalized way of
making this intuition rigorous.
The general pattern of a proof by mathematical induction, therefore, has two parts,
called the base case and the inductive step. In the base case, you simply prove by hand
that Q.1/ is true (this is usually easy); in the inductive step, you prove that the implication
Q.n/ ) Q.nC1/ holds for every positive integer n.
Mathematical induction is not restricted only to statements about all positive integers;
it works just as well for any statement about all integers greater than or equal to some
speciﬁed base case, say n D n0. The idea is the same: for the base case, you prove that
Q.n0/ is true; and for the inductive step, you prove that Q.n/ ) Q.n C 1/ whenever
n  n0.
The following theorem gives a formal justiﬁcation for why mathematical induction is
a valid method of proof.
Theorem F.15 (The Principle of Mathematical Induction). Let n0 be an integer, and let
Q.n/ be an open sentence in which n is a free variable representing an arbitrary integer
greater than or equal to n0. Suppose the following:
(a) BASE CASE: Q.n0/ is true.
(b) INDUCTIVE STEP: For each integer n  n0, Q.n/ ) Q.nC1/.
Then Q.n/ is true for every integer n  n0.
Proof. Assume for the sake of contradiction that there is some integer n  n0 such that
Q.n/ is false. Then there must be a smallest such integer; call it nmin. Now nmin cannot be
equal to n0, because hypothesis (a) shows that Q.n0/ is true. It follows that nmin > n0, so
if we let nsmaller D nmin 1, then we have nsmaller  n0. Since nsmaller is less than nmin and
nmin is the smallest integer greater than or equal to n0 for which Q.nmin/ is false, it must
be the case that Q.nsmaller/ is true. But (b) shows that Q.nsmaller/ ) Q.nsmaller C 1/, so
Q.nsmaller C1/ is also true. Because we arranged our deﬁnitions so that nsmaller C1 D nmin,
this means Q.nmin/ is true, which is a contradiction. Thus our assumption was false, and
we conclude that Q.n/ is true for every integer n  n0.

Appendix G
Sets and Functions
The axioms for plane geometry presented in this book use set theory as an underlying
foundation. In our description of the axioms beginning in Chapter 3, we assume that you
are familiar with the basic terminology and properties of set theory and functions. In this
appendix, we give a brief review of the parts of the theory that we will use. For a somewhat
more complete introduction, consult any introductory book on mathematical reasoning,
such as [Ecc97] or [Vel06]. If you want a more systematic introduction to set theory as a
subject in its own right, you can consult an introductory set theory text such as [Dev93] or
[Hal74]. Throughout this appendix, we use the concepts and terminology of mathematical
logic described in Appendices E and F.
Basic Concepts
A set is a collection of objects, considered as a whole. The objects that make up the set are
called its elements or its members. The elements of a set may be any objects whatsoever,
but for our purposes, they will usually be mathematical objects, as described in Appendix
E. The notation x 2 X means that the object x is an element of the set X. The words
collection and family are synonyms for set.
In rigorous axiomatic developments of set theory, the words set and element are taken
as primitive undeﬁned terms. (It would be very difﬁcult to deﬁne the word “set” without
using some word such as “collection,” which is essentially a synonym for “set.”) Instead
of giving a general mathematical deﬁnition of what it means to be a set or for an object to
be an element of a set, mathematicians characterize each particular set by giving a precise
deﬁnition of what it means for an object to be a element of that set—this is called the
set’s membership criterion. The membership criterion for a set X is a statement of the
form “x 2 X , P.x/,” where P.x/ is some open sentence that is true precisely for those
objects x that are elements of X, and no others. For example, if Q is the set of all rational
numbers, then the membership criterion for Q could be expressed as follows:
x 2 Q
,
x D p=q for some integers p and q with q ¤ 0:
423

424
G. Sets and Functions
The essential characteristic of sets is that two sets are equal if and only if they have
the same elements. Thus if X and Y are sets, then X D Y if and only if every element of
X is an element of Y and every element of Y is an element of X. Symbolically,
X D Y
if and only if
8x; x 2 X , x 2 Y:
If X and Y are sets such that every element of X is also an element of Y , then we say
X is a subset of Y , written X  Y . Thus
X  Y
if and only if
8x; x 2 X ) x 2 Y:
The notation Y  X (“Y is a superset of X”) means the same as X  Y . Using the concept
of subsets, we can restate the criterion for two sets to be equal as follows:
X D Y
if and only if
X  Y and Y  X:
If X  Y but X ¤ Y , we say that X is a proper subset of Y (or Y is a proper superset
of X). Some authors use the notations X  Y and Y  X to mean that X is a proper subset
of Y ; however, since other authors use the symbol “” to mean any subset, not necessarily
proper, we generally avoid using this notation and instead say explicitly when a subset is
proper.
Deﬁning Sets
We begin with a few sets whose existence and basic properties we take for granted.
 THE EMPTY SET: The set containing no elements is called the empty set; it is denoted
by ¿. It is the only set that satisﬁes the following equivalent properties:
:.9x; x 2 ¿/
or
8x; x … ¿:
 THE SET OF REAL NUMBERS: The set of all real numbers is denoted by R. The
properties of this set are summarized in Appendix H.
 THE SET OF INTEGERS: The integers (or whole numbers), denoted by Z, form a
subset of R. The properties of the integers are also summarized in Appendix H.
Beyond these basic sets, there are essentially two ways to deﬁne new sets. You will
see that in each case, the set is completely determined by its membership criterion.
 DEFINING A SET BY LISTING ELEMENTS: Given any list of objects that can be
explicitly named, the set containing those objects and no others is denoted by listing
the objects between braces: fc1;c2;:::;cng. The membership criterion is easy to
express:
a 2 fc1;c2;:::;cng
,
a D c1 or a D c2 or ::: or a D cn:
For example, the set f0;1;2g contains the numbers 0, 1, and 2, and nothing else.
Because a set is completely determined by which elements it contains, it does not
matter what order the elements are listed in or whether they are repeated; the notations
f0;1;2g, f2;1;0g, and f0;0;1;2;1;1g all denote the same set. A set containing exactly
one element is called a singleton.
 DEFINING A SET BY SPECIFICATION: Given a set D and an open sentence P.x/
in which x represents an element of D, there is a set whose elements are precisely
those x 2 D for which P.x/ is true. This set is denoted by either of the notations

Basic Concepts
425
fx 2 D W P.x/g or fx 2 D j P.x/g. (This notation is often called set-builder notation.)
Here is the membership criterion for this set:
a 2 fx 2 D W P.x/g
,
a 2 D and P.a/:
If the domain of x is understood or is implicit in the condition P.x/, the same set can
be denoted by fx W P.x/g. For example, the set of all positive real numbers can be
described by either of the following notations:
fx 2 R W x > 0g
or
fx W x 2 R and x > 0g:
For some sets, there is a formula that represents a typical element of the set, as
some variable or variables run through all elements of some predetermined domain.
For example, the set of perfect squares can be described as the set of all numbers of
the form n2 as n runs through the integers. In this case, we often use the following
variant of set-builder notation:
fn2 W n 2 Zg:
This is shorthand notation for fx W x D n2 for some n 2 Zg.
Operations on Sets
There are three important operations that can be used to combine sets to obtain other
sets.
 UNION: Given any sets X and Y , their union, denoted by X [ Y , is the set whose
elements are all the objects that are elements of X or elements of Y (or both). The
membership criterion is
x 2 X [Y
if and only if
x 2 X or x 2 Y:
Unions of more than two sets are deﬁned similarly:
x 2 X1 [[Xn
if and only if
x 2 X1 or ::: or x 2 Xn:
 INTERSECTION: Given sets X and Y , their intersection, denoted by X \ Y , is the
set whose elements are all the objects that are elements of both X and Y ; thus
x 2 X \Y
if and only if
x 2 X and x 2 Y:
Just as for unions, we can deﬁne intersections of more than two sets:
x 2 X1 \ \Xn
if and only if
x 2 X1 and ::: and x 2 Xn:
Given two sets X and Y , we say that X and Y intersect if X \ Y ¤ ¿, meaning
that they have at least one element in common. We say that X and Y are disjoint
if X \ Y D ¿ (i.e., if they do not intersect), meaning that they have no elements in
common. To say that more than two sets are disjoint means that each pair of sets is
disjoint; in other words, there is no element that lies in more than one of the sets.
 SET DIFFERENCE: If X and Y are sets, their difference, denoted by X XY , is the set
of all elements in X that are not in Y :
x 2 X XY
if and only if
x 2 X and x … Y:

426
G. Sets and Functions
Ordered Pairs and Cartesian Products
An ordered pair is a choice of two objects (which could be the same or different), called
the components of the ordered pair, together with a speciﬁcation of which is the ﬁrst com-
ponent and which is the second. The notation .a;b/ means the ordered pair in which a
is the ﬁrst component and b is the second. The deﬁning characteristic is that two ordered
pairs are equal if and only if their ﬁrst components are equal and their second components
are equal:
.a;b/ D .a0;b0/
if and only if
a D a0 and b D b0:
Notice that the ordered pair .a;b/ is not the same as the set fa;bg, because the order of
components matters in the former but not in the latter. Thus .1;2/ and .2;1/ are different
ordered pairs, but f1;2g and f2;1g are the same set.
Given two sets X and Y , the set of all ordered pairs of the form .x;y/ with x 2 X and
y 2 Y is called the Cartesian product of X and Y and is denoted by X 	Y . Thus
X 	Y D f.x;y/ W x 2 X and y 2 Y g:
More generally, for any positive integer n, an ordered n-tuple is a choice of n ob-
jects arranged in a sequence, denoted by .a1;:::;an/. The criterion for equality of or-
dered n-tuples is the obvious generalization of that for ordered pairs: two ordered n-tuples
.a1;:::;an/ and .a0
1;:::;a0
n/ are equal if and only if all of their corresponding components
are equal:
.a1;:::;an/ D .a0
1;:::;a0
n/
if and only if
a1 D a0
1; a2 D a0
2; :::; and an D a0
n:
If X1;:::;Xn are sets, the notation X1 	 	Xn denotes the set of all ordered n-tuples of
the form .x1;:::;xn/, in which x1 2 X1, x2 2 X2, . . . , and xn 2 Xn. In particular, if all of
the sets are the same set X, the n-fold Cartesian product X 		X is usually denoted by
Xn; it is the set of all ordered n-tuples of the form .x1;:::;xn/ in which x1;:::;xn are all
elements of X. For example, Rn denotes the n-fold Cartesian product of R with itself; it
is just the set of all ordered n-tuples .x1;:::;xn/ in which each xi is a real number.
Proofs in Set Theory
Many theorems in geometry (as well as in most other ﬁelds of mathematics) are actu-
ally statements about sets. Here are some guidelines for proving such statements.
 PROVING THAT SOMETHING IS AN ELEMENT OF A SET: If X is a speciﬁc set and
you wish to prove that some object a is an element of X, then you just have to prove
that a satisﬁes the membership criterion for that set. Thus, for example, if X is
deﬁned by speciﬁcation, as in X D fx 2 D W P.x/g, a proof that a 2 X needs to show
the following:
a 2 D and P.a/:
 PROVING THAT ONE SET IS A SUBSET OF ANOTHER: Suppose X and Y are sets. To
prove that X  Y , just prove the following universal implication:
8x; x 2 X ) x 2 Y:
 PROVING THAT TWO SETS ARE EQUAL: Suppose X and Y are sets. Because the
statement “X D Y ” is equivalent to “X  Y and Y  X,” a proof that the sets X and

Ordered Pairs and Cartesian Products
427
Y are equal to each other will typically have two parts:
Part 1: 8x; x 2 X ) x 2 Y:
Part 2: 8x; x 2 Y ) x 2 X:
 PROVING THAT A SET IS NONEMPTY: To prove that a set X is not equal to the empty
set, you just need to prove that it contains at least one element. This is an existence
statement:
9x; x 2 X:
 PROVING THAT A SET IS EMPTY: If X is a set, to prove that X D ¿ is to prove that
there does not exist any element of X:
:.9x; x 2 X/:
Like any nonexistence statement, this is usually easiest to do by an indirect proof:
assume that there exists an element x 2 X and derive a contradiction.
Here is an example of a typical proof of set equality.
Theorem G.1. If X and Y are any sets, then .X XY /[Y D X [Y .
Proof. First we will show that .X XY / [Y  X [Y . Suppose x is an arbitrary element
of .X XY / [Y . By deﬁnition of union, this means that x 2 X XY or x 2 Y . In the case
that x 2 X X Y , this means by deﬁnition that x 2 X and x … Y ; in particular, x 2 X, so
x 2 X [Y . In the second case, x 2 Y , which also implies x 2 X [Y .
Conversely, we will show that X [Y  .X XY /[Y . Suppose x 2 X [Y . Then either
x 2 X or x 2 Y . If x 2 Y , then x 2 .X XY /[Y by deﬁnition of union. On the other hand,
if x 2 X, then there are two subcases: either x 2 Y or not. If x 2 Y , then x 2 .X XY /[Y
as before; if x … Y , then we have x 2 X XY , which also implies x 2 .X XY /[Y .

G. Sets and Functions
Functions
Suppose X and Y are sets. A function from X to Y is a rule that assigns to each element
x 2 X one and only one element y 2 Y , called the value of f at x. If f is a function and
x 2 X, the value of f at x is usually denoted by f .x/, so the equation y D f .x/ means
“y is the value of f at x.” The set X is called the domain of f , and the set Y is called
its codomain (or sometimes its range). The notation f WX ! Y means “f is a function
from X to Y ” (or, depending on how it is used in a sentence, “the function f from X to
Y ” or “f , a function from X to Y ” or “f , from X to Y ”). The words map and mapping
are synonyms for function.
To say that two functions are equal is to say that they have the same domain, same
codomain, and the same rule of assignment. Thus, if f WX ! Y and gWX 0 ! Y 0 are
functions, then f D g if and only if X D X0, Y D Y 0, and f .x/ D g.x/ for every x 2 X.
To deﬁne a function f WX ! Y , you have to specify the domain X and the codomain
Y and then give a rule (or a formula or an algorithm) that speciﬁes unambiguously, for
every element x 2 X, what should be the value f .x/ 2 Y . Typically the rule is expressed
by writing a formula, as in “f .x/ D :::”; this is always understood to mean that f .x/ is
given by the indicated formula for every x in the domain.
To ensure that the given rule actually deﬁnes a function, you have to make sure that it
gives one and only one value for every element of the domain. The following two quantiﬁed
statements express the requirements for f to be a well-deﬁned function:
8x 2 X; 9y 2 Y; f .x/ D yI
(G.1)
8x1;x2 2 X; x1 D x2 ) f .x1/ D f .x2/:
(G.2)
The ﬁrst condition says that for each x in the domain, f produces some value in the
codomain. The second condition says that f yields only one value for each element of the
domain; in other words, if you give f the same input twice, it will produce the same output
both times. The ﬁrst condition is often expressed by saying that f is everywhere deﬁned,
and the second by saying that it is uniquely deﬁned. If both of these conditions hold, we
say that f is well deﬁned. (This is just a fancy way of saying that f is a function.)
For example, we could deﬁne the “squaring function” from R to R by saying “let
f WR ! R be the function deﬁned by f .x/ D x2.” This means that the domain of f is R,
the codomain is also R, and for every x 2 R, the value of f at x is x2. Because x2 always
yields a single real number whenever x is a real number, this is well deﬁned.
We could also deﬁne the “absolute value function” gWR ! R by
g.x/ D
®
x;
x  0;
x;
x  0:
To check that g is well deﬁned, we ﬁrst note that there is at least one formula for g.x/
whenever x is any real number, so g is everywhere deﬁned. If x ¤ 0, only one of the
formulas applies, so g.x/ is a uniquely deﬁned real number; however, we have given two
formulas for g.0/, since both x  0 and x  0 apply when x D 0. Since both formulas
yield the same value for g.0/, namely g.0/ D 0, we can conclude that g is also uniquely
deﬁned, and thus we have a well-deﬁned function.

Functions
429
Notice that when we deﬁne the rule of assignment for a function, there is actually
an implied universal quantiﬁer: in the deﬁnition of the function f WR ! R above, the
statement “f .x/ D x2” actually means “for all x 2 R; f .x/ D x2.” Thereafter, we should
only use the notation f .x/ when x refers to some speciﬁc element of the domain. The
notation f .x/ refers to the value of f at a speciﬁc element x, which is an element of Y ;
while the notation f refers to the entire function (including its domain, its codomain, and
its rule of assignment). Thus, in careful mathematical writing, it is not appropriate to refer
to “the function f .x/.”
Surjective, Injective, and Bijective Functions
Suppose f WX ! Y is a function. Every value of f is an element of the codomain Y ;
but the deﬁnition does not require that every element of Y is a value of the function. For
example, consider the squaring function f WR ! R that we mentioned above, deﬁned by
f .x/ D x2 for all x 2 R. Not all elements of R occur as values of this function, because
x2 never takes on negative values. Functions that do take on all values of the codomain
have a special name: a function f WX ! Y is said to be surjective, or to map X onto Y , if
for every y 2 Y , there is some x 2 X such that f .x/ D y. Symbolically, f is surjective if
and only if it satisﬁes the following condition:
8y 2 Y; 9x 2 X; f .x/ D y:
(G.3)
Another important aspect of the deﬁnition of a function is that it does not prevent
different elements of the domain from being mapped to the same element of the codomain.
The squaring function, for example, maps two different real numbers to each positive real
number, because f .x/ D f .x/. Functions for which this never occurs also have a special
name: a function f WX ! Y is said to be injective or one-to-one if f .x1/ D f .x2/ implies
x1 D x2 whenever x1 and x2 are elements of X. Symbolically, f is injective if and only if
8x1;x2 2 X; f .x1/ D f .x2/ ) x1 D x2:
(G.4)
This is often simpler to understand if phrased in terms of the contrapositive: if x1 ¤ x2,
then f .x1/ ¤ f .x2/. In words, this means that f takes different elements of the domain
to different elements of the codomain. Be sure you understand the difference between
condition (G.1) for f to be everywhere deﬁned (part of what it means to be a function) and
condition (G.3) for it to be surjective; and likewise, be sure you understand the difference
between (G.2) for f to be uniquely deﬁned (also part of the deﬁnition of a function) and
condition (G.4) for it to be injective.
A function that is both surjective and injective is said to be bijective. Putting together
the deﬁnitions above, we see that to say f WX ! Y is bijective means that for every x 2 X,
there is one and only one y 2 Y such that f .x/ D y (this says that f is a well-deﬁned
function); and for every y 2 Y , there is one and only one x 2 X such that f .x/ D y (there
exists at least one such x by surjectivity and at most one by injectivity). For this reason,
the term one-to-one correspondence is often used as a synonym for a bijective function;
but you have to take care to remember that a “one-to-one correspondence” (i.e., a bijective
function) is different from a “one-to-one function” (i.e., an injective function). Because of

430
G. Sets and Functions
this potential ambiguity and also because “onto” is awkward to use as an adjective, in this
book we use only the terms surjective, injective, and bijective for these concepts.
Proofs about Functions
Here are some common types of proofs involving functions.
 PROVING THAT A FUNCTION IS WELL DEFINED: Suppose we are given two sets
X and Y and a rule of assignment that is supposed to represent a function f WX !
Y . To prove that f is well deﬁned, you have to prove the following existence and
uniqueness statement:
for every x 2 X, there is one and only one y 2 Y such that f .x/ D y.
 PROVING THAT TWO FUNCTIONS ARE EQUAL: As we mentioned above, to prove
that two functions are equal, you have to show that they have the same domain, same
codomain, and same rule of assignment. Since the domain and codomain are usually
stated as part of the deﬁnition of a function, it is the rule of assignment that typically
has to be checked. Thus if f WX ! Y and gWX ! Y are two functions from X to Y ,
proving that f D g means proving the following universal statement:
for every x 2 X; f .x/ D g.x/:
 PROVING THAT A FUNCTION IS SURJECTIVE: To prove that f WX ! Y is surjective,
you must prove the universal statement (G.3). Thus you would begin by letting y be
an arbitrary element of Y , and then somehow you would produce an element x 2 X
that satisﬁes the equation f .x/ D y. Often, an appropriate x can be found by writing
down the equation f .x/ D y and solving for x. The process of ﬁnding such an x
is not actually part of the proof (although it might be helpful to include it so that the
reader sees where the value of x came from); the actual proof of surjectivity is simply
the demonstration that the chosen value of x satisﬁes the equation f .x/ D y.
 PROVING THAT A FUNCTION IS INJECTIVE: To prove that f WX ! Y is injective,
you need to prove the universal implication (G.4). Typically, such a proof begins by
letting x1 and x2 be arbitrary elements of X and assuming that f .x1/ D f .x2/; then
you have to prove that this equation implies x1 D x2. (It is almost always easier to
prove injectivity using (G.4) instead of its contrapositive, even though the contrapos-
itive gives a better intuitive feeling for what injectivity means.)
 PROVING THAT A FUNCTION IS BIJECTIVE: Finally, to prove that f is bijective, you
have to prove both of the statements above. Thus a proof of bijectivity will have two
parts: one part to prove surjectivity and another to prove injectivity.
It is important to observe that injectivity, surjectivity, and bijectivity depend critically
on the choice of domain and codomain, not only on the rule of assignment. For example,
the following theorem shows how the same rule of assignment can yield functions with
different properties, just by changing the domain and codomain. It will also serve as an
illustration of how to prove surjectivity, injectivity, and bijectivity.

Theorem G.4. Let W D fx 2 R W x  0g denote the set of all nonnegative real numbers,
and deﬁne four functions as follows:
f1WR ! R;
deﬁned by f1.x/ D x2,
f2WR ! W;
deﬁned by f2.x/ D x2,
f3WW ! R;
deﬁned by f3.x/ D x2,
f4WW ! W;
deﬁned by f4.x/ D x2.
Then f1 is neither injective nor surjective; f2 is surjective but not injective; f3 is injective
but not surjective; and f4 is bijective.
Proof. First we consider f1. To prove that f1 is not surjective, we need to prove the nega-
tion of the statement “for all y 2 R, there exists x 2 R satisfying x2 D y.” This negation
is equivalent to the following existence statement: “there exists y 2 R such that there is
no x 2 R satisfying x2 D y.” In other words, we need to ﬁnd real number y that is not the
square of another real number. Any negative number will do: for example, 1 is in the
codomain but there is no real number x such that f1.x/ D 1.” Thus f1 is not surjective.
To show that f1 is not injective, we need to prove the negation of “for all x1;x2 2 R, if
.x1/2 D .x2/2, then x1 D x2.” Thus again we need to prove an existence statement: “there
exist x1;x2 2 R such that .x1/2 D .x2/2 but x1 ¤ x2.” We can take, for example, x1 D 1
and x2 D 1, because 12 D .1/2 while 1 ¤ 1.
Next consider f2. This function is not injective for the same reason as f1: the numbers
1 and 1 are two distinct elements of the domain of f2 such that 12 D .1/2. To show
that f2 is surjective, we need to prove the following statement: “for every y 2 W , there
exists x 2 R such that x2 D y.” Let y 2 W be arbitrary (or, in other words, let y be an
arbitrary nonnegative real number). Theorem H.10(h) in Appendix H shows that y has a
nonnegative square root x D py, and this number satisﬁes f2.x/ D
py
2 D y.
Now consider f3. It is not surjective because it never produces negative values: for
example, 1 is an element of the codomain, but there is no x 2 W such that x2 D 1.
To prove that f3 is injective, suppose x1 and x2 are elements of W (i.e., nonnegative real
numbers) such that f3.x1/ D f3.x2/, which means .x1/2 D .x2/2. Then Theorem H.10(l)
implies that x1 D ˙x2. Thus there are two cases: either x1 D x2 or x1 D x2. In the ﬁrst
case, since x2  0, it follows by algebra that x1 D x2  0; but since our hypothesis that
x1 2 W implies x1  0, it follows from Theorem H.8(s) that x1 D 0, and therefore x2 D 0
as well. Thus x1 D x2 in this case. In the second case, the same result holds by hypothesis.
Finally, consider f4. To show that f4 is surjective, we just carry out the same argument
that we used to prove surjectivity of f2. Similarly, the argument that f3 is injective also
applies to f4. Alternatively, we can just note that Theorem H.10(h) shows that for every
y 2 W there exists one and only one x 2 W such that x2 D y, namely x D py.

Appendix H
Properties of
the Real Numbers
Because our axioms for plane geometry are predicated on an understanding of the real
number system, it is important to establish clearly what properties of the real numbers we
are taking for granted. In this appendix, we summarize those properties.
Primitive Terms
Just as in geometry, some terms must remain undeﬁned to avoid circularity. You know
intuitively what these terms mean already; these descriptions are just meant to ensure that
we’re all thinking about the same things when we use the terms. Everything we need to
know about these terms is contained in the properties listed below.
 Real number: Intuitively, a real number represents a point on the number line or
a (signed) distance left or right from the origin or any quantity that has a ﬁnite or
inﬁnite decimal representation. Real numbers include integers, positive and negative
fractions, and irrational numbers like
p
2, , and e.
 Integer: An integer is a whole number (positive, negative, or zero).
 Zero: The number zero is denoted by 0.
 One: The number one is denoted by 1.
 Addition: The result of adding two real numbers x and y is denoted by x Cy and is
called the sum of x and y.
 Multiplication: The result of multiplying two real numbers x and y is denoted by xy
or x y or x y and is called the product of x and y.
 Less than: To say that x is less than y, denoted by x < y, means intuitively that x is
to the left of y on the number line.

Appendix I
Rigid Motions:
Another Approach
In Chapter 5, we mentioned that it is possible to substitute some sort of motion postulate
in place of the SAS postulate and thereby to vindicate Euclid’s “method of superposition.”
In this appendix we describe that approach.
The intuitive notion of “moving” geometric ﬁgures around is formalized in the fol-
lowing concept. A transformation of the plane is a bijective map F from the plane to
itself. A rigid motion of the plane is a transformation such that for any points A;B;C, if
A0 D F.A/, B0 D F.B/, and C 0 D F.C/, then the following properties hold:
A. ANGLE MEASURE IS PRESERVED: If †ABC is an angle, then so is †A0B0C 0, and
m†A0B0C 0 D m†ABC.
B. BETWEENNESS OF POINTS IS PRESERVED: If AB C, then A0 B0 C 0.
C. COLLINEARITY IS PRESERVED: If A;B;C are collinear, then so are A0;B0;C 0.
D. DISTANCE IS PRESERVED: AB D A0B0.
Technically, the requirement that rigid motions preserve betweenness is redundant, because
if F is a bijective map from the plane to itself that preserves collinearity and distances, it
follows from the partial converse to the betweenness theorem for points (Theorem 3.11,
whose proof did not rely on the SAS postulate) that F automatically preserves betweenness
as well. However, including betweenness and arranging the properties in alphabetical order
makes the list easy to remember—this is often referred to as the ABCD property of rigid
motions.
Without trying to prove anything yet, let us think intuitively about a few examples of
rigid motions in Euclidean geometry. If you imagine a portion of the plane as a piece of
paper sitting on a tabletop, you can visualize rigid motions as the results of sliding the
paper along the table or picking the paper up and turning it over, without changing any of
the geometric relationships among ﬁgures on the paper. Here are some familiar types of
441

3.9), exactly one of these three points is between the other two; for deﬁniteness, let us say
that A0 B0 C 0. Because A0B0 < A0C 0, which in turn is equal to AC, Euclid’s segment
cutoff theorem (Corollary 3.37) shows that there is a unique point P 2 IntAC such that
AP D A0B0. Then because AP D A0B0 and AC D A0C 0, it follows from the segment
subtraction theorem (Theorem 3.22(c)) that P C D B0C 0.
Let P 0 D F.P /. Because A;P;C are collinear and F preserves collinearity, it follows
that A0;P 0;C 0 are collinear; and because F preserves distances and betweenness, it follows
that A0  P 0  C 0 and A0P 0 D AP D A0B0. However, we are assuming that B0 satisﬁes
A0 B0 C 0; thus P 0 and B0 are both points on
!
A0C 0 at the same distance from A, so the
unique point theorem (Corollary 3.36) implies that P 0 D B0, or in other words F.P / D
F.B/. Because P lies on
 !
AB but B does not, P and B are distinct, so this contradicts the
fact that F is injective. This completes the proof that A0;B0;C 0 are noncollinear.
Now, because F preserves distances, we have AB D A0B0, BC D B0C 0, and AC D
A0C 0; and because it preserves angle measures, we also have m†ABC D m†A0B0C 0,
m†ACB D m†A0C 0B0, and m†BAC D m†B0A0C 0. Thus 4A0B0C 0 Š 4ABC.
□
If we wish to use rigid motions in place of the SAS postulate, we need a postulate that
ensures there are enough rigid motions to superimpose one triangle upon another if they
satisfy the SAS hypotheses. It turns out that we don’t need to assume very much, because
all of the needed rigid motions can be built up from successive reﬂections. To state the
postulate concisely, we introduce the following deﬁnition. If F is a rigid motion and A is
a point, F is said to ﬁx A, and A is said to be a ﬁxed point of F , if F.A/ D A.
As we will see below, the following postulate serves as an adequate substitute for the
SAS postulate.
Postulate 90 (The Reﬂection Postulate). For every line `, there is a rigid motion
R`, called reﬂection across `, that ﬁxes every point of ` but no other points.
Before proving that the reﬂection postulate implies SAS, let us develop some basic
properties of reﬂections.
Lemma I.2 (Properties of Reﬂections). Suppose ` is a line and A is a point not on `.
(a) A and R`.A/ lie on opposite sides of `.
(b) A point A0 is equal to R`.A/ if and only if ` is the perpendicular bisector of AA0.

I. Rigid Motions: Another Approach
This theorem shows that we could have chosen the reﬂection postulate in place of the
SAS postulate, and we would have been able to prove all of the same theorems in neutral,
Euclidean, and hyperbolic geometries. In addition, there are some other advantages to
basing an axiomatic system on the theory of rigid motions.
One of the most useful features of rigid motions is that they allow one to give a uniform
deﬁnition of congruence that applies to ﬁgures of all kinds, instead of having to give sepa-
rate deﬁnitions as we did for congruence of segments, angles, triangles, convex polygons,
etc. In this approach, one says that two sets of points S1 and S2 are congruent if there is a
rigid motion F such that F.S1/ D S2, where F.S1/ D fF.A/ W A 2 S1g represents the set
of images of points in S1. Of course, if this deﬁnition is adopted, then for each different
type of ﬁgure, one must prove a theorem that shows congruence is equivalent to having
equal corresponding measurements—for example, there would be a theorem for triangles
that says two triangles are congruent if and only if there is a correspondence between their
vertices such that corresponding side lengths and corresponding angle measures are equal.
Thus the main advantage of using this general deﬁnition of congruence is one of conceptual
unity rather than efﬁciency.
Another advantage of basing the axiomatic system on rigid motions is that it leads
naturally to a deeper study of rigid motions for their own sake. Since moving things around
is part of our everyday experience with geometric objects, this is a natural, useful, and
satisfying ﬁeld of study. Some of the types of theorems that can be proved are indicated in
the exercises at the end of this appendix.
SAS Implies Reﬂection
Thanks to Theorem I.3, we now know that the reﬂection postulate is strong enough to
allow us to prove all the theorems we proved using the SAS postulate. One might wonder
whether it is even stronger than SAS—might the reﬂection postulate allow us to prove
theorems that cannot be derived from SAS? In this section, we prove that it is not stronger,
because the reﬂection postulate can also be derived from SAS.
Theorem I.4 (SAS Implies Reﬂection). If Postulates 1–8 and the SAS postulate are true,
then the reﬂection postulate is also true.
Proof. Assume that Postulates 1–8 and the SAS postulate are all true. Because of this as-
sumption, we may use all of the theorems of neutral geometry that were proved in Chapters
3–9.
Let ` be a line. We need to prove that there is a rigid motion R` that ﬁxes points on
` but no others. Here is how to deﬁne R`. If A is a point on `, we just let R`.A/ D A. If
A … `, we let R`.A/ D A0, where A0 is the unique point such that ` is the perpendicular
bisector of AA0; the existence and uniqueness of such a point is guaranteed by Theorem
7.10.
Before we show that R` is an isometry, we will show ﬁrst that applying R` twice
brings every point back to its initial position:
R`.R`.A// D A
for all A:
(I.1)
To prove this, we consider two cases. First, if A 2 `, then R`.A/ D A, so R`.R`.A// D
R`.A/ D A. On the other hand, if A … `, let A0 D R`.A/; by deﬁnition, this means that `

SAS Implies Reﬂection
447
is the perpendicular bisector of AA0. Since AA0 D A0A, this also means that A D R`.A0/,
so R`.R`.A// D R`.A0/ D A.
Next we need to show that R` is bijective. To prove injectivity, suppose A1 and A2 are
points such that R`.A1/ D R`.A2/. Applying R` to both sides and using (I.1), we obtain
A1 D R`.R`.A1// D R`.R`.A2// D A2;
so R` is injective. To prove surjectivity, let A0 be an arbitrary point, and let A D R`.A0/.
Then (I.1) implies
R`.A/ D R`.R`.A0// D A0;
so R` is surjective.
For the rest of the proof, for brevity, let us adopt the convention that if A is any point,
then A0 denotes the point R`.A/.
Our next task is to show that R` preserves distances. Let A and B be arbitrary points.
We need to show that A0B0 D AB. There are six cases, illustrated in Fig. I.7.

CASE 1: A D B. In this case, A0 D B0 and therefore A0B0 D 0 D AB. In all of the
remaining cases, we assume A ¤ B.
CASE 2: A and B both lie on `. In this case A0 D A and B0 D B, so it is immediate
that A0B0 D AB.

jf .A0/j, it follows that f .A0/ D ˙f .A/. Since A ¤ A0 and f is injective, it cannot be the
case that f .A0/ D f .A/, so we must have f .A0/ D f .A/. On the other hand, if A 2 `,

448

then A D A0 D X, and f .A0/ D f .A/ D 0, which implies again that f .A0/ D f .A/. A
similar analysis shows that f .B0/ D f .B/. Therefore
A0B0 D jf .B0/f .A0/j D j.f .B//.f .A//j D jf .B/f .A/j D AB:
CASE 4:
 !
AB 6? `, and one of the points lies on ` but the other does not. We may
assume A … `. Let F be the midpoint of AA0, which lies on `. Then 4AFB Š 4A0FB
by SAS, so AB D A0B D A0B0.
CASE 5:
 !
AB 6? `, and A and B lie on the same side of `. Let F be the midpoint of
AA0 and let G be the midpoint of BB0, so F;G 2 `. Then AF k BF by the common per-
pendicular theorem, so ABGF and A0B0GF are both trapezoids by the trapezoid lemma.
It then follows from SASAS that ABGF Š A0B0GF , so AB D A0B0.
CASE 6:
 !
AB 6? `, and A and B lie on opposite sides of `. Let F and G be the mid-
points of AA0 and BB0 as before, and let X be the point where AB meets `. It follows that
A  X  B, and therefore †AXF Š †BXG by the vertical angles theorem. The diagram
suggests that A0 X B0 as well, but we do not yet know that because we have not proved
that reﬂections preserve betweenness or collinearity. Note that the argument in Case 5
shows that A0X D AX and B0X D BX, so 4A0XF Š 4AXF and 4B0XG Š 4BXG
by SAS. Therefore, †A0XF Š †AXF and †BXG Š †B0XG, so †A0XF Š †B0XG
by transitivity. Now it follows from the partial converse to the vertical angles theorem
(Theorem 4.18) that
!
XA0 and
!
XB0 are opposite rays, and thus it is indeed the case that
A0 X B0. Therefore,
A0B0 D A0X CXB0 D AX CXB D AB:
This completes the proof that R` preserves distances.
The rest of the properties now follow easily. First consider betweenness. Suppose
AB C. Then AB CBC D AC by the betweenness theorem for points, and because F
preserves distances it follows that A0B0 CB0C 0 D A0C 0. Now it follows from the converse
to the betweenness theorem (Corollary 5.20) that A0  B0  C 0, so R` preserves between-
ness.
Next we prove that R` preserves collinearity. Suppose A;B;C are collinear points. If
the points are not all distinct, then the set fA0;B0;C 0g contains at most two points, so there
is certainly a line containing them. If the points A;B;C are distinct, then one of them is
between the other two by Hilbert’s betweenness axiom (Theorem 3.9), say AB C. The
fact that R` preserves betweenness implies A0  B0  C 0, which means in particular that
A0;B0;C 0 are collinear.
Finally, to see that R` preserves angle measures, suppose †ABC is an angle. Be-
cause R` is injective, it follows that neither A0 nor C 0 is equal to B0, so †A0B0C 0 is
also an angle. If m†ABC D 180ı, then A  B  C, which implies A0  B0  C 0 and thus
m†A0B0C 0 D 180ı as well. If m†ABC D 0ı, then C 2 Int
!
AB , which means AC B,
C D B, or AB C. It follows that A0 C 0 B0, C 0 D B0, or A0 B0 C 0, respectively,
each of which implies
!
A0C 0 D
!
A0B0 , so m†A0B0C 0 D 0ı. Finally, if †ABC is a proper
angle, then 4ABC is a triangle. If A0;B0;C 0 were collinear, then A;B;C would also be
collinear because R`.A0/ D A, R`.B0/ D B, and R`.C 0/ D C, so 4A0B0C 0 is also a tri-
angle. Because R` preserves distances, it follows that 4A0B0C 0 Š 4ABC by SSS, and
therefore m†A0B0C 0 D m†ABC. Thus R` preserves angle measures.

Exercises
The following exercises should all be done in the context of Euclidean geometry. You
may assume either the SAS postulate or the reﬂection postulate; since each one implies
the other, they both are true in Euclidean geometry. Some of these exercises are more
elaborate than most of the ones in this book, so they might serve well as starting points for
independent projects.
IA. Given rigid motions F and G, the composition of F with G is the map G ı F from
the plane to itself deﬁned by G ıF.A/ D G.F.A// for every point A (i.e., ﬁrst apply
F , then G). Prove that every composition of rigid motions is a rigid motion.
IB. Suppose A;B;C are noncollinear points and F and G are two rigid motions such that
F.A/ D G.A/, F.B/ D G.B/, and F.C/ D G.C/. Prove that F.X/ D G.X/ for
every point X.
IC. Prove that every rigid motion of the plane can be expressed as a composition of one,
two, or three reﬂections. [Hint: If F is an arbitrary rigid motion, argue as in the proof
of Theorem I.3 to show that there is another rigid motion F 0 composed of at most three
reﬂections that agrees with F at three noncollinear points.]

along XY if it satisﬁes the following property: if A is any point and A0 D F.A/, then
AA0 D XY and

F is called a rotation about O through angle  if it satisﬁes the following property:
F.O/ D O, and if A is any point distinct from O and A0 D F.A/, then m†AOA0 D ı.
Prove that a rigid motion is a rotation if and only if it is a composition of two reﬂections
across nonparallel lines.
IF. A rigid motion F is called a glide reﬂection if it is a composition of a reﬂection across
a line ` followed by a translation along a segment parallel to `. Prove that a rigid
motion is a glide reﬂection if and only if it is a composition of reﬂections across three
distinct lines, the ﬁrst of which is perpendicular to the other two. [Remark: It can be
shown that every rigid motion is either a reﬂection, a translation, a rotation, or a glide
reﬂection. See [Ven05, Chapter 12] for a proof.]
