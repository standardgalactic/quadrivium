Foreword 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Wildfires intrude on public awareness only periodically, when blazes in particular 
parts of the United States, mainly in the West, cause a level of destruction and 
disruption that wins attention from the national news. But particular groups of 
American, and particular professional categories, pay more consistent attention to 
the incidence and impact of wild fires. And there is some general understanding 
the wildfires risk becoming more devastating in future, because of climate changes 
and because expansion of urban sprawls put more and more communities in the 
midst of potential hazards. 
In this context, it is important to recognize that expanding branches of science are 
available to help explore the phenomenon, facilitating prediction and management 
alike. This book, building on the expansion of computational facilities at George 
Mason University’s EastFIRE Lab and on other research contributions, provides 
important evidence of the relevance of remote sensing and modeling to 
understanding wildland fires and to the provision of effective management 
decisions. The issue is national and international alike, and the contributions of a 
growing global community of scholars to this focus for remote sensing provides 
a vigorous basis for further research and for advanced training. This book deals 
principally with the eastern United States, where issues are less familiar to a wider 
public but the potential problems are acute. However, the findings and procedures 
have broader applicability, as an important sub-discipline steadily gains in maturity 
and visibility.

Abstract Wildland fire is one of the most disastrous natural hazards 
threatening life and properties. The rapid growth of wildland-urban interface 
since last century has increased the complexity of fire management. It is 
important to exploit new technologies for fire risk assessment, fuel 
management, wildland fire detection, fire behavior modeling, smoke emissions 
estimation, and analysis of fire impacts on air quality. This book contains 23 
chapters, covering various topics related wildland fires, including satellite 
remote sensing applications for fire detection and monitoring, fire behavior 
simulation, smoke emissions and monitoring, and fuel managements. It can 
be used as a reference book for graduate students and researchers interested 
in wildland fire study. 
Keywords Wildland fires, Remote sensing, Fire behavior model, Air quality, 
Fire management 
 
 
Wildland fire is one of major natural hazards. For the last century, North American 
forest communities have been vitally concerned with wildland fires. They have 
tried to eliminate wildland fires entirely, to reduce fire intensity, to thin and burn, 
and even to return to a more naturally occurring wildland fire regime. Urban and 
suburban growth through the 20th century has dramatically increased the association 
of housing and people with wildlands, increasing the complexity of fuel management 
and fire fighting activities. Since topography, climate, ecosystems, and development 
patterns are all so different in east and west, it is time for a focused look at these 
issues from an eastern perspective. The EastFIRE conference brings together 
researchers, subject matter experts, technicians, vendors, and decision makers to 
share information on using remote sensing (RS), decision support systems and 
simulation to better manage wildland fire in the eastern United States. Planned

products of this conference will capture the significant outcomes for determining 
future plans of action. 
The core of this book arose from the EastFIRE conference held at George Mason 
university May 11  13, 2005 (http://eastfire.gmu.edu/workshop). The primary 
objectives of the conference are: ķ Develop bridging approaches that link ecology 
and the physical sciences at local, landscape, state, and regional scales for 
wildland fire in the east. ĸ Suggest decision support views of integrated data for 
policy makers and front-line decision-makers. Ĺ Share information on new 
technologies and techniques which address eastern states fire management issues. 
ĺ Create new understanding of the challenges ahead for eastern states wildland 
fire management and how RS might better address them. Ļ Create appreciation 
for geographic scale issues in wildland fire management and rehabilitation in the 
east, and descriptions of experiences in applying RS and simulation modeling  
to these issues. The Conference would accelerate coalescence of scientists and 
managers around a strategy aimed at providing timely, cost effective, and technically 
appropriate fire related information to the broad and diverse fire community of 
the Eastern United States. We believe that the conference was largely successful 
in providing that acceleration. Over 111 papers were delivered at the conference 
covering, by over 100 authors representing a diverse area of public and private 
institutions. Based on session chairs’ suggestions, the EastFIRE conference editorial 
board selected 28 tentative chapters for the book. 
We proposed five sessions: ķ research needs and programs; ĸ fire-atmosphere, 
Ĺ fire-RS; ĺ fire-modeling, and Ļ Fuels and impacts. This book can be use a 
reference book for graduate and under graduate students. This book includes 23 
chapters in total. 
In Chapter 2, Dr. William T. Sommers discusses “Wildland Fire and Eastern 
states diversity” (Sommers, 2010), provides an introduction of wildland fires in 
the Eastern United States. Much of wildland fire management, research and resource 
allocation in the United States is focused on the Western states, while the Eastern 
states are different from the west in terms of ecosystems, climate, land use, and 
demographics etc., it is necessary to study the characteristics of wildland fires in 
the eastern states so as to meet the diverse needs of eastern fire managements. 
In Chapter 3, Dr. John A. Stanturf and Dr. Michael C. Wimberly analyze demo- 
graphic trends in the Eastern United States and the impacts on fire management 
(Stanturf et al., 2010). The changing demographics and growing wildland urban 
interface (WUI) of the Eastern United States were characterized, and the implications 
for the land manager of the expansion of dense human settlements into fire-affected 
forests were discussed. To improve the capability of fire risk estimation and fire 
monitoring, land managers and policy makers need to exploit new approaches, 
such as RS and geographic information systems, to monitor land use change and 
update the WUI. 
Dr. LeRoy Spayd provides an overview of NOAA’s fire weather, climate and 
air quality forecast products and services in Chapter 4 (Spayd, 2010). NOAA’s

national weather service’s (NWS) fire weather program provides timely fire 
weather data and forecasts, which are critical to wildland firefighting and resource 
management. NWS climate services provide data products of major drought 
indicators, as well as services for drought monitoring and prediction. For air 
quality forecast, NOAA and the environmental protection agency (EPA) have 
teamed together to develop a national air quality forecasting (AQF) system. 
Dr. Douglas G. Fox, Dr. Allen R. Riebau, and Dr. Pete Lahm review wildland 
fire and air quality management in Chapter 5 (Fox et al., 2010). Wildland fire and 
smoke can make significant contribution to air pollution. Smoke emissions from 
fires that are not “natural”, such as prescribed fire and agricultural burning, need to 
be planned, managed, and mitigated in the same way as other air pollution sources. 
US regional Haze rule and national ambient air quality standard for particulate 
material are described, as well as recommendations for strategic and tactical 
planning, operations and evaluation of smoke management activities. 
High resolution numerical models for smoke transport in plumes from wildland 
fires are discussed by Dr. Philip Cunningham and Dr. Scott L. Goodrick in 
Chapter 6 (Cunningham et al., 2010). It is a critical problem to predict the impacts 
of wildland fires and prescribed burnings on air quality, especially in the Eastern 
United States where wildfire-prone regions are often located near populated areas. 
While various models are available for modeling the air quality impacts of smoke 
from wildland fires, it is of particular interest, to explore the fundamental dynamics 
of buoyant plumes arising from intense heat sources to assess the utility and accuracy 
of the models and identify situations in which these models may have significant 
errors. The details of a high-resolution large-eddy simulation (LES) model are 
described, and the basic time-averaged properties of the simulated plumes and their 
dependence on the heat source strength and the ambient wind are analyzed. 
Weather is one of key factors leading to extreme wildfire behavior, and may 
have significant impact on fire intensity. In Florida, sea-breeze circulations are 
frequently observed to have a significant impact on fire behavior, but the interaction 
between wildfires and the sea-breeze is still poorly understood. In Chapter 7, Dr. 
Deborah E. Hanley, Dr. Philip Cunningham, and Dr. Scott L. Goodrick conduct 
insight analysis based on radar observations and numerical simulations to explore 
the interaction between a buoyant plume and a density current (Hanley et al., 2010). 
In Chapter 8, Dr. Gary L. Achtemeier, Dr. Yongqiang Liu, and Dr. Scott L. 
Goodrick review efforts in investigating the air quality impacts of prescribed fires 
in the southern United States (Achtemeier et al., 2010). Tools for smoke transport 
and the regional air quality modeling of prescribed burns, SHRMC-4S and 
Daysmoke, are described. SHRMC-4S is a framework for smoke and air quality 
modeling focused on prescribed fires in the southern United States. Daysmoke is 
a plume model that incorporates a human factor to assist land managers in 
prescribed burning. Applications of SHRMC-4S and Daysmoke are illustrated 
with case studies.

particulate matter (PM) and ozone precursors that adversely affect regional air 
quality. Emissions from wildland fires can cause severe environmental consequences. 
Dr. Yongqiang Liu, Dr. John J. Qu, Dr. Wanting Wang, and Dr. Xianjun Hao 
discuss calculation and analysis of fire emissions (Liu et al., 2010) in Chapter 9. 
Approaches for fire emission calculation and techniques for fuel and fire properties 
estimation are reviewed briefly. Uncertainty in fire emission estimation is analyzed. 
And future works for fire emission research are discussed. 
Foliar phenology significantly influences the exchange of mass, energy and 
momentum between the Earth’s surface and its atmosphere (Jolly, 2010). In Chapter 
10, Dr. Jolly presents a phenology monitoring system that combines satellite- 
derived vegetation indices from the advanced very high resolution radiometer 
(AVHRR) and surface weather data (Jolly, 2010). It is the first of its kind to integrate 
RS and surface weather-based models to determine green up dates and green 
factors. The system provides friendly web-based user interface that is suitable for 
use by land managers and general public. 
In Chapter 11, Dr. Bill Millinor, Dr. Hugh Devine, and Dr. Elizabeth Eastman 
present the development of a comprehensive database that can be used to crosswalk 
formation-level vegetation maps to NFFL fuel-model maps (Millinor, 2010). Fuel 
type and fuel load are critical to the performance of fire behavior models. Current fire 
models reply heavily on national fire fuel laboratory (NFFL) fuel-classification 
procedures. It is found that there was a one-to-one relationship between vegetation 
type and NFFL fuel models for mid-Atlantic Eastern United States forests. This 
chapter investigates the vegetation type-fuel model relationship in eight additional 
Northeastern national parks, with focus on the development of a comprehensive 
database. 
Although the primary objective of the tropical rainfall measuring mission 
(TRMM) is to improve observations and understanding of the tropical rainfall 
variability, the visible infrared scanner (VIRS) on board TRMM has the capability 
of producing continuous global fire data set over tropics and subtropics. In 
Chapter 12, Dr. Yimin Ji and Dr. Erich Stocker summarize the algorithm for 
detecting land fires with TRMM/VIRS measurements, and discuss the diurnal and 
seasonal cycles of land fires based on TRMM fire products (Ji et al., 2010). 
In Chapter 13, Dr. John Hom, Dr. Kenneth Clark, Dr. Yude Pan, Dr. Steve Van 
Tuyl, Dr. Nick Skowronski and Dr. Warren Heilman introduce an interdisciplinary 
research program to enhance fire research in New Jersey and the Eastern coastal 
plain. Research products and applications of the program are described, including 
network of observation towers, mesoscale fire weather modeling and validation, 
vegetation mapping by RS and validation, and estimation of forest productivity 
and fuel dynamics. 
Dead fuel load is one of the major factors associated with wildfire risk, but 
there is still little data available for local and regional applications. For better 
quantification of wildland fire risks, it is critically important to develop the 
capability to estimate dead fuel load and investigate uncertainties of the estimates.

In Chapter 14, Dr. Michael J. Gavazzi, Dr. Steven G. McNulty, Dr. Johnny L. 
Boggs, Dr. Sara E. Strickland, and Dr. David C. Chojnacky compare dead fuel load 
estimates across six North Carolina forest communities with different management 
objectives and assess the accuracy of NFDRS dead fuel load estimates for these 
forest types (Gavazzi et al., 2010). 
In Chapter 15, by numerical simulations of grassland fires, Dr. William E. Mell, 
Dr. Joseph J. Charney, Dr. Mary Ann Jenkins, Dr. Phil Cheney, and Dr. Jim Gould 
review and compare FIRETEC and WFDS, two physics-based fire models capable 
of predicting time dependent fire behavior and fire-atmosphere interactions in 3D 
(Mell et al., 2010). Although these two models are still in their initial stages of 
development, they have the potential to provide reliable and detailed predictions 
of the behavior and effects of fire over a much wider range of conditions than 
operational models. Case studies show that FIRETEC and WFDS can produce 
similar results qualitatively, although there are some differences. 
In WUI, since structures and vegetation are intermixed, fire behaviors are 
different from pure wildland. Dr. R.G. Rehm and Dr. D. D. Evans discuss the 
mechanisms and major features of WUI fires, and physics-based modeling of 
fires in WUI in Chapter 16 (Rehm et al., 2010). To build a complete and accurate 
model of the WUI fire, methods of fire propagation, including spread by brands, 
need to be quantified. 
The impacts of climate change, and the associated increase in wild fire frequency 
and severity will very likely increase in coming years and decades. It is important 
to investigate the impacts of climate change and fires on ecosystem health. In 
Chapter 17, Dr. Steven G. McNulty, Dr. Sara E. Strickland, and Dr. Jennifer A. 
Moore Myers assess the climate change and fire impacts on ecosystem critical 
nitrogen load (Strickland et al., 2010). Change of ecosystem parameters due to 
drought, climate change shifts in water availability, increases aire temperature, as 
well as wildfires and prescribed burns, are exmined. The combined impacts of 
climate change and fire on critical nitrogen load are discussed. 
Understanding fuel structure in a landscape and its potential influence on   
fire spread is helpful in fire and land management. In Chapter 18, Dr. Jacob J. 
LaCroix, Dr. Qinglin Li, Dr. Soung-Ryoul Ryu, Dr. Daolan Zheng, and Dr. Jiquan 
Chen investigate the impacts of fuels in AEI (LaCroix et al., 2010). Through 
simulating fire spread with landscape level edge fuel scenarios using the FARSITE 
model, it is found that separating AEI from other landscape elements clearly 
produced different projections of fire spread, fuel loading around edges plays 
significant role in determining the rate of fire spread and the total size of burns in 
the landscape. The results suggest that fuel management around edge sould be 
considered seriously. 
Because of the interdependent nature of the variables on which sustainable 
forestry depends, sustainable forest management requires knowledges from multiple 
disciplines. In Chapter 19, Dr. Christine M. Stalling discusses integrating social 
and biophysical processes using SIMulating patterns and processes at Landscape

scales (SIMPPLLE), which is a management tool developed to help land managers 
integrate the best available knowledge of vegetation change caused by disturbances, 
including fire, insects and disease, fire suppression, and fuel treatment. Criteria and 
indicators from the Montreal process, combined with modeling techniques and 
cooperative efforts will provide the capability to help land managers in protecting 
and maintaining sustainable forests. 
Satellite RS has become the primary technique for wildland fire detection and 
monitoring. Although there exist automatic algorithms for various space-borne 
measurements, such as data from the geostationary operational environmental satellite 
(GOES), the AVHRR and the moderate resolution imaging spectroradiometer 
(MODIS), human element is still important for accurate fire detection and analysis. 
The NASA goddard space flight center (GSFC) has been collaborating with NOAA 
national environmental satellite, data and information service (NESDIS) to automate 
hazard mapping system by training neural networks to mimic the decision-making 
process of fire experts (Miller et al., 2010). In Chapter 20, Dr. Jerry Miller, Dr. Kirk 
Borne, Dr. Brian Thomas, Dr. Zhenping Huang, and Dr. Yuechen Chi describe these 
efforts for automated wildfire detection using artificial networks, including data 
reduction, architecture of neural network, traing and testing of the neural network, 
as well as classification and analysis. 
Wildland fire is not only a natural disaster, but also an essential process for 
maintaining ecosystem health. Prescribed burning is an important approach for 
land management. It is important to analyze fire regimes and related ecological 
changes. In Chapter 21, Dr. Gregory J. Nowacki and Dr. Robert A. Carr compare 
the past and current fire regimes in the Eastern United States using GIS and 
remote technology, illustrate the distainct difference between the past and current 
fire regimes across the Eastern United States, and investigate the ecological 
consequences (Nowacki et al., 2010). 
The prediction of fire spread behavior and burned area across landscape is very 
important in fire suppression planning. In Chapter 22, Dr. Zheng, Dr. LaCroix, Dr. 
Ryu, Dr. Chen, Dr. Hom, and Dr. Clark investigate the effects of weather, landscape 
structure and land management on fire spread (Zhang et al., 2010) by combining 
simulations with 3 models. The results demonstrate that landscape structure and 
fuel type composition can significantly affect fire spread behavior. Roads can 
remarkablely reduce burned area and thus function as fire barriers. Surface 
temperature and moisture conditions are the weather factors having most significant 
impacts on fire spread. 
In the last chapter, Chapter 23, Csiszar et al. introduce the fire mapping and 
monitoring theme of global observation of forest cover-global observation of 
landcover dynamics (GOFC-GOLD) program (Csiszar et al., 2010), including 
GOFC-GOLD fire goals, current implementation status, and future plans. 
Contributory activities from US Agencies are also discussed.

Abstract The frequency, severity and extent of wildland fires are largely a 
function of interactions deriving from ecosystem, atmospheric and demographic 
processes. Science explains universally applicable characteristics of wildland 
fire, but practical application of fire science requires knowledge of a diverse 
array of regionally to locally specific conditions. These include ecosystems and 
how they have evolved, land use history and land use change, demographic 
trends, fire history and current risk, and the ability of fire managers to  
bring resources and experience to emergencies in a timely manner. The 95th 
meridian divides the continental United States in terms of ecosystems, climate, 
demographics and fire regimes. Fire management and research funding 
favors the west, but over half of our forests, 70% of our people and the bulk 
of wildland urban interface (WUI) lands are in the east. Efficient application 
of fire science information for eastern fire management will benefit from 
strategies that account for climate, ecosystem, demographic and fire regime 
diversity of the eastern United States. 
Keywords Wildland fire, WUI, fire regimes, fire information, eastern 
United States 
2.1 Introduction 
Wildland fire shares universally applicable characteristics related to the classic 
triangle of fuel, weather, and ignition sources. Conversely, practical application 
of fire science knowledge in fire management practices introduces several factors 
that require a diverse array of additional considerations. Included are knowledge 
of specific ecosystems and how they have evolved, land use history and land use 
change, demographic trends, risks and values as visualized by local publics, 
frequency and severity of wildland fire in shared local memory, and the ability of fire 
managers to bring resources and experience to emergencies in a timely manner. 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires

Much of the current United States focus of wildland fire management, research 
and resource allocation is on our Western states. Frequent television coverage of 
firefighters facing vast Western blazes, in military style campaigns, has heightened 
public awareness and shaped perceptions of wildland fire. An overwhelming 
percentage of federal emergency firefighting expenditures are, year in and year 
out, justified by Western fire conditions and then allocated to fighting a very few 
large fires in the west. 
Emergence of the Wildland-urban interface (Radeloff et al., 2005) concept and 
a deeper understanding of the differing ecological roles of fire in many ecosystems 
have begun a reexamination of the costs and benefits (United States government 
accountability office, 2005) for 21st century America of fire management approaches 
that were so successfully developed during the second half of the 20th century. 
That reexamination should include a reinvigorated consideration of how best to 
meet 21st century wildland fire needs in our Eastern states. 
2.2 The Eastern United States 
The Eastern states (defined herein as those lands east of the 95th meridian) are 
different from the West in terms of ecosystems (Fig. 2.1), climate and weather, land 
use history and change, demographics and intraregional diversity. Nearly three 
quarters of the 2000 population of the United States lived in these Eastern states 
(Fig. 2.2). Housing density reflects this population distribution. The Eastern states 
ecosystems are classified as humid temperate and humid tropical, compared to 
predominantly dry in the west. This means drought in the east does not have to 
be prolonged for forest fuels to move into heightened fire danger categories.

Weather and climate which drive these ecosystem classifications are also clearly 
divided by the 95th meridian. Land use in the east resulted in the almost complete 
removal of existing forests by arriving Europeans, with much of the removal tied 
to land use change from forest to agriculture. Prior to European settlement, native 
people populated post glacial Eastern forests in increasingly settled communities 
dependent on agriculture and forest resources. Starting in the post civil war era, 
conversion of forest lands has been largely reversed in the east. 
Today the east is more heavily forested than at any time since the 19th century 
(USDA Forest Service, 2004), and many of those forests are becoming increasingly 
mature. Post glacial evolution of Eastern forests has continuously occurred in the 
presence of human use patterns, and those patterns have shown large and dramatic 
shifts over the last 300 years. Demographics in the east have shown an increasing 
trend towards urbanization (Theobald, 2005), particularly through suburban 
expansion around urban centers, which has contributed to significant increases in 
tree coverage as agricultural lands are abandoned and converted. Large areas of 
Eastern forests appear at risk from increased fire activity related to climate change 
(Bachelet et al., 2004; Breshears et al., 2005).

2.3 Eastern United States Diversity 
Generalized statements used to differentiate the east from the west tend to obscure 
an equally important consideration—the east is internally very diverse in terms of 
ecosystems, demographics, land use history, social values, and fire management 
capabilities. For example, the region experienced the worst recorded forest fire in 
North American history in terms of fatalities (Peshtigo Fire of 1871), the creation 
of our Nation’s first large forest preserve (Adirondack Forest Preserve, 1885), and 
a renowned restoration of degraded lands through forestry (Southeastern states). 
European explorers found the Eastern United States covered with rich forest 
ecosystems dominated by old growth trees from what is now the Hudson Bay to 
the Gulf of Mexico (Biodiversity Project, 2003). The Eastern forests found by 
Europeans had evolved with climate change (Delcourt and Delcourt, 1987) and 
been shaped by human use of fire (Delcourt and Delcourt, 1997). These Eastern 
forests fueled the emerging American economy from ship building to iron furnaces. 
Forest use and clearing for agriculture decimated much of the Eastern forest by 
the end of the 19th century, leading to passage of the Weeks Act of 1911 which 
established Eastern National Forests. Eastern forest acreage was reduced from 
650 million acres to 400,000 million acres by 1900, with much of the reduction 
coming in the last 50 years of the 19th century (Heinz Center, 2002). Since then, 
acreage has remained stable. The Climate Change Atlas for 80 forest tree species 
of the Eastern United States (Prasad and Iverson, 1999) is an excellent source for 
viewing the diversity of forest tree species for the Eastern states and how there 
distributions are likely to change under various climate model scenarios. 
Fire regimes are a useful approach for documenting the role of fire in particular 
ecosystems. While fire regimes have not been extensively studied for all of the 
Eastern United States, the work of Lafon, Hoss and Grissino-Mayer (2005) on fire 
regimes and climate variability in the Central Appalachian Mountains is indicative 
of how important fire is to Eastern ecosystems. They point out the importance of 
fire regime knowledge to fire management decisions and to understanding the 
ecological role of fire for any given ecosystem. Much of the area studied appears 
fire dependent, especially the oak and pine dominated stands. Suppression of fire 
has lead to species decline and increases in stand density and fuel loads. 
2.4 A Fire Information Strategy for the Eastern States 
East-west equity in funding of fire management (United States Government 
Accountability Office, 2006) and fire research is not likely to develop, either in 
view of currently justified circumstances or a major shift in national priorities. 
Scientists and managers, therefore, should coalesce around a strategy aimed at 
providing timely, cost effective, and technically appropriate fire related information

to the broad and diverse fire community of the Eastern United States. 
There are several key components to such a strategy. ķ recognize the diversity 
of Eastern fire management needs and the limited resources available to meet 
them. ĸ utilize the broadly applicable state of art fire science currently flowing 
from research funded by the joint fire science program (JFSP, 2007) and the 
national fire plan (NFP, 2007). Ĺ emphasize decision support technologies to 
knowledge engineer products designed to meet specific local user needs at   
very low cost. ĺ base the strategy on using available satellite measurements to 
continuously supply near real time fire information. Developing the mathematical 
algorithms needed to monitor rapidly changing local fuel conditions from satellite 
measurements is a technical linchpin to this strategy. 
Recognize the diversity of eastern fire management needs and the limited 
resources available to meet them. One size does not fit all for Eastern fire 
management. This paper illustrates how fire management needs, and resources, 
vary from Florida to Maine to Minnesota to east Texas. While florida’s State 
forester deals with acreage burned that exceeds those of many Western states in a 
typical fire year, New Jersey may face those fire loads on a decadal basis. While 
a nature conservancy manager needs to introduce prescribed fire on an acre by 
acre basis to restore the health of the pine bush in Western Albany, New York, 
wildlife managers will need to burn significant jack pine acreages in Michigan to 
meet Kirtland Warbler habitat goals. While the supervisor of the superior national 
forest treats the vast acres of timber blow down in the boundary waters canoe 
area with prescribed fire to avert disaster, the Supervisor of the Francis Marion 
national forest in South Carolina must balance fire hazards and red cockaded 
woodpecker habitat needs following the heavy disturbance caused by Hurricane 
Hugo. The resources available to meet these diverse and important fire management 
needs are scarce and must be carefully managed. The incident command system 
(ICS) which was invented in southern California in the 1970s and has become 
the backbone of emergency management throughout the much of the country. 
The ICS is an example of applicable fire research that can and should be tuned to 
recognize the diverse needs of Eastern fire management. 
Utilize the broadly applicable state of art fire science currently flowing from 
research funded by the joint fire science program (JFSP) and the national fire 
plan (NFP). A very significant amount of extremely useful research is flowing out 
of the JFSP and NFP. Concentrated attention should be paid by knowledgeable 
scientists and technology transfer experts to the task of identifying and applying 
state of the art fire science to Eastern fire needs. Active utilization of state of the 
art science is a cost efficient necessity for meeting diverse Eastern fire program 
needs. 
Emphasize decision support technologies to knowledge engineer products 
designed to meet specific local user needs at very low cost. Most Eastern fire 
managers can not afford the continuing overhead of technical staff dedicated to 
ongoing analysis that is possible in the west, based on preparedness for large 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires

campaign fires. While many users remain uncomfortable with disembodied machine 
based guidance, both the user and science communities need to make special efforts 
to overcome this difficulty. By using improved decision support technologies, 
including artificial intelligence, low overall program costs can be maintained while 
providing placed based information designed to meet specific user needs. 
Base the strategy on using available satellite measurements to continuously 
supply near real time fire information. The key to making this strategy successful 
is the cost effective use of available satellite measurements engineered to meet 
diverse local needs. As with many other areas of fire research, research on the 
utility of using remote sensing (RS) measurements is yielding exciting results. In 
particular, research advances aimed at using remotely sensed fuel measurements 
that can be directly used in fire danger, fire behavior, smoke management    
and other real time fire management information needs without the artifice of 
parameterized fuel models are extremely promising. Advances deriving from 
research on the utility of satellite measurement for the forest inventory and analysis 
(FIA) program (USDA Forest Service, 2007) promise significant collateral benefits 
for Eastern fire programs. FIA data bases for the east can supply the forest vegetation 
ground truth information needed to rapidly tune applications designed for fire 
program needs. 
The time is now and the technology is here to address the goal of meeting the 
diverse needs of Eastern fire management by employing state of the art fire 
science, decision support science and RS data processing technologies to available 
satellite RS measurements. Carefully tuned knowledge engineered outputs can 
and should provide useful, timely and geographically specific information to 
federal, state and local fire managers and other users in the east.

Abstract Over the last century, the United States has evolved from a 
predominantly rural to an urbanized society with an exurban area currently 
referred to as the wildland urban interface (WUI). This WUI is critical as it 
occupies three to five times as much land area as urban areas with emerging 
and latent conflicts between traditional resource management and preferences 
of new residents. The effect of development on wildland fire management 
has received the most attentions. Increasingly, one of the most effective 
tools in the manager’s kit, fuel reduction by frequent understory burning, is 
off-limits because of safety and liability risks or public dislike of smoke. 
Fire risk in the WUI is greater than in wildland because there is a higher risk 
of catastrophic wildfire. The WUI, however, cannot be defined by simple 
proximity of forest to urban areas but more realistically is conceptualized as 
a set of complex social, physical, and biotic gradients. The Southern US 
exemplifies the problems of mixing urbanized land uses with fire-affected 
natural vegetation. Remote sensing and geographic information systems, 
along with spatial information at appropriate scale, will play a critical role 
in providing managers with monitoring capability that can also be used to 
educate the public about the wildland urban interface.

3.1 Introduction 
Over the last century, the United States has evolved from a predominantly rural 
to an urbanized society (Hobbs and Stoops, 2002). Since the World War ē, 
growth of exurban areas has dominated: beyond the suburbs, not exactly rural 
and not quite urban. Today this exurban area, currently referred to as the wildland 
urban interface (WUI) is critical as it occupies three to five times as much land 
area as urban areas (Theobald, 2001; Radeloff et al., 2005). Although there are 
many emerging emergent and latent conflicts in the WUI between traditional 
resource management and preferences of new residents, the effect of development 
on wildland fire management has attracted the greatest attention from policymakers. 
As human populations expand farther into fire-affected natural landscapes, more 
people, more natural ecosystem area, and greater capital investment are at risk 
from wildfire. Fragmentation of forest land due to land use change driven by 
population growth constrains many traditional methods of forest management, 
particularly the use of prescribed burning to manage fuel loads. Prescribed fire is 
used routinely in conifer forests in the South, Lake States, and Northeast to 
reduce fuel loads and decrease the risk of catastrophic wildfires, improve forest 
health, and manage habitat for threatened and endangered species. Increasingly, 
one of the most effective tools in the manager’s kit, fuel reduction by frequent 
understory burning, is off-limits because of safety and liability risks (Achtemeier 
et al., 1998; Wade and Brenner, 1995) or public dislike of smoke (Macie and 
Hermansen, 2002). 
Demographic changes in the Eastern United States affect natural resources  
and the attitudes of the public toward traditional management practices such as 
prescribed burning (Cordell et al., 1998). The WUI, however, is not a discrete 
management unit that can be defined, more or less, by simple proximity of forest 
to urban areas. Because of heterogeneous patterns of both forest cover and human 
settlement across broad landscapes, the WUI is more realistically conceptualized 
as a set of complex social, physical, and biotic gradients (Wimberly et al., 2005). 
Our objectives in this chapter are to briefly describe the changing demographics 
of the Eastern United States (focusing on the South), characterize the growing 
WUI, and describe the implications for the land manager of the expansion of 
dense human settlements into fire-affected forests.  
3.2 Demographics 
The population of the United States grew 270% over the course of the 20th century, 
from approximately 76 million to 281 million and growth in the 1990s was the 
greatest increase in population for any decade in history (Hobbs and Stoops, 
2002). The South, defined for our purposes as the 13 states in region 8 of the US

forest service, showed a greater percentage increase, 319% (from 22 million to 
almost 92 million) over the same century (Hobbs and Stoops, 2002; Cordell and 
Macie, 2002). These growth rates are the combined effect of lowered mortality, 
longer living, and immigration (Cordell et al., 2004). Population increase was not 
steady, however, and the post World War ē “baby boom” shows clearly when 
increases are viewed at decadal intervals (Fig. 3.1). Applying the rate of increase 
for the decade from 1990  2000 (13.1%) to future growth, the United States 
population is predicted by the bureau of census to double in size in the next 100 
years, to 570 million (Cordell et al., 2004).

and the 13 Southern states in region 8 of the US forest service. Population totals for 
the United States exclude Alaska and Hawaii through 1950. Source: US census, 
decennial census of population, 1900  2000 presented in Appendix A Table 1 of 
Hobbs and Stoops (2002) 
More than 70% of the current population lives east of the 100th Meridian, i.e. in 
the East. Increasingly, the US population lives within a metropolitan area. In 1910, 
only 28% lived in a metropolitan area but by 2000, the US population was 80% 
metropolitan (Hobbs and Stoops, 2002). The growth of metropolitan population 
in the South has increased, especially since World War ē, and now approaches 
the national average (Fig. 3.2). Since World War ē, growth has been concentrated 
outside of the central cities; half the US population now lives in suburban areas 
(Hobbs and Stoops, 2002). In the South, 20.8% of the increase between 1990 and 
1999 has been in metropolitan areas outside of the central cities (Mackun and 
Wilson, 2000). 
Increased population levels do not tell the whole story, however. Given a fixed 
area of land, increasing population means higher population density. The US

13 Southern states in region 8 of the US forest service, 1910  2000, shown as the 
percentage of the total population that lived in metropolitan areas at each decennial 
census. Population totals for the United States exclude Alaska and Hawaii through 
1950. Source: US Census, decennial census of population, 1900  2000 presented

tripled in density, from 10 people per km2 at the beginning of the 20th century to 31 
people per km2 at the beginning of the 21st century. The US remains relatively less 
densely populated, however, in comparison with most countries and is lower than 
the average world population density of 46 people per km2 (Hobbs and Stoops, 
2002). The average population density in the South exceeds the national average, 
and has increased more rapidly than the national rate since World War ē(Fig. 3.3). 
Despite the danger of extending past trends into the future, we see no reason to 
expect that population levels will decline in the United States, or even that the 
rate of growth will decline (Nowak et al., 2005). Another trend besides the growth 
of population that is likely to continue is the increase in per capita footprint. 
Since the 1960s, conversion from rural to urban land use has exceeded the rate of 
population growth (Hirschorn, 2000), with a preference for non-urban settings 
(Sullivan, 1994). This trend is due to the combined effects in exurban versus urban 
areas of lower housing density, larger average lot size, and the expansion of 
supporting infrastructure such as roads, schools, and commercial area (Cordell et 
al., 2004). In the decade and a half from 1982  1997, developed area in the US 
increased 34%, with the largest regional increase in the South (Alig et al., 2004). 
Thus demographics can be visualized through the effect of human population 
growth on land use, both in terms if the present distribution of people on the 
landscape in urban, exurban, and rural areas and the likely changes in land use 
patterns over the next century.

3.3 The Wildland Urban Interface  
The traditional concept of the WUI is that of an area of urban sprawl where new 
housing developments abut large areas of public or private wildland. Recreation 
managers view this interface in terms of adjacency of people seeking recreational 
opportunities and access to backcountry. Fire managers view the interface in 
terms of adjacency of flammable wildland fuels and structures (Long et al., 2005). 
The federal government defined the interface as “…the area where houses meet 
or mingle with undeveloped wildland vegetation” and described three types of 
interface communities: ķ the “interface community” where structures about 
wildland fuels, ĸ the “intermix community” where structures are dispersed within a 
wildland matrix, and Ĺ the “occluded community” where wildland fuels are patches 
within a matrix of structures, for example a park (USDA and USDI, 2001).  
Attempts to map the interface and intermix conditions based on this definition 
use the threshold set in the Federal register of one house per 40 acres (Radeloff et 
al., 2005). Further assumptions must be made about the nature of the wildland 
vegetation. The WUI map for 2000 produced by Radeloff and colleagues (2005) 
used a 50% threshold for wildland vegetation: greater than 50% for the interface 
community, less than 50% wildland vegetation but within 1 mile of wildland 
vegetation for the intermix community type. They estimated that 10% of the area

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
24 
and 33% of the housing units in the conterminous 48 states are in the WUI. As 
they point out, this approach does not directly map fire risk because wildland 
vegetation communities vary considerably in their fuel types, fire frequency, and 
fire regimes. Flammability of construction materials and accessibility to firefighting 
equipment also must be considered in evaluating fire risk (Cohen, 2000); spatially 
explicit data on these factors are lacking, except for small areas (e.g., Haight et 
al., 2004).  
Developing fire risk assessments for the WUI is a daunting challenge; most of 
the needed data are lacking over large areas and such data as exist, primarily from 
the decennial US Census, provide an incomplete picture. For example, the size of 
a census block varies with population level, so that rural blocks tend to be of large 
areas, which limits the spatial precision with which housing units can be mapped 
(Wimberly et al, 2005). Further, census data do not map associated infrastructure 
such as schools, hospitals, or industrial sites. Using census housing data to map the 
WUI is further limited by the omission of second-home, recreational housing; only 
primary abodes are listed in the census data. Spatial information on the pattern of 
roads is useful in mapping the WUI, and in combination with census data can 
overcome some of these limitations. Roads tend to be correlated with housing in 
rural areas; individual buildings are more likely to be located close to roads, and 
roads themselves have an impact on probability of ignition (Forman, 2002). 
Attempts to map the WUI to date have produced static snapshots of land use 
and population density. Other predictors of fire risk related to the socioeconomic 
environment are even harder to map, such as labor markets, law enforcement, 
and socioeconomic conditions (Prestemon et al, 2002; Mercer and Prestemon, 
2005; Butry and Prestemon, 2005). Because it is impractical for managers to redo 
a WUI map for each fire season, a dynamic view of the WUI is needed, one that 
identifies where change is most likely to occur (e.g., growth clusters—Hammer  
et al., 2004). We propose a new typology that defines the WUI along two axes: 
from wildland to urban land use and private to public land ownership. At one 
extreme is dispersed urban development within a wildland matrix, typified by 
second home or summer recreation development, the interface zone. Often these 
are private in-holdings within large areas of public ownership. The Wildland Island 
at the other extreme is a park or forest stand within an urban area. These remnant 
natural areas frequently are rich in plant species; the pine rocklands in South 
Florida exemplify this form of the WUI (O’Brien, 1998; Snyder et al., 1990).  
Between these extremes is the intermix zone of areas undergoing a transition 
from natural resource uses such as forestry or agriculture to urban uses. We 
distinguish two types based on the sharpness of the boundary between wildland 
and urban land uses: the diffuse boundary and defined boundary intermix zones. 
In both types, developed parcels are small relative to forested land. The diffuse 
boundary intermix zone occurs where private ownership predominates and parcel 
sizes are relatively small. Typical leapfrog urban development creates zones of 
development well beyond the edge of urban development, with land between

25
remaining undeveloped. The undeveloped land may remain in active forest 
management for a time, unless the patch size is too small to be economical or rising 
land values push landowners toward development (Wear and Newman, 2004). 
Another type of intermix occurs where large areas are in public or single private 
ownership (such as forest industry land); in this case the mixture of forest land 
with individual private development produces a well-defined boundary between 
urban and wildland land uses. These two types of intermix zone differ in their 
dynamism; the diffuse boundary intermix may be unstable over time as individually 
owned parcels are developed and infrastructure is added. The distinct boundary 
intermix may remain stable as long as the large publicly or privately owned 
forestland stays in resource use. The developed side of the boundary likely will 
be fully developed, however. 
We have observed several spatial growth patterns in the WUI. Around small 
towns and areas of slower growth, a typical pattern is accretion; land at the edge 
of town is developed, particularly along major roads. Accretion generally develops 
a defined boundary with wildland. In larger towns undergoing more rapid 
development, a typical pattern is leapfrog and fill-in; development occurs beyond 
the outskirts of older development, leaving a sizeable area of undeveloped land 
between, resulting in a diffuse boundary. Over time, the gap is closed. Analysis 
of county-level census data illustrates this phenomenon: counties mapped as 
40%  60% urban in the 1990 census saw the greatest increase in urban area in 
2000 (Nowak and Walton, 2005). In the southeastern U. S., 35% of the census 
blocks that converted from rural to WUI between 1990 and 2000 were not adjacent 
to existing WUI blocks, indicating a leapfrog pattern of development (Zhang and 
Wimberly, 2007). Another common development pattern seen especially in rapidly 
developing areas of the South such as Florida and along the Atlantic and Gulf 
coasts is concentrated development. This is called variously a planned unit 
development, or a gated or golf course community. Sometimes these developments 
result from large blocks of forest owned by industry being converted to up-scale real 
estate development. Vacation home development can occur within the intermix zone 
on large lots, or be truly dispersed in private forest areas (Stein et al., 2005). 
Each type of WUI is dynamic and local factors of economics, access, and 
proximity to naturalness and scenery largely determine the rate of conversion from 
wildland to developed land within the national context of capital availability. The 
types of vegetation communities, stand structures, fuel types and loads vary as 
well by physiographic province, from the coast to the mountains. There is no 
single parameter, or simple set of parameters, that adequately describe the WUI 
environment. As noted by Wear and Bolstad (1998), “…coarse-scale measures of 
the human drivers of landscape change (for example, population growth measured 
at the county level) appear to be poor predictors of changes realized at finer scales.” 
The characteristics and significance of the WUI for fire managers at a given 
location may vary depending upon the spatial scale of the effects considered. 
Whereas forest patch sizes and interspersion with housing can be assessed at the

local level, the potential influences of escaped fires and smoke dispersion must 
be analyzed over much larger areas. Additionally, fire managers need to be aware 
of the likelihood of land use changes in intermix areas. 
In many ways, the entire South is a WUI. Much of the South was once cleared, 
farmed, or grazed. Past land use has left many legacies, including an extensive road 
system (Fig. 3.4). Population growth since the middle of the last century has caused 
increasing urbanization and fragmentation of the forested landscape (Wear, 2002),

increasing the size and importance of the WUI. More people now live at the 
interface and the transportation system is expanding, becoming denser and more 
pervasive (Riitters and Wickham, 2003). The density of public roads in the US is 
0.65 km/km2 (0.79 km/km2 for the contiguous US excluding Alaska and Hawaii) 
and the average for the southern states is 0.98 km/km2 (US DOT, 2004). The road 
density in Georgia is 1.22 km/km2, higher than the national average; the density 
in Montana is lower than the national average at 0.29 km/km2. Continuing growth 
in the South is projected to occur along the Atlantic and Gulf coasts and the 
Piedmont Crescent, mostly from the conversion of forest to urban land use (Wear, 
2002). Besides the physical aspects of the WUI, changing demographic profiles 
and cultural values (Cordell et al., 1998) have altered attitudes towards natural 
resource management in general (Bliss et al., 1997; Jacobson et al., 2001; Hull and 
Stewart, 2002) and prescribed burning in particular (Loomis et al., 2001; Duryea 
and Hermansen, 2002). In general, Southerners share the same attitudes about the 
environment as the general population and even small forest landowners are averse 
to even-aged management practices such as clearcutting and use of herbicides to 
control competing vegetation (Bliss et al., 1997). 
Land ownership in the South and East differs from the West; Eastern forests 
are predominantly in private ownership, approaching 80% or more in most states. 
Forest land ownership differences lead to distinctive land cover patterns (e.g., 
Turner et al., 1996). A distinctive feature of southern forests is the relatively large 
industrial ownership, especially coastal plain pine plantations. Forest industry has 
for many years developed or sold parcels with high amenity values, such as coastal 
islands and lakeshores, and increasingly a significant proportion of new housing 
starts are vacation homes on wildland/high contrast edges such as abutting national 
forest or national park land (Theobald, 2004). The 1990s saw a new phenomenon in 
the wholesale divestiture of industry land to financial and real estate organizations, 
the Timber Investment Management Organization (TIMO) and Real Estate 
Investment Trust (REIT) (Ravenel et al., 2002; Stanturf et al., 2003). Although 
purchased and managed in the short-term for their timber value (Caulfield, 1998; 
Yin et al., 1998), the long-term fate of this land base is uncertain (Clutter et al., 
2005); the question is whether the land will be reforested once the standing value 
is harvested, or sold for urban development. Again, local and national economics will 
influence such decisions (Wear and Newman, 2004). Large contiguous blocks of 
industrial ownership are not limited to the South, and there is concern throughout 
the Eastern US for the uncertainty of future uses of forest industry land (e.g., 
Hagan et al., 2005).  
3.3.1 Georgia Case Study 
To further explore the characteristics of the WUI in the southeastern US, we carried 
out a GIS modeling exercise for the state of Georgia, in which digital maps of

forest cover, housing density, and road density were combined to map the spatial 
pattern of the WUI. A vector dataset containing housing density from the 2000 
census, mapped at the census block level, was obtained from the SILVIS website 
(Radeloff et al., 2005). The road layer was derived from 1:100,000 digital line 
graphs (DLGs) originally produced by the USGS. A 18-class land cover map of 
Georgia, developed by the Institute of Ecology for the Georgia Gap Analysis 
Project and the Georgia Land Use Trends program, was used to map forest cover 
(Kramer et al., 2003). This 30 m raster dataset characterized land cover in 1998 
and was developed by classifying Landsat TM images from 2 dates representing 
leaf-on and leaf-off conditions. For this study, cells mapped as deciduous forest, 
conifer forest, mixed forest, and forested wetlands were reclassified with a value of 
1 (forested), and all other pixels were reclassified with a value of 0 (non-forested). 
Our WUI map for Georgia was developed using the methodology of Zhang (2004). 
These data sets were transformed spatially using a moving-window analysis. The 
housing density map was converted to a raster dataset with a 30 m cell size to match 
the land cover dataset. A new housing density value was then assigned to each cell, 
based on the average housing density within a 2.4 km2 radius circular neighborhood 
(Fig. 3.5(a)). This radius was chosen to match the buffer zone for WUI identification 
that had been used in previous mapping efforts (Radeloff et al., 2005). Road 
density, computed as km of road per km2, was also summarized within a 2.4 km2 
circular neighborhood with the output stored in a 30 m raster dataset (Fig. 3.5(b)). 
Forest cover for each cell was similarly computed as the proportion of forested 
cells within the surrounding 2.4 km2 circular neighborhood (Fig. 3.5(c)). 
Each spatial variable was converted into an index between 0 and 1 using a scaling 
function. These functions were based on the assumption that areas with a high 
WUI index (WUII) value should contain both high levels of wildland vegetation 
(predominantly forests in Georgia), and also have high levels of human habitation 
and utilization. Thus, both the forest index (FI) and the road index (RI) increased 
linearly with increasing densities. The housing index (HI) increased logarithmically 
with housing density, based on the assumption that differences in the index at 
lower housing densities are more important for defining the WUI than differences 
at higher housing densities. 
These input layers were combined using an enhanced version of the favorability 
function (O'Sullivan and Unwin, 2003). The final WUI index was computed for 
each 30 m cell as: 
 
0.5
0.25
0.25
I
WUI
FI
HI
RI



(3.1) 
This function was a weighted geometric mean of the three indices defined 
previously, with equal weighting assigned to wildland characteristics (the forest 
index) and to the combined urban characteristics (the housing and road indices). 
The value of the WUI index was zero whenever one or more of the component 
indices was zero, and equaled one only when all three of the component indices 
were equal to one. Thus, the resulting WUI index was lowest at the extremes of

Almost all the areas in Georgia that had high forest cover also had a high WUI 
index, reflecting the ubiquity of diffuse, low-density development on private lands 
and extensive road systems (Fig. 3.5(d)). The major exception was the Okefenokee 
national wildlife refuge, located in the southeastern corner of the state. Another 
large concentration of the public land in Georgia is in the Chattahoochee national 
forest, located in the southern Appalachians of Northeast Georgia. However, much 
of this land was heavily roaded and interspersed with private property, resulting 
in high WUI indices associated with defined intermix patterns in this portion of

the state. The Piedmont region northeast of Atlanta had comparatively low forest 
cover, but also had high WUI indices because of high housing and road densities. 
Another large concentration of high WUI indices was found along the Atlantic 
Coast, resulting from the defined intermix patterns of large areas of industrial 
timberland juxtaposed with scattered population centers and extensive roads. 
WUI indices were much lower in other portions of South Georgia, particularly in 
southwest Georgia where agriculture remains the dominant land use. 
In additional to these statewide trends, the WUI index also exhibited finer- 
grained local variability. In South Georgia, linear patterns reflected the association 
between forested wetlands and bottomland habitats. Circular patterns around 
numerous small cities reflected the accretion pattern of development, which 
created rings of high WUI index values where increasing forest cover intersected 
suburban housing densities on the urban fringes. Local variability in the relative 
dominance of forest and agricultural land cover also influenced WUI index 
patterns across much of Central and South Georgia. 
Although road and housing densities were generally correlated, there were 
several areas where the WUI index was sensitive to our specification of the road 
index. West of the Okefenokee, housing densities are extremely low but rural road 
densities were very high. Therefore, this area was assigned high WUI indices rather 
than being identified as a wildland area. A similar phenomenon was observed at 
the Fort Stewart military base, which also had low housing densities and high 
road densities. Our decision to weight all types of roads equally in the road density 
calculations influenced these outcomes. Areas with high densities of unimproved 
roads had a similar influence on the final WUI index as areas with similar 
densities of highways. This decision can be justified on the contention that smaller 
roads provide direct human access to forested areas for camping, hunting, dumping, 
and other activities that can have a strong environmental impact. For the 
standpoint of fire risk assessment, road density may be correlated with the density 
of ignitions from human sources (Cardille et al., 2001; Zhai et al., 2003).  
This example demonstrates that the results of this type of deductive modeling 
exercise are highly sensitive to the assumptions that underlie the variable selection, 
scaling, and weighting. However, this sensitivity is advantageous in that it allows 
the WUI index to be “tuned” to specific objectives. Consider a WUI index intended 
to identify areas where human infrastructure is likely to limit the applicability of 
prescribed fire as a fuel management treatment. Potential liability for traffic 
accidents caused by smoke is a major concern in this regard. Because the potential 
for such an accident would increase with traffic volume and speed, it would make 
sense to develop a weighted road density function based on road size. 
Additional sources of spatial data can also be readily incorporated into a WUI 
model. In particular, more detailed information on historical fires, fuels and 
potential ignitions sources would help to identify forested areas where uncontrolled 
wildfire is most likely to occur. Detailed information on the locations, of hospitals, 
schools, utilities, and other infrastructure would be also useful for evaluating the

WUI from the standpoint of potential wildfire risks, as well as managing smoke 
away from these facilities during prescribed burns. Although our current model 
presents a static picture of the WUI, it could be enhanced to investigate patterns 
of development, leading to a more dynamic view of the interface. 
3.4 Implications for Managers 
Growth of the WUI has many influences on forests and their management (e.g., 
Duryea and Hermansen, 2002; Zipperer, 2002). Tourism, recreation, and amenity 
migration are prime examples of these influences. Here we will concentrate on the 
relationships with fire and smoke. The issues can be generalized into a primary 
effect on fire risk and a secondary effect on traditional forest management, which 
includes the use of prescribed burning to manage hazardous fuels. The values at 
risk are substantial: recent wildfire seasons have seen high costs for suppression 
($1.5 billion nationwide in 2002, NIFC, 2001) and damage (the 1998 wildfires  
in Florida alone cost close to $800 million in damage, Butry et al., 2001). The 
growing WUI increases both the risk of wildfire occurring and the cost of wildfire 
by placing higher values at risk than in wildland areas. 
Fire behavior is understood at its simplest as the interaction of fuels, weather, 
and an ignition source. People in the WUI can affect fire behavior by altering 
natural plant communities as well as by placing artificial fuels (i.e., structures) in 
the landscape Doolittle, 1978; Donoghue and Main, 1985; Prestemon and Butry, 
2005). Natural ignition sources are generally lightning but humans introduce arson, 
accidents, and transportation as ignition sources. Estimating actual wildfire risk 
introduces broader spatial and temporal considerations than are used for predicting 
fire behavior. For example, the devastating 1998 fire season in Florida was below 
average in number of fires, but double the average number occurred during the 
summer (Butry et al., 2001). Anomalous weather patterns associated with El 
Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) caused a build-up in fuels during the preceding 
year and there was an unusually sharp transition to the dry La Niña phase (Brenner, 
1991; Butry et al., 2001). Broad scale modeling of the 1998 Florida fires validated 
that temporal dynamics are important to effectively estimating wildfire risk 
(Prestemon et al., 2002) and including socioeconomic conditions of communities 
improves the understanding of underlying causes of wildfires (Mercer and 
Prestemon, 2005). At the rural end of the WUI, at least in Florida, there were fewer 
wildfire ignitions and lower aggregate area burned, probably because forest 
management was active and prescribed burning frequent. In more densely populated 
areas with higher property values, prescribed burning was rare and ignitions and 
the area burned were higher (Mercer and Prestemon, 2005). 
Managing hazardous fuel loads in the WUI will be critical for reducing the risk 
of catastrophic wildfires. Even though land ownership changes and land use is 
converted from forestry to housing development, the land cover often remains in

forest, albeit a less dense forest cover than if managed for timber. In the South, 
especially in the rapidly urbanizing areas along the coasts, long growing seasons 
and usually abundant moisture cause those potentially hazardous fuels re-grow 
within a few years of burning (Brose and Wade, 2002). Prescribed burning remains 
the most effective treatment of potentially hazardous fuels in southern forests 
(Haines et al., 2001) and there are many guidelines for conducting prescribed 
burns in wildland areas (Wade et al., 1989). Land managers use prescribed burning 
to treat 6 million  8 million acres of forest and agricultural land annually in the 
South. Use of prescribed burning in the WUI is still practical but calls for an even 
higher level of planning and preparedness, safe conduct, and communication to 
neighboring landowners and local officials (Miller and Wade, 2003; Wade and 
Mobley 2007).  
Even when continued forest management is feasible, there will be further 
constraints on use of prescribed burning in the WUI due to smoke. In fact, smoke 
is probably the key issue in suitability of prescribed burning as a way to manage 
fuel loads in the interface. Concerns with smoke are several: local and regional air 
quality (Achtemeier 2001 and 2003), visibility on roads (Mobley, 1989), health 
impacts especially on sensitive segments of the population with respiratory 
problems (Sorenson et al., 1999), and nuisance effects (Monroe, 2002). Problem 
smoke is not confined to the South and reduced visibility from smoke on highways 
has caused fatalities in Western states such as Oregon, as well as in the South 
(Achtemeier et al., 1998; Achtemeier, 2002). Nevertheless, smoke from prescribed 
burning is a critical issue in the South due to a combination of physical (meteorology, 
climate, topography), biological (fire-affected vegetation and hazardous fuels), 
and social (population density, road network) factors. While smoke can be a 
problem at any time during a wildland fire, the worst conditions are in valley 
bottoms and drainages during the night (Achtemeier, 2002) and smoke can combine 
with moist air masses to produce exceptionally dense “superfog” that reduces 
visibility to fractions of a meter (Achtemeier, 2003). 
Managing hazardous fuel loads across the wildland to urban gradient is a complex 
problem of many facets without obvious solution. The location within the WUI, 
time since last fire, stand density, and the quality of woody material affects the 
range of treatment options available. Not all ecosystems within the WUI are 
susceptible to ignition, except under extreme drought conditions. If fuels have 
accumulated by fire exclusion (lack of prescribed burning or suppression of 
wildfires), overly dense forest stands will have developed that require mechanical 
reduction of overstory and midstory woody stems before understory woody and 
herbaceous material can be treated. If the stand to be treated is in the wildland, 
conventional timber harvesting equipment may be used, and the operation may 
be economically feasible if there is sufficient timber value. If the operation is 
conducted in the intermix zones, mechanical reductions (i.e., thinning) may be 
feasible as a one-time treatment to bring fuel loads into balance. Forest operations 
selected for WUI applications must be appropriately matched to the terrain and

33
stand conditions, the unique constraints of operating in the WUI, the product 
specifications of any extracted materials, and the prescription requirements of the 
treatment. Conventional mechanical reduction equipment is designed to operate 
effectively on large areas so high speed and maximum cutting width are common 
design goals. Operations for the WUI, on the other hand, should be lightweight to 
minimize soil impacts and road transportation problems. Cutting width and speed 
may not be as important as minimizing thrown debris and operating in tight quarters 
near structures and the public. 
Suitability of an area for continued forest management is affected by 
exurbanization due to parcelization of the forest estate, reduction of tract size, and 
diseconomies of scale. Conventional forest operations face significantly increasing 
costs as tract size drops below 25 acres (Greene et al., 1997). This is primarily 
due to the increasing overhead of move-in costs and delay time associated with 
large capital-intensive equipment. In the diffuse boundary intermix zone where 
individual ownerships are small or in the distinct boundary zone where forest land 
is becoming parcelized into smaller ownerships, conventional economics may 
not apply (Wear and Newman, 2004). In the WUI, operations that involve a single 
machine performing multiple functions will have lower move-in costs (Wilhoit 
and Rummer, 1999). A small forwarder with a harvester head on the crane (a 
harwarder) would be a unique multi-function machine for WUI extraction needs. 
Smaller equipment where multiple machines can be moved on a single transport 
trailer may also be advantageous. Harvesting equipment mounted on all-terrain 
vehicles (ATV) can be easily transported from site to site. In dense, overstocked 
stands resulting from fire suppression, individual stems may be too small for 
conventional products and biomass thinning for energy wood may be appropriate. 
In such cases, combining a small chipper with cut-to-length harvesting systems 
may be feasible (Bolding and Lanford, 2001). Biomass material that has no 
product value may have to mulched and left in the stand to minimize costs. New 
technology to collect and bundle small material in the woods for transport to 
processing facilities and the development of bioenergy conversion technologies 
may provide additional options in the future. A complete fuel reduction treatment 
in the WUI will thus require an integrated system of several machines to achieve 
stand management goals while minimizing costs and maximizing fiber recovery 
and utilization. 
Once woody fuels have been reduced, there remains the need to establish and 
maintain a low-risk herbaceous understory and prevent development of higher- 
stature woody fuels. In the South, the need for re-treatment can be as frequent as 
every 2  5 years in some fuel types (e.g., coastal flatwoods; Brose and Wade, 
2002). Alternatives to use of fire to manage understory fuel loads over large areas 
are few, due to higher cost of mechanical and chemical alternatives and the 
required frequency of application. In localized areas protecting high-value structures 
or resources, alternatives to prescribed burning may involve mechanical reduction 
such as mowing or bush-hogging (Windell and Bradshaw, 2000; Rummer et al., 
www.ebook3000.com

2002) of current fuel loads and maintenance of low-risk understory through repeated 
mechanical treatments or herbicides, although such options may not be acceptable 
to some landowners (Loomis et al., 2000). At the urban end of the WUI gradient 
and throughout the WUI where individual home sites abut wildland, application 
of defensible space concepts and use of fire-resistant building and landscaping 
materials are critical to minimizing losses due to wildfires (Monroe, 2002; Long 
et al., 2005). In some states, local regulations are beginning to reflect these needs 
(Haines et al., 2005).  
3.5 Conclusion 
The rapid expansion of the US population since World War ē into formerly rural 
areas has caused significant shifts in land use and land cover that present the natural 
resource manager not only with constraints on traditional land management but 
also a new class of resource and people management problems in the interface 
zone where urban and wildland uses must co-exist. This rapidly expanding and 
changing WUI is more than a boundary or discrete class of land use, and can best 
be understood as a set of complex social, physical, and biologic gradients. Where 
the WUI mixes people with fire-affected forest vegetation, particular problems 
arise. Fire risk problems in the WUI are greater than in wildland because there is 
a higher risk of catastrophic wildfire; ignitions by humans increase and fuel loads 
generally are greater because of lack of on-going management. By placing higher 
values at risk (i.e., structures built within fire-affected forests), the potential costs 
of wildfires are greater. The cost of wildfires goes well beyond damage to structures, 
as scenic viewscapes can remain damaged for years and affect tourism-based 
economies (Butry et al., 2001).  
The Southern US exemplifies the problems of mixing urbanized land uses with 
fire-affected natural vegetation. Because of an extensive road system, the entire 
South must be regarded as a WUI, at least in terms of managing smoke from 
prescribed burning. Even highly urbanized areas such as Atlanta, Georgia have 
been affected by smoke from wildfires and prescribed burning. Urbanization 
constrains traditional forest management and use of prescribed burning even at 
the wildland end of the WUI gradient because of concerns for liability from 
escaped fire, transportation safety, and regional air quality. Moving toward the 
urban end of the gradient, these concerns greatly increase and pose the dilemma 
of the lack of fuel management increasing the risk of occurrence and severity of 
inevitable wildfire. 
Managers need additional tools to define the current WUI and affordable methods 
for monitoring land use change and updating the WUI. Such tools will provide 
managers with improved ability to estimate wildfire risk at a scale that permits 
them to plan appropriately to attack wildfire when it occurs to minimize property 
losses and insure firefighter safety. Individuals living in the WUI need to be

educated as to their risk and their responsibility for reducing that risk. Remote 
sensing (RS) and geographic information systems, along with spatial information 
at appropriate scale, will play a critical role in providing managers with monitoring 
capability that can also be used to educate the public about the WUI: nothing 
says it like a map.

Abstract Among the many products and services NOAA provides include 
those oriented towards supporting prediction of fire danger and spread, climate 
prediction with a focus on drought, and air quality predictions with regard to 
ozone and smoke. The National Weather Service (NWS) Fire Weather program 
supports two main areas of concern, fire suppression and resource management, 
with NWS Fire Weather Planning Forecasts, NWS Fire Weather Watch and 
Red Flag Warning program, site specific spot forecasting, and onsite support 
services by specially trained incident meteorologists (IMETs). The NWS 
recently began the implementation of the national digital forecast database 
(NDFD) that features an interactive map. NWS Climate Services are leading 
the development of the management structure for the national integrated 
drought information system (NIDIS) Implementation Team to lead improved 
monitoring and prediction of drought. The NWS Climate Prediction Center 
took an active role in the implementation of the new climate forecast system 
(CFS), a coupled model which represents the interaction between the Earth’s 
atmosphere and oceans. NOAA and the Environmental Protection Agency 
(EPA) have developed a national air quality forecasting capability to improve 
the basis for EPA’s air quality alerts and to provide a broad spectrum of air 
quality information, including with respect to smoke. NOAA’s products and 
services to support predictions for Fire Weather, Air Quality and Climate all 
share the common thread of evolving towards a higher degree of specificity 
and accessibility.

Among the many products and services National Oceanic and Atmospheric 
Administration (NOAA) provides include those oriented towards supporting 
prediction of fire danger and spread, climate prediction with a focus on drought, 
and air quality predictions with regard to ozone and smoke. In particular, the fire- 
based products used heavily by Incident Commanders at fire scenes to direct daily 
fire fighting operations, as well as fire managers to support planning and placement 
of fire fighting resources. 
 
Figure 4.1 An engine crew scouts a dangerously active crown fire 
NOAA’s drought and air quality products also support fire planning and mitigation 
in advance of and in the wake of fires, respectively. This chapter provides an 
overview of these products and services, including an overview of NOAA’s new 
digital databases which make these products and services increasingly available 
to a wide spectrum of users. 
4.1 NWS Fire Weather 
The vision of NOAA’s national weather service’s (NWS) fire weather program is 
to provide timely data and forecasts to support wildland firefighters in minimizing 
fire fatalities, injuries, and loss of property; and to reduce fire suppression and land 
management costs by providing more timely and accurate weather information. 
The role served by the NWS is of critical importance to fire managers, who rely 
heavily on the most timely fire weather planning and forecast information. The 
NWS uses the latest available technology to continuously advance fire weather 
forecasting systems and services.

4.2 Products and Services 
There are two main areas of concern for NWS customers; these include suppression 
and resource management. NWS fire weather planning forecasts provide site- 
specific, detailed information critical to the suppression of a wildfire or a federal 
prescribed burn. These vital forecast elements include temperature, humidity, wind 
speed and direction, and dispersion. NWS forecasters focus on weather events 
such as dry thunderstorms, erratic wind conditions, dangerous lightning, and dry 
cold fronts which endanger the firefighters and crews on the line. The planning 
forecast provides 147,000 elements per day. This takes into consideration the 100 
forecast offices which each cover 15 zones, twice daily, for a seven-day forecast 
with seven elements included in each.  
For resource management, the NWS takes an active role in forecasting conditions 
for prescribed burns. Prescribed burning is defined as “fire applied in a knowledgeable 
manner to forest fuels on a specific land area under selected weather conditions 
to accomplish pre-determined, well-defined management objectives.” Prescribed 
burns are a safe and cost-effective way to reduce fuels that could lead to destructive, 
unplanned fires during the next fire season. Prescribed burning is also essential to 
the maintenance of many healthy ecosystems by creating the necessary changes for 
habitat manipulation.

The NWS fire weather watch and red flag warning program is the nationally 
recognized federal warning system used to alert wildland firefighters when 
conditions are favorable for fire weather activity. This program is essential to the 
safety of fire management crews. A fire weather watch is issued when red flag 
conditions are expected within the next 72 hours. A watch is upgraded to a red 
flag warning if the red flag criterion is expected to occur within the next 24 hours. 
By definition, a red flag event includes weather conditions which could sustain 
extensive wildfire activity, including sustained surface winds or high gusts, unusually 
hot and dry conditions or dry thunderstorm activity during a dry period. The NWS 
issues over 8,000 red flag warnings and fire weather watches throughout the course

fire weather

of a year. These warnings and watches are issued with an 85% rate of accuracy 
and a false alarm rate of only 22%. The NWS averages a lead-time of 7.8 hours 
for these warnings. 
Site specific spot forecasting is another service provided by the NWS to support 
fire weather management for wildfires and prescribed burns. Spot forecasts are 
defined as non-routine forecasts that include skycover/weather, maximum/minimum 
temperature, maximum/minimum relative humidity, 20-foot winds, wind shifts/gusts 
and instability. Optional elements provided in a spot forecast include Haines 
index, transport wind, missing depth, lightning activity level (LAL) and chance 
of wetting rain. The NWS policy states that any public safety official is permitted 
to request a spot forecast for non-wildfires if it is deemed a threat to life and or 
property. The NWS issues over 15,000 fire weather spot forecasts, annually.  
The storm prediction center (SPC) produces operational guidance products for 
fire weather each day. The products are designed to provide forecasting guidance 
to each weather forecast office (WFO) on the possibility of significant fire weather 
activity. SPC assesses dry lightning, low relative humidity, and significant wind 
potential. Areas are then highlighted to emphasize where these dangerous fire 
weather elements will occur. SPC plans on extending this product to highlight 
significant fire weather areas up to 8 days in advance. 
The NWS also provides onsite support services for wildfires, Federal Prescribed 
Burns, and hazardous material (HAZMAT) incidents. The NWS currently employs 
65 specially trained incident meteorologists (IMETs), who are professionally 
qualified in fire weather forecasting and onsite assistance. Each IMET receives at 
least three years of forecaster training and over 225 hours of fire weather classroom 
and on-the-job training, prior to becoming certified. In addition, IMETs are required 
to complete over 25 hours of fire weather refresher training annually, throughout 
the course of their careers and are sent to remote locations across the country to 
support hundreds of wildfire incidents every year. NOAA plans to continue 
expansion of IMET capabilities to new cities, and to train its forecasters on how 
to effectively respond to a wide variety of Incident Support needs from all of its 
WFOs. This may include supporting response to toxic spills, chemical releases, 
or other events of national significance such as large public gatherings. Also, 
IMETs will continue to support emergency managers at local emergency operations 
centers by utilizing their specialized equipment and expertise. 
IMETs use a collection of specialized equipment when issuing on-site fire 
weather forecasts. The atmospheric theodolite meteorology unit (ATMU) consists 
of a theodolite, which is used in tracking weather balloons to calculate wind aloft, 
and various other instruments including a thermometer, anemometer, tools to 
measure humidity, and a first aid kit. This device gives IMETs the capability to 
efficiently operate at remote locations while providing close meteorological support 
to the fire management team. The all-hazards meteorological response system 
(AMRS) is another tool used by IMETs for data assimilation. The AMRS is 
comprised of high-tech computer software and satellite communications which

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
46 
make it possible for the IMETs to access accurate and timely weather data while 
in the field. IMETs also utilize laptop computers with FX-NET software, developed 
by NOAA’s forecast systems laboratory (FSL) in Boulder, CO. This software 
provides IMETs with the capability to process weather observations and forecast 
data using an interface which is identical to their home office.

and other hazardous, life-threatening incidents

47
While the IMET concept has generally been intended to support wildland fires, 
IMETs are also used to support non-fire events which require weather support. 
For example, IMETs were deployed to assist in the Challenger Space Shuttle 
Recovery Mission, and also to assist with Hurricane Katrina when weather data were 
unavailable. The expanded use of IMETs is anticipated in support of non-fire 
events and Homeland Security needs. 
NOAA operates two geostationary operational environmental satellites (GOES), 
one centered over the equator and 75e west and the other positioned at the equator 
and 135e west, providing images of atmospheric moisture and thermal structure 
over the continental U.S. at least every fifteen minutes. Each GOES satellite has 
a 3.9 m infrared channel that can be used to detect forest fires. They also have 
high-resolution visible channels that can detect smoke from fires.

The red areas indicate the location of fires detected on the 3.9 m of infrared imagery 
4.3 Making Optimal Use of NWS Technology 
4.3.1 Digital Services 
The NWS recently began implementation of the national digital forecast database 
(NDFD) to track and display forecast elements. The database features an interactive

map, which allows the user to “point and click” on a specific location and display 
forecast information for virtually any point across the entire United States. The 
database, which currently operates at a 5 km resolution, features two different 
types of forecasts. The forecast for the upcoming 1  3 days is updated every 3 hours 
and the forecast for days 4  7 is updated every 6 hours.  
 
Figure 4.8 An example national mosaic of relative humidity for the continental 
U.S. generated from the NDFD 
The forecaster on duty at each of the local WFOs is responsible for making 
updates to their segment of the digital database. In order to make the most 
accurate projection, the forecaster first looks at each of the models, and determines 
which appears to be the most accurate, based on current conditions and observations 
in combination with their forecasting experience. The forecaster then “populates” 
the grids using one of the models or keeping the previous forecast and adjusting 
it. Smart tools, which were developed to ensure grid consistency, are then run to 
ensure that forecast elements are consistent. The NDFD currently features six 
operational elements that are functional in the continental United States. These 
elements are maximum and minimum temperature, probability of precipitation 
over a 12 hour period, temperature, dew point, and weather. There are a number of 
forecast elements that are currently being tested and considered to be “experimental.” 
These elements are evaluated for accuracy, timeliness, and consistency before 
they are deemed operational. The current experimental elements for CONUS are 
wave height, wind speed and direction, quantitative precipitation forecast (QPF), 
snow amount, sky cover, relative humidity and apparent temperature. More 
elements are scheduled to become operational in 2006.

NWS Climate Services are leading the development of the management structure 
for the national integrated drought information system (NIDIS) Implementation 
Team. The goal of the NIDIS Team is to create a comprehensive system to compile 
and incorporate data on the major indicators of drought including ground water 
levels, soil moisture, snow pack, stream flow, climate and forecasts. This early- 
warning system will enable users to efficiently determine appropriate mitigation 
efforts. The objective of the NIDIS Team is to lead to improved prediction, in 
addition to improved monitoring of drought.  
4.4.1 Product Improvements 
The NWS Climate Prediction Center took an active role in the implementation of 
the new climate forecast system (CFS). The CFS was developed at NOAA’s 
environmental modeling center in conjunction with NOAA’s office of oceanic and 
atmospheric research (OAR). CFS is a coupled model approach, which represents 
the interaction between the Earth’s atmosphere and oceans. The study of this data 
is critical to the accurate determination of climate on seasonal time scales. This new 
system is expected to improve the accuracy and precision of climate forecasting.

Drought monitoring is a fundamental element in the planning and preparation 
stages for droughts and the necessary mitigation efforts that often follow. The 
NWS climate prediction center (CPC) is an integral part of the team developing 
international drought products and services, including the north american drought 
monitor (NA-DM). The NA-DM is a collaborative effort among drought experts in 
the United States, Mexico and Canada, to implement a system for monitoring 
drought conditions across the continent on a continual basis. The NA-DM is 
following the path of the already incepted and greatly successful united states 
drought monitor (US-DM). Since implementation in 1999, the US-DM has proven 
to be a highly effective tool in drought assessment and reporting on a weekly basis 
throughout the U.S. The CPC also manages the hazard assessment website which 
includes information concerning potential hazards in the areas of temperature, wind, 
precipitation, and soil/wildfire conditions. The purpose of the hazards assessment 
is to provide emergency managers and the general public with advance notice of 
potential hazards related to climate, weather and water events. These assessments 
are formulated by integrating NWS forecasts with long-range seasonal predictions, 
using state-of-the-art technology and science.

(EPA) have teamed up with State and local agencies to develop a national air quality 
forecasting (AQF) system. The goal of this AQF team is to limit harmful effects 
from poor air quality by forecasting ozone, PM and other pollutant levels with 
enough advance notice and accuracy for the public to make informed decisions 
when potentially harmful conditions exist. The initial deployment of NOAA’s air 
quality forecast occurred in September of 2004 in the Northeastern United States. 
Since then, the AQF system has been expanded to include the entire U.S., east of 
the Rockies. The current system provides 1-day forecast guidance in 1-hour and 
8-hour average concentrations for ground-level ozone. Nationwide deployment 
of the AQF system is expected to take place by 2008. NOAA plans to improve 
and expand the AQF system capabilities over the next decade. For example, in 
the next five to seven years, NOAA and the EPA plan to develop and test the 
possibility of forecasting concentrations of PM size, less than 2.5 microns. Also, 
within the next ten years, NOAA plans to extend the AQF range to 48  72 hours 
and include a broader range of significant pollutants.

In conjunction with its federal, state and local government agencies, the NWS 
strives to meet its mission statement as outlined in NOAA’s 2005  2010 strategic 
plan, which is “to understand and predict changes in the Earth’s environment and 
conserve and manage coastal and marine resources to meet our Nation’s economic, 
social, and environmental needs.” The NWS and its partners continue to progress 
by utilizing the latest, state of the art technology and science to produce fire 
weather, climate, and air quality digital and graphical products. 
4.6 Summary 
NOAA’s products and services to support predictions for fire weather, Air quality 
and climate all share the common thread of evolving towards a higher degree of 
specificity and accessibility to support an increasingly sophisticated user base.

Abstract This chapter reviews relationships between wildfire fire and air 
quality management in the US. Smoke fire emissions contribute to fine 
particulate concentrations for which there is a national ambient air quality 
standard (NAAQS) and to regional haze. The status of US regulatory programs 
for NAAQS and for regional haze are briefly reviewed along with the estimated 
contribution made by fire to each of these. We suggest that fire emissions can 
be best managed using emissions management systems adapted to smoke 
management and recommend that fire management agencies formally adopt 
such tools.

5.1 Introduction 
5.1.1 Smoke Contributes to Air Pollution 
Forest, range and agricultural burning contribute to air pollution, locally, regionally, 
nationally and globally. Global emissions estimates from biomass burning are 
quite uncertain but the latest studies suggest that fires may contribute up to 
40%  50% of fine particulate and carbon in the atmosphere (Andreae and Merlet, 
2001; IPCC, 2001; Hoelzemann et al., 2004).

Locally, regionally and nationally in the United States emissions are equally 
significant. Figure 5.1 shows an estimate of the regional emissions of PM2.5 for 
the Western United States for the year 1996 taken from the work of the Western 
regional air partnership (WRAP) and a projection of how these are anticipated to 
grow by 2018. This inventory was developed considering a variety of different 
sources with a significant effort to estimate and quality control fire sources. The 
total emissions of PM2.5 are 1, 630,185 tons. Fire sources account for 760,733 or 
approximately 47% of the total emissions. (WRAP, 2003). For the same baseline 
year, fire represents approximately 9% of VOC and NOx emissions, 3% of SO2, 
and 27% of CO emissions.

Since smoke makes a significant contribution to air quality it has to be considered 
in the mix of sources that contribute to regional and local pollution. Smoke from 
forest burning is, to some extent, natural in as much as it would be present with or 
without human intervention. However, the “natural” amount of smoke is difficult 
to determine. Humans have influenced forests through management practices and 
agricultural burning cannot be considered natural in any way. One might argue 
wildfire is natural; however, wildfire burning in a forest that has had 75 years of 
fire exclusion and suppression is hardly natural. Prescribed fire for the purpose of 
restoring a “natural” fire regime is different from prescribed fire for the purpose 
of maintaining a natural fire regime. Prescribed fire as a silvacultural tool to

enhance production similarly is not natural. Thus, from the air quality perspective, 
it is no longer sufficient to fall back on the “natural” label for all smoke. Fire and 
smoke can lead to significant regional air quality impacts. Smoke emissions, 
especially the fraction of them that are not “natural” need to be planned for, 
managed, and to the extent possible, mitigated in much the same way as other  
air pollution sources (for a more in depth discussion of these factors, the reader  
is referred to the WRAP Fire Emissions Joint Forum and their discussions 
(http://www.wrapair.org/forums/fejf/index.html).  
5.2 Regulatory Considerations Relating to Smoke 
5.2.1 Regional Haze Rule 
In 1999, the US implemented a new Regional Haze Rule (see http://vista.cira  
.colostate.edu/improve/Overview/hazeRegsOverview_files/frame.htm for a thorough 
review of the provisions of the regulations). These regulations protect class Ē 
area visibility, specifically 156 federal Wilderness and National Park locations  
in the US. The regulations are based on the IMPROVE monitoring network  
(http://vista.cira.colostate.edu/improve/). 
IMPROVE measures the dominant chemical species that make up ambient 
atmospheric aerosols so that their relative contribution to visibility reduction can 
be evaluated. Aerosols both scatter and absorb light which can be quantified by 
the extinction coefficient. Specifically, the relationship between visibility and 
atmospheric aerosols is, for the purposes of the regional haze rule, defined by the 
IMPROVE equation, a relationship between measured aerosol concentrations, the 
extinction coefficient and visibility reduction (see http://vista.cira.colostate.edu/ 
improve/Tools/ReconBext/reconBext.htm). This allows the regional haze rule to 
focus on reducing the ambient concentration of atmospheric aerosols, specifically 
on their sulfate, nitrate and organic components. 
Under the regional haze rule, all states (and participating Indian tribes) are 
required to develop a “state (or tribal) implementation plan” to reduce emissions of 
the most appropriate visibility degrading aerosols. By far sulfate is the most significant 
contributor to poor visibility in the United States (http://vista.cira.colostate.edu/views/). 
However, the regulations specifically require States to identify for each class Ē 
area in their State, what is the natural background for visibility, what is the mean of 
the 20% haziest and 20% cleanest days (based on a 5 year average) and establish a 
program of emissions limitations to reduce the haziest days to natural background 
conditions (whilst not reducing the cleanest days) over the next half century, 
measuring progress in 10 year increments.  
Natural background is a complex concept but it is specifically identified in the 
www.ebook3000.com

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
58 
regulations to be: reflective of contemporary conditions and land use patterns 
(not historical, pre-European conditions); a long-term average condition analogous 
to the 5-year average best-and worst-day conditions that are tracked under the 
regional haze program, and; estimated for each class Ē area in the absence of 
human-caused impairment. For the purposes of the RHR, a document exists that 
defines the natural condition (USEPA, 2003). 
In many class Ē areas, especially in the cleanest areas of the US, the northern 
Rocky Mountains and intermountain west, organic carbon is the pollutant responsible 
for over 50% of the visibility impairment. Figure 5.2 shows IMPROVE data from 
2002 to illustrate this point. Organic carbon comes from a variety of sources, 
namely biogenic (including all forms of fire as well as secondary organic aerosol 
generated from VOC emissions from vegetation) and from fossil fuel combustion 
(oil and gas). There are research activities underway to better determine exactly 
how much of this organic carbon aerosol comes from forest and other fire smoke. 
However, since forest fire smoke is generally recognized as a significant contributor 
to regional haze and, at the same time is different from other pollution sources (e.g. 
industrial and transportation activities), the RHR calls upon States to implement 
Smoke Management Programs (SMP) as part of their S/TIPS. The WRAP has 
issued policy guidance on what constitutes a SMP (see http://www.wrapair.org/ 
forums/fejf/documents/esmptt/policy/030115_ESMP_Policy.pdf).

5.2.2 National Ambient Air Quality Standards for PM 
At present (October, 2005), the US EPA is reviewing its national ambient air quality 
standard for particulate material. This review, part of the required review process 
for NAAQS, may result in changes of both the numerical value and averaging 
methods of the standard. At present there are 120 counties that are in non-attainment 
for annual PM2.5. Figure 5.3 shows EPA data from 2000  2002. It is likely that 
any revision of the standard will be more restrictive than the current values (see 
http://www.epa.gov/ttn/naaqs/standards/pm/s_pm_index.html for more information 
about the current status of the particulate standard). At any rate, the message here is 
simply that conducting burning programs in any of the counties shown in Fig. 5.3 
is likely to be subject to added complexity and possible limitations in the future.

5.2.3 Managing Smoke from Wildfire 
As a result of advances in computing and remote sensing (RS) technologies, there 
have been significant advances over the past decade in the ability to monitor and 
to predict smoke from burning activities. There are a number of satellites and sensor 
packages allowing steadily improved temporal, spatial, and spectral monitoring

of smoke. Similarly, the cost and accessibility of computers allows simulations of 
fire events in predictive and real time modes, including all the burning in a region 
and comparison with other pollution sources to discern the relative contribution 
of the burning. 
5.3 A Review of the TASET Report—Tools Available to  
Manage Smoke 
Under funding from the joint fire sciences program in 2000, the authors completed 
a study addressing technically advanced smoke estimation tools (TASET) (Fox and 
Riebau, 2000). The study made 9 specific recommendations for research activities 
associated with both strategic and tactical planning, operations and evaluation of 
smoke management activities. It is useful to review these recommendations in light 
of recent accomplishments and the current research program in smoke management. 
Recommendation 1 was for the fire community to collaborate with universities 
and other partners to develop consortia for advancing land manager’s capability 
to simulate weather and smoke. This recommendation was taken up and funded 
within the National Fire Plan (NFP) with the result being a national network of 
fire consortia for advanced modeling of meteorology and smoke (FCAMMS.)   
At present there are consortia (http://www.fs.fed.us/fcamms) operating in East 
Lansing MI (USFS Northern Station); Athens, GA (USFS Southern Station); Ft. 
Collins, CO (and Missoula, MT. USFS Rocky Mountain Station); Seattle, WA 
(USFS Pacific Northwest Station) and Riverside, CA (and Reno, NV Pacific 
Southwest Station).  
Figure 5.4 illustrates where the FCAMMS are operating. These regions represent 
the domain of a 12 km (or higher resolution) simulation of hourly weather. The 
weather simulation represents the basis for calculation of fire weather relevant 
indices, smoke dispersion from prescribed fire operations and a host of other 
special weather related parameters.  
Recommendation 2 was to conduct a national smoke and visibility conference 
because of the potential for impacts by the RHR on fire applications. The need for 
this conference has been supplanted by the development of active fire emissions 
related activities on the part of the regional planning organizations (RPO). RPOs are 
state level organizations created by the EPA for the purpose of doing the technical 
work needed to support the RHR and associated S/TIPS. Specifically, many of 
the things we were recommending were also accomplished at the National Fire 
Emissions Technical Workshop held in May of 2004, under the auspices of the RPOs 
(see http://www.wrapair.org/forums/fejf/documents/wildland_fire/index.html). 
Recommendation 3 was to design and implement a national smoke emissions 
data structure or database system. The call for this was based on the new regulatory 
programs mentioned above for PM2.5 and regional haze, and the feeling that a 
national record keeping on fire emissions is needed. We felt that these data will

Figure 5.4 The figure shows the high resolution modeling domains of the USDA 
Forest Service FCAMMS. FCAMMS are primarily research activities located as 
shown who are engaged in weather, fire behavior and smoke research based on real 
time simulation of meteorology at spatial and time resolutions that are needed to 
advise fire management and improve research products. (http://www.fs.fed.us/fcamms) 
need to be accessible to many parties including the federal EPA, state air agencies, 
researchers, fire managers, and the interested public. Smoke emissions will also 
need to be available for use in regional scale modeling using such systems. Data 
in such a system would need to be easy to up-date, provide for documentation of 
the sources of data, provide information on the quality of data, provide explicit 
geographic reference information, and allow data to be preprocessed for use in 
modeling. This still exists as a need for this although the RPOs have taken on the 
responsibility of developing the immediate inventories needed for their modeling. 
The WRAP has also developed an emissions data management system (EDMS) 
and specifically designed a fire module for this system. (http://www.wrapair.org/ 
forums/fejf/documents/edms/041005EDMS_Fire_Module_Data.pdf)  
Recommendation 4 was to use RS to characterize fuels and fire area for the 
purpose of improving emissions inventories. There is a recognized need for fuels 
inventory at state, regional, and national scales. Such information as amount of fuel 
loading, fuel temperature, and fuel moisture would be extremely useful in calculation 
of potential for fire. For emissions calculation, accurate estimates of fire area and 
fuel consumed are also needed. Meaningful spatial resolution for this information 
would be 100 meters or less. Time resolution for this information would be at 
several days to daily resolution. New multi-spectral sensor/platform combinations 
are continuing to become available with the potential to provide significantly 
enhanced information for fire managers. RS products, preferably from space 
www.ebook3000.com

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
62 
based platforms, can solve fuels inventory and classification needs if spectral, 
spatial and temporal resolution are high enough. This information when coupled 
with burn area estimates can give regional to national emissions estimates for all 
fires. To achieve this level of information it will require new techniques for data 
collection, management, and analysis. In 2000 we said that we thought that 
technology may not exist at the present time to reach the level of spatial and 
temporal resolution we desire, we should strive to work to develop the framework 
for methodologies/processes will allow both useful products now and improved 
technology management as RS advances as a practice. The EASTFire Conference 
is one result of this sort of recommendation; this volume will advance our level 
of knowledge in RS for fire. 
Recommendations 5, 6 and 7 all related to the need for national fire smoke 
modeling products. Without going into the details here the functionality being rapidly 
developed and deployed by the BlueSkyRAINS system (http://www.blueskyrains.org) 
is exactly what we were calling for to be developed. BlueSkyRAINS is a smoke 
modeling framework allowing specific fire emissions to be input to a dispersion 
model (the EPA regulatory CALPUFF model) that is driven by high resolution 
weather predictions. The system is packaged with an interactive web-based GIS 
to allow identification of smoke sensitive areas and thus anticipate problems. 
This fire season (2005) the system is being deployed throughout the Western US 
at a spatial resolution of 12 km and with predictions for 48 hours in advance. 
BlueSkyWEST is undergoing an evaluation of its ability and utility for managers 
(see http://www.fs.fed.us/rmc/). In addition, the Southern high resolution modeling 
center (SHRMC) is deploying BlueSky for the Southern US, especially in support 
of the clean up efforts in the wake of the hurricanes that impacted the Gulf States 
in september 2005. As well other FCAMMS are all implementing versions of 
BlueSky for their own needs as determined by their user communities.  
Recommendation 8 called for the development and deployment of improved 
on-site fire emissions measurements. Although fire emissions modeling are 
improving, we need to improve our ability to accurately measure emissions at the 
fire site. Accurate measurements of emissions at fire sites will become more 
important as the regulatory programs discussed above start to ramp up. One 
extremely useful measurement would be the total amount of PM2.5 emitted during 
the course of the fire. Currently, some fire managers are attempting to measure 
particulate concentrations at fires and near fires using portable light scattering 
measurements. The limitations of these devices are well known; inability to provide 
accurate measurements at high concentrations and point rather than spatial 
measurements being two that are often cited. The Forest Service Missoula Fire 
Laboratory is investigating LIDAR technologies that can produce fire emission 
species concentrations and plume volume measurements to calculate total emissions 
from fires. Work is on-going in this important field.  
Recommendation 9 called for the development of apportionment tools to smoke 
contributions at specific locations. Development of these tools was the subject of 
a recent joint fire science program (JFSP) call of research proposals. Thus, assuming 

5 A Review of Wildland Fire and Air Quality Management 
63
the research progresses successfully, in the next few years such tools will be 
available in the literature. 
There are a wide variety of tools available for managing smoke from wildfire. 
Many of these tools, as described above, have developed over the past five years. 
They add to a rich assortment of tools that have been available from some time 
for smoke management (Riebau and Fox, 2001). 
Technically, these tools provide the needed support for smoke management. The 
tools are not perfect; they represent approximations of various sorts with varying 
degrees of accuracy. The next phase of smoke management requires the fire 
community to step forward and start to use these tools. The context for applying 
tools is the Smoke Management Program and, more generally, the implementation 
of a Smoke Management System by the wildland fire community. 
5.4 Smoke Management—Programs and Systems 
Smoke management programs are identified in the regional haze regulations as 
being required in selected States to ensure that smoke from managed fire is properly 
managed. The Western regional air partnership (WRAP) has proposed that the smoke 
management program should specifically include requirements to: ķ minimize 
fire emissions; ĸ evaluate smoke dispersion; Ĺ identify alternatives to fire; 
ĺ notify the public; Ļ monitor resulting air quality; ļ provide surveillance and 
enforcement of burning programs; Ľ evaluate the program; ľ specific burn 
authorizations, and; Ŀ coordinate regional burning. (WRAP, 2001; 2002). 
This idealized form of a smoke management program shares much in common 
with the international standard (ISO 14001) for environmental management systems 
(EMS) (Savage-Tate, 2005; http://www.iso.org/iso/en/iso9000-14000/index.html). 
ISO 14000 concerns environmental management in general. It identifies what 
an organization does to: 
(1) Minimize harmful effects on the environment caused by its activities; 
(2) Achieve continual improvement of its environmental performance.  
It is a “generic management system standard” meaning that the same standards 
can be applied:  
(1) To any organization, large or small, whatever its product; 
(2) Including if its “product” is actually a service; 
(3) In any sector of activity, and; 
(4) Whether it is a business enterprise, a public administration, or a government 
department.  
No matter what the organization’s scope of activity, if it wants to establish an 
environmental management system, then such a system has a number of essential 
features identified by the ISO standard. “management system” refers to the 
organization’s structure for managing its processes - or activities - that transform 
inputs of resources into a product or service which meet the organization’s objectives, 
www.ebook3000.com

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
64 
such as complying with regulations, meeting environmental objectives, or 
accomplishing the job in a professional manner. The components of an EMS are 
illustrated in Fig. 5.5. 
We propose that the fire community consider developing and implementing a 
formal “smoke management system (SMS)” based on the ISO 14001 standard 
and built on the generic elements outlined in Fig. 5.5. 
 
Figure 5.5 Generic environmental management plan with notations associated 
with a wildland burning application 
5.4.1 Plan 
In smoke management there are a number of planning activities that occur. These 
range from management planning at the broadest possibly level, namely the 
forest plan which might identify general fuel management targets, to specific 
accomplishment targets for a particular burning season. An important aspect of 
planning is permitting. Permitting is specifically identified in several of the existing 
state smoke management programs and takes a variety of different formats. In 
general it requires identification of a prescription for the burn, which includes 
windows of wind speed, direction, fuel moisture, humidity and other meteorological 
parameters, a location and a specific time frame for it. However, in the context of 
an SMS, this planning needs to take a step or two back and look at the Agency 
policy with regard to its broadest goals, i.e. wishing to maximize the health and 
productivity of the forest, to maintain the urban interface as a safe place for people 
to live, maintain firefighter safety, minimize negative impacts from forest burning, 

5 A Review of Wildland Fire and Air Quality Management 
65
etc. A SMS will also need to identify the environmental “aspects” of the Agency. 
These “aspects” include positive as well as negative effects of the Agency activity 
on the environment. Finally, the SMS should specify goals for the Agency, as 
specifically as possible. 
5.4.2 Do (Implement)  
This of course represents the actual conduct of the burning activity. Burning should 
be carried out in as safe and environmentally benign manner as possible. The 
implementation phase includes utilization of many of the tools we have mentioned, 
i.e. BlueSkyRAINS, to best manage the burning.  
5.4.3 Check (Evaluate) 
This involves the evaluation of the burning program. It requires post fire monitoring, 
evaluation utilizing for example satellite RS and ground based monitoring networks 
to evaluate the effectiveness of smoke management activities, to evaluate the quality 
of the smoke modeling estimates and the overall accomplishments of identified 
targets. This is phase of the current fuel management program that might be 
considerably enhanced by formal identification of requirements and activities 
through a formal SMS. 
5.4.4 Act (Improve) 
This is a critical component of the SMS, and one which traditionally is not formally 
identified and commissioned. Thus, it may be the single most important contribution 
that adopting a formal SMS can generate. This element would require formal 
management review of the fuel management activity, a formal comparison with 
identified goals and an evaluation of accomplishment, identification of inadequacies 
and developing plans for improving next year. 
5.5 Summary 
It seems appropriate for the fire and fuel management communities to start to 
think in terms of developing and establishing formal SMS at appropriate levels in 
the agencies. In the forest service, for example, this might be at a district or a forest 
level. It will require resources to be developed, to be monitored and to be evaluated. 
We feel the potential benefits of adopting such a SMS will be significant. For one,

it will place the forest manager in a definite leadership position with regard to 
smoke management issues. It will serve to communicate to the public as well as to 
State and local regulators, that the agency is responsible and professional. Further, 
it will clearly identify that the Agency is trying to do the right thing. Finally, the 
bottom line will be better burning programs, better smoke management and fewer 
negative outcomes.

Abstract A high-resolution large-eddy simulation (LES) model is employed 
to examine the fundamental structure and dynamics of buoyant plumes 
arising from heat sources representative of wildland fires. Herein we describe 
several aspects of the mean properties of the simulated plumes. Mean plume 
trajectories are apparently well described by the traditional two-thirds law for 
plume rise; however, the spatial structure of the mean plume is significantly 
different from the Gaussian distributions typically assumed in simple plume 
models. This discrepancy arises from the fact that entrainment properties of 
a buoyant plume in a cross wind are significantly different from those of a 
buoyant plume in the absence of a cross wind, a result of the interaction of 
the buoyancy-generated vorticity in the plume with the vorticity in the ambient 
wind. The depth of the crosswind shear layer at the surface also appears to play 
a role in both the horizontal and vertical spread of the plume boundaries 
downwind, and in particular the increase in horizontal spread acts to increase 
the departure from a Gaussian distribution seen in the plume cross sections.

6.1 Introduction 
Predicting the impacts on air quality due to the smoke from prescribed fires and 
wildfires represents a central problem in smoke management, particularly for many 
locations in the Eastern United States where wildfire-prone regions are often located

near populated areas. A variety of models and tools are available for the purpose 
of modeling smoke impacts from wildland fires, and in many cases these models 
are appropriate and provide valuable information. These tools typically fall into 
three categories: simple Gaussian plume models, Lagrangian puff models, and 
Eulerian grid models.  
Gaussian plume models, such as VSmoke (Lavdas, 1996) are frequently used by 
land managers during the planning phase of a prescribed burn. VSmoke assumes 
Gaussian dispersion in both the horizontal and vertical directions from a straight-line 
trajectory for each independent period of the simulation. VSmoke is designed to 
provide the best estimate of maximum concentrations of smoke at the surface, 
rather than accurate concentrations of smoke within the plume. To achieve this 
estimate, VSmoke allows the user to partition emissions between a component 
subject to plume rise, following the formulation of Briggs (1975), and a surface 
component that lacks the buoyancy to achieve significant rise. 
As computing power has increased, the use of more complex descriptions of 
plume behavior, such as Lagrangian puff models, has become more widespread. 
Lagrangian puff models operate by releasing a series of puffs that are transported 
by spatially and temporally varying weather conditions. While within-puff dispersion 
is still handled in a Gaussian manner, puffs are allowed to split when subject to high 
levels of vertical wind shear. CALPUFF (Scire et al., 2000) is a Lagrangian puff 
model that is an integral component of the BlueSky smoke modeling framework 
(Ferguson, 2003). Plume rise from area sources in CALPUFF follows the derivation 
of Weil (1988), with the exception that the Boussinesq approximation employed by 
Weil (1988) is not made. CALPUFF assumes that the plumes will have a circular 
cross section despite evidence that fire plumes are often dominated by a pair of 
counter-rotating vortices; however, this may be an acceptable approximation since 
the presence of the counter-rotating vortices does not appear to impact plume rise 
calculations (Zhang, 1993; Zhang and Ghoniem, 1993). 
Eulerian grid models are frequently used in air quality modeling for assessing 
the cumulative impact of a wide variety of emission sources at a regional scale 
and can include complex chemical transformations. Although the scale of these 
models is generally much larger than the scale of a wildland fire plume, air quality 
models such as the United States environmental protection agency (EPA) community 
multiscale air quality (CMAQ) modeling system (Byun and Ching, 1999) can 
contain subgrid-scale parameterizations for representing smaller scale features 
such as plumes from individual sources. In CMAQ this is handled by the plume- 
in-grid (PinG) formulation (Gillani and Godowitch, 1999), which behaves in the 
manner of a hybrid of the Gaussian and puff models. Transport is handled by the 
mean wind throughout the depth of the plume, similar to the use of a layer-mean 
wind in the Gaussian models. The plume itself is constructed as a succession of 
slabs perpendicular to the flow. The lateral spread of these slabs is governed by 
turbulence, wind shear and a background entrainment value, while the vertical 
spread of the plume is governed predominantly by turbulence. Each crossflow 

6 High-Resolution Numerical Models for Smoke Transport in Plumes from Wildland Fires 
69
slab is divided into a series of columns with an initially Gaussian lateral distribution 
of pollutants. After initialization, the lateral distribution of concentration is controlled 
by a series of mass balance equations, transferring concentration between columns 
through parameterized diffusion and entrainment processes. 
Although these models have been applied with general success over a wide range 
of atmospheric conditions, they are all based on simplifications to the governing 
equations, and none of them is able to represent accurately the 3D turbulent 
dynamics of the plume itself and its interaction with the ambient atmosphere. It is 
of particular interest, then, to explore the fundamental dynamics of buoyant plumes 
arising from intense heat sources (e.g., plume trajectory, lateral and vertical spread, 
entrainment) to assess the utility and accuracy of the models currently in use for 
air quality assessment, and in particular to identify situations in which these models 
may have significant errors. 
In a recent study, Cunningham et al. (2005) employed a high-resolution LES 
model to explore the dynamics of buoyant plumes arising from a heat source 
representative of wildland fires. This model was designed to resolve the majority 
of the turbulent eddies in the plume and its environment, and thus does not suffer 
from the approximations inherent to the models discussed above. The simulations 
shown by Cunningham et al. (2005) suggest that, even for simple configurations, 
plume behavior is highly complex and dominated by a variety of coherent vortex 
structures that may have a significant impact on smoke transport. In the present 
chapter, we continue and extend this investigation of the fundamental dynamics 
of buoyant plumes in a cross wind by describing the mean properties of the 
simulated plumes for different heat source intensities and different ambient wind 
conditions. 
In the following section, the details of the numerical model are described briefly. 
In Section 6.3, the basic time-averaged properties of the simulated plumes and their 
dependence on the heat source strength and the ambient wind are shown, while 
Section 6.4 presents a summary of these results and directions for future research.

scale TKE. Following Moeng and Wyngaard (1988), values for the constants in 
Eq. (6.6) and Eq. (6.7) are chosen to be Ck 0.1 and Ce 0.93. 
The heat source, Q, in Eq. (6.2) is intended to represent in an idealized manner

source is centered at point (xh, yh), which is (450 m, 600 m) from the origin. The 
total heat release rate (HRR) is given by the volume integral of Q, and is taken to 
be constant after a ramp-up period of 10 s at the beginning of each simulation.

The governing equations are solved using the dynamical core of the weather 
research and forecasting (WRF) model (Skamarock et al., 2001). The computational 
domain is a rectangular box with spatial dimensions of 1,800 m in the streamwise 
direction (x), 1,200 m in the spanwise direction (y), and 1,800 m in the vertical 
direction (z). A uniform grid spacing of 10 m is employed in all directions. The 
ambient potential temperature is taken to be uniform and equal to 300 K in all 
simulations. For additional details of the numerical solution procedure, refer to 
Cunningham et al. (2005). 
In an effort to explore the dependence of plume dynamics on the intensity of 
the heat source and on the nature of the ambient wind, several simulations have

In an effort to explore further the dynamics of buoyant plumes in a crossflow, 
in Chapter we examine the basic structure of various mean properties of simulated 
plumes. To explore these mean properties, simulations were performed for each case 
for 20,000 time steps, with statistical properties evaluated over the last 10,000 steps. 
Herein we examine the mean plume trajectories for each case, the mean structure 
of temperature and wind, and the mean TKE. 
6.3 Dynamical Properties of Simulated Plumes 
Instantaneous snapshots of potential temperature, vorticity magnitude, and vertical 
component of vorticity from the simulation Q2U5H100 are shown in Fig. 6.1, 
and illustrate the characteristic plume structure as well as the highly vortical nature 
of the flow. It is apparent from these images that even in such simple initial 
configurations, the plume is highly turbulent and dominated by coherent vortical 
structures. These structures include the counter-rotating vortex pair aligned with

the plume trajectory that may be associated with bifurcation of the plume, 
transverse shear-layer vortices on the upwind face of the plume, and vertically 
oriented wake vortices that form downwind of the heat source and that extend 
from beneath the bent over plume down to the surface. These vortical structures 
are described and discussed in more detail by Cunningham et al. (2005).

6.3.1 Mean Plume Trajectories 
Mean plume trajectories for each case are depicted by the black and green lines 
in Fig. 6.2; these plume trajectories are calculated based on the maximum potential 
temperature deviation from ambient at each location downwind of the heat source 
along the plume centerline (i.e., the x  z plane that intersects the center of the 
heat source). Also shown in Fig. 6.2 are trajectories predicted (based on heat source 
intensity and the magnitude of the ambient cross wind) by the traditional two-thirds 
law plume rise model of Briggs (1975) and its modification by Mills (1987) to 
account for finite-area sources.

Trajectories calculated via Eq. (6.11) for a given heat source and ambient wind 
speed are shown by the blue lines in Fig. 6.2. 
It is apparent that several fire diameters downstream of the heat source the mean 
plume rise seen in the simulations is well described by a power-law trajectory, 
and is in reasonably good agreement with the simple plume rise calculations. 
Nevertheless, the trajectories of the simulated plumes do exhibit some dependence 
on the depth of the shear layer in the ambient cross wind, as evidenced by the 
difference between the black and green lines. In particular, plume trajectories are 
slightly lower when the crosswind shear layer is deeper (e.g., Fig. 6.2(c)). 
6.3.2 Mean Plume Structure 
Despite the fact that the mean plume trajectories appear to be consistent with the 
well established two-thirds law for plume rise, the mean structure of the simulated 
plumes departs from the Gaussian or top-hat distribution often assumed in plume 
models. Indeed, as shown in Fig. 6.3, all of the simulated plumes exhibit a kidney- 
shaped, or even bifurcated, structure with a local minimum along the plume 
centerline resulting from the presence of the counter-rotating vortex pair.

Figure 6.3 also illustrates the fact that the depth of the cross wind shear layer 
also has a significant impact on the mean structure of the plume, as discussed by 
Cunningham et al. (2005). Specifically, the lateral spread of the plume and the 
separation of the plume branches are greater for the deeper ambient shear layer. 
This property appears to result from the enhanced entrainment of ambient cross 
wind vorticity into the plume for the deeper shear layer, but this process requires 
further study and quantification. 
Mean streamlines in the y  z plane 1000 m downstream of the heat source are 
shown in Fig. 6.4; these streamlines illustrate clearly the presence of the counter-

rotating vortex pair in the time-averaged plume, and the associated upward vertical 
motion along the plume centerline. This upward motion may be important for PM 
transport, and may result in different downwind distributions for PM of different 
sizes (e.g., fine particles with smaller terminal velocities may be kept aloft along 
the centerline longer than larger particles).

Q2U3H100 case, both in the x  z plane along the plume centerline (Figs. 6.5(a)

and (d)).

(a) subgrid TKE along centerline, (b) total TKE along centerline, (c) subgrid TKE 
at x 1,600 m, (d) total TKE at x 1,600 m 
First, it is apparent from these figures that the subgrid TKE is significantly 
smaller in magnitude than the total TKE, indicating that the energy containing 
eddies in the plume are well resolved on the grid employed in these simulations. 
Second, it is apparent that the turbulence seen in the simulations is dominated  
by the mean effect of the vortical structures seen in the instantaneous images. In 
particular, turbulence, and thus entrainment and mixing, along the centerline 
(Fig. 6.5(b)) is associated with the repeated passage of shear-layer vortices seen 
on the upwind face of the plume, whereas farther downwind the turbulence is 
dominated by the counter-rotating vortex pair (Fig. 6.5(d)). 
It is of considerable interest to examine the dynamics of the transition between 
these turbulence regimes, and specifically how the distance downwind from the 
heat source at which this transition occurs depends on the parameters of the 
simulation, such as the intensity of the heat source and the depth of the crosswind 
shear layer. Investigation of this transition is part of future research.

6.4 Summary and Conclusions 
Several simulations have been performed using a high-resolution LES model to 
examine the dynamics of buoyant plumes arising from heat sources representative 
of wildland fires. This model is capable of representing the 3D turbulent eddies 
characteristic of such plumes, and is being employed in an effort to understand the 
fundamental structure and dynamics of buoyant plumes, including the nature and 
importance of the coherent vortical structures that are common to these flows. 
In this Chapter we describe several aspects of the mean properties of the simulated 
plumes. It is apparent that the mean plume trajectories (based on potential 
temperature along the plume centerline) are well described by the traditional 
two-thirds law for plume rise; however, the spatial structure of the mean plume is 
significantly different from the Gaussian distributions typically assumed in simple 
plume models. This discrepancy arises from the fact that entrainment properties of 
a buoyant plume in a cross wind are significantly different from those of a buoyant 
plume in the absence of a cross wind, a result of the interaction of the buoyancy- 
generated vorticity in the plume with the vorticity in the ambient wind. 
While the two-thirds plume rise formulation appears to agree well with the 
simulations of buoyant plumes in a neutral atmosphere presented herein, the 
modeling results raise several questions for further investigation. The depth of 
the crosswind shear layer at the surface appears to play a role in both the horizontal 
and vertical spread of the plume boundaries with downwind distance, and in 
particular the increase in horizontal spread acts to increase the departure from a 
Gaussian distribution seen in the plume cross sections. Source strength, or fire 
intensity, as well as shear layer depth influence the vertical spread of the plume, 
with intense fires and deeper shear layers providing enhanced vertical plume spread. 
How well these plume spread results agree with those predicted by current plume 
formulations is an open area for research. 
Ongoing and future research is focused on the continued analysis of these 
simulations in an attempt to: ķ quantify further the nature of the turbulent 
entrainment in these plumes, and how the entrainment depends on the vortical 
structures seen in the simulations; and ĸ examine the nature of turbulent transport 
in the plume (e.g., of PM of a range of sizes).

Abstract Florida experiences sea breezes, lake breezes, and bay breezes 
almost every day during the year, and there are frequently complex interactions 
between many of these breezes. Given the often-rapid changes in temperature, 
humidity and wind speed that accompany these breezes, most wildfires and 
prescribed fires in Florida are affected in some way by their interaction with 
these circulations. In this paper, we explore the interaction between sea breezes 
and wildland fires from both an observational and an idealized modeling 
perspective. The progression of the sea-breeze front and its interaction with 
the smoke plume from a 26,000 acre wildfire are tracked using a variety of 
data sources including surface and upper-air observations as well as NEXRAD 
radar imagery. Idealized numerical simulations of a thermally buoyant plume 
interacting with a density current are performed in an effort to enhance   
our understanding of the dynamics of the interaction between sea breeze 
circulations and the convective column of the fire. Our observational analysis 
and idealized modeling results suggest that the arrival of a sea breeze   
front induces a temporary, but significant, increase in fire intensity. This 
intensification precedes the arrival of the sea-breeze front at the location of 
the fire, such that the fire intensity is at a maximum at the time of, and slightly 
after, the passage of the front, and decreases gradually thereafter as cooler 
and moister air behind the front arrive.

7.1 Introduction 
Weather is one of the most important factors leading to extreme wildfire behavior. 
Rapid changes in wind can quickly affect the rate and direction of fire spread, 
and may have a significant impact on fire intensity. Changes in temperature and 
humidity also may cause unexpected changes in fire behavior. Florida coastlines 
experience sea-breezes, lake breezes, and bay breezes almost every day during 
the year, and there are frequently complex interactions between many of these 
breezes. Given the often-rapid changes in temperature, humidity and wind speed 
that accompany these breezes, most wildfires in Florida are affected in some way 
by their interaction with these circulations. Nevertheless, despite the importance 
of sea-breeze circulations for fire behavior, the nature of the interaction between 
sea-breezes and wildfires remains relatively poorly understood. 
Previous studies of sea-breezes depended upon a network of observation sites 
in the area of the sea-breeze (e.g., Atkins and Wakimoto, 1997), or used numerical 
models to simulate the sea-breeze (e.g., Pielke, 1974; Sha et al., 1991; Rao et al., 
1999; Colby, 2004). Radar and satellite imagery have been shown to be useful in 
tracking the structure, evolution and timing of the movement of sea-breeze fronts 
(e.g., Atlas, 1960; Wakimoto and Atkins, 1994; Atkins et al., 1995; Atkins and 
Wakimoto, 1997), and have also been used to observe smoke plumes from fires 
(e.g., Banta et al., 1992; Rogers and Brown, 1997; Hufford et al., 1998), as well 
as from other sources of particulate emissions such as volcanoes, dust storms, 
and industrial emissions. 
In this Chapter, we explore the interaction between sea-breezes and wildfires 
in more detail from both an observational and an idealized modeling perspective. 
The progression of the sea-breeze front and its interaction with the smoke plume 
from the fire are tracked using a variety of data sources including surface 
observations from the remote automated weather station (RAWS) network, 
surface and upper-air observations from the national oceanic and atmospheric 
administration/national weather service (NOAA/NWS), and imagery from the 
Weather Surveillance Radar-1988 Doppler (WSR-88D) site in Tallahassee, Florida. 
Given that the sea-breeze may be represented by a density current, idealized 
numerical simulations of a thermally buoyant plume interacting with a density 
current are performed in an effort to enhance our understanding of the dynamics 
of the interaction between sea-breeze circulations and smoke plumes. Although 
these idealized simulations do not allow us to determine directly the impact of the 
sea-breeze on fire behavior, which would require a fully coupled atmosphere–fire 
model (e.g., Clark et al., 1996ab, 2004; Linn, 1997; Linn and Cunningham, 2005), 
they do provide insight into the interpretation of fire behavior observations, and 
allow us to make inferences as to how the fire behavior would likely change in 
response to the simulated changes in atmospheric circulations. The combination 
of observations, idealized modeling results and inferences on fire behavior lead 
www.ebook3000.com

7 Interaction between a Wildfire and the Sea-Breeze Front 
83
to the development of an initial conceptual model of how the sea-breeze impacts 
wildfire behavior. 
7.1.1 Sea-Breeze Structure and Characteristics 
Simpson (1994) provides a detailed overview of the structure and evolution of 
the sea-breeze front derived from observations as well as numerical and 
laboratory studies. It is generally observed that the development of the sea- 
breeze is dependent both upon the temperature difference between the land and the 
adjacent water surface and upon the strength of any prevailing offshore winds. 
Offshore flow can often have a dramatic effect on the depth of the sea- breeze 
circulation. The depth of the sea-breeze circulation may be less than 50 m with 
winds above this level blowing in the opposite direction. As time progresses, the 
depth of the sea breeze may reach 1,000 m or more. 
The inland penetration of the sea-breeze can vary from 30  300 km depending 
upon the location. Typical distances in Florida are about 50 km, although strong 
prevailing winds that are in the same direction as the sea-breeze can often result 
in much deeper penetration, almost to the opposite coast. Florida also has a unique 
geographic design, being surrounded by water on the east and west coast of the 
peninsula as well as along the Panhandle coastline. Sea-breezes are observed along 
all the coasts as well as along the bays, inlets and large lakes like Lake Okeechobee 
in central Florida. These lake and bay breezes interact with the coastal sea-breezes 
and result in very complicated wind patterns. Forecasting the winds associated 
with the sea-breeze passage is also made more difficult by the presence of convex 
and concave coastlines, resulting in additional convergence and divergence effects 
(Simpson et al., 1977).  
Wakimoto and Atkins (1994) and Atkins and Wakimoto (1997) showed that 
there were significant differences between the sea-breezes observed under offshore 
and onshore flow conditions. The offshore flow case exhibited stronger low-level 
convergence, larger vertical velocities, and higher radar reflectivity values at the 
sea-breeze front, also known as a radar thin line. The sea-breeze thin line and the 
kinematic sea-breeze frontal boundary are found to be co-located and easily 
identifiable on offshore flow days. Onshore flow days typically have a much weaker 
front and the radar thin line is often hard to detect. In the offshore flow case, the 
radar thin line is found to increase in intensity during the day and gradients of 
temperature and moisture are strongest on these days.  
It is generally accepted that sea-breeze circulations are dynamically similar to 
density currents (e.g., Simpson, 1994), which are predominantly horizontal flows 
driven by density differences. Atkins et al. (1995) note that in the case of an 
offshore flow sea-breeze, there was a kinematic frontal structure similar to that 
found in density currents produced in the laboratory. Wakimoto and Atkins (1994) 
calculated the speed of sea-breeze fronts and found them to be closely matched 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
84 
to the theoretical speeds of comparable density currents. Further study by Atkins 
and Wakimoto (1997) showed Froude numbers for offshore and parallel flow 
sea-breeze events, as well as for gust fronts, compared well to values calculated 
from laboratory density current experiments. This comparison was not as well 
defined on the onshore flow days where the sea-breeze was moving slower than 
would be expected using density current theory. It is not clear why this discrepancy 
exists for onshore flow sea-breezes, although it is suggested that it may be related 
to the difficulty in locating the location of the frontal zone in these cases. 
7.1.2 Radar Observations of Smoke Plumes and the Sea-Breeze 
Many wildfires occur in remote regions where observations are limited; as a result, 
the use of satellite and radar imagery is becoming more prominent in fire detection 
and monitoring. It has been suggested that remotely sensed data might also be 
useful in fire behavior prediction (Hufford et al. 1998). Both smoke plumes from 
fires (e.g., Banta et al., 1992) and sea-breeze fronts (e.g., Wilson et al., 1994) are 
clearly visible on radar, especially when the radar is in clear-air mode.  
Previous studies of the signals returned from the radar during clear-air mode 
operation have suggested that the echoes are most likely that of birds or insects 
(Crawford, 1949; Hardy and Katz, 1969; Wilson et al., 1994). Wilson et al. (1994) 
found that the thin line echoes commonly seen in association with sea-breezes 
correlated to updraft regions and result from insects actively flying downward to 
avoid being carried to colder regions of the atmosphere. Atlas (1960) discounts 
the idea of echoes resulting from birds or insects since they would have to fly 
along in a very narrow beam, lowering their flight as the beam lowered, or fly in 
broad waves normal to the beam with the same speed as the beam. Instead, Atlas 
suggests the pattern seen is a result of a sharp increase in the refractive index. 
The contrast on the radar is highest when the offshore flow is dry so the contrast 
is high, leading to higher refractive discontinuities. This would require a sharp 
vertical lapse rate. Battan (1973) suggests both insects and refractive gradients 
could be responsible for the radar echoes. Despite some uncertainty regarding 
exactly what causes the echoes, the sea-breeze signature is readily apparent on 
the radar for the present case and can be used to follow the inland propagation of 
the sea-breeze front.  
Plumes of smoke have also been observed using radar and satellite imagery in 
remote locations such as Alaska (Hufford et al., 1998), where plumes from a 
large wildfire were readily apparent on radar. The plumes from smaller fires were 
not visible, and it was suggested that the plumes in these cases were concentrated 
below the level of the radar beam. High reflectivities (i.e., 20  25 dBZ) were 
noted near the head of the fire, however, and Hufford et al. (1998) suggested that 
radar imagery can be used to provide information on fire location, intensity and 
growth, smoke plumes and fire weather.

7 Interaction between a Wildfire and the Sea-Breeze Front 
85
Smoke from a major industrial fire in Montreal, Canada, was observed on three 
radars operated by McGill University on 23 May 1996 (Rogers and Brown, 1997). 
They suggested that fires produce particulate matter (PM) and create fluctuations 
in the refractive index, both of which are potentially detectable by the radar. In this 
case, they concluded that the echoes are the result of scattering by the particles. 
Banta et al. (1992) also support the idea that particles in smoke are responsible 
for the echoes, with the particles having a flat or needle shape (ash platelets or 
pine needles). 
7.1.3 Effect of Sea-Breezes on Fires 
There are three main factors that affect fire behavior: fuel, weather and topography. 
Weather is by far the most variable and arguably the most important of the three. 
Wind is a strong driver of the rate and direction of fire spread and can also alter 
fire intensity as well. Changes in wind direction can transform a low intensity 
backing fire (moving into the wind) or a moderate intensity flanking fire (moving 
laterally to the wind) into an intense head fire (moving with the wind) capable of 
overrunning fire fighters who thought they were located in a safe area. 
Firefighters typically monitor weather conditions regularly for any changes  
in wind speed or direction at the scene of the fire using hand-held instruments or 
portable weather stations. On days where there is adequate moisture, a line of 
approaching clouds and a gust front may indicate the approach of the sea-breeze 
front. On dry days, there may be no clouds to warn of the impending frontal passage 
and the first indication may be the arrival of the gust front. Most fire personnel 
do not have direct access to radar or satellite data while on a fire scene. Local 
knowledge of the behavior of the sea breeze is extremely important on both wildfires 
and prescribed fires as the onset and structure of the sea breeze are typically 
highly regular in Florida in spring and summer months. One case of a springtime 
wildfire that is of interest is the East fork fire because of the array of data that 
was available during the incident and the opportunity it provided to study the 
sea-breeze–wildfire interaction in a novel way. 
7.1.4 East Fork Fire 
The East fork fire began either late on 4 April 2004, or early on 5 April 2004, in 
the Bradwell Bay Wilderness area of the Apalachicola national forest. This area 
is located in the Florida Panhandle, just southwest of Tallahassee. It is believed 
that the fire was human-caused, either arson or accidental. The fire ultimately 
burned over 26,000 acres of the wilderness area. Fire fighting was made difficult 
due to the restriction on the use of heavy equipment in the wilderness area itself. 
The fire was considered 90% contained by April 16, 2004.

The sea-breeze was a major factor in fighting the East fork fire. Winds shifted 
direction on most afternoons, and these wind shifts resulted in varying directions 
of fire spread. Firefighters had to be aware of these possible weather changes and 
be able to adjust tactics as the weather changed. Conditions during this period were 
generally dry, and the daily sea-breeze circulations did not bring any beneficial 
rains and for the most part were dry events. Because of the dry conditions, the 
WSR-88D radar site in Tallahassee was operating in clear-air mode at the time of 
the fire. During clear-air mode periods, the sea-breeze front is often clearly visible 
on the radar; moreover, smoke plumes can often be seen if they are close enough 
to the radar. In this case, both the sea-breeze and the smoke plume were noted 
together and the resulting interaction between the plume and the sea-breeze front 
could be observed.  
The plan of the present Chapter is as follows: in the following section, the data 
and methodology for both the case study and the idealized numerical simulations 
are described, while Section 7.3 presents the results of the case study. In Section 
7.4, idealized numerical simulations are presented that explore the interaction 
between a buoyant plume and a density current, and Section 7.5 summarizes the 
main results of the present investigation and presents a conceptual model for 
sea-breeze–fire interactions. 
7.2 Data and Methodology 
7.2.1 Case Study 
The goal of this study is to provide an improved understanding of the interactions 
between wildfires and sea-breeze circulations. The foundation of this understanding 
is based upon specific observations of one event that will be augmented by 
idealized numerical simulations. The atmospheric component can be adequately 
described through a combination of surface observations, upper-air soundings 
and radar data (both base reflectivity and radial velocity). Description of the fire 
is considerably more problematic, as no direct measurements of the fire are 
available, except for daily estimates of area burned. As an alternative, we focus 
on the behavior of the smoke plume as observed by the Tallahassee WSR-88D 
radar as a surrogate, since Hufford et al. (1998) found high reflectivities to be 
associated with more intense burning. 
The East Fork Fire burned over a period of approximately two weeks in early 
April of 2004; however, this study only focuses on the early stages of the fire, 
specifically the afternoon of April 5. The location of the East fork fire and the 
four nearby weather stations are shown in Fig. 7.1. Observations of temperature, 
relative humidity, wind speed and direction are used to track the passage of the 
sea-breeze front. A high-pass filter was applied to the temperature and relative

humidity time series to remove waves with periods greater than or equal to 24 h. 
The high-pass filter was accomplished using a Fourier decomposition of a 96 h 
time series for each station and recomposing the time series with the longer wave 
periods excluded. 
 
Figure 7.1 Fire perimeters and observation locations 
As noted above, the Tallahassee WSR-88D radar was operating in clear-air mode 
during this period, which is its most sensitive mode of operation (Crum and Alberty, 
1993). The antenna has a slower rotation rate than in precipitation mode that 
increases the radar sensitivity, and therefore its ability to sense smaller objects in 
the atmosphere. Most of the signal in this mode will be the result of airborne dust 
and PM. In this mode, the radar scans five different elevation angles (0.5e 4.5e, 
in 1e increments) and takes about 10 minutes to complete each scan. In this study 
we will focus our attention on the three lowest elevations (0.5e, 1.5e, and 2.5e) of 
the base reflectivity and radial velocity fields. 
7.2.2 Idealized Numerical Simulations 
The sea-breeze has been studied extensively in the past, and many studies have 
involved the use of numerical models to simulate sea-breeze circulations, both in 
an effort to simulate observed cases and in an idealized context to explore their 
structure and dynamics. From the perspective of idealized simulations of the 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
88 
sea-breeze, Dailey and Fovell (1999), Fovell and Dailey (2001), and Fovell (2005) 
used a 3D cloud-resolving numerical model with horizontal resolutions as high 
as 500 m to explore various aspects of the interactions between sea-breeze fronts 
and horizontal convective rolls in the boundary layer. Several investigators have 
employed even higher resolution in 2D configurations to explore the parallel 
between sea-breeze fronts and density currents (e.g., Sha et al., 1991), and in this 
regard, simulations exploring the dynamics of thunderstorm outflow boundaries 
are also relevant (e.g., Droegemeier and Wilhelmson, 1987; Xu et al., 1996; Xue 
et al., 1997). 
As discussed further below, our approach follows these studies in that the 
sea-breeze is idealized as a density current; however, we employ a large-eddy 
simulation (LES) model focusing solely on the atmospheric boundary layer, with 
model grid spacing on the order of 10 m in all three dimensions, to explore the 
dynamics of the interaction of this density current with a buoyant plume that is 
representative of the smoke plume from a wildland fire. Since it is expected that 
the most significant interaction between the sea-breeze and a fire and its attendant 
plume will occur primarily with the passage of the sea-breeze front, this approach 
appears to be justified, although we acknowledge that there are several details of 
observed sea-breeze circulations that cannot be represented by the present model. 
The LES model to be used is described by Cunningham et al. (2005), and is 
based on the dynamical core of the weather research and forecasting (WRF) model 
in physical height coordinates (Skamarock et al., 2001). The domain size used in 
these simulations is a rectangular box of size 8003,2001,000 m in the x, y, 
and z directions, respectively, with a uniform grid spacing of 10 m in all three 
directions. Boundary conditions are periodic in the x-direction and open-radiative 
in the y-direction. Other details of the LES model are identical to those described 
by Cunningham et al. (2005). 
As noted previously, there is significant evidence that a sea-breeze front can be 
interpreted as a density current, particularly when the ambient wind is in the 
offshore direction. Density currents have been explored extensively by numerical 
models, in an atmospheric context primarily in connection with thunderstorm 
outflows (e.g., Droegemeier and Wilhelmson, 1987; Xu et al., 1996; Xue et al., 
1997), but also in oceanographic (e.g., Özgökmen et al., 2004) and general fluid 
mechanics (e.g., Härtel et al., 2000) contexts, and even with respect to the backdraft 
phenomenon in building fires (e.g., Fleischmann and McGrattan, 1999). Here we 
initialize the density current with a cold pool that is uniform in the y-direction in 
the presence of an opposing flow, to simulate the advance of a sea-breeze front in 
the presence of offshore winds. 
As a final comment concerning the modeling approach, we emphasize that  
the goal of the idealized modeling portion of this study is not to reproduce the 
behavior in the observed case, but rather to gain insight into the basic dynamical 
processes associated with the interaction between a sea-breeze front and a buoyant 
plume representative of those seen with wildland fires.

7.3 Case Study Analysis 
The East fork fire began late on April 4, 2004, or early on April 5, 2004, and is 
suspected to have been started by human causes, either accidental or arson. The 
fire burned in timber and southern rough fuel groups. According to the National 
Interagency Coordination Center reports, by April 7 the fire reached 7,000 acres 
(28.3 km2) and was only 20% contained. Spotting of up to 0.25 mile (0.4 km) 
ahead of the main fire front was observed with rates of spread of 20  30 chains 
per hour (0.11  0.17 m·s–1) reported. This observed fire activity continued and by 
April 8, the area burned had increased to over 8,400 acres (34.0 km2). By April 
13, the fire had consumed almost 20,000 acres (80.9 km2) and was only 70% 
contained. The fire ultimately consumed over 26,000 acres (105.2 km2) of wilderness 
area and was 90% contained by April 15. The total area burned was increased by 
back burning activities of the fire suppression crews. Back burning is used to 
remove fuels ahead of the active fire front and impede the spread of the fire and 
help in containment.  
Hourly surface observations were used to provide an estimate of the passage of 
the sea-breeze front. Unfiltered time series of temperature and relative humidity 
data from four stations near the fire (not shown) indicate that Sanborn, the closest 
of the four stations to the coast, shows the earliest peak in temperature (1,400 EDT), 
while the peak at the other stations is delayed by approximately 2 h. Following 
the temperature maximum is a decrease in temperature spanning 6  8 h, which is 
hardly indicative of the passage of the sea-breeze front, and more closely resembles 
the normal diurnal cycle. The unfiltered relative humidity time series does not 
show a marked change in air mass either. Using a high-pass filter to remove the 
diurnal signal as described in the previous section reveals a stronger sea-breeze 
signal in both the temperature and relative humidity time series (Fig. 7.2). It is 
apparent that Sanborn shows the earliest start to humidity recovery around 1,700 
EDT with the other stations following rather sharply an hour later. 
The sea-breeze front can be seen clearly on the Tallahassee 0.5e elevation  
base reflectivity imagery at 1828 UTC (Fig. 7.3). The East Fork Fire is visible 
approximately 40 km southwest of the radar location and is indicated by a 
reflectivity of approximately 18 dBZ with the smoke plume traveling toward the 
southeast (Fig. 7.3(a)). The sea-breeze front continues to move inland over the 
next several hours and by 1927 UTC (Fig. 7.3(b)) the smoke plume from the fire 
can be seen to increase in intensity with reflectivities reaching 28  32 dBZ for  
a brief period prior to the arrival of the sea-breeze front. By 2025 UTC the 
sea-breeze is just reaching the fire and the plume is displaying reflectivities in the 
range of 20  25 dBZ near the fire (Fig. 7.3(c)), consistent with values observed 
by Hufford et al. (1998) near the head of a rapidly moving wildfire. At 2124 UTC, 
the sea-breeze front has reached the fire, as evidenced by the humidity recovery 
indicated by the Sanborn RAWS site. Despite the start of humidity recovery the

plume intensifies to levels not previously seen with a large core of the plume 
now displaying reflectivities in the 28  32+ dBZ range (Fig. 7.3(d)). Upper-level 
winds at this time are carrying the plume back toward the coast, aided by the 
upper-level return flow of the sea-breeze circulation. The reflectivity of the plume 
decreases from this peak over the next several hours as the fire begins to respond 
to the decreased temperature and increased moisture of the marine air, leading to 
a decline in fire intensity (Figs. 7.3(e) and (f)). 
Base reflectivities from the 0.5e, 1.5e and 2.5e elevations are used to examine 
the vertical structure of the plume at 2,124 UTC, the time of greatest intensity

(Fig. 7.4). At the lowest elevation, the overall plume is 21.25 km in length with 
the region of reflectivity >28 dBZ having a length of 8.75 km. The approximate 
heights of the centroids of the ends of the plume at this elevation are 453 m and 
638 m, well within the 800 m deep mixed layer (estimated from the 1200 UTC 
sounding and observed high temperature). At the 1.5e elevation, the plume is

slightly longer, 23.75 km (length of the 28+ dBZ core has shrunk to 3.75 km), 
ranging in height from 1,151  1,637 m. At this elevation the plume is clearly 
above the mixed layer and in the return flow of the sea-breeze circulation. The 
2.5e elevation reveals a considerably smaller plume, 8.75 km in length (2.5 km for 
the 28+ dBZ core), and spanning elevations of 1,849  2,157 m. The northwest 
corners of the plumes at each level are collocated, indicating that the plume has a 
rather strong vertical core immediately above the fire that would be consistent 
with an intensely burning fire producing a strong buoyancy flux.

The radial velocity field from the WSR-88D is a useful tool in identifying 
areas of convergence and divergence. The 0.5e elevation radial velocity field from 
Tallahassee shows a well defined convergence zone along the sea-breeze front as 
it pushes inland against the prevailing northwesterly flow in the region (Fig. 7.5). 
Near the fire the pattern is more complex as the rising plume generates a region 
of divergence oriented along the axis of the plume, possibly marking the return 
flow of the thermal circulation generated by the intense heating of the fire. At  
the 1.5e elevation, a divergence pattern is still discernible along the plume axis 
although its extent is limited to the area near the peak in base reflectivity. 
It should be noted that we have avoided making any direct comments as to the 
magnitudes of the velocities shown. This is due to the relatively broad spectrum 
width observed by the radar in the vicinity of the plume which is indicative of a 
highly turbulent environment, and thus renders the magnitudes of the radar-derived 
velocities less reliable.

representations of panels (a) and (c), respectively, with base reflectivities of 12 dBZ

7.4 Numerical Simulations 
In this Section, we present results from three numerical simulations to explore 
the nature of the interaction between a density current and a buoyant plume: two 
simulations in which a density current and a plume are examined in isolation, 
respectively, and one in which both are present and are allowed to interact. 
The density current is initialized with a cold pool at one end of the domain 
(Fig. 7.6). When the simulation is started, the cold pool adjusts under gravity and 
initiates a density current that travels in the positive y-direction. The ambient 
winds are directed in the negative y-direction, thus representing an offshore flow 
situation. The cold pool is initially uniform in the x-direction, but rapidly becomes 
3D with the development of lobe and cleft instabilities (not shown), consistent 
with laboratory experiments and previous numerical investigations using three- 
dimensional models. 
 
Figure 7.6 Model initial conditions in the y  z plane at x 480 m of potential 
temperature (contour interval 1 K) and wind vectors in the plane of the section (in 
m·s–1, vector scale shown at bottom right) 
Figure 7.7(a) depicts the potential temperature, vertical velocity, and wind field 
in the y  z plane. The Kelvin–Hemholtz billows characteristic of the interface 
between the density current and the ambient atmosphere are apparent, as is the 
enhanced vertical motion and return flow associated with the density current. 
Figure 7.7(b) illustrates the simulation of the plume only. The plume is initiated 
by a heat source centered at y 2,700 m, the spatial configuration of which is a 
smoothed top-hat function. Characteristic features of the plume are similar to those 
described in more detail in the simulations by Cunningham et al. (2005). 
The simulation in which both the plume and the density current are present is 
depicted in Fig. 7.7(c). It is evident that the interaction between the density current 
and the plume results in an apparent intensification of the plume, particularly in 
the vertical velocity field, in conjunction with the arrival of the circulation 
associated with the current, and that this intensification occurs before the head of 
the density current reaches the heat source. The intensification apparently occurs 
in response to the pressure perturbation that precedes the head of the current: this

pressure perturbation, which can impact the plume for a period of time before the 
arrival of the colder, more dense air behind the head of the current, counteracts 
the ambient flow at low levels such that the plume becomes more vertical 
(compare Fig. 7.7(b) with Fig. 7.7(c)), resulting in vertical velocities that are 
significantly stronger than those seen in the plume in isolation.

7.5 Summary and Conclusions 
Sea-breeze circulations are frequently observed to have a significant impact on 
fire behavior; however, the nature of the interaction between wildfires and the 
sea-breeze is poorly understood, and has not been studied extensively. In this 
Chapter, radar observations of a plume associated with a wildfire in Florida were 
presented that suggest that the arrival of a sea-breeze front results in a temporary, 
but significant, increase in fire intensity. This intensification precedes the arrival 
of the sea-breeze front at the location of the fire, such that the fire intensity is a 
maximum at the time of, and slightly after, the passage of the front, and decreases 
gradually thereafter with the arrival of cooler and moister air behind the front. 
There is insufficient evidence to explain this intensification; however, the 
idealized numerical simulations presented in Section 7.4 suggest that the period 
of interaction preceding the arrival of the current may result in the temporary 
intensification of vertical velocity in the plume. This increase in vertical velocity 
appears to result from the interaction of the plume with a pressure perturbation 
that precedes the head of the density current. The direct impact of this interaction 
on fire behavior is uncertain, however, and requires further study, particularly 
using coupled atmosphere-fire models to explore the details of this interaction. 
Another aspect of the wildland fire-sea-breeze system that warrants investigation 
is how these interactions influence local and regional air quality.

Abstract In this paper, conflicting interests in prescribed burn practice and 
improving air quality in the South are reviewed. Conflicting societal interests 
and legislative actions threaten to curtail the use of prescribed fire to manage 
for endangered species and for other land management objectives in the South. 
This comes at a time when efforts are being made to increase prescribed 
burning on existing forest land and to initiate prescribed burning on tracts of 
old agricultural land that are being restored to forest land. Regulatory interests 
regarding impacts of regional haze on visibility and impacts of fine particulate 
matter on health are increasingly in conflict with management objectives 
driven by natural resource management. The air quality community is 
increasingly relying on computer air quality models for understanding the 
movement of pollutants across regions and for the chemical interactions of 
airborne materials. The success of air quality/air chemistry models depends 
on the availability of accurate source inventories. Wildland burning in the 
South is considered a significant contributor to the organics inventory. 
Because prescribed fires are managed, the timing and locations of burns and 
where in the atmosphere fire products are distributed must be taken into 
account. Therefore land managers become active players in local and regional 
air quality.  
A technique for incorporating the land manager into regional air quality 
modeling is described. The core of the technique is two modeling tools for 
dealing with the conflicting interests, that is, a dynamical-stochastic smoke 
model, Daysmoke, and a “modeling framework”, the SHRMC-4S. Daysmoke 
distributes smoke in the atmosphere after the manner the burns are “engineered” 
by land managers. SHRMC-4S is constructed by linking an atmospheric 
chemical model, CMAQ, with Daysmoke. Applications of the two modeling 
tools to a prescribed burn case are illustrated. Daysmoke produces a ground

PM level close to the measured value if complex plume structures are correctly 
modeled. CMAQ simulations of ground-level PM for a single prescribed 
fire suffer from grid resolution.

8.1 Introduction 
The American South comprises one of the most productive forested areas in the 
United States with approximately 200 million acres (81 million ha) or 40% of the 
nation’s forests in an area occupying only 24% of the U.S. land area (SRFRR, 
1996). Furthermore, Southern forests are dynamic ecosystems characterized by 
rapid growth and hence rapid deposition of fuels within a favorable climate, and 
a high fire-return rate of every 3 5 years (Stanturf et al., 2002).  
Research efforts in investigating the air quality effects of prescribed fires in 
the South have been made in the Southern high-resolution modeling consortium 
(SHRMC). SHRMC was established as one of the USDA forest service fire consortia 
for advanced modeling of meteorology and smoke (FCAMMS) centers funded 
by the national fire plan (NFP). 
As the air quality community relies more on high-resolution air quality/air 
chemistry models such as CMAQ, it is critical that emissions inventories from 
prescribed burns supplied to these models are accurate. The timing and locations 
of burns and where in the atmosphere fire products are distributed must be taken 
into account.  
Prescribed burns are managed fires. Land managers choose the day and time to 
conduct their burns under favorable dispersion conditions. Land managers determine 
how much fire to place on the landscape and how the fire is to be distributed. 
Therefore, land managers are active players in local and regional scale air quality. 
Our objective is to design a regional scale air quality “modeling framework” 
that gives land managers a “say” in how their land management practices are 
incorporated into air quality/air chemistry models. The framework is called 
Southern High-Resolution Modeling Consortium Southern Smoke Simulation 
System SHRMC-4S (Achtemeier et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2004). SHRMC-4S 
includes models to simulate fire emissions, local smoke movement (including 
plume rise), high-resolution meteorological processes (MM5) and air chemistry 
(CMAQ). SHRMC-4S, in comparison with the modeling framework, Bluesky 
(O’Neill et al., 2003), is designed specifically for assessing air quality impacts 
from prescribed burning in the South through CMAQ. 
The impact of prescribed burn “engineering” by the land manager is modeled 
through plume rise—how high the plume goes and the vertical distribution of 
smoke particles. The plume model determines the fraction of smoke left in the

atmospheric boundary layer (mixed layer) that can be transported to the ground 
locally and the fraction of smoke partitioned at higher altitudes. Smoke carried to 
higher altitudes will be transported regionally or beyond by prevailing winds. 
The national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) apply to the ground-level 
pollutant concentrations. When more smoke is injected at higher altitudes and 
dispersed to remote areas, the chances for exceeding the NAAQS standards locally 
and regionally are reduced. Specification of plume rise is thus crucial for evaluating 
the air quality effects of prescribed burning. Many efforts have made to develop 
smoke plume rise schemes (e.g. Pouliot et al., 2005).  
In this Chapter, issues on the air quality effects of prescribed fire are discussed. 
The development of the modeling tools and their applications to simulating the 
air quality effects are described. 
8.2 Conflicts over the Airshed of the American South 
One of the adverse consequences of prescribed burning is degradation of air 
quality (Ward and Hardy, 1991; Sandberg et al., 1999; Riebau and Fox, 2001). Air 
pollution from smoke has led to conflicts between interest groups involved with 
clean air and forest management. Issues of human health, nuisance smoke, 
visibility, and transportation hazard often stand against issues of forest health and 
safety, wildlife management, ecosystem restoration, timber production, and carbon 
sequestration. In some instances, the clean air act conflicts with the threatened 
and endangered species act. 
Prescribed burning is extensively used, treating 6  8 million acres (2  3 million 
ha) of forest and agricultural lands each year (Wade et al., 2000). Prescribed fire 
has long been recognized as the most economical means for managing timberlands 
for fiber production. Prescribed fire eliminates species that compete for nutrients 
and reduces buildup of dead and live fuels that increase the hazard of destructive 
wildfire.  
The mild, mostly snow and ice free winters make the Southern climate ideal 
for the development of retirement communities. Thousands of older people, some 
with respiratory problems, have relocated into these communities. Many of these 
retirees have little or no experience with forestry practices and therefore may not 
be receptive to frequent incursions of smoke into their communities. Human health 
concerns and issues of nuisance have created a need for regulation of smoke. 
The South has some of the highest levels of PM and ozone in the nation. Fires 
have been found to be an important contributor (Zheng et al., 2002). Smog, regional 
haze, and visibility impairment are air quality issues addressed by the U.S. EPA. 
Prescribed burning releases PM2.5 and PM10 (particulate matter (PM) with a size not 
greater than 2.5 m and 10 m, respectively), NO2 and volatile organic compounds 
(VOC), which are either direct contributor or precursors of O3. Prescribed burning 
also emits CO, SO2, which together with PM, NO2, and O3 are the criteria air 

 
Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
102 
pollutants subject to the U.S. NAAQS (EPA, 2003). 
The EPA has issued the interim air quality policy on wildland and prescribed 
fire to protect public health and welfare by mitigating the impacts of air pollutant 
emissions from wildland fires on air quality (EPA, 1998). Among various issues 
of concern in the South is the contribution of burning to PM2.5 concentrations. 
PM2.5 is a risk to both human health and the environment. It is able to penetrate 
to the deepest parts of the lungs. It is also a major cause of visibility impairment 
and a contributing factor for acid rain. EPA established NAAQS for PM2.5 in 1997 
and Biomass burning is one of the major sources for the atmospheric PM2.5.  
These air quality regulatory concerns conflict with growth in the need for 
prescribed burning of Southern forest lands. The Endangered Species Act, requires 
land managers to manage habitat to preserve or increase populations of threatened 
and endangered species. For example, prescribed fire is used in the coastal plains 
and Piedmont regions of the Southeast to improve habitat for the red-cockaded 
woodpecker (Picoides borealis Vieillot)—a species listed as endangered under 
the endangered species act (Achtemeier et al., 1998). 
An example of conflicting legislation is to be found in the Southern Appalachians. 
There, a low-growing shrub species called Hudsonia montana Nuttall is listed as 
a threatened species under the endangered species act. H. montana is dependent 
upon fire for survival. Including prescribed burning in a recovery plan would be 
straightforward except that the largest populations of H. montana are found within 
and adjacent to the Linville Gorge Wilderness, a Class Ē area, governed by clean 
air regulations (Achtemeier et al., 1998). 
The conflict between managing for natural resources and managing for air 
quality has placed Southern land managers in the difficult position of “getting it 
right all of the time.” Through careful monitoring of fuel moisture and weather 
conditions land managers have learned to “engineer” prescribed burns to accomplish 
natural resource objectives while minimizing (though not eliminating) impacts 
on local air quality. Although the vast majority of prescribed burns are done 
without incident, there are occasions when weather conditions are not as expected 
and local and regional air quality is compromised. 
8.3 Daysmoke 
The southern burn program is threatened by nuisance complaints, litigation, and 
lowering of 24 hour fine particulate (PM2.5) air quality standards. Land managers 
need to have accurate downwind fine particulate predictions if they are to continue 
burning at the same levels as they have in the past or increase their burning 
programs. The daysmoke plume model incorporates a human factor—how burns 
are engineered by land managers through burning techniques/ignition methods—in 
modeling smoke from prescribed burns. Therefore daysmoke may provide land 
managers with a tool that will assist in achieving their burn programs.

Daysmoke (Achtemeier et al., 2006) is a dynamical-stochastic plume model 
designed to simulate smoke from prescribed burns in a manner consistent with 
how the burns are engineered by land managers. It is an extension of ASHFALL, 
a plume model developed to simulate deposition of ash from sugar cane fires 
(Achtemeier, 1998). Daysmoke consists of four models (Fig. 8.1): ķ Entraining 
turret plume model. The plume is assumed to be a succession of rising turrets. 
The rate of rise of each turret is a function of its initial temperature, vertical 
velocity, effective diameter, and entrainment. ĸ Detraining particle trajectory 
model. Movement within the plume is described by the horizontal and vertical 
wind velocity within the plume, turbulent horizontal and vertical velocity within 
the plume, and particle terminal velocity. Detrainment occurs when stochastic 
plume turbulence places particles beyond plume boundaries, plume rise rate falls 
below a threshold vertical velocity, or absolute value of large eddy velocity exceeds 
plume rise rate. Ĺ A large eddy parameterization. Eddies are 2D and oriented 
normal to the axis of the mean layer flow. Eddy size and strength are proportional 
to depth of the planetary boundary-layer (PBL). Eddy growth and dissipation are 
time-dependent and are independent of growth rates of neighboring eddies. Eddy 
structure is vertical. Eddies are transported by the mean wind in the PBL. 
ĺ Relative emissions production model. Particles passing a “wall” three miles 
downwind from a burn are counted for each hour during the burning period.

104 
Daysmoke has many unique features in comparison with some existing smoke 
transport tools used by land and fire managers in determining downwind transport 
of PM2.5. The ventilation index (ė) is the product of the depth of the atmospheric 
boundary layer (mixing layer) with the transport wind speed (the mean wind speed 
within the mixing layer). The ė is used to regulate the amount of fuel consumed 
on a given day according to ambient weather conditions. However, the ė is 
limited by the inherent assumptions that the horizontal dimension of the burn site 
normal to the wind speed is of infinite length and that all smoke remains within 
the mixed layer. The dispersion index (Lavdas, 1986) modified the ė for an 
ensemble of finite burn areas and explicitly incorporates atmospheric stability; 
although the dispersion index also maintains the assumption that all smoke remains 
within the mixed layer. Lavdas (1996) linked fuels information with meteorological 
data through VSMOKE, a smoke “screening” model for local smoke dispersion. 
The Florida fire management information system (Goodrick and Brenner, 1999; 
Brenner and Goodrick, 2005) merges the cross flow Gaussian horizontal dispersion 
properties of VSMOKE with 3D trajectories produced by HYSPLIT (Draxler and 
Hess, 1997) to estimate smoke plume movement and the ground-level impact of 
PM2.5 concentrations on potentially hazardous visibility reductions. 
However, none of the existing tools includes the “human element”—how the 
burns are engineered by land managers. By the choice of firing method—head 
fire, back fire, mass ignition (where, when, and how much fire is dropped from 
helicopters)—land managers can influence the timing of heat production and 
how much heat is produced over the course of the burn. Thus fire ignition timing 
and pattern can be a major contributor to how high smoke rises and how much is 
released during a period of evolving mixing layer height within a time-dependent 
wind field. 
Daysmoke includes theory for particulate detrainment from the smoke plume. 
Daysmoke removes a restrictive assumption inherent in VSMOKE and the 
Ventilation Index namely that all smoke is contained within the mixed layer. 
Daysmoke also removes the imposed vertical distribution of smoke in VSMOKE 
and the instantaneous even distribution of ė. If the convective smoke plume is 
relatively weak, all or part of it may be captured, torn apart, and dispersed by 
turbulence within the mixed layer before it rises to an altitude of thermal 
equilibrium. If the convective smoke plume is strong, most of the smoke may be 
ejected into the free atmosphere far above the top of the mixed layer with little or 
no smoke remaining to be dispersed within the mixed layer. 
The primary application of daysmoke is simulating local scale smoke 
concentrations for planning and regulatory purposes. A secondary application is 
acting as a “smoke-injector” for regional scale air quality models by replacing 
current plume rise formulations and providing a more representative vertical smoke 
distribution for wildland fires. Daysmoke is also intended as a training tool to 
increase our understanding of how ground-level concentrations of PM2.5 can be 
manipulated by burn technique/ignition strategies.

8.4 SHRMC-4S 
An overview of SHRMC-4S is shown in Fig. 8.2. Each box along the blue arrow 
represents steps needed to accomplish the objective of including emissions from 
wildland fires in regional scale air quality models. The first box, Fire Data, gets 
SHRMC-4S started. Information on the size of the tract of land to be burned, the 
date and time of the burn, the location of the burn, plus pertinent data on the 
kinds and state of fuels is supplied by the land manager. Fire activity data is 
processed through combustion models that calculate emissions inventories for 
the burns (the Emissions Calculation box). The outputs are hourly productions of 
heat and the masses of gases and particulate compounds—fire products. The sparse 
matrix operator kernel emissions modeling system (SMOKE) (Houyoux et al., 2002) 
processes emission data and provides initial and boundary chemical conditions 
for the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) model (Byun and Ching, 1999) 
for chemical modeling (fourth box). Then a visualization for illustrating 
modeling results is the last step. The NCAR/Penn State mesoscale model (MM5) 
(Grell et al., 1994) is used for providing meteorological conditions for emission 
calculation and SMOKE and CMAQ simulation.  
 
Figure 8.2 An overview of the SHRMC-4S framework 
Several modifications were made to SMOKE for prescribed burning applications 
(Liu et al., 2006a). Area and point sources are among the various emission categories 
in SMOKE. Area source emissions are annual amounts (or converted to daily 
averages) from counties, and are put only at the lowest model level, whereas point 
source emissions are emitted daily or hourly amounts from certain locations like 
power plants, and are partitioned to multiple levels. Fires have been traditionally 
regarded as an area source, but they are more likely a point source because they 
occur as individual events geographically with hourly and daily variability, and 

 
Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires

smoke may be partitioned through a depth of a few kilometers. To include fire 
emissions as a point source in SHRMC-4S, fire emission files for SMOKE were 
created. A fire is identified through its latitude and longitude in an emission file 
in the inventory data analyzer (IDA) format. All fire properties (height, diameter, 
exit temperature, exit velocity, and flow rate) are included in this file. Day- or 
hour-specific emissions of various chemical species are stored in separate files in 
the emissions modeling system’95 (EMS-95) format.  
The other modification was to link daysmoke to SMOKE as an addition to the 
laypoint algorithm for estimating plume rise and specification of plume vertical 
profiles. The fourth component of daysmoke, the relative emissions production 
model, counts particles passing a “wall” three miles downwind from a burn for each 
hour during the burn period. A percent of particle number at each layer at each hour 
relative to the total particle number is assigned to SMOKE/CMAQ simulations. 
Prescribed fire data is obtained from the existing systems or those to be developed. 
The portion of this total fuel load consumed by the fire is determined using the 
single parameter regression equations of CONSUME 3.0 (Ottmar et al., 1993). 
Fire emissions are calculated by multiplying the consumed fuel by an emission 
factor appropriate for the fuel type and ignition plan (Mobley et al., 1976). These 
total emission values are transformed into hourly values using equations provided 
in Sandberg and Peterson (1984). 
8.5 Application 
Daysmoke and SHRMC-4S have been used for simulating smoke movements 
and the air quality impacts of a number of prescribed burns in the South. 
Simulations with the two modeling tools of a burn case at the Tennessee /North 
Carolina border on March 18, 2006 have been conducted (Achtemeier et al., 2006; 
Liu et al., 2006b). They are briefly illustrated here. 
8.5.1 Burn 
The Cherokee national forest conducted the Brush Creek prescribed burn on 743 
ha of woodland near the Tennessee/North Carolina State line (upper left hand 
corner of Fig. 8.3) approximately 50 km northwest of Asheville, NC on 18 March 
2006. Approximately 670 ha or 90% of the land area was expected to be burned. 
The site had never had a prescribed fire nor had a wildfire occurred recently. The 
district staff estimated 26.9 metric tons of fuel would be consumed for each 
hectare burned. Aerial ignition at Brush Creek began along the main and spur ridges 
between 1,220 and 1,400 EST then further ignition was done between 1,620 and 
1,710 EST. During the active burning phase, fire would have spread down the side

slopes until no fuels were available to ignite. Hourly estimates of area consumed 
were used by the REM to model the history of the burn.  
 
Figure 8.3 Smoke plume image processed from the Polar satellite (received from 
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration) showing the cloud of smoke 
from the Brush Creek prescribed fire at 1,715 EST (Provided by William A. Jackson, 
Air Resource Specialist, Cherokee National Forest) 
The leading edge of the smoke plume from the Brush Creek burn passed 
Asheville, NC, between 1,515 and 1,530 EST. Shortly after 1,600, elevated fine 
PM concentrations were measured at a particulate monitor in Asheville operated by 
the Western North Carolina Regional Air Quality Agency (Fig. 8.4). Concentrations 
of PM2.5 rose from near zero to 106 g·m–3 at 1,700 EST and to 130 g·m–3 by 
1,800 EST. These PM levels could cause some people who are sensitive to air 
pollutants to experience short-term health problems. The concentrations fell back 
to 30 g·m–3 by 2,100 EST. 
8.5.2 Daysmoke Simulation 
Even though the smoke plume shown in Fig. 8.3 is a simple plume, with the 
implication of a simple plume updraft, the plume structures can be complex. Many 
smoke plumes are supported by multiple-core updrafts—subplumes rising from 
the flaming areas and merging into a single plume. Daysmoke allows for the 
simulation of multiple-core updraft plumes.

daysmoke. Each line represents a ten-simulation average. Maximum hourly

Daysmoke is a combined dynamic-stochastic model. Stochastic terms control 
small scale turbulence within the plume and within the ambient atmosphere. The 
large eddy parameterization model is linked to clock-time so that large eddy 
magnitudes and distributions will be different each time daysmoke is executed 
(averages of ten simulations for each updraft core were used to calculate the 
concentrations shown in Fig. 8.5). Therefore, individual simulations by daysmoke 
vary according to the stochastic terms. The average peak concentration for the one- 
core updraft is 42 g·m–3 but varies between 30 60 g·m–3. The ensemble average 
for the 10-core updraft is 244 g·m–3 with a range between 211  279 g·m–3. 
Figure 8.6 compares the means and distributions of daysmoke-predicted ground- 
level PM2.5 concentrations at 1,700 hours as a function of the number of updraft 
cores in a prescribed burn plume. PM2.5 concentrations from the 1-core solutions 
were all under-predictions of observed levels at Asheville (130 g·m–3—dashed line). 
Furthermore, concentrations from the 10-core solutions were all over-predictions 
of observed levels. Although the mean of the 4-core solution (141 g·m–3) was 
closest to the Asheville observation, some results from the 3-core and 5-core 
solutions also bracketed the 130 g·m–3 concentration. 
 
Figure 8.6 The means and distributions for each updraft core number compared 
with the maximum hourly PM2.5 concentration (dashed line) observed at Asheville, 
NC (from Achtemeier et al., 2006) 
8.5.3 CMAQ Simulation 
The model domain is configured with a 4030 horizontal grid with 21 vertical 
layers. The horizontal resolution is 12 km. This resolution is too low to accurately 
simulate smoke concentration from a single burn with a size of approximately 

 
Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
110 
1 km. The emission intensity for the grid box that includes the burn site is about 
two-orders of magnitude smaller than that at the burn site. This simulation provides 
an example of application of daysmoke in CMAQ. The Carbon Bond-ĕ (CB-ĕ) 
chemical mechanism is used to simulate gas-phase chemistry in CMAQ. Daysmoke 
is used to estimate plume rise and vertical distribution. 
Figure 8.7 shows the height of smoke plume (plume rise) and vertical profile 
of the smoke particle simulated with Daysmoke for 1-core and 10-core updrafts. 
For the 1-core updraft (Fig. 8.7(a)), plume rise is about 1.5 km from 1,200 to 
1,600 LST and increases to 2.1 km at 1,700. For the 10-core updraft (Fig. 8.7(b)), 
plume rise is about 0.75 km at 1,200 LST with the largest percentage occurring at 
about 0.6 km. Plume rise gradually increases to 1.1 km at next hour and remains 
there until 1,700. It reduces to 0.92 km at 1,800. These results indicate two 
differences between 1- and 10-core updrafts. First, plume rise is usually smaller for 
multiple-core. Thus, more smoke particles are distributed at lower levels in the 
atmosphere. Second, plume rise simulations for 1-core updrafts place most smoke 
high above the PBL, while simulations for 10-core updrafts place smoke close to 
or slightly higher than the PBL. This results in significant impacts on the ground 
concentrations when daysmoke smoke profiles are linked to CMAQ. 
Figure 8.8 shows the geographic distribution of ground-level PM2.5 at 1,700, 
when largest concentrations were observed at Asheville. The smoke plume spreads 
from the burn site south-southeastward to the North Carolina-South Carolina 
border. The transport track is close to what shows in the satellite image (Fig. 8.3) 
but with too much lateral spread. For both simulations, the magnitudes of 
concentrations are too small in comparison with the measurements at Asheville. 
The underprediction by CMAQ is primarily due to the 12 km resolution of the 
model domain which causes a laterally wider spread of the plume. In comparison, 
the magnitudes of the concentrations for the 10-core updraft are about 2  3 times 
of that for the 1-core updraft. 
Figure 8.9 shows time-height cross sections of PM2.5 concentrations over 
Asheville as simulated by daysmoke/CMAQ. The plume reaches Asheville after 
1,500. Both simulations show two peaks in concentrations (an outcome of a 1-hour 
lapse in aerial ignition) the first arriving at 1,600 and the second arriving at 1,800. 
This result compares with the PM measurements at Asheville which show a general 
peak between 1,700 and 1,900. The main difference between the 1- and 10-core 
updraft simulations is in the vertical distributions of smoke. Large concentrations 
are found between 1.1 km and 1.5 km above ground for 1-core updraft, and within 
about 1 km above ground for 10-core updraft. The one-core simulation placed most 
smoke far enough above the PBL that few particles were transported to the ground 
(Fig. 8.9(a)). As Fig. 8.9(b) shows, most particles are found within the PBL for the 
10-core updraft simulation and these are nearly uniformly distributed from the 
ground to the top of PBL by strong turbulent mixing.

8.6 Summary and Discussion 
Two tools for smoke transport and the regional air quality modeling of prescribed 
burns, daysmoke and SHRMC-4S, have been described. Their applications have 
been illustrated by a recent burn case in a National Forest. The daysmoke plume 
model incorporates a human factor—how burns are engineered by land managers 
through burning techniques/ignition methods—in modeling smoke from prescribed 
burns. Therefore daysmoke may provide land managers with a tool that will assist 
in achieving their burn programs. SHRMC-4S is a framework for smoke and air 
quality research focused on prescribed fires in the South. daysmoke has been 
linked as an alternative to the layer fraction method in SMOKE/CMAQ for smoke

tools for understanding smoke transport and the impacts on local and regional air 
quality. Daysmoke produces a ground PM level that could cause some people 
who are sensitive to air pollutants to experience short-term health problems. The 
simulated magnitude is close to the measured one. Daysmoke simulation and the 
resultant plume rise are dependent on the number of updraft cores. This property 
has an important impact on CMAQ simulations. The simulated ground PM level 
with CMAQ is larger for multiple-core updraft than single-core updraft.  
Although some measurements were used for the development and validation 
of daysmoke, more measurements are needed for further validation of this model 
and comparison with other plume rise schemes. Furthermore, more complete 
prescribed fire information is needed for improving the performance of SHRMC-4S. 
Model performance is dependent on accurate specification of burn and other 
properties such as the number of updraft cores. In addition, the application case 
of daysmoke to CMAQ simulate presented here was run off-line. The two models 
need to be coupled to each other to make daysmoke a more practically useful tool 
for CMAQ simulation.  
Daysmoke has shown us that the dynamics of smoke plumes from prescribed 
burns are complex, often far more complex than dynamics of plumes from industrial 
stacks. Application of smoke models designed for industrial stacks should not be 
expected to yield accurate results for smoke plumes from prescribed burns unless 
the multiple-core updraft issue is taken into consideration.

Abstract Wildland fire missions can significantly affect regional and global 
air quality, radiation, climate, and the carbon cycle. A fundamental and yet 
challenging prerequisite to understanding the environmental effects is to 
accurately estimate fire emissions. This chapter describes and analyzes fire 
emission calculations. Various techniques (field measurements, empirical 
relations, modeling, and remote sensing) to obtain fuel and fire properties are 
first reviewed. A calculation of fire emissions across the continental U.S. is 
then illustrated. In this calculation, an approach recently developed based on 
high-resolution fuel types from satellite remote sensing is used for fuel loading 
factors. The burning information is obtained from a historical fire dataset 
collected by multiple U.S. governmental agencies. The U.S. fire emissions 
show large spatial and temporal variability. Finally, uncertainties in fire 
emission estimates are examined by comparing with another method using 
the traditional AP-42 Table approach for fuel loading. Emissions with the 
satellite remote sensing approach are mostly reduced in the western U.S., but 
increased in the eastern coastal regions. A perspective on future fire emission 
research is given.

9.1 Introduction 
Wildlfire is one of the major natural disasters in the United States that threaten 
human life and property. Millions of acres of forest and other ecosystems are

burned annually. In 2000, for example, more than 100 thousand fires consumed 
8.4 million acres (3.4 million ha) (NIFC, 2002). Nearly 30 thousand people were 
involved in wildland firefighting efforts, costing the federal agency fire suppression 
about $1.4 billion. Prescribed burning, on the other hand, is a forest management 
technique that temporarily reduces damage from wildfire by removing a portion 
of the accumulating dead fuels (such as duff and logs on the forest floor) and 
reducing the stature of the developing understory when burning conditions are not 
severe (Wade and Outcalt, 1999). These intentional fires also serve as a surrogate 
for the historical fires by recycling nutrients and restoring/sustaining ecosystem 
health. The areas burned by prescribed fires have the same order as those by 
wildfires (Stanturf et al., 2002).  
Emissions from wildland fires can cause severe environmental consequences. 
Fires release large amount of particulate matter (PM) and ozone precursors, 
adversely affecting regional air quality (Sandberg et al., 1999; Riebau and Fox, 
2001). PM and ozone, as well as some other trace gas emissions, are criteria air 
pollutants subject to the national ambient air quality standards (NAAQS) established 
by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA, 2003a). EPA recently 
established air quality standards for PM2.5 (PM with a diameter of 2.5 m or 
smaller) and revised standards for ground-level O3 and PM10 (PM with a diameter 
of 10 m or smaller) as an effort to reduce regional haze and smog and to improve 
visibility. EPA also issued the interim air quality policy on wildland and prescribed 
fire (EPA, 1998) to protect public health and welfare by mitigating the impacts of 
air pollutant emissions from wildland fires on air quality.  
Smoke particles are one of the atmospheric aerosol sources, which can affect 
global and regional radiation (e.g., Penner et al., 1992). They can modify earth 
radiation balance by scattering and absorbing solar radiation (direct radiative 
forcing) (Charlson et al., 1992), and by changing droplet size and life time of clouds, 
which are one of the most important factors for atmospheric radiative transfers 
(indirect radiative forcing) (Twomey et al., 1984). The radiative forcing can further 
change regional climate, monsoon, and drought (Hansen et al., 1997; Ackerman 
et al., 2000; Menon et al., 2002; Koren et al., 2004; Liu, 2005a and b). 
Fires also affect the carbon cycles. Carbon emissions due to fire increase 
atmospheric CO2 concentration. The perturbation of atmospheric chemistry induced 
by biomass burning is comparable in magnitude to the effect of fossil fuel burning 
(Lindesay et al., 1996). The 1997 Indonesia Fires emitted as much carbon into the 
atmosphere as Europe’s annual carbon emissions from burning fossil fuel (Page 
et al., 2002). Thus, biomass burning is an important source for regional atmospheric 
carbon. On the other hand, fires affect the ecosystem uptake of atmospheric carbon. 
Biomass accumulates by consuming atmospheric carbon through photosynthetic 
reaction. The terrestrial ecosystem, therefore, acts as a sink of atmospheric carbon 
during this process. Fire disturbance will alter the magnitude of this sink.  
A fundamental and yet challenging prerequisite to understanding the environmental 
effects of smoke is to accurately estimate fire emissions. Fire emissions can be

calculated using fire and fuel properties such as area burned, fuel loading or 
consumption factors, and emission factors. Various techniques for calculating these 
properties have been developed. This Chapter describes calculation and analysis 
of fire emissions. Fire emission calculation formula and techniques for obtaining 
fuel and fire properties are reviewed in Section 9.2. A calculation of fire emission 
in the continental U.S. is presented in Section 9.3. Uncertainty in fire emission 
estimates is discussed in Section 9.4. Summary and a perspective on future fire 
emission research are given in Section 9.5.  
9.2 Fire Emission Calculation  
As indicated in the following formula (Seiler and Crutzen, 1980), 
 

E
A f  L S   
(9.1) 
fire emission E (in mass) is determined by four fuel and fire properties: area 
burned A, consumption efficiency f (fraction of fuel consumed), fuel loading L 
(mass of forest fuel per unit area), and emission factor S (mass of the species per 
unit mass of forest fuel consumed). The product of f and L is also called effective 
fuel consumption or fuel loading factor (mass of forest fuel per unit area burned). 
These properties can be obtained using the techniques briefly described below. 
9.2.1 Measurements 
Burned area has been traditionally obtained from ground measurement and reporting 
systems. There are a number of regional and national datasets available, in the 
format of either individual burnings or total burnings of a county or state. The 
examples are the nation-wide prescribed fires in 1989 (Peterson and Ward, 1993; 
Ward et al., 1993), wildfires over 11 Western states (Hardy et al., 1998), the data 
used for developing the EPA the national emission inventory (NEI) for three base 
years of 1996, 1999, and 2002 (EPA, 2003a), and the federal fire historic dataset 
(BLM, 2003). The dataset developed by the department of interior bureau of land 
management (BLM) collects individual fires over the lands owned by five U.S. 
federal agencies (BLM, Bureau of Indian Affairs, Fish and Wildlife Service, National 
Park Service, and USDA Forest Service). Besides area burned, this dataset also 
includes fire information on number, date, location, type, and causes. Figure 9.1 
shows wildfire burned areas in each of the contiguous U.S. states. 
9.2.2 Empirical relations  
Empirical relations have been used extensively to obtain fire emission factors and

fuel consumption factors. EPA (1995) has formed a table of default values (AP-42 
Table) for emission factors of major species. Emission factors in Table 9.1 are 
adopted from the AP-42 Table for all species except CO2, which is derived based 
on the flaming fire emission factor (Battye and Battye, 2002, Table 39) and Hao 
et al. (2002). The emission factors are geographically independent. Fuel loading 
factors for the USDA forest service regions (Fig. 9.2) from the AP-42 Table are 
listed in Table 9.2.

An effort was recently made to improve the traditionally used AP-42 fuel loading 
factors. The Western regional air partnership (WRAP, 2002) developed an approach 
to estimate fuel loading and consumption using the national fire danger rating system 
(NFDRS) (Cohen and Deeming, 1985) vegetation types for the WRAP states. 
This approach was extended by EPA (2003b) to the reminder of the contiguous 
U.S. using the 1999 NFDRS fuel classification map at 1 km resolution derived 
from a combination of satellite and ground data (Burgen et al., 1998). The state 
accumulated values from the RS approach are also listed in Table 9.2.

9.2.3 Modeling 
Numerous fuel models have been developed. Fuel types in NFDRS are represented 
by 20 fuel models, each of which falls into one of four groups that account for fuels 
composed mainly of grass, shrub, timber, or slash. In consume, a comprehensive fuel 
model (Ottmar et al., 1993), separate algorithms are used to calculate consumption 
of different fuels based on fuel loading, slope, wind, and fuel moisture. In the FCCS 
(Sandberg et al., 2001), live and dead fuel loadings for 16 types of fuels across 6 
layers, from canopy to duff, for 150 fuelbed types defined for the continental U.S. 
are quantified. The system calculates available fuel potential index between 0  9 for 
each FCCS National or customized fuelbed and provides available consumption 
of fuels. The fire emissions production simulator (FEPS) is developed to calculate 
fuel consumption efficiency (PNW, 2005). The FEPS model is run for each of the 
NFDRS fuel models and for each of the six fuel moisture classes in the model. For 
each of these combinations the model is used to estimate a unique fuel consumption. 
Fire emissions can be simulated using modeling tools such as emission production 
model (EPM) (Sandberg et al., 1984), first order fire effects model (FOFEM) 
(Reinhardt et al., 1997), and community smoke emissions modeling (CSEM) (Barna 
and Fox, 2003). In the recently upgraded version of EPM, FEPS (Anderson et al., 
2004), fuel loading, fuel moisture, meteorological conditions, and other parameters 
are used to obtain hourly fire emissions as well fuel consumption, heat release 
and plume rise. CSEM, specifically designed to provide historical fire emission 
estimates for use in air quality models, uses consume and EPM and national GIS 
coverage for developing a fire inventory, locations, time and size.  
A comprehensive modeling tool, BlueSky (O’Neill et al., 2003), was developed 
as a framework for fire emission and air quality effect simulation and prediction. 
Regional forecast of smoke concentrations is made using burn information from state 
and federal agency burn reporting systems, and meteorology, fuel consumption, 
emission, and dispersion and trajectory models. The southern high-resolution 
modeling consortium southern smoke simulation system (SHRMC-4S) (Achtemeier 
et al., 2003) is similar to bluesky but more specifically for prescribed burning in the 
south. It uses the sparse matrix operator kernel emissions modeling system (SMOKE) 
(Houyoux et al., 2002) for processing emission data and providing initial and 
boundary chemical conditions, and the community multiscale air quality (CMAQ) 
(Byun and Ching, 1999) model for chemical modeling. A unique feature with 
SHRMC-4S is that it includes a dynamical model (daysmoke) (Achtemeier, 1998) 
to calcualte smoke plume rise. Figure 9.3 shows a simulation result of SHRMC-4S. 
9.2.4 Remote Sensing 
Satellite remote sensing (RS) has emerged as a useful technique for fire detection 
in the past decade. With the unique features of global coverage, high-resolution,

Figure 9.3 Time-height section of PM2.5 concentration (g·m-3) from prescribed 
fire emissions in Florida simulated with SHRMC-4S. The horizontal and vertical 
coordinates represent hour (local time) and height in level (from Liu et al., 2006) 
and continuous operation, RS is able to obtain detailed information of fuel type 
and loading, fire occurrence, extent, structure, and temporal variation (Riebau and 
Qu, 2004; Qu et al., 2003 and 2005). Satellite instruments such as the advanced 
very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) (Kaufman et al., 1990; Justice et al., 1996; 
Li et al., 1997; Burgan et al., 1998), the geostationary operational environmental 
satellite (GOES) (Prins and Menzel, 1990), and the moderate resolution imaging 
spectroradiometer (MODIS) (Kaufman et al., 1998; Justice et al., 2002) have been 
applied to field experiments and routine monitoring of fuels and wildfires.  
AVHRR has daily data over two decades. Algorithms for detecting active fires 
and mapping burned area (Fraser et al., 2000) have been developed and validated 
for the fires in North America (Li et al., 2003). With more spectral bands and higher 
spatial resolution, MODIS measurements can be used to retrieve fire information 
more accurately (Kaufman et al., 2003). The MODIS rapid response system (MRRS) 
was recently developed to provide rapid access to MODIS data globally with 
initial emphasis on 250 m color composite imagery and active fire data. MODIS 
was found to be able to detect small and cool fires in the South more robustly and 
accurately (Wang et al., 2005). The Hazard Mapping System (HMS) (NOAA, 2006) 
was developed to manually integrate data from various automated fire detection 
algorithms with GOES, AVHRR, MODIS and defense meteorological satellite 
program/operational linescan system (DMSP/OLS) images. It produces a quality 
controlled display of the locations of fires and significant smoke plumes detected 
by meteorological satellites for air quality forecast. Figure 9.4 shows an example 
of MODIS detection of wildland fires.

2003 (from Quayle et al., 2003) 
In spite of not being a parameter in the formula for fire emissions, fuel moisture 
is an important property for estimating fuel consumption and fire emissions. Forest 
fuel consists of live and dead vegetation. Meteorological measurements are 
traditionally used to estimate fuel moisture. The NFDRS monitors fuel moisture 
of live vegetation for shrub ecosystem using the normalized difference vegetation 
index (NDVI) and calculates dead fuel moisture with air temperature, humidity, and 
cloudiness. The Canadian forest fire danger rating system (CFFDRS) calculates live 
and dead fuel moisture using various algorithms basically based on meteorological 
measurements. The limitations with the traditional technique include relatively 
small spatial resolution of observations, unavailability over part of forest regions, 
and uncertainties in the relationship between meteorological data and fuel moisture. 
RS technique has been demonstrated as an efficient means to supplement field 
measurements for monitoring live fuel moisture, especially in locations not 
readily accessible by forest rangers. In addition to covering extensive regions, RS 
also provides values closely related to forest vegetation status such as NDVI and 
Surface Temperature. Thus, RS data can be directly used to estimate fuel moisture 
(Chuvieco et al., 1999).  
9.3 U.S. Fire Emissions  
9.3.1 Parameter Specifications  
This section describes a calculation of the U.S. fire emissions. The BLM fire dataset 
(BLM, 2003) is used. The data used are monthly total acres burned by wildfires 

9 Estimates of Wildland Fire Emissions

for each of the 48 contiguous states during 1980  2002. The areas burned by 
wildfires were about 41,000 acres per year averaged over the contiguous U.S. 
states (Fig. 9.1). Large emissions occurred in the Western states. Idaho, California, 
Nevada, Oregon, Montana and Utah had burning areas over hundreds of thousands 
of acres. Florida was the only state in the East with the emission reaching the 
national average. A detailed description of the fire statistics is given in Liu (2004). 
Emission factors are adopted from Table 9.1. Fuel loading factors are adopted 
from the values for RS approach in Table 9.2. 
9.3.2 Spatial Distribution  
Figure 9.5 shows geographic distribution of PM2.5 emissions from wildfires 
expressed as emission intensity (kg·km–2). Large emissions are found in the West. 
 
Figure 9.5 Spatial distribution of annual wildfire emissions of PM2.5 (kg·km–2)   
(a) and standard deviation (b)

Two centers with a magnitude of over 40 kg·km–2 are located in Pacific South and 
Pacific North, respectively. Emissions gradually decrease to below 10 kg·km–2 
east of the Rocky Mountains. Emissions, however, have a center in Florida with a 
magnitude of about 35 kg·km–2. Emissions decrease rapidly to less than 10 kg·km–2 
in the surrounding states. Standard deviation of annual emission series has the same 
magnitude as the average in most states, indicating large inter-annual variability. 
As shown in Liu (2004), wildfire emissions are characterized by a number of 
strong emission events and a relatively quiet episode up to a decade long between 
two strong emission events. 
9.3.3 Seasonal Distribution  
Figure 9.6 shows total annual emissions of PM2.5 of each state and each season. In 
the West, California, Idaho and Oregon have the emissions around 15,000 tons, a 
majority of which is during summer. In the East, Florida has the emissions over 5,000 
tons. Different from the West, a substantial portion of wildfire emissions in Florida 
and many other southern states occurs during spring, when the weather is warming 
up but not very moist yet. The emissions of PM10, VOC and NOx are roughly com- 
parable to those of PM2.5, while the emissions of other components are significantly 
different. CO and CO2 are about one and two orders larger, respectively, while SO2 is 
about two orders smaller. They reflect the differences in the AP-42 emission factors.

RS approach are smaller in the west and larger in Florida than those from the 
AP-42 Table approach. A quantitative comparison is shown in Fig. 9.7 using the 
ratio of the difference in emission between the RS and AP-42 Table approaches 
to emission from the AP-42 Table approach. Remarkable changes ranging from 
–100%̚450% are obtained. The changes display certain geographic patterns. 
The RS approach leads to overall reduced emissions in the regions from the 
Pacific coast to Midwest except Southwest. In contrast, overall increased 
emissions are found in Southeast and Northeast. The largest increase of 200% or 
more is found in a number of New England states due to the extremely small

amounts of emission in these states. Among the states with large emissions, the 
most significant changes happens in Oregon and Florida, where emissions are 
reduced by about 80% and increased by about 160%, respectively. Changes in 
California and Idaho are less than 20% in magnitude. 
Besides wildfires, fuel loading factors for prescribed burning have also been 
developed using satellite remote sensed fuel types and loading and consumption 
of individual fuel types (EPA, 2003b). In Florida, a state with the most extensive 
prescribed burning in the nation, for example, fuel loading factor is increased 
from 9 ton/acre in the AP-42 Table to 19.7 ton/acre estimated by the RS approach 
for wildfire, comparing from 7.1  17.2 ton/acre for prescribed burning. 
Most fire emission inventories, including fire emissions in the EPA NEIs, have 
been developed using the AP-42 Table default fuel loading factors. The remarkable 
changes in the magnitude of fire emissions between this approach and RS 
approach, including in some states with large fire emissions such as Oregon  
and Florida, suggest a large uncertainty in estimating fire emissions in these 
inventories. The result that the fire emissions are reduced in most Westerns states 
and increased in most Eastern states with RS approach than the AP-42 approach 
would lead to a reduced geographic contrast between the two regions. Especially, 
it suggests larger importance of prescribed burning for air quality and other 
smoke-related environmental issues in the Southeast, which is a major region of 
such burning.  
The changes in fire emission estimates can have some important implications for 
the environmental effects of wildland fires. A recent modeling study using CMAQ 
model (Byun and Ching, 1999) with fire emissions estimated using the AP-42 Table 
fuel loading factors indicated significant impacts of Florida prescribed burning on 
regional air quality (Liu et al., 2004). The impacts could more serious considering 
that emissions are about 1.6 times larger if using the RS approach. In addition, a 
simulation study with a regional climate model indicated the role of wildfires in 
enhancing drought with emissions estimated using the AP-42 Table fuel loading 
factors (Liu, 2005b). A better understanding of the role could be achieved by 
using the RS approach for fuel loading factors.  
9.5 Summary and Perspective 
Fire emissions are determined by area burned, consumption efficiency, fuel loading, 
and emission factor. The ground measurement and recording systems have been 
traditionally used to obtain burned area and fuel loading information. Satellite RS, 
a new technique developed rapidly in the past decade, is able to provide high- 
resolution fire and fuel properties. Actual fuel consumption and fire emissions 
can be determined using modeling and empirical relations.  
The U.S. fire emissions estimated using the fuel loading factors recently developed 

9 Estimates of Wildland Fire Emissions 
129
based on satellite RS and ground measurements are found large in Pacific South 
and Pacific North. A majority of fire emissions occur during summer. In addition, 
there is an emission center in Florida, which is the largest during spring. There 
are significant differences in wildfire emissions between the RS and AP-42 Table 
approaches for fuel loading factors. In general, fire emissions are reduced in the 
Western U.S. except the Southwest, and increased in the Eastern coastal regions 
by using the RS approach. The magnitude is up to about 80% in the major Western 
emission regions and 160 % in the Eastern ones.  
It appears that the RS approach is able to detect high resolution properties of 
fuel type and consumption and therefore is useful for understanding more spatial 
details of wildfire emissions. The EPA Regional Planning Organizations, for 
example, has recently decided to re-calculate wildfire emissions in the 2002 NEI 
using the RS approach (WRAP, 2005).  
The following studies in the future are critical to improving our understanding 
of fire emissions and their environmental effects: 
(1) Wildfire data is a key to analyzing fire regimes and the spatial and temporal 
variability. Continuous efforts are needed to develop historical datasets, and improve 
the capacity to obtain real or near real time fire information. Some existing datasets 
such as the one developed by BLM (2003) only include burns occurred on the 
federal lands, while those of state and private lands and Department of Defense 
lands, which together contribute to a substantial portion of the acres burned in the 
South. Expansions to these datasets will make them more valuable. 
(2) The lack in systematic prescribed burning information, especially real time 
burning information, has been one of the major limitations in estimating fire 
emissions and environmental consequences. The efforts in developing automated 
reporting systems will provide a capacity in obtaining such information.  
(3) More and more RS applications are expected for fire and fuel detection. 
Further algorithm development and evaluation are needed to solve some technical 
issues such as false fire signals and cloud interference. The development of the 
capacity in detecting prescribed fires is of great value. So is the capacity in measuring 
atmospheric concentrations of fire emissions.  
(4) Fuel and fire properties are under constant disturbances from natural processes. 
Hurricanes, for example, can increase dead fuel loading, which in turn increases 
wildfire risks. More studies are needed to understand fuel and fire variations in 
response to environmental forcing.  
(5) Decision making support systems are a useful tool for fire and land managers 
to understand and predict the effects of fire emissions on air quality, radiation, 
climate, the carbon cycle, and other environmental processes, and to plan and 
implement plans to migrate possible diverse consequences. Bridging between 
measurements and monitoring techniques (e.g., satellite RS) and modeling 
techniques (e.g., fuel, climate, ecosystem, and air quality models) is critical for 
the development of the systems.

Abstract The US national fire danger rating system (NFDRS) generates daily 
estimates of fire potential throughout the United States. A key component of 
this system is the condition of live vegetation. Currently, there are no 
objective methods for determining vegetation condition. Inter-annual climatic 
variability causes the onset of spring green-up and fall leaf senescence to 
vary substantially from year-to-year. Therefore, methods used to assess live 
vegetation condition must be robust to these climatic changes. We present a 
system designed to integrate both remote sensing and surface weather-derived 
metrics of foliar greenness. This system provides two independent metrics 
that are meaningful representations of landscape level greenness responses and 
are suitable for use in verifying NFDRS greenup dates and greenness factors. 
Keywords Phenology, fire danger rating, green-up dates, greenness factors, 
NDVI 
10.1 Introduction 
Foliar phenology significantly influences the exchange of mass, energy and 
momentum between the Earth’s surface and its atmosphere. Canopy timing and 
duration constrain annual plant productivity and alter global seasonal cycles of 
atmospheric CO2 (Keeling et al., 1996). Plant canopies lose water to the atmosphere 
through transpiration. Leaf area alters the boundary layer and changes the coupling 
between the land surface and the atmosphere. As such, we see many connections 
between plant foliar dynamics, the global carbon cycle and the global water cycle. 
Understanding plant phenology is a requisite for a proper understanding of these 
cycles.  
Many methods exist to characterize vegetation foliar phenology across the 
landscape. Mathematical models driven by both satellite data and / or surface 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
136 
weather data are common tools for assessing seasonal changes in phenology 
(Schwartz, 1999). Although these tools are useful, there has never been an integrated 
system that publicly offers multiple resources for the assessment of seasonal 
changes in leaf cover. Such a system would be useful to a variety of disciplines 
including fire managers who need live vegetation conditions to initialize the live 
fuel moisture model of the US national fire danger rating system (NFDRS). 
NFDRS is used to make fire danger assessments across the United States and is 
the foundations for many wildland fire management decisions. There are currently 
two operational versions of NFDRS and each version requires different information 
about the condition of live vegetation. The 1978 version of NFDRS requires  
the bud break or green-up date (Deeming et al., 1977) while the 1988 revision  
to NFDRS added greenness factors which are required daily inputs to NFDRS 
and are used to express the seasonal greenup and curing rates of live vegetation 
(Burgan, 1988).  
Currently, there are no mechanistic models that can be used to derive both 
greenup dates and greenness factors from prevailing weather data. Thus, there are 
no means to examine historical fire potential or to project the fire danger under 
changing climates. Such a model and the means to estimate it operationally would 
benefit land managers by providing standardized estimates of vegetation greenness 
conditions across the entire country. Here we present a phenology monitoring 
system that combines satellite and surface derived phenology proxies into a simple, 
automated system. The system assesses phenology across the continental United 
States and Alaska. It is the first of its kind to provide multiple phenology proxies in 
near real-time to the general public. The system combines data from point-source 
surface weather data and satellite-derived vegetation indices from the advanced 
very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR). Surface weather data are interpolated 
and used to drive a generalized foliar phenology model which provides estimates 
of phenology that are interdependent of the satellite-derived metrics. The model 
combines temperature, water and light constraints into one simple daily metric 
that can be continually assessed across large regions. The web-based system 
provides both spatial and temporal phenological metrics across the landscape. This 
phenology monitoring system will be integrated into the wildland fire assessment 
system (WFAS) to provide fire managers with quick access to live fuel conditions 
(http://www.wfas.net) (Jolly et al., 2005a). 
10.2 Methods  
10.2.1 System Introduction  
The phenology monitoring system is composed of two components: the surface 
weather-based phenology model and the satellite-derived vegetation indices. 
www.ebook3000.com

137
These two sources provide independent assessments of phenology spatially.  
10.2.2 Surface Weather-Based Phenology Monitoring System 
10.2.2.1 Surface Observations Gridding System (SOGS) 
This system uses station weather data from multiple obtained automatically from 
multiple sources to create surfaces of weather variables using the methods described 
by Jolly et al., (2005b). This system automatically retrieves, stores, and interpolates 
surface weather observations to create spatially continuous estimates of key 
meteorological data fields across a region of interest. Interpolation grids are 
user-defined and can be generated at any spatial resolution. This system is used 
to generate daily gridded weather data for minimum temperature, vapor pressure 
deficit and daylength which are provide spatial inputs to a generalized phenology 
model to estimate greenness conditions of live vegetation across the landscape. 
The system is configured to make use of multiple mathematical interpolators. For 
this operational system we chose to use the Truncated Gaussian Filter because it 
is efficiently calculated and results were similar to other more complicated 
interpolation schemes (Jolly et al., 2005b).  
10.2.2.2 Growing Season Index (GSI)  
These interpolated weather grids are then used to spatially estimate the GSI, a 
relative index of the bioclimatic constraints on plant functioning (Jolly et al., 
2005c). This index relates well to plant foliar phenology and can be estimated 
daily from available surface weather data. The index is calculated as the product of 
three indicators which express the relative constraints of temperature, evaporative 
demand/water availability and light on plant functioning. The index uses indicator 
functions of three weather variables as good surrogates for each of these three 
constraints: minimum temperature, vapor pressure deficit and photoperiod. Each 
of these variables is assumed to have a value where below which it completely 
limits plant functioning (1) and a value where above which it does not constrain 
plant function (2). The upper and lower limits of the indicator functions for each 
of these three variables are shown in Table 10.1. The GSI is calculated as the 
product of these three daily indicator functions.

These daily data provide two potential sources of information to land managers 
for use with both the 1978 version and the 1988 revisions of the NFDRS. First, the 
time series can be monitored in the spring or throughout the year to approximate a 
green-up condition. When the index value exceeds a pre-defined threshold, green-up 
can be declared and the users can make the appropriate entry into NFDRS. This 
threshold method has been evaluated at a long-term research site and does well at 
detecting inter-annual difference in green-up dates (Jolly et al., 2005c). GSI is 
unique for this application because it is a continuous measure of greenness. This 
means that it can predict multiple green-up and curing events within the same year. 
Therefore, it can be monitored continuously throughout the season to understand 
how bioclimatic limitations are likely affecting vegetation vigor across the landscape 
for an area of interest. In addition to estimating a green-up date for the 1978 version 
of NFDRS, GSI can provide estimated greenness factors for the 1988 NFDRS 
revision. Greenness factors vary as whole numbers from zero to twenty. They are 
meant to express greenup and curing of live vegetation in a relative context 
where zero is completely cured and twenty is completely green (Burgan, 1988). 
GSI is an identical metric but it is scaled continuously from 0  1 and requires the 
definition of a simple threshold value of greenup. GSI can thus be used to calculate 
greenness factors by a simple linear transformation as follows:

Where GF88t is the greenness factor for the 1988 version of NFDRS at time t and 
GSIt is the GSI at time t and assuming a GSI greenup threshold of 0.5 (Jolly et al., 
2005b). Greenness factors are rounded to the nearest whole number. 
10.3 Satellite-Derived Vegetation Index Data  
10.3.1 AVHRR Normalized Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI)  
Weekly AVHRR NDVI data are obtained from the wildland fire assessment system 
(WFAS) (Jolly et al., 2005a). These data are produced operationally each week 
by the USGS at NC EROS and they are used to calculate two products that are 
commonly used by fire managers to assess the condition of live vegetation: relative 
greenness and departure from average greenness (Burgan and Hartford, 1993; 
Burgan et al., 1996). Although these products are useful in providing spatial 
assessments of vegetation across the landscape, to date there has been no system 
to extract time-series data from the raster images for points. This hinders their

utility because fire management decisions are often based on data derived from 
point-sources such as remote automated weather stations.  
10.3.2 Point Retrieval Interface  
PhenMon provides two separate point retrieval interfaces. The first point retrieval 
interface provides time-series of GSI for any point within either of the two 
regions of interest. This interface provides land managers with a tool to assess 
both the current and short-term changes in greenness at a given location such as 
an NFDRS station. The second point retrieval interface provides time-series data 
for AVHRR NDVI. This point summary includes the historical minimum and 
maximum NDVI value, the historical mean for the current period and the current 
NDVI value in addition to time series plots of the last year’s data along with the 
mean. Both interfaces provide options for either data values served as text or 
time-series plots of data for the entire period of record.  
The interface is built around a raster extraction tool written using the USGS 
general cartographic transformation package (GCTP: ftp://edcftp.cr.usgs.gov/pub/ 
software/gctpc/). This tool extracts a given value from a projected raster based on 
geographic coordinates. The tool can extract either the coincident pixel value from 
a raster or the values from a user-defined window around the point. 
10.3.3 PhenMon: The Phenology Monitoring System  
PhenMon uses the interpolated surface weather data from SOGS to run GSI across 
the regions of interest. A system flow diagram is shown in Fig. 10.1. SOGS is run 
daily using weather data from the remote automated weather stations (RAWS) and  
the temperature and precipitation summary from the climate prediction center. 
SOGS interpolates these data at an eight kilometer resolution for two regions: the 
continental United States and Alaska. These interpolated data are used as inputs to 
GSI in addition to the previous twenty days of data. Daily GSI rasters are produced 
as the 21 day average of daily GSI values (Jolly et al., 2005c). Images suitable for 
display on the world wide web are created by a custom image generator and the 
data rasters are archived for use in the point retrieval interface. The system also 
automatically retrieves the most current AVHRR NDVI data for the continental 
United States and stores these data in an archive to provide access to data for at 
least the past year. In addition to these real-time data sources, the system also 
maintains rasters of long-term weekly mean NDVI as well as the historical minimum 
and maximum values for each pixel.

10.4 Results and Discussion  
10.4.1 Surface Observations Gridding System 
Example images of interpolated surface weather data from SOGS for both the 
continental United States and Alaska are show in Fig. 10.2. These surfaces of 
minimum temperature and vapor pressure deficit are generated daily. Photoperiod 
(daylength) is also calculated each day as a function of site latitude and julian day. 
These rasters are used as inputs to calculate the GSI. The accuracy of this method 
has been verified in a previous study. In general, minimum temperature predictions 
are accurate to within ~2.0ć and vapor pressure deficit is accurate to within 
approximately 168 pascals (Jolly et al., 2005b).  
10.4.2 Growing Season Index 
GSI data are produced daily using the interpolated weather data from SOGS for 
both the continental United States and Alaska. Example spatial images for each 
region are shown in Fig. 10.3. An example time-series plot derived from the 
point retrieval tool is shown in Fig. 10.4.

10.4.3 AVHRR NDVI Data 
An example image of the weekly NDVI data is shown in Fig. 10.5. These images 
are generated each week by the EROS Data Center of the USGS as part of the 
wildland fire assessment system (WFAS). PhenMon retrieves these images and 
stores them in the archive for use in the point retrieval tool. Graphic images of the 
rasters are not produced to avoid duplication of processing already being done by 
WFAS. An example time series of NDVI along with the long-term weekly mean 
values and the GSI for the same point is shown in Fig. 10.4. We see good agreement 
between the satellite derived and the surface weather-derived metrics of greenness 
for the same location. In a previous study, the GSI has been compared more 
extensively to NDVI for different vegetation types throughout the world (Jolly et 
al., 2005c). In addition to the standard point retrieval interface which plots the 
time-series or provides access to the data via a text output, there is also another 
feature which allows the users to view the most current NDVI for a given point. 
This value is also expressed as a function of the historical range of variability for

These data are produced weekly by the EROS data center as part of the wildland 
fire assessment system (WFAS) (Jolly et al., 2005a). White areas show regions with

that point as both relative greenness and departure from average greenness (Burgan 
and Hartford, 1993; Burgan et al., 1996). This interface can be used for a quick 
summary around an NFDRS weather station to verify green-up conditions predicted 
using GSI. NDVI data can be used to provide estimates of greenup dates by 
comparing the current NDVI value to the long-term mean. Greenup can be declared 
when NDVI exceeds half its seasonal maximum or relative greenness exceeds 
50% (White et al., 1997). 
10.4.4 General Discussion  
This is the first system to its kind to integrate RS and surface weather-derived 
metrics of canopy greenness into a single, simple interface suitable for use by the 
general public. The tool is unique because it provides point-wise access to two 
independent metrics of canopy foliar phenology. This system is not intended to 
replace field observations but rather to supplement those observations with resources 
that are standardized across different geographic areas. Greenup conditions are 
somewhat arbitrary when observed from the field because different species and even 
similar species within different canopy positions do not green-up at the same time 
(Gill et al., 1998; Sawada et al., 1999; Augspurger and Bartlett, 2003). Both GSI 
and NDVI represent the areal-average greenness conditions rather than the green-up 
dates of a single species in time. Land managers can then use these data to verify 
observations prior to “greening up” a fire danger rating station.  
It is important to note that RS data alone cannot meet the needs of land managers. 
Passive RS requires temporal compositing to remove the effects of clouds and 
aerosols that are present in daily images (Holben, 1986). Temporal aggregation 
reduces this impact but also limits their applicability to systems that require more 
timely data. The weekly composite period NDVI data that are used in WFAS and 
integrated into PhenMon are some of the timeliest RS data available. More advanced 
sensors commonly use longer composite periods which result in longer delays for 
data delivery. For example, vegetation index data for MODIS use sixteen day 
composites (Huete et al., 2002). These data are rarely available even as much as a 
week after the end of the composite period due to the intensive processing and 
quality control that the data undergo prior to public distribution.  
Land managers are not concerned with state values at a given time, they are more 
concerned with the state transitions of vegetation over time such as the greening 
up of vegetation in spring or the drying (curing) of vegetation in the summer  
and the leaf senescence in the fall. These represent rates of change rather than 
snapshots in time. RS can be used examine these states transitions but this means 
that at a minimum, users must look at two composite periods to see where NDVI 
has changed greatly. In reality, it often takes three or four composite periods to 
adequately depict the change due to problems such as cloud contamination that are 
present in the weekly images. Studies thus often use running averages of several

composite periods before attempting to examine state transitions (Jolly and Running, 
2004). This significantly hinders the utility of satellite data as the sole resource for 
determining greenness conditions especially when greenness can change rapidly 
with the season, especially in vegetation with shallow roots.  
In summary, this system is the first of its kind to integrate RS and surface 
weather-based models into a simple, user friendly interface that is suitable for use 
by land managers to remotely determine greenness conditions across the landscape. 
It provides estimates of both greenup dates and greenness factors for both versions 
of NFDRS that are currently in operation. Although satellite data themselves do not 
solely meet the needs of land managers, they do provide independent verification 
of greenness conditions that are estimated from methods with higher temporal 
resolution. This system will be useful in standardizing greenness assessment 
throughout the United States.

Abstract The US national fire danger rating System (NFDRS) generates 
daily estimates of fire potential throughout the United States. A key com- 
ponent of this system is the condition of live vegetation. Currently, there are no 
objective methods for determining vegetation condition. Inter-annual climatic 
variability causes the onset of spring green-up and fall leaf senescence to vary 
substantially from year-to-year. Therefore, methods used to assess live vegetation 
condition must be robust to these climatic changes. We present a system 
designed to integrate both remote sensing and surface weather-derived 
metrics of foliar greenness. This system provides two independent metrics 
that are meaningful representations of landscape level greenness responses and 
are suitable for use in verifying NFDRS greenup dates and greenness factors.

11.1 Introduction 
With more and more people moving into the wildland urban interface, wildfires 
have become an increasing concern for the National Park Service and other 
land-management agencies. According to the National Interagency Fire Center, 
almost 7 million acres and over 1,000 structures burned in 2004 (National 
Interagency Fire Center, 2005). This is nearly a 2-million-acre increase over the 
previous 10-year average and it came with an estimated $890-million-dollar 
fire-suppression price tag. These increases have generated expanded interest 
among fire managers and scientists developing more robust fire-behavior models. 
Key to the performance of these models is an accurate depiction of the spatial 
arrangement of fire fuel loads. 
Current fire-behavior models (e.g., FARSITE) rely heavily on National Fire 
Fuel Laboratory (NFFL) fuel-classification procedures. These procedures, in turn,

are based on litter (downed woody material), vegetation type, and overall vegetation 
structure (Anderson, 1982). Previous work in two national parks (Booker T. 
Washington National Monument and George Washington National Monument) 
found that there was a one-to-one relationship between vegetation type and NFFL 
fuel models for Mid-Atlantic Eastern United States forests (Devine, et al., 2003). 
This chapter expands those findings by further exploring this vegetation type-fuel 
model relationship in eight additional Northeastern national parks from East central 
Maine to SOUTH central Virginia. The national parks are listed below: 
(1) Acadia National Park 
(2) Appomattox Court House National Historical Park 
(3) Colonial National Historical Park 
(4) Fire Island National Seashore 
(5) Fredericksburg and Spotsylvania County Battlefields Memorial National 
Military Park 
(6) Petersburg National Battlefield 
(7) Richmond National Battlefield Park 
(8) Thomas Stone National Historic Site 
This chapter focuses on the development of a comprehensive database that 
could be used to crosswalk formation-level vegetation maps to NFFL fuel-model 
maps. The process involved developing digital aerial photograph mosaics and 
using three-dimensional GIS procedures to combine these mosaics with vegetation 
information. This was followed by the development of techniques to produce 
complacent and available live fire-fuel-load maps. This chapter is divided into 
three sections describing the methods and results of the digital orthophoto mosaic 
production, the formation-level vegetation databases, and the fire fuel mapping. 
11.2 Digital Orthophoto Mosaics 
For this research we created digital orthophoto mosaics from color infrared, stereo 
pair 1:6,000-scale aerial photography with airborne global positioning system 
(GPS) and inertial mapping unit (IMU) data for eight national parks in the NPS 
Northeast Region. In the first step, the air photos were scanned at 600 dpi with 
24-bit color depth on flatbed 11-x-17 scanners with transparency adapters. We found 
that these scanner settings resulted in manageable file sizes while maintaining a 
high level of detail.  
During this multi-year research project we refined and improved our procedures. 
The final methodology included five basic steps: 
(1) We imported scanned images of the air photos in tiff format to ERDAS’ 
Imagine (.img) format (Erdas, 2004). 
(2) We created a photo block in Leica’s Photogrammetry Suite (LPS), using 
airborne GPS and IMU data and a digital elevation model from the United States 
Geological Survey (USGS, NED) (Leica, 2004).

National Park Service

(3) We triangulated each mosaic photo block with a root mean square error 
(RMSE) of less than 1. We then generated single frame orthophotos (one for each 
air photo) within Imagine. 
(4) We exported the single frame orthophotos to Imagine .lan format and then 
imported the .lan files into ER Mapper’s native (.ers) format (ER Mapper, 2004). 
An ER Mapper algorithm was created for color balancing, manual cutline creation, 
and final mosaicking. 
(5) In ER Mapper we generated a band interleaved by line (.bil) image and 
header file for the final orthophoto mosaic. We imported the .bil image into 
Imagine .img format and compressed the .img image using MrSid software with 
a 20:1 target compression ratio (Lizardtech, 2001). 
Figures 11.1 and 11.2 illustrate the visual improvements obtained with our 
final methodology using ER mapper for cutlines and color balancing. Figure 11.1 
shows the Green Springs area of Colonial National Park. The left half of the 
image is the original mosaic and the right half shows the recreated mosaic. In the 
newer mosaic on the right, the red tint is substantially reduced, photo seamlines 
are nearly invisible, and the overall color balancing is much improved.  
 
Figure 11.1 Imagine screenshot of initial (left half of image) and final (right half 
of image) mosaics of the Green Springs area of Colonial National Park 
Figure 11.2 shows mosaics of the five forks area of Petersburg National Battlefield 
that illustrate similar improvements to those shown in Fig. 11.1. The mosaic created 
with the newer methodology using ER Mapper has better overall color balance, 
less noticeable seam lines, and less pronounced red tint. 
The horizontal positional accuracy of each mosaic was then assessed following 
guidelines of the NBS/NPS vegetation mapping program (ESRI, NCGIA, and

Figure 11.2 Initial and final mosaics of the five forks area of Petersburg National 
Battlefield 
TNC, 1994). At least 20 well-defined positional accuracy ground control points 
were placed throughout all quadrants of the mosaic in ArcMap. Ground control 
points and zoomed in screenshots of each point were plotted on hard copy maps 
with the mosaic as a background. These maps and plots were used to locate the 
ground points in the field. For each ground-control point, field staff noted any 
alterations to the locations in the field and then recorded the coordinates with   
a Trimble Pro XR/XRS or GeoXT. Mapped ground-control points that were 
physically inaccessible were also noted. The coordinate data were collected with 
real-time GPS and post processed with differential correction using Trimble’s 
Pathfinder Office software (Trimble, 2004). 
Before positional accuracy was calculated, we excluded ground-control points 
identified by SAS’s JMP program as outliers (SAS, 2004). Following USGS/NPS 
vegetation mapping guidelines, no more than 10 percent of the ground control 
points for any one mosaic were excluded. We then entered the field-collected GPS 
coordinates and the coordinates obtained from the mosaic viewed in ArcMap into 
a spreadsheet designed to calculate horizontal positional accuracy (in meters). 
At the beginning of this project, the accepted method of calculating horizontal 
positional accuracy was based on Euclidean distance. Subsequently, a method 
based on root mean square error became the accepted procedure for assessing 
horizontal positional accuracy (FGDC, 1998b; Minnesota Governor’s Council on 
Geographic Information and Minnesota Land Management Information Center, 
1999). A positional accuracy handbook and a copy of the spreadsheet that contains 
the RMSE accuracy calculation formulas (horizontal.xls) can be downloaded 
from the Minnesota Department of Administration, Office of Geographic and 
Demographic analysis website (Minnesota Dept. of Administration, 2005).

and a fall/leaf-on mosaic.

ranged from 0.815  1.580 meters. Thirteen of the 15 mosaics meet the class 1 
national map accuracy standard (NMAS) of 1.5 meters or better for 1:6,000-scale 
photography and the other two mosaics failed to meet that standard by only 0.08 
and 0.04 meters. 
11.3 Formation-Level Vegetation Databases 
The USGS and the NPS have standardized on the use of the hierarchal national 
vegetation classification system (NVCS) (FGDC, 1997) for their national vegetation 
characterization program. The formation-level is the lowest of the five physiognomic 
levels in the NVCS and it identifies ecological groupings of vegetation units with 
similar broadly defined environmental and physiognomic factors.  
We created formation-level vegetation databases by interpreting the digital 
orthophoto mosaics for each park to delineate vegetation polygons to the formation- 
level defined in the NVCS. Table 11.1 displays the basic hierarchy of the system 
as well as some class examples.

Formation-level vegetation databases were created within ESRI’s ArcMap using 
the orthophoto mosaics (both leaf-off and leaf-on, when available) as basemaps 
(ESRI). Photo interpreters viewing the mosaic(s) in two-dimensions delineated 
visible areas of homogeneous vegetation (i.e., vegetation polygons) using ArcMap’s 
onscreen digitizing tools. Although the minimum mapping unit was 0.5 hectare, 
the photo interpreters were usually able to delineate polygons as small as 0.5 acre. 
After vegetation polygons were delineated for the entire park area, the photo 
interpreters created and populated three fields in the attribute table, entering a 
unique polygon identification number, the formation-level vegetation class code, 

 
Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
152 
and notes when they were unsure of the appropriate vegetation class code or could 
not assign a code. The photo interpreters relied on their experience to attribute 
the proper vegetation class. In some cases, digital raster graphics and existing 
spatial vegetation data were used to supplement the photo interpreters vegetation 
classification. The photo interpreters then examined each polygon in three- 
dimensions using Leica’s Stereo Analyst software to verify the formation-level 
vegetation class code entered in the attribute table, and they entered a new or 
corrected code if appropriate (Leica, Stereo Analyst, 2003). Delineating the 
vegetation polygons in three dimensions is very time consuming. After considerable 
testing, the methodology was finalized to delineate in two-dimensions and perform 
validation and accuracy checks in three dimensions. This greatly increased pro- 
ductivity while conserving accuracy over a strictly three-dimensional approach. 
The final formation-level vegetation databases are archived in ESRI shapefile and 
geodatabase formats. 
Sample field data were collected to assess the thematic accuracy of the 
formation-level vegetation databases at Booker T. Washington National Monument 
and George Washington National Monument.1 These two databases were made 
up of 68 and 262 vegetation polygons and the final estimated thematic accuracy 
was 97% and 83%, respectively, based on field accuracy assessment data collected 
at 64 of the 68 polygons in the first park and at 96 of the 262 polygons in the other. 
11.4 Fire Fuel Mapping 
After each vegetation database was completed, we collected fire fuel load data at 
each of the 10 parks. Within each park the data-collection points were stratified 
by vegetation type to ensure that data would be collected for vegetation types for 
which we had little or no previous fire fuel data. The number of data-collection 
points per park ranged from 4 to 101, depending on the size of the park. At each 
point field crews measured downed woody debris using a modified Brown’s transect 
line technique (Brown, 1974) developed by Shenandoah National Park (Carmichael 
and Cass, 2001) and an ocular estimation procedure (Burgan and Rothermel, 1984). 
Additional data that were collected include transect slope measurements, amounts 
of fine and coarse woody debris intersects, duff and litter depth measurements, 
canopy cover, average stand height, and height to live crown base (Smith, 2003). 
Sample forms used to record these data are included in Appendices A and B. On 
average, it took a two-person field crew 2 hours to take and record downed woody 
debris and Burgan/Rothermel measurements at each field location. Field plot 
photos were very helpful in crosswalking the vegetation to the fire fuel models. 
In future work we will take an additional field photo, looking up at the canopy, to 
help characterize canopy closure and crown bulk density.

11 Creating a Crosswalk of Vegetation Types and Fire Fuel Models for the  
National Park Service

Analysis of the fire fuel load data included comparing the field data to standard 
NFFL fire fuel model values following Brown’s procedures (1974). We found that 
fuel loads in the parks were consistently lower than fuel loads reported by Anderson 
(1982). This is undoubtedly because Anderson’s work is based exclusively on data 
from the western United States, where vegetation and forest characteristics are 
different from those in the Eastern states. Therefore, we worked closely with NPS 
personnel to crosswalk vegetation to fire fuel models based on their experience 
and Anderson’s narrative descriptions. 
We produced final fire fuel load databases by assigning complacent and available 
live fuel fire fuel model values to each vegetation polygon. Distinguishing between 
complacent and available live fuel conditions is important because fire behavior is 
affected by seasonal differences in vegetation. The available live fuel model 
represents the fall period when previously unavailable fuels are available due to 
seasonal curing and drying of vegetation. For example, many shrub fields are 
considered to be a barrier to fire spread until a critical live fuel moisture threshold 
is reached. Figure 11.3 shows a completed complacent fire fuel map for the 
Western Front Unit of Petersburg National Battlefield.

Battlefield 
11.5 Discussion 
As a result of this research, we have created a fairly comprehensive database of 
complacent and available fuel loads by vegetation type that could be used to

easily crosswalk formation-level vegetation from other areas to NFFL fuel models 
without the need for the time consuming fire fieldwork (Appendix C). We also 
have a large database of Brown’s and Burgan and Rothermel data that could be 
used to create custom fire fuel models for Eastern landscapes or, at the least, to 
generate numbers more useful in determining fire fuel models for national parks 
in the east. These data have become standard elements in the new fire behavior 
modeling program of the National Interagency Fire Center. 
Based on our experience, we strongly recommend collecting airborne GPS and 
IMU data with aerial photography that will be used to create digital orthophoto 
mosaics. Use of these data, as opposed to external reference sources such as USGS 
digital orthophoto quadrangles (DOQQs), for ground control substantially reduces 
the time required to create the mosaics and increases their positional accuracy.  
Table 11.2 compares the horizontal positional accuracy of four mosaics 
orthorectified with airborne GPS and IMU data with the positional accuracy of 
four mosaics orthorectified with DOQQs. The first four mosaics shown in Table 
11.2 were orthorectified with airborne GPS and IMU data that were collected at the 
time the photography was acquired. The other four mosaics were orthorectified using 
external reference sources such as DOQQs and hand selected ground control 
points. The externally referenced DOQQS have a much poorer average accuracy. 
Additionally, the use of airborne GPS and IMU data substantially decreases the time 
needed to create an orthophoto mosaic because there is no need to place manual tie 
points or manual ground control points. Finally, airborne GPS/IMU data have been 
essential for creating mosaics in areas with little or no development, which describes 
many of our National Parks. When using DOQQs or other external reference sources, 
we must find recognizable, accurate landmarks throughout the entire area for control. 
With largely forested and/or uninhabited areas, this is often very difficult, if not 
impossible. The use of airborne GPS and IMU data eliminates this issue.

Abstract This Chapter summarizes methodologies of detecting land fires 
from the TRMM/VIRS measurements. The TRMM science data and information 
system (TSDIS) fire products include global images of daily hot spots and 
monthly fire counts at 0.5e0.5e resolution, as well as text files that details 
necessary information of all fire pixels. These products have been archived 
since January 1, 1998. Diurnal and seasonal cycles of TRMM land fire products 
in the Eastern United States, Africa, as well as the South America and Asia, 
are discussed and compared to other satellite products. Statistical methods 
were applied to the TSDIS fire products as well as to the total ozone mapping 
spectrometer (TOMS) aerosol index products for a period of seven years 
from January 1998 to December 2004. The variability of global atmospheric 
aerosol is consistent with the fire variations during this period. The TRMM 
fire products were also compared to the coincident TRMM rainfall and other 
rainfall products to investigate the interaction between rainfall and fire. 
Keywords Land fires, diurnal and seasonal cycles, TRMM 
12.1 Introduction 
During the last several decades, satellite fire products have been playing an 
increasingly important role in the environment monitoring and predictions. The 
visible infrared spin scan radiometer and atmospheric sounder (VAS) on board 
the geosynchronous operational environmental satellites (GOES) has been used 
to monitor biomass burnings in many selected regions since 1980 (Dozier, 1981; 
Matson and Dozier, 1981). The GOES/VAS provides unique high temporal 
resolution products that are useful in determining the diurnal variations of intense 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires

fires. But the coarse spatial resolution (4  13.8 km at nadir) of the products can 
significantly affect the accuracy of locations and extents of the fire.  
The advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) of the national oceanic 
and atmospheric administrator (NOAA) satellite series has been able to provide 
fire monitoring at a higher spatial resolution (1.1 km at nadir) for various areas 
(Flannigan and Vonder Haar, 1986; Kaufman et al., 1990; Justice et al., 1996). 
Unfortunately, the full resolution AVHRR data (LAC) are only recorded for selected 
regions. The available daily AVHRR data is the reduced resolution Global Area 
Coverage (GAC) for which every third scan of the full resolution orbit data is 
processed and four out of every five pixels along the third scan are averaged. 
Therefore, the GAC has a resolution of 1.14.4 km at nadir with a 3 km gap 
between pixels across the scan. While the long history and global coverage of 
GAC data are very attractive for the study of seasonal cycle and interannual fire 
variability, the GAC re-sampling scheme would result in unreliable characterization 
as well as bias in the detection of fire. Since there is no long-term global GAC fire 
product readily available, substantial efforts may be needed to further analyze the 
quality of GAC fire.  
Pioneering studies based upon GOES/VAS and NOAAA/AVHRR data have 
provided scientific fundamentals on fire retrieving using remote sensed data. New 
network techniques have demonstrated the potential for providing real time and 
long term fire products using operational satellites. The satellite fire detection has 
been further advanced due to the recent launch of Terra and Aqua. The sophisticated 
MODIS is on board both Terra (EOS AM-1) and Aqua (EOS PM-1). The MODIS 
1 km 4 m high gain channel with a saturation level of 500 K is specifically 
designed to improve the fire detection (Kaufman and Justice 1998). MODIS data 
have been available since early 2000. The MODIS thermal anomalies product 
provides fire occurrence (day/night), fire location, the logical criteria used for the 
fire selection, and an energy calculation for each fire. The product also includes 
composite 8-day-and-night fire occurrence (full resolution), composite monthly 
day-and-night fire occurrence (full resolution), gridded 10 km summary per fire 
class (daily/8-day/monthly), and a gridded 0.5e summary of fire counts per class 
(daily/8-day/monthly). Further, the coincident fire observation from high resolution 
ASTER on board Terra can provide instantaneous validation for MODIS. It is 
expected that better global fire products may also emerge in the near future from 
the visible infrared imager radiometer suite (VIIRS) of national polar-Orbiting 
operational environmental satellite system (NPOESS) and the NPOESS preparatory 
project (NPP). Fire is one of the major parameters in both EOS and NPOESS 
missions. Other satellite sensors being used for fire detection include defense 
mapping satellite program (DMSP), Landsat Thematic Mapper, the advance 
along track scanning radiometer (AATSR) onboard the European Space Agency’s 
ENVISAT-1. 
While the main objective of tropical rainfall measuring mission (TRMM) is to 
improve observations and understanding of the tropical rainfall variability

(Kummerow et al., 1998), the visible infrared scanner (VIRS) on board the TRMM, 
one of the three primary TRMM sensors, is similar to the NOAA/AVHRR. The 
VIRS data are well calibrated and recorded at its full resolution (2.11 km at nadir, 
3.02 km at edge of scan) globally. Therefore, TRMM/VIRS provides the capability 
of producing a continuous global fire data set over tropics and subtropics. The 
local overpass time of TRMM satellite drift each day completing a daily cycle in 
46 days. This feature provides a good opportunity to derive mean diurnal cycles 
for land fires over tropics. However, a diurnal cycle aliasing may seriously affect 
the retrieval of seasonal and intra-seasonal variations. 
This Chapter summarizes methodologies of detecting land fires from the 
TRMM/VIRS measurements. The TRMM science data and information system 
(TSDIS) fire products include global images of daily hot spots and monthly   
fire counts at 0.5e0.5e resolution, as well as text files that details necessary 
information of all fire pixels. These products have been archived since January 
1998. Diurnal and seasonal cycles of TRMM land fire products in the Eastern United 
States, Africa, as well as the South America and Asia, are discussed and compared 
to other satellite products. Statistical methods were applied to the TSDIS fire 
products as well as to the total ozone mapping spectrometer (TOMS) aerosol 
index products for a period of seven years from January 1998 to December 2004. 
The variability of global atmospheric aerosol is consistent with the fire variations 
during this period. The TRMM fire products were also compared to the coincident 
TRMM rainfall and other rainfall products to investigate the interaction between 
rainfall and fire.  
12.2 TSDIS Fire Algorithms 
Using measurements of VIRS 3.75 m and 11 m bands, the TSDIS fire product 
algorithm was built on heritage algorithms of NOAA/AVHRR (Kaufman et al., 
1990; Flasse and Ceccato, 1996). The TRMM/VIRS and NOAA/AVHRR have 
five channels with similar center wavelengths and bandwidths across visible and 
infrared spectrums (0.63 m, 1.61 m, 3.75 m, 10.8 m, and 12 m). VIRS scans 
a 45e swath with a 2.11 km instantaneous field of view (IFOV) at nadir and 3.02 km 
IFOV at the edge of scan from the non-sun-synchronous 350 km TRMM orbit. The 
VIRS geometric registration has an uncertainty about 0.5  0.8 of the pixel size. 
VIRS provides twice daily observation over most of the tropical and subtropical 
areas (180eW  180eE and 40eS  40eN).  
The fundamental physics of the fire algorithm using VIRS 3.75 m and 11 m 
bands is the Wien displacement law:

 is the wavelength at which the radiation is at a maximum if the 
radiative temperature is at T. C 2,898 mK is a constant. Thus, the vegetated 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
164 
surface over tropics and sub-tropics, with a radiative temperature about 300 K, 
has a peak around the 11 m band. Fire pixels, with radiative temperatures about 
800 K, have a radiative peak around the 3.75 m band. Therefore, if fires occur 
in a portion of a pixel, the radiant energy of 3.75 m band increases much more 
rapidly than that of 11 m band, resulting in a larger than normal difference of 
brightness temperatures between the two bands.  
If a large part of a pixel is filled with fires, the 3.75 m band could be saturated 
because the saturation temperature of VIRS 3.75 m band is only around 322 K. 
We have not observed saturation of the VIRS 11 m although the saturation 
temperature of this band is similar to that of 3.75 m band. The 11 m band is 
not as sensitive as the 3.75 m band to the thermal anomalies happening within a 
pixel. The saturation temperature is the maximum output brightness temperature for 
a thermal infrared channel of the sensor. The NOAA/AVHRR sensors have saturation 
temperatures between 320 K  330 K. ATSR, which is designed to measure seas 
surface temperatures, has a saturation temperature of 312 K only. However, the 
recent MODIS has a saturation temperature of 500 K for 4 m band. 
The TSDIS nighttime algorithm is basically a traditional threshold method using 
only the VIRS thermal band brightness temperatures (Tbs). Based on careful studies 
over various regions globally using VIRS data as well as examining the results of 
AVHRR experiments (Matson and Dozier, 1981; Kaufman et al., 1990), the TSDIS 
fire algorithm uses the following criteria to detect nighttime fire pixels: 
(1) Channel 3 (3.75 m) is saturated or 
(2) Tb3 > 315 K and Tb3-Tb4 > 15 K 
In general, only a small portion of a pixel may be occupied by the fire when a 
fire occurs. Because the environmental Tb3 (Tb3env) is about 300 K and the fire 
Tb3 is about 800 K, the criteria presented above may reject a pixel that has less 
than 2% of its area occupied by fire. Compared to the current existing algorithms 
(Table 12.1), TSDIS algorithm is reasonable. Table 12.1 shows typical threshold 
of various sensors. For some of these sensors, multi-algorithms may exist.

The daytime algorithm uses a contextual approach described by Flasse and 
Ceccato (1996). The contextual approach uses certain threshold to determine a 
hot spot pixel and then uses various ancillary data and a series of tests to exclude 
false alarm. The TSDIS daytime algorithm first uses the thermal band Tbs to

choose candidate of fire pixels. After that, additional tests are performed to make 
final choices. These tests use VIRS visible/near-infrared data as well as ancillary 
data sources.  
Compared to the nighttime retrieval, the daytime fire detection is much more 
difficult and complicated as the 3.75 m band is affected by solar radiation in 
many aspects. The reflected solar radiation from the surface may significantly 
increase the 3.75 m channel radiances. Studies over desert, open shrub and other 
bare ground area indicated that the VIRS 3.75 m band might be saturated when 
solar radiation was at its maximum. In a vegetated area, the increase in Tb3 due to 
solar radiation was not as significant. As a result, the TSDIS daytime fire algorithm 
uses a 1 km resolution (Townshend et al., 1994) global surface type data to exclude 
bare ground pixels and other thermal anomalies related to the solar radiation and 
surface properties. The land type data set was generated by the UMD using near 
nadir AVHRR data. The uncertainty of geometric registration of this data is about 
0.8 km. Therefore, significant number of false fire pixels may exist over areas 
with mixed surface types in summer or spring season. 
Another problem for daytime fire retrieval is the occurrence of sun glint. When 
sun glint occurring, the 3.75 m pixels become saturated or have Tbs similar to that 
of fire pixels. The sun glint pixels have been observed from VIRS measurements 
in the oceanic area. The sun glint can be detected using variations of reflectance 
of VIRS Channel 1 and Channel 2 (Flasse and Ceccato, 1996; Kaufman and Justice, 
1998). Sun glint may also occur in the cloud surface and cloud edges. Discussion 
of such problems is beyond the scope of this Chapter. In daytime detection, the 
algorithm also calculates background Tb3 and Tb4 by scanning an area of 25 pixels 
and 25 scans with the target pixel as the center. The purpose of this calculation is 
to further exclude false fire pixels. In the final product, a fire pixel may be rejected 
if the difference between Tb3 and the background Tb3 is less than 8e.  
Based on these analyses, the TSDIS daytime fire algorithm uses the following 
criteria to identify daytime fire pixels: 
(1) Channel 3 (3.75 m) is saturated and Tb4 > 285 K or 
   Tb3 > 320 K and Tb3-Tb4 > 20 K and Tb4 > 285 K 
(2) Pixel is not a bare ground, or open shrub pixel 
(3) Tb3-Tb3env > 8 K. 
The Tb4 requirement is used to exclude cloud and heavy aerosol pixels. Under 
these conditions, the algorithm is unable to detect fire pixels. Both criteria 2 and 
3 may reject real fire pixels. However, our day/night fire product comparison 
showed that the fire occurrence under these two conditions was rare while a large 
number of false fire pixels might be generated without these daytime constrains. 
Table 12.2 shows typical threshold of various sensors in daytime. However, most 
important thing for daytime algorithm is to exclude false fire pixels. Except the 
contextual threshold, manual methods are often used for regional retrieval. Further 
discussion of daytime false alarm removal will be discussed in Section 12.5.1.

12.3 TSDIS Fire Products 
TSDIS fire algorithm routinely creates global daily and monthly fire products. The 
daily product is a hot spot map with VIRS pixel resolution (2.1 km at nadir). The 
processing of daily products starts as soon as the production of the VIRS L1B files 
for the current day is completed. There are typically 16 orbits, or L1B files daily. 
The operational L1B creation lags real-time by about 12 hours. Therefore, the 
global fire product has a lag time of approximately 14 hours. The daily products 
include two files. The first file, the basic file of all products, is a text file that 
details necessary information for all fire pixels. The information includes date, orbit 
number, pixel number, solar zenith angle, latitude, longitude, UTC time, reflectance 
of Channel 1 and Channel 2, brightness temperatures and background brightness 
temperatures of Channel 3 and Channel 4. This text file is then used to create 
daily global hot spot. 
Figure 12.1 shows a typical daily hot spot image of April 12, 2005. The upper 
panel displays the distribution of global fire pixels. The three lower panels show 
enlarged area maps over Northern America, Southern America, and the Indonesian 
area. On this particular day, a large number of fire pixels were detected over the 
Southeast Asia and sub-Sahara. 
The monthly image is a 0.5e0.5e
 resolution composite of fire counts for the 
month. The monthly text files provide information for all fire pixels observed within 
the month. Any information missed in daily text files due to operational delays is 
displayed in the monthly file. The monthly product may be useful for understanding 
of the effect of fires on the variations of aerosol (Hsu et al., 1996) ozone and 
other greenhouse gases (Levine, 1991). The description of algorithm, as well as 
the daily and monthly products (image and data) can be downloaded from TSDIS 
home page or anonymous ftp site: ftp-tsdis.gsfc.nasa.gov in pub/yji/MONTHLY 
and pub/yji/DAILY. However, as described above, daytime hot spots contained in 
these files may contain a large number of false fire pixels. A typical way for user 
to further exclude false alarms is day/night screening. Such screening may reject 
most false fires in non-fire season. The detailed description of TRMM fire algorithm 
and products can be found in Ji and Stocker (2002a).

12.4 Seasonal and Interannual Variability  
Fires may occur randomly but are constrained by the regional climate and vegetation 
state. The TRMM yearly mean fire count of 1998  2003 years (Fig. 12.2(a)) showed 
intensive fires in South America, Africa, Australia, Southeast Asia, and Indonesia. 
Moderate fires occurred in China, Northern and Central America. In February, 
March, April, and May (FMAM) season, most fires occurred in the Northern 
hemisphere (Fig. 12.2(b)), especially in Southeast Asia, sub-Saharan Africa and 
Central America. In June, July, August, and September (JJAS), fires were observed 
in the southern hemisphere and northern America (Fig. 12.2(c)).

count/4-month). (c) JJAS mean from 1998  2003 (unit: count/4-month) 
The dominant pattern of aerosol index from TOMS data (Hsu et al., 1996; Ji 
and Stocker, 2002b) is the Sahara dust (Fig. 12.3(a)). However, the contribution of 
intensive fires is evident. Since fires occur only in certain season while the Sahara 
dust is almost a static feature, the magnitude of mean aerosol index in burning 
areas is significantly smaller than that of the Sahara dust. In FMAM season, the 
magnitude of aerosol index over fire centers of Southeast Asia and Indonesia is 
comparable to that over Sahara desert area (Fig. 12.3(b)). Fires in these areas have 
been very serious in the recent decade (Malingreau, 1990; Giri and Shrestha, 2000). 
Almost no aerosols were observed over the southern hemisphere in this season. 
In JJAS season (Fig. 12.3(c)), the strength of aerosol index in southern Africa and 
Southern America is quite strong but still considerably weaker than that of Sahara 
dust. There were moderate aerosols in northern America in this season.  
The TOMS aerosol index maps (Hsu et al., 1996; Ji and Stocker, 2002b) are 
generally in agreement with the fire maps except the desert area. Since the smoke

can be transported far beyond its fire origin, the unconditional correlation between 
fire count and aerosol index is only about 0.22. For conditional (only compare 
pixels where fire exists) cases, the correlation between aerosol index and fire count 
is as high as 0.55 if the Australia is excluded. In Australia, there were virtually no 
aerosols observed while substantial fires were observed. This inconsistency may 
reflect false fire in TRMM fire algorithm for vegetation/desert mixed pixels. The 
false fire pixels have also been noticed in sub-Saharan and other areas. However, 
the decreasing sensitivity of TOMS algorithm toward lower altitudes may also 
contribute to this difference. The depth of smoke in Southwestern Australia fire 
during winter season may be quite small.  
Interannual variations were significant in Indonesia and the Central America. 
For example, in FMAM 1998, an El Niño season, intensive fires and aerosols in 
the two regions were observed by TRMM and TOMS, respectively (Figs. 12.4(a) 
and 12.5(a)). The magnitude of aerosol index in Indonesia and Central America in 
1998 FMAM season is comparable to that of Saharan dust. However, in FMAM 
1999, a normal season, fires were moderate and no aerosols were observed 
(Figs. 12.4(b) and 12.5(b)).

12.5 Diurnal and Seasonal Cycles 
12.5.1 Diurnal Cycle of TRMM Observation 
In order to use daily hot spot products, the diurnal cycle must be carefully studied 
because a large number of false fire pixels may exist in the operational data in 
either burning season or off-fire season, especially over sand/vegetation mixed 
land cover (Ji and Stocker, 2002). False fire in off-fire season may impact the fire 
seasonality significantly. We have looked into a number of fire regions for the past 
six years and found that in fire seasons, the fires are often observed during nighttime 
during an off-fire season, the satellite observation may show hot spots in daytime 
but not in nighttime. As shown in Table 12.3, in Southeast Asia, South America, 
and Africa, the numbers of fire pixels in daytime and nighttime do not differ 
substantially in fire seasons. The ratios are about 1  1.5. In Indonesia, the nighttime 
fire pixels are outnumbered the daytime fires pixels. However, in non-fire season, 
there are normally no nighttime fire pixels.

The maximum fire counts appears between noon to almost mid-night. In East and 
West USA, the non-fire seasons show strong diurnal cycle with a peak in noon, while 
the fire seasons have fire peaks between noon and 6 pm and last into midnight 
(Fig. 12.7). The situation is similar for other areas across the world (Fig. 12.8).

Different pictures of seasonal cycles may appear by using daytime and nighttime 
satellite fire data (Fig. 12.9). In the Eastern USA, the nighttime product shows 
peaks around April for each year, while the daytime product showed much stronger 
seasonal cycle. In the Western USA, the nighttime fire counts do not show evidence 
of seasonal cycle, but the daytime counts indicate a strong annual cycle with peaks 
in summer time. 
 
Figure 12.9 Variations of fire counts in East USA (a) and West USA (b) 
In order to reduce the effect of aliasing of diurnal cycle on the seasonal and 
intraseasonal fire variability, a simplified model is developed to transform the 
TRMM fire data. Only nighttime results are presented in this Chapter to avoid 
discussions of issues such as false fire and day/night screening although the methods 
can be used for daytime too. In the prototype, the nighttime period is divided into 
four particular time windows (Table 12.4) and the model assumes one overpass for

each window for all pentads. Multi-overpasses are normalized before processing. 
The model then calculates the average fire counts per overpass within each window 
using TRMM observations during major fire seasons. As an example, the ratios for 
each window and each fire season in Southeast Asia (90eE  110eE, 5eN  25eN) 
are listed in Table 12.4. Since each pentad of this region has observations that 
cover about 2/3 of the daily cycle, TRMM overpasses for at least one of the four 
windows in all pentads are guaranteed. Available observations within certain 
windows and pre-calculated ratio look-up tables are then used to extrapolate fire 
counts for windows with no observed overpasses.

Time series of TRMM observed fire count (count/day) and transformed fire 
count (count/day) in Southeast Asia is displayed in Fig. 12.10. In the observed time 
series, the effect of satellite aliasing can be seen from a number of dips during 
certain fire episodes. Such dips are largely eliminated in the transformed time 
series. The fire time series in Southeast Asia are also compared with the Global  
Precipitation Climatology Project Janowiak and Arkin (1991) rainfall over land. 
The results (Fig. 12.10) indicate that the fire intraseasonal variability is indeed 
closely related to the rainfall variations. The intraseasonal fire variability is dominated 
by fire episodes relative to the rainfall variability rather than a few dips relative 
to the aliasing. The transformation does not substantial change the pattern of time 
series. The comparison also indicates that the onset and duration of fire season are 
also related to the intraseasonal variability of rainfall. The 15  30 day and 30  60 
day intraseasonal oscillations of tropical rainfall have been well defined. Further 
discussion about the diurnal cycle aliasing can be found in Ji and Stocker (2003). 
12.5.2 Seasonal Variation 
Genoroso et al. (2003) compared the ATSR nighttime products to the daily fire 
products from TRMM, AVHRR etc. in nine selected regions. Their analyses 
demonstrate that in most cases, the nighttime products show a seasonal cycle that is

transformed fire count (count/day, dotted line), and GPCP rainfall (mm/day) in 
Southeast Asia (90eE  110eE, 5eN  25eN) 
consistent with the daily observations. However, they noticed significant discrepancies 
in biomass seasonality between ATSR nighttime product and TRMM daily product 
in Sahel and other two selected regions. Since the normalized nighttime fire count 
units for the three selected regions (Fig. 12.11) showed consistent seasonality, it 
is believed that the daytime false alarm would be the major contributor to such 
differences. 
We used day/night screening to filter the daytime false alarm. The discrepancies 
of seasonality between ATSR nighttime data and TRMM daily data noted in 
Generoso et al. (2003) are avoided (Fig. 12.12).

12.6 Summary 
The TSDIS fire product has provided global fire information since January 1998 
and will continue to do so for the TRMM lifetime. The results presented in this 
paper indicate a strong seasonal cycle of fire occurrences over Southeast Asia 
with peaks in March and over South America and Africa with peaks in northern 
summers. The fire occurrences in the Indonesian region and Central America 
were dominated by the ENSO cycles. The false alarms from daytime observations 
may seriously affect the accuracy of diurnal cycle, as well as seasonal and intra- 
seasonal cycles. A day/night screening method was used to filter out the daytime 
false alarm and improve the description diurnal and seasonal cycles of satellite 
observed land fire.

Abstract A multi-disciplinary research program to enhance fire research 
in New Jersey and the Eastern coastal plain has been re-established at the 
USDA Forest Service—Silas Little in New Lisbon, New Jersey. The goals are 
to provide fire managers better tools for predicting fire danger, quantifying 
hazardous fuels and their accumulation rates, and mitigating air quality 
issues at multiple scales. Research products and applications are described, 
including a network of towers reporting real-time fire weather data and 
indices, mesoscale fire weather modeling, vegetation mapping by LIDAR 
and remote sensing, and validation activities using field plots for estimates 
of forest productivity, fuel dynamics, and ecosystem modeling. The tower 
infrastructure is also used to monitor smoke emissions and carbon flux from 
prescribed fires and wildfires. These data will help determine best management 
practices for reducing hazardous fuels, maintain cleaner air, and increase 
carbon sequestration following fires. Close interaction with state and federal 
fire managers facilitates the integration of new results with current decision 
support tools.

13.1 Introduction 
Twenty-three percent of New Jersey’s land area (500,000 ha) is occupied by the 
Pine Barrens, a complex mosaic of upland (47%) and wetland forests (29%), with 
the balance comprised of primarily developed and agricultural areas (Fig. 13.1; 
Lathrop and Kaplan, 2004). Much of the upland forests are dominated by highly 
flammable stands composed of Pitch Pine (Pinus rigida), dense scrub oaks (Quercus 
marlandica, Q. ilicifolia) and Ericaceous shrubs. Large (+40,000 ha) fires were 
common prior to fire suppression activities.  

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires

Wildfire behavior and fire danger prediction in the New Jersey Pinelands are 
complex, due to highly dynamic meteorological conditions and the wide range of 
biophysical factors that prevail in the region. Meteorological conditions are 
strongly influenced by the Appalachians to the West and the Atlantic Ocean to 
the East. Frequent passage of frontal systems followed by windy, dry conditions 
occurs during the spring and fall, and scattered convective thunderstorm activity 
occurs in the summer. Biophysical factors that impact fire behavior include the 
presence of sandy, rapidly-draining soils in upland forests, which contrast with wet 
histosols in wetland forests. All forest types are characterized by moderate rates 
of productivity (Pan et al. 2006), abundant sub-canopy and understory vegetation 
(Skowronski et al. 2007), and the rapid accumulation of 1-hr and 10-hr fuels on 
the forest floor.

This combination of meteorological and biophysical factors can produce fire 
danger conditions and fire behavior that are difficult to predict using standard fire 
danger indices and models, complicating wildfire suppression activities across 
the region. 
As part of the USDA Forest Service research efforts in New Jersey funded by 
the national fire plan (NFP), we developed an integrated network of fire weather 
stations, above-canopy atmospheric sampling towers, remotely sensed estimates 
of forest composition and structure, and field sampling plots to better estimate 
fire danger, quantify fuel loads, and evaluate fuel models. Collectively, data also 
are used to validate predictive fire weather and forest ecosystem models. Our 
framework provides the basis for a “model forest” system with the infrastructure 
and tools that can address fire management issues at multiple scales. This 
framework has been extended to parallel studies in Eastern coniferous forest in 
Florida, New York, North Carolina and Wisconsin. This Chapter provides the 
rationale and an overview of the interdisciplinary study and monitoring program 
initiated in 2002 to support NFP research in the Eastern US.  
13.2 Regional Fire Weather and Climate Modeling 
Fire managers have identified the need for a more reliable fire danger rating 
system for the Eastern coastal plain that would augment the national fire danger 
rating system (NFDRS), because it does not always capture rapid changes in fire 
weather conditions or the dynamics of fuel moisture content in these ecosystems. 
Fuel moisture contents can drop dramatically following the passage of cold fronts 
and the onset of dry, windy conditions during the spring in the Pine Barrens. For 
example, frontal passage on May 11, 2007 resulted in RH levels >20% and 
windy conditions, driving a rapid decrease in 10-hr fuel moisture content to <7% 
(Fig. 13.2). On May 15th and 16th, the Warren Grove wildfire burned 8,200 ha 
and damaged or destroyed 41 structures. During this period, the NFDRS showed 
low fire danger, and the keetch byram drought index (KBDI) was reported to be 
<200 (out of a maximum value of 800; WFAS archive for May 15 and May 16, 
2007 at http://www.wfas.net/). 
Analysis of long-term (1930-present) weather records and wildfire history data 
indicates that wildfire occurrence in spring is largely decoupled from fire severity 
indices such as the KBDI and Buildup Index, commonly used by the New Jersey 
Forest Fire Service (NJFFS; Skowronski et al., submitted). Rather, wildfires 
correspond to these events characterized by low RH and high windspeeds, and to 
a recently- documented seasonal depression in moisture content of Pitch Pine 
foliage in the spring. Such fire weather conditions are predicted accurately by the 
MM5 model.

Figure 13.2 The passage of a cold front in mid-May 2007 resulted in windy 
conditions with very low atmospheric humidity levels, which drove 10-hour fuel

We have established a network of ten canopy level and understory meteorological 
towers for improved fire weather monitoring (Figs. 13.1 and 13.3). Towers are 
located in the three major upland forest types (Oak/Pine, Pine/Oak, Pine/Scrub 
Oak; McCormick and Jones, 1973; Lathrop and Kaplan, 2004, Skowronski et al.

2007), two of which are in high fire risk areas, and measure incoming solar 
radiation, net radiation, air temperature, relative humidity, wind speed and 
direction, precipitation and 10-hour fuel moisture. Hourly data are sent via wireless 
modems to the New Jersey State Climatologist Office, for posting on their 
website (http://climate.rutgers.edu/stateclim; fast-loading fire weather page at 
http://climate.rutgers.edu-usfs-monitoring.php), making this information accessible 
to fire managers and other users in real-time. In addition to these variables, 
atmospheric turbulence and fluxes of energy, water vapor and carbon dioxide are 
measured above the forest canopy using sonic anemometers and fast response 
gas analyzers (see below). A SODAR (Sonic Detection and Ranging) system, 
which measures 15-minute average windspeed and direction profiles up to 700 m 
height, also has been operated on a walk-up tower at the Silas Little Experimental 
Forest since July 2004.

(c) Pine/Scrub Oak forests in the Pinelands of New Jersey. In addition to real-time 
fire weather variables, these towers are used to measure eddy fluxes of sensible heat, 
water vapor, and carbon dioxide above the canopy 
The Eastern area modeling consortium (EAMC) in East Lansing, MI has run 
the MM5 atmospheric mesoscale model twice daily in real time since the summer 
of 2002 (Heilman et al., 2005). High-resolution fire weather indices (1 km for 
New Jersey) predicted using the MM5 are available on an operational basis 
(http://fs.fed.us/fcamms).  
The MM5 has proven to be a valuable tool for predicting severe fire conditions. 
For example, case studies like the 2002 Jake’s Branch fire and the 2007 Warren 
Grove wildfire illustrate its ability to accurately predict fire weather conditions 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
186 
up to 48 hours in advance (Fig. 13.4). MM5 predictions are also being linked to a 
variety of products such as fuel moisture models, fire behavior models such as 
FARSITE, and fuel prescription models such as CONSUME.

wildfire in the NJ Pine Barrens. Box with flame indicates site of Jake’s Branch fire 
that closed the New Jersey Parkway 
The EAMC simulations are archived every three hours for validation purposes, 
and data collected by networks such as described above can be used to evaluate MM5 
fire weather predictions. For example, landscape level variation in meteorological 
variables measured from fire weather towers was low for air temperature and  
RH (mean CV’s 2.4% and 4.6%, respectively) and greater for windspeed (mean 
CV 21.2%) (Fig. 13.5(a)). The MM5 predicted weather events and trends very 
well, but hourly data occasionally under predicted daily maximal temperature values 
(Fig. 13.5(b)). Model evaluation such as this has led to the recent incorporation 
of more realistic algorithms for surface-atmosphere exchange, and a better fit to 
measured fire weather variables. 
We are developing a new drought stress index, based on forest energy balance 
measurements made from the three above-canopy towers instrumented to measure 
eddy fluxes (Figs. 13.1 and 13.3). Specifically, the ratio of sensible heat to absorbed 
radiation (S/Ribs) is typically < 0.4 during summer daytime hours (10:00  17:00) 
when soil water is abundant. During periods of drought stress, S/Ribs >0.5, and 
reaches >0.7 during periods of very high to extreme fire danger. Ratios of S/Ribs

are calculated at half hourly intervals, and characterize 1  5 km2 of forest, depending 
upon measurement height and meteorological conditions.

13.3 Fuel Mapping, Forest Biomass and Forest Dynamics  
The Eastern LANDFIRE Prototype was initiated in 2004 to enhance the national 
LANDFIRE effort by developing fire regime maps that accurately characterize 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires

the historic fire frequency, severity, and patterning at multiple scales in the Eastern 
US. This effort complements the ongoing efforts of LANDFIRE-US, to provide a 
cohesive and consistent national fire management strategy for the conterminous 
US (Keane et al., 2003). The Eastern Prototype region covers 3.6 million ha, and 
includes the Delaware River Basin Watershed (DRB) in Pennsylvania, New 
Jersey, Delaware and New York, in addition to the New Jersey Pine Barrens. 
Biometric measurements from field plots and LIDAR measurements of biomass 
and fuel structure have been used to evaluate LANDFIRE models and products 
for the region.  
Vegetation maps derived from LANDSAT and digital orthophotos (Lathrop and 
Kaplan, 2004), LIDAR (Light Detecting and Ranging) measurements of stand 
height and canopy density made by helicopter and fixed-wing aircraft (Skowronski 
et al., 2007, Clark et al, submitted), Forest Inventory and Analysis census data 
(FIA; http://fia.fs.fed.us), fuel photo series plots (Wright et al. 2007), and our 
intensive forest inventories have been used to obtain accurate estimates of fuel 
loads for approximately 500,000 acres of the Pinelands in public ownership. 
LIDAR metrics are highly correlated with plot-based measurements of canopy 
height and biomass across the major upland forest types (r 0.79 and r 0.69, 
respectively). LIDAR data also are being used to evaluate the arrangement of 
branches and foliage within the forest to detect the presence of “ladder fuels”, 
which increase probability of understory fires becoming crown fires (Fig. 13.6; 
Skowronski et al. 2007). Collectively, these data are used to produce maps of forest 
structure and fuel loading across the Pinelands, and to evaluate the effectiveness 
of fuel reduction treatments implemented by the NJFFS. Along with observations 
of fire behavior, these data are being used to select the appropriate fire behavior 
models for the region (Scott and Burgan, 2005). 
During prescribed fire season in spring, we evaluate fuel reduction treatments 
in collaboration with the NJFFS and federal fire managers by sampling fuel depths 
and mass on the forest floor pre- and post-prescribed fire. Prescribed fires typically 
range from 20 to 500 ha per fire, and a target of 10,000 ha is treated per year. 
On average, 2.20.3 t ha–1 (mean1 SD, n 16) of 1-hr and 10-hr fuels on the 
forest floor are consumed in a single prescribed fire, and biomass of understory 
vegetation is reduced considerably. These measurements help quantify fuel reduction 
treatments for fire managers, and contribute to an understanding of the tradeoffs 
between hazardous fuel reduction and carbon sequestration by forests in the Pinelands. 
Validated ecosystem models, MODIS satellite products and carbon flux 
measurements have been used to characterize rates of forest productivity and fuel 
accumulation at the research forest stands with flux towers (Silas Little, Fort Dix, 
and Cedar Bridge; Figs. 1 and 3; Pan et al. 2006). In conjunction with fuel 
loading measurements, models and flux measurements lead to an understanding 
of the dynamics of fuel accumulation. For example, field measurements were 
similar to model predictions for 1-hr (3.20.3 vs. 3.00.3 t ha–1 yr–1; mean1 
SD) and 10-hr (0.60.2 vs 0.60.1 t ha–1 yr–1) fuel accumulation rates.

Pine/Scrub oak stand near the Cedar Bridge fire tower. The recently burned area 
was the site of a prescribed fire 2 months previously, and the unburned site has not 
burned since 1995. Data are binned in 1 m increments,1 SD. Differences between 
normalized fraction of LIDAR returns are significant for 1  2 m and 2  3 m height 
class bins at P < 0.05. Data are adapted from Skowronski et al. 2007 
LIDAR and plot-based measurements help guide transitions among different 
fuel models. We compared forest productivity at different scales with MODIS 
satellite estimates of net primary productivity (NPP), predictions using forest 
ecosystem models, eddy flux estimates of NPP, and FIA data. We determined  
that MODIS (MOD17) overestimated NPP in conifer-dominated stands, and 
underestimated NPP in deciduous hardwood stands in the Eastern Prototype 
region. We were able to correct the underestimates in coniferous forests using an 
algorithm for soil water availability, but deciduous forests may need better estimates 
for physiological parameters (Pan et al., 2006). 
13.4 Air Quality  
The current network of towers monitoring fire weather and fluxes of energy, 
water and carbon dioxide can be use to monitor smoke emissions and carbon flux 
from prescribed fires and wildfires. In conjunction with measurements of fuel 
consumption during prescribed fires, these data will help determine best management 
practices for reducing hazardous fuels, maintain cleaner air, and increase carbon 
sequestration following fires.  
We have instrumented a mobile eddy covariance tower to measure carbon 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires

dioxide and water fluxes during and immediately following wildfires and 
prescribed burns. Turbulence, SODAR and fuel consumption data collected 
during prescribed fires are used in conjunction with BlueSky to model air quality 
(http://ncrs.fs.fed.us/eamc/products/bluesky/). 
The Silas little experimental forest is part of New Jersey’s Atmospheric 
Deposition monitoring network. Wet bulk deposition and air quality monitoring are 
located at the site. The air quality work will continue at the Silas little experimental 
forest as part of a Forest Service Research initiative to implement the international 
cooperative programme (ICP) on Assessment and Monitoring of Air Pollution 
Effects on Forests Level ē monitoring protocols (www.icp-forests.org) at selected 
experimental forests and long term ecological research (LTER) sites to determine 
the flux of air pollutants, such as ozone, that is taken up by the forests in this region. 
In conjunction with particulate research conducted by the NJ Department of 
Environmental Protection, Rutgers Coastal Ocean Research Laboratory, and the 
EAMC BlueSky modeling effort, new PM2.5 samplers (Met One Inst., E-BAM) have 
been placed on existing fixed towers and the mobile trailer. The meteorological 
and SODAR data will be used to run a high resolution WRF mesoscale model with 
a plume model, CalPuff, to model the distribution of pollen/air pollutants/smoke 
and the sea-breeze effects on human health and air quality.  
We anticipate that there will be a need for air quality and flux research to 
address the effects of hazardous fuels reductions (under the healthy forest restoration 
act) and air quality standards (PM2.5, ozone) in problem regions such as the mid- 
Atlantic, and the desire to maximize forest productivity (carbon sequestration) 
following disturbance. 
13.5 Conclusions 
A multi-disciplinary research program to enhance fire research in New Jersey and 
the East has been re-established at the Silas little experimental forest. National 
Fire Plan (NFP) research has established a regional network of ground plots, 
meteorological stations, above-canopy sampling towers, RS data layers, and 
validated weather and forest ecosystem models. This provides a “model forest 
system” with the infrastructure and tools for an integrated fire research program 
to address fire management issues in the East.

Abstract Dead fuel loads were measured on six distinct forest management 
compartments in North Carolina’s Uwharrie national forest, Croatan national 
forest and the Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge. Average 1-, 10-, 100- 
and 1000-hour fuels loads were analyzed within and between each of the three 
research areas and compared to National Fire Danger Rating System fuel 
model estimates of dead fuel load. Mean dead fuel load measurements were 
significantly different within and between most research areas and differences 
tended to increase with fuel class size. While there was good agreement 
within and between research areas for woody fuels, the addition of litter and 
duff generally resulted in larger variability and significantly different dead 
fuel load measurements. NFDRS fuel load estimates compared well with

some classes of measured fuel load, but no one model provided estimates 
comparable with measured fuel load across all fuel size classes within a site. 
The models tended to estimate 1- and 10-hour fuels well, but generally 
underestimated 100- and 1000-hour fuels. Large differences between 100- and 
1000-hour fuels were mostly the result of high duff and litter measurements, 
especially on the sites with deep peat soils. This important component of 
forest fuel loads may not be well represented in the current NFDRS. As forests 
become more fragmented and managed for different resource objectives, finer 
scale fuel load estimates may be necessary to accurately assess fire danger 
and minimize the loss of life and property. 
Keywords Wildfire, fuel load, fuel model, NFDRS, woody material 
14.1 Introduction 
Wildfires burn only a small percentage of forestland in the southern US every 
year, but the potential for loss of life and property has increased as urban 
development moves closer to forested areas, especially those with high fuel loads. 
Fuel loads are one of the major factors associated with wildfire risk, yet there is 
little data available to support local and regional estimates. The U.S. Government 
Accountability Office identified the need for improved fuel data as a prerequisite 
to meeting the goal of reducing wildfire risk (GAO, 2005). The report concluded 
that if fuel loads are not reduced there will be an increased risk to communities 
and ecosystems, and fighting wildfires could cost tens of billions of dollars in 
coming years. To reduce this threat and comply with the president’s healthy 
forests initiative, land managers need to be able to better identify areas at a high 
risk of wildfire.  
Wildfire danger rating systems have existed since the early 1920’s (Schlobohm 
and Brain, 2002). In 1972 the USDA Forest Service began using the national fire 
danger rating system (NFDRS) to identify areas at high risk to wildfire and to 
plan suppression tactics (Deeming and Brown, 1975). NFDRS fuel models are 
designed to encompass large areas (tens of thousands of acres) and rely on local 
knowledge of observed or predicted conditions, including fuel load (Schlobohm 
and Brain, 2002). The original NFDRS was comprised of nine fuel models, but 
increased to twenty models in 1978 (Anderson, 1982). A drought index was added 
in 1988 to improve fire danger rating in the southeastern US (Burgan, 1988). The 
index accounts for litter and duff that serve as fuels when drought conditions 
progress. The NFDRS dead fuel load estimates double when periods of maximum 
drought exist. 
Under the current system, only one to three fuel models may be appropriate for 
a given forest cover type. Due to the limited options available from the NFDRS 
and other fuel models, Scholl and Waldrop, (1999) developed their own fuel loading

estimates across eight representative southern pine ecosystems and reported dead 
fuel loads two to three times greater than those in the NFDRS, depending on the 
model selected. Litter made up over half of the fine dead fuel load at 6 of the 8 
sites. While the NFDRS was never intended to be used at the forest stand level, 
assumptions about fuel load and fire danger over broad and diverse areas in the 
South may be underestimating the risk of wildfire for forest stands. As forests 
become more fragmented and managed to achieve different resource objectives, 
finer scale fuel load models may be necessary to better assess fire danger. 
Dead fuel load in the NFDRS is classified into 1-, 10-, 100- and 1000-hour 
fuels, and each class is defined by the amount of time, or time lag, that it takes a 
fuel to reach moisture equilibrium with the environment. The 1- to 100- hour fuels 
include litter, duff and down deadwood, termed fine woody material (FWM), less 
than 7.6 cm in diameter. The 1000-hour fuels include duff and down deadwood, 
termed coarse woody material (CWM), larger than 7.6 cm in diameter. FWM 
decomposes relatively fast and influences how quickly a fire spreads. Fire managers 
are primarily concerned with the 1- and 10-hour fuels that influence diurnal changes 
in wildfire danger as moisture content fluctuates (Schlobohm and Brain, 2002). 
While the ecological role of CWM in forest ecosystems has been well documented 
(Harmon et al., 1986; McMinn and Crossley, 1996) there are only a few studies that 
quantify dead fuel load biomass in southern forest ecosystems (Wendel et al., 1962; 
Hough and Albini, 1978; Scholl and Waldrop, 1999; Chojnakcy et al., 2004). 
With the creation of the National Fire Plan (NFP) in 2000, emphasis was placed 
on quantifying down deadwood in an effort to identify areas that are at high risk 
of wildfire and better understand the temporal dynamics of forest fuels. Federal 
and state agencies, such as the USDA’s Forest Service and the multi-partnered 
LANDFIRE project, are working to provide fine resolution data that will aid in 
the creation of more accurate fuel load models. While it may be years before this 
research can be incorporated into a fire danger rating system, the end result will help 
land managers allocate limited resources toward areas with the greatest wildfire 
risk. The objectives of this Chapter were to compare dead fuel load estimates across 
six North Carolina forest communities with different management objectives and 
to assess NFDRS dead fuel load estimates for these forest types. An assessment of 
NFDRS dead fuel load estimate accuracy will assist researchers in determining if 
additional study is needed to better quantify wildfire risk across these important 
southern US ecosystems.

refuge, Croatan national forest, and Uwharrie national forest. Prescribed fire is 
used in each of these forests to reduce understory fuels. Study areas included two 
pond pine woodlands (commonly called high pocosins), two longleaf-loblolly pine 
stands, one oak-hickory and one mixed pine hardwood stand. 
The Alligator River (AR) national wildlife refuge is located in Dare County and 
contains a mix of high and low pocosins, pond pine woodlands, hardwood swamps 
and Atlantic white cedar swamps. Like many managed Coastal Plain forests, much 
of the area was ditched to promote tree growth. Two 36 hectare research sites 
were established in 80-year old high pocosin management areas. One area (AR-B) 
was severely burned during a prescribed fire in 2000 and the other area (AR-NB) 
has not been burned (NB) in recent memory. Both areas are commonly referred 
to as high pocosins, but their species composition and structures are more closely 
related to pond pine woodland (Schafale and Weakley 1990). Each site is 
dominated by pond pine (pinus serotina Michx.) with lesser amounts of biomass 
found in swampbay (Persea borbonia L.), sweetbay (Magnolia virginiana L.) and 
red maple (Acer rubrum L). The dominant understory species is inkberry (Ilex 
glabra L.), but Vaccinium sp., greenbrier (Smilax sp.) and lesser amounts of 
fetterbush (Lyonia lucida Lam.) are found throughout both areas. The primary 
difference between the two sites resulted from the prescribed fire in 2000. This 
fire crowned many of the pond pine in AR-B, creating large gaps and a thick 
growth of understory species in the openings. Dead fuel load measurements were 
collected between June and July 2002 in AR-B, and between December 2002 and 
January 2003 in AR-NB. 
Croatan national forest (CNF) is located in Jones County. Forest land in this 
Coastal Plain ecosystem is primarily composed of longleaf pine (Pinus palustris 
Mill.), loblolly pine (Pinus taeda L.) and bottomland hardwoods, with a mixed 
pine-hardwood transition found between the managed pines and unmanaged 
bottomland hardwoods. Two longleaf-loblolly pine stands, each with different 
prescribed burn cycles, were selected as study sites. CNF-3 is a 27 hectare stand 
on a 3-year burn cycle, with an understory dominated by gallberry (Ilex coriacea 
Pursh), Vaccinium species, greenbrier, swamp pepperbush (Clethra alnifolia L.) 
giant cane (Arundinaria gigantean Walt.), waxmyrtle (Myrica cerifera L.) and 
hardwood saplings. This site was last burned in 2002. CNF-1 is an annually 
burned stand that comprises approximately 6 fragmented hectares. The understory 
is dominated by gallberry, fetterbush (Lyonia lucida Lam.), waxmyrtle, and 
hardwood saplings. Both sites were planted with longleaf pine in the 1930s, and 
managed for sawtimber. This has created open canopied stands where longleaf 
and loblolly pine are codominant species. Dead fuel load measurements were 
collected from both sites in June 2004. 
The two sites in Uwharrie national forest (UNF) are located in Randolph and 
Montgomery counties. UNF is a patchwork of publicly owned lands, surrounding 
and bordering privately owned lands. As a result of this land fragmentation, 
wildfire risk at the WUI is an important management concern. Both research sites

a Small Scale Assessment of NFDRS Fuel Models

are representative of typical Piedmont forests. One site (UNF-O) is a 21 hectare, 
88-year old oak-hickory mix (O), and the other (UNF-P) is a 77 hectare loblolly 
pine stand (P) planted in 1964. Loblolly and shortleaf pine (Pinus echinata Mill.) 
make up approximately 61% of the basal area in UNF-P, with the other 39% 
comprised of hardwoods. Each site is burned on a 3  4 year cycle and dead fuel 
load measurements were collected from both sites in July 2004. 
14.2.2 Methods 
Field plots were established on two sites in each research area (UNF, CNF, AR) to 
measure fuel loads. Protocols followed those used by the USDA Forest Inventory 
and Analysis Program to measure down woody debris and fuels (FIA, 2005). Field 
plots at AR and CNF-3 consisted of four 7.3 m radius clustered subplots 35.6 m 
apart and 0, 120e and 240e from the central subplot. A singular plot design was 
used at both UNF sites and CNF-1. Hereinafter, plots and subplots will be referred 
to as plots. Three 7.3 m transects at 30e, 150e and 270e from plot center were 
used to tally and measure fine and coarse woody material.  
FWM was classified as 1-, 10- and 100-hour fuels equating to less than 0.6 cm, 
0.6  2.5 cm, and 2.5  7.6 cm in diameter at the line intersect, respectively. FWM 
less than 2.5 cm in diameter was tallied along a 1.8 m length of each transect. 
FWM 2.5  7.6 cm in diameter was tallied along a 3.1 m length of each transect. 
The diameter of FWM was measured along random transects to determine the 
mean diameter squared for each size class. Down deadwood was classified as CWM 
if it was greater than 7.6 cm in diameter and 0.9 m in length at the point of intersect 
along any of the transects. Species, decay class, length, and large and small end 
diameters were recorded for each piece of CWM. Species decay was classified 
on a 1  5 scale, 1 for undecayed CWM and 5 for heavily decayed CWM.  
Litter depth was measured at the end point of each transect and included 
undecomposed foliage in the Ae soil horizon. Duff was measured at the same 
point below the litter layer and was defined as partially decomposed litter below 
the Ae horizon. The percentage of forest floor covered by litter was estimated using 
a 2.1 m radius mircoplot 90 degrees east and 3.7 m from the plot center. Fine and 
coarse woody material biomass were combined with litter and duff biomass to 
estimate dead fuel load in each size class. The 1-hour fuels included litter biomass 
to a depth of 0.6 cm and 10-hour fuels included litter biomass from a depth of 
0.6  1.9 cm. 100- and 1000-hour fuels included litter and duff from a depth of 
1.9  10.2 cm and from 10.2  30.5 cm, respectively. These criteria were derived 
from definitions used in the NFDRS as described by Schlobohm and Brain (2002) 
and Deeming et al. (1977). In situations where the litter depth did not exceed 1.9 cm, 
duff biomass was classified as a 100-hour fuel.  
Biomass was calculated based on line intercept theory developed by Van 
Wagner (1968) and de Vries (1973) and later improved upon by Howard and

is that multiple attributes can be summed across transects to estimate per-unit-area

not identifiable, an average specific gravity value for hardwoods or softwoods 
was assigned. 
NFDRS model estimates of dead fuel load in each forest cover type (Table 14.2) 
were compared with measured dead fuel load to determine if there was good 
agreement and identify any trends. Minimum and maximum fuel loads across 
model size classes were based on drought indexes of 100 and 800, respectively. 
This resulted in minimum fuel loads equal to the NFDRS estimate and a maximum 
fuel loads equal to the NFDRS estimate times two. A model was considered to have 
good fit within and across size classes if the measured 95% confidence intervals 
for woody material and dead fuel load overlapped the minimum and maximum 
model estimates, respectively. This method was also used to determine if there 
was a best-fit fuel model for each study area.

significant differences within the Croatan and Uwharrie national forest research 
areas across sites and fuel classes. This was not the case at Alligator River (AR) 
where fuel loads were significantly larger in AR-B compared to AR-NB across 
all FWM fuel classes. CWM fuel loads were not significantly different between 
these two sites.

Mean dead woody fuel load increased with class size at all sites, but there was 
very little difference between 1- and 10-hour fine woody fuels across sites with the 
exception of AR-B. Mean 1- and 10-hour woody fuels at AR-B were significantly 
different and two times greater than the other sites. AR- B had the largest FWM 
fuel load (4.5 t/ac), but the smallest CWM fuel load. Mean 100-hour FWM fuel 
loads at UNF were similar to the AR-B site, but approximately 60% larger than 
AR-NB and 100%  280% larger than the CNF sites. UNF-O had the largest mean 
coarse and total dead woody fuel load. There were no significant differences 
between UNF and CNF for 1-hour FWM and 1000-hour CWM, but 100-hour FWM 
was significantly larger at UNF compared to CNF.

most research areas and differences tended to increase with fuel class size (Table 
14.4). While there was good agreement within and between research areas for 
woody fuels, the addition of litter and duff generally resulted in larger variability 
and significantly different dead fuel load measurements. CNF was the only research 
area where dead fuel loads were significantly different across all size classes. Mean 
1- and 10-hour dead fuel loads were significantly larger at UNF-P compared to 
UNF-O, but only by 0.1 (10%) and 0.4 t/ac (18%), respectively. There were 
significant differences between the two AR sites for 1- to 100-hour dead fuels, 
but not for 1000-hour fuels.

Measured dead fuel loads were smallest in the CNF-1 site and largest in the 
AR-B site across all fuel size classes with total dead fuel loads of 6 t/ac and 
71 t/ac, respectively. The annually burned site (CNF-1) had significantly smaller 
dead fuel loads compared to all other sites, with the exception of 1000-hour fuels 
at UNF-P. Both AR sites had nearly 2 and 9 times the amount of 100- and 
1000-hour fuels, respectively, compared to the other sites. The AR sites also had 
the deepest litter and duff which accounted for most of the dead fuel load. While 
litter and duff accounted for over 95% of 1000-hour fuel load at the AR sites, they 
contributed only 4 and 17% at UNF-P and CNF-3, respectively, and 0% at UNF-O 
and CNF-1. Mean litter and duff biomass measurements were similar across size 
classes in AR and UNF. With the exception of CNF-1 and AR-B 10-hour fuel 
loads, litter and duff contributed 59%  92% of the 1- to 100-hour fuels.

14.3.3 Comparison between Measured and NFDRS Dead Fuel  
Load Estimates 
14.3.3.1 Alligator River National Wildlife Refuge 
Measured woody and dead fuel loads were compared with minimum and maximum 
NFDRS model estimates of dead fuel load to assess model accuracy in each forest 
cover type. Model O, a high pocosin fuel model and the most appropriate model 
for the AR pond pine-pocosin sites, accurately estimated 10-hour dead fuel load at 
AR-B (burn/wildfire) and 1000-hour woody fuel load at AR-NB (no burn). Woody 
fuels were overestimated across all other size classes, and 100- and 1000-hour dead 
fuels were underestimated at both AR sites. Only the 100-hour NFDRS model O 
fuel load estimate was within 1 t/ac of measured woody fuel load. While model 
O overestimated 100-hour fine woody fuels at both sites and 1000-hour coarse 
woody fuels at AR-B, the model underestimated dead fuels in these size classes 
by 8  42 t/ac.  
Models G and K, developed for dense conifer and slash stands with high fuel 
loads, respectively, were also compared with measured fuel loads at AR since these 
sites had higher fuel loads. Like model O, these models tended to overestimate 
woody fuels in the 1- and 10-hour size classes and underestimate dead fuel loads 
in the 100- and 1000-hour size classes. Model G 10-hour and Model K 100-hour 
dead fuel load estimates did compare well with measured woody fuel load at the 
AR-B site, but not the AR-NB site. Overall, there was poor agreement between 
NFDRS model estimates and measured fuel loads at the AR sites. While woody 
and smaller sized classes of dead fuels were overestimated by the models, 100 
and 1000-hour dead fuels were underestimated by 58%  88%. 
14.3.3.2 Uwharrie National Forest 
NFDRS fuel models P and R matched the forest cover types at UNF-P (loblolly 
pine) and UNF-O (oak-hickory, respectively. Model R, used in oak-hickory and 
mixed SE US forests prior to leaf fall, was also considered for use in UNF-P 
since nearly 40% of the site is composed of hardwoods. Model P, used in long 
needled southern pine stands, overestimated 1-hour woody and dead fuel load at 
UNF-P by 0.8 t/ac (400%) and 0.9 (82%) t/ac, respectively. There was good 
agreement between this model and 10-hour woody fuels, but 10-hour dead fuels 
were underestimated by 0.6 t/ac (23%). Model P underestimated both 100-hour 
woody and dead fuels by 1.8 t/ac (78%) and 7.8 t/ac (89%), respectively, and 
does not estimate 1000-hour fuels. 
Model R provided reasonable estimates of 1-, 10- and 100-hour woody fuels and 
1-hour dead fuels at UNF-P. While the 1-hour and 10-hour woody fuel estimates 
did not overlap the measured confidence interval, the estimates were only 0.3 t/ac 
(150%) larger and 0.4 t/ac (44%) smaller, respectively. Model R underestimated 

14 Dead Fuel Loads in North Carolina’s Piedmont and Coastal Plain and

203
10- and 100-hour dead fuel load by 1.6 t/ac (62%) and 7.8 t/ac (89%), respectively. 
Like model P, model R does not provide estimates for 1000-fuels. 
Model R estimated 1- and 10-hour woody fuels and 1-hour dead fuels 
reasonable well at UNF-O, but only the 1-hour dead fuel load estimate overlapped 
the measured confidence interval. The NFDRS overestimated 1-hour woody fuels 
by only 0.3 t/ac (150%), and underestimated 10-hour woody fuels by 0.2 t/ac 
(29%) compared to measured fuel load. Model R underestimated 100-hour woody 
fuels and 10- and 100-hour dead fuels by 55%  87%. 
14.3.3.3 Croatan National Forest 
Measured fuel load at the CNF sites, dominated by longleaf and loblolly pines, 
were compared with fuel models C and P. Model C, developed for longleaf pine 
ecosystems, gave reasonable estimates of 1- and 10-hour woody and dead fuel 
loads at both CNF sites, with the exception of 10-hour dead fuel load at CNF-1. 
Model C does not provide estimates of 100- and 1000-hour fuel loads, but these 
fuels represented at least 84 and 78% of the total woody and dead fuel load, 
respectively. Model P, developed for long needled southern pine ecosystems, 
overestimated 1- and 10-hour woody and dead fuel loads at both sites, but 10-hour 
dead fuels were only 0.4 (25%) t/ac higher compared to measured dead fuel load 
at CNF-3. This model provided reasonable estimates of 100-hour woody fuel load 
at both CNF sites, but underestimated 100-hour dead fuel load by 1.6 (62%)  6.4 
(86%) t/ac. 
14.4 Discussion and Conclusions 
14.4.1 Woody Fuel Load Variability 
Woody fuel loads (FWM and CWM) were not significantly different within the 
CNF (longleaf-loblolly pine) and UNF (oak-hickory and pine-hardwood) research 
areas, but were significantly different between the two sites at AR (pond pine- 
pocosin). There was nearly twice as much FWM at AR-B (burned/wildfire) 
compared to AR-NB (no burn), and a large proportion of these fuels were from 
dead inkberry stems (personal observation), possibly a product of the wildfire in 
2000. Surprisingly, there was nearly twice as much CWM at AR-NB compared to 
AR-B, though the confidence intervals nearly overlap. While mean CWM fuel 
loads differed by 2.9  3.1 t/ac at the UNF and CNF sites, respectively, they were 
not significantly different due to the large confidence intervals associated with 
these measurements. 
Mean 1- and 10-hour woody fuel loads differed by no more than 0.2 and 0.4 t/ac 
between sites, respectively, with the exception of AR-B. The small differences

between these fuels across sites with different forest cover types and management 
regimes were unexpected. Litter fall generally covers the previous year’s FWM 
indicating that annual production of these fuels was similar across these sites. 
While natural and human disturbances influence the production of FWM at a 
given site, their effect on our sites is beyond the scope of this research. Fuel load 
variability, as well as the confidence intervals associated with these measurements, 
increased with fuel class size across all sites. While mean 100-hour fine and CWM 
fuel loads differed by as much as 3.3 t/ac, the heterogeneous distributions of these 
fuels resulted in few significant differences. This was especially true for CWM. 
14.4.2 Dead Fuel Load Variability 
The addition of litter and duff to fine woody fuels resulted in larger differences and 
variability between mean dead fuel loads across sites compared to woody fuels 
alone. Mean 1- and 10-hour dead fuel loads were lowest at CNF and highest at 
AR-B. These results were expected given the wildfire disturbance at AR-B and 
the open canopied stands at the CNF sites. The UNF and AR-NB sites had similar 
mean 1- and 10-hour dead fuel loads, suggesting a good relationship between 
these fuels and sites with closed canopies and little disturbance, regardless of 
cover type. Mean 100- and 1000-hour dead fuel loads were much higher at AR 
compared to the other sites, with litter and duff contributing the majority of these 
fuels. This was expected and underscores the potential of larger sized classes of 
dead fuels to significantly impact fire danger on sites with organic soils during 
periods of extended drought.  
It was difficult to compare our results with other studies due to different definitions 
used to derive fuel load. The 1- to 100-hour woody fuel and litter biomass estimates 
reported by Scholl and Waldrop (1999) were similar to those in this study, but 
1000-hour woody fuels were generally lower or not reported. Wade and Ward 
(1973) reported that fine fuel loads in AR commonly reach 15 t/ac, and can double 
when deep organic soils lose moisture during drought conditions. Fine fuel loads 
(1- to 100-hour fuels) at AR-B and AR-NB were 22 t/ac and 18 t/ac, respectively. 
14.4.3 Comparison between Measured and NFDRS Dead Fuel  
Load Estimates 
While some NFDRS fuel model estimates compared well with measured woody 
and dead fuel loads, no one model accurately estimated measured fuel load 
across all fuel size classes within a site. Model O, the high pocosin fuel model 
most appropriate in AR (pond pine-pocosin), generally overestimated woody and 
1-hour dead fuels, but underestimated 100- and 1000-hour dead fuels. Results

were similar when models G and K were compared with measured fuel loads, 
and these models are designed for areas with higher fuel loads.  
NFDRS fuel models did a better job of estimating fuel loads at the UNF 
(oak-hickory and pine hardwood) and CNF (longleaf-loblolly pine) sites. There was 
good agreement between model R, the oak-hickory and mixed hardwood model, 
and measured fuel loads at both UNF sites. While this model overestimated 
1-hour woody fuel loads and underestimated 10-hour woody fuels, differences 
were small. Model R estimates and measured 1-hour dead fuels were almost 
identical at both UNF sites, but 100-hour woody and dead fuel loads were 
underestimated. Model R did a better job of estimating fuel loads at UNF-P than 
model P, a NFDRS fuel model developed for long needled southern pine 
ecosystems. While UNF-P is classified as a loblolly pine stand, nearly 40% of the 
stand is an oak-hardwood mix indicating that model P may be better suited for 
pine stands with less of a hardwood component. 
NFDRS fuel load estimates for model C, developed for longleaf pine ecosystems, 
compared relatively well with 1- and 10-hour measured fuel load in the longleaf- 
loblolly pine stands at CNF. While estimates did not overlap the measured 
confidence interval, differences were small except for 10-hour dead fuel loads at 
CNF-1. The annual burn cycle at CNF-1 likely resulted in a loss of litter and the 
lower dead fuel load measurement for this size class compared to the model 
estimate. Model C does not have estimates for 100- or 1000-hour fuels. Since 
these fuel classes are not represented by the NFDRS, model P may be considered 
as a substitute for 100-hour woody fuels. While model P overestimated 1- and 
10-hour fuels at the CNF sites, it did provide good estimates of 100-hour woody 
fuels. However, model P underestimated 100-hour dead fuel loads at both sites, 
indicating that the model does a poor job of capturing the litter and duff fuels at 
these sites. 
The NFDRS fuel models in our analysis tended to overestimate 1- and 10-hour 
woody and dead fuels at the AR and CNF sites and while differences were 
sometimes small, model estimates were generally over 100% larger than measured 
mean fuel load. The models tended to underestimate 100- and 1000-hour fuels, 
and in many cases did not provide an estimate of 1000-hour fuel loads. Litter and 
duff made up a large percentage of dead fuels and this important component of 
forest fuel loads may not be well represented in the current NFDRS, especially in 
the 100- and 1000-hour fuels. Our measurements, and those reported by Wendel 
et al. (1962) and Scholl and Waldrop (1999), indicate that litter and duff can make 
up the majority of the dead fuel load in southern US forests. With the exception 
of CNF-1 and AR-B 10-hour fuels, litter and duff contributed 59%  92% of the 
1- to 100-hour fuel load. The smaller contribution of litter to the AR-B 10-hour 
fuel load (45%) is due to the higher mean FWM biomass at this site compared to 
the other sites. Litter at CNF-1 only contributed 38% of the total 10-hour fuel 
load due to the reduced litter layer from the previous year’s burn. 
A drought index was added to the NFDRS in 1988 to account for the drying of

deep litter and duff in the absence of precipitation and can as much as double the 
dead fuel load. Our results indicate that this has improved estimates of 1- and 
10-hour dead fuel loads, but estimates of 100- and 1000-hour dead fuels are still 
being underestimated. Fire managers are generally more concerned with 1- and 
10-hour dead fuels since they have the biggest influence on fire ignition and 
spread. This may be sufficient for initial wildfire assessments, but drought conditions 
coupled with underestimates of larger sized classes of fuel will result in higher 
available fuel loads and increase the vulnerability of sites to more intense wildfires. 
This research indicates that: ķ there is little difference between 1- and 10-hour 
dead woody fuels across forest types in the absence of major disturbances such as 
wildfire; ĸ litter and duff can make a significant contribution to the total dead 
fuel load and results in greater differences and variability between forest types; 
Ĺ NFDRS model O, developed for high pocosin sites, generally overestimates 
woody fuels and underestimates dead fuels at the AR pond pine-pocosin sites 
indicating that this model does not capture the deep litter and duff component 
found at these sites; ĺ NFDRS model R, developed for oak-hickory mixed 
hardwood forests before leaf fall, reasonably estimates 1- and 10-hour dead fuels 
in the oak-hickory stand at UNF, but underestimates 100-hour fuels and lacks 
1000-hour fuels; Ļ NFDRS model R is a better fit than model P, developed for 
long needled southern pine ecosystems, at UNF-P, a loblolly pine site with a 40% 
hardwood component; and ļ NFDRS model C, developed for longleaf pine 
ecosystems, does a good job of estimating 1- and 10-hour fuel loads for the two 
longleaf-loblolly pine stands in CNF, but lacks estimates for 100- and 1000-hour 
fuels. 
The comparison between measured and NFDRS dead fuel loads was done with 
the understanding that NFDRS fuel models were designed for use over large areas 
and to only provide a reasonable representation of typical fuel loads (Deeming 
and Brown, 1975). While results from the six sites in this study are not sufficient 
enough to assess the NFDRS for use in all southern forests, this and other studies 
indicate that dead fuel loads can be highly variable within similar forest cover 
types. Management regimes including prescribed burning along with other 
disturbances have created a patchwork of forestland that complicates fire danger 
assessments. As forests become more fragmented and managed for different 
objectives, finer scale fuel load estimates may be necessary to accurately assess 
fire danger and minimize the loss of life and property.

Abstract Grassland fires on level terrain offer a good basic scenario for 
test wildland fire behavior models, due to the simplicity and homogeneity of 
the fuels and terrain. Two physics based models, FIRETEC and WFDS, are 
briefly described, applied fire spread in grassland fuel, followed by a discussion 
of the results. It is important to note that both models have undergone 
appreciable development since the writing of this conference paper in 2005.

15.1 Introduction 
Two physics-based computational fire models (FIRETEC and WFDS), capable of 
predicting time dependent fire behavior and fire-atmosphere interactions in 3D are 
applied to wind driven grassland fires over flat terrain. Because these are surface 
fires (i.e., relatively little vertical flame spread) in a single, homogeneous fuel

they are a good choice for the first stage in model evaluation. By “physics-based 
model” we mean that all modes of heat transfer (conduction, convection, radiation) 
present in both the fire-fuel and the fire-atmosphere interactions are modeled (in 
some approximation). These models are in their initial stages of development and 
validation. It is unlikely, due to their computational requirements, that they will 
replace present day operational models and approaches (e.g., McArthur meters, 
Nobel et al., 1980; BEHAVE, Andrews, 1986; Forest Service Fire Behavior Predictor, 
Hirsch, 1996; FARSITE, Finney, 1998) in the near future, at least in their present 
form. However, they do have the potential, in the near term, to provide reliable and 
detailed predictions of the behavior and effects of fire over a much wider range 
of conditions than operational models. Examples of near term research orientated 
applications include assessing the effect of fire on vegetation during prescribed 
burns, the response of a fire to a given fire break or thinning strategy, and furthering 
our understanding of the behavior and spread of fires through the intermix of 
structural and vegetative fuels that characterize the wildland urban interface (WUI). 
Fire models can be classified into three types (e.g., see Pastor et al., 2003): 
empirical, semi-empirical, or physics based (here we use “physical” and “physics 
based” interchangeably). Empirical models involve no physical modeling since 
they are based on statistical correlations of a given experimental data set. 
Semi-empirical models are based on energy conservation but do not distinguish 
between the different modes of heat transfer (conductive, convective, radiative). 
Physics-based models (such as FIRETEC and WFDS) attempt to solve (in some 
approximation) the equations governing fluid dynamics, combustion, and heat 
transfer. A complete, physics-based, wildland fire simulation must include 
approximations for the fire/atmosphere and the fire/fuel interactions  
Section 15.2 provides an overview of the approaches used in the FIRETEC and 
WFDS models. Measurements from Australian (AU) grassland fire experiments 
can be used for model evaluation. These experiments are described in Section 15.3. 
WFDS predictions of the head fire spread rate and fire perimeters are compared 
to the AU grassland fire experiments in Sections 15.4.1  15.4.3. To date similar 
comparisons have not been made with FIRETEC. For this reason, in Section 15.4.4 
WFDS simulations were conducted of tall grass fires that match, as much as possible, 
the conditions of FIRETEC simulations reported in Linn and Cunningham (2005). 
This allowed a comparison of to be made of the two models. Finally, in Section 15.5 
a summary of the findings is given. 
15.2 Overview of the FIRETEC and WFDS Numerical  
Models 
FIRETEC has been developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory (LANL) by 
Linn and colleagues (Linn 1997, Linn et al. 2002). FIRETEC provides fire spread 
predictions over landscape and requires significant computational resources (multiple

processors). The governing model equations are based on ensemble averaging of 
the conservation equations for mass, momentum, energy, and chemical species. 
This results in additional closure equations which require a number of turbulence 
modeling assumptions. The numerical time stepping scheme explicitly handles 
the high frequency acoustic waves (Reisner, 2000). Chemical heat release from 
the combustion process occurs only in computational grid cells that contain the 
solid fuel (Linn et al., 2002). For grid cell dimensions that are smaller than the 
flame length this is unrealistic and improvements are underway (Colman and Linn, 
2003). Combustion is the result of a reaction rate that is a function of the density 
of both the solid fuel and the gas phase reactants, and an ad-hoc Gaussian-shaped 
probability density function (PDF) of the temperature. The use of this PDF is 
physically motivated but not yet validated. An assumed fraction of the heat 
produced by combustion is deposited in the solid fuel to help sustain pyrolysis. 
The solid fuel is assumed to be thermally thin. Thermal radiation transfer is 
computed using a diffusional transport approximation adapted from Stephens 
(1984). There is not, in the results reported to date, a model for the solid phase 
that handles pyrolysis which is coupled, through resolved heat fluxes, to a separate 
model for the gas phase which handles combustion. Instead, the pyrolysis of the 
solid phase and heat release from combustion in the gas phase are lumped 
together. This is the most significant difference (from a physical modeling point 
of view) between FIRETEC and other approaches, including WFDS. 
WFDS is an extension of Fire Dynamics Simulator (FDS), a product of the 
National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) (McGrattan, 2004; 
McGrattan and Forney, 2004). The development of FDS started in the 1980’s and 
it was created to simulate structural fires in a computationally efficient manner. It 
can be run on single processor desktop computers or on multiple processors and 
on a range of operating systems. FDS is currently used worldwide by 100s of fire 
protection engineers for structural fires and can be downloaded free. Smokeview, 
a companion software package, was also developed at NIST to interactively 
visualize FDS results (Forney and McGrattan, 2004). A survey of validation 
studies of FDS given in McGrattan (2004). The solution of the governing 
equations is based on basic large eddy simulation concepts as first presented by 
Smagorinsky (1963). Recently, modifications to FDS were begun to handle fire 
spread through vegetative fuels (Rehm et al., 2003; Mell et al., 2007a) with the 
goal of simulating fire spread in an intermix of vegetative and structural fuels 
(i.e., WUI fires). This modified version of FDS is called WFDS and is used here 
to simulate grassland fires. Application of WFDS to elevated fuels has also begun 
(e.g., Mell eta al., 2007c). A websie, Mell et al. (2007b), provides information on 
the ongoing experimental and modeling work at NIST in WUI fires. WFDS uses 
a low Mach number approximation to the governing equations developed by 
Rehm and Baum (1978. This approximation, which has been applied successfully 
to a wide range of fire and combustion problems, and the use of a fast direct solver 
for the pressure, results in computational speeds that are 10  100 times faster

than many other methods. The gas and vegetative phases are handled separately on 
different grids. The combustion model uses the well established mixture fraction 
based approach that assumes the fuel and oxygen react instantaneously over time 
scales characteristic of the flow (Bilger, 1980). The solid fuel is assumed to be 
thermally thin. Radiative and convective heat transfer within the fuel bed is directly 
modeled in manner similar to Albini (1985) and Morvan and Dupuy (2004). The 
pyrolysis model of Morvan and Dupuy (2004) is used. Char oxidation is not included. 
Thermal radiation transfer in the gas phase is computed with a finite volume based 
solver (Raithby and Chui, 1990). In the fuel bed a forward-reverse approximation 
(Ozisk, 1973; Mell and Lawson, 2000) is used for radiation transfer. Details on the 
model equations, numerical algorithm, and the approach used for igniting the 
solid fuel are given in Mell and Jenkins. (2007a), as are additional simulation 
results. Mell et al. (2007a) also provide a review of other physics-based models.  
15.3 Overview of Grassland Fire Experiments 
The experimental results and data used here were reported in Cheney et al. (1993) 
and Cheney and Gould (1995). The grassland fires were started by line fires, of 
varying lengths, along a fire break on the upwind edge of a grassland plot. One of 
two types of grass was present on a given plot: either Eriachne burkittii (kerosene 
grass) or Themeda australis (kangaroo grass). These two grasses differed in their 
structural and growth characteristics. In the models, however, physical differences 
in the fuel bed are accounted for only by the solid phase parameters listed in 
Table 15.1. The grassland plots measured 100100 m, 200200 m, or 200300 m 
and were surrounded by fuel breaks. At each corner of a plot the wind magnitude was 
measured every 5 s at a height of 2 m above the ground. Aerial photos and ground 
observations were used to obtain fire perimeters, head fire widths, and quasi-steady 
head fire spread rates. Figure 15.1(a) shows a photo of experiment F19 (see Section 
15.4.3) and Fig. 15.1(b) shows a snapshot from a WFDS prediction of the experiment.

The following empirically based formula (Equation 4 in Cheney et al., 1998) 
relates the experimentally observed head fire spread rate Ro (m·s–1), to the wind 
speed U2 (m·s–1) at a 2 m height, the head fire width W (m), and the fuel moisture

Cheney et al. (1998) defined the effective head fire width as the width of the 
fire, measured at right angles to the direction of head spread (and thus at right 
angles to direction of the wind at the head fire), which influenced the shape and  
size of the head fire during the next period of spread measurement (Cheney and 
Gould, 1995). The effective width of the head fire can also be defined as that portion 
of the perimeter where the flames are leaning towards unburnt fuel. In WFDS the 
head fire width was defined to be the distance between the flank fires one fire depth 
upwind of the trailing edge of the head fire. Figure 15.2 is a schematic showing, 
for an arbitrary fire perimeter, the head width, head-fire depth, and ignition line 
fire. For a sufficiently large head fire width the observed spread rate, Ro, obtained

In this Chapter, simulated spread rates and head fire location from WFDS were 
compared to their experimentally observed values through the use of these empirical 
relations.  
15.4 Approach and Results 
This is the first comparison of FIRETEC and WFDS. As such, the primary objective 
is to assess how well the models predict experimentally observed trends of 
macroscopic behavior. FIRETEC simulations of the AU grassland experiments 
are not available at this time, so only comparisons of WFDS simulations and AU 
grassland fires appear here (see Sections 15.4.1  15.4.3). Comparisons between 
FIRETEC and WFDS were accomplished by running simulations of fire spread in 
the tall grass fuels reported by Linn and Cunningham (2005) (see Section 15.4.4). 
The authors feel it is important to compare both models against the AU grassland 
fire data in future experiments, and consider that such a comparison is a logical 
next step in the comparison of the models. 
Table 15.1 lists the environmental parameters used in the simulations of fire  
in AU grasslands and tall grass. Parameters that were not measured in the AU 
experiments were determined from sources in the literature (Mell Jenkins., 2007a).

Two AU experiments, each with a different grass, were considered. In Table 15.1, 
and in the following text, the two experiments are denoted F19 (natural Themeda 
grass) and C064 (cut, with cuttings removed, Eriachne grass). 
15.4.1 Head Fire Spread Rate Dependence on Wind Speed in AU 
Grassland Fuel (WFDS only) 
Four wind speeds, U2, were used in the simulations: U2 1 m·s–1, 3 m·s–1, 4 m·s–1, 
5 m·s–1. For each wind speed there were four different ignition line fires were used (a 
total of 16 cases) lengths: Lig 8 m, 25 m, 50 m, 100 m. Ignition lines with lengths 
of Lig 8 m and 25 m had a depth of 6.7 m; ignition lines Lig 50 m and 100 m had 
a depth of 3.3 m. The grassland fuel characteristics were those of experiment F19 in 
Table 15.1. The initial wind speed depends on height, z, above the ground according 
to a power law to approximate a boundary layer (Morvan and Dupuy, 2004):

(15.3) 
Here U2,I is the value in WFDS of the initial wind speed at a height of 2 m. As 
the simulation proceeds, the wind speed at this height is modified by the fire (due 
to both entrainment and blockage effects) and by drag from the grass. When 
comparing head fire spread rates from WFDS simulations and from Eq. (15.1) a 
consistent value of U2 must be used. In WFDS U2 is the average value of the 
windward velocity, over the course of the simulation, in the first cell above the 
vegetation at the center of the ignition line-fire. The height of this velocity location 
is within z 1.95  2.1 m for the simulation cases reported here. Simulations   
with a number of grid resolutions and domain sizes were conducted to ensure 
that the results were not significantly influenced by grid resolution or boundary 
effects. All the WFDS simulations used an overall computational domain area of 
15001500 m with a 200200 m grassland plot in the center. The height of the 
computational domain was 200 m. The horizontal grid for a central 300300 m 
area containing the grassland plot was x y 1.66 m; outside this central area 
x y 3.33 m. The vertical grid was stretched from z 1.4  5.5 m at a height 
of 200 m throughout the computational domain. Figure 15.3 is a plot of head fire 
spread rate versus wind speed. The physical parameters of the fuel are listed in 
Table 15.1. Spread rates from WFDS (symbols), BEHAVE (Andrews, 1986) (solid 
line) and Eq. (15.2) (dashed line) are shown. 
As will be seen below, in Fig. 15.4, WFDS spread rates for Lig 50 m quickly 
reached a quasi-steady value. The linear dependence of the spread rate on the 
wind speed is well predicted by WFDS. The quantitative agreement of WFDS is 
also good, however it is important to note that the sensitivity of WFDS to 
realistic variations in environmental variables (wind speed, moisture content, etc.) 
has not yet been assessed. Another important issue is how the value of the wind

speed, U2, is obtained. WFDS and both Eqs. (15.1) and (15.2) use a value of U2 
that is the average wind speed at a height of approximately 2 m. This value of the 
wind speed was used to obtain BEHAVE results in Fig. 15.3. However, in 
BEHAVE the default height of the wind speed is at the mid-flame height. 
Experimentally observed flame heights, for U2 5 m·s–1, were 2.7 m for this fuel. 
This suggests that the wind speed input into BEHAVE should be larger, leading 
to a prediction of even faster spread rates than plotted in Fig. 15.3. BEHAVE’s 
over prediction of the spread rate for fuels with a surface-to-volume ratio of 
13100 m–1, which is a relatively fine fuel similar to the fuel used here, has been 
noted before, Gould (1988).

15.4.2 Head Fire Spread Rate Dependence on the Head Fire Width

Figure 15.4(a) below shows the fire spread rate versus the head fire width on the 
left from WFDS simulations with U2 1 m·s–1 and the four different lengths 
(Figs. 15.4(b)  15.4(e)) of the ignition line fire. The solid line is the spread rate 
from Eq. (15.1). The simulations reproduced the trend of an increasing head fire 
spread rate with an increasing width of the head fire. All Lig cases reach a quasi- 
steady spread rate that is within 25% of the Eq. (15.2) value. The experimental 
fires, as described by Eq. (15.1), reached a quasi-steady spread rate at narrower 
head fires than the simulated fires. Figures 15.4(b)  15.4(e) are sequential snapshots 
of the burning region (shaded contours of the burning rate are shown) for each of 
the ignition line fire lengths used. Note that for the Lig 50 m and 100 m cases,

different Lig. Also shown in the left column are the width (dashed line) and depth 
(dotted line) of the head fire. In each case an initial time period of relatively rapid 
spread is present, followed by a slower spread rate. This initial rapid spread may 
depend on the ignition procedure. This issue needs to be investigated. Equation 
(15.1) is implemented, using head fire widths from WFDS, to determine the location 
of the head fire (circle symbols) at the end of the initial time period of rapid 
spread. For the cases with Lig 25 m, 50 m, and 100 m WFDS predictions of the 
head fire location agree well with Eq. (15.1). When Lig 8 m there is a period of 
time during which the head fire spread rate increases before reaching a quasi-steady 
value. The quasi-steady spread rate agrees well with Eq (15.1) at around t 110 s 
(i.e., the solid line and a line through the circles become roughly parallel). The head 
width (dashed line) at which the simulated head fire spreads in a quasi-steady 
manner is approximately Wı65 m (note Fig. 15.4(a) shows similar results for 
U2 1 m·s–1). This is consistent with experimental observations that spread rates 
are relatively unaffected by Lig when Lig is sufficiently large. The head fire width 
is constant with time for Lig 100 m. Cheney and Gould (1995) noted at their 
highest wind interval between 4.7 m·s–1 and 7.1 m·s–1 the head fire width of more 
than 125 m in open grassland is required to get spread rates within 10% of the 
quasi-steady rate of forward spread. 
Figure 15.5 (right column) shows the fire perimeter at 60 s intervals. The relatively 
high wind speed results in head fire depths (10  12 m) that are greater than the 
flank fire depths (5  7 m). This does not occur in the weak wind case (U2 1 m·s–1 
in Figs. 15.4b  e). This behavior is consistent with field observations. Field 
measurements of the head fire depth for Lig 175 m and U2 4.9 m·s–1 range 
from 6.5  10. 5 m. Fire depths were interpreted from oblique photographs which 
were corrected and plotted onto a planar map of time isopleths of fire perimeter 
and fire depth. 
15.4.3 Case Studies—Fire Perimeter in AU Grassland Fuel  
(WFDS only) 
The mechanism of fire spread can change along the fire perimeter depending on 
the wind speed. In zero ambient wind, entrainment by the fire creates a local 
wind into which the entire fire line spreads (backing fire). In the presence of an 
ambient wind the downwind portion of the fire perimeter spreads with the wind 
(heading fire), the upwind portion of the fire perimeter spreads into the wind 
(backing fire), and the sides or flanks of the fire perimeter spread under conditions 
that can alternate between heading and backing fires. Note that in the cases 
considered here there are no backing fires since ignition occurred along the fire 
break at the upwind border of the plot. Backing fires, in which the flame tends to 
tilt away from the unburned fuel, can consume the fuel from the base upward, 
www.ebook3000.com

 
Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
220 
resulting in more complete fuel consumption. Heading fires, in which the flame 
tilts toward the unburned fuel, can be associated with lower fuel consumption 
because the grass ignites at the top and burns downward, covering the unburned 
fuel beneath with a protective coating of ash. The spread mechanism in flank fire 
can involve, depend on the fire/wind interaction, both the burning downward 
mechanism of head fires and the burning upward mechanism of backing fires. Thus, 
predicting the evolution of the entire fire line is much greater challenge, due to 
variation along the fire line of the fire/wind interaction and spread mechanisms, 
than predicting the behavior of just the head fire. 
Neither FIRETEC nor WFDS can directly resolve the details in the grass fuel 
bed that differentiate a backing fire from a heading fire since the entire fuel bed 
is unresolved on the computational grid. For example, the height of the first grid 
cell in WFDS is 1.4 m while the height of the grass is 0.51 m. However, the 
fire/atmosphere interactions that occur over scales on the order of a few meters 
can be resolved. It is hoped that this level of resolution of the fire physics will be 
sufficient to capture the dynamics of the entire fire perimeter. It is important that a 
three-dimensional model predict the behavior of the entire fire perimeter. Otherwise, 
the overall heat release rate (HRR), fuel consumption, and smoke generation will 
be (to some degree) incorrectly predicted. These global fire characteristics are 
particularly important inputs to regional smoke transport models. In addition, the 
mechanisms behind extreme fire behavior (such as blow ups) are still poorly 
understood. A model that simulates the behavior of the entire fire perimeter, as 
opposed to only the head fire, is more likely to shed light on these issues. 
In this section, model predictions of fire perimeters from two experimental cases 
are presented. In the first experiment, called F19, the ignition line fire is 175 m 
long. This line fire was created with drip torches carried by two field workers 
walking for 56 s (87.5 m) in opposite directions from the center point to the ends 
the line fire. The average wind speed, measured at the corners of the 200200 m 
plot and not including measurements influenced by the fire, equaled 4.9 m·s–1. In 
the second experiment considered, called C064, the ignition line is 50 m long. 
The average wind speed was 4.6 m·s–1. Fuel bed characteristics are given in 
Table 15.1 for both experiments. Figure 15.6 shows the leading edge of the fire 
perimeter from the experiments (symbols) and the entire fire bed from WFDS 
(shaded contours of the burning rate) at three different times. 
Experiment F19 is shown in Fig. 15.6 (a). A wind shift occurs in the experiment 
after t 86 s which breaks the symmetry of the fire perimeter, this does not occur 
in WFDS since a constant wind orientation is assumed at the inflow boundary. As 
expected from the previous results, the spread of the head fire is well predicted at 
all times. Before the wind shift, the predicted fire perimeter closely matches the 
measured fire perimeter. After t  86 s it’s not clear how well WFDS performs 
because the wind shift significantly changes the observed fire perimeter. Also, 
long flanking fires (as, for example, those shown in Fig. 15.5) do not develop for 
this case because the flank fires reach the fire breaks relatively quickly.

(shaded contours). Experiment F19 (a) and experiment C064 (b). See text for 
details and Table 15.1 for fuel/environmental parameters 
Experiment C064 is shown in Fig. 15.6(b). Extended flank fires do develop in 
this case. WFDS over predicts the spread rate of the flank fires. The reasons for 
this are the subject of ongoing model development efforts. The current version of 
WFDS does not faithfully model the upward spread mechanism that can be 
present in flank fires. Instead, the fire burns downward through the grassland fuel 
bed everywhere along the perimeter. Also, in the field the depths of flank fires 
are significantly smaller than head fire depths for this experiment. The horizontal 
grid resolutions used here (1.66 m) adequately resolve the head fire depth but this 
may not be the case for the flank fires. 
15.4.4 Simulation of Tall Grass (FIRETEC and WFDS) 
Linn and Cunningham (2005) simulated fire spread in a fuel similar to the tall 
grass NFFL standard model 3. The parameters of this grass fuel are listed in 
Table 15.2. Two different lengths of an ignition fire line were used, Lig 16 m, 
100 m and four different ambient wind speeds, constant with height, U 1, 3, 6, 
12 m·s–1. Six WFDS simulations were made: U 1, 3, 12 for each of the two Lig 
values. The results are listed in Table 15.2. The most significant difference in the 
two models was that backing fires (spreading upwind) and flank fires are more 
likely to occur, in a manner consistent with field observations, in WFDS. Figures 
15.7(a) and 15.7(b) show plots of the fire perimeter at different times for U 3 m·s–1 
and Lig 16 m and 100 m, respectively. Velocity vectors corresponding to the latest 
time, at a height of z 2 m, overlie the fire perimeters. Figures 15.8(a) and 15.8(b)

are plots for a higher ambient wind speed of U 6 m·s–1. Figures similar to 
Figs. 15.7 and 15.8 here are provided by Linn and Cunningham (2005). Their 
Figs. 3(a,b) and 4(a,b) correspond to Figs. 15.7(a,b) and 15.8(a,b) here. Backing 
fires are clearly seen in the WFDS for the slower wind speed cases in Fig. 15.7(a) 
and Fig. 15.7(b). Backing fires are also present in the faster wind speed cases of 
Fig. 15.8(a) and Fig. 15.8(b). However, for the shorter ignition line case 
(Fig. 15.8(a)) the backing fire was extinguished after t 50 s due to diminished 
heat transfer to the upwind fuel. 
For both FIRETEC and WFDS backing fires, when present, were more robust 
for the longer ignition lines. Field observations of backing fire behavior suggest 
that they are less likely to survive at higher wind speeds. This trend is not reproduced 
by FIRETEC, which was recognized by Linn and Cunningham (2005) and is 
under investigation. When a backing fire is not present in WFDS, as in case 
Lig 16 m, U 6 m·s–1 after t 50 s, a similar head fire shape, which is necked 
inward toward the centerline, is predicted by both WFDS and FIRETEC. Head 
fire spread rates could not be compared because the presence of backing fires in 
WFDS influence the wind at the head fire locations

15.5 Conclusions 
Findings from Australian grassland experiments were used to evaluate the physics 
based fire model, WFDS. Whenever possible, fuel and atmospheric parameters 
measured in the experiments were used in the simulation. The spread rates of 
head fires were well predicted by WFDS. Spread rates of flank fires appear to be 
over predicted, but only one AU grassland experiment with freely spreading 
flank fires has been considered to date. Backing fires were not present in the 
experiments because ignition occurred just downwind of a fuel break. FIRETEC 
simulations for the AU grassland fuels were not available. However, WFDS

simulations for fuels and conditions matching tall grass FIRETEC simulations 
(Linn and Cunningham, 2005) were run in order to compare results of the two 
models. Qualitatively the models produced similar results. The general trend, in 
observed grassland fires, of backing fires spreading more slowly as the ambient 
wind speed increased was not reproduced by FIRETEC. Both of these models are 
in their first stages of development and application to wildland fires. There is a 
great need for well documented full scale fires to aid further development in 
more complex fuel beds.

Abstract This paper addresses the development of a practical physics- 
based model for fires in the wildland-urban intermix. These fires arise when 
wildland burning invades the built environment. Fire models for ignition 
and spread must consider individual fuel elements of both vegetation and 
structures in order to assess fire risk of developed properties. The potential 
fuel loadings for various land uses demonstrates that structures can provide 
much higher loadings than wildlands do. However, the time scales for ignition 
and the heat release rates for the wildland fuel and the fuel in the structures 
will be widely disparate, influencing both the spread rate of the fire and its 
persistence. The NIST computational model known as the Fire Dynamic 
Simulator (FDS) was developed to study building fires. Its potential use to 
study community-scale fire spread is discussed.

16.1 Introduction 
The protection of structures in a community from destruction by fire is a national 
concern. Building codes and standards reduce the threat of fire by addressing the 
ways in which our communities can be built and the materials that can be used. 
Annually in the U.S. there are more than 300,000 fires that originate in homes. In 
addition, nearly 10% of the land and over one-third (42 million) of the homes in 
the U.S. today belong to the Wildland Urban Interface (WUI). The WUI is used 
to refer to both areas where housing abuts heavily vegetated areas (interface) and 
those areas where houses and vegetation are intermingled (intermix). If current 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
228 
trends in housing continue, the WUI will grow rapidly. 
Experiments and case studies of WUI fires conducted by Cohen (2000), (2001) 
have shown that, under the conditions of these experiments, fuels, either vegetation 
or structures, within about 40 meters distance from a home constitute a major 
threat for ignition. At this “neighborhood scale,” models and the computational 
resources are adequate to allow simulation of many of the details of fire behavior. 
These models require detailed data on the topography, local meteorology, building 
layouts and elevations, three-dimensional distributions of natural fuels, and the 
material properties of both the natural fuels and the structures. Predictions of fire 
spread that threaten structures is the goal. The results can be used to understand 
the risk to communities on a property-by-property basis.  
16.2 WUI Fuels 
In the WUI, structures and vegetation are intermixed and their 3D distribution 
must be taken into account. As both the duration and intensity of burning structures 
is much greater than for vegetation, WUI fires cannot be studied accurately as a 
type of 2D fuel bed through which fire spreads. Furthermore, the intense burning 
of WUI fires cannot be characterized as burning along a line or boundary. WUI 
fires are area fires in which structures can burn independently from the vegetation. 
Figures 16.1(a) and (b) show respectively a damaged area from the Oakland Hills, 
CA fire and burning during the Summerhaven, AZ fire. In both fires, it is obvious 
that trees and structures ignite and spread fire differently. In some areas homes 
burn while surrounding trees are uninvolved. The report of Murphy et al (2007) 
on the Angora Fire near Lake Tahoe, 24  26 June, 2007, shows that fire behavior 
at the WUI is different than it is in wildland fuels alone. It describes ignition of

structures by brands and by ground fire while nearby tree crowns remain untouched 
even under the prevailing very dry conditions. The fact that it is common in WUI 
fires to find homes totally destroyed adjacent to vegetation that is untouched 
illustrates the complicated nature of the WUI fire events. 
Only two references were found that discuss substantive technical issues related 
to wildland and community fires (Maranghides, 1993) and (Chandler et al., 1983). 
Maranghides attempts for the first time to combine analyses of ignition and spread 
of a fire in a vegetation fuel bed, commonly employed in current operational 
models, with a model for ignition of a structure. This simple and interesting 
physics-based approach is found to be limited by a lack of data, a problem also 
discovered by the authors of the present study.  
In the second, Chandler et al., (1983), in Chapter 8 entitled, “Fire at the Urban- 
Forest Interface,” make several very important observations. First, the authors note 
that fuel loadings in buildings are typically many times those in a forest: “the 
heaviest likely fuel load in the forest is less than the lightest load for a structure.” 
Next they observe that fuels in buildings include a variety of combustibles whereas 
forest fuels are exclusively cellulosic. The authors also point out several important 
differences between burning in a structure and burning forest fuels. Moisture, 
which is a very important factor in ignition and burning intensity, is controlled 
within a building, but is determined in wildlands by environmental factors such 
as the sun, wind and precipitation. Radiation from an indoor fire is trapped inside 
the building whereas most radiation in a wildland fire escapes. Similarly, most 
convective heat is trapped in an indoor fire whereas it is lofted into the atmosphere 
in a wildland fire. Finally, oxygen is severely limited in an indoor fire whereas it 
is virtually unlimited in a wildland fire.  
The first point concerning the potential fuel loading differences between 
structural and wildland fuels is illustrated in Fig. 16.2. In this figure, land use has 
been divided into four basic categories: wildland, rural, suburban and urban. The  
number of structures per hectare is plotted as the abscissa, and the ratio of the 
estimated vegetation energy load to the structure energy load is the ordinate. In 
this diagram, wildland covers the upper left corner of the diagram, where the number 
of structures is small and the vegetation energy load is relatively high, whereas 
the urban area occupies the lower right corner. Also shown on this plot are several 
fires for which we estimated, from information available, the potential energy load 
per hectare where the fires did their greatest damage to the built environment, 
whether the fires began there or elsewhere. Note that the Oakland Hills fire of 
1991 and the Los Alamos/Cerro Grande fire of 2000 fall directly in the category 
of suburban fires and are good examples of community-scale or WUI fires. Greater 
details about this analysis are available from (Rehm et al., 2002). 
In the suburban and urban setting, the key quantity is the density of 
houses—together with the combustible material in these houses and the ignition 
propensity—in determining fuel loading and fire behavior, see Rehm (2006). One 
of the most important parameters governing the physics of fire spread in wildland

including the Oakland Hills fire of 1991 and the Los Alamos/Cerro Grande fire of 2000 
material is the heat release rate (HRR) of all burning materials, including structural 
and wildland fuels. The density of trees, shrubs and ground cover (grass) is important 
for determination of the fire behavior, but clearly house density is critical. 
An estimate of the HRR during a house fire in the Oakland and Berkeley Hills 
fires was made by Trelles (1995) and by Trelles and Pagni (1997). According to 
these estimates, a house burns at a peak rate of 45 MW for 1 hour (yielding about 
160 GJ), and then dies down over another 6 hour period. The die-down of the fire 
is approximated as two steps, one 10 MW for 3 h and the last as 5 MW for 3 more 
hours. The total burn time is 7 hours, and the total energy released by the house is 
324 GJ. If the house is assumed to have a 15 m by 15 m footprint, then we estimate 
the total potential fuel loading per unit area to be 1.4 GJ/m2 and the peak HRR 
per unit planview area to be 0.20 MW/m2.  
For comparison Figs. 16.3(a) and 16.3(b) show the burning of a small (6.2 m 
by 5 m by 2.5 m) wood frame out building in Odenton, MD ignited by burning 
vegetation. Measurements of the total heat flux were made 16.6 m from the 
building. Assuming uniform hemispherical heat flux and 30 percent radiative 
fraction from the fire a preliminary estimate of the total heat production of the 
fire was calculated. From this analysis, the building fire was found to produce a 
sustained HRR of about 23 MW for approximately 5 minutes. The peak HRR per 
unit planview area was then approximately 0.74 MW/m2. The peak value for the 
HRR per unit area is much greater than the value estimated for homes in the 
Oakland Hills fire, but the fire duration is much shorter.

wood materials can change the characteristic HRR for a home by an order of 
magnitude. Chandler et al (1983) describe the concept of an “ideal” burning rate, 
which was first introduced by Tewarson and Pion (1976). The “ideal” burning rate 
is the rate at which the energy required to produce a unit mass of fuel gas is equal 
to the energy released by burning the fuel gases in air. At the “ideal” burning rate, 
energy lost from the burning surface equals that supplied from the flame and other 
sources. Tewarson and Pion (1976) tabulate the ideal burning rates for several fuels. 
Liquid hydrocarbons have ideal HRRs per unit area ranging between 0.7 MW/m2 
and 3.0 MW/m2. The corresponding rate for wood is about 0.26 MW/m2.  
The fuel-bed burning used in operational models suggests the use of the plan 
view area basis for comparing the burning of structures and wildland fuel. However, 
characterization of burning structures for WUI fire modeling remains to be resolved. 
16.3 Fire Model 
For wildland fires, mathematical models are regularly used to predict the likely 
burn development for expected meteorological conditions. These models, which 
are known as operational models, have largely developed through empirical 
correlations over the past few decades. In the United States, they include the 
Rothermel model, (Rothermel, 1972), and models known as BEHAVE, (Andrews 
and Bevins 1999), and FARSITE, (Finney and Andrews, 1999), with the last one 
being the most recent and most highly developed. 
Generally, these operational models have served well as long as the fires are 
confined to wildland fuels alone. They are based on the assumption that the fuels 
can be represented by continuum 2D beds, which may be inhomogeneous and 
anisotropic, but nevertheless are continuous. Thus these models can address 
horizontal variation of fuel beds, but cannot address 3D structure of fuels. Fire 
spread in fuels that include buildings and transitions from ground to crown fires 
are among the fire phenomena that cannot be analyzed using these models. For 
example, in the report on “Standard Fire Behavior Fuel Models…,” by Scott and 
Burgan (2005), urban development in the context of wildland fire models is 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
232 
regarded as “nonburnable” with “expected fire behavior: no fire spread.” There is 
no mention of fire spread in suburban areas where both wildland and structural 
fuels exist.  
When the built environment becomes involved in a fire, as in the Oakland and 
Berkeley Hills fire of October 21, 1991, or more recently the Los Alamos fires of 
May 2000 and Summerhaven, AZ of June 2003, these operational models are 
ineffective. The operational models cannot predict the spread of fire because the 
building fuel loads are larger and discrete. In these community-scale fires, buildings 
must be treated as discrete fuel elements. At a fundamental level, the physical 
mechanisms controlling fire spread are very different than those in wildland fires. 
The empirical correlations upon which the wildland-fire models have been developed 
are no longer valid, in part because the heat released by the burning structures 
influences how the fire spreads even in the wildland fuel, see Rehm (2006). No 
validated predictive models of fires in an urban or urban/wildland setting exist to 
our knowledge. 
Over the past 25 years, the Building and Fire Research Laboratory (BFRL) at 
the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has been developing a 
physics-based mathematical and computational model, the current version known 
as the fire dynamics simulator (FDS), to predict fire spread in a structure. Over the 
past few years, it has also been used to predict smoke and hot gas plume behavior 
produced by outdoor fires. FDS is well documented and is widely used by fire 
protection engineers around the world. BFRL is extending the model to include 
fire spread from structure to structure and generalizing FDS to include a means 
to predict fire spread in both continuous and discrete natural fuels. The current 
model, as well as its generalization, is both computationally and data intensive. 
For any specified region, the model requires high-resolution, 3D data to describe 
the geometry, fuels, and the ignition and burning characteristics. In addition, more 
recently, it has been used to predict wind fields in the built environment with one 
to ten meter resolution over regions measuring up to one kilometer or so on a side. 
All of these simulations require only a current high-end PC running overnight. 
The code can be downloaded free of cost from the URL: http://fire.nist.gov. It 
consists of two components, a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) code, called 
FDS, written in Fortran 90 for computation of fire-driven flows, and an OpenGL 
graphics program known as Smokeview for visualization of results, see McGrattan 
et al. (2000), McGrattan and Forney (2000), and Forney and McGrattan et al. (2000). 
A second fire modeling effort for wildland fuels alone is underway at the Los 
Alamos National Laboratory under the direction of Dr. Rodman Linn (2002). 
Both models can address the 3D structure of fuels. Linn’s model is currently 
being used to understand fire behavior in wildland fuels. Both models will need 
extensive 3D data on the properties of wildland fuels in order to calibrate and 
validate the model assumptions.   
FDS has been used to construct a simulation of burning and fire spread in the 
WUI that is useful for analyzing the fire hazards associated with a structure and

233
its surroundings. In FDS, structures and vegetation must be characterized as 
separate fuel elements with individual ignition and burning properties. As each 
element in the model can be modified, the value of actions taken by owners or 
land managers to reduce hazards can be analyzed. It is expected that when 
properly validated, using data yet to be obtained, FDS will be able to duplicate 
the well known fire spread characteristics in ground fuels, but will also have the 
capabilities of quantifying transitions of fire spread between fuel types. This 
includes the phenomena of transitions from ground fire to tree-crown fires as well 
as ignition and burning of structures intermixed with vegetation. Such a tool will 
be of value to community planners, building code authorities and firefighters.  
The capabilities of the FDS model can be demonstrated by an example. Figure 
16.4 shows a series of frames from an FDS simulation of fire spread on a parcel 
of land. These frames were obtained using the Smokeview visualization software, 
also developed at NIST. Four structures, many trees, and shrubs have all been 
included in this simulation. It can be seen that simulations of fire events on the  
 
Figure 16.4 Selected frames from FDS / Smokeview simulation of “neighbourhood 
scale” fire spread from a single ignition. The fire spreads from ground fuels (grass), 
through ladder fuels (shrubs around houses) to the tree-crowns. Structures are 
ignited by heat flux from the burning vegetation. The time shown is the burn time 
for extremely dry fuels 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
234 
“neighborhood scale” are now possible. For the simulation, ignition and burning 
characteristics for each of the fuel elements–ground surface, shrubs, trees and the 
homes were selected. The selection of these properties was guided by experiments 
and other experience. From a single ignition point, the model predicts where and 
how rapidly the fire will spread. It considers heat transfer by convection and 
radiation, sensible and latent heat of pyrolysis absorption by material, ignition 
conditions for materials, the consumption of mass by burning, smoke generation, 
smoke blocking of radiation from fires, and the effect of wind. Fire spread by 
brands is not included in the current model. It is known that structures have a 
greater ignition delay time and total burning time than wildland fuels. The long 
burning structures distributed over an extended area produce plumes that can 
substantially change the wind patterns and therefore the spread of the fire front at 
some distance from the structures (Trelles and Pagni, 1997), (Rehm, 2006). 
Even though the graphical representation of the result is realistic, it should be 
remembered that underlying the pictures at every position (to the limit of the cell 
size in the computation) the gas and surface temperatures, gas velocity, heat flux, 
and materials burning can be quantified for each time step in the simulation. 
There is an enormous amount of detailed information available from the model. 
It is common to view the results as computer generated simulations and gain 
insight from the viewing as one would from seeing an actual fire event. 
The “neighborhood scale” fire simulations using FDS have the capability to 
provide authorities with insight about the fire safety in communities. The simulations 
can also be used to assess the impact of changing local regulations. The physical 
science basis for the FDS model provides confidence that even without the benefit 
of comparison with full-scale urban fire experiments, it is capable of providing 
relative quantitative results between alternatives and accurate predictions of trends. 
16.4 Conclusions 
Through the capabilities to simulate the major features of WUI fires, we are 
beginning to develop an understanding of the mechanisms by which fires progress 
in a community where both structures and wildland fuels exist. Except for 
investigations of actual community fires, we have not previously had a technology 
that was capable of providing the fire safety insight that can be obtained from 
physics-based, high temporal and spatial resolution simulations. Many fire-properties 
of vegetation and structures remain to be measured in ways that permit the 
description of the ignition and burning of individual trees, shrubs, and structures. 
All methods of fire propagation, including spread by brands, need to be quantified 
to build a complete and accurate model of the WUI fire. Experimental data for 
ignition and fire spread for individual elements and the collective fuel layout are 
needed to calibrate and validate such high-resolution fire models.

Abstract The federal agencies of the United States (US) are currently 
developing guidelines for critical nitrogen loads for US forest ecosystems. 
These guidelines will be used to establish regulations designed to maintain 
nitrogen inputs below the level shown to damage forests and streams. 
Traditionally, an ecosystem is considered to be at risk for health impairment 
when the critical nitrogen load exceeds a level known to impair forest health. 
The excess over the critical nitrogen load is termed the exceedance, and the 
larger the exceedance, the greater the risk of ecosystem damage. This definition 
of critical nitrogen load applies to a single, long-term pollutant exposure. 
Unfortunately, a single critical nitrogen load level may not accurately reflect 
ecosystem health risk when an ecosystem is subjected to multiple environ- 
mental stresses. In other US regions, fire is a major component of the forest 
ecosystem. Fire volatilizes organic nitrogen, reduces plant nitrogen uptake, 
increases nitrogen mineralization and nitrification, and can change the pH 
level of surface horizons. If multiple stress impacts (i.e., drought and fire) 
are included in critical nitrogen load assessments, critical nitrogen load may 
need to be lowered in many areas. This paper explores how fire and climate 
change and variability influence ecosystem critical nitrogen loads. 
Keywords Critical load, nitrogen, United States, forests 
17.1 Introduction 
Air borne nitrogen (N) from industry and automobile exhaust has been falling 
across Europe and New England for over 60 years in the form of acid rain. 
Heavily polluted areas can receive over 50 kg·N·ha–1 each year (Holland et al., 
2005). The environmental impacts of air pollutants have been studied since nitrogen 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires

was first suspected to cause forest damage and decline across the region in the 
mid 1980s. High pollutant levels and forest mortality can lead to leaching of soil 
aluminum (Al) and nitrate (NO3) (Cronan and Schofield, 1979; Berg, 1986; 
Johnson et al., 1994) and subsequent increases in stream Al and NO3. Increased 
Al and NO3 stream concentrations can have negative health impacts on fish 
populations and human water supplies (Baker et al., 1996). Too much nitrogen in 
trees can also cause aluminum toxicity in roots (Shortle and Smith, 1988), foliar 
nutrient imbalance (Zoettl and Huettl, 1986; Cronan and Grigal, 1995), reduced 
tree cold tolerance (Sheppard, 1994), and tree freezing injury (DeHayes, 1992). 
Each of these stressors can lead to tree mortality (Aber et al., 1989; McNulty et 
al., 2005). 
Traditionally, an ecosystem is considered to be at risk for health impairment 
when its critical nitrogen load exceeds a level known to impair forest health. 
Deposition in excess of the critical nitrogen load is termed the nitrogen exceedance, 
and the larger the nitrogen exceedance, the greater the risk of ecosystem damage. 
This definition of critical nitrogen load applies to a single, long-term pollutant 
exposure. However, a static critical nitrogen load level may not accurately assess 
ecosystem risk to damage when an ecosystem is subjected to multiple, episodic 
environmental stresses. If multiple stress impacts (i.e., climate change and variability 
and fire) are included in critical nitrogen load assessments, critical nitrogen load 
may need to be lowered in many areas to maintain long-term ecosystem health. 
Various methods have been designed to test the critical nitrogen load of an 
ecosystem. One of the most popular methods for determining an ecosystem’s 
critical load is the use of a simple mass balance equation. The simple model uses 
static soil, climate, vegetation, and pollutant deposition data to estimate an 
ecosystem’s critical load. We will examine how climate change and fire could 
alter each of the ecosystem parameters used in a simple mass balance equation 
for critical nitrogen loading.  
17.2 Climate Change Impacts on Critical Loads 
Climate change is a generic termed used to define a host of changing environmental 
conditions associated with the atmospheric increase of “greenhouse” gases and 
global warming. Climate change is characterized by both climatic shifts and 
increased climate variability. Both inter-decadal shifts in climate and inter-annual 
climate variability can influence the critical nitrogen load of an ecosystem. 
17.2.1 Drought 
Water is one of the principle determinants of ecosystem type. Average annual 
precipitation in temperate forests ranges from 50  250 cm per year. Deserts, 
www.ebook3000.com

17 Climate Change and Fire impacts on Ecosystem Critical Nitrogen Load 
239
scrubland, and woodlands receive between 0 cm and 125 cm of precipitation per 
year (Whittaker, 1970). Millennia of plant competition have favored vegetative 
species that best adapt to limited resources (including water).  
Short-term (i.e., less than two years) drought can cause reduced ecosystem 
productivity (Hanson, 2000), reduced leaf longevity in deciduous species (Jonasson, 
1997), and reduced leaf area (Gholz, 1990). These factors reduce biological demand 
for nitrogen. Under extreme drought, reduced soil moisture can cause reduced 
nitrogen mineralization and nitrification that then result in reduced ammonium 
and nitrate availability. These conditions will cause little short-term impact on 
critical nitrogen load if both nitrogen demand and supply are reduced. However, 
nitrogen deposition will continue to accumulate in the ecosystem, and a nitrate 
pulse could occur following a drought if nitrogen mineralization and nitrification 
rates respond more quickly to available water than plant demand for nitrogen.  
Long-term (i.e., greater than two years) droughts can cause additional ecosystem 
disruptions, and therefore have the potential to significantly lower ecosystem 
critical nitrogen load levels. Long-term droughts have all of the characteristics of 
short-term drought (described above) plus the potential for tree mortality due to 
water stress (Kloeppel, 2003), increased insect outbreak potential (Mattson, 1987), 
and increased fire risk (Flannigan and Wotton, 2001). As with the short-term 
drought, long-term drought may reduce biological nitrogen demand and supply. 
Additionally, the potential for terrestrial vegetation mortality could lead to a 
significant decrease in biological nitrogen demand. If tree mortality is severe, a 
large nitrate pulse could occur following the drought, similar to the nitrogen 
pulse observed following forest harvesting (Vitousek, 1985). 
The critical nitrogen load may be significantly reduced for several years after 
drought-induced forest mortality, because new growth cannot fully utilize existing 
water, light, and nutrients. For example, in the Southern Appalachian Mountains 
a combination of drought, increased air temperature, and insects likely caused the 
mortality of mature high elevation red spruce (Picea rubens) trees. The critical 
pollutant load level for this area will be reduced until new growth can fill in gap 
openings and increase biological nitrogen demand. 
17.2.2 Climate Change Shifts in Water Availability 
Both short- and long-term droughts are transient weather events. However, climate 
change is a permanent shift in the amount and timing of precipitation for a region. 
Changes in tree species, nutrient cycling, and water flow are all likely with climatic 
shifts. Reductions in precipitation would cause a shift toward more open, drought 
tolerant woodlands (Hansen, 2001). As tree density decreases, nitrogen demand 
and uptake by vegetation decreases. Therefore, the critical nitrogen load for an 
ecosystem receiving less precipitation would likely decrease. Conversely, the critical 

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
240 
nitrogen load could increase if climate change causes an increase in precipitation, 
along with a shift toward more dense forests with higher nitrogen demands.  
Long-term precipitation change-induced forest species shifts can also change 
the nitrogen cycle. Mesic tree species have a tendency to be more nitrogen 
demanding (Watmough, 2004). Therefore, increased precipitation could gradually 
shift a forest toward a higher critical nitrogen load. 
17.2.3 Increased Air Temperature 
During the next century, substantial changes are expected to occur in a variety of 
environmental variables including temperature. The magnitude of these changes 
is expected to vary temporally and spatially. The intergovernmental panel on climate 
change (IPCC) concluded that average global surface temperature is projected  
to increase by between 1.4ć and 5.8ć above 1990 levels by 2100 (Houghton  
et al., 2001).  
While all general circulation models predict that the earth will warm over the 
next century, the degree and distribution of the warming is not clear (Houghton et 
al., 2001). The disagreement about warming is largely due to uncertainty regarding 
reductions in green house gas emissions and model design and use (Thorning, 
1998; USGCRP, 2001).  
Biological processes accelerate as air temperature increases. Increases in tree 
respiration and metabolism can shorten leaf retention time as temperature increases. 
Litter decomposition, soil nitrogen mineralization, and soil nitrification also 
increase with increasing temperature. Increases in both nitrogen demand and supply 
can offset each other, and the critical nitrogen load may not change. However, if 
tree nitrogen demand does not keep pace with nitrogen availability, then critical 
nitrogen loads could decrease with increasing air temperature.  
17.3 Fire Impacts on Critical Pollutant Loads 
Fires can be either controlled or wild; both types can impact an ecosystem’s critical 
pollutant load, but in different ways. Therefore, the critical nitrogen load impact 
of each type of fire will be discussed separately.  
17.3.1 Wildfire Impacts on Critical Loads 
From 1994  2004, an average of 4 million acres of forestland was burned by 
wildfire every year, and most of these fires occurred in the Western US (NIFC, 
2005). Over 50 years of fire suppression have led to a significant accumulation of

17 Climate Change and Fire impacts on Ecosystem Critical Nitrogen Load 
241
fire fuels across the Eastern US (Brown et al., 2004). Climate change can impact 
the likelihood of wildfires due to warmer air temperatures (Fried et al., 2004), 
increased lightning strikes (Price and Rind, 1994) and changed atmospheric synoptic 
patterns (i.e., movement of the jet stream, Heilman et al., 1997). Increased fuel 
loads and global warming have resulted in an increase in area burned, with over 
8 million acres burned in both 2004 and 2005 (NIFC, 2005). Both controlled burns 
and wildfires significantly impact forest structure and function, which in turn affect 
the critical nitrogen load of the ecosystem.  
Low impact wildfires can influence critical load levels in ways similar to a 
controlled burn. High impact wildfires can significantly alter ecosystem structure 
and function for many years (NWCG, 2001) and can have both positive and 
negative impacts on ecosystem critical load levels.  
Short-term (i.e., less than 5 years) negative impacts of wild fires include the loss 
of soil cation exchange capacity (CEC) and organic matter (see Table 17.1) that 
reduce the ecosystem critical nitrogen load. Wildfires can burn hot enough to sterilize 
the soil and volatilize organic nitrogen, which then greatly reduces soil processes 
such as nitrogen mineralization (Table 17.1). Under these conditions, ammonium 
(NH4) deposition may be a significant source of nitrogen needed for plant 
regeneration while nitrate (NO3) deposition may be rapidly leached through the soil.

However, over the long-term (i.e., more than 5 years), intense wildfires can 
significantly increase the critical load limit of an ecosystem. Other macronutrients 
(e.g., magnesium (Mg), calcium (Ca), potassium (K), phosphorus (P)) generally 
increase with fire (both controlled and wild) (Table 17.1) as biomass is consumed 
and the inorganic elements are returned to the soil. An increase in macronutrients 
can stimulate plant growth, which increases plant demand for nitrogen and increases 
the long-term critical nitrogen load limit. For example, in Yellowstone national 
park wildfires initially destroyed much of the forest in 1988. Several years were 
required to re-establish the ecosystems, but now species diversity and forest growth 
have been restored to pre-burn conditions (Turner et al., 2003). Therefore, it is likely 
that critical load limits are now higher across the park than before the fire.  
17.3.2 Controlled Burn Impacts on Critical Loads 
To restore the natural ecosystem balance that existed before widespread fire 
exclusion in the United States, many land managers routinely implement controlled 
or prescribed burning on their forests. These burns can help to reduce fuel loads 
(Waldrop et al., 1987; Clinton et al., 1998), curb insect and disease infestations 
(McCullough et al., 1998), and release and recycle forest nutrients (Wan, 2001; 
Knoepp et al., 2004). Between 1995 and 2000, an average of over 1.4 million 
acres of controlled burning was conducted by federal agencies (NIFC, 2005). Air 
quality concerns, land fragmentation, and the integration of housing developments 
into forestland hamper land managers’ ability to effectively reduce fuel loads using 
controlled burns (Cleaves et al., 2000). Controlled burns can be very beneficial to 
an ecosystem.  
Over time, much of the macronutrients (e.g., Ca, Mg, P) needed to sustain 
forest growth can become incorporated into dead twigs, branches and wood, or in 
underbrush (McClaugherty et al., 1985). Controlled burns can reduce the amount 
of dead material and underbrush in an ecosystem and return nutrients back to the

soil, allowing tree roots to take up the returned nutrients. Increased macronutrient 
supply can significantly increase forest productivity (Thornton et al., 2000; Albaugh 
et al., 2004) and therefore increase the ecosystem’s critical nitrogen load. Reductions 
in underbrush can also increase the available soil water for the remaining forest 
trees. Increased water availability can also increase forest productivity and critical 
nitrogen load (Churkina, 1999). 
Unlike wild fires, controlled burns have little likelihood of significantly affecting 
soil organic matter, reducing soil CEC, sterilizing the soil, or significantly reducing 
forest nitrogen demand. Controlled burns have far fewer negative critical nitrogen 
load impacts compared to wild fires, while exhibiting the positive aspects of fire. 
Therefore, controlled burns should be considered as a tool for (generally) increasing 
ecosystem critical nitrogen load, whenever air quality would not exceed regulatory 
standards. 
17.4 Combined Impacts on Critical Pollutant Loads 
Thus far, we have only examined how climate change and fires can impact 
individual ecosystem parameters (e.g., soil pH, CEC and nitrogen mineralization, 
and tree nitrogen uptake). Now we will examine how combinations of changing 
ecosystem parameters impact an ecosystem’s critical load. Not all impacts from 
wild fires, controlled burns, or climate change and variability have a universally 
negative or positive impact on critical nitrogen loads (Table 17.2). For example, 
wildfires negatively impact critical nitrogen loads by generally reducing soil 
organic matter content and soil CEC. However, wildfires can also positively 
impact critical nitrogen loads by increasing soil pH and macronutrient content 
(Table 17.2). Also, the stress impacts are not universally negative or positive in 
all areas. For example, Binkley et al. (1992) found that controlled burns 
increased the C:N ratio in coastal pine organic horizon ecosystems (Table 17.1). 
However, Klopatek et al. (1991) found that controlled fire reduced the soil C:N 
ratio in pinyon-juniper ecosystems (Table 17.1). Therefore, controlled burns may 
increase the critical nitrogen load in one ecosystem while reducing it in another. 
This example illustrates the need to assess the impact of fire and climate change 
and variability on an individual ecosystem basis. Generalities are useful only in 
understanding how critical nitrogen loads of most ecosystems respond to fire and 
climate change and variability, not in predicting specific ecosystem impacts.  
It should not be surprising that the impacts of combinations of environmental 
stresses on critical nitrogen load limits are difficult to assess given the variability 
in individual ecosystem critical nitrogen load response to environmental stress. 
A single ecosystem may have a large change in its critical nitrogen load depending 
on the type and severity of non-nitrogen ecosystem stresses. For example, the 
base critical nitrogen load for an ecosystem, as calculated from a simple mass

balance equation, could equal 15 kg N ha–1 yr–1 (Fig. 17.1(a)). However, drought 
can significantly reduce available soil water and plant growth. In turn, reductions 
in plant growth reduce nitrogen uptake, which then reduce the ecosystem’s ability 
to use and store nitrogen. Therefore, under a drought, the same ecosystem may 
have its critical nitrogen load reduced to 10 kg N ha–1 yr–1 (Fig. 17.1(b)).  
Prolonged drought can reduce trees’ ability to produce secondary compounds 
such as oleoresin (Lorio, 1977). Without resin, insects have a much greater potential 
for successfully colonizing and causing tree mortality (Nebeker et al., 1993). In 
combination, a prolonged drought and subsequent insect attack could further reduce 
the critical nitrogen load of the ecosystem to 8 kg N ha–1 yr–1 (Fig. 17.1(c)).

Figure 17.1 Different critical nitrogen loads could be determined within the same 
ecosystem, given the type and severity of stress 
Dry conditions created by a drought and scattered dead trees (due to insect 
attack) are two important predisposing components for increasing wildfire risk 
(Mattson, 1987; Flannigan and Wotton, 2001). As previously discussed, wildfires 
can significantly reduce the critical nitrogen load of an ecosystem. Therefore, the 
same ecosystem that experiences drought, insect, and wildfire impacts may now 
only have a critical nitrogen load of 5 kg N ha–1 yr–1. 
As demonstrated by this example, there is no single critical nitrogen load level 
for any given ecosystem, even if nitrogen deposition levels remain constant. 
Land managers and policy makers need to recognize that whole ecosystem 
management is necessary if we wish to avoid exceeding an ecosystem’s ability to 
absorb nitrogen. A national scale critical nitrogen load assessment has yet to be 
completed. Therefore, it may be unrealistic to address the issue of a variable 
critical nitrogen load before a basic critical nitrogen load map is even available. 
However, we should begin to develop the research tools that will eventually 
allow state and federal policy makers to better assess the impacts of nitrogen 
deposition on ecosystem health and function.  
17.5 Conclusions and Future Research 
The impacts of climate change, and the associated increase in wild fire frequency 
and severity will very likely increase in coming years and decades. Cooler regions 
will likely see increases in forest productivity and nitrogen uptake as warming 
favors a longer growing season, increased nitrogen mineralization and other factors

favorable for plant growth. Conversely, currently warm or hot ecosystems will 
become even hotter. Increased evapotranspiration could reduce available soil 
moisture more quickly, and lead to reductions in forest growth, especially when 
coupled with the potential for increased fire.   
Without a steady state baseline of environmental conditions, the development 
of a ecosystem CL will be very difficult. Even simple mass balance equation 
estimates of critical nitrogen loads have been difficult to apply across large spatial 
scales. Accurate estimates of nitrogen mineralization and plant uptake are two of 
the most vexing problems. However, several forest process models (e.g., PnET, 
MAGIC) are now available for calculating these critical nitrogen loads. Forest 
process models may be very useful in increasing our ability to examine how multiple 
critical load parameters interact to affect an ecosystem’s critical nitrogen load. 
Continued progress in the development of more dynamic critical load estimates 
will reduce the potential for unexpected ecosystem degradation in the future.

Abstract Area-of-edge influence (AEI) is sometimes the dominant element 
of many forested landscapes. Patch vegetation dynamics can create a different 
fuel loading at the edge relative to the interior. We used the computer simulation 
model FARSITE to examine a fuel edge structural feature with scenarios 
from three levels of edge fuel loading to determine what impacts fuels in 
AEI have on fire spread by ranking all of the landscape scenarios. The mean 
burned area (ha) was significantly different among the landscapes after seven 
days. Fire spread increased by 38% with a high fuel loading assigned to the 
designated edge structure; while it decreased by 20% with medium edge fuel 
loading and 44% with low edge fuel loading. The landscape without edge 
structure (i.e., control) produced burned areas between the medium and the 
high edge fuel loading scenarios. The daily rate of fire spread was also

significantly affected by edge fuel loading. We encourage model users to 
include edge fuel in FARSITE fuel maps of highly fragmented forests. This 
study suggests that with on the ground fuel treatments, AEI can be manipulated 
to change the spread potential of large fires.

18.1 Introduction 
Area-of-edge influence (AEI, Chen et al, 1992) is common, and is sometimes the 
dominant element of many landscapes due to increased timber harvesting, road 
building, urbanization, and other land-use activities that cause fragmentation (Reed 
et al., 1996; Saunders et al., 2002; Watkins et al., 2003). Assessing the functional 
role of AEI’s for conservation and management can be difficult (Murcia, 1995). 
Recent research on AEI’s suggests that edges are an important landscape structural 
element for plants (Brosofske et al., 1999 and 2001; Euskirchen et al., 2001), birds 
and mammals (Yahner, 1988; Gustafson and Crow, 1994), and the biophysical 
environment (Chen et al., 1995). Edges have distinct microclimate and biomass 
from the interior forest (Matlack, 1993; Brosofske et al., 1997; Chen et al., 1999; 
Saunders et al., 1999). As a result edges could have a different fuel loading than 
the interior of forest patches. This unique fire fuel source may influence fire spread 
in a landscape. However, edges have rarely been examined with respect to their 
influence on larger ecosystem processes, such as fire spread, which can interact 
with many edges on a landscape scale (Harper et al., 2005). This study is designed 
to advance understanding of edge influence on fire spread by focusing on AEI as 
a unique fuel source in a fire simulation model. 
Patch dynamics in managed landscapes can create a different fuel loading at the 
edge relative to the interior, and are unique in space and time. From the time forest 
edges are created following disturbances (i.e., natural or from clear cutting) there 
are many primary and secondary processes, and plant structural responses occurring, 
including increases in decomposition, downed wood, recruitment, growth, mortality 
and understory cover. As forest edges age, the magnitude and depth-of-edge 
influence (DEI) change as the abiotic and biotic gradients between patch edge 
and interior seal, soften, or expand (Harper et al., 2005). Edge dynamics are also 
influenced by location, contrast, and orientation with respect to the sun and the 
direction of the prevailing winds (Geiger, 1965; Matlack, 1994; Zheng and Chen, 
2000). Edge dynamics may result in situations were fuel loading may be increasing 
or decreasing relative to the interior of the forest patches. Capturing these 
differences of AEI is obviously important if we want to model precise simulations 
of fire spread across the landscape. Since measuring the fuel loading in every 
AEI is labor intensive, we used the FARSITE (Finney, 1998) model in this study 

18 Simulating Fire Spread with Landscape Level Edge Fuel Scenarios 
269
with different fuel loading scenarios within the AEI to illustrate the importance 
of AEI in a managed landscape. Working on a FARSITE fuel map, a layer in a 
geographic information system (GIS), edges were delineated around four major 
fuel categories.  
At landscape scales, modeling fire spread is a preferable approach because fire 
is a destructive process, and field experiments can be prohibitive. Early on with the 
development of computers, modeling fire was found to be helpful in examining 
fire spread and behaviors (Rothermel, 1972; Frandsen, 1973; Albini, 1976). Since 
then, fire simulation models have advanced and include models of succession, 
such as FIRE-BGC (Keane et al., 1996), and models of fire behavioral prediction 
such as BEHAVE (Burgen, 1996). FARSITE is a powerful fire area simulation 
model that incorporates a GIS map so that fire spread can be studied at a larger 
landscape scale with spatial precision (i.e., spatially explicit). The model has 
been used to successfully examine fire at the landscape scale (Keane et al., 1999), 
and to examine various forest fuel treatment scenarios as management options in 
order to attenuate rates of fire spread and the levels of heat produced from wildfires 
in the Western United States (Finney, 2001; Stratton, 2004; Ryu et al., 2004), and 
to construct visualizations of fire/forest interactions in development of alternative 
landscape management options for decision makers (Wang et al., 2006).  
Model application, defined as using an existing model to address specific 
management questions about a particular case, is a good way to help guide 
management decisions (Ginzberg and Akcakaya, 2003). This study seeks to bring 
forest edge structure into the ecological simulation model FARSITE, where it has 
not been used before, as an example of model application to answer the 
management question: How would various fuel loading scenarios in the edge 
effect fire spread? To help understand the effects of AEI as a fuel structure on fire 
spread, FARSITE model simulations of surface fire in the Chequamegon national 
forest (CNF) in Northern Wisconsin were performed using existing databases  
of vegetation, weather, and topography. The CNF is an ideal landscape for 
studying edges because it is highly fragmented from long-term timber harvesting 
and recreational activities (Bresee et al., 2004) and has a rich field database 
(http://research.eeescience.utoledo.edu/lees/data/). 
The CNF has been used as a research landscape in numerous studies, such as 
field (Euskirchen et al., 2001), remote sensing (RS) (Bressee et al., 2004; Zheng 
et al., 2004), modeling (Zheng and Chen, 2000; Wang et al., 2005), and road 
effects (Sunders et al., 2002; Watkins et al., 2003). Edges are a particularly strong 
focus of study in this forest, including the effects of edges on soil respiration 
(Zheng et al., 2005), carbon storage (Rademacher, 2004), microclimate (Saunders 
et al., 1999), and plant distribution (Brosofske et al., 1999; Euskirchen et al., 
2001). However, the effect of edges as an additional fuel source on fire spread 
has not yet been undertaken. As a result this study was intended to make 
improvements to fire spread projections in the CNF by adding edge to the fuel 
classification map.

We hypothesized that adding edge fuels would significantly influence fire 
spread across the landscape, as measured by burned area. This hypothesis was 
developed not only because of the different possible fuel loading within the AEI, 
but also because the AEI has unique structure (i.e., linear and connected) in a 
landscape (Zheng and Chen, 2000). The results provided us with information on 
edges as a landscape element and their influences in a large fire event.  
Our overall objective was to use FARSITE to examine a fuel edge structural 
feature with scenarios from three levels of edge fuel loading to determine what 
impacts fuels in AEI have on fire spread by ranking all of the landscape scenarios. 
Additionally, the simulation results help mangers and modelers to make inferences 
about other landscape features with high connectivity, which may also be included 
in a modeled landscape such as roadsides, power line corridors, railroads, trails, 
or riparian zones. 
18.2 Methods 
18.2.1 Study Area 
The study area is located in the Washburn Ranger District of the Chequamegon 
national forest (CNF) in Northern Wisconsin (46e30'  46e45'N, 91e02'  91e22'W) 
USA. A previously classified Landsat land cover map was used as the study area, 
which is approximately 39,381 ha in size (Bresee et al., 2004). The landscape 
was reclassified into four nationally recognized fire fuel categories: 5 (brush), 8 
(Red Pine Pinus resinosa Ait.), 10 (northern hardwoods) and 11 (light logging 
slash) (Anderson, 1982). The topography is flat with gently rolling hills with 
elevations ranging from 232  459 m above sea level. This relatively flat topography 
helps eliminate elevational influences on fire spread and allows us to emphasize 
the effects of landscape structure (Fig. 18.1). 
18.2.2 Model Inputs 
FARSITE simulations require three major classes of variables: topography, 
vegetation properties and weather. Topographic variables include elevation, slope, 
and aspect and were obtained from the digital elevation model (DEM). Vegetative 
variables are canopy openness and fuel type. Canopy openness was derived by 
rescaling the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) values (0  1), 
calculated from the red and infrared channels of landsat 7 data (Rouse et al., 
1973) to 0%  100% by multiplying by a factor of 100. The fuel type was created 
by reclassifying the major habitats at the CNF (Bresee et al., 2004) into four 
nationally recognized fire fuel categories 5, 8, 10, and 11 (Anderson, 1982).

national forest, Wisconsin, USA, showing the model map with its fuel categories. 
Number 5 represents brush, 8 is used for Red Pine, 10 is hardwood, 11 is light 
logging slash, 20 is edge, and 98 is water 
The weather data were from a micrometeorological station located in the 
mixed northern hardwood habitat, which is the dominant habitat type in the CNF. 
The weather data was recorded on site for the month of April 2004, including 
temperature, precipitation, relative humidity, and wind (Noormets et al., 2004). 
Wind speed and direction at noontime was applied in our simulations (Bessie and 
Johnson, 1995). There was no precipitation during this seven-day period from 
April 3rd to the 10th. This eliminated any rain effects. In addition no roads, streams, 
barriers or fire suppression were used to impede fire spread. 
18.2.3 Simulations 
In the fuel layer all patches that were equal to or less than 0.36 ha in size 
(6060 m) were aggregated by using the best neighborhood method. Then we 
added a 30 m edge buffer on both sides of the patches as was recommended by 
Euskirchen et al., (2001) for this landscape, creating one edge structural feature, 
which forms a uniform 60 m wide belt on the simulated landscape. Landscape 
scenarios were assigned with one of three different custom fuel model numbers 
20, 21, or 22 placed in the edge feature. These fuel models were created using

FARSITE’s custom fuel editor to produce fuels with various loadings to place in 
the edge structure and were based on Anderson’s (1982) forest fuel model 
numbers 8 (closed timber litter), 9 (hardwood and conifer litter), and 10 (timber 
litter and understory), respectively. The custom fuels have the same initial fuel 
moistures and other basic characteristics as 8, 9, and 10; however, 8 was tuned 
down by a factor of 0.5 to produce the 1 hr, 10 hr, and 100 hr fuel loadings and 
the resulting fire spread that were used in custom fuel model number 20, and 9 
was tuned down by a factor of 0.5 to produce the loadings and rate of spread that 
were used in custom model 21, and 10 was tuned up by a factor of 1.5 to produce 
the loadings and resulting fire spread for model 22. Model numbers 8, and 10 
were used in our forest classification to represent non-edge forest patches; 
therefore the edge fuels represent low, medium, and high fuel loadings compared 
to these in terms of the resulting fire spread and flame lengths they produced 
(Table 18.1).

We produced a total of four landscapes, each with different compositions 
representing various scenarios of fuel loading in the edge: ķ The control or no 
edge fuel landscape classification with larger sized patches but no edge fuel 
structure defined having a total of four different fuels. ĸ The low edge fuel 
loading landscape with the same basic four fuels and an additional low loading 
custom fuel, number 20 in the edge structure. Ĺ The medium edge fuel loading 
landscape applies the medium loading custom fuel, number 21 to the edge 
structure, and ĺ the high edge fuel loading landscape with the high loading 
custom fuel, number 22 in the edge structure. The landscapes with edge structure

have a total of five fuel categories. Separating AEI from other patch types 
reallocated a portion of each of the four basic fuels and redefined them as edges. 
With a 30 m DEI on both sides’ of the patches, 29% of the landscape is considered 
edge (Table 18.2). FARSITE was used to simulate 16 surface fires systematically 
placed to cover as much area as possible. The fire ignition points were kept 
constant for simulations at all four landscapes. The simulated burned areas were 
analyzed with ANOVA (SAS V.9) to detect if the burned area was significantly 
affected by different fuel loadings within AEI after each day of a seven-day long 
simulation and a 24-hour burn period. The Tukey test was used to determine 
significant differences between the landscape scenarios. 
Table 18.2 Comparison of landscape structure among the four landscapes generated 
from assigning different custom fuels to 60 m combined patch edges. Control has 
no edge fuels. Landscapes with edges were created using a 30 m buffer inside and 
outside of the patches. Fuel area was reallocated from the four main patch types and a 
portion was put into the edge category. Categories 5, 8, 10, and 11 are Anderson’s 
(1982) fuel types and categories 20, 21, and 22 are custom fuels created using the 
FARSITE custom fuel editor to create fuel loadings that represented low, medium, 
and high rates of spread in timber fuel loadings

18.3 Results  
Fire spread was significantly affected by the edge fuel structure and the mean 
burned area (ha) was significantly different (P < 0.000,1) among the landscapes 
after seven days (Table 18.3). Fire spread responded to changes in landscape 
structure of both the edge feature and its fuel loading. The Tukey test showed 
each landscape to be significantly different (Fig. 18.2). Fire spread increased by 
38% with a high fuel loading assigned to the designated edge structure; while it 
decreased by 20% with medium edge fuel loading and 44% with low edge fuel 
loading. Ranking the landscape scenarios shows that the landscape without edge 
structure (i.e., control) produced burned areas between the medium and the high 
edge fuel loading scenarios.

scenarios. Low edge represents the landscape with custom fuel # 20, with low fuel 
loading in the edge. Medium edge represents the landscape with custom fuel # 21,

The daily rate of fire spread was also affected by edge fuel loading. The mean 
burned area (ha) was calculated on a per day basis for each landscape and a daily 
rate of spread was plotted to show the rate of spread for each landscape as well 
(Fig. 18.3). Fire spread was significantly (P 0.0061) different after the first day

18.4 Discussion 
We encourage model users to include edge fuel in FARSITE fuel maps of highly 
fragmented forests. Edges comprised 29% of our simulated landscape at the CNF 
(Table 18.2), suggesting a highly fragmented landscape and a large portion of 
landscape that could be uniquely influencing fire spread. In the CNF we show 
that almost one-third of the fuel picture was changed, affecting the modeled 
results. The control landscape (i.e., edges were not considered) produced fires 
with burned areas between our high and medium edge fuel loading scenarios. As 
a result, fuel maps without edge may over predict fire spread. With this data we can 
project what might happen in other landscapes with similar fragmentation, if forest 
fires encounter edges with high connectivity and comparable fuel loadings. 
AEI as a landscape element may not be changeable in a highly fragmented 
forest like the CNF but the fuel loading within the AEI can be manipulated to 
increase or decrease the spread potential of large fires. Burned area was significantly 
different among four contrasting landscapes. This suggests that landscape 
management focusing on manipulating fuel loading within the AEI could be an 
effective approach in attenuating fire spread across the landscape. Therefore it is

important to understand edge fuel dynamics and if possible manage fuel loading 
in forest edges because they are potentially a controlling fire fuel source at the 
landscape level, especially in highly fragmented landscapes, and if the high 
connectivity which we have modeled here is realized on a large portion of the 
edges between patches. Through simulations, we showed a 1,500 ha range for 
which managers could influence the seven-day outcome of fire spread by managing 
edge fuels alone. Carrying out the manipulation of fuel loading in the AEI could 
be done at the same time as normal harvesting operations. 
Even though daily fire spread response to landscape structural changes from 
adding and manipulating edge fuel loading were statistically significant (P 0.0061) 
after the first day (Table 18.3) large practical differences in fire size did not start 
to show up until after the second day (Fig. 18.3). This suggests that fires need to 
reach a certain size before the effects of the edge structure appear—meaning that 
if fires are suppressed in the first two days, edge fuels will have less of an impact 
on overall fire size. Currently, the forest management plans for the Chequamegon- 
Nicolet national forests call for immediate and complete suppression of all wildfires 
because of the high intermingling of private lands (USDA Forest Service, 2004). 
However, large fires do sometimes occur and edge fuel management should 
attenuate them based on these modeled projections. The fact that the model did 
find significance after one day of burning between different scenarios points to the 
importance of edge in the CNF as a fire fuel structure. This supports the conclusion 
that more edge and fire research should be conducted (Harper et al., 2005). 
A 30 m DEI to one side of an edge was chosen because Euskirchen et al. (2001) 
recommended a DEI of 30 m to both sides of the edge when managing the CNF 
landscape for understory plants that are unique to an edge after having examined 
herbaceous and woody plant species diversity across edges in the CNF. Since this 
was determined to be the size of the edge for plants, we used it as the DEI in this 
study to represent potentially unique fuel. In addition, further support comes from 
Harper et al. (2005) who report a synthesis of literature from around the world, 
including Eastern North America, which measured, among other variables, snag 
or log abundance in edges, an important fuel, as having mean DEI’s of between 
5 m and 125 m. Also, Harper and McDonald (2002) reported a range for this in 
another study as being between 10 m and 20 m. 
Understanding fuel structure in a landscape and its potential influence on fire 
spread will help in managing the size of fire disturbance on the landscape and its 
resulting renewal of community successional processes. Through this study we 
demonstrated that separating AEI from other landscape elements clearly produced 
different projections of fire spread. This suggests that manipulating the fuel loading 
around edges is an effective activity in determining the rate of fire spread and the 
total size of burns in the landscape, especially for large fires. When developing 
landscape management plans for fuel reduction, edge manipulation should be 
seriously considered because of their significant role in determining fire spread 
in a landscape (Stratton, 2004).

Abstract Public concerns regarding wildland fire management in the Eastern 
United States reflect myriad issues including the costs of fire suppression, 
landscape rehabilitation under pre- and post-fire conditions, structural damage 
and loss, health and cultural effects of smoke emissions, effects of insect 
and disease in association with fire, impacts of fire on aesthetic values, and 
risk of fire to human life. Because of the complexity of natural resource 
problems, managers can benefit from an integrated approach to landscape 
level management using both technologies, such as modeling and satellite 
imagery, with expert knowledge to better address these concerns. The ability 
to display the science of landscape change and the influences of natural 
processes such as fire, insects, and disease as well as prescribed treatments 
over time can help managers, decisions makers and the public to address 
complex issues from multiple scales and perspectives. A framework is presented 
pairing the modeling system SIMPPLLE (SIMulating vegetation Patterns 
and Processes at Landscape scaLEs), with basic concepts of sustainable forest 
management for a method to address complex issues in natural resources.

19.1 Introduction 
Public concerns regarding wildland fire management in the United States reflect 
myriad issues including the high costs of fire suppression, landscape rehabilitation, 
loss of and damage to homes and other structures, impacts of smoke emissions to 
human health and activities, effects of insect and disease in association with fire, 
impacts of fire on aesthetic values, and threats of fire to human life. From the 

 
Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
282 
Eastern United States to West, wildland fire is only one aspect of the many issues 
natural resource managers and stakeholders must address as people become more 
concerned about the sustainability of forest resources. Concerns about sustainability 
expand the globe and have been the topic of discussion among forest managers, 
policy-makers, and the general population in countless nations for decades, yet 
there remain more questions than answers as time progresses. 
In response to these growing concerns, an international seminar on sustainability 
for boreal and temperate forests convened in Montreal, Canada in 1993. From 
this seminar a standard for measuring and tracking progress toward sustainability 
was developed using a scientifically rigorous set of Criteria and Indicators for 
assessing forest management (Montreal Process, 1998). Once the international 
working group formalized its process for characterizing forest sustainability it 
was named the working group on criteria and indicators for the conservation and 
sustainable management of temperate and boreal forests, commonly referred to 
as the montreal process. This working group, composed initially of representatives 
from 10 nations, produced seven Criteria addressing the biophysical aspects of 
sustainability as well as the economic and social structures that are key to sustainable 
forest management; the criteria are associated with a number of measurable 
indicators for the evaluation of progress toward sustainable forest management 
(Montreal Process, 2003).  
The criteria and indicators articulated in the Montreal process provide a 
general framework for measuring forest management practices across landscapes. 
It includes methods of analyzing current forest conditions for sustainability into 
the future, the maintenance of acceptable current conditions, and guidance for 
measuring trends to track subsequent changes over time. An important aspect of 
this framework is that no single criteria or indicator is an absolute indication of 
sustainability; rather, individual criteria must be considered in the context of the 
other 6 criteria (Montreal Process, 1995). The criteria and indicators provide a 
comprehensive overview of forest conditions, a common data source for further 
analysis, and a basis to discussing forest sustainability across diverse levels of 
expertise. The fundamental connection between people and forests is at the center 
of this ecosystem approach to management. 
But defining forest sustainability within the context of public values must be 
broad enough to account for changing societal needs as well as forest conditions 
into the future and across landscapes of various scales. The U.S. forest service 
defines sustainable forest management as “the stewardship and use of forests  
and forest lands in such a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, 
productivity, regeneration capacity, and vitality, and their potential to fulfill, now 
and in the future, relevant ecological, economic, and social functions at local, 
national and global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems” 
(USDA Forest Service, 2004). Similarly, the Canadian forest service considers the 
criteria and indicators as useful for assessing forest health since the sustainability 
of forests are based on the forests being healthy and “in general terms, a healthy

forest is one that maintains biodiversity, resiliency, wildlife habitat, aesthetic 
appeal and resource sustainability” (Canadian Forest Service, 1999). According to 
Kimmins (1997) a healthy forest ecosystem can by measured by the underlying 
ecological processes operating within a natural range of variation so that these 
processes function dynamically and are resilient to disturbance at any temporal 
or spatial scale. 
Given the far-reaching concerns for sustainable forestry, managers, policy- 
makers, and others are faced with the challenge of deciding the best management 
practices for sustainability. The number, diversity, and interconnectedness of the 
criteria and indicators developed in the Montreal process reflect the complexity 
of managing forests sustainably. This issue of wildland fire, for example, illustrates 
how social, economic, and ecological aspects of natural resources are intertwined 
to clearly display where sustainability is not being achieved on many forested 
ecosystems. While fire, flood, drought, climate change, insect and disease processes 
historically played key roles in shaping and maintaining the forests of the United 
States and Canada, human activities such as logging, grazing, fire suppression, 
introductions of insect and disease, land use changes, atmospheric pollutants, carbon 
dioxide and other greenhouse gasses, and many other influences all have contributed 
to forest conditions that are much less resilient to disturbance (Canadian forest 
service, 1999). 
In the Northeastern United States human activities are evident in more recent 
historical analyses of northeastern forests; records indicate that they were heavily 
influenced by the setting of fires by Native Americans, although with the arrival 
of European settlers, fire activity was reduced and logging increased tremendously 
along with conversion to agriculture (Delcourt and Delcourt, 2000). Today, 
population growth, changing land uses, and the influences of past land use have 
altered fire behavior and the associated risks to the ecological, economic, and 
social integrity of forest ecosystems; private ownership mixed with State and 
Federal brings a divergence of forest management goals. There is an implicit 
need to work cooperatively across a diversity of ownership boundaries toward 
sustainable forest management, but how are these divergent ideas brought together 
toward a common goal of ecologic, economic, and social integrity across 
landscapes? Albert Abee, the national coordinator for sustainability, discussed 
reducing barriers to assessing sustainability in the U.S. (1999) and indicated that 
the integration of social, economic, and biological indices must include all 
ownerships across the landscape and promote collaborative stewardship. 
Natural resource managers can benefit from an integrated approach to landscape 
level modeling that incorporates the most recently remotely sensed data available 
along with the best available knowledge of natural resource sciences to better 
address these concerns, which are exacerbated by patterns of ownership, population, 
and housing densities across the Eastern landscapes. The ability to display the 
science of landscape change and the influences of natural processes and 
management treatments over time can effectively raise public awareness and 

 
Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
284 
address concerns at multiple geographic scales. An integrative approach to 
landscape level planning and management can be accomplished by bringing 
together knowledge from many disciplines and effectively communicating that 
knowledge to stakeholders and the public; public participation is critical to sound 
environmental policy and decision-making (Videira et al., 2003). The complexity 
of natural systems, however, is difficult enough to convey even from a single 
discipline to an audience already familiar with the medium. Integrating knowledge 
from multiple disciplines and communicating that information to the public 
introduces yet another level of complexity. Accomplishing the goals of sustainable 
forest management requires a multi-disciplinary approach; and given the 
interdependent nature of the variables on which sustainable forestry depends, 
integration of the knowledge and sciences is a necessity. 
An integrative approach to landscape level planning and sustainable management 
joins knowledge from multiple disciplines to address the myriad values associated 
with ecosystems. SIMulating patterns and processes at landscape scales 
(SIMPPLLE) is a management tool developed to help land managers integrate the 
best available knowledge of vegetation change resulting from disturbance processes 
such as fire, insects, and diseases as well as fire suppression and management 
treatment activities (Chew et al., 2004). The system integrates data from many 
sources, including satellite imagery and stand level database inventories, to represent 
landscape conditions. By linking with other inventory and assessment techniques 
such as the structure ignition assessment model (SIAM) (Cohen, 1995), SIMPPLLE 
can represent the probabilities of landscape scale fire disturbances spreading to 
specific sites and structures. A treatment optimization and scheduling model, 
MAGIS (Zuuring, 1995), has been linked to SIMPPLLE to assess the economic 
efficiency of fuel treatment allocations. 
As previously mentioned, there is a need to work across various ownership 
boundaries toward sustainable forest management, but this is an area that has 
always been rife with controversy. How do we bring these divergent ideas together 
toward a common goal of ecologic, economic, and social integrity across landscapes? 
Our ability to understand the science of ecosystems is limited by our ability to fit 
divergent variables together as they are represented by massive, disconnected 
data sets. Bringing information together comprehensively may be the key to 
understanding and communicating ecosystem concepts and the associated methods 
of managing for sustainability, “better data leads to better dialog, which leads to 
better decisions” (USDA Forest Service, 2004). How can knowledge be better 
understood and shared to attain sustainability?

have been debating for at least the last two decades. The United Nation’s

Assessing the Impacts of Wildland Fire on Eastern Landscapes              
285
Brundtland Commission Report provided an integrative statement of the many 
ideas that were generated when participants defined sustainable development as 
“development that meets the needs of the present without compromising the 
ability of future generations to meet their own needs” (WCED, 1987). The 
concept of sustainable forest management, a key factor in reaching the goal of 
sustainable development, is recognized globally as a necessary end for meeting 
the social, economic, and environmental needs of present and future generations. 
At the Rio Earth Summit in 1992, the United States identified sustainable   
forest management as a priority, yet methods of characterizing and assessing 
sustainability remained uncertain (USDA Forest Service, 2004). At that time the 
United States joined the global community to address mounting worldwide 
concerns regarding sustainable development in which sustainable forestry is a 
key component (USDA Forest Service, 2004). Following these initial meetings of 
nations, formal discussions continued among international leaders and the science 
community focusing on potential methods that could be employed to measure 
and track progress toward sustainability. 
In 1993, an international seminar on sustainability for boreal and temperate 
forests convened in Montreal, Canada. The seminar of 10 nations including the 
United States formed the working group on criteria and indicators for the 
conservation of sustainable management of boreal and temperate forests, best 
known as the Montreal process (Montreal Process, 1998). As a signatory participant 
of the Montreal process, which has grown to 12 member nations, the United 
States recognized the need for measuring the status, trends, and conditions of our 
nation’s forests and grasslands; the forest service developed an action plan for 
bringing criteria and indicators into operational programs nationwide (Abee, 1998). 
From this seminar a standard for measuring and tracking progress toward 
sustainability was developed using a scientifically rigorous set of criteria and 
indicators for assessing forest management (Montreal Process, 1998). The final 
meeting of the working group produced seven criteria, five addressing the 
biophysical aspect of forests including biological diversity, forest ecosystem 
productivity, forest ecosystem health, soil and water conservation, forest contribution 
to global carbon cycles; another criterion addressing socio-economic benefits, and 
the seventh criterion addressing a social framework for sustainable management; 
the criteria are associated with a number of measurable indicators for the 
evaluation of progress toward sustainable forest management (Montreal Process, 
2003). Criterion seven addresses the social emphasis which is core to facilitation 
of the other six criteria and arguably the basis to accomplishing the goals of 
sustainable forest management since we can assume that a nation cannot reach 
forest sustainability without the support and understanding of its public (Oliver, 
2003; USDA Forest Service, 2004). 
The framework provided by the Montreal process criteria and indicators provides 
an initial step toward understanding current trends in forested systems, baseline 
information for evaluating whether management activities are being directed 

 
Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
286 
toward sustainability, how to get there within the changing boundaries of 
environmental variables such as warmer, drier conditions compared to recent 
human history influencing fire behavior, along with changing human use on the 
landscape.  
The importance of addressing sustainability from the social, economic, and 
ecological perspective is clearly understood by forest managers, stakeholders, 
and policy-makers worldwide. Land management agencies have recognized the 
need for managing for ecosystem health for many years, and sustainable forest 
management is the latest term for taking a holistic approach to managing 
ecosystems. Despite this recognition managers continue to wrestle with methods 
of reaching a sustainable approach to landscape level management and have yet 
to find a way to integrate all aspects of ecological systems to gain better 
understanding of these systems. 
19.3 Sustainable Forest Management (SFM) 
The general framework for pinpointing conditions, or “vital signs” (Abee, 1998) 
and assessing sustainable forest management is provided by the Montreal process 
which outlines the issues that must be addressed to direct management toward 
sustainable future conditions or maintenance of acceptable current conditions and 
some guidance for measuring trends to track subsequent changes over time. The 
criteria and Indicators provide a source of reference information as a comprehensive 
overview of forest conditions and a common data source for further analysis and 
a basis to discussing forest sustainability. But defining forest sustainability within 
the context of public values must be broad enough to account for changing needs 
and forest conditions over time and space. Oliver (2003) posits that a “working” 
definition is required and that a common theme of all definitions of sustainable 
forestry lies in the concept of environmental justice where people living in one 
place and time should provide their “fair share” of values neither to the detriment 
or benefit of people in another place and time. The U.S. Forest service defines 
sustainable forest management as “the stewardship and use of forests and forest 
lands in such a way, and at a rate, that maintains their biodiversity, productivity, 
regeneration capacity, and vitality, and their potential to fulfill, now and in the 
future, relevant ecological, economic, and social functions at local, national and 
global levels, and that does not cause damage to other ecosystems” (USDA Forest 
Service, 2004). 
A working definition is necessary because of the changing conditions that are 
seen across ecosystems. Researchers cannot predict what kind of impacts we can 
expect from global warming, pollution, changing land uses, and so many other 
environmental issues. While many people question current activities that will 
only result in benefits to later generations, a key aspect of sustainable forest

19 The Need for Data Integration to Achieve Forest Sustainability: Modeling and 
Assessing the Impacts of Wildland Fire on Eastern Landscapes              
287
management is to manage for both present and future generations. In order to 
move management activities toward sustainability, the social, ecological, and 
economic perspectives of the ecosystem must be addressed together. Criterion 
seven provides the context for bringing together all the pieces of the ecosystem.  
While ecological conditions may be the platform to forest sustainability, it is the 
legal, institutional, and economic structures that enable identification of concerns 
about forest sustainability and ways to address and implement policy and 
management responses (USDA Forest Service, 2004). 
19.4 Northeastern Forests—an Example of Changing  
Conditions 
With world wide concerns for sustainable forestry as a basis to sustainable 
development, managers, policy-makers, and others are faced with the challenge 
of deciding the best management practices for sustainability. The number and 
diversity of criteria and indicators developed in the Montreal process reflect the 
complexity of managing forests sustainably. The forest management issue of 
wildland fire is a single instance of how the social, economic, and ecological 
aspects of natural resources are intertwined into an intricate barrier to achieving 
sustainable management. The “Sourcebook on criteria and indicators of forest 
sustainability in the Northeastern Area” (2002) echoes the key features of the 
Montreal process summing that forests must be managed for continued existence 
as a healthy organism in order to meet human physical, economic, and social 
needs now as well as for future generations. 
Just as forests of the Western United States have been shaped through time by 
the presence and then suppression of fire, forests of the Eastern United States 
have been formed through similar processes. Wildland fire in the Northeastern 
United States with the associated expansive population densities, diverse economic 
and ecologic goals, and the many impacts of fire on the landscape typifies a 
common management problem of escalating concern. The complex knot of private 
ownership intertwined with State and Federal is fertile ground for controversy. 
Northeastern temperate forests provide an example of landscapes heavily influenced 
historically by Native American burning, followed by the arrival of European 
settlers when fire activity was reduced and harvesting increased tremendously along 
with conversion to agriculture (Delcourt and Delcourt, 2000). Now, population 
growth, changing land uses, and the influences of past land use have altered fire 
behavior and the associated risks to human life and structures; similar to 
management issues in the Western States in which private ownership mixed with 
State and Federal brings a divergence of forest management goals (McKinney 
and Harmon, 2004), Eastern States must consider an even more fragmented 
landscape of ownerships. Questions regarding management practices present 

 
Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
288 
great complexity and an even larger population to communicate with than is seen 
in the west.  
19.5 Modeling Landscape Conditions to Address  
Sustainable Forest Management 
The complexity of natural systems, however, is difficult to convey even from a 
single discipline to an audience already familiar with the medium. Integrating 
knowledge from multiple disciplines and communicating that information to the 
public introduces yet another level of complexity. Further, resource managers and 
researchers must avail themselves of effective technology transfer approaches to 
share the ecological and socio-economic information while focusing on the 
importance of the social and political sense of place to public and stakeholders. 
Communicating the sciences of ecosystems in the context of social implications 
is new territory; until managers can better understand how ecosystem values fit 
together they cannot address sustainability and without public understanding of 
the issues management cannot be applied at levels that can have an impact on 
forest conditions. 
The premise of criteria and indicators is interdependency; no single criteria is a 
measure of sustainability alone, each must be considered in the context of the 
others to fully identify current sustainability trends in forest ecosystems (USDA 
Forest Service, 2004). And central to this interdependency is the need for local 
stakeholder participation in forest management assessments because understanding 
the connections of ecosystem variables sets the stage for better informed decisions 
for sustainability. 
Accomplishing the goals of sustainable forest management requires a multi- 
disciplinary approach and given the interdependent nature of the variables on 
which sustainable forestry depends, integration of the knowledge and sciences is 
a necessity.  
Indicators 60  62, of criterion seven of the Montreal process details the need 
to maintain and standardize up-to-date data, data collection, statistics, and other 
information important to measuring all seven criteria (Montreal process working 
group, 1998). However, data collection is costly in both time and dollars and 
national agencies struggle to bring forest inventories up-to-date, as well as to 
monitor and assess the data for validity. In 1997, the U.S. forest service compiled 
its first approximation report for sustainable forest management based on the 
criteria and indicators and although some information was available for most 
indicators data was completely lacking, or had been only recently collected making 
it impossible to determine trends, or data collection had been conducted using 
inconsistent definitions or methodologies across study locations so that conclusions 
could not be drawn (USDA Forest Service, 1997). More recently, appendix 3 of 
www.ebook3000.com

19 The Need for Data Integration to Achieve Forest Sustainability: Modeling and 
Assessing the Impacts of Wildland Fire on Eastern Landscapes              
289
the National Report on Sustainable Forests—2003 (USDA Forest Service, 2004) 
discusses continuing data issues and the need for better data management and 
availability specific to each criterion. While on-line sources continue to increase 
and become more easily available, the “best” available data changes frequently 
and will continue to do so into the future. 
Since natural resource information is changing regularly, a model must be 
adaptable to using the best, or sometimes any, available data; it must represent 
multiple landscape scales (Oliver, 2003) and represent those processes influencing 
vegetation change such as insects, disease, and fire, as spatially explicit so that 
interactions of specific vegetation conditions and process probabilities can be 
displayed as they occur and spread. 
An integrative approach to landscape level planning and sustainable management 
joins knowledge from multiple disciplines to address the myriad values associated 
with ecosystems. SIMPPLLE is a management tool developed to help land 
managers integrate the best available knowledge of vegetation change resulting 
from disturbance processes such as fire, insects, and diseases as well as fire 
suppression and management treatment activities (Chew et al., 2004). The model 
uses landscape level vegetation data to represent vegetation change as a result of 
the interacting disturbance processes and management actions. The model’s 
spatial link to GIS and the dynamic approach to modeling landscapes provide a 
tool to aid users in visualizing how a landscape can change over time and space 
with and without the influence of management applications. 
Modeling with SIMPPLLE helps quantify the level of resources and the 
realistically attainable future conditions that meet the goals of sustainable forest 
management. The model represents landscapes from multiple scales by representing 
individual plant communities as spatially linked units across the larger landscape. 
The modeling approach in SIMPPLLE and its tie to GIS provides a valuable 
visual display, a picture to enhance communication of issues scaling from one 
acre to millions. Discussions of management activity toward SFM are greatly 
enhanced by displaying the potential effect on the landscape. 
19.6 Conclusions 
The framework to sustainable forest management can be derived from the 
Criteria and Indicators developed in the Montreal process. Managers can refine 
applications specific to locations world wide. The criteria and indicators are 
broad yet provide a standard base from which forest managers can make better 
decisions, enhancing sustainability ranging across a wide variety of landscapes 
and conditions—from highly populated, industrialized conditions to sparsely 
populated, non-industrialized conditions. 
It is necessary to help managers strive for goals of sustainability by developing 
a better understanding of how changes within landscapes over time and space 

 
Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
290 
influence the management of landscapes on a scale that expands generations. If 
we want to reach sustainability into the future we must plan for future conditions 
within a realistic horizon which includes large events such as fire, insect and 
disease epidemics, climate change, human population growth, and an endless list of 
alternative possible conditions that can be expected across a landscape. Modeling 
techniques used in the SIMPPLLE system that are adaptive to changing data, 
representative of changing conditions, and able to integrate information across 
disciplines provide a forum to better understand how biophysical processes can 
be managed sustainably within our social and economic framework. 
Criteria and indicators developed in the Montreal process, specifically 
criterion 7, combined with developing modeling techniques, and ongoing efforts 
to work cooperatively across a diversity of landownership boundaries, will all go 
a long way in helping managers promote, protect and maintain sustainable forests 
across a vast landscape long into the future.

Abstract Satellite observations of wildland, agricultural and prescribed 
fires are routinely identified by Fire Analysts and software algorithms which 
are part of NOAA’s Hazard Mapping System. However, to more fully 
automate this operational system, NOAA teamed up with NASA to train a 
neural network which mimicked the behavior of both analysts and software 
algorithms in their examination of multi-sensor, satellite imagery. Three 
spectral channels from GOES, AVHRR and MODIS imagery, spanning the 
2003 fire season across the continental United States, was used as training data 
and JOONE, SNNS and MATLAB software packages generated the NNs. 
Test results from MATLAB’s 147-10-1 feedforward, backpropagation NN 
are described. Performance analysis consisted of error matrices, Producer’s, 
User’s and Overall accuracy, and a Kappa/KHAT.

20.1 Introduction 
Wildfires have a profound impact upon the biosphere and our society in general. 
They cause loss of life, destruction of personal property and natural resources 
and alter the chemistry of the atmosphere. In response to the concern over the 
consequences of fire and to support the fire management community, the national 
oceanic and atmospheric administration (NOAA), national environmental satellite, 
data and information service (NESDIS) located in camp Springs, Maryland gradually 
developed an operational system to routinely monitor wildland, agricultural and 
prescribed fire by satellite observations. The hazard mapping system, as it is 
known today, allows a team of trained fire analysts to examine and integrate, on a 
daily basis, remote sensing (RS) data from geostationary operational environmental 
satellite (GOES), advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and moderate 
resolution imaging spectroradiometer (MODIS) satellite sensors and generate a 
24 hour fire product for North America. Although assisted by automated fire 
detection algorithms, NOAA has not been able to eliminate the human element from 
their fire detection procedures. The national aeronautics and space administration 
(NASA) at goddard space flight center in Greenbelt, Maryland has been 
collaborating with NOAA to more fully automate the hazard mapping system by 
training neural networks to mimic the decision-making process of the fire analyst 
team as well as the automated algorithms. 
20.2 Data Archiving 
More than four years ago a team of government and (ultimately) University 
personnel were assembled with the intent of applying artificial intelligence 
techniques to NOAA’s automation problem. NASA began archiving satellite 
imagery from GOES, AVHRR and MODIS satellite sensors in the summer of 
2003. Three spectral channels for each of 3 science instruments were provided by 
NOAA NESDIS by uploading to a NASA computer within the information 
systems division at goddard space flight center. The following uploaded spectral 
bands, being only a subset of those available from each instrument, were found 
by NOAA NESDIS to be the most useful in fire identification: MODIS Channels 1 
(0.66 μm), 2 (0.86 μm), 22 (3.96 μm); AVHRR Channels 1 (0.63 μm), 2 (0.91 μm), 
3b (3.7 μm), and GOES Channels 1 (0.62 μm), 2 (3.9 μm), 4 (10.7 μm). Both 
reflectance and brightness temperature were scaled by NESDIS to a range of 
0  255. It became apparent almost immediately that the huge volume of satellite 
imagery which NESDIS provided but did not archive themselves presented a 
formidable storage problem. Each day, NESDIS processed 96 GOES image files, 
25 AVHRR image files and 16 MODIS image files which were uploaded to 
NASA. Satellite imagery, in lambert conformal conic projections, plus ancillary 

20 Automated Wildfire Detection Through Artificial Neural Networks 
295
data required approximately 1.44 gigabytes of storage daily. A Mac G5 with 12 
Maxtor external disk drives (250 gigabytes each) was able to handle the enormous 
storage requirement.  
20.3 Preliminary Analysis 
The first step in our analysis consisted of a series of scatter plots to help visualize 
the relationship between pixels in 2 selected spectral bands. We began with the 
GOES image set in an attempt to determine the separability of fire and non-fire 
pixels. Refer to Fig. 20.1 for a sample scatter plot. Using data sets over the course 
of a single day, clusters of background pixels (upper region) and fire pixels 
(lower region) are clearly distinguishable. All intensity values were background 
subtracted. This was the first indication, confirmed by subsequent analysis, that 
different fires types (crown, surface and ground) did not have unique fire signatures 
and that a simple linear separability existed between the two general classes of 
fire and background pixels.  
 
Figure 20.1 Scatter plot of GOES Channels 1 and 2 
20.4 Data Reduction 
A good deal of effort went into the construction of satisfactory feature vectors for 
neural network training. Early in the investigation data sets were drawn from specific 
regions of the country which had more or less uniform land cover characteristics 
(such as Kansas) as well as specific seasons and time of day in an attempt to 
confine wildfires to specific types and possibly signatures. Feature vectors which

incorporated these components as well as spectral information made neural 
network convergence difficult. Once it was determined that only a single fire 
signature was involved, spectral data became the only component of the feature 
vector. The guiding principle in training set composition was to use NOAA’s 
ASCII data formatted fire product (McNamara et al., 2002), to locate wildfires 
within satellite imagery, then extract 3-band pixel information at these points. 
Table 20.1 is exemplary of NOAA’s text formatted fire product available at their 
FTP site. As shown on each line and for each separate fire, the geographic 
coordinates of the fire are followed by a time stamp, the satellite imagery from 
which the determination was made and finally the method of detection which 
may have been a human analyst or one of three automated algorithms: wildfire 
automated biomass burning algorithm (WF-ABBA) (Prins and Menzel, 1992; 
McNamara et al., 2002), fire identification mapping and monitoring algorithm 
(FIMMA) (McNamara, et al., 2002; McNamara et al., 2002) or MODIS MOD14

ANALYSIS 
 
Using environment for visualizing images (ENVI) software, geographic 
coordinates of wildfires provided by NOAA’s fire product were converted to 
pixel row and column coordinates for a particular image being processed through 
a series of ENVI function calls embedded in interactive data language (IDL) 
code. When examining satellite imagery of wildfires using ENVI in visual mode 
however it was found that fires were not in the precise location where the 
geographic coordinates placed them, being offset possibly by several pixels from 
their expected location. Considering the 1,000 meter spatial resolution of MODIS 
and AVHRR, the offset error might have been 2,000 or 3,000 meters but for GOES 

20 Automated Wildfire Detection Through Artificial Neural Networks 
297
data in the thermal band (4,000 meter resolution) the error could have been as much 
as 12,000 meters. This offset was attributed to 3 sources: spacecraft navigation 
errors, the inherent tolerances within NOAA software and operational errors in 
the point-and-click method of a Fire Analyst identifying fire locations with a 
mouse. One of the best clues for identifying wildfires that NOAA Fire Analysts 
employ is to visually inspect the 4 micrometer band for dark spots within 
NESDIS-processed satellite imagery. NOAA software has been written in such a 
way that brightness temperatures, which have been scaled to a range of 0  255 
will assume the lowest values for the hottest fires. This can be seen clearly in 
Fig. 20.2(a), a satellite image of northern Florida. Here, a wildfire (enclosed in 
rectangle) at coordinates –82.10e West Longitude, 30.49e North Latitude recorded 
on Julian day 126 in 2003, appears as a single black spot. Although appearing to 
be a pinpoint location in the normal view, a zoomed-in view in Fig. 20.2(b) 
indicates that the fire is actually spread across numerous pixel locations. In order 
to extract the spectral information around this exemplar fire, using the approximate 
location as specified by the ASCII data fire product, our software performed a 
local minima search in the 4 micrometer band in the expected region to pinpoint 
the hottest fire pixel (lowest intensity value). Spectral information was then 
collected around that image coordinate in all 3 bands.  
 
Figure 20.2 (a) GOES Channel 2 Northern Florida fire (normal view), (b) GOES 
Channel 2 northern Florida fire (zoom view) 
In the course of the investigation, three different methods to characterize a fire 
across 3 spectral bands were attempted: as a single pixel at an instantaneous point 
of time, a pixel time series demonstrating the time evolution of a fire throughout 
the day and as a pixel array at an instantaneous point in time. The first two 
techniques had mixed results in achieving neural network convergence, however 
the third, a spatial technique consisting of 77 pixel arrays with the hottest part 
of the fire as the central pixel, was successful. In the 4 micrometer band, the 
approximate locations of hot spots were identified by NOAA’s fire product, and

then the local minima technique identified the hottest part of the fire. In all 3 
bands, using the image coordinates of the hottest fire pixel, pixel arrays of size 
77 were collected around that central point. A typical spatial fire pattern for the 
MODIS sensor is shown in Table 20.2. Numeric values represent reflectance or 
brightness temperature scaled to a 0  255 range. In the 3.96 μm band the pattern 
becomes visually obvious. Moving away from the central pixel, the cooler parts 
of the fire are represented by rising intensity values (an intentional inversion).

20.5 Neural Network Architecture 
Three bands of 77 pixel arrays, formatted as 147 element feature vectors 
determined the number of network input nodes while the number of hidden nodes 
was initially determined by the rule-of-thumb to start with the square root of the 

20 Automated Wildfire Detection Through Artificial Neural Networks 
299
sum of the inputs and outputs (Eberhart and Dobbins, 1990), which in this case is 12. 
Even with some experimentation though, the number of hidden nodes did not vary 
much from the initial value. A single output node was required to discriminate 
between the 2 classes. The final 147-10-1 feedforward backpropagation neural 
network configuration used for training and testing is shown in Fig. 20.3. Separate, 
identical networks were created for each sensor. Mathematical operations performed 
by network layers are shown in Table 20.3 in terms of: I (induced local field), O 
(nodal output), W (network weight) and f (hyperbolic transfer function).

20.6 Training and Testing 
Thousands of spatial pattern training samples were extracted from the 3 sensor 
imagery which spanned the 2003 fire season across the continental United States. 
Three different neural network modeling tools were used in the course of the 
investigation: java object oriented neural engine (JOONE), stuttgart neural 
network simulator (SNNS) and MATLAB Neural Network Toolbox. The first 2 
tools were freely downloadable from the Internet (http://www.jooneworld.com and 
http://www-ra.informatik.uni-tuebingen.de/SNNS, respectively). The following 
discussion however pertains only to results obtained with MATLAB. The total 
number of spatial pattern samples for MODIS, AVHRR, GOES-EAST and 
GOES-WEST was 25,713, 43,758, 73,010 and 53,922 respectively, with the ratio 
of fires to non-fires being approximately 1:1. A variation of the cross-validation 
technique (Amari et al., 1997) was employed for training and testing. Total 
available patterns for each instrument were divided into 4 quarters, each being 
representative of the entire data set. Training samples constituted 1/2 of the total 
number of patterns with 1/4 relegated to a validation set and 1/4 a test set 
resulting in 3 disjoint data sets. Batch training using the gradient descent with 
momentum algorithm was selected from a suite of available MATLAB routines 
and generally the early stopping technique was used to avoid overfitting. During 
training, the mean squared error on the validation set was monitored and when it 
began to rise, training was automatically halted. Testing was then performed on 
data that had not been seen by the neural network during the training phase. 
20.7 Classification and Analysis 
Results of the neural network classification for MODIS, AVHRR and GOES EAST 
and GOES WEST data are presented in the form of error matrices, the starting 
point for further analysis techniques, in Tables 20.4. Since this is a 2-class system, 
empirical data represents true positives (TP), true negatives (TN), false positives 
(FP) and false negatives (FN) which occupy the upper left hand corner of the 
error matrices for which marginal totals have been computed. Remaining notations 
used in these tables are: fires (F), non-fires (NF), marginal column total (MCT) and 
marginal row total (MRT). Error matrices were analyzed statistically (Congalton 
and Green, 1999) as shown in Table 20.5 with results tabulated in Table 20.6.  
As can be seen, using Congalton’s method results in 5 different accuracy 
measures of neural network performance. Overall accuracy describes the neural 
network’s ability to correctly assign unknown image pixels to either of two classes, 
fire and background while the producer’s and user’s accuracy figures account for 
omission and commission errors, respectively. This somewhat confusing set of 
results was rectified by a procedure called marginal fitting (Congalton, 1991) in 

20 Automated Wildfire Detection Through Artificial Neural Networks 
301
which error matrix rows and columns are iteratively normalized so that marginal 
totals converge to unity and differences in sample size are accounted for. Normalized 
error matrices are shown in Tables 20.7. For a 2-class system, normalized error 
matrices yield identical results for overall accuracy, producer’s accuracy and user’s 
accuracy thus a single performance measure was obtained. This was followed by 
a Kappa analysis (Congalton and Green, 1999). Comparison of normalized accuracy 
and the KHAT statistic are shown in Table 20.8; as indicated, a high degree of 
classification accuracy, greater than 95%, was achieved for the MODIS sensor. 
This tracks well with the KHAT value which measures how well the classification 
agrees with the reference data. A value greater than 80% indicates strong agreement. 
ANN classification performance in terms of both measures however becomes 
progressively worse thereafter for AVHRR and GOES and thus the ANNs became 
less useful for our intended purpose.

20.8 Conclusions 
The original intent of the project was to develop a single neural network that could 
process sensor data from all 3 satellite instruments, and perform fire classification 
at least as well as the automated algorithms and human fire analysts currently 
achieve so that incorporation into NOAA’s operational hazard mapping system 
could reduce the amount of manual intervention. Our research has shown that 
there was insufficient temporal and spatial overlap between the 3 sensors to 
process image data with a single ANN. Even excepting this problem, the extreme 
size of the network, exacerbated by 7 7 pixel arrays to characterize fire patterns, 
would have made training difficult or impossible for our host platform. Our 
analysis showed that dividing processing between 3 independent networks was 
the practical solution; however, except in the case of MODIS, classification 
accuracy did not achieve the level of performance that would allow the relief of 
human workload. Improvement in classification accuracy could likely be 
achieved however by incorporating in the training process additional generalization 
techniques such as those offered by MATLAB’s neural toolbox: modified per- 
formance function, and bayesian regularization (Demuth and Beale, 2000). Perhaps 
then, with further research efforts, our neural designs could be incorporated into 
NOAA’s operational system.

Abstract We generated a series of maps to help alert and educate people 
to the pervasiveness of fire regime changes across the eastern United States. 
Using geographic information systems (GIS), fire regimes were assigned to 
spatial vegetation databases to depict past and current conditions. Comparisons 
revealed substantial reductions in fire throughout the East. The most dramatic 
shifts took place in the former Midwestern grasslands and across a broad swath 
of southern and central States where pine and oak communities historically 
dominated. Land-use changes (e.g., agricultural and forest-type conversions) 
and recent fire suppression largely explain these shifts. Fire regime change 
was least in northern hardwood systems, in the mixed mesophytic region, 
and within the Mississippi Embayment. Negative ecological consequences 
of prolonged fire suppression are mounting while restoration opportunities 
are waning.

21.1 Introduction 
Ecosystems are the product of physical settings (e.g., climate, geology, soils), 
biota (plants and animals), and disturbance regimes. Ecosystems are dynamic 
(Pahl-Wostl, 1995), shifting states as components interact and change over time and 
space. Intriguingly, ecological research has been slow to grasp dynamism, focusing 
instead on equilibrium and stability to explain physical and biotic interactions 
(especially climate-site-vegetation relations) at the expense of disturbance 
(Christensen, 1991; Reice, 2001). Indeed, early ecological theories clearly bear 
this out (e.g., succession towards climax in the absence of disturbance; Clements, 
1916). Fortunately, through mounting scientific evidence, perspectives have

changed to embrace disturbance as an equally important, actually vital driver of 
ecological patterns, processes, and diversity (Watt, 1947; Denslow, 1980; Pickett 
and White, 1985; Oliver and Larson, 1996; Frelich, 2002). Even in climax systems, 
where autogenic (internal) processes were once thought to reign supreme, the 
role of allogenic (external) disturbances has been proven instrumental (Henry and 
Swan, 1974; Oliver and Stephens, 1977). 
Disturbances affect biota in a wide variety of ways, from catastrophic extinction 
events (e.g. asteroid impacts or mass volcanism; Benton and Twitchett, 2003; 
McElwain and Punyasena, 2007) to chronic, less-destructive disturbances that help 
guide species evolution, adaptation, and assemblage (Grime, 1977). The term 
“disturbance regime” refers to the latter, encompassing an array of common, 
recurrent disturbances within a physical setting over a period of relative constant 
climate. In this context, species possessing life-history and physiological traits 
that “match” a given disturbance regime will express dominance, whereas those 
physiologically “ill equipped” will not (Bazzaz, 1979; Denslow, 1980; Osmond 
et al., 1987). This explains, in part, why hydrophilic trees grow on floodplains 
(Jackson and Colmer, 2005), fire-adapted trees dominate fire-prone areas (Lorimer, 
1985; Abrams, 1996; Hengst and Dawson, 1994), and shade-tolerant trees proliferate 
in closed-canopied forests with gap-phase dynamics (Barden, 1979; Runkle, 1981 
and 1982). 
Humans have long enhanced or facilitated certain types of disturbances through 
their activities, thus directly affecting disturbance regimes. The global use of fire 
is most noteworthy (Stewart, 1956; Komarek, 1967; Sauer, 1975). Unfortunately, 
early North American scientists were slow to grasp the magnitude of Native 
burning, thus grossly underestimating its impacts on the environment (Stewart, 
2002). Ecologists frequently misinterpreted pre-European vegetation as climatic 
climaxes rather than fire-maintained systems, while anthropologists viewed past 
cultures as merely reacting to the environment rather than being active participants. 
As a result, the concept of the environmentally benign Indian was firmly entrenched 
in science. 
The consequences of Indian ignitions are most stark in moist temperate regions 
not conducive to burning, which is the case over most of the Eastern United States. 
Here, a long history of Native burning has produced a broad and diverse array of 
fire-based ecosystems (Little, 1974; Pyne, 1982; Wright and Bailey, 1982; Stewart 
2002). As such, many Eastern species are adapted to and dependent on fire, either 
directly or indirectly (e.g.; jack pine (Pinus banksiana) and Kirtland’s warbler 
(Dendroica kirtlandii); longleaf pine (Pinus palustris) and red-cockaded woodpecker 
(Picoides borealis)). Some plants actually reinforce fire regimes through the 
production of volatile compounds and flammable foliage (Mutch, 1970). With 
over 70 documented uses of fire (Lewis, 1993), Native Americans were an important 
ignition source, vastly augmenting natural causes (e.g., lightning) in most cases 
(Fahey and Reiners, 1981; Van Lear and Waldrop, 1989). In this respect, Native 
Americans were a “keystone species,” actively managing the environment with

fire over millennia (Sauer, 1975; Cronon, 1983). Due to the prevalence of fire, 
early European explorers and settlers encountered vast landscapes of fire-adapted 
(pyrogenic) vegetation, spanning from northern systems of spruce-fir (Picea- 
Abies), aspen-birch (Populus-Betula), and pine (Pinus) through oak-dominated 
(Quercus) central hardwoods to southern “pineries” and canebrakes (Wright and 
Bailey, 1982). Tallgrass prairies scattered throughout owed their existence to 
Native Americans who, through annual/biennial burning, maintained them for 
big game forage and hunting (grass  game  meat  satiated and flourishing 
families!). 
European exploration, settlement, and land use fundamentally changed disturbance 
regimes of the East. Soon after first contact, a wave of Native depopulation, 
social disintegration, and displacement ensued, greatly changing the disturbance 
dynamics that formerly operated for thousands of years (Cook, 1973; Cronon, 
1983; Denevan, 1992). With westward Euro-American expansion, forestlands 
were universally cut (aka, the “Great Cutover”), often subsequently burned, and 
many converted to agriculture (MacCleery, 1996). On areas allowed to reforest, 
deciduous tree species with disturbance adaptations (light-seeded, fast-growing 
pioneers; sprouters) often increased in importance at the expense of conifers 
(Nowacki and Abrams, 1992; Schulte et al., 2003). Natural systems rebounded 
where ongoing European activities mimicked past disturbance regimes, such as 
frequent surface burning of oak-hickory (Quercus-Carya) woodlands. In contrast, 
where European activities largely deviated from past disturbance regimes, wholesale 
changes in forest conditions occurred. For instance, a sizeable proportion of 
conifer-northern hardwoods (rich mesophytic systems that infrequently burned) 
converted to aspen-birch or oak through repeated cutting and burning (Graham et 
al., 1963; Nowacki et al., 1990; Schulte et al., 2003). 
Social attitudes towards fire changed in the early 1900’s when outbreaks of 
destructive wildfires led to aggressive suppression efforts (Pyne, 1982; Stewart, 
2002). This campaign with seemingly good intentions had major unforeseen 
ecological consequences across America. Without fire, open lands (grasslands, 
savannas, and woodlands) quickly succeeded to closed-canopied forests, followed 
by the eventual replacement of light-demanding, fire-dependent plants by shade- 
tolerant, fire-sensitive vegetation. Ground flora diversity in particular was negatively 
affected by forest conversion as light resources to the understory became limited 
(Anderson et al., 2000). These compositional and structural changes continue 
largely unabated today through ongoing fire suppression. 
The fire dependency of many native plant communities necessitates that certain 
landscapes are managed with fire. This is an evolutionary-based principal that can 
not be ignored (Grime, 1977; Bazzaz, 1979). Indeed, without fire, the ecological 
integrity of pyrogenic ecosystems is compromised with accumulating species 
loss and biodiversity reduction. By comparing past and current fire regimes, the 
authors attempt to document the magnitude and pervasiveness of fire regime change 
and discuss the ecological consequences of such change in the Eastern United States.

21.2 Methods 
Geographic information systems (GIS) and available vegetation data layers were 
used to depict past and current fire regimes and temporal changes. For consistency, 
only data layers spanning the entire Eastern United States were considered. 
Vegetation classes were assigned fire regime groups (Fig. 21.1) according to 
nation-wide fire regime condition class (FRCC) protocols (http://www.frcc.gov). 
All maps were uniformly rasterized at 1-kilometer pixels for analytical purposes. 
Schmidt’s et al., (2002) potential natural vegetation (PNV) map served as the 
basis to reconstruct past fire regimes (digital cover acquired through Jim Menakis, 
USDA Forest Service). Fire regime groups were assigned using Cecil Frost’s 
“Presettlement fire frequency regions of the United States” map (Frost, 1998), 
other relevant literature (e.g.; Heinselman, 1973; Wright and Bailey, 1982; Wade 
et al., 2000), and expert opinion (see Table 21.1 and Acknowledgements). 
 
Figure 21.1 Five fire regime groups depicted along axes of fire severity and 
frequency. Criteria breakpoints are 75% top-kill for fire severity (low & mixed vs. 
replacement) and 35 yrs and 200 yrs for fire frequency (frequent, infrequent, and 
rare). Fire regime groups have been colored to reflect a fire gradient from extreme 
(red; Group ē) to rare (blue; Group Ė) 
Advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR) and national land cover 
dataset (NLCD) layers were used in tandem to map current fire regimes. The 
individual classification power of the two datasets was capitalized on, maximizing 
the number of classes to depict current vegetation (theoretically increasing 
accuracy). As such, AVHRR data were used to classify forestlands (by type and 
cover class), whereas NLCD data were applied to the remaining lands, primarily 
non-forested openlands. Fire regime group assignments (Tables 21.2 and 21.3) 
were applied to produce a current fire regime map.

To spatially depict fire regime change over time, fire regime groups were 
reassigned Arabic numerals reflecting a fire gradient from hottest (most frequent 
and severe; ķ to coolest (least frequent and severe; ĸ This Roman-to-Arabic 
conversion was not direct as the former did not best capture this fire gradient; 
which strikes diagonally from lower right (hottest) to upper left (coolest) in Fig. 21.1. 
Thus, the following values were applied: FRG Ē 2, FRG ē 1, FRG Ĕ 4, 
FRG ĕ 3 and FRG Ė 5. 

21 Altered Disturbance Regimes: the Demise of Fire in the Eastern United States

A fire regime change map was then generated on a pixel-by-pixel basis using 
the following equation: 
 
Fire regime change Past fire regime group – Current fire regime group 
 
  
(21.1) 
This formula projects past-to-current fire regime change over 9 classes from -4 
through 0 to +4. Negative values represent reductions of fire (in terms of fire 
frequency and severity) on the landscape over time, whereas positive values indicate 
increased fire. The more negative or positive the values are, the more dramatic 
the trend.  
21.3 Results and Discussion 
Past and current fire regime maps are shown in Figs. 21.2 and 21.3, respectively. 
Color palettes reflect a fire regime gradient from highly “pyrogenic” systems that

burn most frequently and intensely (FRG ē; red) to “asbestos” systems that 
rarely burn (FRG Ė; blue). Note that the color spectrum (red hot to cool blue) 
differs somewhat from fire regime group enumeration (FRG Ē  Ė). 
Past fire regimes differed distinctly across the eastern United States as inferred 
from potential natural vegetation (Fig. 21.2). Historic fire regimes reflected a 
complex interaction among climate, vegetation, and topo-edaphic factors buoyed 
by human and natural ignitions (Jackson, 1968; Anderson, 1991). Fittingly, fire 
was most pronounced (FRG ē; red) within the Eastern, wedge-shaped extension 
of the Great Plains, known as the “Prairie Peninsula” (Transeau, 1935). Here, a 
large expanse of highly flammable grasses with few natural topographic barriers 
fostered hot, fast-spreading, near-complete burns (Jackson, 1965; Komarek, 1965; 
Anderson, 1991). Warm, dry conditions during dormant seasons (spring and fall) 
were especially favorable for fire outbreaks. Since tallgrass prairies are wholly 
dependent on burning for persistence, fires were undoubtedly frequent, probably 
occurring every year or so (Wells, 1970; Stewart, 2002). Rivers, lakes and dissected 
topography afforded some protection from fire such that surrounding lands, 
particularly on the lee side of prevailing winds, probably burned at lower severities

allowing woodlands to develop (McComb and Loomis, 1944; Zicker, 1955; Grimm, 
1984; Ebinger and McClain, 1991; Bowles et al., 1994). Correspondingly, a network 
of lower fire severity (FRG Ē; orange) clearly appears along larger rivers across 
the former Prairie Peninsula (Fig. 21.2). 
A fire regime of frequent, light surface burns (FRG Ē; orange) historically 
extended south and east of the Prairie Peninsula, interrupted only by the 
Mississippi Alluvial Plain (FRG Ė; blue) and the mixed mesophytic region of West 
Virginia and Eastern Kentucky (FRG Ĕ; green). Here, on uplands, fire occurred 
in a variety of intensities and patchworks, creating mixes from grass and shrub 
openings to savannas, woodlands, and forests of oak and pine. Throughout the  
south, native forbs and wiregrass (Aristida) were well suited for light mosaic burning 
(Lemon, 1967; Walker and Peet, 1983), as were the southern pines (Greene, 1931; 
Chapman, 1932ab; Wright and Bailey, 1982; Landers, 1991; Wade et al., 2000). 
Stand-replacing, crown fires undoubtedly occurred under favorable fuel and weather 
(drought) conditions, adding to the landscape mosaic of age classes and vegetative 
types. Topographically protected areas, riparian zones, and swamps burned much 
less readily and harbored a greater collection of fire-sensitive plants. These areas 
occurred along larger coastal rivers and wetlands (FRG V; Fig. 21.2). 
A fire regime of infrequent, mosaic-like surface burns (FRG Ĕ; green) formed 
a historic interface between the “hotter” systems of the south and central states 
and cool, largely incombustible hardwoods to the north (Fig. 21.2). Here, a mix 
of fire-tolerant and fire-sensitive vegetation types occurred according to topography, 
landscape position, soils, and firebreaks (Grimm, 1984; Seischab, 1990; Cogbill 
et al., 2002; Whitney and DeCant, 2003). On drier uplands (coarse-textured soils, 
interfluves, ridgetops) periodic surface burns favored fire-dependent species of 
pine, oak, aspen, and birch. This burning regime allowed the famed northern 
pineries of jack, red (P. resinosa), and white pine (P. strobus) to develop on sandy 
outwash plains (Kilburn, 1960; Whitney, 1986; Cleland et al., 2004). On moister 
portions of the landscape (fine-textured soil, coves, riparian areas), fire impacts 
were much less, favoring mesophytic trees of beech (Fagus), maple (Acer), elm 
(Ulmus) and ash (Fraxinus) (Kaatz 1955). 
Infrequent, stand-replacement fire regimes (FRG ĕ; yellow) were best 
represented by sub-boreal conifer forests (black and white spruce (Picea mariana 
and glauca), jack pine, balsam fir (Abies balsamea), tamarack (Larix laricina)) 
that extended southward from Canada into northern Minnesota and Maine. Fire 
was rare (FRG Ė; blue) in certain northern landscapes where mesic ice-contact 
tills and wet-mesic glacio-lacustrine deposits supported beech-maple, elm-ash, 
northern hardwoods, and conifer-northern hardwoods. Fire was also limited in 
the Mississippi Alluvial Plain where flooding was the primary disturbance agent 
(Grimmett, 1989; Nelson, 1997; Foti, 2001; Tingle et al., 2001). Here, hydrophilic 
species dominate, such as bald cypress (Taxodium distichum), tupelo (Nyssa 
aquatica), and sweet gum (Liquidambar styraciflua). 
Contemporary fire regimes are vastly more subdued across the Eastern United 
States (Fig. 21.3). Extensive stretches of FRG Ė (blue) correspond with highly

productive agricultural regions of the Midwest (Iowa and Southern Minnesota 
eastward through Ohio), the Mississippi Alluvial Plain, and along the Southeast 
Piedmont. The largely fire-resistant northern hardwood systems of Northern 
Wisconsin, Upper Peninsula of Michigan, Northern Pennsylvania, and New England 
also fall in this group. The remainder of the East was principally classified as 
FRGs Ĕ (green) and ĕ (yellow) that burn infrequently, every 35  200 yrs. 
There has been a dramatic “cooling” of the Eastern U.S. landscape when 
comparing past and current fire regimes (Fig. 21.4). This trend is consistent with 
the historical record, which points towards wholesale fire reduction, both 
spatially and temporally, across the East (Pyne, 1982; Abrams, 1992; Cutter and 
Guyette, 1994; Stewart 2002). The suppression of fire was due to convergence of 
events, including elimination of Native burning, building of road networks 
(providing fire breaks and access), forest/prairie conversion to croplands (fuel 
change/reduction), and aggressive 20th century fire fighting. 
 
Figure 21.4 Past-to-current fire regime change map based on spatial analysis of 
PNV (past) and AVHRR-NCLD (current) fire regime maps. Positive values represent 
shifts towards more fire, whereas negative values represent shifts to less fire. The 
departure from zero relates to the extent of fire regime change 

21 Altered Disturbance Regimes: the Demise of Fire in the Eastern United States 
315
The largest reductions of fire (depicted in blue) were centered in the Midwest 
forming a crescent from southern Minnesota through northern Ohio. Here, the 
conversion of historic grasslands and open woodlands to an agriculture-dominated 
landscape largely explains this abrupt change (Wells, 1970; Iverson and Risser, 
1987). The few areas not converted to agricultural production (cropland or 
pasturage) were quickly occupied by trees due to fire suppression (Loomis and 
McComb, 1944; Cottam, 1949). Agricultural conversion and fire exclusion, in 
concert, largely explain why tallgrass prairies and oak savannas are now considered 
the rarest ecosystems of North America (Nuzzo, 1986). Success of restoring open 
systems quickly diminishes upon conversion to closed-canopied forests (Anderson 
et al., 2000). 
Substantial reductions of fire (represented by aqua-greens) stretched across the 
southern two-thirds of the Eastern United States, excluding the Mississippi Alluvial 
Plain and the mixed mesophytic region of West Virginia and eastern Kentucky, 
which remained largely unchanged (yellow). Here, in the absence of fire, pine- 
and oak-dominated systems are readily converting to fire-sensitive, shade-tolerant 
species (Chapman, 1932b; Fralish et al., 1991). Eastern oak forests are illustrative 
of the ecological ramifications of these changes (Appendix A). 
Slight decreases in fire regime (light green) were found in northern Minnesota 
(consistent with Heinselman, 1973) and on the Tipton Till Plain of Indiana and 
Ohio extending eastward across most of southern and central New England. Here, 
depending on site conditions, sugar and red maple (Acer saccharum; A. rubrum) 
have been major benefactors of fire reduction (Abrams, 1992). These mesophytic 
species further “fire-proof” conditions by deep shading (promoting cooler and 
moister understory conditions) and producing non-flammable fuel beds (moist, 
rapidly decaying woody debris; wet, flaccid foliage accumulation in the fall). 
Some exceptions to the above trends exist, though fire increases (oranges and 
reds) were less pronounced and generally scattered in small pockets (Fig. 21.4). 
The most conspicuous concentrations of increased burning were in Maine and 
Northern Wisconsin and Michigan. The projected increase in fire in the Upper 
Great Lakes states is probably an artifact of elevated levels of aspen-birch and 
off-site pine plantations (both fire-dependent forest types) on former Northern 
hardwood sites. The fire increase in Maine might be anomaly, given sequential 
decreases in area burned over the past century (Fahey and Reiners, 1981). However, 
some of the largest fires in Maine did occur in 1947 (Patterson, 1991), which 
would reflect in the current vegetation (and thus the current fire regime). Lastly, 
the generalness of PNV classes used to depict past fire regimes (northern 
hardwood-spruce forests; FRG Ė) compared to the preciseness of AVHRR-NLCD 
classes for current fire regimes (spruce-fir; FRG ĕ) might further explain this 
portrayed increase. As such, the coarse-scale maps generated by this analysis must 
be used with caution and limited to general application and interpretation.

Appendix A The Eastern Oak Story 
Oaks historically covered a large portion of the Eastern United States, forming 
common associations with pine, chestnut, and hickory. These fire-dependent 
systems were maintained by frequent, Native-ignited surface burns. Europeans 
profoundly altered the disturbance regime through land use and non-native species 
introduction. The first wave of logging concentrated on Eastern white pine—a 
preferred timber-producing tree. Thereafter, hardwoods (oaks, chestnut, and 
hickories) were harvested and oftentimes maintained through repetitive clear 
cutting, which encouraged sprout regeneration. This intense harvesting regime 
coupled with recurring wildfires largely favored hardwoods over conifers (i.e. 
pines). Three significant things happened in the early portion of the twentieth 
century: ķ harvesting eased ĸ chestnut blight (effectively wiping out American 
chestnut), and Ĺ active fire suppression (the “Smokey Bear” campaign). These 
interrelated phenomena allowed oaks to dominate and form closed-canopied 
forests. Over the past century, native ground cover largely decreased due to low 
light levels, lack of surface fires, and unprecedented white-tailed deer foraging. In 
the meantime, fire-sensitive, shade tolerant mesophytic species (sugar and red maple, 
beech, black cherry, black gum) have flourished and now dominate understories. 
Under these conditions, overstory oak is quickly replaced by subordinate mesophytic 
trees upon death. Gypsy moth (an introduced insect) further accelerates this 
transition by preferentially attacking and weakening overstory oaks, causing their 
early demise and replacement. Without ecological restoration in the form of 
silvicultural treatments (thinning and prescribed burning), these systems will 
continue to decline (in terms of species richness and ecological function), 
converting from oak to mesophytic forests within a generation. Effects on native 
wildlife populations dependent of large-seeded trees producing acorns and nuts 
are equally imperil.

Abstract This study is to predict fire spread behavior and burned area 
across two fire-prone landscapes with contrasting vegetation (Oak-dominated 
ecosystem in WI vs. pine-dominated ecosystem in NJ), fuel-type composition, 
and land-use history regulated by the effects of weather, landscape structure 
and land management by combining simulations from three models (FARSITE, 
HARVEST, AND FRAGSTATS) under different scenarios. The results 
demonstrate: ķ substantial differences in fire-spread patterns between the 
two landscapes were observed when holding weather conditions constant

and excluding roads, indicating that landscape fragmentation is a main 
controlling factor on fire spread at the landscape level; ĸ roads functioning 
as barriers could significantly reduce the burned area from fire spread; and 
Ĺ Harvesting effects showed different trends, depending on landscape fuel 
type composition and weather conditions. At 4% harvesting intensity, both 
clustered and dispersed methods showed no significant impact (a 0.01) on 
reducing the mean burned area across the more fragmented WI landscape, but 
showed significant effects on fire spread in the less fragmented NJ landscape 
in summer when weather was hot and dry. 
Keywords Fire spread, burned area, landscape, fire model and weather 
condition 
22.1 Introduction 
There is a growing concern over catastrophic fires in the U.S. in recent years 
(http://www.usgs.gov/themes/Wildfire/fire.html). These fires can degrade environ- 
mental quality and wildlife habitat, destroy buildings and cost human life, reduce 
wood production, and increase firefighting costs. For example, the unusual fire 
season of 2000 consumed 3 million hectares across the country. Nearly a billion 
and a half dollars alone were spent on fire suppression in 2002—the second largest 
fire season in the last 50 years (Graham 2003).  
At landscape level, wildfire spread and behavior are determined by many factors, 
including weather, fuel loading and type, topography, landscape structure, road 
density, and human activities and land use (Pyne et al., 1996; Rollins et al., 2002). 
While the physics of fire spread are well known at fine spatial and temporal scales 
(e.g., individual trees and forest stands, seconds to hours) (Rothermel 1983), 
examination of factors determining the variability of fire spread patterns over entire 
landscape is more complex and deserves greater attention. 
The prediction of burned area (BA) across the landscape is a very important 
element in planning fire suppression efforts and reducing wildfire damage. Fire 
effects are often examined at the stand level after a single fire event and are 
difficult to link with landscape-scale processes without the application of models 
(Keane et al., 1989). Modeling is an efficient and practical approach to help 
understand and predict fire effects at landscape scales or larger because models 
simplify complex processes and systems for improved human understanding 
(Kercher and Axelrod 1984; Hunt Jr. et al., 1999; Finney and Andrews 1999; Miller 
and Urban 1999). It also allows us to test various fire cause-and-effect scenarios 
from economic, physical, social, ecological, and management perspectives that 
are almost impossible to be discerned in the field.  
Timber harvesting is a major human-derived disturbance that alters landscape 
structure, thus affecting fire spread. Previous reports on the subject have 
generated conflicting, sometimes contradictory findings. On one hand, some

recent data (1980 through 1999) suggest that logging activity increase BA 
(http://www.wildrockies.org/wildfire/), because logged areas tend to increase rate 
of fire spread and fire intensity by increasing fuel loading and creating additional 
corridors (Huff et al. 1995; Anderson 1982). On the other hand, harvesting can 
fragment the fuel complex and disrupt local fire growth, thereby increasing fire 
suppression effectiveness (Stratton 2004). Nevertheless, quantifying the effects 
of different harvesting methods on fire spread across landscapes is rare. 
This study will examine the effects of weather, landscape structure, and land 
management on fire spread in two landscapes. We combine 3 models to conduct 
hypothetical simulations over a 15-day period to obtain a more-complete picture 
of how changes in landscape patch heterogeneity and fuel type composition could 
affect landscape fire spread. This Chapter is designed to answer four specific 
questions from a landscape perspective: ķ How fire spread is affected by landscape 
structure? ĸ Does harvest increase or decrease surface fire spread across the 
landscapes? Ĺ Is there a significant difference in harvesting methods on fire 
spread? And ĺ does the above influences on fire spread vary by seasonal, and, if 
so, to what degree? 
The definition of landscape structure in this study refers to: ķ the heterogeneity 
and spatial arrangement of different fuel patches across the entire landscape, and 
ĸ fuel type compositions across the landscape; because changes in either one can 
significantly affect the simulation results. 
22.2 Methods and Materials 
22.2.1 Study Areas 
Two temperate forest landscapes in the eastern USA (Fig. 22.1) were selected for 
examining landscape-level effects on fire spread and behaviors. Both are fire-prone 
ecosystems with contrasting vegetation (a Oak-dominated ecosystem in WI vs. 
pine-dominated ecosystem in NJ), fuel-type composition, and land-use history (a 
highly fragmented and managed landscape in WI vs. a less fragmented landscape 
without harvesting activity for the last 100 years in NJ). 
22.2.1.1 NJ Pinelands 
The 38,150 ha sub-area of the Pinelands used in this study is flat with mean 
elevation of 39 m, ranging from 12  65 m. The majority of the study area is State 
Forest and a NJ wildlife management area, and some land is in federal ownership 
on Fort Dix Army Base. Thus, recent human interference (e.g. harvesting and 
urbanization) is minimal. The long-term (1930  2004) annual mean temperature 
of the area is 12.0ć, and annual precipitation is 1123182 mm. The pine-oak

There are 5 more fuel types in the NJP landscape but all were grouped into the 
category of others to illustrate substantial difference in fuel type composition between 
the two landscapes 
landscape is characterized by highly volatile fuels and sandy soils with a low water 
holding capacity (http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/global/research/fire.html). 
New Jersey’s Pinelands occupy 22% of the state (http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/global/ 
pubs/maps_posters/pdfs/firepine.pdf) and depend on fire to regenerate and maintain 
its composition and structure. Sixty-two percent of the Pinelands are upland forests 
comprised largely of three communities; ķ Oak/Pine, consisting of black oak 
(Quercus velutina), chestnut oak (Q. prinus), white oak (Q. alba), and pitch (Pinus 
rigida) and shortleaf pine (P. echinata), ĸ Pine/Oak, consisting of pitch pine with 
mixed oaks in the overstory, and Ĺ Pine/Scrub Oak, consisting of pitch pine with 
scrub oaks (Q. ilicifolia, Q. marlandica) in the understory (McCormick and Jones

1973, Lathrop and Kaplan 2004). All stands have ericaceous understories, primarily 
huckleberry (Gaylussacia bacata) and blueberries (Vaccinium spp.). Sedges, mosses 
and lichens are also present. Wetland forests communities include Pitch Pine 
lowlands, mixed Oaks, and Atlantic White Cedar (Chamaecyparis thyoides) swamps. 
22.2.1.2 Wisconsin Oak-Dominated Forests 
The 39,350 ha study area is located in the Washburn Ranger District of the 
Chequamengon national forest (CNF) in Northern Wisconsin, USA. The topography 
of the area is flat to gently rolling with elevations ranging from 232 459 m. The 
area in general has deep, coarse-textured soils. The climate is characterized by a 
short/hot summer with a growing season of 120  140 days, and cold winters. 
Annual precipitation ranges from 660  700 mm (Albert 1995) while annual mean 
temperature is about 4.7ć. Historically, the area was occupied primarily by jack 
pine (Pinus banksiana Lambert), red pine (Pinus resinosa Aiton), and several 
oaks (Quercus spp.) and is now dominated by red oak (Quercus rubra L.), sugar 
maple (Acer succharum Marsh), paper birch (Betula papyrifera Marsh), and aspen 
(Populus spp.) (Radeloff et al. 1999). Six dominant land-cover types in the study 
area are Oak, jack pine, red pine, mixed Oak/conifer, regenerating forest/shrub, 
and non-forested bare ground (Bresee et al. 2004). The dominant fuel type in the 
area is forest with under story (50.2%) after the cover types were grouped into 
fuel types following Anderson’s (1982) classification system. 
22.2.2 Study design 
22.2.2.1 Fire Ignition Locations and Fuel Type Assignments 
For each landscape, 24 fire ignition points were randomly generated after being 
stratified by major fuel types (13 nationally recognized fuel categories; Anderson 
1982). There were 3 to 6 replicates for each fuel type depending on its weighted 
area of the total landscape. The fuel maps were developed using the 2001 land- 
cover map from Bresee et al. (2004) for the CNF and the 2001 land-cover map 
provided by the Grant F. Walton center for remote sensing and spatial analysis 
(CRSSA), Rutgers University (Lathrop and Kaplan 2004) for the NJP. Land cover, 
fuel type composition and patch mosaics differ appreciably between the 2 landscapes 
(Table 22.1, Fig. 22.1).  
22.2.2.2 Management Scenarios and Simulations 
We considered roads as fire barriers in our FARSITE simulations and compared 
these to the results from control runs without road effects. The CNF road map 
was provided by the USDA Forest Service (http://www.fs.fed.us/r9/cnnf/ftp/ 
forest_files/). We used paved (road level B) and gravel with greater width (road 
level C) roads for comparison purposes. For the NJP road map, we used primary 

 
Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
328 
highway and secondary roads from the US Census Tiger Dataset (www.esri.com/ 
data/download/census2000_tigerline/index.html#datainfo). 
To detect effects of landscape structure and fuel type composition on fire 
spread (Question 1), hypothetical simulations were conducted by applying 15-day 
weather data collected in August 2  17, 2002 in both landscapes (i.e., weather 
was kept constant while varying the landscapes). In this particular test, roads 
were excluded to simplify the analysis. Additionally, we created two alternative 
fuel maps by assigning different fuel types to some land-cover types in the NJP 
to detect how changes in fuel-type composition could have on BA. One map had 
a similar mean rate of fire spread (MROS, 173 m/hr) to that in the control landscape 
of CNF (183 m/hr). The other map had a much higher MROS for NJP (334 m/hr) 
than that in the control landscape, which we think is closer to reality due to 
differences in fuel type composition (pine vs. oak) between the two landscapes. 
The MROS was calculated using the rate of spread defined by Anderson (1982) 
for various fuel types and multiplying by their corresponding fractions of land 
area to the entire landscape, then summed up to mean burned area (MBA, ha). 
To illustrate how forest practices can affect fire spread across the landscape 
(Questions 2 and 3), we used the HARVEST 6.1 model (Gustafson and Crow 
1996) to generate hypothetical landscapes imposing 4% cutting with two different 
methods, clustered (clearcuts) and dispersed (select cutting), in both the CNF and 
the NJP, then compared the results to those in the control landscapes. 
To examine seasonal variation of fire spread (Question 4), we used daily 
weather data in August of 2002 (8/2-8/17) and April of 2004 (4/3-4/18, the April 
data in 2002 was unavailable and April data in 2003 had missing days) in the 
CNF recorded by meteorological equipments mounted on an eddy covariance 
flux tower (Noorments et al. 2004). The meteorological measurements were 
programmed to record data every 20 seconds and output 30-minute means to a 
data logger. In the NJP, meteorological data were collected from three weather 
towers, one located in each of the dominant upland forest communities; an 
Oak/Pine forest at Silas little experimental forest, a Pine/Oak forest at Fort Dix, 
and a Pine/Scrub oak forest located at the Cedar Bridge fire tower. Continuous 
meteorological measurements were made from each tower. Meteorological data 
was recorded with automated data loggers (CR23x, Campbell Scientific). 
The selections of data periods (hereafter referred to as spring and summer, 
respectively) were determined using our best judgment on usefulness of weather 
data and its availability at each landscape. For example, August of 2004 in the 
NJP was affected by the hurricane season and there was a 1000-year storm event 
on 7/12 (21.7 cm of rain in one day) and consequently, June to July data were 
used for the NJP landscape. The simulated results from these data are useful for 
illustrating general patterns of seasonal fire spread and comparison between the 
two landscapes because fires are affected by weather in addition to other factors. 
We also conducted sensitivity analyses to examine the effects of wind speed on 
fire spread by increasing wind speed to 40 km/hr in both landscapes.

22.2.3 Model Linkage and Applications 
22.2.3.1 FARSITE 
Quantitative understanding of the interactions between landscape structure and 
disturbances such as fire spread is one of the major focuses of landscape ecology. 
Three models (FARSITE, HARVEST, and FRAGSTATS) were linked to conduct 
integrative analyses (Fig. 22.2). We used a fire growth model FARSITE (Finney 
1998) to simulate fire spread across our landscapes. The model can predict both 
surface and crown fires, however surface fire spread was only used to simplify 
the analyses for comparison because most fires in the CNF are low-intensity 
surface fires (Sturtevant et al. 2004) and both landscapes are relatively flat. The 
required inputs for FARSITE include two ASCII files for weather conditions and 
five grid layers at 30 m resolution representing landscape structure, vegetation and 
topography. The five layers were: ķ elevation, ĸ slope, Ĺ aspect, ĺ fuel type, 
and Ļ degree of canopy closure (Fig. 22.2). The topographic files were derived 
from 3-arc DEM data. The canopy closure file was developed and rescaled to 
0%  100% based on the Normalized Difference vegetation Index (NDVI) values 
(0  1) that were calculated from the red and infrared channels of the Landsat 7 
data (Rouse et al. 1973). The Landsat TM-based fuel maps were developed from 
the land-cover maps in the CNF (Bresee et al. 2004) and NJP (Lathrop and 
Kaplan 2004) and categorized by Anderson (1982) fuel type (Table 22.1). 
It is also well known that weather and landscape structure interact to affect fire 
spread. Thus, separating these two effects is desired for increasing our understanding 
of fire ecology and providing insights for improved fire management at the 
landscape level. In each landscape, we ran the FARSITE model for 24 randomly 
selected fire ignition points stratified by major fuel types within a 15-day period.

22.2.3.2 HARVEST 
The HARVEST model is primarily a landscape-level, harvesting allocation simulator 
designed to evaluate alternative strategies of forest management and timber 
harvests and provide comparable predictions of the spatial pattern consequences 
of these alternative strategies (Gustafson and Crow 1996). Three fuel maps were 
created for each landscape; a control (fuel map with no harvest), and two fuel 
maps representing “clustered” and “dispersed” harvests with a cutting level of 4% 
using the model (http://ncrs.fs.fed.us/4153/Harvest/harvhome.asp). The harvesting 
units were set with an average of 10 ha with a 5 ha standard deviation, while 
minimum and maximum units were 1 ha and 20 ha, respectively, without buffer 
area. For the simulation, the HARVEST model randomly selected a place to 
clearcut (clustered and dispersed shape) according to the patch size and age of a 
stand, where dispersed is more irregular shape with more edge. After forest was 
cleared, the fuel type assignment was simply changed from forest categories 8, 9, 
or 10 to harvested category 11 (logging slash/swamp).

22.2.3.3 FRAGSTATS 
We used FRAGSTATS (McGarical and Marks, 1995), a spatial pattern analysis 
program, to quantify the landscape structures in the CNF and NJP landscapes. 
The characteristics of quantified landscape structures were then linked to fire 
spread across the landscapes. 
22.3 Results 
Substantial differences in fire-spread patterns between the two landscapes were 
observed when holding weather conditions constant and excluding roads in our 
simulations. The MBA of 24 fires after a 15-day burning period was 3,867 ha on 
the CNF versus 4,177 ha on the NJP using the same weather inputs. This 8% 
MBA difference was surprising given that the MROS differed by 83% between 
the two landscapes (183 vs.334 m/hr). Spatial variation in BA across the NJP (930 
and 1,773 ha, respectively) was much larger than that in the CNF (795 ha). This 
strongly indicates that land cover fragmentation is substantially controlling fire 
spread at the landscape level (Finney 2000) because the topographic differences 
were minimal between the two landscapes and road effects were excluded. Four 
landscape-level indices clearly demonstrated that the CNF landscape was roughly 
twice as fragmented as the NJP landscape (Fig. 22.3).

periods without significant seasonal difference (Fig. 22.4). In the NJP, the averaged 
BAs were 1,503 ha and 2,515 ha for spring and summer periods, respectively.

effects were considered) of 24 fire ignition locations across the landscapes in the 
Chequamegon National Forest (CNF) and the New Jersey Pinelands (NJP). Vertical 
bars represent one standard deviation 
Our simulations indicated that roads functioning as barriers could significantly 
reduce the BA of fire spread. In the CNF, road effects reduced the MBA by 71% 
and 66% for the spring and summer periods, respectively; compared to 25% and 
30% for spring and summer, respectively, in the NJP. Much larger road effects in 
the CNF were partly due to the higher road density (0.63 km/km2) than that in the 
NJP (0.33 km/km2) (Table 22.2). In both landscapes, interacting with weather 
conditions further complicated the road effects on fire spread. The more favorite 
weather for fire spread, the larger road effects on reducing BAs are expected 
(Table 22.2).

Harvesting effects showed different trends, depending on landscape fuel type 
composition and weather conditions. At 4% harvesting intensity, both clustered 
and dispersed methods showed no significant impact (a  0.01) on reducing the 
mean burned area across the more fragmented CNF landscape, but showed 
significant effects on fire spread in the less fragmented NJP landscape in summer 
(Fig. 22.5) when weather condition (hot/dry) was more favorable to fire spread 
(Table 22.2). The clustered harvesting resulted in a slight reduction in MBA in 
NJ during the spring period. Relative changes in MBA caused by harvesting 
practices in a more fragmented landscape (CNF) were much smaller (< 2.5% in 
absolute value) than those in the NJP landscape with much less fragmentation 
and higher MROS (up to 17%, Fig. 22.5).

22.4 Discussion 
Our simulations revealed that both landscape structure (e.g., spatial arrangement 
of patches and degree of fragmentation) and fuel type composition can significantly 
affect fire spread across the landscapes when weather is held constant. Our 
results clearly indicated that increases in both fragmentation and rate of spread 
generally increased the size of MBA. However, how these two variables interact 
across the landscape was the key to determine MBA. For example, the fuel-based 
MROS in the CNF was 183 m/hr, which resulted in a landscape mean burned 
area of 3,867 ha (Table 22.2). When we assigned the fuel types in the NJP with a 
similar MROS (173 m/hr) to that of the CNF, the mean burned area across the 
landscape was only 1,630 ha, 58% smaller than that in the CNF, reconfirming our 
previous conclusion that landscape fragmentation was another controlling factor 
for fire spread across the landscape. Quantified landscape indices showed that the 
degree of fragmentation in the CNF was, on average, about twice as that in the 
NJP (Fig. 22.3). If both the degree of fragmentation and fuels’ MROS in landscape 
A is higher than those in landscape B, the difference in burned area should be 
enhanced between the two landscapes. If one factor is higher while the other is lower 
in one versus the other landscape, then the effects of the two factors on fire spread 
will be contradictory, hence moderating each another. Our results have demonstrated 
such combined effects. Because the NJP landscape was much less fragmented than 
that of the CNF landscape and the effect of increasing fuels’ MROS overcame 
the effect of decreasing landscape fragmentation in the NJP (Fig. 22.3). 
Spatial variation (measured by STD) of fire spread across the NJP landscape 
was higher than that in the CNF landscape. This is likely because there were 3 
additional grass fuel categories (not presented in the CNF) in the NJP that have 
much faster fire-spread rates. If a fire reaches these fuel types it can greatly 
increase the size of its perimeter, even with the same weather. 
While the combination of temperature and moisture conditions in the weather 
input was the most influencing environmental factor on fire spread across the 
landscape, wind speed can also enhance fire spread across the landscapes (Table 
22.2). To better understand that relationship, we ran the FARSITE model in the 
control NJP and CNF landscapes by increasing wind speed to 40 km/hr in spring 
(when both landscapes had similar mean wind speeds (4.1 km/hr in the CNF vs. 
3.3 km/hr in the NJP), Table 22.2) while keeping all other inputs as the same. 
Consequently, landscape mean fire-spread area increased by about 8 times in the 
NJP and 5 times in the CNF landscape, suggesting that an increase in wind speed 
has greater enhancement power on fire spread across landscape that possesses 
higher fuels’ MROS. However, the simulated spread areas using 40 km/hr wind 
input should be interpreted with caution because in both landscapes it is rare to 
have such a high wind speed consistently over a 15 day period. 
The actual fire-spread areas on the ground within the NJP landscape could   
be larger than our simulated results for two reasons. First, our simulations dealt

with the surface fire only for comparison purposes because most fires in the 
oak-dominated CNF landscape are low-intensity surface fires (Sturtevant et al. 
2004) while crown fires in the pine-dominated NJP landscape could be an 
influencing factor on fire spread. Second, Anderson’s (1982) fuel classification 
system was primarily developed for the Western USA, thus, it may not quite 
match the unique characteristics of the vegetation and fuel types in the Eastern 
USA (http://www.fs.fed.us/ne/global/research/fire.html).  
If roads are treated as fire barriers, our results as expected showed an inverse 
relationship between road density and mean area burned (Table 22.2). However, 
the degree of reduction in BA related to roads was not proportional to the change 
in road density between the two landscapes, nor had the same degree of reduction 
between seasons, even within the same landscape, indicating the road effects on 
BA are non-linear and complicated other interacting factors such as weather, 
landscape structure, and fuel characteristics. Furthermore, the road effects on fire 
spread could go in opposite directions (e.g., increasing fire spread) if human 
factors are considered. More roads often equates to increased area accessible by 
people, resulting in higher fire ignition frequency and, thus, increasing fire spread 
across landscapes (http://www.uecutah.org/where%20there%20is%20smoke.htm). 
For example, humans caused over 97% of all fire ignitions in the northern forests of 
the upper Midwest during the 1980’s and 1990’s (Cardille et al. 2001). Therefore, 
future studies on fire spread and behavior should incorporate human and social 
factors, especially in densely populated areas to improve our current understandings 
on the topic. 
Seasonal changes in fire spread should be strongly associated with how energy 
and water conditions were combined. In the CNF, MBA only differed by 1.5% 
between spring and summer because the overall effects of whether conditions  
in spring (dry but cool) and in summer (warm but wet) on fire spread were 
contradictory to each other (Table 22.2). In the NJP it showed 67% difference in 
MBA between spring and summer because of sharp weather contrasts, with cool 
and wet springs vs. warm and dry summers (Table 22.2), thus enhancing the 
seasonal effects of weather on fire spread (Fig. 22.4). Our results suggested that 
differences in BAs between seasons should not be necessarily larger than the 
changes within the season across landscape. Such differences primarily depend on 
a combination of weather conditions, although climate can be used to differentiate 
the fire regimes in general. Spatial variations in BA for a given landscape seemed 
to be determined by landscape mosaic and fuel type composition but not by the 
variations in weather condition (Fig. 22.4). 
The effects of harvesting (e.g., spatial arrangement, treatment method) on fire 
spread were complicated by interactions with landscape fragmentation, fuel type, 
and weather. In the CNF, both harvesting practices reduced burned area slightly 
and the cluster method showed more effects than the dispersed method did on 
fire spread. In contrast, harvesting practices tended to increase burned area and 
dispersed method showed more effects than clustered method did on fire spread

in the NJP. Such influence was more evident and significant under weather 
conditions that are favorable to fire spread (Fig. 22.5). Following reasons could 
cause this inconsistency. When harvesting was conducted within the landscapes, 
it caused two changes simultaneously: ķ the MROS was generally reduced in 
both landscapes because fuel type 11 (logging slash) had 24% lower fuel intensity 
than type 10 (occupying 50% in the CNF) and 20% lower than type 9 (occupying 
62% in the NJP, Table 22.1), thus slowing fire spread; and ĸ both landscapes 
became more fragmented, which could increase fire spread. In the CNF, the effects 
of reducing MROS seemed to outweigh the effects of increasing fragmentation in 
an already highly fragmented landscape, resulting in less than expected corridor 
effects on increasing fire spread. Consequently, harvesting reduced the amount of 
area burned. In the NJP landscape where has been no harvests conducted in the 
past 100 years, the effects of increasing fragmentation across the landscape was 
larger than the effects of reducing MROS, thus, harvesting tended to increase fire 
spread. Furthermore, harvesting can cause more effects on fire spread under extreme 
weather conditions that are favorable to fire spread (Fig. 22.5). 
Harvests can altered landscape structure in several ways such as fragmenting 
the fuel complex, creating open areas for easier fire spread, or disrupting local 
fire growth patterns (Stratton 2004). Some of these changes can be favorable or 
unfavorable for fire spread depending on the interactions with other contributing 
factors. In the CNF, our results suggested that the clustered method had greater 
effects on reducing fire spread than the dispersed method possibly due to the 
disruption of fuel connectivity in a already fragmented landscape. In the much 
less fragmented NJP landscape, however, dispersed method showed more effects 
on fire spread than the clustered method probably due to enhancing the corridor 
effects and improving the fire ventilation across a landscape having a much 
higher MROS. In both landscapes, harvesting practices showed more effects on 
fire spread in summer than in spring (Fig. 22.5). Evaluation of harvesting 
methods on BA was confounded by varying weather conditions throughout the 
year and interactions with other factors such as fuel type composition and 
landscape fragmentation; therefore, it deserves more studies in the future. 
22.5 Conclusions 
Burned areas in general were larger in the NJP landscape due to highly volatile 
fuels, compared to the CNF landscape when weather inputs were held constant. 
Our results indicated that fire spread was associated with landscape fragmentation. 
The combined effects of fuel-type composition and landscape fragmentation 
ultimately determined the differences in fire-spread areas and spatial patterns 
between the two landscapes if other controlling factors are considered constants.  
In a more fragmented Oak-dominated landscape in northern Wisconsin, both 
clustered and dispersed harvesting methods with 4% cutting intensity could

reduce burned areas up to 2.4%, compared to those in the control landscape. 
Although the clustered method reduced more areas both in spring and summer, 
such reductions were not significantly different (a 0.01). In the less fragmented 
NJP landscape, 4% cutting could significantly increase burned areas compared to 
the control landscape, especially under extreme weather conditions that favor fire 
spread. Seasonal variation in fire-spread area is not necessarily larger than within- 
season variation in fire-spread area, depending on combinations of weather 
conditions during the period that fires occurred.  
Our results showed that roads as physical barriers could significantly reduce 
fire spread across the landscape depending on existing road density. However, road 
effects on fire spread could have the opposite effect (e.g., increasing fire spread) 
if human factors (ignitions) are considered. Road effects can be enhanced when 
weather conditions are more favorable to fire spread. 
This study suggests that effects of harvesting methods on fire spread are more 
complicated and vary with other fire controlling factors such as land-use history, 
fuel type composition and weather conditions. Thus, forest management planning 
should be flexible and aim to the characteristics of given landscape to minimize 
fire spread. As such, more studies on this from a landscape-oriented perspective 
are desired.

Abstract The objectives of the fire mapping and monitoring theme of the 
global observation of forest and landcover dynamics (GOFC-GOLD) program 
are to refine and articulate the international requirements for fire related

and future observing systems for fire management, policy decision-making 
and global change research and to ensure the provision of long-term, systematic 
satellite observations necessary for the production of the full suite of 
recommended fire products. The GOFC-GOLD Fire Implementation Team 
also fostered the development of regional networks of data providers and users 
to capture regional specific information needs and priorities. This chapter 
discusses specific goals of the program related to pre-fire evaluation, fire 
observations and post-fire assessment, and the implementation status of 
corresponding activities. Examples of contributory programs from US 
agencies are also presented.

making support; global change 
23.1 Introduction 
The global observation of forest cover- global observation of landcover dynamics 
(GOFC-GOLD) was initiated in response to the committee on earth observation 
(CEOS) to develop a stronger linkage between the Space Agencies and the users 
of earth observation technologies (Townshend et al., 2004). The observation 
technologies were being developed and research and development undertaken to 
provide new and improved satellite products for monitoring the earth surface but 
the full potential of these technologies was not being realized. It was recognized 
that in some cases there was a mismatch between the information that was being 
provided and that which was really needed by those responsible for the operational 
monitoring and management of earth resources and those undertaking global change 
research. It was recognized that there was the need for a better understanding of 
the observational requirements from the user community. In other cases potential 
users were simply unaware of the available technologies and in many cases there 
were obstacles to accessing and utilizing the data.  
GOFC-GOLD is currently a project of the global terrestrial observing system 
(GTOS), with a project office in Edmonton run by the Natural Resources Canada 
and the Canadian forest service (GOFC, 2007). The secretariat for GTOS is at the 
United Nations food and agriculture organization (FAO) in Rome (GTOS, 2005). 
A more detailed evolution of the GOFC-GOLD program can be found in 
Townshend et al., (2004). 
The fire phase of GOFC-GOLD was initiated in 1998 at a kick-off meeting at 
the Joint Research Center, Ispra (Ahern et al., 2001). At that meeting it was 
evident that the satellite fire observations fell largely in the research domain and 
that the products are often of unknown accuracy. It was also recognized that there 
is often parallel development of methods and techniques amongst different groups 
and that there are a number of opportunities for efficiencies through information

Figure 23.1 GOFC-GOLD within the overall structure of earth observation programs 
and data exchange. It was recognized that for fire information users, the products 
must be reliable with sustained data provision and that there is a need to transition 
proven techniques in the research domain to the operational agencies. It was also 
recognized that there are often a number of institutional obstacles to such transition, 
most often related to funding responsibility. There is also a need for better 
integration of satellite, aircraft and ground based information. It was strongly 
recommended at the meeting that GOFC-GOLD Fire establish strategic partnerships 
with other national and international organizations building on existing programs, 
addressing other aspects of fire monitoring and management. In particular every 
effort should be made to also make available information to users beyond the 
international organizations at the regional to local level.  
Since the 1998 kick-off meeting, GOFC-GOLD Fire has developed strategic 
partnerships with a number of organizations that share some of the program goals, 
for example with the U.N. Interagency strategy for disaster reduction (UNISDR) 
working group on wildland fire and its follow-up arrangements, the UNISDR 
global wildland fire network and the wildland fire advisory group, which is 
focusing on improving fire management capacity around the world. National fire 
reporting is inconsistent globally and is often of unknown accuracy. In many 
countries there is a scarcity of fire information and there is a need for better and 
timely information. To help coordinate and guide its fire program, GOFC-GOLD 
established a secretariat and a fire implementation team consisting of data 
providers and data users (GOFC FIRE, 2008). The aims of this team are to refine 
and articulate the international requirements for fire related observations, to 
increase access to and make the best possible use of existing and future observing 
systems for fire management, policy decision-making and global change research 
and ensure the provision of long-term, systematic satellite observations necessary

for the production of the full suite of recommended fire products (Justice et al., 
2003). The team is also involved in a number of global initiatives requiring 
international cooperation. Following the lead of the land cover component of 
GOFC-GOLD, the implementation team fostered the development of regional 
networks of data providers and users to capture regional specific information 
needs and priorities. Regional Fire Networks have been established in Southern 
Africa, Northern Eurasia, Southeast Asia and South America. The networks 
provide a forum for shared experience in fire observation and monitoring and 
opportunities for lateral transfer of technology. These networks complement and 
are coordinated with the regional fire management networks being developed by 
the UNISDR global wildland fire network. The implementation team set out the 
broad goals for the fire program and near term program objectives. 
23.2 GOFC-GOLD Fire Goals and Current Implementation 
Status 
23.2.1 To Increase User Awareness by Providing an Improved 
Understanding of the Utility of Satellite Fire Products for 
Resource Management and Policy Within the United Nations 
and at Regional, National and Local Levels 
The challenge for nations and the international community is to develop informed 
policy and management capabilities that recognize both the beneficial and 
traditional roles of fire, while reducing the incidence and extent of uncontrolled 
burning and its adverse impacts. A major impediment for efficient wildland fire 
management and for strategic planning is the lack of reliable data and information 
on the occurrence and extent of wildland fires and their effects (Ahern et al., 
2001). In most countries of the world there is also a lack of information on 
precursors of wildfires and fire use, such as weather-related information (wildland 
fire danger), ecosystem properties that influence fire behavior and fire severity 
(wildland fire hazard) and the probability of ignition (wildland fire risk). There  
is also a lack of internationally agreed standards for assessments, reporting   
and evaluation of the consequences of wildland fires. The development of a 
standardized wildland fire inventory system is urgently needed. However, even if 
an international consensus would be reached in future, it is evident that most 
countries do not have sufficient ground- or aircraft based systems for detection, 
monitoring and fire damage assessment. Thus, information generated by spaceborne 
instruments is essential to provide the information required. 
The United nations recently have shown an increasing interest to develop 
informal partnerships, joint projects and formal agreements among governments

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
346 
and between government and non-governmental institutions that are essential to 
enable nations to develop sustainable fire management capabilities. In 2001 
UNISDR provided a mechanism to facilitate a common policy dialogue at inter- 
agency and international levels. Starting in 2001 a working group on wildland 
fire was created within the UNISDR inter-agency task force for disaster reduction. 
Through this group the various UN specialized agencies, programmes and 
secretariats of conventions that have a direct or indirect responsibility in matters 
related to wildland fire shared their views and visions for a collective approach 
(UNISDR, 2008). In this working group the GOFC-GOLD fire implementation 
team provided concepts and visions for the coordinated use of satellite remote 
sensing (RS) of wildland fires. While the UN has to agree on a systematic and 
standardized approach in developing a global database on wildland fire, there is 
an increasing demand of countries on the other side to receive guidance and support 
for developing such databases. The UN and other international organizations also 
require spaceborne fire information—to mention a few examples: 
(1) United nations environment programme (UNEP)—for monitoring the 
environment effects of wildland fire 
(2) UN office for the coordination of humanitarian affairs (UN-OCHA)—for 
response to wildland fire disasters (with UNEP and GFMC) 
(3) FAO—for the regular global forest resources assessments 
(4) World health organization (WHO)—for providing guidance on response 
measures to reduce impacts of smoke pollution on human health and security 
(5) World meteorological organization (WMO)—for early warning of wildland 
fire danger and smoke trajectories 
(6) The “Rio conventions”—for the implementation of the mandates of the UN 
conventions on combat desertification (UNCCD), biological diversity (UNCBD) 
and the UN framework convention on climate change (UNFCCC) 
(7) The United nations forum on forests (UNFF)—for including forest fire 
management into the multi-year plan of work of the “Non-legally binding instrument 
on all types of forests” (2007) 
(8) The UN office for outer space affairs (OOSA) / UN Committee on the 
peaceful uses of outer space (COPUOS)—for satellite RS technology transfer to 
developing countries 
(9) The earth observation user Liaison Office for the humanitarian community— 
for providing accurate information updates on fast evolving situations for 
humanitarian relief and crisis prevention operations 
(10) United Nations University (UNU)—for conducting dedicated targeted 
research and training 
Driven by the interests of countries to create synergies in sharing fire management 
resources—including fire information systems—the Global Wildland Fire Network 
was established in 2003 as an outreach programme of UNISDR (GWFNa, 2008). 
Government and non-government institutions actively organized under the 
Regional Wildland Fire Networks are aiming at strengthening the dialogue between 

23 The GOFC-GOLD Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme: Assessment and Strategic Plans 
347
specialists and government agencies of neighbouring countries. Representatives 
of the Regional Wildland Fire Networks are members of the UNISDR Wildland 
Fire Advisory Group which is serving as an advisory body to the United Nations. 
There is a close working relationship with the regional GOFC-GOLD networks 
which are focussed on fire observations and monitoring. Both networks are 
interacting in regional consultations and workshops aiming at the preparation of 
targeted proposals to the international community, notably the UN family.  
Regional network consultations conducted in 2004 came up with recommendations 
directed to a ministerial conference at FAO (Rome, March 2005) to formulate an 
International Wildland Fire Accord. The ministerial meeting, however, rejected 
the proposal for an accord and instead recommended the development of 
“voluntary guidelines”; at the time of writing this Chapter the overall aims of 
these guidelines have not yet been defined (GWFNb, 2008). FAO also rejected 
the GOFC-GOLD proposal to utilize satellite RS products for a consistent global 
fire assessment within the Global Forest Resources Assessment 2005 (FAO, 2006). 
So far all proposals to set up a consistent global wildland fire monitoring pro- 
gramme under the umbrella of the UN have failed. However, the GOFC-GOLD 
Fire Implementation Team, through its involvement in the Wildland Fire Advisory 
Group and by facilitation through the Global Fire Monitoring Center (GFMC), 
continues to push the agenda at the UN level.  
23.2.2 To Encourage the Development and Testing of Standard 
Methods for Fire Danger Rating Suited to Different Eco- 
systems and to Enhance Current Fire Early Warning Systems 
23.2.2.1 Early Warning Systems and Fire Danger 
Fire danger rating (FAO, 1986) is a mature science and has long been used as a 
tool to provide early warning of the potential for serious wildfires. Fire danger 
rating systems (FDRS) utilize basic weather data to calculate wildfire potential. 
Fire danger is a general term used to express an assessment of both fixed and 
variable factors of the fire environment that determine the ease of ignition, rate of 
spread, difficulty of control, and fire impact (Merrill and Alexander, 1987). FDRS 
early warning information is often enhanced with satellite data such as hot spots 
for early fire detection, and spectral data on land cover type and indices of vegetation 
condition. More recently, remote sensed weather data is also being used to 
enhance the ground-based network of weather stations. Normally, these systems 
provide a 4  6 hour early warning of the highest fire danger for any particular 
day that the weather data is supplied. However, by using forecasted weather data, 
as much has 10 days of early warning can be provided. As well, FDRS indices 
can be calibrated with local data to provide longer term early warning, such as a 
30-day early warning tool developed for SE Asia to indicate the potential for

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
348 
disaster-level haze events from peatland fires (Field et al., 2004).  
23.2.2.2 Developing a Global Early Warning System 
The science to develop a global early warning system for wildland fire currently 
exists, but there are some technical issues to overcome. A daily operational global 
system will need large amounts of data and will require considerable processing 
capability. There are a number of regional examples demonstrating feasibility, 
and global implementation is essentially a technical issue of providing complete 
data coverage for all countries and regions, and scaling-up with standardized 
products. Implementing a global system will also require regional calibration of 
early warning indicators using danger level boundaries. This can be done using 
historical ground-based weather data and remotely sensed fire data such as hotspots 
and burned area maps. 
Advances in measuring spatial precipitation from space would offer the single 
largest improvement to the development of fire danger monitoring systems. Such 
advances would reduce or eliminate the need for spatial interpolation of precipitation 
from ground-based point sources, which in some regions has serious limitations. 
Even some countries that have established fire danger systems do not have a 
reliable, comprehensive network of ground-based precipitation stations that cover 
their fire regions. While it is recognized that space-based precipitation estimates 
also have limitations, combining those estimates with ground-based data as control 
points is expected to significantly improve the spatial modeling of this critical 
fire danger parameter. 
Establishing an operational global early warning system for wildland fire will 
require an international partnership of agencies. A weather data stream from 
WMO could provide the baseline data necessary to calculate fire danger. The 
WMO could also provide additional weather-based early warning products such 
as smoke trajectories and air pollution warnings. Such near real-time products are 
currently being generated from geostationary satellites. The GOFC-GOLD Fire 
Implementation Team is involved in exploring the use of satellite data for early 
warning and fire danger purposes including hot spots for early detection, land 
cover classification of fuel types, and perhaps spatial weather information    
(e.g., precipitation) for areas where ground-based weather data is sparse. Fire 
management data system expertise is needed to develop a system that integrates 
the disparate data sources and generates early warning indicators.
Establishing a global early warning system for wildland fire provides common 
criteria for comparing burning conditions and wildfire situations internationally. 
It also provides a globally-consistent method for quantifying fire danger, an 
important factor for promoting resource-sharing arrangements between nations. 
Perhaps most importantly, establishing a global early warning system would 
provide a formal system for the large number of developing countries that would 
never have the means to develop their own. It would also provide those countries 

23 The GOFC-GOLD Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme: Assessment and Strategic Plans 
349
with a substantial base of information to use in developing their own fire 
management capabilities. 
An immediate contribution that GOFC-GOLD can make to expand the 
international role of wildland fire danger rating. The first step would to be to 
promote an international fire weather index (FWI) system that is modeled on a 
working system. A suitable candidate is the Canadian Forest Fire weather index 
(FWI) System which has already been implemented in several locations around 
the world including Southeast Asia (de Groot et al., 2007), Mexico, New Zealand 
and in some states or fire agencies (Michigan, Minnesota, Alaska) within the 
USA. The FWI system consists of six components that account for the effects of 
fuel moisture and wind on fire behavior (Van Wagner, 1987). The system requires 
four continuous inputs (temperature, 24-hour precipitation, wind speed and 
relative humidity) to monitor the water balance in forests that are characterized 
by organic soils. However, the system could be adapted to measure fire danger in 
any wildland zone. 
In response to the request by the UN Secretary General, the Hyogo Framework 
for Action 2005  2015: “Building the Resilience of Nations and Communities to 
Disasters” and the preparation of the upcoming Third International Early 
Warning Conference (EWC-III, Bonn, Germany, March 2006) a project proposal 
on the development of Global Early Warning System for Wildland Fire has been 
submitted to the United Nations in October 2005. 
23.2.3 To Develop an Operational Global Geostationary Fire 
Network Providing Observations of Active Fires in Near 
Real Time 
The international environmental monitoring and scientific research communities 
have stressed the importance of utilizing operational satellites to produce routine 
fire products and to ensure long-term stable records of fire activity. Although a 
number of geostationary systems cover most of the Earths surface and in some 
cases with considerable overlap, there has been little coordination to date 
concerning fire monitoring. An operational global geostationary fire monitoring 
network would enable monitoring of fires as they occur and capture the diurnal 
signature of fire activity. 
Geostationary systems have an important contribution to make in providing 
multiple observations per day for active fire and smoke detection and 
characterization with applications in fire management, emissions and air quality 
studies, and global change research. A global geostationary fire monitoring network 
is technically feasible, but must be supported by the operational agencies in order 
to sustain the activity and produce standardized long-term data records and fire 
inventories of known accuracy.  
In an effort to coordinate international geostationary fire monitoring efforts the

GOFC-GOLD fire monitoring and implementation team and the EUropean 
organization for the exploitation of METeorological SATellites (EUMETSAT) 
hosted two workshops on geostationary fire monitoring and applications in 
Darmstadt, Germany in 2004 and 2006. The 2006 workshop was attended by over 
45 representatives from 18 countries in Europe, Africa, Asia and the Americas. 
23.2.3.1 Current Status 
Currently the Imager on the US geostatationary operational environmental satellites 
(GOES-East and GOES-West) allows for diurnal fire detection and monitoring 
throughout the Western Hemisphere. The European Meteosat-9 spinning enhanced 
visible and infrared imager (SEVIRI) provides diurnal fire monitoring capabilities 
in Western Europe and Africa. FY-2C and MTSAT-1R were launched in 2004 and 
2005, respectively, allowing for nearly global geostationary fire monitoring 
capabilities. Over the past 2 years, FY-2C/2D and MTSAT-1R have been used to 
some extent for fire detection and monitoring in Asia and Australia. 
The number of countries and research and operational groups involved in 
geostationary fire monitoring has significantly grown in the last two years, with 
applications in a variety of areas including hazards, air quality monitoring, climate 
change, and industrial applications. Applications of GOES-E/-W, Met-8/-9, 
FY-2C/2D, and MTSAT-1 are demonstrating the capabilities of these operational 
satellites for fire detection, monitoring, and characterization. Furthermore, several 
operational agencies (e.g., NOAA/NESDIS, EUMETSAT, UK Met Office, China 
Meteorological Administration, and India) plan to develop or expand existing 
geostationary fire detection and monitoring programs.  
23.2.3.2 Future Plans 
The current configuration of geostationary platforms around the globe leaves   
a gap in coverage over Eastern Europe and Western Asia to monitor burning   
in India and the boreal forests of Russia. Within the next 2 years additional 
geostationary instruments with fire monitoring capabilities will be launched by 
India (INSAT-3D, 2008), Russia (GOMS Elektro L MSU-GS, 2008) and Korea 
(COMS, 2009) providing coverage of this region as well. Together with the 
current suite of meteorological geostationary sensors, these upcoming sensors 
will enable nearly global geostationary fire monitoring. They will be able to 
detect, monitor, and characterize sub-pixel fires as they occur with high temporal 
resolution. NOAA/NESDIS and the UK Met Office plan to implement a real- 
time global geostationary fire monitoring system in 2008 and 2009, respectively. 
Furthermore fire detection and monitoring is a requirement for the next generation 
GOES-R Advanced Baseline Imager (ABI) and the Meteosat Third Generation 
geostationary platforms. 
For algorithm development, operational implementation, and validation there 
is a need for more involvement from all countries, but especially Africa, Eastern 
Europe, Asia and Australia, with the recent/near-term launches of FY-2C/2D, 

23 The GOFC-GOLD Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme: Assessment and Strategic Plans 
351
MTSAT-1R, INSAT-3D, GOMS Elektro L MSU-GS, and COMS. Research and 
development is needed in the area of fused polar and geostationary fire products 
with the goal of improved merged products. This includes fire identification and 
sub-pixel characterization. Validation activities to date have been on an ad-hoc 
basis and would benefit greatly from more interaction with the CEOS LPV 
Working Group to establish systematic validation plans that include efforts to 
understand cross platform differences. In order to implement a global geostationary 
fire monitoring network with consistent global fire products, it is necessary to 
characterize the unique fire monitoring capabilities of each sensing system. 
23.2.4 To Establish Operational Polar Orbiters with Fire Monitoring 
Capability to Provide Operational Moderate Resolution 
Long-Term Global Fire Products and Enhanced Regional 
Products from Distributed Ground Stations to Meet User 
Requirements 
23.2.4.1 Current Status 
Moderate resolution polar orbiters currently provide data used in detection of 
vegetation condition, active fires and burn scars. The system having the clearest 
operational status is the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration 
(NOAA) polar orbiting environmental satellites (POES) advanced very high 
resolution radiometer (AVHRR). Many of the existing national or regional 
operational systems for detecting active fires rely on AVHRR data downloaded 
from direct readout stations (GFMC 2008; GOFC FIRE 2008). The National 
Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) Moderate-resolution imaging 
spectrometer (MODIS) a research instrument, has demonstrated the value that 
improved spatial resolution, radiometric calibration, geolocation accuracy, and an 
extended suite of spectral bands can bring to fire RS (Justice et al., 2002). MODIS 
sensors are currently flying on NASA’s Terra and Aqua satellites and fire data 
from these systems is increasingly used by operational agencies. Data from the 
European space agency (ESA) (Advanced) Along Track Scanning Radiometer 
((A)ATSR) have been processed to produce global compilations of night-time 
active fire and burn scars (Arino et al., 2001). Data from the European Commission 
SPOT-VEGETATION, sensor have been used to produce annual compilations of 
global burn scar. The U.S. air force defense meteorological satellite program 
(DMSP) operational linescan system (OLS) can detect fires at night via low light 
imaging in the visible wavelength region (Elvidge et al., 2001), a capability used 
in conjunction with data from other systems, such as AVHRR and MODIS.  
23.2.4.2 Future Plans 
In the next three years there will be good continuity of primary moderate resolution 
www.ebook3000.com

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
352 
systems for global fire monitoring, barring system failures (i.e. AVHRR, MODIS, 
DMSP and AATSR). The NASA/NOAA/DoD visible infrared imaging radiometer 
suite (VIIRS) instrument, to be flown on the NPOESS preparatory mission (NPP) 
in 2009 is designed to provide continuity for the MODIS mission and prototype 
the operational moderate resolution sensor and product data streams from VIIRS 
during the national polar-orbiting operational environmental satellite system 
(NPOESS, Townshend et al., 2002) Importantly, the NPP spacecraft will provide 
direct broadcast of data, continuing the tradition of the NOAA-POES and NASA 
Terra/Aqua.  
The VIIRS is under construction and will provide fire data similar to that of 
MODIS. An advantage over MODIS will be the inclusion of a suite of imaging 
bands, centered at 0.64, 0.86, 1.61, 3.74 and 11.4 microns at 400 meter resolution 
at nadir. This should enable improvements in both active fire and burn scar 
mapping. (Note that the VIIRS thermal anomaly product will be based on the 
moderate resolution bands, not the imaging band set). The major problem with 
the VIIRS bands in the 10.8 um region is that the saturation temperature is set to 
maximize the discrimination of cloud top temperatures and saturation is expected 
on large fires. Upon saturation, it will not be possible to estimate fire characteristics, 
such as size and temperature using the standard 3.7 versus 10.8 m band algorithm. 
In addition, on-board aggregation will average values for saturated and unsaturated 
pixels. It may be possible to make use of other VIIRS bands, such as those placed 
at 1.61 and 2.25 to characterize fire size and temperature when saturation occurs 
in the 10.8 m bands, but this is currently not planned for the operational thermal 
anomaly product.  
In the next ten years it is anticipated that the NPOESS VIIRS will become the 
primary operational moderate resolution polar orbiting system used in active fire 
and burn scar RS. This will be augmented by a continuation of the AVHRR data 
record on the morning MetOp the first of which was launched in October 2006. It is 
important that the active fire RS user community effectively establish requirements 
for unsaturated 3.7 m data, for all but the very largest and hottest fires.  
23.2.5 To Develop Long-Term Fire Data Records by Combining  
Data from Multiple Satellite Sources 
Beginning in the 1980’s, various instruments on geostationary and polar 
platforms have been providing systematic measurements useful for fire mapping 
and monitoring. The independent development of these systems has led to the 
generation of a number of single-sensor products. However, the sensors on board 
operational and experimental satellite platforms have provided data limited to the 
associated sensor’s spatial and temporal coverage and only for the duration of the 
specific mission or project. The accuracy of the different products also varies due 
to sensor characteristics, such as spatial resolution, geolocation accuracy and 

23 The GOFC-GOLD Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme: Assessment and Strategic Plans 
353
radiometric characteristics, and algorithm. To generate a long-term, science quality, 
homogeneous fire data record, a number of issues related to inter-satellite and 
inter-sensor continuity need to be addressed. In this process the advancement of 
technology and the consequent improvement of data quality and the availability 
of an increasing number of sensors need to be considered. Specifics of such 
dynamic continuity for fire products need to be defined. A fundamental component 
of this process is product validation, which also allows the linkage of products 
from different sensors.  
23.2.5.1 Active Fire Data Record 
The longest data record—25 years-applicable for active fire monitoring is 
available from AVHRR. In many areas, however, for most of the data record full 
1km resolution data are not available. The 4 km Global Area Coverage (GAC) 
data generated by sampling and averaging the 1km data, are of limited use for 
fire detection and burned area mapping. In addition, inter-satellite changes, the 
orbital drift of the NOAA satellites and sensor degradation make the creation of a 
homogeneous AVHRR-based active fire data record difficult (Csiszar et al., 
2003). Nighttime data within the ATSR/AATSR World Fire Atlas (Arino et al., 
2001) now provide nearly a decade of systematic record. Science quality daytime 
and nighttime active fire data have been generated from MODIS since late 2000 
(Justice et al., 2002). To establish continuity between these products, differences in 
detection capabilities and temporal sampling of the diurnal cycle of fire activity 
need to be analyzed. Multi-year data records from GOES (hemispherically) and 
TRMM (within the tropics) provide an opportunity for such intercomparisons 
and the normalization of fire counts. Advances have also been made in the use  
of coincident fire observations from high resolution sensors—primarily 
Terra/ASTER—for product validation (Morisette et al., 2005a; 2005b, Csiszar et 
al., 2006). The creation of true multi-sensor fire products via data fusion—defined 
as the generation of a single, enhanced product using information from various 
sensors—is currently still in the exploratory phase. 
23.2.5.2 Burned Area Data Record 
The production of long-term, large-scale burned area datasets has begun only 
recently. After pilot projects such as GBA-2000 (Tansey et al., 2004) and 
GLOBSCAR (Simon et al., 2004) multi-year global datasets from several sensors 
are being generated within the ESA GLOBCARBON project (GLOBCARBON, 
2008). Recently most of the Pathfinder AVHRR Land dataset has been processed 
into a multi-year burned area product, however a systematic validation of the 
product has yet to be developed (Carmona-Moreno et al., 2005). Production of the 
standard MODIS burned area product (Roy et al., 2005a) began in early 2007 and 
reprocessing of the entire MODIS data record will be completed by mid-2008. 
Validation of the beta-product has been undertaken in close collaboration with 
the GOFC-GOLD regional fire networks in Africa, Australia and Russia (Roy et 
www.ebook3000.com

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
354 
al., 2005b). Regional burned area mapping initiatives, such as TerraNorte for the 
boreal zone of the Northern Hemisphere (TERRANORTE, 2008) also exist. 
Major requirements for the creation of the science quality burned area long 
term data record are the provision of 1km AVHRR observations and the inclusion 
of burned area among the systematically generated and validated data products by 
the various space and operational agencies. GOFC-GOLD Fire can be instrumental 
in advocating and coordinating the adoption of standard validation protocols and 
sustained product validation activities.  
23.2.5.3 Analysis of Global Fire Dynamics 
The emerging products have been used for provisional studies on the spatial and 
temporal dynamics of fire activity at global (e.g. Dwyer et al., 2000; Csiszar et 
al., 2005a; Giglio et al., 2006) and regional (e.g. Schroeder et al., 2005) scales. 
These analyses have revealed some important patterns of fire activity, particularly 
in remote areas, that will result in a better understanding of fire regimes and the 
role of human activity in fire dynamics. The data record will enable the analysis 
of long-term interactions between fire, land use, land cover and other components 
of the climate system (Csiszar et al., 2005b).  
23.2.6 To Establish Operational Polar Orbiters with Fire Monitoring 
Capability to Provide Operational High Resolution Data 
Acquisition Allowing Fire Monitoring and Post-fire 
Assessments 
23.2.6.1 Advanced Active Fire Detection and Characterization 
The German Bi-spectral InfraRed Detection (BIRD) satellite was successfully 
exploited as an innovative technology development in an end-to-end demonstration 
for semi-operational fire detection during the FUEGOSAT Consolidation Phase 
Step 1 within the FIREBIRD / DEMOBIRD projects in 2003 (Briess et al., 2003; 
Lorenz et al., 2003). The FUEGOSAT Consolidation Phase is part of the ESA 
Earth Watch initiative and running since 2002 with funding contributions and 
participation of the ESA Member States: Spain, Italy, France, and Germany. 
Work conducted by DLR and partners (Kings College London (KCL), GFMC, 
Remote Sensing Solution GmbH (RSS), Ingeneria y Servicios Aerospatiales (INSA) 
and OHB-Systems) for ESA in the ECOFIRE Study on “Scientific Assessment of 
Space-borne High Temperature Event Observing Mission Concepts” revealed 
that active fire data nearly simultaneously obtained by MODIS on Terra and by 
BIRD complement very well (Wooster et al., 2003; Zhukov et al., 2003). There is 
a high complementary potential of these two types of Low Earth Orbiting (LEO) 
IR sensors for innovative and quantitative active fire detection. Wide-swath 
moderate-resolution spectro-radiometers (MODIS type) on major polar orbiting 

23 The GOFC-GOLD Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme: Assessment and Strategic Plans 
355
satellites can provide daily global coverage fire detection, whereas moderate-to-high 
spatial resolution imagers (BIRD type) flown on micro-satellite constellations 
and / or on medium-scale satellites allow detailed monitoring and validation of 
the parameters of fires whose occurrence was detected before by the wide-swath 
and geostationary sensors. 
A conclusion from the above European initiatives is that a dedicated fire-detecting 
and monitoring instrument with ~200 m spatial resolution would complement the 
fire detection capability of VIIRS. The accommodation of such an instrument on 
the GMES satellites (Global Monitoring for Environment and Security; GMES, 
2008) Sentinel 2 (Land) and Sentinel 3 (Ocean) is still pending. A market study for 
FIRES—a prospective micro-satellite constellation with BIRD-type IR sensors, 
real time on-board fire product generation and broadcast—was conducted in 2005. 
23.2.6.2 Role of Burned Area Maps from High Resolution RS Data to Support 
Global Wildland Fire Management 
High resolution (20  30 m) RS data support a variety of global wildland fire 
management programs. Local fire managers require fine scale information for 
applications such as pre-fire vegetation/fuels mapping, fire risk modeling, burn 
area mapping, and post-fire assessment and monitoring. 
Landsat has historically been the primary source of such high resolution imagery 
since it provides spectral bands in the visible, near infrared, short wave infrared, 
and thermal infrared regions and a valuable global archive of imagery from 1972 
to the present (Sheffner, 1994). Continuity of the Landsat record is critical to 
accurately monitor regional and local scale temporal changes in vegetation and 
land cover and land use both for resource monitoring and global change research. 
The immediate future of the Landsat program is currently at risk due to the 
current operating conditions of Landsat 5 and Landsat 7, and the delay in the launch 
of the Landsat Data Continuity Mission (LDCM) in 2011.  
Landsat 5, launched in 1984, and Landsat 7 are currently operating past their 
original design lives. Several critical mission components on Landsat 5 are presently 
operating without redundancy (Irons 2005) and instrument problems continue  
to arise. The fuel remaining onboard Landsat 5 is not sufficient to maintain its 
orbit through to the beginning of the NPOESS era and data can only be directly 
downlinked in real-time to a limited number of ground stations (Irons and Ochs, 
2004). Landsat 7’s ETM+ sensor experienced a failure of the scan line corrector 
(SLC) in May 2003. The result of this failure causes portions of the area within 
the scene to be collected redundantly while other areas are missed entirely (Howard 
and Lacasse 2004). The lost data which are scattered throughout the image except 
for a narrow central swath, amounts to ~22% of each scene (Irons and Ochs, 
2004). In addition to the SLC failure, Landsat 7 lost one of its three gyroscopes 
in May 2004.  
Since the SLC failure, various alternatives have been discussed for Landsat 
continuity beyond the LDCM, including a free flyer, collocation on the NPOESS

platform, a commercial data buy and a micro-satellite imaging constellation. The 
latter approach which has been proven by the Disaster Monitoring Constellation 
(DMC) developed by Surrey Satellite Ltd., has considerable appeal as it would 
enable multiple low cost satellites to be built and launched, increasing temporal 
coverage and ensuring timely instrument replacement upon failure. With a number 
of high resolution instruments currently orbit e.g. IRS AWiFS, SPOT, ASTER, 
EO1, and CBERS, GOFC-GOLD in cooperation with the CEOS Working Group 
on Information Systems and Services in the framework of the Global Earth 
Observing System of Systems (GEOSS) is pursuing the coordination of the 
acquisition from multiple international spaceborne assets to fill this critical gap 
in global data continuity.  
23.2.7 To Enhance Fire Product Use and Access by Developing 
Operational Multi-source Fire and GIS Data and Making 
These Available Over the Internet 
Recent advances in information technology make it easier integrate RS products 
and GIS data within web-based GIS systems to provide resource managers with 
information that is timely, accurate, and delivered in a readily accessible format. 
Using these technologies NASA Goddard Space Flight Center (GSFC) and the 
University of Maryland (UMd) are working with GOFC-GOLD partners to 
improve the way in which active fire locations are disseminated to end users 
around the world.  
23.2.7.1 Delivering MODIS Global Active Fire Data over the Internet 
The standard MODIS active fire product can be obtained a few days after 
satellite data acquisition from the Earth Observation Systems Data Center (EDC) 
Distributed Active Archive Center (LP DAAC, 2007). However, accessing data 
from the DAAC requires users to download large files (typically 50 MB), use 
specialized software, and to possess some expertise to order the data and handle 
the HDF file format. To better meet the needs of resource managers, two systems 
were developed as part of NASA’s Applications Program, under the umbrella of 
GOFC-GOLD Fire; the MODIS Land Rapid Response (MLRR) system (MLRR, 
2008) and Web Fire Mapper (WFM, 2008).  
The MLRR system processes MODIS data in near real-time and serves true 
color images with active fire locations overlain over the Internet. The active fire 
locations generated by MLRR are also ingested into Web Fire Mapper and made 
available to natural resource managers in readily accessible formats; these include 
interactive Web maps, downloadable GIS layers, and more recently (for selected 
areas) fire email alerts and cell phone text messages. The development of Web 
Fire Mapper has been based on an understanding of user needs and providing 

23 The GOFC-GOLD Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme: Assessment and Strategic Plans 
357
appropriate delivery systems. Using the Web GIS tools, users can customize a 
map by selecting from a range of geospatial layers and overlaying them with most 
recently acquired active fire data. Users can also analyze and query the global 
database of active fire detections from November 2000 to present. This capacity to 
integrate fire information with local geospatial information (such as park boundaries, 
roads and settlements) allows natural resource managers to place active fires in 
their geographic context.  
23.2.7.2 Regional Web Fire Mapping Initiatives 
There are a number of regional initiatives that also serve MODIS active fire data 
from a direct broadcast station. The primary advantage of these initiatives is the 
reduced time from satellite overpass to data distribution (~40 minutes). Examples 
of these systems are those operated by: the USDA Remote Sensing Applications 
Center (USDA, 2005), Sentinel in Australia (SENTINEL, 2007), INPE in Brazil 
(INPE, 2008), Conabio in Mexico (CONABIO, 2007), Avialesookhrana in Russia 
(AVIALESOOKHRANA, 2005) and the Satellite Applications Center in South 
Africa (SACSA, 2008); for a complete list of systems see the monitoring portal 
of the Global Fire Monitoring Center (GFMC, 2008) and the GOFC-GOLD Fire 
Implementation Team website (GOFC FIRE, 2008) The regional systems are 
better placed than centralized, global systems, to combine the active fire locations 
with regional information such as weather conditions, local GIS datasets and 
active fire locations from other satellite sensors. For example, INPE integrates 
fire detections from NOAA-AVHRR and GOES as well as MODIS; the South 
African system integrates active fire detections from Meteosat-8 G data; and 
Sentinel adds localized information such as water courses, terrain relief, built up 
areas and topographic maps. 
23.2.7.3 Future 
A considerable investment has been made by the space agencies around the 
World to develop improved satellite monitoring of the planet. To maximize the 
societal benefit of these systems to support natural resource management and 
decision-making, there needs to be a continued emphasis on ensuring that the 
data are converted to useable information and made available in a timely fashion. 
This process is becoming easier with advances in web technology and improved 
access to broadband Internet. 
Technologies already exist to create interactive web maps that incorporate data 
from a wide range of servers (in different locations); a key obstacle to improving 
these maps for active fire managers, is finding suitable data that are up-to-date, 
accurate, readily available and consistent across regions. For examples, Web Fire 
Mapper is being updated to serve the MODIS burned area product.  
It is expected that future efforts to enhance the delivery of multi-source fire 
and GIS data will include: XML (extensible markup language) based data feeds 
(that allow the end user to customize the information they are interested in and

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires

have it delivered to them through a web browser), enhanced interoperability 
(allowing more integration of datasets), improved web technologies (such as 
Asynchronous JavaScript + XML), emerging open source GIS solutions, and a 
wider range of Fire Alerts /summary reports in the form of email alerts and cell 
phone messages, with text only or text and map attachments. Providing these data 
in a range of formats that are easy to access—even with slow internet connectivity, 
will continue to improve access to satellite derived information and enhance 
product use globally. 
23.2.8 To Establish an Operational Network of Fire Validation 
Sites and Protocols, Providing Accuracy Assessment for 
Operational Products and a Testbed for New or Enhanced 
Products, Leading to Standard Products of Known Accuracy 
The potential research, policy and management applications of satellite fire 
products place a high priority on providing statements about their accuracy. 
Inter-comparison of different fire area products provides an indication of gross 
differences and possibly insights into their causes, however product comparison 
with independent reference data is needed to determine accuracy (Justice et al., 
2000). Validation is defined here, and more generally, as the process of assessing 
satellite product accuracy by comparison with independent reference data 
(Morisette et al., 2002; Roy et al., 2002a). Validation is required (i) to provide 
accuracy information to help users decide if and how to use a product, and (ii) to 
identify needed product improvements.  
Previous studies have revealed large discrepancies in the areal estimates, 
timing and location among satellite fire products and highlight the need for 
systematic validation (Korontzi et al., 2004; Boschetti et al., 2004). Despite the 
large number of experimental and systematically derived satellite fire products, 
there has been neither rigorous assessment of their accuracy, nor development of 
systematic methodologies to evaluate their accuracy, arguably because of the 
limited resources made available for validation and because of the scope and 
complexity of the task.  
Validation of satellite active fire products is difficult because of practical 
problems in collecting independent reference data that characterize the location 
and physical properties of actively burning fires. Previous approaches have used 
data from aircraft observations of prescribed fires and wildfires (Kaufman et al., 
1998), but are expensive to undertake in a regionally or globally representative 
manner and are difficult to coordinate with satellite observations. Similarly, field 
based measurements are difficult to coordinate and cannot be used to infer active 
fire product accuracy over large areas (Cardoso et al., 2005). Burned areas identified 
in high spatial resolution satellite data do not provide a reliable validation if the 
fires are inactive or cloud-covered at the time of satellite overpass (Pereira and 

23 The GOFC-GOLD Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme: Assessment and Strategic Plans 
359
Setzer, 1996). More recently, high spatial resolution ASTER data collected 
simultaneously with low resolution MODIS data on the NASA EOS Terra platform 
have been used to validate the MODIS active fire product (Morisette et al., 2005a; 
Morisette et al., 2005b; Csiszar et al., 2006). 
The validation of burned area products is less sensitive to the need for 
simultaneous collection of independent reference data with satellite overpasses, 
as the surface effects of fire persist for a time varying between weeks (grassland 
ecosystems) to years (typically, forest ecosystems). Consequently, independent 
reference data derived from high spatial resolution satellite data, such as Landsat, 
have been used extensively to validate lower spatial resolution burned area 
products (e.g., Barbosa et al., 1999; Fraser et al., 2000; Roy et al., 2005b; Boschetti 
et al., 2006). 
There are several outstanding issues in the development of robust regional to 
global scale fire product validation methodologies. These include the need to 
increase the quality and reduce the cost of validation by developing and promoting 
an international network of validation sites and by establishing validation 
standards and protocols (Morisette et al., 2002). Common validation sites would 
facilitate data sharing and can be expected, with the development of validation 
protocols, to foster standardization of the validation data and of the product 
accuracy reporting. Validation protocols are needed not as strict requirements but 
as suggested baseline approaches (Rasmussen et al., 2001). These issues are more 
pressing than ever with the prospects of operational fire products, for example 
from NPOESS data, and with a proliferation of global and regionally generated 
products. 
A strategic GOFC-GOLD fire goal is to advocate and where possible facilitate 
the development of international validation standards and protocols for the 
validation of satellite active fire and burned area products, including: independent 
reference data definition and measurement; validation site selection and 
exchange of independent reference data collected at validation sites; statistical 
comparison of independent reference data and products; and product accuracy 
reporting. Despite the broadening recognition for these needs, and an emerging 
adoption of validation concepts by the fire product producer community, they 
have not yet been achieved. 
23.2.9 To Operationally Generate Fire Emission Product Suites of 
Known Accuracy Providing Annual and Near Real-Time 
Emission Estimates with Available Input Data Sets 
23.2.9.1 Current Status 
The common approach used in land-based emission quantifications relies on a 
combination of satellite burned area information, modeled fuel load amounts, 
www.ebook3000.com

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires 
360 
estimates of combustion completeness and ground and/or airborne measured 
emission factors (Hoelzemann et al., 2004; Ito and Penner, 2004; van der Werf et 
al., 2004). The improvements in spatially and temporally explicit regional to 
global emissions modeling have been rather incremental and have been hampered 
by the lack of the reliable underlying datasets. The recent availability of two 
global satellite-based burned area products, GBA-2000 (Tansey et al., 2004) and 
GLOBSCAR (Simon et al., 2004) for the year 2000 has provided an opportunity 
for generating new global emissions estimates. A global MODIS burned area 
algorithm has also been implemented and validated over several regions in the 
world (Roy et al., 2002b; 2005a; 2005b). However, several studies have highlighted 
the pressing need for rigorous validation of these satellite burned area products 
(see Sect. 23.2.8). Further improvements in the burned area products require 
biome/regional specific representative information.  
Considering the advances in burned area mapping, likely the largest persistent 
challenge in global emissions modeling is the spatiotemporal quantification of 
different fuel types available for burning. Interannual variations in fuel loads at 
regional scales are also largely unknown and require a dynamic modeling approach. 
Biogeochemical models have been applied to assess fuel loads that are higher 
when compared with a handful of field measurements in Southern Africa (van 
der Werf et al., 2003). Satellite measures of global net primary productivity (e.g., 
MODIS, GLOPEM model) adjusted by region specific available fuel maps (e.g., 
fuel map of Malaysia and Western Indonesia by Dymond et al., 2004) and validated 
through regionally representative field measurements can provide the means to 
estimate fuel loads more accurately. 
Current global emission models do not adequately account for burning of 
organic matter present in peatlands and boreal regions which release significant 
amounts of carbon into the atmosphere (Page et al., 2002; Soja et al., 2004). The 
capability to map these low energy peat fires and estimate the fire release energy 
has been developed locally using the high resolution experimental BIRD Infrared 
sensor (Wooster et al., 2003; Siegert et al., 2004). Similar mapping methodologies 
for large scale peatland fire events using suitable operational sensors remain to 
be developed.  
Large woody fuels can be an important fuel load component especially in 
tropical regions, with significant implications for smoldering emissions (Bertschi 
et al., 2003). Tree mortality has been incorporated to some extent in current 
global emissions models but is still highly uncertain. Other forms of potential 
fuel load alteration whether natural (e.g., herbivory, insects, fuel decay) or 
anthropogenic (e.g., fuel load removal by humans, forest clearance, agriculture, 
rangeland management) also warrant improvements in their implementation   
in fuel load models. Information of fire frequency/return is also pertinent to 
quantifying fuel accumulation since the last fire event in a particular location. 
The establishment of consistent time-series of long-term satellite fire records 
from different sensors is required to investigate fire regimes (see Sect. 23.2.5). 

23 The GOFC-GOLD Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme: Assessment and Strategic Plans 
361
The fire and atmospheric science community has made considerable advances 
in the knowledge of emission factors for various important atmospheric species 
from vegetation fires in major biomes (Andreae and Merlet, 2001). Some important 
gaps exist though. The seasonal variations in emission factors and combustion 
completeness can be significant and have not been thoroughly addressed in 
global emissions models partially also due to the very limited number of existing 
early dry season measurements (Hoffa et al., 1999; Korontzi et al., 2003). The 
importance of accounting for the seasonal variations in emission factors and 
combustion completeness has been shown for southern African savanna fires 
(Korontzi, 2005). A compelling need for the prediction of these seasonal variations 
is the reliable assessment of the fuel moisture content which can be estimated 
from satellite observations (Zarco-Tejada et al., 2003; Chuvieco et al., 2004). There 
is still a lack of adequate field measurements for important compounds, such as 
acetonitrile and hydrogen cyanide. The improved characterization of nitrogen, 
sulfur and halogen containing fire emitted compounds requires the development 
of seasonal fuel chemistry databases.  
23.2.9.2 Future Plans 
In the future, national or regional fire analysis and data information service centers 
may provide the institutional environment for the operational production of these 
emissions model outputs. The methodologies, roles and responsibilities for 
transferring the experimental emissions estimates to the operational domain are 
still undeveloped. A critical step in the transition of the emission model outputs 
to their operational production on a continuous basis will be to determine their 
accuracy. Rigorous sensitivity analyses at the regional scale can provide explicit 
information as to which parameters add the most uncertainty (French et al., 2004) 
and priorities for improvements. The synergistic use of different products made 
available for the same region has to rely on standard guidelines and protocols  
for product accuracy assessment intended for optimal use in emissions models. 
Atmospheric modelers have started to utilize the land based emissions estimates 
in inverse modeling studies (van der Werf et al., 2004; Arellano et al., 2004). 
Approaches that integrate land-based emissions models with atmospheric chemistry/ 
transport models will be the key to improve emissions on a global scale and will be 
most useful to the community. This is especially true considering the still unresolved 
discrepancy between these two approaches for emissions estimation. 
Other currently experimental satellite based measurements of the fire radiative 
energy may offer an important new way of directly estimating the amount of fuel 
consumed which needs to be further explored (Kaufman et al., 1998; 2003; 
Wooster, 2002; Wooster et al., 2003; Siegert et al., 2004; Ichoku and Kaufman, 
2005).These techniques have been successfully tested at local to regional scales 
and are currently being developed at a global scale. Satellite based techniques for 
direct estimation of trace gases (e.g., CO, CH4) (McMillan et al., 2005) and 
aerosol loading (e.g., Kaufman et al., 1998; 2003) are also being developed.

23.3 Example Contributory Activities from US Agencies 
23.3.1 NASA Wildfire Activities 
NASA’s research, analysis, and applied science activities associated with wildfire 
fall within both the Research and Analysis and Applied Sciences programs. The 
NASA Earth Science Division is divided into focus areas with wildfire as an 
important terrestrial process that cuts across a number of these e.g. carbon cycle, 
ecosystems and land use change, atmospheric composition, water cycle and land 
cover . The NASA Land Cover and Land Use change program has been a strong 
supporter of the GOFC-GOLD Fire program, providing outreach for NASA 
research and data products and assisting the GOFC regional fire networks to 
access and utilize NASA data. In the NASA science program, satellite fire data 
are being used for example, to assess recent trends in global fire activity, to 
model annual trace gas and particulate emissions, to examine the relationship 
between fire and climate change, to model land use change and project the future 
changes in fire regimes (Korontzi et al., 2004; van der Werf et al., 2004). From 
the atmospheric science perspective NASA is studying the role of particulates 
generated by fires in cloud formation and global radiative forcing. These science 
studies are couched within the framework of the US Climate Change Science 
Program (CCSP) and the US Global Earth Observations (USGEO). In support of 
these science studies, NASA provides funding for algorithm development, product 
generation, validation and benchmarking of research results e.g. (Justice et al., 
2002). Current emphasis within the science program is to develop long-term data 
records to enable the study of global change. New techniques are also being 
developed using airborne Lidar to estimate vegetation structure and fuel load in 
anticipation of a future spaceborne vegetation Lidar missions. 
The NASA Applied Science program has two main themes, transitioning 
NASA research into the operational domain, and using NASA research results to 
enhance decision support systems and tools for fire management. To help achieve 
the goal of integrating data and models into decision support systems, NASA is 
partnering with the USDA Forest Service Remote Sensing and Applications 
Center (RSAC). With the Forest Service, emphasis has been given to support the 
provision of NASA data to the National Interagency Fire Center (NIFC), for 
example through the MODIS Rapid Response System (see Sect. 3.3). Satellite 
data along with airborne sensors and platforms are being used for assessing fire 
danger, monitoring fires in near real time and assessing post-fire impacts. New 
technologies for improving fire observations have been developed under the recent 
Sensor Web project. The goal of this project is to link the NASA spaceborne 
systems in an automated way, so that coarse resolution fire detection systems can 
direct the acquisition of data from the next high resolution sensor overpass. The 

23 The GOFC-GOLD Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme: Assessment and Strategic Plans 
363
prototype for this system was developed using MODIS and Earth Observer 
(EO-1) sensor. NASA has also been experimenting with the use of Unmanned 
Aerial Systems (UAS) in support of fire management under the Wildfire Research 
and Applications Partnership (WRAP) funded by NASA’s Research Education 
and Applications Solutions Network (REASoN Cooperative Agreement). Seamless 
data from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) are also integrated to 
improve geo-correction of sub-orbital data sets. Support was given to the U. S. 
Forest Service this past fire season and created a Western States Fire Mission that 
coincidently provided support to the Esperanza and Southern California Fire 
events in 2003 and 2007, respectively. 
23.3.2 NOAA Wildfire Activities 
The Hazard Mapping System (HMS; NOAA, 2008), developed and run operationally 
by NOAA’s Satellite Services Division (SSD), is a multiplatform RS approach to 
detecting fires and smoke over the US and adjacent areas of Canada and Mexico. 
The system utilizes sensors on seven different NOAA and NASA satellites. 
Automated fire detections are incorporated into the system from GOES through 
the Wildfire Automated Biomass Burning Algorithm (WF-ABBA) (Prins and 
Menzel, 1996), AVHRR (Li et al., 2001) and MODIS (Giglio et al., 2003). 
Automated detection algorithms are employed for each of the satellites for the 
fire detects while smoke is delineated by an image analyst. Analyses are quality 
controlled by an analyst who inspects all available imagery and automated fire 
detects, deleting suspected false detects and adding fires that the automated 
routines miss. Graphical, text, and GIS compatible analyses are posted to a web 
site as soon as updates are performed, and a final product for a given day is posted 
early the following morning. All products are archived at NOAA’s National 
Geophysical Data Center. Daily fire and smoke analyses are available on-line 
(NOAA, 2008). 
Areal extent of detectable smoke is outlined using animated visible imagery, 
for input to a dispersion and transport model, the HYbrid Single-Particle 
Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT), developed by NOAA’s Air 
Resources Laboratory (ARL). Resulting smoke forecasts will be used as input to 
NOAA’s Air Quality forecasts. The GOES Aerosol and Smoke Product (GASP) 
is an experimental GOES imagery based aerosol optical depth product developed 
by the NESDIS Office of Research and Applications, being implemented for 
operational use by the NESDIS Satellite Analysis Branch for use in smoke and 
volcanic ash monitoring. GASP products are available on-line (GASP, 2004). 
NOAA’s Operational Significant Event Imagery (OSEI, 2008) program processes 
satellite imagery of environmentally significant events, including fire, smoke and 
volcanic ash, visible in operational satellite data. This imagery is often referred to 
by fire managers and air quality agencies. 
www.ebook3000.com

Remote Sensing and Modeling Applications to Wildland Fires

NOAA’s future plans include the integration of high resolution global data 
from the European Space Agency’s MetOp satellite, integration of more ancillary 
data layers, and better characterization of fire emissions for input to air quality 
models. Ongoing research in NESDIS’ Center for Satellite Applications and 
Research (STAR) will provide means to estimate smoke concentrations and trace 
gas characterization by incorporating data from RS sources as they become 
available, such as the Ozone Monitoring Instrument (OMI) and VIIRS. 
23.3.3 USDA Forest Service Wildfire Activities 
The USDA Forest Service is currently using a combination of satellite and airborne 
RS systems to map and monitor active wildland fires, and to map burn severity for 
post-fire rehabilitation. RS systems are used to provide national scale—strategic 
planning level, and local scale—tactical incident level fire maps and products.  
National scale, strategic planning fire maps are developed using the NASA 
MODIS sensor, direct broadcast capability, and Rapid Response System. The system 
utilizes Western United States MODIS data acquired in real time by the RSAC 
MODIS Direct Broadcast receiving station in Salt Lake City, Utah and near real 
time MODIS data for the Eastern United States and Alaska from the NASA GSFC. 
Both day and night time data are collected. These data are used to prepare active 
fire maps and geospatial data continuously for the entire United States and 
Canada. These maps and data are made available to fire managers and the public 
through the internet and have proved to be useful for monitoring actively burning 
fires, assisting in planning, allocating fire suppression resources, and informing 
the public on current fire activity across the nation (USDA, 2005).  
National scale active fire maps are intended to provide accurate and current 
information to assist wildfire managers in strategic planning. The information is 
used to make decisions on where and when to allocate critical fire suppression 
resources, such as high resolution airborne thermal infrared fire mapping systems 
at NIFC. The national scale active fire maps allow managers to prioritize fire 
mapping needs and prepare flight plans for airborne thermal infrared systems. 
For local planning, fire managers require higher spatial resolution fire map 
products to support decisions such as where to place fire crews or airborne 
retardant drops. Tactical scale, finer resolution fire maps, and geospatial data are 
provided to Incident Command fire suppression teams to assist in tactical level 
planning. A combination of airborne Forward Looking Infrared (FLIR), thermal 
imagers, and high resolution thermal infrared line scanner systems are used to 
acquire detailed imagery and data for quick response fire mapping products. These 
products are used to brief Incident Command staff and support local decisions on 
where fire suppression assets should be used.  
Satellite and airborne RS systems are used to quickly map burn severity and 
prioritize areas for re-vegetation and erosion control treatments. To mitigate the 

23 The GOFC-GOLD Fire Mapping and Monitoring Theme: Assessment and Strategic Plans 
365
effects of wildland fire on soil and duff layers, the Forest Service and other federal 
land management agencies prepare Burned Area Emergency Response (BAER) 
plans to stabilize soils and return vegetation cover to the burned areas as soon as 
possible. One of the first steps in the BAER process is the creation of a map that 
highlights the areas most in need of immediate erosion control and other protection 
measures. Traditionally this map was created by airborne sketch mapping in 
combination with field surveys. Recently, techniques have been developed using 
airborne and satellite RS imagery to derive base maps to improve the accuracy of 
the initial burn severity product. These base maps have included mosaicked digital 
camera images and satellite imagery such as IKONOS, SPOT, Landsat TM, ASTER, 
and MODIS. 
RSAC provides field level BAER team members, arriving at an incident, 
with remotely sensed imagery, Burn Area Reflectance Classification (BARC) 
maps, and ancillary data. A BARC map is typically created using change detection 
on a band ratio such as the Normalized Burn Ratio (NBR) and the Normalized 
Difference Vegetation Index (NDVI). The BARC output is delivered to the field 
in two forms. One has four classes: High, Moderate, Low, and Unburned. The other 
has 255 discrete values and allows field users to make their own classification 
decisions such as altering the threshold values between burn severity categories. 
The BARC map, when used in conjunction with other geospatial data, provides a 
synoptic view of the burned area and allows for more consistent mapping decisions. 
The BARC data and remotely sensed imagery are commonly used to focus the 
reconnaissance efforts of the BAER team on areas of greatest concern, develop 
the BAER burn severity map, create 3-dimensional models of the burned area and 
visualization products, and prepare graphics for public meetings to show areas 
with increased erosion potential. 
23.4 Conclusion 
The GOFC-GOLD program has undertaken an ambitious agenda to improve the 
availability, accessibility and use of earth observation information. The program 
started from grass-roots concern amongst practitioners that the potential of satellite 
RS was not being realized, despite the overwhelming demand for environmental 
information. Since that time there has been a broadening recognition of the  
need for effective global earth observation. The program activities and structure 
established by GOFC-GOLD provide an important contribution to the emerging 
GEOSS which recognizes that in a rapidly changing world, there is the need   
for timely and up-to-date earth observations and information (GEOSS, 2005). 
The emergence of systematically generated and validated global fire products 
also provides the opportunity for a reliable Global Fire Assessment. Such an 
assessment is currently being coordinated by the GOFC-GOLD Implementation 
Team and the regional fire networks. The ultimate goal is to put in place sustained

366 
systems which are operational, providing reliable and consistent fire information 
to meet the needs of decision-makers, resource managers and global change 
scientists. We are a long way from achieving this goal but GOFC-GOLD is making 
considerable progress and has highlighted some of the necessary near-term and 
concrete steps to that end. The challenge in this time of limited budgets is for 
governments to make the necessary commitment to international coordination, 
utilizing the international programs such as GOFC-GOLD to facilitate and proceed 
with implementation.
