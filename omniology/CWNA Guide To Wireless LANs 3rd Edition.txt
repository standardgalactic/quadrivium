Introduction
It is difficult to think of a technology over the last decade with a greater impact on our
lives than wireless data communications. Because it’s no longer necessary to remain connected
by cable to a network, users are free to surf the Web, check e-mail, download electronic books,
or watch videos from virtually anywhere. Free wireless Internet connections are available in
coffee shops and restaurants across the country. Students use wireless data services on their
school’s campus in order to access instructional material as well as remain connected to friends.
Travelers can have wireless access while waiting in airports, traveling on airplanes and trains,
and working in their hotel rooms. At work, employees can access remote data during meetings
and in conference rooms, thus significantly increasing their productivity. Wireless has also
spurred the growth of many other new technologies, such as portable tablet devices. Although
wireless voice communication started the revolution in the 1990s, wireless data communica-
tions are the driving force in the twenty-first century. It has truly become a wireless world.
Statistics confirm how widespread wireless technology has become. Each year, hundreds of
millions of wireless data devices are sold. Virtually all laptop, netbook, and tablet computers
have wireless data capabilities as standard equipment. Since 2007, the number of locations
where wireless data services are available has increased 40 percent annually. According to
some estimates, by 2014 there will be 1.4 billion devices shipped annually that support wire-
less data standards, and these devices will transmit the amount of data traffic equal to almost
one billion DVDs.i By the end of 2011 one quarter of all households around the world, or
439 million households, were using wireless data technology, with South Korea leading the
way with over 80 percent of its households using wireless (the United States was eighth with
61 percent). It is estimated that by 2016 over 800 million households will have wireless data

technology installed.ii Considering that wireless local area networks were not even available
until 2000, this makes their widespread installation that much more amazing.
With wireless local area networks (WLANs) becoming so commonplace it is important that
today’s network managers and system administrators understand their complexities. The
CWNA Guide to Wireless LANs, Third Edition provides the information you need to manage
a wireless network. This book takes a comprehensive view of planning, deploying, securing,
and troubleshooting wireless networks. It examines the technology that makes wireless net-
works work and offers practical tools, tips, and techniques. CWNA Guide to Wireless LANs,
Third Edition helps you understand and use the latest wireless network technologies.
The CWNA Guide to Wireless LANs, Third Edition also prepares you to take the Certified Wire-
less Network Administrator (CWNA) examination. This certification, administered by CWNP,
Inc., is the leading vendor-neutral WLAN certification and is considered one of the fastest-
growing certifications today. Based on the latest exam objectives, the CWNA Guide to Wireless
LANs, Third Edition will equip you with the knowledge and skills necessary for taking this exam.
Intended Audience
This book is designed to meet the needs of students and professionals who want to master
wireless data networks. A basic knowledge of computers and networks is all that is required
to use this book. Those seeking to pass the CWNA certification exam will find the text’s
approach and content especially helpful because all the exam objectives are covered (see
Appendix A). (For more information on CWNA certification, visit CWNP’s Web site at www
.cwnp.com.) Yet the CWNA Guide to Wireless LANs, Third Edition is much more than an
exam “prep book.” This textbook helps you learn wireless data technology in the context
of wireless technologies and data networks. It will help you establish a solid foundation
for becoming a WLAN professional and prepare you for taking the CWNP exam.
The book’s pedagogical features are designed to provide a truly interactive learning experience
to help prepare you for the challenges of WLANs. In addition to the information presented
in the text, each chapter includes Hands-On Projects that guide you through implementing
practical wireless hardware, software, and network configurations step by step. Each chapter
also contains case studies that place you in the role of problem solver, requiring you to apply
concepts presented in the chapter to achieve successful solutions.

A disruptive technology is a radical technology or innovation that fills a new role that an
existing device or technology could not. Examples of disruptive technologies, along with
those that that they replaced in the last 150 years, include: steamships (which replaced sailing
ships), telephones (which replaced telegraphs), automobiles (which replaced horses), word
After a turbulent start, wireless Internet access for airline travelers is now taking off.
In 2003, Boeing, the world’s largest manufacturer of commercial airplanes, created
the wireless technology subsidiary Connexion to roll out passenger in-flight Internet
service for both wired and wireless access. After trials on several airlines, Boeing
announced plans to retrofit over 4,000 airplanes with servers, wireless equipment,
and antennas. Boeing estimated that 30 percent of passengers would purchase this
service, but by 2006 Boeing discontinued the service, explaining that the number of
airlines that signed up with Connexion was insufficient.
After the worldwide economic downturn in 2007, airlines searched for innovative
ways to both increase revenue and attract more passengers, particularly business tra-
velers. U.S. airlines began charging fees on checked baggage, thereby reaping addi-
tional revenue of almost $8 billion annually. They also returned to the idea of adding
wireless Internet access to their airplanes. In the spring of 2009, AirTran Airways
announced plans to equip its Boeing jets with in-flight wireless Internet and to
charge passengers a fee for its use. Other U.S. airlines announced similar wireless
services. A typical passenger jet requires 125 pounds of equipment and special fiber-
optic cable to give the plane wireless capabilities, which can be installed in a single
overnight installation at a cost of about $100,000. As of mid-2010, all major airlines
had either installed wireless on selected flights or announced plans to do so.
When a wireless-equipped plane reaches an altitude of 10,000 feet, a passenger
can turn on his laptop, tablet, or smartphone. On his first attempt to view a Web
page, the plane’s wireless network displays a page asking him to enter credit card
information to pay for the wireless Internet access. The costs for laptops vary,
with typical fees ranging from $12.95 for a three-hour flight to $5.00 for shorter
flights. Filters prevent passengers from viewing pornographic Web sites or making
Internet-based phone calls. Connection speeds are around 3 Mbps (million bits per
second).
Implementation of this next generation of airline wireless Internet access has gone
smoothly, with one exception: on long flights, passengers who did not have a fully-
charged battery on their device found themselves without an electrical outlet to recharge
the battery during the flight. Some airlines have acknowledged the need to solve this
electrical power problem, but concede it’s not likely to happen anytime soon.

processors (which replaced typewriters), and the Internet (which, increasingly, is replacing
libraries). These disruptive technologies have had a profound impact on society, altering the
way people live, work, and play.
Today, another disruptive technology is changing our world: wireless. Thanks to wireless data
communications, it’s no longer necessary to remain tethered by cable to a network in order to
surf the Web, check e-mail, or access inventory records. Wireless has made mobility possible
to a degree rarely even imagined before: users can access the same resources standing on a
street corner or walking across a college campus as they can while sitting at a desk. Although
wireless voice communication started the revolution in the 1990s, wireless data communica-
tions are the driving force in the 21st century.
Wireless data networks are found virtually everywhere. Travelers can have wireless access
while waiting in airports, traveling on airplanes and trains, and working in their hotel rooms.
At work, businesses have found that employees who have wireless access to data during
meetings and in conference rooms can significantly increase their productivity. Free wireless
Internet connections are available in restaurants across the country, and in some arenas and
stadiums fans can even order concessions wirelessly and have them delivered to their seats.
There is hardly a sector of the economy that has not been dramatically affected by wireless
data technology.
Statistics confirm this. Since 2007, the number of locations where wireless data services are
available has increased 40 percent annually. Each year, hundreds of millions of wireless data
devices are sold (up from 22 million in 2003 and almost zero in 1999). Virtually all laptop
computers sold today have wireless data capabilities as standard equipment. By 2014, the
amount of data traffic traveling the mobile network will be equal to about a billion DVDs.
Ours is truly a wireless world.
In this chapter you will first explore some of the contemporary uses for wireless data commu-
nications. Next, you will look at the advantages and disadvantages of wireless, and also explore
the four types of wireless networks. After looking at wireless standards organizations and
regulatory agencies, you will then learn about the Certified Wireless Network Administrator
(CWNA) certification.

Wireless data communications are found across all sectors of the economy. However, several
sectors use wireless more extensively than others. These include education, business, industry,
travel, public safety, and health care.
Education
Wireless data communications are an ideal technology for colleges and schools. In fact,
educational institutions were among the earliest adopters of wireless technology because of

the advantages it offers to people engaged in teaching and learning. A teacher who creates a
classroom presentation on her laptop computer in her office can carry that computer with
her into the classroom, where it will connect automatically to the campus network. This
frees the teacher from spending limited class time wrestling with connecting cables to often
hard-to-find network jacks. Many classroom projection systems have built-in wireless capa-
bilities, allowing the teacher to transmit her presentation to the projector without any cable
connections. And in settings where students bring their own wireless devices to class, teachers
can immediately send handouts directly to students sitting in the classroom.
Students also benefit from the freedom that wireless data connections offer. No longer must
students go to a specific computer lab or to the library in order to access the school’s com-
puter network; instead, they can connect to the network wirelessly from anywhere on cam-
pus. As they move to different classrooms in different buildings, they can remain connected
to the network. Most schools publish maps, like the one shown in Figure 1-1, which show
the location of wireless coverage areas in buildings across campus.

Wireless data technology even translates into a cost savings for schools. Traditional class-
rooms can become fully accessible computer labs without the added expense of installing wir-
ing or purchasing student computers. And schools can reduce the number of open computer
labs (those without classes scheduled to use them) since all students can access network
resources at anytime and from any location on campus.
Business
Wireless data technologies have also transformed the way business is conducted. Before the
days of wireless, meetings were often held in conference rooms, where participants were unable
to access the data stored on their office computers that they needed to make important deci-
sions. This meant it was often impossible to finalize critical decisions at a meeting; important
decisions were therefore delayed, with valuable time used up later by extensive follow-up
e-mails and voice mail messages. Conference rooms that did have wired connections rarely
had enough connections for all participants, and if someone forgot to bring a cable (or lacked
a cable that was long enough), connecting to the network was impossible.
The introduction of wireless data access in conference rooms provides all employees with a
mobile office that offers immediate access to the data that they need while away from their
desks. Employees no longer have to compete for an available wired connection or carry long
cables with them. Instead, using wireless devices, everyone can be a productive member of
the discussion.
Wireless data connectivity can result in substantial cost savings for an organization. A study
by Cisco of over 25,000 of its employees showed that significant savings were realized when
employees used the wireless data network.i Examples include time saved in moving to other
rooms within a building or between buildings on campus sites, time saved before and during
meetings, improved collaboration and access to information during meetings and impromptu
working groups, and improved response time to customers. The average increase in produc-
tivity was 86 minutes per day, or the equivalent of 315 additional hours per user per year.
For Cisco this equaled a productivity increase of over $24,500 annually per employee.
This same study by Cisco showed that 43 percent of its employees
used a wireless network as their primary connection method and
80 percent said that wireless was critical or highly useful to their job.
Large business organizations are not the only beneficiaries of wireless data communications.
A small office/home office (SOHO), which typically has ten or fewer employees, can likewise
benefit from the advantages of wireless. The fact that cabling is not required for each com-
puter, printer, scanner, or other device can result in cost savings. To further reduce costs, all
employees can share a single Internet connection. Wireless technologies allow businesses to
even create an office in a space where a wired infrastructure does not exist. This means new
space can be made accessible immediately without long waits for an expensive cabling infra-
structure to be installed.
Industry
The possibilities for wireless data transmissions in industry are limitless. Some interesting
examples are found in the fields of construction, warehouse management, and manufacturing.

Construction When constructing a new building or creating an addition to an existing
structure, it is often necessary to complete one part of the construction process before the
next can begin. For example, it is necessary to pour the concrete footings for a new building
before constructing the walls. A single delay in such a chain of events can idle large numbers
of construction employees or force rescheduling, sometimes on short notice.
Another complication arises when construction employees have to travel to several job sites
on the same day. This makes paperwork management a difficult task. Pay sheets must be
manually filled out by different foremen and dropped off at the office late at night. The
next day, payroll clerks have to wrestle with scrawled or illegible notes, sometimes having
to contact multiple foremen for clarification. Construction professionals are resolving these
problems with wireless data technology. Information from the job site, such as a tardy sub-
contractor or a problem with materials, can be instantly relayed back to the main office so
that workers can be routed to other sites to prevent idle time. When foremen enter timesheet
information on their mobile wireless tablets, it is immediately transmitted to the main office
in the construction trailer located on the job site.
Construction equipment such as bulldozers and earth graders are fitted with wireless
devices in order to turn them into smart machines capable of precise positioning using a
global positioning system (GPS). The GPS is composed of 27 earth-orbiting satellites (some
satellites are spares in case one fails), each of which circles the globe twice a day at a height
of 12,000 miles (19,300 km, or kilometers). It was originally developed by the U.S. military
in the late 1970s as a navigation system, but was later opened to civilian use. Because the
system can identify the precise location of a GPS receiver, heavy equipment so fitted can
receive the accurate location information that is essential in modern construction. The
exact location where the bulldozer should begin shoveling can be transmitted to a terminal
on the bulldozer, as shown in Figure 1-2. Some systems even display a color-coded map to
guide the operator.
The same bulldozer can also be connected to a wireless data
system that tracks the company’s heavy equipment inventory,
including the location of each bulldozer on the construction site.
Meanwhile, the bulldozer’s engine diagnostic system can send
wireless reminders about upcoming maintenance tasks, such as oil
changes, to the maintenance team.
Warehouse Management Managing a warehouse stocked with inventory can be a
nightmare. New products arrive continuously and must be inventoried and stored. When
products are shipped out of the warehouse they must be located, transferred to the correct
loading dock, and, finally, placed on the right truck. A mistake in any one of these steps
can result in a warehouse stocked with products that cannot be located, customers receiving
the wrong items, or a store running out of goods to sell.
Wireless technology has become essential for warehouse operations. Forklift trucks in a
warehouse are typically outfitted with wireless equipment, while employees wear portable
wireless inventory devices (like that shown in Figure 1-3) to scan inventory bar codes.
All of this equipment is connected to a wireless data network. Warehouse management sys-
tem (WMS) software is used to manage all warehouse activities, from receiving through

ready access to up-to-the-minute statistics.
Today new wireless technologies are making warehouse management even more efficient.

(RFID) tags. RFID tags emit a wireless data signal containing an identification number that
is linked to information such as product code dates or expiration dates, originating plants,
lines of manufacture, and so on, in the WMS. As shown in Figure 1-4, an RFID tag can eas-
ily be affixed to the underside of a printed label.
As pallets arrive, a forklift truck operator picks up a load and drives it over an RFID pad
reader on the floor, as illustrated in Figure 1-5. The pad reader receives the RFID signal,

and sends data about the contents of the pallet to the WMS, which designates a storage
location for the pallet, updates the inventory database, and relays the information back to
the forklift truck operator via the wireless data network. The forklift operator then trans-
ports the pallet to the correct storage location in the warehouse. Additional RFID tags
attached to the front of every storage rack (that is, to each face rack) serve to identify each
storage location. The wireless signals from these tags allow the forklift operator to confirm
that he has arrived at the correct location before depositing the load.
Some forklift trucks even have sensors to help identify what the fork-
lift is doing by monitoring the position of its load rest (a load rest is
on the front of the forklift where the pallet of merchandise is held).
If the load rest is moving vertically, it is assumed that the forklift is
transporting a load to another location or is traveling to pick one
up. Yet if the load rest is moving horizontally, it is assumed that the forklift is about to pick
up or deliver a pallet and the RFID reader can then look for the face rack location tag and a
corresponding pallet tag. The system can also determine if the pallet should be placed in the
location just read or if the operator has removed the pallet from that location.
In the front office, orders are received and entered into the computer that connects to the
wireless data network in the warehouse. The WMS software manages order picking (that
is, the sequence in which separate orders are filled), balances workloads, and selects the
sequence individual items of an order to be gathered for lift truck operators. The dock con-
trol module then releases orders for picking. A forklift operator locates the correct storage
location, receives the RFID tag signal, and then ferries it to the shipping dock to be loaded
onto a truck.
Manufacturing In a manufacturing environment wireless data communications are also
extensively used. Much like warehouse management, RFID tags are read with portable wire-
less devices that are connected to the wireless data network to manage raw materials as they
come in and inventory as it goes out.
Wireless data networks are also used in the manufacturing process itself. In one manufactur-
ing plant, when additional parts are needed on the production line, workers at the facility
press call buttons, located on wireless tags mounted adjacent to parts containers, to request
more stock. The battery-powered tags transmit the request over the facility’s wireless
data network. Because no cables have to be installed for this system, the production line
can be quickly reconfigured to accommodate special production orders or changes in the
manufacturing process.
Travel
Because traveling is all about mobility, the travel industry uses wireless technologies exten-
sively. Airplanes are not the only form of transportation to provide wireless data communica-
tions for passengers. The San Francisco Bay Area Rapid Transit (BART) trains are outfitted
with wireless data transmission capabilities for Internet access on trains moving 81 miles per
hour (128 kilometers per hour); subscriptions can be purchased by day, month, or year.
In Boston, the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) offers free wireless
data service on all of its 13 commuter rail lines. The Washington State Ferry system provides
wireless Internet data access to ferry passengers on its 15 boats near Seattle.

Most transportation terminals provide wireless data communications
for passengers to use as they wait for their carrier. Some airport
terminals charge a fee while others provide the service for free.
A growing trend is to provide free wireless access but force the
users to watch a 30-second video advertisement before they can
connect. The ad revenue reaped by airports generally matches or exceeds the amount previ-
ously generated from paid services.
Wireless technology, however, goes beyond serving just the passenger. Airlines use wireless
technology to communicate with the aircraft that are parked or taxiing on the ground. This
allows the airline to automatically upload and install software updates for onboard compu-
ters or the electronics (called avionics) system before the next flight. Airlines are also using
wireless technology for flight maintenance information. Aircraft maintenance personnel with
a wireless laptop can have immediate access to an online database that stores important
information about each type of aircraft and maintenance procedures. This information is
much more current than that found in printed manuals.
New automobiles are equipped with wireless data communications. Within the car itself,
wireless connectivity allows passengers to synchronize their cellular phone address books
with the car’s installed hard drive or control their portable electronic devices (like MP3
players) using the radio and steering wheel controls. The car can also be connected wirelessly
to the Internet, allowing passengers using laptops or tablet computers to surf the Web. Wireless
technology is also used on automobiles to monitor tire pressure, unlock doors and trunks,
and even eliminate the need to use a key to start the engine.
A newly developed wireless technology is poised to dramatically change the way drivers use
their cars. Known as vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) communications, it uses both GPS and wireless
technology to create a network that allows cars to communicate with one another. Such a
system can alert a driver that a car ten vehicles ahead has suddenly braked or that another
car is about to run a red light in an intersection ahead, giving drivers enough time to avert
an accident. The V2V system will also allow cars to constantly communicate with roadside
units connected to a traffic management center. This means cars caught in a traffic jam can
send signals to alert approaching vehicles to exit the road and find a better route.
The V2V system actually is closer to implementation than it may seem.
Much of the technology is already present in today’s modern vehicles,
and adding additional capabilities is relatively inexpensive. The major
cost is building smart intersections, with the wireless infrastructure
required to receive data from cars and then relay this data to other cars.
Public Safety
Vehicles owned by public safety organizations, such as police and fire departments, are
moving away from older telecommunications systems to newer wireless networks. To make
this possible, wireless data equipment is usually installed on city-owned buildings or on sites
frequented by public safety vehicles, such as municipal fuel pumps where police cars are
refueled. Through this equipment, data, such as building floor plans, photographs of criminal
suspects, maps, and other information, can be quickly downloaded to the portable computer
installed in a vehicle’s front seat. Officers on patrol, or firefighters at a fire, can then quickly
access this information as needed.

Health Care
Administering medication in a hospital is a significant challenge for the health-care industry.
It is estimated that incorrectly dispensed medication results in hundreds of thousands of med-
ical emergencies annually. Typically, printouts listing medications to be administered are
posted at the medication storage area. Whenever a nurse dispenses a medication, she crosses
it off the list and initials the change. However, the elapsed time between when a doctor issues
an order for a new or changed medication and the time that an updated printout is posted
in the medication storage area means that a patient could get an unnecessary and potentially
dangerous dose of medication before the new medication order can be processed.
Another drawback to the paper printout system is that it entails duplicate documentation.
A nurse first has to check the prescription printout to determine the medication to be given.
Then she has to document on paper that she actually gave the medication to the patient.
Later, she has to enter that same data on a computer.
By contrast, wireless data point-of-care computer systems allow medical staff to access
and update patient records immediately. Many hospitals use laptop computers on mobile
carts or hand-held tablet computers with barcode scanners or RFID readers and a wireless
connection. Health-care professionals can document a patient’s medication administration
immediately in the computer as they move from room to room without reconnecting and dis-
connecting cables. Nurses first identify themselves to the computer system by scanning their
own personal bar-coded ID badge or RFID tag. The patient’s bar-coded armband or RFID
tag is then scanned and all medications that are currently due for that particular patient are
displayed on the screen. The medications to be administered are sealed in RFID-tagged
pouches or bar-coded bottles. Nurses scan this barcode or RFID tag before opening the
package. An alert immediately appears on the screen if the wrong medication or an incorrect
amount is identified. After administering the medication to the patient, the nurse indicates
through the wireless network that the medication has been given, essentially electronically
signing the distribution form. A hard copy can be printed out as needed.
The system immediately verifies that medication is being administered to the correct patient
in the correct dosage, which eliminates potential errors and documentation inefficiencies.
Also, because the documentation process takes place at the bedside where care is delivered,
the accuracy of the documentation is improved. Another advantage is that the system
gives all hospital personnel real-time access to the latest medication and patient status
information.
Wireless technology is also used in other medical areas besides health-care administration.
For example, a new technique for diagnosing digestive problems involves a tiny camera and
a wireless transmitter in the form of a pill that a patient swallows. As the pill works its way
through the digestive system, it records two images each second and transmits those images
to a receiving device worn on the patient’s belt. At the end of eight hours the device
is retrieved and the doctor can then view the downloaded pictures, all obtained without
performing invasive surgery. A video pill is illustrated in Figure 1-6.
Health care outside of the hospital also benefits from wireless technology. A pilot project in
Massachusetts helps patients manage their hypertension, diabetes, and weight by having
them take their blood pressure twice per week with a digital monitor that is attached to a
computer connected to the Internet. This data is sent to the center’s main database, where it
is automatically compared with the patient’s history accumulated over several months to

determine his progress and alert physicians if additional actions need to be taken. The only
drawback to this system is that the patient has to use the specific computer to which the digital
monitor is attached. To provide more flexibility, the program is now looking at incorporating
wireless technology so that patients can send in their information from virtually anywhere.
Researchers are also working on “smart slippers” that monitor the
acceleration and pressure in a patient’s walk. The wireless sensor can
not only alert caregivers when a patient falls but even can identify
unsteady steps that could mean disorientation or sickness.

device like a tablet, laptop computer, or smartphone that remains in contact with the network no
matter where the user may roam, as long as they stay within range of that device’s network.
In today’s business world, an increasingly mobile workforce is important. Many employees
spend large portions of their time away from the office. These workers, equipped with laptop
or tablet computers, rely on wireless data networks to connect to information on the company
network. Many occupations that require workers to be mobile, such as field repair technicians
or inventory clerks, find that wireless technology is essential to their work.
Another characteristic of the business world of today is flatter organizations—that is, orga-
nizations structured around teams that cross functional and organizational boundaries. As a
result, employees are involved extensively in team meetings that occur away from their
desks, yet still require immediate access to network resources. Wireless networks are again
the solution to the problem. They give team-based workers the ability to access the network
resources they need while collaborating in a team environment.
Access Wireless data communications can also be used to provide access to a network
where previously none existed. A hotspot is a specific geographic location that is served by
a wireless data system and provides network access to mobile users. Hotspots are typically
located in areas in which many users can take advantage of the service, such as college
campuses, libraries, conventions centers, airports, and hotels.
Although difficult to determine precisely, by one estimate there are over 562,000 free and
pay hotspot locations in 142 countries around the world. The United Kingdom has the
most hotspots, with 143,000, compared to second-place China’s 102,000. The U.S. cities
with the most hotspot locations are listed in Table 1-1.
Several city and county local governments have funded and deployed wireless data commu-
nications hotspots, primarily in downtown areas, parks and recreation areas, and other
high-traffic areas. Known as municipal networks, these hotspots offer several advantages to
citizens and local economies:

Areas with municipal networks can become more attractive to businesses, especially
high-tech or research companies that need communication.

●
Businesses can recruit new employees from the area without the individuals needing to
relocate since they can do their work using the local municipal network.
●
Local police, firefighters, and municipal workers can use the municipal wireless net-
work to access information such as images from security cameras, blueprints, and
criminal records.
●
Municipal networks provide high speed Internet access for free or at a cost less than
Internet Service Providers (ISPs) who serve the area.
Municipal networks allow police to show witnesses to a crime a
“virtual lineup” by downloading images of suspects through the
wireless network.
However, municipal networks have experienced problems. Several large cities that embarked
on ambitious municipal networks, such as Philadelphia and San Francisco, have had to scale
back or even suspend their plans. Existing ISPs have objected to unfair competition from
governments using tax funding, and some private companies who contracted with local
governments to install wireless data networks have been forced to pull out of the projects
because their costs in building the network had significantly increased and the number of
projected users who would sign up for the service could not be accurately determined.
Despite other cities scaling back, New York City is increasing its wire-
less presence. Free wireless service will be provided in 20 city parks by
2016. The city has also partnered with a company to provide a fast
(up to 26 Mbps) network that covers seven square miles of Manhattan.
Connectivity Wireless data networks can also be used to provide improved service, to
extend the reach of networks into areas that were difficult or even impossible to serve, and
to provide a less expensive alternative to wired connections.
One of the problems that plague both home and office users who need to access the Internet
is the last mile connection. This refers to the connection that begins at a fast Internet service
provider, goes through the local neighborhood, and ends at the home or office. Whereas the
connections that make up the nation’s data transmission infrastructure are very fast and well
established, the last mile connection that links these high-speed transmission lines to the
home or office are much slower and not universally available. These slow last mile connections
are bottlenecks for users: any high-speed traffic must be throttled back to the slow speed of the
last-mile connection, thus reducing the overall connection speed.
A solution to the last mile connection problem is a wireless ISP. A wireless ISP provides
wireless data access directly to the home or office instead of a cable or Digital Subscriber
Line (DSL) connection. High-speed wireless ISPs can provide in some instances speeds up to
7 Mbps. In addition, this wireless service is not restricted to the home: it can be available
while visiting other offices in the area or even traveling in a car.
Organizations typically have multiple buildings, or even entire campuses with multiple build-
ings, that all need to be connected into a single data network via a backhaul connection.
A backhaul connection is an organization’s internal infrastructure connection between two
or more remote locations.

Until recently, organizations typically used trunk-based leased lines, leased from a local car-
rier, to connect multiple locations. However, installing these special high-speed circuits is a
very expensive and lengthy process. Current costs to run a fiber optic cable can range as
high as $200,000 per mile (1.6 km), with almost 85 percent of that amount spent on to dig-
ging trenches and installation. Street trenching and digging are not only expensive but they
also can cause major traffic inconvenience, displace trees, and sometimes even mar or
destroy historical areas. Because of these disruptions, some cities are considering a morato-
rium on street trenching. And since laying fiber optic cable can be so complex—involving
the acquisitions of right-of-ways, moving existing buried utilities, and burying fiber optic
cable—it is not uncommon for fiber optic installations to take six to eight months or longer,
even between two buildings in close proximity.
In some cities, the cost of laying a fiber optic cable can run as high
as $3 million per mile.
As an alternative, wireless data networks can be used for building-to-building connections,
eliminating the costs associated with leasing lines or installing fiber optic cables. Wireless
networks can also be used to extend an existing network to remote sites.
The wireless equipment that is used for connecting buildings and
sites is covered in Chapter 2.
Deployment Many buildings were constructed long before personal computers and
networks were even imagined. Installing network cabling in these older buildings, which
often have thick masonry walls and plaster ceilings, can be difficult and costly. Also, older
buildings often contain asbestos which, according to today’s regulations, has to be completely
removed before any major cabling infrastructure can be installed. Adding to the difficulties
associated with older buildings, local or national landmark regulations often restrict the
modification of facilities with historical value.
In these instances, deploying a wireless network is the ideal solution because the need to run
cables is eliminated. Historic buildings can be preserved, dangerous asbestos is left
untouched, and difficult drilling is avoided. Deploying a wireless network is also cheaper
than laying cable. With cable connections costing $1 to $3 per connection, a wireless net-
work can easily pay for itself by eliminating the need for a network connection in each
office. Choosing wireless also means the days or even weeks it can take to pull wires
through the ceiling and then drop cables down walls to network outlets are no longer an
issue. Finally, deploying a wireless network is far less detrimental to productivity than instal-
ling cable because, with wireless, employees do not have to struggle to do their work in the
midst of the disruption caused by cable installation.
Wireless networks also make it easier for any office—in either an old or new building—to
be modified with new cubicles or furniture. The floor plan for a remodeled office
does not, first and foremost, have to accommodate the location of existing computer
jacks. Instead, the focus can be on creating the most effective work environment for the

employees. The computer can be connected to the network no matter where it is placed
in the cubicle.
Wireless networks can also improve network reliability. One of the common sources of
network problems is network cable failure. Moisture from a leak during a thunderstorm or
a coffee spill can erode metallic conductors on a network connection. A user who shifts the
computer on his or her desk can break one or more of the wires in a patch cable. A cable
splice that is done incorrectly can cause problems that result in intermittent errors that are
very difficult to identify. Using wireless networks eliminates these types of cable failures
and increases the overall reliability of the network.
Table 1-2 lists the advantages of wireless data networks.
Disadvantages
The many advantages of wireless data networks technology should not mask the dis-
advantages and concerns. These include security, radio signal interference, range of coverage,
and slower speeds.
Security A wireless signal is not confined to a cable as in a traditional network; instead, it
is broadcast in the open, making security for wireless networks a prime concern. Wireless
security presents a number of unique challenges, including:
●
Unauthorized users can access the network. Because a wireless signal is not confined
to the four walls of the building, an unauthorized user can often pick up the signal
outside the building’s security perimeter. It is possible for an intruder to be lurking in
the parking lot with a wireless laptop computer to intercept the signals and access the
network. Once on the network, the intruder could read sensitive documents or infect
the entire network with malicious software.
●
Attackers can eavesdrop on transmissions. In a wired network, an attacker would have
to gain access to the interior of the building to reach the network cabling infrastructure
before he could access the network to eavesdrop on data being transmitted. With a
wireless network, if that information is not properly protected an attacker only has to
pick up the wireless signal in order to see what is being transmitted.
●
Employees can easily compromise network security. An employee could purchase
inexpensive wireless equipment and then secretly bring it into the office in order to
provide personal wireless access. However, this could defeat the existing network
security because it allows an attacker to pick up the employee’s illicit wireless signal
and enter the network by bypassing the organization’s security.

Attackers can easily crack legacy wireless security. Early types of wireless networks
had basic security features that were easy for attackers to defeat. Although current
products have more robust security features, legacy products with these weak security
features are still in use. Users are then sometimes mistaken in their belief that, because
the security features are turned on, they are protected.
Wireless security is covered in Chapters 9 and 10.
Radio Signal Interference Wireless devices operate using radio signals, creating the
potential for two types of signal interference. Signals from other devices can disrupt wireless
network transmissions, or the wireless network device may itself be the source of interference
for other devices. Several different types of devices transmit a radio signal that could inter-
fere with a wireless data network, either by causing errors or by completely preventing
transmissions. These devices include microwave ovens, elevator motors, photocopying
machines, certain types of outdoor lighting systems, theft protection devices, and cordless
telephones.
Range of Coverage The area in which a wireless network signal radiates is limited.
Some wireless signals only have a range of 10 feet (33 meters), while other signals can
extend over 350 feet (107 meters). Although this may be sufficient for a home or classroom,
this area of coverage is very limited for many applications.
Slow Speed Standard wired LANs can transmit at 1 billion bits per second—1,000
Mbps, or 1 Gbps (gigabit per second)—and even faster networks operating at 10 times
that speed are now becoming common. Older wireless data transmissions are far slower
than that, generally ranging less than 50 Mbps. Although new wireless technologies can
push speeds above 600 Mbps, this is still relatively slow for tasks such as downloading
large video files.
Another speed-related problem has to do with the fact that a packet moving through a wire-
less network is slower than a packet moving through a wired network. This delay, known
as latency, can be problematic for time-sensitive communications such as voice or video
transmissions.
When wireless data networks were first introduced, the potential
health risks of the radio frequency energy emitted by such net-
works were considered another disadvantage. At the time, it was
well documented that high levels of this energy can produce bio-
logical damage through heating effects (this is how a microwave
oven is able to cook food). Some experts feared that the energy emitted by wireless
networks would have similar effects. However, most wireless devices emit very low levels
of energy; these levels are now considered nonsignificant and do not appear to have
health consequences.

Types of Wireless Networks
C W N A
2.1.1. Identify some of the uses for spread spectrum technologies.
The different types of wireless networks can be classified into four broad categories: wireless
personal area networks, wireless local area networks, wireless metropolitan area networks,
and wireless wide area networks. In the following sections, you will read how a fictional char-
acter named Braden uses these types of networks during a typical work day.
Wireless Personal Area Network (WPAN)
A wireless personal area network (WPAN) is a wireless network designed for hand-held and
portable devices at slow transmission speeds and in close proximity to other devices.
The maximum distance between devices is generally 33 feet (10 meters) with speeds of only
1 Mbps.
As Braden drives to his office, he needs to make a phone call to confirm his morning appointment.
Braden’s car is equipped with hands-free cellular calling based on the Bluetooth wireless standard.
Bluetooth is the name given to a WPAN technology that uses short-range transmissions. Origi-
nally designed in 1994 by the cellular telephone company Ericsson as a way to replace wires with
radio-based technology, Bluetooth has moved beyond that original design. Bluetooth tech-
nology enables users to connect wirelessly to a wide range of computing and telecommunica-
tions devices. It provides for rapid on-the-fly ad hoc connections between devices. Bluetooth
is designed for notebook and tablet computers, cellular smartphones, and other portable
devices. One of the advantages of Bluetooth is its low power consumption.
Bluetooth is named after the tenth-century Danish King Harald
“Bluetooth” Gormsson, who was responsible for unifying Scandinavia.
Braden first turns on his Bluetooth-enabled cellular smartphone to pair it with the
Bluetooth capabilities in his car. He presses the Talk button on the steering wheel and

says aloud the name of the person he’s calling, Mia. His cell phone dials the number that
is stored in the car’s phonebook. The dialing and caller information, as well as signal
and battery strength, appear on the car’s instrument panel. Once Mia answers the call,
Braden can talk hands-free. The Bluetooth system also works with the car’s navigation
system, so Braden can auto-dial phone numbers associated with local points of interest,
such as hotels and restaurants.
Wireless Local Area Network (WLAN)
A wireless local area network (WLAN) is designed to replace or supplement a wired local
area network (LAN). Devices such as laptop computers, smartphones, printers, and game
consoles that are within 350 feet (107 meters) of each other or a centrally located connection
device can send and receive information at transmission speeds that typically range up to
600 Mbps.
On his way to the customer’s office Braden stops at a local coffee shop. As he sits at a table
outside on the patio, he opens his laptop computer to go through his presentation again.
Because his laptop has WLAN capabilities, he can wirelessly connect to the coffee shop’s cus-
tomer WLAN. He attaches his presentation to an e-mail and sends it to his coworker, Abby,
for her to review at her office. Braden also has a WLAN at home, where he can connect the
stereo system and television to the home computer network. This allows him to view pictures
stored on his computer on the larger TV screen, stream movies through his wireless network
to his TV, and to play stored MP3 music through his audio system.
Wireless Metropolitan Area Network (WMAN)
A wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) is designed for devices in a broader area of
coverage or at higher speeds. Generally a WMAN coverage area is from several city blocks to
an entire small city.
Braden drives to the customer’s manufacturing plant, which is located in an industrial park at
the edge of the city. As Braden sets up his laptop for his presentation, he asks Mia, the plant
manager, if she could share her company’s latest sales figures for a product. Mia pulls her
tablet computer from her purse and taps on it to access the company’s network at the main
office building almost two miles away. The two buildings are connected with a WMAN tech-
nology that uses light impulses to send and receive data. These low-powered beams, which do
not harm the human eye, are transmitted by transceivers that are mounted high indoors and
aimed at each other to provide a clear transmission path. Mia retrieves the information and
reads the latest sales figures to Braden.
Wireless Wide Area Network (WWAN)
A wireless wide area network (WWAN) is a wireless data network that extends beyond the
range of a WMAN. It can encompass multiple states, regions, or countries; in fact WWAN
can be a world-wide wireless data network.
After Mia sees Braden’s presentation in the conference room, she decides to show him a new
production facility on the plant floor. As they walk through the factory, she asks a question
that Braden cannot answer without accessing a recent e-mail. Braden can still connect to his
company’s network through the Internet using a 4G (Fourth Generation) cellular wireless
data network technology known as Long Term Evolution (LTE). Braden opens his backpack

and connects a small device to his laptop computer, an LTE modem, which looks like an
oversized Universal Serial Bus (USB) flash drive, as shown in Figure 1-7. This device allows
him to connect to his office because it can provide wireless access several miles away from
the transmission point at speeds up to 30 Mbps. Because Braden is within this range, he can
easily retrieve the e-mail.
Comparison of Wireless Networks
Although the distinctions between the four types of wireless networks—WPAN, WLAN,
WMAN, and WWAN—can sometimes blur, they are generally distinguished by transmis-
sion speeds and the maximum distances they cover. Figure 1-8 illustrates these differences.
Table 1-4 lists the characteristics of these types of wireless networks.

International Telecommunication Union Radio Communication
Sector (ITU-R)
The International Telecommunication Union Radio Communication Sector (ITU-R) is a divi-
sion of the International Telecommunication Union (ITU) and is responsible for the global man-
agement of the radio frequency spectrum. Its mission is to “ensure the rational, equitable, efficient
and economical use of the radio frequency spectrum by all radiocommunication services.”
ITU-R also develops and manages space-related assignment for satel-
lites by locating suitable orbital slots.

The ITU-R, which works on a global level, manages the international radio frequency
spectrum and develops standards for wireless communications systems to ensure the most
effective possible use of the spectrum. The ITU-R’s system for managing the international
spectrum is based on the ITU-R’s regulatory procedures for frequency coordination, notifica-
tion and registration.
Federal Communications Commission (FCC)
In the United States, the organization that controls and regulates wireless transmissions for
use by citizens is the Federal Communications Commission (FCC). The FCC serves as the
primary regulatory agency for wireless communications in the United States and its territorial
possessions. The FCC is an independent government agency that is directly responsible
to Congress, established by the Communications Act of 1934 and charged with regulating
interstate and international communications by radio, television, wire, satellite, and cable.
In order to preserve its independence, the FCC is directed by five
commissioners who are appointed by the President and confirmed
by the Senate for five-year terms. Only three commissioners may be
members of the same political party, and none of them can have a
financial interest in any FCC-related business.
The FCC’s responsibilities are broad. In addition to developing and implementing regulatory
programs, they also process applications for licenses and other filings, analyze complaints,
conduct investigations, and take part in congressional hearings. They also represent the
United States in negotiations with other nations about telecommunications issues.
The FCC plays an important role in wireless communications. It regulates radio and televi-
sion broadcast stations as well as cable and satellite stations, and also oversees cellular tele-
phones, pagers, and two-way radios. The FCC regulates the use of radio frequencies to fulfill
the communications needs of businesses, local and state governments, public safety service
providers, aircraft and ship operators, and individuals. The FCC is also charged with regulat-
ing the radio frequency spectrum within the United States.
International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) is an international body that
sets industrial and commercial standards. Composed of representatives from national
standards organizations, the ISO is officially not a government entity. However, because
of treaties or existing national standards, the decisions of the ISO usually become law in
all nations.
The ISO says that their work is to “make a positive difference to the
world we live in.”
The ISO identifies needs in business and then develops standards to address those needs.
The goal of the ISO is to make the development, manufacturing, and supply of products
and services more efficient, safer, and cleaner. The ISO also works to make trade between
countries easier and fairer.

Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)
In the field of computer networking and wireless communications, the most widely known
and influential organization is the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE).
The IEEE and its predecessor organizations date back to 1884. The IEEE is one of the lead-
ing developers of global standards in a broad range of industries such as energy, biomedical
and health care, and transportation. It is currently involved in developing and revising over
800 standards. Some of these standards apply to circuits and devices, communication and
information technology, control and automation, electromagnetics, geoscience, ocean technol-
ogy and remote sensing, instrumentation and measurement and testing, optics, power and
energy, and signal processing.
The IEEE is best known for its work in establishing standards for computer networks. In the
early 1980s, the IEEE began work on Project 802, which focused on developing computer net-
work architecture standards. Project 802 quickly expanded into several different categories of
network technology, such as 802.3 (Ethernet), 802.5 (Token Ring), and 802.15.1 (Bluetooth).
The IEEE standard for WLANs is typically referred to as IEEE 802.11. The full name for
this standard is as follows: IEEE 802.11-2007 IEEE Standard for Information technology—
Telecommunications and information exchange between systems—Local and metropolitan
area networks—Specific requirements Part 11: Wireless LAN Medium Access Control
(MAC) and Physical Layer (PHY) Specifications. Amendments, modifications, and changes
to the standard are designated by a letter (or two) appended to “IEEE 802.11.” For example,
some variations on the standard include IEEE 802.11g, IEEE 802.11n, and IEEE 802.11af.
The IEEE group responsible for creating and overseeing a specific standard is a committee
called a working group (WG) and is identified by the standard for which they are responsible,
such as the IEEE 802.11 WG. Within the WGs are various subgroups. These include ad-hoc
groups, study groups (SGs), and task groups (TGs). The TGs are responsible for specific
amendments and are also designated by the amendment letter, such as the IEEE 802.11 TGa.
The creation and ratification process of IEEE standards and their amendments is a lengthy
process. First, an SG, composed of interested persons, defines the purpose of the amendment
and creates a charter. The charter identifies the problem the proposed amendment is designed
to address and explains how to identify when the problem has been solved. The charter
is then presented to the entire WG. Because the WG only meets once each quarter, creating
the charter by the SG usually takes at least two quarters (six months). If the SG charter is
accepted by the WG, a TG is sanctioned; the TG must then either fulfill the charter that
results in an amendment or a recommendation, or disband if no solution can be identified.
The TG begins its work by making a formal call for proposals. Each proposal is presented,
reviewed, and voted upon before the actual amendment writing process can begin. (The writ-
ing process itself can take anywhere from six months to several years. Once the TG finishes
writing the amendment, the amendment is circulated to the entire 802.11 WG voting mem-
bership for comments and subsequent voting. This commentary and voting process is done
for as many iterations, or rounds, as necessary, until all comments are resolved and an
80-percent favorable vote is reached. This voting process can take at least six more months
and up to several years.) Once the amendment has been approved by the 802.11 WG, it is
passed on to the entire IEEE 802 committee. Upon approval from that committee, the
amendment becomes ratified. After ratification, the amendment must be officially published
and distributed to the general public. Figure 1-9 illustrates the IEEE ratification process.

Developing a standard or amendment is a very time-consuming
process. Under the best of conditions, where there is already general
agreement with little discussion, the standards process takes a mini-
mum of 18 months, while a controversial proposal can take several
years to be approved. Because the 802.11 WG meetings are held
quarterly and attended by over 1,000 participants, of whom 70 percent have earned voting
status, someone has said that producing an IEEE-ratified amendment is like writing a book
with 700 authors!
The IEEE also uses its own set of terms to define the different documents used in the process.
These terms are listed in Table 1-5.
There is no standard or TG named “802.11x.” Instead, “802.11x” is
used informally to designate a current or future 802.11 amendment
in those cases where further precision is not necessary.
Wi-Fi Alliance
In 1999, a consortium of wireless equipment manufacturers and software providers was
formed to promote wireless network technology. This group was initially known as the
Wireless Ethernet Compatibility Alliance (WECA) and had three goals:
●
To encourage wireless manufacturers to use the IEEE WLAN technologies in their
wireless networking products
●
To promote and market these technologies to consumers in the home, SOHO settings,
and in large enterprise businesses and organizations

To test and certify that wireless products adhere to the IEEE standards to ensure
product interoperability
In October 2002 the WECA organization changed its name to Wi-Fi (Wireless Fidelity)
Alliance, which reflected the name of the certification that it uses (Wi-Fi) to verify that a
product follows IEEE standards. Wireless devices are sometimes generically called Wi-Fi,
while in reality only products that have passed Wi-Fi Alliance testing are allowed to refer to
their products as Wi-Fi Certified, which is a registered trademark.
Certified Wireless Network Administrator (CWNA)
The goal of the Certified Wireless Network Professional (CWNP) organization is to educate
professionals in the technology of enterprise WLAN products. This can help these profes-
sionals to manage a wireless LAN infrastructure—regardless of which vendor’s products are
used—and maintain a wireless network that is cost-effective, reliable, and secure.
In order to provide this level of education, the CWNP offers multiple vendor-neutral enterprise
wireless LAN certifications. The Certified Wireless Network Administrator (CWNA) certifica-
tion is the foundation level wireless LAN certification for the CWNP program. Individuals who
hold the CWNA certificate have demonstrated the necessary skills to successfully administer
enterprise-class wireless LANs.
Chapter Summary
■Wireless data communications are found across all sectors of the economy. Wireless
data communication is an ideal technology for colleges and schools. Instructors can use
wireless to facilitate lectures in the classroom, while students can use wireless to access
the school’s network from virtually any location on campus. Schools can save funds by
installing wireless networks and reducing the number of traditional computer labs that
are needed. Businesses use wireless technologies to increase employee productivity.
A wired conference room allows all participants to have access to their data while away
from their desks and create a mobile office environment. Even small office/home office
(SOHO) businesses can reduce costs using wireless technologies.
■The construction industry relies heavily on wireless data technologies, from
managing pay sheets and rescheduling workers to precisely positioning earth movers
and bulldozers on the construction site. Warehouse management has become a critical
element in today’s operations. Both forklifts and employees are fitted with portable
wireless systems for tracking the flow of inventory into and out of the warehouse.
Coupled with radio frequency identification (RFID) tags, warehouse wireless data
systems help control inventories. Manufacturing plants use wireless data networks for
managing raw materials, finished inventory, and in the manufacturing process itself.
■The travel industry uses wireless communications for providing Internet access to
passengers, installing software updates on airplanes, and accessing the latest mainte-
nance information. Many public safety departments use wireless data networks for
downloading building plans or even photographs of criminal suspects. Hospitals and
health-care organizations use wireless data networks to control the administration of
pharmaceuticals to patients.

■There are many advantages to wireless technology. One of the primary advantages is
the user’s capability to move about without being connected by a cable, thus enabling
access from almost any location inside or out of a building. Wireless data communica-
tions can also be used to provide access to a network where previously none existed.
A hotspot is a specific geographic location that is served by a wireless data system and
provides network access to mobile users; hotspots are found in a variety of settings.
A municipal network is a hotspot or series of hotspots funded by local governments.
Another advantage of wireless networks is improved connectivity; they can be used to
provide improved service, to extend the reach of networks into areas that were diffi-
cult or even impossible to serve, or to provide a less expensive alternative to wired
connections. Because installing a wired network cabling system can be costly and often
difficult in older structures, wireless networks eliminate the need for extensive drilling
or retrofitting older buildings.
■One of the disadvantages of wireless data networks is security. Because a wireless
signal is not confined to a cable, attackers can pick up the signal outside of the build-
ing, read sensitive transmissions, and inject malware into an otherwise secure network.
Another disadvantage is radio signal interference: because wireless devices share the
same frequency spectrums they can interfere with the transmission of each other. The
coverage range of wireless signals can be limited, and the slow speed of the networks
in comparison to wired networks can also be problematic.
■There are four basic types of wireless networks. A wireless personal area network
(WPAN) is a wireless network designed for hand-held and portable devices at slow
transmission speeds and in close proximity to each other. A wireless local area
network (WLAN) is designed to replace or supplement a wired LAN, whereas a
wireless metropolitan area network (WMAN) is designed for devices in a broader
area of coverage (from several city blocks to an entire city) or at higher speeds.
A wireless wide area network (WWAN) can encompass multiple states, regions,
or countries.
■Several different organizations provide direction, standards, and accountability in
wireless technology. These include the International Telecommunication Union Radio
Communication Sector (ITU-R), the U.S. Federal Communications Commission (FCC),
the International Organization for Standardization (ISO), the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (IEEE), and the Wi-Fi Alliance.
■The Certified Wireless Network Administrator (CWNA) certification is the foundation
level wireless LAN certification for the CWNP program. Individuals who hold the
CWNA certificate have demonstrated the necessary skills to successfully administer
enterprise-class wireless LANs.

Hands-On Projects
Project 1-1: Locating Area Hotspots with Hotspot-
Locations
Different Internet tools are available to locate both free and fee-based hot-
spots. In this project you use one of those tools to find hotspots in your area.
1. Use your Web browser to go to www.hotspot-locations.com.
It is not unusual for Web sites to change the location of where files
are stored. If the URL above no longer functions or the location on
the Web page has changed then open a search engine and search
for “Hotspot-locations”.
2. Under Search Wireless Hotspot Database enter your location information under Country,
State, and City or Zip.
3. Be sure that Operator and Type are both are set to All. Click Search.
4. All hotspots registered with Hotspot-Locations are displayed under Hotspots found. If
no hotspots appear, change the location to a large city that is close to you or with
which you are familiar and search again.
You can also click All cities under Search Tip and manually select a
country, and then a city, that has a hotspot location registered with
Hotspot-Locations.
5. Under Hotspot name, click one of the links to a hotspot. What type of information
appears? Would this be useful in locating and connecting to that hotspot?
6. Click show on map. A map now appears with the location of this hotspot.

Depending on how the hotspot was registered, the exact location
may not be displayed and you may need to enter additional informa-
tion, such as the city or state of the area in which you are searching.
7. Using the toolbar, pan to the left or right to move the map focus to the region in which
you live.
8. Use the toolbar’s zoom in and zoom out buttons to “drill down” to the city in which
you live.
9. Close the browser window that contains the map and return to the Hotspot-Locations
search results. Locate more hotspots by entering different location information and
viewing them on the map.
10. How would you rate Hotspot-Locations in terms of ease of use, accuracy, options, etc.?
11. Leave this browser window open for the next project.
Project 1-2: Locating Area Hotspots with Hotspotr
In this project you use a different online tool to find hotspots in your area.
1. Open a new tab on your Web browser that is still open from the previous project and
go to hotspotr.com/wifi.
It is not unusual for Web sites to change. If the URL above no longer
functions then open a search engine and search for “hotspotr.com/wifi”.
2. Instead of allowing you to click on a map, the default search asks you to enter a loca-
tion as the focal point of the search. Enter an address as the starting point.
3. Click go.
4. Compare your results with the results you received using Hotspot-Locations.
5. Between Hotspot-Locations and Hotspotr, which tool has more hotspots listed? Why is
there a difference?
6. Now compare the options available on Hotspotr with those available on Hotspot-
Locations. Which are more comprehensive?
7. How would you rate Hotspotr in terms of ease of use, accuracy, options, etc.? Which
would you recommend to another wireless user?
8. Close your Web browser.
Project 1-3: Installing Network Meter Gadget
How do you locate a WLAN hotspot without information from using one of
the online hotspot locaters? One solution is to use a wireless signal meter that
shows when you have moved into a hotspot coverage area and also tells you
the strength of the signal. In this project you will download and install a pro-
gram to find a wireless signal.

Case Project 1-5: Nautilus IT Consulting
Nautilus IT Consulting (NITC) is a computer technology business that helps organizations
develop IT solutions. To accommodate its growing customer base, NITC often looks to outside
consultants for assistance on specific projects. NITC has asked you to help with new customers.
Luv Those Grandchildren! (LTG!) is a regional children’s clothing store that carries chil-
dren’s clothing. As a pilot program, LTG! wants to develop a wireless in-house inventory
management system for its store in the new upscale Indian Lake outdoor mall to replace
their manual system. As boxes of clothes are received at the Indian Lake store from the distri-
bution warehouse, they must be entered into the store’s inventory. (Because the storage area
for the retail stores is small, no forklifts are used.) Items for sale are then placed on the correct
shelf or rack in the store for customers to purchase. When a purchase is made, that item is sub-
tracted from the existing electronic inventory. A report produced every Monday and Thursday
informs the staff which items require restocking. Every Friday, the staff conducts a manual
inventory on all unsold items unsold. The manager then compares the manual inventory totals
the electronic inventory, and works with her staff to reconcile any discrepancies. NITC has
been asked to assist LTG! in this pilot program, and NITC has turned to you for assistance.
1. Create a PowerPoint presentation of eight or more slides that covers the basics of your
design for the new wireless inventory system. Include the advantages and disadvantages,
as well as the specific wireless technologies that you would implement.
2. After your successful presentation, NITC decides to encourage LTG! to expand the wireless
pilot program to include using a WMAN to connect the Indian Lake store to the distribution
warehouse located 12 miles away. The company management believes this will help cut
costs. Create a one-page memo addressed to LTG! Management that lists the advantages
and disadvantages of a WMAN. In the memo, recommend a specific wireless technol-
ogy and explain why. Use the Internet to research both costs for implementing the
system and any recurring monthly costs, and include those in your memo.

When wireless technologies were first introduced in the early 2000s, the health-care
industry was reluctant to implement them because of concerns that the signals from
wireless data networks would interfere with sensitive medical devices. This was
proven to not be an issue. Today, wireless has been embraced by hospitals and
health-care providers as a means to reduce costs and improve services. Hospitals rou-
tinely use wireless data point-of-care computer systems that allow medical staff to
access and update patient records from virtually any location.
The medical profession is now moving beyond using wireless as an information
technology (IT) tool and is implementing wireless for direct patient care. One hospital
chain runs a patient-monitoring application at its 23 medical facilities. Using a wire-
less local area network (WLAN), data from infusion pumps (portable devices that are
used to administer medications intravenously) is transmitted wirelessly to the patient
information system. This system can remotely monitor how much of a drug the
patient has received and compare it against standards for the correct dosage. If an
incorrect amount is being delivered, an alarm is activated. This wireless application
costs $3 million to implement.
Another
use
of
wireless
in
the
health-care
field
involves
wireless
cardiac-
monitoring tools. In the past, a patient was attached by cables to a recording device
that typically recorded only two or three days’ worth of heart data. Now wireless sen-
sors, attached to a patient’s chest, can transmit remote data (called telemetry) in real
time. This data can include heart rhythms, body temperature, and blood-oxygen
levels. The wireless system can detect any heart irregularities and immediately alert
cardiac technicians. The wireless sensors can even indicate body position, such as
whether the patient is standing or lying down. The data is transmitted through a spe-
cial Bluetooth device connected to a cellular phone. For up to 21 days, these wireless
sensors capture data and continuously send it to a call center. Having three weeks’
worth of data, instead of only three days’ worth, gives physicians a much broader
window of the patient’s heart rhythm and can improve diagnostic accuracy.
As helpful as these wireless devices are, the rapid proliferation of wireless medical
devices has also caused some problems. As hospitals and medical centers deploy wire-
less medical telemetry services, patient monitoring systems, two-way radios, cellular
networks, paging, public safety radio and security communications, as well as WLAN
visitor hotspots, the wireless airwaves are becoming crowded and can interfere with
each other. To help hospitals simplify their multiple wireless systems, several consulting
companies are now available to assist in simplifying the wireless networks’ installation,
maintenance, control, and management to harmonize them into a more universal
health-care wireless network.

As you read in Chapter 1, wireless networks can be divided into four broad categories:
wireless personal area networks (WPANs), wireless local area networks (WLANs), wireless
metropolitan area networks (WMANs), and wireless wide area networks (WWANs). Argu-
ably, the catalyst for today’s wireless data revolution is WLANs. These networks are designed
to replace or supplement a wired local area network (LAN). Devices such as laptop compu-
ters, smartphones, printers, and game consoles that are within 350 feet (107 meters) of each
other or a centrally located connection device can send and receive information at transmis-
sion speeds that typically range from 1 Mbps (million bits per second) up to 600 Mbps.
In this chapter you will be introduced to WLANs in detail. First you will learn about the
importance of standards and then explore the various WLAN standards. Next, you will inves-
tigate the various devices that allow a wireless client to be part of a wireless network. Finally,
you will study the various wireless devices that make up a WLAN infrastructure.
Understanding Standards
A standard may be thought of as a model that is used for comparison. Much of the world
today is based on standards. The size of a sheet of notebook paper, the shape of a light bulb
socket, and the physical dimensions of a DVD are all specified by recognized standards. Stan-
dards make it easier for users to purchase and use a wide variety of products. Because all
DVDs are the same size, a user can purchase a disc from virtually anywhere and be confident
that it will function in her DVD player at home. Standards continue to be needed today, par-
ticularly in the field of IT. There are also different sources for standards.
The Need for Standards
In the early years of the microcomputer industry, there were virtually no standards; vendors
developed their own equipment based on what they considered to be most useful. This
resulted in a fragmented market. Users were generally reluctant to purchase hardware or
software knowing that it might only function on a single device and could not be inter-
changeable. However, when computers entered the mainstream and were more widely uti-
lized, standards became much more important.
It is argued that because IT is a complex field, it is particularly depen-
dent on standards to stabilize technology, which in turn encourages
investment and growth. Because the size of a DVD is standardized,
multiple vendors can willingly manufacture and market DVD players,
knowing that they have a chance to capture a share of the market
and profit from the venture.
Standards have many advantages. These include:
●
Interoperability. Standards ensure that devices from one vendor will function with
those from other vendors. Devices that are not based on standards often cannot inter-
operate with similar devices from other vendors.
●
Competition. Standards serve to create competition. If a vendor creates a new device
without regard to current standards, then it automatically owns the specifications for
the device; the vendor might even take out a patent on the device. This makes it virtu-
ally impossible for another vendor to produce the same device; thus, competition

among multiple vendors selling the same device is impossible. From the point of view of
the consumer, standards are desirable because they encourage competition. Any vendor
can create a device based on a recognized standard. In order to compete, vendors will
add additional features to their products, thus increasing the overall value for users.
●
Lower costs. Competition results in lower costs for both users and manufacturers.
When several vendors make similar products based on the same standards, they com-
pete against each other on the price, which in turn makes the product less expensive
for users. Competition also results in lower costs for manufacturers. Because standards
have been established, manufacturers do not need to invest large amounts of capital in
research and development. This reduces start-up costs as well as the amount of time
required to bring a product to market. Also, manufacturing to standards encourages
manufacturers to deploy mass-production techniques and economies of scale to keep
production costs low, with savings that in turn are passed on to users.
●
Protection. Standards help protect the user’s investment in equipment. It is not uncommon
for a proprietary vendor to phase out a product line, leaving a business that purchased the
equipment with two choices: continue to use the now-obsolete system with escalating costs
for supplies and technical support, or discard the legacy system and buy a new system. Both
choices are costly. Standards, however, can help create a migration path for equipment
upgrades. Newer standards are generally backward compatible or at least provide a means
of migrating to equipment based on the newer standards at a minimal cost.
Sources of Standards
There are essentially three sources of standards:
●
De facto standards. De facto (from Latin meaning from the fact) standards are not
actually standards. Rather, they are common practices that the industry follows for var-
ious reasons (such as ease of use, tradition, or what the majority of users choose to do).
For the most part, de facto standards are established by success in the marketplace.
An example of a de facto standard is the Microsoft Windows operat-
ing system for most personal desktop computers. Because the major-
ity of users have elected to run Windows on their computers it is
considered the standard desktop operating system.
●
De jure standards. De jure (from Latin meaning from the law) standards are official
standards. De jure standards are those that are controlled by an organization or body
that has been entrusted with that task.
De facto standards sometimes become de jure standards after being
approved by a committee. Ethernet is one example of a de facto
standard that later became a de jure standard.
●
Consortia-created standards. One of the complaints against de jure standards is the
amount of time it takes for a standard to be completed. In reaction to this, consortia
sometimes take on the task of creating standards. Consortia are usually industry-sponsored
organizations that want to promote a specific technology. The goal of consortia is to
develop a standard that promotes a specific technology in a short period of time.

One reason WLANs have been so successful is that, from the outset, they have been based on
de jure standards. If WLAN technology had been based on de facto standards, different ven-
dors would have developed competing wireless technologies. They would then have been
forced to battle in the marketplace to win the hearts and minds of consumers. The resulting
confusion could have easily alienated consumers, while the need for each vendor to invest in
its own research and development would certainly have slowed the spread of wireless. Instead,
the de jure standards for WLAN helped to fuel the rapid growth of WLANs.
WLAN standards are set by the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). There
currently is one wireless LAN standard, IEEE 802.11-2007, and one significant amendment,
802.11n-2009.
The Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE) is covered
in Chapter 1.
IEEE 802.11-2007
Since the late 1990s, the IEEE has approved four standards for wireless LANs—IEEE 802.11,
802.11b, 802.11a, and 802.11g—along with several amendments (such as IEEE 802.11d, IEEE
802.11h, and so on). In order to reduce the confusion of this alphabet soup of standards,
amendments, and the year in which it was ratified, in 2007 the IEEE combined the standards
and amendments into a single standard officially known as IEEE 802.11-2007, or the IEEE

In addition, this single standard specifies technical corrections and clarifications to the origi-
nal 802.11 standard, as well as enhancements for improved security, vendor-specific exten-
sions, and interpretations.
The IEEE 802.11-2007 document, which is 1,232 pages long, is avail-
able as a free download from the IEEE Web site.
The four standards for wireless LANs are IEEE 802.11, 802.11b, 802.11a, and 802.11g.
Although the IEEE has officially retired the 802.11, 802.11b,
802.11a, and 802.11g standards and rolled them into the IEEE
802.11-2007
standard,

IEEE 802.11 In 1990 the IEEE formed a working group (WG) to develop a standard for
WLANs operating at 1 and 2 Mbps. The WG recommended several different proposals
before developing a draft. This draft went through seven different revisions that took seven
years to complete. On June 26, 1997 the IEEE approved the final draft known as IEEE
802.11. The IEEE 802.11 standard specified that wireless transmissions could occur in one
of two ways—via infrared light or radio waves.
One of the transmission options is through using infrared light. All the different types of
light that travel from the sun to the earth make up the light spectrum, which is composed
of both visible and invisible light. Although invisible, infrared light is next to visible light
on the light spectrum and shares many of the same characteristics.
Some of the other energies of the spectrum that are invisible to the
human eye include X-rays, ultraviolet rays, and microwaves.
Infrared transmissions send data by the intensity of the infrared light wave instead of turn-
ing the light off and on. To transmit a 1 an emitter (a device that transmits a signal)
increases the intensity of the current and sends a pulse using infrared light. On the receiving

end a detector (a device that receives a signal) senses the higher intensity pulse of light and
produces a proportional electrical current.
Infrared transmissions can be either directed or diffused. A directed transmission requires that
the emitter and detector be directly aimed at one another in a line of sight (LoS) path, as shown
in Figure 2-1. A diffused transmission relies on reflected light. The emitters on diffused transmis-
sions have a wide-focused beam instead of a narrow beam and are pointed at the room’s ceiling,
which serves as the reflection point. When the emitter transmits an infrared signal, the signal
bounces off the ceiling, expanding (called diffusing) to filling the room. The detectors—pointed
at the same reflection point—can then pick up the reflected signal, as shown in Figure 2-2.
Infrared wireless systems have significant limitations, which are listed in Table 2-1. Because
of these limitations, 802.11 infrared WLAN systems were never widely adopted.

The other form of transmission approved in the IEEE 802.11 standard is radio waves.
Unlike infrared light, radio waves can penetrate objects like walls and allow the wireless
user to be mobile. In addition, radio waves travel longer distances and can be used outdoors
as well as indoors. Finally, radio waves can travel at much higher speeds than infrared
transmissions. The use of radio waves in transmissions has become the preferred method
for wireless LANs.
How radio waves actually carry data signals is covered in Chapter 3.
IEEE 802.11b Although a speed of 2 Mbps was considered adequate when work on the
802.11 standard was begun in 1990, by the time the standard was completed in 1997, a 2 Mbps
wireless network proved to be too slow. The IEEE body revisited the 802.11 standard shortly after
it was released to determine what changes could be made to increase the speed. In September 1999
a new IEEE 802.11b amendment was added to the standard, which added two higher speeds,
5.5 Mbps and 11 Mbps, to the original 802.11 standard of 1 Mbps and 2 Mbps.
The 802.11b standard supports wireless devices (officially known as a station or STA) that are
up to 350 feet (107 meters) apart. However, as wireless devices are moved farther apart, the
rate at which the data is transmitted between devices will decrease. This is because radio waves
decrease in power over distance, much like the sound of the human voice: someone standing
3 feet (1 meter) away from a person who is speaking at a normal volume would typically be
able to hear the sound very clearly, whereas a person 100 feet (30 meters) away would likely
have difficulty hearing. When a mobile wireless device moves farther away from the transmitter,
the 802.11b standard specifies that the device decrease its rates to the next lower acceptable
level (from 11 Mbps down to 5.5, 2, or 1 Mbps) instead of completely dropping the connection.
This allows distant devices to remain connected, albeit at slower speeds.
Limitation
Explanation
Lack of mobility
Directed infrared wireless systems require an obstruction-free line of sight path
between the emitter and the detector. This makes it unusable for mobile
applications, in which the alignment between the emitter and the detector must
be continuously adjusted.
Limited range
A directed infrared system, which requires a line-of-sight path, cannot be placed
in an environment in which an obstruction could interfere with the infrared
beam. Due to the angle of deflection, diffused infrared can only cover a range of
about 50 feet (15 meters).
Confined to indoor
use
Bright sunlight can affect an infrared signal, making wireless infrared LANs
unreliable outdoors.
Slow transmission
speed
Diffused infrared can send data at speeds no higher than 4 Mbps because the
wide angle of the beam loses energy as it reflects.

Other factors that have an impact on the speed of transmissions include the number of wire-
less devices in the network and the type of obstructions between devices. Generally, two
terms are used for measuring wireless network speeds:
●
Data rate. The data rate is the theoretical maximum rated speed of a network. For
example, the data rate for IEEE 802.11b is 11 Mbps. However, the data rate is only
theoretical. Due to a variety of factors, a network rarely achieves its stated data rate.
●
Throughput. Throughput is the measure of how much actual data can be sent per unit
of time across a network. Throughput is often used to measure the amount of data
actually sent across a network in a real world setting. If two 802.11 devices are 30 feet
(10 meters) apart, the throughput may only be 5.5 Mbps.
IEEE 802.11a At the same time the IEEE created the 802.11b standard, it also issued
another standard with even higher speeds. The IEEE 802.11a standard specifies a maximum
rated speed of 54 Mbps and also supports 48, 36, 24, 18, 12, 9, and 6 Mbps transmissions
using a different set of radio wave frequencies than 802.11b. Even though the 802.11a and
802.11b specifications were published at the same time by the IEEE in 1999, 802.11b pro-
ducts started to appear almost immediately, while 802.11a products did not arrive until
late 2001. The 802.11a products came to the market later because of technical issues and
because of the high cost of developing products for the standard. Devices based on the
802.11a standard cannot use complementary metal oxide semiconductor (CMOS), which is
the semiconductor used in 802.11b WLANs. Instead, they must use a compound such as
gallium arsenide (GaAs) or silicon germanium (SiGe). These semiconductors are more
expensive and require more capital investment and time to develop and manufacture.
Although the 802.11a standard achieves higher speed, the trade-off is that devices cannot be
as far apart as with the 802.11b standard. In a 802.11a wireless network, devices can typi-
cally be no more than 100 feet (30 meters) apart.
IEEE 802.11g The success of the IEEE 802.11b standard prompted the IEEE to re-examine
the 802.11b and 802.11a standards to determine if a third intermediate standard could be
developed. This "best of both worlds" approach would preserve the stable and widely
accepted features of 802.11b, but increase the data transfer rates to those similar to 802.11a.
The IEEE formed a task group (TG) to explore this possibility; by late 2001 a draft standard,
known as IEEE 802.11g, was proposed. This standard was formally ratified in 2003.
The IEEE 802.11g draft was a compromise based on input from several
different chip (microprocessor) manufacturers, who had a major stake in
the outcome. Although most major commercial wireless networking
product vendors will build and sell products based upon whatever
standard is approved, the stakes are much higher for the chip manu-
facturers. These businesses must make huge monetary investments in designing, sampling,
and manufacturing the silicon chips used in the wireless network products. They must then
try to sell their chips to product vendors that design and build commercial products based on
those chips.
The 802.11g standard supports a maximum data speed of 54 Mbps, with lesser speeds of
48, 36, 24, 18, 12, 9, and 6 Mbps. The standard also specifies that devices operate in the
same radio frequency as IEEE 802.11b and not the frequency used by 802.11a. This gives

Like 802.11b, 802.11g can support devices that are up to 350 feet (107 meters) apart.
Because 802.11g shares many of the same features as 802.11b, most WLAN equipment
allows both 802.11g and 802.11b wireless devices to function together in the same 802.11g
wireless network. This is done by configuring the 802.11g network settings to different
“modes” based on the different IEEE standards. The configuration options for using devices
from these two standards in the same wireless network are listed in Table 2-2.
IEEE 802.11n-2009
In September 2004, the IEEE formed Task Group n (TGn) to begin work on a dramatically
new WLAN standard that would significantly increase the speed, range, and reliability of
wireless local area networks. Known as IEEE 802.11n-2009 (or 802.11n), this standard was
intended to usher in the next generation of WLAN technology. The final 802.11n standard,
based on 802.11n Draft 9, was ratified on September 11, 2009 exactly five years to the day
after TGn first started its work. The official name of the standard is 802.11n-2009 IEEE

The 802.11n standard has four significant improvements over previous standards:
●
Speed. A data rate of up to 600 Mbps
●
Coverage area. Double the indoor range and triple the outdoor range
●
Interference. Uses different frequencies to reduce interference

TGn initially evaluated 62 different proposals for the wireless tech-
nology that would form the basis of 802.11n.
Although it was originally estimated that 802.11n would be ratified by 2006, the process
took much longer than first anticipated. This delay caused vendors to introduce products
that were not strictly based on the IEEE standards. From 2004 until 2007, several vendors
introduced “Pre-n” devices. These were based on each vendor’s implementation of the

proposed standards and were often incompatible with other vendor’s products. In June 2007,
the Wi-Fi Alliance began certifying vendor products based on Draft 2 of 802.11n. It was
anticipated that products based on the final 802.11n standard would be backward compati-
ble with Draft 2.0 devices. The Wi-Fi Alliance certified over 500 of these products including
more than 80 enterprise products in just two years.
The official Wi-Fi statement regarding Draft 2.0 devices is, “Wi-Fi cer-
tified n products must be backward compatible [with Draft 2.0

3.3.2. Describe the purpose of WLAN client devices and explain how
to install, configure, secure, and manage them.
There are different types of hardware and software that can be used on the wireless client so
that the device can use the wireless network. These can be divided into wireless client network
interface cards and the client utility software to support the hardware.
Wireless Client Network Interface Card
The hardware that a desktop or laptop client computer needs to send and receive data on a
wired network is called a network interface card (NIC) or client network adapter. Early
NICs were separate cards that had one edge connected to the expansion slot of the computer’s
bus (the subsystem for transferring data between the system’s components), while the RJ-45
connection on the other end provided access for a cable connection, as illustrated in Figure 2-3.

Today’s computers typically have NIC components built directly into the motherboard, so
that only the RJ-45 connection is externally exposed. The cable connects the NIC to the net-
work, thus establishing the link between the computer and the wired network.
A wireless client network interface card adapter performs the same functions as a wired NIC
with one major exception: there is no external cable RJ-45 connection. In its place is an
antenna (sometimes embedded into the adapter) designed to send and receive signals through
the airwaves.
Wireless NICs come in a variety of shapes and styles. These can be categorized into wireless
NIC devices for desktop computers and for portable devices.
Today wireless NICs are no longer found only in computing devices
like desktops, laptops, and tablets. One vendor offers an external
hard drive with a built-in wireless NIC so that multimedia files such
as movies, music, and photos can be stored and then streamed to
and from computers. This is particularly useful for tablets that may
have limited storage space.
Cards for Desktops On desktop computers, early wireless NICs, like the one shown
in Figure 2-4, plugged into an internal expansion slot inside the computer. These have
generally been replaced with external wireless NICs that plug into the Universal Serial Bus
(USB) port. Such a USB NIC can be either a stand-alone device connected by a USB cable
(Figure 2-5) or a key fob (Figure 2-6).

The advantage of a stand-alone USB device over a key fob is that the
stand-alone USB device can be repositioned to improve reception.
However, some USB key fobs provide the best of both worlds: they
can be inserted directly into the computer’s USB port or into a small
stand that is connected by a cable to the USB port. This allows for
the stand (and key fob) to be moved to improve reception.
More recently, as wireless networks have become the standard for network communication,
more desktop computers are shipping with wireless NICs as standard equipment along with
a wired NIC. This allows the desktop device to connect to either the wired network or to a
wireless network.
Cards for Portable Devices Unlike tablet devices that generally only have an internal
wireless NIC as standard equipment, portable laptop computers often can support wireless
NICs in different form factors (that is, in different sizes and shapes). These form factors
include large form factor devices, small form factor devices, and internal devices.
Large Form Factor Cards A credit card-sized peripheral that slides into a slot on a laptop
computer can add additional functionality to the laptop, much like a card can be inserted
into the bus expansion slot on a desktop computer. Originally these cards were known as
PCMCIA (Personal Computer Memory Card International Association) cards, and later the
name was changed to PC Card.
“PCMCIA” refers to a now-dissolved nonprofit trade association and
standards body that promoted the technology.
The PC Card standard defines three form factors for three types of PC Cards. All three
card types are the same length and width and use the same 68-pin connector. The cards
only differ in their thickness. Table 2-3 lists the dimensions and typical uses of different
PC Cards.
Laptops in the 1990s usually were configured with two PC Card Type
II slots with no barrier in between them. This allowed for the installa-
tion of either two Type II cards or one Type III card. Today laptops
often have a single Type II slot, while smaller netbooks or tablets
have no PC Card slots at all.

An enhanced type of PC Card is the CardBus. CardBus is a 32-bit bus in the PC Card form
factor. CardBus also includes a bus mastering feature, which allows a controller on the bus
to talk to other devices or memory without going through the CPU.
A notch on the left front of a CardBus device prevents it from being
inserted into a slot that can only accept PC Cards. Most new slots
are compatible with both CardBus and the PC Card devices.
Today PC Card and CardBus devices are being replaced by ExpressCard technology.
ExpressCard is designed to deliver higher-performance modular expansion in a smaller size.
There are two standard ExpressCard form factors: the ExpressCard/34 module (34 mm 
75 mm) and the ExpressCard/54 module (54 mm  75 mm). Both formats are 5 mm thick
(the same as the Type II PC Card) yet 10.6 mm shorter than a PC Card.
Wireless NICs for laptops are available as Type II PC Cards, CardBus, and ExpressCards.
Figure 2-7 illustrates an ExpressCard wireless NIC.
Small Form Factor Cards CompactFlash (CF) is small form factor (43  36  3.3 mm
for Type I, and 43  36  5 mm for Type II) that is generally used as a mass storage device
format for portable electronic devices. CF was used as a storage medium for digital cameras
for several years, although it is being replaced by smaller cards. CF wireless NICs were
primarily designed for use in personal digital assistant (PDA) devices. However, as PDAs
have been replaced by smartphones, CF wireless NICs are no longer as popular as they
once were.
The portion of the CF device containing the antenna protrudes from
the PDA for improved reception.
Similar to CF, a Secure Digital (SD) card is another small form factor (32 mm  24 mm 
2.1 mm) that started as a portable storage device for digital cameras and PDAs. A variation
of an SD card is a Secure Digital Input Output (SDIO) device, which is a combination of an

SD card and an input/output (I/O) device such as a wireless NIC. Like CF, SDIO devices
were primarily designed for use in PDA devices.
A variation of the SDIO is an SD card that is a combination of a wire-
less NIC and storage. Once inserted into a digital camera, this type of
SD card can wirelessly transmit pictures across the network to a desk-
top or laptop’s hard disk drive or to a wireless printer.
Internal Cards Desktop computers typically have one or more Peripheral Component
Interconnect (PCI) expansion slot inside the computer to make it possible to add devices to
the system. PCI expansion slots are being replaced with PCI Express (PCI-e). PCI-e has a
high-speed point-to-point serial bus replacement of the older shared parallel PCI bus
architecture.
Because of their smaller size, laptop computers do not have full-size PCI or PCI-e slots.
Instead, they have Mini-PCI slots or Mini-PCI-e slots that accept Mini-PCI or Mini-PCI-e
cards or cards that are half the length of a Mini-PCI-e card (called a Half Mini PCIe card).
Most laptop computers today come with a wireless Mini-PCI or Mini-PCI-e network inter-
face card installed. These can be exposed by removing the access panels on the underside of
the laptop, as shown in Figure 2-8. Tablet computers have a similar type of hardware. Some
vendors have enhanced the slot by embedding an antenna in the case of the laptop that sur-
rounds the screen. When a wireless NIC Mini-PCI or Mini-PCI-e card is used, it automati-
cally activates the antenna to improve the reception of the wireless signal.
Mini-PCI was specifically developed for integrating communications
peripherals such as modems and NICs onto a laptop computer.

Client Utility Software
The software that interfaces between the wireless NIC and the computer can be part of the
operating system or a separate third-party utility program. Microsoft Windows XP first intro-
duced the Wireless Zero Configuration (WZC) service. WZC is a wireless connection manage-
ment utility that operates as a Windows service and interacts with the client hardware NIC
drivers. WZC automatically determines which wireless network to connect to based on default
settings and preferences set by the user. This tool had security weaknesses and limited function-
ality. In Microsoft Vista and Microsoft Windows 7, it was replaced with WLAN AutoConfig.
Manufacturer third-party utility programs are generally included with the purchase of a wire-
less NIC client and are often specific to that device. Other client utility software programs are
generic and work with wireless NICs from different vendors.

4.3.2. Powering HT (802.11n) devices.
Whereas the hardware and software for a wireless device is essentially limited to the wireless
network interface card adapter and the client utility software, there are a number of wireless
hardware devices that can be used to create the wireless network infrastructure. These include
access points, WLAN bridges, gateways, and Power over Ethernet devices.
Access Points (APs)
An access point (AP), shown in Figure 2-9, consists of three major parts:
●
An antenna and a radio transmitter/receiver to send and receive wireless signals
●
Special bridging software to interface wireless devices to other devices
●
A wired network interface that allows it to connect by cable to a standard wired network
An AP has two basic functions. First, it acts as the base station for the wireless network. Any
device with a wireless NIC transmits its signal to an AP, which can then redirect the signal, if
necessary, to other wireless devices. The second function of an AP is to act as a bridge
between the wireless and wired networks. The AP can be connected to the wired network
by a cable, allowing all the wireless devices to access through the AP to the wired network
(and vice versa), as shown in Figure 2-10.
The number of wireless clients that a single AP can support varies. In
theory, some types of APs can support over 100 wireless clients. How-
ever, because the radio signal is shared among users, generally one AP
for a maximum of 40 wireless users may be acceptable if they are per-
forming basic e-mail, light Web surfing, and occasionally transferring
small-sized files. If the users are performing more intense network access and transferring large
files, a smaller ratio is necessary.

There are three categories of APs: autonomous access points, lightweight access points, and
mesh router access points.
Autonomous Access Points Standard APs are known as autonomous access points.
These devices are considered autonomous, or independent, because they are separate from
other network devices and even other autonomous access points. Autonomous access points
have the intelligence required to manage wireless authentication, encryption, and other func-
tions for the wireless client devices that they serve. Because everything is self-contained in
these single devices they are also called fat access points.
Lightweight Access Points Although autonomous access points are adequate for a
home or a small office home office (SOHO) setting in which there may be one or two APs,
what happens in a large enterprise or college campus where there can be hundreds of APs? In
this case autonomous access points are not a viable option. Because each AP is autonomous, a
single wireless network configuration change would require that they be reconfigured individ-
ually, which can take an extended period of time and manpower to complete.
Lightweight access points, also called thin access points, can be a better option. A light-
weight access point does not contain the management and configuration functions found in
autonomous access points; instead, these features are contained in a central device known as
a wireless LAN controller (WLC), or wireless switch. The WLC is the single device that can
be configured and then these settings are automatically distributed to all lightweight access
points (a remote office WLAN controller is used to manage multiple WLCs at remote sites
from a central location). Lightweight access points with a WLC are shown in Figure 2-11.
Lightweight access points only have simplified radios for wireless
communication between devices and a media converter for accessing
the wired network.
Besides centralized management, lightweight access points provide other advantages over
autonomous access points. As wireless client devices move through a WLAN with multiple

autonomous access points, a lengthy handoff procedure occurs during which one autono-
mous access point transfers authentication information to another. Slow handoffs can be
unacceptable on WLAN systems using time-dependent communication, such as voice or
video. With lightweight access points, however, the time for this handoff procedure is
reduced because all authentications are performed in the WLC. Another advantage of
WLCs are the tools that many of them provide for monitoring the environment and provid-
ing information regarding the best locations for APs, wireless configuration settings, and
power settings.
Yet lightweight access points have some disadvantages. WLCs still do not provide true con-
vergence (integration) of the wired and wireless networks, but only ease some of the man-
agement burdens of WLANs. In addition, these devices are proprietary, which means all
the lightweight access points and WLCs on a network must be from the same vendor in
order to function cohesively.
Mesh Access Points Consider a college that wants to provide wireless access to stu-
dents throughout the entire campus. Installing APs inside buildings makes it possible to
take advantage of the existing campus’s wired network infrastructure. Any AP installed
inside a building can be connected to the wired network. However, what about locating
APs outside of buildings to provide wireless access in outdoor areas? This would require a
costly installation of cables to each AP that would involve digging trenches, burying net-
work cable in conduit, and connecting a cable individually to each AP. Because each AP
must individually be connected to the wired network infrastructure it can result in high
costs when providing coverage in areas where a wired connection is not readily available.
A solution is to use a mesh access point, which does not have to be individually connected
by a cable to the existing wired network. Instead, each mesh access point communicates
wirelessly with the next closest mesh access point. Dozens—or even hundreds—of mesh
access points can communicate between themselves to create a wireless mesh network
(WMN). Only one mesh access point must be physically connected to the wired network;
all the other mesh access points transparently connect, or hop, through each other to reach
the mesh access point with the wired connection. This arrangement allows for multiple inter-
connected paths through which the signal can reach the mesh access point that is connected
to the wired network. Figure 2-12 illustrates a WMN.
Because mesh access points function in a similar manner to routers in directing traffic along
the best traffic path, these devices are sometimes called wireless mesh routers or mesh access
points/routers. A WMN that connects mesh access points for the purpose of sharing an
Internet connection is also known as a backhaul wireless mesh network. These mesh net-
works provide alternative data paths for the backside connection to the Internet.
The original IEEE 802.11 standard included an option for a wireless
distribution system (WDS) that interconnected two APs wirelessly.
However, it was never widely implemented.
Another type of wireless mesh network is an ad hoc wireless mesh network. Instead of mesh
access points communicating with each other, wireless client devices like laptop computers
act as the relay station for signals to and from the AP, with the signal hopping through the
wireless clients.

There are several advantages to using mesh access points to create a WMN:
●
Low-cost installation. The cost for installing a WMN is reduced because only a single
mesh AP must be physically connected to the wired network.
●
Large coverage area. A WMN can cover large areas with multiple mesh access points.
●
Easy-to-change coverage area. The coverage area of a WMN can be easily expanded
or contracted by adding or reducing the number of mesh access points.
●
Can be installed in areas without wired infrastructure. Warehouses, outdoor concert
venues, and even trains can have wireless access without a wired network.
●
Self-configuring WMN. Once a mesh access point is added to the WMN, the network
automatically adds the new AP to the existing mesh without needing any special adjustments.

●
Self-healing WMN. If a mesh access point fails, the other mesh access points can take
advantage of the remaining network paths to automatically bypass the failed node.
This is possible because there are multiple paths in the network.
●
Fast installation. WMNs can be installed quickly. WMNs have been used extensively
in the aftermath of the hurricanes and other natural disasters to provide immediate
communication facilities for rescue personnel.
Currently no standards exist for WMNs. The IEEE 802.11 TG subgroup “s” started work
on developing standards in 2003 and is still working on the project. In the interim, over 70
competing WMN routing protocols are available. These protocols differ over:
●
Algorithm. The routing algorithm should attempt to ensure that the data takes the
most appropriate (fastest) route to its destination. The various protocols all use differ-
ent routing algorithms.
●
Management data vs. transmit data. Wireless mesh routers in a WMN receive two
types of data from other devices: management data and transmit data. In order to
implement dynamic routing capabilities, each wireless mesh router must constantly
communicate its own routing information to every other wireless mesh router
within its area. This information is known as management data. Devices also con-
tinually receive data from client devices that they need to pass on. This informa-
tion is known as transmit data. A wireless mesh access point must quickly deter-
mine what it should do with the data it receives. It needs to keep management data
for reference and not pass it on. When it receives transmit data, it needs to use the
information about nearby access points contained in the management data to pass
the transmit data on to its neighbor. Different protocols implement these techni-
ques differently.
●
Number of radios. Unlike some WLANs (such as 802.11a/b/g) in which only one radio
is used, many wireless mesh networks use multiple radios. This helps to separate the
tasks of managing management data and transmit data.
The competing WMN routing protocols range from well-known pro-
tocols such as OSPF (Open Shortest Path First) to lesser-known
protocols such as BATMAN (Better Approach to Mobile Adhoc
Networking).
WLAN Bridges
A bridge is a device that is used to connect two network segments, even if those segments use
different types of physical media (such as wired and wireless connections). There are two
types of wireless LAN bridges. A wireless workgroup bridge is used to connect a wired net-
work segment to a wireless network segment, as illustrated in Figure 2-13. The wired devices
connect through the wireless workgroup bridge to an access point, which then connects to
the wired backbone network. A wireless workgroup bridge only supports the wired devices
and not any other wireless devices (that is, it does not function as an access point).
Wireless bridges are also available to connect a single wired device
to the wireless network. These are popular for consumer home
users. For example, a wireless bridge can be attached to a standard
laser printer to turn it into a wireless networked printer.

Whereas a wireless workgroup bridge connects wireless devices on a network segment that
are in relatively close proximity (a workgroup) such as in a room or on the floor of an office
building, a remote wireless bridge connects two or more networks together that are sepa-
rated by a longer distance. Remote wireless bridges are commonly used to connect networks
(either wired or wireless networks) between different buildings. Remote wireless bridges have
significant differences from APs or wireless workgroup bridges. These differences include:
●
Increased power. Remote wireless bridges transmit at higher power than APs. This
enables them to transmit over longer distances.
●
Directional antenna. While an AP has an antenna that sends out its signal in all direc-
tions, a remote wireless bridge generally uses a directional antenna to focus the trans-
mission in a single path, significantly increasing the distance that it can transmit.
●
Special software. A remote wireless bridge contains special software for transmitting
and receiving signals. For example, this software can enable a wireless bridge to avoid
interference by selecting the clearest transmission channel.
Remote wireless bridges support two types of connections, point-to-point and point-
to-multipoint. In a point-to-point (PtP) configuration, two buildings are connected, as
shown in Figure 2-14. In a point-to-multipoint (PtMP) configuration, multiple buildings are
connected, as shown in Figure 2-15.

A remote wireless bridge can function in one of four different modes:
●
Root mode. In root mode, a remote wireless bridge can communicate only with other
bridges that are not in root mode. When in root mode, the remote wireless bridge is
called a root bridge. There must be one (and only one) root bridge in a PtP or PtMP
configuration, and it cannot communicate with another root bridge or a wireless client.
●
Nonroot mode. In nonroot mode, a remote wireless bridge can transmit only to a
bridge that is in root mode. Although some remote wireless bridges in nonroot mode
can also be configured as an AP to simultaneously communicate with a remote wire-
less root bridge and wireless clients, this is discouraged for security purposes.

●
Repeater mode. In order to enhance the signal strength between buildings, another
remote wireless bridge may be positioned between two other bridges. This bridge then
functions in repeater mode.
●
Access point mode. In access point mode, a remote wireless bridge functions as a nor-
mal AP only and does not communicate with other remote wireless bridges; instead, it
only communicates with wireless client devices such as laptop computers.
Remote wireless bridges are a cost-effective alternative to expensive leased wired options for
connecting remote buildings. Remote wireless bridges can connect sites such as satellite
offices, remote campus settings, or temporary office locations when the sites are separated
by obstacles such as bodies of water, freeways, or railroads that make using a wired connec-
tion impractical or very expensive.
The speed of remote wireless bridges and the distance over which they
can transmit depend primarily on the number of obstacles in the trans-
mission path. A path with many obstacles is called a non-line-of-sight,
or non-LoS path. One with few obstacles is called a near-LoS path,
and one with no obstacles is called a line-of-site, or LoS path. In a
non-LoS setting, the buildings can be up to 6 miles (10 km) apart, in near-LoS they can be
up to 25 miles (40 km) apart, and in a LoS setting they can be up to 124 miles (200 km)
apart. The data speeds can vary between 7 Mbps to 150 Mbps depending upon the distance
and obstacles.
Gateways
A gateway is a network device that acts as an entrance to another network. There are two
types of gateways in wireless networks, Enterprise Encryption Gateways and residential
WLAN gateways.
Enterprise Encryption Gateway (EEG) An Enterprise Encryption Gateway (EEG)
provides encryption and authentication services for a wireless network. An EEG typically
resides between the wireless network and the wired network and serves as the entry point
to the wired network, as illustrated in Figure 2-16. The purpose of an EEG is to relieve an
AP from the burden of encryption and authentication. Traffic leaving the backbone travels
through the EEG where it is encrypted before going out to the WLAN. The EEG also serves
the reverse function, decrypting traffic as it arrives from the WLAN. The EEG can even
authenticate devices on the WLAN and approve or deny their access into the wireless
network.
EEGs have largely been replaced by WLCs using lightweight access
points.
Residential WLAN Gateway A single wireless hardware network device for SOHO
or home use typically combines multiple features into a single hardware device. These fea-
tures often include those of an AP, firewall, router, dynamic host configuration protocol
(DHCP) server, and other features. Strictly speaking these devices are residential WLAN

gateways as they are the entry point into the wireless network from the Internet. However,
most vendors instead choose to label their products as “wireless broadband routers.”
Recent developments in hardware devices that serve as residential WLAN gateways are com-
plemented by new software functions that simplify the management and functionality of
these devices. For example, Windows 7 added two significant wireless functions to its oper-
ating system. One function, Windows Connect Now, or WCN, is a solution for home net-
working and SOHOs. (WCN is not intended for enterprises.) A Windows 7 computer can
scan the airwaves for a newly installed WCN capable device, such as an AP. When the
device is detected, the user can simply enter a personal identification number (PIN) from
the hardware device, as shown in Figure 2-17. The user can then take advantage of a Windows
Wizard that steps through the process of creating the wireless network configurations—including
security—and that can also transmit these settings wirelessly back to the AP to configure it.
These configuration settings can even be stored on a USB flash drive and used to easily config-
ure other computers without the need to enter the information manually.
In addition to APs, WCN allows a range of mobile and embedded
devices to exchange settings with one another.
The second wireless function added to Microsoft Windows 7 is the wireless Hosted Net-
work. This feature has two parts: the virtualization of the physical wireless NIC into

multiple virtual wireless NICs (called Virtual WiFi) and a software-based wireless access
point (SoftAP) that uses a designated virtual wireless NIC. The wireless Hosted Network
allows users to extend the functionality of their portable laptop computer. For example, a
user could set up her computer to create a wireless network so that other users can quickly
share documents wirelessly between multiple computers. Another function allows a laptop’s
network connection to be shared by other computers and devices. For example, a user could
connect her computer to the Internet and then turn her computer into an AP that shares the
Internet connection with other wireless laptop devices, much like a hardware AP.
A network created via Windows 7’s wireless Hosted Network is not
the same as an ad hoc wireless mesh network, in which wireless cli-
ent devices relay signals from one laptop to another. Instead, all of
the mobile devices in a wireless Hosted Network all connect directly
back to the laptop running the Virtual WiFi and SoftAP.
Power over Ethernet (PoE) Devices
Access points are typically mounted on a ceiling or a similar area high off the ground to reduce
interference from surrounding objects. However, electrical power outlets are generally not found
in these locations. In such cases Power over Ethernet (PoE) can be used. Instead of receiving
power directly from an alternating current (AC) electrical outlet, direct current (DC) power is
delivered to the AP through the unused wires in a standard unshielded twisted pair (UTP) Ether-
net cable that connects the AP to the wired network. This eliminates the need for installing
electrical wiring and makes mounting APs more flexible. The current PoE standard is IEEE
802.3at-2009. Prior to this standard, different vendors offered their own proprietary standards.

The total amount of continuous power that can be sent to each
device using PoE is 12.95 watts. Wireless LAN access points typically
consume 3.5 to 10 watts.
There are two common approaches to providing PoE, which are illustrated in Figure 2-18.
These include:
●
PoE-enabled Ethernet switch. A PoE-enabled Ethernet switch can contain embedded
PoE technology, called power sourcing equipment, or PSE, that provides both electrical
power and data. Nothing more must be done other than connecting the device to the
switch with an Ethernet cable. End devices that can support PoE send the switch an
authenticated PoE signature that indicates that they do support this technology, which
helps prevent damage to other equipment. Once the switch knows that the device is
PoE compliant it sends power along one pair of unused wires in the cable. In addition,
the switch will discontinue the power when the PoE device is disconnected.

●
PoE injectors. A PoE injector is a small, inexpensive device that can inject power into
an Ethernet cable. These injectors can be endspan devices (such as a network switch
enabled to provide power on each port) or a midspan device, which is connected in-
line to each end device and adds power to the line. Using PoE injectors, a standard,
non–PoE-enabled Ethernet switch can be used to supply the data while the PoE injec-
tor provides the power. Positioned between the switch and the end device, the PoE
injector is connected to both the switch and end device. Typically PoE injectors can
provide power to a single cable (single port PoE injectors) or to multiple cables simul-
taneously (multiport PoE injectors).
Chapter Summary
■Standards are particularly important today and provide a variety of benefits. In the
field of IT, standards play a vital role by ensuring interoperability, increased competi-
tion, lower costs, and protection in investments. There are three types of standards: de
facto (which are common practices established by the marketplace), de jure (standards
controlled by an entity entrusted with that task), and consortia-based standards
(industry-sponsored organizations).
■There currently are four types of wireless LANs based on the IEEE 802.11 standard.
802.11b networks transmit at 11 Mbps over a distance of up to 350 feet (107 meters).
802.11a standard devices transmit at up to 54 Mbps but only up to 30 meters (100
feet). A compromise between the two, the 802.11g, can transmit at 54 Mbps up to
115 meters (375 feet). The 802.11n standard, ratified in 2009, can transmit as fast as
600 Mbps with significant increases in coverage area, reduced interference, and man-
datory security.
■Wireless LAN client devices are in many respects similar to those found in a wired
network. The difference is that, instead of a wired connection, wireless devices use an
antenna or other means to send and receive signals. A wireless network interface card
performs the same function as a wired NIC in that it receives signals from the net-
work. There are a variety of different types of wireless NICs: USB stand-alone or key
fob devices, CardBus, PC Card, ExpressCard, PCI, Mini-PCI, Mini-PCI-e, Compact-
Flash, and SDIO cards. The software that interfaces between the wireless NIC and the
computer can be part of the operating system or a separate third-party utility program.
■An access point (AP) serves as both the base station for the wireless network and as a
bridge to connect the wireless network with the wired network. The range of an access
point and the number of wireless clients that it can support varies. Standard APs have
all of the intelligence required for wireless authentication, encryption, and manage-
ment. A lightweight access point does not contain the management and configuration
functions that are found in autonomous access points; instead, these features are con-
tained in a central device known as a wireless LAN controller (WLC).
■A mesh access point does not have to be individually connected by a cable to the
existing wired network. Instead, each mesh access point communicates wirelessly with
the next closest mesh access point, creating a wireless mesh network (WMN). Because
mesh access points function in a similar manner to routers in directing traffic along the
best traffic path, these devices are sometimes called wireless mesh routers. A WMN

that connects mesh access points for the purpose of sharing an Internet connection is
also known as a backhaul wireless mesh network.
■A wireless workgroup bridge is used to connect a wired network segment and a wireless
network segment that are in relatively close proximity to each other, such as within a
room or the floor of a building. A remote wireless bridge connects two or more net-
works that are separated by a longer distance. This device is commonly used to connect
networks (either wired or wireless networks) that are situated in different buildings. A
remote wireless bridge can connect two buildings via a point-to-point (PtP) configura-
tion or it can connect multiple buildings via a point-to-multipoint (PtMP) configuration.
■A gateway is a device that acts as an entrance to another network. There are two types
of gateways in wireless networks. An Enterprise Encryption Gateway (EEG) provides
encryption and authentication services for a wireless network. It typically resides
between a wireless network and a wired network and serves as the entry point to the
wired network. A single wireless hardware network device for SOHO or home use
that typically combines multiple features into a single hardware device is called a resi-
dential WLAN gateway.
■Power over Ethernet (IEEE 802.3af) technology allows an AP to be positioned in
almost any location because electrical current is supplied through the Ethernet cable.

At first glance sailboats and wireless local area networks (WLANs) may seem to have
very little in common. That is, unless you’re talking about the world’s most presti-
gious sailboat racing event, in which case WLANs played a crucial rule in the recent
victory by the United States.
The America’s Cup regatta is a series of races between two yachts. This event
attracts top sailors and yacht designers because of its international prestige and his-
tory, dating as far back as 1857. The 2010 America’s Cup was held off the coast of
Valencia, Spain in February 2010 between the defending champion Alinghi 5 and the
challenger, an American multihull yacht named USA-17 from the BMW Oracle Racing
team. For this 33rd America’s Cup race, the competing teams could not agree on a set
of rules, so only the most basic guidelines were established: the boats could be as long
as 90 feet (27 meters) and the course would be 20 miles (32 kilometers) out windward
and the same distance back. Within those parameters, the ship could be designed to
run as fast as possible. And the USA-17 designers took full advantage of this freedom.
The USA-17 was considered a technical marvel. Its wing sail was over 223 feet
(68 meters) high, or almost 20 stories, and barely fit under the Golden Gate Bridge
in San Francisco. The wing was made of an aeronautical fabric that was stretched
over a carbon fiber frame, giving it a three-dimensional shape similar to that of an
airplane wing. This wing had a fixed leading edge and an adjustable trailing edge,
which allowed the USA-17 crew to continuously change the shape of the sail during
the course of a race in order to adjust for changes in the wind. With this advanced
wing and other improvements, such as encasing the hull with special drag-resistant
materials, the USA-17 could reach speeds up to 28 knots (32 miles per hour).
In order to take advantage of the ability to make constant adjustments to the sail dur-
ing the race, the USA-17 was fitted with 250 sensors to collect raw data. This data
included pressure sensors on the wing, angle sensors on the adjustable trailing edge of
the wing sail to monitor the effectiveness of each adjustment, and strain sensors on the
mast and wing to allow for maximum thrust without overextending the wing. Some sen-
sors were making measurements up to 10 times per second (in one hour of sailing almost
90 million data points were collected). Yet gathering the data during the race was just
one step. Somehow that data had to be provided to the crew members while the race
was in progress so that they could monitor the ship and make further adjustments.
That’s where WLANs came in. The helmsman, or person who steered the ship, wore a
backpack that contained a laptop computer. The USA-17’s onboard computer, located
in the main hull, would wirelessly send information to the helmsman’s laptop, which
would in turn wirelessly transmit it to both a wrist-mounted personal digital assistant
(PDA) as well as a “heads-up” display in the goggles that he wore. This display allowed

Troubleshooting is a critical skill for any information technology (IT) professional. Whether
it’s diagnosing a personal computer that will not boot or determining why a program fails to
successfully launch, knowing how to isolate, identify, and resolve hardware, software, or tele-
communications problems is essential.
A good troubleshooting skill set is particularly important when working with wireless net-
works. Whereas with a wired network the data is confined to a cable that can be tested fairly
easily for any problems, that is not the case with wireless LANs. Different types of unexpected
problems can arise when a wireless signal travels through the open airwaves. Are specific
objects blocking the signal? Is the wireless device too far away? Are there conflicts with other
wireless devices? The list goes on and on.
Good troubleshooting skills for WLANs start with an understanding of the fundamentals of
wireless transmissions. In this chapter, you will explore the basics of how wireless technology
works. You will begin by looking at the principles behind radio frequency (RF) transmissions.
Next you will study how data can be sent through wireless transmissions, and then you will
see how transmissions can be measured. Finally, you will learn about the behavior of radio
frequency transmissions and how this behavior affects WLANs.

1.3.1. Identify RF signal characteristics, the applications of basic RF
antenna concepts, and the implementation of solutions that require
RF antennas.
Understanding the principles of RF transmissions is important for both troubleshooting wire-
less LANs as well as creating a context for understanding wireless terminology. This knowl-
edge includes an understanding of what electromagnetic waves are, their characteristics, and
the electromagnetic spectrum.

him to see both graphical and numeric data through the goggles while never taking his
eyes off the sea and the boat. Each crew member was also equipped with his own
wrist-mounted wireless PDA that contained customized data for his specific job on the
ship, such as the load balance on a particular rope or the current aerodynamic perfor-
mance of the wing sail. In addition, a second ship, known as the performance tender,
accompanied the USA-17 while it was on the water. The tender served in part as a
floating datacenter and was also connected to the USA-17 by a wireless LAN.
While it’s virtually impossible to predict what new technologies will impact the
next America’s Cup race, it’s safe to say that wireless will again play a key role.

What Are Electromagnetic Waves?
Suppose you were to stand next to a campfire at night. You could see the light from the fire,
feel its heat, and hear the crackling of the logs. The light, heat, and sound from the burning
logs actually move to you through space as waves. The sound waves travel through the air as
vibrations: a vibration of an object causes the air around the object to shake and move out in
waves towards the human eardrum, which in turn vibrates. By contrast, light and heat waves
travel through space in a different way. These utilize a special form of energy known as electro-
magnetic waves. An electromagnetic wave consists of an electric field (electro) and a magnetic
field (magnetic) that are perpendicular, or at right angles, to each other, as shown in Figure 3-1.
These waves, which require no special medium for movement, travel freely through space in all
directions at the speed of light, or 186,000 miles (300,000 kilometers) per second.
Some seventeenth-century scientists theorized that there was a spe-
cial medium in space called the ether through which light and heat
travelled. This was later proven to be incorrect. The network type
Ethernet was named for the ether that was proposed in these early
theories.
Electromagnetic Wave Characteristics
Suppose that you pick up a garden hose to put out the campfire. If you move your hand up
and down the water will create what look like waves that also move up and down, as shown
in Figure 3-2. Suppose you were to start with your hand level at your waist while holding the
garden hose and then bring it up, then down and finally back to your waist where you
started. You would have completed what could be called one complete cycle. If you were to
do that same movement repeatedly, you would continue to create waves and complete cycles
as long as the water was turned on.
This movement of water from a garden hose is similar to some of the characteristics of elec-
tromagnetic waves:
●
Continuous. An electromagnetic wave is a continuous wave; it does not repeatedly
start and stop.
●
Cycle. Whenever an electromagnetic wave completes its repetitive movement and
returns back to the starting point, it has finished one cycle.

Cycles are illustrated by an up-and-down wave called an oscillating signal or a sine wave.
This is illustrated in Figure 3-3. Notice that the wave starts at zero (that is, at the x-axis),
and then moves up to the maximum voltage (þ), then down to the minimum voltage (), and
finally returns back to its starting point (zero) before beginning the cycle over again.
The cycling nature of an electromagnetic wave produces an alternating
current (AC) because it flows between positive (1) and negative (2).
AC is the type of current that runs to the electrical outlets in a house.
Direct current (DC), which is found in batteries, flows only from one
terminal (1) to the other (2) and does not alternate.
All electromagnetic waves, whether carrying light, heat, or something else, share the same
four characteristics: wavelength, frequency, amplitude, and phase.
Wavelength With the garden hose still in your hand, if you keep your hand at waist
level while you move the end of the hose up and down quickly, you will create short
waves, as shown in Figure 3-4. Yet if you move your hand slowly you will create long waves,
as seen in Figure 3-5. Thus, the distance between the waves’ peaks can be either short or long,
depending on how you move the garden hose.

Electromagnetic waves can likewise have different distances between the peaks. This dis-
tance, called the wavelength, is shown in Figure 3-6. The wavelength, represented by the
Greek symbol  (lambda), is typically measured from the peaks (crests) of the wave; how-
ever, they can be measured from the valleys (troughs) or anywhere in between, as long as it
is at the same point in each cycle.
Some electromagnetic waves have very long wavelengths while others are very short. For exam-
ple, the wavelength of the radio station AM 1120 is 878 feet (267 meters), while the wavelength
of an X-ray used by a physician to spot a broken bone is measured in one billionth of a meter.

Although wavelength measurements are most often stated in metric
units instead of imperial units (feet and inches), in this book both
units are given where possible for comparison purposes.
Frequency Consider again what would happen if you kept your hand at your waist but
moved the garden hose up and down slowly? And what would happen if you moved your
hand very rapidly in the up and down motion? Besides creating long waves and short
waves, another difference would be that moving your hand slowly would result in fewer
waves, while moving it rapidly would result in more waves being created.
Electromagnetic waves behave similarly. The rate at which an event occurs, like moving the
garden hose either slow or fast, will result in a different number of electromagnetic waves
being created over the same time period. This creates an electromagnetic wave’s frequency.
Frequency is the number of times that an event occurs within a specific period of time—
that is, the number of times that a wave completes a cycle within a given amount time.
A lower frequency has fewer cycles than a higher frequency, as illustrated in Figure 3-7.
How frequently an event occurs is its frequency.
Although electromagnetic frequencies are based on the number of cycles per second, the term
hertz (Hz) is instead used as the unit of measurement. An event that occurs one time per second
is equivalent to 1 Hz. Because of the high number of cycles, metric abbreviations are used when

referring to frequencies. For example, a wave measured as 710,000 Hz (710,000 cycles per sec-
ond) would more properly be listed as 710 KHz. The hertz abbreviations are listed in Table 3-1.
The relationship between wavelength and frequency is sometimes called an inverse relation-
ship (the effect of one reverses that of the other, and vice versa). Using the speed of light as a
constant (c), the formula for wavelength is  ¼ c/f, while the formula for frequency is f ¼ c/.
This means that the higher the frequency, the shorter the wavelength will be, and the longer
the wavelength, the lower the frequency.
Amplitude Suppose there is a problem with the power behind the water coming from the
garden hose (perhaps an electric water pump is faulty). If a weak amount of water power runs
through the garden hose the peaks and valleys would not be as high and deep as if a strong
amount of water power was gushing through the hose to produce tall peaks and deep valleys.
In electromagnetic wave terminology, amplitude refers to the magnitude of the change of the
wave and is measured by how high or how deep the wave is as shown in Figure 3-8.
Whereas the wavelength is the distance from the peak of one wave to the next, amplitude is
how high (or deep) the waves are.
Amplitude can either be measured at a wave’s peak or valley, since
they are the same.
Amplitude is essentially a measure of the strength of an electromagnetic wave’s signal.
Although the signal strength may weaken, this does not impact the wavelength or

frequency of the signal as it does the amplitude. Figure 3-9 illustrates a weak and a strong
signal.
Different types of transmissions require different signal strengths. For example, the AM
radio station 1120 may transmit at an extremely strong power of 50,000 units of power,
while a WLAN AP only uses one one-thousandth of the same unit.
The units of power for transmitting and receiving are covered later in
this chapter.
Phase Pretend that you pick up a second garden hose so you now have one in each hand.
With your right hand you hold the first hose at your waist and move it first up and then
down to create waves. At the same time with your left hand you hold the second hose at
your shoulder level and move it first down and then up (just the opposite of the other hose)
to create waves. Because the two waves have two different starting points—one at your
waist starting up and one at your shoulder level starting down—the peaks and valleys
would not match, as illustrated in Figure 3-10.
This example illustrates the concept of phase. The term phase refers to the relationship between
at least two signals that share the same frequency yet have different starting points (and thus dif-
ferent peaks and valleys). Two signals that have the same peaks and valleys are called in phase; if
the peaks and valleys do not match they are out of phase. If two signals are the complete

opposite of each other (the peak of one signal matches the valley of the other signal) the first sig-
nal is in phase while the second signal is 180 degrees out of phase, as shown in Figure 3-11.
The Electromagnetic Spectrum
All the different types of electromagnetic waves make up the electromagnetic spectrum,
which is the range of all electromagnetic radiation. These waves may be categorized by their
frequency, wavelength, or the energy needed to produce the wave. Figure 3-12 shows the cat-
egories of waves in the electromagnetic spectrum. The properties of these categories are fur-
ther defined in Table 3-2.
The electromagnetic spectrum is further subdivided into 450 different sections or bands.
Table 3-3 lists some common bands by their frequencies (number of cycles per second). The United
States is obligated to comply with the international spectrum allocations established by interna-
tional governing bodies. However, the U.S. domestic spectrum uses may differ from international
allocations if these domestic uses do not conflict with international regulations or agreements.

Frequencies of common devices include garage door openers (315
MHz), alarm systems (40 MHz), baby room monitors (49 MHz),
radio-controlled airplanes (72 MHz), radio-controlled cars (75 MHz),
wildlife tracking collars (215 MHz–220 MHz), and global positioning
system or GPS (1.227 GHz and 1.575 GHz).
A license is normally required from the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) to send
and receive via a specific frequency. However, there is a notable exception known as the
license-exempt spectrum or unlicensed bands. Unlicensed bands are parts of the radio spec-
trum that are available nationwide to all users without requiring a license (devices that use
these bands can be either fixed or mobile). However, the FCC does impose power limits on
devices using the unregulated bands, which in effect reduces their range.
The FCC says that it created the unlicensed bands to “foster the
development of a broad range of new devices, stimulate the growth
of new industries, and promote the ability of U.S. manufacturers to
compete globally by enabling them to develop unlicensed digital
products for the world market.”
Name
Description
How They Are Used
Radio
Radio waves have the longest wavelengths in
the electromagnetic spectrum, ranging from
longer than a soccer field to as short as the
length of a soccer ball.
Radio waves can carry music to car radios,
signals for television, and voice and data for
cellular phones.
Microwave
Microwaves have wavelengths that can be
measured in centimeters; longer microwaves of
almost one foot in length are used to heat food
in a microwave oven.
Microwaves are good for transmitting
information over distances because microwave
energy can penetrate haze, light rain and snow,
clouds, and smoke.
Infrared
Infrared light has a range of wavelengths, from
“near infrared” light with wavelengths that are
microscopic to “far infrared” with wavelengths
about the size of a pin head.
Far infrared waves are thermal, which means
they can carry heat; for example special lamps
that emit thermal infrared waves are often used
in fast food restaurants, while near infrared
waves are used by television remote controls.
Visible
Visible light waves are the only electromagnetic
waves that can be seen by humans and appear
as the colors of the rainbow.
Each color has a different wavelength, with red
the longest wavelength and violet the shortest
wavelength.
Ultraviolet
Ultraviolet (UV) light, which has shorter
wavelengths than visible light, are invisible
to the human eye, although some insects can
see it.
The sun emits light at all the different
wavelengths in electromagnetic spectrum, but
ultraviolet waves are responsible for causing
sunburns.
X-ray
X-rays have smaller wavelengths and thus
higher energy than ultraviolet waves; usually
X-rays are referred to in terms of their energy
rather than wavelength.
The earth’s atmosphere is thick enough that
virtually no X-rays are able to penetrate from
outer space all the way to the earth’s surface.
Gamma ray
Gamma rays have the smallest wavelengths and
the most energy of any other wave in the
electromagnetic spectrum.
Gamma rays are generated by radioactive atoms
and in nuclear explosions and can be used to kill
cancerous cells.

Infrastructure (UNII or U-NII), approved in 1996. The UNII band is intended for devices
that provide short-range, high-speed wireless digital communications.
Unlicensed bands can also pose some difficulties. Because they are not regulated and licensed,
different devices from different vendors may attempt to use the same frequency. This conflict
can cause the signals from different devices to interfere with each other and prevent them
from functioning properly. This means that the performance of devices using unregulated
bands may not always be consistent and predictable.
WLANs use either the ISM 2.4–2.4835 GHz or the UNII 5.725–5.825 GHz band. The wave-
length of a 2.45 GHz wave is 4.8 inches (12 centimeters), while the wavelength for a 5.775
GHz wave is only 2 inches (5 centimeters).
A WLAN transmitting at 2.45 GHz is sending an RF signal of
2,450,000,000 cycles each second.
Radio Frequency Modulation
By itself an electromagnetic wave cannot carry any useful information. In order for the wave
to transmit information it must be modified. This modification is called modulation or keying,
and an electromagnetic wave that has been modified for the purpose of conveying information
is a carrier (sometimes called a carrier wave or carrier signal).
The practice of using modulation and carriers for communication are
not new. As far back as Ancient China smoke signals were used to
transmit messages, where the smoke from a fire was interrupted
(modulated) by a wet blanket in order to convey a special dispatch
(carrier).
Because all transmissions can be digitized and broken down into a series of bits (0 and 1), the
modulations of electromagnetic waves essentially involves manipulating the wave to represent
either a 0 or 1. There are three modulations that can be made to a wave to enable it to carry
these bits: amplitude, frequency, or phase. Modulations can be performed on either analog or
digital transmissions.
Although WLAN transmissions are digital, knowing about analog
modulation helps in the understanding of digital modulation.
Analog Modulation
An analog signal is a continuous signal with no breaks in it, which means that no individual
element of an analog signal can be uniquely identified from another element of the signal.
Audio, video, and even light are all examples of analog signals.
Radio Frequency Modulation

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

Three types of modulations can be performed on analog signals. In the first type, known as
amplitude modulation (AM), the amplitude (height) of the wave is changed so that a higher
wave represents a 1 bit and a lower wave represents a 0 bit. Figure 3-13 illustrates the letter A
(ASCII 65 or 01000001) being transmitted by amplitude modulation.
Amplitude modulation, most frequently used by broadcast radio sta-
tions, is often susceptible to interference from outside sources such
as lightning and is not generally used for data transmissions.
Whereas AM varies the amplitude (height) of the signal, frequency modulation (FM) changes the
frequency (number of waves). FM uses more cycles to represent a 1 bit and fewer cycles to repre-
sent a 0 bit. Figure 3-14 illustrates the letter A (ASCII 65 or 01000001) being transmitted by FM.

Like amplitude modulation, frequency modulation is often used by
broadcast radio stations. Yet unlike AM, FM is not as susceptible to
interference from outside sources.
Whereas AM changes the amplitude and FM changes the frequency, phase modulation (PM)
changes the starting point of the cycle. This change takes place only when the bits being
transmitted change from a 1 bit to a 0 bit or vice versa: the change in starting point indicates
that a different bit is now being sent. Figure 3-15 illustrates the letter A (ASCII 65 or
01000001) being transmitted by phase modulation.
Although radio broadcasts use either AM or FM, broadcast television
uses all three types of modulation: AM for video, FM for sound, and
PM for color information.
Digital Modulation
Consider again holding a garden hose. As you move your hand up and down, the water cre-
ates continuous waves as long as the water is turned on. But what if you placed your thumb
over the end of the garden hose for a second and then removed it? Water would stop flowing
(while your thumb was over the hose) and then would squirt out (when you moved your
thumb). This on-off activity is similar to a digital signal. A digital signal consists of data
that is discrete or separate, as opposed to an analog signal, which is continuous. A digital sig-
nal has numerous starts and stops throughout the signal stream.
Because computers operate using digital signals (binary code is dis-
crete, thus it is digital), when analog data, such as a video image or
an audio sound, needs to be processed it must be first converted
from analog data into a digital format.

Although analog modulation could be used for data communications, almost all wireless sys-
tems use digital modulation. Digital modulation holds several advantages over analog
modulation:
●
It makes better use of the available spectrum.
●
It requires less power to transmit digital modulation than analog modulation.
●
It performs better when there is interference from other signals.
●
The error-correcting techniques are more compatible with other digital systems.
In an analog system, the carrier signal is continuous, and amplitude, frequency, and phase
changes also occur continuously. With a digital system, on the other hand, the changes are
in distinct or discrete steps using binary signals.
Digital modulation, like analog modulation, uses three types of modulation: amplitude, fre-
quency, or phase. Amplitude shift keying (ASK) is a binary modulation technique similar to
amplitude modulation in that the height of the carrier can be changed to represent a 1 bit or
a 0 bit. However, instead of both a 1 bit and a 0 bit having a carrier signal as with amplitude
modulation, the ASK 1 bit has a carrier signal (positive voltage) while a 0 bit has no signal
(zero voltage). Figure 3-16 illustrates the letter A (ASCII 65 or 01000001) being transmitted
by ASK.
Digital (binary) modulation is still shown as a standard sine wave.
Similar to frequency modulation, frequency shift keying (FSK) is a binary modulation tech-
nique that changes the frequency of the carrier signal. Because it is sending a binary signal,
the carrier signal starts and stops. Figure 3-17 illustrates the letter A (ASCII 65 or
01000001) being transmitted by FSK.
Phase shift keying (PSK) is a binary modulation technique similar to phase modulation. The
difference is that the PSK signal starts and stops because it is a binary signal. Figure 3-18
illustrates the letter A (ASCII 65 or 01000001) being transmitted by PSK.

milliwatts), RSSI (Receive Signal Strength Indicator), and a percentage measurement. Although all
of these measurements are related to each other, some are more closely related than others. It is
possible to convert from one unit to another, yet such a conversion sacrifices some accuracy.
Milliwatt (mW)
Consider the garden hose once again. The pressure on the water line (typically 80 pounds per
square inch or 552 kilopascals) is analogous to the voltage (V) in an electrical circuit, which
is measured in volts. The water flow, typically 2.5 gallons (9.5 liters) per minute is analogous
to the current (I) in an electrical circuit, which is measured in amperes or amps. Increasing
the diameter of the garden hose from half an inch to one inch (1.2 cm to 2.5 cm) would
cause more water to flow. When talking about an electrical circuit, opposition to the flow of
the current is referred to as resistance (R). Resistance is measured in ohms and the total
amount of resistance is called the impedance. In electrical terms, voltage is equal to current
times resistance, or V ¼ I  R. Electrical power (P), which is measured in watts (W), is volt-
age multiplied by current, or P ¼ V  I. These electrical terms are summarized in Table 3-5.
The formula for voltage (V 5 I×R) was first proposed in 1827 by
German physicist George Ohm and is called Ohm’s Law.
A watt is a basic unit of power of 1 amp of current that flows at 1 volt. A milliwatt (mW) is
one thousandth of a watt of power.
The power that most WLANs transmit is less than 200 mW.
Decibel Milliwatt (dBm)
Most linear scales, like that of the watt, have a reference that is fixed at zero, or the absence of
what is being measured. The speedometer in a car is an example of a linear scale: when the

needle is pointing to zero or the display reads zero, the car is not moving. In the same way, RF
power can be measured on the linear scale by the number of mWs that are being transmitted.
However, measuring by mWs using a linear scale is not always an accurate measurement.
This is in part due to the fact that as the RF signal strength fades it does not do so in a linear
manner. For example, suppose that a user measures an access point’s signal strength when he
is 3 feet (1 meter) away from the access point. If the user then moved twice as far away
(6 feet or 2 meters) the signal would decrease not by a factor of two but instead by a factor
of four. An alternative way of measuring RF power is needed besides the linear mW.
RF signal strength fades inversely as the square of the distance.
A second way to measure RF power is to use a relative scale. In a relative scale the reference
point is the measurement itself, rather than being fixed at zero. A relative scale can be used as
a comparison between two values; the difference can reveal the gain or loss in relation to the
whole. Although the relative scale measurement is not as precise as the linear scale, it gives a
better picture of the loss or gain. It is common to use a logarithm to express the relative rela-
tionship of the measurement to the whole. A logarithm is the exponent to which the number
10 must be raised to reach a given value. For example, the logarithm (or log) of 1,000 is
3 (10³ ¼ 1,000) because the log is always the exponent. RF power gain and loss on a relative
scale are measured in decibels (dB) instead of mW. This is because gain and loss are relative
concepts and a decibel is a relative measurement.
The reference point that relates the logarithmic relative decibel (dB) scale to the linear milli-
watt scale is known as the decibel milliwatt (dBm). This is an abbreviation for the power
ratio in decibels (dB) of the measured power referenced to one milliwatt (mW). This reference
point specifies that 1 mW ¼ 0 dBm and is a measurement of absolute power or “raw signal
strength.” A comparison of dBm levels and watts is listed in Table 3-6.

Typically WLAN vendors provide information regarding the signal strength needed for a
wireless device to transmit. This is given in units of negative dBm. For example, the maxi-
mum signal reading might be 30 dBm, the minimum reading might be 85 dBm, and the
recommended might be 70 dBm or higher. The reason why dBm is expressed in negative
values is because in logarithms the value indicated represents an exponent (a value of 2
represents 10 to the 2 power, which equals 0.01), so a negative dBm means that a negative
exponent is being applied in the power calculations. Since dBm equals 1 mW of power, a
10 dBm is equal to 0.1 mW, a 20 dBm is 0.01 mW, etc. Even though the dBm number
is negative, these are small but positive numbers on a logarithmic scale.
Because dB and mW use different scales (linear vs. relative), a conversion is necessary when
moving between the two. The conversion formula is log (mW)  10 ¼ dBm. For example,
converting from mW to dBm is as follows:
●
100 mW ¼ 20 dBm (log of 100 is 2 or 102 ¼ 100)
●
50 mW ¼ 1.69 dBm (log of 50 is 1.698 or 101.698 ¼ 50)
●
25 mW ¼ 13.9 dBm (log of 25 is 1.397 or 101.397 ¼ 25)
●
13 mW ¼ 11.1 dBm (log of 13 is 1.113 or 101.113 ¼ 13)
●
.5 mW ¼ 3.01 dBm (log of .5 is 0.3010 or 100.3010 ¼ .5)
●
.25 mW ¼ 6.02 dBm (log of .25 is 0.602 or 100.602 ¼ .25)
●
.13 mW ¼ 8.86 dBm (log of .13 is 0.886 or 100.886 ¼ .13)
Notice that, in the preceding examples, each time the actual mW power level decreases by
half, the dBm measurement goes down by about 3 dBm. This leads to a shortcut for calculat-
ing the increase or decrease of these RF values is known as the 10’s and 3’s Rules of RF
Math. The rules are:
●
3 dB – A loss of 3 decibels means that half of the power in mW has been lost
●
þ 3 dB – A gain of 3 decibels means that the power has been doubled in mW
●
10 dB – A loss of 10 decibels means that 90 percent of the power has been lost in mW
●
þ10 dB – A gain of 10 decibels indicates a tenfold increase in mW
Table 3-7 summarizes these rules.
As a general guideline, a decrease of 3 dBm yields roughly half the original value and an
increase of 3 dBm yields roughly twice the original value
The Certified Wireless Network Administrator (CWNA) exam does not
require you to perform logarithmic calculations, but it does require
you understand the concepts of the 10’s and 3’s Rules of RF Math.
Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI)
It is no surprise that users generally find the dBm unit difficult to understand. For example, it
may be hard to explain why a negative dBm is acceptable or that a 100 dBm is equivalent to
0.0000000001 mW. For this reason, other RF signal strength measurements have been used.

The IEEE 802.11 standard defines a mechanism by which RF signal strength energy can be
measured by the circuitry on a wireless network interface card adapter (wireless NIC). This
is known as the Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI). This value was intended for inter-
nal use by the wireless NIC. For example, a wireless NIC in a laptop computer can check the
RSSI value to determine if it is clear to send its transmission or if the user is roaming beyond
the range of a particular AP.
Some client applications display the RSSI to the user as an indication of RF signal strength.
However, the RSSI should not be relied upon as a valid indicator. This is for three reasons.
First, RSSI was not intended to be used in this way. The IEEE standard states, “The RSSI is
intended to be used in a relative manner. Absolute accuracy of the RSSI reading is not
specified.” Second, each vendor may implement RSSI differently. This is because the RSSI is
actually a numeric integer value between the range of 0 and whatever number the vendor
chooses (as long as it is no more than 255). For example, Cisco uses the range 0–100, Atheros
uses 0–60, while a third vendor uses 0–31. This means that there is no specified accuracy to the
RSSI reading that requires the RSSI value to correlate to a specific mW or dBm. Finally, all pos-
sible energy levels (mW or dBm values) may not be represented by the integer set of RSSI values.
Percentage
To avoid the inaccuracies of using RSSI as a basis for reporting RF signal strength, many wireless
clients represent signal strength as a percentage. The percentage represents the RSSI for a particular
packet divided by the maximum RSSI value, and then multiplied by 100. For example, because
Atheros uses the RSSI range 0-60, an RSSI of 30 would mean that the signal strength is 50 percent
(Cisco’s RSSI of 50 would indicate the same percentage since it uses a range of 0–100).
One well-known client software application fails to accurately com-
pute both the RSSI and the percentage. It does not even display the
actual RSSI value; instead, it arbitrarily computes its own value based
on “signal quality [as] a percentage value between 0 and 100,
where 0 equals −100 dBm and 100 equals −50 dBm” and then erro-
neously calls it the RSSI.

Using a percentage for signal strength provides a reasonable measurement for comparisons,
even though different vendor’s NICs were used to make the measurements. The percentage
measurement allows compensation for the integer nature of the RSSI.
Some client utilities only display bars to indicate signal strength
without any indication of what the bars represent, much like that of
a cell phone.
Signal-to-Noise Ratio
Noise is defined as unwanted interference that impacts an RF signal. The signal-to-noise
ratio (SNR) is a ratio of the desired signal to undesired signal (noise) in the average power
level of a transmission. SNR values are given as dB, which is the difference between the two
logarithmic values of signal level minus the noise level. For example, a signal level of 53
dBm measured near an AP with a typical noise level of 90 dBm results in a 37 dB SNR.
For a WLAN noise is typically interference from other RF signals, such as from a cordless
telephone or microwave oven. In addition, the distance between devices also reduces the sig-
nal level. That’s because the lower the power of the signal the more difficult it is to distin-
guish it from noise (similar to trying to hear a whisper while standing at a rock concert).
As a general rule, the following SNR values relate to overall WLAN performance and the
number of bars that are typically displayed:
●
Over 40 dB SNR—Excellent signal (5 bars)
●
25 dB–40 dB SNR—Very good signal (3–4 bars)
●
15 dB–25 dB SNR—Low signal (2 bars)
●
10 dB–15 dB SNR—Very low signal (1 bar)
●
Less than 10 dB—No signal (0 bar)
Radio Frequency Behavior
C W N A
1.1.1. Define and explain the basic concepts of RF behavior.
The behavior of a radio frequency signal has a significant impact upon the speed of the trans-
mission and the distance that be achieved between the devices. These RF behaviors can be
classified as propagation behaviors. Different behaviors can impact the signal by either taking
power away from the signal or adding to it.
Propagation Behaviors
A common misconception is that an RF signal that goes out from an antenna is a single sig-
nal that takes a direct straight path to the receiver. However, this is incorrect in two ways.
First, there is not just one RF signal that reaches the receiver. Along with the primary signal,

multiple copies of that signal may reach the receiver, all at different times. This phenome-
non is known as multipath. Second, because the signals radiate out in many directions,
they may not always take a straight path to the receiver. The signal may “bounce” off of
walls and other objects in the area. The way in which the signal travels is known as wave
propagation. The incorrect and correct views of wave propagation and multipath are illus-
trated in Figure 3-19.
There are several different behaviors that the wave will take, depending upon the objects and
even the materials that the surrounding objects are made of (that is, depending on their com-
position). These behaviors include absorption, reflection, scattering, refraction, and diffraction.
Absorption Certain types of materials can absorb the RF signal. This is known as
absorption. The types of materials that will absorb an RF signal include concrete, wood,
and asphalt. Absorption is illustrated in Figure 3-20.

Reflection Reflection is the opposite of absorption. Instead of the signal being soaked up,
it is bounced back. Reflection generally is caused by objects that are very large (in relation
to the size of the wavelength of the signal, or the distance between successive amplitude
peaks) and relatively smooth, such as walls, buildings, and the surface of the earth. Also,
objects that are made out of metal will reflect a signal. These can include metal roofs, metal
walls, and elevator shafts. A signal is generally weaker after it is reflected. Reflection is seen
in Figure 3-21.
Scattering Whereas reflection is caused by large and smooth objects, scattering is caused
by small objects or rough surfaces. Objects that can cause scattering include foliage, rocks,
and sand. Scattering can also occur when the RF signal comes in contact with elements in
the air, such as rain or heavy dust particles. Scattering is illustrated in Figure 3-22.
Refraction Over a long distance, an RF signal might move through a variety of atmo-
spheric conditions. For example, it might start out in a relatively transparent condition,
such as in bright sunshine, then go through a much denser condition, such as cold damp
air. When an RF signal moves from one medium to another of a different density the signal
actually bends instead of traveling in a straight line. This bending behavior is known as
refraction and is seen in Figure 3-23.

Refraction is the reason why a swimming pool appears deeper than
it actually is. When you look into a pool, the light from the bottom
is refracted away from the perpendicular because the index of refrac-
tion in air is less than in water.

Diffraction Unlike refraction, in which the medium through which the signal passes
causes the RF signal to bend, diffraction is caused by an object in the path of the transmis-
sion signal. Diffraction occurs when an object with rough surfaces is in the path of the RF
signal and causes it to bend. Diffraction is seen in Figure 3-24.
Impact of Behaviors
As to be expected, wave propagation (absorption, reflection, scattering, refraction, and dif-
fraction) and multipath can all have an impact upon the RF signal reaching its destination.
This impact can be either a negative loss or a positive gain.
Loss There are two primary phenomena that can result in the loss of an RF signal. These
are Free Space Path Loss and Delay Spread.
Free Space Path Loss (FSPL) As the RF signal move away from the sending source it
spreads out. The further the signal spreads out, the weaker it becomes. Attenuation is the
loss of signal strength. For an RF signal this loss results in a decrease in amplitude of the sig-
nal. Free space path loss (FSPL) is the “natural” loss of signal strength through space and is
not the loss impacted by absorption, reflection, scattering, refraction, or diffraction. FSPL
represents the single greatest source of power loss in a wireless system. Table 3-8 illustrates
the approximate free space path loss for 802.11b/g WLANs.
The decrease in signal strength due to free space path loss is
inversely proportional to the distance traveled and proportional to
the wavelength of the signal.

Delay Spread Due to reflection, scattering, refraction, or diffraction, multiple “copies” of
the RF signal may reach the receiver all at different times (multipath). Although the difference
between the signals can be measured in units as small as a billionth of a second (nanosecond),
these brief time differences can still affect reception. These time differences are known as delay
spread. When a device receives the primary signal along with multiple copies, these copies are
“added” to the primary signal. The three negative effects of delay spread are:
●
Downfade. A delayed RF signal that is out-of-phase with the primary signal can cause
decreased signal amplitude at the receiver known as downfade. This is because the
delayed out-of-phase signal is “added” to the primary signal, which results in an over-
all decrease.
●
Corruption. When an out-of-phase delayed signal that has become attenuated is added
to the primary signal, it may weaken the amplitude to the point that the receiving
device cannot properly interpret the transmission. This is known as corruption.
●
Nulling. If the delayed RF signal arrives 180 degrees out of phase it will completely
cancel the primary RF signal. This is called nulling.
Amplification Not all delay spread is negative. Surprisingly it can also be positive. The
strengthening of the signal is called a gain and is defined as the positive difference in ampli-
tude between two signals. Gain is achieved by an amplification of the signal.
Sometimes
“gain”
is
used
synonymously
with
“amplification.”
However, gain is technically the measure of amplification.
Amplification in delay spread can occur if the copies arrive virtually at the same time as the
primary signal and are in phase (or just slightly out of phase). The end result is that the sig-
nal is actually strengthened when added together. This phenomenon is called upfade.
Chapter Summary
■A special form of energy known as an electromagnetic wave carries elements through
the universe. All electromagnetic waves share the same four characteristics: (1) electro-
magnetic waves can have different distances between the peaks and distance is called
the wavelength; (2) waves vary by the number of cycles created each second and this is
known as the wave’s frequency; (3) for an electromagnetic wave the amplitude is the
magnitude of the change of the wave and is measured by how high or how deep the
wave is; and (4) the wave’s phase is the relationship between at least two signals that
share the same frequency yet have different starting points.
■All the different types of electromagnetic waves make up the electromagnetic spectrum,
which is the range of all electromagnetic radiation. These waves may be categorized by
their frequency, wavelength, or the energy needed to produce the wave. The electro-
magnetic spectrum is further subdivided into 450 different sections or bands. Although
a license is normally required to send and receive using a specific frequency, this is not
the case for the license-exempt spectrum or unlicensed bands, two of which are used

for WLANs: Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band and the Unlicensed
National Information Infrastructure (UNII or U-NII).
■By itself an electromagnetic wave cannot carry any useful information; instead, to
transmit information it must be modified (called modulation or keying). Because all
transmissions can be digitized and broken down into a series of bits (0 and 1), the
modulation of electromagnetic waves essentially involves manipulating the wave to
represent either a 0 or 1. There are three modulations that can be made to a wave to
enable it to carry these bits: amplitude, frequency, or phase, and these modulations can
be performed on either analog or digital transmissions. For analog transmissions,
amplitude modulation (AM) varies the height of the wave so that a higher wave
represents a 1 bit while a lower wave represents a 0 bit. Frequency modulation (FM)
changes the frequency (number of waves) so more cycles to represent a 1 bit and fewer
cycles to represent a 0 bit , while phase modulation (PM) changes the starting point of
the cycle (the change in starting point indicates that a different bit is now being sent).
■Although analog modulation could be used for data communications, almost all wire-
less systems use digital modulation. There are several advantages of digital modulation
over analog modulation, and digital modulation, like analog modulation, uses three
types of modulation: amplitude, frequency, or phase. Amplitude shift keying (ASK) is a
binary modulation technique similar to amplitude modulation, in that the height of the
carrier can be changed to represent a 1 bit or a 0 bit; yet instead of both a 1 bit and a
0 bit having a carrier signal as with amplitude modulation, the ASK 1 bit has a carrier
signal (positive voltage) while a 0 bit has no signal (zero voltage). Frequency shift key-
ing (FSK) is a binary modulation technique that changes the frequency of the carrier
signal, and phase shift keying (PSK) is a binary modulation technique that changes the
starting point of the cycle.
■It is often necessary to measure the RF signal strength that is being received by a
mobile device. Four basic measurements are used for WLANs. A watt is a basic unit of
power of 1 amp of current that flows at 1 volt, and milliwatt (mW) is one thousandth
of a watt of power. RF power gain and loss on a relative scale are measured in deci-
bels (dB) instead of mW. The reference point that relates the logarithmic relative deci-
bel (dB) scale to the linear milliwatt scale is known as the decibel milliwatt (dBm).
A shortcut for calculating the increase or decrease of RF between mW and dBm is the
10’s and 3’s Rules of RF Math. The Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI) is a value
that was intended for internal use by the wireless NIC, yet some client applications
display the RSSI to the user as an indication of RF signal strength. However, the RSSI
should not be relied upon as a valid indicator. To avoid the inaccuracies of using RSSI
as a basis for reporting RF signal strength, many wireless clients represent signal
strength as a percentage.
■The behavior of the radio frequency signal has a significant impact upon the speed of
the transmission and the distance that be achieved between devices, and these RF
behaviors can be classified as propagation behaviors. Along with the primary signal,
multiple “copies” of that signal may reach the receiver, all at different times, and this
is known as multipath. Also, because the signals radiate out in many directions, they
may not always take a straight path to the receiver but instead may “bounce” off of
walls and other objects in the area. The way in which the signal travels is known as
wave propagation. Certain types of materials can absorb the RF signal (absorption),

while other materials bounce the wave back (reflection). Whereas reflection is caused
by large and smooth objects, scattering is caused by small objects or rough surfaces.
Over a long distance, an RF signal may move through different atmospheric condi-
tions. Known as diffraction, this phenomenon occurs when an object with rough sur-
faces is in the path of the RF signal and causes it to bend.
■This impact of propagation behaviors can be either a negative loss or a positive gain.
As the RF signal moves away from the sending source, it spreads out and weakens,
resulting in attenuation (a decrease in amplitude of the signal). Free space path loss
(FSPL) is the “natural” loss of signal strength through space. Due to reflection, scat-
tering, refraction, or diffraction, multiple “copies” of the RF signal may reach the
receiver all at different times (multipath). Although the difference between the signals
can be measured in units as small as a billionth of a second, this difference can affect
reception. These time differences are known as delay spread. Delay spread can either
result in a loss or a gain in signal strength.

Case Project 3-2: Impact of Propagation Behaviors
Absorption, reflection, scattering, refraction, and diffraction can all have an impact on RF
signal strength. Using the Internet, identify at least three objects or types of materials in
each of the five categories that can impact RF signals. Next, research how much the impact
is in terms of loss (either dBm or mW).
Case Project 3-3: Attenuation
Attenuation is not limited to wireless LANs, but can also affect wired LANs as well.
Research the types of attenuation that can impact wired networks. How can attenuation be
measured on a wired network compared to a wireless network? Which is more difficult to

Case Project 3-5: Nautilus IT Consulting
Nautilus IT Consulting (NITC), a computer technology business that assists organizations in
developing IT solutions, has contacted you to help them with their customers.
Washington Heating and Cooling (WHC) has recently moved into a new facility—an older
renovated warehouse—and contracted with NITC to install a wireless LAN. However,
because of the materials in the older building and other factors, the reception has been
spotty. NITC told WHC that additional access points are now needed, but WHC has said
that they think NITC simply did a poor installation job to begin with and now wants to
add additional equipment beyond the original agreement. WHC is refusing to make the
final payment to NITC for work already completed. NITC has asked you to come in as an
arbitrator to work through the situation.
1. Create a PowerPoint presentation of eight or more slides that covers the different prop-
agation behaviors and their impact upon RF signal strength. Because you will be addres-
sing WHC’s senior management, your presentation should not be too technical.
2. After your presentation, WHC had a third-party perform an analysis that showed mW
and dBm values. Because of the trust relationship you established with WHC, you’ve
been asked to explain those values to WHC management. Create a one-page summary
of mW and dBm values that would help WHC management understand those figures.

To many users, antennas are just one of life’s great mysteries. They know from experience
that any antenna is better than having no antenna, and that the higher the antenna is located,
the better the reception will be. However, that is virtually all most people know about these
strange-looking devices.
Like most cities, San Francisco wrestles with automobile parking. Drivers endlessly
circle city blocks—adding more traffic to the roads and more carbon emissions to the
air—as they watch and wait for a parking place on the street to open, hoping that
they are in the right place at the right time to pull in. Yet after they find a space,
only 45 percent of the drivers actually put money into the meter, which results in an
annual loss in city revenue of $2,400 per meter. Now, all of that is starting to change,
thanks to the help of wireless networks.
San Francisco has contracted with Streetline Networks, a company that sells
parking-control systems, to help manage its parking problems. Low-power magnetic
sensors about three inches wide are embedded in the street to detect both moving
traffic and cars parked in a metered parking spot. Wireless devices are also installed
on the parking meters themselves. Data from the sensors and meters are wirelessly
transmitted to devices on top of streetlights and traffic-signal boxes to form a wire-
less mesh network that sends the information back to the San Francisco parking
authorities. This data can be used to identify real-time parking trends, make immedi-
ate site-specific parking policies, and create a more focused enforcement effort.
For example, if a particular street has a high volume of traffic and no available parking
spots, the San Francisco parking authorities will raise the meter rates up to $6 an hour
(the wireless meters can be reprogramed remotely to instantly reflect the new prices).
The goal is to encourage drivers to stop circling the block looking for a parking place and
instead go to a less-expensive municipal garage or find another neighborhood in which
to park. In addition, the system also sends expired-meter data to smartphones carried by
police officers, who can go directly to a parking spot that has a car with an expired
meter to write a citation (instead of checking each meter to see if time has expired).
San Francisco started this project with a pilot study in which the wireless sensors
were placed along one curb mile of about 200 on-street parking spaces. The pilot
study identified and ticketed so many drivers who had not “fed the meter” that the
system paid for itself within the first two months of operation. The city is now
planning to buy 8,000 sensors. It is estimated that San Francisco could generate $40
million in new revenue annually from parking citations, while at the same time
improving overall parking performance. Other cities are also looking at installing the
wireless Streetline technology.

Yet the antenna is arguably one of the most important parts of a wireless radio frequency
(RF) network. Antennas play a vital role in both sending and receiving signals: A properly
positioned and functioning antenna can make all the difference between a wireless LAN oper-
ating at peak efficiency or a network that nobody can use.
In this chapter you will learn about antennas. You will start by examining what an antenna is,
how it works, and how it can be measured. Then, you will look at the different types of
antennas, as well as the various coverage patterns they create. Next, the new technology of
using multiple antennas, known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO), will be explored.
Finally, you will examine the installation of antennas, the types of required equipment, and
how the signal can be measured.
Antenna Concepts
C W N A
1.2.1. Understand and apply the basic components of RF mathematics.
1.3.1. Identify RF signal characteristics, the applications of basic RF
antenna concepts, and the implementation of solutions that require
RF antennas.
1.3.2. Explain the applications of physical RF antenna and antenna system types and identify
their basic attributes, purpose, and function.
Several basic concepts about antennas are important to understand. These include knowing
what an antenna is, what it does, and understanding the measurements for determining an
antenna’s performance.
What Is an Antenna?
A conductor is a material that allows an electrical current to flow through it. An alternating
current (AC) sent to a conductor generates an electromagnetic field around that conductor.
This field will pulse and vary as the AC does. The electromagnetic field will then radiate
away from the conductor into space. If another conductor is placed nearby, the electromag-
netic field lines that cross this remote conductor will induce on it an electric current that is a
copy of the original current.
These conductors can be used as antennas. An antenna is a passive conductor that is used to
transmit electromagnetic waves through space. The antenna itself is passive and contains no
power or energy to release, but instead relies on the power source to which it is attached. Anten-
nas are located at the transition point between the device that creates (or receives) the AC and
the air through which the waves are transmitted. A conceptual antenna is shown in Figure 4-1.

In telecommunications, transmitting (outgoing) is often abbreviated
Tx while receiving (incoming) is Rx.
The simplest antenna is a bare metal wire called a whip antenna. (This type of antenna is
found on older automobiles and cellular phones.) Technically, a whip antenna is “a quarter
wavelength wire that stands above a ground plane.” The term quarter wavelength indicates
that the length of the antenna should be at least one-quarter of the wavelength of the electro-
magnetic wave that it is sending or receiving. This means that FM (frequency modulation)
radio stations that broadcast at 100 MHz would require an antenna that is 30 inches (75
centimeters) in length. The basic formula for computing the necessary length of a whip
antenna in inches is 2952/Frequency (MHz) (or 7500/Frequency (MHz) for centimeters). The
term ground plane refers to the area of the electrical ground. All antennas, like any electronic
component, have at least two connection points: a connection to a power source and to a
ground to form a complete circuit. The electromagnetic field is set up between the whip and
the ground plane, with current flowing through the field, completing the circuit. The ground
plane should spread out at least a quarter wavelength around the base of the whip. Although
the ground plane can be smaller, it will affect the performance of the antenna. A whip
antenna is illustrated in Figure 4-2.
After learning of electromagnetic wave experiments through a
magazine article, the young Italian engineer Guglielmo Marconi
constructed the first transmitter for wireless telegraphy in 1895
using a wire strung between two trees as an antenna. Within two
years, he was using this new invention to communicate with ships
at sea. In the early morning of April 15, 1912, a 21-year-old telegrapher in New York City
received a wireless message from the wireless station in Newfoundland that had picked up
faint SOS distress signals from the steamship Titanic, and the information was promptly
spread across the world. This singular event dramatized the importance of this new means of
communication.

Antenna Measurements
There are several measurements used with antennas. These measurements include Intentional
Radiator (IR), Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP), Decibels Isotropic (dBi), and
Decibels Dipole (dBd).
Intentional Radiator (IR) The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) labels a
system that is used to create and transmit RF signals an intentional radiator (IR). First, it is
intentional in that it is specifically designed to send out electromagnetic waves, as compared
to other devices that may only create waves as a by-product. (By contrast, an electric motor,
which creates RF waves and can even interfere with a wired network, is an unintentional
radiator.) Second, it is a radiator designed to radiate out, or send, a signal.
The FCC limits the amount of power that can be generated by an IR. However, when calcu-
lating this power, the FCC considers an IR to be all of the components in a system except
the antenna.
IR is the power that is directed to the antenna.
Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP) The term isotropic is used to
refer to something that has absolute uniformity in all its characteristics in all directions. An
isotropic radiator is a source of RF waves that has the exact same magnitude or properties
in all directions; that is, because there is no preference in the direction of the radiation, an
isotopic radiator sends out its signal uniformly in all directions. A true isotropic radiator is
only theoretical and is used as a reference point by which other radiators can be compared.
An isotropic radiator allows for comparisons between different emit-
ters regardless of their size or type.
The amount of power that a theoretical isotropic radiator can generate is called the Equiva-
lent (also called Effective) Isotropically Radiated Power (EIRP). EIRP is the power radiated
out by the wireless system and includes any antenna amplification (gain). As with IR, the
FCC limits the amount of EIRP that can radiate from an antenna.
EIRP is the power that is directed from the antenna.
The maximum EIRP for IEEE 802.11b WLANs is 100 mW (20 dBm). The EIRP for 802.11g
and 802.11a wireless networks vary by transmission speed and are listed in Table 4-1.
The EIRP for an 802.11n network varies considerably depending
upon its configuration.

Decibels Isotropic (dBi) Although an isotropic radiator sends its signals out uniformly
in all directions, in some instances the RF signal needs to be directed towards a specific
receiver, such as in a wireless mesh network. How can this be accomplished? Because an
antenna is only a radiator, it is passive and by itself contains no “native” power to release;
instead, it must rely upon the power source to which it is attached. If more IR power was
sent by the power source to the antenna, the signal would radiate out farther, yet it would
radiate out equally in all directions. This means it would take a significant additional
amount of power to ultimately reach the receiver and could even interfere with other anten-
nas, as shown in Figure 4-3.
The answer to this problem is to send, or focus, the signal in a specific direction towards the
receiver. Focusing the signal is known as a passive gain because no additional IR power is
added. (If additional IR power was sent to the antenna from the power source this would
be an active gain.) If an antenna has a passive gain in one direction, it must have a decrease
in the other directions, since no additional energy is being added.

If you were to stand out in a field, look up into the sky, and shout,
anyone standing around you could hear your voice. Yet if you were
to face one person and cup your hands around your mouth to direct
your voice to that person, then others would not be able to hear you
clearly if at all. This is the concept behind a passive gain.
This focusing can often be accomplished through the type of antenna. High-gain antennas
have longer ranges and higher signal quality, yet must be aimed precisely in a particular direc-
tion, whereas low-gain antennas have a shorter range but do not have to be precisely aimed
at the receiver. The antenna on a spacecraft that must be directed to a specific point on the
earth is an example of a high-gain device; a WLAN antenna is typically a low-gain device.
It is important to use the correct type of antenna in order to meet a
network’s needs.
Measuring the passive gain of an antenna is necessary in order to determine if the directed
signal can reach its destination or to compare two types of antennas. The passive gain
(increase) of power that is “funneled” from an antenna, compared to that of an isotropic
radiator sent in all directions, is measured in decibels isotropic (dBi). The dBi is a relative
measurement of power, and not an absolute measurement, since it only compares the pas-
sive gain with an isotropic radiator. See Figure 4-4.
The dBi is the antenna gain.
Decibels Dipole (dBd) The most basic type of antenna is known as a dipole. A dipole
antenna can be made with a single stretched wire that has a connection in the middle and
resembles a T shape. The current is fed to the middle of the antenna via the connection and
then decreases uniformly from the maximum power at the center out to zero at the ends of
the wire. Dipole antennas are the simplest and most practical types of antennas.

Dipole antennas were created by Heinrich Hertz in 1886 based on
his experimentation on electromagnetic radiation.
Whereas dBi is a relative measurement that compares the passive gain with a theoretical iso-
tropic radiator, decibels dipole (dBd) compares the antenna gain against that of a dipole
antenna. Because 0 dBd is approximately equivalent to 2.14 dBi (meaning that a standard
dipole antenna is 2.14 dBi), to convert from dBd to dBi simply means adding 2.14 to the
dBd value. For example, 2.00 dBd ¼ 4.14 dBi.
dBd is the antenna gain compared to a dipole antenna. However,
WLAN equipment is rarely measured in dBd; instead, dBi is more
commonly used.
Table 4-2 compares the different measurements used with antennas.

teristics for specific applications.
Omnidirectional Antennas
The most common type of antenna for a WLAN is an omnidirectional antenna. An omnidi-
rectional antenna radiates its signal out horizontally in all directions equally. A user standing
30 feet (9 meters) away on one side of an omnidirectional antenna should receive the same
strength signal as a user standing the same distance away on the other side of the antenna.

Omnidirectional antennas are sometimes used in outdoor WLAN applications, such as in a
remote wireless root bridge point-to-multipoint configuration that connects two or more
buildings. In this setting, the omnidirectional antenna on the root bridge can transmit simul-
taneously to all the other receiving devices located in separate buildings.
Remote wireless bridges are covered in Chapter 2.
Although they can be used in an outdoor configuration, omnidirectional antennas are more
commonly used for indoor WLANs. An access point (AP) is usually centrally located in a
hallway to cover rooms on each side or in the middle of a warehouse so that the signal is
spread equally across the area. Dipole antennas are omnidirectional antennas that are fre-
quently used with wireless LANs. A typical dipole antenna for a WLAN is a thin, straight
metal rod that is encased in plastic. Figure 4-5 shows a WLAN dipole antenna.
There are three factors to consider with WLAN dipole omnidirectional antennas: horizontal
vs. vertical coverage; polarization; and antenna diversity.
Horizontal vs. Vertical Coverage The strength of the signal from an omnidirec-
tional antenna flows out 90 degrees from the orientation of the antenna. Thus, even though

an omnidirectional antenna radiates its signal out horizontally as well as vertically, it pro-
vides less coverage area vertically. If the antenna is in an upright vertical position, most of
the signal goes out “sideways” to adjoining rooms. If the antenna is in a horizontal position,
“lying flat,” most of the signal goes up to the ceiling and down to the floor.
Suppose a standard omnidirectional antenna is placed in the center of Floor 5 of a multi-
story building. Most of its signal will radiate horizontally along Floor 5; only some of the
signal will vertically reach Floor 4 and Floor 6 above and below the AP. If a high-gain
omnidirectional antenna is placed in the same position, the signal is even “flatter” (that is,
more horizontal) and less vertical, meaning that more of the rooms on Floor 5 will receive
the signal but less of it will radiate to Floor 4 or Floor 6.
Because WLANs are typically configured to provide the broadest cov-
erage areas horizontally to users in multiple rooms on the same floor,
the antennas should be positioned vertically (most AP dipoles are
hinged so that they can be adjusted). However, if the coverage
needs to be increased to accommodate more users on the floors
above and below, the antennas can be adjusted 90 degrees so they are parallel to the floor
to provide greater vertical coverage (yet less horizontal coverage).
Polarization The orientation of radio waves as they leave an antenna is known as polar-
ization. Waves follow the plane of their electrical fields, and the electric field is parallel to
the radiating elements. (The antenna element is the metal part of the antenna that is
doing the radiating.) If the antenna is in a vertical position (perpendicular to the ground),
then the polarization is said to be vertical; if it is in a horizontal position (parallel to the
ground) the polarization is horizontal.
Polarization is typically referred to as being horizontal or vertical, but
the actual polarization can be at any angle. Circular polarization is
also possible.
Antennas must be polarized alike in order for them to send and receive signals efficiently.
An antenna in a horizontal position (that is, a horizontally polarized antenna) will not com-
municate well with a vertically polarized antenna, and vice versa.
For an indoor WLAN this is not as significant as for outdoor antennas because as the RF
signal bounces off of walls and other indoor objects, the polarization may change. How-
ever, for the best reception, a WLAN’s antennas should be in the vertical position, either
pointing up to the ceiling or, for a ceiling mounted AP, pointing down to the floor. This
allows the polarization of the AP antenna to match polarization of wireless laptops.
(Most laptops have antennas built into the sides of the screen so that, when the laptop is
opened, the antennas are in the vertical position.) WLAN vertical polarization is shown in
Figure 4-6.
As noted above, it is possible to adjust the antennas of the AP
90 degrees so they are parallel to the floor in order to provide
greater vertical coverage to floors above and below. However, the
reception may be impacted due to polarization.

Antenna Diversity Many 802.11a/b/g APs have two dipole antennas, as shown in
Figure 4-7. Such APs employ antenna diversity to improve the reception. Due to the impact
of propagation behaviors (absorption, reflection, scattering, refraction, and diffraction),
signals may arrive at the two dipole antennas at different times and with different signal
strengths. Instead of being a hindrance, having multiple antennas can offer the AP several
“looks” at the same signal, since the signal reaching each antenna will have experienced
different interference. After receiving these multiple copies of the same signal, the AP can
then select the best signal to use by comparing the signal strengths of the received transmis-
sions. Selecting the best signal to use is known as switching.
An AP with multiple external dipole antennas will only use the recep-
tion from one antenna.
Antenna diversity can also be used in transmitting as well. Using a technology known as
transmit diversity, the AP can transmit on the antenna that most recently received the stron-
gest incoming signal.
Semidirectional Antennas
Unlike an omnidirectional antenna, which evenly spreads the signal in all directions, a semi-
directional antenna focuses the energy in one direction. Generally, a semidirectional antenna
will only transmit its signal no more than in a half-circle (180 degrees). For outdoor applica-
tions, semidirectional antennas can be used for short- and medium-range remote wireless
bridge networks, such as in a point-to-point configuration in which two buildings are con-
nected through a wireless network.
A special type of semidirectional antenna used outdoors is known as a sectorized antenna. As
its name suggests, a sectorized antenna divides the coverage area into different sectors and

gives each sector its own radiation pattern, thus improving coverage. For example, a sectorized
antenna could divide the entire 360 degrees of coverage area into nine sectors of 40 degrees
each. Each sector would then have its own sectorized pattern, as shown in Figure 4-8. A varia-
tion of a sectoried antenna is an antenna array, which is comprised of multiple antennas. Yet
unlike a sectoried antenna, the power to each antenna in an antenna array does not have to be
the same. Instead, different power levels or phase distributions to the individual antennas can
be used to customize the transmitted signal.
At an outdoor auto auction of over 300 acres of cars, “walking
auctions” allowed the auctioneer and the buyers to move from car to
car to place bids and then send that information to the main office via
WLAN. Complaints arose that the outdoor WLAN’s omnidirectional
antennas were not sufficient. Instead of installing more poles with
additional APs and electrical power throughout the area, sectorized antennas with an increased
dBi gain were used to replace the omnidirectional antennas in order to increase the coverage area.
For indoor use, a semidirectional antenna can be used when a group of users are clustered
closely together and a broad coverage area is not needed. However, semidirectional antennas
generally are not commonly used for indoor WLANs.
Highly-Directional Antennas
Highly-directional antennas send a narrowly focused signal beam long distances. These
antennas are generally reflective devices that are shaped like a concave dish (that is, like a
parabola). The reflector creates a large surface area that the antenna uses to receive and
transmit signals, as shown in Figure 4-9. These antennas are used for outdoor long-distance
point-to-point wireless links, such as connecting buildings that are up to 25 miles (40 kilo-
meters) apart. Highly-directional antennas are not used for indoor WLANs.
Many Web sites contain instructions for modifying a common large
wire-mesh Chinese vegetable strainer to connect with a Universal
Serial Bus (USB) wireless network interface card adapter to create a
homemade parabolic antenna!

Antenna Coverage Patterns
C W N A
1.3.1. Identify RF signal characteristics, the applications of basic RF
antenna concepts, and the implementation of solutions that require
RF antennas.
Knowing that an antenna in an upright vertical position transmits most of the signal horizon-
tally while only part of the signal radiates above and below the antenna is helpful, yet more
precision is needed to determine the best type of antenna and antenna location for the opti-
mum coverage area. These antenna coverage patterns involve the Azimuth and elevation,
beamwidth, and the Fresnel zone.
Azimuth and Elevation
An antenna radiation chart is used to illustrate the radiation pattern of an antenna. See
Figure 4-10. They are based on what is called a polar or radar chart that illustrates the RF
signal. Antenna radiation charts offer a precise picture of the radiation pattern of an antenna.
An explanation of how to interpret these charts is as follows:
●
Antenna location. The center of the chart is the location of the antenna.
●
Degrees. The degree symbols (from 0 to 360 degrees) along the outer ring of the
chart indicate the coverage pattern around the antenna in degrees. For example,
an omnidirectional antenna would cover a larger portion of the chart than a highly-
directional antenna.
●
Outer circle. The outer circle represents a 100-percent gain.

●
Inner circles. The inner circles represent a gain that is less than 100 percent. For
example, a pattern that does not extend fully to the outer circle yet only extends to
the –3 dB mark indicates only a 50-percent gain, while a pattern that extends to the
–10 dB mark indicates only a 10-percent gain.
The coverage patterns in an antenna radiation chart do not include
antenna gain. In addition, these charts do not represent power levels
or distance in feet (or meters) of coverage.
A radiation pattern has both a horizontal as well as a vertical coverage area, and these are
different. To account for these differences, separate antenna radar charts are used to illus-
trate each. The Azimuth chart represents the horizontal coverage area, while the elevation
chart is used to show the vertical coverage area. That is, the Azimuth chart shows the signal
pattern from looking down from the ceiling at a vertically polarized antenna, while the ele-
vation chart illustrates the signal pattern looking at the same antenna from a side view.
Figure 4-11 illustrates the radiation pattern for an omnidirectional dipole antenna in 3D
and radiation charts in Azimuth (RF projecting out from the antenna) and elevation (RF
projecting up and down from the antenna). Note that the Azimuth horizontal coverage
area is uniform (because it is an omnidirectional antenna) whereas the area of the elevation
coverage is in two lobes that extend out from the antenna. By contrast Figure 4-12 shows
the same three illustrations with a semidirectional antenna, where the Azimuth pattern
is not uniform in all directions but instead is more focused in one direction, as is
the elevation.

Table 4-3 lists the maximum degrees of coverage of Azimuth and elevation charts for the
three types of antennas.
Beamwidth
An antenna’s beamwidth indicates how narrow or wide the transmission is. Beamwidth is
considered a measure of the antenna’s “half-power” range. The beamwidth is determined by
first locating the peak radiation intensity, and then locating the points on either side of the
peak that represent half the power (–3 dB) of the peak intensity. The distance between the
half-power points is the beamwidth. Both horizontal and vertical beamwidths can be mea-
sured, as illustrated in Figure 4-13.

Fresnel Zone
Suppose you were to stand outside and look off into the distance to see your friend. This
would require that there were no large objects in the path of your vision—such as trees, large
buildings, hills and mountains, or even the curvature of the earth—to obscure your friend. In
other words, you would need a visual line of sight from where you stood to see your friend.
The earth curves approximately 8 inches every mile, so an object
100 feet tall would not be visible 15 miles away.
For outdoor RF transmissions, a clear path is likewise necessary between the antennas. How-
ever, this RF line of sight is more demanding than a visual line of sight. With visual line of
sight, it might be possible to look through a line of trees or other objects to see your friend in
the distance. However, with RF line of sight, an object that is even close to the path of the RF
transmission—although not entirely obscuring the RF line of sight—can still impact the signal.
A “hard” object like a building protruding into the signal path can deflect part of the signal and
cause it to reach the receiving antenna out of phase, thus reducing the power or cancelling out the
signal. Leaves or other “soft” objects protruding into the path can reduce the strength of the signal.
Even though you can see the receiving antenna, you do not necessar-
ily have a good quality RF link to that location.
The Fresnel zone (fre-NEL) is an elliptical area immediately surrounding the visual line of
sight for RF transmissions and is shown in Figure 4-14. Each Fresnel zone (theoretically there
are an infinite number of zones between two antennas) is an ellipsoidal or sausage-like shape.
The zone varies in thickness, depending on the length of the signal path and signal frequency.
The signal strength is strongest in Zone 1, which is a straight line from sender to receiver. Sig-
nal strength decreases in each successive zone. Obstacles in the first Fresnel zone will create
signals that will be 0 to 90 degrees out of phase, in the second zone they will be 90 to 270
degrees out of phase, in third zone, they will be 270 to 450 degrees out of phase, etc.

Odd-numbered Fresnel zones are considered constructive while even-
numbered zones are destructive.
Determining where the zones are located, the necessary clearance for Zone 1, and the extent
of the impact of objects can be done through calculations. For example, when sending a
signal 5 miles (8 kilometers) with an obstruction at 2 miles (3.2 kilometers) at 2.4 GHz will
result in Zone 1 being 104 feet (31 meters) at its widest point. The general rule of thumb is
that 60 percent of the first Fresnel zone must be clear of obstacles. In this example the
60-percent radius of the no-obstacles area would be 31 feet (9.6 meters).
Although the Fresnel zone could be calculated by hand, several Web
sites have different calculators you can use to determine different RF
behaviors such as the Fresnel zone. In Hands-On Projects 4-1 and 4-2
you will use these online calculators.
The steps for mitigating obstructions in the Fresnel zone include:
●
Raising the antenna mounting point on the existing structure
●
Increasing the height of an existing tower
●
Building a new structure that is tall enough to mount the antenna
●
Locating a different mounting point on another building or tower for the antenna
●
Cutting down trees

A technology known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has revolutionized wireless
LAN as well as wireless WAN communications over the past decade. It is important to under-
stand this new technology and its signal processing techniques.
What Is MIMO?
It has long been known that a wireless device with multiple receive (Rx) antennas can dra-
matically improve wireless transmissions by either selecting the stronger incoming signal or
combining the individual signals at the receiver. However, IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices can
only transmit or receive on a single antenna at a given time, no matter how many antennas
they may have. A wireless system that uses a single antenna is called a single-input single-
output (SISO) system. A SISO system is characterized by having only one radio chain, or a
radio with supporting infrastructure such as devices to amplify the signal or convert an ana-
log signal into a digital signal. A SISO radio chain is shown in Figure 4-15.
In the mid-1990s, research predicted that a significant improvement in RF performance could
be achieved by not only having multiple antennas but actually using them simultaneously to
transmit and receive. This research, which soon led to new wireless systems that utilized mul-
tiple simultaneous antennas, was called Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO). MIMO is
characterized by having a radio chain for each antenna, as illustrated in Figure 4-16.
Using multiple antennas at the receiver and transmitter has revolu-
tionized today’s wireless communications. Most high-rate wide-area
wireless systems, such as 4G mobile phone technologies like Long
Term Evolution (LTE) and WiMAX, use MIMO technologies.
Because of its advantages, the IEEE made MIMO the heart of 802.11n. The speed of an
802.11n wireless network can be as much as 600 Mbps using MIMO and other enhance-
ments. (By some estimates MIMO alone contributes 40 percent to the increase in speed.)

For this reason the 802.11n standard is sometimes called HT (MIMO) for High Throughput
Multiple-Input Multiple-Output.
Typically, 802.11n APs and internal Mini-PCI-e wireless client network
interface card adapters have a maximum of three radio chains, while
external adapters have at most two radio chains. Mobile devices, like
smartphones, usually have only one radio chain.
MIMO Signal Processing Techniques
MIMO can take advantage of the following signaling processing techniques to create high
throughput: spatial diversity, spatial multiplexing, maximal ratio combining, and transmit
beam forming.
Spatial Diversity An RF signal does not take a direct path straight from the transmitter
to the receiver. Instead, multiple copies of the signal are transmitted, and these various copies
may bounce off objects in the area before reaching the receiver at slightly different times. The
result is multiple copies of the signal arriving at the receiver at different times, having traveled
along different paths (multipath). Although the difference between the signals, known as delay
spread, is measured in nanoseconds, it can negatively impact the reception because these cop-
ies are “added” to the primary signal. This can result in downfade, corruption, or nulling.
Multipath and delay spread are covered in Chapter 3.
Due to the advantages of spatial diversity, what if an intentional delay was inserted into a
copy of the transmission? This is the idea behind Cyclic Shift Diversity (CSD). CSD sends a
“normal” version of the signal transmitted on one Tx antenna while a “shifted” version of
the same signal is sent by one or more Tx antennas. Each Tx antenna also adds a prefix
after shifting the symbol so that the receiving device is aware of the shift. Now what if,
instead of a single transmission being sent from one antenna to another antenna, the same
transmission was sent simultaneously from multiple antennas and was received on multiple
antennas? Each transmission would experience a different multipath, yet there would be a
high probability that, while some signals would undergo deep “fades,” others would not.
Having diverse signals sent from multiple antennas to multiple antennas could improve the
overall reliability of the transmission. That is why multiple antennas are used to reduce the
effect of multipath and delay spread.
This technique for combating multipath by using multiple Tx and Rx antennas is called
spatial diversity (sometimes called MIMO diversity). Spatial diversity can increase the
reliability of an RF signal by sending the same transmission out from different antennas.
Each transmission will take different paths (called spatial paths) between Tx and Rx
antennas. (The signals take diverse paths because the antennas are spaced apart.) Using
these different paths improves reliability because it is unlikely that all of the paths will be
degraded in the same way. Spatial diversity, which sends redundant streams in parallel,
can also improve the range because it allows a larger amount of signal to gather at the Rx
antenna.

Spatial diversity is like sending three disaster relief trucks, all filled
with the same cargo, to victims of a flood. If all three trucks left the
warehouse at the same time, yet took different routes to the destina-
tion through the disaster area, the odds are high that at least one of
the trucks will be able to make it through.
Spatial Multiplexing Although spatial diversity can improve reliability and range, it
does not increase the speed of the wireless transmission. Instead of sending the same trans-
mission out through multiple Tx antennas, what if the data was first split up and then sent
out over multiple Tx antennas, with the receiver merging it back together? That is, instead
of sending redundant streams in parallel, what if the antenna sent independent streams in
parallel? This would significantly increase the speed: three Tx antennas sending three
streams to three Rx antennas could result in a three-fold increase.
This technique is called spatial multiplexing. Spatial multiplexing techniques can increase
performance by sending independent streams of information at the same time over the same fre-
quencies. The advantage of spatial multiplexing is a significant increase in speed without the
need for any additional power or bandwidth. Spatial multiplexing is illustrated in Figure 4-17.
Due to space and power constraints, wireless network interface card
adapters have fewer antennas whereas APs have more antennas to
ensure higher performance. In contrast, mobile devices such as cell phones
and tablets usually have only one WLAN radio chain with one antenna.
MIMO and spatial multiplexing are used in 802.11n networks. A specific numbering system
is used to indicate the number of Tx antennas, Rx antennas, and spatial multiplexed streams.
For example, an 802.11n wireless device designated as 2x3:2 is interpreted as follows:
●
2—maximum number of transmit (Tx) antennas that can be used by the radio
●
3—maximum number of receive (Rx) antennas that can be used by the radio
●
2—maximum number of data spatial streams the radio can use
This means that the radio in this wireless device can transmit on two antennas and receive
on three antennas but can only send or receive two data streams.
Common configurations of 802.11n devices are 2x2:2, 2x3:2, 3x3:2,
and 3x3:3. Although the IEEE standard allows up to 4x4:4, improve-
ments beyond 3x3 are small. Generally 3x3:3 APs are the configura-
tion for high-end 802.11n networks while most clients are 2x3:2.

And if more antennas than spatial streams are available, such as 3x3:2, Space Time Block
Coding (STBC) can be used. STBC sends a redundant copy of part or all of the transmited
signal on the unused antenna(s). This can increase the reliability of the signal at the receiver
and also reduces the Signal-to-Noise ratio (SNR) error rate. STBC is an optional feature in
the 802.11n standard.
Maximal Ratio Combining (MRC) When a client device with only one antenna (such
as an older 802.11a/b/g device) transmits to an 802.11n AP with multiple MIMO antennas, the
AP will receive multiple copies of the multipath signal on each of its Rx antennas, with each sig-
nal at a different phase. The AP then processes the multiple received signals into one “reinforced”
signal by adjusting their phases and amplitudes to form the best possible signal. The algorithm
that the 802.11n AP uses to do this is called the maximal ratio combining (MRC) algorithm.
MRC multiplies each received signal by a weight factor that is proportional to the signal ampli-
tude, so that a strong signal is further amplified while weaker signals are not used (although in
some cases, information from weaker signals may be combined with the stronger signal).
MRC helps the 802.11n MIMO AP to hear the client better, yet it
does not improve the reception of transmissions sent to the non-
MIMO client from the AP.
Transmit Beam Forming (TxBF) An option specified by the IEEE for 802.11n net-
works to improve the reliability of transmissions by reducing outside signal interference (noise)
is transmit beam forming (TxBF). TxBF can use different directions and beamwidths, which
can be generated either by the microprocessor chip attached to the radio chains (called chip-
based beamforming) or by the antenna. Antenna beamforming can be static (a fixed radiation
pattern is used) or dynamic (the radiation pattern can change for each transmitted frame).
TxBF utilizes a process in which the sending device codes or assigns weights to the signals
before sending them. These weights depend on the transmitter’s best estimate of the environ-
ment. The information required to make this estimate can be obtained through implicit or
explicit feedback. With explicit feedback, the receiver makes a series of computations and
sends them to the transmitter, which then uses them to configure how to make the best
transmissions. With implicit feedback, the transmitter assumes that the environment is the
same in both directions and creates the information by tracking incoming information.
Although TxBF is part of the IEEE 802.11n standard, it is highly com-
plex and not widely implemented in 802.11n devices.

Although most 802.11a/b/g APs have dual external dipole antennas, like those pictured earlier
in Figure 4-7, most new 802.11n APs only have internal antennas. However, the use of
MIMO spatial multiplexing can still extend the range of these devices beyond that of an
802.11a/b/g device with antennas.
The antenna spacing for internal antennas needs to be greater than
half the wavelength, which means the internal antennas are spaced
at 4.9 inches (12.5 centimeters) for 2.4 GHz or 2.3 inches (6 centi-
meters) for 5 GHz.
Some enterprise-grade APs have connections for attaching an external antenna, and external
antennas are used for wireless MANs and WANs. Installing an external antenna involves
positioning it at the best location, using the correct installation accessories, and measuring
antenna performance.
Location
Because WLAN systems use omnidirectional antennas to provide the broadest area of cover-
age, APs should be located near the middle of the coverage area. Generally, the AP can be
secured to the ceiling or high on a wall. It is recommended that APs should be mounted as
high as possible for two reasons: to avoid obstructions for the RF signal and to deter thieves
from stealing the device.
In buildings with a false ceiling (also called a drop or suspended ceiling), there is a temptation to
simply remove a ceiling tile, place the AP in the space above the ceiling, and then replace the tile.
However, this should not be done unless a special enclosure surrounds the AP and its antennas.
The air-handling space above drop ceilings (and sometimes even between the walls and under
structural floors) is used to circulate and otherwise handle air in a building. These spaces are
called plenums. Placing an access point in a plenum can be a hazard, because if an electrical
short in the AP were to cause a fire, it could generate smoke in the plenum that would be quickly
circulated throughout the building. If it is necessary to place an AP in a plenum, it is important to
place it within a special plenum-rated enclosure to meet fire safety code requirements.
Outdoor antennas are usually affixed to a pole or mast, which serves the dual purpose of
improving reception and discouraging thieves. Antenna-mounting systems are available that
allow you to secure the antenna, with the option of unlocking it quickly to lower the antenna
for repair or maintenance.
Safety should always be considered when installing an outdoor antenna, particularly when
the antenna is to be mounted high on a pole or a rooftop. These outdoor installations gener-
ally require long ladders, trips to high rooftops, or climbing towers and can be dangerous
due to the heights and the need to work with electrical and RF equipment. It is recommended
that outdoor antenna installation be left to professionals.
The FCC has ruled that local municipalities, cities, or neighborhood
groups cannot impose restrictions on installations of 802.11 WLAN
products on property controlled by a user, except where public
safety is a concern.
Antenna Accessories
A number of devices can “accessorize” an antenna by providing additional functionality and
safety. Often a transmission problem can be resolved by adding one of these accessories to

the antenna system. These accessories include amplifiers, attenuators, RF cable and connec-
tors, and lightning arrestors.
Amplifier An amplifier is a device that amplifies or increases the amplitude of an RF sig-
nal. Often it is necessary to “boost” the strength of a signal to compensate for its loss of
power. This loss may be the result of the distance between the AP and the wireless device,
or it could be due to a loss from the cable connecting a wireless device to its antenna (as
when an external antenna is attached to an AP).
Amplifiers can be of two types. A unidirectional amplifier increases the RF signal level
before it is injected into the transmitting antenna. A bidirectional amplifier boosts the RF
signal before it is injected into a device that contains or is directly connected to the antenna,
such as an AP. Most amplifiers for WLANs are bidirectional.
In the past, amplifiers used in 802.11 WLAN bands had to be certi-
fied by the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and mar-
keted, sold, and installed as a package containing the amplifier, the
transmitter, any specific cable, and the specific antenna. All the pro-
ducts had to be sourced from a single vendor and in the configura-
tion in which they were certified; any changes to the package required a new certification.
However, that is no longer the case. It is now permissible to purchase amplifiers and devices
from separate sources as single entities. However, the amplifier must be certified with the spe-
cific transmitter and antenna it will be installed with and it must also follow the same EIRP
limits as the transmitter itself.
Attenuators Whereas an RF amplifier increases the signal prior to transmission, an RF
attenuator decreases the RF signal. An RF attenuator may be used when the gain of an
antenna did not match the power output of an AP (in order to fully comply with FCC regu-
lations regarding power output of a WLAN) or for testing purposes.
RF attenuators can be either fixed-loss attenuators or variable-loss attenuators. Fixed-loss
attenuators limit the RF power by a set amount, whereas variable-loss attenuators allow
the user to set the amount of loss. Fixed-loss attenuators are the only type permitted by the
FCC for WLAN systems.
RF Cables and Connectors Connecting antennas, amplifiers, and attenuators to an
AP or wireless device requires the correct cables and connectors. Some basic rules for select-
ing cables and connectors include:
●
The connector should match the electrical capacity of the cable and device to which it
is connected, along with the type and gender of connector.
●
Only high-quality connectors and cables from well-known suppliers should be used.
●
Cable lengths should be as short as possible.
●
Cables should match the electrical capacity of the connectors.
●
Whenever possible, you should purchase premanufactured cables rather than cutting
and splicing them together.
●
Use RF signal splitters sparingly. An RF signal splitter is a small device with one input
and two or more outputs, meaning that a splitter divides the power in the input signal

to multiple outputs. Whenever an RF signal is split, its original strength decreases by
one-half.
Because 802.11n uses MIMO, you cannot use an RF signal splitter on
802.11n equipment.
Lightning Arrestor Just as an antenna is designed to pick up RF signals, it also can
inadvertently pick up high electrical discharges from a nearby lightning strike (or contact
with a high-voltage electrical source). A lightning arrestor limits the amplitude and disturb-
ing interference voltages by channeling them to the ground.
A lightning arrestor will not protect equipment from a direct light-
ning strike.
A lightning arrestor, illustrated in Figure 4-18, is designed to be installed between the
antenna cable and the wireless device. One end of the lightning arrestor is connected to the
antenna while the other end connects to the wireless device. The ground lug is connected to
a cable that is grounded. If the arrestor is installed outdoors, the cable should be connected
to a ground rod, which is a metal rod inserted in the earth. Indoors, the cable should be
connected to the structural steel of the building or to a grounded electrical panel.
Measuring Antenna Performance
Several measurements relate to the performance of RF transmissions from antennas. These
include link budget, system operating margin (SOM), and voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR).
Link Budget Figure 4-19 illustrates the gains ( þ ) and losses (–) in power from the trans-
mitter to the receiver known as the link budget. The link budget is a rough calculation of all
known elements of the link between the various wireless components to determine if the sig-
nal will have the proper strength when it reaches its destination. To make an accurate link
budget calculation, you need the following information:

System Operating Margin (SOM) The system operating margin (SOM) is the dif-
ference (measured in decibels) between the received signal level and the signal level that is
required by that radio to assure that the transmission can be decoded without errors. (The
SOM is also referred to as the fade margin.) The SOM is the difference between the signal
received and the radio’s specified receiver sensitivity (the signal needed for a good reception).
The formula is SOM ¼ Rx signal (dBm)  Rx sensitivity (dBm).
System operating margin (SOM) is the difference between “what you
get” and “what you need.”
Voltage Standing Wave Ratio (VSWR) The term impedance is applied to any
electrical entity that impedes or hinders the flow of current. Often impedance is a result of
a mismatch between two devices. The Voltage Standing Wave Ratio or VSWR (pronounced
viswar) is a measure of how well an electrical load is impedance-matched to its source.
A perfect impedance match is the maximum power transferred from the source, yet in reality
that will not occur.
The value of VSWR is expressed as a ratio, with 1 as the denominator, such as 2:1, 3:1, and
10:1. A perfect impedance match of the maximum power transferred from the source corre-
sponds to a VSWR of 1:1. When the VSWR is indicated in dB it is called the return loss.
Table 4-4 lists a comparison of VSWR and return loss values.

For WLANs, if one part of the equipment has different impedance
than another part, the RF signal may be reflected back within the
device itself. Not only does this cause a loss of signal strength, the
reflected power can actually burn out the device’s electronics.
Chapter Summary
■An antenna is used to send electromagnetic waves to a receiving device. The antenna
has no energy or power; instead, it is supplied power from the power source to which
it is connected. Four measurements are used with antennas. An intentional radiator
(IR) is the power directed to the antenna. The Equivalent Isotropically Radiated Power
(EIRP) is the power directed from the antenna. Antenna energy can be focused
through the use of high-gain antennas. By contrast, low-gain antennas have a shorter
range but do not have to be precisely aimed at the receiver. The passive gain (increase)
of power that is “funneled” from an antenna compared to that of an isotropic radiator
sent in all directions is measured in decibels isotropic (dBi). The dBi is a relative mea-
surement and is not an absolute measurement of power, since it is only comparing the
passive gain with an isotropic radiator. Decibels dipole (dBd) compares the antenna
gain against that of a dipole antenna.
■There are three categories of antennas. An omnidirectional antenna radiates its signal
out horizontally in all directions equally and is used extensively in indoor WLANs.
This type of antenna also radiates its signal vertically but provides less coverage area
vertically than horizontally. That is because the strength of the signal flows out
90 degrees from the orientation of the antenna. The orientation of the radio waves as
they leave the antenna is known as polarization. If the antenna is in a vertical position
(perpendicular to the ground) the polarization is vertical, whereas if it is in a horizon-
tal position parallel to the ground the polarization is horizontal. Many have two
dipole antennas and employ antenna diversity to improve the reception. A semidirec-
tional antenna focuses the energy in one direction, while a highly-directional antenna
sends a narrowly focused signal beam long distances.
■A chart used to illustrate the radiation pattern of an antenna is called an antenna
radiation chart. These charts are used to create Azimuth charts that represent the hor-
izontal coverage area and elevation charts to show the vertical coverage area. An
antenna’s beamwidth indicates a transmission’s width. The Fresnel zone is an elliptical
area immediately surrounding the visual line of sight for RF transmissions. Each

Fresnel zone is an ellipsoidal shape, with the zones varying in thickness depending on
the length of the signal path and signal frequency.
■A technology known as multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) has revolutionized
wireless LAN as well as wireless WAN communications over the past decade. MIMO
systems have separate radio chains connected to each antenna. MIMO can take
advantage of different signaling processing techniques in order to create high through-
put. Spatial diversity can increase the reliability of an RF signal by sending the same
transmission out from different antennas that will take different paths between Tx and
Rx antennas. Using these different paths improves reliability because of the unlikel-
hood that all of the paths will be degraded the same. Spatial multiplexing techniques
can increase performance by sending independent streams of information at the same
time over the same frequencies, resulting in a significant increase in speed without any
additional power or additional bandwidth. When a client device that has only one
antenna such as an older 802.11a/b/g device) transmits to an 802.11n AP with multi-
ple MIMO antennas, the AP receives multiple copies of the multipath signal on each of
its Rx antennas, with each signal at a different phase. The AP then processes those
copies using the maximal ratio combining (MRC) algorithm. An option for 802.11n
networks to improve the reliability of transmissions by reducing outside signal inter-
ference (noise) is transmit beam forming (TxBF), which uses complex antenna systems
to allow for different directions and beamwidths to be used.
■Because WLAN systems use omnidirectional antennas to provide the broadest area
of coverage, APs should be located near the middle of the coverage area, usually
secured to the ceiling or high on a wall. Outdoor antennas are often affixed to poles
or masts. It is recommended that outdoor antenna installation be left to profes-
sionals. An amplifier is a device that amplifies or increases the amplitude of an RF
signal, often necessary to “boost” the strength of a signal to compensate for its loss
of power. An RF attenuator decreases the RF signal. An RF signal splitter is a small
device with one input and two or more outputs that divide the power in the input
signal to multiple outputs. Just as an antenna is designed to pick up RF signals, it
also can inadvertently pick up high electrical discharges from a nearby lightning
strike. A lightning arrestor limits the amplitude and disturbing interference voltages
by channeling them to the ground.
■There are several measurements that relate to the performance of RF transmissions
from antennas. The link budget is a rough calculation of all known elements of the
link to determine if the signal will have the proper strength when it reaches its desti-
nation. The system operating margin (SOM), or fade margin, is the difference, mea-
sured in decibels, between the received signal level and the signal level that is required
by that radio to assure that the transmission can be decoded without errors. The Volt-
age Standing Wave Ratio or VSWR is a measure of how well an electrical load is
impedance-matched to its source.

The sport of football is known for its bone-jarring collisions. When a 180-pound gunner
(a player who sprints down the field on a kickoff) runs head-on into a 275-pound line-
man, these violent collisions cause the crowd to jump to its feet. Yet it’s not uncommon
for the gunner to have trouble getting back on his feet. That’s because the force exerted
in such a collision can exceed 100 times the force of gravity, or the same that passengers
experience in a car crash. Among professional, college, and youth football players,
almost 300,000 head concussions from these collisions occur annually.
Players who suffer a brain injury during a football game may experience headache,
nausea, and short-term memory loss (it seldom involves a loss of consciousness), yet
they are unlikely to ask to be taken out of the game for fear of losing their spot in
the lineup. This makes it difficult for coaches and trainers to assess the extent of the
injury and to know when to take them out or allow them back in the game. There is
a growing concern about when—and even if—a player who suffers a violent collision
should return to the field of play. Should a player who is groggy after a big hit be
allowed back in the game? Although the National Football League (NFL) in 2009 cre-
ated new rules that mandate that a player exhibiting any signs of head injury must
leave the field for the remainder of the day, no such rules exist in college or at youth
levels. And in the long term, what can be done to minimize football head traumas?
The answer to these questions may rely on new devices that use wireless technology.
The Head Impact Telemetry (HIT) System was developed by Simbex. It combines six
strategically positioned accelerometers (a device that measures acceleration, much
like those found in a car’s airbag system), a temperature sensor, nonvolatile onboard
memory, a battery pack, and a wireless transceiver into a single package that fits
inside a football player’s helmet—the package adds just 6 ounces (170 grams) to the
weight of a typical helmet. This allows the marshmallow-shaped spring-mounted
accelerometers to rest against a player’s head so that the movement of the skull can
be measured instead of the movement of the helmet itself. An even more compact
system developed by X2Impact has tiny accelerometers and gyroscopes embedded
into the player’s mouth guard. The HIT system automatically captures data when any
single sensor detects an acceleration that exceeds 10 times the force of gravity. Data
is captured regarding the magnitude, duration, and location of the impact from
12 milliseconds before the system is triggered to 28 milliseconds following the impact.
This data is then immediately transmitted wirelessly from the helmet to the side-
lines. The helmet’s transceiver uses a frequency-hopping spread-spectrum protocol
that transmits in the 902–928-MHz frequency range (if both teams are using HIT hel-
mets the radio signals can be differentiated so that one team will not pick up
another team’s signals). A receiver located on the sidelines receives the “hit data”

In 1978 the International Organization for Standardization (ISO) released a set of specifica-
tions that was intended to describe how dissimilar computers could be connected through a
network. Called the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) reference model, this set of specifi-
cations demonstrated networking concepts by portraying networking as a series of related
steps that occur in networked communication. The model breaks network communication
into seven different layers. Within each layer, different networking tasks are performed by
hardware and/or software. Each layer interacts with the layer above it (by providing services)
and the layer below it (by receiving services) and also logically links to the same layer on the
corresponding sending or receiving device. After a revision in 1983, the OSI reference model is
still used extensively today. The layers and their functions are outlined in Table 5-1.
The value of using layers in the OSI reference model is that it divides
networking into a series of tasks and then illustrates how those tasks
relate to each other.
and is connected to a laptop computer, which then displays that information along
with a three-dimensional graphic of the human head and indicators to show where
the player was hit. Trainers and coaches can then make an immediate medical deter-
mination of what action needs to be taken regarding the player. At the end of the
game all of the data is combined with the data from all other players.
An early version of the HIT system, introduced in 2003, outfitted four football
players from two colleges who were monitored through 35 practices and 10 games.
Researchers recorded roughly 3,300 head hits and found that, on average, players
endured 50 impacts strong enough to trigger the system during the course of a single
game. The average acceleration caused by the hits was 40 times the force of gravity
per blow (the same level of impact delivered by the gloved fist of a professional
boxer), and at least twice per game the players took hits to the head of 100 times the
force of gravity. This data was compared against the Gadd Severity Index (GSI), which
is a method developed by car crash researchers for describing just how jarring a blow
someone has received. While a human head can withstand GSI values up to 1000 with-
out serious injury, the blows endured by these players ranged as high as 1599. Today
hundreds of college teams and many professional teams use the HIT system.
The data accumulated has revealed some interesting information. For example, dif-
ferent positions on football teams sustain different types of blows to the head. Line-
men sustain frontal blows that are usually low impact blows, yet there are several
blows per game. In contrast, wide receivers receive fewer, but harder blows. And
linebackers sustain higher accelerations than linemen. This may lead to specific hel-
mets being designed for different positions. In addition, coaches can use this data to
determine if tackling is being taught correctly. The HIT system is also used in hockey
at the college and youth level, as well as in studies in equestrian sports, snowboard-
ing, soccer, and even in the military.

In this chapter you learn about IEEE 802.11 wireless LAN functions at the lowest layer of the
OSI reference model, the Physical layer. Because the Physical layer primarily deals with turn-
ing frames into electrical impulses for transmission, you will begin by exploring the different
wireless modulation schemes. Then you examine each of the IEEE WLAN standards and see
how they are implemented at the Physical layer.

PHY clauses.
2.1.3. Identify the underlying concepts of how spread-spectrum technology works.
The two primary radio frequency (RF) modulation techniques are narrowband transmission
and spread spectrum.
Narrowband Transmission
RF signals that are transmitted on only one frequency are known as narrowband transmis-
sions. A broadcast radio station using narrowband transmission would tell listeners to
“tune to 88.5” because this is the one frequency on which the radio signal is transmitted.
Narrowband transmissions, illustrated in Figure 5-1, require more power for the signal to
be transmitted because the signal must exceed the noise level, or the total amount of out-
side interference (noise), by a substantial margin.
The primary advantage of a narrowband transmission is the efficiency that comes from
using only a small portion of the spectrum for its transmission. However, there are several
disadvantages of narrowband transmissions for WLANs. Narrowband transmissions

require more power and yet are vulnerable to interference from another radio signal being
transmitted at or near the same frequency. Much like an accident on a one-lane road can
stop all traffic, a single interfering signal at or near the broadcast frequency can render a
narrowband transmission ineffective. The IEEE 802.11 standards do not permit the use of
narrowband transmissions for WLANs.
Spread-Spectrum Transmissions
An alternative to narrowband transmission is spread-spectrum transmission. Whereas a nar-
rowband transmission sends a strong signal using a small portion of the spectrum, spread
spectrum transmits a weaker signal across a broader portion of the radio frequency band, as
seen in Figure 5-2.
Spread spectrum has several advantages over narrowband transmission. These include:
●
Resistance to narrowband interference. Spread-spectrum transmission is more resistant
to outside interference. This is because any interference affects only a small portion of
the signal being transmitted instead of impacting the entire signal as with narrowband.

In this way spread-spectrum transmissions help keep traffic moving, much like multiple
lanes of a highway: although an accident in one lane of an four-lane highway is
inconvenient, cars can use the three other lanes to move around it and keep going.
●
Resistance to spread-spectrum interference. Because each spread-spectrum transmitter
uses a different set of procedures for transmitting its signal, spread-spectrum transmis-
sions typically do not interfere with other spread-spectrum signals.
●
Lower power requirements. Since spread spectrum requires less power to transmit the
signal, the radio sending unit does not require as much energy as a narrowband unit.
●
Less interference on other systems. The spread-spectrum signal is transmitted beneath
the noise level. This means that other radio receivers that pick up the signal would
consider it to be “standard” noise and ignore it. The result is that spread-spectrum
transmissions do not generally interfere with other radio transmissions.
●
More information transmitted. Spread-spectrum transmission can send more bits at
one time than a similar narrowband transmission.
●
Increased security. The fact that other radio receivers see spread-spectrum transmissions
as noise and ignore it provides an additional degree of security for spread-spectrum
transmissions in that other radio receivers cannot easily eavesdrop on the transmission.
●
Resistance to multipath distortion. Although not entirely eliminated with spread-
spectrum transmission, the amount of multipath distortion is reduced. This is due to
the low power level at which spread spectrum is transmitted.
Spread-spectrum transmission uses three methods to spread the signal over a wider area. The
methods are frequency-hopping spread spectrum, direct sequence spread spectrum, and
orthogonal frequency division multiplexing.
Frequency-Hopping Spread Spectrum (FHSS) The historical background of
frequency-hopping spread spectrum helps to illustrate this technology. In the early days
of World War II Nazi German warships developed a method for jamming the radios that
guided U.S. torpedoes. Film actress Hedy Lamarr, whose first husband manufactured mili-
tary aircraft control systems, and music composer George Antheil were Hollywood neigh-
bors who happened to strike up a conversation regarding how to prevent torpedoes from
being jammed. Antheil proposed that rapid changes in radio frequencies could be coordi-
nated in much the same way he had coordinated sixteen synchronized player pianos in one
of his music pieces. Within a short time they fleshed out their idea and applied in 1941 for a
patent for a “Secret Communication System.” Their proposed device used slotted paper rolls
similar to player-piano rolls in order to synchronize the frequency changes in a radio trans-
mitter and receiver using 88 frequencies (the same number of keys on a piano). They
received a U.S. patent for their idea the following year.
Although Lamarr and Antheil’s idea was never implemented during
the war, once electronics were cheaply available in the late 1950s
the military used the concept as a basic tool for securing military
communications. However, by this time the patent had expired and
the duo never received any royalties.
Instead of transmitting on a single frequency, frequency-hopping spread spectrum (FHSS)
uses a range of frequencies, called the bandwidth (the difference between the upper and

lower frequencies), that change during the transmission. With FHSS, a short burst is trans-
mitted at one frequency, followed by a short burst transmitted at another frequency, and so
on, until the entire transmission is completed.
Figure 5-3 illustrates how FHSS functions. The transmission starts by sending a burst of
data at the 2.44-GHz frequency for 100 milliseconds (ms or thousandths of a second).
The amount of time that a transmission occurs on a specific frequency is called the dwell
time. The transmission frequency then quickly changes. The time to change is called
the hop time and is measured in microseconds (μs) or millionths of a second. In this
example the frequency is changed to 2.41 GHz and transmits at that frequency for
the next 100 milliseconds. After another hop time (usually about 200 μs) at the third
100 milliseconds the transmission takes place at the 2.42-GHz frequency. This continual
switching of frequencies takes place until the entire transmission is complete. The
sequence of changing frequencies is called the hopping code. In Figure 5-3, the hopping
code is 2.44-2.41-2.42-2.40-2.43.
The receiving station must also know the hopping code in order to
correctly collect the incoming transmissions in the right sequence.

If an FHSS transmission encounters interference on a particular frequency, then that part of the
signal is retransmitted on the next frequency of the hopping code. Figure 5-4 shows that the sec-
ond transmission was interfered with, so it was retransmitted on the frequency that would nor-
mally carry the third transmission. All subsequent transmissions are then moved to the next fre-
quency of the hopping code. Because FHHS transmits short bursts over a wide range of
frequencies, the extent of any interference will be very small and can easily be corrected by
error checking. In addition, FHSS signals will have a minimal interference on other signals.
Frequencies are often listed to the thousandths position, but it can become tedious as well as
error-prone to designate a FHSS hopping code as 2.457-2.422-2.442-2.432. As an alterna-
tive, a numeric value called the channel is assigned to a frequency range and that value is
used instead. (When expressed in this form, the hopping code 2.457-2.422-2.442-2.432
becomes channels 10-3-7-5.) A channel’s frequency range typically has a center frequency,
along with lower and upper limits. For example, Channel 6 may be designated as 2.437
GHz (center), although the actual range for Channel 6 may be from 2.426 GHz (lower) to
2.448 GHz (upper).
Consider a typical television receiving digital transmissions. Instead of
tuning it to video frequency 199.25 MHz and audio frequency
203.75 MHz, it’s much easier instead to just turn to Channel 11,
which has been preset to those frequencies.

The FCC has established restrictions on FHSS to minimize interference between systems. All
FHSS systems in the 900-MHz band must change frequencies or “hop” through 50 channels
and cannot spend more than 400 ms on one frequency over a span of 20 seconds. For trans-
missions in the 2.4-GHz band, FCC restrictions are divided between those devices that use
a minimum of 75 hop channels (called full-channel FHSS) and those that use fewer channels
(reduced-channel FHSS). The specifications for full-channel FHSS include:
●
Peak transmit (TX) power cannot exceed 1 W ( þ30 dBm)
●
Hop channel separation is not less than 25 KHz
●
Hop channels are selected randomly
●
Average dwell time equal on each frequency
●
Maximum dwell time 400 ms (in any 30-second time period)
Due to speed limitations FHSS is not widely implemented in WLAN systems.
Bluetooth technology uses FHSS by dividing the 2.4-GHz frequency
into 79 different frequencies spaced 1 GHz apart. In one second of
Bluetooth transmission the frequency will change 1,600 times, or
once about every 625 μs.
Direct Sequence Spread Spectrum (DSSS) The second type of spread-spectrum
technology is direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS). DSSS uses an expanded redundant
code to transmit each data bit; that is, each bit is converted to a series of bits before being
transmitted. Figure 5-5 illustrates a simplified model of DSSS. In the first frame of the figure
there are three original data bits to be transmitted: 1, 0, and 1. Instead of transmitting these
three bits, a different sequence of bits is inserted, as shown in the middle frame of the figure.
This bit pattern is called the chipping code (a single radio bit is sometimes referred to as a
chip). In this example, the chipping code is 1001: for every original 1 bit the chipping code

of a 1 (1001) is substituted instead. The inverse of that code, 0110, is substituted for the
original 0 bit. (The chipping code in this figure is illustrated using only 4 bits for the sake
of simplicity whereas most DSSS chipping codes are either 11 or 22 bits in length). The
final step is to add the original data bit to the chipping code, as seen in the bottom pane of
the figure, which results in the signal that is transmitted. The addition of the original bit to
the chipping code is accomplished by the Boolean operation of exclusive or (XOR).
When the bits to be transmitted are consecutive 1 bits, an extra 0 is
placed between them in the chipping code so that it becomes
[1001][0][1001], which would result in a transmitted code of [0110]
[1][0110].
There are several advantages to using DSSS:
●
Error correction. With FHSS a single corrupted bit requires that specific bit to be
retransmitted, as illustrated in Figure 5-4 above. DSSS, on the other hand, can recover
the original data using advanced statistical techniques without the need for any
retransmission. DSSS can actually recover from not just one corrupted bit but from
multiple corrupted bits in a transmission.
●
Less interference on other systems. If the DSSS signal is picked up by an unintended
device, the signal will appear as low-powered noise and will be ignored.
●
Shared frequency bandwidth. Using DSSS makes it possible to share the frequency
band with similar devices. Known as colocation, this is achieved by assigning each
device a unique chipping code in order that all the transmissions can use the same
frequency yet remain separate. The transmission of one network would only appear
as noise to another network and would be filtered out.
●
Security. If an eavesdropper picked up the signal of the original data bit, it would be
a simple task to read the message. However, a DSSS transmission that has been
intercepted is far harder to decipher.
The FCC restrictions on DSSS include a maximum output power level
of 1 W and a minimum chipping code of 10 bits.
Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing (OFDM) The third spread-
spectrum technology is orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). Strictly speak-
ing, OFDM is not a spread-spectrum technology. However, because its properties are similar
to that of spread spectrum, OFDM is usually classified as this type of technology. Although
OFDM dates back to the mid-1960s, it has been adopted as the modulation method of
choice for virtually all new wireless technologies used today.
Two basic concepts are involved with OFDM. The first is breaking down the transmission
into separate parts and sending each part in parallel simultaneously. That is, instead of send-
ing one long stream of data as with FHSS or DSSS, OFDM sends the transmission in paral-
lel across several channels. Sending multiple signals simultaneously is called multiplexing.
Consider a single-lane toll road with one toll booth that handles automobile traffic. Cars
would bottleneck every morning and afternoon during rush hour trying to go through the

one toll booth. The solution is not to raise the cars’ speed limit going through the toll booth,
but to add more toll booths on parallel lanes. This in effect is what OFDM does: it uses
multiple transmission paths in parallel for traffic.
The second concept is that these parallel transmissions are sent at a slower rate. Although it
may seem counter-intuitive, OFDM actually increases the overall speed by sending the data
more slowly. Consider again the drivers on the single-lane toll road, when a sudden thun-
derstorm dumps a large amount of water. A driver, finding that her windshield is constantly
being splashed by the driver ahead of her, may decide to slow down (“back off”) enough to
keep a longer distance between her and the car in front to avoid the splashes.
This is the idea behind the slower ODFM transmissions. Because of multipath distortion, the RF
signals (called symbols) bounce off objects such as walls and furniture, delaying them from
reaching the receiver (called delay spread). When they do arrive they interfere with each other
by being “added” to the primary signal, resulting in downfade, corruption, or nulling. This add-
ing is known as intersymbol interference (ISI). Even though a delay, called the guard interval
(GI), is built into the receiver to allow for these late-arriving symbols, those that exceed the
guard interval can still cause ISI. The slower speed used in OFDM allows a symbol to “back
off” from the earliest symbol, thus reducing the risk for signals to arrive “on top” of each other.
In other words, sending a slower signal creates a longer period of time in which the later multi-
path signals can arrive without impacting the earlier signal. OFDM is illustrated in Figure 5-6.
Orthogonal means at a right angle to. The signals in OFDM are
created so they are at right angles to each other, letting them be
closely spaced together yet not causing ISI.

Because OFDM transmissions are sent in parallel, more data can be sent in a given period of
time. And even though the transmissions are sent slower to prevent ISI, overall the total
throughput is increased.
Comparison of Modulation Technologies
Each modulation technology—narrowband, FHSS, DSSS, and OFDM—has its own strengths
and weaknesses.
Narrowband transmissions require more power and are vulnerable to interference from
another radio signal being transmitted at or near the same frequency. Therefore, narrowband
transmissions are not appropriate for WLANs using small APs and even smaller wireless net-
work interface card adapters.
The communication resilience of FHSS transmissions means they are less prone to interfer-
ence from outside signals than DSSS. WLAN systems that use FHSS have the potential for
a higher number of colocation units than DSSS. (As many as 12 to 15 colocated FHSS can
share frequency in a given area as opposed to only three DSSS systems.) Yet DSSS has the
potential for greater transmission speeds over FHSS. FHSS transmits a short burst on one
frequency that is typically only 1 MHz, while DSSS transmits on a frequency that is
22 MHz wide. The amount of data that a DSSS channel can send and receive is much
greater than that of FHSS. DSSS has a potential bandwidth of up to 11 Mbps whereas
FHSS can only transmit at a maximum of 3 Mbps. Because of its higher throughput, DSSS
systems are preferred over FHSS for 802.11b WLANs.
However, the dramatically increased throughput that can be achieved by OFDM has made it
the leader today among the modulation schemes. OFDM is used in IEEE 802.11a/g/n net-
works (not in 802.11 or 802.11b). Because it can support speeds of up to 600 Mbps for
IEEE 802.11n and 54 Mbps for 802.11a/g networks, OFDM is the preferred modulation
technique for faster WLANs.

IEEE wireless standards follow the OSI model with some modifications. The IEEE has divided the
Data Link layer into two sublayers: the Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer, which provides a
common interface, reliability, and flow control, and the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer,
which appends physical addresses to the frame. These are illustrated in Figure 5-7. The reason for
this alteration was to allow higher-level protocols, such as those operating in the Network layer,
to interact with Data Link layer protocols without regard for Physical layer specifications.
The IEEE has also subdivided the Physical layer (PHY) for WLANs into two sublayers, as
seen in Figure 5-8. The Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) sublayer makes up the standards
for both the characteristics of the wireless medium and defines the method for transmitting
and receiving data through that medium. The second sublayer of the PHY layer is the Physical
Layer Convergence Procedure (PLCP) sublayer. The PLCP sublayer performs two basic func-
tions: it reformats the data received from the MAC layer (when transmitting) into a frame that

the PMD sublayer can transmit, as shown in Figure 5-9, and it “listens” to the medium to
determine when the data can be sent.
The IEEE standards specify that the features of a WLAN must be transparent to the upper
layers of the IEEE model. That is, the functions of the PHY and MAC layers should provide
full implementation of all of the WLAN features so that no modifications are needed at any
other layers. This makes the PHY and MAC layers of the IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs
function like those of other IEEE network standards such as Ethernet in sharing the same
LLC layer. Because all of the WLAN features are isolated in the PHY and MAC layers, any
network operating system or LAN application will run on an IEEE WLAN without modifica-
tion. However, in order to accomplish this, the standard requires that some networking
features that are usually associated with higher level layers be performed at the MAC layer
for WLANs.
The specifics of the PMD and PLCP sublayers for IEEE WLANs can be divided into those
that apply to the different IEEE standards: 802.11b, 802.11a, 802.11g, and 802.11n
WLANs.
The original IEEE 802.11 standard of 1997 defined a local area net-
work that provides cable-free data access for clients in a mobile or
fixed location at a rate of up to 2 Mbps using either FHSS or DSSS RF
transmissions or infrared transmissions. Yet due to its slow speed it
never enjoyed widespread favor and was soon replaced by 802.11a/b.
IEEE 802.11b Physical Layer Standards
The basic purpose of the 802.11 PHY layer is to send the signal to the network and receive
the signal from the network. To perform this function the PHY layer is divided into two
parts: the PMD and the PLCP sublayers.
Physical Layer Convergence Procedure Standards The PLCP standards for
802.11b are based on DSSS. The PLCP must reformat the data received from the MAC
layer (when transmitting) into a frame that the PMD sublayer can transmit. A PLCP frame
is illustrated in Figure 5-10.

There is often confusion regarding the terms used to describe data
units. A packet refers to a message sent by protocols operating at the
Network layer of the OSI Reference Model. A datagram is basically the
same as a packet, although the term is also used to refer to a message
sent at a higher level of the OSI. The term frame refers to messages
that travel at low levels of the OSI, while the terms Protocol Data Unit (PDU) and Service Data
Unit (SDU) refer to protocol messages.
The frame is made up of three parts: the preamble, the header, and the data. The preamble
prepares the receiving device for the rest of the frame, whereas the header provides informa-
tion about the frame itself. The data portion of the PLCP frame is the information that is
actually being transmitted. The size of the data or payload can be from 1 to 16,384 bits.
A description of the fields is as follows:

Synchronization. The Synchronization field consists of alternating 0’s and 1’s. It alerts
the receiving device that a message may be on its way so that the receiving device will
then synchronize with the incoming signal.
●
Start Frame Delimiter. The Start Frame Delimiter is always the same bit pattern
(1111001110100000) and it defines the beginning of a frame.
●
Signal Data Rate. The speed of the signal is designated by the Signal Data Rate field.
●
Length. The value of the length of the frame is contained in the Length field.
●
Header Error Check. The Header Error Check field contains a value that the receiving
device can use to determine if the data was received correctly.
●
Data. The data or payload can be from 1 to 16,384 bits, and that value is contained in
this Data field.
The PLCP frame preamble and header are always transmitted at 1 Mbps. This was designed to
allow a slower sending device (like an 802.11) to talk to a faster receiving device (like an
802.11b) by using the slowest speed. The disadvantage of using the lowest common denominator
speed is that two faster devices must still fall back to the 1-Mbps transmission rate for the pream-
ble and header. However, the data can be sent at the faster rate once the connection is established.

Another advantage of the slower PCLP preamble and header trans-
mission speed is that the slower signal can cover a larger area than
a faster signal can.
Physical Medium Dependent Standards Once the PCLP has created the frame, it
then passes it on to the PMD sublayer of the PHY layer. The job of the PMD is to translate
the binary 1’s and 0’s of the frame into radio signals that can be used for transmission. The
PMD can transmit the data at 11, 5.5, 2, or 1 Mbps.
The 802.11b standard uses the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band for its transmis-
sions. The 802.11b standard specifies 14 frequencies that can be used, beginning at 2.412
GHz and incrementing by .005 GHz (except for channel 14). These are listed in Table 5-2.
The United States and Canada use channels 1-11; channels 12-14
are used in Europe, France, and Japan.
IEEE 802.11b transmissions in the 2.4-GHz frequency are designed to be þ /11 MHz
from the channel center frequency. However, some of the transmission may still encroach
onto other frequencies up to 30 MHz from the channel center, so that they actually
consume five overlapping channels. For example, transmitting on channel 6 may cause inter-
ference on channels 5 and 7 as well as limited interference on channels 4 and 8. This leaves

only three nonoverlapping (simultaneously usable) 20-MHz channels—1, 6, and 11—as seen
in Figure 5-11.
The 802.11b standard specifies two different types of modulation to be used. For transmis-
sions at 1 Mbps, a two-level phase shift key (PSK) known as differential binary phase shift
keying (DBPSK) is specified. The phase change for PSK bit 0 is 0 degrees, whereas the
phase change for bit 1 is 180 degrees. For transmissions at 2, 5.5, and 11 Mbps, a four-
level phase change called differential quadrature phase shift keying (DQPSK) is used. Instead
of having only two variations in phases for 0 and 1, the four-level phase change has four
variations in phases for the bit combinations 00, 01, 10, and 11.
The 802.11b standard also outlines the type of DSSS coding to be used. DSSS uses the
expanded redundant code (usually called the Barker code in this context) to transmit each
data bit. The Barker code is used when 802.11b is transmitting at 1 Mbps or 2 Mbps.
However, to transmit at rates above 2 Mbps (known as High-Rate DSSS or HR-DSSS) the
complementary code keying (CCK) technology is used instead. CCK uses a shorter chipping
code (8 bits instead of 11) yet uses different chipping codes for different sequences of bits. This
coding technique consists of a set of 64 8-bit code words. As a set, these code words have
unique mathematical properties that allow them to be correctly distinguished from one another
by a receiver. The 5.5-Mbps rate uses CCK to encode 4 bits per carrier, while the 11-Mbps rate
encodes 8 bits per carrier. Table 5-3 summarizes the IEEE 802.11b Physical layer standards.
IEEE 802.11a Physical Layer Standards
The 802.11a standards are significantly different from the 802.11b standards. The differences
have to do with increasing the speed from 11 Mbps to 54 Mbps, the PLCP frame contents,
and modulation techniques.

Higher Speed Enhancements The 802.11a standards outline a WLAN that operates
at speeds faster than that of 802.11b: up to 54 Mbps (with an optional proprietary speed of
108 Mbps) compared to only 11 Mbps with 802.11b. The differences that allow the IEEE
802.11a standards to achieve these higher speeds are all in the Physical layer. These
enhancements include use of OFDM, using a higher frequency, and utilizing a more efficient
error-correction scheme.
OFDM OFDM offers significant improvements in speed over FHSS or DSSS. OFDM sepa-
rates the transmission into multiple parts and sending each part in parallel simultaneously.
Even though these parallel transmissions are sent more slowly it reduces ISI. A large portion
of the increase in speed in 802.11a is due to the use of OFDM
UNII Frequency Band While the 802.11b standard uses the unlicensed Industrial, Scien-
tific and Medical (ISM) band for its transmissions, the 802.11a standard uses another unli-
censed band, the Unlicensed National Information Infrastructure (UNII). The UNII band is
intended for devices that will provide short-range, high-speed wireless digital communica-
tions. The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) has segmented the 300 MHz of
UNII spectrum into four bands, each with a maximum power limit. These bands and
their maximum power outputs are seen in Table 5-4.
The original IEEE 802.11a standard did not include the UNII-2 Extended
band. In 2003 the FCC added an additional 255 MHz of spectrum in
the 5.470–5.725 band, which increased the amount of spectrum for
802.11a devices by almost 80 percent. This was an attempt to better
harmonize the U.S. spectrum with that of other nations.
The 802.11a standard enables faster rates because of the higher frequencies and increased
power at which it operates. The total bandwidth available for IEEE 802.11a WLANs using
UNII is almost four times that available for 802.11b networks using the ISM band. The
ISM band offers only 83 MHz of spectrum in the 2.4-GHz range while the UNII band offers
300 MHz. However, the range of coverage with 802.11a is less than that of 802.11b.
One of the attractive features of 802.11a is that it uses the 5-GHz
UNII band, which is less cluttered with consumer and business elec-
tronic devices (such as cordless phones, microwave ovens, and Blue-
tooth devices) all transmitting on the same frequency that can cause
interference with 802.11b WLANs. However, a growing number of
devices are using the UNII band that can cause interference.

Not all countries permit transmissions in all of the UNII bands. In addition, the maximum
power output can also vary between countries. Although this is not a problem for WLANs
contained within a single country, multinational companies and individuals who travel inter-
nationally may be required to maintain different networks in different countries.
In order to reduce interference, 802.11a WLANs using UNII also incorporate a technology
known as transmit power control (TPC). An 802.11a AP that supports TPC sends this infor-
mation to the wireless devices and also indicates the maximum transmit power allowed in the
WLAN and the transmit power the AP is currently using. The device then responds with its
own transmit power capability. The AP uses this data to determine the maximum power for
this WLAN network segment. The radio power can be adjusted dynamically to reduce inter-
ference with other devices while still maintaining sufficient power for the WLAN.
Error Correction IEEE 802.11a also handles errors differently than 802.11b, thus achiev-
ing in an increase in speed. First, the number of errors is significantly reduced by the nature
of 802.11a transmissions. Because transmissions are sent over parallel subchannels using
OFDM, radio interference from an outside source is minimized. Instead of the interference
impacting the entire data stream, it will generally only affect one subchannel.
Error correction in 802.11a is also enhanced. Forward Error Correction (FEC) transmits a
secondary copy along with the primary information. Of the 52 subchannels, 48 are used for
standard transmissions and 4 are used for FEC transmissions. If part of the primary transmis-
sion is lost, the secondary copy can be used to recover (through sophisticated algorithms) the
lost data. This eliminates the need to retransmit if an error occurs, which in turn saves time.
Because of its high speed, 802.11a can accommodate the FEC overhead with a negligible
impact on performance.
PLCP Frames The PLCP for 802.11a is based on OFDM instead of DSSS. The PLCP must
reformat the data received from the MAC layer (when transmitting) into a frame that the PMD
sublayer can transmit. An example of an 802.11a PLCP frame is illustrated in Figure 5-12.
Like an 802.11b frame, the 802.11a frame is made up of three parts: the preamble, the
header, and the data. The preamble allows the receiving device to prepare for the rest of
the frame, the header provides information about the frame itself and the data portion of

the PLCP frame is the information that is to actually be transmitted. A description of the
fields is as follows:
●
Synchronization. The Synchronization field consists of 10 repetitions of a short train-
ing sequence signal and two repetitions of a long training sequence signal. The purpose
of these signals is to establish timing and frequency with the receiver. The Synchroni-
zation field is transmitted in 16 microseconds.
●
Rate. The Rate field, which is 4 bits in length, specifies the transmission rate of the
data field. The rate field values are shown in Table 5-5.
●
Length. This field contains the value that indicates the length of the Data field, from
1 to 4095.
●
Parity. Parity is used for error checking.
●
Tail. This field indicates the end of the Header. All 6 bits are all set to zero.
●
Service. The Service field is used to synchronize with the receiver. The first 7 bits are
set to zero while the remaining 9 bits are reserved for future use and are also set to
zero. Although the Service field is part of the header, it is transmitted at the same rate
as the Data field.
●
Data. The actual data to be transmitted is contained in this field. The length of the
data field is from 1 to 4095 bits.
●
Pad. The IEEE standard specifies that the number of bits in the data field must be a
multiple of 48, 96, 192, or 288. If necessary the length of the data field may need to be
“padded” with extra bits, which are found in this field.
Modulation Techniques The modulation techniques used to encode the 802.11a data
vary depending upon the speed:
●
6 Mbps. At this speed, phase shift keying (PSK) is used. The change in the starting
point of the cycle varies depending on if a 0 or a 1 bit is being transmitted, as shown
in Figure 5-13. PSK can encode 125 Kbps of data per each of the 48 subchannels,
resulting in a 6,000 Kbps (125 Kbps  48) or 6 Mbps data rate.

●
12 Mbps. Whereas PSK only has a change in starting point, the type of modulation
used at this speed also has a change in amplitude. Known as quadrature phase shift
keying (QPSK), it can double the amount of data encoded over PSK to 250 Kbps per
channel, which produces a 12-Mbps (250 Kbps x 48) data rate. QPSK is illustrated in
Figure 5-14.
●
24 Mbps. Transmitting at 24 Mbps requires a 16-level quadrature amplitude modula-
tion (16-QAM) technique. 16-QAM has 16 different signals that can be sent, as shown
in Figure 5-15. Whereas QPSK requires two signals to send 4 bits, 16-QAM can
transmit the same in only one signal. For example, to transmit the bits 1110, QPSK
would send 11 and then 10 by modifying the phase and amplitude. 16-QAM would
only send one signal (1110). 16-QAM can encode 500 Kbps per subchannel.
●
54 Mbps. Data rates of 54 Mbps are achieved by using 64-level quadrature amplitude
modulation (64-QAM). 64-QAM, illustrated in Figure 5-16, can transmit 1.125 Mbps
over each of the 48 subchannels.
Although 54 Mbps is the “official” top speed of 802.11a, the IEEE specification also allows
for higher speeds as well. These higher speeds are known as turbo mode or 2X mode. 2X
mode can be developed by each vendor and is not specified in the IEEE standard.

Developers cannot further increase the complexity of the modulation on the subcarriers
beyond the maximum 54-Mbps rate because of the amount of noise allowed. Instead, ven-
dors can use other techniques such as combining frequency channels, increasing and reallo-
cating the individual carriers, and using different coding rate schemes.

Within each 802.11a frequency channel, there is a channel 20 MHz wide that supports
52 carrier signals, with each signal 300 KHz wide, as shown in Figure 5-18. The center
points for the eight channels in this figure are 5.18, 5.20, 5.22, 5.24, 5.26, 5.28, 5.30,
and 5.32 GHz. Table 5-7 shows a list of 802.11a channel frequencies used in the
United States.
The original 802.11a standard specified 12 nonoverlapping channels,
with 4 channels each spread across three areas of usage: indoor,
indoor/outdoor, and outdoor usage. However, these areas were virtu-
ally ignored. A later revision added 11 additional channels.
IEEE 802.11a networks have 555 MHz spread across 23 nonoverlapping channels. Because
there are an increased number of available channels, more users can access more bandwidth
when the WLAN is managed correctly. There are additional advantages of having more
channels. When multiple APs are used, more users can be supported by assigning specific

channels to users associated with specific APs. In addition, if your neighbor is also using his
own 802.11a WLAN within range of your network it could cause interference and band-
width contention. However, the fact that more channels are available means this is not a
problem, because it is possible to set the AP to use a different channel to reduce or eliminate
the interference.
IEEE 802.11g Physical Layer Standards
The 802.11g standard uses the 2.4-GHz ISM frequency instead of the UNII band used by
802.11a. The standard outlines two mandatory modes along with one optional mode. The
first mandatory mode is the same CCK mode used by 802.11b at 11 and 5.5 Mbps. The
second mandatory mode for the faster 54 Mbps, known as extended rate PHYs (ERP),
uses OFDM like the 802.11a standard but still in the 2.4-GHz frequency. The optional
mode can transmit at 22 Mbps and is known as PBCC-22 (Packet Binary Convolutional
Coding), which has speeds between 6 and 54 Mbps. The 802.11g standards are summa-
rized in Table 5-8.
The 802.11g standard provides greater throughput than 802.11b networks and covers a
broader area than 802.11a networks while retaining backward compatibility with 802.11b
devices. However, 802.11g does have some disadvantages. First, it offers only three nonover-
lapping channels, compared to 23 channels for 802.11a. Second, in an environment where
both 802.11b and 802.11g devices are transmitting, all 802.11g devices will drop to only
11 Mbps speeds.

Some vendors are now implementing proprietary techniques that will
allow each device in a “mixed mode” setting of 802.11b and
802.11g devices to transmit at its highest available speed.
IEEE 802.11n Physical Layer Standards
Enhancements to the IEEE 802.11n PHY contribute to the increased speed and range
of 802.11n networks. These enhancements include 40-MHz channels and variable
guard interval. The results can be categorized in the modulation and coding schemes
tables.
40-MHz Channels The bandwidth of the channel determines the speed of the transmis-
sion and is a measure of the efficiency of the radio. This efficiency, known as spectral
efficiency, is measured in the number of bits per Hertz. The IEEE 802.11 and 802.11b
using DSSS have a channel spacing that is 22 MHz wide while 802.11a/g using OFDM have
20-MHz-wide channels. The spectral efficiency of 802.11b is 0.5 bits per Hertz (or 11 Mbps
in 22 MHz), while 802.11a and 802.11g have a higher spectral efficiency, as much as 2.7
bits per Hertz at 54 Mbps.
IEEE 802.11n WLANs can use channels that are either 20 MHz or 40 MHz wide. The
40-MHz channels are actually two adjacent 20-MHz channels that are “bonded” together.
The two channels are known as the primary channel and the secondary channel. Yet instead
of simply doubling the data rate, using a 40-MHz channel can actually increase the rate
even more. Each 20-MHz channel has a small amount of space reserved at the top and the
bottom of the frequency to reduce interference from other channels. Because channel bond-
ing does not need the space between the two bonded channels, it can instead be used to
increase the channel size even more.
Due to regulatory issues, not all countries allow channel bonding 40-
MHz systems.
However, because channel bonding consumes two adjacent channels, it could result in an
increased probability of interference with other WLANs. Although it is unlikely to be a
problem with 802.11n operating in the 5-GHz frequency (it has 23 nonoverlapping chan-
nels), this is not the case when 802.11n is using the 2.4-GHz frequency where only three of
the eleven channels are nonoverlapping. For an 802.11n to use channel bonding it would
consume nine of the eleven channels (the center frequency plus four channels on the left
and four on the right), result in interference with virtually any other 802.11b/g/n 2.4-GHz
network operating in the area.
Two safeguards can protect against interference caused by channel bonding. First,
802.11n WLANs using 40-MHz channels are required to listen for other wireless devices.

The 802.11n AP can automatically move to another channel or switch to 20-MHz oper-
ation if another AP starts operating in either half of the designated 40-MHz channel.
This is known as Dynamic Frequency Selection (DFS). In another option, called Phased
Coexistence Operation (PCO), an 802.11n AP alternates between using 20MHz and 40-
MHz channels.
Variable Guard Interval The guard interval (GI) is a “quiet” period between OFDM
symbols that allows for the arrival of late symbols over long multipaths without impacting
the earlier symbols. IEEE 802.11a/b/n WLANs use 800 nanoseconds as the GI. However, if
the environment does not result in significant multipath then 802.11n can also use a reduced
guard interval of 400 nanoseconds, known as a variable guard interval (VGI). This reduces
the symbol time from 4 microseconds to 3.6 microseconds and can increase the rate of
transmission.
Modulation and Coding Scheme (MCS) The original IEEE 802.11 DSSS trans-
mitted a symbol of 11 chips lasting one microsecond using a phase shift key (PSK) tech-
nique. At 1 Mbps, a single symbol was sent every microsecond. The 2-Mbps rate was
achieved by sending two symbols each microsecond using a four-phase PSK. IEEE
802.11b coded more bits into each symbol using DQPSK in order to achieve data rates of
11 Mbps. For IEEE 802.11a/g, a symbol lasts four microseconds, including an 800 nano-
second GI. For the highest data rate, 54 Mbps, each symbol carries 216 data bits spread
out over 48 subcarriers using 64-QAM.
However, for IEEE 802.11n networks, there are a wide number of options for transmit-
ting. Although it continues to use OFDM and a four-microsecond symbol, similar to
802.11a/g, 802.11n increases the number of subcarriers in each 20-MHz channel from
48 to 52. (This marginally increases the data rate to a maximum of 65 Mbps for a single-
transmit radio in IEEE 802.11n.) The IEEE 802.11n standard allows a selection of eight
data rates for a transmitter to use and also increases the number of transmitters allowable
to four. When using 40-MHz channels, 802.11n increases the number of subcarriers avail-
able to 108. Similarly, eight data rates are provided for each transmitter for the 40-MHz
channel.
In total there are 77 possible combinations of these factors—modulation, convolutional
coding rate (a type of error-correcting code), guard interval, channel width, and number of
spatial streams—for 802.11n. The IEEE standard defines a Modulation and Coding Scheme
(MCS) that outlines the different combinations and assigns an index number to each
scheme. MCS 0–31 define the same modulation and coding that is used on all streams,
while MCS 32–76 describe mixed combinations that can be used to modulate two
to four streams (for example, MCS 33 defines using 16-QAM on spatial stream #1 and
QPSK on stream #2 while MCS 77 refers to using 64-QAM on streams #1–3 with 16-
QAM on stream #4). All 802.11n APs are required to support at least MCS 0–15, while
802.11n wireless devices must support MCS 0–7. All other MCS values, including those
associated with 40-MHz channels and VGI, are optional. A partial MCS table is shown
in Table 5-9.

Chapter Summary
■Radio frequency signals that are transmitted on only one frequency are called narrow-
band transmissions. Several disadvantages of narrowband transmissions for WLANs
make it unusable. An alternative to narrowband transmission is spread-spectrum
transmission. Whereas a narrowband transmission sends a strong signal using a small
portion of the spectrum, spread spectrum transmits a weaker signal across a broader
portion of the radio frequency band. Spread-spectrum transmission uses three methods
to spread the signal over a wider area. The methods are frequency-hopping spread
spectrum (FHSS), direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS), and orthogonal frequency
division multiplexing (OFDM). Instead of transmitting on a single frequency, FHSS
uses a range of frequencies. DSSS uses an expanded redundant code to transmit each

data bit. OFDM breaks the transmission into separate parts to send each part in par-
allel simultaneously. These parallel transmissions are sent more slowly to minimize the
impact of delay spread.
■IEEE wireless standards follow the OSI model with some modifications. The IEEE
has divided the Data Link layer into two sublayers: the Logical Link Control
(LLC) sublayer (which provides a common interface, reliability, and flow control)
and the Media Access Control (MAC) sublayer (which appends physical addresses
to the frame). The IEEE standards specify that the features of a WLAN must be
transparent to the upper layers of the IEEE model so that the PHY and MAC
layers of the IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs function like those of other IEEE
network standards (such as Ethernet) in sharing the same LLC layer. Because
all of the WLAN features are isolated in the PHY and MAC layers, any network
operating system or LAN application will run on an IEEE WLAN without
modification.
■For IEEE 802.11b the PLCP standards are based on DSSS. The 802.11b standard uses
the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band for its transmissions and specifies
14 frequencies that can be used, beginning at 2.412 GHz and incrementing by
.005 GHz. These transmissions in the 2.4-GHz frequency are designed to be
þ /–11 MHz from the channel center frequency. This results in only three nonoverlap-
ping (simultaneously usable) 20-MHz channels: 1, 6, and 11.
■The 802.11a standards are significantly different from the 802.11b standards. While
the 802.11b standard uses the unlicensed Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band
for its transmissions, the 802.11a standard uses another unlicensed band, the Unli-
censed National Information Infrastructure (UNII). The 802.11a standard enables
faster rates because of the higher frequencies and increased power at which it operates.
The total bandwidth available for IEEE 802.11a WLANs using UNII is almost four
times that available for 802.11b networks using the ISM band. IEEE 802.11a also
handles errors differently than 802.11b, which results in an increase in speed. Within
each 802.11a frequency channel there is a channel 20 MHz wide that supports 52
carrier signals, each 300 KHz wide. IEEE 802.11a networks have 555 MHz spread
across 23 nonoverlapping channels. Because of the increased number of available
channels, more users can access more bandwidth when the WLAN is managed
correctly.
■The 802.11g standard uses the 2.4-GHz ISM frequency instead of the UNII band used
by 802.11a. The 802.11g standard provides greater throughput than 802.11b net-
works and covers a broader area than 802.11a networks while retaining backward
compatibility with 802.11b devices. However, 802.11g does have some disadvantages.
First, the number of nonoverlapping channels available is still only three with 802.11g
compared with eight channels for 802.11a. Second, in an environment where both
802.11b and 802.11g devices are transmitting, all 802.11g devices will drop to only
11 Mbps speeds.
■Enhancements to the IEEE 802.11n PHY contribute to the increased speed and range
of 802.11n networks. IEEE 802.11n WLANs can use channels that are either 20 MHz
or 40 MHz wide. The 40-MHz channels are actually two adjacent 20-MHz channels
that are “bonded” together. There are two safeguards to protect against the interfer-
ence as a result of channel bonding. While IEEE 802.11a/b/n WLANs use 800

nanoseconds as the guard interval, if the environment does not result in significant
multipath then 802.11n can also use a reduced guard interval of 400 nanoseconds,

One of the key elements of OFDM is its use of multiplexing. Multiplexing is commonly
found in different telecommunications technologies. Using the Internet, research the topic of
multiplexing. Where is it used? Why is it chosen? What can multiplexing save in transmis-
sions? Write a one-page paper about your research.
Case Project 5-3: Combating Interference
What steps should you take when radio frequency interference impacts an IEEE 802.11 net-
work? Using the Internet and other sources, research preventive measures for reducing inter-
ference from such transmitters as cordless telephones, microwave ovens, and WLAN signals
from a neighbor’s system. Create a paper that lists the different potential sources and inter-
ference and what can be done to mitigate them.
Case Project 5-4: Channel Bonding
While 802.11n can make adjustments if channel bonding impacts another WLAN,
802.11a/g does not have these capabilities. If your upstairs apartment neighbor is using
channel bonding and your downstairs neighbor is using the other channel, you could have
no available frequency for your AP. How would you handle this situation? Should you be
able to claim that their equipment is encroaching upon your airspace? Using the Internet
and other sources, research this dilemma. What is your opinion on this controversy? How
would you handle a situation like this?
Case Project 5-5: Nautilus IT Consulting
Nautilus IT Consulting (NITC), the computer technology business that helps organizations
with IT solutions, has asked for your help.
Craig’s Discount Furniture is considering migrating to IEEE 802.11n, but one of the com-
pany’s IT staff members states that the benefits of 802.11n do not outweigh the time and
expense it would take to upgrade from 802.11g. Although some of the IT staff say that
802.11n has advantages, they are unsure exactly what these advantages are and if they
would be useful to the organization. You have been asked to create a presentation compar-
ing 802.11n with 802.11g.
1. Create a PowerPoint presentation of eight or more slides that compares 802.11n and
802.11g. Be sure to include the technical reasons behind the 802.11n enhancements.
Because you will be addressing the IT staff, this presentation should contain technical
information.
2. After your presentation, Craig’s Discount Furniture is leaning towards implementing
802.11n. However, they are unsure which of the variations of 802.11n they should use
for their warehouse, which covers 30,000 square feet yet is essentially open with no
interior walls. Using the MCS, decide on an 802.11n technology that would be most
appropriate for this setting. Create a one-page memo that summarizes your choice and
explains why Craig’s Discount Furniture should explore this option.

Since the ratification of the IEEE 802.11n standard in September 2009, the number of
802.11n devices sold has increased much faster than first anticipated. Less than one
year after its ratification, almost 1,700 “N” devices were certified by the Wi-Fi
Alliance, including not only access points (APs) but also telephone handsets, digital
cameras, and even flat-panel TVs. IEEE 802.11a/b/g devices were outsold by 802.11n
devices by almost 40,000 units in a three-month time span in mid-2010. In fact,
during the first half of 2010, over 420,000 802.11n APs were sold in North America,
compared to 520,000 units in all of 2009.
And who is leading the way in the purchase and installation of 802.11n devices?
The answer is colleges and universities. The primary reason is because of the expecta-
tions of today’s students. Many students have never connected their laptop to a
wired network with an Ethernet patch cable, yet they expect to have universal net-
work access to play games, watch online videos, and even do the occasional home-
work assignment. In addition, most students have multiple wireless devices—game
consoles, smartphones, tablets, printers, and Internet alarm clocks—that all require
constant wireless access.
This is creating a dramatic change in the design and installation of campus net-
works. Today’s WLANs at colleges and universities are mission-critical production net-
works that are optimized for high capacity as well as high performance. These campus
WLANs are designed to be the primary data network for students and faculty, re-
placing wired Ethernet. This has resulted in a significant decrease in the use of wired
Ethernet ports. At Carnegie Mellon University in Pennsylvania the school has deacti-
vated all wired ports in each of its dorm rooms (students can still request a wired
port). Brandeis University in Massachusetts renovated four student dormitories and
only provides 802.11n wireless connectivity for their students. The estimated cost for
rewiring the four dorms was $200,000, while the actual cost of installing the wireless
network was less than $80,000 due to savings in capital, licensing, maintenance, and
operations. Many schools are focusing on capacity over coverage, designing the net-
work for a maximum of 15 clients per AP in order to provide adequate data rates.
However, WLANs have grown overburdened as more students bring wireless gear
onto campus and use it for high-capacity downloads or watching movies. Some
schools are looking at transmit beam forming as an option to improve performance,
while others are utilizing techniques to exploit 802.11n’s multiple antennas for
improved signal reliability to give users a more consistent signal without fading or
dropping. New IEEE 802.11 amendments that address power management to
improve battery life, improve support for location data, and give wireless devices
more “intelligence” to work with APs to improve signal quality may also help.

As you learned in the last chapter, the IEEE 802.11 standard specifies that all WLAN features
are implemented in the PHY and MAC layers. Isolating all of the WLAN functions in the bot-
tom two layers of the IEEE 802.11 standard does not mean that new features cannot be
added to the existing upper layers; a new feature can be added as long as it does not modify
the two lower layers. Because no modifications are needed at any of the other layers, existing
software designed to meet other IEEE 802 standards will correctly operate on 802.11
WLANs. Any network operating system or LAN application that functions on a standard
LAN will also run on a WLAN without modification. One of the original reasons for this
design was to enable support for a wide range of protocols, including Novell IPX/SPX, Micro-
soft NetBEUI, and AppleTalk, but since TCP/IP has become the standard network protocol
this is no longer the “selling point” that it once was.
In this chapter you will learn about the three types of WLAN configurations. You will also
look in detail at the IEEE 802.11 MAC layer standard that implements WLAN features.
WLAN Service Sets
C W N A
3.1.2. Define, describe, and apply the following concepts associated
with WLAN service sets.
3.2.2. Identify methods described in the IEEE 802.11-2007 standard
for locating, joining, and maintaining connectivity with an IEEE
802.11 WLAN.
A service set is all of the devices that are associated with an 802.11 WLAN. There are three
different wireless LAN service set configurations: the basic service set, the extended service
set, and the independent basic service set.
Basic Service Set
A Basic Service Set (BSS) is defined as one or more wireless client devices (called stations or
STAs) that are served by a single AP. These devices send all transmissions to the AP as well
as receive transmissions from it. Although by definition it is not required that the AP be
connected to another network, practically speaking the BSS would have limited functionality
if the AP were not connected: the stations would only be able to communicate between each
other but not to any other devices or networks outside the BSS. A BSS with one AP connected
to a wired network is shown in Figure 6-1.
The BSS must be assigned a unique identifier to differentiate it from other WLANs. This
“logical network name” is known as the Service Set Identifier (SSID) and is created by the
administrator of the WLAN. The Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) is a separate identifier
that is the media access control (MAC) address of the AP. The BSSID is included in the
header of frames that are transmitted by the AP and stations for a variety of identification
purposes.
The SSID can be an alphanumeric string from 2– 32 characters long.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

The physical area of radio frequency (RF) coverage provided by the AP of a BSS is called a
Basic Service Area (BSA). The advertised BSA of an 802.11b network states that a station
can be up to 375 feet (114 meters) away from the AP. IEEE 802.11g networks have a similar
BSA to 802.11b networks, 802.11a networks have a smaller BSA, and 802.11n networks
have a larger BSA.
However, whereas the BSA is the geographical limit of the RF signal, it is not always the
same as the practical coverage area of a BSS. This is because there are several factors that
can impact the practical distance a station can be away from the AP and still have an accept-
able throughput. These factors include:
●
Obstructions. Walls, doors, ceilings, elevators, and other signal obstructions can limit
the distance the RF signal may travel.
●
Number of users. Because all devices in the BSS share the same medium (similar to an
Ethernet network using a hub instead of a switch), having too many users in a single
BSS can result in poor throughput rates.
●
Applications. A wireless user reading text-based e-mail consumes less bandwidth than
a user watching a high-definition movie on a WLAN. Due to the fact that the medium
is shared, this can have an impact on throughput.
●
Distance from AP. As a mobile device moves farther away from the AP the transmis-
sion speed decreases. Known as dynamic rate switching, this allows a station to remain
connected albeit at a slower speed. This means that a wireless mobile user on the edge
of the BSA will have a slower connection speed than a user closer to the AP.
A general rule is 15–25 users per BSS.

Extended Service Set
The two limitations of a BSS—a relatively small number of users being confined to a small
geographical area—can be overcome with an Extended Service Set (ESS). An ESS is com-
prised of two or more BSS networks that are interconnected. By using multiple APs an ESS
can accommodate additional users over a wider area, as seen in Figure 6-2. In an ESS a
group of APs are configured with the same SSID (logical network name) to create a single
distributed WLAN.
Because these APs form a single logical network they must exist in
one Layer 2 broadcast domain so that when any station sends a
message it goes to all other stations in the WLAN.
The APs in an ESS should be positioned so that the cells overlap to facilitate the movement
between cells known as roaming. When a user carrying a wireless device enters into the range
of more than one AP the station will choose an AP based on signal strength or packet error
rates. Once that station is accepted by the AP it “tunes” to the radio channel at which the AP is
transmitting. The station continues to survey the appropriate radio frequencies at regular inter-
vals to determine if a different AP can provide better service. If it finds one (perhaps because the
user has moved closer to it) then the station associates with the new AP (this process is called a
handoff), tuning to the different radio frequency of the new AP. To the user it is seamless
because there has not been an interruption of service. This is known as Layer 2 roaming.
One of the weaknesses of the IEEE 802.11 standard is that it does
not specify how a handoff should take place. Because roaming
between APs of different vendors can sometimes be a problem,
some industry experts recommend that all APs in an ESS be from
the same vendor.

However, if a router separates the APs and each AP resides in a separate subnet, as illus-
trated in Figure 6-3, this may cause problems. When a user roams from one AP coverage
area to another then a new IP address must be assigned. Connectivity can be temporarily
lost and running applications may have to be restarted. This is called Layer 3 roaming.
One way to roam between APs that are separated by a router is to implement Mobile IP.
Mobile IP provides a mechanism within the TCP/IP protocol to better support mobile com-
puting. With Mobile IP, computers are given a home address, which is a static IP number
on their home network. The computer also has a home agent, which is a forwarding mecha-
nism that keeps track of where the mobile computer is located. When the computer roams to
another network (called the foreign network) a foreign agent provides routing services to the
mobile computer. The foreign agent assigns the mobile computer a new—yet temporary—IP
number. This new IP number is known as the care-of address. The computer then registers
the care-of address with its home agent, as shown in Figure 6-4.
When a frame is sent to the computer’s home address, the home agent intercepts the frame. It
then encapsulates (or tunnels) that frame into a new frame with the care-of address as the des-
tination address. It then redirects it to the foreign agent, which sends it on to the computer now

located on the foreign network. This process is shown in Figure 6-5. Mobile IP enables a host
to be identified by a single IP number even as it moves from one network to another. This
movement is seamlessly achieved without the intervention or the knowledge of either the
mobile user or the sending computer.
Mobile IP was the first protocol to offer transparent mobility.
The means by which multiple BSS networks in an ESS share information is through the
distribution system (DS). The DS is how an AP determines what communication needs to
take place with other APs in the ESS or with the wired network. The DS decides if it is neces-
sary to exchange frames for stations in their own BSSs, to exchange frames with a wired
network (typically through the Ethernet switch to which each AP is connected), or to forward
frames to another BSS (to follow stations as they roam from one BSS to another). The
distribution system media can be a wired network to which the APs are connected, a wireless
radio within the APs, or even a special purpose device that interconnects the APs and
provides the required distribution services. A wireless configuration that is used to connect
the APs is called a wireless distribution system (WDS).
A DS is not a network; rather, it is a thin layer in each AP that
determines the destination for traffic received from a BSS. The DS
decides if traffic should be relayed back to a station in the same
BSS, forwarded through the distribution system media to another
AP, or sent to the wired network to a destination not in the ESS.
Independent Basic Service Set
Both BSS and ESS operate in what is called infrastructure mode since stations communicate
through an AP. An Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS) is a wireless network that does not
use an AP and thus cannot connect to another network. In this type of network, which is
also known as peer-to-peer or ad hoc mode, wireless devices communicate directly between
themselves, as seen in Figure 6-6.

The different service sets have their own applications for different uses. An IBSS is useful for
quickly and easily setting up a wireless network anywhere that users need to share data
between themselves but do not need a connection to the Internet or an external network.
For example, an IBSS is useful when a wireless user needs to quickly send a last-minute
document to an associate in a hotel meeting room. A BSS has the flexibility to connect users
to wired networks. An ESS provides the greatest range of functions: it allows more users to
cover a broader wireless area as well as connect to external networks.

IEEE wireless standards follow the Open Systems Interconnection (OSI) model with some
modifications. The IEEE has divided the Data Link layer into two sublayers: the Logical
Link Control (LLC) sublayer, which provides a common interface, reliability, and flow
control, and the Medium Access Control (MAC) sublayer, which appends physical
addresses to the frame. The functions that are performed at the MAC sublayer involve
different frame formats and types.
MAC Frame Formats
Information regarding the MAC frame formats generally focuses on the data units and issues
that involve interoperability.
Data Units The OSI model uses the term data unit to describe the sets of data that move
through the OSI layers. A Service Data Unit (SDU) describes a specific unit of data that has
been passed down from a higher OSI layer to a lower layer but has not yet been encapsu-
lated by that lower layer. A Protocol Data Unit (PDU) specifies the data that will be sent to

the peer protocol layer at the receiving device instead of that being sent to a lower layer level
(an SDU). Thus the PDU at a given layer is the SDU of the layer below. The process of
changing an SDU to a PDU involves an encapsulation process in which the lower layer
adds headers, footers, or both to the SDU to transform it into a PDU.
The SDU can be thought of as the payload of a given PDU.
Figure 6-7 illustrates the process in an 802.11 network using SDUs and PDUs. The
steps are:
1. The Network Layer (Layer 3) sends data to the LLC sublayer of the Data Link Layer
(Layer 2). This data unit is called the MAC Service Data Unit (MSDU) and contains data
from Layers 3-7 along with LLC data.
2. The LLC then sends that data unit to the MAC sublayer where the MAC header
information is then added. This data unit becomes the MAC Protocol Data Unit
(MPDU), sometimes known as simply an IEEE 802.11 frame.
3. When the MPDU is sent to the Physical Layer Convergence Procedure (PLCP) sublayer
in the Physical Layer (Layer 1), it is then called the PLCP Service Data Unit (PSDU).
4. The PSDU is then passed to the Physical Medium Dependent (PMD) sublayer that
creates the PLCP Protocol Data Unit (PPDU) by adding a header and other data to it.
5. The PPDU is then transmitted as a series of bits to the receiving device.
When discussing data units, remember that a binary digit or bit is a 1
or 0 while a byte is usually eight bits. However, since a byte is not
eight bits in all computer systems, octet is sometimes used instead to
refer to a true sequence of eight bits.

The IEEE 802.11n standard adds an additional element to data units to increase throughput.
Figure 6-8 shows a series of frames that are being transmitted from an Ethernet wired
network to an AP, and the destination for each of these frames is the same wireless device.
Although the data payload will be unique for each frame, other parts of the frame (PHY
Preamble, PLCP Header, MAC Header, and Trailer) are “overhead” and contain informa-
tion that may not change for each frame. However, because the overhead is transmitted
with each frame this takes additional time.
The 802.11n adds a feature to reduce the amount of overhead transmitted and thus increase
overall throughput. Aggregate MAC Service Data Unit (A-MSDU) allows multiple MSDUs
to be combined (aggregated) together. All MSDUs within the single A-MSDU must be
addressed to the same receiver. Aggregate MAC Protocol Data Unit (A-MPDU) allows multi-
ple MPDUs to be aggregated together. Like A-MSDU, the MPDUs within the single A-MPDU
must be addressed to the same receiver. Figure 6-9 illustrates A-MSDU and A-MPDU.

Interoperability It is important for different systems to be able to understand each
other, that is, to have interoperability. The primary areas of interoperability for WLANs
are in two particular areas: 802.11 interoperating 802.3 frame types, and high-throughput
(HT) devices interoperating with non-HT slower speed wireless networks.
IEEE 802.11 and 802.3 Frames Because most WLANs operate in infrastructure mode
(either BSS or ESS), it is important that the 802.11 frames of a wireless network interoperate
with an 802.3 Ethernet network. Because these wireless and wired networks share a common
IEEE 802 foundation, the frames share a similar format.
Besides interoperating with 802.3 Ethernet networks, an 802.11
frame can also function on an 802.5 Token Ring network.
One area of difference between 802.11 and 802.3 is the frame size, known as maximum
transmission unit (MTU). The MTU of an Ethernet 802.3 frame is 1,500 bytes while the
MTU of an 802.11 frame is 2,304 bytes. The A-MSDU increases the MTU to 7,935 while
A-MPDU allows up to 64k bytes.
MTU is not the same as the TCP value maximum segment size
(MSS). The MSS name is actually misleading because it refers to
the maximum amount of data that a segment can hold and does
not include the TCP headers. Whereas MTU is the size of the entire
packet, MSS is the size of the payload. In some consumer broad-
band routers and game consoles the parameter that is called MTU is in fact MSS.
The differences in frame size can be easily addressed to provide interoperability between the
networks. The three major options are:
●
Fragmentation. If an IP layer receives a message to be sent across the network it looks
at the size of the message and then computes how large the IP frame would be after
adding its additional header information. If the total length is longer than what can be
accommodated, the frame is fragmented into multiple frames.
●
Jumbo frames. A network interface adapter can be configured to accept frames that
are larger than 1,500 bytes yet less than 9,000 bytes. This is known as jumbo frame
support. However, in order to minimize fragmentation all devices on the network
would need to be set to the same size, including any switches and networking
equipment.
●
Lowest common denominator. Most wireless devices automatically set the default
MTU at the lowest common denominator of 1,500 bytes.
Another difference between 802.11 and 802.3 frames is the
number of address fields. An 802.3 frame has only a Source
Address (SA) and a Destination Address (DA), while an 802.11
frame has additional fields. However, this causes no interoperability
issues.

IEEE 802.11n HT and 802.11a/b/g Because of the significant differences between high-
throughput (HT) 802.11n and non-HT 802.11a/b/g, an 802.11n AP can tell 802.11n
wireless devices to change “on the fly” to one of four HT Operation Modes in order to
interoperate with slower devices. These modes are:
●
HT Greenfield Mode (Mode 0). In Greenfield Mode all of the stations in the BSS or
ESS are 802.11n devices operating at the same HT speed with the same parameters. If
an 802.11a/b/g device should roam into this BSA it would not be able to access the
WLAN.
●
HT Nonmember Protection Mode (Mode 1). The HT Nonmember Protection Mode is
the “legacy” mode of transmitting. All stations—including 802.11n—use the
802.11a/b/g format to ensure backwards compatibility. None of the HT enhancements
are utilized.
●
HT 20 MHz Protection Mode (Mode 2). All of the stations in the HT 20 MHz
Protection Mode are 802.11n HT devices. If a 20-MHz-only HT device associates to
a 20/40-MHz AP, then protection must be used to prevent the 20-MHz-only station
from transmitting at the same time.
●
HT Mixed Mode (Mode 3). Both 802.11n and 802.11a/b/g devices can inter-
operate in the same BSA in HT Mixed Mode. Although this enables backwards
compatibility, it does so at a price. The HT 802.11n devices must transmit a legacy
format preamble followed by an HT format preamble. The legacy preamble tells the
802.11a/b/g devices to avoid transmitting over the HT frames that are sent to and
from the 802.11n devices. Although sending two preambles adds additional over-
head, it still allows the HT stations to take advantage of HT features.
MAC Frame Types

of bytes in the frame, and tell what speeds the sending device supports. Within the Data sec-
tion of the PLCP frame is the MAC frame. The first three fields (Frame Control, Duration/
ID, and Address 1) and the last field (FSS) are required in all MAC frames; the other fields
(Address 2, Address 3, Sequence Control, Address 4, QoS Control, and Frame Body) are
present only in certain frame types and subtypes.
There are three main types of MAC frames. These are management frames, control frames,
and data frames.
Management Frames Management frames are used to set up the initial communica-
tions between a device and the AP (for infrastructure mode) or between stations (for ad hoc
mode), and then maintain the connection. This is necessary because of the dynamic nature
of a WLAN in which a station needs to locate an AP in its territory and then access the
WLAN as well as eventually disconnect from the network, all of which requires multiple
exchanges of frames.
On a wired network the type of management for a WLAN is not
necessary.
The format of a management frame is illustrated in Figure 6-11. The Frame control
field contains information such as the current version number of the standard and if
encryption is being used. The Duration field contains the number of microseconds
needed to transmit; this value will vary depending upon which mode of wireless trans-
mission is being used. The Address 1 (Destination address) and Address 2 (Source
address) fields contain the addresses of the receiving and sending devices, respectively.
The Sequence control field contains the sequence number for the packet and packet
fragment number.
Some of the types of management frames and their functions include:
●
Authentication frame. An authentication frame is used by the access point in deter-
mining whether to accept or reject a wireless device from entering the network.
●
Association request frame. An association request frame allows an AP to allocate
resources for a wireless device.
●
Association response frame. When an AP accepts or rejects a wireless device it sends
an association response frame.

●
Beacon frame. An AP regularly transmits a beacon frame to announce its presence and
send wireless information to all devices that are within range.
●
Deauthentication frame. A device sends a deauthentication frame to another device if
it wants to end a communication.
●
Disassociation frame. A wireless device sends a disassociation frame to another device
if it wishes to end the connection.
●
Probe request frame. A device sends a probe request frame when it needs to obtain
information from another device.
●
Probe response frame. After it receives a probe request frame, a device will respond
with a probe response frame containing capability information, supported data
rates, etc.
●
Reassociation request frame. If a wireless device roams into a different cell it sends a
reassociation request frame to the new AP.
●
Reassociation response frame. After it receives a reassociation request frame, an access
point sends a reassociation response frame containing an acceptance or rejection notice
to the wireless device requesting reassociation.
Control Frames Control frames are the second type of MAC frame. After the connec-
tion among the stations and AP is established, control frames provide assistance in deliver-
ing frames that contain the data by controlling access to the medium. One type of control
frame is illustrated in Figure 6-12.
Data Frames The third type of MAC frame is the data frame, which carries the informa-
tion to be transmitted to the destination device. The format of a data frame is illustrated in
Figure 6-13. The fields Address 1, Address 2, Address 3 and Address 4 contain the address
of the BSSID, the destination address, the source address, the transmitter address or the
receiver address. Their contents vary, depending upon the mode of transmission.

Because data frames contain the actual information that is being
transmitted, such as an e-mail message, the content of the data

The MAC layer plays a role in several functions in a WLAN. These functions can be broken
into three classifications: discovering a WLAN, joining the WLAN, and transmitting on a
WLAN.
Discovering the WLAN
The first major function of the MAC layer involves defining procedures for a station to dis-
cover a WLAN. When a station is powered on or roams into an area of wireless coverage, it
must find the AP. This means that the AP must transmit the appropriate information and the
station must be looking for that information. This discovery process can be done by passive
scanning or active scanning.
Because ESS WLANs are by far the most common types of networks,
the study of the MAC operations will focus on these types of wire-
less networks.
Passive Scanning Passive scanning depends upon the AP “advertising” itself. At
regular intervals, the AP sends a beacon frame to both announce its presence and to
provide the necessary information for wireless stations wanting to join the network.
This process is known as beaconing. The beacon frame provides the “pulse” of the wire-
less network and is an orderly means for stations to establish and also maintain
communications.
A beacon frame is a type of management frame and its format follows the standard struc-
ture of a management frame. The Destination address is always set to all ones (or
255.255.255.255 in dotted decimal notation), which is the standard IP broadcast address

for a network or a segment (for example, if the segment IP network address is 199.93.29.0
then the broadcast address would be 199.93.29.255). This forces all stations to receive and
process each beacon frame.
The body of the beacon frame contains the following fields:
●
Beacon interval. The beacon interval tells the amount of time between beacon
transmissions.
●
Timestamp. The timestamp value forces all wireless stations to update their local clock
and thus synchronize with the access point.
●
SSID. The SSID identifies a specific wireless LAN.
●
Supported rates. The beacon frame carries information that lists the transmission rates
that a particular wireless LAN supports.
●
Parameter sets. Information about which wireless modulation scheme is being used
(such as frequency-hopping spread spectrum or direct sequence spread spectrum) along
with information about that scheme (such as the hopping pattern and dwell time for a
FHSS network).
●
Capability information. Capability information provides the requirements of the
wireless stations if they want to connect to this wireless network.
In an ad hoc network with no APs, each wireless station assumes
the responsibility for sending a beacon. After receiving a beacon
frame, each station first waits the amount of time specified in the
beacon interval. Then each station waits an additional random
delay time, and the station that completes its random delay time
first will then send the next beacon frame. This random delay time rotates the responsibility
for sending beacons to all wireless stations.
The beacon interval is normally sent once every 100 milliseconds (ms), although it can
be modified. Increasing the beacon interval (and thus decreasing the number of beacon
frames transmitted) can decrease wireless network traffic but may result in problems
when roaming because timely information about availability of the network can be
missed. Decreasing the beacon interval (and increasing the rate of beacons) makes the
roaming

faster

network
traffic
and

overall
throughput.
If a beacon frame is delayed because of other network traffic, the
actual time between beacons may be longer than the beacon inter-
val. However, wireless stations can compensate by resynchronizing
with the timestamp in the next beacon.
As the AP transmits it beacon frame, the station is looking for those frames. This process is
known as passive scanning. With passive scanning, a station changes to the different chan-
nels that it supports and listens for a beacon frame for a set period of time. Once a station
receives a beacon frame with the SSID, it can then attempt to join the network. On ESS
wireless networks with multiple access points, the station might actually receive beacon

frames from several APs. In this case, the wireless device would generally attempt to join the
network with the strongest signal strength.
While a station is performing a channel scan it cannot transmit or
receive data traffic. To minimize this impact, when not actively trans-
mitting data many stations will continually scan for incoming bea-
cons. Or, they might scan only a single alternate channel one at a
time. This continual scanning allows the station to create a real-time
inventory of all available APs so that the information is immediately available if it roams into
the range of another AP or if it becomes disconnected it can quickly reconnect to the WLAN.
Active Scanning The second type of scanning is active scanning. In active scanning, the
station first sends out a management probe request frame on an available channel. This
probe request frame can be a directed probe that contains a specific SSID that the device is
searching for (only APs with a matching SSID will reply with a probe response) or it can be
broadcast probe with a null value as the SSID (all APs will respond). Active scanning is illus-
trated in Figure 6-14. Like the beacon frame, the probe response frame has the information
the station needs to connect to the wireless LAN.
The difference between passive scanning and active scanning essen-
tially comes down to which device initiates the discovery. In passive
scanning, the AP starts the process by sending out a frame that says
“Here I am,” while in active scanning the station sends out a frame
that says, “Is anybody out there?”
Joining the WLAN
Once a wireless device discovers the WLAN, it next requests to join the network. This is a
two-fold process known as authentication and association.

Sometimes a behavior model or mathematical abstraction can be
used to illustrate and trace the flow of the authentication and associ-
ation processes. This behavior model is called finite-state machine
(FSM) or just a state machine.
Authentication In a standard wired LAN, a user sits down at a desktop computer con-
nected to the network by a patch cable and then logs into the network with a username and
password. The user is authenticated after the network device is already connected to the net-
work. This is because physical access to the wired network can be restricted by walls and
locked doors and only authorized devices are assumed to be connected to the network.
However, because wireless LANs cannot limit access to the RF signal by walls or doors,
wireless authentication requires the wireless device (and not the individual user) to be
authenticated prior to being connected to the network. IEEE 802.11 authentication is a
process in which the AP accepts a station.
Two types of authentication are supported by the 802.11 standard. Open system authentication
is the basic (and the default) method. After discovering the network through passive
scanning or active scanning and receiving the necessary information, the wireless device
sends an association request frame to the AP, which contains information such as the
WLANs SSID and the data rates that the device can support. After receiving the association
request, the AP then responds with an association response frame, which contains either an
acceptance or rejection notice. Open system authentication is virtually a “handshake”
between the AP and station in which the station establishes its identity (but the AP does
not) and is illustrated in Figure 6-15.
A second type of authentication method (which is optional) is shared key authentication.
With shared key authentication, both the AP and the station are given the same key
value in advance. (In other words, they “share” the key value.) The station first sends
an authentication frame to the AP, and the AP responds with an authentication frame

that contains a block of text known as the challenge text. The station must encrypt the
text with its key value and return it to the AP in an authentication frame. The AP will
then decrypt what was returned with its own key to see if it matches the original chal-
lenge text. If it does, the AP sends an authentication frame signifying the result of the
authentication. Shared key authentication is based upon the fact that only preapproved
wireless devices have been given the shared key. Shared key authentication is illustrated
in Figure 6-16.
Both types of authentication are weak. With open system authenti-
cation, the wireless device only has to know the SSID in order to be
authenticated. The SSID can easily be retrieved from another authen-
ticated device or even from the AP itself if it uses passive scanning.
In addition, the SSID is initially transmitted in an unencrypted form,
so an attacker could capture those wireless packets and view the SSID. The weakness of
shared key authentication is that the key must be installed manually on each wireless device,
and managing a secret key for all wireless devices can leave the door open for the key to be
uncovered.
Association Once a wireless device is authenticated, the final step is to be accepted into
the wireless network. This is known as association. Once the AP verifies that the SSID of
the station matches that of the wireless network (open system authentication) or that the

challenge texts match (shared key authentication), then the wireless device is authenticated.
Association is the process by which the station “registers” with the AP so that the AP
reserves memory space in the AP and establishes an association ID for it. The AP sends an
association response frame that includes information such as the association ID and
supported data rates.
Transmitting on the WLAN
The IEEE 802.11 standard specifies three procedures for transmitting on the WLAN: the dis-
tributed coordination function, the point coordination function, and the hybrid coordination
function.
Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) The distributed coordination function
defines two procedures: the Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection and
Request to Send/Clear to Send.
Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) Because the
wireless medium is shared, rules for cooperation among the wireless stations are necessary.
These different ways of sharing are called channel access methods. One type of channel
access method is known as contention. The “philosophy” of contention is that devices con-
tend, or compete, with each other to use the network medium. With contention, any device
can attempt to transmit a message at any time. However, if two devices send frames at the
same time, a collision results and the frames become unintelligible. One way to prevent net-
work collisions is to employ the same principles that people use in polite conversation: first,
listen to make sure no one else is talking. If someone is talking, then wait; if no one else is
talking, then go ahead and speak.
The IEEE 802.3 Ethernet standard specifies contention with this type of “politeness”
as its channel access method. Known as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision
Detection (CSMA/CD), it specifies that before a networked device starts to send a frame
it should first listen on the wire (called carrier sensing) to see if any other device is cur-
rently transmitting. If it senses traffic, it waits until that traffic is finished. If it hears no
traffic, then the device can send its frame. However, what if two devices simultaneously
listen, hear nothing on the cable, and then both start to send at exactly the same time?
A collision would still result. CSMA/CD specifies that each device must always continue
to listen while sending its frame. If it hears a collision, each device stops sending data
and instead broadcasts a “jam” signal over the network. This tells all other devices to
wait before sending any frames. The two sending computers then pause for a random
amount of time (called a backoff interval) before attempting to resend. CSMA/CD is illus-
trated in Figure 6-17.
However, CSMA/CD cannot be used for wireless networks for two reasons:
●
Difficult to detect collisions. Collision detection is very difficult with wireless transmis-
sions. With CSMA/CD, the stations must be able to transmit and listen at the same
time. However, in radio systems the signal from a transmitting station is so strong that
it will overpower that same station’s ability to simultaneously receive a transmission.
That means, while it is transmitting, a station “drowns out” its own ability to detect a
collision.

Hidden node problem. A second factor that makes collision detection difficult with

the AP but not within range of each other. If Device 2 “listens” and hears no traffic, it
might assume there are no transmissions taking place, while actually Device 1 is
already transmitting. This is known as the hidden node problem.
Instead of using CSMA/CD, the 802.11 standard uses an access method known as the
Distributed Coordination Function (DCF). The DCF specifies that a modified procedure
known as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) be used.
Whereas CSMA/CD is designed to handle collisions when they occur, CSMA/CA attempts
to avoid collisions altogether.
Consider for a moment a family with several children on vacation at a remote cabin, with
only one cell phone that can receive service. When will there be the most conflict over who
gets to use the phone? Usually it will be immediately after someone talking on the phone has
hung up. This is because everyone else has been forced to wait until that telephone conversa-
tion was over and now they all want to use the phone at the same time. The same is true
with a contention channel access method like Ethernet CSMA/CD: the time at which
the most collisions occur is immediately after a station completes its transmission. This is
because all other stations wanting to transmit have been waiting for the medium to clear
so they can send their frames. Once the medium is clear they all try to transmit at the
same time, which results in more collisions and delays. CSMA/CD handles the collisions by
having the two stations responsible for the collision wait a random amount of time (the
backoff interval) before attempting to resend.
Think about the situation with one cell phone again. Suppose the parents at the cabin
created a reward system based on household duties to perform (cleaning a room, mowing
the lawn, etc.) for the week. Each week every child receives a “Telephone Wait Time”
number. The child who has completed all of his duties gets a Telephone Wait Time of
one minute, while a child who has not completed his duties gets a Telephone Wait Time
of five minutes. Whenever the telephone became available, each child has to wait the
amount of his or her Telephone Wait Time before trying to use the phone. If both Braden
and Mia wanted to use the phone, but Mia had to wait only one minute while Braden
had to wait five minutes, Mia would obviously get to go first and Braden would be
forced to wait until Mia’s call was completed. Because everyone’s wait time is different,

there would be no contention for using the phone once it was available. This analogy is
similar to wireless CSMA/CA. Instead of making just the two stations responsible for the
collision wait a random amount of time before attempting to resend after the collision,
CMSA/CA has all stations wait a random amount of time after the medium is clear. This
significantly reduces the number of collisions.
With wireless CSMA/CA, the amount of time that a station must wait after the medium is
clear is called the slot time. Each station must wait a random amount of slot times as its
backoff interval. For example, the slot time for an 802.11b WLAN is 20 microseconds (μs).
If a wireless device’s backoff interval is 3 slot times, then it must wait 60 μs (20 μs 
3 slot times) before attempting to transmit. Because CMSA/CA has all stations wait a
random amount of time after the medium is clear, the number of collisions is significantly
reduced.
A second way in which CSMA/CA reduces collisions is by using explicit frame acknowledgment.
An acknowledgment frame (abbreviated ACK) is sent by the receiving device back to the
sending device to confirm that the data frame arrived intact. If the ACK frame is not returned
a problem is assumed to have occurred and the data frame is transmitted again. This explicit
ACK mechanism handles interference and other radio-related problems. CSMA/CA and ACK
are illustrated in Figure 6-19.
IEEE 802.11n adds a feature known as block acknowledgment, which is necessary for
A-MPDU aggregation. The block acknowledgment mechanism in 802.11n supports
multiple MPDUs in an A-MPDU. When an A-MPDU from one station is received and
errors are found in some of aggregated MPDUs, the receiving node sends a block ACK
only acknowledging the correct MPDUs. The sender then will only retransmit nonacknowl-
edged MPDUs.

Block acknowledgment only applies to A-MPDU but not A-MSDU.
This is because when an MSDU is incorrect the entire A-MSDU
needs to be transmitted.
Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) Although CSMA/CA reduces the potential
for collisions, it does not eliminate them altogether. The hidden node problem, which is
the result of stations that are out of range of each other and do not know that the other
exists, cannot be solved by CSMA/CA. The 802.11 standard provides an option that can
be used when collisions occur due to a hidden node. This option is known as virtual
carrier sensing or the Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS) protocol. When this
option is used it solves the hidden node problem and provides additional protection
against collisions.
CSMA/CA is technically physical carrier sensing.
Consider again the situation of the vacationing family with one cell phone. Suppose that
someone has just finished using the phone, and now Braden and Mia want to make a call.
However, Mom announces that she is expecting a call from her business partner and that
nobody can use the phone for the next hour until she receives the call. (Because the service
is spotty at the cabin, she does not want to risk missing call waiting.) She has essentially
reserved the phone for period of time for a special call.
This analogy is similar to RTS/CTS. A Request to Send (RTS) frame is transmitted by a
station to the access point. This frame contains a duration field that indicates the length
of time needed for both the transmission and the returning ACK frame. The AP as well as
all stations that can receive the RTS frame are alerted that the station needs to reserve the
medium for a specific period of time. Each receiving station stores that information in its
net allocation vector (NAV). No station can transmit if the NAV contains a value other
than zero. The access point then responds to the station with a Clear to Send (CTS) frame
that alerts all devices that medium is now being reserved and they should suspend any
transmissions. Once the station receives the CTS frame it can then proceed with transmit-
ting its frame.
RTS and CTS frames are control frames and not management
frames.
The RTS/CTS protocol imposes significant overhead upon the WLAN with the transmission
of its RTS and CTS frames. The RTS/CTS protocol is especially taxing when short data
packets are being transmitted. For this reason the 802.11 standard allows that when the
RTS/CTS option is invoked, short data packets may still be transmitted without RTS/CTS.
This is known as the RTS threshold. Only packets that are longer than the RTS threshold
are transmitted using RTS/CTS.

Because the RTS/CTS protocol imposes additional overhead, it gener-
ally is not used unless there is no other way to improve network
performance.
Another means of reducing collisions is fragmentation, or dividing the data to be trans-
mitted from one large frame into several smaller ones. Sending many smaller frames
instead of one large frame reduces the amount of time that the wireless medium is
being used and likewise reduces the probability of collisions. If the length of a data
frame to be transmitted exceeds a specific value, the MAC layer will divide or fragment
that frame into several smaller frames. Each fragmented frame is given a fragment num-
ber (the first fragmented frame is 0, the next frame is 1, and so on). The frames are then
transmitted to the receiving station. The receiving station receives the frame, sends back
an ACK, and then is ready to receive the next fragment (a station can receive fragmen-
ted frames from up to three different senders). Upon receiving all of the fragments, they
are reassembled based on their fragment numbers, back into the one original frame.
Fragmentation can reduce the probability of collisions and may be considered as an
alternative to RTS/CTS. However, fragmentation does have additional overhead associ-
ated with it. (It requires a separate ACK from the receiving station for each fragmented
frame)
Fragmentation does not always have to be used separately from RTS/
CTS. The 802.11 standard permits them to be used simultaneously.
Variations of RTS/CTS are also used as protection mechanisms. Because the technolo-
gies behind 802.11a/b/g/n are significantly different, having a mix of devices based on
these different standards may result in transmission problems. The CTS-to-self is used
when 802.11g devices are mixed with 802.11b devices together. The 802.11g device
first sends a CTS message using an 802.11b rate and technology to reserve the medium
that all devices will hear. It then immediately sends its data frame and ACK at the
higher 802.11g rate. The HT Dual-CTS Protection is used with 802.11n devices in a
mixed environment with 802.11a/b/g devices. The 802.11n device sends a RTS to
the AP, which responds with two CTS frames: one in the 802.11n format and one in
the non-802.11n format. This ensures that all devices—802.11a/b/g/n—receive the
message.
Besides HT Dual-CTS Protection, another protection mechanism is the HT L-SIG
Protection. In a PPDU header, a subfield within the Signal field known as the
L-Length subfield for 802.11n frames indicates the length of the PSDU (from 1 to
4,095 octets) that is used to determine the number of octet being transmitted between
the MAC and the PHY. When transmitting in HT-Greenfield Mode or HT-Mixed
Mode the L-Length subfield is used in conjunction with a Rate subfield (which is set
to 6 Mbps) to control the length of time that an 802.11a/b/g station will refrain from
transmitting.
The 802.11 standard also defines different interframe spaces (IFS) or “time gaps.” These
are standard spacing intervals between the transmissions of the data frames. Instead of

being just “dead space,” these time gaps are used for special types of transmissions. The
IFS are:
●
Short IFS. Short IFS (SIFS) is used for immediate response actions such as ACK and
has the highest level of priority.
●
Point Coordination Function IFS. Point Coordination Function IFS (PIFS) is the time
used by a device to access the medium after it has been asked and then given approval
to transmit.
●
Distributed Coordination Function IFS. Distributed Coordination Function IFS (DIFS)
is the standard interval between the transmission of data frames.
●
Extended IFS. Extended IFS space (EIFS) is used when frames must be retransmitted.
●
Arbitration IFS. Arbitration IFS (AIFS) is used when setting priorities to different types
of transmissions.
●
Reduced IFS. Used by 802.11n devices, Reduced IFS (RIFS) reduces the amount of
“dead space” required between OFDM transmissions, yet is restricted to Greenfield
deployments.
Figure 6-20 illustrates a transmission by a station using direct sequence spread spectrum
(DSSS) that has been assigned three slot times. (Remember that the amount of time that
a station must wait after the medium is clear is given as the number slot times, and the
total amount of waiting time, known as the backoff interval, is calculated by multiplying
the number of slot times by the length of each slot time, which is 20 μs). The station starts
listening (carrier sensing) before transmitting. If there is no traffic at the completion of the
DIFS (50 μs), the station starts transmitting. When the transmission is over, the receiving
device sends back an acknowledgment (ACK) in the SIFS gap, acknowledging that the
transmission was successful. Once received, the process starts all over again with the
station carrier sensing at the next DIFS. This time, if no traffic is detected, the station
starts its backoff interval of 60 microseconds (20 μs  3 slot times). At the end of each
slot time interval (20 μs) the wireless device again listens for traffic. If at the end of its
backoff interval the station still detects no traffic, then it transmits its second frame.
Once the ACK packet is received, the process resumes again.

When two stations need to transmit, it becomes more complicated, as shown in Figure 6-21.
Wireless station A is using DSSS with three slot times while wireless station B has only two
slot times. Station A begins carrier sensing and then transmitting its first frame. Station B
then begins carrier sensing while Station A’s first frame is being sent. Because it detects traf-
fic, Station B waits. Once Station A has received its ACK, both stations begin carrier sensing
during the second DIFS. At the end of the second DIFS Stations, A and B begin their backoff
interval. Because the number of Station B’s slot times is only two (20 μs  2 slot times), it
will finish its backoff interval before Station A (20 μs  3 slot times). Station B then begins
transmitting its first packet.
Because each station continues to listen for traffic at the end of each of its time slots,
Station A detects that Station B is now transmitting. Station A “remembers” that it has
already counted off two of its slot times. Station A must now wait until B’s transmission
and acknowledgment is complete and the next DIF begins. After the DIF gap time
Station A and B both begin their backoff interval. However, this time Station A only
has to wait one slot time. This is because Station A already waited for two of its slot
times previously. If a station is “bumped” by another station from transmitting, it only
has to wait the remaining number of time slots and not start all over again. This
increases the probability that those stations that are waiting will transmit sooner than
a new station will.
Point Coordination Function (PCF) The contention channel access method, in which
any computer can attempt to transmit a message at any time, is the basis for CSMA/CA.
Another type of channel access method is polling. With this method, each device is polled,

or asked, in sequence if it wants to transmit: if the answer is yes, then it is given permission
to transmit while all other devices must wait, whereas if the answer is no, then the next
device in sequence is polled. Polling effectively prevents collisions because every device must
wait until it receives permission before it can transmit. However, polling can have an impact
on performance.
The 802.11 standard provides for an optional polling function known as Point Coordination
Function (PCF). With PCF the access point serves as the polling device or “point
coordinator.” It queries each device in an orderly fashion to determine if the device needs
to transmit. The point coordinator begins by sensing the medium, just as all other devices
do, after a SIFS time gap during which an ACK was transmitted. However, whereas the
other devices must wait through the duration of the DIFS time gap, the point coordinator
has to wait only through the PIFS time gap. Because the PIFS is shorter than the DIFS time
gap, the point coordinator will gain control of the medium before any other devices, as seen
in Figure 6-22.
If the point coordinator hears no traffic at the end of the PIFS time gap, then it sends out
a beacon frame to all stations. One field of this frame contains a value that indicates the
length of time that PCF (polling) will be used instead of DCF (contention), and stations
store it in their NAV field. After the stations receive this beacon frame they must stop
any transmission for that length of time. The point coordinator then sends out another
frame to a specific station, granting it permission to transmit one frame to any destina-
tion. If it has nothing to send, then that station returns a null data frame to the point
coordinator.
Because each station can be told the length of time that PCF will
be used instead of DCF, the 802.11 standard allows a WLAN to
alternate between PCF (polling) and DCF (contention). The point
coordinator waits during the first PIFS and then sends out a
beacon frame, “reserving” the network for a specific amount of
time. During this time, a station is polled and a PCF frame is transmitted. At the conclu-
sion of that transmission, the time expires and the WLAN returns to the default DCF
method, allowing another station to transmit based on contention. When that frame is
completed, the point coordinator can again take control of the medium by sending out
another beacon frame.

Hybrid Coordination Function (HCF) A third channel access method, which is
also optional like PCF, is the hybrid coordination function (HCF). The HCF allows for
different types of wireless traffic to be given different levels of priority. The foundation
of HCF is that it schedules access to the channel by allocating transmission opportunities
(TXOP) to the stations. Each TXOP has a starting time and a maximum duration, which is
the time interval the station has the medium all to itself. This means that a station with
TXOP can transmit multiple data frames without entering the backoff procedure. This
reduction in overhead means that more frames can be sent in a given period of time.
There are two access mechanisms specified by the HCF. The first is known as Enhanced
Distributed Channel Access (EDCA). EDCA divides transmissions into four different access
category (AC) classes:
●
Background (AC_BK)
●
Best Effort (AC_BE)
●
Video (AC_VI)
●
Voice (AC_VO)
Traffic that has been “tagged” with a higher priority AC (such as AC_VO) is given priority
over traffic with a lower priority (like AC_BK).
The second HCF mechanism is HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA). Like PCF, HCCA
uses polling along with centralized scheduling that is controlled by the AP (called the hybrid
coordinator or HC). Each station that requires priority of its frames sends that information
to the HC, which then assigns a TXOP to the station. Each station is polled and allowed to
transmit its packets until its TXOP duration elapses. Yet unlike PCF, the HC can start a
polling period at different times.
There is concern that the original HCCA mechanism may not be ade-
quate to support real-time voice communication. This is because of
the high overhead in polling stations that do not have messages to
be transmitted.
Chapter Summary
■A service set is all of the devices that are associated with an 802.11 WLAN. There
are three WLAN service set configurations. A Basic Service Set (BSS) is as one or more
stations that are served by a single AP. The physical area of RF coverage is called a
Basic Service Area (BSA). An Extended Service Set (ESS) is comprised of two or more
BSS networks that are interconnected to accommodate additional users over a wider
area who can roam between AP coverage areas. When all APs are on the same subnet
it is called Layer 2 roaming; when the APs are on separate subnets it is known as
Layer 3 roaming. Mobile IP provides a mechanism within the TCP/IP protocol to bet-
ter support mobile computing. An Independent Basic Service Set (IBSS), also known as
peer-to-peer or ad hoc mode, is a wireless network that does not use an AP and cannot
connect to another network; instead, the wireless devices communicate directly
between themselves.

■The OSI model uses the term data unit to describe the sets of data that move through
the OSI layers. A Service Data Unit (SDU) describes a specific unit of data that has
been passed down from a higher OSI layer to a lower layer but has not yet been
encapsulated by that lower layer. A Protocol Data Unit (PDU) specifies the data that
will be sent to the peer protocol layer at the receiving device instead of that being sent
to a lower layer level (an SDU). The 802.11n adds a feature to reduce the amount of
overhead transmitted and thus increase overall throughput by combining or aggregat-
ing specific SDUs and PDUs.
■Because most WLANs operate in infrastructure mode, it is important that the 802.11
frames of a wireless network interoperate with an 802.3 Ethernet network. Because
these wireless and wired networks share a common IEEE 802 foundation, the frames
share a similar format. Any differences in frame size can be addressed to provide
interoperability between the networks. Because of the significant differences between
802.11n HT and non-HT 802.11a/b/g, an 802.11n AP can tell 802.11n wireless
devices to change “on the fly” to one of four HT Operation Modes in order to inter-
operate with slower devices.
■There are three main types of MAC frames. Management frames are used to set up the
initial communications between a device and the access point (for infrastructure mode)
or between stations (for ad hoc mode), and then maintain the connection. Control
frames provide assistance in delivering frames that contain the data by controlling
access to the medium. Data frames carry the information to be transmitted to the des-
tination device.
■The first major function of the MAC layer involves defining procedures for a station
to discover a WLAN. This discovery process can be done by passive scanning or active
scanning. Passive scanning depends upon the AP “advertising” itself. At regular inter-
vals, the AP sends a beacon frame to both announce its presence and to provide the
necessary information for wireless stations wanting to join the network. In active
scanning, the station first sends out a management probe request frame on an avail-
able channel. Wireless authentication requires the wireless device and not the individ-
ual user to be authenticated prior to being connected to the network. IEEE 802.11
authentication is a process in which the AP accepts a station. There are two types of
authentication supported by the 802.11 standard. Open system authentication is the
basic and the default method. With shared key authentication both the AP and the
station are given the same key value in advance. The station first sends an authentica-
tion frame to the AP, and the AP responds with an authentication frame that contains
a block of text known as the challenge text. The station must encrypt the text with its
key value and return it to the AP in an authentication frame. The AP will then decrypt
what was returned with its own key to see if it matches the original challenge text.
Once a wireless device is authenticated the final step is to be accepted into the wireless
network. This is known as association.
■The IEEE 802.11 standard specifies three procedures for transmitting on the WLAN.
Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) specifies that a modified procedure known
as Carrier Sense Multiple Access with Collision Avoidance (CSMA/CA) be used.
Whereas CSMA/CD is designed to handle collisions when they occur, CSMA/CA
attempts to avoid collisions altogether. CSMA/CA can also address collisions through
frame acknowledgment and block acknowledgment. The 802.11 standard provides an

option that can be used when collisions occur due to a hidden node. This option is
known as virtual carrier sensing or the Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS)
protocol. When this option is used, it solves the hidden node problem and provides
additional protection against collisions. Variations of RTS/CTS are also used as
protection mechanisms.
■The 802.11 standard provides for an optional polling function known as Point
Coordination Function (PCF). With PCF, the access point serves as the polling device
or “point coordinator” and queries each device in an orderly fashion to determine if
the device needs to transmit. A third channel access method, which is also optional
like PCF, is the hybrid coordination function (HCF). The HCF allows for different
types of wireless traffic to be given different levels of priority. The foundation of HCF
is that it schedules access to the channel by allocating transmission opportunities
(TXOP) to the stations. Each TXOP has a starting time and a maximum duration,
which is the time interval the station has the medium all to itself.

Hands-On Projects
Project 6-1: Creating a Bootable Linux USB Flash Drive
with Network Protocol Analyzer Software
Capturing data, control, and management frames from a wireless network
using a Windows-based network protocol analyzer software application
can be difficult. This is because wireless network interface card adapters can operate in
one of six different modes: master (when the card acts as an AP), managed (when the
station acts as a normal client), repeater, mesh, ad-hoc, or monitor mode (also called
Radio Frequency Monitor or RFMON). When in monitor mode, a card can capture
frames without first being associated with an AP. Prior to Microsoft Windows Vista,
the Microsoft Windows Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) did not support
monitor mode, and only data frames could be displayed. In later versions of Windows
(Vista and 7), some support for monitor mode was added, yet this is dependent upon
specific types of cards. Unlike Windows, Linux supports monitor mode so that most
cards and their drivers can easily display all three types of frames. Using Linux does not
require that the operating system and protocol analyzer software be installed on a hard
drive; instead, a “live” bootable CD or USB flash drive containing Linux and selected
applications can turn any computer into a Linux-based protocol analyzer without using
the hard drive. In this project you will create a USB flash drive that contains Linux and
the Backtrack package that contains the Wireshark network protocol analyzer software.
In order to complete this project you will need a computer with a
fast Internet connection and a USB flash drive that is at least 2GB.
As an option, you can create a live DVD instead of using a USB flash
drive.
1. First you will download Unetbootin that allows you to create a live bootable USB flash
drive. Use your Web browser to go to unetbootin.sourceforge.net.
2. Click the Download (for Windows) button.
3. Follow the instructions to download the Unetbootin executable file onto your computer.
It is not unusual for Web sites to change the location of where files
are stored. If the URL above no longer functions then open a search
engine and search for “Unetbootin”.
4. Next you will download Backtrack, which contains the Linux operating system and the
Linux-based Wireshark network protocol analyzer software. Use your Web browser to
go to www.backtrack-linux.org.
It is not unusual for Web sites to change the location of where files
are stored. If the URL above no longer functions then open a search
engine and search for “Backtrack”.

Early IEEE 802.11 wireless LANs (WLANs) typically utilized a Basic Service Set (BSS) or an
Extended Service Set (ESS) with one or more access points (APs). Although these service set
configurations still remain the preferred choice for settings with a limited number of users,
such as for homes or SOHOs, for enterprise settings with hundreds of users—and a corre-
sponding high number of APs—the task of individually managing all of the APs proved to be
burdensome. A technician would have to roam into the range of each of the APs in order to
An automobile insurer is expanding a program that tracks how and when drivers use
their cars. This results in lower premiums for safe drivers and higher premiums for
risky drivers. And wireless technology is at the heart of it.
Progressive Insurance now offers its Snapshot® discount program, first started in
June 2008, in over 20 different states. Customers who sign up for the program
receive a device about the size of the palm of your hand. This device is plugged into
the car’s on-board diagnostic port (ODB), a connection that has been required in all
cars since 1996. Through the ODB, the Snapshot device records such information as
the number of miles driven, the time of day that the driving takes place, and the
number of sudden stops. (It does not record the vehicle’s location by GPS or whether
the driver is speeding.) This information is then automatically transmitted wirelessly
to Progressive. (Earlier models required drivers to remove the device and connect it
to their home computers either through a cable or wireless connection to upload the
data.) Drivers can go online at any time to view their information and rates.
Drivers with good driving habits—gentle braking, driving fewer miles than the
average driver for that state, and limited driving during peak hours or between mid-
night and 4:00 AM—can receive a discount on their car insurance. These discounts
can be as much as 60 percent less than normal rates. However, drivers with bad driv-
ing habits could see their insurance increase by up to 9 percent. Drivers can drop out
of the Snapshot program at virtually any time and not have any accumulated infor-
mation used against them. And Progressive states that they will not use the Snapshot
data to settle a claim unless the owner of the vehicle first grants permission.
All indications are that Progressive will continue to expand this program using
wireless technology. They already own several patents on the technology, including
one that is for a “method of determining a cost of automobile insurance for a
selected period based upon monitoring, recording and communicating data represen-
tative of operator and vehicle driving characteristics during said period, whereby the
cost is adjustable by relating the driving characteristics to predetermined safety
standards.” Insurance industry analysts predict that other insurance companies will
soon have their own Snapshot-like devices using wireless technology.

make the changes, taking several days of work just to make a single configuration change.
A centralized management structure was simply not available.
However, as WLANs have matured, new architectures based on new wireless equipment have
been developed. Many of these new architectures have the goal of improving the management
of the wireless network.
In this chapter the different types of WLAN management and architectures will be discussed.
First you will learn about the three general categories of WLAN architectures: autonomous
access point architectures, controller-based architectures, and other architectures. Next, the
differences between single- and multiple-channel architecture network models will be explored.
Finally, you will learn how to manage these architectures through a wireless network manage-
ment system and you will learn how WLANs handle power management.
Autonomous Access Point Architectures

3.2.3. Define, describe, and apply IEEE 802.11 coordination functions
and channel access methods and features available for optimizing
data flow across the RF medium.
4.4.1. Define, describe, and implement autonomous APs.
4.4.3. Define, describe, and implement distributed WLAN architectures.
The most common WLAN architecture is one with a “stand-alone” AP. These APs are known
as independent or autonomous access points because they are separate from other autono-
mous access points. All of the “intelligence” for wireless management, authentication, and
encryption is contained within the AP itself to provide service to wireless stations. Because
everything is self-contained in these devices they are also called fat access points.
Autonomous APs are covered in Chapter 2.
Autonomous access point architectures include network connectivity along with a lengthy list
of features. There are both advantages as well as limitations to this type of architecture.
Network Connectivity
The network connectivity of WLANs using an autonomous access point depends on its
type of service set. A service set is all of the devices that are associated with an 802.11
WLAN. There are three different wireless LAN service set configurations: the BSS, the
ESS, and the independent basic service set (IBSS). The IBSS is a wireless network that
does not use an AP and thus cannot connect to another network. Although by definition
a BSS is not required that the AP be connected to another network, practically speaking
the BSS would have limited functionality if the AP were not connected: the stations
would only be able to communicate between each other but not to any other devices or
networks outside the BSS. An ESS is composed of two or more BSS networks that are
interconnected. By using multiple APs, an ESS can accommodate additional users over a
wider area. This type of configuration is called a distributed WLAN architecture, in which

multiple APs form a non-centralized (distributed) network through a wireless connection
(instead of a centralized network with a single AP at the center).
Service sets are covered in Chapter 6.
Feature Sets
The features found in autonomous access points vary by vendor as well as by the setting for
which the AP is designed (home, small office home office, or enterprise). Many of these fea-
tures are designed to enhance the configuration, installation, and management of the AP.
Some of the typical features sets include:
●
Ability to add 5-GHz IEEE 802.11a support to a 2.5-GHz IEEE 802.11g AP
●
Built-in security and manageability features
●
External antenna connection
●
Support for Wireless Distribution Systems (WDS)
●
Support for large numbers of wireless stations
●
Auto network connect and dynamic rate shifting
●
Power over Ethernet (PoE) options
●
Diversity radio antenna
●
Security to limit unauthorized stations access to network resources
●
Adjustable transmit power
●
Ability to configure parameters, run diagnostics, and monitor performance from
anywhere on the network using a Web browser
●
Support for standards-based management protocols
In addition to these feature sets, two additional features add enhanced capabilities to autono-
mous access points: quality of service and wireless virtual LANs (VLANs).
Quality of Service (QoS) The Distributed Coordination Function (DCF) contention
method was designed to be an “equal and fair” approach to wireless transmissions: each
wireless station has the same opportunity as all other stations for accessing the medium
(sometimes called “airtime fairness”). Although DCF generally works well for data transmis-
sions, the same is not true for real-time traffic that is time dependent. These types of trans-
missions—like voice and video—depend heavily upon each frame arriving in sequence,
whereas general data transmissions are not as sensitive to time. Delays in voice and video
transmission can result in a video that freezes on the screen or a conversation that has gaps
of dead space. DCF cannot distinguish between voice, video, and data frames to assure that
time-sensitive frames have a priority over data-only frames. The capability to prioritize dif-
ferent types of frames is known as Quality of Service (QoS).
Distributed Coordination Functions are covered in Chapter 6.

QoS on WLANs has become increasingly important due to the widespread adoption of Voice
over IP (VoIP) telephony, which uses Internet Protocol (IP-based) data packet switching networks
to transmit voice communications. However, implementing QoS over WLANs poses several chal-
lenges. Although it is possible to use Point Coordination Function (PCF) or a combination of DCF
and PCF for QoS, most wireless manufacturers have chosen not to provide the optional PCF ser-
vice in their equipment. This has resulted in some vendors offering proprietary wireless QoS,
which forces customers to adopt one brand of equipment for all wireless hardware.
In 2004, the Wi-Fi Alliance released its QoS specification known as Wi-Fi Multimedia
(WMM). WMM is modeled after a wired network QoS prioritization scheme. WMM out-
lines four levels of prioritization for WLAN QoS. These are summarized in Table 7-1.
In 2005 the IEEE released its own set of QoS standards for WLANs known as IEEE
802.11e-2005. This standard is based on the optional hybrid coordination function (HCF).
There are two access mechanisms specified by the HCF. The first is known as Enhanced
Distributed Channel Access (EDCA). EDCA divides transmissions into four different access
categories or ACs (WMM is based on EDCA and is considered a subset of it). The second
HCF mechanism is HCF Controlled Channel Access (HCCA), which uses polling along
with centralized scheduling controlled by the AP.
Currently there are four recognized solutions to QoS: proprietary;
WMM (some APs support both proprietary and WMM); EDCA; or split
dual-band (using a dual-band AP and dedicating the 5 GHz to VoIP
and the 2.4 GHz to data). HCCA is a very powerful, complex coordina-
tion function, and it is unclear if it will gain widespread acceptance.
Wireless Virtual LANs (VLANs) A wired network can be segmented by constructing a
virtual local area network (VLAN). A VLAN is a logical grouping of network devices within
a larger physical network. VLANs do not require that all of the devices (or their users) be
physically located together; they can be dispersed anywhere throughout the network. For
example, a VLAN group may consist of all the accounting department employees, even if
they are scattered across different floors of an office building or even in different buildings.
The key to VLANs is the ability of the network switch to correctly direct packets. Switches allo-
cate an access port for each network device and then keep a record of that device’s media access
control (MAC) address with the port number. When a VLAN packet arrives at the switch, it
can determine which devices are part of that VLAN and only send the packet out those ports.
This means that network switches are able to send VLAN packets to the correct ports because
of the way in which the VLAN packets are identified. One standard for marking VLAN packets

is the IEEE 802.1q standard that supports trunking (trunking means that a single cable is used
to support multiple virtual LANs). The 802.1q standard is called an internal tagging mechanism
because it inserts a 4-byte “tag” header within the existing Ethernet packet.
Just as with wired networks, wireless VLANs can also be used to segment traffic, yet without
adding additional network hardware. For example, an organization may set up two wireless
VLANs: the first is for employee access, in which employees can see the company’s files and
databases through the network, while a second VLAN is for guest access, limited only to
Internet access or files available for any user. Employees can configure their wireless network
interface card client adapters to use the Service Set Identifiers (SSID) Employee while guests
would use the SSID Guest. When the devices associate to the same AP, they automatically
become part of their respective wireless VLAN. And because wired devices attached through
the switch can also belong to the same VLAN, wireless VLAN and wired VLAN devices can
share subnets or can belong to completely different subnets.
Another benefit of using multiple SSIDs and VLANs is that different
security features can be configured for each VLAN group.
Wireless VLANs can be configured in one of two ways. The difference depends upon which
device separates the packets and directs them to different networks. In Figure 7-1, separating

packets in this wireless VLAN is done by the switch. Each AP is connected to a separate port on
the switch and represents a different VLAN. As packets destined for the wireless LAN arrive at
the switch, the switch separates the packets and sends them to the appropriate AP (VLAN).
Yet this configuration has limitations. For example, if a wireless user in the accounting depart-
ment is part of the Accounting VLAN, what happens when that user roams to the Marketing
VLAN supported by another AP? The user may no longer have access to the Accounting
VLAN and then is unable to use the network resources. Reconfiguring the network to make
each VLAN accessible from every AP across the enterprise may not always be possible.
A more flexible approach is illustrated in Figure 7-2, where the AP is responsible for
separating the packets. Under this configuration a user can roam into different areas of cov-
erage and still be connected to the correct VLAN. The key to this configuration is that dif-
ferent VLANs are transmitted by the AP on different SSIDs. This enables only the clients
associated with a specific VLAN to receive those packets. Access points that support wireless
VLANs may support 16 or more multiple SSIDs (and thus multiple VLANs).
If you were to look at an AP configured for multiple VLANs it would
appear as 16 different wireless networks.

Wireless VLANs allow a single AP to service different types of users. Wireless VLANs are
not only found on enterprise-grade APs, they are also supported by many SOHO and con-
sumer APs. Configuring wireless VLANs can also prevent a user who connects to a wireless
network from accessing sensitive computers or files.
Advantages and Limitations
Autonomous access point architectures have several advantages. As the foundation of
WLANs for several years they have matured to include a strong array of features, including
QoS, wireless VLANs, and other options. In addition, the growth (scalability) of a distributed
WLAN architecture using autonomous APs is straightforward and virtually unlimited: to add
more capacity to the WLAN all that is needed is to add more APs. This allows for a WLAN
to start small and grow in manageable increments. In addition, because all of the intelligence
is in the AP there are no other devices that must be added.
Yet because each autonomous AP is essentially independent, each AP must be separately con-
figured, managed, and maintained. Each AP operates as a separate node that is configured
with its own unique settings (such as channel number and power settings), leading to coordi-
nation problems. For example, when an autonomous AP hears another AP on the same
channel, it cannot determine if that AP is part of the same network or if it belongs to another
neighboring network. Adding a new AP to a larger existing WLAN may require significant
configurations to multiple APs. Table 7-2 lists some limitations of the autonomous access
point architecture.

controller-based architectures, these configurations rely upon a wireless LAN controller (WLC)
at the heart of the network. With a single WLC centrally configured, the settings can then be
automatically distributed to all APs.
WLCs are covered in Chapter 2.
The APs used in controller-based architectures are different from the APs used in an autono-
mous access point WLAN and in WLCs.
Access Points
In an autonomous access point architecture, the AP consists of three major parts: an antenna
and a radio transmitter/receiver to send and receive wireless signals, special bridging software
to interface wireless devices to other devices, and a wired network interface that allows it to
connect by cable to a standard wired network in a BSS or ESS. Its basic functions are to act
as the “base station” for the wireless network to receive and forward all wireless transmis-
sions as well as to act as a bridge between the wireless and wired networks.
Access points in a controller-based architecture are significantly different. There are three
main types of APs that are found in this architecture: lightweight, mesh, and captive
portal APs.
Lightweight APs In a controller-based architecture, autonomous APs are replaced with
lightweight access points, also called thin access points. A lightweight access point does not
contain the management and configuration functions that are found in autonomous access
points; instead, these features are contained in the centralized WLC. Lightweight access
points only have simplified radios for wireless communication between devices and a media
converter for accessing the wired network.
Lightweight APs only handle the real-time MAC layer functionality within themselves; all
other (non-real-time) MAC functionality is processed by the WLC. This type of division is
referred to as a split MAC architecture. Because the wireless controller manages the AP
configurations individually, the configuration of each lightweight AP is not necessary.
Lightweight APs cannot function independently of a wireless LAN
controller.
One of the most significant benefits to lightweight access points is a decrease in the total
cost of ownership (TCO), which is the total cost of owning a product that includes acquisi-
tion, setup, support, ongoing maintenance, service, and all operating expenses. Autonomous
access points require not only initial deployment but also individual management. For exam-
ple, in an autonomous access point architecture with 250 APs, spending only 30 minutes per
year on each AP would result in 125 person hours a year, or over three months of maintenance
in a five-year period (exclusive of any troubleshooting or errors). However, all lightweight
AP can be centrally managed from a single WLC, resulting in significant reduction in TCO.

Lightweight Mesh APs A mesh access point does not have to be individually con-
nected by a cable to the existing wired network. Instead, each mesh access point communi-
cates wirelessly with the next closest mesh access point. Dozens—or even hundreds—of
mesh access points can communicate between themselves to create a wireless mesh network
(WMN). Only one mesh access point must be physically connected to the wired network,
and all other mesh access points transparently “hop” through each other to reach the mesh
access point with the wired connection.
Just as an autonomous AP can be replaced with a lightweight AP, a standard mesh AP can
be replaced with a lightweight mesh AP. Lightweight mesh APs can also be centrally config-
ured and managed through a WLC.
Captive Portal APs A home user typically installs a WLAN in order to allow multiple
desktop and mobile stations to share access to the Internet. After the network connection is
established, simply launching a Web browser will give the user immediate and unlimited
access to the Internet.
However, in a public area that is served by a WLAN, opening a Web browser will rarely give
immediate Internet access. This is because the owner of the WLAN usually wants to advertise
themselves as providing this service, or because they want the user to read and accept an Accept-
able Use Policy (AUP) before using the WLAN. And sometimes a “general” authentication, such

as a password given to all current hotel guests, must be entered before being given access to the
network. This type of information, approval or authentication can be supported through a
captive portal AP. A captive portal AP uses a standard Web browser to provide information,
give the wireless user the opportunity to agree to a policy, or present valid login credentials.
Using a Web browser instead of a custom program for captive
portal APs ensures that the captive portal APs work with virtually all
computers and operating systems.
When a user on a wireless station connects to a public WLAN with a captive portal AP, he
will typically launch a Web browser to access the Internet. Instead of displaying the requested
Web page, the browser first displays a special screen that provides information and then
requires a user response (such as click “I Agree” or enter a valid password). Once the user
enters this information, he is verified by the captive portal AP; all other network access is
blocked until these credentials are approved. A captive portal AP is illustrated in Figure 7-4.
Although a captive portal AP is not a required part of a controller-based architecture, this is
typically the architecture in which it is most often found. A dedicated captive portal AP is
not even required for displaying information and authenticating the wireless user. Some cap-
tive portal alternatives have two parts: a client portion and a separate authentication server.
The client portion uses firewall rules to control traffic going through the router. When a
new user tries to access a Web site, the client will transparently redirect the user to the
authentication server. The client also talks to the authentication server every few minutes to
update it on vital statistics including uptime, load, traffic count per client, and to let it know
that it is still connected.

Several software-only open-source captive portals are available.
Wireless LAN Controllers (WLCs)
In some ways a WLC is akin to its wired network counterpart, the switch. A switch joins multi-
ple computers together within one local area network (LAN). There are two types of switches.
An unmanaged switch provides no management capabilities in the operation of the switch and
only allows the network devices to communicate. A series of light emitting diode (LED) lights
give limited information about the link status of the devices and their activity, but nothing
more. A managed switch supports both control and monitoring of the network. This control
of the network allows the network manager to adjust the communication parameters. For
example, in a setting with a large amount of electric noise the data rate can be dropped and cer-
tain automatic negotiation features disabled to ensure good transmissions. This can even be
done on a port-by-port basis. Monitoring the network is accomplished by using SNMP (Simple
Network Management Protocol), which provides information such as the number of bytes
transmitted and received, the number of frames transmitted and received, the number of errors,
and port status. All of this information can be viewed on a port-by-port basis.
Although a wired managed switch is similar to a WLC in that it can control and monitor the
network (a WLAN controller is sometimes called a wireless switch), a WLC has several
enhanced features. One of these features is network placement. There are three recognized
functional areas of a network as illustrated in Figure 7-5. These include:
●
Core layer. The core layer is considered the backbone of the network and includes all
high-end switches and high-speed fiber cables. At this layer of the network frames are
not routed through the WLAN; rather, this layer is concerned with speed and ensures
the reliable delivery of frames.
●
Distribution layer. The distribution layer, also called the workgroup layer, includes
LAN-based routers and Layer 3 switches. These devices ensure that frames are prop-
erly routed between subnets and VLANs.
●
Access layer. At the access layer devices such as hubs and switches are located. This is
because at the access layer (also called the desktop layer) the function is to connect
client nodes to the network and ensure that frames are delivered to end user computers.
Depending on different factors (for example, how the WLC will be integrated with the exist-
ing wired network) a WLC can be placed at either the core, distribution, or access layer.
Generally most WLC are positioned at the core layer.
Most WLAN controller products encapsulate the IEEE 802.11 frames
into an IP tunnel that then creates a point-to-point link between the
WLAN controller and the lightweight AP.
Another advantage of a WLC is network connectivity. As wireless stations move through a
WLAN, a handoff procedure must occur between APs as authentication information is trans-
ferred from one AP to another. The length of time necessary for this procedure can have an
adverse effect in WLAN systems using voice over wireless VoIP. However, this handoff

procedure is eliminated with WLC and lightweight APs because all authentications are
performed in the wireless controller. Also, most WLCs offer automated tools that can simulate
the environment and help predict the best locations for APs. Even after deployment, many
wireless controllers can establish the best channel and power settings for the wireless network.
There are also additional WLC features. These include:
●
WLAN profiles. A WLAN profile is a set of specific configurations that can be applied
to different wireless stations. This allows for different virtual WLANs to be created,
each with its own SSID and managed through a WLC. Each WLAN profile can be
different. For example, one profile may support QoS while another does not.
●
Multiple BSSIDs. The Basic Service Set Identifier (BSSID) is the MAC address of the AP
and is included in the header of frames that are transmitted by the AP and stations for a
variety of identification purposes. A WLC can have multiple virtual BSSIDs, enabling a
lightweight AP to support multiple virtual WLANs. This means that several BSSs can be
created to function within the area supported by a single lightweight AP.
●
Scalability. Using a WLC allows for rapid scalability or wireless network growth: mul-
tiple lightweight APs can more easily be added to the network and centrally configured
and managed instead of installing autonomous APs.

●
Client roaming. A wireless station that roams from one lightweight AP to another
lightweight AP supported by the same WLC, supported by different WLCs, and even
across WLCs on different subnets is fully supported.
Yet there are disadvantages to the controller-based architecture. Currently all devices are pro-
prietary, so that the WLCs and APs must be from the same vendor. The Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF) Control and Provisioning of Wireless Access Points (CAPWAP) Working
Group is developing a protocol that will allow any vendor’s WLC to communicate with any
lightweight AP, but there is no timetable yet for the new standard and none of the companies
involved have yet demonstrated cross-vendor interoperability. Another limitation is that many
WLC products still do not provide true convergence of the wired and wireless networks but
only ease some of the management burdens of WLANs. Many wireless experts claim that what
is needed is a comprehensive solution that takes full advantage of existing tools, knowledge,
resources, and the wired infrastructure to address security, deployment, and control issues.
Other Architectures
C W N A
4.4.7. Define and describe alternative WLAN architectures.
Besides autonomous access point architectures and control-based architectures, there are other
types of WLANs. These include WLAN arrays, cooperative control, and mesh networks.
WLAN Arrays
A WLAN array is a proprietary product marketed and sold by Xirrus. This device, which
resembles a round consumer-grade smoke detector, replaces a standard WLC installed in a
rack in a server closet. The WLAN array contains a WLC that can be directly connected to
as many as 16 integrated APs or IAPs. Within the WLAN array housing, the IAPs are
arranged in a circular configuration around the WLC. Each IAP provides a separate radio
frequency (RF) channel of highly directional coverage. Because the channels are physically
adjacent, they can form a multichannel region of coverage around the WLAN array.
The WLAN array also includes a switch and a firewall.
Cooperative Control
Cooperative control is a technology marketed and sold by Aerohive. The cooperative control
wireless LAN architecture enables APs to communicate and coordinate with each other with-
out the need for a WLC; in short, each AP contains the capabilities of a WLC. A special
cooperative control autonomous AP known as the HiveAP is central to the network. Multi-
ple HiveAPs can be organized into groups (hives) that share control information between
other HiveAPs to enable functions like roaming, security, and load balancing.

Cloud Management
Managing wireless networks that are separated geographically, such as a remote campus or
branch office on the opposite side of the city from the main facility, usually requires either two
separate support teams at each location or one team that travels between sites. This can result
in increased costs (maintaining two support teams) or increased time to resolve problems (wait-
ing for the support team to travel to the remote site). As an alternative a WLAN architecture
based on using the ubiquitious Internet can be implemented. Known as cloud management,
this system allows APs and other network equipment to be connected through the Internet and
then viewed and managed from one central location. When each device connects to an Internet-
based (“cloud”) centralized management system all the devices can be remotely controlled and
configured. In addition, diagnostic tests can be run and even updates can be applied.
Wireless Mesh Networks
An alternative to an autonomous access point and a lightweight access point is a mesh access
point. A mesh access point does not have to be individually connected by a cable to the exist-
ing wired network. Instead, each mesh access point communicates wirelessly with the next
closest mesh access point. Dozens—or even hundreds—of mesh access points can communi-
cate between themselves to create a wireless mesh network (WMN). Only one mesh access
point must be physically connected to the wired network, and all other mesh access points
transparently “hop” through each other to reach the mesh access point with the wired con-
nection. In addition, there are multiple interconnected paths through which the signal can
reach the wired mesh access point.
WMNs are covered in Chapter 2.

4.4.5. Define, describe, and implement a multiple-channel architec-
ture network model.
4.4.6. Define, describe, and implement a single-channel architecture
network model.
There are two architecture models for WLANs: multiple-channel architecture and single-
channel architecture. Proponents of each of these models claim that that their approach is
superior, whereas in reality both models may have their own respective applications.
Multiple-Channel Architecture (MCA)
The 802.11b standard uses the Industrial, Scientific and Medical (ISM) band for its transmis-
sions. The 802.11b standard specifies 14 frequencies that can be used, beginning at 2.412 GHz
and incrementing by .005 GHz (except for Channel 14). IEEE 802.11b transmissions in the
2.4-GHz frequency are designed to be þ/11 MHz from the channel center frequency.
However, some of the transmission may still encroach onto other frequencies up to 30 MHz

from the channel center, so that they actually consume five overlapping channels (for example,
transmitting on channel 6 may cause interference on channels 5 and 7 as well as limited on
channels 4 and 8). This leaves only three nonoverlapping (simultaneously usable) 20-MHz
channels: 1, 6, and 11. IEEE 802.11a networks have 555 MHz spread across 23 nonover-
lapping channels.
Channel allocation is covered in Chapter 5.
Managing

degree
802.11a—wireless networks can be challenging. Setting all of the APs to the same channel
number would result in reduced throughput because each station must wait a longer period
of time for its turn to transmit (called cochannel interference). To eliminate this interference
it is necessary to arrange the coverage areas of the APs so that one channel does not interfere
with an adjacent channel. In Figure 7-6, only channels 1, 6 and 11 are used as nonoverlap-
ping channel numbers. Each cell is separated from other cells so that no two adjacent cells
have the same channel number in order to reduce interference (known as adjacent channel
interference). This type of WLAN is called a multiple-channel architecture or MCA because
more than one channel is in the wireless network.
One of the keys to an MCA is to have the correct cell size in order to minimize adjacent
channel interference. This is especially true when “scaling” or adding additional capacity to
the WLAN. The most common approach, called the micro-cell architecture, creates small
areas of coverage. Typically, in order to add wireless network capacity, more APs are added
while the transmission power of all APs is reduced to minimize potential interference. This
can usually provide acceptable network throughput if the site has been properly surveyed to
identify the best locations for the APs. In addition, the configuration of BSSIDs and ESSIDs
can be made easier in a micro-cell architecture.
Single-Channel Architecture (SCA)
The fundamental reason why multiple APs in a MCA are necessary is because the interference
range of wireless devices exceeds their useful communication range. That is, devices that are
too far apart to communicate can still be close enough to interfere with each other. An alter-
native to MCA that addresses this weakness is the single-channel architecture (SCA). Instead
of having each cell use a different channel as in WCA, WLANs using SCA have all of the APs
use the same channel. Each AP has overlapping coverage that forms a continuous region on a
single channel, thereby reducing interference. The SCA architecture is accomplished through

the use of lightweight APs and WLCs. Each lightweight AP broadcasts the same virtual BSSID
(instead of multiple BSSIDs) and each has the same configured MAC address. This also serves
to eliminate the cochannel interference problem.
There are several advantages to SCA. The first advantage is smoother handoffs. A mobile sta-
tion must receive an uninterrupted flow of frames when moving from the coverage area of one
AP to another AP, especially when using VoIP. With MCA, the station responsible for this pro-
cedure monitors the signal strength from multiple APs or data frame error rates. With SCA, the
handoff is instead accomplished through coordination between the lightweight APs and the
WLC. The stations cannot distinguish which AP is providing the coverage; instead, the net-
work decides which AP should transmit and receive data for a particular station. This means
that the stations are not involved in any handoff decision from one AP to another. As stations
move, the network directs traffic to them via the nearest AP with available capacity.
With SCA, the roaming clients are “fooled” into thinking that they
are always interacting with the same AP when in reality they may be
communicating with several different APs.
A second advantage to SCA is that the often tedious planning process required for MCA
WLANs is no longer needed. All APs are set to the same common RF channel and transmit
power, eliminating the need for lengthy and often complex planning regarding the location
and unique configuration of each AP.
Another advantage to SCA is that because each AP is operating on the same channel, cochan-
nel interference is no longer an issue. This can also improve the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR)
that in turn increases throughput and reliability.
A final advantage is that the SCA architecture provides more network information in order
to make informed decisions. With MCA, a station and AP are essentially “in the dark”
regarding the overall status of the network. Yet with SCA a more complete knowledge of
the conditions at neighboring APs, and even historical information about how stations
reacted previously when in similar situations, can be used when deciding which AP a roam-
ing client should be associated with.
MCA is similar to the centralized handover control of first-generation
cellular telephone networks, while today’s 3G and 4G is based on a
shared network-client responsibility like SCA.
SCA can also support channel stacking. Channel stacking allows for increased capacity by hav-
ing more than one SCA operating in an area. Instead of having only one SCA on channel 1,
another set of APs operating on channel 6 can also be added using a different BSSID. Stations
can then associate with either SCA, thus dramatically increasing the available capacity. This
additional capacity can be used for redundancy or to support higher data rates or user density.
Instead of installing additional APs, channel stacking can also be
accomplished by using APs that support multiple radios.

Wireless Network Management Systems (WNMS)
C W N A
4.4.4. Define, describe, and implement a WNMS that manages
autonomous APs, WLAN controllers, and mesh nodes.
A wireless network management system (WNMS) is a set of hardware and/or software that can
be used to provide unified management of a wireless network. This includes configuration man-
agement, deployment, and especially troubleshooting. A WNMS can be used to isolate and solve
wireless problems, which can have many different root causes (station wireless configuration
errors, authentication problems, connectivity issues, problems with wired ports or switches, etc.).
The typical features of a WNMS include:
●
Configuration management. A new or updated configuration can be “pushed” out to
all wireless devices, a single device, or a group of specific devices. These configurations
can be designed so that general updates do not override specific configuration settings
unique to each device.
●
Firmware/Software distribution. As new firmware and software is made available,
these can be distributed to all devices from a central management facility, with no need
to “touch” each device.
●
Intelligent scheduling. To minimize the impact of a new configuration or firmware
update, many WNMS can be scheduled to automatically occur late at night or on the
weekends when the wireless network usage is low. In addition, recurring tasks can be
scheduled to automatically occur on a regular daily, weekly, or monthly basis.
●
User and device monitoring. A WNMS can locate a specific user or device on a wire-
less network often by WLAN administrator clicking a single button on a Web-based
software interface. This allows a wireless technician to monitor historical information
and use special diagnostic information to address problems.
One of the disadvantages of a WNMS is that it cannot be used to
monitor wireless network traffic as it occurs.
Power Management

3.1.3. Explain and apply the power management features of WLANs.
Most stations in a WLAN are portable laptop or tablet computers, giving the users the
freedom to roam without being tethered to the network by wires. These devices depend upon
batteries as their primary power source when they are mobile. To conserve battery power,

laptops are usually configured to go into a “sleep” mode after a specific period of time, when
functions such as the hard drive or display screen are temporarily powered down by the
computer.
However, a laptop that is part of a WLAN must remain “awake” in order to receive wireless
network transmissions. If a laptop is in sleep mode, it could miss important transmitted infor-
mation or even lose the network connection altogether. The dilemma is how to allow the lap-
top to power down into sleep mode during idle periods to preserve battery life yet continue to
be active to receive network transmissions.
The reason a wireless laptop must continue to remain awake to receive
network transmissions is because the original IEEE 802 standard assumes
that stations are always ready to receive a network message.
The answer to the problem is known as power management. Power management allows a
station to be in either active mode when it is continuously awake or in power save mode,
which turns off the wireless network interface card adapter to conserve battery life but still
not miss wireless transmissions. Power management is transparent to all protocols and appli-
cations so that it will not interfere with normal network functions.
Power save mode is also called continuous aware mode or constantly
awake mode.
IEEE 802.11 power management can be divided into two categories: basic power manage-
ment and enhanced power management techniques.
Basic Power Management
In a BSS infrastructure WLAN, the steps of power save mode are as follows:
1. A station sends a frame to the AP with the Power Management field set to 1 to indicate
that it will go into power save mode after this frame transmission.
2. The AP records that the station is in power save mode to prevent any frames from being
sent to that station from the AP.
3. As the AP receives frames specifically for that station (unicast frames) it temporarily
stores those frames at the AP (buffering).
4. At prescribed set times, the AP will send out a beacon frame to all stations. At the same
time, all stations switch to active mode to receive the frame. This frame contains a list of
the stations that have buffered unicast frames waiting at the AP. This list is known as
the traffic indication map (TIM).
5. If a station learns from the TIM that buffered frames are waiting for it, that station will
request the AP to have those frames forwarded (if it has no buffered frames then it can
return to power save mode). Once the buffered frames are received the station can again
return to power save mode. This is illustrated in Figure 7-7.
Power Management

The amount of power that a wireless network interface card adapter
consumes is significant. One typical card requires 450 millionths of
an amp (mA) to transmit and 270 mA to receive. While in power
save mode it only consumes 15 mA.
When a station in power save mode must receive a frame intended for all stations (multicast
or broadcast frame) the AP will send a special TIM called a delivery traffic indication
message (DTIM). All stations will then change to active mode to receive the frame.
Power management for an IBSS is different because there is no AP. Every station in an IBSS
must buffer the frames that it attempts to send to another device in case the receiving device
is asleep. At a specific period of time, known as the ad hoc traffic indication message
(ATIM) window, each station must be awake. At this time a station sends a beacon frame
to all other stations. Those stations that previously attempted to send a frame to a sleeping
station will now send an ATIM frame, which indicates that the receiving station has pending
data to be received and must remain awake (any device that does not receive an ATIM frame
can go back to sleep). Finally, the data frames are retrieved from the buffer and sent to the
station that is now awake.
There are a variety of configuration settings that can be used with
power management. For example, different power save levels can be
specified for a station in power save mode. One level may require that a
station turn off the radio for as long as possible without losing network
connectivity for the greatest power savings at the sake of network per-
formance, while another setting can require that the station turn off the radio for small periods in
order to provide optimal network performance.
Enhanced Power Management
Although the basic power management features can provide power savings, there are
enhanced power management technologies that can provide additional functionality and

power savings. These include Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery, Power Save
Multi-Poll, and Spatial Multiplexing Power Save.
Unscheduled Automatic Power Save Delivery (U-APSD) The Unscheduled
Automatic Power Save Delivery (U-APSD), which is similar to the Wi-Fi Alliance’s WMM
Power-Save (WMM-PS), is often used when a wireless station is using VoIP. With the basic
power management settings a device using VoIP for a voice conversation may receive frames
every 10–20 milliseconds (ms), while an AP usually sends out a beacon frame every 100 ms.
Because the delay is too long, normally a station using VoIP simply could not afford to go
into power save mode.
With U-APSD, the station would inform the AP that it is operating according to this proto-
col, and the AP will then save any frames destined for this station. However, instead of
waiting for the AP to send a beacon frame to all stations as with basic power management,
whenever the AP sees a frame coming from the station it will immediately release any frames
it has been holding for the station. This allows the station to sleep until it needs to send a
VoIP frame to the AP, and that frame also serves as an indicator to release any packets des-
tined for it. Once the station has received its frames it then goes back into power save mode.
There is a slight delay for the station in listen mode when using VoIP
with U-APSD while the AP gathers up and sends the frames, at
which time the station goes into receive mode.
U-APSD improves the efficiency of the basic power management in two ways: it increases
the amount of time that a station can be in power save mode and it decreases the number
of frames that a station must send and receive in order to download stored frames on the
AP. An interesting benefit of U-APSD is that, when higher data rates are used, overall
power savings increase. This is because a station will spend less time actively transmitting
and receiving and will spend more time in power save mode.
A device using U-APSD for VoIP consumes approximately one-sixth of
the power compared with not using U-APSD.
Power Save Multi-Poll (PSMP) Another enhanced power management mechanism is
the Power Save Multi-Poll (PSMP), which can have either a scheduled or an unscheduled
component. Scheduled PSMP (S-PSMP) allows an AP to send a transmission schedule to one
or more stations in a WLAN. This schedule informs the stations when they should be in active
mode to receive frames as well as when they are allowed to begin transmitting. And since a
station can only send or receive frames based on the schedule, other stations cannot interfere
with the transmissions by attempting to send simultaneously. By using a schedule, stations
can be in power save mode for the maximum amount of time without missing any frames.
Unscheduled PSMP (U-PSMP) functionality does not replace U-APSD
(WMM), but rather extends it to add further functionality.

Although an improvement over basic power management, S-PSMP still requires a significant
amount of overhead. In addition, stations may not be able to be in power save mode for
extended periods of time. For example, with VoIP transmissions the time gap for station
may be so short that the station must still remain in active mode while other stations are
receiving their VoIP packets. Generally speaking, P-SPMP is used only if the number of sta-
tions using VoIP associated with a single AP exceeds 15. If fewer than 15 stations are using
VoIP, then U-APSD should be used instead.
Spatial Multiplexing Power Save (SMPS) Spatial Multiplexing Power Save
(SMPS) can be used with IEEE 802.11n devices using Multiple-Input Multiple-Output
(MIMO). A device using MIMO may have a 2x3:2 configuration of two transmit antennas
and three receive antennas (along with two data spatial streams), each having its own radio
chain. Yet it is not necessary for all three of the receive radio chains to be simultaneously
awake. This is because the station is only waiting to receive a low data rate beacon that
may not be sent with MIMO encoding.
SMPS allows the station to change from a 2x3:2 configuration to a 1x1:1 to save power. If
the station is plugged into an electrical outlet running on alternating current (AC), it can be
configured to run using all radio chains (since conserving power is not a concern). However,
if the station begins running on a direct current (DC) battery, it will automatically “down-
shift” to 1x1:1 while waiting to receive beacons. The station would then “upshift” back to
2x3:2 when necessary.
SMPS is also called Dynamic MIMO Power Save.
A device using SMPS can downshift and then tell the AP to prevent it from sending any
MIMO-encoded frames to the device with only one receive radio chain. The AP can then
send a request to send (RTS) packet that indicates the AP is about to send a MIMO packet
so that the device can upshift to receive it.
The power savings provided by SMPS can be significant. The ability
to dynamically change the MIMO configuration can reduce power
consumption by 30 percent when the traffic is low.
Chapter Summary
■The most common type of wireless architecture is an autonomous access point archi-
tecture. Each AP is independent or autonomous from all other APs. There are several
enhanced features in this type of architecture. Two of the most advanced features are
Quality of Service (QoS) and wireless virtual LANs (VLANs). QoS provides the ability
to prioritize different types of frames so that those frames that are more time-dependent,
such as voice and video, can be given a higher priority (and arrive earlier) than
standard data frames. A wireless VLAN is often used to segment traffic. Wireless

VLANs can be configured in one of two ways. The difference depends upon which
device separates the packets and directs them to different networks.
■A controller-based architecture uses a wireless LAN controller (WLC) to manage and
provide configuration services to the WLAN. Access points in a controller-based
architecture are significantly different. A lightweight access point does not contain the
management and configuration functions that are found in autonomous access points;
instead, these features are contained in the centralized WLC. Lightweight access points
only have simplified radios for wireless communication between devices and a media
converter for accessing the wired network. A lightweight mesh AP can be used instead
of a standard mesh AP. Lightweight mesh APs can also be centrally configured and
managed through a WLC. A captive portal AP uses a standard Web browser to pro-
vide information, give the wireless user the opportunity to agree to a policy, or present
valid login credentials. The WLC is a device that can be centrally configured; these
settings are then automatically distributed to all lightweight access points.
■Besides autonomous access point architectures and control-based architectures, there
are other types of WLANs. A WLAN array is a proprietary product that resembles a
round consumer-grade smoke detector and replaces a standard WLC installed in a
rack in a server closet. The WLAN array contains a WLC that can be directly con-
nected to as many as 16 integrated access points. Cooperative control is another
proprietary technology marketed architecture that enables APs to communicate and
coordinate with each other without the need for a WLC, so that each AP contains
the capabilities of a WLC. Wireless mesh access points communicate wirelessly with
the next closest mesh access point.
■A multiple-channel architecture, or MCA, has more than one channel in the wireless
network. Each cell is separated from other cells so that no two adjacent cells have the
same channel number in order to reduce interference. An alternative to MCA is the
single-channel architecture (SCA). Instead of having each cell use a different channel as
in WCA, WLANs using SCA have all of the APs use the same channel. Each AP has
overlapping coverage that forms a continuous region on a single channel, thereby
reducing interference. The SCA architecture is accomplished through the use of
lightweight APs and WLCs.
■A wireless network management system (WNMS) is a set of hardware and/or software
that can be used to provide unified management of a wireless network. This includes
configuration management, deployment, and especially troubleshooting. A WNMS can
be used to isolate and solve wireless problems, which can have many different root
causes (station wireless configuration errors, authentication problems, connectivity
issues, problems with wired ports or switches, etc.).
■Power management allows a station to be in either active mode (continuously awake)
or in power save mode (turns off the wireless network interface card adapter to con-
serve battery life but still not miss wireless transmissions). Power management is
transparent to all protocols and applications so that it will not interfere with normal
network functions. Basic power management involves the AP temporarily storing
frames and then releasing them to the stations. Although the basic power management
features can provide power savings, there are enhanced power management technolo-
gies that can provide additional functionality and power savings. With Unscheduled
Automatic Power Save Delivery (U-APSD) a station informs the AP that it is operating

according to this protocol, and the AP will then save any frames destined for this
station. Whenever the AP sees a frame coming from the station, it will immediately
release any frames it has been holding for the station. Power Save Multi-Poll (PSMP)
allows an AP to send a transmission schedule to one or more stations in a WLAN.
This schedule informs the stations when they should be in active mode to receive
frames as well as when they are allowed to begin transmitting. Spatial Multiplexing
Power Save (SMPS) allows a station to change from a MIMO configuration to a single
radio in order to conserve power.

A key link in the chain of putting products into the hands of consumers is a distribu-
tion center (DC). DCs receive tens of thousands of different products from suppliers
all across the world each hour. The job of the DC is to store these items and then as
needed select the correct items and quantities to ship to retail stores or directly to
consumers. Most DCs have miles of conveyor belts that snake their way through the
building past racks holding the products. Workers who are stationed in specific areas
walk over and pick the required items off these racks and place them on the con-
veyor (called “pick and pass”). The items make their way to “sortation” areas, where
all of the items for a shipment are consolidated together and loaded onto a truck.
DCs are very labor-intensive operations, with many workers making multiple touches
of each and every product.
Yet instead of having workers wait by a moving conveyor belt to pick and pass
products, what if the products came directly to the workers? That’s the idea behind a
new type of DC system developed by Kiva Systems (which was purchased by Amazon
in 2012). Mobile robotic drive units bring inventory pods directly to the workers who
then select the items needed for the order. A single worker can complete an entire
order—even consisting of hundreds of products—without having to move.
When a pallet of items from a supplier enters the DC, instead of being moved by a
forklift to be stored on a rack, it is instead placed onto a pod base. The pod base
(along with the pallet) is then moved by the robots, which have been called “fast-
moving orange tortoises.” When an order comes in for that product, the robots
bring the entire pallet to a stationary worker at a packing station, where the items
are selected, packed into boxes, and loaded onto trucks. The use of these intelligent
robots makes it possible to build more flexibility into the process. For example, the
sequence of the robots can be controlled so that heavier items arrive first (to be
placed at the bottom of the shipping box) before lighter items arrive. In addition,
items that are more popular (such as Christmas ornaments in December) can be
located closer to packing stations to reduce the time needed to reach the station.
The robotic drive units navigate by reading removable optical markers that form a
grid pattern on the DC’s floor, so it is not necessary to bury wires in the floor’s con-
crete. The drive units are battery powered and can operate for up to eight hours on
a single charge. (When the batteries begin to run low, the drive unit automatically
goes to a charging station on the floor and plugs itself in.) Controlling software deci-
des which order goes to which operator, which drive unit retrieves which pod, and
which path a drive unit should take to reach the packing station. Because the drive
units are portable, the software communicates with them using wireless local area
network technology, which can also interface with any existing WLAN in the DC.

One of the unique challenges of setting up a wireless LAN (WLAN) is determining the opti-
mum location for the access points (APs) and other wireless devices. Because obstacles such
as walls, floors, elevator shafts, and even people can impact the radio frequency (RF) signal,
it is important to take these factors into consideration prior to installing equipment. In addi-
tion, as conditions continue to change—new office walls are installed or old walls removed,
more wireless users are added to the network, competing wireless networks are installed in
neighboring offices—it is important to monitor and adjust the WLAN to keep it operating at
peak efficiency. This involves using a variety of specific tools and established procedures.
In this chapter you explore the necessary steps for locating wireless equipment by performing
a site survey. First you learn what a site survey is and about the different types of surveys.
Next, you explore the tools that are used to conduct the survey. Finally, you look at how to
gather the necessary data and conduct a survey.

Most users, when installing a WLAN in a home or apartment, generally do not give much
time to determining the optimum location for the wireless router so that its RF signal coverage
is uniform throughout the house but extends outside it as little as possible. Instead, these
devices are typically placed wherever it is convenient, such as next to the Internet connection,
near a desktop computer, or even tucked away on a bookcase that happens to have enough
space to accommodate it. If the wireless signal happens not to reach into the far corners of
the house or outside onto an outdoors deck, then those areas are simply recognized as being
“dead space” and are just avoided when using the network.
However, when installing a WLAN for an organization, areas of dead space may not be so
easily tolerated. Whereas at home a user may simply move to another room, that may not
always be possible in a building with multiple offices, locked doors, and private cubicles.
This means important considerations must be taken into account when installing a new
WLAN for an organization: all areas of a building should have adequate wireless coverage,
all employees must have a reasonable amount of bandwidth, and, for security reasons,
The technology provided by Kiva Systems is not cheap. The least expensive system
costs $1 million for 30 robots and two packing stations, while systems for large DCs
usually cost between $4 million to $6 million. (Soon it will be possible to lease Kiva
Systems technology for high-peak seasonal times.) Yet with worker efficiency
increased by up to 400 percent, Kiva’s wireless devices may become the wave of the
future.

a minimum amount of wireless signal should “bleed” outside the walls of the building. A vari-
ety of factors can impact these goals, such as:
●
Are there machines and electronic devices—such as cordless phones, lighting, satellite
dishes, or microwave ovens—emitting radio waves that could interfere with or even
block the WLAN signals?
●
Will the wireless network be in an open environment with few walls or structures to
block the signal, or will the network be installed in a warehouse or office that is filled
with steel beams, concrete pillars, large filing cabinets, and heavy machinery that could
reduce the range of the signal?
●
Are office and conference room doors frequently closed or do they remain open?
●
Will machinery be periodically moved to different locations?
●
Are partitions moved frequently?
●
Is the company expanding its physical plant or adding more employees that might
impact wireless transmissions?
●
Is there any potential interference from existing internal WLANs?
●
Could there be interference from wireless signals from outside the organization, such
as from a nearby building?
Assuring that a WLAN can provide its intended functionality and meet its required design
goals can best be achieved through a site survey. A site survey is an in-depth examination
and analysis of a WLAN site. There are several reasons for conducting a site survey, just as
there are different types of surveys.
Purpose of a Site Survey
A site survey is more than determining the location for a new AP. Instead, site surveys have
several different design goals:
●
Achieve the best possible performance from the WLAN
●
Certify that the installation will operate as promised
●
Determine the best location for APs
●
Develop networks optimized for a variety of applications
●
Ensure that the coverage will fulfill the organization’s requirements
●
Locate any unauthorized APs on the network
●
Map any nearby wireless networks to determine existing radio interference
●
Reduce radio interference as much as possible
●
Make the wireless network secure
Often the success or failure of a wireless network can be directly
linked to the thoroughness of the site survey.

A site survey provides a realistic understanding of the infrastructure required for the
installation of a new wireless network. It also assists in predicting network capability and
throughput, as well as indicating the exact location of APs and power levels required.
Where applicable, interference from existing devices or neighboring sites is also addressed
during the site survey.
Conducting a site survey is both an art and a science. Some of the
steps in a site survey involve taking detailed measurements, but
other steps can require a combination of experience and trial and
error to achieve optimal results.
When to Perform a Site Survey
Although a site survey should be performed prior to installing a WLAN, a site survey is
important other times, too. This is because a variety of factors can change the performance
of the wireless network, and these factors may not have been in existence or may have signif-
icantly changed since the original survey. These factors include:
●
Physical changes to a building. Remodeling can introduce new sources of interference
within the coverage area of the AP, such as motors or metal structures.
●
Changes to an existing wireless network. When modifying or extending an existing
network structure, it is important to reevaluate the placement of the APs and antennas.
●
Changes in network needs. If employees are performing significantly different duties,
such as downloading large files on a regular basis, then a new site survey should be
performed.
●
Significant changes in personnel. Adding several new employees to an office or moving
employees from one area to another area may necessitate a new site survey.
Site surveys fall into four different categories, based on when they are conducted. These are
summarized in Table 8-1.
Site Survey Category
Description
Predeployment Site Surveys
Prior to installing one or more APs, a predeployment survey should be
conducted. The purpose of this survey is to understand the RF signal
behavior in the specific environment.
Postdeployment Site Surveys
After the WLAN is installed, it is important to thoroughly test the setup
to ensure that all of the APs are providing the necessary coverage.
Periodic Site Surveys
This “health check” site survey is generally not as thorough as a
postdeployment survey. Instead, the purpose is simply to check that the
WLAN is functioning as expected from the perspective of a client
device.
Troubleshooting Site Surveys
When the WLAN is not functioning as anticipated a troubleshooting
site survey can help to identify the reason for the inadequate
performance.

Many organizations perform a periodic site survey regularly once
each quarter.
One of the primary factors dictating the need for site surveys is the ever-changing environ-
ment in which the RF signal must be transmitted. Closed doors, newly installed walls, addi-
tional employees, and other factors all can impact the RF signal. Would it be possible for
the wireless devices to monitor the environment and then automatically adjust power levels
or channels to compensate for changes? This type of dynamic “self-managing” WLAN uses
what is known as automated RF resource management. There are currently available wire-
less network management systems (WNMS) using lightweight APs and wireless LAN control-
lers (WLCs) that can monitor the environment and make changes “on the fly.” These
WNMS take advantage of such technologies as transmit power control (TPC) found in IEEE
802.11a WLANs. TPC sends this information to the wireless devices and also indicates the
maximum transmit power allowed in the WLAN and the transmit power the AP is currently
using. The device then responds with its own transmit power capability. The AP uses this
data to determine the maximum power for this WLAN network segment so that the radio
power can be adjusted dynamically. Despite the fact that automated RF resource manage-
ment can make some dynamic adjustments, it is not considered a substitute for a site survey.
TPC, WNMS, lightweight APs, and WLCs are covered in Chapter 5.
Types of Site Surveys
There are two types of site surveys. A manual site survey typically involves walking through
the WLAN area while carrying a wireless client like a laptop or tablet computer. A site sur-
vey software application installed on the computer allows for different network measure-
ments to be taken and recorded as the surveyor moves through the area.
Manual site surveys can be divided into two subcategories. A passive manual site survey is
used to gather information regarding the RF characteristics on the premises by collecting RF
measurements, such as signal strengths, noise levels, and the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The
survey is “passive” because the wireless client device is only listening to packets as they are
sent and received. An active manual site survey can provide more insight into the network
connectivity and its performance. This type of manual survey involves both receiving as well
as sending packets to determine the status of the WLAN. Packet loss, packet delay, associated
APs, and other information can then be gathered. In addition, an active manual site survey
can reveal the locations and other details about all the APs such as the MAC addresses,
channels, and service set identifiers (SSIDs) in the network.
The second type of site survey is a predictive site survey. Instead of requiring a human sur-
veyor to walk through an area with a portable wireless device, a predictive site survey is a
virtual survey of the area that uses modeling techniques to design the wireless network. In a
predictive site survey, the building floor plans are loaded into the predictive analysis simula-
tion application survey software (also called RF planning and management tools) used to

develop a wireless network design. Predictive site survey application and verification tools
can account for building materials, square footage, the number of wireless users, types of
applications, antenna models and other variables in a simulated environment to provide a
wireless plan for the facility. This also allows for changes to the proposed design to be
quickly tested in a “what-if” scenario, something that would be much more difficult with a
manual site survey. An example of a predictive analysis simulation application is illustrated
in Figure 8-1.

Performing an outdoor site survey is considered much more difficult than an indoor survey,
because of the difficulty in obtaining accurate data. The type of data needed for an outdoor
site survey includes:
●
Height and material of the buildings, light poles, or other structures that are to host
an AP.
●
Location, size, and density of areas where trees, foliage, hills, or other obstacles may
interfere with the signal.
●
Types of applications or the desired bandwidth to be carried.

●
Availability of power at each building, light pole, or outbuilding to power the APs.
●
Availability of data connectivity at each location.
In addition, this information must often be multiplied several times over different areas. That
is because remote wireless bridges are commonly used in outdoor settings to connect two or
more networks that are separated by a longer distance, and information of the area around
each bridge must be obtained. Because of the complexity of an outdoor site survey, many
wireless professionals recommend that a predictive site survey first be conducted followed by
a manual survey.
Due to the low cost of wireless infrastructure devices, such as APs
and wireless routers, some individuals advocate a different approach.
In areas in which it is difficult or costly to obtain accurate informa-
tion for the site survey, instead of spending large amounts of time
and money in a site survey, they suggest that it is more cost-
effective to simply install multiple lower-cost APs in a “best-guess” of a good location,
knowing that multiple devices will provide sufficient signal strength to users. However, signal
strength is only one factor to be considered; without proper coordination, different devices
may actually interfere with each other. The best approach is to perform a site survey when
at all possible.

Different tools are useful when conducting a site survey. For a predictive site survey, all
that is needed are the area’s floor plans and the survey software. Most predictive site sur-
vey software uses AutoCAD drawing (.dwg) files with embedded detail about building
materials. If AutoCAD files are not available, it is possible to import simple floor plan
images created in formats such Portable Network Graphics (.png), Joint Photographic
Experts Group (.jpg), Graphics Interchange Format (.gif), or Bitmap Image File (.bmp). If
a simple floor plan image is used in predictive site survey software, the user must also
input data to establish the scale, describe walls and windows, itemize RF barriers on each
floor, and so on.
There are several of predictive site survey Web sites that allow users
to upload floor plan images. Some of these sites will be used in the
hands-on projects at the end of this chapter.
For manual site surveys, a wide variety of tools are available. Whereas some tools can be
combined into a single hardware “bundle” that includes the necessary software installed on a

dedicated hardware device, other software tools can be installed and used individually on dif-
ferent devices. These manual site survey tools include wireless device tools and specialized
tools. In addition, special consideration may be given to performing a site survey in an area
in which voice communications over the WLAN are used.
Wireless Device Tools
Access points and wireless network interface card adapters generally include software tools
that can be used to perform a basic site survey. However, these tools are rudimentary at
best and should not be substituted for more sophisticated tools; rather, they can sometimes
be used as the starting point for a survey.
Because a site survey focuses on the proper location of APs, the most basic tool in a site
survey is the AP itself. With some APs, it is possible to adjust the output power; this can
be important when conducting a survey. Figure 8-2 shows the setting on an AP for adjust-
ing the power levels with a slider bar. Other APs use specific increments (Maximum, 100,
50, 30, 20, 5 and 1) while some use predefined settings (High, Ultra High, Super, and
Extreme).
Most consumer-grade wireless routers do not have the capability to
adjust power levels.
Access points operate on alternating current (AC) from an electrical outlet, but when testing
the optimal location of an AP there may not always be an electrical outlet nearby. In that
case, a DC-to-AC converter, which converts direct current (DC) from a battery to AC, can
be used to power the AP.

When performing a basic site survey another desirable feature for
an AP is to have connections for attaching an external antenna.
This can be helpful when determining if an amplifier can be used
to increase the amplitude of an RF signal instead of relocating
the AP.
In addition to APs, another essential wireless tool is a wireless device such as a notebook or
tablet computer with a wireless NIC. These are used to determine the signal strength received
from the AP. All operating systems display signal strength, and many manufacturers bundle
client utilities with their wireless NICs that show signal strength. Some of these client utilities
display the Receive Signal Strength Indicator (RSSI); however, the RSSI should not be relied
upon as a valid indicator. Other client utilities represent signal strength as a percentage (the
percentage represents the RSSI for a particular packet divided by the maximum RSSI value,
and then multiplied by 100). Often these utilities only display bars to indicate signal strength
quality without any indication of what the bars represent, much like that of a cell phone.
This is illustrated in Figure 8-3. However, because these utilities are not precise, they can
only give a rough approximation of the necessary information needed for a site survey.
RSSI is covered in Chapter 3.

Specialized Tools
Specialized site survey tools can provide an accurate picture of the environment and better
assist in the precise placement of an AP and in troubleshooting. These specialized tools
include dedicated site survey applications, spectrum analyzers, protocol analyzers, and docu-
mentation tools.
Dedicated Applications Instead of simply looking at packets received, as when using
wireless device tools, dedicated site survey application software can also send packets and
then analyze both transmitting and receiving data. Dedicated applications either have limited
features or can be more full-featured. A full-featured site survey analyzer software setup
screen is seen in Figure 8-4. Some of the settings include:
●
Destination MAC Address. This specifies the AP that will be involved in the test. The
default is the MAC address of the AP with which the client adapter is currently
associated.
●
Continuous Link Test. Checking this box will cause the Active Mode test to run
repeatedly until the Stop button on the Site Survey page is clicked.
●
Number of Packets. This sets the quantity of packets that will be sent during the test.
●
Packet Size. This parameter sets the size of the packets that will be sent during the test.
The Packet Size setting should match the packet size typically found during normal
WLAN use.
●
Data Retries. The Data Retries sets the number of times a transmission will be repeated
if an acknowledgement (ACK) frame is not returned by the destination device.

●
Data Rate. This parameter sets the bit rate at which packets will be transmitted.
●
Delay Between Packets. The delay in milliseconds between successive transmissions is
set here.
●
Packet Tx Type. This parameter sets the packet type that will be used during the test.
A unicast transmission means that a frame is sent from one sender to a single receiver.
A multicast transmission means that a frame is sent from one sender to multiple recei-
vers with a single “transmit” operation. Selecting the Unicast option means that the
station will expect an ACK back from the destination and will continue to retry if it
does not receive one. The Multicast option does not perform packet retries.
●
Percent Success Threshold. This parameter allows the user to establish a baseline for
what is considered satisfactory performance. Percentages that are greater than or equal
to the Percent Success Threshold will be displayed as green bars while percentages
below this value will show as yellow bars on the Percent Successful diagram.
The statistics that are generated by the site survey analyzer can be seen in Figure 8-5.
Because these statistics are generated in real time, users can freely roam through the cover-
age area while gathering statistics and viewing the relative signal strength on a bar graph.
Basic survey analyzer software contains far fewer features. A basic site survey analyzer soft-
ware setup screen is seen in Figure 8-6 and the results displayed in Figure 8-7. These analy-
zers may make it more difficult to conduct the site survey because they provide limited data.
Spectrum Analyzer A spectrum analyzer is a device that scans the RF spectrum
(2.4 GHz or 5 GHz for WLANs) and can locate potential sources of interference. Spectrum

analyzers are passive receivers: they do not make any changes to the signal but instead dis-
play it in a way that makes it easy to analyze. Spectrum analyzers usually display the raw
and unprocessed signal information such as frequency, voltage, power, period, and the
shape of the RF “wave.” The most common spectrum analyzer measurements are modula-
tion, distortion, and noise.
Spectrum analyzers can make site surveys a “hit-or-miss” proposi-
tion by indicating there is an area of interference so that the AP
should be moved to avoid the interference. However, if it is necessary
to move the AP then the spectrum analyzer should be run again to
determine if the interference has been minimized or eliminated.
Until recently, the drawback to using spectrum analyzer devices has been their high cost,
ranging from $10,000 to $40,000. However, new low-cost spectrum analyzers in the form
of a USB device that is inserted into a computer have made spectrum analysis much more
affordable. Figure 8-8 illustrates the output from a USB spectrum analyzer. The views
(charts) are described in Table 8-2.

Some USB spectrum analyzers sell for under $50.
Protocol Analyzer Wireless network traffic can be viewed by a stand-alone protocol
analyzer device or a computer that runs protocol analyzer software. A protocol analyzer
(also called a sniffer) is hardware or software that captures packets to decode and analyze
its contents, as shown in Figure 8-9. Protocol analyzers can fully decode application-layer
network protocols, such as HTTP or FTP.
Sniffer is technically a trademark name of the Sniffer Network
Analyzer product. The more generic term protocol analyzer is preferred.

Protocol analyzers, which can be either integrated into other products or standalone, are
widely used by network administrators for monitoring a network. The common uses include:
●
Network troubleshooting. Protocol analyzers can detect and diagnose network
problems such as addressing errors and protocol configuration mistakes.
●
Network traffic characterization. Protocol analyzers can be used to paint a picture of
the types and makeup of network. This helps to fine-tune the network and manage
bandwidth in order to provide the highest level of service to users.
Documentation Tools Another category of tools for conducting a site survey is docu-
mentation tools. The purpose of these tools is to create documentation of the site survey
results so they will be available for future reference. A sample documentation form is illus-
trated in Figure 8-10. Although there is no industry-standard form for site survey documen-
tation, these forms should include the following information:
●
Purpose of the report

Survey methods
●
RF coverage details (frequency and channel plan)
●
Throughput findings

Because of the amount of data created in a site survey and because a survey needs to be readily
accessible for updates, it may be advisable to create a database to store the site survey informa-
tion and generate reports. Storing the information in a database instead of using a word pro-
cessor makes it much easier to consolidate and then search for and retrieve information.
Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi) Tools and Surveys
Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi), which is the implementation of Voice over IP (VoIP) telephony on
a WLAN, requires special considerations when performing a site survey. This type of trans-
mission depends heavily upon each frame arriving in sequence, whereas data transmissions
are not as sensitive to time. Delays in voice transmission can result in a voice conversation
that has gaps of dead space.
Three major considerations must be taken into account when planning for VoWiFi:
●
Packet loss. Lost packets can be accommodated in data transmission by requesting
that a packet be resent. However, in VoWiFi a high number of lost packets can cause
a noticeable impact on voice communications. Ideally packet loss in a VoWiFi network
should be less than one percent of the total number of packets sent.
●
Delay. Unlike packet loss, in which a packet never reaches its destination, delay is the
amount of acceptable time that a late packet can arrive and still be used. If the delay of
a packet is too long, an echo can be detected that will impact the voice quality. For
VoWiFi, delay should be less than 50 milliseconds.
●
Jitter. Jitter is the measure of delay between packets. Less than 5 milliseconds is con-
sidered the acceptable jitter in a VoWiFi.
When performing a site survey for a WLAN environment that will support VoWiFi, it is
recommended that the primary tools used are the built-in tools in the VoWiFi handset itself.
These tools provide a true measurement of the RF environment based upon the radio of the
VoWiFi handset. Other wireless tools can be used to provide additional assistance during the
site survey if necessary.
The basic approach to planning for VoWiFi is to have overlap between adjacent cells of cov-
erage area to ensure that there is sufficient RF signal strength present during a handoff
between the cells. In an indoor office environment, it is recommended that the radio signal
strength at the cell coverage boundary does not drop below –70 decibel milliwatts (dBm).
This means that APs should be positioned so as to overlap their boundaries by approximately
6–10 dB. This is illustrated in Figure 8-11.
Technically, when the VoWiFi handset reaches a point where the RSSI
is –70 dBm, that handset is also inside the adjacent cell. The RSSI
from this AP is between –60 to –64 dBm.
Another consideration is that of antenna use in a VoWiFi handset. The IEEE 802.11n stan-
dard takes advantage of advanced Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO) technology that

uses multiple antennas and multiple radios resulting in higher speeds. However, MIMO’s
benefits may not have a significant advantage to a VoWiFi handset. This is because MIMO
requires more than one radio channel and antenna, which in turn means more power and
hardware space is needed in the VoWiFi handset. For this reason many VoFiFi handsets do
not support 802.11n and do not have multiple antennas. However, some VoWiFi handsets
support load balancing of moving a new call to an alternate channel that is less congested.
When conducting a site survey to design a WLAN for VoWiFi sup-
port, it is recommended that the network be designed to support a
maximum of 10 simultaneous active calls per AP at any given time.
This is significantly less than the number of simultaneous data users
typically supported by an AP.

Gathering Data
Much of the work in a site survey is actually performed prior to setting up an AP and testing
its RF pattern. This preliminary work of gathering the necessary “non-RF” data is critical to
performing an effective site survey. Gathering data for a site survey involves examining

business requirements, defining physical and security requirements, gathering site-specific docu-
mentation, documenting existing network characteristics, and analyzing technical requirements.
Examining Business Requirements The first step is to determine the business rea-
sons why a WLAN is being proposed for the organization or why an existing wireless net-
work is being expanded. Without understanding the reasons why the network is needed it
will be almost impossible to properly design and implement the network. This involves
examining the business’ requirements needed in order to properly function.
The most common business requirement is that a wireless network provides mobility to its
users. Yet it is important to understand what type of mobility is required. Are the users con-
tinually in motion, such as in a warehouse or hospital? Or do the users work from different
fixed locations throughout the site? Can the desired mobility be accomplished by installing a
single AP in a conference room, or is it necessary to have APs throughout the entire floor of
the building? Also, what types of applications will be used on the WLAN? And what types
of devices will be connecting to the network?
Another requirement is to determine the amount of bandwidth that the users require. This is a
function of the type of activity that users will be performing on the WLAN. Users need higher
data rates for time-bound transmissions, such as audio and video. However, users who need
basic data access may not need the higher bandwidth. And, there are different types of data
users. A user who needs to frequently download large data files will need more bandwidth
than a user who occasionally uses the wireless network to check e-mail or visit a Web site.
If wireless devices require higher data rates the number of users per
AP may need to be limited, which requires more APs to be installed.
Examining business requirements usually involves performing interviews with key organiza-
tion personnel. There are a variety of different types of interviews. These include:
●
One-on-one interviews. This is the most common interview technique. It involves ask-
ing questions of a key stakeholder for the purpose of gathering information. Usually
this type of interview should be planned well ahead of the actual interview so that
the interviewee can be prepared with the necessary information. The interview can be
tailored to discuss current processes, uncover future needs, or determine the problems
that need to be resolved.
Unlike a television courtroom drama, the purpose of a one-on-one
interview is not to “trip up” the interviewee so that they reveal a
secret. Instead, one-on-one interviews should help the interviewee
put into words any thoughts and ideas that may not have been
clearly articulated before.
●
Group interviews. A group interview has the same goal as a one-on-one interview yet
has the added benefit of several of the participants discussing and exchanging ideas
between each other, as well as being able to provide multiple dimensions of the same
answer. However, group interviews often are more difficult to conduct because of the

larger number of participants and because they may not see “eye-to-eye.” This can
make it difficult for the interviewer to filter out the actual answers.
●
Facilitated sessions. In a facilitated session, a much larger group consisting of all
primary and secondary stakeholders are gathered together with the goal of remaining
together until all the requirements are gathered. Usually a trained facilitator is needed
to keep the group “on track” and functioning productively towards the goal.
●
Questionnaires. Although paper or electronic questionnaires are often used, in reality
these can have a limited value. Many respondents hurry through a questionnaire
without giving it adequate thought. In addition, although questionnaire results can be
statistically tabulated, these numbers many not reflect the reasons behind specific
responses or provide deeper insight into the questions.
Questionnaires should be used for gathering quick statistics to get a
sense of the relative priority of issues. They should not be a substi-
tute for interviews.
●
Shadowing. Although the most time-consuming for both the interviewer and the inter-
viewee, following the interviewee around while he performs his normal duties gives the
interviewer opportunities to ask questions and receive answers as actual practices
occur. This is helpful when work routines have become so ingrained that people have
a hard time explaining why they do what they do.
Defining Physical and Security Requirements Because WLANs use unsecured
radio waves to transmit data, security is an important consideration when gathering data
for a site survey. It is necessary to consider what type of data encryption will be used and
the type of authentication that will take place across the WLAN. In addition, it is critical to
understand current security policies and procedures that are already in force. The WLAN
must fit into the organization’s overall security scheme in order to provide the best protec-
tion for all data resources.
WLAN security is covered in detail in Chapters 9 and 10.
In addition to security requirements, the physical requirements must be examined as well.
Where will the APs be located? Can they be secured? Is there a sufficient cable infrastructure
for connecting the APs to the wired network? Will additional switches, routers, and other
physical equipment need to be installed?
Gathering Site-Specific Documentation Once the business and physical and
security requirements are understood, the next step is to gather site-specific documentation.
This information is generally accumulated in two ways.
First, blueprints, facility drawings, and other documents can be obtained that show specific
building infrastructure components. These include electrical outlets for APs, potential sources
of RF interference like elevator shafts, and the type of ventilation system that may dictate the
placement of APs.

However, blueprints and other similar documents may not reveal the current state of the
building, particularly if it is older. Walls may have been changed or added, additional elec-
trical outlets installed, and offices carved out of what was once open space. The only way to
gather current information is through the second method, inspecting the site. The purpose of
this walk-through is to document any changes to the blueprints and also to gain a visual
perspective of the site. When conducting an inspection it may be necessary to have equip-
ment available such as a ladder, flashlight, cellular telephone, and other resources for peer-
ing into remote locations. For a larger organization, it may be necessary to have an
approved escort from the organization accompany the team. This person should be autho-
rized to enter offices and closets. It may be necessary for the escort to have a set of master
keys in order to provide access to locked areas.
Documenting Existing Network Characteristics Another task is to document
the existing wireless and wired networks. The reason for this is to ensure that the new or
expanded WLAN will dovetail into what is already in place. Questions that should be
asked include:
●
How does the current network support the organization’s mission?
●
What applications run on the network?
●
How many users does it support?
●
What are the strengths and weaknesses of the current network?
●
What is the anticipated growth in network technology?
How the network supports the organization is an important consideration. Examining the
current status of the network, especially the applications that run on the network and the
number of users, can reveal much of this information. The question regarding the strengths
and weaknesses of the network can begin to identify why a new or expanded wireless net-
work may be needed.
With the rapid growth of networks it is not uncommon for servers and clients to be added
to the network to meet an immediate need without properly documenting the changes. Doc-
umentation of the current network may include a table that summarizes information about
the network. Some of the types of information that should be included in the current
network document include:
●
Number of clients
●
Types of clients
●
Number of servers
●
The topology of the network
●
What media is being used
●
Performance of the network
●
Types of devices connected to the network
A sample current network table is seen in Table 8-3. Depending on the complexity of the
network, a diagram of the network may also be necessary.

Analyzing Technical Requirements Gathering data to determine the technical
requirements for the WLAN is also important. Table 8-4 list several WLAN requirements
while Table 8-5 lists wireless technical considerations. These questions should be answered

Performing the Survey
Once the necessary data has been accumulated, the next step is to actually perform the sur-
vey. This involves not only AP configuration and location but also identifying interference.
In addition, understanding the difference between outdoor surveys and indoor surveys is
important.
Access Point Configuration and Location The first step is to decide on the type
of AP that will be used. These options typically include autonomous APs, controller-based
architectures (lightweight, mesh, or captive portal APs), WLAN arrays, cooperative control,
and mesh networks. In addition, the correct type of antenna (omnidirectional or semidirec-
tional) must be determined and matched with the AP.
The next step is to configure the AP for the optimum power output and channel assign-
ments. Enterprise-class APs often have the ability to adjust the power levels with a slider
bar, in specific increments, or using a predefined setting. With IEEE 802.11b/g the available
frequency spectrum (2.412 to 2.484 GHz) is divided into 11 channels, and only three of
which are nonoverlapping channels are available for simultaneous operation. Within each
802.11a frequency channel there is a channel 20-MHz wide that supports 52 carrier signals,
with each signal 300 KHz wide. IEEE 802.11a networks have 555 MHz spread across 23
nonoverlapping channels.
Once the configuration is complete the AP can be placed in a temporary location. This may
not be the final location for the AP, but it will give a starting point. If an omnidirectional
antenna is being used, then the AP should be placed in the center of the room or coverage
area as much as possible; if a semidirectional antenna is used then the AP should be posi-
tioned in one corner of the room. Once the AP is placed, its position should be noted along
with the orientation of the antennas. This can be done by drawing it on a blueprint or map
of the room along with a narrative description. Recording the position of APs and antennas
with a digital camera is also helpful.
When performing a manual site survey, using a portable device with the appropriate soft-
ware measurement tools running, the surveyor should start at the closest point to the AP
and slowly walk away in one direction. While walking, it is important to observe the data
being displayed by the software measurement tools. As the surveyor continues to move, the
data can be recorded.
In addition to walking through the site with the software measure-
ment tools running, it is important to test the actual applications to
be used in the network.
Identifying Interference It is rare for a site survey not to detect any interference that
would impede the RF signal. One consideration is the interference of radio signals from
other objects. Table 8-6 lists different types of objects and the degree of interference that
they may cause. Based on the amount of interference, it may be necessary to relocate the
AP or reorient the antenna in order to reduce interference.
Another type of interference can come from another nearby WLAN, when either both net-
works attempt to use the same channel or an adjacent channel. If all of the APs were set to

the same channel number then it would result in reduced throughput because each station
must wait a longer period of time for their turn to transmit (cochannel interference). To
eliminate this it is necessary to arrange the coverage areas of the APs so that one channel
does not interfere with an adjacent channel. Each cell is separated from other cells so
that no two adjacent cells have the same channel number in order to reduce interference
(adjacent channel interference).
Outdoor Surveys Outdoor surveys follow the same basic steps listed for a WLAN
indoor site survey, with some additional considerations. For example, if the survey is taken
in the fall or winter after deciduous trees and bushes have lost their foliage, it should be
noted that the leaves could impact the RF signal after they have grown back. In addition,
climatic conditions may need to be taken into account. In areas with large amounts of rain-
fall or fog, these elements should be taken into account when placing APs or transmitters.
And, if the antenna must be installed on a rooftop, there should be ready access to that
location.

Outdoor antennas are usually affixed to a pole or mast, which serves the dual purpose of
improved reception and a discouragement to thieves. Antenna mounting systems are avail-
able that can secure the antenna yet can quickly be unlocked to lower the antenna for repair
or maintenance. Just as an antenna is designed to pick up RF signals, it also can inadver-
tently pick up high electrical discharges from a nearby lightning strike (or contact with a
high-voltage electrical source). A lightning arrestor, which limits the amplitude and disturb-
ing interference voltages by channeling them to the ground, should always be used with out-
door antennas.
Prior to any installation of an outdoor antenna the necessary permits must be secured from
the local municipality. In addition, all zoning requirements must be met. Because outdoor
antennas can be unattractive, camouflaging the antenna in order to provide the proper
aesthetics is always desirable.
Creating the Site Survey Report
The final step is to create the site survey report. Although the reporting methodology may
differ, site survey reports generally have two parts: a narrative section and a graphical
section.
The narrative section should begin by stating the requirements from the customer regarding
what they wanted from the site survey. This ensures that the material in the report focuses
on the problems to be addressed. The narrative section should also outline how the survey
was conducted, known as the methodology. It is important to clearly outline in this section
all of the steps that were taken in preparation for the survey and in the course of conducting
the survey itself. This makes it clear to the reader that the survey follows a recognized and
methodical pattern, and shortcuts or questionable actions were not taken. The narrative sec-
tion should also clearly state the results of the measurements as well as an analysis for the
capacity and a verification of the coverage.
The final part of the site survey narrative should include hardware, software, and networking
recommendations regarding the WLAN. Typically a bill of materials (BOM) is included. A
BOM itemizes every software and/or hardware component that is needed for the new
WLAN. In addition, options regarding how best to install and configure the wireless net-
work. The report should also include an analysis for the capacity of the network and a verifi-
cation of the coverage area.
The graphic section generally includes maps and diagrams of the coverage area. A data rate
coverage map, as seen in Figure 8-12, is typical. More sophisticated maps, such as a 3-D
SNR plot like that in Figure 8-13 can also be supplied if the customer specifically requested
that type of information in advance.

Chapter Summary
■One of the challenges of setting up a WLAN is determining the best location for APs
and other wireless devices. Obstacles such as walls, floors, elevator shafts, and even
people can impact the RF signal. This makes it important to take these into consider-
ation prior to installing equipment. In addition, as conditions continue to change in
the office environment, it is important to monitor and adjust the WLAN. A site survey
is an in-depth examination and analysis of a WLAN site.
■Although a site survey should be performed prior to installing a WLAN, conducting a
site survey is important other times as well. This is because a variety of factors can

change the performance of the wireless network, and these factors may not have been
in existence or may have significantly changed since the original survey.
■A manual site survey typically involves walking through the area of the WLAN while
carrying a wireless client like a laptop or tablet computer. A site survey software
application installed on the computer allows for different network measurements to be
taken and recorded as the surveyor moves through the area. Instead of walking
through an area with a portable wireless device, a predictive site survey is a virtual
survey of the area that uses modeling techniques to design the wireless network. When
conducting a predictive site survey, it’s necessary to load the building floor plans into
the predictive analysis simulation application survey software. This software is then
used to develop a wireless network design.
■Different tools can be used when conducting a site survey. For a predictive site survey
all that is needed is the predictive analysis simulation application survey software
along with the area’s floor plans. For manual site surveys, a wider variety of tools are
useful. Access points and wireless network interface card adapters generally include
software tools that can be used to perform a basic site survey. However, these tools are
rudimentary at best and should not substitute for more sophisticated tools. Dedicated
site survey application software can also send packets and then analyze both transmit-
ting and receiving data. A spectrum analyzer is a device that scans the RF spectrum
and can locate potential sources of interference. A protocol analyzer is hardware or
software that captures packets to decode and analyze its contents. Documentation
tools can be used to record the site survey results so they will be available for future
reference. Voice over WiFi (VoWiFi), which is the implementation of Voice over
IP (VoIP) telephony on a WLAN, requires special considerations when performing a
site survey.
■There are three basic steps in conducting a site survey. The first is gathering the back-
ground data. Gathering data for a site survey involves examining business require-
ments, defining physical and security requirements, gathering site-specific documenta-
tion, documenting existing network characteristics, and analyzing technical
requirements. Once the necessary data has been accumulated, the next step is to actu-
ally perform the survey. This involves not only AP configuration and location but also
identifying interference. When performing a manual site survey using a portable device
with the appropriate software measurement tools running, the surveyor should start at
the closest point to the AP and slowly walk away in one direction. While walking, it is
important to observe the data being displayed by the software measurement tools. It is
rare that a site survey would not detect any interference that would impede the RF
signal. This information should be analyzed so that the AP can be relocated if
necessary.
■Outdoor surveys follow the same basic steps listed for a WLAN indoor site survey yet
there are additional considerations. If the survey is taken in the fall or winter after
deciduous trees and bushes have lost their foliage, it should be noted that the leaves
could impact the RF signal after they have grown back. In addition, climatic condi-
tions may need to be taken into account. In areas with large amounts of rainfall or
fog, these elements should be taken into account when placing APs or transmitters.
And, if the antenna must be installed on a rooftop, there should be ready access to
that location.

■The final step is to create the site survey report. Although the reporting methodology
may differ, site survey reports generally have two parts, a narrative section and a
graphical section. The narrative section should begin by stating the requirements from
the customer regarding what they wanted from the site survey. This ensures that the
material in the report focuses on the problems to be addressed. The narrative section
should also outline how the survey was conducted, known as the methodology. The
final part of the site survey narrative should include hardware, software, and net-
working recommendations regarding the WLAN.

Case Projects
Case Project 8-1: Automated RF Resource Management
There are several wireless network management systems (WNMS) using
lightweight APs and wireless LAN controllers (WLCs) that can monitor the
environment and make changes on the fly by using automated RF resource
management tools. Use the Internet to research automated RF resource management tools.
How do they work? What are their advantages and disadvantages? Would you recommend
using one? Write a one-page paper on your findings.
Case Project 8-2: Predictive Site Survey Application
Use the Internet to research three predictive site survey application. Create a table that com-
pares the features of each one. How do they work? What are their advantages over manual
site surveys? What file types can be used to import building floor plans? Write a one-page
paper about your research.
Case Project 8-3: Inexpensive Spectrum Analyzers
The drawback to using spectrum analyzer devices has been their high cost, ranging from
$10,000 to $40,000. Recently, low-cost spectrum analyzers in the form of a USB device
that is inserted into a computer have made spectrum analysis much more affordable.
Research inexpensive spectrum analyzers and identify three different models. Compare their
features in a table, including system requirements and costs. Next compare them to a full-
featured spectrum analyzer. In your opinion, could the inexpensive spectrum analyzers be
used as an alternative to the full-featured models, or only as a supplement? Why? Write a
one-page paper on your research.
Case Project 8-4: Open Source Protocol Analyzers
Whereas at one time protocol analyzers were proprietary and expensive, today there are sev-
eral excellent protocol analyzers that are their open source or free products. Research these
protocol analyzers, such as Wireshark, Colasoft’s Capsa, Packetyzer, and others. Which
product would you recommend for capturing and analyzing wireless traffic? Why? Write a
paper on the information that you find.
Case Project 8-5: Nautilus IT Consulting
Nautilus IT Consulting (NITC), a computer technology business, needs your assistance with
one of their new clients.
Gabe’s Grill is a chain of restaurants with several locations in the area. The owners have
been hesitant to provide free wireless access to their customers, but with increased competi-
tion from other restaurants in the area they believe that they should now seriously consider
installing a WLAN. Gabe’s Grills are constructed with thick concrete, glass, and other mate-
rials that can impact a WLAN signal, and they are typically located in areas in which other
wireless RF signals can be picked up from nearby businesses. Although each Gabe’s Grill
location will need a separate site survey, the owners are resistant to hiring NITC to perform
them. Instead, they want only one survey, conducted at a single location, which can then be
used for all the other locations.

One of the most shocking attacks using a wireless network still has authorities
shaking their heads in disbelief. Was this an attack on a corporate wireless network
that stole sensitive company secrets? No. Was it a breach that allowed attackers to
steal credit card information from customers and then charge purchases to their
accounts? No. Instead, it was one neighbor attacking another neighbor using wireless
technology.
In 2009 a couple moved into a new house in Minnesota. The next day their four-
year-old son wandered into the yard of their neighbor Barry. When Barry returned
the child to his house he gave the boy a kiss on the lips. This shocked and frightened
the couple, so they filed a police report. The police interviewed Barry but no charges
were pressed. Yet Barry was irate with his new neighbors and decided to take
revenge on them.
Barry downloaded wireless attack software and purchased books on cracking
wireless networks. He soon was able to crack the couple’s wireless Wired Equivalent
Privacy (WEP) security (WEP is notoriously weak and can easily be broken). Barry
then acted like a "depraved criminal," according to the prosecutors, and started a
"calculated campaign to terrorize his neighbors, doing whatever he could to destroy
the careers and professional reputations of [the couple], to damage [their] marriage,
and to generally wreak havoc on their lives.”
Barry broke into the couple’s wireless LAN from his home. He then created a ficti-
tious MySpace page with the husband’s name on it and posted pictures of explicit
child pornography. He also posted a brash note that pretended to be from the
husband stating he was a lawyer and could get away with "doing anything." Barry
e-mailed the same pornography to the husband’s coworkers and sent flirtatious
e-mail to women in the husband’s office. He even sent threatening e-mails to the
Vice President of the United States from the husband’s Yahoo account. The e-mails
claimed that he was a terrorist and would kill the VP (this prompted a visit from
the Secret Service). There were many other similar attacks on the couple and their
relatives.
The law office where the husband worked hired a forensics investigator who, with
permission, installed a protocol analyzer to "sniff" the wireless home traffic. In the
data surrounding the threatening VP e-mail was Barry’s name and account informa-
tion. The FBI searched Barry’s house, found the evidence (along with other evidence
that he had done the same to a previous neighbor), and arrested Barry. He was
offered a two-year sentence but turned it down. So, the prosecutors piled on
more charges. He finally pled guilty. Barry, who had children himself, was ultimately
sentenced to 18 years in prison and even had to forfeit his house.

The list of advantages for a wireless LAN (WLAN) is impressive. WLANs provide true mobil-
ity for users and do not force them to be restricted to one location in order to access network
resources. This greater flexibility can result in substantial productivity increases for employees.
Another advantage of wireless technology is the relative ease of installation. No longer are
cable drops required for each computer on the network; instead, a single connection to an
access point (AP) is all that it is needed to provide network connectivity to multiple devices.
This both decreases installation costs and allows for wireless networks to be installed in loca-
tions where previously it would have been difficult or impossible to install wiring, such as in
older buildings or large warehouses.
Yet despite these advantages, a single element has proven to be a major stumbling block
to wireless technology: wireless security. Security has long been the Achilles heel of wireless
networking. Compared to wired networks, wireless LANs have several characteristics that
make them more vulnerable. In addition, wireless security in the original IEEE 802.11 stan-
dard was not properly implemented, thus further exposing wireless networks to a variety of
attacks. However, much of that is now changing. According to many experts, by properly
implementing new wireless security technologies, WLANs can be made as secure as their
wired counterparts.
In this chapter you will look at wireless security and vulnerabilities. You will start by briefly
reviewing security in general. Then you will explore the possible types of attacks against a
WLAN. Finally, you will examine the basic IEEE 802.11 security protections and study the
vulnerabilities in that protection mechanism.
The techniques for implementing WLAN security is covered in
Chapter 10.
Principles of Information Security
When historians reflect back on the early part of this twenty-first century, it is likely that one
word will figure prominently: security. Perhaps at no other time in the world’s history have
we been forced to protect ourselves and our property from continual attacks by covert or
invisible foes as we do today. Suicide car bombings, subway massacres, airplane hijackings,
After the sentencing Barry filed an appeal stating that he was innocent. He said
that his attorney coerced him into pleading guilty and that he was sharing a jail cell
with a double-murderer who was terrorizing him, which caused him to lose sleep and
not be aware of the charges against him. He also claimed that the couple he terror-
ized had actually framed him by infecting his computer with fictitious evidence by
breaking into his computer through his wireless network. The judge rejected the
appeal.

random shootings, and guerrilla commando raids have become all-too-familiar events around
the world. To counteract this violence, governments and other organizations have implemen-
ted new types of security defenses. Passengers using public transportation are routinely
searched. Fences are erected along borders. Telephone calls are monitored. As a result, these
attacks and the security defenses designed to prevent them impact almost every element of
our daily lives and significantly affect how all of us work, play, and live.
One area that has been an especially frequent target of attacks is information technology (IT).
Seemingly endless arrays of attacks are directed at corporations, banks, schools, and indivi-
duals through their computers, laptops, tablet computers, smartphones, and other devices.
Internet Web servers must resist thousands of attacks daily. Identity theft has skyrocketed.
An unprotected computer connected to the Internet can be infected in less than one minute.
One study found that over 48 percent of 22.7 million computers analyzed were infected
with malware.i Phishing, rootkits, back doors, social engineering, zombies, and botnets—
virtually unheard of just a few years ago—are now part of our everyday information security
vocabulary.
The need to defend against these attacks on technology devices has created a new ele-
ment of IT known as information security. Information security is now at the very core
of the entire industry that is focused on protecting the electronic information of organiza-
tions and users. Understanding the basic principles of defense is an important first step in
understanding WLAN security and its vulnerabilities. In the next section, we start by
exploring the concept of information security along with the challenges of securing
information.
What Is Information Security?
The term information security is frequently used to describe the tasks of securing information
that is in a digital format. This digital information is typically manipulated by a microproces-
sor (such as on a personal computer), stored on a magnetic, optical, or solid-state storage
device (like a hard drive, DVD, or flash drive), and transmitted over a network (such as a
WLAN or the Internet).
Security may be viewed as sacrificing convenience for safety.
Although it may be inconvenient to lock all the doors of the house
or use long and complex passwords, the tradeoff is that these steps
result in a higher level of safety. Another way to think of security is
giving up short-term ease for long-term protection. In any case, secu-
rity usually requires making sacrifices to achieve a greater good.
What exactly is information security? First, information security ensures that protective mea-
sures are properly implemented. Just as the security measures taken for a house can never
guarantee complete safety, information security cannot completely prevent attacks or guaran-
tee that a system is totally secure. Rather, information security creates a defense that attempts
to ward off attacks and prevents the collapse of the system when a successful attack occurs.
Thus, information security is protection.
Second, information security is intended to protect information that provides value to people
and organizations. There are three protections that must be extended over information. These
three protections are “CIA”: confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

1. Confidentiality. It is important that only approved individuals are able to access impor-
tant information. For example, the credit card number used to make an online purchase
must be kept secure and not made available to other parties. Confidentiality ensures
that only authorized parties can view the information. Ensuring confidentiality can
involve several different tools, ranging from software to “scramble” the credit card
number stored on the Web server to door locks to prevent access to the server.
2. Integrity. Integrity ensures that the information is correct and that no unauthorized per-
son or malicious software has altered it. For example, an attacker who could change the
amount of an online purchase from $1,000.00 to $1.00 would violate the integrity of
the information.
3. Availability. Information cannot be “locked up” so tight that no one can access it; oth-
erwise, the information would not be useful. Availability ensures that data is accessible
to authorized users. The total number of items ordered as the result of an online pur-
chase must be made available to an employee in a warehouse so that the correct items
can be shipped to the customer.
Yet information security involves more than protecting the information itself. Because this
information is stored on computer hardware, manipulated by software, and transmitted by
communication devices, each of these areas must also be protected. The third objective of
information security is to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information
on the devices that store, manipulate, and transmit the information.
Information security is achieved through a combination of three entities. As shown in Figure 9-1
and summarized Table 9-1, information, hardware, software, and communications are
protected in three interactive layers: products, people, and procedures. For example, proce-
dures enable people to understand how to use products to protect information. Thus, a
more comprehensive definition of information security is that which protects the integrity,
confidentiality, and availability of information on the devices that store, manipulate, and
transmit the information through products, people, and procedures.
Challenges of Information Security
The challenge of keeping computers secure has never been greater, not only because of the
number of attacks but also because of the difficulties faced in defending against these attacks.
These difficulties include the following:
●
Universally connected devices. It is virtually unheard of today for a computer to not be
connected to the Internet. Although this greatly expands the functionality of that
device, it also makes it easy for an attacker halfway around the world to silently
launch an attack on any connected device.
●
Increased speed of attacks. With modern tools at their disposal, attackers can quickly
scan thousands of systems to find weaknesses and launch attacks with unprecedented
speed. Many tools can even initiate new attacks without any human participation, thus
increasing the speed at which systems are attacked.
●
Greater sophistication of attacks. Attacks are becoming more complex, making it more
difficult to detect and defend against them. Attackers today use common Internet tools
and protocols to send malicious data or commands to strike computers, making it difficult
to distinguish an attack from legitimate traffic. Other attack tools vary their behavior so
the same attack appears differently each time, further complicating detection.

an extensive technical knowledge of networks and computers as well as the ability
to write a program to generate the attack. Today’s attack tools do not require any
sophisticated knowledge. In fact, many tools have a graphical user interface (GUI)

that allows the user to select options easily from a menu, as seen in Figure 9-2.
These tools are freely available or can be purchased from other attackers at a
low cost.
●
Faster detection of vulnerabilities. Weakness in software can be more quickly uncov-
ered and exploited with new software tools and techniques.
●
Delays in patching. Hardware and software vendors are overwhelmed trying to keep
pace with updating their products against attacks. One antivirus software vendor
receives over 200,000 submissions of potential malware each month.ii At this rate, the
antivirus vendors would have to update and distribute their updates every 10 minutes
to keep users protected. The delay in vendors patching their own products adds to the
difficulties in defending against attacks.
●
Distributed attacks. Attackers can use tens of thousands of computers under their con-
trol in an attack against a single server or network. This “many against one” approach
makes it virtually impossible to stop an attack by identifying and blocking a single
source.
●
User confusion. Increasingly, users are called upon to make difficult security decisions
regarding their computer systems, sometimes with little or no information to guide
them. It is not uncommon for a user to be asked security questions such as Do you
want to implement WPA2 or WEP? or Do you want to install this add-on? With little
or no direction, users are inclined to provide answers to questions without under-
standing the security risks.

Table 9-2 summarizes the reasons why it is difficult to defend against today’s attacks.
Wireless Attacks
The variety of attacks that can be launched against wireless networks can be divided into
three categories: attacks against enterprise organizations, attacks against mobile users, and
attacks against home users.
Enterprise Attacks
Several different wireless attacks are targeted at business enterprises. One reason for the
number of different attacks is the variety of attack vectors, or paths, that can be exploited.
Attack Vectors In a traditional wired network a well-defined boundary or “hard edge”
protects data and resources. There are two types of these hard edges. The first is a network
hard edge. A wired network typically has one point (or a limited number of points) through
which data must pass from an external network to the secure internal network. This single
data entry point it makes it easier to defend against attacks because any attack must likewise
pass through this one point. A device like a firewall can be used to block attacks from enter-
ing the network. The combination of a single entry point plus security devices that can
defend it make up a network’s hard edge, which protects important data and resources.
This is illustrated in Figure 9-3.
The second hard edge is made up of the walls of the building that houses the enterprise. Because
these walls keep out unauthorized personnel, attackers cannot physically access computing

devices or network equipment to steal data or infect computers. In other words, the walls serve to
physically separate computing resources from attackers. This forces attackers to resort to launch-
ing attacks through the network’s single data entry point, which is defended by a firewall.
However, the introduction of wireless LANs in enterprises has changed hard edges to
“blurred edges.” Instead of a network hard edge with a single data entry point, a WLAN
can contain multiple entry points. As shown in Figure 9-4, the radio frequency (RF) signals
from APs create several data entry points into the network from which attackers can inject
attacks or steal data. This makes it virtually impossible to create a hard network edge. In
addition, because RF signals extend beyond the boundaries of the building the walls cannot
be considered as a physical hard edge to keep away attackers. An attacker sitting in a car
well outside of the building’s security perimeter can still easily pick up a wireless RF signal.
A wireless device in an enterprise may create multiple enterprise attack vectors. These include:
●
Open or misconfigured AP. An AP whose security settings have not been set (an open
AP) or one whose security settings have been improperly configured can allow attack-
ers access to the network.
●
Rogue AP. Due to the low cost and easy availability of wireless routers, an employee
may bring a device from home and connect it to the enterprise network by simply plug-
ging it into an open network connection in an office or break room. This unauthorized
AP, called a rogue AP, allows attackers to access its RF signal to enter the corporate
network. To complicate matters, rogue APs do not have to be separate network devices.
For example, the wireless Hosted Network function in Microsoft Windows 7 makes it
possible to virtualize the physical wireless network interface card (NIC) into multiple
virtual wireless NICs (Virtual WiFi) that can be accessed by a software-based wireless

AP (SoftAP). This means that any laptop computer can quickly be turned into a rogue
AP. In addition, smartphone apps allow even a cell phone to function as a rogue AP.
The Chapter 2 Hands-On Projects 2-3 and 2-4 illustrate how to set up
and use a SoftAP in Windows.
●
Evil twin. Whereas a rogue AP is set up by an internal user, an evil twin is an AP that
is set up by an attacker. This AP is designed to mimic an authorized AP, so a user’s
mobile device like a laptop or tablet will unknowingly connect to this evil twin instead.
Attackers can then capture the transmissions from users to the evil twin AP.
Figure 9-5 illustrates some of the challenges of protecting an enterprise network that uses
WLAN technology.
Wireless Enterprise Attacks A variety of attacks can be launched against wireless
enterprise networks. These include reading data, hijacking wireless connections, inserting
traffic, and performing denial-of-service attacks.
Reading Data One of the most common attacks is very basic: reading data that is being
transmitted wirelessly. An attacker can pick up the RF signal from an open or misconfigured
AP and read any confidential wireless transmissions. To make matters worse, if the attacker
manages to connect to the enterprise wired network through a rogue AP, she could also read
broadcast and multicast wired network traffic that leaks from the wired network to the wireless
network. The type of wired network traffic that could be read through the wireless network

includes Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP), Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
(IGRP), Open Shortest Path First (OSPF), Spanning Tree Protocol (STP), Cisco’s Hot Standby
Router Protocol (HSRP),Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP), and NetBios traffic.
Although a discussion of these protocols and traffic types are beyond
the scope of this textbook, using a WLAN to read this data
could yield significant information to an attacker regarding the
wired enterprise network.
Hijacking Wireless Connections Another potential attack is hijacking the wireless
connection. Using an evil twin, an attacker can trick a corporate mobile device to connect the
imposter device instead. The attacker could then perform a wireless man-in-the-middle attack.
This type of attack makes it appear that the wireless device and the network computers are com-
municating with each other, when actually they are sending and receiving data through an evil
twin AP (the “man-in-the-middle”). As the man-in-the-middle receives data from the devices it
passes it on to the recipient so that neither computer is aware of the man-in-the-middle’s existence.
Man-in-the-middle attacks can be active or passive. In a passive attack, the attacker captures
the data that is being transmitted (such as usernames and passwords), records it, and then
sends it on to the original recipient without their presence being detected. In an active attack,
the contents are intercepted and altered before they are forwarded to the recipient.
Inserting Network Traffic Just as an active man-in-the-middle attack will modify or
inject content into a message, another type of wireless attack can actually inject wireless
packets into the enterprise network. For example, an attacker’s application could examine
incoming wireless packets, and, if the packet data matches a pattern specified in a configura-
tion file, inject custom content onto the network to redirect traffic to an attacker’s server. In
yet another type of attack, a routing protocol attack, the attacker injects specific packets into
the network to redirect a traffic stream through another router that controlled by the attacker.
Denial of Service (DoS) A denial of service (DoS) attack attempts to prevent a device
from performing its normal functions. A wireless DoS attack prevents the transmission of
data to or from network devices. In one type of DoS attack, an attacker can flood the RF
spectrum with extraneous RF signal “noise” that prevents communications from occurring
(called RF jamming).
Another wireless DoS attack takes advantage of an IEEE 802.11 design weakness. This
weakness is the implicit trust of frames that are transmitted across the wireless network,
which includes information such as the sender’s source address. Because IEEE 802.11
requires no verification of the source device’s identity (and so all management frames are
sent in an unencrypted format), an attacker can easily craft a fictitious frame that pretends
to come from a trusted client when in reality it is from a malicious attacker. Different types
of frames can be “spoofed” by an attacker to prevent a client from being able to remain con-
nected to the WLAN. A client must be both authenticated and associated with an AP before
being accepted into the wireless network, and when the client leaves the network this is
accomplished through the exchange of deauthentication and disassociation management
frames. An attacker can create false deauthentication or disassociation frames that are sent
to an AP that appear to come from another client device, causing the client to disconnect

from the AP. Although the client device can send another authentication request to an AP, an
attacker can continue to send spoofed frames to sever any reconnections.
The amendment IEEE 802.11w was designed to protect against wire-
less DoS attacks. However, it only protects specific management
frames instead of all management frames, it requires updates to both
the AP and the wireless clients, and it may interfere with other secu-
rity devices. For these reasons it has not been widely implemented.
Manipulating duration field values is another wireless DoS attack. The 802.11 standard pro-
vides optional virtual carrier sensing through the Request to Send/Clear to Send (RTS/CTS)
protocol. A Request to Send (RTS) frame is transmitted by a mobile device to an AP that
contains a duration field indicating the length of time needed for both the transmission and
the returning acknowledgement frame. The AP, as well as all stations that receive the RTS
frame, are alerted that the medium will be reserved for a specific period of time. Each receiv-
ing station stores that information in its net allocation vector (NAV) field and no station can
transmit if the NAV contains a value other than zero. An attacker can send a frame with the
duration field set to an arbitrarily high value (the maximum is 32,767), thus preventing other
devices from transmitting for lengthy periods of time.
Deauthentication and disassociation frames and virtual carrier sens-
ing are covered in Chapter 6.
Mobile User Attacks
Mobile wireless users face several risks from attackers. Table 9-3 lists these risks, along with
the concerns that a user faces when using a WLAN in an unsecure environment. Note that
the attacker’s tools for these types of attacks are very rudimentary.

Home Attacks
Attacks against home WLANs are easy due to the fact that most home users fail to configure
any security on their home networks. Many home users consider it to be an inconvenience to
properly set the security on their wireless router. Such home users face several risks from
attacks on their insecure wireless networks. Among other things, attackers can:
●
Steal data. On a computer in the home WLAN, an attacker could access any folder
with file sharing enabled. This essentially provides an attacker full access to steal sen-
sitive data from the computer.
●
Read wireless transmissions. Usernames, passwords, credit card numbers, and other
information sent over the WLAN could be captured by an attacker.
●
Inject malware. Because attackers could access the network behind a firewall, they
could inject viruses and other malware onto the computer.
●
Download harmful content. In several instances, attackers have accessed a home com-
puter through an unprotected WLAN and downloaded child pornography to the com-
puter, and then turned that computer into a file server to distribute the content. When
authorities have traced the files back to that computer the unsuspecting owner has
been arrested and his equipment confiscated.
Attackers can easily identify unprotected home wireless networks through war driving. War
driving is searching for wireless signals from an automobile or on foot using a portable com-
puting device.
War driving is derived from the term war dialing. When telephone
modems were popular in the 1980s and 1990s, an attacker could
program the device to randomly dial telephone numbers until a
computer answered the call. This random process of searching for a
connection was known as war dialing, so the word for randomly
searching for a wireless signal became known as war driving.
In order to properly conduct war driving, several tools are necessary. These tools are listed in
Table 9-4.
Tool
Purpose
Mobile computing device
A mobile computing device with a wireless NIC can be used for war driving. This
includes a standard portable computer, a pad computer, or a smartphone.
Wireless NIC adapter
Many war drivers prefer an external wireless NIC adapter that connects into a USB
or other port and has an external antenna jack.
Antenna(s)
Although all wireless NIC adapters have embedded antennas, attaching an external
antenna will significantly increase the ability to detect a wireless signal.
Software
Client utilities and integrated operating system tools provide limited information
about a discovered WLAN. Serious war drivers use more specialized software.
Global positioning system
(GPS) receiver
Although this is not required, it does help to pinpoint the location more precisely if
this information will be recorded or shared with others.

After the wireless signal has been detected, the next step is to docu-
ment and then advertise the location of the wireless LANs for others
to use. Early WLAN users copied a system that hobos used during
the Great Depression to indicate friendly locations. Wireless networks
were identified by drawing on sidewalks or walls around the area of
the network known as war chalking. Today the location of WLANs discovered through war
driving are posted on Web sites.
Legacy IEEE 802.11 Security Protections
C W N A
5.1.1. Identify and describe the strengths, weaknesses, appropriate
uses, and implementation of the IEEE 802.11 security-related items.
The IEEE implemented several protections in the original 1997 802.11 standard. These pro-
tections can be divided into three categories: access control, wired equivalent privacy, and
authentication.
Access Control
Access control is granting or denying approval to use specific resources; other words, it is the
process of controlling access. Although access control is frequently viewed as physical, such
as door locks and fencing, in an information system it is the mechanism used to allow or
restrict access to data or devices. Wireless access control is intended to limit a user’s admis-
sion to the AP: only those who are authorized are able to connect to the AP and thus become
part of the wireless LAN.
The most common type of access control is Media Access Control (MAC) address filtering.
The MAC address is a hardware address that uniquely identifies each node of a network. The
MAC address is a unique 48-bit number that is “burned” into the NIC adapter when it is

(OUI), sometimes called a “company ID,” which references the company that produced the
adapter, and a 24-bit individual address block (IAB), which uniquely identifies the card itself.
A typical MAC address is illustrated in Figure 9-6.
Other names for the MAC address are vendor address, vendor ID, NIC
address, Ethernet address, hardware address, and physical address.

The IEEE 802.11 standard does not specify how access control is to be implemented. How-
ever, since a wireless device can be identified by its MAC address, virtually all wireless AP
vendors implement MAC address filtering as the means of access control. A wireless client
device’s MAC address is entered into software running on the AP, which then is used to per-
mit or deny a device from connecting to the network. As shown in Figure 9-7, restrictions
can be implemented in one of two ways: a specific device can be permitted access into the
network or the device can be blocked.
Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
Wired equivalent privacy (WEP) is intended to guard another of the three CIA characteristics
of information, namely confidentiality. This ensures that only authorized parties can view the
information. WEP protects confidentiality by “scrambling” the wireless data as it is transmit-
ted so that it cannot be viewed. The process of scrambling and how WEP is implemented are
discussed in detail next.
Cryptography An important means of protecting information is to change or scramble
it so that even if attackers reach the data, they cannot read it. This scrambling is a process
known as cryptography (from Greek words meaning hidden writing). Cryptography is the
science of transforming information into a secure form while it is being transmitted or
stored so that unauthorized persons cannot access it.
Cryptography’s origins date back centuries. One of the most famous ancient cryptographers
was Julius Caesar. In messages to his commanders, Caesar shifted each letter of his messages
three places down in the alphabet, so that an A was replaced by a D, a B was replaced by
an E, and so forth. Changing the original text into a secret message using cryptography is
known as encryption. When Caesar’s commanders received his messages, they reversed the
process (such as substituting a D for an A) to change the secret message back to its original
form. This is called decryption. Data in an unencrypted form is called cleartext data. Clear-
text data is data that is either stored or transmitted “in the clear,” without any encryption.
Cleartext data that is to be encrypted is called plaintext. Plaintext data is input into an
encryption algorithm, which consists of procedures based on a mathematical formula used
to encrypt the data. A key is a mathematical value entered into the algorithm to produce
ciphertext, or text that is “scrambled.” Just as a key is inserted into a lock to secure a door,
in cryptography a unique mathematical key is input into the encryption algorithm to create

the ciphertext. Once the ciphertext is transmitted or needs to be returned to cleartext, the
reverse process occurs with a decryption algorithm. The cryptography process is illustrated
in Figure 9-8.
Cleartext data becomes plaintext when it is entered into an algo-
rithm in the encryption process. Plaintext should not be confused
with “plain text,” which is text that has no formatting (such as bold-
ing or underlining) applied.
A substitution algorithm like Caesar’s is too simple for contemporary use because the key
creates a repeating pattern. When a detectable pattern or structure can be detected it pro-
vides an attacker with valuable information to break the encryption. Keys that create this
type of repeating pattern are known as weak keys.
WEP Implementation Implementation of WEP can be understood by considering the
IEEE 802.11 cryptography objectives as outlined in the standard. These objectives include
the following:
●
Efficient. The WEP algorithm must be proficient enough to be implemented in either
hardware or software.
●
Exportable. WEP must meet the guidelines set by the U.S. Department of Commerce
so that the wireless device using WEP can be exported overseas.
●
Optional. The implementation of WEP in wireless LANs is an optional feature.

●
Reasonably strong. The security of the algorithm lies in the difficulty of determining the
secret keys through attacks. This in turn is related to the length of the secret key and the
frequency of changing keys. WEP was to be “reasonably” strong in resisting attacks.
●
Self-synchronizing. When using WEP each packet must be separately encrypted. This is
to prevent a single lost packet from making subsequent packets indecipherable.
WEP relies on a shared secret key that is entered into both the wireless client device and the
AP in advance. (In other words, they “share” the same key value.) WEP keys must be a min-
imum of 64 bits in length. Most vendors add an option to use a larger 128-bit WEP key for
added security, because a longer key is more difficult to break.
The IEEE standard also provides for the AP and client devices to hold
up to four separate WEP keys simultaneously. However, due to the
difficulty of managing multiple keys for each device, this feature is
rarely used.
The mechanics of how WEP performs encryption is illustrated in Figure 9-9. The steps are
as follows:
1. The plaintext to be transmitted has a cyclic redundancy check (CRC) value calculated,
which is a checksum based on the contents of the text. WEP calls this the integrity
check value (ICV) and appends it to the end of the text.
2. The shared secret key is combined with an initialization vector (IV). The IV is a 24-bit value
used in WEP that changes each time a packet is encrypted. The IV and the default key are
combined and used as a “seed” for generating a random number in Step 3. If only the default
key were used as a seed, then the number generated would be the same each time. Varying
the IV for each packet ensures that the random number created from it is indeed random.
3. The default key and IV are then entered as the seed values into a pseudo-random num-
ber generator (PRNG) that creates a random number. The PRNG is based on the RC4
cipher algorithm. RC4 accepts keys up to 128 bits in length and takes one character
and replaces it with one character. This output is known as the keystream. The key-
stream is essentially a series of 1s and 0s equal in length to the text plus the ICV.
4. The two values (text plus ICV and the keystream) are then combined through the exclu-
sive OR (XOR) operation to create the encrypted text. The Boolean operation of XOR
yields the result TRUE (1) when only one of its operands is TRUE (1); otherwise, the result

is FALSE (0). The four XOR results are 0 XOR 0 ¼ 0, 0 XOR 1 ¼ 1, 1 XOR 0 ¼ 1, and
1 XOR 1 ¼ 0.
5. The IV is added to the front of the ciphertext (“pre-pended”) and the packet is ready for
transmission. The pre-pended IV is not encrypted. The reason why the IV is transmitted
in an unencrypted format is because the receiving device needs it in this form in order to
decrypt the transmission.
When the encrypted frame arrives at its destination the receiving device first separates the IV
from the ciphertext and then combines the IV with its appropriate secret key to create a key-
stream. This is then used to extract the text and ICV. The text is finally run through the
CRC to ensure that the ICV’s match and that nothing was lost in the transmission process.
Authentication
Because wireless LANs cannot limit access to the RF signal by walls or doors, wireless
authentication requires the wireless device (and not the individual user) to be authenticated
prior to being connected to the network. IEEE 802.11 authentication is a process in which
the AP accepts a station.
Wireless authentication is covered in Chapter 6.
Two types of authentication are supported by the 802.11 standard. Open system authentication
is the basic (and the default) method. After discovering the network through passive scanning or
active scanning and then receiving the necessary information, the wireless client device sends an
association request frame to the AP that carries information about the data rates that the device
can support along with the service set identifier (SSID) of the network it wants to join. After
receiving the association request, the AP considers the request by comparing the SSID received
with the SSID of the network. If the two match, the wireless device is authenticated.
The second type of authentication method (which is optional) is shared key authentication.
Shared key authentication uses WEP keys. The AP sends to a device wanting to join the net-
work a block of text known as the challenge text. The wireless device encrypts with its WEP
key and returns it to the AP, which then decrypts what was returned to see if it matches the
original challenge text. If it does, the device is accepted into the network.
When WEP is used for shared key authentication, it is serving a dual
function of encryption and authentication.

Although the IEEE 802.11 standard does provide security mechanisms for wireless networks,
these mechanisms have fallen far short of their goal. Significant security vulnerabilities have
exposed wireless networking to a variety of attacks. These vulnerabilities are especially
troubling because users who implement the security features may assume they are protected
when in reality they are not. This section explores the vulnerabilities of authentication, address
filtering, and WEP.
Authentication
Open system authentication is weak because authentication is based on only one factor: a
match of SSIDs. An attacker only has to determine a valid SSID in order to be authenticated.
There are several ways that SSIDs can be discovered, such as looking at the SSID on a device
that is already authenticated. However, the easiest way to discover the SSID is to actually do
nothing: because the SSID is beaconed from the AP in passive scanning, there is nothing that
the attacker has to do other than roam into the area of the AP, accept the SSID in the beacon
frame, and become authenticated.
For a degree of protection, some users configure their APs to prevent the beacon frame
from including the SSID, known as SSID hiding. SSID hiding requires the user to enter
the SSID manually on the wireless device. Although this may seem to provide protection
by not advertising the SSID, it only provides a weak degree of security and has several
limitations:
●
The SSID can be easily discovered even when it is not contained in beacon frames
because it is transmitted in other management frames sent by the AP. Attackers
with protocol analyzers can still detect the SSID even when SSID hiding is being
used.
●
The SSID is initially transmitted in plaintext (unencrypted) form when the device is
negotiating with the AP. If an attacker cannot capture an initial negotiation process, it
can force one to occur. An attacker can send a forged disassociation frame to a wire-
less device. This will cause the device to disassociate from the AP. When the device
immediately attempts to reconnect to the AP, the attacker can capturing frames and
see the SSID transmitted in plaintext.
●
SSID hiding may prevent users from being able to freely roam one AP coverage area to
another.
●
Turning off SSID beaconing is not always possible or convenient. SSID beaconing is
the default mode in every AP. Even more so, not all APs allow beaconing to be turned
off, and those that do often discourage users from making this change.
●
Versions of Microsoft Windows XP, when receiving signals from both a wireless net-
work that is broadcasting an SSID and one that is not broadcasting the SSID, will
always connect to the AP that is broadcasting its SSID. If a Windows XP device is
connected to an AP that is not broadcasting its SSID, and another AP is turned on that
is broadcasting its SSID, the device will automatically disconnect from the first AP and
connect to the AP that is broadcasting.
●
The SSID can be retrieved from an authenticated device.
●
Because many users do not change the default SSID, an attacker can simply try using
default SSIDs until the correct value is accepted.

In order to prevent attackers from guessing default SSIDs one brand
of AP can produce random SSIDs that are made up of two unrelated
words, such as quickdolphin.
The shared key authentication technique, using challenge text, is likewise vulnerable. The first
vulnerability is based on the fact that key management can be very difficult when a large
number of wireless devices must be supported. Because the WEP key must be entered on
each wireless device, an attacker can view the key on an approved device (by stealing a
device or “shoulder surfing”—looking over someone’s shoulder) and install it on his own
wireless device.
Another weakness of shared key authentication is that the AP sends the challenge text to a
device as cleartext. An attacker can capture the challenge text along with the device’s
response (encrypted text and IV). The attacker than has everything necessary to mathemati-
cally derive the keystream.
Address Filtering
MAC address filtering likewise has several vulnerabilities. First, much like managing WEP
keys, managing the number of MAC addresses in a medium to large sized wireless network
can pose significant challenges. As new users are added to the network and old users leave,
MAC address filtering demands constant attention. The sheer number of users makes it diffi-
cult to manage all of the MAC addresses and thus creates avenues for attackers. In addition,
there is no provision for temporarily adding a guest user to the network
A second disadvantage to MAC address filtering is that, like SSIDs, MAC addresses are ini-
tially exchanged in cleartext. This means that an attacker can easily see the MAC address of
an approved device and use it to join the network. Also, as with open system authentication,
an attacker can send a disassociation frame to force a device to reassociate and send the
MAC address so that it can be captured.
A third disadvantage of MAC address filtering is that a MAC address can be “spoofed” or
substituted in two ways. First, some wireless NICs allow for a substitute MAC address to be
used. Second, there are programs available that allow users to spoof a MAC address. This is
possible because Microsoft Windows reads the MAC address of the wireless NIC and stores
that value in the Windows registry database. A MAC address spoof program changes the set-
ting in the registry but does not change the address on the wireless NIC itself.
WEP
Although authentication and MAC address filtering have serious security vulnerabilities, the
vulnerability that attracts the most attention focuses on how WEP is implemented.
WEP has several security vulnerabilities. First, to encrypt packets, WEP can use only a 64-bit or
128-bit number, which is made up of a 24-bit IV and either a 40-bit or 104-bit default key. Even
if a longer 128-bit number is used, the length of the IV still remains at 24 bits. The relatively
short length of the IV limits its strength (shorter keys are easier to break than longer keys).
Second, WEP implementation violates a cardinal rule of cryptography: anything that creates a
detectable pattern must be avoided at all costs. This is because patterns provide an attacker

with valuable information to break the encryption. The implementation of WEP creates a
detectable pattern for attackers. Because IVs are 24-bit numbers, there are only 16,777,216 pos-
sible values. An AP transmitting at only 11 Mbps can send and receive 700 packets each second.
If a different IV were used for each packet, then the IVs would start repeating in fewer than
seven hours (a “busy” AP can produce duplicates in fewer than five hours). An attacker who
captures packets for this length of time can see the duplication and use it to crack the code.
Recent techniques have reduced the amount of time to crack WEP
down to minutes.
Because of the weaknesses of WEP, it is possible for an attacker to identify two packets
derived from the same IV (called a collision). With that information, the attacker can begin
what is called a keystream attack or IV attack. A keystream attack is a method of determin-
ing the keystream by analyzing two packets that were created from the same IV.
The basis for a keystream attack is as follows: performing an XOR on two ciphertexts will
equal an XOR on the two plaintexts. This is shown in Figure 9-10. In Operation 1, Plaintext
A and Keystream X are XOR’ed together to create Ciphertext A. In Operation 2, Plaintext B
and Keystream X are also XOR’ed to create Ciphertext B. Notice that in Operation 3, if
Ciphertext A and Ciphertext B are XOR’ed, they create the same result as when Plaintext A
and Plaintext B are XOR’ed in Operation 4.
Figure 9-11 illustrates how an attacker can take advantage of this. If the attack captures
Packet 1’s IV and keystream, and then captures the IV and keystream from Packet 222 that
uses the same IV, then the attacker knows two keystreams that were created by the same IV.
An XOR of those two keystreams finds the same value as an XOR of the plaintext of Packet 1
and Packet 222. The attacker can now work backwards; if even part of the plaintext of

Packet 1 can be discovered, then the attacker can derive the plaintext of Packet 222 by
doing an XOR operation on the keystream of Ciphertext 1 and Ciphertext 222 (11111110)
and plaintext of Packet 1 (11010011). In fact, once the plaintext of Packet 1 has been dis-
covered, the plaintext of any packet that uses that IV can be found.
How can the attacker find enough of Plaintext 1 to decrypt Plaintext 222? There are several
ways:
●
Some of the values of the frames are definitely known, such as certain fields in the
header. In other fields the value may not be known but the purpose is known (for
example, the IP address fields have a limited set of possible values in most networks).
●
The body portion of the text often encodes ASCII text, again giving some possible
clues. An attacker can collect enough samples of duplicated IVs, guess at substantial
portions of the keystream, and then decode more and more.
●
An attacker can capture an encrypted packet and, based on its size (28 bytes), the
attacker knows that it is an Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) request. The attacker
can then flood the network with the reinjected ARP request, which results in a flood of
ARP responses, supplying a wealth of data to use.
●
A computer on the Internet can send traffic from the outside to a device on the wire-
less network. Because the content of the message is known to the attacker, when the
WEP-encrypted version of the message is sent over wireless LAN, the attacker will
have all the necessary data to decrypt all packets that use the same IV.
Chapter Summary
■Information security is a term that describes the tasks of securing information that is in a
digital format, whether it is manipulated by a microprocessor, stored on a magnetic,
optical, or solid-state storage device, or transmitted over a network. Information security
creates a defense that attempts to ward off attacks and prevents the collapse of the
system when a successful attack occurs. It is intended to provide three protections over
information: confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA). And because this informa-
tion is stored on computer hardware, manipulated by software, and transmitted by
communication devices, each of these areas must also be protected. Information security
protects the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information on the devices that
store, manipulate, and transmit the information through products, people, and procedures.

■There are several challenges to information security. These include universally con-
nected devices, an increased speed of attacks and greater sophistication of attacks,
readily available attack tools, faster detection of vulnerabilities by attackers, delays
in patching, more distributed attacks, and general user confusion over how to be
secure.
■Several different wireless attacks are targeted at business enterprises. This is because
there are several attack vectors that attackers can target. The incorporation of a
WLAN into an enterprise network means the enterprise network is no longer protected
by a single entry point through which all data must pass, nor is it protected by the
walls of the building. Instead, the nature of the RF signal opens multiple attack points.
These points include open or misconfigured APs, rogue APs, and evil twins. The dif-
ferent types of attacks that can be launched against wireless enterprise networks
include reading data, hijacking wireless connections, inserting traffic, and performing
denial-of-service attacks.
■Both mobile users and home users face attacks as well. Many home users consider
it to be an inconvenience to properly set the security on their wireless router.
Such home users face several risks from attackers. Attackers can easily identify
unprotected home wireless networks through war driving. War driving is searching
for wireless signals from an automobile or on foot using a portable computing
device.
■The IEEE implemented several protections in the original 1997 802.11 standard.
Wireless access control is intended to limit a user’s admission to the AP: only those
who are authorized are able to connect to the AP and thus become part of the wireless
LAN. The most common type of access control is Media Access Control (MAC)
address filtering. Virtually all wireless AP vendors implement MAC address filtering as
the means of access control. A wireless client device’s MAC address is entered into
software running on the AP, which then is used to permit or deny a device from con-
necting to the network. Wired equivalent privacy (WEP) is intended to guard the
confidentiality of the data being transmitted by encrypting it. WEP relies on a shared
secret key that is entered into both the wireless client device and the AP in advance.
WEP keys must be a minimum of 64 bits in length. Most vendors add an option to
use a larger 128-bit WEP key for added security.
■Because wireless LANs cannot limit access to the RF signal by walls or doors, wireless
authentication requires the wireless device to be authenticated prior to being connected
to the network. Open system authentication only requires that the client device send to
the AP the SSID of the network for which it wants to join. Shared key authentication
uses WEP keys to encrypt and decrypt challenge text.
■Despite the fact that the IEEE 802.11 standard provided security mechanisms for
wireless networks, these mechanisms have fallen far short of their goal. Open sys-
tem authentication is weak because authentication is based on only one factor: a
match of SSIDs. An attacker only has to determine a valid SSID in order to be
authenticated. There are several ways that SSIDs can be discovered. A weakness of
shared key authentication is when the AP sends to a device the challenge text it is
sent as cleartext. MAC address filtering likewise has several vulnerabilities, one of
which is that MAC addresses are initially exchanged in cleartext.

■WEP has several security vulnerabilities. First, to encrypt packets, WEP can use only
a 64-bit or 128-bit number, which is made up of a 24-bit IV and either a 40-bit or
104-bit default key. Even if a longer 128-bit number is used, the length of the IV still
remains at 24 bits. In addition, WEP creates a detectable pattern for attackers that can
be used to then break the encryption so that wireless transmissions can be read.

Project 9-4: Crack WEP Encryption
One of the best ways to see the weakness of WEP is to use a tool to crack
WEP encryption on your own WLAN. There are several tools available
online to crack WEP encryption, yet most of them require a series of com-
mands to be entered at a command prompt and may be difficult to use. A smaller number
of tools have GUI, making it much easier for the user. In this project you set up your own
WLAN using WEP and then will use Gerix Wifi Cracker, which is part of Backtrack 5, to
break your WEP encryption. You will need the USB flash drive that was created in Hands-
On Project 6-1. You will also need either an AP or a computer that is running the
Connectify software that was configured in Hands-On Project 2-4. Note that Backtrack 5
does not support all wireless LAN adapters. It may be necessary to use a USB wireless
adapter if your internal adapter cannot be recognized.
This tool should never be used to crack WEP encryption on a WLAN
that is not part of your own network.
1. Configure an AP or wireless router to use WEP. (See Hands-On Project 9-3 for an illus-
tration of how WEP is implemented on a WLAN.) Create an SSID of WEP-WLAN and
enter a WEP key. As an option, you can use the Connectify software that was installed
in Hands-On Project 2-4. Launch Connectify and, under Internet, select No Internet
Sharing. Under Sharing Mode, select Wi-Fi Ad-Hoc, Encrypted (WEP). Enter aaaaafffff
under Password as the WEP key and click Start Hotspot.
2. If possible, configure another client to use WEP in order to increase the amount of traf-
fic. Click Start and then click Control Panel.
3. Click Network and Internet.
4. Click Connect to a network.
5. Click the name of the SSID (WEP-WLAN or Connectify-me).
6. Click Connect. When asked for the Security key enter your WEP key.
7. Insert the USB flash drive that contains Backtrack 5 created in Hands-On Project 6-1
into a computer that contains a wireless NIC adapter.
8. Reboot the computer.
9. If the computer is not configured to launch from a USB flash drive, press the appro-
priate key to change the boot sequence so that the USB drive is the first drive from
which the computer launches. If that is not available, press the appropriate key
to enter the ROM BIOS and change the boot order settings so that the USB drive
is first.
10. Press Enter to select Default.

One of the most highly publicized security breaches in recent memory resulted in
over 94 million consumer credit and debit card accounts being affected with losses
for the company involved exceeding $1 billion. And the starting point of the attack
was a wireless LAN using weak security.
Sometime in mid-2005 attackers used a simple telescope-shaped antenna and a
laptop computer to capture wireless LAN transmissions at a Marshalls retail clothing
store. These transmissions were only marginally protected by the weak Wired Equiva-
lent Privacy (WEP) standard, which had been known to be defective for almost four
years prior to this time. The attackers quickly broke the WEP encryption and were
then able to eavesdrop on employees logging into a server of TJX, Marshall’s parent
company. Soon the attackers had enough information to set up their own accounts
on TJX’s data center in Massachusetts so that they could access the network online
from anywhere in the world.
The main target of the attack was TJX’s Retail Transaction Switch (RTS) servers,
which were responsible for processing and storing information related to customer
transactions at TJX stores. Attackers stole credit and debit card information and then
charged purchases at other online stores totaling hundreds of millions of dollars to
the accounts of unsuspecting victims. In one case, a single gang using stolen TJX
card data charged $8 million in transactions at Wal-Mart stores and other outlets in
Florida. Yet that was not the only consumer information stolen. Because TJX required
a driver’s license number and other personally identifiable information when custo-
mers made merchandise returns without a receipt, this data was also stored on TJX
servers and was taken by the attackers, affecting another 500,000 consumers. The
attackers even used the TJX network as a communication post, leaving each other
messages so that one attacker would not duplicate the work of another. Yet unlike
TJX, these messages the attackers left for one another were encrypted so they could
not be read by anyone else.
Of the 12 requirements mandated by the credit card companies to ensure that TJX
and other retailers protected consumer information, TJX met only three. TJX also
failed to install firewalls to protect its networks and did not update its server soft-
ware on a timely basis. According to one report on the incident, TJX’s lax security
turned the company’s network into “an open bank vault with the money exposed.”
The theft of data from TJX lasted for over 18 months. Stolen cards were used in at
least seven U.S. states and eight foreign countries, including Mexico, China, Italy,
Australia, and Japan. When the thefts were finally uncovered the results were costly
for both the attackers as well as TJX. Two of the leaders of the crime spree were con-
victed, one of whom had to pay $171.5 million in restitution and was sentenced

Despite the advantages of wireless networking, weak security has long been considered a seri-
ous problem of this technology. Not only do wireless LANs have several features that make
them more vulnerable to attacks than wired networks, but the wireless security protocols in
the original IEEE 802.11 standard were not properly implemented. However, this landscape
has now changed. If properly configured, new wireless security technologies can make WLANs
secure for even the most important transactions.
In this chapter you will look at implementing wireless security. First, you will start by examin-
ing different transitional security solutions. Next, the secure features of IEEE 802.1x/WPA2
authentication and encryption will be presented. After a discussion of wireless intrusion detec-
tion and prevention systems, other security defenses will be explored.
The vulnerabilities of WLAN security are covered in Chapter 9.
Transitional Solutions
C W N A
5.1.1. Identify and describe the strengths, weaknesses, appropriate
uses, and implementation of the IEEE 802.11 security-related items.
In September 1999 the IEEE committee ratified the 802.11b and 802.11a WLAN standards,
which included WEP technology for authentication and encryption. However, by early 2001,
to two years in prison, while another attacker was sentenced to between 17 and
25 years in prison for his role in this and other thefts of credit card information.
TJX disclosed in its earnings report that the direct cost to its organization was esti-
mated to exceed $256 million. (These costs related to the data theft lowered TJX’s
profit by $118 million, or 25 cents per share.) In addition, fraud losses to banks and
other institutions that issued the stolen cards was an additional $68 million to $83
million. The company also announced that a $9.75 million settlement had been
reached between it and 41 state attorneys general. This money went towards cover-
ing the states’ investigations into the incident, creating a “comprehensive infor-
mation security program” to correct any weaknesses in TJX’s security systems, and
paying for a new data security fund for the states to create more effective data
security. TJX was also required to meet data security requirements specified by the
states. All told, it is estimated that the security breach—which was made possible
by an insecure WLAN—ended up costing TJX $1 billion in expenses for consultants,
security upgrades, attorney fees, and special marketing.

independent studies from universities and other organizations had identified serious weaknesses
in WEP, including:
●
The RC4 pseudo-random number generator (PRNG) is not properly implemented.
●
Initialization vector (IV) keys are reused.
●
WEP does not prevent passive or active man-in-the-middle attacks.
An attacker with freely available tools and even limited technical knowledge could easily
circumvent WEP and launch attacks against WLANs.
To address these WEP vulnerabilities, several transitional solutions were quickly developed.
These solutions were only designed to be temporary until a more secure and permanent fix
could be made. The transitional solutions included WEP2, dynamic WEP, and Wi-Fi Protected
Access (WPA).
WEP2
After the security flaws in WEP were publicized, the IEEE TGi task group (known as Task
Group i), which was responsible for the implementation of the original WEP, released a new
implementation of WEP known as WEP2 (WEP Version 2). WEP2 attempted to overcome
the limitations of WEP by adding two new security enhancements.
The original implementation of WEP itself was hindered by the
limited processing capabilities of APs at that time. For example, the
weaker PRNG RC4 was chosen in part due to hardware processing
constraints.
First, the IV was increased to 128 bits from 64 bits to address the weakness of encryption.
Second, a different authentication system known as Kerberos was used. Kerberos was devel-
oped by the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and used to verify the identity
of networked users. Named after a three-headed dog in Greek mythology that guarded the
gates of Hades, Kerberos is typically used when a user attempts to access a network service
that requires authentication. The Kerberos authentication server issues the user a ticket,
much like a driver’s license is issued by a state’s Department of Motor Vehicles. Kerberos
tickets share some of the same characteristics as a driver’s license: tickets are difficult to
copy (because they are encrypted), they contain specific user information, they restrict what
a user can do, and they expire after a few hours or a day. This ticket contains information
linking it to the user. The user presents this ticket to the network for a service, where the
service then examines the ticket to verify the identity of the user. If the user is verified, they are
then authenticated. Issuing and submitting tickets in a Kerberos system is handled internally
and is transparent to the user.
Kerberos is available as a free download from the MIT Web site
and will function under Windows, Windows Server, Apple Mac OS,
and Linux.
However, it soon became apparent that WEP2 had its own security vulnerabilities. First,
collisions, or two packets derived from the same IV, were still common. Second, Kerberos is
known to be susceptible to an offline cracking password attack called a dictionary attack.

A dictionary attack begins with the attacker creating encrypted versions of common dictio-
nary words and then compares them against data captured through the wireless exchange of
encrypted Kerberos information. If a match occurs between the encrypted dictionary word
and the wireless data, the password can be revealed. A dictionary attack is illustrated in
Figure 10-1.
A dictionary attack is successful because users often create passwords
that are simple dictionary words. It was estimated that up to 10
percent of Kerberos-protected user passwords can be cracked within
24 hours using a dictionary attack mounted by an inexpensive net-
work of computers.
Because of these weaknesses WEP2 was rarely implemented.
Dynamic WEP
Another security solution, called dynamic WEP, was developed. Dynamic WEP solves the
weak IV problem by rotating the keys frequently, making it much more difficult to crack
the encrypted wireless transmissions. Dynamic WEP uses different keys for different types of
traffic. For unicast traffic (traffic destined for only one address) a unicast WEP key is used,
which is unique to each user’s session, dynamically generated, and changed frequently.
This key is also changed every time the user roams to a new access point (AP) or logs in. A
separate key is used for broadcast traffic (traffic sent to all users on the network). The broad-
cast WEP key is the same for all wireless devices connected to an AP. Keys can be set to
change frequently, such as every 30 minutes. Dynamic WEP is illustrated in Figure 10-2.
A major advantage of using dynamic WEP is its straightforward deployment: dynamic WEP
can be implemented without upgrading device drivers or AP firmware, making it a no-cost
solution with minimal effort. However, dynamic WEP was still only a partial solution.
Dynamic WEP does not protect against man-in-the-middle attacks and is susceptible to
DoS attacks. Because it only offered a partial security solution, dynamic WEP was never
widely implemented.
Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)
As the IEEE TGi worked on the 802.11i standard, the Wi-Fi Alliance grew impatient and
decided that security could no longer wait. In October 2003 it introduced Wi-Fi Protected
Access (WPA). There were two modes of WPA. WPA Personal was designed for individuals

or small office/home office (SOHO) settings, which typically has ten or fewer employees.
A more robust WPA Enterprise was intended for larger enterprises, schools, and government
agencies. WPA addresses both encryption and authentication.
WPA operates at the media access control (MAC) layer.
The heart and soul of WPA is a new encryption technology called Temporal Key Integrity
Protocol (TKIP). TKIP functions as a “wrapper” around WEP by adding an additional layer
of security but still preserving WEP’s basic functionality. TKIP’s enhancements are in three
basic areas: the required key length is increased from 64 bits to 128 bits (making it harder
to break), the IV is increased from 24 bits to 48 bits (effectively eliminating collisions), and
a unique “base key” is created for each wireless device using a master key derived in the
authentication process along with the sender’s unique MAC address (this key is used with
the IV to create unique keys for each packet).
With WEP, a small 40-bit encryption key must be manually entered on APs and devices. This
key does not change and is the basis for encryption for all transmissions. By contrast, TKIP
uses a longer 128-bit per-packet key. The per-packet functionality of TKIP means that it
dynamically generates a new key for each packet, thus preventing collisions. The result is
that TKIP dynamically generates unique keys to encrypt every data packet that is wirelessly
communicated during a session.

When using TKIP there are 280 trillion possible keys that can be gen-
erated for a given data packet.
WPA also includes a Message Integrity Check (MIC), designed to prevent an attacker from
conducting active or passive man-in-the-middle attacks by capturing, altering, and resending
data packets. The MIC replaces the Cyclic Redundancy Check (CRC) function in WEP.
While CRC is designed to detect any changes in a packet, whether accidental or intentional,
it does not adequately protect the integrity of the packet: an attacker could modify a packet
and the CRC, making it appear that the packet contents were the original because the altered
CRC is correct for that packet. MIC provides a strong mathematical function in which the
receiver and the transmitter each compute and then compare the MIC. If it does not match,
the data is assumed to have been tampered with and the packet is dropped. There is also an
optional MIC countermeasure in which all clients are deauthenticated and new associations
are prevented for one minute if a MIC error occurs.
Although a device to protect against forgeries is technically called a
message authentication code (MAC) the IEEE 802 had already used
the acronym MAC to refer to “media access control.” The TGi com-
mittee substituted message integrity code (MIC), and it is sometimes
referred to as Michael.
The mechanics of how TKIP performs encryption is illustrated in Figure 10-3 with the parts
of the previous WEP procedure that are no longer used crossed out. The wireless device starts
with having two keys, a 128-bit encryption key called the temporal key and a 64-bit MIC.
The steps are as follows:
●
Step 1. Instead of using an IV and secret key as with WEP, the temporal key is XORed
with the sender’s MAC address to create an intermediate Value 1.

●
Step 2. Value 1 is then mixed with a sequence number to produce Value 2, which is
the per-packet key. Value 2 is entered into the PRNG, just as with WEP.
●
Step 3. Instead of running the text through the CRC generator, the MIC key, the
sender’s MAC address, and the receiver’s MAC address are all run through a MIC
function. This creates text with the MIC key appended. This value is then XORed
with the keystream to create the ciphertext.
TKIP has three major components that address security vulnerabilities:
●
MIC. MIC protects against forgeries by ensuring that the message has not been
tampered with. CRC under WEP could not provide this kind of protection. The
original WEP design used a 24-bit IV along with a secret key to generate a keystream.
TKIP creates a different key for each packet.
●
IV sequence. TKIP reuses the WEP IV field as a sequence number for each packet.
Both the transmitter and receiver initialize the packet sequence space to zero whenever
new TKIP keys are set, and the transmitter increments the sequence number with each
packet it sends. This ensures that an attacker does not record a valid packet and then
retransmit it. Also, the length of the sequence number IV has been doubled, from
24 bits to 48 bits.
●
TKIP key mixing. WEP constructs a per-packet RC4 key by concatenating a key
and the packet IV. The new per-packet key construction, called the TKIP key mixing
function, substitutes a temporary (temporal) key for the WEP base key and constructs
a per-packet key that changes with each packet. Temporal keys have a limited life and
are replaced frequently.
If a wireless device was transmitting 10,000 packets per second with
original WEP IV, collisions could occur in 90 minutes; TKIP ensures
that collisions would not occur for over 900 years.
Authentication for WPA Personal is accomplished by using a preshared key (PSK). In cryp-
tography, a PSK is a value that has been previously shared using a secure communication
channel between two parties (sometimes also called a “shared secret”). In a WLAN, a PSK
is slightly different. It is a secret value that is manually entered on both the AP and each
wireless device. Because this secret key is not widely known, it may be assumed that only
approved devices have the key value. Devices that have the secret key are then automati-
cally authenticated by the AP. Although using PSK has several weaknesses—the key must
be kept secret, it can be difficult to manage multiple devices, the key itself may be weak,
keys must be entered manually—the alternative requires a significant investment in hard-
ware and software. Authentication for WPA Enterprise uses a higher-level authentication
process.
Some references confuse shared key authentication with PSK. They
are not the same. With shared key authentication, the AP sends to a
device wanting to join the network a block of text known as the
challenge text, which it then encrypts with its WEP key and returns
it to the AP. By contrast, with PSK, the same secret key value is
manually distributed to any approved device.

Although an improvement over WEP, WPA nevertheless has weaknesses. One of the design
goals of WPA was to fit into the existing WEP engine without requiring extensive hardware
upgrades or replacements. Because most existing WEP devices at the time WPA was released
had very limited central processing unit (CPU) capabilities—with many APs operating at less
than 40 MHz—a series of compromises made to be made. Although this allowed WEP to be
modified to run WPA through software-based firmware upgrades on the AP and software
upgrades on wireless devices, these constraints limited the security of WPA. WPA was only
designed as an interim short-term solution to address the critical WEP vulnerabilities and
was not seen as a long-term solution.
One of the serious limitations of WPA was even noted in the IEEE
standard. It says, “A passphrase typically has about 2.5 bits of security
per character, so the passphrase of n bytes equates to a key with
about 2.5n 1 12 bits of security. Hence, it provides a relatively low
level of security, with keys generated from short passwords subject to
dictionary attack. Use of the key hash is recommended only where it is impractical to make use
of a stronger form of user authentication. A key generated from a passphrase of less than
about 20 characters is unlikely to deter attacks.”

5.1.1. Identify and describe the strengths, weaknesses, appropriate
uses, and implementation of the IEEE 802.11 security-related items.
In March 2001 the IEEE TGi task group voted to split into two separate groups, one
to address Quality of Service (QoS) issues, known as TGe, and one to address security. The
security group, still designated TGi, started work on new wireless security mechanisms
(as opposed to transitional solutions such as WEP2). After three years of effort, in June 2004
the IEEE 802.11i wireless security standard was ratified. Also known as the robust
security network (RSN), 802.11i provides a solid wireless security model. In September 2004
the Wi-Fi Alliance introduced WPA2, which was the second generation of WPA security.
WPA2 is based on the final IEEE 802.11i standard and is almost identical to it. As with
WPA there are two modes of WPA2, WPA2 Personal for individuals or small office/home
offices (SOHOs) and WPA2 Enterprise for larger enterprises, schools, and government
agencies.
The difference between WPA2 and IEEE 802.11i is that WPA2 allows
wireless clients using TKIP to operate in the same WLAN whereas
IEEE 802.11i does not permit them.
IEEE 802.11i/WPA2 addresses the two major security areas of WLANs, namely encryption
and authentication.

Encryption
The 802.11i/WPA2 standard addresses encryption by replacing the RC4 stream cipher
algorithm with a more secure block cipher. A stream cipher takes one character and replaces it
with another character, as shown in Figure 10-4. A block cipher manipulates an entire block of
plaintext at one time. The plaintext message is divided into separate blocks of 8 to 16 bytes, and
then each block is encrypted independently. For additional security, the blocks can be random-
ized. Stream ciphers are more prone to attack because the engine that generates the stream does
not vary; the only change is the plaintext itself. Because of this consistency, an attacker can
examine the streams and may be able to determine the key. Block ciphers are considered more
secure because the output is more random. When using a block cipher, the cipher is reset to
its original state after each block is processed. This results in the ciphertext being more difficult
to break.
The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the block cipher used in IEEE 802.11i/WPA2.
AES performs three steps on every block (128 bits) of plaintext. Within the second step,
multiple iterations (called rounds) are performed depending upon the key size: a 128-bit
key performs 9 rounds, a 192-bit key performs 11 rounds, and a 256-bit key, known as
AES-256, uses 13 rounds. Within each round, bytes are substituted and rearranged, and then
special multiplication is performed based on the new arrangement. For the 802.11i/WPA2
implementation of AES, a 128-bit key length is used in four stages that make up one round,
and each round is then performed 10 times.
AES is the official encryption standard for the U.S. government.
The encryption protocol used for 802.11i/WPA2 is the Counter Mode with Cipher Block
Chaining Message Authentication Code Protocol (CCMP) and specifies the use of CCM
(a general-purpose cipher mode algorithm providing data privacy) with AES. The Cipher Block
Chaining Message Authentication Code (CBC-MAC) component of CCMP provides data
integrity and authentication.

CCM itself does not require that a specific block cipher be used, but
the most secure cipher AES is mandated by the IEEE 802.11i/WPA2
standard. For this reason CCMP for WLANs is sometimes designated
as AES-CCMP.
Although CCMP uses a completely different encryption algorithm than TKIP, there are simi-
larities to the process. Both CCMP and TKIP use a 128-bit key for encryption. Also, CCMP
includes a 48-bit value that is sent in cleartext as does TKIP. Although TKIP calls this value a
TKIP sequence counter (TSC), CCMP more properly calls it a packet number (PN). Finally,
both methods use a 64-bit MIC value. However, CCMP’s MIC protects everything in the
802.11 media access control (MAC) header (except for the duration field) while the TKIP
MIC protects only the source and destination addresses.
The steps in the CCMP encryption process are illustrated in Figure 10-5.
1. The Logical Link Control (LLC) sublayer of the Data Layer (Layer 2) sends the data
unit to the MAC sublayer where the MAC header information is added. This data unit
becomes the MAC Protocol Data Unit (MPDU).
2. The MAC header is split apart from the MPDU and the 64-bit CCMP header is
calculated and added.
3. Information from the MAC header is used to create the 64-bit MIC value, which protects
the CCMP header, the data, and parts of the MAC header. The MIC is then appended to
the end of the data payload.
4. The data payload and the MIC are encrypted to create the ciphertext, after which the
CCMP header is prepended to the ciphertext.
5. Finally the MAC header is added back to the MPDU.

Despite the fact that AES is an efficient block cipher, CCMP still
requires a separate encryption processor.
Authentication
Authentication for the IEEE 802.11i/WPA2 Personal model uses the same as WPA Personal,
namely PSK. Authentication for the IEEE 802.11i/WPA2 Enterprise model uses the IEEE
802.1X standard. This standard, originally developed for wired networks, provides a greater
degree of security by implementing port-based authentication. IEEE 802.1X blocks all traffic
on a port-by-port basis until the client is authenticated using credentials stored on an authen-
tication server. This prevents an unauthenticated device from receiving any network traffic
until its identity can be verified. It also strictly limits access to the device that provides the
authentication to prevent attackers from reaching it.
IEEE 802.1X is often used in conjunction with RADIUS, or Remote Authentication Dial In
User Service. This was developed in 1992 and quickly became the industry standard with
widespread support across nearly all vendors of networking equipment. RADIUS is suitable
for what are called “high-volume service control applications.”
The word Remote in RADIUS’ name is now almost a misnomer
because RADIUS authentication is used for more than just dial-in
networks.
A RADIUS client is not the device requesting authentication, such as a wireless laptop.
Instead, a RADIUS client is typically a device such as an AP that is responsible for sending
user credentials and connection parameters in the form of a RADIUS message to a RADIUS
server. The RADIUS server authenticates and authorizes the RADIUS client request, and
sends back a RADIUS message response. RADIUS clients also send RADIUS accounting mes-
sages to RADIUS servers. The strength of RADIUS is that messages are never directly sent
between the wireless device and the RADIUS server. This prevents an attacker from penetrat-
ing the RADIUS server and compromising security.
The detailed steps for RADIUS authentication with a wireless device in an IEEE 802.1X net-
work are illustrated in Figure 10-6:
1. A wireless device, called the supplicant (it makes an “appeal” for access), sends a request
to an AP requesting permission to join the WLAN. The AP prompts the user for the user
ID and password.
2. The AP, serving as the authenticator that will accept or reject the wireless device, creates a
data packet from this information called the authentication request. This packet includes
information such as identifying the specific AP that is sending the authentication request
and the user name and password. For protection from eavesdropping, the AP (acting
as a RADIUS client) encrypts the password before it is sent to the RADIUS server. The
authentication request is sent over the network from the AP to the RADIUS server.
This communication can be done either over a local area network or a wide area network.
This allows the RADIUS clients to be remotely located from the RADIUS server. If the
RADIUS server cannot be reached, the AP can usually route the request to an alternate server.

3. When an authentication request is received, the RADIUS server validates that the
request is from an approved AP and then decrypts the data packet to access the user
name and password information. This information is passed on to the appropriate security
user database. This could be a text file, a password file, a commercially available security
system, or a custom database.
4. If the user name and password are correct, the RADIUS server sends an authentication
acknowledgment that includes information on the user’s network system and service
requirements. For example, the RADIUS server may tell the AP that the user needs
TCP/IP. The acknowledgment can even contain filtering information to limit a user’s
access to specific resources on the network. If the user name and password are not
correct, the RADIUS server sends an authentication reject message to the AP and the
user is denied access to the network. To ensure that requests are not responded to by
unauthorized persons or devices on the network, the RADIUS server sends an authenti-
cation key, or signature, identifying itself to the RADIUS client.
5. If accounting is also supported by the RADIUS server, an entry is started in the account-
ing database.
6. Once the server information is received and verified by the AP, it enables the necessary
configuration to deliver the wireless services to the user.
RADIUS allows an organization to maintain user profiles in a central database that all
remote servers can share. Doing so increases security, allowing a company to set up a policy
that can be applied at a single administered network point. Having a central service also
means that it is easier to track usage for billing and for keeping network statistics.

It is important that the communication between the supplicant, authenticator, and authenti-
cation server in an IEEE 802.1X configuration be secure. A framework for transporting
the authentication protocols is known as the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).
Despite its name, EAP is a framework for transporting authentication protocols instead
of the authentication protocol itself. EAP essentially defines the format of the messages.
EAP uses four types of packets: request, response, success and failure. Request packets
are issued by the authenticator and ask for a response packet from the supplicant. Any
number of request-response exchanges may be used to complete the authentication. If the
authentication is successful, a success packet is sent to the supplicant; if not, a failure packet
is sent.
An EAP packet contains a field that indicates the function of the
packet (such as response or request) and an identifier field used to
match requests and responses. Response and request packets also
have a field that indicates the type of data being transported (such
as an authentication protocol) along with the data itself.
The seven different EAP protocols supported in WPA2 Enterprise are listed in Table 10-1.
WPA2 can even support new EAP types as they become available.
A relatively new technology combines many of the advantages of 802.1X with the ease of
use of PSK. Known as Per-User Preshared Keys (PPSK), unique passphrases can be assigned
individually to each user on a WLAN while still using a common SSID. This allows users to
be separately authenticated (as with 802.1X) only by entering a passphrase on the user’s
wireless device (as with PSK). When using PPSK different profiles can be created for each
user so that the users can have different levels of service. In addition, one user’s credentials
can be revoked without impacting other users.
A summary of the WPA2 security models is listed in Table 10-2.

Despite the fact that IEEE 802.11i/WPA2 provides the optimum level
of wireless security and has been mandatory for all wireless devices
certified by the Wi-Fi Alliance since March 2006, there are still a surpris-
ing number of WLAN networks that do not implement it. In a recent
analysis by this author, 23 different WLANs were discovered in
one residential neighborhood. Thirteen of those networks, or 56 percent, used the weak WEP
encryption and open key authentication. The other WLANs used WPA (4) or had no security (3)
and only three networks used the secure WPA2. In another test, 26 WLANs were found with six
running WPA2, three using WPA, and 17 were open.

In an enterprise setting, the likelihood of more sophisticated wireless attacks is always
present. This is due to the higher rewards of an attacker reading sensitive data, hijacking
wireless connections, inserting network traffic, or performing DoS attacks. It is important
that wireless security systems be in place with sophisticated tools for monitoring and
containing wireless attacks.
Wireless Security Systems
An intrusion system is a security management system that compiles information from a com-
puter network or individual computer and then analyzes it to identify security vulnerabilities
and attacks. Although similar in nature to a firewall, an intrusion system differs in that a fire-
wall limits access from external networks by silently filtering packets based on such criteria
as the sender’s IP address or whether the packet was requested by a device on the protected
network. An intrusion system, on the other hand, watches for systematic attacks instead of
just a single malicious packet and then takes specified action.

There are two types of intrusion systems for wireless LANs. The first is a wireless intrusion
detection system while the second is a more sophisticated wireless intrusion prevention system.
Each of these types use wireless sensors to accumulate data.
Wireless Intrusion Detection Systems (WIDS) The first generation of intrusion
detection systems for wired networks monitored the overall activity of network traffic and
focused on detection of attacks. In wireless networks a wireless intrusion detection system
(WIDS) serves a similar function by constantly monitoring the radio frequency (RF) for
attacks. If an attack is detected, the WIDS sends information about what just occurred.
There are different methods used for detecting a wireless attack. One method for auditing
usage is to examine network traffic, activity, and transactions and look for well-known
patterns, much like anti-virus scanning. This is known as signature-based monitoring because
it compares activities against a predefined signature. Signature-based monitoring requires
access to an updated database of signatures along with a means to actively compare and
match current behavior against a collection of signatures. One of the weaknesses of
signature-based monitoring is that the signature databases must be constantly updated, and
as the number of signatures grows the behaviors must be compared against an increasingly
large number of signatures. Also, if the signature definitions are too specific, signature-based
monitoring can miss variations. A signature-based WIDS is illustrated in Figure 10-7.
A signature-based WIDS is looking for a specific attack that has
already been documented.

A second method, anomaly-based monitoring, is designed for detecting statistical anomalies.
First, a baseline of normal activities is compiled over time. (A baseline is a reference set of data
against which operational data is compared.) Then, whenever there is a significant deviation
from this baseline, an alarm is raised. An advantage of this approach is that it can detect the
anomalies quickly without trying to first determine the underlying cause. However, normal
behavior can change easily and even quickly, so anomaly-based monitoring is subject to false
positives, or alarms that are raised when there is no actual abnormal behavior. In addition,
anomaly-based monitoring can impose heavy processing loads on the systems where they are
being used. This is because it requires large numbers of CPU cycles to process the data. Finally,
because anomaly-based monitoring takes time to create statistical baselines, it can fail to detect
events before the baseline is completed. An anomaly-based WIDS is shown in Figure 10-8.
When creating baselines, it is important to measure the performance
parameters under normal network conditions and not when there is
an unusual amount of traffic, number of users, or other abnormal
circumstances.
Behavior-based monitoring attempts to overcome the limitations of both anomaly-based moni-
toring and signature-based monitoring by being more adaptive and proactive, instead of reactive.
Rather than using statistics or signatures as the standard by which comparisons are made,
behavior-based monitoring uses the “normal” processes and actions as the standard. Behavior-
based monitoring continuously analyzes the behavior of processes and programs on a system and
alerts the user if it detects any abnormal actions, at which point the user can decide whether to
allow or block the activity. One of the advantages of behavior-based monitoring is that it is not
necessary to update signature files or compile a baseline of statistical behavior before monitor-
ing can take place. In addition, behavior-based monitoring can more quickly stop new attacks.
The final method takes a completely different approach and does not try to compare actions
against previously determined standards (like anomaly-based monitoring and signature-based

monitoring) or behavior (like behavior-based monitoring). Instead, it is founded on experience-
based techniques. Known as heuristic monitoring, it attempts to answer the question, Will this
do something harmful if it is allowed to execute? Heuristic (from the Greek word for find or
discover) uses an algorithm to determine if a threat exists.
Once a wireless attack is detected, a WIDS can perform different actions. A passive WIDS
will simply sound an alarm and log the event. These alarms may include sending e-mail,
page, or a cell phone message to the network administrator or even playing an audio file
that says “Attack is taking place.” An active WIDS will both sound an alarm and take
action. The actions may include configuring the firewall to filter out the IP address of the
intruder, launching a separate program to handle the event, or terminating the TCP session.
Wireless Intrusion Prevention Systems (WIPS) Although WIDS are sophisticated
devices, they have disadvantages:
●
WIDS cannot prevent an attack. Because a passive WIDS only identifies that an attack
has started, it does nothing to prevent the attack from occurring. The system adminis-
trator must make a decision about how to proceed after receiving the WIDS notification.
●
WIDS only issues an alert after an attack has started. A WIDS only knows that an attack
has started after the attack has commenced. By then damage may have already occurred.
●
WIDS is dependent upon signatures. A signature-based WIDS relies entirely upon the
database of known attack signatures in order to recognize an attack. If a new attack is
launched for which this is no attack signature or if the database is not constantly updated,
the WIDS provides no protection.
●
WIDS produces a high number of false positives. Due to the analytic nature of anomaly-
based WIDS, a large number of attack alerts are issued that turn out to be false positives.
This creates a tremendous burden on security administrators, especially for WLANs.
A more proactive approach than intrusion detection is a wireless intrusion prevention
system (WIPS). A WIPS monitors network traffic to immediately react to block a malicious
attack. One of the major differences between a WIDS and a WIPS is its location. A WIDS
has sensors that monitor the traffic entering and leaving a firewall, and reports back to the
central device for analysis. A WIPS, on the other hand, could be located “in line” on the
device itself. This can allow the WIPS to more quickly take action to block an attack.
WIDS/WIPS Sensors Both WIDS and WIPS rely upon a series of sensors to monitor
wireless network traffic and send traffic summaries to a central analysis server for examina-
tion. There are two types of sensors: integrated and overlay.
Integrated An integrated sensor (sometimes called an AP sensor or embedded sensor) uses
existing APs to monitor the RF. This approach is generally used to reduce costs by decreasing
or eliminating the need for separate sensors and infrastructure (wired cabling to connect
devices, power connections, etc.). Although an integrated-sensor WIDS/WIPS may seem to
have several advantages, requiring an AP to perform its normal functions as well as addi-
tional RF monitoring has significant drawbacks:
●
In an environment where the AP is supporting a large number of users, the additional
time needed to stop its normal functions and perform sensor tasks can negatively
impact throughput.

●
Because the AP is not dedicated to the task of watching for attacks, it is more likely
that an attack can slip through while the AP is performing its normal duties.
●
A basic IEEE 802.11b/g AP cannot monitor IEEE 802.11a channels and vice versa.
●
Integrated sensors have less spare time to perform other WIPS functions such as
blocking rogue APs.
●
Integrated sensors sequentially sample traffic on every available channel, trying to
listen long enough and frequently enough to detect an attack. An attack could slip in
on Channel 2 while the AP is scanning Channel 5. Also, attacks of short duration and
“quiet” rogue devices like wireless bridges are more likely to be missed in scanning.
Overlay An overlay sensor uses dedicated sensors for scanning the RF for attacks. Although
this results in higher costs, it does not impact WLAN throughput by placing an additional load
on the AP. Also, overlay sensors can scan more frequencies, provide broader coverage, and
detect more attacks. Another advantage of overlay sensors is that they can also be used
to troubleshoot WLAN performance issues.
There are disadvantages to an overlay sensor for WIDS/WIPS. Overlay sensors require addi-
tional user interfaces, consoles, and databases that must be integrated to avoid duplication. An
integrated sensor may be more likely to provide a single, integrated management interface for
configuring and monitoring the network. Also, some integrated sensors may have built-in crite-
ria to differentiate between legitimate APs and rogue APs, while an overlay sensor must be con-
figured with a list of authorized APs. Another disadvantage of overlay sensors is that if a regular
AP fails, the dedicated sensor cannot be pulled into emergency duty to provide coverage.
Features
A number of important features or attributes are found in WIDS/WIPS. These include AP
identification and categorization, device tracking, event action and notification, RF scanning,
and protocol analysis.
AP Identification and Categorization One of the most important features of a
WIDS/WIPS is its ability to learn about the other APs that are in the area and classify
those APs. This ability to “pre-classify” all known APs enables the WIDS/WIPS to recognize
rogue APs without delay. Using sensors, the existing APs in the area can be determined.
Next the APs can be tagged as to their status. The indicators are usually:
●
Authorized AP. This is an AP that has been installed and configured by the organiza-
tion and is part of the WLAN infrastructure.
●
Known AP. This is a “foreign” yet “friendly” AP (one not owned by the organization)
in which the RF signal is detected yet it is not considered as being dangerous. Known
APs may be those that belong to other organizations (such as on another floor of a
rented office building that houses multiple businesses).
●
Monitored AP. A monitored AP may be one in that the signal is usually detected
when scans are conducted. However, it is not owned by the organization (Authorized AP)
or another organization (Known AP) yet it cannot be verified that it is suspect. An AP that
is owned by a user in a nearby apartment complex may be tagged as a Monitored AP.
●
Rogue AP. Any AP that does not fit the profile of the above three types will be designated
as a rogue AP.

It is important for a wireless LAN administrator to thoroughly investi-
gate an AP before designating it as a “Known AP” to ensure that it
is not a rogue AP masquerading as a known AP.
Once specific parameters are assigned, most WIDS/WIPSs are able to perform automatic
classification and differentiate between authorized, known, monitored, and rogue APs. The
ability to perform this type of activity minimizes false positives and unnecessary alarms to
security administrators.
Device Tracking Whereas AP identification is primarily concerned with locating rogue
APs, device tracking involves the simultaneous tracking of all wireless devices within the
WLAN. Not only can device tracking be used to identify unauthorized device, but it also
can be beneficial for other uses such as:
●
Asset tracking of wireless equipment that has a high value or that have been stolen or
misplaced (called Real-Time Location Services or RTLS)
●
Finding an emergency Voice Over WiFi (VoWiFi) telephone caller
●
Troubleshooting sources of wireless network interference
●
Conducting a site survey
●
Determining a wireless user’s availability status based on location
Event Action and Notification An active WIDS or WIPS that identifies an attack must
immediately and automatically block any malicious wireless activity that has been detected by
its wireless sensors. These malicious activities include wireless DoS attacks, MAC address
spoofing, or allowing a device to associate with a rogue AP. In addition, it must block multiple
simultaneous attacks as well as continue to scan the RF looking for new attacks. And, once an
attack is detected it must notify security administrators through cell phone or e-mail alerts.
Not only must an active WIDS or WIPS stop all types of attacks, it
must do so while not disrupting legitimate wireless users or disturbing
another WLAN.
RF Scanning It is important that the entire RF spectrum be scanned for potential attacks.
This means that all channels in the 2.4-GHz range and the 5 GHz must be scanned.
Protocol Analysis Just as an attacker can use a protocol analyzer to detect what an
authorized user is doing, so can a WIDS/WIPS do the same to attackers. Several WIDS/
WIPS products offer remote packet capture and decode capabilities. The WIDS/WIPS can
view WLAN network traffic to determine exactly what is happening on the network and
help determine what actions need to be taken.
The features of a WIDS/WIPS are summarized in Table 10-3.
WIDS/WIPS security is not inexpensive. The cost for installing a
system to cover an environment of 250 APs can exceed $70,000.

There are other wireless security tools that can be used to protect a WLAN. These include a
virtual private network, secure device management protocols, Wi-Fi Protected Setup, role-
based access control, and rogue AP discovery tools.
Virtual Private Network (VPN)
A virtual private network (VPN) uses an unsecured public network, such as the Internet, as if it
were a secure private network. It does this by encrypting all data that is transmitted between the
remote device and the network. This ensures that any transmissions that are intercepted will be
indecipherable. There are two common types of VPNs. A remote-access VPN or virtual private
dial-up network (VPDN) is a user-to-LAN connection used by remote users. The second type is
a site-to-site VPN, in which multiple sites can connect to other sites over the Internet.
Several “tunneling” protocols (when a packet is encrypted and
enclosed within another packet) can be used for VPN transmissions.
VPN transmissions are achieved through communicating with endpoints. An endpoint is the
end of the tunnel between VPN devices. An endpoint can be software on a local computer,
a dedicated hardware device such as a VPN concentrator (which aggregates hundreds
or thousands of VPN connections), or integrated into another networking device such as a
firewall. Depending upon the type of endpoint that is being used, client software may
be required on the devices that are connecting to the VPN. Hardware devices that have a
built-in VPN endpoint handle all the VPN tunnel setup, encapsulation, and encryption in
the endpoint. Client devices are not required to run any special software and the entire VPN
process is transparent to them.

VPNs can be software-based or hardware-based. Software-based VPNs, in which the VPN
endpoint is actually software running on the device itself, offer the most flexibility in how
network traffic is managed. However, software-based VPNs do not provide the same perfor-
mance or security as a hardware-based VPN, generally speaking. Hardware-based VPNs are
more secure, have better performance, and can offer more features because only the network
devices manage the VPN functions, relieving the device from performing any VPN activities.
Hardware-based VPNs are generally used for connecting two local area networks through
the VPN tunnel.
VPNs can also be used in a wireless LAN setting as well. Because of WLAN vulnerabilities,
a wireless user can “tunnel” through the less-than-secure wireless network using a VPN, relying
on its security advantages. For example, a user may access a public wireless hotspot at an airport
or coffee shop and use VPN to “tunnel” through it to reach a secure corporate network.
Secure Device Management Protocols
When managing wireless devices such as APs, it is important to keep these transmissions
secure; otherwise, an attacker could capture the password to access an AP and reconfigure it
for his purposes. Cryptography can be used to protect this data as it is being transported
across a wireless network.
Perhaps the most common transport encryption algorithm is Secure Sockets Layer (SSL),
which is a protocol developed by Netscape for securely transmitting documents over the
Internet. Transport Layer Security (TLS) is a protocol that guarantees privacy and data
integrity between applications communicating over the Internet. TLS is an extension of SSL,
and they are often referred to as SSL/TLS. SSL/TLS provides server authentication, client
authentication, and data encryption.
One widespread use of SSL is to secure Web Hypertext Transport Protocol (HTTP) commu-
nications between a browser and a remote device. This secure version is actually “plain”
HTTP sent over SSL/TLS and is called Hypertext Transport Protocol over Secure Sockets
Layer (HTTPS). HTTPS uses port 443 instead of HTTP’s port 80. Users must enter URLs
with https:// instead of http://. Because many APs and wireless routers are configured using a
Web browser, the transmissions between these devices can usually be configured to use
HTTPS, as illustrated in Figure 10-9.
Another option is to use Secure Shell (SSH), which is an encrypted alternative to the Telnet pro-
tocol that is used to access remote computers. It provides an encrypted channel for logging into
another computer over a network, executing commands on a remote computer, and moving
files from one computer to another. The current version of SSH is Secure Shell 2 (SSH2).
The Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP), which was first introduced in 1988, is
supported by most network equipment manufacturers and is a popular protocol used to
manage network equipment. It allows network administrators to remotely monitor, manage,
and configure devices on the network. SNMP functions by exchanging management informa-
tion between networked devices.
SNMP can be found not only on core network devices such as switches,
routers, hubs, and wireless APs, but also on some printers, copiers, fax
machines, and even uninterruptible power supplies (UPSs).

Each SNMP-managed device must have an agent or a service that listens for commands and
then executes them. These agents are protected with a password known as a community
string in order to prevent unauthorized users from taking control over a device. There are
two types of community strings: a read-only string will allow information from the agent to
be viewed, and a read-write string allows settings on the device to be changed.
There were several security vulnerabilities with the use of community strings in the first two
versions of SNMP, known as SNMPv1 and SNMPv2. First, the default SNMP community
strings for read-only and read-write were public and private, respectively. Administrators
who did not change these default strings left open the possibility of an attacker taking control
of the network device. Also, community strings were transmitted “in the clear” with no
attempt to encrypt the contents. An attacker with a protocol analyzer could view the contents
of the strings as they were being transmitted. Because of the security vulnerabilities of
SNMPv1 and SNMPv2, SNMPv3 was introduced in 1998. SNMPv3 uses user names and
passwords along with encryption to foil any attempts to view the contents.
Wi-Fi Protected Setup
Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is an optional means of configuring security on wireless local
area networks. Introduced by the Wi-Fi Alliance in early 2007, it is designed to help users who
have little or no knowledge of security to quickly and easily implement WPA2 on their WLANs.

There are two common WPS methods. The PIN method utilizes a Personal Identification
Number (PIN) printed on a sticker of the wireless router or displayed through a software setup
wizard. The user types in the PIN into the wireless device (like a wireless tablet or laptop com-
puter) and the security configuration automatically occurs. This is the mandatory model and all
devices certified for WPS must support it. The second method is the Push-Button method: the
user pushes a button (usually an actual button on the wireless router and a virtual one displayed
through a software setup wizard on the wireless device) and the security configuration takes
place. Support for this model is mandatory for wireless routers and optional for connecting
devices. Behind the scenes of these two methods a series of EAP message exchanges occur.
Over 700 different wireless devices have been certified by the Wi-Fi
Alliance to run WPS.
However, in late 2011 it was revealed that there are significant design and implementation
flaws in WPS using the PIN method:
●
There is no lockout limit for entering PINs, so an attacker can make an unlimited
number of PIN attempts.
●
The last PIN character is only a checksum.
●
The wireless router reports the validity of the first and second halves of the PIN sepa-
rately, so essentially an attacker only has to break two short PIN values (a 4-character
PIN and a 3-character PIN).
Due to the PIN being broken down into two shorter values only 11,000 different PINs must
be attempted before determining the correct value. If the attacker’s computer can generate
1.3 PIN attempts per second (or 46 attempts per minute) he can crack the PIN in less than
four hours and become connected to the WLAN, effectively defeating WPA2.
It is recommended that all users should disable WPS in the wireless
router’s configuration menu.
Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
In a wired network, the network can be segmented through constructing a virtual local area
network (VLAN). A VLAN is a logical grouping of network devices within a larger physical
network. For example, a VLAN group may consist of all the accounting department employ-
ees even if they are scattered across different floors of an office building or even in different
buildings. Wireless VLANs can also be used in a WLAN. This allows different users to con-
nect to different wireless VLANs based on different criteria. One method is to use Role-Based
Access Control (RBAC). Access under RBAC is based on a user’s job function within an
organization. Instead of setting security permissions for each user or group, the RBAC
model assigns permissions to particular roles in the organization, and then assigns users to
those roles. For example, instead of creating a user account for Ahmed and assigning specific
security settings to that account, the role Business_Manager can be created based on the
privileges an individual in that job function should have. Then Ahmed and all other business

managers in the organization can be assigned to that role. The users and objects inherit all of
the permissions for the role.
Roles are different than groups. While users may belong to multiple
groups, a user under RBAC can be assigned only one role. In addi-
tion, under RBAC, users cannot be given permissions beyond those
available for their role.
Rogue AP Discovery Tools
The problem of rogue (unauthorized) APs is of increasing concern to organizations. Due to
the low cost of home wireless APs, an employee can bring a device to their office and plug it
into an open network connection to provide wireless access for themself and other employ-
ees. However, rogue APs are serious threats to network security because they allow attackers
to intercept the RF signal and bypass network security to attack the network or capture sen-
sitive data.
There are several ways to detect a rogue AP. The most basic method for identifying and
locating a rogue AP is for security personnel to manually audit the airwaves using a wireless
protocol analyzer. As the personnel walk through the building or area, the protocol analyzer
captures wireless traffic, which is then compared with a list of known approved devices.
However, this manual approach can be extremely time-consuming and haphazard when
scanning several buildings or a large geographical area. Most organizations elect to use a
more reliable approach of continuously monitoring the RF airspace. Monitoring the RF
frequency requires a special sensor called a wireless probe, a device that can monitor the air-
waves for traffic.
There are four types of wireless probes:
●
Wireless device probe. A standard wireless device, such as a portable laptop computer,
can be configured to act as a wireless probe. At regular intervals during the normal
course of operation, the device can scan and record wireless signals within its range
and report this information to a centralized database. This scanning is performed when
the device is idle and not receiving any transmissions. When a large number of mobile
devices are used as wireless device probes, it can provide a high degree of accuracy in
identifying rogue APs. However, there are limitations. First, because a wireless device
cannot simultaneously listen and send, there can be gaps in the coverage. Also, not all
wireless network interface card adapters can act as a wireless device probe.
●
Desktop probe. Instead of using a mobile wireless device as a probe, a desktop probe
utilizes a standard desktop PC. A universal serial bus (USB) wireless network interface
card adapter is plugged into the desktop computer and it monitors the RF frequency in
the area for transmissions.
●
AP probe. Some APs can detect neighboring APs, which may include both friendly APs
as well as rogue APs. However, AP probes are not widely implemented. The range for
a single AP to recognize other APs is limited because APs are typically located so that
their signals only overlap in such a way to provide roaming to wireless users. Also, not
all vendors support AP probing.
●
Dedicated probe. A dedicated probe is designed to exclusively monitor the RF
frequency for transmissions. Unlike AP probes that serve as both an AP and a probe,

dedicated probes only monitor the airwaves. Dedicated probes look very similar to
standard APs.
Once a suspicious wireless signal is detected by a wireless probe, the information is sent to a
centralized database where WLAN management system software compares it to a list of
approved APs. If the device is not on the list, then it is considered a rogue AP. The managed
switch is “aware” of approved APs and the ports to which they are connected. The WLAN
management system can cause the switch to disable the port to which the rogue AP is
connected, thus severing its connection to the wired network.
Chapter Summary
■To address WEP vulnerabilities, several transitional solutions were developed. WEP2
attempted to overcome the limitations of WEP by adding two new security enhancements:
the WEP key was increased to 128 bits from 64 bits to address the weakness of encryp-
tion and a different authentication system, known as Kerberos, was used. However, it
became apparent that WEP2 had its own security vulnerabilities, so WEP2 was rarely
implemented. Dynamic WEP solves the weak IV problem by rotating the keys frequently,
making it much more difficult to crack the encrypted wireless transmissions. Dynamic
WEP uses different keys for different types of traffic.
■The Wi-Fi Alliance in 2003 introduced Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) as a transitional
solution. The basis of WPA is a new encryption technology called Temporal Key Integrity
Protocol (TKIP). TKIP adds an additional layer of security while still preserving WEP’s
basic functionality. TKIP uses a longer 128-bit per-packet key that dynamically generates
a new key for each packet, thus preventing collisions. WPA also includes a Message
Integrity Check (MIC), designed to prevent an attacker from conducting active
or passive man-in-the-middle attacks by capturing, altering, and resending data
packets. Authentication for WPA Personal is accomplished by using a preshared
key (PSK), which is a secret value that is manually entered on both the AP and
each wireless device. Although an improvement over WEP, WPA nevertheless has
weaknesses. WPA was only designed as an interim short-term solution to address
the critical WEP vulnerabilities.
■The IEEE 802.11i wireless security standard provides a solid wireless security model.
The Wi-Fi Alliance Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2) is the second generation of WPA
security; WPA2 is based on the final IEEE 802.11i standard and is almost identical to it.
There are two modes of WPA2: WPA2 Personal for individuals or small office/home
offices (SOHOs) and WPA Enterprise for larger enterprises, schools, and government
agencies. The 802.11i/WPA2 standard replaces the RC4 stream cipher with a more
secure block cipher that manipulates an entire block of plaintext at one time. The
Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) is the block cipher. The encryption protocol used
for 802.11i/WPA2 is the Counter Mode with Cipher Block Chaining Message Authen-
tication Code Protocol (CCMP) with AES. Authentication for IEEE 802.11i/WPA2
Enterprise model uses the IEEE 802.1X standard. This standard, originally developed
for wired networks, provides a greater degree of security by implementing port-based
authentication. IEEE 802.1X is often used in conjunction with RADIUS, or Remote
Authentication Dial In User Service. A framework for transporting the authentication
protocols is known as the Extensible Authentication Protocol (EAP).

■A wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) constantly monitors the radio frequency
(RF) for attacks. There are different methods used for detecting a wireless attack.
Signature-based monitoring compares activities against a predefined signature. Anomaly-
based monitoring is designed to detect statistical anomalies by comparing actions against
a baseline of normal activities. Behavior-based monitoring uses the “normal” processes
and actions as the standard. Heuristic monitoring looks deeper and attempts to answer
the question, Will this do something harmful if it is allowed to execute?
■A more proactive approach than intrusion detection is a wireless intrusion prevention sys-
tem (WIPS). A WIPS monitors network traffic to immediately react to block a malicious
attack. Both WIDS and WIPS rely upon a series of sensors to monitor wireless network
traffic and send traffic summaries to a central analysis server for examination. There are
two types of sensors, integrated and overlay. There are a number of important features or
attributes that are found in WIDS/WIPS. These include AP identification and categoriza-
tion, device tracking, event action and notification, RF scanning, and protocol analysis.
■There are other wireless security tools that can be used to protect a WLAN. A virtual
private network (VPN) uses an unsecured public network, such as the Internet, as if
it were a secure private network. VPNs can be used in a wireless LAN to protect
transmissions. When managing wireless devices such as APs it is important that these
transmissions remain secure. WLAN vulnerabilities make it possible for a wireless
user to “tunnel” through the less-than-secure wireless network using a VPN, relying on
its security advantages. Hypertext Transport Protocol over Secure Sockets Layer
(HTTPS) can be used to protect transmissions, as can Secure Shell (SSH2), an encrypted
alternative to the Telnet protocol that is used to access remote computers. The Simple
Network Management Protocol (SNMP) is supported by most network equipment
manufacturers and is a popular protocol used to manage network equipment. The Wi-Fi
Protected Setup is an optional means to simplify the configuration and activation of
WPA2 Personal. Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) can be used to assign permissions
to particular roles in the organization, and then assign users to those roles. The problem
of rogue (unauthorized) APs is of increasing concern to organizations. A rogue AP can
be detected via a manual audit of an area’s airwaves or via a wireless probe.

Case Project 10-1: Firesheep
A wireless LAN attack that illustrates the vulnerabilities of using an unen-
crypted public hotspot is called Firesheep. Firesheep, a free open-source Firefox
browser extension, allows a user to connect to an unencrypted wireless net-
work and then imitate any other person who is connected to the same network through a
technique known as “sidejacking.”Use the Internet to research Firesheep. How does it work?
What are the defenses against it? What are the risks of using an unencrypted hotspot? Write a
one-page paper about Firesheep.
Case Project 10-2: EAP
Use the Internet to research information about the seven different EAP protocols that are
supported in WPA2 Enterprise listed in Table 10-1. Write a brief description of each and
indicate the relative strength of its security. Write a one-page paper on your research.
Case Project 10-3: IEEE 802.1X
Why is IEEE 802.1X considered to be most secure type of authentication? Using the Internet
and other print sources, research IEEE 802.1X and RADIUS servers. When was this standard
developed? Why? Where is it being used today? Write a one-page paper on your research.

Case Project 10-4: Your Wireless Security Model
Is the wireless network you own as secure as it should be? Examine your wireless network
or that of a friend or neighbor and determine which security model it uses. Next, outline
the steps it would take to move it to the next highest level. Estimate how much it would
cost and how much time it would take to increase the level. Finally, estimate how long it
would take you to replace all of the data on your computer if it was corrupted by an attacker,
and what you might lose. Would this be motivation to increase your current wireless security
model?
Case Project 10-5: Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS)
Wi-Fi Protected Setup (WPS) is an optional means of configuring security on wireless local
area networks designed to help users who have little or no knowledge of security to quickly
and easily implement WPA2 on their WLANs. Use the Internet to research WPS. How does
it work? Describe the four WPS models (note that the USB model is now discontinued).
What are the EAP message types that are exchanged? Finally, describe its security vulner-
abilities. What recommendations would you make to the vendors to increase the strength of
WPS? Write a one-page paper on your research.
Case Project 10-6: Wi-Fi Alliance Certificates
Is your wireless router Wi-Fi certified? If so, what are its features? The Wi-Fi Alliance makes
the certificates of approved devices available for download. Determine the brand and model
of your wireless router and then point your Web browser to certifications.wi-fi.org/search_
products.php. Click Access Point for Home or Small Office (Wireless Router). Locate your
wireless router (or if it’s not listed select a similar model). Right-click on Certificate and
download the PDF file. Open the file and view the information about your device. Is this
information helpful? Would you use this information before purchasing your next wireless
device? Why or why not?
Case Project 10-7: Nautilus IT Consulting
A computer technology business called Nautilus IT Consulting (NITC) needs your assistance
with one of their clients.
Hair Emporium, a regional chain of upscale hair salons, provides free wireless access to its
patrons and also uses it for all of their inventory and point-of-sale systems. Recently an
attacker compromised the wireless LAN at one of their salons. Hair Emporium discovered
that the person who set up their WLAN used WEP for security. Emporium has turned to
Nautilus IT Consulting for help.
1. Prepare a PowerPoint presentation that outlines the weaknesses of WEP along with
the different models of wireless security and the features included in each model. Also,
create a graph of “Most Vulnerable” to “Least Vulnerable” with each model listed.
Identify where Hair Emporium would fit on the graph. Your presentation should be at
least eight slides in length.
2. Hair Emporium is also interested in an IDS but cannot decide if a WIDS or a WIPS
should be purchased. Write a one-page member with your recommendation. Justify
your reasons.

Since the economic downturn of 2008, shoppers don’t shop like they used to. This is
primarily due to two factors. First, in the postrecession age, consumers are much
more frugal. Second, online resources have had a dramatic impact on how consumers
shop. Instead of visiting the mall and walking store-to-store in search of merchandise,
many shoppers instead turn first to the Web. Online shoppers can search for an item,
compare similar products, read reviews, and see a list comparing prices from online
retailers. All that is left to do is select the lowest-priced item, pay for it online, and
have it directly shipped to them.
These two factors have also impacted consumer shopping habits when they
do visit traditional brick-and-mortar stores. Not only do shoppers visit these stores
less often, but when they do go on a shopping trip, they visit fewer stores. Today
consumers on average only visit three different stores per trip, whereas five stores
per trip used to be the norm. Some shoppers come to stores only to see and touch
the merchandise before returning back home to order it online. Other shoppers
come with their online research in hand so they know all about specific brands,
prices, and availability. And instead of purchasing the first product they see, they
may instead use a smartphone app and scan the item’s bar code to bring up a
list of comparison prices in other nearby stores to be sure they are getting the
best deal.
With all of these tools available, most consumers today directly target the mer-
chandise they want to purchase and resist general browsing or impulse shopping.
Known as “mission shoppers,” these thrifty, tech-savvy consumers have made it
much more difficult for stores to maintain their desired sales per square foot of
floor space, a common metric used in retailing.
Several retailers are trying to change shoppers’ habits by using wireless LAN tech-
nology in new ways. One clothing retailer now gives all of its sales clerks tablet
computers that are connected to the store’s WLAN. These tablets can be used by the
clerks to help a customer determine if an item is currently in inventory or located at
another store. In clothing stores, instead of focusing on a single item, sales clerks can
create entire outfits for customers on their mobile devices. If any of the apparel items
are not in stock, they can be immediately ordered and shipped to the customer’s
home. Wireless tablets are also being used to show customers items that are only
available online. This helps stores reduce the amount of inventory they must carry.
In addition, these tablets can be used as portable handheld checkout devices as
well. The customer can simply hand the mobile sales clerk her plastic credit card to
ring up the sale instead of getting into a line at the checkout counter.

In the realm of wireless networks, properly designing, installing, and securing a wireless LAN
are important tasks. Yet an equally important job is managing the WLAN. Wireless networks
require more management than wired networks. This is because of the nature of wireless net-
works. Even activities that appear unrelated to computer networks may have an impact upon
the WLAN. For example, the installation of a new photocopy machine or the relocation of a
large potted plant may affect the WLAN’s radio frequency (RF) signal, resulting in poor con-
nectivity or slow transmission speeds. Wireless LAN managers should constantly monitor and
adjust wireless network settings in order to provide optimum performance to their users. It’s
also important to understand that the security required to keep a wireless network safe is dif-
ferent from a wired LAN.
In this chapter you explore some of the tasks involved in managing a wireless LAN. First, you
will explore procedural security defenses. Next, steps for monitoring the network’s perfor-
mance will be explored. Finally, you will look at what it takes to maintain a WLAN.

network—such

using rogue access point (AP) discovery tools—are important steps for making a WLAN safe.
But security defenses go beyond technical solutions. They also involve implementing the correct
security procedures within the organization to ensure that the technical defenses remain solid.
These procedural security defenses include managing risk and creating defenses against attacks.
The technical defenses of securing a WLAN are covered in Chapter 10.
Yet even one large retailer is moving beyond that. It has rolled out new tech-
nology in almost half of its 900 stores that lets shoppers use their own mobile phones
instead of relying on sales clerks with tablets. After installing an app on a smart-
phone, a shopper can simply scan a bar code of the item in a store using the phone’s
camera. The item is instantly paid for by using the customer’s credit card number
on file. Information is then sent to a dedicated pick-up area in the store where the
customer can retrieve the item before going home. Despite the convenience these
new shopping technologies have introduced, there are security risks associated with
them that must be managed.

Managing Risk
One of the first steps in implementing procedural security defenses is to manage risk. This
involves understanding what risk is and the role that it plays in security defenses. One exam-
ple of risk is social engineering attacks.
Some security defenses may differ based on the size of the organiza-
tion. Most organizations can be classified as Small Office/Home
Office (SOHO), Small and Medium Business (SMB), and Enterprise.
What Is Risk? Suppose that Gabe wants to purchase a new set of rims for his car. How-
ever, because several cars have had their rims stolen near his condo, he is concerned about
someone stealing his rims. Although he parks the car in the gated parking lot, a hole in the
fence surrounding his condo makes it possible for someone to access the parking lot without
restriction. Gabe’s car and the threats to the rims are illustrated in Figure 11-1, along with
their corresponding information security component.
Gabe’s new rims are an asset, which is defined as an item that has value. In an organization,
assets have the following qualities: they provide value to the organization; they cannot easily
be replaced without a significant investment in expense, time, worker skill, and/or resources;
and they can form part of the organization’s corporate identity.
Not all elements of an organization’s information technology infra-
structure may be classified as an asset. For example, a faulty desktop
computer that can easily be replaced would generally not be consid-
ered an asset, yet the information contained on that computer can be
an asset.
Gabe is trying to protect his rims from a threat, which is a type of action that has the poten-
tial to cause harm. Information security threats are events or actions that represent a danger

to information assets. The mere existence of a threat does not mean that security has been
compromised; rather, it simply means that the potential for loss is real. For Gabe, the loss
would be the theft of his rims. In information security, a loss could take the form of infor-
mation theft, a delay in information being transmitted, or even the loss of good will or
reputation.
A threat agent is a person or element that has the power to carry out a threat. For Gabe the
threat agent is a thief. In information security, a threat agent could be a person attempting
to break into a secure computer network. It could also be a force of nature, such as a
tornado or flood that could destroy computer equipment and thus destroy information, or
it could be malicious software that attacks the computer network.
Gabe wants to protect his rims and is concerned about a hole in the fencing around his
condo. The hole in the fencing is a vulnerability, which is a flaw or weakness that allows a
threat agent to bypass security. An example of a vulnerability in the world of information
security is a software defect in an operating system that allows an unauthorized user to
gain control of a computer without the user’s knowledge or permission.
If a thief can get to Gabe’s car because of the hole in the fence, then that thief is taking
advantage of the vulnerability. This is known as exploiting the security weakness. An
attacker, knowing that an e-mail system does not scan attachments for a virus, is exploiting
the vulnerability by sending infected e-mail messages to its users.
Gabe must decide if the risk of theft is too high for him to purchase the new rims. A risk is
the likelihood that the threat agent will exploit the vulnerability; that is, that the rims will be
stolen. Realistically, risk can never be entirely eliminated as it would cost too much and take
too long. Rather, some degree of risk must always be assumed. An organization generally
asks, “How much risk can we tolerate?”
Sometimes risk is illustrated as the calculation Risk 5 Threat ×
Vulnerability × Cost.
There are three options when dealing with risks: accept the risk, diminish the risk, or trans-
fer the risk. In Gabe’s case, he could accept the risk and buy the new rims, knowing there is
the chance of them being stolen. Or he could diminish the risk by parking the car in a rented
locked garage. A third option is for Gabe to transfer the risk to someone else. He can do
this by purchasing additional car insurance; the insurance company then absorbs the loss
and pays if the rims are stolen. In information security, most risks should be diminished if
possible.
Social Engineering Attacks One morning a small group of strangers walked into the
corporate offices of a large shipping firm and soon walked out with access to the firm’s
entire computer network, which contained valuable and highly sensitive information. They
were able to accomplish this feat with no technical tools or skills:
1. Before entering the building, one member of the group called the company’s Human
Resource (HR) office and asked for the names of key employees. The office willingly
gave out the information without asking any questions.

2. As the group walked up to the building one of them pretended to have lost their key
code to the door, so a friendly employee let them in. When they entered a secured area
on the third floor, they claimed to have misplaced their identity badges so another smil-
ing employee opened the door for them.
3. Because these strangers knew that the chief financial officer (CFO) was out of town
due to his voicemail greeting message, they walked unchallenged into his office and
gathered information from his unprotected computer. They also dug through trash
receptacles and retrieved useful documents. A janitor was stopped and asked for a
garbage pail in which to place these documents so they could be carried out of the
building.
4. One of the group’s members then called the company’s Help Desk from the CFO’s
office and pretended to be the CFO (they had listened to his voice from his voicemail
greeting message and knew how he spoke). The imposter CFO claimed that he desperately
needed his password because he had forgotten it and was on his way to an important
meeting. The Help Desk gave out the password, and the group left the building with
complete access to the network.
This true story illustrates that more than technology is needed to repel attacks.i Social
engineering is a means of launching an attack or gathering information for an attack by
relying on the weaknesses of individuals. It represents one of the greatest risks that organiza-
tions today face. At its core, social engineering relies on an attacker’s clever manipulation of
human nature in order to persuade the victim to provide information or take actions. These
basic methods of persuasion include ingratiation (flattery or insincerity), conformity (every-
one else is doing it), and friendliness. Through these means the attacker attempts to convince
the victim that the attacker can be trusted.
Attackers use a variety of techniques in social engineering. An
attacker works to “push the envelope” just far enough when prob-
ing for information before the victim suspects anything unusual.
He generally will not ask for too much information at one time,
but instead will gather small amounts (even from several different
victims) in order to maintain the appearance of credibility. Also, the request from the attacker
needs to be believable. Slight flattery or flirtation can be helpful to soften up the victim to
cooperate. And a smile along with a simple question such as “I’m confused, can you please
help me?” often achieves the desired results.
One common form of social engineering is impersonation, which means to create a ficti-
tious character and then play out the role of that person on a victim. Common roles that
are often impersonated include a repairperson, IT support, a manager, a trusted third
party, or a fellow employee. For example, an attacker could impersonate a Help Desk sup-
port technician who calls the victim, pretends that there is a problem with the network,
and asks her for her password to reset an account. Sometimes attackers will impersonate
individuals whose roles are authoritative because victims generally resist saying “no” to
anyone in power.
Another common form of social engineering is phishing. Phishing is sending an e-mail
or displaying a Web announcement that falsely claims to be from a legitimate sender in an
attempt to trick the user into surrendering private information. Users are asked to respond

to an e-mail or are directed to a Web site where they are requested to update personal infor-
mation, such as passwords, credit card numbers, Social Security numbers, bank account
numbers, or other information. However, the Web site is actually an imposter site and is
set up to steal what information the user enters.
The word phishing is a variation on the word “fishing,” with the
idea being that bait is thrown out knowing that while most will
ignore it, some will “bite.”
One of the reasons that phishing succeeds is that the e-mails and the fake Web sites appear
to be legitimate. Figure 11-2 illustrates a Web site used in phishing. These messages contain
the logos, color schemes, and wording used by the legitimate site so that it is difficult to
determine that they are fraudulent.

The average phishing site only exists for 3.8 days to prevent law
enforcement agencies from tracking the attackers. In that short
period, a phishing attack can net over $50,000.ii
Defenses Against Attacks
There are several defenses against these and other types of attacks. They include using
security policies, conducting effective security training for users, and implementing physical secu-
rity procedures.
Security Policy One means of reducing risks is through a security policy. It is important
to know what a security policy is, the security policy cycle and types of policies, and how to
implement a security policy.
Definition of Security Policy At its core, a security policy is a document that outlines
the protections that should be enacted to ensure that the organization’s assets face minimal
risks. At one level, a security policy can be viewed as a set of management statements that
defines an organization’s philosophy of how to safeguard its information. At a more techni-
cal and detailed level, a security policy can be seen as the rules for computer access combined
with detailed plans for carrying them out. In short, a security policy is a written document
that states how an organization plans to protect the company’s information technology
assets.
There are several terms used to describe the rules that a user follows
in an organization. A standard is a collection of requirements specific
to the system or procedure that must be met by everyone. For exam-
ple, a standard might describe how to secure a computer at home
that remotely connects to the organization’s network. A guideline is
a collection of suggestions that should be implemented. A policy is a document that outlines
specific requirements or rules that must be met. A policy is considered the correct tool for an
organization to use when it is establishing security. This is because a policy applies to a wide
range of hardware or software (and is not a standard) and a policy is required (it is not just a
guideline).
An organization’s information security policy can serve several functions:
●
It can describe an overall intention and direction, formally expressed by the organiza-
tion’s management. A security policy is a vehicle for communicating an organization’s
information security culture and acceptable information security behavior.
●
It details specific risks and explains how to address them, and provides controls that
executives can use to direct employee behavior.
●
It can help to instill security awareness in the organization’s culture.
●
It can help to ensure that employee behavior is directed and monitored to ensure com-
pliance with security requirements.
The Security Policy Cycle Most organizations follow a three-phase cycle in the develop-
ment and maintenance of a security policy. The first phase involves a vulnerability assessment

11
(also called an impact analysis), which is a systematic evaluation of the exposure of assets to
attackers, forces of nature, or any other entity that is a potential harm. Vulnerability assess-
ment attempts to identify what needs to be protected (asset identification), what the pressures
are against it (threat evaluation), how susceptible the current protection is (vulnerability apprai-
sal), what damages could result from the threats (risk assessment), and what to do about it
(risk mitigation). The assessment includes:
1. Asset identification. Asset identification determines the items that have a positive
economic value and may include data, hardware, personnel, physical assets, and soft-
ware. Along with the assets, the attributes of the assets need to be compiled and their
relative value. The task of identifying and categorizing assets is known as asset
management.
2. Threat evaluation. After the assets have been inventoried and given a relative value, the
next step is to determine the threats from threat agents. A threat agent is any person or
thing with the power to carry out a threat against an asset.
3. Vulnerability appraisal. After the assets have been inventoried and prioritized, and the
threats have been determined, the next question is to determine what current security
weaknesses might expose the assets to these threats. This is known as vulnerability
appraisal and in effect takes a snapshot of the security of the organization as it now
stands.
4. Risk assessment. A risk assessment involves determining the damage that would result
from an attack and the likelihood that the vulnerability is a risk to the organization.
5. Risk mitigation. Once the risks are determined and ranked, the final step is to determine
what to do about the risks. It is important to recognize that security weaknesses can
never be entirely eliminated; some degree of risk must always be assumed.
The second phase of the security policy cycle is to use the information from the vulnerability
assessment study to create the policy. A security policy is a document or series of documents
that clearly defines the defense mechanisms an organization will employ to keep information
secure. It also outlines how the organization will respond to attacks and the duties and
responsibilities of its employees for information security.
The final phase is to review the policy for compliance. Because new assets are added
continually to an organization, and because new threats can also arise against assets con-
tinually, compliance monitoring and evaluation must be conducted regularly. When the
results of the monitoring and evaluation phase identifies new assets to be protected or new
risks to be addressed, the cycle begins over again. The security policy cycle is illustrated in
Figure 11-3.
The security policy cycle is a never-ending process of identifying what
needs to be protected, determining how to protect it, and evaluating
the protection.
Types of Security Policies Because a security policy is so comprehensive and is often
detailed, most organizations choose to break their security policies down into smaller subpo-
licies that can easily be referenced. The term security policy then becomes an umbrella term
for all of the subpolicies included within it.

There are a number of different types of security policies. An acceptable use policy (AUP)
defines the actions users may perform while accessing systems and networking equipment.
The users are not limited to employees; it can also include vendors, contractors, or visitors,
each with different privileges. AUPs typically cover all computer use, including Internet, e-mail,
Web, and password security.
An AUP may include an overview regarding what is covered by this policy. For example, an
AUP might include the following:
Internet/intranet/extranet-related systems, including but not limited to computer
equipment, software, operating systems, storage media, network accounts provid-
ing electronic mail, Web browsing, and FTP, are the property of Organization A.
These systems are to be used for business purposes in serving the interests of the
company, and of our clients and customers in the course of normal operations.
The AUP usually provides explicit prohibitions regarding security and proprietary information:
Keep passwords secure and do not share accounts. Authorized users are respon-
sible for the security of their passwords and accounts. System level passwords
should be changed every 30 days; user level passwords should be changed
every 45 days.
All computers and laptops should be secured with a password-protected screensaver
with the automatic activation feature set at 10 minutes or less, or by logging off
when the host is unattended.
Postings by employees from an Organization A e-mail address to newsgroups
should contain a disclaimer stating that the opinions expressed are strictly their
own and not necessarily those of Organization A, unless posting is in the course
of business duties.
Unacceptable use may also be outlined by the AUP, as in the following example:
The following actions are not acceptable ways to use the system:
1. Introduction of malicious programs into the network or server.
2. Revealing your account password to others or allowing use of your account
by others. This includes family and other household members when work is
being done at home.

3. Using an Organization A computing asset to actively engage in procuring or
transmitting material that is in violation of sexual harassment or hostile
workplace laws in the user’s local jurisdiction.
4. Any form of harassment via e-mail, telephone or paging, whether through
language, frequency, or size of messages.
5. Unauthorized use, or forging, of e-mail header information.
Another typical policy manages passwords. Although passwords often form the weakest link in
information security, they are still the most widely used form of authentication. A password pol-
icy should clearly address how passwords are created and managed. In addition to requiring con-
trols implemented through technology (such as setting passwords to expire after 90 days and not
allowing them to be recycled), a password policy should remind users how to select and use pass-
words. For example, it could list the characteristics of weak passwords, as shown in Figure 11-4.
The policy should also specify what makes up a strong password, as shown in Figure 11-5.
Many organizations also have a wireless policy. This policy specifies the conditions that wire-
less devices must satisfy in order to connect to the organization’s network. Generally all
employees, contractors, consultants, temporary and other workers, including any personnel
that are affiliated with third parties working on behalf of the organization, are required to
follow the policy. The wireless policy applies to all wireless mobile devices that connect
to the company’s WLAN and usually require the following:
●
Any wireless device must be installed, supported, and maintained by the approved IT
support team.
Strong Passwords Have the Following Characteristics
●
Contain both uppercase and lowercase characters (a-z, A-Z)
●
Have digits and punctuation characters as well as letters (0-9, !@#$%^& *()_+={}[])
●
Are at least 12 characters long
●
Are not words in any language, slang, dialect, or jargon

Balancing Trust and Control An effective security policy must carefully balance two
key elements: trust and control. First, consider the issue of trust. There are three approaches
to trust:
1. Trust everyone all of the time. This is the easiest model to enforce because there are no
restrictions. However, this is impractical because it leaves systems vulnerable to attack.
2. Trust no one at any time. This model is the most restrictive, but is also impractical. Few
individuals would work for an organization that did not trust its employees.
3. Trust some people some of the time. This approach exercises caution in the amount of
trust given. Access is provided as needed with technical controls to ensure the trust is
not violated.
The approach of trusting no one at any time is mostly found in high-
security government organizations.
A security policy attempts to provide the right amount of trust by balancing no trust and too
much trust. It does this by trusting some of the people some of the time and by building trust
over time. Deciding on the level of trust may be a delicate matter; too much trust may lead to
security problems, while too little trust may make it difficult to find and keep good employees.
Control must also be balanced. Although one of the goals of a security policy is to implement
control, deciding on the correct level of that control for a specific policy is not always easy. If
policies are too restrictive or too hard to implement and comply with, employees will either
ignore them or find a way to circumvent the controls. The security needs and the culture of
the organization play a major role when deciding what level of control is appropriate.
Because security policies are a balancing act between trust and control, not all users have
positive attitudes toward security policies. Users sometimes view security policies as a barrier
to their productivity, a way to control their behavior, or requirements that will be difficult to
follow and implement. This is particularly true if in the past policies did not exist or were
loosely enforced. This makes it necessary to ensure that security policies are properly enforced
for all users. There should be steps in place for monitoring compliance through auditing proce-
dures, making the necessary responses when a policy is violated, and reporting any incidents.
The purpose of security policies is not to serve as a motivational
tool to force users to practice safe security techniques. The results
from research have indicated that the specific elements of a security
policy do not have an impact on user behavior. Relying on a
security policy as the exclusive defense mechanism will not provide
adequate security for an organization.

Awareness and Training Another of the key defenses in security is to train users to
be aware of security issues and to follow all necessary security procedures. All computer
users in an organization have a shared responsibility to protect the organization’s assets.
But it cannot be assumed that all users have the knowledge and skill to protect these
assets. Users need training in the importance of securing information, the roles that they
play in security, and the steps they need to take to prevent attacks. And because new attacks
arise regularly, and new security vulnerabilities are continually being exposed, user aware-
ness and training must be ongoing. User awareness is an essential element of security.
All users need continuous training in new security defenses and regular reminders of company
security policies and procedures. Opportunities for security education and training can occur:
1. When a new employee is hired
2. After a computer attack has occurred
3. When an employee is promoted or given new responsibilities
4. During an annual departmental retreat
5. When new user software is installed
6. When user hardware is upgraded
Education in an enterprise is not limited to a certain group of
employees. Human resource personnel also need to keep abreast
of security issues, because in many organizations it is their role to
train new employees on all aspects of the organization, including
security. Even upper management needs to be aware of the security
threats and attacks that the organization faces, if only to acknowledge the necessity of
security in planning, staffing, and budgeting.
One of the challenges of organizational education and training is to understand the traits of
learners. Table 11-1 lists general traits of individuals born in the United States since 1946.
Training styles also impact how people learn. A style that works for one person may not be
the best for everyone. Most people are taught using a pedagogical approach (from a Greek
word meaning to lead a child). However, for adult learners, an andragogical approach (the
art of helping an adult learn) is often preferred. Some of the differences between pedagogical
and andragogical approaches are summarized in Table 11-2.
It is also important to be mindful of different learning styles. Visual learners learn through
taking notes, being at the front of the class, and watching presentations. Auditory learners

tend to sit in the middle of the class and learn best through lectures and discussions. The
third style, kinesthetic, is common among information technology professionals. These
students learn through a lab environment or other hands-on approaches. Most people use a
combination of learning styles, with one style being dominant.
To aid in knowledge retention, trainers should incorporate all three
learning styles and present the same information using different
techniques. For example, a course could include a lecture, PowerPoint
slides, and an opportunity to work directly with software and replicate
what is being taught.
Physical Security One of the most important aspects of security is also the most obvi-
ous: securing the devices themselves, such as APs, so that unauthorized users are prohibited
from gaining physical access to the equipment. Although securing devices seems obvious, in
practice it can be overlooked because so much attention is focused on preventing attackers
from reaching a computer electronically. However, ensuring that devices—and the data
stored on those devices—cannot be reached physically is equally important. Physical security
involves restricting access to the areas in which equipment is located. This includes hard-
ware locks, video surveillance, fencing, and cable locks.
Door Locks Hardware door locks in residences generally fall in four categories. Most resi-
dences have keyed entry locks (use a key to open the lock from the outside), privacy locks
(lock the door but have access to unlock from the outside via a small hole; typically used on
bedroom and bathroom doors), patio locks (lock the door from the inside but cannot be
unlocked from the outside), and passage locks (latch a door closed yet do not lock; typically
used on hall and closet doors). The standard keyed entry lock, shown in Figure 11-6, is the
most common type of door lock for keeping out intruders, but its security is minimal. Because
it does not automatically lock when the door is closed, a user may mistakenly think they are
locking a door by closing it when they are not. Also a thin piece of plastic such as a credit card
can sometimes be wedged between the lock and the door casing to open it; or the knob itself
can be broken off with a sharp blow, such as by a hammer, and then the door can be opened.
Door locks in commercial buildings are different from residential door locks. For rooms that
require enhanced security, a lever coupled with a deadbolt lock is common. This lock
extends a solid metal bar into the door frame for extra security as shown in Figure 11-7.

Deadbolt locks are much more difficult to defeat than keyed entry locks. The lock cannot be
broken from the outside like a preset lock, and the extension of the bar prevents a credit card
from being inserted to open it. Deadbolt locks can also require that a key be used to both
open and lock the door.
The categories of commercial door locks include storeroom (the out-
side is always locked, entry is by key only, and the inside lever is
always unlocked), classroom (the outside can be locked or unlocked,
and the inside lever is always unlocked), store entry double cylinder
(includes a keyed cylinder in both the outside and inside knobs so
that a key in either knob locks or unlocks both at the same time), and communicating double
cylinder lock (includes a keyed cylinder in both outside and inside knobs and the key unlocks
its own knob independently).

Video Surveillance Monitoring activity with a video camera can also provide a degree of
security. Using video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific and limited set of receivers is
called closed circuit television (CCTV). CCTV is frequently used for surveillance in areas
that require security monitoring such as banks, casinos, airports, and military installations.
Some CCTV cameras are fixed in a single position pointed at a door or a hallway. Other
cameras resemble a small dome and allow the security technician to move the camera 360
degrees for a full panoramic view. High-end video surveillance cameras are motion-tracking
and will automatically follow any movement.
Fencing Securing a restricted area by erecting a barrier, called fencing, can be an effective
method for maintaining security. However, standard chain link fencing offers limited security
because it can easily be circumvented by climbing over it or cutting the links. Most modern
perimeter security consists of a fence equipped with other deterrents such as those listed in
Table 11-3.
Cable Locks For wireless mobile devices, such as portable laptops, netbooks, and tablet
devices, it is important to protect them from being stolen. Most portable devices (as well as
many expensive computer monitors) have a special steel bracket security slot built into the
case. A cable lock can be inserted into the security slot of a portable device and rotated so
that the cable lock is secured to the device, while a cable connected to the lock can then
be secured to a desk or chair. A cable lock is illustrated in Figure 11-8.
Software can be installed on a mobile device to identify the
device’s location in the event that it is stolen. While hiding itself
from the attackers, this software can report back the internal IP
address, external IP address, nearby routers, and the name of the
wireless AP that the device is connected to. Any devices that
have built-in Web cams can also be instructed to take pictures, presumably of the thief.

Monitoring the Wireless Network
It is difficult to manage a network without monitoring what is occurring on the network. Net-
work monitoring provides valuable data regarding the current state of the network. This data
can be used to establish a baseline of network performance and can also reveal emerging net-
work problems. Monitoring a wireless network can best be performed with two sets of tools:
utilities designed specifically for WLANs and standard networking monitoring tools.
WLAN Monitoring Tools
Virtually all operating systems and many WLAN vendors provide utilities to assist in moni-
toring the wireless network. However, the level of information provided by these tools can
vary dramatically, with some tools providing only rudimentary information while others
give more detailed statistics. The WLAN monitoring tools can be classified as those that
operate on the wireless device itself and those that function on the AP.
Mobile Device Utilities Operating systems provide basic tools for monitoring the cur-
rent status of the mobile wireless device. Figure 11-9 illustrates the Windows 7 Wireless
Network Connection Status window, which shows the signal quality and the number of
bytes sent and received over the WLAN. Yet this provides little useable information for a
WLAN technician regarding the device.
Some vendors provide supplemental device utilities that give more detailed information.
Figure 11-10 shows a utility that provides the number of bytes sent and received grouped
by transmission speed. However, this information only covers the wireless device itself and
provides no status of the overall wireless network.
Access Point Utilities All APs include the ability to provide information about the
status of the wireless LAN. Most enterprise-level APs provide three types of information.

The first is a record of events (usually called an event log), such as devices associating with
the AP. The second type of information is statistics on wireless transmissions, as shown in
Figure 11-11. The final type of information regards the connection to the wired network,
which is illustrated in Figure 11-12.

Another type of log that is important when maintaining a WLAN is
a manual log that contains a record all of the activities, problems,
solutions, and configuration changes. Wireless system administrators
should develop the habit of keeping a regular technical “diary” of
the system.
Standard Network Monitoring Tools
Although data from devices and APs are beneficial, there are drawbacks to relying solely on
these sources of information:
●
Data collection. Acquiring data from each AP and each wireless device across the
network can be a labor- and time-intensive task.
●
Timeliness. Unless a person is constantly monitoring this data, it cannot be used to
warn of an impending wireless issue. Rather, the data can only be used after a problem
occurs when trying to identify what may have caused it.
●
Retention of data. Data gathered from the AP and devices is collected in real
time but often there is not always the facility for creating a large repository
for that data. Without the ability to retain the data it is difficult to establish a
baseline.
A supplement to WLAN monitoring tools are the standard network monitoring tools. The
two tools often used are Simple Network Management Protocol and Remote Network
Monitoring.
Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) One of the most common
software tools used for monitoring a network, wired or wireless, is the Simple Network
Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP is a protocol that allows computers and network
equipment to gather data about network performance and is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite.
The security vulnerabilities of SNMP are covered in Chapter 10.
In order to use SNMP, a software agent is loaded onto each network device that will be
managed using SNMP. Each agent monitors network traffic and stores that information in
its management information base (MIB). In addition, a computer with the SNMP manage-
ment software, known as the SNMP management station, must also be on the network.
The SNMP configuration is shown in Figure 11-13.
The SNMP management station communicates with the software agents on each net-
work device and collects the data stored in the MIBs. It then combines all of the data
and produces statistics about the network. This data includes transmission or connectiv-
ity errors, the number of bytes or data packets sent, and information on IP activity and
addressing.
An SNMP alarm can be set using the network statistics. Whenever the network exceeds a
predefined limit, it triggers an alert message, called an SNMP trap, which is sent to the man-
agement station. The management station then queries all stations for details of that specific

event, including when and where the event took place and the current status of that network
node. An SNMP trap for a wireless network is illustrated in Figure 11-14.
Remote Network Monitoring (RMON) One of the limitations of SNMP is that the
devices using SNMP, such as APs and routers, are called upon for dual duty: not only must

they perform their regular tasks but they must at the same time monitor the network status. This
may place a heavy load upon devices. An alternative is to install dedicated hardware devices that
do nothing but gather network statistics and watch for events to occur while still using SNMP.
Remote Network Monitoring (RMON) is an SNMP-based tool that monitors networks
using dedicated hardware devices. However, RMON is not a separate TCP/IP protocol;
instead, it is part of SNMP. RMON uses SNMP but also incorporates a special database
for remote monitoring that includes different groups of statistics. RMON at its core is
simply a MIB module that defines a set of objects that are used by the hardware probes
that permit advanced network management capabilities.
RMON is actually one of many MIP modules that can make up the
SNMP framework.
In a WLAN, the AP can be monitored using RMON. The statistics gathered can contain
data measured for both the wired LAN and the wireless LAN interfaces. It can also compare
these statistical samples to previously configured thresholds. If the monitored variable
crosses a threshold, an event alarm can be generated.
Like SNMP, RMON capabilities are only found on enterprise-level APs.
Maintaining the Wireless Network
A wireless network is anything but a static system. Instead, it requires continual modifications,
adjustments, and “tweaks.” Often these are the result of feedback from monitoring the
network. Although wireless network maintenance can cover many different functions, two
important functions are to upgrade the AP firmware and perform RF site tuning.
Upgrade Firmware
Firmware, or software that is embedded into hardware to control the device, is the electronic
brains of a hardware device. Coded instructions relating to the functions of the device such
as data processing algorithms are embedded as integral portions of the internal circuitry. The
circuitry on which the firmware resides is EEPROM, or Electrically-Erasable Programmable
Read-Only Memory. EEPROM is a nonvolatile storage chip used in computers and other
devices. An EEPROM chip can be programmed and erased multiple times electrically.
Although EEPROM may be erased and reprogrammed only a certain number of times
(ranging from 100,000 to 1,000,000) it can be read an unlimited number of times.
Flash memory typically found in portable USB devices is a later form
of EEPROM. EEPROMs are byte-wise writable memories, compared to
block-wise writable flash memories. EEPROM chips are larger than flash
memory for the same capacity because each EEPROM cell usually needs
both a read and a write transistor where flash memory needs only one.

11
Virtually all APs use a browser-based management system. The AP settings are contained on
HTML-based Web pages stored in the AP that are accessed with a browser on a client
device. Unlike Web pages found on the Internet, the AP Web pages are not stored on a file
server that can be changed by modifying the HTML code. Instead, the AP Web pages are
stored on the AP as firmware in EEPROM circuitry.
As WLAN vendors continue to make improvements and modifications to their AP products,
users can keep these devices current with the latest changes by downloading the changes to
the APs. Vendors regularly post firmware upgrades on their Internet sites. Updating AP firm-
ware generally involves downloading the firmware from vendor’s Web site, selecting the
“Upgrade Firmware” or similar option on the AP, and then launching the update. On some
older APs the firmware update is a separate file that is downloaded and then the file is
located and executed, as shown in Figure 11-15. Most modern APs transparently download
the update and then automatically install it.
It is important that the process not be interrupted when a firmware
upgrade is taking place. A loss of electrical power may stop the
upgrade and make the device unusable.
Enterprise-level APs often have enhanced firmware upgrade capabilities. For example, some APs
have three different categories of firmware: system firmware, Web page firmware, and radio firm-
ware, as seen in Figure 11-16. These can be upgraded separately if necessary in order to keep all
of the APs running the same configuration until a system-wide upgrade can be performed.
Another feature of enterprise-level APs is the ability to distribute upgrades locally. Once a
single AP has been upgraded to the latest firmware, this firmware can then be easily distrib-
uted to all other APs on the WLAN. The upgraded AP (distribution AP) sends out the update

to all other APs (receiving APs) on the network. Each receiving AP must be configured as
follows:
1. The receiving AP must be able to hear the IP multicast issued by the distribution AP.
Some network devices such as routers can block multicast messages. This blocking
feature must be temporarily turned off at the router.
2. The receiving AP must be set to allow access through a Web browser.
3. If the receiving AP has specific security capabilities enabled, it must contain in its approved
user lists a user with the same user name, password, and capabilities as the user who is
logged into the distribution AP.
Once the distribution AP has been updated and the receiving APs are correctly configured,
the new firmware update can be “pushed” out to all APs on the wireless network. Each AP
will automatically reboot after the firmware has been distributed.
RF Site Tuning
Once an AP’s firmware has been upgraded, several settings may require adjustment as part
of routine maintenance. Sometimes known as RF site tuning, the process of adjusting these
settings is similar to conducting some of the steps of a site survey. However, instead of
attempting to locate where APs should be mounted, the point of RF site tuning is to readjust
the settings of the AP. Important RF site tuning settings include:
●
Adjust radio power levels on all APs. Because firmware upgrades may increase the RF
coverage areas, it may be necessary to readdress the power settings on all APs.

●
Adjust channel settings. It may be necessary to restore the channel settings to their orig-
inal configuration. Once the original channel plan is restored, channels may be adjusted
based on adjacent channels, cellular overlap, and adjusted radio power settings.
●
Validate coverage area. As a part of the RF site tuning, it is important to redetermine the
perimeter of each APs RF coverage area. Each AP should be measured independently
of all other APs and then the overall coverage of the WLAN should be measured. During
this process additional configuration adjustments may be required on different APs.
●
Modify integrity and throughput. Once the RF coverage cells have been determined,
throughput rates and proper cellular overlap may need to be determined and adjusted.
●
Document changes. Any changes should be clearly documented. The edited entries
should include channel selection, power settings, firmware version, and modulation
corrections. Additionally, maps should be created that offer a visual representation of
the RF coverage cells and AP placement.
Documentation should be available in both electronic format and
hard copy.
Chapter Summary
■The technical aspects of securing a wireless network are important, but security defenses
go beyond technical solutions. They also involve implementing the correct security
procedures within the organization. One of the first steps in implementing procedural
security defenses is to manage risk, which is the likelihood that a threat agent will
exploit a vulnerability. Risk can never be entirely eliminated; it would cost too much
and take too long. Rather, some degree of risk must always be assumed. There are three
options when dealing with risks: accept the risk, diminish the risk, or transfer the risk.
■One of the greatest risks that organizations face today are social engineering attacks.
Social engineering is a means of launching an attack or gathering information for an
attack by relying on the weaknesses of individuals. It relies on an attacker’s clever
manipulation of human nature in order to persuade the victim to provide information
or take actions. One common form of social engineering is impersonation, which
means to create a fictitious character and then play out the role of that person on a
victim. Another common form of social engineering is phishing, or sending an e-mail
or displaying a Web announcement that falsely claims to be from a legitimate sender
in an attempt to trick the user into surrendering private information.
■There are several defenses against these attacks. One means of reducing risks is through a
security policy. A security policy is a written document that states how an organization
plans to protect the company’s information technology assets. An organization’s informa-
tion security policy can serve several functions. Most organizations follow a three-phase
cycle in the development and maintenance of a security policy. The first phase involves a
vulnerability assessment, which is a systematic and methodical evaluation of the exposure
of assets to any entity that is a potential harm. The second phase of the security policy
cycle is to use the information from the vulnerability assessment study to create the policy.
The final phase is to review the policy for compliance. There are a number of different

types of security policies. An acceptable use policy (AUP) defines the actions users may
perform while accessing systems and networking equipment. A password policy can
clearly address how passwords are created and managed. A wireless policy specifies the
conditions that wireless devices must satisfy in order to connect to the organization’s net-
work. It necessary to ensure that security policies are properly enforced for all users. There
should be steps in place for monitoring compliance through auditing procedures, making
the necessary responses when a policy is violated, and reporting any incidents.
■Another defense is to provide training that encourages users to be aware of security issues
and procedures. All computer users in an organization have a shared responsibility to
protect the assets of the organization, but it cannot be assumed that all users have the
knowledge and skill to protect these assets. Users need training in the importance of
securing information, the roles that they play in security, and the steps they need to take to
prevent attacks. And because new attacks arise regularly, this training must be ongoing.
■Securing the devices themselves, such as APs, so that unauthorized users are prohibited
from gaining physical access to the equipment is an important security procedure.
Door locks in commercial buildings are typically different from residential door locks.
For rooms that require enhanced security, a lever coupled with a deadbolt lock is
common. This lock extends a solid metal bar into the door frame for extra security.
Monitoring activity with a video camera can also provide a degree of security. Using
video cameras to transmit a signal to a specific and limited set of receivers is called
closed circuit television (CCTV). Securing a restricted area by erecting a barrier, called
fencing, can be an effective method for maintaining security. Most modern perimeter
security consists of a fence equipped with other deterrents. Most portable devices have a
special steel bracket security slot built into the case. A cable lock can be inserted into the
security slot of a portable device and rotated so that the cable lock is secured to the
device, while a cable connected to the lock can then be secured to a desk or chair.
■Network monitoring provides valuable data regarding the current state of the network.
This data can be used to establish a baseline of network performance and can also reveal
emerging network problems. Virtually all operating systems and many WLAN vendors
provide utilities to assist in monitoring the wireless network. However, the level of infor-
mation provided by these tools can vary dramatically, with some tools providing only
rudimentary data while others give more detailed statistics. Most enterprise-level APs
provide detailed data such as a record of events, statistics on wireless transmissions, and
information regards the connection to the wired network. Although data from the devices
and AP are beneficial, there are drawbacks to relying solely on these sources of informa-
tion. A supplement to WLAN monitoring tools are the standard network monitoring
tools. One of the most common software tools used for monitoring a network, wired or
wireless, is the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP). SNMP is a protocol that
allows computers and network equipment to gather data about network performance and
is part of the TCP/IP protocol suite. Remote Network Monitoring (RMON) is an SNMP-
based tool that monitors networks using dedicated hardware devices.
■A WLAN requires continual modifications. Virtually all APs rely on a browser-based
management system in which HTML-based Web pages stored in the AP are accessed
with a browser on a client device. These AP Web pages are stored on the AP as
firmware in EEPROM circuitry. Vendors regularly post firmware upgrades on their
Internet sites. Enterprise-level APs often have enhanced firmware upgrade capabilities.
Once an AP’s firmware has been upgraded, several settings may require adjustment

Troubleshooting and diagnosing problems on a wireless LAN is necessary to keep the
network operating at peak efficiency. In a recent turnaround, however, WLANs
themselves are now being used to diagnose problems on other types of devices, as
well as to maintain and monitor these devices.
LG Electronics (LG) recently introduced a range of smart household appliances
using LG THINQ™Technology, which is composed of several elements, including
Smart Grid, Smart Diagnosis™, Smart Access, and Smart Adapt. This technology
is designed to provide a means by which consumers can manage their homes in a
more centralized and convenient way. WLANs are at the core of LG THINQ™Technol-
ogy: all of the smart appliances can communicate with the homeowner’s wireless
router. This opens the door for several new features.
Smart Grid uses a smart electric meter to ensure that household appliances use the
minimum amount of energy at the least expensive rates. When using a washing
machine with Smart Grid technology occupants are given the choice of using Recom-
mend Time (which automatically starts the washing at the next most cost-effective
time) or Lowest Rate (which turns on the washer when the electricity rates are at
their lowest). Users can also override the Smart Grid and wash clothes immediately
(although the washing machine will recommend the most energy-efficient cycle).
Additional uses for Smart Grid include adjusting the power used by other appliances
such as ovens (taking into account the duration of the cooking cycle and varying
costs of electricity) and refrigerators (adjusting functions such as defrost time and
even displaying the frequency at which the refrigerator door has been opened and
closed). And an LCD display on the smart appliance shows daily, weekly, or monthly
reports detailing the appliance’s overall levels of energy consumption and associated
costs, while daily totals for electricity usage can be accessed via a smartphone or
tablet PC over the wireless network. This is all done using a WLAN. For any minor
problems, such as a refrigerator door that has been left open, an ice-maker that is
turned off, or a washing machine that is off-balance, the appliance alerts the owner
with a message on its display panel as well by as sending a message through the
WLAN. This alert is then displayed on the consumer’s smartphone or tablet PC.
Of course, there is a downside to all these features. As appliances gain more
advanced features, more problems can arise, such as a faulty display or a defective
sensor. The usual course of action is to contact the appliance’s customer service repre-
sentative, schedule a service call by a repair technician, and then wait for him to arrive
in order to diagnose and repair the unit. Then, if a part must be ordered, yet another
service call is required, and during the meantime the consumer cannot use the appliance.
However, the Smart Diagnosis™feature helps customer service representatives speed

Even though you’ve spent weeks or months designing and installing a wireless LAN, it is
inevitable that something will go wrong and must be fixed. Finding the problem and
correcting it—a process known as troubleshooting—is sometimes difficult on a WLAN due
to the nature of radio frequency (RF) communications. Troubleshooting often involves a
systematic approach along with a good “sixth sense” that is honed by experience. Thus, it is
important that wireless network administrators and technicians develop good wireless trouble-
shooting skills.
Equally important is the ability to optimize a wireless network so that it works in top form.
It’s the rare WLAN that, once configured, requires no future changes. Instead, wireless
networks should continually be optimized to fit its users’ changing needs.
In this chapter you will first learn how to troubleshoot WLANs by locating and correct
wireless network problems. Next, you will explore the various ways in which a WLAN
can be optimized for peak performance.
Troubleshooting a Wireless Network
C W N A
4.2.1. Identify and explain how to solve WLAN implementation chal-
lenges using features available in enterprise class WLAN equipment.
The first step in troubleshooting a WLAN is to identify the source of the problem. The many
WLAN problem sources can be grouped into three categories: RF interference, WLAN
configuration settings, and problems related to the wireless device itself.
up the repair process by troubleshooting mechanical issues over the phone, thus possibly
limiting or even eliminating service calls. The homeowner can telephone a customer ser-
vice center, where a technician might instruct him to press a sequence of buttons on the
appliance. This triggers a series of tones that lets the technician identify the issue and
determine how to correct the problem. Consumers can also diagnose appliances at
home using a smartphone application. If a service visit is required, the field repairperson
can arrive with the correct parts, ensuring that a repair is resolved in a single visit.
Because all of the devices are connected through the WLAN, Smart Access makes
it possible for homeowners to also control appliances remotely. Using a smartphone or
tablet PC, a user can manage a washing cycle from the office or change his refrigerator
temperature while out of town. Alert messages can be sent back to the user at the
end of a washing cycle or when a potential issue arises. The Smart Adapt feature allows
consumers to download the latest services and technology upgrades for their appli-
ances through the WLAN connection. Consumers then can access new preprogrammed
instruction sets, as well as updated advanced cycles for washing machines, allowing
them to take advantage of these new features without upgrading to new appliances.

RF Interference
One of the main sources of WLAN problems is RF interference. This interference can be a
result of external interference or intersymbol interference.
External Interference Many different objects produce unintended and unwanted RF
signals that can interfere with a WLAN transmission. Electromagnetic interference (EMI)
is an electronic disturbance, either man-made or natural, which causes an undesirable
degrading in the performance of electrical equipment. Virtually all electronic devices give
off some type of electromagnetic emission as a byproduct of an electrical or magnetic
activity. For example, something as simple as the motor in a refrigerator can create EMI
that impacts the picture quality on a television. Radio frequency interference (RFI), on the
other hand, is any undesirable electrical energy emitted within the frequency range dedicated
to RF transmissions.
These unwanted RF signals are called noise. The noise floor is a measure of the total noise
from different systems. The noise floor indicates the weakest signal that can be received.
For example, if Alice were to stand two feet away from Bob in a quiet room and whisper to
him, Bob would normally be able to hear what she says because the total level of unwanted
noise (noise floor) would be very low. However, if Alice were to stand two feet away from
Bob on an airport tarmac and whisper while an airplane takes off, it is unlikely that Bob
could hear Alice because the noise floor would be much higher. The graph in Figure 12-1
shows a noise floor and indicates that any signal must exceed approximately 125 dB in
order to be effective.

A spectrum analyzer is a device that scans the RF spectrum and that can
locate RFI that causes a high noise floor. Spectrum analyzers usually
display the raw and unprocessed signal information such as frequency,
voltage, power, period, and the shape of the RF “wave.” The most
common spectrum analyzer measurements are modulation, distortion,
and noise. Spectrum analyzers are covered in Chapter 8.
There are four categories of external noise interference on a WLAN: narrowband interference,
wideband interference, all-band interference, and weather interference.
Narrowband Interference Narrowband interference is usually generated by television,
radio, and satellite transmitters. This signal, as its name implies, impacts only a narrow por-
tion of the spectrum, leaving most of the band (such as the entire 2.4-GHz band) unaffected.
Whereas some types of RF interference are only occasional or sporadic (called intermittent),
generally narrowband interference is continual (constant). This is because its source is coming
from a transmitter that is continuously sending out a signal. Narrowband interference is
often from a signal that is so strong it completely disrupts all communication.
The troubleshooting solution for narrowband interference in a WLAN is to use a spectrum
analyzer to determine the affected WLAN channel(s), which all operate at a different
frequency. Because narrowband only significantly impacts a narrow portion of the spectrum,
often an alternative channel (frequency) can be chosen on which to transmit. Figure 12-2
illustrates narrowband interference on an IEEE 802.11b/g WLAN. Because the interference
is centered on channel 6, the solution is to change the channel to either 1 or 11.
Wideband Interference Unlike narrowband interference that only impacts a small
portion of the spectrum, wideband interference affects the entire frequency band, such as the
entire 2.4-GHz band. Because the entire band is impacted changing to an alternative channel
is not a solution. Instead, the only mitigation is to locate the source of the interfering signal
and remove it.

All-band Interference Instead of transmitting on just one frequency, frequency-hopping
spread spectrum (FHSS) uses a range of frequencies that change during the transmission.
With FHSS, a short burst is transmitted at one frequency, then a short burst is transmitted
at another frequency, and so on, until the entire transmission is completed. Competing tech-
nologies that use FHSS to “hop” across the spectrum, such as 2.4 GHz, can create all-band
interference (it covers all bands of the RF spectrum) with IEEE 802.11 WLANs.
Several solutions have been proposed for these two technologies to work together. These
include:
●
Change the RF spectrum used. A change to rules governing the frequency spectrum
would require the FHSS technology to hop over only part of the band, leaving the
other part clear for WLANs.
●
Modify power levels. Because FHSS devices transmit typically over short distances,
lowering or using variable power would lessen the interference impact on WLANs.
●
Add switching software. Software could be installed that allows a device with both
WLAN and FHSS installed to switch between the two modes. However, both devices
could not transmit simultaneously.
●
Change the MAC layer. The media access control (MAC) layer is an attractive place
to focus attention on improving the coexistence between FHSS technologies and
WLANs because it is where such techniques as carrier sense multiple access/collision
avoidance (CSMA/CA) and data rates are determined. Although changes here would
be relatively inexpensive to implement, not all problems can be solved in the MAC
layer. For example, the MAC layer has no control over timing under some conditions,
such as when a WLAN device is required to respond with an ACK after successfully
receiving a packet.
●
Change PHY layer. Using special signal-processing techniques in the PHY layer can
permit the FHSS signal be sent at times when WLANs are silent. However, PHY-layer
techniques tend to directly affect system costs more than MAC-layer techniques.
None of these proposals have received widespread support and
all-band interference between FHSS devices and WLANs can be a
problem. The only solutions are to not use the two devices together
or migrate to a WLAN that uses another RF frequency spectrum,
such as moving from 802.11b/g (2.4 GHz) to 802.11a/n (5 GHz).
Weather Interference Weather can have an impact on wireless transmissions outdoors.
Over a long distance an RF signal may move through different atmospheric conditions. For
example, it may start out in a relatively transparent condition, such as in bright sunshine,
then go through a much denser condition, such as cold damp air. When an RF signal moves
from one medium to another of a different density the signal actually bends instead of traveling
in a straight line. This is known as refraction.
Refraction is covered in Chapter 3.

There is little that can be done regarding the impact of weather on RF interference.
In addition to affecting RF signals, severe weather can have other impacts
on wireless networks as well. For example, lightning can strike anten-
nas or other equipment, wind can shift antennas, and rain can impact
frayed cabling and loose connectors.
RF Interference Troubleshooting One of the most important steps in troubleshooting
RF interference is to understand the truths and myths regarding RF interference. Table 12-1
lists some of these truths and myths.
The following best practices should be considered in order to reduce RF interference:
●
Be wary of noise and recognize situations where noise may impact transmissions.
RF noise may come from many different sources, such as high frequency digital
products, forms of other radio communications, and even solar activity. In addition,
outdoor antennas are virtually everywhere, including the sides of buildings, water
towers, billboards, chimneys, church steeples, and even disguised as trees. Many
sources of interference may not be obvious.
Myth
Truth
“The only significant
interference problems are
from other IEEE 802.11
networks.”
While other 802.11 WLANs can cause network interference, the overwhelming
majority of RF interference is caused by other devices. These include microwave
ovens, cordless phones, FHSS devices, wireless video cameras, outdoor microwave
links, and wireless game controllers. In addition, these devices may cause other
problems that are difficult to detect, such as making the WLAN use lower data
transmission rates due to the interference.
“The network seems to be
working OK so there must
not be any RF interference.”
Because the IEEE 802.11 protocol is designed to resist interference to a degree,
it may not always be apparent that RF interference is impacting the network.
For example, when a wireless device senses an interference burst occurring
before it has started its own transmission, it will wait on transmitting until the
interference is finished. Yet if the interference burst starts in the middle of a
transmission, so that an acknowledgement packet is not received, it will cause
the transmitter to resend the entire packet. This can reduce the throughput of
a WLAN and can be difficult to diagnose.
“We already used a spectrum
analyzer and found all of the
sources of interference before
we installed the WLAN.”
Wideband and all-band RF interference is intermittent in nature, often
occurring only at certain times of day or on specific days of the week. And,
interference that was not present when the network was installed could now
be present.
“I can look for any RF
interference issues with my
free open-source packet
sniffer.”
A protocol analyzer captures packets to decode and analyze its contents and can
be used to detect and diagnose network problems such as addressing errors and
protocol configuration mistakes. However, they cannot detect RF interference.
A spectrum analyzer scans the RF spectrum (2.4 GHz or 5 GHz for WLANs) and
can locate potential sources of interference.
“There is no RF interference
at 5 GHz so we’ll install IEEE
802.11a/n WLANs to eliminate
any problems.”
While fewer devices currently operate at 5 GHz, this is beginning to change. Just as
new 2.4-GHz devices were introduced in order to avoid the interference problems
with 900 MHz, the same is happening with 5 GHz. Some devices that already exist at
5 GHz include cordless phones, radar, perimeter sensors, and digital satellite devices.

●
Maintain a system operating margin. The system operating margin (SOM, also called
the fade margin) is the difference measured in decibels between the received signal level
and the signal level that is required by that radio to assure the transmission can be
decoded without errors. SOM is the difference between the signal received and the
radio’s specified receiver sensitivity. For outdoor transmissions a SOM of no less than
10 dB in good weather conditions will protect against weather and other RF interference.
SOM is covered in Chapter 4.
●
Maintain proper power. For outdoor installations with a clear path, the radio signals
attenuate with the square of distance, so that doubling the range requires a four-fold
increase in power. Doubling the distance increases path loss by 6 dB. For indoor
installations, doubling the distance increases path loss by 9 dB. It is important that
the proper power be used to generate the signal.
●
Separate antennas as much as possible. Antennas increase the effective power by
focusing the radiated energy in the desired direction. Using the correct antenna not
only focuses power into the desired area but it also reduces the amount of power
broadcast into areas where it is not needed. However, not all antennas for other
installations have been correctly selected. It is good to install antennas as high as
possible and far away from other antennas.
Intersymbol Interference When an RF signal is transmitted, it does not take a direct
path straight to the receiver. Instead, multiple copies of the signal are transmitted, and these
various copies may bounce off objects in the area before reaching the receiver at slightly dif-
ferent times having traveled along different paths, a phenomenon known as multipath.
Although the difference between the signals, called delay spread, is so small as to be measured
in nanoseconds, it can still affect reception because these copies are “added” to the primary
signal. Known as intersymbol interference (ISI), this adding of signals to the primary signal
can result in downfade, corruption, or nulling.
Multipath and delay spread are covered in Chapter 3, and ISI is
discussed in Chapter 5.
There is no solution for eliminating ISI, since it is a natural part of RF transmissions.
However, there are two ways to reduce its impact. The first way is to switch to a WLAN
that supports multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO). A wireless system that uses a single
antenna, called a single-input single-output (SISO) system, is characterized by having
only one radio with the supporting infrastructure (a radio chain). MIMO wireless systems
use multiple antennas. By sending the same transmission out from different antennas in
a MIMO system will cause the signals to take different paths. These different paths
improve reliability because it is unlikely that all of the paths will be degraded in the
same way. Thus, switching to a WLAN that uses MIMO—such as IEEE 802.11a/n—may
reduce ISI.

SISO and MIMO are covered in Chapter 4, while OFDM is discussed
in Chapter 5.
The second way to reduce the impact of ISI is use the correct antenna. For outdoor settings,
a highly-directional antenna that sends a narrowly focused signal beam long distances may
help reduce ISI.
Highly-directional antennas are discussed in Chapter 4.
WLAN Configuration
Another category of problem sources of WLANs are the WLAN configuration settings.
These include cochannel interference, adjacent-channel interference, power settings, system
throughput, and incorrect AP configuration settings.
Cochannel Interference WLANs that are in the same area can be a source of interfer-
ence. Cochannel interference can result when two or more networks attempt to use the same
channel. This is because if all of the APs were set to the same channel number then it would
result in reduced throughput by forcing each station to wait a longer period of time for their
turn to transmit. The solution for cochannel interference is first to use an application to
identify if any other WLANs are in the area and on which channel they are transmitting.
Then the channel number of the WLAN can be changed to one that is not being used.
An application such as Vistumbler, covered in Project 3-2, or in SSIDer,
used in Project 3-4, can identify any nearby WLANs and their channel
numbers.
However, free channels may not always be available. On an IEEE 802.11b/g network in the
2.4-GHz frequency, there are only three nonoverlapping 20-MHz channels: 1, 6, and 11.
If cochannel interference exists with no free channels available, moving to a protocol with
more non-overlapping channels may be the only option. IEEE 802.11a and 802.11n, both
operating in the 5-GHz frequency, have 8 and 23 nonoverlapping channels, respectively.
Adjacent Channel Interference It is not uncommon for a transmission on one
channel to encroach upon another channel. For example, when using IEEE 802.11b/g in
the 2.4-GHz frequency channels are designed to be þ/11 MHz from the channel center
frequency, yet some of the transmission may still encroach onto other frequencies up to
30 MHz from the channel center. This results in the channel actually consuming five over-
lapping channels so that, for example, transmitting on channel 6 may cause interference
on channels 5 and 7 as well as limited interference on channels 4 and 8. When a WLAN
is transmitting on one channel (such as channel 1) and a nearby WLAN is transmitting
on an adjacent channel (channel 2) this may cause what is known as adjacent channel
interference.

The adjacent channel interference by extraneous power from a signal
in an adjacent channel is often the result of inadequate filtering or
improper tuning.
The solution for adjacent channel interference is the same as that with cochannel interference,
namely identify the channel that is being used by a nearby WLAN and switch to a different
channel.
It is not recommended that adjacent channels be used in WLANs. For
example, with 802.11b/g only the nonoverlapping channels of 1, 6,
and 11 should be used.
Incorrect Power Settings In Figure 12-3, the AP is transmitting at 100 milliwatts
(mW). Laptops A, B, and C are all within its coverage area and also can transmit at 100 mW.
However, Smartphone 1, which can transmit only at 40mW, is outside of the coverage area
because it is too far away and thus cannot detect the AP’s signal. To solve this problem, a
wireless LAN administrator decides to replace the AP with a more powerful unit that can
transmit at 200 mW, thus increasing the coverage area to include Smartphone 1, as depicted in
Figure 12-4. Smartphone 1 can now pick up the AP’s signal and recognize that the WLAN
exists (when it could not before). However, whenever it attempts to transmit to the AP, its
transmission is never recognized. In addition, Laptops A, B, and C also are suddenly unable
to send to the AP, although they can receive its transmissions. What has just happened?

By replacing the 100-mW AP with a stronger 200-mW AP, the wireless LAN administrator
forgot a fundamental rule: an AP should not have an output power level higher than the
output power level of the wireless device. In Figure 12-4, the 200-mW AP did extend the
coverage area but it also exceeded the power level of all the devices. In a WLAN, the output
power of the AP must be matched to that of the lowest-powered mobile device.
In this example, instead of replacing the 100-mW AP with a stronger
200-mW AP the wireless LAN administrator should have installed an
antenna that would amplify and direct the signal towards Smart-
phone 1 as well as select an AP with a lower output power level.
Troubleshooting incorrect power settings can be accomplished by using a spectrum analyzer.
When positioned near the client device frames that are transmitted and read by the spectrum
analyzer should appear normal. However, when standing next to the AP frames that are
received from a station with a mismatched power setting will appear corrupted. The solution
is to change the output power level of the WLAN so that the AP matches the lowest-powered
device.
System Throughput Problems While the data rate is the theoretical maximum rated
speed of a network, the throughput is the measure of how much actual data can be sent per
unit of time across a network. Throughput is often used to measure the amount of data
actually sent across a network in a “real world” setting. If two 802.11 devices are 30 feet
(10 meters) apart the throughput may only be 5.5 Mbps.
When a WLAN is acting “sluggishly” that could be the result of several different influences
and may not always indicate a malfunctioning system. Before attempting to reconfigure

devices so as to troubleshoot slow system throughput, the first step should be to review the
many factors that can influence WLAN transmission speed. These factors include:
●
AP processor speed
●
Distance from the AP
●
Implementing security solutions (WPA and WPA2)
●
Number of users associated with an AP
●
Packet size
●
Request to send/clear to send (RTS/CTS) protocol
●
Types of RF interference
●
Using Point Coordination Function (PCF) protocol
Any one or a combination of these factors can influence system throughput. A good trouble-
shooting approach is to first determine if all devices are experiencing the problem or only a
single device. Next, identify the potential causes that may have the least impact on the system
if they are changed. For example, the AP processor speed can only be improved by purchasing
and installing a new AP, which is an expensive and time-consuming option. However, turning
off the RTS/CTS protocol is a simple solution that may result in higher throughput.
AP Configuration Settings Often WLAN problems are the result of incorrect or
incompatible AP settings with other devices. One way in which to troubleshoot these
problems is to watch the external light emitting diodes (LEDs) that are present on most APs.
The number of lights may range anywhere from three to six, show different colors, and per-
form different functions (blink, solid, etc.) to indicate the AP status. Table 12-2 illustrates
typical information that can be shown through AP LED status lights.
One of the common causes of lost connectivity is mismatched settings between the AP and
the wireless devices. If there is no connectivity the following two areas are often the primary
sources of the problem:
●
SSID. Wireless clients attempting to associate with the AP must use the same SSID as
the AP. If a client device’s SSID does not match the SSID of an AP in radio range the
client device will not associate.

Security settings. Wireless clients attempting to authenticate with the AP must support
the same security options configured in the AP, such as MAC address authentication,
preshared key (PSK) and 802.1X settings.
In extreme circumstances it may be necessary to delete the current
AP configuration and return all of the settings to the factory default
settings so the configuration process can start all over again.
Wireless Device Troubleshooting
The last category of problem sources of WLANs involves the wireless mobile devices. Potential
problems include the device location and resolving connectivity issues.
Device Location Two problems are associated with the location of the wireless device:
near/far and hidden nodes.
Near/Far In Figure 12-5, Laptop A is transmitting at 100 mW and is located only 5 feet
(1.5 meters) away from the AP, while Laptop B is separated from the AP by a distance of
50 feet (15.2 meters) and is transmitting at only 10 mW. The stronger signal from Laptop A
“drowns out” the weaker signal from Laptop B. This is known as the near/far transmission
problem.

Identifying a device that is a victim of the near/far transmission problem can be accomplished
by using a wireless protocol analyzer to determine the signal strength. There are different
solutions to near/far transmission problems:
●
Move the device with the stronger transmission power farther away from the AP
●
Reduce the transmission power of devices that are closer to the AP
●
Increase the transmission power of devices that are farther away from the AP
Near/far transmission problems are not common due to the nature of
CSMA/CA.
Hidden Nodes In a WLAN all stations need to be able to detect transmissions from all
other stations at all times. However, in a wireless environment, a station might be in range
of the AP but not be in range of all other stations. For example, wireless Devices 1 and 2 may
be within range of the AP but not within range of each other. If Device 2 “listens” and hears
no traffic, it might assume no transmissions are taking place, while actually Device 1 is already
transmitting, resulting in a collision. This is known as the hidden node problem.
Hidden nodes are covered in Chapter 6.
There are several ways to resolve a hidden node problem:
●
Move the hidden node device
●
Remove any physical obstacles that may be interfering with devices communicating
with each other
●
Increase the client device’s power level
●
Add an additional AP to the WLAN
Resolving Connectivity Issues A failure to connect to an existing network or a con-
nection with poor throughput often is the result of an incorrect configuration on the wireless
device. Resolving these problems on a device using Microsoft Windows involves knowing
how a Windows device connects to a WLAN, using the available Windows wireless tools,
and considering a list of troubleshooting steps.
Windows Connection Process When a wireless device using Windows attempts to
connect to a WLAN, it goes through a multistep process. In general the process is:
1. Scan for wireless networks. The wireless client network adapter performs a scan (about
once every 60 seconds) for the available wireless networks within range. When scanning,
the wireless network adapter sends a series of Probe Request frames and the APs that
receive the frames respond with a Beacon frame that contains the capabilities of the
wireless AP, such as the supported speeds, SSID, and security options.

Dual band wireless adapters are common in laptops, tablets, and
smartphones. Windows defaults to a channel search that starts with
the 5-GHz channel 36 and continues searching through all of the
5-GHz channels that the client is capable of using. If no 5-GHz AP
is found, it will next search the 2.4 GHz starting at channel 1. This
means that unless the Windows default is changed or the user has chosen a third party utility
to set the preference to 2.4 GHz, the device will always first try to associate to a 5-GHz AP.
Apple devices likewise search 5 GHz first.
2. Choose an AP. After receiving the frames from the AP, the wireless device chooses a
wireless AP with which it will attempt to authenticate and associate. The decision of
which AP to choose is based on the following factors:
●Wireless AP capabilities. Based on the AP capabilities in the Beacon frame, the
wireless device must be able to support those capabilities. If the device’s abilities
do not match those of the AP, then the device cannot choose that AP. For exam-
ple, if the AP is configured to only support Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)
while the wireless NIC adapter on the device can only support WPA, then AP
capabilities do not match those of the device and the device cannot associate
with that AP.
●Preferred networks. Users can create a list of preferred wireless networks based
on SSID. If the device receives Beacon frames from multiple APs that are in the pre-
ferred list, then the most preferred wireless network (the highest one in the list) is
chosen. If the SSID of the received Beacon frames does not match a preferred network,
Windows prompts the user with a message in the notification area of the Windows
desktop giving them the option to connect to the new wireless network.
●Signal strength. The wireless network adapter of the wireless client chooses the AP
with the highest signal strength for the wireless network name that is highest in the
preferred list.
3. Authenticate. After choosing the AP with which to connect, the device and AP perform
authentication. The type of authentication depends on the security capabilities of the wire-
less AP and how the wireless device has been configured to authenticate with the AP.
4. Associate. After authentication has successfully completed, the wireless network adapter
and the wireless AP exchange a series of messages to create an association.
5. Obtain an IP address. The final step is for the wireless device to obtain an IP address.
Depending upon the configuration this can be accomplished in several ways:
●Manual addressing. The device can be configured manually with a static IP address
that allows the device to communicate with other computers on the network and to
reach the Internet.
●DHCP addressing. The device may be configured to use the Dynamic Host Config-
uration Protocol (DHCP) to request an IP address.
●APIPA addressing. If the wireless device is configured for DHCP yet no DHCP
server is active, then Windows assigns an Automatic Private IP Addressing (APIPA)
address that begins with the IP range 169.254.x.x. If an APIPA address is assigned,
the wireless device may not be able to reach other devices on the network and will
not be able to reach the Internet. If an APIPA address is assigned to a wireless

device, Windows displays “Limited or no connectivity” for the status of the wireless
connection.
Because the 5-GHz spectrum is less crowded and can provide higher
data rates, many organizations want to direct devices that have dual
band wireless adapters away from connecting to a slower 2.4 GHz
802.11b/g WLAN to a faster 5 GHz 802.11a/n network. One way to
do this is to take advantage of a new technology available in some
APs called band steering: when a dual band device sends a probe request frame to the AP on
the 5-GHz spectrum the AP will temporarily “hide” the 2.4-GHz band so it appears that the
5 GHz is the only connection available. Another way is to add “slow” and “fast” to the SSID
names (such as “Network-Slow” and “Network-Fast”) to persuade users to manually choose the
faster network.
Microsoft Windows Tools The Microsoft Windows operating system provides tools
that can be used to view the wireless connection as well as make changes. Windows 7
has several separate tools. The first tool is the Network and Sharing Center, shown in
Figure 12-6, which provides information regarding all active network connections as well
as links to other tools.

Another tool is the Wireless Network Connection Status dialog box, shown in Figure 12-7.
This dialog box provides an overview of the current status by displaying the Layer 3 connec-
tivity status (for both IPv4 and IPv6), the media state, the SSID being used, the length of time
the connection has been active, the negotiated connection speed, and the signal quality. The
Details button gives more information including the Layer 2 physical address, the Layer 3
logical address, dynamic addressing parameters (DHCP), and name resolution items. The
Network Connection Details dialog box is shown in Figure 12-8.
The third tool is the Wireless Network Connection Properties dialog box, shown in Figure 12-9.
This tool provides comprehensive information and the ability to adjust configurations.
Important areas of this dialog box include:
●
Networking tab. The information on this tab shows which wireless network adapter is
being used for this connection. If multiple adapters are installed, they can be changed.
●
Sharing tab. This tab includes settings for a type of configuration known as Internet
Connection Sharing (ICS) that allows other users on the network to access resources
through this computer’s connection.
●
This connection uses the following items list. This list, on the Networking tab, displays
different clients, services, and protocols that are currently available for this connection.
By deselecting an item in this list, and then clicking the appropriate button below the
list, users can install or uninstall network clients, network services, and network pro-
tocols. Users can also view the client, service, or protocol properties for a selected item

by clicking the Properties button. (If the Properties button is gray, a Properties page is
not available for that item.) Users can also access the network adapters’ hardware
configuration property pages.
The network adapters’ hardware configuration property pages are
the same pages that can be accessed from the Device Manager.
The Windows 8 operating system handles wireless networking differently than Windows 7. It
uses a simpler and more integrated radio and connection management interface. The Windows
8 network settings allows users to turn on and off installed wireless radios, such as IEEE 802.11
devices, as well as other types of devices individually or all at the same time. Windows 8 also
supports native radio management to eliminate conflicts between applications, and allows users
to prioritize WLANs over other types of wireless networks, such as telephone broadband.
Because WLANs are typically faster without data limitations imposed by the carriers, when con-
necting to a WLAN, Windows 8 will automatically disconnect a device from the user’s mobile
broadband network and power down the mobile broadband device to increase battery life.
Windows 8 also includes support for different WLAN hotspot authentication types, including
WISPr (Wireless Internet Service Provider roaming), EAP-SIM/AKA/AKA Prime, and EAP-TTLS.
Microsoft also claims that, when resuming a device from standby,
Windows 8 will reconnect faster to a WLAN networks by optimizing
operations in the networking stack as well as providing existing con-
nection information. In fact, Microsoft says that a Windows 8 device
will reconnect to a WLAN in 1 second as opposed to 12 seconds
when using Windows 7.
Another Windows tool available in all versions of Windows, the Event Viewer, allows for log
files to be examined. A log is simply a record of events. Logs are composed of log entries, with
each entry containing information related to a specific event. Logs have been used in informa-
tion technology since its inception, primarily for troubleshooting problems. Logs have now
evolved to contain information related to many different types of events within hosts and net-
works. Log files can often be analyzed to determine the underlying cause of wireless issues.
The types of information that can be recorded in a log might include
the date and time of the event, a description of the event, its status,
error codes, service name, and user or system that was responsible
for launching the event.
Troubleshooting Steps If there is a problem making a wireless connection, the following
list of troubleshooting steps may be considered:
●
Incompatible IEEE 802.11 standards. Although some APs can support more than one of
the IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n standards, not all APs support multiple standards. It is possible
for a mismatch to take place between the AP and a wireless device: for example, an
802.11a AP will not connect to a wireless device with 802.11b/g wireless adapter cards.
●
Mismatched authentication methods. The wireless device will not be able to authenticate
if it does not use the same authentication method as the AP.

Editorial review has deemed that any suppressed content does not materially affect the overall learning experience. Cengage Learning reserves the right to remove additional content at any time if subsequent rights restrictions require it.

●
Mismatched preshared key. When using PSK authentication, the key value must be
correctly entered in the device to match the key on the AP.
●
Conflict between operating system configuration and a third-party configuration tool.
Most operating systems have a wireless configuration tool that is enabled by default,
yet it may conflict with a network adapter vendor’s configuration tool. This results in
both tools sending their settings to the wireless network adapter, which may result in
configuration mismatches. One of the tools must be turned off.
●
Incorrect MAC address. If the AP is using MAC address filtering, the MAC address
of each wireless device must be entered correctly.
●
Disabled wireless adapter. Many laptops and tablets have either a switch or a hot-key set-
ting that enables and disables the wireless adapter. The switch may have accidentally been
turned off or the user may have erroneously pressed the key sequence to turn off the adapter.
●
Legacy wireless NIC driver. Older wireless NIC drivers tend to be poorly written or
fail to take advantage of new enhancements. Simply updating a driver can often solve
a wireless connection problem.
●
Outdated profiles. The configuration settings for a WLAN can be stored so that
whenever the wireless device comes into the range of the AP, a connection is established,
as illustrated in Figure 12-10. If the network configuration changes, as often happens,
profiles will be outdated.

12
Another common problem is that the wireless device intermittently disconnects from the AP. If
this occurs, check the following list of possible causes and apply these troubleshooting steps:
●
Incompatible 802.1X authentication. If 802.1X authentication is enabled, yet does
not properly complete, the connection is then dropped. This typically happens three
minutes after the connection has been made using open system authentication.
●
Duplicate SSID. If the same SSID is used on another AP, then both APs are considered
to be part of the same network and must share the same security settings. However,
in instances where a default SSID has not been changed, it is possible that two
separate devices not intended to be part of the same WLAN (such as two devices
in the same apartment building) are broadcasting the same SSID. The wireless device
may then choose the remote AP of another wireless network instead of the local
AP. Because that remote device will not be configured for the same authentication
method and keys of the main wireless network, the wireless device will not be able
to connect to it.
To determine if the SSID is being duplicated by another wireless
network that is within range, turn off the local AP and use a
wireless protocol analyzer or another computer to scan for avail-
able wireless networks. If the local SSID appears in the list of
available networks when the AP is turned off, then there is a
duplicate wireless network name. Reconfigure the local wireless AP for a unique SSID. Duplicate
SSIDs are generally the result of the default SSID being used on an AP, which may also be a
security vulnerability.
●
Interference from nontraditional devices. As wireless technology is incorporated into
other types of devices besides laptop and tablet computers, these devices may interfere
with a “standard” WLAN. For example, game consoles and streaming television Internet
devices today often have WLAN capabilities built in. It is important not to overlook any
of these devices as a source of potential interference.
WLAN Optimization
Unlike with wired networks, a variety of techniques can be used to optimize a WLAN. These
help to ensure that the wireless network is adequately providing services for its users. WLAN
optimization includes optimizing the channel, the AP, and the wireless devices.
Channel Optimization
Because most WLANs are designed so that users can freely move through buildings or large
areas while continuing to maintain a connection, optimizing the channel for roaming is a
primary concern. A wireless device can only roam from the coverage area of one AP to
another AP if the SSID and security settings are identical, although the channel number will
be different to avoid cochannel and adjacent-channel interference. As a wireless device begins
to move farther away from the AP to which it is associated, the device will monitor RF signal
strength or packet error rates to determine if it should search for a new AP. Generally, when
the signal strength drops to 75 dB or packet error rates exceed 8 percent, a wireless device
will begin looking for another AP.

Roaming is covered in Chapter 6.
Ensuring smooth roaming is primarily based on cell overlap. Cell overlap is the area between
two APs, as shown in Figure 12-11, in which a wireless device begins to search for a new AP
with which to associate. Recommended settings for cell overlap vary. Some vendors recom-
mend an overlap of 20 percent when using 802.11b/g and 15 percent when using 802.11a/n
is desirable. Other vendors use dB instead of percentage and recommend 10 dBm of overlap,
which means that when a device is in this cell overlap area and begins the handoff process
the new AP should have a signal that is 10 dB stronger than the old AP.
Another consideration for channel optimization has to do with areas in which client devices
may, on occasion, exceed the normal expectations. In a typical office setting, a site survey
may indicate that AP should be deployed for 2,500 to 5,000 square feet with a signal of
67 dBm supporting a maximum of 20 users per cell. That would mean that a density of one
user every 120 square feet would yield a minimum acceptable signal of 67 dBm. However,
what about in a high-density environment, such as a lecture hall or auditorium on a school
campus? In these areas, users are clustered very close together in seating areas, with intervening
open spaces such as aisle ways, stages, and podiums that are much less occupied. Each student
might use multiple wireless devices (smartphones, tablets, laptops, etc.) for performing a wide
range of different tasks. All of these tasks require different amounts of bandwidth, as listed in
Table 12-3. How can adequate throughput be achieved for these high-density areas?
The solution is to optimize the channel by installing high-density WLANs. These wireless
networks, using several APs, have several characteristics:
●
More APs are clustered closer together in order to provide the resources to users.
●
APs are positioned in different locations, such as floor mounted or high on walls.

●
Newer standards are utilized to maximize throughput, as illustrated in Table 12-4.
●
Older standards such as IEEE 802.11b are not implemented due to their impact on
throughput.
Access Point Optimization
Steps for optimizing APs include:
●
Never accept the default configuration of an AP. Always configure it for a unique
SSID, a channel to minimize cochannel and adjacent-channel interference, and the
highest level of security authentication and encryption settings.
●
Install lightweight APs to minimize the total cost of ownership (TCO).
●
Configure wireless VLANs for additional security.

●
Take advantage of wireless network management systems (WNMS).
●
For guest accounts use a captive portal AP.
●
Use picocells when necessary. A picocell is a WLAN that uses a reduced power
output from the AP that results in a smaller coverage area but can allow for increased
performance due to channel reuse.
●
Size the coverage area to the corresponding standard. Figure 12-12 compares the
coverage area of a 5 GHz (802.11a) with a 2 GHz (802.11b) with no obstacles to
create interference. Note that higher data rates do not extend as far from the AP.
Because obstacles such as walls, doors, filing cabinets, and other indoor
objects can have such an impact on signal strength, it is desirable to
keep in mind the distances in an outdoor setting with no attenuation
factors. These outdoor distances are illustrated in Figure 12-12.
Wireless Device Optimization
Optimizing the wireless device is also important. Some wireless devices, such as Voice over
Wi-Fi (VoWiFi), can be configured based on their roaming tendencies. Devices that rely on
time-dependent applications, such as voice or video streaming, perform better with less roam-
ing. These devices may be configured as “conservative roaming,” while other devices that do
not normally use these applications can be set to “aggressive roaming.”

Different solutions have been proposed to facilitate fast and secure
roaming, particularly while using VoWiFi with IEEE 802.11X. Several
vendors have their own unique proprietary solutions, while the
IEEE 802.11r-2008 (Fast Basic Service Set Transition) amendment is
an attempt to standardize these differences.
When possible a wireless device should be set to “disable upon wired connect.” This turns
off the wireless connection whenever the device connects to a standard wired network by
using a cable connection. This provides a higher degree of security so that the device cannot
be used as a rogue AP to circumvent security.
Chapter Summary
■Troubleshooting requires both a systematic approach and a “sixth sense” that is sharp-
ened by experience. It is important that wireless network administrators and technicians
develop good wireless troubleshooting skills. The first step in troubleshooting a WLAN
is to identify the source of the problem. One of the main sources of WLAN problems is
RF interference. Radio frequency interference (RFI) is any undesirable electrical energy
emitted within the frequency range dedicated to RF transmissions. These unwanted
RF signals are called noise. There are four categories of external noise interference on a
WLAN. Narrowband interference is usually generated by television, radio, and satellite
transmitters and impacts a narrow portion of the spectrum and does not affect the entire
band. Wideband interference affects the entire frequency band, such as the entire
2.4-GHz band. Competing technologies that use FHSS to “hop” across the spectrum
can create all-band interference that covers all bands of the RF spectrum. Weather can
have an impact on wireless transmissions outdoors. Over a long distance, an RF signal
may move through different atmospheric conditions.
■Multiple copies of a WLAN signal arrive at the receiver at different times, having
traveled along different paths, in a phenomenon known as multipath. Although the
difference between the signals, called delay spread, is so small as to be measured in
nanoseconds, nevertheless it can have an impact upon the reception because these
copies are “added” to the primary signal. Known as intersymbol interference (ISI), this
adding of signals to the primary signal can result in downfade, corruption, or nulling.
■Another category of WLAN problem sources has to do with WLAN configuration
settings. Cochannel interference can result when two or more networks attempt to use
the same channel. If all of the APs are set to the same channel number, throughput is
reduced because each station is forced to wait a longer period of time for its turn to
transmit. A WLAN transmitting on one channel while a nearby WLAN is transmitting
on an adjacent channel can cause adjacent channel interference. Incorrect power settings
can be another problem source. An AP should not have an output power level higher
than the output power level of the wireless device.
■While the data rate is the theoretical maximum rated speed of a network, the throughput
is the measure of how much actual data can be sent per unit of time across a network.
Throughput is often used to measure the amount of data actually sent across a network in
a “real world” setting. Any one factor, or a combination of factors, can influence system
throughput. Often WLAN problems are the result of incorrect AP settings, or AP settings

that are incompatible with other devices. One way to troubleshoot these problems is to
watch the external light emitting diodes (LEDs) that are present on most APs.
■When troubleshooting wireless mobile devices, one problem area is the location of
devices. If one device is transmitting at 100 mW and is located fairly close to the AP,
while another device is farther away and transmitting at only 10 mW, the stronger
signal from the first device may overwhelm the weaker signal from distant device. This
is known as the near/far transmission problem. In addition, in a WLAN, all stations
need to be able to detect transmissions from all other stations at all times; however,
in a wireless environment, a station might be in range of the AP but not be in range
of all other stations and could transmit while other stations are already transmitting.
This is known as the hidden node problem.
■A failure to connect to an existing network or a connection with poor throughput is
often the result of an incorrect configuration on the wireless device. The Microsoft
Windows operating system provides tools can be used to view the wireless connection
as well as make changes. For Windows 7 these include the Network and Sharing
Center, the Wireless Network Connection Status, and the Wireless Network Connection
Properties window. The Windows 8 operating system makes several changes by using
a simpler and more integrated radio and connection management interface. If there is a
problem making a wireless connection, several troubleshooting steps may be considered
to resolve the problem.
■Unlike with wired networks, a variety of techniques can be used to optimize a WLAN to
ensure that it is adequately providing services for its users. Ensuring smooth roaming
between WLAN cells is primarily based on cell overlap, which is the area between
two APs in which a wireless device begins to search for a new AP with which to associate.
Recommended settings for cell overlap vary are given as either a percentage or a
recommended dBm of overlap. In a high-density environment such as a lecture hall or
auditorium on a school campus, where users are clustered very close together in a seating
area, a solution is to optimize the channel by installing high-density WLANs.
■Several steps can be taken to optimize APs. These include never accepting the default
configuration of an AP, installing lightweight APs to minimize the TCO, configuring
wireless VLANs for additional security, taking advantage of WNMS, for guest accounts
use a captive portal AP, and using picocells when necessary. Optimizing the wireless
device is also important. Some wireless devices can be configured based on their roam-
ing tendencies: devices that rely on time-dependent applications perform better with less
roaming while other devices that do not normally use these applications can be set to
more aggressive roaming. When possible, a wireless device should be set to “disable
upon wired connect.” This turns off the wireless connection whenever the device con-
nects to a standard wired network by using a cable connection. This provides a higher
degree of security so that the device cannot be used as a rogue AP to circumvent security

The prospect of having someone constantly monitor your location throughout the
day conjures up the image of Big Brother spying on our activities. But there are
advantages to knowing where someone is located, and wireless indoor location track-
ing is being implemented on a wider scale to help consumers and patients.
Stores, airports, museums, colleges, hospitals, sports stadiums, and large conven-
tion centers are turning to wireless indoor location tracking to help guide users to
their destination. Instead of having to refer to large and often confusing “You Are
Here” signs, individuals can turn to smartphone apps for guidance instead. In one
large four-story bookstore, a shopper can use an app to type the title of the book
she is searching for and check a box to indicate her current location in the store. She
will then immediately receive turn-by-turn instructions to navigate through the aisles
to the book’s exact location. In an Australian art museum, each visitor is provided
with a wireless device that can be worn around the neck with a lanyard. Tapping on
the screen of the device brings up a list of all the pieces of art in the vicinity of where
the visitor is standing. Selecting one of the items causes the wireless device to display
a history of the piece along with a critical analysis of that work.
Although the technology for finding outdoor locations, such as a store or a house,
has been available for several years, wireless indoor location mapping had to over-
come several significant challenges. The process of creating a building’s floor plan
online can be very time-consuming. Stores and businesses must submit to mapping
companies their architectural drawings, engineering files, and even photos so that
teams of programmers can create a “clickable” digital diagram. Also, determining a
user’s indoor location can be difficult. While satellite Global Positioning System (GPS)
technology can be used outdoors to pinpoint a user’s cell phone to within a few
yards of its location, GPS can be spotty or even nonexistent indoors. Mapping compa-
nies are hiring workers to walk through every square foot of an indoor venue three
to four times while carrying a smartphone or tablet computer. Workers are instructed
to stop every few feet, manually tap their location on a map of the venue, and then
spin around so their device can register all the wireless signals in that area. This
creates a database that can then be used for tracking. Some stores are installing
Bluetooth wireless networks for increased accuracy in tracking customers.
Despite its challenges, indoor location mapping provides several new benefits.
Sports fans can order concessions through their smartphone and have them delivered
right to their seats so that they do not miss a minute of the big game. One large
retailer has released a trip-planning app that allows a shopper to enter a shopping
list and receive a map of the shortest path through the store to complete his shop-
ping. At the parking garage of a large mall, cameras record a car’s license plate

The popularity of wireless local area networks (WLANs) continues to surge. By some esti-
mates there will be 1.4 billion devices shipped in the year 2014 that support the IEEE 802.11
standards.i These include smartphones, laptops, desktops, and tablets.
However, WLANs are not the only wireless network technology in use today. Several other
wireless technologies are also associated with IEEE standards. These technologies can be cate-
gorized by the geographical distance that they cover. There are four broad wireless technology
categories:
●
Wireless personal area network. A wireless personal area network (WPAN) is designed
for hand-held and portable devices at slow to moderate transmission speeds. The
maximum distance range between devices is generally 33 feet (10 meters) transmitted at
1 Mbps.
●
Wireless local area network. WLANs such as IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n are for portable or
stationary devices that are within a few hundred feet of each other or a centrally
located access point (AP) (the maximum distance is usually 350 feet or 107 meters).
Depending upon the standard, transmission speeds may range up to 600 Mbps.
number at each parking spot; shoppers can then enter their license number into a
smartphone app and receive step-by-step directions back to their car. Soon users will
be able to follow their phone to their seat at a 75,000-seat stadium, to their computer
class on a large college campus, or directly to a pair of jeans at a store in the mall.
Retailers are using indoor wireless location tracking in order to understand a shop-
per’s behavior so that they can deploy more salespeople, alter displays, or put out
different merchandise in order to meet an immediate demand. Radio frequency
identification chips and motion sensors are used to track how often a pair of jeans is
picked up or how many customers turn left when they enter a store. One large
retailer used wireless indoor location tracking to generate maps showing which
parts of the store received the most traffic and then used it to make decisions about
where to place in-store decorations, salespeople, and merchandise. These decisions
were made in a week instead of the usual six months. The result was a 20-percent
increase in sales. Some stores are now testing facial-recognition software that can
identify a shopper’s gender and approximate age as she enters a store, and then
beam coupons to her for specific items she might be interested in purchasing.
Wireless location tracking is not limited to shopping. Hospitals are using it to track
patients. Researchers have found that cell phone data can indicate when someone is
ill. For example, those who have the flu tend to move around much less, and those
who are depressed have fewer calls and text messages with others. One hospital is
tracking teens and young adults who suffer from an inflammatory bowel disease.
This illness is typically treated with a two-week course of steroids, but these can be
harmful when used for too long. By monitoring the behavior of patients through
wireless location tracking—such as when the patient leaves the house for the first
time after several days (indicating they are improving)—doctors can reduce the time
patients are on the steroids.

●
Wireless metropolitan area network. A wireless metropolitan area network
(WMAN) is designed for devices in a range of up to 35 miles (56 kilometers)
using radio frequency (RF) or infrared transmission technology at different
speeds.
●
Wireless wide area network. Wireless facilities that connect networks in different
parts of a country or of the world are known as wireless wide area networks
(WWANs). The transmission speeds again vary, although often are slower than
those for a WMAN.
The categories of wireless technologies are covered in Chapter 1.
Figure 13-1 compares the distance range of these four technologies.
In this chapter you will explore these other wireless networks: WPAN, WMAN, and WWAN.
In addition, the next IEEE WLAN standard, IEEE 802.11ac, will also be examined.
Wireless Personal Area Networks (IEEE 802.15)
There are several WPAN technologies, each of which either has an IEEE standard or a stan-
dard is being developed in the 802.15 family of standards. These technologies are Bluetooth
(802.15.1-2005), Ultrawideband (802.15.3c-2009), low rate technologies (802.15.4), Body
Area Networks (802.15.6), and Visible Light Communications (802.15.7).
Bluetooth (802.15.1-2005)
Bluetooth is a wireless technology that uses short-range RF transmissions and provides for
rapid ad hoc device pairings. Bluetooth technology enables users to connect wirelessly to a
wide range of computing and telecommunications devices. Several of these Bluetooth-enabled
product pairings are listed in Table 13-1.

Bluetooth is covered in Chapter 1.
The current version is Bluetooth v4.0 (a subset is known as Bluetooth Low Energy), yet all
Bluetooth devices are backward compatible with previous versions. Most Bluetooth
devices have a range of 33 feet (10 meters). The rate of transmission is 1 million bits per
second (Mbps).
The IEEE 802.15.1-2005 Wireless Personal Area Network standard
was based on the Bluetooth v1.2 specifications. However, the IEEE
has discontinued its relationship with Bluetooth, so that any future
Bluetooth versions will not become IEEE standards.
There are two types of Bluetooth network topologies. The first is known as a Bluetooth
piconet. In this topology, when two Bluetooth devices come within range of each other,
they automatically connect to each another. One device is the master, and controls all of
the wireless traffic. The other device is known as a slave, which takes commands from the
master. Slave devices that are connected to the piconet and are sending transmissions are
known as active slaves; devices that are connected but are not actively participating are
called parked slaves. An example of a Bluetooth piconet is illustrated in Figure 13-2.
Figure 13-3 illustrates a slave device that is detected by a master.
Devices in a Bluetooth piconet can be in one of five different modes:
●
Standby. A device in standby mode is waiting to join a piconet.
●
Inquire. In inquire mode another device is looking for other devices with which to connect.

piconets makes up the second type of Bluetooth network topology and is called a Bluetooth
scatternet. A scatternet is illustrated in Figure 13-4.

A Bluetooth device can be a slave in several piconets but can be a
master in only one piconet.
Bluetooth uses frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) so that all devices in a Bluetooth net-
work must change frequencies at the same time and in the same sequence in order for commu-
nications to take place. The timing in the hopping sequence is determined by the master’s clock,
to which each active slave is synchronized. All 79 channels on which Bluetooth transmits are
divided into time slots of 625 microseconds. The hopping sequence—that is, which slot will be
used next—is unique for each piconet and is determined by the device address of the master.
Because Bluetooth and certain IEEE 802.11 WLANs share the same
2.4 GHz spectrum, a conflict between devices can arise. An IEEE
task group known as 802.15.2 was formed to create a means by
which these two technologies could coexist. Two theoretical solutions
were proposed but were never implemented, and the group is
currently in official “hibernation.”
Bluetooth technology is a short-range wireless technology designed for interconnecting
computers and peripherals, hand-held devices, or cell phones. It can be used for almost any
short-range application where low cost is essential. However, its major drawback is its slow
speed. This is because the original Bluetooth standard was designed as a simple cable replace-
ment for computers and other devices.
Bluetooth is also finding its way into unlikely devices. A Victorinox
Swiss Army pocketknife model has Bluetooth technology that can be
used to remotely control a computer when projecting a PowerPoint
presentation. The pocketknife also serves as a 32 GB USB flash drive
that has a biometric fingerprint scanner. And since pocketknives
cannot be carried onto an airplane, one version of the pocketknife
lacks a sharp blade.

Due to the ad hoc nature of Bluetooth piconets and scatternets, attacks on wireless
Bluetooth technology are not uncommon. Two Bluetooth attacks are bluejacking and
bluesnarfing. Bluejacking is an attack that sends unsolicited messages to Bluetooth-enabled
devices. Usually bluejacking involves sending text messages, but images and sounds
can also be transmitted. Bluejacking is usually considered more annoying than harmful
because no data is stolen. However, many Bluetooth users resent receiving unsolicited
messages. Bluesnarfing is an attack that accesses unauthorized information from a wireless
device through a Bluetooth connection, often between cell phones and laptop computers.
In a bluesnarfing attack the attacker copies e-mails, calendars, contact lists, cell phone
pictures, or videos by connecting to the Bluetooth device without the owner’s knowledge
or permission.
To prevent bluesnarfing, Bluetooth devices should be turned off when
not being used or when in a room with unknown people. Another
option is to set Bluetooth on the device as undiscoverable, which keeps
Bluetooth turned on yet it cannot be detected by another device.
Ultra-Wideband (802.15.3c-2009)
Because of the limitations of Bluetooth, the IEEE established a group to investigate high-rate
WPANs. The result became known as Ultra-wideband (UWB) or 802.15.3c-2009. Two main
applications are intended for UWB. The first is video and audio distribution for home enter-
tainment systems, which includes high-speed digital video transfer from a digital camcorder
to a screen and interactive video gaming. The second application is higher-speed data transfer
intended for MP3 players, personal home storage devices, printers, scanners, and transfers to
and from digital still cameras and kiosks.
Several significant features designed for UWB are summarized in Table 13-2.
While work on the 802.15.3 standard was ongoing, it was decided that an alternative IEEE
study group—802.15.3a—would be formed to look at data rates even higher than 55 Mbps,
but this standard was later withdrawn. IEEE 802.15.3b-2005 addressed improving the imple-
mentation and interoperability of the 802.15.3 standard. The current standard is 802.15.c-2009
with speeds over 2 Gbps.
UWB has not been widely implemented. Because it distributes a signal across a wide range of
spectrum (sometimes several gigahertz), widespread interference on other transmissions is a con-
cern. Among the opponents were the Federal Aviation Association (FAA) and other Federal
agencies who claimed that UWB could interfere with critical safety equipment, such as aircraft
radar and communications, and thereby pose a threat to the public.
As an alternative to using UWB for wireless home entertainment
systems, a new technology known as Wireless Display (WiDi) is
gaining popularity. WiDi enables a user to project a display from
a WiDi-enabled portable device like a notebook or tablet to a
WiDi adapter connected to a television using 802.11n. A user can
share documents or stream movies on the portable device and display them onto the TV
screen. WiDi does not even require that the image on the device’s screen be the same as
that that being projected, so that a user can stream a movie while checking e-mail at the
same time.

Low Rate Technologies (802.15.4)
Although it might appear that the trend for wireless devices is to transmit faster and farther, that
is not always the case. In many settings, low speed and low power are more desirable. A WPAN
device using low power can be much smaller in size, even down to the size of a penny. Applica-
tions using low rate technologies include motion sensors that control lights or alarms, light wall
switches, meter reader devices, game controllers for interactive toys, tire pressure monitors in
cars, passive infrared sensors for building automation systems, and inventory tracking devices.
Power consumption is so low for these devices that it is estimated
that batteries powering the devices can last up to five years.
Recognizing the need for these smaller, low-power devices, the IEEE 802.15.4 standard was
approved in 2003. This standard addresses requirements for RF transmissions that require
low power consumption as well as low cost. The 802.15.4 devices operate up to 164 feet
(50 meters) at different frequencies, depending upon the data rate. Table 13-3 illustrates the
802.15.4 frequencies and data rates.

UWB Feature
Description
Quality of Service (QoS)
Because UWB was to be used extensively in audio and video applications, it is essential
that QoS be implemented.
Security
The security features for the 802.15.3 standard include key distribution and encryption
using AES. The standard supports four modes (levels) of security.
High data rates
The standard specifies raw data rates of 11 Mbps, 22 Mbps, 33 Mbps, 44 Mbps and
55 Mbps at distances of 33 feet (10 meters). The highest rate supports low-latency
multimedia connections and large file transfers, while 11 Mbps and 22 Mbps rates
target long-range connectivity for audio devices.
Spectrum utilization
The UWB standard uses the 2.4 GHz spectrum and supports either three or four
nonoverlapping channels 15 MHz wide.
Coexistence
The standard was designed to coexist with IEEE 802.11 WLANs. It causes less interference
because it occupied a smaller bandwidth and transmits at a lower power level. It also
monitors the channels that are being used by other devices and will dynamically select
the best channel available.

Two popular low rate 802.15.4 technologies are ZigBee and radio frequency ID
(802.15.4f).
ZigBee ZigBee is a low-power, short-range, and low-data rate specification. It is based on
802.15.4 but includes standards for network configuration, security and other higher-level
features that are not covered by the IEEE standard. ZigBee’s data rate is 250 kbps and is
best designed for occasional data or signal transmission from a sensor or input device.
ZigBee is typically found in the following applications:
●
Smart lighting
●
Advanced temperature control
●
Medical data collection
●
Smoke and intruder detection
The ZigBee name comes from the peculiar behavior of bees. After
zigging and zagging through fields when collecting nectar, bees return
to the hive and perform a waggle dance to communicate the distance,
direction and type of food to other bees in the hive. After receiving this
information, the other bees then fly off directly to the source of food.
Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) Although currently not governed by an
established IEEE standard, the 802.15.4f group is working on standards that relate to radio
frequency identification (RFID). The theoretical foundation for RFID was first proposed in the
mid-1940s; however, it took over 30 years for the technology to become available to apply
the theory. RFID tags are able to receive and respond to queries from an RFID transceiver.
RFID is covered in Chapter 1 and an image of an RFID tag can be
seen in Figure 1-4 of Chapter 1.
RFID tags can be either active or passive. Passive RFID tags do not have their own power
supply. Instead, the tiny electrical current induced in the antenna by the incoming signal from
the transceiver provides enough power for the tag to send a response. Because it does not require
a power supply, passive RFID tags can be very small—some are only 0.4 millimeters (mm) 
0.4 mm and thinner than a sheet of paper. However, with a passive tag the amount of data sent
back must also be very small, typically just an ID number. Passive tags have ranges from about
10 mm up to 19 feet (6 meters). Active RFID tags must have their own power source. Although
this makes the tags larger (about the size of a coin), the tags have longer ranges and larger memo-
ries than passive tags, as well as the ability to store additional information sent by the transceiver.
Many active tags have a range of 98 feet (30 meters) or more and a battery life of several years.
Four different kinds of RFID tags are commonly used. They are categorized by their radio
frequency, as listed in Table 13-4.
Common applications for RFID tags include:
●
Automobile toll booths in many states use RFID tags for electronic toll collection.
The tags are embedded in a device in the vehicle and are read as the vehicle passes
through the toll booth. The toll amount is automatically deducted from a prepaid
account. The system helps to speed traffic through toll plazas.

●
Asset tracking is a common use of RFID tags. They are used to track computers and
office equipment, folders in attorney’s offices, samples of construction concrete that
must be tested to ensure building safety, and car seats and dashboards used in an
assembly line.
●
A tire manufacturer embeds RFID tags in its tires to ensure tire-tracking capabilities
so the manufacturer can comply with the U.S. Transportation, Recall, Enhancement,
Accountability and Documentation Act (TREAD Act).
●
Cards with embedded RFID chips are widely used as electronic cash in casinos and to
pay mass transit fares.
●
A Smart Key, available on cars from select manufacturers, is an active RFID circuit that
allows the car to acknowledge the key’s presence within 3 feet of the sensor. The driver
can open the doors and start the car while the key remains in the driver’s purse or pocket.
●
Major retailers are requiring that cases and pallets of merchandise shipped to their
warehouses from large vendors have an RFID tag affixed. However, RFID tags on
individual items within the cases or pallets are not required.
●
Each U.S. passport has an RFID tag imbedded in the document. It contains the traveler’s
name, date of birth, city of origin, and other identifying information, such as a digital
photograph or digital fingerprints.
One hotel chain is embedding RFID chips into plastic loyalty program
cards in order to turn the cards into room keys. When a guest makes
a reservation their room number is sent to them as a text message.
The guest can then by-pass the front desk, go directly to that room,
and open the door using their loyalty card with the RFID chip.
A similar technology based on RFID standards is near field communication (NFC). NFC is a
set of standards primarily for smartphones and smart cards that is used to establish commu-
nication between devices. Once the devices are either tapped together or brought into close
proximity (several centimeters) to each other a two-way communication is established. NFC
devices are used in contactless payment systems where a consumer can pay for a purchase
by simply tapping a store’s payment terminal with their phone.
Every major cell phone manufacturer has announced plans to
incorporate NFC into its devices.

Body Area Networks (802.15.6)
The IEEE 802.15.6 group is currently creating standards for body area networks (BAN).
A BAN is formally defined by the IEEE as “a communication standard optimized for low
power devices and operation on, in or around the human body (but not limited to humans)
to serve a variety of applications including medical, consumer electronics/personal entertain-
ment and other.” A BAN is essentially a network system of devices in close proximity to a
person’s body that cooperate for the benefit of the user.
BANs are commonly used for sports and fitness monitoring. A runner or cyclist can have her
heart rate, respirations, blood pressure, and distance traveled transmitted to her wristwatch
or a small device affixed to her clothing. At a higher level, soccer shoes are now available
with an 8-gram chip, called a speed cell, inserted beneath the shoe’s sole. The speed cell
transmits data on maximum speed, distance covered, and the number of sprints to the ball
in all 360-degree movements.
Perhaps the most promising use of BANs involves healthcare applications. Sensors are placed
on the human body to monitor electrocardiogram (EKG) impulses, blood pressure, glucose,
and other human biological functions. These are then transmitted via computer or smart-
phone to a third party physician who can make a decision regarding any medications to
prescribe or lifestyle changes to recommend. Known as a managed body sensor network
(MBSN), this is illustrated in Figure 13-5.

A more robust approach is the autonomous body sensor network (ABSN). Instead of only
reading and transmitting information, an ABSN introduces actuators in addition to the
sensors so that immediate effects can be made on the human body. One type of ABSN has
already been approved for use. In late 2011 the Federal Communications Commission
(FCC) gave approval for the use of medical micropower networks (MMN). Four blocks of
the 400 MHz spectrum (two of the four channels are 426–432 and 438–444 MHz while
the other two are above and below the 420–450 MHz band) are allocated for low-power
wideband networks. MMN can serve dozens of micro-stimulator implant devices to treat
paralysis and other conditions. These devices take in signals from the human nervous
system and then stimulate nerves through electrical charges that cause muscles to contract
and limbs to move, bypassing areas of the nervous system that have been impaired by strokes
or spinal cord or brain injuries. The ABSN MMN can expand the use of functional electric
stimulation to restore sensation, mobility, and function to persons with paralyzed limbs
and organs.
Another ABSN being tested installs “stretchy” microprocessors on the
tips of cardiac catheters, which are threaded through arteries into the
heart. These catheters will be used to monitor the heart’s electrical
activity to pinpoint the location of irregular heartbeats, and if necessary
can treat the heart by “zapping” the tissue that is malfunctioning.
Visible Light Communications (802.15.7)
Instead of using RF for the communication media, light can be used instead. Light has some
advantages over RF. First, sources of interference that impact RF transmissions have no
impact on transmissions that are based on light. Also, unlike RF devices that decrease the
throughput as the distance between devices increases, devices that rely on light do not vary
the transmission speed.
One of the original WPAN technologies using light is based on a standard known as IrDA.
IrDA is an acronym for the Infrared Data Association, which is a nonprofit consortium
with over 160 member companies that represent computer and telecommunications hard-
ware, software, components, and adapters. The IrDA standards arose from the need to connect
different computer and telecommunications devices together using infrared light. Infrared data
ports conforming to the IrDA specifications were installed on notebook computers, computers,
printers, desktop adapters, cameras, phones, watches, pagers, storage devices, and kiosks.
These IrDA devices can transmit from 9.6 Kbps to 16 Mbps.
IrDA devices communicate using infrared light emitting diodes (LEDs) to send and photo-
diodes to receive signals. The transceivers are not flush with the edge of the device but
instead are recessed into the device. They are then covered with a transparent window
surrounded by opaque material, as seen in Figure 13-6. Several design factors, which are
not readily apparent, can improve the performance of IrDA devices. The transparent window
placed in front of the IR module should be flat instead of curved because a curved window
may alter the radiation pattern of the LED. Also, the color of the window is violet because this
color will allow for a minimal loss of the signal when transmitting. And, because bright sur-
rounding light (known as ambient light) can interfere with the infrared signal, the module is
recessed into the device case by several millimeters to create an overhang over the photodiode
that will minimize the amount of direct ambient light that the receiver sees. The transparent
window will also help reflect ambient light away from the diodes.

Although initially IrDA ports were still found on many devices, its popularity significantly
diminished due to its drawbacks:
●
IrDA technology was designed to work like the standard serial port on a personal
computer. These ports are seldom used today.
●
IrDA devices cannot send and receive at the same time because the transmitter and
receiver are not optically isolated.
●
Strong ambient light can negatively impact the transmissions.
●
The angle at which the sending and receiving IrDA devices align or face each other
is very important. When the two devices have a deflection angle of no more than
15 degrees, the distance between devices can be up to 3 feet (1 meter).
However, a new type of WPAN based not on infrared light but on visible light (which is
adjacent to infrared on the frequency spectrum) is gaining popularity. It is known as visible
light communications (VLC) and standards are being developed by the IEEE committee
802.15.7. VLC transmits data by the intensity of the modulating optical source, such as
LEDs and laser diodes (LDs). Because this modulation is faster than the human eye can detect,
humans cannot perceive a transmission taking place. A comparison of VLC to the frequency
and wavelength of other wireless technologies is shown in Figure 13-7, while a comparison of
different data rates and distances is provided in Figure 13-8.
The first device for using light for voice communications was devel-
oped by Alexander Graham Bell in 1880. Known as the photophone,
it used sunlight reflecting off a vibrating mirror to send to a parabolic
mirror at a distance of 700 feet (213 meters).
VLC can operate in one of three different topologies. In a peer-to-peer topology, the commu-
nication is between only two VLC devices. Each device supports a single light source, while
one of the peers acts as a coordinator. This is good for a high data rate over a short distance.

In a star topology, all of the devices communicate with a single central controller, called the
coordinator. Each VLC star network operates independently from all other star networks. In
a broadcast topology the device in a broadcast mode can transmit a signal to other devices
without actually forming a network. This communication is unidirectional and the destination
address of the receiving devices is not required.
VLC has several advantages:
●
Visible light is harmless to the human body.
●
VLC networks can be created to transmit data by adding optical communication
devices to the sockets of existing light fixtures.
●
No electromagnetic interference (EMI) impacts VLC.
●
There are no regulations regarding the use of light.

The signals cannot be intercepted because the transmission range is narrowly confined
so transmissions are secure.
Wireless Metropolitan Area Networks
Wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs) cover an area of up to about 35 miles (56 kilo-
meters) as the distance between devices. WMANs are often used as an alternative (or backup)
to an organization’s fiber optic cable connection between two or more remote locations. The
two primary WMAN technologies are free space optics and broadband radio service.
The challenges of installing fiber optic cables are covered in
Chapter 1.
Free Space Optics (FSO)
Whereas VLC is used for indoor communications, free space optics (FSO) is an optical,
wireless, point-to-point, line-of-sight wireless technology for outdoor transmissions. It was
originally developed over 30 years ago by the military and today serves as an alternative to
high-speed fiber optic cable. Currently FSO can transmit at speeds comparable to fiber optic
transmissions of up to 1.25 Gbps at a distance of 2.5 miles (4 kilometers).
FSO uses infrared transmission instead of RF, sending low-powered infrared beams through
the open air. These beams, which do not harm the human eye, are transmitted by transcei-
vers, as shown in Figure 13-9. Because FSO is a line-of-sight technology, the link heads must
be mounted high in office buildings to provide a clear transmission path. However, unlike
other technologies that require the units to be located on an open roof (which sometimes
requires leasing roof space from the building’s owner), FSO link heads can be mounted
behind a window in an existing office.

Under ideal conditions, FSO could transmit up to 6.2 miles
(10 kilometers).
There are several advantages of FSO:
●
Lower installation costs. FSO installations cost significantly less than installing new
fiber optic cables or even leasing lines from a local carrier. One project compared the
costs of installing fiber optic cables to FSO in three buildings and found the cost of
the former was almost $400,000 whereas the cost of FSO was less than $60,000.
●
Faster installation. FSO can be installed in days or weeks compared to months and
sometimes years for fiber optic cables. In some instances, FSO systems have been installed
over a weekend in major office buildings with no disruption of service to the users.
●
Scaling transmission speed. The transmission speed can be scaled to meet the user’s
needs, anywhere from 10 Mbps to 1.25 Gbps. If high speeds are not required, the user
does not have to pay a premium for unused capacity as when leasing a line from a
carrier but instead can design the FSO system to match needs.
●
Good security. Security is a key advantage in an FSO system. IR transmissions cannot
be intercepted and decoded as with some RF transmissions.
The primary disadvantage of FSO is that atmospheric conditions can affect FSO transmissions.
Turbulence caused by wind and temperature variations can create pockets of air with rapidly
changing densities. These air pockets can act like prisms and lenses to distort an FSO signal.
Inclement weather is also a threat. Although rain and snow can distort a signal, fog does the
most damage to transmission. Fog is composed of extremely small moisture particles that act
like prisms upon the light beam, scattering and breaking up the signal. However, FSO can
overcome turbulence by sending the data in parallel streams from several separate laser trans-
mitters. These transmitters are mounted in the same link head but separated from one another
by several centimeters. It is unlikely that while traveling to the receiver all the parallel beams
will encounter the same pocket of turbulence, since the pockets tend to be small.
Broadband Radio Service (BRS)
Broadband Radio Service (BRS) is a wireless technology that uses microwave frequencies.
Formerly known as Multichannel Multipoint Distribution Service (MMDS), BRS is com-
monly used as a wireless alternative to cable television reception. However, BRS can transmit
video, voice, or data signals at 1.5 Mbps downstream and 300 Kbps upstream at distances of
up to 35 miles (56 kilometers).
BRS/MMDS was originally designed in the 1960s to provide transmission for 33 one-way
analog television channels. This multiple-channel (multichannel) technology was designed for
educational institutions to provide long-distance learning. However, the original vision was
never fully materialized. Later, private companies purchased part of this spectrum to compete
against wired cable television companies (BRS is sometimes called wireless cable). In 1998 the
Federal Communications Commission (FCC) allowed service providers to use the 200 MHz
of bandwidth in the frequency bands to provide two-way services such as wireless Internet
access along with voice and video transmissions.
Today BRS is used as an option in both home and business settings. In the home, it can serve
as an alternative to wired Internet service (such as cable modems and Digital Subscriber Lines),

particularly in rural areas where cabling is scarce. It is also used to transmit over 300 channels
of digital video. For businesses, BRS is an alternative to copper or fiber optic connections.
MMDS uses the 2.1 GHz and 2.5 GHz through 2.7 GHz bands to offer two-way service.
BRS hubs are typically located on top of mountains, towers, buildings, or other high points.
The hub uses a point-to-multipoint architecture that multiplexes communications to multiple
users. The tower has a backhaul connection to the carrier’s network, and the carrier network
connects with the Internet. Because they operate at a lower frequency, BRS signals can travel
longer distances. This means that BRS can provide service to an entire area with only a few
radio transmitters. MMDS uses cells like cellular telephony; however, a BRS cell size can
cover over 3,800 square miles (6,000 square kilometers) in area.
The advantages to BRS are its long range of transmission, its large cell size, and the fact that
it is less vulnerable to poor weather conditions. However, it still requires a direct line of sight
and the wireless transmissions are generally not encrypted.
In the near future, WMANs may be using white space spectrum, which
consists of the vacant airwaves between television channels that were
intended to prevent interference. In 2010, the FCC approved this spec-
trum for unlicensed use, and by late 2011 the first WMAN white space
device was approved by the FCC. In 2012 a law was passed that autho-
rized the FCC to sell 120 MHz of spectrum from unused TV channels 31 to 51 but the white space
spectrum was to remain unlicensed. The IEEE task group 802.11af is currently defining modifica-
tions to the 802.11 physical layers (PHY) and the 802.11 Medium Access Control (MAC) layer to
meet the legal requirements for channel access and coexistence in this TV white space spectrum.
Wireless Wide Area Networks
Wireless networks that transmit beyond the range of WMANs are generally known as wire-
less wide area networks (WWANs). Wireless technologies in this category typically supports
mobile users with either a WWAN wireless modem in a laptop, a tablet with built-in
WWAN connectivity, or a digital cellular smartphone. The primary technologies for WWAN
are WiMAX and long term evolution (LTE).
WiMAX (802.16)
WiMAX (Worldwide Interoperability for Microwave Access) is based on the IEEE 802.16
standards. The MAC layer of WiMAX is different than that used in IEEE 802.11a/b/g
(CSMA/CA) or Ethernet (CSMA/CD). Instead, WiMAX uses a scheduling system and the
device only has to compete once for initial entry into the network. Once the device has been
accepted it is allocated a time slot. Although this time slot can expand and shrink, it remains
assigned to that device and other devices must take their turn. This type of scheduling algo-
rithm is more stable under heavy loads and is more efficient with bandwidth. The scheduling
algorithm also allows the base station to control Quality of Service (QoS) by balancing the
assignments among the needs of the subscriber stations.
WiMAX has counterparts in other nations as well. The WiMAX
equivalent in Europe is HIPERMAN. Korea’s standard, WiBro, has
already agreed upon interoperability with WiMAX.

WiMAX can be broken down into two categories. Fixed WiMAX, based on IEEE
802.16-2004, can serve as a substitute for fiber optic connections between buildings similar
to FSO and BRS. It provides up to 31 miles (50 kilometers) of linear service area range and
does not require line-of-sight. WiMAX also provides shared data rates up to 70 Mbps.
Mobile WiMAX, which is based on IEEE 802.16e-2005, can connect mobile devices over a
wide area. One mobile WiMAX base station can cover an area of 6 miles (9.6 kilometers).
It can also support users traveling at vehicular speeds of 70 miles per hour (112.6 kilometers
per hour). Mobile WiMax is often promoted as a solution to the last mile connection.
The last mile connection is covered in Chapter 1.
Long Term Evolution (LTE)
Cellular telephones work in a manner that is unlike wired telephones. The coverage area for
cellular telephony is divided into cells. In a typical city the cells, which are hexagon-shaped,
measure 10 square miles (26 square kilometers). At the center of each cell is a cell transmitter
to which the mobile devices in that cell send and receive RF signals. These transmitters are
connected to a base station, and each base station is connected to a mobile telecommunica-
tions switching office (MTSO). The MTSO is the link between the cellular network and the
wired telephone world and controls all of transmitters and base stations in the cellular
network. All of the transmitters and cell phones operate at a low power level that enables
the signal to stay confined to the cell and not interfere with other cells. Because the signal at
a specific frequency does not go outside of the cell area, that same frequency can be used in
other cells at the same time. This is illustrated in Figure 13-10.
Because of frequency reuse, a typical cellular telephone network in
one city uses only 830 frequencies to handle all callers.

As cellular telephony has evolved from analog to more advanced packet-switching digital sys-
tems, digital WWAN technologies can be used to replace these older analog systems. When
first introduced, mobile WiMAX was considered to be the logical choice for the next genera-
tion of cellular systems. In the mid-2000s one U.S. cellular carrier invested over $5 billion in
replacing its infrastructure with WiMAX technology, and later formed a $14.5 billion ven-
ture with another company to combine their mobile WiMAX operations.
However, by early 2008, the two largest carriers in North America announced that they
would adopt a competing technology instead. These carriers said that this technology,
known as 3rd Generation Partnership Project Long Term Evolution (3GPP LTE), was a
more natural upgrade for their current network technology and also supported the dominant
mobile standard worldwide that serves over three billion global customers.
Although LTE is commonly referred to as a fourth generation (4G)
technology, technically the current version of LTE does not meet all
the requirements for 4G. It is anticipated that the next generation of
LTE, known as LTE Advanced, will meet these requirements.
In order to achieve higher data rates, LTE incorporates several elements found in IEEE
802.11n WLANs. LTE uses orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) and breaks
down the transmission into separate parts to send each part in parallel simultaneously.
Instead of sending one long stream of data, OFDM sends the transmission in parallel across
several channels. LTE also utilizes Multiple-Input Multiple-Output (MIMO), which is charac-
terized by having a radio chain for each antenna.
OFDM is covered in Chapter 5 and MIMO is covered in Chapter 4.

Sixty years ago video content was distributed to homes through broadcast television stations. In
the 1980s, a shift occurred with video being delivered through cable and later satellite connections.
Today another shift is occurring, with the Internet becoming the popular means for streaming
movies and TV shows. It is estimated that global Internet traffic will increase by 32 percent annu-
ally through the year 2015, when traffic will reach almost 1 zettabyte (Table 13-6 lists different
capacities). Almost 90 percent of global consumer Internet traffic in 2015 will be video content.ii
By 2015, the data equivalent of every movie ever filmed will cross
through the Internet every 5 minutes.
Due to the popularity of wireless networking, much of this Internet digital content is carried
across WLANs to televisions, set-top boxes, smartphones, and tablets. Current IEEE
802.11a/b/g/n network technology often cannot keep up with delivering this content, particu-
larly high-definition (HD) video, and may result in deteriorated performance, choppy videos,
and slow load times. Alternatives to IEEE 802.11 WLANs such as Wireless HDMI and
WiGig are available but have not proven to be popular.
In January 2011, the IEEE Task Group for 802.11ac published its first draft of IEEE 802.11ac,
known as Very High Throughput <6Ghz, to support higher data rates, in part to address the
demand for wireless video delivery. Building upon many of the enhancements introduced
in 802.11n, this new standard has advertised data rates over 1 Gbps. Some of 802.11ac’s
technologies include:
●
Spectrum. 802.11ac will operate in the less-crowded 5 GHz spectrum. It will not support
the 2.4 GHz spectrum.
●
Increased channel bandwidth. Whereas 802.11n uses channels up to 40-MHz-wide
channels, the 802.11ac standard uses channel bandwidths up to 80 MHz. To achieve
this, it was necessary to adapt automatic radio tuning capabilities so that higher-
bandwidth channels are only used when necessary in order to conserve spectrum use.
●
MU-MIMO. A variation of MIMO known as Multi-User MIMO (MU MIMO) is
implemented in 802.11ac. MU-MIMO enables the simultaneous transmission of
different data frames to different clients. This requires that equipment is able
to utilize the spatial awareness of the different remote users. It also implements

sophisticated queuing systems that can take advantage of opportunities to transmit
to multiple clients when the conditions are right.
●
Error correction coding. Advances in chip manufacturing technology have enabled
designers to take advantage of additional levels of processing power so that more
sensitive coding techniques that depend on finer distinctions in the received signal can
be used. This reduces the number of error correction check bits needed.
●
Beam forming. Under 802.11n, transmit beam forming (TxBF) was available, but
many products did not take advantage of it. With IEEE 802.11ac, TxBF is a standard
feature, and all products that implement it will be interoperable. This can result in
increased range and coverage area.
TxBF is covered in Chapter 4.
●
Improved battery life. Because of its increased speed in file transfers and similar activities,
mobile users may find that by using 802.11ac they can increase their battery life (because
it takes less time for activities that require the device to draw significant battery power).
IEEE 802.11ac will be backwards compatible with 802.11n devices
only operating in the 5 GHz spectrum.
Table 13-7 lists several of the technologies anticipated in 802.11ac compared to 802.11n.
The advertised data rate of 802.11ac is often stated as 1 Gbps. As
with 802.11n, the actual data rate depends on the modulation, cod-
ing, and number of spatial streams. For example, 4 spatial streams
using 40 MHz channels with 400 ns guard intervals can result in a
600 Mbps data rate for 802.11n. The top speed for 802.11ac is
expected to be as high as 3.6 Gbps.
It is anticipated that the final IEEE 802.11ac standard will be released in 2012, with ratifica-
tion in late 2013. However, devices from vendors based on the draft standard are expected
to appear sooner.

Chapter Summary
■There are four broad categories of wireless technology. Wireless personal area networks
(WPANs) are designed for hand-held and portable devices at slow to moderate (1 Mbps)
transmission speeds with the maximum distance range between devices of about 33 feet
(10 meters). Wireless local area network (WLANs), such as IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n, are for
portable or stationary devices that are within a few hundred feet of each other or a cen-
trally located access point (AP). Depending upon the standard, transmission speeds may
range up to 600 Mbps. Wireless metropolitan area networks (WMANs) is designed for
devices in a range of up to 35 miles (56 kilometers) using radio frequency (RF) or infrared
transmission technology at different speeds. Wireless wide area networks (WWANs) are
wireless facilities that connect networks in different parts of a country or of the world.
The transmission speeds again vary, although often are slower than those for a WMAN.
■Bluetooth is a wireless technology that uses short-range RF transmissions and provides
for rapid ad hoc device pairings. The current version is Bluetooth v4.0 yet all Blue-
tooth devices are backward compatible with previous versions. Most Bluetooth devices
have a range of 33 feet (10 meters) and a rate of transmission of 1 Mbps. There are
two types of Bluetooth network topologies. The first is known as a Bluetooth piconet.
When two Bluetooth devices come within range of each other, they automatically
connect to each another. A group of piconets in which connections exist between
different piconets is called a Bluetooth scatternet, the second type of Bluetooth topology.
Bluetooth uses FHSS. The major drawback for Bluetooth is its slow speed. Ultra-
wideband (UWB) or 802.15.3c-2009 is considered a high-rate WPAN with speeds
over 2 Gbps. UWB has not been widely implemented. Because it distributes a signal
across a wide range of spectrum (sometimes several gigahertz) there is concern of
widespread interference on other transmissions.
■There are many settings in which low speed and low power are desirable in a network
setting. The IEEE 802.15.4 family of devices operates up to 164 feet (50 meters) at
different frequencies, depending upon the data rate. ZigBee is a low-power, short-
range, and low-data rate specification. It is based on 802.15.4 but includes standards
for network configuration, security and other higher-level features that are not covered
by IEEE standard. ZigBee’s data rate is 250 kbps and is best designed for occasional
data or signal transmission from a sensor or input device. Although currently not
governed by an established IEEE standard, the 802.15.4f group is working on stan-
dards that relate to RFID. RFID tags can be either active or passive: passive RFID
tags do not have their own power supply while active RFID tags have their own power
source. A similar technology based on RFID standards is near field communication
(NFC). NFC is a set of standards primarily for smartphones and smart cards that is
used to establish communication between devices.
■The IEEE 802.15.6 group is currently creating standards for body area networks
(BAN). A BAN is a network system of devices in close proximity to a person’s body
that cooperate for the benefit of the user. BANs are commonly used for sports and
fitness monitoring as well as healthcare applications. Instead of using RF for the com-
munication media, light can be used instead. One of the original WPAN technologies
using light is based on a standard known as IrDA. Infrared data ports conforming to
the IrDA specifications were installed on computers and a variety of consumer devices.

However, its popularity diminished due to its drawbacks. A new type of WPAN based
not on infrared light but on visible light is gaining popularity. Known as visible light
communications (VLC) its standards are being developed by IEEE 802.15.7.
■WMANs are often used as an alternative (or backup) to an organization’s fiber optic
cable connection between two or more remote locations. There are two primary WMAN
technologies. Free space optics (FSO) is an optical, wireless, point-to-point, line-of-sight
wireless technology for outdoor transmissions. FSO uses infrared transmission instead of
RF, sending low-powered infrared beams through the open air. Broadband Radio Service
(BRS) is a wireless technology that uses microwave frequencies and is commonly used as
a wireless alternative to cable television reception. BRS is used as an option in both home
and business settings. In the home, it can serve as an alternative to wired Internet service
(such as cable modems and Digital Subscriber Lines), particularly in rural areas where
cabling is scarce. For businesses, BRS is an alternative to copper or fiber optic connections.
■Wireless networks that transmit beyond the range of WMANs are known as wireless
wide area networks (WWANs) and the wireless technologies in this category typically
supports mobile users with either a WWAN wireless modem in a laptop, a tablet with
built-in WWAN connectivity, or a digital cellular smartphone. WiMAX (Worldwide
Interoperability for Microwave Access) is based on the IEEE 802.16 standards. Fixed
WiMAX, based on IEEE 802.16-2004, can serve as a substitute for fiber optic
connections between buildings similar to FSO and BRS. It provides up to 31 miles
(50 kilometers) of linear service area range and does not require line-of-sight. Mobile
WiMAX, which is based on IEEE 802.16e-2005, can connect mobile devices over a
wide area. Another technology is 3rd Generation Partnership Project Long Term
Evolution (3GPP LTE). In order to achieve the higher data rates that LTE offers it
incorporates several elements that are found in IEEE 802.11n WLANs, such as
OFDM and MIMO.
■The explosion of digital video content on the Internet has resulted in much of this
content being carried across WLANs to televisions, set-top boxes, smartphones, and
tablets. Current IEEE 802.11a/b/g/n network technology may not be able to keep
up with delivering this content, particularly HD video. In early 2011 the IEEE Task
Group for 802.11ac published its first draft of IEEE 802.11ac, known as Very High
Throughput <6Ghz, to support higher data rates, in part to address the demand for
wireless video delivery. Building upon many of the enhancements introduced in
802.11n, this new standard has advertised data rates over 1 Gbps.

Hands-On Projects
Project 13-1: Viewing Bluetooth Devices Using
BluetoothView
Bluetooth devices are commonly used as a wireless mouse or keyboard for
tablet, laptop or desktop computers. In this project you will install software
to view Bluetooth devices in the area that can be detected by the computer. To complete
this project, you will need a computer that either has built-in Bluetooth technology or a
Bluetooth USB adapter. (If you are already using a Bluetooth mouse or similar device on a
computer that does not have integrated Bluetooth, you will have a Bluetooth USB adapter.)
In addition, you will need a separate Bluetooth device, such as a Bluetooth mouse, key-
board, or smartphone that supports Bluetooth.
1. Turn on or install the Bluetooth mouse, keyboard, or similar device on the computer.
2. Go to www.nirsoft.net/utils/bluetooth_viewer.html.
It is not unusual for Web sites to change the location of where files
are stored. If the URL above no longer functions then open a search
engine and search for “NirSoft BluetoothView”.
3. Scroll down and click Download BluetoothView. (Note that this is different from the
green button that says “Download”.)
4. When the file finishes downloading, locate the compressed (ZIP) file and extract the files.
5. Return to the NirSoft Web site and scroll up to the section The ‘Company Name’ Column.
6. Right-click http://standards.ieee.org/develop/regauth/oui/oui.txt.
7. Click Save link as (or Save target as, depending on your browser).
8. Save this file as oui.txt in the same folder that contains files extracted above.
9. Launch the application by double-clicking BluetoothView.exe.
10. Wait several seconds for the Bluetooth device to appear. What information about the
device is transmitted through this Bluetooth piconet?
11. Scroll across to the Company Name column. Record the company name that was displayed.
12. Open the file oui.txt and then search for that company name. What is the company id
for this company name? Note that Bluetooth only transmits the company id and not
the full name.
13. Return to the BluetoothView application.
14. Add another Bluetooth device to the Bluetooth piconet, such as a smartphone that
supports Bluetooth. It may be necessary to both turn on the Bluetooth capabilities and
to make the device discoverable. Then move the device close to the computer so that it
can be detected, as illustrated in Figure 13-11.
15. What information about this device is transmitted through the Bluetooth piconet?
16. Close all windows.

and Bluetooth devices as in Hands-On Project 13-1 apply to this activity.
1. Turn on or install the Bluetooth mouse, keyboard, or similar device on the computer.
2. Go to www.wifiauditor.com.
It is not unusual for Web sites to change the location of where files
are stored. If the URL above no longer functions then open a search
engine and search for “BlueAuditor”.
3. Click Download BlueAuditor.
4. When the file finishes downloading, launch the setup file to install BlueAuditor.
5. When the installation is complete, start BlueAuditor if necessary.
6. Click Monitoring.
7. Click Run.
8. Click Run in the Devices Search Parameters Dialog box.
9. Wait several seconds for the Bluetooth device to appear. What information about the
device is transmitted through this Bluetooth piconet?
10. Scroll across to identify the different information. How does it compare the Bluetooth-
View application in the previous project?
11. Add another Bluetooth device to the Bluetooth piconet, such as a smartphone that
supports Bluetooth. It may be necessary to both turn on the Bluetooth capabilities and
to make the device discoverable. Then move the device close to the computer so that it
can be detected, as illustrated in Figure 13-12.

Project 13-3: Configuring Access Points—Performance
The ability to properly configure an AP is an important skill for any wireless
network professional as well as, to a lesser degree, for end-users. In this project
you will use an online emulator from D-Link to explore setting performance
parameters for an AP.
1. Use your Web browser to go to www.dlink.com.
It is not unusual for Web sites to change the location of where files
are stored. If the URL above no longer functions then open a search
engine and search for “D-Link emulator”.
2. Click the nation most appropriate for you, if necessary.
3. If you are asked to select the preferred D-Link home page click No, Thank you and
then click Continue.
4. Click the Support tab.
5. Click Go next to Emulators.
6. Scroll down and click DAP-3520. The emulated login screen will appear.
7. Click Login without entering a new username or password. An emulated Setup screen
displaying what a user would see when configuring an actual DAP-3520 is displayed.

10. The default value next to Beacon Interval (25-500) is 100. Beacons are packets sent by
the AP to synchronize the WLAN. Using a higher beacon interval may help to save the
battery power of a mobile wireless client. A lower setting can enable a client connect to
an AP more quickly. In which type of WLAN would a higher setting be preferable?
When would a lower setting be better?
11. The default value next DTIM Interval (1-15) is 1. DTIM Interval indicates the number
of AP beacons between each Delivery Traffic Indication Message (DTIM). The DTIM
tells the clients of the next window for listening to broadcast and multicast messages.
The AP will send the next DTIM with the specified DTIM value to clients if there are
any buffered message waiting for them at the AP. Clients will hear the beacons and be
prepared to receive the broadcast or multicast messages. The default value for DTIM
interval is 1. When would you set this value higher?
12. The Ack TimeOut (2.4GHz, 64~200) indicates a value to optimize throughput over long
distance links. When would you set this value higher? When would it be set lower?
13. The Short GI specifies using a short guard interval (400ns) to increase overall throughput.
However, enabling this parameter can also have a negative impact. What would be the
downside of having a short GI?
14. The Internet Group Management Protocol (IGMP) is a protocol used by devices and
routers to exchange information. IGMP snooping allows the AP to recognize IGMP
queries and reports sent between routers and wireless devices. When it is enabled the
AP can forward multicast packets to the IGMP host based on the IGMP messages that
pass through the AP. Would this be desirable?
15. The Connection Limit allows a maximum number of devices to connect to the AP.
When should this be set to a low value? When should it be set to a high value?
16. Close all windows.
Case Projects
Case Project 13-1: Bluetooth Security
Besides bluejacking and bluesnarfing, there are other security issues that
Bluetooth could face as its popularity continues to increase. Use the Internet
to research Bluetooth security. What are the attacks that could be launched
against Bluetooth? What are the defenses against these attacks? Will they have an impact
on Bluetooth’s popularity? Write a one-page paper on your research.
Case Project 13-2: Future of UWB
In addition to concerns regarding interference, other factors have contributed to the stalled
growth of UWB. What are these factors? Does UWB have a future or will it be replaced by
other technologies? Using the Internet research the problems of UWB, the source of those
problems, and what the future holds for UWB. Give your opinion about you believe will
happen with this technology. Write a one-page paper on your findings.

Case Project 13-3: RFID Passports
Although several nations use RFID technology with their paper passports, there was a
concern initially voiced that unauthorized individuals could intercept these transmissions
and use them in nefarious ways against the passport holders. In response the United States
made modifications to the RFID technology in its passports. Research RFID technology in
passports, and particularly note the changes the United States made to make them more
secure. In your opinion, are these additional security protections adequate? Why or why
not? Write a one-page paper on RFID passports.
Case Project 13-4: Body Area Networks
Body area networks (BANs) hold the promise of providing significant benefits particularly in
the healthcare area to provide patients with more immediate care. Using the Internet,
research BANs. What are some ways in which they are being used today? What are some
new technologies that may be introduced in the new feature utilizing BANs? And what
concerns are there about these networks from a social and a security perspective? Write a
one-page paper on BANs.
Case Project 13-5: IEEE 802.11ac
The new IEEE 802.11ac standard provides significantly improved data rates and broader
coverage areas than previous 802.11 standards. Use the Internet to research this new tech-
nology, how it can be used, and what its strengths and weaknesses are. Write a one-page
paper on your research.
Case Project 13-6: Nautilus IT Consulting
The computer technology business Nautilus IT Consulting (NITC) needs your help with one
of their clients.
Hermitage Endoscopy Associates (HEA) is a medical practice in the area. HEA has used
IEEE 802.11g technology for both its office use as well as for patients in its waiting room.
In addition to standard data utilization, HEA wants to provide both still images as well as
video to its physicians on tablet computers as they work with patients. However, it is unsure
if IEEE 802.11n or 802.11ac would be the preferred technology.
1. Create a PowerPoint presentation that explains the features of IEEE 802.11ac, how it
works, and what its advantages and disadvantages are. Because the HEA is part of a
regional hospital the hospital’s healthcare IT staff, who have a strong technology back-
ground, will be present so your presentation should be more technical in nature. The
presentation should be 8–10 slides in length.
2. HEA has also asked NITC for information regarding BANs and if they could be used
in their practice. They already use the video pill but want to know if there are other
technologies that would be of benefit in endoscopy. Create a one-page memo about
BANs and how they could be used for HEA.
The video pill is covered in Chapter 1.
