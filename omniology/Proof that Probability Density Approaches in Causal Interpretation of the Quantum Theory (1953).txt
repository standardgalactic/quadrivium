has its origin
in the fluorescent

using the same brass

Proof That Probability
Density Approaches
zt ' in Causal Interpretation
of the Quantum
Theory
DAVID

(Received June 25, 1952)
In two previous
papers a causal interpretation
of the quantum
theory
was
developed
which
involved
the
hypothesis
that
a
quantum-mechanical
system contains a precisely
defined particle
variable x but that, at present, we are restricted to calculating
the
probability
density P(x, t) that the particle
is at the position x.
It was
shown
that
the
assumption
that P(x, t)= ~P(x, t) ~z is
consistent,
in the sense that if it holds initially,
the equations
of
motion
of the particles
will cause this relation
to be maintained
for all time. In this paper, we extend the theory by showing
that
as a result of random
collisions,
an arbitrary
probability
density
will ultimately
decay into one with a density
of
~ P(x, t)
~ . Since
all
quantum-mechanical
experiments
to date
have
been
con-
cerned with statistical
ensembles
of systems
that have been col-
liding
with
other
systems
for a very
long time, it is therefore
. inevitable
that
as we draw
samples
from
such
ensembles,
the
probability
density
of systems
with particles at the point x will
be equal to
~ P(x, t) ~z.
'In the previous
papers
we also pointed
out that,
within
the
conceptual
framework
of the causal interpretation,
it was possible
to suggest mathematical
theories more general than are permitted
by the usual interpretation
and that these more general
theories
might be needed in the domain of 10 "cm, where present theories
seem to fail. However,
if these more general theories should apply
at the level of 10 "cm, then there would be a tendency
to create
discrepancies
between P and
~ P
~ z, a tendency
whose cumulative
e6ects should
be felt even at the atomic
level, where
the more
general
theory
ought
to approach
the usual
theory.
However,
because those discrepancies
have been shown to die out as a result
of collisions,
we can expect that under normal
conditions
the dif-
ference between P and
~ P~' would
be negligible.
Conditions
are
suggested,
however,
in which this difference might be appreciable,
and experiments
are indicated
which might be able to test for the
existence of such discrepancies.
I. INTRODUCTION
' 'N two recent papers, ' (to be denoted
hereafter
by I
and II, respectively)
the
author
has
proposed
a
causal reinterpretation
of the quantum
theory,
based
on the following
hypotheses:
(a) A quantum-mechanical
system,
such as an elec-
tron, consists basically
of a particle having
a precisely
de6ned position, which varies continuously
as a function
of the time.
(b) This particle is acted on not only by the classical
potential
U(x, t) but also by an additional
quantum-
potential
U(x, t), which
is important
at the
atomic
level but negligible
at the macroscopic
level.
' D. Bohm, Phys. Rev. 85, 166 (1952) (paper I); 85, 180 (1952)
(paper II). See also, Phys. Rev. 87, 389 (1952).
(c) If we write /=Re's'",
where
lt is the wave func-
tion and 8 and 5 are real, then the quantum
potential
is given by
U(x, t) =—(h,'/2rrs) V'R(x, t)/R(x, t)
(1).
The equation
of motion
of the particle
then takes the
form
srsd'x/dtz= —V(U(x, t)+ U(x, t)).
(2)
To obtain the same predictions
for all experimental
results as are obtained
from the usual interpretation
of
the quantum
theory it is necessary,
however,
to make
the following
additional
special assumptions
(see paper
I, p. 171):
(1) The
tlr field satisfies Schrodinger's
equation.
(2) The particle velocity is restricted to v = VS(x)/srz.

DENS I TY
(3) We do not predict or control the precise location
of a particle, but have a statistical
ensemble of particles
with a probability
density, P(x) =
~ f(x)
~ '.
It was suggested
in paper I, Sec. 4, that if we gave
up
the
special
assumptions
listed
above,
the
causal
interpretation
of the quantum
theory would permit the
construction
of new types of theories
which
might
be
needed
in the treatment
of certain
domains,
such as
that involving
distances of the order of 10 "cm, where
existing
theories
do not
seem
to be adequate.
In
support of this suggestion
it was actually demonstrated
in paper I, Sec. 9, that theories could be formulated,
in
which
assumptions
(1) and
(2) ceased to be valid at
the level of 10 " cm but became approximately
valid
at the atomic level, where
the usual
theory
is known
to be applicable.
No similar proof was given in papers
I and II, however,
with
regard
to assumption
(3),
although
the conjecture
was made in paper II, Sec. 7,
that the effects of collisions and other random processes
would
be to cause any differences
between P(x) and
~ P(x) ~' to decay with the passage of time, and thus to
tend to establish
the validity
of assumption
(3) at the
atomic level, even under
conditions
in which it failed
in the domain
of 10 " cm. The object of the present
paper is to prove the above conjecture.
We begin our proof by noting
that,
in general,
the
probability
density P(x) may be an arbitrary
function,
restricted
only by the requirement
that it satisfies the
conservation
equation
(BP/Bt)+ div(Pv) =0.
(3)
But as shown
in paper I, Sec. 4, provided
that P is a
solution
of Schrodinger's
equation
and that v= 7'S/m,
(i.e., provided
assumptions
(1) and (2) are val'id), the
function
~P(x, t) ~' will satisfy
a similar
conservation
equation
a ( P ( '/at+ div() P ( 'V'5/m)
=8( f['/Bt+div()PJ'v) =0.
(4)
Clearly, then if P(x) is chosen initially
equal to
~ P{x)~,
the two will remain. equal for all time; and thus,
the
consistency
of assumption
(3) is demonstrated.
Any
failure of assumptions
(1) and (2) would, however,
also
result in the failure of (3), since P(x) would be still con-
served,
while
~P(x) ~', in general,
would
not. Thus, if
deviations
from (1) and (2) really existed, for example,
at the level
of 10 " cm, differences
between I' and
~P~' would
arise
whose
cumulative
effects would
in
general
be felt even at the atomic level,
unless
there
exist
opposing
processes
which
tend
continually
to
re-establish
the equality
of P and
~P~'. As we have
already pointed out, we shall demonstrate
in this paper
that randomly
distributed
collisions
furnish
just such
opposing
processes,
which
in the absence of perturba-
tions from the level of 10 "cm would cause an arbitrary
probability
density P(x, t) to decay into
~ P(x, t)
~
with
the passage of time. Clearly
this result constitutes
an
important
part
of the
causal
interpretation
of the
quantum
theory,
since it shows that the causal inter-
pretation
could have an experimental
content different
from that of the usual
interpretation
at 10 " cm and
still lead to agreement
with
a11 experimental
data that
can now be understood
in terms
of the usual
inter-
pretation.
To show the importance
of collisions
in determining
the probability
density, we first note that all experiments
in quantum
mechanics
to date have
been
concerned
with
statistics
of systems
(such as hydrogen
atoms)
drawn
from
large
aggregates
of matter,
where
they
have been interacting
with
other
systems
for a very
long time. When we do an experiment
now, we have no
choice but to drawn our samples from such an ensemble,
whose members
have undergone
this lengthy
process of
collision
with
other
atoms,
electromagnetic
waves,
sound
waves,
and other disturbances
which
can alter
the physical
condition
of the members
of our ensemble.
Now, each collision
of, for example,
a hydrogen
atom
with
another
atom
can
change
the positions
of the
precisely
defined
particles
located
in each atom
in a
way that depends
on the collision parameter
and on the
initial velocity of approach.
Since there is a statistical
ensemble
of different
kinds
of collisions,
we conclude
that even if all the particles
in our ensemble
initially
has the same positions,
they would have some kind of
distribution
after collision.
To study
how this probability
distribution
changes
in a collision,
we shall
find it convenient
to define a
function f(x, t) through
the equation
P(x, t)=
~ lP(x, t)
~ 'y(x, t)
Since P(x, t) satisfies
the
conservation
equation
(3),
while
~f(x, t) ~' satisfies
the similar Eq. (4), we read-
ily find by subtracting
(4) from (3) that
Bf/Bt+v V'f=0.
(6)
But the above
is just df/df,
the rate of change
of f
which results from following a particle orbit. We obtain,
therefore, df/dt=0
and
f(x, t) =f(x'i t'),
where x' is the position of a particle at the time t' which
arrives at the position x at the time t.
Equation
(7) is analogous
to Liouville's
theorem
in
classical
statistical
mechanics,
with
the
important
difference that in quantum
theory, the ratio f=P/
~ P
~ '
is what
remains
constant
when
we follow
a moving
particle, while in classical statistical
mechanics it is the
density
p(x, p, t) of points
in phase space that remains
constant. However,
by methods that are very similar to
those that can be used in classical statistical
mechanics
to show that p(x, p, t) approaches
a constant'
along any
~ Note that this result is not to be confused with the statement
that p(x, p, t) remains
constant
when x(t) and p(t) are solutions
of
the equations
of motion. For in this case, even though
p depends
on x, p, and t, the dependence
is such that there is no net change
in p when
we follow a trajectory
of a particle
in phase
space.
However,
after
many
collisions,
the functional
form of p itself

surface of constant
energy,
we shall show in this paper
that f(x, t) approaches
a constant,
so that P approaches
fff'. Moreover,
once P has become equal to fPf', no
disturbance
satisfying
conditions
(1) and
(2)
can
possibly produce a diR'erence
between
these two quan-
tities, because the relation P=
f P
f ' is then maintained
for all time by the equations
of motion of the particles.
The above results
are deduced
with
the aid of as-
sumptions
(1) and
(2), which
certainly
hold
in the
atomic domain. If, in this domain, perturbations
arising
at the level
of 10—"cm should
create
discrepancies
between P and
ff f ', we should
then expect that these
discrepancies
would die out in some mean time T, which
js determined
by the
solutions
of the
equations
of
motion
of the various
particles
involved
and by the
rates of collisions of these particles. In the steady state,
the difference P—
f P
f ' will be determined
by the balance
between
the mean rate E., at which perturbations
surge
up
from
the
level
of 10 " cm, and
the mean
rate
(P
ff f ')/T,
a—t
which
a
perturbation
already
in
existence dies out. This yields
P—
f P f'=ET.
Now in the absence of any specific hypothesis
as to what
is happening
at 10 "cm, it is impossible
for us to know
anything
about
E, except
that
with
the
limitless
number
of conceivable
hypotheses
available
any value
at all is possible. Thus, if we assume
the causal inter-
pretation,
we can always regard any experiments
which
show that P is equal to
f P f' as u posteriori evidence that
8 is so small
that
discrepancies
between P and
f |t f'
have not yet been detected. This means that no experi-
ment
can possibly
show that the usual
interpretation
must be chosen in preference
to the causal interpreta-
tion. On the other hand,
an experimentally
observed
discrepancy
between P and
f P
f ' would clearly indicate
that the usual interpretation
was untenable
and that a
causal interpretation
was probably
needed. '
An actual experimental
test of the relation P=
f P
f '
would
be impracticably
diS.cult at present,
but
as
shown
in paper II, the usual
formulas
for transition
probabilities
are, in the causal
interpretation,
conse-
quencies
of the
assumption
that P= fff'. Hence,
if
this assumption
is not entirely
true, we should
expect
to 6nd discrepancies,
probably
rather
small,
between
the observed
mean rates of transitions
and the rates
predicted
by present
theories.
We must
study
these
discrepancies
under
conditions
in which P is known
to
a high degree of accuracy. From this point of view, the
changes
arid approaches
a constant
along any surface of constant
energy.
Similarly,
from Eq. (7} we see that f(x, t) is a constant
along any particle trajectory
regardless
of the form of f, but we
now assert that after many
collisions,
the functional
form of f
changes in such a way that f approaches
a constant.
'In fact, we can go further
and say that after we reach the
stage of postulating
a particular
example
of a causal theory,
ex-
periments
are conceivable
(as shown
in paper II, Sec. 6) which
would
permit
us to infer
the necessity
of each element
in the
hypothesis
underlying
that particular
theory; or in other words,
to "observe" or detect that element.
best transition
processes
to study
would
probably
be
those
involving
radiation
from
atoms
of hydrogen.
However,
to reduce. the rate at which
discrepancies
between P and
f |f f' die out, we should avoid collisions
by keeping
the
atoms
under
conditions
of extreme
isolation
and avoid the sects of thermal
radiation
by
keeping
them at very
low temperatures.
To increase
the rate 8 at which discrepancies
between P and
f P f'
come up from the level of 10 "cm, we should use atoms
whose
nuclei
are very
highly
excited.

testing
the accuracy of the predictions
of the
usual interpretation
concerning
rates of transition

present
rather
rough
and limited
in quantity,
and of
course, no experiments

view to finding
conditions
that are likely to lead to a

II. PROOF THAT P(x,t) APPROACHES
f 4(x~t) l'
On
the
basis
of the
assumption
that
P satisfies
Schrodinger's
equation
and
that
v=7'5/m,
we
shall
now show with the aid of a simple illustrative
example
that an arditrary
probability
density P(x, t) ultimately
approaches
f f(x, t)
f '. This proof will be generalized
in
a more extensive
paper to be published
elsewhere. '
We choose
for our
example
a hydrogen
molecule
excited to a doubly
degenerate
level of energy
Eo, in
which the component
of the angular
momentum
in the
direction
of the axis of the molecule
is, in the usual
interpretation,
said to be &k. In terms of cylindrical
polar coordinates,
with the s axis along the axis of the
molecule,
the most general
linear combination
of these
two degenerate
eigenfunctions
can be written
as
P=&2g(p, s)(ci cosp+c2 sing)8
where
c& and
c2 are arbitrarily
complex
coefficients,
satisfying

Three types
of
orbits are possible. For &v=0, &2r/2, &2r, we obtain g
constant,
so that
the particle
does not move. For &
close to these
values
(and for p large),
the particle
oscillates
on an arc of a circle. For large
ratios
of
since cos~/p,
the particle
rotates
in a complete
circle
with variable
angular
velocity.
Let us now
consider,
for any given
p, a statistical
ensemble
of particles
all having
the same initial
wave
function,
but
having
an arbitrary
initial
probability
distribution
Pp(@). Although
this distribution
will,
in
general, change with time as a result of particle motions,
it is clear that after the particles return
to their initial
positions,
they will have the same separation
as they
had initially
(since each follows a periodic
orbit with
the same period);
so that as long as the molecule
is
isolated, we shall have only a periodically
varying prob-
ability distribution.
In practice, however,
the molecule
is not really isolated, since it is subjected to a continual
series of collisions
with
other particles. To study
the
effects of these collision, processes,
we must,
of course,
first solve for the changes in the wave function resulting
from the inhuence
of the other particles
and then use
this solution
to calculate the particle motions
through
the relation v= VS/222.
Now,
in our simple
illustrative
example,
it will be
adequate
to assume an incident particle whose mass M
is so great that it can be treated
classically
(noting,
however,
that in our more complete article4 it is shown
that the same results
will follow if this approximation
is not made). In the causal interpretation,
a classical
approximation
for the incident
particle means that we
can neglect the contribution
—(h,'/2M) V 'I 4(x, y, t)
I /
I 4'(x, y, t)
I
of this particle
(whose
coordinates
are denoted
by y)
to the quantum
potential
and that we can approximate
the wave equation
as

)
where y(t) is regarded
only as a parameter,
whose time
dependence
is obtained
by solving
the
equations
of
motion,
and
where
U(x, y) is the classical
potential
energy of interaction
between x and y, and A(x, y) the
classical vector potential
(due to magnetic interactions).
I.et us
further
restrict
ourselves
to
collisions
so
distant that perturbation
theory may be applied.
Now
the major changes
of the wave function
will be due to
transitions
between
degenerate
levels, and as will soon
be evident,
no essential
aspect of the problem
will be
altered
if we made the further
approximation
of neg-
lecting the comparatively
unimportant
transitions
to
levels
of other
energies.
The
changes
in
the
wave
function
will then be determined
by the three matrix
elements
V11(t)= 2
cosset g(p, z)Hr (x, Vx, t)g(p, z) cospdx,

V22(t) = 2

f
V»(t) = V»*(t)=2
cospg(p, z)Hp(x,
Vx& t)
Xg(p, z) sinydx,
(14c)
where
H~(x, V'x, t)
is
the
part
of the
Hamiltonian
operator
corresponding
to
the
perturbation.
These
matrix
elements
define the unitary
transformation
Cl= ~11(t)cl +1212(t)C2 )
C2= &21(t)cl +&22(t)C2 )
where
the
O.„satisfy
the
following
condition
for a
unitary
matrix
I ~» I'+
I ~» I'=
I ~»
I '+
I ~2212=1,
C211C212+C221C222
and where the c,' represent
the values of the coefFicient
of the wave function
at time t' before collision,
while
the c; represent
those values at the time t after collision.
The transformation
matrix n;, (t) can in principle
be
obtained
by
carrying
out
a
series
of
in6nitesimal
unitary
transformations,
with
the
transformation
matrices (1—iV,,(t)dt/It); but because the V;;(t) are all
in general
different
functions
of the time,
the trans-
formation
coefficients
n;;(t) cannot
in general
be ex-
pressed in a closed form. Because the dependence
of V;;
on the time
will depend
on the orbit of the incident
particle, it is clear that the a;,(t) will in general be dif-
ferent for different
kinds of collisions. This means that
the relation
between
c; and c,' will depend
on the col-
lision
parameter
h and on the initial
velocity
of ap-
proach u, which
quantities
determine
the orbit of the
incident
particle
in a collision. Thus, we can write
c =c (c;, h, u).
Because the c, and c
satisfy the identity
lc1I'+ lc2I'
=
I c1'I'+
I c2'I'=1,
which
results
from
the
unitary
character
of the transformation,
it is better,
however,
to work in terms of the three independent
parameters
introduced
in Eq. (12). We obtain
a)'= (a'((a, c21, n2, h, u);
Cx1 = A1 (cgq A1) cx2q hq u) i
c22= 122 ((dq A1q 122) hq u).

or less randomly
distributed
set of values
of h
and u; and as a result even if the c,' were all initially
the same before collisions,
they would
be distributed
statistically
after collisions. ' We are
therefore
led to
define the probability
Q(~, n, , n2, t)d~dnidn2 —
—Q(c,, t)dQ,
~here d'0= dcvdo. ~dn2 that the wave-function
coefficients
lie in the region dQ. Our problem
is then to study
how
the function
Q is changed
during
a collision.
Now
in
any particular
collision,
carrying
the coefFicients from
c,' to c,, the volume
element
dQ' is carried
into some
other volume
element
dQ. It can then easily be shown
that because of the unitary
character
of the collision,
not vanish
identically.
The identical
vanishing
of this
determinant
would
imply
that there was a functional
relationship
between
cv, n&, a2. But as has already been
shown, a three-parameter
distribution
of collisions (over
the variable
h for a given u) will in general produce a
three-parameter
distribution
of the c
for a given c,',
so that there can be no functional
relationship
between
~, ni, n2
and
the
determinant
J(cj~/Bh„Bni/8h„,
Bn2/Bh, ) cannot
vanish
identically.
We can therefore
define the probability,
G(c,', c,, u, t, t')d D'du
=FJ(Bh,/8~, cth„/Bn, BI4/ctn2)dQ'du,
(21a)
that the system makes a collision starting
in the range
dQ'du and ending up with a given set of wave-function
coeScients c,. Clearly, by definition
dQ'= dQ.
(18)
This follows from the fact that a unitary
transformation
produces
a rotation
in
the
four-dimensional
space,
whose
coordinates
are
the
real
and
imaginary
coef-
ficients of the c;.Thus, the volume element in the space
is not changed,
and from this fact we readily
obtain
Eq. (18). Since the number
of systems does not change
in a collision,
we also have Q(c;, t)dQ=Q(c, ', t)dQ' and
therefore obtain for the probability
density of systems,
Q(c,, t) =Q(c,', t').
(19)
Because the matrix
elements
V,,(t) vanish
as t~& ~,
the
coefFicients
c, will
change
only
during
the short
time in which
the potential
is appreciable.
Thus,
if t
represents
any time after the n+" collision
and before
the (n+1)+", while
t' represents
any time before the
e+" collision and after the (e—1)+",we do not need to
consider
the explicit
time
dependence
of Q but
can
write instead
Q.+&(c,)=Q.(c,'),
(2o)
where Q„~i(c,) represents
the value of Q(c;, t) after the
e+" collision.
We must now take into account the fact that there
is a statistical
ensemble
of collisions of different
types.
To do this we define the probability
F(h, u)dhdu
that
a collision occurs with collision parameter
in the range
dh and the velocity of approach
in the range du. The
next step is to eliminate
the components
of the collision
parameter
h, in terms of the variables
~, ni, n~, with
the aid of Eq. (17). This
is permissible
only
if the
Jacobian determinant
J(8'/BIE„Bni/Bh„, Bn2/Bh, ), does
~ It is important
to note here that the range
of values
of c;,
resulting
from a given set of c, covers some three-dimensional
region (or more precisely a set of 6nite measure)
in the space of
co, oI, cd. This can be seen, from the fact that our group
of in-
finitesimal
transformations
is
isomorphic
with
the
group
of
in6nitesimal
rotations
on a two component
spinor. As a result of
the continuous
distribution
over h, we shall have,
in general,
a
continuous
distribution
of the V;;(t) for a given u; and as a result
of the continuous
distribution
over u, a continuous
distribution
of
the V;; for a given h. Thus, for each value of h (or of u), we shall
obtain a three-parameter
distribution
over
co, nI, n2, for a given
~', cxI', ~g' (or of ~',
O.I', 0.2' for a given ~, al, ~g).
G(c, c,, u, t') dQ,'du= 1.
(21b)
The precise form of the function G is determined
by the
distribution
function
Ii and
by the matrix
elements
V,,(t) in a very complicated
way, but the only property
of 6 that is of interest here is the fact that it is a con-
tinuous
function
of all its variables.
This property
of
continuity
follows from the continuity
of F, the con-
tinuity
of the relations
(17), and the existence
of the
determinant
J(Bh /cj~, Bh,/ctni, BI4/Bn, ). The
con-
tinuity
of Ii, however,
follows
from
the
assumption
of a more
or less
random
distribution
of collision
parameters
and velocities
of approach. It is here that
we introduce
the fundamental
statistical
element
into
our treatment.
To calculate
the
probability
density
Q„~&(c,) of
wave-function
parameters
existing
after
the
eth
collision,
we need
only
average
the contributions
to
Q„+, coming from the various
types of collisions. But
each contribution
satisfies Eq. (19). Thus,
we obtain
the following
integral
equation,
which
defines the way
in which Q„changes as a result of a collision:
Q +i(c;)=.
G(c,, c, u)Q (c,')dQ'du.
(22)
We are now ready to show that Q (c,') approaches
a
constant
as e~~. First, we note that if Q (c,') is a
constant,
then
by
virtue
of Eq. (21b), we
obtain
Q„+i—
—Q„. Thus, Q„=constant is a possible equilibrium
solution. If Q„(c ) is not a constant,
then let us denote
by A
its maximum
value
(as a function
of all its
variables).
This
maximum
must
exist,
because
by
hypothesis,
Q„(c,') is a continuous
function. Let us also
denote by 8„the minimum
value of Q (c,'), and let us
restrict ourselves for the time to the case in which there
is only one point at which Q„(c,') takes on the value A„
(and also only one point at which it takes the value B„).
Then
since Q„(c,')(A„ for all points
except one we

PROBAB I LI TY DENSITY
463
obtain, with the aid of Eq. (21b),
Q +&(c,)&
G(c,, c, u)A„dQ'du=A„,
(22a)
and similarly,
since Q„(c,') &B„except for one point,
we have
Q~~i(c,))
G(c,, c,', u)B„dQ'du= B„(.
22b)
A-—Q-+ ('")= G('"
' u)
X(A —Q„(c )+e.(c ))dn'dn.
But if Q„(c ) is not a constant
function
of its argu-
ments,
then
in the region
in which
C is appreciable,
A„—Q„(c,') will be some finite number
which does not
approach
zero
as e—+~. We
conclude
then
that
Q„(c, )—Q +~(c; ) also
does
not
approach
zero
as
n—+~. This contradicts
the hypothesis
that Q„(c,) ap-
proaches
Q„(c~) as a limit,
since
such
an
approach
requires
that Q„~&(c,)—Q„(c,) approach
zero for all c;.
We conclude then that Q (c,) must approach a constant
as e—
&~.
We shall
now
remove
the
limitation
that
Q„(c,')
takes on its maximum
(or minimum)
value at only one
point. First, we note that if Q„(c,') takes on the value
A „(orB„)on a set of isolated points, curves or surfa, ces,
of dimensionality
lower than that of the space of the
~, n&, n2 (or more generally,
on a set of measure
zero
in this space), then it is obvious that the reasoning
goes
through
precisely the same lines as before. If, however,
Q„(c,') should
happen
to take on the value A„ in a
three-dimensional
domain (or more generally
in a region
of finite measure
in the space of ~, n&, n~) and if this
region is bigger than the domain
in which G(c,, c, , u)
is diGerent from zero, the problem
is a little more com-
plicated,
because
one
then
obtains
the
result
that
A +~=A . However,
if we evaluate
Q„+~(c,) near the
edge of such a domain,
we obtain contributions
to the
This means that Q„+~(c,) can nowhere be as large as the
maximum
of Q„(c,') nor as small
as the minimum
of
Q„(c,'). Hence, the maximum
of Q„+q(c;) must be less
than that of Q„, and its minimum
must be greater than
that of Q„. In other words,
A„+g(A„; 8„+g&B„.
(23)
On the basis of the above
results,
it seems
clear on
intuitive
grounds
that Q„(c,) must approach a constant
as n—+~. To prove that this happens,
we shall
show
that the hypothesis
that it does not approach a constant
leads to a contradiction.
We let Q„(c;) represent
the
limiting
form
of Q„(c,). We
can
then
write
Q„(c,)
=Q„(c,)+e (c,), where e„(c,) is a term that approaches
zero uniformly
as e~~. Let us now evaluate
Q„(c,")
—Q„+~(c, ), where c,
is the point at which Q„(c;) has
its maximum
value A„. We have
Q.(.-)-Q...(,-)=A.-Q...(.-)+ .(,-),
and
integral
from regions
in which Q„(c )&A, so that at
such points, Q„+~(c,) &A„. Thus, in each collision,
the
special domain
in which Q„(c;)=A„ is narrowed
until
there is left only an isolated
maximum
point, and the
problem
is then
reduced
to the case originally
con-
sidered.
The significance
of our
result
is that
after
many
collisions,
the probability
density
for any set of wave-
function
coeKcients,
as defined
by the
co, o.&, n2, will
be uniform.
This
means
that
each
coefFicient
has a
random
phase and that there is a uniform
probability
for all values of
&a (cv defines the absolute magnitude
of
the wave-function
coefFicients costs and since, of c~ and
c2, respectively).
But this
is exactly
what
would
be
obtained
from the usual quantum-statistical
mechanics
for the case of an ensemble
of systems, each having
two
degenerate
levels. This result is not surprising,
since the
causal
interpretation
treats
the
wave
function
in
exactly the same way as does the usual interpretation.
It is important
to note that the continuity
of the
function
G(c,, c,', u)
played
an
essential
role
in the
proof that Q„(c;)approaches
a constant as u-+~. Thus,
if G had
been a function
that
was zero everywhere
except at certain
isolated
points,
we could not have
shown that A „+~&A „.For in this case, if the function
Q„(c,') had taken
on its maximum
value at precisely
those points
where
G did not vanish,
we should
have
obtained
A „+&=A „.But the continuity
of G guarantees
that the integral
expressing
Q„+~(c;) in terms of Q (c,')
must
obtain
contributions
from
regions
in
which
Q„(c,') is less than its maximum,
so that A„~~&A „.As
we have
seen,
the continuity
of G originates
in the
assumption
of a more or less random
distribution
of
types of collision. Thus,
the approach
of Q„(c,) to its
equilibrium
value is based on the random
character
of
the collision processes.
I.et us now consider the particle motions. In general,
these are rather difficult to solve for; but as in the case
of the wave-function
coefFicients we are not interested
in the details,
but
only
in the fact that a statistical
ensemble
of collisions
will
lead
to a corresponding
statistical
ensemble
of changes in particle positions. By
integrating
the
relation
%=VS/m,
we
see that
the
initial position x' of a particle is a function
of the final
position
x, the final wave-function
coefficients
c;, the
collision
parameter
h, and the initial
velocity
of ap-
proach u. But as shown
in Eq. (17), we can eliminate
h in terms of c; and c,'. We then get
x =x (c,) cq, ll, K, 3, 3 ).
(24)
YVe must explicitly
retain
t and t' here, because the
particles
are in general
moving
both before and after
the collision.
However,
it will be convenient
to define
6 This can be seen from Eq. (14). Since the phase
difference
0.2—a& appearing
in this equation
is not in general
zero either
before or after collision, and since cosco since is also not in general
zero, v& will in general dier from zero except in the very special
cases mentioned
above, which correspond
to isolated possibilities
of probability
zero.

t' in such a way that it represents
what may be called
the "beginning"
of the collision. This could be done,
for example,
by
choosing
it as the
time
when
the
distance
of the incident
particle
is the smallest
value
do for which the interactions
can be neglected.
Now, because the relation
between x' and x depends
on u, which is distributed
statistically,
we conclude that
even if those particles
having
the same wave-function
coeKcients
before
and
after
collision
had
the
same
initial
positions x, they
would
have a statistical
dis-
tribution
of positions x after collision. ' This leads us to
define the probability
P(c;, x, t)dx that if a hydrogen
molecule
has wave-function
coefFicients c;, its electron
is located in the region dx. In accordance with Eq. (5),
we can write
statistical
equilibrium
in p a,nd s. In this example,
we
shall hereafter
restrict
ourselves
to. considering P and
f as functions
only of p.
Now,
even
when
c; and c,' are fixed, a continuous
variation
in any component
of u, say N„will in general
produce
a corresponding
continuous
variation'
of g'.
In other
words,
if we solve for p' with Eq. (24), we
shall
find that
ci&'/Bu,
is a continuous
function,
not
identically
zero. Thus, we can eliminate u, in Eq. (21),
expressing it in terms of @,and obtain the probability,
E(C;, C,'; @, P', N„uv, t, i.') =G(8u,/By')dy'dD'dugu„,

(28)
P(c;, x, t)dx=
t i'(c,, x, t)i'dx=1.
(26)
To obtain
the probability
density
for the entire
en-
semble, we must multiply
the above by the probability
density
Q(c~) that a molecule
has the wave-function
coefficients
c,. Using Eq. (7), we also have f(c,, x, t)
=f(c,', x', t'); and
using
Eq. (19), we
have
Q(c,, t)
=Q(c,', i')
Thus,
w. e can write
for the
probability
density
in the space of x, co, u~ and n2,
Q(c;, t)P(i;;, x, 3)=
~ f(c;, x, t) ~'Q('c, ', i')j(c,', x', t').
(27)
To calculate
the probability
density
after
the eth
collision,
we
must
average
the
contribution
to
Q(c;, t)P(c,, x, t)
coming
from
the
various
types
of
collisions.
Each
contribution
satisfies
Eq. (27). But
each contribution
must
be weighted
with
the proper
weighting
function.
To obtain
the weighting
function,
we begin with Eq. (21), which gives the probability
of
a collision
with velocity
of approach
in the range
du,
that
carries
the
wave-function
coeKcients
from
the
region dQ' to the definite values c,. Ke must now elimi-
nate u in terms of x with the aid of Eq. (24). However,
we must note here that in our example of two degenerate
levels, only P will be changed
in a collision, ' and not p
and s. Our
simple
example
therefore
serves
only
to
illustrate
the approach to equilibrium
of the distribution
in g; but it is easily
shown'
that a more complex
ex-
ample
would
also demonstrate
a similar
approach
to
7 This result
is proved
in detail
in the more extensive
paper
mentioned
in reference 4. However,
it is very
plausible,
since
different
collision
parameters
will produce
diferent
changes
of
the
wave-function
coeScients
throughout
the
collision,
and
therefore
diGerent
velocities v= VS/m, so that difFerent distances
would be covered by the particles in the resulting
motions.
' This can be seen from Kq. (14) and (14a, b, c). In the present
approximation
of neglecting
transitions
to nondegenerate
levels,
the phase S, and
therefore
the velocity v=&Sjm, can depend
only on @;but if more terms were included
in the expansion
(9)
of the wave function, S would clearly depend
on p and s also. For
a more detailed
treatment
of this point, see the paper mentioned
in reference 4.
The
function
Ado'dQ'duQu„
is
clearly
the
proper
weighting
function
to use with Eq. (27). Denoting
by
f +i the value of f after the eth collision, we then obtain
=
~ P(c,, Q, t)
~ '
E(c,, c,'; Q, P'; l„I„,t, t')
J
XQ„(c )f„(c,y', t')dQ'du, dn„dy'.
(29)
But the above must also be averaged
over the times t'
at which
a collision
begin,
which
are distributed
at
random. In doing this, it is convenient
to average over
a time T long compared
to the time necessary
to com-
plete
a collision
but
short
compared
with
the
time
between
collisions
(such a case can always be obtained
by making
the pressure
low enough).
We then obtain
[with
the aid of (25)] an integral
equation
defining
how Q„f„ is changed
in these systems
undergoing
col-
lision between
t and t—T:
Xf„(c rtp', t')dQ, 'dg'du, dus (30).

Qn+ifn+1+Ds.
(31)
Note, however,
that to obtain
this result,
we must, as
'As shown
in paper II, Sec. 6, if the usual
theory
should
fail
in any domain, such as that associated with 10 "cm, the positions
of these particles
could be observed
with unlimited
precision,
so
that it would be possible, at least in principle, to predict the precise
time of decay of an individual
nucleus,
From here on, the proof that Q„f„appr
acohe
ascon-
stant as e—+~ is much the same as was the proof that
Q„approaches
a constant.
We let C„be the maximum
of Q„f„and D„ its minimum.
Then
using
(28), we
readily
show that

PROBAB I LI TY DENSITY
in obtaining
the similar result for Q„, use the fact that
E is a continuous
function of all its variables. It is here
that we bring in the basic hypothesis
of a statistically
distributed
series of kinds of collisions.
Thus,
we can deduce
that
Q„f„approaches
a con-
stant. Since Q„approaches
a constant,
we deduce that
f„als oapproaches
a constant,
which
must
be unity,
since by (26) both I' and
~ tt ~' are by definition
nor-
malized.
This means
that P(c,, P, t) =
~ iP(c;, P, t)
~ ', or
that if we fix our attention
on those cases in which the
wave-function
coefficients are c;, the probability
density
is just ~P(c„g, t) ~'.
Finally, let us note that no other solution of the con-
servation
equation
could
have
taken
the
place
of
~f(c,, P, l) ~' in our proof that
after
many
collisions,
I'(c,, P, 3)—
+~ f(c;, P, l) ~'. Although
Eq. (7) would have
followed
from Eq. (5) if we had replaced
~ f(x, t) ~' by
an arbitrary
solution H(x, t) of the conservation
equa-
tion, the step from Eq. (27) to Eq. (29) would not then
have been possible, For in this step, we used the property
that the value of
~ iP(c,, @,t) ~' depends
ority on the final
coefficients
c, of the wave
function
and not on the
initial
coefficients
c, . This property
makes it possible
for us to take
~P(c;, Q, t) ~' out of the integral
as a
common
factor, independent
of the initial
wave-func-
tions
coeKcients
c,'. With
any other
solution
of the
conservation
equation,
the final value
of the function
would have depended
on the initial coefFicients c, as well
as on the c,, so that the function
could not have been
taken out of the integral
and the proof would not have
gone through.
III. SUMMARY
AND CONCLUSIONS
We shall summarize
the results of this paper in terms
of the simple
example
of the
O.-decay of two uranium
nuclei
having
the
same
wave
function.
Now
one of
these nuclei may disintegrate
tomorrow
and the other
in two billion
years. The usual
interpretation
of the
quantum
theory states, however,
that today there can
be no physically
describable
difference
between
these
nuclei, since they both have the same wave function and
since the wave function
is said to determine
all physi-
cally significant
properties
of a system. But the most
elementary
scientific
procedure
would
suggest
that
if
two objects are observed
to act differently,
this should
be regarded
as a posteriori
evidence that there must
in
fact be some physical
difference between them. Indeed,
in the causal interpretation,
the di6erence
in the two
uranium
nuclei is explained
very simply in terms of the
assumption
that each nucleus has in it a set of particles
with
precisely
defined
positions,
which
determine
in
principle
exactly when that nucleus
is going to decay
(see paper I, Sec. 8). The difference
in times of disin-
tegration
is then ascribed to the differences
in positions
of the various particles
in the two nuclei. In fact, if we
consider a statistical
ensemble of such nuclei, all having
the same wave function,
then as has been shown in this
paper,
the particles
in diGerent
nuclei
will be in dif-
ferent positions as a result of collisions suffered by these
nuclei over the past few billion years; and these col-
lisions
will
have
produced
a probability
density
of
I'=
~ ip~ ' that the particles
in a particular
nucleus
take
a given set of positions. Thus, we are able, as shown in
paper I, Sec. 8, to explain
the statistical
ensemble
in
decay times of a large number
of nuclei.
In the
usual
interpretation,
however,
the
role
of
statistics is very diGerent,
for it is said that the precise
future
behavior
of an individual
system
is completely
arbitrary,
in the sense that it cannot be related to any
physically
definable
properties
of that
system
or of
anything
else existing
in the world
today.
Only
the
probability
of decay in a statistical
ensemble of systems
is said to be determined
by physical
factors
now
in
existence. Nevertheless,
it is admitted
that the behavior
of an individual
system such as a uranium
nucleus
can
be physically
significant,
since,
for example,
if this
nucleus disintegrates,
the resulting
particle can activate
a
Geiger
counter,
which
can
initiate
a large
scale
process, such as the setting
oG of a bomb. In this situ-
ation, the question
of when a particular
nucleus decays
clearly has physical significance,
since it determines,
for
example,
whether
the bomb
will explode
tomorrow
or
in two billion years. In accordance
with the postulate
that
only
the
behavior
of a statistical
ensemble
of
uranium
nuclei can be determined
by physical
factors
now
in existence,
however,
the
usual
interpretation
states that the time at which a particular
bomb
goes
o6 is completely
arbitrary,
from a physical
point
of
view.
The arbitrariness
of the usual
interpretation
in the
description
of the behavior
of an individual
system
is
closely related to the assumption,
already
stated, that
the wave function
determines
all physically
significant
properties
of that
system.
Now,
in the case of the
uranium
nucleus,
the wave function
takes the form of
a packet
initially
entirely
within
the nucleus,
which
gradually
"leaks" through
the barrier
and thereafter
rapidly
spreads without
limit in all directions.
Clearly,
although
this wave function
is supposed
to describe alt
physically
significant properties
of the system, it cannot
explain the fact that each a-particle is actually detected
in a comparatively
small region of space and at a fairly
well-defined
instant
of time. The usual
interpretation
states that this phenomenon
must simply be accepted
as an event that somehow
manages
to occur but in a
way that is as a matter of principle
forever beyond the
possibility
of a simultaneous
and detailed
"space-time
and causal description. "Indeed, even to ask for such a
description
is said to be a meaningless
question
within
the framework
of the usual interpretation
of the quan-
tum theory. In the causal interpretation,
however,
the
postulated
particles
with
precisely
defined
positions
explain
in a natural
way
why
an n-particle
can be
detected
at a fairly
definite
place
and
time,
on the
basis of the simple assumption
that the particle existed
all the time and just moved
from its original
location

DA VI D
BOH M
to the place where
it was finally
found.
Thus,
even
though
we cannot yet' observe the precise locations of
our postulated
particles,
they already
perform
a real
function
in
the
theory,
namely,
to
explain
certain
properties
of individual
systems
which are said in the
usual
interpretation
to be just empirically
given
and
forever unexplainable.
The postulation
of particles
with
precisely
defined
(but not at present precisely
measurable)
positions not
only makes
possible
a more connected
description
of
the behavior
of an individual
system
than
is possible
in the usual
interpretation
but also serves to increase
the degree of unity
in the treatment
of the statistical
aspects of the theory. Thus, in the usual interpretation,
two completely
diferent
kinds of statistics are needed.
First, there is the ordinary
statistical
mechanics,
which
treats of the distribution
of systems among the quantum
states,
resulting
from various
chaotic factors such as
collisions. The need for this type of statistics
could in
principle
be
avoided
by
means
of
more
accurate
measurements
which
would
supply
more
detailed
information
about
the quantum
state, but in systems
of appreciable
complexity,
such measurements
would be
impracticably
difficult. Secondly,
however,
there is the
fundamental
and
irreducible
probability
distribution,
P(x) =
~ P(x) (', or more generally, P =
( C,
~ ', where P,
is the probability
that in the measurement
of an arbi-
trary
observable
A we shall obtain
the eigenvalue
a,
corresponding
to the eigenfunction
Po(x), and
where
P=P, C,P,(x). The need
for this
type
of statistics
cannot even in principle
be avoided by means of better
measurements,
nor can it be explained
in terms of the
effects of random
collision processes. The usual
inter-
petation
simply
postulates
the above probability
dis-
tribution
as a basic and not further
analyzable
property
of matter,
in addition
to the more
familiar
type
of
probability
that
applies
in the statistical
distribution
of systems
among
the quantum
states.
On the other
hand,
the causal interpretation
requires
only one kind
of probability.
For as we have seen, we can deduce the
probability
distribution
P(x) =
~ f(x)
~ ' as a consequence
of the same random
collision
processes
that
give rise
to the
statistical
distributions
among
the
quantum
states. Moreover,
as shown
in paper II, this result
is
sufficient
to prove
the more
general
result
that
the
probability
of obtaining
the eigenvalue
a in the meas-
urement
of an arbitrary
observable
A is P,=
j C,
~ '. In
this way, the causal interpretation
avoids the need for
introducing
ad hoc a completely
new type of probability
distribution,
which
does not represent
incompleteness
of information
and which
is not even in principle
ex-
plainable
in terms
of random
processes,
such as col-
lisions.
As the situation stands now, the causal interpretation
and
the usual
interpretation
each introduce
one hy-
pothesis that has not yet been proved
experimentally,
the
causal
interpretation
assuming
the
existence
of
particles
with precisely
defined positions
and the usual
interpretation
assuming
that P(x)= ~P(x) ~' (or more
generally,
P,=
~ C,
~ ')." The
causal
interpretation
already
has,
however,
the advantage
of providing
a
more unified
description
of nature
than
is possible
in
the usual interpretation,
one involving a smaller number
of hypotheses
that must simply be accepted as empirical
facts without
further
explanation.
For by making
ore
postulate,
that of the existence of particles
with pre-
cisely
defined
positions,
the
causal
interpretation
explains
two general
properties
of matter
which
must
simply
be postulated
in the usual
interpretation,
i.e.,
the appearance
of an
individual
particle
in a fairly
definite position
and at a fairly well-defined
instant
of
time after the wave function
has spread
over a wide
region of space, and the probability
distribution
of these
particles in a statistical
ensemble of systems having the
same wave function. For this reason, it would seem that
the assumption
of particles with precisely de6ned posi-
tions is likely to be on the right track, at least in its
essential features,
even if all of the details of the theory
thus far suggested
may perhaps
not appear
in a better
theory
of the phenomena
associated
with distances
of
the order of 10 "cm.
The author wishes to thank Professor R. P. Feynman

"As shown in Sec. I of the present paper, the assumption
that
J'(x)=
~ P(x) ~' has not yet been verified
experimentally,
nor is it
likely that experiments
of the requisite
precisio'n
will be possible
in the near future.
