In preparing this seventh edition, we had two primary
goals. First, we wanted to incorporate the sweeping
changes in the U.S. and world economies we have all wit-
nessed in the last several years, as the world rebounds from
a severe economic downturn. Second, we wanted to stay
true to the philosophy of the textbook
using basic con-
cepts of economics to explain a wide-variety of timely and
interesting economic applications.   
 WHAT S NEW TO THIS EDITION
In addition to updating all the figures and data, we made a
number of other key changes in this edition. They include
the following:
We revised and updated our discussion of fiscal policy
in Chapters 5, 9, 10, 15 17, and 19  to reflect the expe-
rience of recent attempts to stimulate the economy
from the recession.  
We revised and updated our treatment of banking and
the monetary system in Chapters 13, 14, and 17 as the
Federal Reserve made important changes in its operating
procedures, such as purchasing new types of securities,
paying interest on reserves, and establishing new mecha-
nisms to support financial markets in a time of stress.
We added a section in Chapter 5 about the way we
measure economic performance, the sustainability of
economic growth, and peoples happiness as a result.
We added new material in Chapter 6 about the effects
of peer groups and unemployment.
We updated the discussion of economic growth in
Chapter 8 to include the effects of political institutions
on growth.
We added a section in Chapter 12 about the housing
market and how it exemplifies the links between invest-
ment and finance.
We added a discussion in Chapter 15 about how policy-
makers can avoid a potential liquidity trap.  
We incorporated the links between the vacancy rate
and unemployment in our discussion of the natural rate
in Chapter 16.
We added material in Chapter 20 to highlight the dif-
ference between the elasticity of demand for a specific
brand and the elasticity of demand for a product.
We added a section on the economics of consumer
search to Chapter 29, describing the consumer s deci-
sion about how long to search for low prices.
We added a section in Chapter 31 on the Coase bar-
gaining solution to pollution.
We also incorporated 50 new, exciting applications into
this edition and 15 interesting, new chapter-opening stories
to motivate the material in each chapter. 
In the chapters common to macroeconomics and
microeconomics, the new applications include the puz-
zle of why people walk up stairs but not escalators
(Chapter 2) and why one of the best painters in the
world hires someone to paint his house (Chapter 2). 
In the macroeconomics chapters, the new applications
include biases in the CPI from not incorporating new
goods (Chapter 6), global warming and economic
growth in rich and poor countries (Chapter 8), evaluat-
ing President Obama s stimulus package (Chapter 10),
homeowners who are financially 
underwater
(Chapter 12), monetary policy and the housing boom
(Chapter 17), and financial problems for countries in
the Euro-zone (Chapter 19). 
In the microeconomics chapters, some of the new
applications include clicking to find estimates of price
elasticities (Chapter 20), a proposed tax on soft drinks
(Chapter 22), the break-even price for biofuel
(Chapter 24), why popcorn in movie theaters is so
expensive (Chapter 25), why an increase in the wage
paid to taxi drivers causes them to drive less
(Chapter 32), and why unionization decreased the
number of high-aptitude teachers (Chapter 33).
Preface

 APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
This is an Applications-driven textbook. We carefully selected over 120 real-world Applications that help students develop
and master essential economic concepts. Here is an example of our approach from Chapter 4, Demand, Supply, and
Market Equilibrium.
We start each chapter with three to five thought-
provoking Applying the Concepts questions that
convey important economic concepts.
Once we present the economic logic behind a concept,
we illustrate its use with a real-world Application.
For each Application and Applying the Concept
question, we provide exercises that test students
understanding of the concepts. In addition, some
chapters contain an Economic Experiment section
that gives them the opportunity to do their own eco-
nomic analysis.
xxxv

 WHY FIVE KEY PRINCIPLES?
In Chapter 2, The Key Principles of Economics,  we
introduce the following five key principles and then apply
them throughout the book:
1.
The Principle of Opportunity Cost. The opportu-
nity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
2.
The Marginal Principle. Increase the level of an
activity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds its mar-
ginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal ben-
efit equals the marginal cost.
3.
The Principle of Voluntary Exchange. A voluntary
exchange between two people makes both people bet-
ter off.
4.
The Principle of Diminishing Returns. If we
increase one input while holding the other inputs fixed,
output will increase, but at a decreasing rate.
5.
The Real-Nominal Principle. What matters to peo-
ple is the real value of money or income
its purchas-
ing power
not the face value of money or income.
This approach of repeating five key principles gives students
the big picture
the framework of economic reasoning. We
make the key concepts unforgettable by using them repeat-
edly, illustrating them with intriguing examples, and giving
students many opportunities to practice what they ve
learned. Throughout the text, economic concepts are con-
nected to the five key principles when the following callout
is provided for each principle:
Students need to have a solid understanding of demand
and supply to be successful in the course. Many students
have difficulty understanding movement along a curve ver-
sus shifts of a curve. To address this difficulty, we developed
an innovative way to organize topics in Chapter 4,
Demand, Supply, and Market Equilibrium.  We examine
the law of demand and changes in quantity demanded, the
law of supply and changes in quantity supplied, and then the
notion of market equilibrium. After students have a firm
grasp of equilibrium concepts, we explore the effects of
changes in demand and supply on equilibrium prices and
quantities. You can present either macroeconomics or
microeconomics chapters first, depending on your prefer-
ence. See the alternative course sequence charts on
pages xxxii xxxiii of this preface for organization options.
Summary of the Macroeconomics Chapters
Part 2, 
The Basic Concepts of Macroeconomics
(Chapters 5 and 6), introduces students to the key
concepts
GDP, inflation, unemployment
that are used
throughout the text and in everyday economic discussion.
The two chapters in this section provide the building blocks
for the rest of the book. Part 3, The Economy in the Long
Run  (Chapters 7 and 8), analyzes how the economy oper-
ates at full employment and explores the causes and conse-
quences of economic growth.
Next we turn to the short run. We begin the discussion
of business cycles, economic fluctuations, and the role of
government in Part 4, Economic Fluctuations and Fiscal
Policy  (Chapters 9 through 12). We devote an entire chap-
ter to the structure of government spending and revenues
and the role of fiscal policy. In Part 5, Money, Banking,
and Monetary Policy  (Chapters 13 and 14), we introduce
the key elements of both monetary theory and policy into
our economic models. Part 6, Inflation, Unemployment,
and Economic Policy  (Chapters 15 through 17), brings
the important questions of the dynamics of inflation and
unemployment into our analysis. Finally, the last two chap-
ters in Part 7, The International Economy  (Chapters 18
and 19), provide an in-depth analysis of both international
trade and finance.
A Few Features of Our Macroeconomics
Chapters
The following are a few features of our macroeconomics
chapters:
Flexibility. A key dilemma confronting economics
professors has always been how much time to devote
to long-run topics, such as growth and production,
versus short-run topics, such as economic fluctua-
tions and business cycles. Our book is designed to let
HOW IS THE BOOK ORGANIZED?
Chapter 1, Introduction: What Is Economics?  uses
three current policy issues
traffic congestion, poverty in
Africa, and Japan s prolonged recession
to explain the
economic way of thinking. Chapter 2, 
The Key
Principles of Economics,  introduces the five principles
we return to throughout the book. Chapter 3, Exchange
and Markets,  is devoted entirely to exchange and trade.
We discuss the fundamental rationale for exchange and
introduce some of the institutions modern societies devel-
oped to facilitate trade.
xxxvi

professors choose. It works like this: To pursue a
long-run approach, professors should initially con-
centrate on Chapters 1 through 4, followed by
Chapters 5 through 8.
To focus on economic fluctuations, start with
Chapters 1 through 4, present Chapter 5, Measuring a
Nation s Production and Income,  and Chapter 6,
Unemployment and Inflation,  and then turn to
Chapter 9, Aggregate Demand and Aggregate Supply.
Chapter 11, The Income-Expenditure Model,  is self-
contained, so instructors can either skip it completely
or cover it as a foundation for aggregate demand.
Long Run. Throughout most of the 1990s, the U.S.
economy performed very well
low inflation, low
unemployment, and rapid economic growth. This
robust performance led to economists  increasing
interest in trying to understand the processes of eco-
nomic growth. Our discussion of economic growth in
Chapter 8, Why Do Economies Grow?  addresses the
fundamental question of how long-term living stan-
dards are determined and why some countries prosper
while others do not. This is the essence of economic
growth. As Nobel Laureate Robert E. Lucas, Jr., once
wrote, Once you start thinking about growth, it is
hard to think of anything else.
Short Run. The great economic expansion of the
1990s came to an end in 2001, as the economy started
to contract. The recession beginning in 2007 was the
worst downturn since World War II. Difficult eco-
nomic times remind us that macroeconomics is also
concerned with understanding the causes and conse-
quences of economic fluctuations. Why do economies
experience recessions and depressions, and what steps
can policymakers take to stabilize the economy and
ease the devastation people suffer from them? This has
been a constant theme of macroeconomics throughout
its entire history and is covered extensively in the text.
Policy. Macroeconomics is a policy-oriented subject,
and we treat economic policy in virtually every chapter.
We discuss both important historical and more recent
macroeconomic events in conjunction with the theory.
In addition, we devote Chapter 17, Macroeconomic
Policy Debates,  to three important policy topics that
recur frequently in macroeconomic debates: the role of
government deficits, whether the Federal Reserve
should target inflation or other objectives, and whether
income or consumption should be taxed.
Summary of the Microeconomics Chapters
A course in microeconomics starts with the first four chapters
of the book, which provide a foundation for more detailed
study of individual decision making and markets.
Part 8, A Closer Look at Demand and Supply,
(Chapters 20 through 22), provides a closer look at demand
and supply, including elasticity, market efficiency, and con-
sumer choice. Part 9, Market Structures and Pricing
(Chapters 23 through 28), starts with a discussion of produc-
tion and costs, setting the stage for an examination of alterna-
tive market structures, including the extremes of perfect
competition and monopoly, as well as the middle ground of
monopolistic competition and oligopoly. The last chapter in
Part 9 discusses antitrust policy and deregulation. Part 10,
Externalities and Information  (Chapters 29 through 31),
discusses the circumstances under which markets break
down, including imperfect information, public goods, and
environmental degradation.
Part 11, The Labor Market and Income Distribution
(Chapter 32 and 33), explores the labor market, unions,
poverty, discrimination, and the distribution of income.
 MYECONLAB
Both the text and supplement
package provide ways for instruc-
tors and students to assess their knowledge and progress
through the course. MyEconLab, the new standard in per-
sonalized online learning, is a key part of O Sullivan,
Sheffrin, and Perez s integrated learning package for the
seventh edition.
For the Instructor
MyEconLab is an online course management, testing,
and tutorial resource. Instructors can choose how much
or how little time to spend setting up and using
MyEconLab. Each chapter contains two Sample Tests,
Study Plan Exercises, and Tutorial Resources. Student
use of these materials requires no initial set-up by the
instructor. The online Gradebook records each student s
performance and time spent on the Tests and Study Plan
and generates reports by student or by chapter.
Instructors can assign tests, quizzes, and homework in
MyEconLab using four resources:
Preloaded Sample Test questions
Problems similar to the end-of-chapter exercises
Test Item File questions
Self-authored questions using the Econ Exercise Builder
xxxvii

Exercises use multiple-choice, graph drawing, and free-
response items, many of which are generated algorithmi-
cally so that each time a student works them, a different
variation is presented. MyEconLab grades each of these
problem types, even those with graphs. When working
homework exercises, students receive immediate feedback
with links to additional learning tools.
Customization and Communication
MyEconLab in
CourseCompass
 provides additional optional customiza-
tion and communication tools. Instructors who teach dis-
tance learning courses or very large lecture sections find
the CourseCompass format useful because they can upload
course documents and assignments, customize the order of
chapters, and use communication features such as Digital
Drop Box and Discussion Board.
Experiments in MyEconLab
Experiments are a fun and
engaging way to promote active learning and mastery of
important economic concepts. Pearson s experiments pro-
gram is flexible and easy for instructors and students to use.
Single-player experiments allow students to play an
experiment against virtual players from anywhere at
anytime with an Internet connection.
Multiplayer experiments allow instructors to assign
and manage a real-time experiment with their class.
In both cases, pre-and post-questions for each experiment
are available for assignment in MyEconLab.
For the Student
MyEconLab puts students in control of their learning through
a collection of tests, practice, and study tools tied to the online,
interactive version of the textbook, and other media resources.
Within MyEconLabs structured environment, students prac-
tice what they learn, test their understanding, and pursue a
personalized Study Plan generated from their performance on
Sample Tests and tests set by their instructors. At the core of
MyEconLab are the following features:
Sample Tests, two per chapter
Personal Study Plan
Tutorial Instruction
Graphing Tool
Sample Tests
Two Sample Tests for each chapter are pre-
loaded in MyEconLab, enabling students to practice what
they have learned, test their understanding, and identify
areas in which they need further work. Students can study
on their own, or they can complete assignments created by
their instructor.
Personal Study Plan
Based on a student s performance
on tests, MyEconLab generates a personal Study Plan that
shows where the student needs further study. The Study
Plan consists of a series of additional practice exercises with
detailed feedback and guided solutions that are keyed to
other tutorial resources.
Tutorial Instruction
Launched from many of the exer-
cises in the Study Plan, MyEconLab provides tutorial
instruction in the form of step-by-step solutions and other
media-based explanations.
Graphing Tool
A graphing tool is integrated into the
Tests and Study Plan exercises to enable students to make
and manipulate graphs. This feature helps students under-
stand how concepts, numbers, and graphs connect.
Additional MyEconLab Tools
MyEconLab includes the
following additional features:
1.
Weekly News Update
This feature provides weekly
updates during the school year of news items with links
to sources for further reading and discussion questions. 
2.
eText
While students are working in the Study Plan
or completing homework assignments, part of the tuto-
rial resources available is a direct link to the relevant
page of the text so that students can review the appro-
priate material to help them complete the exercise.
3.
Glossary Flashcards
Every key term is available as a
flashcard, allowing students to quiz themselves on
vocabulary from one or more chapters at a time.
MyEconLab content has been created over the years
through the efforts of Charles Baum, Middle Tennessee
State University; Peggy Dalton, Frostburg State University;
Sarah Ghosh, University of Scranton; Russell Kellogg,
University of Colorado, Denver; Bert G. Wheeler,
Cedarville University; and Douglas A. Ruby, Noel Lotz, and
Courtney Kamauf, Pearson Education.
* WHAT INSTRUCTOR S
SUPPLEMENTS DID WE DEVELOP?
A fully integrated teaching and learning package is neces-
sary for today s classroom. Our supplement package helps
you provide new and interesting real-world Applications
and assess student understanding of economics. The sup-
plements are coordinated with the main text through the
numbering system of the headings in each section. The
major sections of the chapters are numbered (1.1, 1.2, 1.3,
and so on), and that numbering system is used consistently
in the supplements to make it convenient and flexible for
instructors to develop assignments.
Four Test Item Files
Economics, seventh edition, is supported by a comprehensive
set of four test item files.
xxxviii

There are two test item files for Macroeconomics and two
test item files for Microeconomics. Each test item file offers
multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer questions.
The questions are referenced by topic and are presented in
sequential order. Each question is keyed by degree of diffi-
culty, with questions ranging on a scale of one to three.
Easy questions involve straightforward recall of informa-
tion in the text. Moderate questions require some analysis
on the student s part. Difficult questions usually entail
more complex analysis and may require the student to go
one step further than the material presented in the text.
Questions are also classified as fact, definition, conceptual,
and analytical. Fact questions test the student s knowledge
of factual information presented in the text. Definition
questions ask the student to define an economic concept.
Conceptual questions test the student s understanding of a
concept. Analytical questions require the student to apply
an analytical procedure to answer the question.
The test item files include tables and a series of ques-
tions asking students to solve for numeric values, such as
profit or equilibrium output. There are also numerous ques-
tions based on graphs: Several questions ask students to
interpret data presented in a graph, draw a graph on their
own, and answer related questions.
In each chapter there are several questions that sup-
port the Applications in the main book. Each test item file
chapter also includes an additional Application based on a
newspaper, journal, or online news story. There are also
new questions to support the updated and new content in
the main book.
The Association to Advance Collegiate Schools of
Business (AACSB)
The authors of the test item files
have connected questions to the general knowledge
and skill guidelines found in the AACSB assurance of
learning standards.
What Is the AACSB?
AACSB is a not-for-profit corpora-
tion of educational institutions, corporations, and other
organizations devoted to the promotion and improvement
of higher education in business administration and account-
ing. A collegiate institution offering degrees in business
administration or accounting may volunteer for AACSB
accreditation review. The AACSB makes initial accredita-
tion decisions and conducts periodic reviews to promote
continuous quality improvement in management education.
Pearson Education is a proud member of the AACSB and is
pleased to provide advice to help you apply AACSB assur-
ance of learning standards.
What Are AACSB Assurance of Learning Standards?
One of the criteria for AACSB accreditation is quality of the
curricula. Although no specific courses are required, the
AACSB expects a curriculum to include learning experi-
ences in the following areas:
Communication
Ethical Reasoning
Analytic Skills
Use of Information Technology
Multiculturalism and Diversity
Reflective Thinking
Questions that test skills relevant to these guidelines are
appropriately tagged. For example, a question testing the
moral questions associated with externalities would receive
the Ethical Reasoning tag.
How Can Instructors Use the AACSB Tags?
Tagged
questions help you measure whether students are grasp-
ing the course content that aligns with the AACSB
guidelines noted. In addition, the tagged questions may
help instructors identify potential applications of these
skills. This in turn may suggest enrichment activities or
other educational experiences to help students achieve
these skills.
For Macroeconomics . . .
Test Item File 1, prepared
by Randy Methenitis of Richland College, includes
approximately 3,000 multiple-choice, true/false, short-
answer, and graphing questions. Test Item File 2, pre-
pared by Brian Rosario of California State University,
Sacramento, contains over 3,000 multiple-choice,
true/false, and short-answer questions. Both test item
files are available in a computerized format using
TestGen, test-generating software.
For Microeconomics . . .
Test Item File 1, prepared by
Randy Methenitis of Richland College, includes approxi-
mately 3,000 multiple-choice, true/false, short-answer, and
graphing questions. Test Item File 2, prepared by Robert
Shoffner III of Central Piedmont Community College, con-
tains over 2,000 multiple-choice, true/false, and short-answer
questions. Both test item files are available in a computerized
format using TestGen, test-generating software.
TestGen
Microeconomics and Macroeconomics test item files 1 and 2
appear in print and as computer files that may be used with
TestGen test-generating software. This test-generating pro-
gram permits instructors to edit, add, or delete questions
from the test bank; analyze test results; and organize a data-
base of tests and student results. This software allows for
xxxix

flexibility and ease of use. It provides many options for
organizing and displaying tests, along with a search and
sort feature.
Instructor s Manuals
The instructor s manuals, revised by Jeff Phillips of Colby-
Sawyer College, follow the textbook s organization, incor-
porating extra Applications questions. The manuals also
provide detailed outlines (suitable for use as lecture notes)
and solutions to all questions in the textbook. The instruc-
tor s manuals are also designed to help the instructor
incorporate applicable elements of the supplement pack-
age. Each instructor s manual contains the following for
each chapter:
Summary: a bulleted list of key topics in the chapter
Approaching the Material: student-friendly examples
to introduce the chapter
Chapter Outline: summary of definitions and concepts

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
Economics is the science of choice, exploring the choices
made by individuals and organizations. Over the last few
centuries, these choices have led to substantial gains in the
standard of living around the globe. In the United States, the
typical person today has roughly seven times the income
and purchasing power of a person 100 years ago. Our pros-
perity is the result of choices made by all sorts of people,
including inventors, workers, entrepreneurs, and the people
who saved money and loaned it to others to invest in
machines and other tools of production. One reason we
have prospered is greater efficiency: We have discovered
better ways to use our resources
raw materials, time, and
energy
to produce the goods and services we value.
As an illustration of changes in the standard of living and
our growing prosperity, let s compare the way people lis-
tened to music in 1891 with how we listen today. You can
buy an iPod shuffle® for $49 and fill it with 500 songs at
$0.99 each. If you earn a wage of $15 per hour, it would
take you about 36 hours of work to purchase and then fill an
iPod. Back in 1891, the latest technological marvel was
Thomas Edison s cylinder phonograph, which played music
recorded on 4-inch cylinders. Imagine that you lived back
then and wanted to get just as much music as you could fit
on an iPod. Given the wages and prices in 1891, it would
take you roughly 800 hours of work to earn enough money
to buy the phonograph and all the cylinders. And if you wanted to keep your music with you, you would
need 14 backpacks to carry the cylinders.
Although prosperity and efficiency are widespread, they are not universal. In some parts of the world, many
people live in poverty. For example, in sub-Saharan Africa 388 million people
about half the population
live
on less than $1.25 per day. And in all nations of the world, inefficiencies still exist, with valuable resources being
wasted. For example, each year the typical urban commuter in the United States wastes more than 47 hours
and $84 worth of gasoline trapped in rush hour traffic.

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS ECONOMICS?
2
E
conomics provides a framework to diagnose all sorts of problems faced by
society and then helps create and evaluate various proposals to solve them.
Economics can help us develop strategies to replace poverty with prosper-
ity, and to replace waste with efficiency. In this chapter, we explain what econom-
ics is and how we all can use economic analysis to think about practical problems
and solutions.
WHAT IS ECONOMICS?
Economists use the word scarcity to convey the idea that resources
the things we
use to produce goods and services
are limited, while human wants are unlimited.
Therefore, we cannot produce everything that everyone wants. As the old saying goes,
you can t always get what you want. Economics studies the choices we make when
there is scarcity; it is all about trade-offs. Here are some examples of scarcity and the
trade-offs associated with making choices:
You have a limited amount of time. If you take a part-time job, each hour on the
job means one less hour for study or play.
A city has a limited amount of land. If the city uses an acre of land for a park, it
has one less acre for housing, retailers, or industry.
You have limited income this year. If you spend $17 on a music CD, thats $17
less you have to spend on other products or to save.
People produce goods (music CDs, houses, and parks) and services (the advice of
physicians and lawyers) by using one or more of the following five factors of
production, also called production inputs or simply resources:
Natural resources are provided by nature. Some examples are fertile land,
mineral deposits, oil and gas deposits, and water. Some economists refer to all
types of natural resources as land.
Labor is the physical and mental effort people use to produce goods and services.
Physical capital is the stock of equipment, machines, structures, and infrastruc-
ture that is used to produce goods and services. Some examples are forklifts,
machine tools, computers, factories, airports, roads, and fiber-optic cables.
Human capital is the knowledge and skills acquired by a worker through edu-
cation and experience. Every job requires some human capital: To be a surgeon,
you must learn anatomy and acquire surgical skills. To be an accountant, you
must learn the rules of accounting and acquire computer skills. To be a musi-
cian, you must learn to play an instrument.
Entrepreneurship is the effort used to coordinate the factors of production
natural resources, labor, physical capital, and human capital
to produce and
sell products. An entrepreneur comes up with an idea for a product, decides
how to produce it, and raises the funds to bring it to the market. Some examples
of entrepreneurs are Bill Gates of Microsoft, Steve Jobs of Apple Computer,
Howard Schultz of Starbucks, and Ray Kroc of McDonald s.
Given our limited resources, we make our choices in a variety of ways. Sometimes
we make our decisions as individuals, and other times we participate in collective deci-
sion making, allowing the government and other organizations to choose for us. Many
of our choices happen within markets, institutions or arrangements that enable us to
buy and sell things. For example, most of us participate in the labor market, exchanging
our time for money, and we all participate in consumer markets, exchanging money for
food and clothing. But we make other choices outside markets
from our personal
decisions about everyday life to our political choices about matters that concern society

PART 1
as a whole. What unites all these decisions is the notion of scarcity: We can t have it all;
there are trade-offs.
Economists are always reminding us that there is scarcity
there are trade-offs in
everything we do. Suppose that in a conversation with your economics instructor you
share your enthusiasm about an upcoming launch of the space shuttle. The economist
may tell you that the resources used for the shuttle could have been used instead for an
unmanned mission to Mars.
By introducing the notion of scarcity into your conversation, your instructor is
simply reminding you that there are trade-offs, that one thing (a Mars mission) is sac-
rificed for another (a shuttle mission). Talking about alternatives is the first step in a
process that can help us make better choices about how to use our resources. For
example, we could compare the scientific benefits of a shuttle mission to the benefits
of a Mars mission and choose the mission with the greater benefit.
Positive versus Normative Analysis
Economics doesn t tell us what to choose
shuttle mission or Mars mission
but sim-
ply helps us to understand the trade-offs. President Harry S. Truman once remarked,
All my economists say, On the one hand, . . . ; On the other hand, . . ..  Give me a one-
handed economist!
An economist might say, On the one hand, we could use a shuttle mission to do more
experiments in the gravity-free environment of Earths orbit; on the other hand, we
could use a Mars mission to explore the possibility of life on other planets.  In using
both hands, the economist is not being evasive, but simply doing economics, dis-
cussing the alternative uses of our resources. The ultimate decision about how to use
our resources
shuttle mission or Mars exploration
is the responsibility of citizens
or their elected officials.
Most modern economics is based on positive analysis, which predicts the conse-
quences of alternative actions by answering the question What is?  or What will be?
A second type of economic reasoning is normative in nature. Normative analysis
answers the question What ought to be?
In Table 1.1, we compare positive questions to normative questions. Normative
questions lie at the heart of policy debates. Economists contribute to policy debates
by conducting positive analyses of the consequences of alternative actions. For exam-
ple, an economist could predict the effects of an increase in the minimum wage on
the number of people employed nationwide, the income of families with minimum-
wage workers, and consumer prices. Armed with the conclusions of the economist s
positive analysis, citizens and policymakers could then make a normative decision
TABLE 1.1 COMPARING POSITIVE AND NORMATIVE QUESTIONS
Positive Questions
Normative Questions
If the government increases the minimum
wage, how many workers will lose their jobs?
If two office-supply firms merge, will the
price of office supplies increase?
How does a college education affect a
person s productivity and earnings?
How do consumers respond to a cut in
income taxes?
If a nation restricts shoe imports, who
benefits and who bears the cost?
Should the government increase the
minimum wage?
Should the government block the merger of
two office-supply firms?
Should the government subsidize a college
education?
Should the government cut taxes to
stimulate the economy?
Should the government restrict imports?

about whether to increase the minimum wage. Similarly, an economist could study
the projects that could be funded with $1 billion in foreign aid, predicting the effects
of each project on the income per person in an African country. Armed with this pos-
itive analysis, policymakers could then decide which projects to support.
Economists don t always reach the same conclusions in their positive analyses.
The disagreements often concern the magnitude of a particular effect. For example,
most economists agree that an increase in the minimum wage will cause unemploy-
ment, but disagree about how many people would lose their jobs. Similarly, econo-
mists agree that spending money to improve the education system in Africa will
increase productivity and income, but disagree about the size of the increase in
income.
The Three Key Economic Questions: What, How, and Who?
We make economic decisions at every level in society. Individuals decide what prod-
ucts to buy, what occupations to pursue, and how much money to save. Firms decide
what goods and services to produce and how to produce them. Governments decide
what projects and programs to complete and how to pay for them. The choices of
individuals, firms, and governments answer three questions:
1 What products do we produce?
Trade-offs exist: If a hospital uses its resources to per-
form more heart transplants, it has fewer resources to care for premature infants.
2 How do we produce the products?
Alternative means of production are available:
Power companies can produce electricity with coal, natural gas, or wind power.
Professors can teach in large lecture halls or small classrooms.
3 Who consumes the products?
We must decide how to distribute the products of
society. If some people earn more money than others, should they consume more
goods? How much money should the government take from the rich and give to
the poor?
As we ll see later in the book, most of these decisions are made in markets, where
prices play a key role in determining what products we produce, how we produce
them, and who gets the products. In Chapter 3, we ll examine the role of markets in
modern economies and the role of government in market-based economies.
Economic Models
Economists use economic models to explore the choices people make and the conse-
quences of those choices. An economic model is a simplified representation of an eco-
nomic environment, with all but the essential features of the environment eliminated.
An economic model is an abstraction from reality that enables us to focus our atten-
tion on what really matters. As we ll see throughout the book, most economic models
use graphs to represent the economic environment.
To see the rationale for economic modeling, consider an architectural model. An
architect builds a scale model of a new building and uses the model to show how the
building will fit on a plot of land and blend with nearby buildings. The model shows
the exterior features of the building, but not the interior features. We can ignore the
interior features because they are unimportant for the task at hand
seeing how the
building will fit into the local environment.
Economists build models to explore decision making by individuals, firms,
and other organizations. For example, we can use a model of a profit-maximizing
firm to predict how a firm will respond to increased competition. If a new car
stereo store opens up in your town, will the old firms be passive and simply accept
smaller market shares, or will they aggressively cut their prices to try to drive the

new rival out of business? The model of the firm includes the monetary benefits
and costs of doing business, and assumes that firms want to make as much money
as possible. Although there may be other motives in the business world
to have
fun or to help the world
the economic model ignores these other motives. The
model focuses our attention on the profit motive and how it affects a firm s
response to increased competition.
ECONOMIC ANALYSIS AND MODERN
PROBLEMS
Economic analysis provides important insights into real-world problems. To explain
how we can use economic analysis in problem solving, we provide three examples.
You ll see these examples again in more detail later in the book.
Economic View of Traffic Congestion
Consider first the problem of traffic congestion. According to the Texas
Transportation Institute, the typical U.S. commuter wastes about 47 hours per
year because of traffic congestion.1 In some cities, the time wasted is much
greater: 93 hours in Los Angeles, 72 hours in San Francisco, and 63 hours in
Houston. In addition to time lost, we also waste 2.3 billion gallons of gasoline and
diesel fuel each year.
To an economist, the diagnosis of the congestion problem is straightforward.
When you drive onto a busy highway during rush hour, your car takes up space and
decreases the distance between the vehicles on the highway. A driver s normal reac-
tion to a shorter distance between moving cars is to slow down. So when you enter
the highway, you force other commuters to slow down and thus spend more time
on the highway. If each of your 900 fellow commuters spends just two extra seconds
on the highway, you will increase the total travel time by 30 minutes. In deciding
whether to use the highway, you will presumably ignore these costs you impose on
others. Similarly, your fellow commuters ignore the cost they impose on you and
others when they enter the highway. Because no single commuter pays the full cost
(30 minutes), too many people use the highway, and everyone wastes time.
One possible solution to the congestion problem is to force people to pay for
using the road, just as they pay for gasoline and tires. The government could
impose a congestion tax of $8 per trip on rush-hour commuters and use a debit
card system to collect the tax: Every time a car passes a checkpoint, a transponder
would charge the commuter s card. Traffic volume during rush hours would then
decrease as travelers (a) shift their travel to off-peak times, (b) switch to ride shar-
ing and mass transit, and (c) shift their travel to less congested routes. The job for
the economist is to compute the appropriate congestion tax and predict the conse-
quences of imposing it.
Economic View of Poverty in Africa
Consider next the issue of poverty in Africa. In the final two decades of the twentieth
century, the world economy grew rapidly, and the average per capita income (income
per person) increased by about 35 percent. In contrast, the economies of poverty-
stricken sub-Saharan Africa shrank, and per capita income decreased by about 6 per-
cent. Africa is the worlds second-largest continent in both area and population and
accounts for more than 12 percent of the worlds human population. Figure 1.1 shows
a map of Africa. The countries of sub-Saharan Africa are highlighted in yellow.
1.2

Economists have found that as a nations economy grows, its poorest households
share in the general prosperity.2 Therefore, one way to reduce poverty in sub-Saharan
Africa is to increase economic growth. Economic growth occurs when a country
expands its production facilities (machinery and factories), improves its public infra-
structure (highways and water systems), widens educational opportunities, and adopts
new technology.
The recent experience of sub-Saharan Africa is somewhat puzzling because in
the last few decades the region has expanded educational opportunities and
received large amounts of foreign aid. Some recent work by economists on the
sources of growth suggests that institutions such as the legal system and the regula-
tory environment also play key roles in economic growth.3 In sub-Saharan Africa, a
simple legal dispute about a small debt takes about 30 months to resolve, compared
to 5 months in the United States. In Mozambique, it takes 174 days to complete
the procedures required to set up a business, compared to just 2 days in Canada. In
many cases, institutions impede rather than encourage the sort of investment and
risk taking
called entrepreneurship
that causes economic growth and reduces
poverty. As a consequence, economists and policymakers are exploring ways to
reform the region s institutions. They are also challenged with choosing among
development projects that will generate the biggest economic boost per dollar
spent
the biggest bang per buck.
Economic View of the Current World Recession
Over the last several decades, the U.S. economy has performed well and has raised our
standard of living. The general consensus was that our policymakers had learned to
manage the economy effectively. Although the economy faltered at times, policy-
makers seemed to know how to restore growth and prosperity.
That is why the financial crisis and the recession that began in late 2007 has so
shaken the confidence of people in the United States and around the world. The
problems started innocently enough, with a booming market for homes that was

fueled by easy credit from financial institutions. But we later discovered that many
purchasers of homes and properties could not really afford them, and when many
homeowners had trouble making their mortgage payments, the trouble spread to
banks and other financial institutions. As a result, businesses found it increasingly dif-
ficult to borrow money for everyday use and investment, and economic activity
around the world began to contract.
The major countries of the world have implemented aggressive policies to try to
halt this downturn. Policymakers want to avoid the catastrophes that hit the global
economy in the 1930s. Fortunately, they can draw on many years of experience in eco-
nomic policy to guide the economy during this difficult time.
THE ECONOMIC WAY OF THINKING
How do economists think about problems and decision making? The economic way of
thinking is best summarized by British economist John Maynard Keynes (1883 1946):4
The theory of economics does not furnish a body of settled conclusions immediately
applicable to policy. It is a method rather than a doctrine, an apparatus of the mind, a tech-
nique of thinking which helps its possessor draw correct conclusions.
Lets look at the four elements of the economic way of thinking.
Use Assumptions to Simplify
Economists use assumptions to make things simpler and focus attention on what
really matters. If you use a road map to plan a car trip from Seattle to San Francisco,
you make two unrealistic assumptions to simplify your planning:
The earth is flat: The flat road map doesn t show the curvature of the earth.
The roads are flat: The standard road map doesn t show hills and valleys.
Instead of a map, you could use a globe that shows all the topographical features
between Seattle and San Francisco, but you don t need those details to plan your trip.
A map, with its unrealistic assumptions, will suffice because the curvature of the earth
and the topography of the highways are irrelevant to your trip. Although your analy-
sis is based on two unrealistic assumptions, that does not mean your analysis is invalid.
Similarly, if economic analysis is based on unrealistic assumptions, that doesn t mean
the analysis is faulty.
What if you decide to travel by bike instead of by automobile? Now the
assumption of flat roads really matters, unless of course you are eager to pedal up
and down mountains. If you use a standard map, and thus assume there are no
mountains between the two cities, you may inadvertently pick a mountainous route
instead of a flat one. In this case, the simplifying assumption makes a difference.
The lesson is that we must think carefully about whether a simplifying assumption
is truly harmless.
Isolate Variables
Ceteris Paribus
Economic analysis often involves variables and how they affect one another. A variable
is a measure of something that can take on different values, for example, your grade
point average. Economists are interested in exploring relationships between two
variables
like the relationship between the price of apples and the quantity of apples
consumers purchase. Of course, the quantity of apples purchased depends on many
other variables, including the consumer s income. To explore the relationship between
the quantity and price of apples, we must assume that the consumer s income
and
1.3
variable
A measure of something that can take on
different values.

anything else that influences apple purchases
doesn t change during the time period
we re considering.
Alfred Marshall (1842 1924) was a British economist who refined the economic
model of supply and demand and provided a label for this process.5 He picked one
variable that affected apple purchases (price) and threw the other variable (income)
into what he called the pound  (in Marshall s time, the pound  was an enclosure for
holding stray cattle; nowadays, a pound is for stray dogs). That variable waited in the
pound while Marshall examined the influence of the first variable. Marshall labeled
the pound ceteris paribus, the Latin expression meaning that other variables are
held fixed:
. . . the existence of other tendencies is not denied, but their disturbing effect is neglected
for a time. The more the issue is narrowed, the more exactly can it be handled.
This book contains many statements about the relationship between two vari-
ables. For example, the quantity of computers produced by Dell depends on the price
of computers, the wage of computer workers, and the cost of microchips. When we
say, An increase in the price of computers increases the quantity of computers pro-
duced,  we are assuming that the other two variables
the wage and the cost of
microchips
do not change. That is, we apply the ceteris paribus assumption.
Think at the Margin
Economists often consider how a small change in one variable affects another vari-
able and what impact that has on people s decision making. In other words, if circum-
stances change only slightly, how will people respond? A small, one-unit change in
value is called a marginal change. The key feature of marginal change is that the
first variable changes by only one unit. For example, you might ask, If I study just
one more hour, by how much will my exam score increase?  Economists call this
process thinking at the margin.  Thinking at the margin is like thinking on the
edge. You will encounter marginal thinking throughout this book. Here are some
other marginal questions:
If I keep my barbershop open one more hour, by how much will my revenue
increase?
If I stay in school and earn another degree, by how much will my lifetime earn-
ings increase?
If a car dealer hires one more sales associate, how many more cars will the
dealer sell?
As we ll see in the next chapter, economists use the answer to a marginal question as a
first step in deciding whether to do more or less of something, for example, whether
to keep your barbershop open one more hour.
Rational People Respond to Incentives
A key assumption of most economic analysis is that people act rationally,
meaning they act in their own self-interest. Scottish philosopher Adam Smith
(1723 1790), who is also considered the founder of economics, wrote that he discov-
ered within humankind6
a desire of bettering our condition, a desire which, though generally calm and dispassion-
ate, comes with us from the womb, and never leaves us until we go to the grave.

PART 1
Smith didn t say people are motivated exclusively by self-interest, but rather that self-
interest is more powerful than kindness or altruism. In this book, we will assume that
people act in their own self-interest. Rational people respond to incentives. When the
payoff, or benefit, from doing something changes, people change their behavior to get
the benefit.
Example: London Addresses its Congestion Problem
To illustrate the economic way of thinking, let s consider again how an economist
would approach the problem of traffic congestion. Recall that each driver on the
highway slows down other drivers but ignores these time costs when deciding
whether to use the highway. If the government imposes a congestion tax to reduce
traffic during rush hour, the economist is faced with a question: How high should
the tax be?
To determine the appropriate congestion tax, an economist would assume that
people respond to incentives and use the three other elements of the economic way
of thinking:
Use assumptions to simplify. To simplify the problem, we would assume that
every car has the same effect on the travel time of other cars. Of course, this is
unrealistic because people drive cars of different sizes in different ways. But the
alternative
looking at the effects of each car on travel speeds
would need-
lessly complicate the analysis.
A P P L I C AT I O N 1
RESPONDING TO PRODUCTION REWARDS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: Do people respond to incentives?
To illustrate the notion that people are rational and respond to incentives, consider an
experiment conducted by the managers of a Chinese factory that produces electronic
products such as GPS navigation devices and notebook computers. Workers were
divided into three groups: Workers in the control group were simply paid their regu-
lar wages, while workers in the second and third groups (treatment groups) were
promised a bonus of about $12 if their weekly output exceeded a production target.
For the two treatment groups, the language of the bonus was slightly different.
Workers in the reward  group were simply told that if they met the target they would
get the bonus. Workers in the punishment  group were told that they had tentatively
been awarded the bonus, but that they would lose  the bonus if their output fell short
of the production target.
The results of this experiment revealed the power
and the subtleties
of
incentives. Compared to the control group, the output of workers in the treatment
groups was on average 7 percent higher. In other words, the possibility of a bonus
increased productivity by 7 percent. Among the workers in the two treatment
groups, productivity was on average 1 percent higher for workers in the punishment
group. This suggests that the fear of a loss provides a greater incentive than prospect
of a gain.

Isolate variables
use ceteris paribus. To focus attention on the effects of a
congestion tax on the number of cars using the highway, we would make the
ceteris paribus assumption that everything else that affects travel behavior
the
price of gasoline, bus fares, and consumer income
remains fixed.
Think at the margin. To think at the margin, we would estimate the effects of
adding one more car to the highway. Now consider the marginal question: If
we add one more car to the highway, by how much does the total travel time
for commuters increase? Once we answer this question, we can determine the
cost imposed by the marginal driver. If the marginal driver forces each of the
900 commuters to spend two extra seconds on the highway, total travel time
increases by 30 minutes. If the value of time is, say, $16 per hour, the appro-
priate congestion tax would be $8 (equal to $16 * 1/2 hour).
If the idea of charging people for using roads seems odd, consider the city of
London, which for decades had experienced the worst congestion in Europe.
In February 2003, the city imposed an $8 tax per day to drive in the city between
7:00 A.M. and 6:30 P.M. The tax reduced traffic volume and cut travel times for cars
and buses in half. Because the tax reduced the waste and inefficiency of congestion,

THE ECONOMIC SOLUTION TO SPAM
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: What is the role of prices in allocating
resources?
Spam
unwanted commercial e-mail
torments people around the world, interrupt-
ing their work and congesting their computer networks. Whats more, spam is spread-
ing to cell phones, with annoying beeps to announce its arrival and sometimes a
$0.20 charge to the recipient. A spammer pays nothing to send a million e-mail mes-
sages, but earns a profit if just a few people buy an advertised product. The first
response to the spam problem was a system of e-mail filters to separate spam from
legitimate e-mail. When that didn t work, many states passed laws that made spam
illegal. Despite these efforts, the spam problem persists.
The economic approach to spam is to establish a price for commercial e-mail.
One idea is to follow the lead of snail mail and require a $0.01 electronic stamp for
each commercial e-mail message. A bundle of one million e-mails would cost
$10,000, so if a spammer expects just a few people to buy an advertised product,
spamming won t be profitable. A second approach is to charge senders a penalty of
$1 for each e-mail that is declared unwanted  by a recipient. If each e-mail
account has a credit limit of $200, the sender s internet service provider (ISP)
would shut down an account once it receives 200 complaints. This actually solves
the problem of viral spam because if a virus turns your grandmother s computer
into a spam machine, her account will be shut down
and the spreading of the
virus will stop
after 200 complaints. Of course, the ISP must be clever enough to
quickly realize that grandma is not a spammer, and then reconnect her.

unemployment, and economic growth.

other cities, including Toronto, Singapore, and San Diego, have implemented conges-
tion pricing.
PREVIEW OF COMING ATTRACTIONS:
MACROECONOMICS
The field of economics is divided into two categories: macroeconomics and micro-
economics. Macroeconomics is the study of the nation s economy as a whole;
it focuses on the issues of inflation (a general rise in prices), unemployment, and
economic growth. These issues are regularly discussed on Web sites, in newspapers,
and on television. Macroeconomics explains why economies grow and change and
why economic growth is sometimes interrupted. Let s look at three ways we can
use macroeconomics.
Using Macroeconomics to Understand Why Economies Grow
As we discussed earlier in the chapter, the world economy has been growing in recent
decades, with per capita income increasing by about 1.5 percent per year. Increases in
income translate into a higher standard of living for consumers
better cars, houses,
and clothing and more options for food, entertainment, and travel. People in a grow-
ing economy can consume more of all goods and services because the economy has
more of the resources needed to produce these products. Macroeconomics explains
why resources increase over time and the consequences for our standard of living.
Lets look at a practical question about economic growth.
Why do some countries grow much faster than others? Between 1960 and 2001,
the economic growth rate was 2.2 percent per year in the United States, compared
to 2.3 percent in Mexico and 2.7 percent in France. But in some countries, the econ-
omy actually shrunk, and per capita income dropped. Among the countries with
declining income were Sierra Leone and Haiti. In the fastest-growing countries, cit-
izens save a large fraction of the money they earn. Firms can then borrow the funds
saved to purchase machinery and equipment that make their workers more produc-
tive. The fastest-growing countries also have well-educated workforces, allowing
firms to quickly adopt new technologies that increase worker productivity.
Using Macroeconomics to Understand Economic Fluctuations
All economies, including those that experience a general trend of rising per capita
income, are subject to economic fluctuations, including periods when the economy tem-
porarily shrinks. During an economic downturn, some of the economys resources
natural resources, labor, physical capital, human capital, and entrepreneurship
are idle.
Some workers are unemployed, and some factories and stores are closed. By con-
trast, sometimes the economy grows too rapidly, causing prices to rise.
Macroeconomics helps us understand why these fluctuations occur
why the
economy sometimes cools and sometimes overheats
and what the government
can do to moderate the fluctuations. Let s look at a practical question about eco-
nomic fluctuations.
Should Congress and the president do something to reduce the unemployment
rate? For example, should the government cut taxes to free up income to spend on
consumer goods, thus encouraging firms to hire more workers to produce more out-
put? If unemployment is very high, the government may want to reduce it. However,
1.4

CHAPTER 1
INTRODUCTION: WHAT IS ECONOMICS?
12
it is important not to reduce the unemployment rate too much, because, as we ll see
later in the book, a low unemployment rate will cause inflation.
Using Macroeconomics to Make Informed Business Decisions
A third reason for studying macroeconomics is to make informed business decisions. As
we ll see later in the book, the government uses various policies to influence interest
rates (the price of borrowing money) and the inflation rate. A manager who intends to
borrow money for a new factory or store could use knowledge of macroeconomics to
predict the effects of current public policies on interest rates and then decide whether
to borrow the money now or later. Similarly, a manager must keep an eye on the infla-
tion rate to help decide how much to charge for the firms products and how much to
pay workers. A manager who studies macroeconomics will be better equipped to
understand the complexities of interest rates and inflation and how they affect the firm.
PREVIEW OF COMING ATTRACTIONS:
MICROECONOMICS
Microeconomics is the study of the choices made by households (an individual or a
group of people living together), firms, and government and how these choices affect
the markets for goods and services. Let s look at three ways we can use micro-
economic analysis.
Using Microeconomics to Understand Markets and Predict Changes
One reason for studying microeconomics is to better understand how markets work
and to predict how various events affect the prices and quantities of products in mar-
kets. In this book, we answer many practical questions about markets and how they
operate. Let s look at a practical question that can be answered with some simple eco-
nomic analysis.
How would a tax on beer affect the number of highway deaths among young adults?
Research has shown that the number of highway fatalities among young adults is roughly
proportional to the total amount of beer consumed by that group. A tax on beer would
make the product more expensive, and young adults, like other beer drinkers,
would therefore consume less of it. Consequently, a tax that decreases beer consumption
by 10 percent will decrease highway deaths among young adults by about 10 percent, too.
Using Microeconomics to Make Personal and Managerial
Decisions
On the personal level, we use economic analysis to decide how to spend our time,
what career to pursue, and how to spend and save the money we earn. Managers use
economic analysis to decide how to produce goods and services, how much to pro-
duce, and how much to charge for them. Let s use some economic analysis to look at a
practical question confronting someone considering starting a business.
If the existing coffee shops in your city are profitable and you have enough money
to start your own shop, should you do it? If you enter this market, the competition
among the shops for consumers will heat up, causing some coffee shops to drop their
prices. In addition, your costs may be higher than the costs of the stores that are
already established. It would be sensible to enter the market only if you expect a small
drop in price and a small difference in costs. Indeed, entering what appears to be a
lucrative market may turn out to be a financial disaster.
1.5
microeconomics
The study of the choices made by
households, firms, and government and
how these choices affect the markets for
goods and services.

13
Using Microeconomics to Evaluate Public Policies
Although modern societies use markets to make most of the decisions about produc-
tion and consumption, the government does fulfill several important roles. We can use
economic analysis to determine how well the government performs its roles in the
market economy. We can also explore the trade-offs associated with various public
policies. Let s look at a practical question about public policy.
Like other innovations, prescription drugs are protected by government patents,
giving the developer the exclusive right to sell a new drug for a fixed period of time.
Once the patent expires, other pharmaceutical companies can legally produce and sell
generic versions of the drug, which causes its price to drop. Should drug patents be
shorter? Shortening the patent has trade-offs. The good news is that generic versions
of the drug will be available sooner, so prices will drop sooner and more people will
use the drug to improve their health. The bad news is that the financial payoff from
developing new drugs will be smaller, so pharmaceutical companies won t develop as
many new drugs. The question is whether the benefit of shorter patents (lower prices)
exceeds the cost (fewer drugs developed).
Economics is about making choices when
options are limited. Options in an econ-
omy are limited because the factors of
production are limited. We can use eco-
nomic analysis to understand the conse-
quences of our choices as individuals,
organizations, and society as a whole.
Here are the main points of the chapter:
1 Most of modern economics is based on
positive analysis, which answers the
question What is?  or What will be?
Economists contribute to policy debates
by conducting positive analyses about
the consequences of alternative actions.
2 Normative analysis answers the question What ought to be?
3 The choices made by individuals, firms, and governments
answer three questions: What products do we produce? How
do we produce the products? Who consumes the products?
4 To think like an economist, we (a) use assumptions to simplify,
(b) use the notion of ceteris paribus to focus on the relation-
ship between two variables, (c) think in marginal terms, and
(d) assume that rational people respond to incentives.
5 We use macroeconomics to understand why economies
grow, to understand economic fluctuations, and to make
informed business decisions.
6 We use microeconomics to understand how markets work, to
make personal and managerial decisions, and to evaluate the
merits of public policies.

US I NG GR AP HS  AND PE RC ENTAGES
Economists use several types of graphs to present data, represent relationships
between variables, and explain concepts. In this appendix, we review the mechanics of
graphing variables. We ll also review the basics of computing percentage changes and
using percentages to compute changes in variables.
USING GRAPHS
A quick flip through the book will reveal the importance of graphs in economics.
Every chapter has at least several graphs, and many chapters have more. Although
it is possible to do economics without graphs, it s a lot easier with them in
your toolbox.
Graphing Single Variables
As we saw earlier in Chapter 1, a variable is a measure of something that can take on
different values. Figure 1A.1 shows two types of graphs, each presenting data on a sin-
gle variable. Panel A uses a pie graph to show the breakdown of U.S. music sales by
type of music. The greater the sales of a type of music, the larger the pie slice. For
example, the most popular type is rock music, comprising 24 percent of the market.
The next largest type is country, followed by rap/hip-hop, R&B/urban, and so on.
Panel B of Figure 1A.1 uses a bar graph to show the revenue from foreign sales
(exports) of selected U.S. industries. The larger the revenue, the taller the bar. For
example, the bar for computer software, with export sales of about $60 billion, is over
three times taller than the bar for motion pictures, TV, and video, with export sales of
$17 billion.

over time. Panel A of Figure 1A.2 shows a time-series graph, with the total dollar
value of a hypothetical industry for years 1 through 10. Time is measured on the
horizontal axis, and sales are measured on the vertical axis. The height of the line in a
particular year shows the value in that year. For example, in Year 1 the value was

over the next several years.
Panel B of Figure 1A.2 shows a truncated version of the graph in Panel A. The dou-
ble hash marks in the lower part of the vertical axis indicate that the axis doesn t start
from zero. This truncation of the vertical axis exaggerates the fluctuations in total sales.
Graphing Two Variables
We can also use a graph to show the relationship between two variables. Figure 1A.3
shows the basic elements of a two-variable graph. One variable is measured along the
horizontal, or x, axis, while the other variable is measured along the vertical, or y, axis.
The origin is the intersection of the two axes, where the values of both variables are
zero. Dashed lines show the values of the two variables at a particular point. For exam-
ple, for point a, the value of the horizontal, or x, variable is 10, and the value of the
vertical, or y, variable is 13.
To see how to draw a two-variable graph, suppose that you have a part-time job
and you are interested in the relationship between the number of hours you work and
your weekly income. The relevant variables are the hours of work per week and your
weekly income. In Figure 1A.4, the table shows the relationship between the hours
worked and income. Lets assume that your weekly allowance from your parents is $40
and your part-time job pays $8 per hour. If you work 10 hours per week, for example,
your weekly income is $120 ($40 from your parents and $80 from your job). The more
you work, the higher your weekly income: If you work 20 hours, your weekly income
is $200; if you work 30 hours, it is $280.
Although a table with numbers is helpful in showing the relationship between
work hours and income, a graph makes it easier to see the relationship. We can use
data in a table to draw a graph. To do so, we perform five simple steps:
1 Draw a horizontal line to represent the first variable. In Figure 1A.4, we measure
hours worked along the horizontal axis. As we move to the right along the hori-
zontal axis, the number of hours worked increases, from 0 to 30 hours.

Basic Elements of a Two-Variable Graph
One variable is measured along the horizontal, or x, axis, while the other variable is measured along
the vertical, or y, axis. The origin is defined as the intersection of the two axes, where the values of
both variables are zero. The dashed lines show the values of the two variables at a particular point.

18
2 Draw a vertical line intersecting the first line to represent the second variable. In
Figure 1A.4, we measure income along the vertical axis. As we move up along the
vertical axis, income increases from $0 to $280.
3 Start with the first row of numbers in the table, which shows that with 0 hours
worked, income is $40. The value of the variable on the horizontal axis is 0, and
the value of the variable on the vertical axis is $40, so we plot point a on the
graph. This is the vertical intercept
the point where the curve cuts or intersects
the vertical axis.
4 Pick a combination with a positive number for hours worked. For example, in the
second row of numbers, if you work 10 hours, your income is $120.
4.1 Find the point on the horizontal axis with that number of hours worked
10 hours
and draw a dashed line vertically straight up from that point.
4.2 Find the point on the vertical axis with the income corresponding to those
hours worked
$120
and draw a dashed line horizontally straight to the
right from that point.
4.3 The intersection of the dashed lines shows the combination of hours
worked and income. Point b shows the combination of 10 hours worked
and $120 in income.
5 Repeat step 4 for different combinations of work time and income shown in the table.
Once we have a series of points on the graph (a, b, c, and d), we can connect them to
draw a curve that shows the relationship between hours worked and income.

A relationship in which two variables
move in the same direction.
negative relationship
A relationship in which two variables
move in opposite directions.
slope of a curve
The vertical difference between two
points (the rise) divided by the horizontal
difference (the run).
There is a positive relationship between two variables if they move in the same
direction. As you increase your work time, your income increases, so there is a positive
relationship between the two variables. In Figure 1A.4, as the number of hours
worked increases, you move upward along the curve to higher income levels. Some
people refer to a positive relationship as a direct relationship.
There is a negative relationship between two variables if they move in
opposite directions. For example, there is a negative relationship between the
amount of time you work and the time you have available for other activities such
as recreation, study, and sleep. Some people refer to a negative relationship as an
inverse relationship.
Computing the Slope
How sensitive is one variable to changes in the other variable? We can use the slope of
the curve to measure this sensitivity. To compute the slope of a curve, we pick two
points and divide the vertical difference between the two points (the rise) by the hori-
zontal difference (the run):
To compute the slope of a curve, we take four steps:
1 Pick two points on the curve, for example, points b and c in Figure 1A.4.
2 Compute the vertical difference between the two points (the rise). For points b
and c, the vertical difference between the points is $80 ($200  $120).
3 Compute the horizontal distance between the same two points (the run). For
points b and c, the horizontal distance between the points is 10 hours (20 hours 
10 hours).
4 Divide the vertical distance by the horizontal distance to get the slope. The slope
between points b and c is $8 per hour:
In this case, a 10-hour increase in time worked increases income by $80, so
the increase in income per hour of work is $8, which makes sense because this is
the hourly wage. Because the curve is a straight line, the slope is the same at all
points along the curve. You can check this yourself by computing the slope
between points c and d.
We can use some shorthand to refer to the slope of a curve. The mathematical
symbol 
(delta) represents the change in a variable. So we can write the slope of the
curve in Figure 1A.4 as
In general, if the variable on the vertical axis is y and the variable on the horizontal axis
is x, we can express the slope as
Slope =

Moving Along the Curve versus Shifting the Curve
Up to this point, we ve explored the effect of changes in variables that cause move-
ment along a given curve. In Figure 1A.4, we see the relationship between hours of
work (on the horizontal axis) and income (on the vertical axis). Because the total
income also depends on the allowance and the wage, we can make two observations
about the curve in Figure 1A.4:
1 To draw this curve, we must specify the weekly allowance ($40) and the hourly
wage ($8).
2 The curve shows that an increase in time worked increases the students income,
ceteris paribus. In this case, we are assuming that the allowance and the wage are
both fixed.
A change in the weekly allowance will shift the curve showing the relationship
between work time and income. In Figure 1A.5, when the allowance increases from
$40 to $90 the curve shifts upward by $50: For a given number of work hours, income
increases by $50. For example, the income associated with 10 hours of work is $170
(point f ), compared to $120 with the original allowance (point b). The upward shift
also means that to reach a given amount of income, fewer work hours are required. In
other words, the curve shifts upward and to the left.
We can distinguish between movement along a curve and a shift of the entire
curve. In Figure 1A.5, an increase in the hours worked causes movement along a sin-
gle income curve. For example, if the allowance is $40, we are operating on the lower
of the two curves, and if the hours worked increases from 10 to 20, we move from
point b to point c. In contrast, if something other than the hours worked changes, we
shift the entire curve, as we ve seen with an increase in the allowance.
This book uses dozens of two-dimensional curves, each of which shows the rela-
tionship between only two variables. A common error is to forget that a single curve
tells only part of the story. In Figure 1A.5, we needed two curves to explore the effects

Movement Along a Curve versus Shifting the Curve
To draw a curve showing the relationship between hours worked and income, we fix the weekly
allowance ($40) and the wage ($8 per hour). A change in the hours worked causes movement along
the curve, for example, from point b to point c. A change in any other variable shifts the entire curve.
For example, a $50 increase in the allowance (to $90) shifts the entire curve upward by $50.

of changes in three variables. Here are some simple rules to keep in mind when you
use two-dimensional graphs:
A change in one of the variables shown on the graph causes movement along the
curve. In Figure 1A.5, an increase in work time causes movement along the
curve from point a to point b, to point c, and so on.
A change in one of the variables that is not shown on the graph
one of the vari-
ables held fixed in drawing the curve
shifts the entire curve. In Figure 1A.5, an
increase in the allowance shifts the entire curve upward.
Graphing Negative Relationships
We can use a graph to show a negative relationship between two variables.
Consider a consumer who has an annual budget of $360 to spend on CDs at a
price of $12 per CD and downloaded music at a price of $1 per song. The table in
Figure 1A.6 shows the relationship between the number of CDs and downloaded
songs. A consumer who doesn t buy any CDs has $360 to spend on downloaded
songs and can get 360 of them at a price of $1 each. A consumer who buys 10 CDs
at $12 each has $240 left to spend on downloaded songs (point b). Moving down

There is a negative relationship between the number of CDs and downloaded songs that a con-

price of $12 each) decreases the number of downloadable songs (at $1 each) by 12 songs.

through the table, as the number of CDs increases, the number of downloaded
songs decreases.
The graph in Figure 1A.6 shows the negative relationship between the number
of CDs and the number of downloaded songs. The vertical intercept (point a)
shows that a consumer who doesn t buy any CDs can afford 360 downloaded songs.
There is a negative relationship between the number of CDs and downloaded
songs, so the curve is negatively sloped. We can use points b and c to compute the
slope of the curve:
The slope is 12 downloaded songs per CD: For each additional CD, the consumer
sacrifices 12 downloaded songs.
Graphing Nonlinear Relationships
We can also use a graph to show a nonlinear relationship between two variables.
Panel A of Figure 1A.7 shows the relationship between hours spent studying for
an exam and the grade on the exam. As study time increases, the grade increases,

Nonlinear Relationships
(A) Study time There is a positive and nonlinear relationship between study time and the grade on
an exam. As study time increases, the exam grade increases at a decreasing rate. For example, the
second hour of study increased the grade by 4 points (from 6 points to 10 points), but the ninth hour
of study increases the grade by only 1 point (from 24 points to 25 points).
(B) Production cost There is a positive and nonlinear relationship between the quantity of grain pro-
duced and total production cost. As the quantity increases, the total cost increases at an increasing rate.
For example, to increase production from 1 ton to 2 tons, production cost increases by $5 (from $10 to
$15) but to increase the production from 10 to 11 tons, total cost increases by $25 (from $100 to $125).

but at a decreasing rate. In other words, each additional hour increases the exam
grade by a smaller and smaller amount. For example, the second hour of study
increases the grade by 4 points
from 6 to 10 points
but the ninth hour of study
increases the grade by only 1 point
from 24 points to 25 points. This is a non-
linear relationship: The slope of the curve changes as we move along the curve. In
Figure 1A.7, the slope decreases as we move to the right along the curve: The
slope is 4 points per hour between points a and b but only 1 point per hour
between points c and d.
Another possibility for a nonlinear curve is that the slope increases as we move to
the right along the curve. Panel B of Figure 1A.7 shows the relationship between the
amount of grain produced on the horizontal axis and the total cost of production on
the vertical axis. The slope of the curve increases as the amount of grain increases,
meaning that production cost increases at an increasing rate. On the lower part of the
curve, increasing output from 1 ton to 2 tons increases production cost by $5, from
$10 to $15. On the upper part of the curve, increasing output from 10 to 11 tons
increases production cost by $25, from $100 to $125.
COMPUTING PERCENTAGE CHANGES AND
USING EQUATIONS
Economists often express changes in variables in terms of percentage changes. This
part of the appendix provides a brief review of the mechanics of computing per-
centage changes. It also reviews some simple rules for solving equations to find
missing values.
Computing Percentage Changes
In many cases, the equations that economists use involve percentage changes.
In this book, we use a simple approach to computing percentage changes: We
divide the change in the variable by the initial value of the variable and then mul-
tiply by 100:
For example, if the price of a book increases from $20 to $22, the percentage change
is 10 percent:
Going in the other direction, suppose the price decreases from $20 to $19. In this
case, the percentage change is 5 percent:
Percentage change = 19 - 20
20
* 100 = - 1
20 * 100 = -5%
Percentage change = 22 - 20
20
* 100 = 2
20 * 100 = 10%
Percentage change = New value - initial value
Initial value
* 100
1A.2

24
The alternative to this simple approach is to base the percentage change on the
average value, or the midpoint, of the variable:
For example, if the price of a book increases from $20 to $22, the computed percent-
age change under the midpoint approach is 9.52 percent:
If the change in the variable is relatively small, the extra precision associated with
the midpoint approach is usually not worth the extra effort. The simple approach
allows us to spend less time doing tedious arithmetic and more time doing economic
analysis. In this book, we use the simple approach to compute percentage changes: If
the price increases from $20 to $22, the price has increased by 10 percent.
If we know a percentage change, we can translate it into an absolute change. For
example, if a price has increased by 10 percent and the initial price is $20, then we
add 10 percent of the initial price ($2 is 10 percent of $20) to the initial price ($20),
for a new price of $22. If the price decreases by 5 percent, we subtract 5 percent of

THE PERILS OF PERCENTAGES
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: How do we compute percentage changes?
In the 1970s the government of Mexico City repainted the highway lane lines on the
Viaducto to transform a four-lane highway into a six-lane highway. The government
announced that the highway capacity had increased by 50 percent (equal to 2 divided
by 4). Unfortunately, the number of collisions and traffic fatalities increased, and one
year later, the government restored the four-lane highway and announced that the
capacity had decreased by 33 percent (equal to 2 divided by 6). The government
announced that the net effect of the two changes was an increase in the highway
capacity by 17 percent (equal to 50 percent minus 33 percent).
This anecdote reveals a potential problem with using the simple approach to
compute percentage changes. Because the initial value (the denominator) changes, the
computation of percentage increases and decreases are not symmetric. In contrast, if
the government had used the midpoint method, the percentage increase in capacity
would be 40 percent (equal to 2 divided by 5), the same as the percentage decrease. In
that case, we get the more sensible result that the net effect of the two changes is zero.

Using Equations to Compute Missing Values
It will often be useful to compute the value of the numerator or the denomina-
tor of an equation. To do so, we use simple algebra to rearrange the equation
to put the missing variable on the left side of the equation. For example, con-
sider the relationship between time worked and income. The equation for the
slope is
Suppose you want to compute how much income you ll earn by working more
hours. We can rearrange the slope equation by multiplying both sides of the equa-
tion by the change in work hours:
By swapping sides of the equation, we get
For example, if you work seven extra hours and the slope is $8, your income will
increase by $56:
We can use the same process to compute the difference in work time required to
achieve a target change in income. In this case, we multiply both sides of the slope
equation by the change in work time and then divide both sides by the slope. The
result is
For example, to increase your income by $56, you need to work seven hours:
¢Work hours = ¢Income
Slope
= $56
$8 = 7
¢Work hours = ¢ Income
Slope
¢ Income = ¢ Work hours * Slope = $7 * $8 = 56
¢ Income = ¢ Work hours * Slope
Work hours * Slope = ¢ Income
Slope =

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
What do we sacrifice by preserving tropical rainforests
rather than mining or logging the land? Recent experi-
ences in Guyana and other tropical countries suggest that
in some places, the answer is not much
only $1 per
hectare per year ($0.40 per acre per year).1 Conservation
groups have a new strategy for conserving rain forests
bidding against loggers and miners for the use of the land.
When the payoff from developing tropical forest land is rel-
atively low, conservation groups can outbid developers at
a price as low as $1 per hectare. When we add the cost of
hiring locals to manage the ecosystems, the total cost of
preservation is as low as $2 per hectare per year. A conser-
vation group based in Amherst, New Hampshire, started
by leasing 81,000 hectares of pristine forest in Guyana, and
since then has leased land in Peru, Sierra Leone, Papua
New Guinea, Fiji, and Mexico.

PART 1
I
n this chapter, we introduce five key principles that provide a foundation for eco-
nomic analysis. A principle is a self-evident truth that most people readily understand
and accept. For example, most people readily accept the principle of gravity. As you
read through the book, you will see the five key principles of economics again and again
as you do your own economic analysis.
THE PRINCIPLE OF OPPORTUNITY COST
Economics is all about making choices, and to make good choices we must com-
pare the benefit of something to its cost. Opportunity cost incorporates the
notion of scarcity: No matter what we do, there is always a trade-off. We must
trade off one thing for another because resources are limited and can be used in
different ways. By acquiring something, we use up resources that could have been
used to acquire something else. The notion of opportunity cost allows us to mea-
sure this trade-off.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  O P P O R T U N I T Y  C O S T
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
In most decisions we choose from several alternatives. For example, if you spend
an hour studying for an economics exam, you have one less hour to pursue other activ-
ities. To determine the opportunity cost of an activity, we look at what you consider
the best of these other  activities. For example, suppose the alternatives to studying
economics are studying for a history exam or working in a job that pays $10 per hour.
If you consider studying for history a better use of your time than working, then the
opportunity cost of studying economics is the four extra points you could have
received on a history exam if you studied history instead of economics. Alternatively, if
working is the best alternative, the opportunity cost of studying economics is the $10
you could have earned instead.
We can also apply the principle of opportunity cost to decisions about how to
spend money from a fixed budget. For example, suppose that you have a fixed budget
to spend on music. You can buy your music either at a local music store for $15 per
CD or online for $1 per song. The opportunity cost of 1 CD is 15 one-dollar online
songs. A hospital with a fixed salary budget can increase the number of doctors only at
the expense of nurses or physicians assistants. If a doctor costs five times as much as a
nurse, the opportunity cost of a doctor is five nurses.
In some cases, a product that appears to be free actually has a cost. That s why
economists are fond of saying, There s no such thing as a free lunch.  Suppose some-
one offers to buy you lunch if you agree to listen to a sales pitch for a time-share con-
dominium. Although you don t pay any money for the lunch, there is an opportunity
cost because you could spend that time in another way
such as studying for your
economics or history exam. The lunch isn t free because you sacrifice an hour of your
time to get it.
The Cost of College
What is the opportunity cost of a college degree? Consider a student who spends a
total of $40,000 for tuition and books. Instead of going to college, the student could
have spent this money on a wide variety of goods, including housing, electronic

of other goods the student sacrifices to pay for tuition and books. Also, instead of
going to college, the student could have worked as a bank clerk for $20,000 per year
and earned $80,000 over four years. That makes the total opportunity cost of this stu-
dents college degree $120,000:
We haven t included the costs of food or housing in our computations of oppor-
tunity cost. That s because a student must eat and live somewhere even if he or she
doesn t go to college. But if housing and food are more expensive in college, then we
would include the extra costs of housing and food in our calculations.
There are other things to consider in a person s decision to attend college. As
we ll see later, a college degree can increase a persons earning power, so there are ben-
efits from a college degree. In addition, college offers the thrill of learning and the
pleasure of meeting new people. To make an informed decision about whether to
attend college, we must compare the benefits to the opportunity costs.
The Cost of Military Spending
We can use the principle of opportunity cost to explore the cost of military spending.2
In 1992, Malaysia bought two warships. For the price of the warships, the country
could have built a system to provide safe drinking water for 5 million citizens who
lacked it. In other words, the opportunity cost of the warships was safe drinking water
for 5 million people. The policy question is whether the benefits of the warships
exceed their opportunity cost.
In the United States, economists have estimated that the cost of the war in Iraq
will be at least $1 trillion. The economists  calculations go beyond the simple bud-
getary costs and quantify the opportunity cost of the war. For example, the resources
used in the war could have been used in various government programs for children
to enroll more children in preschool programs, to hire more science and math teach-
ers to reduce class sizes, or to immunize more children in poor countries. For
example, each $100 billion spent on the war could instead support one of the follow-
ing programs:
Enroll 13 million preschool children in the Head Start program for one year.
Hire 1.8 million additional teachers for one year.
Immunize all the children in less-developed countries for the next 33 years.
The fact that the war has a large opportunity cost does not necessarily mean that
it is unwise. The policy question is whether the benefits from the war exceed its
opportunity cost. Taking another perspective, we can measure the opportunity cost of
war in terms of its implications for domestic security. The resources used in the war in
Iraq could have been used to improve domestic security by securing ports and cargo
facilities, hiring more police officers, improving the screening of airline passengers
and baggage, improving fire departments and other first responders, upgrading the
Coast Guard fleet, and securing our railroad and highway systems. The cost of imple-
menting the domestic-security recommendations of various government commissions
would be about $31 billion, a small fraction of the cost of the war. The question for

31
PART 1
policymakers is whether money spent on domestic security would be more beneficial
than money spent on the war.
Opportunity Cost and the Production Possibilities Curve
Just as individuals face limits, so do entire economies. As we saw in Chapter 1, the ability
of an economy to produce goods and services is determined by its factors of production,
including labor, natural resources, physical capital, human capital, and entrepreneurship.
Figure 2.1 shows a production possibilities graph for an economy that produces
wheat and steel. The horizontal axis shows the quantity of wheat produced by the
economy, and the vertical axis shows the quantity of steel produced. The shaded area
shows all the possible combinations of the two goods the economy can produce. At
point a, for example, the economy can produce 700 tons of steel and 10 tons of wheat.
In contrast, at point e, the economy can produce 300 tons of steel and 20 tons of
wheat. The set of points on the border between the shaded and unshaded area is called
the production possibilities curve (or production possibilities frontier) because it sepa-
rates the combinations that are attainable from those that are not. The attainable
combinations are shown by the shaded area within the curve and the curve itself. The
unattainable combinations are shown by the unshaded area outside the curve. The
points on the curve show the combinations that are possible if the economy s
resources are fully employed.
The production possibilities curve illustrates the notion of opportunity cost. If an
economy is fully utilizing its resources, it can produce more of one product only if it
produces less of another product. For example, to produce more wheat, we must take
resources away from steel. As we move resources out of steel, the quantity of steel
produced will decrease. For example, if we move from point a to point b along the
production possibilities curve

combinations of products that an
economy can produce, given that its
productive resources are fully employed

Scarcity and the Production Possibilities Curve
The production possibilities curve illustrates the principle of opportunity cost for an entire economy.
An economy has a fixed amount of resources. If these resources are fully employed, an increase in
the production of wheat comes at the expense of steel.

CHAPTER 2
THE KEY PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS
32
production possibilities curve in Figure 2.1, we sacrifice 50 tons of steel (700 tons 
650 tons) to get 10 more tons of wheat (20 tons  10 tons). Further down the curve, if
we move from point c to point d, we sacrifice 180 tons of steel to get the same 10-ton
increase in wheat.
Why is the production possibilities curve bowed outward, with the opportunity
cost of wheat increasing as we move down the curve? The reason is that resources are
not perfectly adaptable for the production of both goods. Some resources are more
suitable for steel production, while others are more suitable for wheat production.
Starting at point a, the economy uses its most fertile land to produce wheat. A 10-ton
increase in wheat reduces the quantity of steel by only 50 tons, because plenty of fer-
tile land is available for conversion to wheat farming. As the economy moves down-
ward along the production possibilities curve, farmers will be forced to use land that is
progressively less fertile, so to increase wheat output by 10 tons, more and more
resources must be diverted from steel production. In the move from point c to point d,
the land converted to farming is so poor that increasing wheat output by 10 tons
decreases steel output by 180 tons.
The production possibilities curve shows the production options for a given set of
resources. As shown in Figure 2.2, an increase in the amount of resources available to
the economy shifts the production possibilities outward. For example, if we start at
point f, and the economy s resources increase, we can produce more steel (point g),
more wheat (point h), or more of both goods (points between g and h). The curve will
also shift outward as a result of technological innovations that enable us to produce
more output with a given quantity of resources.

DON T FORGET THE COSTS OF TIME AND INVESTED FUNDS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: What is the opportunity cost of running
a business?
Betty has a degree in fine arts, and makes a unique product
decorative bottle-cap
pins. She paints recycled bottle caps with attractive images, and attaches a pin so the
bottle caps can be displayed on sweaters or jackets. She has asked you to compute the
annual cost of her business. She uses machines and tools that have a current market
value of $10,000. The annual cost of her raw materials (bottle caps, paint, pins) is
$2,000. She could be earning $30,000 in another job.
We can use the principle of opportunity cost to compute Bettys costs. In addition
to the $2,000 cost of raw materials, we must include two other sorts of costs:
Opportunity cost of funds invested. Betty could have invested the $10,000 in
a bank account. If the interest rate on a bank account is 8 percent, the annual
cost of her capital (machines and tools) is the $800 she could have earned in a
bank account during the year.
Opportunity cost of her time. The opportunity cost of Betty s time is the
$30,000 salary she sacrifices by being her own boss.
Adding the $800 cost of funds and the $30,000 cost of her time to the $2,000
materials cost, we find Betty s cost of doing business is $32,800 per year.

THE MARGINAL PRINCIPLE
Economics is about making choices, and we rarely make all-or-nothing choices. For
example, if you sit down to read a book, you don t read the entire book in a single sit-
ting, but instead decide how many pages or chapters to read. Economists think in
marginal terms, considering how a one-unit change in one variable affects the value of
another variable and people s decisions. When we say marginal, we re looking at the
effect of a small, or incremental, change.
The marginal principle is based on a comparison of the marginal benefits and
marginal costs of a particular activity. The marginal benefit of an activity is the
additional benefit resulting from a small increase in the activity. For example, the
marginal benefit of keeping a bookstore open for one more hour equals the addi-
tional revenue from book sales. Similarly, the marginal cost is the additional cost
resulting from a small increase in the activity. For example, the marginal cost of
keeping a bookstore open for one more hour equals the additional expenses for work-
ers and utilities for that hour. Applying the marginal principle, the bookstore should
stay open for one more hour if the marginal benefit (the additional revenue) is at least
as large as the marginal cost (the additional cost). For example, if the marginal bene-
fit is $80 of additional revenue and the marginal cost is $30 of additional expense for
workers and utilities, staying open for the additional hour increases the bookstore s
profit by $50.
M A R G I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds its
marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal benefit equals the
marginal cost.

The Marginal Principle and Movie Sequels
The marginal benefit of movies in a series decreases because revenue falls off with each additional
movie, while the marginal cost increases because actors demand higher salaries. The marginal
benefit exceeds the marginal cost for the first two movies, so it is sensible to produce two, but not
three, movies.
Thinking at the margin enables us to fine-tune our decisions. We can use the
marginal principle to determine whether a one-unit increase in a variable would make
us better off. Just as a bookstore owner could decide whether to stay open for one
more hour, you could decide whether to study one more hour for a psychology
midterm. When we reach the level where the marginal benefit equals the marginal
cost, we cannot do any better, and the fine-tuning is done.
How Many Movie Sequels?
To illustrate the marginal principle, lets consider movie sequels. When a movie is suc-
cessful, its producer naturally thinks about doing another movie, continuing the story
line with the same set of characters. If the first sequel is successful too, the producer
thinks about producing a second sequel, then a third, and so on. We can use the mar-
ginal principle to explore the decision of how many movies to produce.
Figure 2.3 shows the marginal benefits and marginal costs for movies. On
the benefit side, a movie sequel typically generates about 30 percent less revenue
than the original movie, and revenue continues to drop for additional movies.
In the second column of the table, the first movie generates $300 million in rev-
enue, the second generates $210 million, and the third generates $135 million.
This is shown in the graph as a negatively sloped marginal-benefit curve, with the

marginal benefit decreasing from $300 for the first movie (point a), to $210
(point b), and then to $135 (point c). On the cost side, the typical movie in the
United States costs about $50 million to produce and about $75 million to pro-
mote.3 In the third column of the table, the cost of the first movie (the original) is
$125 million. In the graph, this is shown as point d on the marginal-cost curve.
The marginal cost increases with the number of movies because film stars typi-
cally demand higher salaries to appear in sequels. In the table and the graph, the
marginal cost increases to $150 million for the second movie (point e) and to
$175 million for the third (point f ).
In this example, the first two movies are profitable, but the third is not. For the
original movie, the marginal benefit ($300 million at point a) exceeds the marginal
cost ($125 million at point d), generating a profit of $175 million. Although the
second movie has a higher cost and a lower benefit, it is profitable because the mar-
ginal benefit still exceeds the marginal cost, so the profit on the second movie is
$60 million ($210 million  $150 million). In contrast, the marginal cost of the
third movie of $175 million exceeds its marginal benefit of only $135 million, so
the third movie loses $40 million. In this example, the movie producer should stop
after the second movie.
Although this example shows that only two movies are profitable, other out-
comes are possible. If the revenue for the third movie were larger, making the mar-
ginal benefit greater than the marginal cost, it would be sensible to produce the
third movie. Similarly, if the marginal cost of the third movie were lower
if the
actors didn t demand such high salaries
the third movie could be profitable. Many
movies have had multiple sequels, such as Harry Potter and the Sorcerer s Stone and
Star Wars. Conversely, many profitable movies, such as Wedding Crashers and
Groundhog Day, didn t result in any sequels. In these cases, the expected drop-off in
revenues and run-up in costs for the second movie were large enough to make a
sequel unprofitable.
Renting College Facilities
Suppose that your student film society is looking for an auditorium to use for an all-
day Hitchcock film program and is willing to pay up to $200. Your college has a new
auditorium that has a daily rent of $450, an amount that includes $300 to help pay for
the cost of building the auditorium, $50 to help pay for insurance, and $100 to cover
the extra costs of electricity and janitorial services for a one-day event. If your film
society offers to pay $150 for using the auditorium, should the college accept the
offer? The college could use the marginal principle to make the decision.
To decide whether to accept your group s offer, the college should determine the
marginal cost of renting out the auditorium. The marginal cost equals the extra costs
the college incurs by allowing the student group to use an otherwise vacant audito-
rium. In our example, the extra cost is $100 for additional electricity and janitorial ser-
vices. It would be sensible for the college to rent the auditorium, because the marginal
benefit ($150 offered by the student group) exceeds the marginal cost ($100). In fact,
the college should be willing to rent the facility for any amount greater than $100. If
the students and the college split the difference between the $200 the students are
willing to pay and the $100 marginal cost, they would agree on a price of $150, leav-
ing both parties better off by $50.
Most colleges do not use this sort of logic. Instead, they use complex formulas to
compute the perceived cost of renting out a facility. In most cases, the perceived cost
includes some costs that the university bears even if it doesn t rent out the facility for
the day. In our example, the facility manager included $300 worth of construction costs
and $50 worth of insurance, for a total cost of $450 instead of just $100. Because many
colleges include costs that aren t affected by the use of a facility, they overestimate the

WHY NOT WALK UP AN ESCALATOR?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: How do people think at the margin?
Why do people walk up stairs, but do not walk up escalators? The rationale for
walking up stairs is obvious
if you just stand still, you won t get anywhere. If the
benefit of getting to the top of the stairs exceeds the cost (the walking effort), you ll
walk up the stairs. So why do most people stand still on escalators? This is a bit of a
puzzle because the cost of walking is the same whether you re on a staircase or an
escalator, and in both cases, walking allows you to arrive sooner and spend more
time at your destination.
We can use the marginal principle to solve this puzzle. Suppose you re on the
way to listen to a free concert, and you d be willing to pay $10 to hear the music.
Suppose your cost of walking up a long staircase is $3
that s how much you d be
willing to pay to avoid the staircase. Walking the staircase generates a net benefit of
$7 = $10  $3, so climbing the stairs is sensible. Suppose that the following week
you have the same music opportunity, but there is an escalator instead of a stair-
case. If you stand still on the escalator, you ll get the $10 benefit without any walk-
ing cost, so your net benefit would be $10. If you walk up the escalator, you will
arrive at your destination sooner and get to listen to more music, but there would
be a $3 walking cost. Should you walk or stand still? It depends on the marginal
benefit of the extra music you will hear if you walk up the escalator instead of
standing still, compared to the $3 marginal cost. If arriving sooner generates an
extra benefit less than $3, it will be sensible for you to stand still, like most people.

actual cost of renting out their facilities, missing opportunities to serve student groups
and make some money at the same time.
Automobile Emissions Standards
We can use the marginal principle to analyze emissions standards for automobiles.
The U.S. government specifies how much carbon monoxide a new car is allowed to
emit per mile. The marginal question is Should the standard be stricter, with
fewer units of carbon monoxide allowed?  On the benefit side, a stricter standard
reduces health-care costs resulting from pollution: If the air is cleaner, people with
respiratory ailments will make fewer visits to doctors and hospitals, have lower
medication costs, and lose fewer work days. On the cost side, a stricter standard
requires more expensive control equipment on cars and may also reduce fuel effi-
ciency. Using the marginal principle, the government should make the emissions
standard stricter as long as the marginal benefit (savings in health-care costs and
work time lost) exceeds the marginal cost (the cost of additional equipment and
extra fuel used).

PART 1
Driving Speed and Safety
Consider the decision about how fast to drive on a highway. The marginal benefit of
going one mile per hour faster is the travel time you ll save. On the cost side, an
increase in speed increases your chances of colliding with another car, and also
increases the severity of injuries suffered in a collision. A rational person will pick the
speed at which the marginal benefit of speed equals the marginal cost.
In the 1960s and 1970s, the federal government required automakers to include a
number of safety features, including seat belts and collapsible steering columns. These
new regulations had two puzzling effects. Although deaths from automobile collisions
decreased, the reduction was much lower than expected. In addition, more bicyclists
were hit by cars and injured or killed.
We can use the marginal principle to explain why seat belts and other safety features
made bicycling more hazardous. The mandated safety features decreased the marginal
cost of speed: People who wear seat belts suffer less severe injuries in a collision, so every
additional unit of speed is less costly. Drivers felt more secure because they were better
insulated from harm in the event of a collision, and so they drove faster. As a result, the
number of collisions between cars and bicycles increased, meaning that the safer envi-
ronment for drivers led to a more hazardous environment for bicyclists.
THE PRINCIPLE OF VOLUNTARY EXCHANGE
The principle of voluntary exchange is based on the notion that people act in their
own self-interest. Self-interested people won t exchange one thing for another unless
the trade makes them better off.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  V O L U N TA R Y  E X C H A N G E
A voluntary exchange between two people makes both people better off.
Here are some examples.
If you voluntarily exchange money for a college education, you must expect
you ll be better off with a college education. The college voluntarily provides an
education in exchange for your money, so the college must be better off, too.
If you have a job, you voluntarily exchange your time for money, and your
employer exchanges money for your labor services. Both you and your
employer are better off as a result.
Exchange and Markets
Adam Smith stressed the importance of voluntary exchange as a distinctly human trait.
He noticed4
a propensity in human nature . . . to truck, barter, and exchange one thing for another . . .
It is common to all men, and to be found in no other . . . animals . . . Nobody ever saw a
dog make a fair and deliberate exchange of one bone for another with another dog.
As we saw in Chapter 1, a market is an institution or arrangement that enables peo-
ple to exchange goods and services. If participation in a market is voluntary and

JASPER JOHNS AND HOUSEPAINTING
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: What is the rationale for specialization and
exchange?
Jasper Johns is a contemporary American artist whose painting False Start sold for
$80 million, the largest sum paid for a painting of a living artist. According to
Skate s Art Market Research, Mr. Johns is among the top 30 artists in terms of the
monetary value of art produced. Mr. Johns appears as a guest star in a 1999 episode
of The Simpsons in which Homer uses a mangled barbeque to launch a career as a
contemporary artist.
Mr. Johns is a very productive painter, and his painting skills presumably translate
into house painting. If Mr. Johns is ten times more productive at house painting than
a professional house painter, should he paint his own house? For example, suppose
Mr. Johns can paint his house in one day, compared to 10 days for a professional.
Should he take a day to paint his house, or hire someone who will take 10 days to com-
plete the same task?
We can use the principle of voluntary exchange to explain why Mr. Johns should
hire the less productive house painter to paint his house. If Mr. Johns can earn $5,000
per day painting works of art, the opportunity cost of house painting is $5,000
the
income he sacrifices by spending a day painting the house rather than producing
works of art. If the housepainter charges $150 per day, Mr. Johns could hire him to
paint the house for only $1,500. By switching one day from house painting to art pro-
duction, Mr. Johns earns $5,000 and incurs a cost of only $1,500, so he is better off by
$3,500. Mr. Johns specializes in what he does best, and then buys goods and services
from other people.
Related to Exercise 3.5.
people are well informed, both people in a transaction
buyer and seller
will be
better off. The next time you see a market transaction, listen to what people say
after money changes hands. If both people say thank you,  that s the principle of
voluntary exchange in action: The double thank you  reveals that both people are
better off.
The alternative to exchange is self-sufficiency: Each of us could produce every-
thing for him- or herself. As we ll see in the next chapter, it is more sensible to spe-
cialize, doing what we do best and then buying products from other people, who in
turn are doing what they do best. For example, if you are good with numbers but an
awful carpenter, you could specialize in accounting and buy furniture from Woody,
who could specialize in making furniture and pay someone to do his bookkeeping.
In general, exchange allows us to take advantage of differences in people s talents
and skills.
Online Games and Market Exchange
As another illustration of the power of exchange, consider the virtual world of online
games. Role-playing games such as World of Warcraft and EverQuest allow thousands of
people to interact online, moving their characters through a landscape of survival
challenges. Each player constructs a character
called an avatar
by choosing some
initial traits for it. The player then navigates the avatar through the games challenges,

39
PART 1
where it acquires skills and accumulates assets, including clothing, weapons, armor,
and even magic spells.
The curious part about these role-playing games is that players use real-life auc-
tion sites, including eBay and Yahoo! Auctions, to buy products normally acquired
in the game.5 Byron, who wants a piece of armor for his avatar (say, a Rubicite gir-
dle), can use eBay to buy one for $50 from Selma. The two players then enter the
online game, and Selma s avatar transfers the armor to Byron s avatar. It is even pos-
sible to buy another player s avatar, with all its skills and assets. Given the time
required to acquire various objects such as Rubicite girdles in the game and the
prices paid for them on eBay, the implicit wage earned by the typical online player
auctioning them off is $3.42 per hour: That s how much the player could earn by
first taking the time to acquire the assets in the game and then selling them on eBay.

FERTILIZER AND CROP YIELDS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: Do farmers experience diminishing returns?
The notion of diminishing returns applies to all inputs to the production process. For
example, one of the inputs in the production of corn is nitrogen fertilizer. Suppose a
farmer has a fixed amount of land (an acre) and must decide how much fertilizer to
apply. The first 50-pound bag of fertilizer will increase the crop yield by a relatively
large amount, but the second bag is likely to increase the yield by a smaller amount,
and the third bag is likely to have an even smaller effect. Because the farmer is chang-
ing just one of the inputs, the output will increase, but at a decreasing rate. Eventually,
additional fertilizer will actually decrease output as the other nutrients in the soil are
overwhelmed by the fertilizer.
Table 2.1 shows the relationship between the amount of fertilizer and the corn output.
The first 50-pound bag of fertilizer increases the crop yield from 85 to 120 bushels per
acre, a gain of 35 bushels. The next bag of fertilizer increases the yield by only 15 bushels
(from 120 to 135), followed by a gain of 9 bushels (from 135 to 144) and then a gain of only
3 bushels (from 144 to 147). The farmer experienced diminishing returns because the
other inputs to the production process are fixed.

hour. If she had known about the principle of diminishing returns, she would not
have been surprised.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  D I M I N I S H I N G  R E T U R N S
Suppose output is produced with two or more inputs, and we increase one
input while holding the other input or inputs fixed. Beyond some point
called the point of diminishing returns
output will increase at a decreas-
ing rate.
Xena added a worker (one input) while holding the number of copying
machines (the other input) fixed. Because the two workers must share a single
copying machine, each worker spent some time waiting for the machine to be
available. As a result, adding the second worker increased the number of copies,
but did not double the output. With a single worker and a single copy machine,
Xena has already reached the point of diminishing returns: As she increases the
number of workers, output increases, but at a decreasing rate. The first worker
increases output by 500 pages (from 0 to 500), but the second worker increases
output by only 300 pages (from 500 to 800).
Diminishing Returns from Sharing a Production Facility
This principle of diminishing returns is relevant when we try to produce more output
in an existing production facility (a factory, a store, an office, or a farm) by increasing
the number of workers sharing the facility. When we add a worker to the facility, each
worker becomes less productive because he or she works with a smaller piece of the
facility: More workers share the same machinery, equipment, and factory space. As we
pack more and more workers into the factory, total output increases, but at a decreas-
ing rate.
It s important to emphasize that diminishing returns occurs because one of the
inputs to the production process is fixed. When a firm can vary all its inputs, including
the size of the production facility, the principle of diminishing returns is not relevant.
For example, if a firm doubled all its inputs, building a second factory and hiring a sec-
ond workforce, we would expect the total output of the firm to at least double. The
principle of diminishing returns does not apply when a firm is flexible in choosing all
its inputs.
THE REAL-NOMINAL PRINCIPLE
One of the key ideas in economics is that people are interested not just in the amount
of money they have but also in how much their money will buy.
R E A L - N O M I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
What matters to people is the real value of money or income
its purchas-
ing power
not its face  value.

PART 1
To illustrate this principle, suppose you work in your college bookstore to earn
extra money for movies and snacks. If your take-home pay is $10 per hour, is this a
high wage or a low wage? The answer depends on the prices of the goods you buy. If
a movie costs $4 and a snack costs $1, with one hour of work you could afford to see
two movies and buy two snacks. The wage may seem high enough for you. But if a
movie costs $8 and a snack costs $2, an hour of work would buy only one movie and
one snack, and the same $10 wage doesn t seem so high. This is the real-nominal
principle in action: What matters is not how many dollars you earn, but what those
dollars will purchase.

THE DECLINING REAL MINIMUM WAGE
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #5: How does inflation affect the real
minimum wage?
Between 1974 and 2007, the federal minimum wage increased from $2.00 to $5.85.
Was the typical minimum-wage worker better or worse off in 2007? We can apply the
real-nominal principle to see whats happened over time to the real value of the federal
minimum wage.
As shown in the first row of Table 2.2, the minimum wage was $2.00 per hour in
1974, and by 2007 it had risen to $5.85. These are nominal figures, indicating the face
value of the minimum wage. By working 40 hours per week, a minimum-wage worker
could earn $80 in 1974 and $234 in 2007. The third row of Table 2.2 shows the cost of
a standard basket of consumer goods, which includes a standard mix of housing, food,
clothing, and transportation. In 1974, consumer prices were relatively low, and the
cost of buying all the goods in the standard basket was only $47. Between 1974 and
2007, consumer prices increased, and the cost of this standard basket of goods
increased to $202.
The last row in Table 2.2 shows the purchasing power of the minimum wage in
1974 and 2007. In 1974, the $80 in weekly income could buy 1.70 standard baskets of
goods. Between 1974 and 2007, the weekly income nearly tripled, but the cost of the
standard basket of goods more than quadrupled, from $47 to $202. As a result, the
weekly income of $234 in 2007 could buy only 1.16 baskets of goods. Because prices
increased faster than the nominal wage, the real value of the minimum wage actually
decreased over this period.
The minimum wage increased to $6.55 in July 2008 and $7.25 one year later.
These wage hikes are not large enough to restore the 1974 purchasing power of the
minimum wage. For that to happen, the minimum wage in July of 2008 would have to
be about $8.84.

CHAPTER 2
THE KEY PRINCIPLES OF ECONOMICS
42
Economists use special terms to express the ideas behind the real-nominal principle:
The nominal value of an amount of money is simply its face value. For exam-
ple, the nominal wage paid by the bookstore is $10 per hour.
The real value of an amount of money is measured in terms of the quantity of
goods the money can buy. For example, the real value of your bookstore wage
would fall as the prices of movies and snacks increase, even though your nomi-
nal wage stayed the same.
The real-nominal principle can explain how people choose the amount of money
to carry around with them. Suppose you typically withdraw $40 per week from an
ATM to cover your normal expenses. If the prices of all the goods you purchase dur-
ing the week double, you would have to withdraw $80 per week to make the same pur-
chases. The amount of money people carry around depends on the prices of the goods
and services they buy.
Government officials use the real-nominal principle when they design public pro-
grams. For example, Social Security payments are increased each year to ensure that
the checks received by the elderly and other recipients will purchase the same amount
nominal value
The face value of an amount of money.
real value
The value of an amount of money in
terms of what it can buy.
REPAYING STUDENT LOANS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #6: How does inflation affect lenders
and borrowers?
Suppose you finish college with $20,000 in student loans and start a job that pays a
salary of $40,000 in the first year. In 10 years, you must repay your college loans.
Which would you prefer: stable prices, rising prices, or falling prices?
We can use the real-nominal principle to compute the real cost of repaying your
loans. The first row of Table 2.3 shows the cost of the loan when all prices in the econ-
omy are stable
including the price of labor, your salary. In this case, your nominal
salary in 10 years is $40,000, and the real cost of repaying your loan is the half year of
work you must do to earn the $20,000 you owe. However, if all prices double over the
10-year period, your nominal salary will double to $80,000, and, as shown in the sec-
ond row of Table 2.3, it will take you only a quarter of a year to earn $20,000 to repay
the loan. In other words, a general increase in prices lowers the real cost of your loan.
In contrast, if all prices decrease and your annual salary drops to $20,000, it will take
you a full year to earn the money to repay the loan. In general, people who owe money
prefer inflation (a general rise in prices) to deflation (a general drop in prices).

This chapter covers five key
principles of economics, the
simple, self-evident truths that
most people readily accept. If
you understand these princi-
ples, you are ready to read the
rest of the book, which will
show you how to do your own
economic analysis.
1 Principle of opportunity cost. The opportunity cost of some-
thing is what you sacrifice to get it.
2 Marginal principle. Increase the level of an activity as long as
its marginal benefit exceeds its marginal cost. Choose the
level at which the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost.
3 Principle of voluntary exchange. A voluntary exchange
between two people makes both people better off.
4 Principle of diminishing returns. Suppose that output is pro-
duced with two or more inputs, and we increase one input
while holding the other inputs fixed. Beyond some point
called the point of diminishing returns
output will increase
at a decreasing rate.
5 Real-nominal principle. What matters to people is the real
value of money or income
its purchasing power
not the
face value of money or income.

of goods and services, even if prices have increased. The government also uses this
principle when it publishes statistics about the economy. For example, its reports
about changes in real wages  in the economy over time take into account the prices
of the goods workers purchase. Therefore, the real wage is stated in terms of its buy-
ing power, rather than its face value or nominal value.

Interest Rates and ATM Trips. Carlos, who lives in
a country where interest rates are very high, goes to
an ATM every day to get $10 of spending money. Art,
who lives in a country with relatively low interest
rates, goes to the ATM once a month to get $300 of
spending money. Why does Carlos use the ATM
more frequently?
1.10 Correct the Cost Statements. Consider the following
statements about cost. For each incorrect statement,
provide a correct statement about the relevant cost.

A taxi company currently has nine cabs in its fleet, and
its total daily cost is $4,000. If the company added a
tenth cab, its daily total cost would be $4,200, or

How Fast to Drive? Suppose Duke is driving to a
nearby town to attend a dance party, and must decide
how fast to drive. The marginal benefit of speed is

The marginal-benefit curve is negatively sloped,
and the marginal-cost curve is positively sloped.
a. Draw a pair of curves that suggest Duke will drive
40 mph.

2.10 How Many Pints of Blackberries? The pleasure you
get from each pint of freshly picked blackberries is
$2.00. It takes you 12 minutes to pick the first pint,
and each additional pint takes an additional 2 minutes
(14 minutes for the second pint, 16 minutes for the
third pint, and so on). The opportunity cost of your
time is $0.10 per minute.
a. How many pints of blackberries should you pick?
Illustrate with a complete graph.
b. How would your answer to (a) change if your
pleasure decreased by $0.20 for each additional pint
($1.80 for the second, $1.60 for the third, and so
on)? Illustrate with a complete graph.

When two people involved in an exchange say thank
you  afterwards, they are merely being polite.
(True/False)

book for $15. The value of the book to the buyer is at
least $
, and the cost of producing the
book is no more than $

3.4
Sally sells one apple per day to Andy, and says 
ca-ching  to show her satisfaction with the transaction.
The greater her satisfaction with the exchange, the
louder her ca-ching.  If the price of apples decreases,
her ca-ching  will become 
(louder/softer).

Should a Heart Surgeon Do Her Own Plumbing?
A heart surgeon is skillful at unplugging arteries and
rerouting the flow of blood, and these skills also
make her a very skillful plumber. She can clear a
clogged drain in six minutes, about 10 times faster
than the most skillful plumber in town. (Related to
Application 3 on page 38.)
a. Should the surgeon clear her own clogged
drains? Explain.
b. Suppose the surgeon earns $20 per minute in heart
surgery, and the best plumber in town charges
$50 per hour. How much does the surgeon gain by
hiring the plumber to clear a clogged drain?

Fishing versus Boat Building. Half the members of
a fishing tribe catch two fish per day and half catch
eight fish per day. A group of 10 members could build
a boat for another tribe in one day and receive a pay-
ment of 40 fish for the boat.
a. Suppose the boat builders are drawn at random
from the tribe. From the tribes perspective, what is
the expected cost of building the boat?
b. How could the tribe decrease the cost of building
the boat, thus making it worthwhile?

Solving a Tree Cutting Problem. Consider a hilly
neighborhood where large trees provide shade but
also block views. When a resident announces plans to
cut down several trees to improve her view, her neigh-
bors object and announce plans to block the tree cut-

is happy. Use the principle of voluntary exchange to
explain what happened.
The Principle of Diminishing Returns
4.1
Consider the example of Xena s copy shop. Adding a
second worker increased output by 300 pages. If she
added a third worker, her output would increase by
fewer than 
pages.
4.2
If a firm is subject to diminishing marginal returns, an
increase in the number of workers decreases the quan-
tity produced. 
(True/False)
4.3
Fill in the blanks with at least  or less than : If a firm
doubles one input but holds the other inputs fixed, we
normally expect output to 
double; if a
firm doubles all inputs, we expect output to
double.
4.4
Fill in the blanks with flexible  or inflexible :
Diminishing returns is applicable when a firm is
in choosing inputs, but does not apply
when a firm is 
in choosing its inputs.

b. If you double the number of workers and
ingredients and add a second vat, would you expect
your output (gallons per hour) to double? Explain.

Diminishing Returns and the Marginal Principle.
Mollys Espresso Shop has become busy, and the more
hours Ted works, the more espressos Molly can sell.

The Real-Nominal Principle
5.1
Your savings account pays 4 percent per year: Each

period. If prices increase by 3 percent per year, by
keeping $100 in the bank for a year you actually gain
$
.

You earn 5 percent interest on funds in your money-
market account. If consumer prices increase by 7 percent
per year, your earnings on $1,000 in the money-market
account is $

is willing to sacrifice 10 tunes today as long as he gets
at least 11 tunes in a year. When Len loans $50 to
Barb for a one-year period, he cuts back his music pur-
chases by 50 tunes.

Producing Fold-Its
Here is a simple economic experiment that takes about
15 minutes to run. The instructor places a stapler and a
stack of paper on a table. Students produce fold-its
by folding a page of paper in thirds and stapling both ends of
the folded page. One student is assigned to inspect each
fold-it to be sure that it is produced correctly. The experi-
ment starts with a single student, or worker, who has
one minute to produce as many fold-its as possible. After the
instructor records the number of fold-its produced, the
process is repeated with two students, three students, four
students, and so on. How does the number of fold-its
change as the number of workers increases?

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
Mattel s Barbie, the most profitable doll in history, is
sold in 140 countries around the world at a rate of two
dolls per second. Annual sales are $1.6 billion.1 Most peo-
ple think the doll symbolizes U.S. culture, but Barbie is
really an international product. Saudi Arabia provides the
oil used in Taiwanese factories to produce the vinyl plastic
pellets that become Barbie s body. Japan supplies Barbie s
nylon hair, and China provides her cotton clothes. The
machinery used in Barbie factories in China, Indonesia, and
Malaysia comes from Japan, Europe, and the United States.
The United States provides the designs, the molds used to
form the dolls, and the pigments and oils used to paint
them. Barbie dolls come in a box labeled Made in China,
but only about $0.33 of the $10 retail price goes to the fac-
tories in China that assemble the dolls. The rest goes to
input suppliers around the world and to Mattel, which col-
lects a $1 profit on each Barbie doll sold.

n Chapter 1, we saw that a society makes three types of economic decisions: what
products to produce, how to produce them, and who gets them. In modern
economies, most of these decisions are made in markets. Most of us participate in
the labor market and are paid for jobs in which we produce goods and services for oth-
ers. We participate in consumer markets, spending our incomes on food, clothing,
housing, and other products. In this chapter, we explain why markets exist and then
explore the virtues and the shortcomings of markets. We also examine the role of gov-
ernment in a market-based economy.
COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE AND
EXCHANGE
As we saw earlier in the book, a market is an institution or arrangement that
enables people to buy and sell things. An alternative to buying and selling in mar-
kets is to be self-sufficient, with each of us producing everything we need for our-
selves. Rather than going it alone, most of us specialize: We produce one or two
products for others and then exchange the money we earn for the products we want
to consume.
Specialization and the Gains from Trade
We can explain how people can benefit from specialization and trade with a simple
example of two people and two products. Suppose that the crew of the television
show Survivor finishes filming a season of episodes on a remote tropical island, and
when the crew returns to the mainland two people miss the boat and are left
behind. The two real survivors produce and consume two goods, coconuts and fish.
The first row of Table 3.1 shows their production possibilities. Each day Fred can
either gather 2 coconuts or catch 6 fish, while Kate can either gather 1 coconut or
catch 1 fish.
We ll show that the two survivors will be better off if each person specializes in
one product and then exchanges with the other person. We can use one of the key
principles of economics to explore the rationale for specialization.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  O P P O R T U N I T Y  C O S T
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
Freds opportunity cost of 1 coconut is 3 fish
thats how many fish he could catch in
the time required to gather 1 coconut. Similarly, his opportunity cost of a fish is
1/3 coconut, the number of coconuts he could gather in the time required to catch
1 fish. For Kate, the opportunity cost of 1 coconut is 1 fish, and the opportunity cost
of 1 fish is 1 coconut.
To demonstrate the benefits of exchange, lets imagine that both people are ini-
tially self-sufficient, with each producing enough of both goods to satisfy their own
desires. Suppose they devote six days per week to finding food. If Fred initially devotes
two days per week to gathering coconuts and four days per week to catching fish, he

will produce and consume 4 coconuts (2 per day times two days) and 24 fish (6 per day
times four days) per week. This is shown in the first column of Figure 3.1. If Kate
initially devotes one day per week to coconuts and five days per week to fish, she will
produce and consume 1 coconut and 5 fish per week.
Specialization will increase the total output of our little survivor economy. It is
sensible for each person to specialize in the good for which he or she has a lower
opportunity cost. We say that a person has a comparative advantage in producing a
particular product if he or she has a lower opportunity cost than another person:
Fred has a comparative advantage in producing fish because his opportunity
cost of fish is 1/3 coconut per fish, compared to 1 coconut per fish for Kate.
Kate has a comparative advantage in harvesting coconuts because her opportunity
cost of coconuts is 1 fish per coconut, compared to 3 fish per coconut for Fred.
comparative advantage
The ability of one person or nation to
produce a good at a lower opportunity
cost than another person or nation.

The second column of Figure 3.1 shows what happens to production when the
two people specialize: Fred produces 36 fish and Kate produces 6 coconuts. The total
output of both goods increases: The number of coconuts increases from 5 to 6, and
the number of fish increases from 29 to 36. Specialization increases the output of both
goods because both people are focusing on what they do best.
If specialization is followed by exchange, both people will be better off. Suppose
Fred and Kate agree to exchange 2 fish per coconut. Fred could give up 10 fish to get
5 coconuts. As shown in the third column of Figure 3.1, that leaves him with
5 coconuts and 26 fish. Compared to the self-sufficient outcome, he has more of both
goods
1 more coconut and 2 more fish. If Kate gives up 5 coconuts to get 10 fish,
that leaves her with 1 coconut and 10 fish, which is better than her self-sufficient out-
come of 1 coconut and 5 fish. Specialization and exchange make both people better
off, illustrating one of the key principles of economics:
P R I N C I P L E  O F  V O L U N TA R Y  E X C H A N G E
A voluntary exchange between two people makes both people better off.
Comparative Advantage versus Absolute Advantage
We ve seen that it is beneficial for each person to specialize in the product for which
he or she has a comparative advantage
a lower opportunity cost. You may have
noticed that Fred is more productive than Kate in producing both goods. Fred
requires a smaller quantity of resources (in this case less labor time) to produce both
goods, so he has an absolute advantage in producing both goods. Despite his
absolute advantage, Fred gains from specialization and trade because he has a compar-
ative advantage in fish. Fred is twice as productive as Kate in producing coconuts, but
six times as productive in producing fish. By relying on Kate to produce coconuts,
Fred frees up time to spend producing fish, the good for which he has the larger pro-
ductivity advantage over Kate. The lesson is that specialization and exchange result
from comparative advantage, not absolute advantage.
The Division of Labor and Exchange
So far we ve seen that specialization and trade exploit differences in productivity
across workers and make everyone better off. We ve assumed that the differences in
productivity are innate, not acquired. In his 1776 book An Inquiry into the Nature and
Causes of the Wealth of Nations, Adam Smith noted that specialization actually increased
productivity through the division of labor. He used the example of the pin factory to
illustrate how the division of labor increased output:2
A workman . . . could scarce, perhaps with his utmost industry, make one pin a day, and cer-
tainly could not make twenty. But the way in which this business is now carried on . . . one
man draws out the wire, another straightens it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth
grinds the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct
operations . . . . The . . . making of a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen dis-
tinct operations . . . . I have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men . . . make
among them . . . upward of forty eight thousand pins in a day.
Smith listed three reasons for productivity to increase with specialization, with
each worker performing a single production task:
1 Repetition.
The more times a worker performs a particular task, the more profi-
cient the worker becomes at that task.
CHAPTER 3

absolute advantage
The ability of one person or nation to
produce a product at a lower resource cost
than another person or nation.

53
PART 1
2 Continuity.
A specialized worker doesn t spend time switching from one task to
another. This is especially important if switching tasks requires a change in tools
or location.
3 Innovation.
A specialized worker gains insights into a particular task that lead to
better production methods. Smith believed that workers were innovators:3
A great part of the machines made use of in those manufacturies in which labour is most
subdivided, were originally the inventions of common workmen, who, being each of them
employed in some simple operation, naturally turned their thoughts toward finding out
easier and readier methods of performing it.
To summarize, specialization and exchange result from differences in produc-
tivity that lead to comparative advantage. Differences in productivity result from
differences in innate skills and the benefits associated with the division of labor.
Adam Smith wrote that every man thus lives by exchanging, or becomes in some
measure a merchant, and the society itself grows to be what is properly a commer-
cial society. 4
COMPARATIVE ADVANTAGE AND
INTERNATIONAL TRADE
The lessons of comparative advantage and specialization apply to trade between
nations. Each nation could be self-sufficient, producing all the goods it consumes,
or it could specialize in products for which it has a comparative advantage. Even if
one nation is more productive than a second nation in producing all goods, trade
will be beneficial if the first nation has a bigger productivity advantage in one
product
that is, if one nation has a comparative advantage in some product. An
import is a product produced in a foreign country and purchased by residents of
the home country. An export is a product produced in the home country and sold
in another country.
Many people are skeptical about the idea that international trade can make
everyone better off. President Abraham Lincoln expressed his discomfort with
importing goods:5
I know if I buy a coat in America, I have a coat and America has the money
If I buy a coat
in England, I have the coat and England has the money.
What President Lincoln didn t understand is that when he buys a coat in England, he
sends dollars to England, but the dollars don t just sit there. Eventually they are sent
back to the United States to buy goods produced by U.S. workers. In the words of
economist Todd Buchholz, the author of New Ideas from Dead Economists,6
Money may not make the world go round, but money certainly goes around the world. To
stop it prevents goods from traveling from where they are produced most inexpensively to
where they are desired most deeply.
Outsourcing
When a domestic firm shifts part of its production to a different country, we say the
firm is outsourcing or offshoring. The chapter opener on Mattel s Barbie relates a classic
example of outsourcing, with production occurring in Saudi Arabia, Taiwan, Japan,
China, Indonesia, Malaysia, Europe, and the United States. In the modern global

economy, transportation and communication costs are relatively low, so firms can
spread production across many countries. By taking advantage of the comparative
advantages of different countries, a firm can produce its product at a lower cost,
charge a lower price, and sell more output.
Firms shift functions such as customer service, telemarketing, document manage-
ment, and medical transcription overseas to reduce production costs, allowing them to
sell their products at lower prices. Some recent studies of outsourcing have reached a
number of conclusions:7
1 The loss of domestic jobs resulting from outsourcing is a normal part of a healthy
economy because technology and consumer preferences change over time. The
number of jobs lost to outsourcing is a small fraction of the normal job loss expe-
rienced by a healthy economy. For example, in the first three months of 2004, a
total of 239,361 workers were laid off, with 9,985 jobs moving to another location
within the United States, 4,633 outsourced to another country, and the rest sim-
ply lost to the economy. This means that roughly 2 percent of reported layoffs
were caused by outsourcing.
2 The jobs lost to outsourcing are at least partly offset by jobs gained through
insourcing, jobs that are shifted from overseas to the United States.
3 The cost savings from outsourcing are substantial, leading to lower prices for
consumers and more output for firms. The jobs gained from increased output at
least partly offset the jobs lost to outsourcing.

CANDY CANE MAKERS MOVE TO MEXICO FOR CHEAP SUGAR
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: Does the protection of one domestic
industry harm another?
About 90 percent of the world s candy canes are consumed in the United States, and
until recently most were produced domestically. Domestic producers were closer to
consumers, so they had lower transportation costs and lower prices than their for-
eign competitors. Domestic firms used their superior access to consumers to domi-
nate the market.
In recent years, the domestic production of candy canes has decreased. In 2003,
Spangler Candy Company of Bryan, Ohio, shifted half its production to a plant in
Juarez, Mexico. The company opened the Mexico plant because the cost of sugar, the
key ingredient in candy, is only $0.06 per pound in Mexico, compared to $0.21 in the
United States. The shift to Mexico saves the firm about $2.7 million per year on sugar
costs. The high price of sugar has caused other candy manufacturers to shift their
operations overseas. Since 1998, the Chicago area, the center of the U.S. confection
industry, has lost about 3,000 candy-production jobs.
Why is the price of sugar in the United States so high? The government protects
the domestic sugar industry from foreign competition by restricting sugar imports. As
a result, the supply of sugar in the United States is artificially low and the price is arti-
ficially high. In this case, the protection of jobs in one domestic industry reduces jobs
in another domestic industry.

PART 1
market economy
An economy in which people specialize and
exchange goods and services in markets.
MARKETS
Earlier in the chapter, we used a simple example of direct exchange to show the ben-
efits of specialization and exchange. In a modern economy, people don t directly
exchange goods like fish and coconuts, but instead rely on all sorts of markets to
exchange goods and services, trading what they have for what they want. In a
market economy, most people specialize in one productive activity by picking an
occupation, and use their incomes to buy most of the goods they consume. In addi-
tion to the labor and consumer markets, many of us participate in the market for
financial capital: We earn interest from savings accounts and money-market
accounts and pay interest on mortgages, car loans, and student loans. Friedrich
Hayek, a famous twentieth-century economist, suggested that if the market system
hadn t arisen naturally, it would have been proclaimed the greatest invention in
human history.8
Although it appears that markets arose naturally, a number of social and govern-
ment inventions have made them work better:
Contracts specify the terms of exchange, facilitating exchange between
strangers. If you have a cell phone provider, you expect to have reliable phone
service as long as you pay your bill. If you operate a bookstore, you expect book
wholesalers to deliver the books you ve purchased. In both cases, a contract
specifies the terms of exchange.
Insurance reduces the risk entrepreneurs face. If you operate a bagel shop,
fire insurance reduces your losses in the event of a fire.
Patents increase the profitability of inventions, encouraging firms to
develop new products and production processes. Pharmaceutical compa-
nies such as Bayer Pharmaceutical and Merck spend billions of dollars to cre-
ate, test, and bring new products to the market. A patent prevents other
companies from copying a new product, making it more likely that the rev-
enue from a new product will be large enough to cover research and develop-
ment costs.
Accounting rules provide potential investors with reliable information
about the financial performance of a firm. If you are thinking about investing
in Apple Inc., you can use publicly available information to examine the com-
panys financial history.
Virtues of Markets
To assess the virtues of the market system, imagine an alternative
a centrally
planned economy in which a planning authority decides what products to produce,
how to produce them, and who gets them. To make these decisions, a planner must
first collect a huge amount of widely dispersed information about consumption desires
(what products each individual wants), production techniques (what resources are
required to produce each product), and the availability of factors of production (labor,
human capital, physical capital, and natural resources). Then the planner must decide
how to allocate the productive resources among the alternative products. Finally, the
planner must divide the output among the economys citizens. Clearly, a central plan-
ner has a formidable task.
Under a market system, decisions are made by the millions of people who
already have information about consumers  desires, production technology, and
resources. These decisions are guided by prices of inputs and outputs. To illus-
trate, suppose you buy a wool coat. The dozens of people who contributed to the

bureaucracy decides how much of each
good to produce, how to produce the

production of the coat
including the farmers who manage the sheep, the workers
who transform raw wool into cloth and the cloth into a coat, the truckers who
transport the inputs and the actual coat, and the merchant who sold the coat
didn t know you wanted a coat:
The farmer knew that the price of wool was high enough to justify raising and
shearing sheep.
The workers knew that wages were high enough to make their efforts worthwhile.
The merchant knew that the retail price of the coat was high enough to make it
worthwhile to acquire the coat in anticipation of selling it.
In a market system, prices provide individuals the information they need to
make decisions.
Prices provide signals about the relative scarcity of a product and help an econ-
omy respond to scarcity. For example, suppose wool becomes scarcer, either because a
new use for wool is discovered or an old source of wool disappears. The greater
scarcity will increase the price of wool, and producers and consumers will respond in
ways that diminish scarcity:
The higher price encourages fabric producers to use the available wool more
efficiently and encourages farmers to produce more of it.
The higher price also encourages consumers to switch to coats made from alter-
native fabrics.
These two responses help the economy accommodate an increase in scarcity.
Consumers and producers don t need to know why wool is scarcer for these mecha-
nisms to kick in
they only need to know that the price is higher.
The decisions made in markets result from the interactions of millions of people,
each motivated by his or her own interest. Adam Smith used the metaphor of the
invisible hand  to explain that people acting in self-interest may actually promote the
interest of society as a whole:9
It is not from the benevolence of the butcher, the brewer, or the baker that we expect our
dinner, but from their regard to their own interest. We address ourselves, not to their
humanity but to their self-love, and never talk to them of our own necessities but of their
advantages . . . . [Man is] led by an invisible hand to promote an end which was no part of
this intention . . . . By pursuing his own interest he frequently promotes that of the society
more effectually than when he really intends to promote it . . . . Nobody but a beggar
chooses to depend chiefly upon the benevolence of his fellow citizens.
The market system works by getting each person, motivated by self-interest, to pro-
duce products for other people.
The Role of Entrepreneurs
Entrepreneurs play a key role in a market economy. Prices and profits provide signals
to entrepreneurs about what to produce. If a product suddenly becomes popular,
competition among consumers to obtain it will increase its price and increase the
profits earned by firms producing it. Entrepreneurs will enter the market and
increase production to meet the higher demand, switching resources from the
production of other products. As entrepreneurs enter the market, they compete for
customers, driving the price back down to the level that generates just enough profit
for them to remain in business. In contrast, if a product becomes less popular, the
process is reversed. Producers will cut prices in order to be sure of selling the prod-
uct to the smaller number of customers who want it. Entrepreneurs will leave the

57
PART 1
unprofitable market, finding other products to produce, and the price will eventually
rise back to the level where profits are high enough for the remaining producers to
justify staying in business.
Example of the Emergence of Markets: POW Camps
To illustrate the pervasiveness of exchange, consider the emergence of markets in pris-
oner of war (POW) camps during World War II.10 During World War II, the
International Red Cross gave each Allied prisoner a weekly parcel with the same mix
of products
tinned milk, jam, butter, biscuits, corned beef, chocolate, sugar, and cig-
arettes. In addition, many prisoners received private parcels from family and friends.
The prisoners used barter to exchange one good for another, and cigarettes emerged
as the medium of exchange. Prisoners wandered through the camp calling out their
offers of goods. For example, cheese for seven  meant that the prisoner was willing to
sell a cheese ration for 7 cigarettes. In addition to food, the prisoners bought and sold
clothing (80 cigarettes per shirt), laundry services (2 cigarettes per garment), and hot
cups of coffee (2 cigarettes per cup).
The prices of products reflected their scarcity. The tea-drinking British prison-
ers demanded little coffee. Because the British were confined to their compound,

GOLD FARMING FOR WORLD OF WARCRAFT
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: What is the role of opportunity cost in the
development of markets?
As an example of a market that results from comparative advantage, consider the
market for virtual currency. Firms in China pay workers (called gold farmers) to play
the online game World of Warcraft (WoW). In the game, workers earn virtual cur-
rency in the form of gold coins by killing monsters. In the real world, firms pay the
workers a piece rate of about $0.0125 per coin, which translates into a wage of about
$0.30 per hour. The firm sells the coins to an online retailer for about $0.03 per
coin, and the retailer then sells the coins to consumers for about $0.20 per coin.
The consumers in this market are WoW gamers in the United States, who are will-
ing to pay cash for game shortcuts
they use the purchased coins to buy the equip-
ment and magic spells required to battle virtual monsters and move to the next
level of the game.
Lets look at this exchange in terms of opportunity cost. Suppose a gamer in the
United States is roughly half as productive as a gold farmer in earning gold in the
game, getting 12 coins per hour. The gamer can either spend an hour to earn 12 coins
or take a shortcut by paying $0.20 per coin, or $2.40. If the gamer s opportunity cost
is greater than $2.40 per hour, buying the coins is sensible.
The use of gold farmers in WoW is controversial. Many gamers believe that buy-
ing gold coins rather than earning them by battling virtual monsters is unethical. In
2006, the company that runs WoW banned 50,000 WoW accounts belonging to gold
farmers, and the company eventually eliminated millions of gold farmers. The
decrease in the supply of virtual currency increased the price of WoW gold from
$0.06 cents per coin to $0.35.

packets of coffee beans sold for just a few cigarettes. Enterprising British prisoners
bribed prison guards to permit them to travel to the French compound, where
they could sell coffee for dozens of cigarettes. Religious groups such as the Sikhs
didn t eat beef, and the excess supply of beef in the Sikh compound led to low beef
prices. One prisoner who knew the Sikh language bought beef at a low price in the
Sikh compound and sold it at a higher price in other compounds. Eventually,
other people entered the Sikh beef trade, and beef prices across compounds
became roughly equal.
MARKET FAILURE AND THE ROLE OF
GOVERNMENT
Although markets often operate efficiently on their own, sometimes they do not.
Market failure happens when a market doesn t generate the most efficient outcome.
Later in the book, we ll explore several sources of market failure and discuss possible
responses by government. Here is a preview of the topics:
Pollution. For markets to work efficiently, the people making the decisions
about production and consumption must bear the full costs of their decisions.
In some cases, however, other people bear some of the costs. For example,
people living downwind from a paper mill breathe dirty air. The people who

THE SHAKERS AND THE MARKET FOR GARDEN SEEDS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Why do markets develop?
In 1802, a new market developed in the United States
garden seeds sold in small
packets. The new market was developed by the Shakers, a religious group whose
members took a vow of celibacy and lived in communes ranging in size from 10 to
about 100 believers. The Shakers were committed to common property and commu-
nal distribution of the output of their many agricultural enterprises.
The Shakers packaged seeds for peas, beets, onions, and lettuce, and distributed
the packets throughout the United States. The Shakers dominated the market, and
although they tried to coordinate the marketing of seeds from different Shaker vil-
lages by establishing sales territories, there was often spirited competition between the
Shaker villages. In 1836, the agents from one village complained that their brethren
had gone up every river and bayou  on the Mississippi and left no hole  for them.
They wrote, It makes us think that the first and great commandment was almost
given in vain.
Why were the Shakers able to dominate the garden-seed market? Although the
reasons for their domination remain a mystery, it appears that two factors gave them a
comparative advantage. First, they were committed to work as an expression of their
religious beliefs: In the words of their founder Mother Ann Lee, Put your hands to
work and your hearts to God.  Second, their agricultural operations were much larger
than traditional farms: In 1850, the average Shaker operation had five times as much
land and capital. The Shaker seed business was disrupted by the Civil War and was
discontinued in 1870.

decide how much paper to produce will ignore these other costs, so their
decisions about how much paper produce will be inefficient from the social
perspective. Similarly, people with asthma suffer from the emissions of cars
and SUVs. Drivers ignore these other costs, so their decisions about how
much to drive will be inefficient from the social perspective. The role of gov-
ernment is to ensure that polluters bear the full cost of their production and
consumption decisions.
Public goods. A public good is available for everyone to utilize, regardless of
who pays and who doesn t. Another requirement for market efficiency is that
decision makers must reap the full benefits from their decisions. In the case of a
public good such as a levee, the benefits go to everyone in the area protected
from flooding, not just the person who builds the levee. The role of government
is to facilitate the collective decision making for public goods such as levees,
national defense, parks, and space exploration.
Imperfect information. For markets to operate efficiently, people must have
enough information to make informed decisions about how much to produce or
consume. When they don t, the role of government is to disseminate informa-
tion and promote informed choices.
Imperfect competition. Some markets are dominated by a few large firms, and
the lack of competition leads to high prices and small quantities. For example,
DeBeers dominates the diamond market. The role of government is to foster
competition, which leads to lower prices and more choices.
What are the other roles of government in a market-based economy? The
government enforces property rights by protecting the property and possessions
of individuals and firms from theft. The government uses the legal system
police, courts, and prisons
to enforce those rights. The protection of private
property guarantees that people will keep the fruits of their labor, encouraging
production and exchange. The government has two additional roles to play in a
market economy:
Establishing rules for market exchange and using its police power to enforce
the rules.
Reducing economic uncertainty and providing for people who have lost a job,
have poor health, or experience other unforeseen difficulties and accidents.
Government Enforces the Rules of Exchange
The market system is based on exchanges between strangers. These exchanges are
covered by implicit and explicit contracts that establish the terms of trade. For exam-
ple, real-estate transactions and other business dealings are sealed with explicit con-
tracts that specify who pays what, and when. To facilitate exchange, the government
helps to enforce contracts by maintaining a legal system that punishes people who vio-
late them. This system allows people to trade with the confidence that the terms of the
contracts they enter will be met.
In the case of consumer goods, the implicit contract is that the product is safe to
use. The government enforces this implicit contract through product liability or tort
law. If a consumer is harmed by using a particular product, the consumer can file a
lawsuit against the manufacturer and seek compensation. For example, consumers
who are injured in defective automobiles may be awarded settlements to cover the cost
of medical care, lost work time, and pain and suffering.
The government also disseminates information about consumer products. The
government requires firms to provide information about the features of their prod-
ucts, including warnings about potentially harmful uses of the product. For example,
cigarettes have warning labels like Quitting Smoking Now Greatly Reduces Serious

60
This chapter explored specialization and
exchange and the virtues and shortcomings of
markets. We also discussed the role of govern-
ment in a market economy. Here are the main
points of the chapter:
1 It is sensible for a person to produce the prod-
uct for which he or she has a comparative
advantage, that is, a lower opportunity cost
than another person.
Risks to Your Health.  Some cold medications warn consumers to avoid driving while
taking the medication.
We ve already seen one of the virtues of a market system
competition among pro-
ducers tends to keep prices low. As we ll see later, the government uses antitrust policy
to foster competition by (a) breaking up monopolies (a single seller of a product), (b)
preventing firms from colluding to fix prices, and (c) preventing firms that produce
competing products from merging into a single firm. In some markets, the emergence
of a single firm
a monopolist
is inevitable because the entry of a second firm would
make both firms unprofitable. Some examples are cable television providers and elec-
tricity producers. Governments regulate these firms, controlling the price of the prod-
ucts they produce.
Government Can Reduce Economic Uncertainty
A market economy provides plenty of opportunities to people, but it has risks. Your
level of success in a market economy
how much income you earn and how much
wealth you accumulate
will depend on your innate intelligence as well as your
efforts. But there is also an element of luck: Your fate is affected by where you were
born, what occupation you choose, and your genetic makeup and health. Chance
events, such as natural disasters and human accidents, also can affect your prosper-
ity. Finally, some people lose their jobs when the national economy is in a slump and
firms lay off workers. Given the uncertainty of market economies, most govern-
ments fund a social safety net  that provides for citizens who fare poorly in mar-
kets. The safety net includes programs that redistribute income from rich to poor,
from the employed to the unemployed. The idea behind having a social safety net is
to guarantee a minimum income to people who suffer from job losses, poor health,
or bad luck.
Of course, there are private responses to economic uncertainty. For example, we
can buy our own insurance to cover losses from fire and theft, to cover our medical
expenses, and to provide death benefits to our survivors in the event of an accident or
disaster. Private insurance works because only a fraction of the people who buy insur-
ance eventually file claims and receive reimbursements from insurance companies. In
other words, the payments, or premiums, of many are used to pay the claims of a few.
Private insurance works when enough low-risk people purchase insurance to cover the
costs of reimbursing the high-risk people.
Some types of insurance are unavailable in the private insurance market. As a
result, the government steps in to fill the void. For example, unemployment insur-
ance (UI) is a government program that provides 26 weeks of compensation for peo-
ple who lose their jobs. The insurance is financed by mandatory contributions from
employers. Because all employers contribute to the system, the cost of the insurance
stays low.
2 Specialization increases productivity through the division
of labor, a result of the benefits of repetition, continuity,
and innovation.
3 A system of international specialization and trade is sensible
because nations have different opportunity costs of produc-
ing goods, giving rise to comparative advantages.

Comparative Advantage and Exchange
1.1
Consider an accounting firm with two accountants.
a. Fill in the blanks in the following table.
3.1
advantage in fishing? Which person has a
comparative advantage in gathering coconuts?
b. Suppose that each person is initially self-sufficient.
In a six-day week, Robin produces and consumes
32 coconuts and 4 fish, and Terry produces and
consumes 3 coconuts and 3 fish. Show that
specialization and exchange (at a rate of 3 coconuts
per fish) allows Robin to consume more coconuts and
the same number of fish and allows Terry to consume
more coconuts and the same number o fish. Illustrate
your answer with a graph like Figure 3.1 on page 51.
1.7
Technological Innovation and Exchange. Recall
the example of Fred and Kate shown in Table 3.1 on
page 50. Suppose a technological innovation, such as a
rope ladder, increases the coconut productivity of both
people: Fred can now produce three coconuts per day,
while Kate can now produce two coconuts per day.
Their productivity for fish has not changed. Suppose
they agree to trade one coconut for each fish. Will
both people gain from specialization and trade?
1.8

be a loss of fewer than 10 jobs in the firm.
b. Under what circumstances will there be a net gain
in jobs in the firm?

Four social inventions that support markets are 
(1) 
, which specify the terms of exchange;
(2)

Responding to Higher Prices. Consider the gold-
farm application. Suppose that the elimination of
some gold farmers increases the price of gold coins to
$0.50. In addition, suppose the typical gamer can
acquire 10 gold coins per hour.
a. A gamer will be indifferent between playing for
gold coins and buying them if his or her
opportunity cost of WoW time is 
.
b. As the price of gold coins increases, the number of
gamers buying the coins will 
(increase,
decrease). Explain. (Related to Application 2 on
page 57.)
3.7
Coffee and Cheese Exchange in a POW Camp.
Suppose that in the British compound of a POW
camp, the price of cheese is 6 cigarettes per cheese
ration and the price of coffee beans is 3 cigarettes per
coffee ration. In the French compound, the price of
coffee beans is 24 cigarettes per ration.
a. Is there an opportunity for beneficial exchange?
b. A British prisoner could exchange his cheese ration
for 
cigarettes, then exchange the extra
cigarettes for 
coffee rations in the
British compound. If he travels to the French
compound, he could exchange the extra coffee for
cigarettes. When he returns to the
British compound, he can exchange the extra
cigarettes for 
cheese rations. In other
words, his net gain from trade is 
cheese rations.
3.8
Extending Trade outside the Camp. Late in World
War II, a German guard exchanged bread and choco-
late at the rate of one loaf for one chocolate bar. Inside
the Allied POW camp, the price of chocolate was
15 cigarettes per bar, and the price of bread was
40 cigarettes per loaf.
a. Is there an opportunity for beneficial exchange?
b. With the guard, a POW could exchange three
chocolate bars for 
loaves of bread. In
the camp, the POW could exchange the extra
loaves for 
cigarettes, and then
exchange the extra cigarettes for 
chocolate bars. In other words, the POW s net gain
from trade is 
chocolate bars.
Market Failure and the Role of Government
4.1
For markets to operate efficiently, the people making
consumption and production decisions must bear the
full 
and reap the full 
from
their decisions.
4.2
Pollution from a paper mill is an example of market
failure because people living downwind of the mill
bear part of 
of production.
4.3
Some markets are dominated by a few large firms,
leading to high 
and small 
.
4.4
By promoting competition, the government generates
product prices.
4.5
Pirating Textbooks? The government protects
intellectual property rights by enforcing copyright
rules on textbooks. Suppose an organization scans
the pages of this and other introductory economics
textbooks and makes them available for downloading
at no charge.
a. As a current textbook consumer, would you be
better off or worse off?
b. What are the implications for the next generation
of economics students?
4.6
Unemployment Insurance. Each worker employed
by Risky Business has a 20 percent chance of losing
his or her job in the next year. Each worker
employed by Safe Business has a 2 percent chance of
losing his or her job. You manage an insurance com-
pany that provides a lump sum of $10,000 to each
unemployed worker.
a. What is the minimum amount you would charge
Risky Business for each employee covered by the
unemployment policy?
b. What is the minimum amount you would charge
Safe Business for each employee covered by the
unemployment policy?
c. Suppose you charge the same premium to both
businesses. The companies have the same number
of workers and are required to purchase
unemployment insurance. What is the minimum
amount you would charge?

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
Earthquake and the Price of Paper. A powerful earth-
quake in February 2010 damaged many of Chile s wood-
pulp mills and the infrastructure (roads, water systems, and
ports) required to produce and export wood pulp to the
United States, Europe, and China. Chile is responsible for
8 percent of the world supply of wood pulp, and the
decrease in the supply of pulp increased the world price by
$40 per ton, to $950. Pulp producers in Canada and the
United States responded to the higher price by increasing
their output, hiring more workers and earning more profit
in the process.
The decrease in the supply of wood pulp affected the
market for paper. Wood pulp is the main raw material for
paper, and the increase in the pulp price increased the cost
of producing paper and its price. In other words, part of
the cost of the earthquake was borne by paper consumers.

CHAPTER 4
DEMAND, SUPPLY, AND MARKET EQUILIBRIUM
66
O
ur discussion of the virtues of exchange and markets in Chapter 3 has set the
stage for this chapter, where we explore the mechanics of markets. We use
the model of demand and supply
the most important tool of economic
analysis
to see how markets work. We ll see how the prices of goods and services
are affected by all sorts of changes in the economy, including bad weather, higher
income, technological innovation, bad publicity, and changes in consumer prefer-
ences. This chapter will prepare you for the applications of demand and supply you ll
see in the rest of the book.
The model of demand and supply explains how a perfectly competitive market
operates. A perfectly competitive market has many buyers and sellers of a product,
so no single buyer or seller can affect the market price. The classic example of a per-
fectly competitive firm is a wheat farmer who produces a tiny fraction of the total sup-
ply of wheat. No matter how much wheat an individual farmer produces, the farmer
can t change the market price of wheat.
THE DEMAND CURVE
On the demand side of a market, consumers buy products from firms. We have one
main question about this side of the market: How much of a particular product are
consumers willing to buy during a particular period? Notice that we define demand for
a particular period, for example, a day, a month, or a year.
We ll start our discussion of demand with the individual consumer. A con-
sumer who is willing to buy a particular product is willing to sacrifice enough
money to purchase it. The consumer doesn t merely have a desire to buy the good,
but is also willing and able to sacrifice something to get it. How much of a prod-
uct is an individual willing to buy? It depends on a number of variables. Here is a
list of the variables that affect an individual consumer s decision, using the pizza
market as an example:
The price of the product (for example, the price of a pizza)
The consumer s income
The price of substitute goods (for example, the prices of tacos or sandwiches or
other goods that can be consumed instead of pizza)
The price of complementary goods (for example, the price of lemonade or other
goods consumed with pizza)
The consumer s preferences or tastes and advertising that may influence
preferences
The consumer s expectations about future prices
Together, these variables determine how much of a particular product an individual
consumer is willing and able to buy, the quantity demanded. We ll start our discus-
sion of demand with the relationship between price and quantity demanded, a rela-
tionship we represented graphically by the demand curve. Later in the chapter, we will
discuss the other variables that affect the individual consumer s decision about how
much of a product to buy. 
The Individual Demand Curve and the Law of Demand
The starting point f or a discussion of individual demand is a demand schedule,
which is a table of numbers showing the relationship between the price of a partic-
ular product and the quantity that an individual consumer is willing to buy. The
demand schedule shows how the quantity demanded by an individual changes with
the price, ceteris paribus (everything else held fixed). The variables that are held
fixed in the demand schedule are the consumer s income, the prices of substitutes

The Individual Demand Curve
According to the law of demand, the higher the price, the smaller the quantity demanded, every-
thing else being equal. Therefore, the demand curve is negatively sloped: When the price increases
from $6 to $8, the quantity demanded decreases from seven pizzas per month (point c) to four pizzas
per month (point b).

and complements, the consumer s tastes, and the consumer s expectations about
future prices. 
The table in Figure 4.1 shows Als demand schedule for pizza. At a price of $2, Al
buys 13 pizzas per month. As the price rises, he buys fewer pizzas: 10 pizzas at a price
of $4, 7 pizzas at a price of $6, and so on, down to only 1 pizza at a price of $10.
Remember that in a demand schedule, any change in quantity results from a change in
price alone.
The individual demand curve is a graphical representation of the demand
schedule. By plotting the numbers in Al s demand schedule
various combinations
of price and quantity
we can draw his demand curve for pizza. The demand curve
shows the relationship between the price and the quantity demanded by an individ-
ual consumer, ceteris paribus. To get the data for a single demand curve, we change
only the price of pizza and observe how a consumer responds to the price change. In
Figure 4.1, Al s demand curve shows the quantity of pizzas he is willing to buy at
each price.
Notice that Als demand curve is negatively sloped, reflecting the law of demand.
This law applies to all consumers: 
There is a negative relationship between price and quantity demanded, ceteris paribus.
The words ceteris paribus remind us that in order to isolate the relationship between
price and quantity demanded, we must assume that income, the prices of related goods

DEMAND, SUPPLY, AND MARKET EQUILIBRIUM

such as substitutes and complements, and tastes are unchanged. As the price of pizza
increases and nothing else changes, Al moves upward along his demand curve and
buys a smaller quantity of pizza. For example, if the price increases from $8 to $10, Al
moves upward along his demand curve from point b to point a, and buys only one
pizza per month, down from four pizzas at the lower price. A movement along a sin-
gle demand curve is called a change in quantity demanded, a change in the quantity
a consumer is willing to buy when the price changes. 
From Individual Demand to Market Demand
The market demand curve shows the relationship between the price of the good and
the quantity demanded by all consumers, ceteris paribus. As in the case of the individual
demand curve, when we draw the market demand curve we assume that the other vari-
ables that affect individual demand (income, the prices of substitute and complemen-
tary goods, tastes, and price expectations) are fixed. In addition, we assume the
number of consumers is fixed.
Figure 4.2 shows how to derive the market demand curve when there are only two
consumers. Panel A shows Al s demand curve for pizza, and Panel B shows Bea s
demand curve. At a price of $8, Al will buy 4 pizzas (point a) and Bea will buy 2 pizzas
(point b), so the total quantity demanded at this price is 6 pizzas. In Panel C, point c
shows the point on the market demand curve associated with a price of $8. At this
price, the market quantity demanded is 6 pizzas. If the price drops to $4, Al will buy

From Individual to Market Demand
The market demand equals the sum of the demands of all consumers. In this case, there are only two
consumers, so at each price the market quantity demanded equals the quantity demanded by Al plus the
quantity demanded by Bea. At a price of $8, Als quantity is four pizzas (point a) and Beas quantity is two
pizzas (point b), so the market quantity demanded is six pizzas (point c). Each consumer obeys the law of
demand, so the market demand curve is negatively sloped.

10 pizzas (point d ) and Bea will buy 6 pizzas (point e), for a total of 16 pizzas (shown
by point f on the market demand curve). The market demand curve is the horizontal
sum of the individual demand curves.
The market demand is negatively sloped, reflecting the law of demand. This is
sensible, because if each consumer obeys the law of demand, consumers as a group
will too. When the price increases from $4 to $8, there is a change in quantity
demanded as we move along the demand curve from point f to point c. The move-
ment along the demand curve occurs if the price of pizza is the only variable that
has changed.
THE SUPPLY CURVE
On the supply side of a market, firms sell their products to consumers. Suppose you
ask the manager of a firm, How much of your product are you willing to produce
and sell?  The answer is likely to be it depends.  The manager s decision about how
much to produce depends on many variables, including the following, using pizza as
an example:
The price of the product (for example, the price per pizza)
The wage paid to workers
The price of materials (for example, the price of dough and cheese)
The cost of capital (for example, the cost of a pizza oven)
The state of production technology (for example, the knowledge used in mak-
ing pizza)
Producers  expectations about future prices
Taxes paid to the government or subsidies (payments from the government to
firms to produce a product)
Together, these variables determine how much of a product firms are willing to pro-
duce and sell, the quantity supplied. We ll start our discussion of market supply with
the relationship between the price of a good and the quantity of that good supplied, a
relationship we represent graphically by the supply curve. Later in the chapter we will
discuss the other variables that affect the individual firms decision about how much of
a product to produce and sell.
The Individual Supply Curve and the Law of Supply
Consider the decision of an individual producer. The starting point for a discussion
of individual supply is a supply schedule, a table that shows the relationship between
the price of a particular product and the quantity that an individual producer is will-
ing to sell. The supply schedule shows how the quantity supplied by an individual
producer changes with the price, ceteris paribus. The variables we hold fixed in the
supply schedule are input costs, technology, price expectations, and government
taxes or subsidies.
The table in Figure 4.3 shows the supply schedule for pizza at Lola s Pizza
Shop. At a price of $2, Lola doesn t produce any pizzas, indicating that a $2 price is
not high enough to cover her cost of producing a pizza. In contrast, at a price of $4
she supplies 100 pizzas. In this example, each $2 increase in price increases the
quantity supplied by 100 pizzas to 200 at a price of $6, 300 at a price of $8, and so
on. Remember that in a supply schedule, a change in quantity results from a change
in price alone.

ual supply curve shows the relationship between the price of a product and the
quantity supplied by a single firm, ceteris paribus. To get the data for a supply
curve, we change only the price of pizza and observe how a producer responds to
the price change.
Figure 4.3 shows Lola s supply curve for pizza, which shows the quantity of pizzas
she is willing to sell at each price. The individual supply curve is positively sloped,
reflecting the law of supply, a pattern of behavior that we observe in producers:
There is a positive relationship between price and quantity supplied, ceteris paribus.
The words ceteris paribus remind us that to isolate the relationship between price
and quantity supplied we assume the other factors that influence producers are
unchanged. As the price of pizza increases and nothing else changes, Lola moves
upward along her individual supply curve and produces a larger quantity of pizza.
For example, if the price increases from $6 to $8, Lola moves upward along her
supply curve from point c to point d, and the quantity supplied increases from
200 to 300. A movement along a single supply curve is called a change in quantity
supplied, a change in the quantity a producer is willing and able to sell when the
price changes.

The supply curve of an individual supplier is positively sloped, reflecting the law of supply. As shown
by point a, the quantity supplied is zero at a price of $2, indicating that the minimum supply price is
just above $2. An increase in price increases the quantity supplied to 100 pizzas at a price of $4, 200
pizzas at a price of $6, and so on.

PART 1
minimum supply price
The lowest price at which a product will
be supplied.
The minimum supply price is the lowest price at which a product is supplied. A
firm won t produce a product unless the price is high enough to cover the marginal
cost of producing it. As shown in Figure 4.3, a price of $2 is not high enough to cover
the cost of producing the first pizza, so Lola s quantity supplied is zero (point a). But
when the price rises above $2, she produces some pizzas, indicating that her minimum
supply price is just above $2.
Why Is the Individual Supply Curve Positively Sloped?
The individual supply curve is positively sloped, consistent with the law of supply.
To explain the positive slope, consider how Lola responds to an increase in price.
A higher price encourages a firm to increase its output by purchasing more mate-
rials and hiring more workers. To increase her workforce, Lola might be forced to
pay overtime or hire workers who are more costly or less productive than the orig-
inal workers. But the higher price of pizza makes it worthwhile to incur these
higher costs.
The supply curve shows the marginal cost of production for different quantities
produced. We can use the marginal principle to explain this.
M A R G I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds its
marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal benefit equals the
marginal cost.
For Lola, the marginal benefit of producing a pizza is the price she gets for it. When
the price is only $2.00, she doesn t produce any pizza, which tells us that the mar-
ginal cost of the first pizza must be greater than $2.00; otherwise, she would have
produced it. But when the price rises to $2.01, she produces the first pizza because
now the marginal benefit (the $2.01 price) exceeds the marginal cost. This tells us
that the marginal cost of the first pizza is less than $2.01; otherwise, she wouldn t
produce it at a price of $2.01. To summarize, the marginal cost of the first pizza is
between $2.00 and $2.01, or just over $2.00. Similarly, point b on the supply curve in
Figure 4.3 shows that Lola won t produce her 100th pizza at a price of $3.99, but
will produce at a price of $4.00, indicating that her marginal cost of producing that
pizza is between $3.99 and $4.00, or just under $4.00. In general, the supply curve
shows the marginal cost of production.
From Individual Supply to Market Supply
The market supply curve for a particular good shows the relationship between the
price of the good and the quantity that all producers together are willing to sell, ceteris
paribus. To draw the market supply curve, we assume the other variables that affect
individual supply are fixed. The market quantity supplied is simply the sum of the
quantities supplied by all the firms in the market. To show how to draw the market
supply curve, we ll assume there are only two firms in the market. Of course, a per-
fectly competitive market has a large number of firms, but the lessons from the two-
firm case generalize to a case of many firms.
Figure 4.4 shows how to derive a market supply curve from individual supply
curves. In Panel A, Lola has relatively low production costs, as reflected in her
relatively low minimum supply price ($2 at point a). In Panel B, Hiram has higher
production costs, so he has a higher minimum price ($6 at point f ). As a result,
his supply curve lies above Lola s. To draw the market supply curve, we add the
market supply curve
A curve showing the relationship between
the market price and quantity supplied by
all firms, ceteris paribus.

CHAPTER 4
DEMAND, SUPPLY, AND MARKET EQUILIBRIUM
72
individual supply curves horizontally. This gives us two segments for the market
supply curve:
Prices between $2 and $6: Segment connecting points i and k. Hirams high-
cost firm doesn t supply any output, so the market supply is the same as the indi-
vidual supply from Lola. For example, at a price of $4 Lola supplies 100 pizzas
(point b) and Hiram does not produce any, so the market supply is 100 pizzas
(point j).
Prices above $6: Segment above point k. At higher prices, the high-cost firm
produces some output, and the market supply is the sum of the quantities sup-
plied by the two firms. For example, at a price of $8 Lola produces 300 pizzas
(point d ) and Hiram produces 100 pizzas (point g), so the market quantity sup-
plied is 400 pizzas (point m).
A perfectly competitive market has hundreds of firms rather than just two, but the
process of going from individual supply curves to the market supply curve is the same.
We add the individual supply curves horizontally by picking a price and adding up the
quantities supplied by all the firms in the market. In the more realistic case of many
firms, the supply curve will be smooth rather than kinked. This smooth line is shown
in Figure 4.5. In this case, we assume that there are 100 firms identical to Lolas firm.

From Individual to Market Supply
The market supply is the sum of the supplies of all firms. In Panel A, Lola is a low-cost producer
who produces the first pizza once the price rises above $2 (shown by point a). In Panel B, Hiram
is a high-cost producer who doesn t produce pizza until the price rises above $6 (shown by
point f ). To draw the market supply curve, we sum the individual supply curves horizontally. At a
price of $8, market supply is 400 pizzas (point m), equal to 300 from Lola (point d) plus 100 from
Hiram (point g).

The Market Supply Curve with Many Firms
The market supply is the sum of the supplies of all firms. The minimum supply price is $2 (point a),
and the quantity supplied increases by 10,000 for each $2 increase in price to 10,000 at a price of $4
(point b), 20,000 at a price of $6 (point c), and so on.
The minimum supply price is $2, and for each $2 increase in price, the quantity sup-
plied increases by 10,000 pizzas.
Why Is the Market Supply Curve Positively Sloped?
The market supply curve is positively sloped, consistent with the law of supply. To
explain the positive slope, consider the two responses by firms to an increase in price:
Individual firm. As we saw earlier, a higher price encourages a firm to increase
its output by purchasing more materials and hiring more workers.
New firms. In the long run, new firms can enter the market and existing
firms can expand their production facilities to produce more output. The
new firms may have higher production costs than the original firms, but the
higher output price makes it worthwhile to enter the market, even with
higher costs.
Like the individual supply curve, the market supply curve shows the marginal cost
of production for different quantities produced. In Figure 4.5, the marginal cost of
the first pizza is the minimum supply price for the firm with the lowest cost (just
over $2.00). Similarly, point d on the supply curve shows that the 30,000th pizza
won t be produced at a price of $7.99, but will be produced at a price of $8.00.
This indicates that the marginal cost of producing the 30,000th pizza is just under
$8.00. Like the individual supply curve, the market supply curve shows the mar-
ginal cost of production.
MARKET EQUILIBRIUM: BRINGING DEMAND
AND SUPPLY TOGETHER
In Chapter 3 we saw that a market is an arrangement that brings buyers and sellers
together. So far in this chapter we ve seen how the two sides of a market
demand and
supply
work. Now we bring the two sides of the market together to show how prices
and quantities are determined.

Market Equilibrium
At the market equilibrium (point a, with price = $8 and quantity = 30,000), the quantity supplied
equals the quantity demanded. At a price below the equilibrium price ($6), there is excess demand
the quantity demanded at point c exceeds the quantity supplied at point b. At a price above the
equilibrium price ($12), there is excess supply
the quantity supplied at point e exceeds the quantity
demanded at point d.
When the quantity of a product demanded equals the quantity supplied at the
prevailing market price, we have reached a market equilibrium. When a market
reaches an equilibrium, there is no pressure to change the price. If pizza firms pro-
duce exactly the quantity of pizza that consumers are willing to buy, each consumer
will get a pizza at the prevailing price, and each producer will sell all its pizza. In
Figure 4.6, the equilibrium price is shown by the intersection of the demand and
supply curves. At a price of $8, the supply curve shows that firms will produce
30,000 pizzas, which is exactly the quantity that consumers are willing to buy at
that price.
excess demand
A situation in which, at the prevailing
price, the quantity demanded exceeds the
quantity supplied.
market equilibrium
A situation in which the quantity
demanded equals the quantity supplied at
the prevailing market price.
Excess Demand Causes the Price to Rise
If the price is below the equilibrium price, there will be excess demand for the
product. Excess demand (sometimes called a shortage) occurs when, at the prevail-
ing market price, the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied, meaning
that consumers are willing to buy more than producers are willing to sell. In
Figure 4.6, at a price of $6, there is an excess demand equal to 16,000 pizzas:
Consumers are willing to buy 36,000 pizzas (point c), but producers are willing to
sell only 20,000 pizzas (point b) because the price is less than the marginal cost of
producing pizza number 20,001 and beyond. This mismatch between demand and
supply will cause the price of pizza to rise. Firms will increase the price they charge
for their limited supply of pizza, and anxious consumers will pay the higher price to
get one of the few pizzas available.
An increase in price eliminates excess demand by changing both the quantity
demanded and quantity supplied. As the price increases, the excess demand shrinks for
two reasons:
The market moves upward along the demand curve (from point c toward
point a), decreasing the quantity demanded.
The market moves upward along the supply curve (from point b toward
point a), increasing the quantity supplied.

75
PART 1
excess supply
A situation in which the quantity supplied
exceeds the quantity demanded at the
prevailing price.
Because the quantity demanded decreases while the quantity supplied increases, the
gap between the quantity demanded and the quantity supplied narrows. The price will
continue to rise until excess demand is eliminated. In Figure 4.6, at a price of $8 the
quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, as shown by point a.
In some cases, government creates an excess demand for a good by setting a max-
imum price (sometimes called a price ceiling). If the government sets a maximum price
that is less than the equilibrium price, the result is a permanent excess demand for the
good. Later in the book we will explore the market effects of such policies.
Excess Supply Causes the Price to Drop
What happens if the price is above the equilibrium price? Excess supply (sometimes
called a surplus) occurs when the quantity supplied exceeds the quantity demanded,
meaning that producers are willing to sell more than consumers are willing to buy.
This is shown by points d and e in Figure 4.6. At a price of $12, the excess supply is
32,000 pizzas: Producers are willing to sell 50,000 pizzas (point e), but consumers are
willing to buy only 18,000 (point d ). This mismatch will cause the price of pizzas to
fall as firms cut the price to sell them. As the price drops, the excess supply will shrink
for two reasons:
The market moves downward along the demand curve from point d toward
point a, increasing the quantity demanded.
The market moves downward along the supply curve from point e toward
point a, decreasing the quantity supplied.
Because the quantity demanded increases while the quantity supplied decreases, the
gap between the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded narrows. The price will
continue to drop until excess supply is eliminated. In Figure 4.6, at a price of $8, the
quantity supplied equals the quantity demanded, as shown by point a.
The government sometimes creates an excess supply of a good by setting a mini-
mum price (sometimes called a price floor). If the government sets a minimum price
that is greater than the equilibrium price, the result is a permanent excess supply.
We ll discuss the market effects of minimum prices later in the book.
MARKET EFFECTS OF CHANGES
IN DEMAND
We ve seen that market equilibrium occurs when the quantity supplied equals the
quantity demanded, shown graphically by the intersection of the supply curve and the
demand curve. In this part of the chapter, we ll see how changes on the demand side of
the market affect the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity.
Change in Quantity Demanded versus Change in Demand
Earlier in the chapter we listed the variables that determine how much of a particular
product consumers are willing to buy. The first variable is the price of the product.
The demand curve shows the negative relationship between price and quantity
demanded, ceteris paribus. In Panel A of Figure 4.7, when the price decreases from
$8 to $6, we move downward along the demand curve from point a to point b, and the
quantity demanded increases. As noted earlier in the chapter, this is called a change in
quantity demanded. Now we re ready to take a closer look at the other variables that
affect demand besides price
income, the prices of related goods, tastes, advertising,
and the number of consumers
and see how changes in these variables affect the
demand for the product and the market equilibrium.
If any of these other variables change, the relationship between the product s
price and quantity
shown numerically in the demand schedule and graphically in the
4.4

CHAPTER 4
DEMAND, SUPPLY, AND MARKET EQUILIBRIUM

demand curve
will change. That means we will have an entirely different demand
schedule and an entirely different demand curve. In Panel B of Figure 4.7, we show
this result as a shift of the entire demand curve from D1 to D2. This particular shift
means that at any price consumers are willing to buy a larger quantity of the product.
For example, at a price of $8 consumers are willing to buy 46,000 pizzas (point c), up
from 30,000 with the initial demand curve. To convey the idea that changes in these
other variables change the demand schedule and the demand curve, we say that a
change in any of these variables causes a change in demand. 
Increases in Demand Shift the Demand Curve
What types of changes will increase the demand and shift the demand curve to the
right, as shown in Figure 4.7? An increase in demand like the one represented in
Figure 4.7 can occur for several reasons, listed in Table 4.1:
Increase in income. Consumers use their income to buy products, and the
more money they have, the more money they spend. For a normal good, there
is a positive relationship between consumer income and the quantity consumed.
When income increases, a consumer buys a larger quantity of a normal good.
Most goods fall into this category
including new clothes, movies, and pizza.

(A) A change in price causes a change in quantity demanded, a movement along a single demand

tity demanded. 
(B) A change in demand caused by changes in a variable other than the price of the good shifts the
entire demand curve. For example, an increase in demand shifts the demand curve from D1 to D2.

substitutes
Two goods for which an increase in the
price of one good increases the demand
for the other good.
complements
Two goods for which a decrease in the
price of one good increases the demand
for the other good.
Decrease in income. An inferior good is the opposite of a normal good.
Consumers buy larger quantities of inferior goods when their income decreases.
For example, if you lose your job you might make your own coffee instead of
buying it in a coffee shop, rent DVDs instead of going to the theater, and eat
more macaroni and cheese. In this case, homemade coffee, DVDs, and maca-
roni and cheese are examples of inferior goods. 
Increase in price of a substitute good. When two goods are substitutes, an
increase in the price of the first good causes some consumers to switch to the
second good. Tacos and pizzas are substitutes, so an increase in the price of
tacos increases the demand for pizzas as some consumers substitute pizza for
tacos, which are now more expensive relative to pizza. 
Decrease in price of a complementary good. When two goods are
complements, they are consumed together as a package, and a decrease in the
price of one good decreases the cost of the entire package. As a result, con-
sumers buy more of both goods. Pizza and lemonade are complementary goods,
so a decrease in the price of lemonade decreases the total cost of a lemonade-
and-pizza meal, increasing the demand for pizza. 
Increase in population. An increase in the number of people means there are
more potential pizza consumers
more individual demand curves to add up to
get the market demand curve
so market demand increases.
Shift in consumer preferences. Consumers  preferences or tastes can change
over time. If consumers  preferences shift in favor of pizza, the demand for pizza
increases. One purpose of advertising is to change consumers  preferences, and
a successful pizza advertising campaign will increase demand.
Expectations of higher future prices. If consumers think next months pizza
price will be higher than they had initially expected, they may buy a larger
quantity today and a smaller quantity next month. That means the demand for
pizza today will increase.
We can use Figure 4.8 to show how an increase in demand affects the equilibrium
price and equilibrium quantity. An increase in the demand for pizza resulting from

An Increase in Demand Increases the Equilibrium Price
An increase in demand shifts the demand curve to the right: At each price, the quantity demanded
increases. At the initial price ($8), there is excess demand, with the quantity demanded (point b)
exceeding the quantity supplied (point a). The excess demand causes the price to rise, and equilib-
rium is restored at point c. To summarize, the increase in demand increases the equilibrium price to
$10 and increases the equilibrium quantity to 40,000 pizzas.

A decrease in demand shifts the demand curve to the left: At each price, the quantity demanded
decreases. At the initial price ($8), there is excess supply, with the quantity supplied (point a) exceed-
ing the quantity demanded (point b). The excess supply causes the price to drop, and equilibrium is
restored at point c. To summarize, the decrease in demand decreases the equilibrium price to $6 and
decreases the equilibrium quantity to 20,000 pizzas.
one or more of the factors listed in Table 4.1 shifts the demand curve to the right,
from D1 to D2. At the initial price of $8, there will be excess demand, as indicated by
points a and b: Consumers are willing to buy 46,000 pizzas (point b), but producers are
willing to sell only 30,000 (point a). Consumers want to buy 16,000 more pizzas than
producers are willing to supply, and the excess demand causes upward pressure on the
price. As the price rises, the excess demand shrinks because the quantity demanded
decreases while the quantity supplied increases. The supply curve intersects the new
demand curve at point c, so the new equilibrium price is $10 (up from $8), and the new
equilibrium quantity is 40,000 pizzas (up from 30,000).
Decreases in Demand Shift the Demand Curve
What types of changes in the pizza market will decrease the demand for pizza? A
decrease in demand means that at each price consumers are willing to buy a smaller
quantity. In Figure 4.9, a decrease in demand shifts the market demand curve from D1
to D0. At the initial price of $8, the quantity demanded decreases from 30,000 pizzas
(point a) to 14,000 pizzas (point b). A decrease in demand like the one represented in
Figure 4.9 can occur for several reasons, listed in Table 4.2:
Decrease in income. A decrease in income means that consumers have less to
spend, so they buy a smaller quantity of each normal good.
Increase in income. Consumers buy smaller quantities of an inferior good
when their income increases.
Decrease in the price of a substitute good. A decrease in the price of a sub-
stitute good such as tacos makes pizza more expensive relative to tacos, causing
consumers to demand less pizza.
Increase in the price of a complementary good. An increase in the price of a
complementary good such as lemonade increases the cost of a lemonade-and-
pizza meal, decreasing the demand for pizza.

79
PART 1
Decrease in population. A decrease in the number of people means that there
are fewer pizza consumers, so the market demand for pizza decreases.
Shift in consumer tastes. When consumers  preferences shift away from pizza
in favor of other products, the demand for pizza decreases.
Expectations of lower future prices. If consumers think next months pizza
price will be lower than they had initially expected, they may buy a smaller
quantity today, meaning the demand for pizza today will decrease.
A Decrease in Demand Decreases the Equilibrium Price
We can use Figure 4.9 to show how a decrease in demand affects the equilibrium
price and equilibrium quantity. The decrease in the demand for pizza shifts the
demand curve to the left, from D1 to D0. At the initial price of $8, there will be an
excess supply, as indicated by points a and b: Producers are willing to sell 30,000 piz-
zas (point a), but given the lower demand consumers are willing to buy only
14,000 pizzas (point b). Producers want to sell 16,000 more pizzas than consumers
are willing to buy, and the excess supply causes downward pressure on the price. As
the price falls, the excess supply shrinks because the quantity demanded increases
while the quantity supplied decreases. The supply curve intersects the new demand
curve at point c, so the new equilibrium price is $6 (down from $8), and the new equi-
librium quantity is 20,000 pizzas (down from 30,000).
MARKET EFFECTS OF CHANGES IN SUPPLY
We ve seen that changes in demand shift the demand curve and change the equilib-
rium price and quantity. In this part of the chapter, we ll see how changes on the sup-
ply side of the market affect the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity.
Change in Quantity Supplied versus Change in Supply
Earlier in the chapter we listed the variables that determine how much of a product
firms are willing to sell. Of course, one of these variables is the price of the prod-
uct. The supply curve shows the positive relationship between price and quantity,
ceteris paribus. In Panel A of Figure 4.10, when the price increases from $6 to $8 we
move along the supply curve from point a to point b, and the quantity of the prod-
uct supplied increases. As noted earlier in the chapter, this is called a change in
quantity supplied. Now we re ready to take a closer look at the other variables that

For example, an increase in price causes a move from point a to point b.
(B) A change in supply (caused by a change in something other than the price of the product) shifts

20,000 at point a). The price required to generate any given quantity decreases. For example, the
price required to generate 20,000 pizzas drops from $6 (point a) to $5 (point d).

schedule and a different supply curve. In Panel B of Figure 4.10, this is shown as a
shift of the entire supply curve from S1 to S2. In this case, the supply curve shifts
downward and to the right:
The shift to the right means that at any given price (for example, $6), a larger
quantity is produced (25,000 pizzas at point c, up from 20,000 at point a).
The shift downward means that the price required to generate a particular
quantity of output is lower. For example, the new minimum supply price is just
over $1 (point f ), down from just over $2 (point e). Similarly, the price required
to generate 20,000 pizzas is $5 (point d ), down from $6 (point a).
To convey the idea that changes in these other variables change the supply curve, we
say that a change in any of these variables causes a change in supply. 
Increases in Supply Shift the Supply Curve
What types of changes increase the supply of a product, shifting the supply curve
downward and to the right? Consider first the effect of a decrease in the wage paid to
pizza workers. A decrease in the wage will decrease the cost of producing pizza and
shift the supply curve:
Downward shift. When the cost of production decreases, the price
required to generate any given quantity of pizza will decrease. In general, a
lower wage means a lower marginal cost of production, so each firm needs a
lower price to cover its production cost. In other words, the supply curve
shifts downward.
Rightward shift. The decrease in production costs makes pizza production
more profitable at a given price, so producers will supply more at each price. In
other words, the supply curve shifts to the right.
A decrease in the wage is just one example of a decrease in production costs that shifts
the supply curve downward and to the right. These supply shifters are listed in
Table 4.3. A reduction in the costs of materials (dough, cheese) or capital (pizza oven)
decreases production costs, decreasing the price required to generate any particular
quantity (downward shift) and increasing the quantity supplied at any particular price
(rightward shift). An improvement in technology that allows the firm to economize
on labor or material inputs cuts production costs and shifts the supply curve in a sim-
ilar fashion. The technological improvement could be a new machine or a new way of
doing business
a new layout for a factory or store, or a more efficient system of
ordering inputs and distributing output. Finally, if a government subsidizes produc-
tion by paying the firm some amount for each unit produced, the net cost to the firm
is lowered by the amount of the subsidy, and the supply curve shifts downward and to
the right.
Two other possible sources of increases in supply are listed in Table 4.3. First, if
firms believe that next month s price will be lower than they had initially expected,
they may try to sell more output now at this month s relatively high price, increasing
supply this month. Second, because the market supply is the sum of the quantities
supplied by all producers, an increase in the number of producers will increase mar-
ket supply.
As summarized in Table 4.3, the language of shifting supply is a bit tricky. An
increase in supply is represented graphically by a shift to the right (a larger quantity
supplied at each price) and down (a lower price required to generate a particular
quantity). The best way to remember this is to recognize that the increase in increase
in supply  refers to the increase in quantity supplied at a particular price
the hori-
zontal shift of the supply curve to the right.

A shift of the supply curve caused by a

An Increase in Supply Decreases the Equilibrium Price
An increase in supply shifts the supply curve to the right: At each price, the quantity supplied
increases. At the initial price ($8), there is excess supply, with the quantity supplied (point b) exceed-
ing the quantity demanded (point a). The excess supply causes the price to drop, and equilibrium is
restored at point c. To summarize, the increase in supply decreases the equilibrium price to $6 and
increases the equilibrium quantity to 36,000 pizzas.

An Increase in Supply Decreases the Equilibrium Price
We can use Figure 4.11 to show the effects of an increase in supply on the equilibrium
price and equilibrium quantity. An increase in the supply of pizza shifts the supply
curve to the right, from S1 to S2. At the initial price of $8, the quantity supplied
increases from 30,000 pizzas (point a) to 46,000 (point b).
The shift of the supply curve causes excess supply that eventually decreases the
equilibrium price. At the initial price of $8 (the equilibrium price with the initial sup-
ply curve), there will be an excess supply, as indicated by points a and b: Producers are

willing to sell 46,000 pizzas (point b), but consumers are willing to buy only 30,000
(point a). Producers want to sell 16,000 more pizzas than consumers are willing to
buy, and the excess supply causes pressure to decrease the price. As the price
decreases, the excess supply shrinks, because the quantity supplied decreases while
the quantity demanded increases. The new supply curve intersects the demand curve
at point c, so the new equilibrium price is $6 (down from $8) and the new equilibrium
quantity is 36,000 pizzas (up from 30,000).
Decreases in Supply Shift the Supply Curve
Consider next the changes that cause a decrease in supply. As shown in Table 4.4,
anything that increases a firm s production costs will decrease supply. An increase
in production cost increases the price required to generate a particular quantity
(an upward shift of the supply curve) and decreases the quantity supplied at each
price (a leftward shift). Production costs will increase as a result of an increase in
the wage, an increase in the price of materials or capital, or a tax on each unit pro-
duced. As we saw earlier, the language linking changes in supply and the shifts of
the supply curve is tricky. In the case of a decrease in supply, the decrease refers to
the change in quantity at a particular price
the horizontal shift of the supply
curve to the left.
A decrease in supply could occur for two other reasons. First, if firms believe next
months pizza price will be higher than they had initially expected, they may be willing
to sell a smaller quantity today and a larger quantity next month. That means that the
supply of pizza today will decrease. Second, because the market supply is the sum of
the quantities supplied by all producers, a decrease in the number of producers will
decrease market supply, shifting the supply curve to the left.
A Decrease in Supply Increases the Equilibrium Price
We can use Figure 4.12 to show the effects of a decrease in supply on the equilib-
rium price and equilibrium quantity. A decrease in the supply of pizza shifts the
supply curve to the left, from S1to S0. At the initial price of $8 (the equilibrium
price with the initial supply curve), there will be an excess demand, as indicated by

CHAPTER 4
DEMAND, SUPPLY, AND MARKET EQUILIBRIUM
84
points a and b: Consumers are willing to buy 30,000 pizzas (point a), but produc-
ers are willing to sell only 14,000 pizzas (point b). Consumers want to buy 16,000 more
pizzas than producers are willing to sell, and the excess demand causes upward
pressure on the price. As the price increases, the excess demand shrinks because
the quantity demanded decreases while the quantity supplied increases. The new
supply curve intersects the demand curve at point c, so the new equilibrium price
is $10 (up from $8), and the new equilibrium quantity is 24,000 pizzas (down
from 30,000).
Simultaneous Changes in Demand and Supply
What happens to the equilibrium price and quantity when both demand and sup-
ply increase? It depends on which change is larger. In Panel A of Figure 4.13, the
increase in demand is larger than the increase in supply, meaning the demand
curve shifts by a larger amount than the supply curve. The market equilibrium
moves from point a to point b, and the equilibrium price increases from $8 to $9.
This is sensible because an increase in demand tends to pull the price up, while an
increase in supply tends to push the price down. If demand increases by a larger
amount, the upward pull will be stronger than the downward push, and the price
will rise.
We can be certain that when demand and supply both increase, the equilibrium
quantity will increase. That s because both changes tend to increase the equilibrium
quantity. In Panel A of Figure 4.13, the equilibrium quantity increases from 30,000 to
44,000 pizzas.
Panel B of Figure 4.13 shows what happens when the increase in supply is larger
than the increase in demand. The equilibrium moves from point a to point c, mean-
ing that the price falls from $8 to $7. This is sensible because the downward pull on
the price resulting from the increase in supply is stronger than the upward pull from

rium is restored at point c. To summarize, the decrease in supply increases the equilibrium price to
$10 and decreases the equilibrium quantity to 24,000 pizzas.

the increase in demand. As expected, the equilibrium quantity rises from 30,000 to
45,000 pizzas.
What about simultaneous decreases in demand and supply? In this case, the
equilibrium quantity will certainly fall because both changes tend to decrease the
equilibrium quantity. The effect on the equilibrium price depends on which change
is larger, the decrease in demand, which pushes the price downward, or the

decrease in supply, which pulls the price upward. If the decrease in demand is
larger, the price will fall because the force pushing the price down will be stronger
than the force pulling it up. In contrast, if the decrease in supply is larger, the price
will rise because the force pulling the price up will be stronger than the force push-
ing it down.
PREDICTING AND EXPLAINING MARKET
CHANGES
We ve used the model of demand and supply to show how equilibrium prices are
determined and how changes in demand and supply affect equilibrium prices and
quantities. Table 4.5 summarizes what we ve learned about how changes in demand
and supply affect equilibrium prices and quantities:
When demand changes and the demand curve shifts, price and quantity change
in the same direction: When demand increases, both price and quantity
increase; when demand decreases, both price and quantity decrease.
When supply changes and the supply curve shifts, price and quantity change
in opposite directions: When supply increases, the price decreases but the
quantity increases; when supply decreases, the price increases but the quan-
tity decreases.

We can use these lessons about demand and supply to predict the effects of various
events on the equilibrium price and equilibrium quantity of a product.
We can also use the lessons listed in Table 4.5 to explain the reasons for changes
in prices or quantities. Suppose we observe changes in the equilibrium price and
quantity of a particular good, but we don t know what caused these changes. Perhaps
it was a change in demand, or maybe it was a change in supply. We can use the infor-
mation in Table 4.5 to work backward, using what we ve observed about changes in
prices and quantities to determine which side of the market
demand or supply
caused the changes:
If the equilibrium price and quantity move in the same direction, the changes
were caused by a change in demand.
If the equilibrium price and quantity move in opposite directions, the changes
were caused by a change in supply.
APPLICATIONS OF DEMAND AND SUPPLY
We can apply what we ve learned about demand and supply to real markets. We can
use the model of demand and supply to predict the effects of various events on equilib-
rium prices and quantities. We can also explain some observed changes in equilibrium
prices and quantities.

HONEYBEES AND THE PRICE OF ICE CREAM
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: How do changes in supply in one market
affect other markets?
In the last few years thousands of honeybee colonies have vanished, a result of bee
colony collapse disorder (CCD). Roughly one-third of the U.S. food supply
including a wide variety of fruits, vegetables, and nuts
depends on pollination
from bees. The decline of honeybees threatens $15 billion worth of crops in the
United States. The decrease in pollination by bees has decreased the supply of

HURRICANE KATRINA AND BATON ROUGE HOUSING PRICES
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How do changes in demand affect prices?
In the late summer of 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused a storm surge and levee breaks
that flooded much of New Orleans and destroyed a large fraction of the citys housing.
Hundreds of thousands of residents were displaced, and about 250,000 relocated to
nearby Baton Rouge. The increase in population was so large that Baton Rouge
became the largest city in the state, and many people started calling the city New
Baton Rouge.
Figure 4.14 shows the effects of Hurricane Katrina on the housing market in
Baton Rouge. Before Katrina, the average price of a single-family home was $130,000,
as shown by point a. The increase in the citys population shifted the demand curve to
the right, causing excess demand for housing at the original price. Just before the hur-
ricane, there were 3,600 homes listed for sale in the city, but a week after the storm,
there were only 500. The excess demand caused fierce competition among buyers for
the limited supply of homes, increasing the price. Six months later, the average price
had risen to $156,000 as shown by point b.

strawberries, raspberries, and almonds, leading to higher prices for these ingredi-
ents for ice cream. The higher prices for berries and nuts have increased the cost of
producing food products, such as ice cream, increasing their prices as well.
Figure 4.15 shows the effects of the decline of the bee population on the market
for ice cream. Increases in the prices of ingredients (berries and nuts) increase the cost
of producing ice cream, shifting the supply curve upward. As a result, the equilibrium
price of ice cream increases.
The collapsing of bee colonies is a mystery. The ice cream maker Häagen-Dazs
donated money to Pennsylvania State University and the University of California,
Davis to support research exploring the causes of CCD and possible solutions. To
increase consumer awareness of the problem, Häagen Dazs launched a new flavor,

THE SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR CRUISE SHIP BERTHS
APPLYING THE CONCEPT #3: How do simultaneous changes in supply and
demand affect the equilibrium price?
What happens when an increase in supply is combined with a decrease in demand? In
2009 the cruise industry invested $4.7 billion on 14 new ships, and in 2010 the indus-
try launched 12 additional new ships. While the supply of cruise berths increased, the
demand for cruises decreased, a result of a recession and lower real income. As shown
in Figure 4.16, the simultaneous increase in supply and decrease in demand decreased
the equilibrium price. To entice consumers, some cruise lines cut prices by as much as
40 percent. Although consumers responded by purchasing more cruises (about 3 percent
more in 2009 than in 2008), the cruise lines  revenues decreased. For Carnival
Corporation, the world s largest cruise line, total revenue decreased by 10 percent.

THE BOUNCING PRICE OF VANILLA BEANS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: How do changes in supply affect prices?
The price of vanilla beans has been bouncing around a lot. The price was $50 per kilo-
gram (2.2 pounds) in 2000, then rose to $500 in 2003, then dropped to $25 in 2006.
We can use the model of demand and supply to explain the bouncing price.
Figure 4.17 shows the changes in the vanilla market in recent years. Point a shows the
initial equilibrium in 2000, with a price of $50 per kilogram. The 2000 cyclone that hit
Madagascar, the worlds leading vanilla producer, destroyed that years crop and a large
share of the vines that produce vanilla beans. Although the vines were replanted, new
plants don t bear usable beans for three to five years, so the supply effects of the cyclone
lasted several years. In Figure 4.17, the cyclone shifted the supply curve upward and to the
left, generating a new equilibrium at point b, with a higher price and a smaller quantity.
In Figure 4.17, the changes between 2003 and 2006 are shown by a shift of the supply
curve downward and to the right. In 2006, the vines replanted in Madagascar in 2001
started to produce vanilla beans. In addition, other countries, including India, Papua New
Guinea, Uganda, and Costa Rica, entered the vanilla market. The vines planted in these
other countries started to produce beans in 2006, so the world supply curve for 2006 lies
below and to the right of the original supply curve (in 2000). Given the larger supply of
vanilla beans in 2006, the price dropped to about half of its 2000 level, to $25 per kilogram.
The increase in supply from other countries was facilitated by the development of a sun-
tolerant variety of the vanilla plant that allows it to be grown as a plantation crop. The new
variety is an example of technological progress.  Related to Exercises 7.4 and 7.9.

DROUGHT IN AUSTRALIA AND THE PRICE OF RICE
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #5: How do producers respond to higher prices?
In 2008, the continuation of a six-year drought in Australia reduced the amount of
water available to irrigate Australia s rice crop. Farmers responded by reducing the
amount of land devoted to rice. The drought was a major factor in a near doubling of
rice prices, which led to violent protests in Cameroon, Egypt, Ethiopia, Haiti,
Indonesia, Italy, the Ivory Coast, Mauritania, and the Philippines.
The increase in the price of rice generated a number of responses that could even-
tually increase the quantity of rice produced. Farmers in Australia are experimenting
with different varieties and growing techniques that require less water. The more
costly techniques do not make economic sense when the price of rice is low, but are
sensible when the price is high. In Thailand, farmers are investing in generators to
irrigate their fields, allowing a second harvest each year. If the price of rice stays high,
the farmers will reap a large profit, but if the price falls, the costs of adding a second
crop will exceed the benefits, and farmers will lose money.

and 7.10.

In this chapter, we ve seen
how demand and supply
determine prices. We also
learned how to predict the
effects of changes in demand
or supply on prices and quan-
tities. Here are the main points
of the chapter:
1 A market demand curve shows the relationship between the
quantity demanded and price, ceteris paribus.
2 A market supply curve shows the relationship between the
quantity supplied and price, ceteris paribus. 
3 Equilibrium in a market is shown by the intersection of the
demand curve and the supply curve. When a market reaches
equilibrium, there is no pressure to change the price.
4 A change in demand changes price and quantity in the same
direction: An increase in demand increases the equilibrium
price and quantity; a decrease in demand decreases the
equilibrium price and quantity.
5 A change in supply changes price and quantity in opposite
directions: An increase in supply decreases price and
increases quantity; a decrease in supply increases price and
decreases quantity.

Responses to Higher Soybean Prices. Suppose that
in initial equilibrium in the soybean market, each of
the 1,000 farmers produces 50 units, for a total of
50,000 units of soybeans. Suppose the price of soy-
beans increases, and everyone expects the price to stay
at the higher level for many years.

ECO NO M I C EX PERI M EN T
Market Equilibrium
This simple experiment takes about 20 minutes. We start
by dividing the class into two equal groups: consumers
and producers.
The instructor provides each consumer with a number
indicating the maximum amount he or she is willing to
pay (WTP) for a bushel of apples: The WTP is a number
between $1 and $100. Each consumer has the opportu-
nity to buy one bushel of apples per trading period. The
consumer s score for a single trading period equals the
gap between the WTP and the price actually paid for
apples. For example, if the consumers WTP is $80 and
he or she pays only $30 for apples, the consumer s score is
$50. Each consumer has the option of not buying apples.
This will be sensible if the best price the consumer can
get exceeds the WTP. If the consumer does not buy
apples, his or her score will be zero.
The instructor provides each producer with a number
indicating the cost of producing a bushel of apples (a
number between $1 and $100). Each producer has the
opportunity to sell one bushel per trading period. The
producer s score for a single trading period equals the gap
between the selling prices and the cost of producing

apples. So if a producer sells apples for $20, and the cost
is only $15, the producer s score is $5. Producers have the
option of not selling apples, which is sensible if the best
price the producer can get is less than the cost. If the pro-
ducer does not sell apples, his or her score is zero.
Once everyone understands the rules, consumers and
producers meet in a trading area to arrange transactions. A
consumer may announce how much he or she is willing to
pay for apples and wait for a producer to agree to sell apples
at that price. Alternatively, a producer may announce how
much he or she is willing accept for apples and wait for a
consumer to agree to buy apples at that price. Once a trans-
action has been arranged, the consumer and producer
inform the instructor of the trade, record the transaction,
and leave the trading area.
Several trading periods are conducted, each of which
lasts a few minutes. After the end of each trading period, the
instructor lists the prices at which apples sold during the
period. Then another trading period starts, providing con-
sumers and producers another opportunity to buy or sell
apples. After all the trading periods have been completed,
each participant computes his or her score by adding the
scores from the trading periods.

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
During the deep economic downturn in 2009 and 2010,
economists, business writers, and politicians anxiously
awaited the news from the government about the latest
economic developments. They pored over the data to
determine if the economy was beginning to recover from
its doldrums and when more robust economic activity
would resume.
At the same time, a distinguished group of econo-
mists, led by Nobel Laureates Joseph Stiglitz and
Amartya Sen and French economist Jean-Paul Fitoussi,
issued a report calling for major revision in the way we
measure economic performance. They suggested that
our government statisticians focus more on how much we
consume and how much leisure we enjoy, and not solely
on what we produce. They also suggested that we should
be more concerned about whether our current activities
are sustainable over the long run, perhaps recognizing
environmental constraints.
But perhaps their most radical suggestion was that we
switch our focus away from economic production to mea-
suring people s economic well-being. This could include
examining the diets and living conditions of the poorest
people. For residents of developed countries, this might
involve analyzing surveys of people s reported happiness
with their own lives.
These changes, however, may be far in the future. Economists and businesses will still rely for some
time on the traditional measures of economic activity that we study in this chapter.

CHAPTER 5
MEASURING A NATION S PRODUCTION AND INCOME

T
his chapter begins your study of macroeconomics: the branch of economics
that deals with a nations economy as a whole. Macroeconomics focuses on the
economic issues
unemployment, inflation, growth, trade, and the gross
domestic product
that are most often discussed in newspapers, on the radio and tele-
vision, and on the Internet.
Macroeconomic issues lie at the heart of political debates. In fact, all presidential
candidates learn a quick lesson in macroeconomics. Namely, their prospects for
reelection will depend on how well the economy performs during their term in office.
If voters believe the economy has performed well, the president will be reelected.
Democrat Jimmy Carter as well as Republican George H. W. Bush failed in their bids
for reelection in 1980 and 1992, respectively, partly because of voters  macroeconomic
concerns. Both Republican Ronald Reagan in 1984 and Democrat Bill Clinton in
1996 won reelection easily because voters believed the economy was performing well
in their first terms. Public opinion polling shows that presidential popularity rises and
falls with the performance of the economy.
Macroeconomic events profoundly affect our everyday lives. For example, if the
economy fails to create enough jobs, workers will become unemployed throughout
the country, and millions of lives will be disrupted. Similarly, slow economic growth
means that living standards will not increase rapidly. If prices for goods begin rising
rapidly, some people will find it difficult to maintain their lifestyles.
This chapter and the next will introduce you to the concepts you need to under-
stand what macroeconomics is all about. In this chapter, we ll focus on a nations pro-
duction and income. We ll learn how economists measure the income and production
for an entire country and how they use these measures. In the next chapter, we ll look
carefully at unemployment and inflation. Both chapters will explain the terms the
media often uses when reporting economic information.
Macroeconomics focuses on two basic issues: long-run economic growth and eco-
nomic fluctuations. We need to understand what happens during the long run to
understand the factors behind the rise in living standards in modern economies.
Today, living standards are much higher in the United States than they were for our
grandparents. Living standards are also much higher than those of millions of people
throughout the globe. Although living standards have improved over time, the econ-
omy has not always grown smoothly. Economic performance has fluctuated over time.
During periods of slow economic growth, not enough jobs are created, and large
numbers of workers become unemployed. Both the public and policymakers become
concerned about the lack of jobs and the increase in unemployment.
At other times, unemployment may not be a problem, but we become con-
cerned that the prices of everything that we buy seem to increase rapidly.
Sustained increases in prices are called inflation. We ll explore inflation in the
next chapter.
THE FLIP  SIDES OF MACROECONOMIC
ACTIVITY: PRODUCTION AND INCOME
Before we can study growth and fluctuations, we need to have a basic vocabulary and
understanding of some key concepts. We begin with the terms production and income
because these are the flip  sides of the macroeconomic coin,  so to speak. Every day,
men and women go off to work, where they produce or sell merchandise or provide
services. At the end of the week or month, they return home with their paychecks or
income.  They spend some of that money on other products and services, which are
produced by other people. In other words, production leads to income, and income
leads to production.
But this chapter really isn t about production and income of individuals in
markets. That s what a microeconomist studies. On the contrary, this chapter is
about the production and income of the economy as a whole. From a big picture

PART 2
perspective, we will look at certain measures that will tell us how much the econ-
omy is producing and how well it is growing. We will also be able to measure the
total income generated in the economy and how this income flows back to work-
ers and investors. These two measures
a country s production and income
are
critical to a nation s economic health. Macroeconomists collect and analyze pro-
duction and income data to understand how many people will find jobs and
whether their living standards are rising or falling. Government officials use the
data and analysis to develop economic policies.
The Circular Flow of Production and Income
Let s begin with a simple diagram known as the circular flow, shown in Figure 5.1.
We ll start with a very simple economy that does not have a government or a for-
eign sector. Households and firms make transactions in two markets known as
factor markets and product markets. In factor, or input, markets, households supply
labor to firms. Households are also the ultimate owners of firms, as well as of all the
resources firms use in their production, which we call capital. Consequently, we can
think of households as providing capital to firms
land, buildings, and equipment
to produce output. Product, or output, markets are markets in which firms sell
goods and services to consumers.
The point of the circular flow diagram is simple and fundamental: Production
generates income. In factor markets, when households supply labor and capital to
firms they are compensated by the firms. They earn wages for their work, and they
earn interest, dividends, and rents on the capital they supply to the firms. The house-
holds then use their income to purchase goods and services in the product markets.
The firm uses the revenues it receives from the sale of its products to pay for the fac-
tors of production (land, labor, and capital).
When goods and services are produced, income flows throughout the economy.
For example, consider a manufacturer of computers. At the same time the computer
manufacturer produces and sells new computers, it also generates income through its
production. The computer manufacturer pays wages to workers, perhaps pays rent on
offices and factory buildings, and pays interest on money it borrowed from a bank.
Whatever is left over after paying for the cost of production is the firms profit, which
is income to the owners of the firm. Wages, rents, interest, and profits are all different
forms of income.
In an example with a government, your taxes pay for a school district to hire prin-
cipals, teachers, and other staff to provide educational services to the students in your
community. These educational services are an important part of production in our
modern economy that produces both goods and services. At the same time, the princi-
pals, teachers, and staff all earn income through their employment with the school
district. The school district may also rent buildings where classes are held and pay
interest on borrowed funds.
Our goal is to understand both sides of this macroeconomic coin
the produc-
tion in the economy and the generation of income in the economy. In the United

* FIGURE 5.1
The Circular Flow of Production
and Income
The circular flow shows how the produc-
tion of goods and services generates
income for households and how house-
holds purchase goods and services pro-
duced by firms.

States, the national income and product accounts, published by the Department of
Commerce, are the source for the key data on production and income in the econ-
omy. As we will see, we can measure the value of output produced in the economy by
looking at either the production or income side of the economy. Let s begin by learn-
ing how to measure the production for the entire economy.
THE PRODUCTION APPROACH: MEASURING
A NATION S MACROECONOMIC ACTIVITY
USING GROSS DOMESTIC PRODUCT
To measure the production of the entire economy, we need to combine an enormous
array of goods and services
everything from new computers to NBA and WNBA
basketball games. We can actually add computers to basketball games, as we could
add apples and oranges if we were trying to determine the total monetary value of a
fruit harvest. Our goal is to summarize the total production of an entire economy
into a single number, which we call the gross domestic product (GDP). Gross
domestic product is the total market value of all the final goods and services pro-
duced within an economy in a given year. GDP is also the most common measure of
an economy s total output. All the words in the GDP definition are important, so let s
analyze them.
Total market value  means we take the quantity of goods produced, multiply
them by their respective prices, and then add up the totals. If an economy produced
two cars at $25,000 per car and three computers at $2,000 per computer, the total
value of these goods will be
The reason we multiply the goods by their prices is that we cannot simply add
together the number of cars and the number of computers. Using prices allows us to
express the value of everything in a common unit of measurement
in this case, dol-
lars. (In countries other than the United States, we express the value in terms of the
local currency.) We add apples and oranges together by finding out the value of both
the apples and the oranges, as measured by what you would pay for them, and adding
them up in terms of their prices.
Final goods and services  in the definition of GDP means those goods and ser-
vices that are sold to ultimate, or final, purchasers. For example, the two cars that were
produced would be final goods if they were sold to households or to a business.
However, to produce the cars the automobile manufacturer bought steel that went
into the body of the cars, and we do not count this steel as a final good or service in
GDP. Steel is an example of an intermediate good, one that is used in the production
process. An intermediate good is not considered a final good or service.
The reason we do not count intermediate goods as final goods is to avoid double-
counting. The price of the car already reflects the price of the steel contained in it. We
do not want to count the steel twice. Similarly, the large volumes of paper a commer-
cial printing firm uses also are intermediate goods, because the paper becomes part of
the final product delivered by the printing firm to its clients.
The final words in our definition of GDP are in a given year.  GDP is
expressed as a rate of production, that is, as X  amount of dollars per year. In 2008,
for example, GDP in the United States was $14,196 billion. Goods produced in
prior years, such as cars or houses, are not included in GDP for a given year, even if

one consumer sells a house or car to another in that year. Only newly produced prod-
ucts are included in GDP.
Because we measure GDP using the current prices for goods and services,
GDP will increase if prices increase, even if the physical amount of goods that are
produced remains the same. Suppose that next year the economy again produces
two cars and three computers, but all the prices in the economy double: The price
of cars is $50,000, and the price of computers is $4,000. GDP will also be twice as
high, or $112,000, even though the quantity produced is the same as during the
prior year:
But to say that GDP has doubled would be misleading, because exactly the same
goods were produced. To avoid this problem, let s apply the real-nominal principle,
one of our five basic principles of economics.
R E A L - N O M I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
What matters to people is the real value of money or income
its purchasing
power
not the face value of money or income.
What we need is another measure of total output that doesn t increase just
because prices increase. For this reason, economists have developed the concept of
real GDP, a measure that controls for changes in prices. Later in this chapter, we
explain how real GDP is calculated. The basic idea is simple. When we use current
prices to measure GDP, we are using nominal GDP. Nominal GDP can increase for
one of two reasons: Either the production of goods and services has increased, or the
prices of those goods and services have increased.
To explain the concept of real GDP, we first need to look at a simple example.
Suppose an economy produces a single good: computers. In year 1, 10 computers
were produced, and each sold for $2,000. In year 2, 12 computers were produced, and
each sold for $2,100. Nominal GDP is $20,000 in year 1 and $25,200 in year 2; it has
increased by a factor of 1.26 or 26 percent. However, we can also measure real GDP
by using year 1 prices as a measure of what was produced in year 1 and what was pro-
duced in year 2. In year 1, real GDP is
In year 2, real GDP (in year 1 terms) is
Real GDP in year 2 is still greater than real GDP in year 1, now by a factor of 1.2,
or 20 percent. The key idea is that we construct a measure using the same prices for
both years and thereby take price changes into account.
Figure 5.2 plots real GDP for the U.S. economy for the years 1930 through 2009.
The graph shows that real GDP has grown substantially over this period. This is what
economists call economic growth
sustained increases in the real GDP of an econ-
omy over a long period of time. In Chapter 8, we ll study economic growth in detail.
Later in this chapter, we ll look carefully at the behavior of real GDP over shorter
periods, during which time it can rise and fall. Decreases in real GDP disrupt the
economy greatly and lead to unemployment.

The Components of GDP
Economists divide GDP into four broad categories, each corresponding to different
types of purchases represented in GDP:
1 Consumption expenditures: purchases by consumers
2 Private investment expenditures: purchases by firms
3 Government purchases: purchases by federal, state, and local governments
4 Net exports: net purchases by the foreign sector (domestic exports minus domes-
tic imports)
Before discussing these categories, lets look at some data for the U.S. economy to
get a sense of the size of each of these four components. Table 5.1 shows the figures for
GDP for the fourth quarter of 2009. (A quarter is a three-month period; the first quarter
runs from January through March, while the fourth quarter runs from October through
December. Quarterly GDP expressed at annual rates is GDP for a year if the entire year
were the same as the measured quarter.) In the fourth quarter of 2009, GDP was $14,461
billion, or approximately $14.4 trillion. To get a sense of the magnitude, consider that
the U.S. population is approximately 300 million people, making GDP per person

PART 2
approximately $48,203. (This does not mean every man, woman, and child actually
spends $48,203, but it is a useful indicator of the productive strength of the economy.)
CONSUMPTION EXPENDITURES
Consumption expenditures are purchases by
consumers of currently produced goods and services, either domestic or foreign.
These purchases include flat-screen TVs, smart phones, automobiles, clothing, hair-
styling services, jewelry, movie or basketball tickets, food, and all other consumer
items. We can break down consumption into durable goods, nondurable goods, and
services. Durable goods, such as automobiles or refrigerators, last for a long time.
Nondurable goods, such as food, last for a short time. Services are work in which people
play a prominent role in delivery (such as a dentist filling a cavity). They range from
haircutting to health care and are the fastest-growing component of consumption in
the United States. Overall, consumption spending is the most important component
of GDP, constituting about 70 percent of total purchases.
PRIVATE INVESTMENT EXPENDITURES
Private investment expenditures in
GDP consist of three components:
1 First, there is spending on new plants and equipment during the year. If a firm
builds a new factory or purchases a new machine, the new factory or new machine
is included in the year s GDP. Purchasing an existing building or buying a used
machine does not count in GDP, because the goods were not produced during
the current year.
2 Second, newly produced housing is included in investment spending. The sale of
an existing home to a new owner is not counted, because the house was not built
in the current year.
3 Finally, if firms add to their stock of inventories, the increase in inventories dur-
ing the current year is included in GDP. If a hardware store had $1,000 worth of
nuts and bolts on its shelves at the beginning of the year and $1,100 at the year s
end, its inventory investment is $100 ($1,100  $1,000). This $100 increase in
inventory investment is included in GDP.
We call the total of new investment expenditures gross investment. During the
year, some of the existing plant, equipment, and housing will deteriorate or wear out.
This wear and tear is called depreciation, or sometimes a capital consumption
allowance. If we subtract depreciation from gross investment, we obtain net invest-
ment. Net investment is the true addition to the stock of plant, equipment, and
housing in a given year.
Make sure you understand this distinction between gross investment and net
investment. Consider the $1,716 billion in total investment spending for the fourth
quarter of 2009, a period in which there was $1,525 billion in depreciation in the pri-
vate sector. That means there was only $191 billion ($1,716  $1,525) in net invest-
ment by firms in that year; 88 percent of gross investment went to make up for
depreciation of existing capital.
Warning:
When we discuss measuring production in the GDP accounts, we use
investment in a different way than that with which you may be accustomed. For an
economist, investment in the GDP accounts means purchases of new final goods and
services by firms. In everyday conversation, we may talk about investing in the stock
market or investing in gold. Buying stock for $1,800 on the stock market is a purchase
of an existing financial asset; it is not the purchase of new goods and services by firms.
Therefore, that $1,800 does not appear anywhere in GDP. The same is true of pur-
chasing a gold bar. In GDP accounting, investment denotes the purchase of new capi-
tal. Be careful not to confuse the common usage of investment with the definition of
investment as we use it in the GDP accounts.
GOVERNMENT PURCHASES
Government purchases are the purchases of
newly produced goods and services by federal, state, and local governments. They
include any goods that the government purchases plus the wages and benefits of all
consumption expenditures
Purchases of newly produced goods and
services by households.
private investment expenditures
Purchases of newly produced goods and
services by firms.
gross investment
Total new investment expenditures.
depreciation
Reduction in the value of capital goods
over a one-year period due to physical
wear and tear and also to obsolescence;
also called capital consumption allowance.
net investment
Gross investment minus depreciation.
government purchases
Purchases of newly produced goods and
services by local, state, and federal
governments.

government workers (paid when the government purchases their services as employ-
ees). Investment spending by government is also included. The majority of spending
in this category comes from state and local governments: $1,790 billion of the total
$2,960 billion in 2009. Government purchases affect our lives very directly. For exam-
ple, all salaries of U.S. postal employees and federal airport security personnel are
counted as government purchases.
This category does not include all spending by governments. It excludes transfer
payments, payments to individuals that are not associated with the production of
goods and services. For example, payments for Social Security, welfare, and interest
on government debt are all considered transfer payments and thus are not included in
government purchases in GDP. Nothing is being produced by the recipients in return
for money being paid, or transferred,  to them. But wage payments to the police,
postal workers, and the staff of the Internal Revenue Service are all included, because
they do correspond to services these workers are currently producing.
Because transfer payments are excluded from GDP, a vast portion of the budget of
the federal government is not part of GDP. In 2008, the federal government spent
approximately $3,454 billion, of which only $1,170 billion (about 33 percent) was
counted as federal government purchases. Transfer payments are important, however,
because they affect both the income of individuals and their consumption and savings
behavior. Transfer payments also affect the size of the federal budget deficit, which we
will study in a later chapter. At this point, keep in mind the distinction between gov-
ernment purchases
which are included in GDP
and total government spending or
expenditure
which may not be included.
NET EXPORTS
To understand the role of the foreign sector, we first need to define
three terms. Imports are goods and services we buy from other countries. Exports
are goods and services made here and sold to other countries. Net exports are total
exports minus total imports. In Table 5.1, we see that net exports in the first quarter
of 2009 were $449 billion. Net exports were negative because our imports exceeded
our exports.
Consumption, investment, and government purchases include all purchases by
consumers, firms, and the government, whether or not the goods were produced in
the United States. However, GDP is supposed to measure the goods produced in the
United States. Consequently, we subtract purchases of foreign goods by consumers,
firms, or the government when we calculate GDP, because these goods were not pro-
duced in the United States. At the same time, we add to GDP any goods produced
here and sold abroad, for example, airplanes made in the United States and sold in
Europe. By including net exports as a component of GDP, we correctly measure U.S.
production by adding exports and subtracting imports.
Suppose someone in the United States buys a $25,000 car made in Japan. If we
look at final purchases, we will see that consumption spending rose by $25,000 because
a consumer made a purchase of a consumption good. Net exports fell by $25,000, how-
ever, because we subtracted the value of the import (the car) from total exports. Notice
that total GDP did not change with the purchase of the car. This is exactly what we
want in this case, because the car wasn t produced in the United States.
Now suppose the United States sells a car for $22,000 to a resident of Spain. In
this case, net exports increase by $22,000 because the car was a U.S. export. GDP will
also be a corresponding $22,000 higher because this sale represents U.S. production.
Recall that for the United States in the fourth quarter of 2009 net exports were
$449 billion dollars. In other words, in that quarter the United States bought
$449 billion more goods from abroad than it sold abroad. When we buy more goods
from abroad than we sell, we have a trade deficit. A trade surplus occurs when our
exports exceed our imports. Figure 5.3 shows the U.S. trade surplus as a share of GDP
from 1960 to 2009. Although at times the United States has had a small trade surplus,
it has generally run a trade deficit. In recent years, the trade deficit has increased and
has fluctuated between 3 and 6 percent of GDP. In later chapters, we study how trade
deficits can affect a countrys GDP.

PART 2
Putting It All Together: The GDP Equation
We can summarize our discussion of who purchases GDP with a simple equation that
combines the four components of GDP:
where
In other words,
This equation is an identity, which means it is always true no matter what the values
of the variables are. In any economy, GDP consists of the sum of its four components.
THE INCOME APPROACH: MEASURING A
NATION S MACROECONOMIC ACTIVITY
USING NATIONAL INCOME
Recall from the circular flow that one persons production ends up being another per-
son s income. Income is the flip side of our macroeconomic coin.  As a result, in
addition to measuring a nations activity by measuring production, we can also gauge
it by measuring a nations income. The total income earned by U.S. residents working
in the United States and abroad is called national income.
Measuring National Income
To measure national income, economists first make two primary adjustments to GDP.
First, we add to GDP the net income earned by U.S. firms and residents abroad.
To make this calculation, we add to GDP any income earned abroad by U.S. firms
or residents and subtract any income earned in the United States by foreign firms or

In the early 1980s, the United States ran
a trade surplus (when the line on the
graph is above zero, this indicates a sur-
plus). However, in other years the
United States has run a trade deficit. In
2004 through 2006, the trade deficit
exceeded 5 percent of GDP, although it
most recently is near 3 percent of GDP.

national income
The total income earned by a nation s
residents both domestically and abroad in
the production of goods and services.

residents. For example, we add the profits earned by U.S. multinational corpora-
tions that are sent back to the United States but subtract the profits from multi-
national corporations operating in the United States that are sent back to their
home countries. The profits Wal-Mart sends back to the United States from its
stores in Mexico are added to GDP. The profits Toyota earns in the United States
that it sends back to Japan are subtracted from GDP. The result of these adjust-
ments is the total income earned worldwide by U.S. firms and residents. This is the
gross national product (GNP).
The distinction between what they produce within their borders, GDP, and what
their citizens earn, GNP, is not that important to most countries. For the United
States, the difference between GDP and GNP is typically just 1 percent. In some
countries, however, the differences are much larger. The country of Kuwait, for exam-
ple, earned vast amounts of income from its oil riches, which it invested abroad in
stocks, bonds, and other types of investments. These earnings comprised approxi-
mately 9 percent of Kuwait s 2006 GNP. Foreigners have traditionally made large
investments in Australia. As they sent their profits back to their home countries,
Australia s net income from abroad was negative in 2006, and Australian GDP in that
year exceeded Australian GNP by 4.1 percent.
The second adjustment we make when calculating national income is to sub-
tract depreciation from GNP. Recall that depreciation is the wear and tear on
plant and equipment that occurred during the year. In a sense, our income is
reduced because our buildings and machines are wearing out. When we subtract
depreciation from GNP, we reach net national product (NNP), where net means
after depreciation.
After making these adjustments and taking into account statistical discrepancies,
we reach national income. (Statistical discrepancies arise when government statisticians
make their calculations using different sources of the same data.) Table 5.2 shows the
effects of these adjustments for the fourth quarter of 2009.

In turn, national income is divided among six basic categories: compensation of
employees (wages and benefits), corporate profits, rental income, proprietors
income (income of unincorporated business), net interest (interest payments
received by households from business and from abroad), and other items.
Approximately 65 percent of all national income goes to workers in the form of
wages and benefits. For most of the countries in the world, wages and benefits are
the largest part of national income.
In addition to national income, which measures the income earned in a given year
by the entire private sector, we are sometimes interested in determining the total pay-
ments that flow directly into households, a concept known as personal income. To
calculate personal income, we begin with national income and subtract any corporate
profits that are retained by the corporation and not paid out as dividends to house-
holds. We also subtract all taxes on production and imports and social insurance taxes,
which are payments for Social Security and Medicare. We then add any personal
interest income received from the government and consumers and all transfer pay-
ments. The result is the total income available to households, or personal income.
The amount of personal income that households retain after paying income taxes is
called personal disposable income.

107
PART 2
Measuring National Income through Value Added
Another way to measure national income is to look at the value added of each firm in
the economy. For a firm, we can measure its value added by the dollar value of the
firm s sales minus the dollar value of the goods and services purchased from other
firms. What remains is the sum of all the income
wages, profits, rents, and interest
that the firm generates. By adding up the value added for all the firms in the economy
(plus nonprofit and governmental organizations), we can calculate national income.
Lets consider a simple example illustrated in Table 5.3.
value added
The sum of all the income
wages,
interest, profits, and rent
generated by
an organization. For a firm, we can
measure value added by the dollar value of
the firms sales minus the dollar value of
the goods and services purchased from
other firms.

Suppose an economy consists of two firms: an automobile firm that sells its cars to
consumers and a steel firm that sells only to the automobile firm. If the automobile
company sells a car for $16,000 to consumers and purchases $6,000 worth of steel from
the steel firm, the auto firm has $10,000 remaining
its value added
which it can
then distribute as wages, rents, interest, and profits. If the steel firm sells $6,000 worth
of steel but does not purchase any inputs from other firms, its value added is $6,000,
which it pays out in the form of wages, rents, interest, and profits. Total value added in
the economy from both firms is $16,000 ($10,000 + $6,000), which is the sum of wages,
rents, interest, and profits for the entire economy (consisting of these two firms).
As this example illustrates, we measure the value added for a typical firm by starting
with the value of its total sales and subtracting the value of any inputs it purchases from
other firms. The amount of income that remains is the firms value added, which is then
distributed as wages, rents, interest, and profits. In calculating national income, we need
to include all the firms in the economy, even the firms that produce intermediate goods.
A P P L I C AT I O N 1
USING VALUE ADDED TO MEASURE THE TRUE SIZE OF
WAL-MART
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How can we use economic analysis to
compare the size of a major corporation to the size of a country?
During 2008, Wal-Marts sales were approximately $374 billion, nearly 2.6 percent of
U.S. GDP. Some social commentators might want to measure the impact of Wal-Mart
just through its sales. But to produce those sales, Wal-Mart had to buy goods from many
other companies. Wal-Marts value added was substantially less than its total sales. Based
on Wal-Marts annual reports, its cost of sales was $286 billion, leaving approximately
$88 billion in value added. This is a very large number, as might be expected from the
worlds largest retailer, but it is much smaller than its total sales. If we used Wal-Marts
sales to compare it to a country, it would have a GDP similar to that of Belgium, which is
ranked 28th in the world. However, using the more appropriate measure of value added,
Wal-Marts size is closer to Bulgaria, ranked 56th in the world.

MEASURING A NATION S PRODUCTION AND INCOME
108
An Expanded Circular Flow
Now that we have examined both production and income, including both the gov-
ernment and the foreign sector, let s take another look at a slightly more realistic cir-
cular flow. Figure 5.4 depicts a circular flow that includes both the government and
the foreign sector. Both households and firms pay taxes to the government. The
government, in turn, supplies goods and services in the product market and also
purchases inputs
labor and capital
in the factor markets, just like private-sector
firms do. Net exports, which can be positive or negative, are shown entering or leav-
ing the product market.
In summary, we can look at GDP from two sides: We can ask who buys the output
that is produced, or we can ask how the income that is created through the production
process is divided between workers and investors. From the spending side, we saw that
nearly 70 percent of GDP consists of consumer expenditures. From the income side,
we saw that nearly 65 percent of national income is paid in wages and benefits.
Macroeconomists may use data based either on the production that occurs in the
economy or on its flip side, the income that is generated, depending on whether they
are more focused on current production or on current income.

A CLOSER EXAMINATION OF NOMINAL
AND REAL GDP
We have discussed different ways to measure the production of an economy, looking
at both who purchases goods and services and the income it generates. Of all the mea-
sures we have discussed, GDP is the one most commonly used both by the public and
by economists. Lets take a closer look at it.

Measuring Real versus Nominal GDP
Output in the economy can increase from one year to the next. And prices can rise
from one year to the next. Recall that we defined nominal GDP as GDP measured in
current prices, and we defined real GDP as GDP adjusted for price changes.
Now we take a closer look at how real GDP is measured in modern economies.
Let s start with a simple economy in which there are only two goods
cars and
computers
produced in the years 2011 and 2012. The data for this economy
the
prices and quantities produced for each year
are shown in Table 5.4. The produc-
tion of cars and the production of computers increased, but the production of com-
puters increased more rapidly. The price of cars rose, while the price of computers
remained the same.
Lets first calculate nominal GDP for this economy in each year. Nominal GDP is
the total market value of goods and services produced in each year. Using the data in
the table, we can see that nominal GDP for the year 2011 is
Similarly, nominal GDP for the year 2012 is
Now we ll find real GDP. To compute real GDP, we calculate GDP using con-
stant prices. What prices should we use? For the moment, lets use the prices for the
year 2011. Because we are using 2011 prices, real GDP and nominal GDP for 2011
are both equal to $45,000. But for 2012, they are different. In 2012, real GDP is
Note that real GDP for 2012, which is $65,000, is less than nominal GDP for
2012, which is $75,000. The reason real GDP is less than nominal GDP here is that
prices of cars rose by $2,000 between 2011 and 2012, and we are measuring GDP
using 2011 prices. We can measure real GDP for any other year simply by calculating
GDP using constant prices.
We now calculate the growth in real GDP for this economy between 2011 and
2012. Because real GDP was $45,000 in 2011 and $65,000 in 2012, real GDP grew by
$20,000. In percentage terms, this is a $20,000 increase from the initial level of
$45,000 or
which equals 44.4 percent. This percentage is an average of the growth rates for both
goods
cars and computers.
Figure 5.5 depicts real and nominal GDP for the United States from 1950 to
2009. Real GDP is measured in 2000 dollars, so the curves cross in 2000. Before 2000,
nominal GDP is less than real GDP because prices in earlier years were lower than
they were in 2000. After 2000, nominal GDP exceeds real GDP because prices in later
years were higher than they were in 2000.
Percentage growth in real GDP = $20,000
$45,000 = .444
(5 cars * $10,000) + (3 computers * $5,000) = $65,000
(5 cars * $12,000) + (3 computers * $5,000) = $75,000
(4 cars * $10,000) + (1 computer * $5,000) = $45,000

CHAPTER 5

How to Use the GDP Deflator
We can also use the data in Table 5.4 to measure the changes in prices for this econ-
omy of cars and computers. The basic idea is that the differences between nominal
GDP and real GDP for any year arise only because of changes in prices. So by com-
paring real GDP and nominal GDP, we can measure the changes in prices for the
economy. In practice, we do this by creating an index, called the GDP deflator, that
measures how prices of goods and services change over time. Because we are calculat-
ing real GDP using year 2011 prices, we will set the value of this index equal to 100 in
the year 2011, which we call the base year. To find the value of the GDP deflator for
the year 2012 (or other years), we use the following formula:
Using this formula, we find that the value of the GDP deflator for 2012 is
Because the value of the GDP deflator is 115 in 2012 and was 100 in the base year of
2011, this means prices rose by 15 percent between the two years:
Note that this 15 percent is a weighted average of the price changes for the two
goods
cars and computers.
Until 1996, the Commerce Department, which produces the GDP figures, used
these formulas to calculate real GDP and measure changes in prices. Economists at the
department chose a base year and measured real GDP by using the prices in that base
year. They also calculated the GDP deflator, just as we did, by taking the ratio of nom-
inal GDP to real GDP. Today, the Commerce Department calculates real GDP and the
price index for real GDP using a more complicated method. In our example, we mea-
sured real GDP using 2011 prices. But we could have also measured real GDP using
prices from 2012. If we did, we would have come up with slightly different numbers

both for the increase in prices between the two years and for the increase in real GDP.
To avoid this problem, the Commerce Department now uses a chain-weighted index,
which is a method for calculating price changes that takes an average of price changes
using base years from consecutive years (that is, 2011 and 2012 in our example). If you
look online or at the data produced by the Commerce Department, you will see real
GDP measured in chained dollars and a chain-type price index for GDP.
FLUCTUATIONS IN GDP
As we have discussed, real GDP does not always grow smoothly
sometimes it col-
lapses suddenly, and the result is an economic downturn. We call such fluctuations
business cycles. Lets look at an example of a business cycle from the late 1980s and early
1990s. Figure 5.6 plots real GDP for the United States from 1988 to 1992. Notice
that in mid-1990, real GDP begins to fall. A recession is a period when real GDP
falls for six or more consecutive months. Economists talk more in terms of quarters of
the year
consecutive three-month periods
than in terms of months. So they would
say that a recession occurs when real GDP falls for two consecutive quarters. The date
at which the recession starts
that is, when output starts to decline
is called the
peak. The date at which it ends
that is, when output starts to increase again
is
called the trough. In Figure 5.6, we see the peak and trough of the recession. After a
trough, the economy enters a recovery period, or period of expansion.
From World War II through 2010, the United States experienced 11 recessions.
Table 5.5 contains the dates of the peaks and troughs of each recession, the percent
decline in real GDP from each peak to each trough, and the length of the recessions in
months. Complete information is not yet available for the most recent recession, which
began in December 2007. Aside from the most recent recession, which was very severe,
the sharpest decline in output occurred during the recession from 1973 to 1975, which
started as a result of a sharp rise in world oil prices. This was also one of the longest
recessions, although the most recent recession will most likely be the longest.
In the last three decades, there have been four recessions, three of them starting
near the beginning of each of the decades: 1981, 1990, and 2001. In the 2001 reces-
sion, employment began to fall in March 2001, before the terrorist attack on the
United States on September 11, 2001. The attack further disrupted economic activity
and damaged producer and consumer confidence, and the economy tumbled through
a recession. The recession that began in December 2007 followed a sharp decline in
the housing sector and the financial difficulties associated with this decline. It deep-
ened during the financial crisis that hit in September and October of 2008. As credit

became less available to both businesses and consumers, the effects of the financial cri-
sis began to show up in reduced consumer spending for durable goods such as auto-
mobiles and reduced business investment.
Throughout the broader sweep of U.S. history, other downturns have occurred
20 of them from 1860 up to World War II. Not all were particularly severe, and in
some unemployment hardly changed. However, some economic downturns, such as
those in 1893 and 1929, were severe.
Although we used the common definition of a recession as a period when real
GDP falls for six months, in practice, a committee of economists at the National
Bureau of Economics Research (NBER), a private research group in Cambridge,
A P P L I C AT I O N 2
COMPARING THE SEVERITY OF RECESSIONS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: How severe was the most recent recession
for the United States?
Was the most recent recession the most severe economic downturn since the Great
Depression? With the data now in, it appears that the recession starting in
December 2007 will rival the recession starting in November 1973, which was
caused by a sharp and unexpected rise in oil prices. From Table 5.5, we see that the
fall in output from peak to trough was 4.1 percent. A similar calculation based on
available quarterly data for the recent recession from the fourth quarter of 2007 to
the second quarter of 2009 reveals a fall of approximately 4.1%. On this measure,
the 2007 recession was equally severe as measured by the decline in GDP.
However, along other important dimensions, the 2007 recession was more dam-
aging to the economy. The 1973 recession lasted 16 months, while the 2007 recession
lasted 18 months, the longest in the postwar era. Additionally, the toll on workers
appears greater in the most recent recession. Unemployment rose from 4.9 percent to
8.5 percent in the earlier recession as compared to 4.6 percent to 10.0 percent in the
most recent recession.
Of course, governments can offset some of these effects on individuals through
social programs such as payments to those individuals who become unemployed or wel-
fare payments. For a complete analysis, we would want to look at the incomes of those
who lost their jobs as well as those who kept their jobs.

PART 2
Massachusetts, of primarily academic economists, officially proclaims the beginning
and end of recessions in the United States using a broader set of criteria than just GDP.
The NBER s formal definition is a significant decline in economic activity, spread
across the economy, lasting more than a few months, normally visible in production,
employment, real income, and other indicators.  As you can see, it uses a wide variety
of indicators to determine whether a recession has occurred and its length.
Depression is the common term for a severe recession. In the United States, the
Great Depression refers to the years 1929 through 1933, the period when real GDP
fell by over 33 percent. This drop in GDP created the most severe disruptions to ordi-
nary economic life in the United States during the twentieth century. Throughout the
country and in much of the world, banks closed, businesses failed, and many people
lost their jobs and their life savings. Unemployment rose sharply. In 1933, over
25 percent of people who were looking for work failed to find jobs.
Although the United States has not experienced a depression since that time,
other countries have. In the last 20 years, several Asian countries (for example,
Thailand) and Latin American countries (for example, Argentina) suffered severe eco-
nomic disruptions that were true depressions.
GDP AS A MEASURE OF WELFARE
GDP is our best measure of the value of output produced by an economy. As we have
seen, we can use GDP and related indicators to measure economic growth within a
country. In a later chapter, we will use GDP to compare the value of output across
countries as well. Economists use GDP and related measures to determine if an econ-
omy has fallen into a recession or has entered into a depression. But while GDP is a
very valuable measure of the health of an economy, it is not a perfect measure.
Shortcomings of GDP as a Measure of Welfare
There are several recognized flaws in the construction of GDP. We should thus be
cautious in interpreting GDP as a measure of our economic well-being, because it
does not take into account housework and childcare, leisure, the underground econ-
omy, or pollution.
HOUSEWORK AND CHILDCARE
First, GDP ignores transactions that do not
take place in organized markets. The most important example is services, such as
cleaning, cooking, and providing free childcare, that people do for themselves in their
own homes. Because these services are not transferred through markets, GDP statisti-
cians cannot measure them. If we included household production in GDP, measured
GDP would be considerably higher than currently reported.
LEISURE
Second, leisure time is not included in GDP because GDP is designed to
be a measure of the production that occurs in the economy. To the extent that house-
holds value leisure, increases in leisure time will lead to higher social welfare, but not
to higher GDP.
UNDERGROUND ECONOMY
Third, GDP ignores the underground economy,
where transactions are not reported to official authorities. These transactions can be
legal, but people don t report the income they have generated because they want to
avoid paying taxes on it. For example, wait staff may not report all their tips and own-
ers of flea markets may make under-the-table cash transactions with their customers.
Illegal transactions, such as profits from the illegal drug trade, also result in unre-
ported income. In the United States in 2005, the Internal Revenue Service estimated
(based on tax returns from 2001) that about $310 billion in federal income taxes from
the underground economy was not collected each year. If the federal income tax rate
that applies to income evaded from taxes was about 20 percent, approximately
$1.5 trillion ($310 billion ÷ 0.20) in income from the underground economy escaped
the GDP accountants that year, or about 15 percent of GDP at the time.

Economists have used a variety of methods to estimate the extent of the under-
ground economy throughout the world. They typically find that the size of the under-
ground economy is much larger in developing countries than in developed countries.
For example, in the highly developed countries, estimates of the underground econ-
omy are between 15 and 20 percent of reported or official GDP. However, in develop-
ing countries, estimates are closer to 40 percent of reported GDP. Table 5.6 contains

THE LINKS BETWEEN SELF-REPORTED HAPPINESS AND GDP
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Do increases in gross domestic product
necessarily translate into improvements in the welfare of citizens?
Two economists, David Blanchflower of Dartmouth College and Andrew Oswald of
Warwick University in the United Kingdom, have systematically analyzed surveys
over a nearly 30-year period that ask individuals to describe themselves as happy,
pretty happy, or not too happy.  The results of their work are provocative. Over the
last 30 years, reported levels of happiness have declined slightly in the United States
and remained relatively flat in the United Kingdom despite very large increases in per
capita income in both countries. Could it be the increased stress of everyday life has
taken its toll on our happiness despite the increase in income?
At any point in time, however, money does appear to buy happiness. Holding
other factors constant, individuals with higher incomes do report higher levels of
personal satisfaction. But these other factors  are quite important. Unemployment
and divorce lead to sharply lower levels of satisfaction. Blanchflower and Oswald cal-
culate that a stable marriage is worth $100,000 per year in terms of equivalent
reported satisfaction.
Perhaps most interesting are their findings about trends in the relative happiness
of different groups in our society. While whites report higher levels of happiness than
African Americans, the gap has decreased over the last 30 years, as the happiness of
African Americans has risen faster than that of whites. Mens happiness has risen rela-
tive to that of women over the last 30 years.
Finally, in recent work Blanchflower and Oswald looked at how happiness varies
over the life cycle. Controlling for income, education, and other personal factors, they
found that in the United States, happiness among men and women reaches a mini-
mum at the ages of 49 and 45, respectively. Since these are also the years in which
earnings are usually the highest, it does suggest that work takes its toll on happiness.

estimates of the underground economy as a percent of reported GDP for different
regions of the world.
POLLUTION
Fourth, GDP does not value changes in the environment that occur in
the production of output. Suppose a factory produces $1,000 of output but pollutes a
river and lowers its value by $2,000. Instead of recording a loss to society of $1,000,
GDP will show a $1,000 increase. This is an important limitation of GDP accounting
as a measure of our economic well-being, because changes in the environment affect
our daily lives. Previous attempts by the Commerce Department to measure the effects
of changes in environment by adding positive or subtracting negative changes to the
environment from national income did not yield major results. But they were limited
and looked only at a very select part of the environment. Has our environment
improved or deteriorated as we experienced economic growth? Finding the answer to
this question will pose a real challenge for the next generation of economic statisticians.
Most of us would prefer to live in a country with a high standard of living, and few
of us would want to experience poverty up close. But does a higher level of GDP really
lead to more satisfaction?
In this chapter, we learned
how economists and govern-
ment statisticians measure
the income and production
for an entire country and what
these measures are used for.
Developing meaningful statis-
tics for an entire economy is
difficult. As we have seen, statistics can convey useful informa-
tion
if they are used with care. Here are some of the main
points to remember in this chapter:
1 The circular flow diagram shows how the production of goods
and services generates income for households and how house-
holds purchase goods and services by firms. The expanded cir-
cular flow diagram includes government and the foreign sector.
2 Gross domestic product (GDP) is the market value of all final
goods and services produced in a given year.
3 GDP consists of four components: consumption, investment,
government purchases, and net exports. The following equa-
tion combines these components:
Y = C + I + G + NX
The GDP deflator is an index that measures how the prices of
goods and services included in GDP change over time. The
following equation helps us find the GDP deflator:
4 National income is obtained from GDP by adding the net
income U.S. individuals and firms earn from abroad, then
subtracting depreciation.
5 Real GDP is calculated by using constant prices. The
Commerce Department now uses methods that take an aver-
age using base years from neighboring years.
6 A recession is commonly defined as a six-month consecu-
tive period of negative growth. However, in the United
States, the National Bureau of Economic Research uses a
broader definition.
7 GDP does not include nonmarket transactions, leisure time,
the underground economy, or changes to the environment.

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
For February 2010, the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
reported that the unemployment rate was 9.7 percent.
The unemployed were those who did not have jobs, but
were actively looking for work.
However, the official unemployment statistics did not
include the following individuals:
A steelworker in Ohio who was laid off two years ago.
He stopped looking for work because there were no
steel mills remaining in his town, and he believed no
jobs were available.
A young woman living in the far suburbs of a city. She
wanted to work and had worked in the past, but she had
no transportation to the places where jobs were available.
A young computer programmer who was working
25 hours a week. He wanted to work 40 hours a week,
but his employer did not have enough work for him,
because most of the company s programming work had
been contracted to India. Nor could he easily find
another job.
The BLS publishes an alternative measure of unemploy-
ment that includes these cases. In February 2010 the
unemployment rate by that measure was 16.8 percent.
Which unemployment measure gives a more accurate pic-
ture of the labor market?

I
n this chapter, we look at unemployment and inflation, two key phenomena in
macroeconomics. Losing a job is one of the most stressful experiences a person
can suffer. For the elderly, the fear that the purchasing power of their wealth will
evaporate with inflation is also a source of deep concern.
We will examine how economists define unemployment and inflation and the
problems in measuring them. We also will explore the various costs that unemploy-
ment and inflation impose on society. Once we have a basic understanding of what
unemployment and inflation are, we will be able to investigate their causes further.
EXAMINING UNEMPLOYMENT
When an economy performs poorly, it imposes costs on individuals and society.
Recall from Chapter 5 that one of the key issues for macroeconomics is understand-
ing fluctuations
the ups and downs of the economy. During periods of poor eco-
nomic performance and slow economic growth, unemployment rises sharply and
becomes a cause of public concern. During times of good economic performance
and rapid economic growth, unemployment falls, but does not disappear. Our first
task is to understand how economists and government statisticians measure unem-
ployment and then learn to interpret what they measure.
How Is Unemployment Defined and Measured?
Let s begin with some definitions. The unemployed are those individuals who do not
currently have a job but who are actively looking for work. The phrase actively looking
is critical. Individuals who looked for work in the past but who are not looking cur-
rently are not counted as unemployed. The employed are individuals who currently
have jobs. Together, the unemployed and employed comprise the labor force:
The unemployment rate is the number of unemployed divided by the total labor
force. This rate represents the percentage of the labor force unemployed and looking
for work:
Finally, we need to understand what is meant by the labor force participation
rate, which is the labor force divided by the population 16 years of age and older. This
rate represents the percentage of the population 16 years of age and older that is in the
labor force:
To illustrate these concepts, suppose an economy consists of 200,000 individuals
16 years of age and older. Of all these people, 122,000 are employed and 8,000 are
unemployed. This means that 130,000 (122,000 + 8,000) people are in the labor force.
The labor force participation rate is 0.65, or 65 percent (130,000/200,000), and the
unemployment rate is 0.0615, or 6.15 percent (8,000/130,000).
Figure 6.1 helps to put these measurements into perspective for the U.S. econ-
omy. The total civilian population 16 years of age and older in February 2010 was
236,998,000 individuals. We divide this population into two groups: those in the
labor force (the employed plus the unemployed, totaling 153,512,000) and those
outside the labor force 83,487,000. For this year, the labor force participation rate
was 65 percent (153,512,000/236,998,000). As you can see, approximately two
thirds of the U.S. population participates in the labor force. Within the labor force,

138,641,000 were employed and 14,871,000 were unemployed. The unemployment
rate was 9.7 percent (14,871,000/153,512,000). Military personnel are excluded
from these measures.
One of the most important trends in the last 50 years has been the increase in the
participation of women in the labor force. But, as the next Application indicates, it
appears that increase has come to an end.
Figure 6.2 contains international data on unemployment for 2010 for devel-
oped countries. Despite the fact these countries all have modern, industrial
economies, notice the sharp differences in unemployment. For example, Belgium
had a 12.1 percent unemployment rate, whereas Japan had an unemployment rate
of 4.9 percent. These sharp differences reflect a number of factors, including how
much government support is provided to unemployed workers. In countries in
which support is the most generous, there is less incentive to work and unemploy-
ment will tend to be higher.

Alternative Measures of Unemployment and Why They Are
Important
We defined the unemployed as those people who are looking for work but who do
not currently have jobs. With that in mind, let s take a closer look at our measures
of unemployment.

123
PART 2
It is relatively straightforward in principle to determine who is employed: Just
count the people who are working. What is more difficult is to distinguish between
those who are unemployed and those who are not in the labor force. How are these
two groups distinguished? The BLS, which is part of the Department of Labor, inter-
views a large sample of households each month. The BLS asks about the employment
situation of all household members 16 years of age and older. If someone in a house-
hold is not working, the interviewer asks whether the person is actively looking for
work. If the answer is yes,  he or she is classified as unemployed. If the answer is
no
he or she is not actively looking for work
that person is classified as not being
in the labor force.
The BLS measure of unemployment, however, does not capture all the employ-
ment experiences individuals face. In the chapter opener, we highlighted the cases of
three individuals who wanted full-time jobs but did not have them: a steelworker who
stopped looking for work because he felt there were no jobs, a young woman who did
not seek work because she had no transportation, and a computer programmer who
worked only part-time but sought full-time employment. None of them would be
counted as unemployed in the official statistics
the first two were not in the labor
force and the third was employed. Because of these limitations, in 1994 the BLS began
to publish alternative statistics that reflect these circumstances.
Individuals who want to work and have searched for work in the prior year, but
are not currently looking for work because they believe they won t be able to find a job
are called discouraged workers. Note that these individuals are not included in the
official statistics because they are not currently looking for work.
In addition to discouraged workers, there are individuals who would like to work
and have searched for work in the recent past, but have stopped looking for work for a
variety of reasons. These individuals are known as marginally attached workers.
Marginally attached workers consist of two groups: discouraged workers (who left the

AFTER GROWING SHARPLY, WOMEN S LABOR FORCE
PARTICIPATION HAS LEVELED OFF
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: What do the recent data show about trends
in the percentage of women who are working?
In 1948, the labor force participation rate for women 20 years and older was 32 per-
cent. By 1970, it had grown to 43 percent, and by 1997 it had reached 60 percent. This
trend reflected remarkable changes in our economy and society as women dramati-
cally increased their presence in the workforce. But since 1997, the figure has
remained virtually constant at 60 percent. It appears that womens labor force partici-
pation has reached a peak in the United States, somewhat short of the men s labor
force participation rate of approximately 76 percent.
One explanation for this trend is that women may simply have run out of available
time. From 1948 to the mid-1990s, women were able to increase their hours of work
by cutting back on the time that they spent on housework and other home duties.
With the advent of new technologies such as washing machines, dishwashers, and
other labor-saving devices, women could increase their labor force participation yet
still take primary care of their households. But even with new technology, housework
and childcare do take time. Because women provide more household services than
men, it is understandable why their labor force participation may have reached a peak.

discouraged workers

labor force because they could not find jobs) and workers who are not looking for jobs
for other reasons, including lack of transportation or childcare.
Finally, there are those workers who would like to be employed full-time but hold
part-time jobs. These individuals are counted as employed in the BLS statistics
because they have a job. However, they would like to be working more hours. They
are known as individuals working part time for economic reasons. We do not include in this
category individuals who prefer part-time employment.
How important are these alternative measures? Figure 6.3 puts them into perspec-
tive. In February 2010, 14.87 million individuals were officially classified as unem-
ployed. The number of discouraged workers was 1.20 million. Including the
discouraged workers, there were 2.52 million marginally attached workers. If we add
the marginally attached individuals to those who were involuntarily working part
time, the total is 11.31 million. Thus, depending on the statistic you want to emphasize,
there were anywhere between 14.87 million unemployed (the official number) and
26.18 million unemployed (the official number plus all those seeking full-time employ-
ment who did not have it). If we count those 26.18 million as unemployed, the unem-
ployment rate in 2010 would be 16.8 percent
substantially higher than the official rate
of 9.7 percent. As we have seen, the official statistics for unemployment do not include
the full range of individuals who would like to participate fully in the labor market.

Who Are the Unemployed?
Another fact about unemployment is that different groups of people suffer more unem-
ployment than others. Figure 6.4 contains some unemployment statistics for selected
groups for February 2010. Adults have substantially lower unemployment rates than

teenagers. Minorities have higher unemployment rates. African-American teenagers
have extremely high unemployment rates. On average, men and women have similar
unemployment rates, but the unemployment rates for married men and married
women are lower than unemployment rates of women who maintain families alone.
These differentials do vary somewhat as GDP rises and falls. Teenage and minor-
ity unemployment rates often rise very sharply during poor economic times, as was

MORE DISABILITY, LESS UNEMPLOYMENT?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: Does more liberal disability insurance
decrease measured unemployment?
The federal Disability Insurance program provides income to nonelderly workers
who are deemed unable to engage in substantial employment. It also provides health
care to these individuals. After 1984, the guidelines were changed to make it easier for
individuals to enter the program. From 1984 to 2001, the number of nonelderly adults
receiving payments from this program rose by 60 percent to 5.3 million.
Economists David Autor and Mark Duggan studied the impact of this program
on labor force participation. They found that the changes in the rules administering
the program, the increased generosity of the benefits of the program for low-skilled
workers, and the increase in the value of health-care services all contributed to an
increase in participation in this program. They estimated that the combination of
these factors led to a decrease in the labor force participation for high school dropouts
and other low-skilled workers. Since these workers, a portion of whom would have
been unemployed, were no longer in the labor force, the economists estimated that
the effect of the Disability Insurance program was to lower the measured unemploy-
ment rate by 0.5 percent, a very large effect.

the case in the most recent recession. In better times, a reduction of unemployment for
all groups typically occurs. Nonetheless, teenage and minority unemployment remains
relatively high at all times.
Many economic time series, including employment and unemployment, are
substantially influenced by seasonal factors. These are recurring calendar-related
effects caused by, for example, the weather, holidays, the opening and closing of
schools, and related factors. Unemployment due to recurring calendar effects is
called seasonal unemployment. Examples of seasonal unemployment include
higher rates of unemployment for farm workers and construction workers in the
winter and higher unemployment rates for teenagers in the early summer as they
look for summer jobs.
The BLS uses statistical procedures to remove these seasonal factors
that is, it
seasonally adjusts the statistics
so that users of the data can more accurately interpret
underlying trends in the economy. The seasonally adjusted unemployment rates con-
trol for these predictable patterns, so those patterns aren t reflected in the overall
unemployment numbers.
CATEGORIES OF UNEMPLOYMENT
To better understand the labor market, economists have found it very useful to break
unemployment into a variety of categories. As we shall see, it is valuable to distinguish
among the several different types of unemployment.
Types of Unemployment: Cyclical, Frictional, and Structural
After seasonally adjusting the unemployment statistics, we can divide unemploy-
ment into three other basic types: cyclical, frictional, and structural. By studying
each type separately, we can gain insight into some of the causes of each type of
unemployment.
The unemployment rate is closely tied to the overall fortunes of the economy.
Unemployment rises sharply during periods when real GDP falls and decreases when
real GDP grows rapidly. During periods of falling GDP, firms will not want to employ
as many workers as they do in good times because they are not producing as many
goods and services. Firms will lay off or fire some current workers and will be more
reluctant to add new workers to their payrolls. The result will be fewer workers with
jobs and rising unemployment. Economists call the unemployment that occurs during
fluctuations in real GDP cyclical unemployment. Cyclical unemployment rises dur-
ing periods when real GDP falls or grows at a slower-than-normal rate and decreases
when the economy improves.
However, unemployment still exists even when the economy is growing. For
example, the unemployment rate in the United States has not fallen below 3.9 percent
of the labor force since 1970. Unemployment that is not associated with economic
fluctuations is either frictional unemployment or structural unemployment.
Frictional unemployment is the unemployment that occurs naturally during the
normal workings of an economy. It occurs because it simply takes time for people to
find the right jobs and for employers to find the right people to hire. This happens
when people change jobs, move across the country, get laid off from their current jobs
and search for new opportunities, or take their time after they enter the labor force to
find an appropriate job. Suppose that when you graduate from college, you take six
months to find a job you like. During the six months in which you are looking for a
good job, you are among those unemployed who make up frictional unemployment.
Searching for a job, however, makes good sense. It would not be wise to take the first
job you were offered if it had low wages, poor benefits, and no future. Likewise,
employers are wise to interview multiple applicants for jobs to find the best employ-
ees, even if it takes some time.

127
PART 2
Could we eliminate unemployment by posting all job vacancies on the Internet
along with the résumés of job seekers and automatically match them up with one
another? It s possible that such an automated system could shorten the duration of
frictional unemployment, but it wouldn t eliminate it entirely. Some workers, for
example, would prefer to continue searching for jobs in their own area rather than
moving across the country to take the jobs they had been automatically matched with.
Firms would also still want to scrutinize employees very carefully, because hiring and
training a worker is costly.
Structural unemployment occurs when the economy evolves. It occurs when
different sectors give way to other sectors or certain jobs are eliminated while new
types of jobs are created. For example, when the vinyl record industry gave way to the
CD music industry in the 1980s, some workers found themselves structurally unem-
ployed, which meant they had to take the time to train themselves for jobs in different
industries. Structural unemployment is more of a permanent condition  than fric-
tional unemployment.
The line between frictional unemployment and structural unemployment is
sometimes hard to draw. Suppose a highly skilled software engineer is laid off because
his company shuts down its headquarters in his area and moves his job overseas. The
worker would like to find a comparable job, but only lower-wage work is available in
his immediate geographic location. Jobs are available, but not his kind of job, and this
high-tech company will never return to the area. Is this persons unemployment fric-
tional or structural? There really is no correct answer. You might think of the software
engineer as experiencing either frictional or structural unemployment. For all practi-
cal purposes, however, it does not matter which it is. The former software engineer is
still unemployed.
The Natural Rate of Unemployment
Total unemployment in an economy is composed of all three types of unemploy-
ment: cyclical, frictional, and structural. The level of unemployment at which there
is no cyclical unemployment is called the natural rate of unemployment. The
natural rate of unemployment consists of only frictional unemployment and struc-
tural unemployment. The natural rate of unemployment is the economist s notion
of what the rate of unemployment should be when there is full employment. It
may seem strange to think that workers can be unemployed when the economy is
at full employment. However, the economy actually needs some frictional unem-
ployment to operate efficiently: Frictional unemployment exists so that workers
and firms find the right employment matches. An economy that lacks frictional
unemployment will become stagnant.
In the United States today, economists estimate that the natural rate of unem-
ployment is between 5.0 and 6.5 percent. The natural rate of unemployment varies
over time and differs across countries. In Europe, for example, estimates of the nat-
ural rate of unemployment place it between 7 and 10 percent. In a later chapter, we
explore why the natural rate of unemployment is higher in Europe than in the
United States and why the natural rate of unemployment can vary over time in the
same country.
The actual unemployment rate can be higher or lower than the natural rate of
unemployment. During a period in which the real GDP fails to grow at its normal
rate, there will be positive cyclical unemployment, and actual unemployment can far
exceed the natural rate of unemployment. For example, in the United States in 2010
unemployment was about 10 percent of the labor force. As we pointed out in the pre-
vious chapter, a more extreme example occurred in 1933 during the Great
Depression, when the unemployment rate reached 25 percent. When the economy
grows very rapidly for a long period, actual unemployment can fall below the natural
rate of unemployment. With sustained rapid economic growth, employers will be
aggressive in hiring workers. During the late 1960s, unemployment rates fell below

4 percent, and the natural rate of unemployment was estimated to be over 5 percent.
In this case, cyclical unemployment was negative.
Unemployment also fell to 4 percent in 2000. In this case, many economists
believed that the natural rate of unemployment had fallen to close to 5 percent, so that
cyclical unemployment in that year was negative.
Just as a car will overheat if the engine is overworked, so will the economy over-
heat if economic growth is too rapid. At low unemployment rates, firms will find it
difficult to recruit workers, and competition among firms will lead to increases in
wages. As wages increase, increases in prices soon follow. The sign of this overheating
will be a general rise in prices for the entire economy, which we commonly call
inflation. As we discuss in later chapters, when the actual unemployment rate falls
below the natural rate of unemployment, inflation will increase.
THE COSTS OF UNEMPLOYMENT
When there is excess unemployment
actual unemployment above the natural rate of
unemployment
both society and individuals suffer economic loss. From a social
point of view, excess unemployment means that the economy is no longer producing
at its potential. The resulting loss of output can be very large. For example, in 1983,
when the unemployment rate averaged 9.6 percent, typical estimates of the shortfall of
GDP from potential were near 6 percent. Simply put, this meant that society was
wasting 6 percent of the total resources at its disposal.
To families with fixed obligations such as mortgage payments, the loss in income
can bring immediate hardships. Unemployment insurance, payments received from
the government upon becoming unemployed, can cushion the blow to some degree,
but unemployment insurance is typically only temporary and does not replace a
workers full earnings.
The effects of unemployment can also linger into the future. Workers who suffer
from a prolonged period of unemployment are likely to lose some of their skills. For
example, an unemployed stockbroker might be unaware of the latest developments
and trends in financial markets. This lack of knowledge will make it more difficult for
that person to find a job in the future. Economists who have studied the high rates of
unemployment among young people in Europe point to the loss of both skills and
good work habits (such as coming to work on time) as key factors leading to long-
term unemployment.
The costs of unemployment are not simply financial. In our society, a person s
status and position are largely associated with the type of job the person holds.
Losing a job can impose severe psychological costs. Some studies have found, for
example, that increased crime, divorce, and suicide rates are associated with
increased unemployment.
Not all unemployment lasts a long period of time for individuals. Some unemploy-
ment is very short term. Table 6.1 shows the percent of unemployed by the duration or
length of unemployment. In February 2010, approximately 18.3 percent of unemployed
workers had been out of work less than 5 weeks. At the other end, 40.9 percent were
unemployed more than 27 weeks. During better economic times with lower overall

unemployment, the percentage of short-term spells of unemployment increases and
percentage of long-term spells decrease. In the United States, unemployment is a mix-
ture of both short- and long-term unemployment.
Although unemployment insurance can temporarily offset some of the financial
costs of job loss, the presence of unemployment insurance also tends to increase the
length of time that unemployed workers remain unemployed. The extra financial
cushion that unemployment insurance provides allows workers to remain unemployed
a bit longer before obtaining another job. In other words, unemployment insurance
actually leads to additional time spent unemployed.
THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX AND THE
COST OF LIVING
Suppose you were reading a book written in 1964 in which the main character
received a starting salary of $5,000. Was that a high or low salary back then? To
answer that, we need to know what $5,000 could purchase. Or, to put it another way,
we need to know the value of the dollar
what a dollar would actually buy
in 1964.
Only then could we begin to know whether this was a high or low salary.
Or take another example. In 1976, a new starting professor in economics received
a salary of $15,000. In 2010, at the same university, a new starting professor received
$90,000. Prices, of course, had risen in these 30 years along with salaries. Which start-
ing professor had the better deal?
These examples are illustrations of one of our five principles of economics, the
real-nominal principle.

SOCIAL NORMS, UNEMPLOYMENT, AND PERCEIVED
HAPPINESS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Are you less upset from being unemployed if
unemployment is common in your peer group?
We know that individuals do not like to become unemployed. But how do feelings
about becoming unemployed depend on the experiences of those around one?
Economist Andrew E. Clark carefully examined the perceptions and the behavior of
the unemployed in Great Britain over a seven-year period. He looked at the responses
to survey questions by those individuals who became unemployed and constructed an
index of their general happiness or well-being.
He found, as expected, that peoples perceived well-being declined as they became
unemployed, and also that employed people become less happy if others around them
became unemployed. But his interesting and somewhat surprising finding was that,
for men, becoming unemployed caused less of a decrease in perceived well-being if
those in their peer group
family, household, or region
were also unemployed. In
other words, misery loved company. It was better (or less worse) to be unemployed if
others in their peer group were also unemployed.
Why did this matter? Clark also found that the more unhappy an individual was,
the more aggressive he or she would be to try to find a new job. So, if your peer group
is also unemployed, you may not be as aggressive in searching for work.
Unemployment, therefore, may last longer for individuals in these circumstances.
Related to Exercise 3.5.

R E A L - N O M I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
What matters to people is the real value of money or income
its
purchasing power
not the face value of money or income.
Economists have developed a number of different measures to track the cost of living
over time. The best known of these measures is the Consumer Price Index (CPI).
The CPI is widely used to measure changes in the prices consumers face. It mea-
sures changes in prices of a fixed basket of goods
a collection of items chosen to repre-
sent the purchasing pattern of a typical consumer. We first find out how much this
basket of goods costs in a given year. This is called the base year (it serves a similar pur-
pose as the base year we designated for the GDP deflator). We then ask how much it
costs in other years and measure changes in the cost of living relative to this base year.
The CPI index for a given year, say year K, is defined as
Suppose a basket of goods costs $200 in 1992, which we ll define as the base year.
In 2004, the same basket of goods is $250. First, the value for the CPI in 1992 (the
base year) is
That is, the CPI for 1992 is 100. Note that the base year for the CPI will always
equal 100. Now lets calculate the value of the CPI for 2004:
The CPI in 2004 is 125. The CPI rose from 100 in 1992 to 125 in 2004 in this
example, a 25 percent increase in average prices over this 12-year period.
Here is how you would use this information. Suppose you had $300 in 1992. How
much money would you need to be able to have the same standard of living in 2004? Find
the answer by multiplying the $300 by the ratio of the CPI in 2004 to the CPI in 1992:
You need $375 in 2004 just to maintain what was your standard of living in 1992.
This is the type of calculation that economists do to evaluate changes in living stan-
dards over time.
How do we actually calculate the CPI in practice? Each month, the BLS sends its
employees out to sample prices for over 90,000 specific items around the entire coun-
try. This is how they construct their representative basket of goods. Figure 6.5 shows
the broad categories the BLS uses in the CPI and the importance of each category in
household budgets. Rent and food and beverages account for 44 percent of total
spending by households.
The CPI versus the Chain Index for GDP
In Chapter 5, we discussed measuring nominal GDP and real GDP. We also men-
tioned that since 1996 the Commerce Department has used a chain-weighted index
(replacing the GDP deflator) to measure changes in prices for goods and services
included in GDP. The chain-weighted index for GDP and the CPI are both measures
of average prices for the economy, yet they differ in several ways.
$300 * 125
100 = $375
CPI in 2004 = 250
200 * 100 = 125
CPI in 1992 = 200
200 * 100 = 100
CPI in year K =
cost of basket in year K
cost of basket in base year * 100
CHAPTER 6

Consumer Price Index
A price index that measures the cost of a
fixed basket of goods chosen to represent
the consumption pattern of a typical
consumer.

131
PART 2
First, the CPI measures the costs of a typical basket of goods for consumers. It
includes goods produced in prior years (such as older cars) as well as imported goods.
The chain-weighted price index for GDP does not measure price changes from either
used goods or imports. The reason is that it is based on the calculation of GDP, which,
as we ve seen, measures only goods and services produced in the United States in the
current year.
Second, unlike the chain-weighted price index for GDP, the CPI asks how much a
fixed basket of goods costs in the current year compared to the cost of those same goods
in a base year. Because consumers tend to buy less of goods whose prices rise, the CPI
will tend to overstate true changes in the cost of living. For example, if the price of
steak rises, consumers may switch to chicken and spend less on steak. But if the current
basket of goods and services in the CPI includes steak, the CPI thinks the amount of
higher-priced steak in the basket is the same as the amount of steak before its price
increase. It does not allow the amount of steak in the index to decrease. Another mea-
surement problem occurs when new products are introduced into the marketplace,
again because the CPI measures a fixed basket of goods. The BLS will eventually adjust
its basket to account for successful new products, but it takes some time.
Problems in Measuring Changes in Prices
Most economists believe that in reality all the indexes, including the chain-weighted
index for GDP and the CPI, overstate actual changes in prices. In other words, the
increase in prices is probably less than the reported indexes tell us. The principal rea-
son for this overstatement is that we have a difficult time measuring quality improve-
ments. Suppose the new computers sold to consumers become more powerful and
more efficient each year. Suppose further that the dollar price of a new computer
remains the same each year. Even though the price remains the same, the computers
in later years are of much higher quality. If we looked simply at the price and did not
take into account the change in quality, we would say there was no price change for
computers. But in later years we are getting more computer power for the same price.
If we failed to take the quality change into account, we would not see that the price of
computer power has fallen.
Government statisticians do try to adjust for quality when they can. But quality
changes are so common in our economy and products evolve so rapidly that it is
impossible to keep up with all that is occurring. As a result, most economists believe
we overestimate the inflation rate by between 0.5 and 1.5 percent each year. This
overstatement has important consequences. Some government programs, such as
Durables 11%
Rent
26%
Household
services 9%
Transportation 7%
Medical 5%
Other services 7%
Apparel 6%
Nondurables
11%

beverages 18%
* FIGURE 6.5
Components of the Consumer Price Index (CPI)
Rent and food and beverages make up 44 percent of the CPI basket. The remainder consists of other
goods and services.

Social Security, automatically increase payments when the CPI goes up. Some union
contracts also have cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs), automatic wage changes
based on the CPI. If the CPI overstates increases in the cost of living, the government
and employers might be overpaying Social Security recipients and workers for
changes in the cost of living.
INFLATION
We have now looked at two different price indexes: the chain-weighted price index
used for calculating real GDP and the Consumer Price Index. Using either price
index, we can calculate the percentage rate of change of the index. The percentage
rate of change of a price index is the inflation rate:
Here is an example. Suppose a price index in a country was 200 in 1998 and 210
in 1999. Then the inflation rate between 1998 and 1999 was
In other words, the country experienced a 5 percent inflation rate.
It is important to distinguish between the price level and the inflation rate. In
everyday language, people sometimes confuse the level of prices with inflation. You
might hear someone say inflation is high in San Francisco because rents for apart-
ments are high, but this is not a correct use of the term inflation. Inflation refers not to
the level of prices, whether they are high or low, but to their percentage change. If rents
were high in San Francisco but remained constant over two years, there would be no
inflation in rents there during that time.
inflation rate = 210 - 200

= 0.05 = 5%

THE INTRODUCTION OF CELL PHONES AND THE BIAS IN
THE CPI
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: How large is the bias in the CPI due to not
immediately incorporating new goods?
Today, it is hard to imagine a world without cell phones. Every college student and
most high school students carry them everywhere. But cell phones were not intro-
duced to the public until 1983, and it took 15 years, until 1998, before the Bureau of
Labor Statistics included them in calculating the CPI!
Economist Jerry Hausman of MIT estimated the bias in the CPI caused by the
failure to include cell phones in a timely manner. He calculated that because of this
delay, the telecommunication component of the price index was biased upwards by
between 0.8 and 1.9 percent per year. In other words, instead of rising by 1.1 percent
per year, telecommunication prices should have been falling by 0.8 percent per year.
This is a significant bias.
But cell phones are not the only examples of the slow introduction of goods into
the CPI. The BLS also took 15 years to recognize room air conditioners in the CPI.
Since new products are constantly invented and introduced, the bias in the CPI can be
large.
Related to Exercise 4.9.

PART 2
Historical U.S. Inflation Rates
To gain some historical perspective, Figure 6.6 plots a price index for GDP from 1875 to
2009 for the United States. As you can see from the figure, from 1875 to the period just
before World War I, there was virtually no change in the price level. The price level rose
during World War I, fell after the war ended, and also fell sharply during the early 1930s.
However, the most pronounced feature of the figure is the sustained rise in prices begin-
ning around the 1940s. Unlike the earlier periods, in which the price level did not have a
trend, after 1940 the price level increased sharply. By 2010, the price level had increased by
a factor of 14 over its value in 1940. Table 6.2 contains the prices of a few selected goods
from the 1940s and in 2010. Wouldn t you like to buy a postage stamp today for $0.03?

deflation
Negative inflation or falling prices of
goods and services.
Taking a closer look at the period following World War II, Figure 6.7 plots the
inflation rate, the percentage change in the price index, from 1950 to 2009. In the
1950s and 1960s, the inflation rate was frequently less than 2 percent a year. The infla-
tion rate was a lot higher in the 1970s, reaching nearly 10 percent per year. In those
years, the economy suffered from several increases in the world price of oil. In recent
years, the inflation rate has subsided and has been between 2 and 3 percent.
The Perils of Deflation
Prices rarely fall today, but they have actually fallen at times in world history. You
might think it would be great if prices fell and we had what economists term a
deflation. It may surprise you, however, that we think you should hope deflation
never occurs.

During the Great Depression, the United States underwent a severe deflation.
Prices fell 33 percent on average, and wages fell along with prices. The biggest problem
caused by a deflation is that people cannot repay their debts. Imagine you owe $40,000
for your education and expect to be able to pay it off over several years if you earn
$27,000 a year. If a massive deflation caused your wages to fall to $18,000, you might not
be able to pay your $40,000 debt, which does not fall with deflation. You would be
forced to default on your loan, as millions of people did during the Great Depression.
In the 1990s, Japan experienced a deflation, although much milder than the Great
Depression in the United States
only about 1 percent per year. Nonetheless, banks
in Japan faced rocky economic times as borrowers, including large corporations,
defaulted on their loans. With its banks in difficult shape, Japan s economy has suf-
fered. Its experience in the 1990s mirrored the experience of other countries through-
out the world in the 1930s during the period of deflation.
THE COSTS OF INFLATION
Economists typically separate the costs of inflation into two categories. One includes
costs associated with fully expected or anticipated inflation. The other includes the
costs associated with unexpected or unanticipated inflation. Although inflation
causes both types of costs, it is convenient to discuss each case separately.
Anticipated Inflation
Lets consider the costs of anticipated inflation first. Suppose the economy had been
experiencing 5 percent annual inflation for many years and everyone was fully
adjusted to it.
Even in this case, inflation still has some costs. First, there are the actual physical
costs of changing prices, which economists call menu costs. Restaurant owners, cata-
log producers, and any other business that must post prices will have to incur costs to
physically change their prices because of inflation. For example, they will need to pay
to reprint their menus or billboards. Economists believe these costs are relatively
small for the economy.
Second, inflation will erode the value of the cash people hold. They will respond
by holding less cash at any one time. If they hold less cash, they must visit the bank or
their ATM more frequently because they will run out of cash sooner. Economists use
the term shoe-leather costs to refer to the additional costs people incur to hold less
cash. Economists who have estimated these costs find that they can be large, as much
as 1 percent of GDP.
In practice, our tax and financial systems do not fully adjust even to anticipated
inflation. It is difficult for the government and businesses to change their normal rules

PART 2
of operation every time inflation changes. As an example, consider the tax system. Our
tax system is typically based on nominal income, not real income. Suppose you own a
stock in a corporation and its value increases by 5 percent during the year. If the infla-
tion rate is also 5 percent a year, your stock did not increase in real terms
it just kept
up with inflation. Nonetheless, if you sold your stock at the end of the year, you would
be taxed on the full 5 percent gain, despite the fact that the real value of your stock did
not increase. Inflation distorts the operation of our tax and financial system.
Unanticipated Inflation
What if inflation is unexpected? The cost of unexpected inflation is arbitrary redistri-
butions of income. Suppose you expected the inflation rate would be 5 percent and
you negotiated a salary based on that expectation. On the one hand, if you miscalcu-
late and the inflation rate turns out to be higher, the purchasing power of your wages
will be less than you anticipated. Your employer will have gained at your expense. On
the other hand, if the inflation rate turned out to be less than 5 percent, the purchas-
ing power of your wage would be higher than you had anticipated. In this case, you
would gain at the expense of the company. As long as the inflation rate differs from
what is expected, there will be winners and losers.
These redistributions eventually impose real costs on the economy. Consider an
analogy. Suppose you live in a very safe neighborhood where no one locks the doors.
If a rash of burglaries (transfers between you and crooks) starts to occur, people will
invest in locks, alarms, and more police. You and your community will incur real costs
to prevent these arbitrary redistributions.
The same is true for unanticipated inflation. If a society experiences unanticipated
inflation, individuals and institutions will change their behavior. For example, poten-
tial homeowners will not be able to borrow from banks at fixed rates of interest, but
will be required to accept loans whose rates can be adjusted as inflation rates change.
Banks do not want to lend money at a fixed interest rate if there is a strong likelihood
that inflation will erode the real value of the income stream they expected. However,
if banks become reluctant to make loans with fixed interest rates, this imposes more
risk on homeowners.
What about the loans made prior to the unanticipated inflation? In this case,
debtors will gain at the expense of creditors. Creditors, on the one hand, will lose
because inflation will erode the amount of money they planned to earn on the loans.
But since the loans have already been made, there s nothing they can do about it.
Debtors, on the other hand, will get a deal. It will be easier for them to repay their
loans with inflated dollars.
If unanticipated inflation becomes extreme, individuals will spend more of their
time trying to profit from inflation rather than working at productive jobs. As infla-
tion became more volatile in the late 1970s in the United States, many people devoted
their time to speculation in real estate and commodity markets to try to beat inflation,
and the economy became less efficient. Latin American countries that have experi-
enced high and variable inflation rates know all too well these costs from inflation.
Indeed, when inflation rates exceed 50 percent per month, we have what is called
hyperinflation. Think about what an inflation rate of 50 percent a month means: If a
can of soda costs $1.25 at the beginning of the year, it would cost $162.00 at the end
of year! In a later chapter, we ll study the causes of hyperinflation, but you can readily
see that inflation of this magnitude would seriously disrupt normal commerce.
Even in less extreme cases, the costs of inflation are compounded as inflation
rises. At high inflation rates, these costs grow rapidly, and at some point policy-
makers are forced to take actions to reduce inflation. As we mentioned earlier, when
unemployment falls below the natural rate, inflation increases. Similarly, in later
chapters we ll see that stopping inflation may require unemployment to exceed its
natural rate and even plunge an economy into a recession. Although unemployment
and recessions are quite costly to society, they sometimes become necessary in the
face of high inflation.

b. labor force that is unemployed.
c. relevant population that is employed.
d. relevant population that is in the labor force.
In this chapter, we continued
our introduction to the basic
concepts of macroeconomics
and explored the nature of
both unemployment and infla-
tion. We also looked at the
complex issues involved in
measuring unemployment and
inflation as well as the costs of both to society. Here are the key
points to remember:
1 The unemployed are individuals who do not have jobs but
who are actively seeking employment. The labor force com-
prises both the employed and the unemployed. The
unemployment rate is the percentage of the labor force that
is unemployed:
2 Economists distinguish among different types of unemploy-
ment. Seasonal patterns of economic activity lead to seasonal
unemployment. There are three other types of unemploy-
ment. Frictional unemployment occurs through the normal
dynamics of the economy as workers change jobs and
industries expand and contract. Structural unemployment
arises because of a mismatch of workers  skills with job

opportunities. Cyclical unemployment occurs with the fluctua-
tions in economic activity.
3 Unemployment rates vary across demographic groups.
Alternative measures of unemployment take into account
individuals who would like to work full time, but who are no
longer in the labor force or are holding part-time jobs.
4 Economists measure changes in the cost of living through the
Consumer Price Index (CPI), which is based on the cost of
purchasing a standard basket of goods and services. The CPI
is used to measure changes in average prices over different
periods of time. The CPI index for a given year, say year K, is
defined as
5 We measure inflation as the percentage change in the
price level.
6 Economists believe that most price indexes, including the
CPI and the chain-weighted index for GDP, overstate true
inflation because they fail to capture quality improvements in
goods and services.
7 Unemployment imposes both financial and psychological
costs on workers.

low-wage workers than of high-wage workers.
Overall, average disability payments rise with the
average wage. Suppose wages of low-skilled workers
fell sharply relative to high-wage workers. How

has 100,000,000 people employed, 8,000,000 unem-
ployed, and 4,000,000 marginally attached workers.
What is the conventional measure of the unemploy-

1.12 Discouraged Workers in Japan and the United
States. Japan was concerned about a group of workers
called NEETs,  which meant not in education,
employment, or training.  In the United States, we

types of young, discouraged workers you would most
likely find in the United States.

Understanding Unemployment Differences across
Countries. A student looking at Figure 6.2 on

Apartment Vacancies and Unemployment. In a
major city, the vacancy rate for apartments was approx-
imately 5 percent, yet substantial numbers of individu-
als were searching for new apartments. Explain why this
occurs. Relate this phenomenon to unemployment.
2.7
Unemployment Rates in Large African Cities. In
many African countries, the government and interna-
tional corporations pay high wages for jobs in the major
cities, and many people migrate to the cities from farms
where earnings are low. Unemployment rates in the
city, therefore, are large. Can this be explained in terms
of frictional unemployment? Why or why not?

Understanding Peer Effects of Unemployment.
You might think it would be worse if other people are
unemployed at the same time as you were because it
would be harder to find a job. But the psychological
evidence shows the opposite. Give a few reasons why
unemployment may seem less painful to individuals if
their peers are also unemployed. (Related to
Application 3 on page 129.)

als with identical educational backgrounds but who
were not unemployed?

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
While immigration is a big issue in the United States,
emigration
the outflow of people
is a major issue in
other countries. Take the case of the Philippines. With a
population of 92 million, the estimate of overseas Philippine
workers is about 11 million, or 10 percent, of the population.
About half of these workers are only temporarily abroad
still that accounts for 5 percent of the total population and an
even higher percentage of the potential workforce.
These workers range in skills and occupations. In Hong
Kong many families have live-in Philippine domestic help.
But skilled Philippine workers play a major role in construc-
tion and operations in the Middle East oil industries, and
the Philippines is recognized as a major source of skilled
nurses all over the globe.
These workers all sought higher wages and better
opportunities abroad. But what would happen to GDP and
wages in the Philippines if they returned? How does emi-
gration affect these two crucial macroeconomic variables?

CHAPTER 7
THE ECONOMY AT FULL EMPLOYMENT
140
I
n this chapter we will explain how the amount of capital and labor helps determine
GDP when the economy is operating at full employment. Although the economy
experiences booms and busts, in the long run it returns to full employment. This
makes full employment an important benchmark, or barometer, of real GDP.
We will see how full employment is determined at any point in time when wages
and prices adjust freely and quickly to changes in demand and supply. It is this flexibil-
ity in wages and prices that allows the economy to operate at full employment. In the
next chapter we will study economic growth when the amount of capital and technol-
ogy evolves over time.
We will develop the model of full employment and use it to examine important
macroeconomic issues and debates, such as the extent to which taxes may depress eco-
nomic activity and lower the level of GDP. We will also learn about real business cycle
theory, a relatively recent school of thought that can help us understand why booms
and busts occur.
WAGE AND PRICE FLEXIBILITY AND FULL
EMPLOYMENT
The economic model of the economy at full employment that we develop in this
chapter assumes wages and prices adjust freely and quickly to changes in demand and
supply. Models that make this assumption are called classical models. The term
classical refers to a school of economics that believed that over a relatively short period
of time wages and prices would adjust quickly and naturally to bring the economy
back to full employment. The classical school of thought dominated economics until
about the mid-1930s.
Following the Great Depression in the 1930s, though, economists began to
change their minds about the classical school. During the Great Depression, unem-
ployment was rampant
nearly 25 percent of the labor force was unemployed
and
economists began to develop models that explained persistent unemployment. In
these models, wages and prices don t always adjust quickly to changes in demand and
supply
which is why booms and busts occur.
Economists today, however, believe that even though wages and prices may be
slow to adjust in the short run, they will respond eventually and restore the economy
to full employment. Thats why it is important to study the full-employment model.
We can use this model to analyze the long-term issues we address in this chapter, such
as the role taxes play in determining the level of GDP and how immigration affects
wages and GDP.
An economy at full employment doesn t mean that there are no unemployed
workers. Recall the distinctions among frictional, structural, and cyclical unemploy-
ment. Frictional unemployment occurs naturally in the labor market as workers
search for jobs. Structural unemployment arises from a mismatch of skills and jobs.
Cyclical unemployment is the part of unemployment that rises and falls with eco-
nomic fluctuations. Cyclical unemployment can be positive, when unemployment
exceeds the natural rate during a recession, or negative, when unemployment is less
than the natural rate during a boom. Full employment means an economy has fric-
tional and structural unemployment but no cyclical unemployment. In other words, at
full employment the economy is experiencing neither a boom nor a bust.
THE PRODUCTION FUNCTION
Recall that a critical part of the circular flow of economic activity is the produc-
tion of total goods and services from the factors of production. The factors of pro-
duction include the labor, natural resources, physical capital, human capital, and

PART 3
entrepreneurship that are the inputs to a technologically based production
process. We ll discuss more of these aspects in the next chapter. In this chapter,
however, we develop the idea of a production function to study how this produc-
tion actually occurs. The production function explains how the total level of out-
put or GDP in the economy is generated from the factors of production.
To simplify our discussion of the economys production function, lets first assume
there are only two factors of production: capital and labor. The stock of capital is all
the machines, equipment, and buildings in the entire economy. Labor consists of the
efforts, both physical and mental, of all the workers in the economy used to produce
goods and services. The production function is written as follows:
where Y is total output, or GDP; K is the stock of capital; and L is the labor force.
(F represents the relationship between the factors of production and output.) What
the math says in words is that we produce total output from both capital and labor.
The production function, F (K, L), is a model that tells us how much output we pro-
duce from the inputs to production, K and L: More inputs of either capital or labor in
an economy lead to increased output.
The stock of capital a society has at any point in time is determined by investments it
has made in new buildings, machines, and equipment in the past. Investments made
today will have little or no immediate effect on the total stock of buildings, machines, and
equipment used in production today, because todays level of investment is typically just a
small fraction of all past investments. Therefore, it takes time for investment to change
the stock of capital. In this chapter, we will assume for most of our discussion that the
stock of capital is fixed at a constant level, which we call K. But we will stray from that
assumption a few times to consider what happens when the stock of capital changes. (We
promise to let you know where we are straying from the assumption of fixed capital.)
With the stock of capital fixed at the constant level K, only variations in the
amount of labor can change the level of output in the economy. Figure 7.1 plots the
relationship between the amount of labor used in an economy and the total level of
output with a fixed stock of capital. Although the stock of capital is fixed, we do vary
the amount of labor employed in production.
Figure 7.1 shows that as we increase labor from L1 to L2, output increases sharply
from Y1 to Y2. However, as more labor is put into production to get us to L3 and Y3,
output does not rise as sharply. With capital fixed, the relationship between output
and labor shown here reflects the principle of diminishing returns.

Suppose we produce output with two or more inputs and we increase one
input while holding the other inputs fixed. Beyond some point
called the
point of diminishing returns
output will increase at a decreasing rate.
To explain what diminishing marginal returns means, look at the data in
Table 7.1 from a typical production function. The table shows the amount of output
we can produce from different amounts of labor inputs while we hold the stock of
capital constant at some amount. (We don t care what amount, as long as it is con-
stant.) First, notice that as the amount of labor increases, so does the amount of out-
put we produce. Second, as output increases, it increases at a diminishing rate. For
example, as labor input increases from 300 to 400 labor units, output increases by
500 output units
from 1,000 to 1,500 output units. But as labor input increases
from 400 to 500 labor units, output increases by only 400 output units
from 1,500
to 1,900 output units. The rate of output dropped from 500 output units per addi-
tional unit of labor to 400 output units per additional unit of labor input. That s
diminishing returns at work.

An Increase in the Stock of Capital
When the capital increases from K1 to
K2, the production function shifts up. At
any level of labor input, the level of out-
put increases.
What happens if the stock of capital increases, say, from K1 to K2? Figure 7.2
shows that when the stock of capital increases, the entire short-run production func-
tion shifts upward. At any level of labor input, we can produce more output than
before we increased the stock of capital. As we add more capital, workers become
more productive and can produce more output. Thats why the production function
curve is higher for more capital. For example, suppose an office has five staff members

who must share one copier. They will inevitably waste some time waiting to use it.
Adding a copier will enable the staff to be more productive.
Capital is one of the key factors of production. As we have seen, the benefits of
additional capital are a higher level of output from any level of labor input.
Throughout the world, countries have increased their level of output by adding to
their stock of capital.
WAGES AND THE DEMAND AND SUPPLY
FOR LABOR
We ve just learned from the production function that with the amount of capital fixed,
the level of output in the economy will be determined exclusively by the amount of
labor employed. Now we ll see how the amount of employment in an economy is
determined by the demand and supply for labor.
On the basis of what you already know about demand and supply from Chapter 4,
you should be able to see what Figure 7.3 represents when it comes to wages and the
demand and supply for labor for the entire economy. The amount of labor firms in the
economy will hire depends on the real wage: the wage rate paid to employees
adjusted for changes in the price level. The real wage tells us what goods and services
workers are able to purchase from their labor and also what it costs, in real terms, for
employers to pay their workers for their services.
As the real-wage rate falls, firms will hire more labor. That is, consistent with the
law of demand, the labor demand curve in Figure 7.3 is downward sloping. In Panel A
we see that as the real wage falls from $20 to $10 per hour, the firm will increase the
amount of its labor from 5,000 to 10,000 workers.
While the labor-demand curve is based on the decisions by firms, the labor-
supply curve is based on the decisions of workers. They must decide how many hours
they want to work and how much leisure they want to enjoy. Although many complex
factors enter into the decision to supply labor, in this chapter we will typically assume
an increase in the real wage will lead to an increase in the quantity of labor supplied in
the market. In Panel B of Figure 7.3 we see that 5,000 people would like to work at
$10 per hour, but $20 per hour motivates 10,000 people to want to work.
Labor Market Equilibrium
Panel C of Figure 7.3 puts the demand and supply curves together. At a wage of
$15 per hour, the amount of labor firms want to hire
7,500 workers
will be equal
to the number of people who want to work
7,500 workers. This is the labor market
equilibrium: The quantity demanded for labor equals the quantity supplied. Together,
the demand and supply curves determine the level of employment in the economy and
7.3

the level of real wages. Now that we have a model of labor market equilibrium, we can
analyze changes in demand and supply for labor.
Changes in Demand and Supply
In deciding how many workers to hire, a firm will compare the marginal benefit from
hiring a worker to the marginal cost. This is an example of the marginal principle.
M A R G I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds
its marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal benefit equals
the marginal cost.
Now lets apply this principle to understanding how a change in the capital stock
affects the demand for labor. When firms increase their capital stock, they find that
each worker becomes more productive with the additional capital. For example, sup-
pose the marginal benefit to the firm of an additional hour of work is initially $15, and
the wage rate is also $15. An increase in the supply of capital raises the marginal ben-
efit to the firm to $20. Firms will want to hire additional workers at the existing wage
of $15 until the marginal benefit again equals the marginal cost.
Because the demand for labor increases at any real wage, the labor-demand curve
shifts to the right. Panel A of Figure 7.4 shows the effects of an increase in labor
demand. The new market equilibrium moves from a to b. Real wages increase, and the
amount of labor employed in the economy increases as well. Having more capital in
the economy is beneficial for workers.
We also can analyze the effect of an increase in the supply of labor that might come,
for example, from immigration. If the population increases, we would expect more peo-
ple would want to work at any given wage. This means the labor-supply curve would shift
to the right. Panel B of Figure 7.4 shows that with an increase in the supply of labor, the
labor market equilibrium moves from a to b. Real wages have fallen, and the amount of
labor employed has increased. Workers who were employed before the increase in labor
supply suffer because real wages have fallen
all wages, including theirs.
Our demand and supply of labor model helps us see why currently employed
workers might be reluctant to favor increased immigration
their wages fall.

PART 3
However, theres a flip side to this. Wages are an input price that firms use in deter-
mining the price of the goods and services they produce. Lower input prices
such as
wages
eventually lead to lower prices for the products workers buy. In other words,
there are trade-offs from immigration for society. Our model also explains why work-
ers would like to see increases in the supply of machines and equipment as long as full
employment can be maintained. The increased supply of capital (which increases
labor productivity) increases labor demand and leads to higher real wages.
Demand and supply for labor can often change at the same time, but by looking at
wages and employment we can determine which effect dominates. Here is an example:
Suppose you were told that in a small European country both wages and employment
increased substantially over a five-year period. As you try to determine what hap-
pened, would you look primarily at factors that increased labor demand or that
increased labor supply?
To answer this question, we would want to examine some factors, such as the
increase in the stock of capital or a change in technology, that would increase labor
demand and both wages and employment. These factors could account for why wages
and employment increased in the small European country. Increases in the supply of
labor (more people in the workforce) would account for the increase in employment,
but not for the increase in wages.
LABOR MARKET EQUILIBRIUM AND FULL
EMPLOYMENT
We can now join the production function and the demand and supply for labor.
Together, they will give us a model that helps us determine how much output the
economy can produce when it is operating at full employment and also help us under-
stand how taxes on employers affect the level of output.
Figure 7.5 brings the model of the labor market together with the short-run pro-
duction function. Panel B depicts equilibrium in the labor market, which we saw in

A P P L I C AT I O N 1
THE BLACK DEATH AND LIVING STANDARDS IN
OLD ENGLAND
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How can changes in the supply of labor
affect real wages?
According to the research of Professor Gregory Clark of the University of California,
Davis, the level of real wages for laborers in England was nearly the same in 1200 as it
was in 1800. Yet, during the period from 1350 to 1550, wages were considerably
higher
nearly 75 percent higher in 1450, for instance, than they were in 1200. Why
were real wages temporarily so high during this period?
The simple answer was the bubonic plague
also known as the Black Death
that arrived from Asia in 1348 and caused a long decline in total population through
the 1450s. With fewer workers, there was less labor supplied to the market. The result
was higher real wages, although less total output.
In the era before consistent and rapid technological advance, changes in popula-
tion was the primary factor controlling living standards. As the economist Thomas
Malthus (1766 1834) observed, social maladies such as the Black Death would tem-
porarily raise living standards until higher living standards led to increased popula-
tion.

Figure 7.3. The demand and supply for labor determine the real-wage rate W and
identify the level of employment L. Panel A plots the short-run production function.
With the level of employment determined at L in Panel B, we move upward to Panel
A and use that level of employment to determine that the level of production is Y.
Full-employment output is the level of output produced when the labor market is in
equilibrium and the economy is producing at full employment. It is also known as
potential output.
Note that full-employment output is based on the idea that the labor market is in
equilibrium, with the quantity of labor supplied equal to the quantity of labor
demanded at the equilibrium wage. Potential output is not the absolute maximum
level of output an economy can produce
an economy could produce more with
higher levels of labor input
but potential output reflects the level of labor input that
workers wish to supply.
How do economists typically measure the level of full-employment output, or
potential output? They start with an estimate of what the unemployment rate would
be if cyclical unemployment were zero
that is, if the only unemployment were due to
frictional or structural factors. In the United States, estimates of the natural rate in
recent years have varied between 5.0 and 6.5 percent. Economists then estimate how
many workers will be employed and use the production function to determine poten-
tial output.
Lets look at some real numbers. In 1996, the unemployment rate was 5.6 percent,
very close to the natural rate of unemployment. The labor force in that year was approx-
imately 133.9 million, and 126.7 million individuals were employed. Real GDP in that
year was $7.8 trillion, measured in 1996 dollars. This level of GDP was produced with

the labor of the 126.7 million employed workers and the existing stock of capital and
technology. Because the unemployment rate in 1996 was close to the natural rate, the
level of real GDP was also very close to the level of potential output in that year.
The level of potential output in an economy increases as the supply of labor
increases or the stock of capital increases. An increase in the supply of labor, perhaps
from more liberal immigration, would shift the labor-supply curve to the right and
lead to a higher level of employment in the economy. With a higher level of employ-
ment, the level of full-employment output will increase. An increase in the stock of
capital will increase the demand for labor. As labor demand increases, the result will
be higher wages and increased employment. Higher employment will again raise the
level of full-employment output.
Potential output depends on both capital and labor. Consequently, differences in
the quantity of labor supplied to the market will affect the level of potential output in
a country. Countries do differ in the amount of labor their workers supply to the mar-
ket. Apart from national holidays, workers in the United States take an average of
12 days of vacation, compared to 28 days in the United Kingdom, 35 days in
Germany, and an amazing 42 days (over eight work weeks) in Italy. These differences
in labor supply are important. Per capita output is higher in the United States than in
Germany but, other things being equal, this difference would disappear if German
workers toiled as much as their U.S. counterparts.
USING THE FULL-EMPLOYMENT MODEL
We use the full-employment model extensively in macroeconomics to analyze a wide
range of issues. For example, many politicians and economists have argued that high
tax rates have hurt the U.S. economy and reduced the level of output and production.
We can use the full-employment model to explore the logic of these claims. We will
also see how to use the model to explain booms and recessions
fluctuations in out-
put. This will allow us to understand the fundamental idea of an influential school of
economic thought known as real business cycle theory.
Taxes and Potential Output
We use the full-employment model in Figure 7.6 to study the effects of taxes employ-
ers pay for hiring labor, such as the taxes they pay for their portion of workers  Social
Security. (Economists use similar arguments to study a variety of taxes, including per-
sonal and corporate income taxes.) A tax on labor will make labor more expensive and
raise the marginal cost of hiring workers. For example, let s say there is no tax on labor
and suddenly a tax of 10 percent is imposed. An employer who had been paying $10 an
hour for workers will now find that labor costs $11 an hour. Because the marginal cost
of hiring workers has gone up but the marginal benefit to the firm has not changed,
employers will respond by hiring fewer workers at any given wage. In Panel A of
Figure 7.6, the labor-demand curve shifts to the left, reflecting the change in demand
due to the tax. As the demand curve shifts to the left, the market equilibrium moves
from a to b. The result is lower real wages and lower employment.
As we have just seen, higher taxes lead to less employment. With reduced employ-
ment, potential output in the economy will be reduced as the economy moves to a
lower level of output on the short-run production function. Higher taxes therefore
lead to lower output. The size of the reduction in output depends critically on the
slope of the labor-supply curve. The slope of the labor-supply curve indicates how
sensitive labor supply is to changes in real wages.
Panel B in Figure 7.6 shows the effect of the same tax with a vertical labor-supply
curve. A vertical labor-supply curve means workers will supply the same amount of
labor regardless of the wage. For example, a single parent might work a full 40 hours
a week regardless of the wage, so the supply curve will be vertical. If, say, other work-
ers in the economy also put in the same hours regardless of the wage, the supply curve

How Employment Taxes Affect Labor Demand and Supply
In Panel A, a tax burden on labor shifts the labor demand curve to the left and leads to lower wages

fall but employment does not change.
for labor in the entire economy will be vertical. In Panel B, we see that with a vertical
supply curve, the change in demand will move the market equilibrium from a to b.
The tax will reduce wages but have no effect on employment and therefore no effect
on output.
This example illustrates that taxes can affect wages and output. In both cases,
either output or wages were lowered when the tax was imposed. However, the extent
of the decline in output depends on the slope of the labor-supply curve. To under-
stand the effects of taxes on output, we need information about the slope of the
labor-supply curve.
Labor supply has been the focus of many studies. The evidence is strong that
part-time workers or second earners in a family are very sensitive to changes in wages
and do vary their labor supply when wages change. There is less of a consensus about
the behavior of primary earners in the family. For many years, economists believed
their labor supply was not very sensitive to changes in compensation. However, recent
research has shown that taxes do matter, even for primary earners.
The entire area of taxation and economics is an active branch of economics
research. Economists such as Martin Feldstein of Harvard University have studied
how many different types of taxes affect employment, saving, and production.
Economists use models to try to measure these effects, just as we did for the employ-
ment tax.
Real Business Cycle Theory
Fluctuations in economic activity can result from a variety of causes. Here are some
examples: A developing country that is highly dependent on agriculture can lose its
cash crop because of a prolonged drought. According to economic historian Stanley
Lebergott, the nineteenth-century U.S. agricultural-based economy was devastated
by grasshopper invasions in North Dakota from 1874 to 1876 and by the boll-weevil
migration from Mexico to Texas in 1892.1 Sharp increases in the price of oil can hurt
economies that use oil in production, as was the case throughout the world in both
1973 and 1979. Wars can devastate entire regions of the world, and natural disasters,
such as earthquakes or floods, can cause sharp reductions in GDP.
Major shifts in technology, which we ll discuss more in the next chapter, can also
cause economic fluctuations. Consider some economic developments, starting with

the early nineteenth century. There were large investments in textile mills and steam
power. The birth of the steel industry and railroads dominated the last half of the cen-
tury. At the end of the nineteenth century, new industries arose that were based on
chemical manufacturing, electricity, and the automobile. It is inconceivable that the
vast changes in technology that led to the creation of these new industries would not
have profound effects on the economy. For example, the invention of the automobile
sounded the death knell for makers of horse-drawn buggies, buggy whips, and a host
of other industries.
Economic fluctuations can also occur because a number of small shocks all hit the
economy at the same time. For example, a case of mad cow disease could cause con-
sumer preferences to change from beef to pork. Or a series of small improvements in
breeding technology could cause output to rise among worldwide producers of cattle.
One school of economic thought, known as real business cycle theory,
emphasizes that shocks to technology can be a major cause of economic fluctuations.
Led by Nobel Laureate economist Edward Prescott, real business cycle economists
have developed newer models that integrate shocks to technology into the full-
employment model we have been discussing.

A NOBEL LAUREATE EXPLAINS WHY EUROPEANS WORK
LESS THAN U.S. WORKERS OR THE JAPANESE
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: Do differences in taxes and government
benefits explain why Europeans work substantially fewer hours per year
than do U.S. workers or the Japanese?
On average today, the French (and other Europeans) work one-third fewer hours than
do U.S. workers. You might be tempted to attribute this difference to Europeans  taste
for leisure or vacations. However, in the early 1970s Europeans actually worked
slightly more hours than did U.S. workers. What explains this dramatic turnaround in
the space of just 20 years?
Nobel Laureate Edward Prescott, professor at Arizona State University and a
senior advisor of the Federal Reserve Bank of Minneapolis, has compared the experi-
ences of the United States and Europe. Prescott attributes the decreases in hours of
work in Europe to increases in the tax burden that ultimately falls on workers.
Government spending and transfers play a larger role in European economies than in
the United States. For example, workers in these countries pay higher taxes, but they
also receive more benefits, such as health care. Transfers in European countries
increased from the 1970s to the 1990s, along with tax burdens during this period.
Taking into account all taxes, Prescott calculated that the effective rate of tax on labor
was 40 percent in the United States, 59 percent in Germany and France, and 64 per-
cent in Italy. Japans tax burden was similar to the United States, and its hours of work
were also similar.
Prescott notes that as our society ages and the burdens of Social Security and
Medicare increase, the United States may be tempted to increase its tax rates to
European levels. Indeed, to maintain the current benefits promised by these pro-
grams, the United States will need to increase tax rates substantially. If we do not
make changes in the underlying programs and allow tax rates to increase, Prescott
warns that we will also see sharp declines in labor supply
and potential output
in
the United States in the future. Living standards would fall as a result.

real business cycle theory
The economic theory that emphasizes
how shocks to technology can cause
fluctuations in economic activity.

The idea behind real business cycle theory is simple: Changes in technology will
usually change the level of full employment or potential output. A significant techno-
logical improvement will enable the economy to increase the level of both actual and
potential output. For example, the advances in technology that allowed computer
users to transfer data-intensive images easily across the Internet created many new
opportunities for businesses to grow and flourish. Adverse technological develop-
ments (or adverse shocks to the economy) will cause output and potential output to
fall. For example, the Internet crashing would bring business communication systems
and ordering systems to a halt.
Figure 7.7 gives a simple example of how the real business cycle theory works.
Suppose an adverse technological shock occurred, decreasing the demand for labor.
The demand curve for labor would shift to the left, and the labor market equilibrium
would move from a to b. The result would be a lower level of employment and lower
real wages. Total GDP would fall because employment is low and because the econ-
omy is less productive than before.
Conversely, a positive technological shock would increase labor demand and
result in both higher wages and higher employment. Total GDP would rise because
employment is high and because the economy is more productive than before.
An economy buffeted by positive and negative technological shocks would experi-
ence economic fluctuations even though it would always be at full-employment out-
put. The key lesson from real business cycle theory is that potential output itself will
vary over time.
The real business cycle school of thought has been influential with some acade-
mic economists, but in its most extreme form it has been viewed as controversial.
Critics find it difficult to understand how many of the post World War II recessions
can be explained by adverse changes in technology. In addition, the real business cycle
model does not provide an explanation of unemployment. In the model the labor mar-
ket is in equilibrium, and the quantity demanded for labor equals the quantity sup-
plied. At the equilibrium wage, the quantity of labor demanded equals the quantity of
labor supplied, and everyone who seeks employment finds employment.
Proponents of the real business cycle model counter that other types of economic
models can explain unemployment and that the real business cycle can still explain
fluctuations in employment. Real business cycle theory is an active area of research,
and both its methods and approach, grounded in firm economic reasoning, have had a
major influence on professional research today. Scholars working in this tradition have

begun to offer modifications of the basic model that can potentially explain major eco-
nomic events.
DIVIDING OUTPUT AMONG COMPETING
DEMANDS FOR GDP AT FULL EMPLOYMENT
Our model of full employment is based entirely on the supply of factors of production
and the state of technology. The demand for and supply of labor determine the real wage
and total employment in the economy. Together, labor and the supply of capital deter-
mine the level of output through the production function. And that means that in a full-
employment economy, total GDP is determined by the supply of factors of production.
Because society faces scarce resources, it must divide full-employment GDP
among competing demands. From Chapters 5 and 6, you know that GDP is composed
of consumption, investment, government purchases, and net exports, which we denote
as C + I + G + NX. In this section, we see how societies divide total spending among
these four components. Because governments, for many different reasons, increase
their level of spending, we would like to know how increased government spending
affects private spending. We will see how increases in government spending must
reduce other types of expenditures when the economy is operating at full employment.

CAN LABOR MARKET POLICIES ACCOUNT FOR THE GREAT
DEPRESSION?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Can real business cycle models explain the
origin and persistence of the Great Depression?
Early critics of real business cycle models claimed that these models could not explain
major events like the Great Depression, and, indeed, there appears to be a puzzle
about the Great Depression. If negative technology shocks were responsible for the
origin and decade-long persistence of the Great Depression, we would expect that the
fall in output would be accompanied by a decline in the real wage, just as in Figure 7.7.
However, real wages actually rose substantially during the 1930s.
Economists Harold L. Cole and Lee E. Ohanian of the University of California,
Los Angeles, extended the standard real business cycle model to include other impor-
tant factors, in particular government interventions that affected the labor market.
For example, President Franklin Roosevelt s New Deal featured the National
Industrial Recovery Act, which allowed firms to collude with one another and avoid
competition as long as they recognized unions and raised wages. Prior to the onset of
the Great Depression, President Herbert Hoover also promoted policies that led
firms to raise wages. Ohanian and Cole show that incorporating these factors into a
standard real business cycle model can explain both the origin and severity of the
Great Depression.
Of course, as we will see in later chapters, many other factors could have added to
the severity of the Great Depression. Banks failed both in the United States and
worldwide and international trade
which had been very vibrant in the 1930s
ground to a halt. Nonetheless, the work of Ohanian and Cole demonstrates that a
modified version of real business cycle models can add to our understanding of this
important episode.

International Comparisons
Countries divide GDP among its four components in very different ways. Table 7.2
presents data on the percent of GDP in alternative uses for five countries in 2008.
Recall that consumption (C), investment (I), and government purchases (G) refer to
total spending by residents of that country. Net exports (NX) is the difference between
exports (sales of goods to foreign residents) and imports (purchases of goods abroad).
If a country has positive net exports
for example, Hong Kong, France, China, and
Germany
it is selling more goods in other countries than it is buying from other
countries. If a country has negative net exports
such as the United States
it is buy-
ing more goods than it is selling to other countries.
Let s make one more point: These data are from the International Financial
Statistics, which is published by the International Monetary Fund. In these statistics,
government purchases include only government consumption, such as military spend-
ing or wages for government employees. Government investment, such as spending
on bridges or roads, is included in the investment category (I).
Table 7.2 reveals considerable diversity among countries. The United States con-
sumes 70 percent of its GDP, a higher fraction than all the other countries. As far as
investment goes, Germany and the United States invest a smaller share of GDP than
the other countries in the table. China invests the most by far
44 percent. Countries
also differ greatly when it comes to government consumption. France has the highest
rate of government consumption, while Hong Kong has the lowest. Finally, the coun-
tries also differ in the size of net exports relative to GDP.
This wide diversity challenges economists to explain these differences. Some econ-
omists have suggested that Chinas high savings rate (low share of consumption) can be
explained by its one-child-per-family policy. They argue that this leads workers to save
more for retirement because they cannot depend on their children to support them.
Other economists attribute the high savings rate to the fact that China provides very
little government-sponsored retirement benefits. In general, differences across coun-
tries are hard to explain. For example, there are no obvious, purely economic reasons
why the United States, France, and Germany should exhibit such different behavior.
Crowding Out in a Closed Economy
We know government spending is part of GDP. Lets say GDP is fixed and the gov-
ernment increases its spending. What happens in a country that increases its govern-
ment purchases within a fixed GDP? Because the level of full-employment output is
given by the supply of factors in the economy, an increase in government spending
must come at the expense of other uses of GDP. Or, stated another way, increased
government spending crowds out other demands for GDP. This is called crowding
out. Crowding out illustrates the principle of opportunity cost:
P R I N C I P L E  O F  O P P O R T U N I T Y  C O S T
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.

crowding out
The reduction in investment (or other
component of GDP) caused by an
increase in government spending.

153
PART 3
At full employment, the opportunity cost of increased government spending is
some other component of GDP.
To understand crowding out, lets first consider what will happen when government
spending increases in an economy without international trade, called a closed economy.
In a closed economy, full-employment output is divided among just three different
demands: consumption, investment, and government purchases. We can write this as
Because we are considering an economy at full employment, the supply of output
(Y) is fixed. Increases in government spending must reduce
that is, crowd out
either consumption or investment. In general, both are affected. On the investment
side, the government will be in increased competition with businesses trying to bor-
row funds from the public to finance its investment plans. This increased competition
from the government will make it more difficult and costly for businesses to make
those investments. As a result, business investment spending will decrease. In other
words, government crowds out investment.
Crowding out occurred in the United States during World War II as the share of
government spending as a part of GDP rose sharply. Figures 7.8 and 7.9 show that at
the same time the share of government spending increased, the shares of consumption
and investment spending in GDP decreased.
Y = C + I + G
output = consumption + investment + government purchases

Increased government spending need not crowd out either consumption or
investment. It could lead to reduced exports and increased imports. Therefore, what
could get crowded out instead is net exports.
Here is how this crowding out might happen: Suppose the U.S. government
began buying domestic goods
for example, computer paper
to use for its offices.
Let s say consumers would have purchased this paper but now cannot. If consumers
want to maintain their same consumption of computer paper despite the fact that the
government now has it, they could purchase domestic computer paper previously
sold abroad (exports) or purchase paper sold by foreign countries (imports). The
result would be a decrease in the amount of paper exported and an increase in
imported paper, that is, a decrease in total net exports. In practice, increases in gov-
ernment spending in an open economy would crowd out consumption, investment,
and net exports.
Crowding in
Governments do not always increase spending. Sometimes they decrease it. When the
government cuts spending and the level of output is fixed, some other type of spend-
ing will increase. We call this crowding in. In a closed economy, consumption or
investment, or both, could increase. In an open economy, net exports could increase as
well. As an example, after a war we might see increases in consumption, investment
spending, or net exports as they replace military spending.
The nature of changes in government spending will have some effect on the type
of spending that is crowded in (or crowded out). If the government spent less on mail
service
leading to longer delays in the mail
businesses and households would most
likely want to spend more on private mail or delivery services. If the government built
more public swimming pools, households would most likely cut back their own spend-
ing on backyard pools.

component of GDP) caused by a decrease

In this chapter, we studied the econ-
omy at full employment. In the model
we developed, the level of GDP is
determined by the supply of the fac-
tors of production
labor, natural
resources, physical capital, human
capital, and entrepreneurship. We
focused on how the economy oper-
ates when it is at full employment. In
later chapters, we consider economic
fluctuations. Here are the main points
from this chapter:
1 Models that assume wages and prices adjust freely to
changes in demand and supply are called classical models.
They are useful to understand how the economy operates at
full employment.
2 Full-employment output, or potential output, is the level of
GDP produced from a given supply of capital when the labor
market is in equilibrium. Potential output is fully determined
by the supply of factors of production in the economy.
3 Increases in the stock of capital raise the level of full-
employment output and real wages.
4 Increases in the supply of labor will raise the level of full-
employment output but lower the level of real wages.
5 The full-employment model has many applications. Many
economists use it to study the effects of taxes on potential
output. Others have found the model useful in understand-
ing economic fluctuations in models of real business cycles.
6 At full employment, increases in government spending must
come at the expense of other components of GDP. In a
closed economy, either consumption or investment must
be crowded out. In an open economy, net exports can be
crowded out as well. Decreases in government spending
will crowd in other types of spending.

Analyzing the Effects of Tax Rate Changes for
Families with Different Incomes. The Tax Reform
Act of 1986 cut the tax rates sharply for high-income

earners. Consider the families in the top 1 percent of all
families ranked in terms of income. Before the law was
passed, a woman in this group faced a marginal tax rate
(the tax rate applied to the last dollar she earned) of
52 percent on average. After the law was passed, the rate
fell to 38 percent. The decreases in tax rates were much
less, however, for families with lower levels of income.
According to a study by Professor Nada Eissa,2 after the
decrease in taxes took effect, the labor supply of women
in the highest income group increased more than that
of women in other income groups. Use a labor demand
and supply model to illustrate the differences between
the high-income group and the other groups.

Tax Revenue and Labor Supply. Tax revenue col-
lected from a payroll tax equals the tax rate times the
earnings of individuals subject to the payroll tax. Lets
say the labor-supply curve is close to vertical. Explain
why, in this case, raising payroll tax rates will increase
the total revenue the government receives from the
payroll tax.

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
For many people, the thought of poverty conjures up
poor, African children. Indeed, Africa is a poor continent,
but as economists Xavier Sali-i-Martin and Maxim
Pinkovskiy have recently shown, prospects are improving.
Since 1995, poverty rates in Africa have been falling
steadily. Indeed, if this trend continues, the rate of poverty
could meet ambitious goals set by the United Nations for
poverty reduction by 2015. Economic growth in Africa has
not come at the expense of the poor. The current income
distribution in Africa is less unequal than it was in 1995, indi-
cating that the growth of income has been shared across the
population. The decline in poverty has been widespread
across the continent. It has fallen in landlocked as well as
coastal countries, mineral-rich and mineral-poor countries,
and in countries with varying degrees of agriculture.
Their results even apply to countries that were particularly
disadvantaged by slavery. The message of these economists
is optimistic: Even countries hindered by geography or his-
tory can still reduce poverty through economic growth.1

O
ur living standards are dramatically different today because of the remarkable
growth in GDP per person. Growth in GDP is perhaps the most critical
aspect of a countrys economic performance. Over long periods, it is the only
way to raise the standard of living in an economy.
This chapter begins by looking at some data from both rich and poor countries
over the last several decades. We will see how GDP per capita (meaning per person
every man, woman, and child) compares over this period. We ll then look at how
growth occurs. Economists believe two basic mechanisms increase GDP per capita
over the long term. One is capital deepening, or increases in an economys stock of
capital (such as buildings and equipment) relative to its workforce. Technological
progress is the other; to economists this means an economy operates more efficiently,
producing more output, but without using any more inputs such as capital or labor.
We ll examine different theories of the origins of technological progress and discuss
how to measure its overall importance for the economy. We ll also discuss in detail the
role of education, experience, and investments in human beings, which are called
human capital.
The appendix to this chapter contains a simple model of capital deepening known
as the Solow model. It shows how increases in capital per worker lead to economic
growth. The model will also allow us to better understand the role of technological
progress in sustaining economic growth.
ECONOMIC GROWTH RATES
Throughout the world there are vast differences in standards of living and in rates of
economic growth. To understand these differences, we first need to look at the con-
cepts and the tools economists use to study economic growth.
But before we learn how to measure growth, lets take a broad overview of what
we mean by economic growth. We can understand economic growth by using one of the
tools we developed in Chapter 2: the production possibilities curve. The production
possibilities curve shows the set of feasible production options for an economy at a
given point of time. In Figure 8.1 we show an economys trade-off when it comes to
producing consumer goods versus military goods. As the economy grows, the entire
production possibilities curve shifts outward. This means the economy can produce

more of both goods
that is what we mean by economic growth. Growth also expands
the amount of goods available for people to consume. Just think about your own fam-
ily. A typical family 40 years ago had only one car, whereas today many families have
two or three. As our chapter-opening story highlights, the economic growth we take
for granted is recent and does not apply evenly across all societies.
Measuring Economic Growth
From earlier chapters we know that real gross domestic product (GDP) measures in
constant prices the total value of final goods and services in a country. Because coun-
tries differ in the size of their populations, we want to know a countrys real GDP per
person, or its real GDP per capita.
Real GDP per capita typically grows over time. A convenient way to describe
the changes in real GDP per capita is with growth rates. The growth rate of a
variable is the percentage change in that variable from one period to another. For
example, to calculate the growth rate of real GDP from year 1 to year 2, suppose
real GDP was 100 in year 1 and 104 in year 2. In this case, the growth rate of real
GDP is
In other words, real GDP grew by 4 percent from year 1 to year 2. This also
means that GDP in year 2 was (1 + 0.04) times GDP in the year 1.
Economies can grow at different rates from one year to the next. But it often is
useful to consider what happens when an economy grows at a constant rate, say g, for
a number of years. Let s start simply. Suppose real GDP for an economy was 100 and
the economy grew at a rate g for two years. How large would the real GDP be two
years later? After one year, GDP would be (1+g) 100. In the second year, it would
grow by (1+g) again, or
We can generalize this to consider the case where the economy grows a constant
rate g for n years. How large would GDP be after n years? A simple formula gives
the answer:
Example: If the economy starts at 100 and grows at a rate of 4 percent a year for
10 years, output (after 10 years) will be
which is nearly 50 percent higher than in the first year.
Heres a rule of thumb to help you understand the power of growth rates. Suppose
you know the growth rate of real GDP, and it is constant, but you want to know how
many years it will take until the level of real GDP doubles. The answer is given by the
rule of 70:
years to double =
70
(percentage growth rate)
GDP [10 year later] = (1 + 0.04)10 (100) = (1.48)(100) = 148
GDP [n years later] = (1 + g)n (100)
GDP [2 years later] = (1 + g)2 (100)
 = 4% per year

Example: For an economy that grew at 5 percent a year, it would take
for real GDP to double. (In case you are curious, the rule of 70 is derived by using the
mathematics of logarithms.)
Comparing the Growth Rates of Various Countries
Making comparisons of real GDP or GNP across countries is difficult. Not only do
countries have their own currencies, but patterns of consumption and prices can
differ sharply among countries. Two examples can illustrate this point. First,
because land is scarce in Japan, people live in smaller spaces than do residents of
the United States, so the price of housing is higher (relative to other goods) than in
the United States. Second, developing countries (such as India or Pakistan) have
very different price structures than developed countries. In particular, in develop-
ing countries goods that are not traded
such as household services or land
are
relatively cheaper than goods that are traded in world markets. In other words,
while all residents of the world may pay the same price for gold jewelry, hiring a
cook or household helper is considerably less expensive in India or Pakistan than in
the United States.
It is important to take these differences into account. Fortunately, a team of
economists led by Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of
Pennsylvania has devoted decades to developing methods for measuring real GNP
across countries. The team s procedures are based on gathering extensive data on
prices of comparable goods in each country and making adjustments for differ-
ences in relative prices and consumption patterns. These methods are now used by
the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund, two prominent interna-
tional organizations.
According to these methods, the country with the highest level of income in 2008
was Luxembourg; its real income per capita was $64,320. Norway, with its oil wealth,
was at $58,500 while the United States was at $46,970.
Table 8.1 lists real Gross National Income (GNI) per capita for 2004 and the
average annual growth rate of GNI per capita between 1960 and 2008 for 11 coun-
tries. (Gross National Income is most commonly used in international comparisons,
while 2008 is the most recent year for which fully consistent data back to 1960 is avail-
able.) The United Kingdom, with a GNI per capita of $36,130, follows the United
States. Not far behind are Japan, France, and Italy. More representative of typical

countries are Mexico and Costa Rica, with GNIs per capita in 2008 of $14,270 and
$10,950, respectively. Costa Rica s GNI per capita is less than 25 percent of per capita
GNI in the United States. Very poor countries have extremely low GNI per capita.
Pakistan, for example, had a GNI per capita of $2,770
less than 6 percent of the
GNI per capita of the United States.
In the third column of Table 8.1, notice the differences in growth rates. Consider
Japan. In 1960, Japan had a GNI per capita that was only one-half that of France and
one-fourth that of the United States. But notice from the third column that Japans
GNI per capita grew on average 4.09 percent per year during the period, compared to
2.38 percent for the United States and 2.91 percent for France. To place Japan s
growth rate for this period into perspective, recall the rule of 70. If an economy grows
at an average annual rate of x percent a year, it takes 70/x years for output to double.
In Japans case, per capita output was doubling every 70/4.09 years, or approximately
every 17 years. At this rate, from the time someone was born to the time he or she
reached the age of 34, living standards would have increased by a factor of four
an
extraordinary rate of growth. The rule of 70 reinforces the importance of small differ-
ences in economic growth rates. A per capita GDP growth rate of 5 percent per year
means that the living standard doubles in 14 years. With only 1 percent growth, dou-
bling would take 70 years.
The differences in per capita incomes between the developed and developing
countries are very large and are also reflected in many different aspects of society. Take,
for example, child labor. In the developed world, we disapprove of child labor and
wonder how we can work toward its elimination. The answer is relatively simple
more economic growth has been shown to lead to less child labor.

A P P L I C AT I O N 1
GLOBAL WARMING, RICH COUNTRIES, AND POOR COUNTRIES
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How may global warming affect
economic growth?
Many people believe that global warming will hurt economic development, but
research shows that the effects are more complex. Recent research by economists
Melissa Dell, Benjamin Jones, and Benjamin Olken provides some useful insights.
First, the effects of increases in temperature seem to be confined to poor countries.
Rich countries do not suffer from increases in temperature. In a study of municipali-
ties within Latin and South America, the economists found that a one-degree Celsius
rise in temperature was associated with between a 1.2 and 1.9 percentage decline in
municipal per capita income. Over time, as economies adapt to higher temperatures
approximately half of this effect disappears. Second, some of the adverse effects from
higher temperatures seem to work through international trade. A one-degree Celsius
increase in temperatures reduces poor countries  exports between 2.0 and 5.7 percent-
age points. The effect appears to be concentrated within the agricultural and light
manufacturing goods sectors.
The fact that poor countries are affected but not rich countries suggests that the
timing of global warming may matter. If global warming can be deferred sufficiently
far into the future, poorer countries will have opportunities to develop and perhaps be
less subject to global warming trends. However, if global warming occurs relatively
soon, then poor countries are likely to be adversely affected.

PART 3
Are Poor Countries Catching Up?
One question economists ask is whether poorer countries can close the gap between
their level of GDP per capita and the GDP per capita of richer countries. Closing this
gap is called convergence. To converge, poorer countries have to grow at more rapid
rates than richer countries. Since 1960, Japan, Italy, and France all have grown more
rapidly than the United States and have narrowed the gap in per capita incomes.
Lets look at some evidence provided by two distinguished international economists,
Maurice Obstfeld of the University of California, Berkeley, and Kenneth Rogoff of
Harvard University. Figure 8.2 plots the average growth rate for 16 currently developed
countries from 1870 to 1979 against the level of per capita income in 1870. Each point
represents a different country. Notice that the countries with the lowest initial per capita
incomes are plotted higher on the graph. That is, they had higher growth rates than the
countries with more income per capita. The downward-sloping line plotted through the
points indicates that the countries with higher levels of per capita income in 1870 grew
more slowly than countries with lower levels. In other words, the tendency was for coun-
tries with lower levels of initial income to grow faster and catch up. The graph shows that
among the currently developed countries
for example, the United States, France, and
the United Kingdom
there was a tendency for convergence over the last century.
Now lets compare the countries that are currently less developed to the advanced
industrial countries using the data in Table 8.1. Here, the picture is not so clear in
recent times. While India grew at a faster rate than the United States, Pakistan grew
only 1.53 percent per year and fell farther behind advanced economies. In Africa,
Zambian GNI per capita grew less than 1 percent. In general, economists who have
studied the process of economic growth in detail find weak evidence that poorer coun-
tries are currently closing the gap in per capita income with richer countries.
Indeed, in the last 20 years there has been little convergence. Economist Stanley
Fischer, governor of the Bank of Israel and formerly with the IMF and the
Massachusetts Institute of Technology, found that, on average, countries with higher
GDP per capita in 1980 grew slightly faster from 1980 to 2000 than countries with
lower GDP per capita.2 African countries, which were among the poorest, grew most
slowly. However, there were some important exceptions: The two most populous coun-
tries, China and India, grew very rapidly. Because these countries contain approximately

35 percent of the worlds population, the good news is that living conditions for many
people around the globe have therefore improved substantially in the last 20 years.
Other commentators are less sanguine. Professor Brad DeLong at UC Berkeley
wrote, Those nations and economies that were relatively rich at the start of the twen-
tieth century have by and large seen their material wealth and prosperity explode.
Those nations and economies that were relatively poor have grown richer, but for the
most part slowly. And the relative gulf between rich and poor economies has grown
steadily. Today this relative gulf is larger than at any time in humanitys previous expe-
rience, or at least larger than at any time since there were some tribes that had discov-
ered how to use fire and other tribes that had not. 3
What about the distribution of income within countries as they develop? Many
economists thought that as countries developed, inequality would increase among
their populations. But recent research challenges this finding.
CAPITAL DEEPENING
One of the most important mechanisms of economic growth economists have identi-
fied is increases in the amount of capital per worker due to capital deepening.
In Chapter 7, we studied the effects of an increase in capital in a full-employment
economy. Figure 8.3 shows the effects on output and real wages. For simplicity, we
assume the supply of labor is not affected by real wages and therefore draw a vertical
line (see Panel B). In Panel A, an increase in capital shifts the production function
upward because more output can be produced from the same amount of labor. In

CHAPTER 8
WHY DO ECONOMIES GROW?
164
A P P L I C AT I O N 2
GROWTH NEED NOT CAUSE INCREASED INEQUALITY
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: Does economic growth necessarily cause
more inequality?
For many years, following the work of Nobel Laureate Simon Kuznets, economists
believed that as a country developed, inequality within it followed an inverted U
pattern
it initially increased and then narrowed over time. However, recent research
by economists Emmanuel Saez of Harvard and Thomas Piketty, a French economist,
challenges the assumption that this phenomenon is solely the result of growth.
Piketty and Saez looked carefully at data in the United States over the twentieth cen-
tury. Inequality
as measured by the income share of the top 10 percent of families
increased from 40 percent at the beginning of the 1920s to 45 percent through the end of
the Great Depression, consistent with Kuznets s theory. But things changed during
World War II. During that time, the share fell to 32 percent by 1944 and remained at that
level until the early 1970s, at which time inequality began to again increase.
Piketty and Saez suggest that wage and price controls during World War II reduced
differentials in wages and salaries and thereby reduced inequality. Moreover, even after the
war these patterns persisted until the 1970s, because society perceived them to be fair.
After the 1970s, salaries at the top of the income distribution increased sharply. (Think of
the vast sums paid to some major league baseball players or corporate executives.) These
findings, as well as related results from other countries, suggest that inequality does not
naturally accompany economic development. Social norms and other factors, such as per-
ceived fairness of compensation and the nature of the tax system, also play a role in gener-
ating inequality. Moreover, the U.S. experience suggests these norms can change over
time, even within the same country, regardless of growth rates.

PART 3
addition, firms increase their demand for labor because the marginal benefit from
employing labor will increase. Panel B shows how the increase in capital raises the
demand for labor and increases real wages. That is, as firms increase their demand
and compete for a fixed supply of labor, they will bid up real wages in the economy.
An economy is better off with an increase in the stock of capital. With additions
to the stock of capital, workers will enjoy higher wages, and total GDP in the econ-
omy will increase. Workers are more productive because each worker has more cap-
ital at his or her disposal. But how does an economy increase its stock of capital per
worker? The answer is with saving and investment, which we ll discuss next.
Saving and Investment
Lets begin with the simplest case: an economy with a constant population, producing
at full employment. This particular economy has no government or foreign sector. Its
output can be purchased only by consumers or by firms. In other words, output con-
sists solely of consumption (C) and investment (I). At the same time, output generates
an amount of income equivalent to the amount of output. That is, output (Y ) equals
income. Any income that is not consumed we call saving.
In this economy, saving must equal investment. Here s why: By definition, con-
sumption plus saving equals income:

Increase in the Supply of Capital
An increase in the supply of capital will

shown in Panel A, and increase the
demand for labor, as shown in Panel B.
Real wages will increase from W1 to W2,
and potential output will increase from
Y1 to Y2.

Income that is not consumed.

but at the same time income
which is equivalent to output
also equals consump-
tion plus investment:
Thus, saving must equal investment:
This means that whatever consumers decide to save goes directly into investment.
Here is a simple way to remember this idea: A farmer produces corn (Y ) and can
either consume it directly (C) or set it aside as seed corn  (I) for next year. The part
the farmer sets aside and does not consume is also the farmer s saving (S).
Next, we need to link the level of investment in the economy to the stock of cap-
ital in the economy. The stock of capital depends on two factors: investment and
depreciation. The stock of capital increases with any gross investment spending but
decreases with depreciation. Why does depreciation decrease the stock of capital? The
answer is simple: As capital stock items such as buildings and equipment get older
(depreciate), they wear out and become less productive. New investment is needed to
replace the buildings and equipment that become obsolete.
Suppose, for example, the stock of capital at the beginning of the year is $10,000.
During the year, if there were $1,000 in gross investment and $400 in depreciation,
the capital stock at the end of the year would be $10,600 (= $10,000 + $1000  $400).
It may be helpful to picture a bathtub. The level of water in the bathtub (the stock
of capital) depends on the flow of water into the bathtub through the input faucet
(gross investment) minus the flow of water out of the bathtub down the drain (depre-
ciation). As long as the flow in exceeds the flow out, the water level in the bathtub (the
stock of capital) will increase.
Higher saving, which leads to higher gross investment, will therefore tend to
increase the stock of capital available for production. As the stock of capital grows,
however, there typically will be more depreciation, because there is more capital
(building and equipment) to depreciate. It is the difference between gross investment
and depreciation
net investment
that ultimately determines the change in the stock
of capital for the economy, the level of real wages, and output. In our example, net
investment is $1,000  $400 = $600.
How Do Population Growth, Government, and Trade Affect
Capital Deepening?
So far, we ve considered the simplest economy. Lets consider a more realistic econ-
omy that includes population growth, a government, and trade.
First, consider the effects of population growth: A larger labor force will allow
the economy to produce more total output. However, with a fixed amount of capi-
tal and an increasing labor force, the amount of capital per worker will be less.
With less capital per worker, output per worker will also be less, because each
worker has fewer machines to use. This is an illustration of the principle of dimin-
ishing returns.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  D I M I N I S H I N G  R E T U R N S
Suppose that output is produced with two or more inputs and that we
increase one input while holding the other inputs fixed. Beyond some
point
called the point of diminishing returns
output will increase at a
decreasing rate.

C + I = Y

PART 3
Consider India, the world s second most populous country, with over a billion
people. Although India has a large labor force, its amount of capital per worker is
low. With sharp diminishing returns to labor, per capita output in India is low, only
$2,960 per person.
The government can affect the process of capital deepening in several ways through
its policies of spending and taxation. Suppose the government taxed its citizens so that
it could fight a war, pay its legislators higher salaries, or give foreign aid to needy
countries
in other words, to engage in government consumption spending. The higher
taxes will reduce total income. If consumers save a fixed fraction of their income, total
private savings (savings from the nongovernmental sector) will fall. This taxation drains
the private sector of savings that would have been used for capital deepening.
Now suppose the government took all the extra tax revenues and invested them in
valuable infrastructure, such as roads, buildings, and airports. These infrastructure
investments add to the capital stock. We illustrate this idea in Figure 8.4. If consumers
were saving 20 percent of their incomes and the government collected $100 in taxes
from each taxpayer, private saving and investment would fall by $20 per taxpayer, but
government investment in the infrastructure would increase by a full $100 per taxpayer.
In other words, the government forces  consumers (by taxing them) to invest an addi-
tional $80 in infrastructure that they otherwise wouldn t invest. The net result is an
increase in total social investment (private plus government) of $80 per taxpayer.
Finally, the foreign sector can affect capital deepening. The United States,
Canada, and Australia built their vast railroad systems in the nineteenth century by
running trade deficits
selling fewer goods and services to the rest of the world than
they were buying
and financing this gap by borrowing. This enabled them to pur-
chase the large amount of capital needed to build their rail networks and grow at more
rapid rates by deepening capital. Eventually, these economies had to pay back the
funds they had borrowed from abroad by running trade surpluses
selling more goods
and services to the rest of the world than they were buying from abroad. But because
economic growth had increased their GDP and wealth, the three countries were able
to afford to pay back the borrowed funds. Therefore, this approach to financing deep-
ening capital was a reasonable strategy for them to pursue.
Not all trade deficits promote capital deepening, however. Suppose a country
runs a trade deficit because it wants to buy more consumer goods. The country would
be borrowing from abroad, but there would be no additional capital deepening
just
additional consumption spending. When the country is forced to pay back the funds,
there will be no additional GDP to help foot the bill. In order to fund current con-
sumption, the country will be poorer in the future.

THE KEY ROLE OF TECHNOLOGICAL
PROGRESS
The other mechanism affecting economic growth is technological progress. Economists
use the term technological progress in a very specific way: It means an economy operates
more efficiently by producing more output without using any more inputs.
In practice, technological progress can take many forms. The invention of the
lightbulb made it possible to read and work indoors at night, the invention of the ther-
mometer assisted doctors and nurses in their diagnoses, and the invention of dispos-
able diapers made life easier at home. All these examples
and you could provide
many more
enable society to produce more output without more labor or more cap-
ital. With higher output per person, we enjoy a higher standard of living.
We can think of technological progress as the birth of new ideas. These new
ideas enable us to rearrange our economic affairs and become more productive. Not
all technological innovations are necessarily major scientific breakthroughs; some are
much more basic. An employee of a soft-drink company who discovers a new and
popular flavor for a soft drink is engaged in technological progress, just like scientists
and engineers. Even simple, commonsense ideas from workers or managers can help
a business use its capital and labor more efficiently to deliver a better product to con-
sumers at a lower price. For example, a store manager may decide that rearranging
the layout of merchandise and location of cash registers helps customers find prod-
ucts and pay for them more quickly and easily. This change is also technological
progress. As long as there are new ideas, inventions, and new ways of doing things,
the economy can become more productive and per capita output can increase.
How Do We Measure Technological Progress?
If someone asked you how much of the increase in your standard of living was due to
technological progress, how would you answer? Robert Solow, a Nobel Laureate in
economics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, developed a method for
measuring technological progress in an economy. Like most good ideas, his theory
was simple. It was based on the idea of a production function.
You know from Chapter 7 that the production function links inputs to outputs:
where output (Y) is produced from capital (K) and labor (L), which are linked through
the production function (F). What Solow did was include in the production function
some measure of technological progress, A:
Increases in A represent technological progress. Higher values of A mean that more
output is produced from the same level of inputs K and L. If we could find some way
to measure A, we could estimate how much technological progress affects output.
Solow noted that over any period we can observe increases in capital, labor and
output. Using these we can measure technological progress indirectly. We first ask
how much of the change in output can be explained by contributions from increases in
the amount of capital and labor used. Whatever growth we cannot explain in this way
must therefore be caused by technological progress. The method Solow developed to
measure the contributions to economic growth from capital, labor, and technological
progress is called growth accounting.
Figure 8.5 illustrates the relative contributions of these growth sources for the
U.S. economy from 1929 to 1982 using growth accounting, based on a classic study by
the economist Edward Denison. During this period, total output grew at a rate of
nearly 3 percent. Because capital and labor growth are measured at 0.56 and 1.34 per-
cent per year, respectively, the remaining portion of output growth, 1.02 percent per

year, must be due to technological progress. That means approximately 35 percent of
output growth came directly from technological progress.
Other recent estimates give a similar picture of the contribution of technological
progress to economic growth. For example, the Bureau of Labor Statistics estimates
that between 1987 and 2007 technological progress accounted for 1.0 percentage
points of economic growth in the private nonfarm business sector, very similar to
Denisons estimates.

SOURCES OF GROWTH IN CHINA AND INDIA
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: How can we use economic analysis to
understand the sources of growth in different countries?
China and India are the two most populous countries in the world and have also
grown very rapidly in recent years. From 1978 to 2004, GDP in China grew at the
astounding rate of 9.3 percent per year while India s GDP grew at a lower but still
robust rate of 5.4 percent per year. What were the sources of this growth? Economists
Barry Bosworth from the Brookings Institution and Susan Collins from the
University of Michigan used growth accounting to answer this question.
Employment in China and India both grew at 2 percent per year over the period,
so the remaining differences must be attributed to capital deepening and technologi-
cal progress. Bosworth and Collins in turn broke capital deepening into two parts:
increases in physical capital (buildings, machines, and equipment) and increases in
human capital (the knowledge of workers, as measured by their educational attain-
ment). Their analysis revealed that China s more rapid growth was primarily caused
by more rapid accumulation of physical capital and more rapid technological progress.
The contributions from human capital for each country were similar. Why did China
grow faster than India over this 26-year period? Simply put, China invested much
more than India in physical capital and was able to increase its technological progress
at a more rapid rate.
Looking ahead, Bosworth and Collins find no evidence that growth in China and
India is slowing. Capital formation and technological progress is still rapid in both
countries and India has even improved its rate of technological advance in recent
years. Despite this rapid growth and pockets of wealth in major cities, both countries
are still poor: Chinese GNP per capita is only 15 percent and India s GDP is only
8 percent of U.S. GNP per capita. But at these growth rates, the gap will diminish in
the coming decades.

GROWTH ACCOUNTING AND INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: How much did the information revolution
contribute to U.S. productivity growth?
In analyses of the sources of economic growth, a common statistic reported about the
U.S. economy is labor productivity. Defined as output per hour of work, labor pro-
ductivity is a simple measure of how much a typical worker can produce given the
amount of capital in the economy and the state of technological progress. From 1973
to 1993, the growth of labor productivity slowed in the United States. Figure 8.6
shows U.S. productivity growth for different periods since 1959.
The figure shows that productivity growth was extremely high during the 1960s.
It slowed a bit in the late 1960s, and then slowed dramatically after the oil shocks in
the 1970s. In recent years, productivity growth has increased, reaching 2.5 percent
from 1994 to 2007.
As the figure shows, U.S. productivity growth did climb in the last half of the
1990s. Some observers believe the computer and Internet revolution are responsible
for the increase in productivity growth. Skeptics wonder, however, whether this
increase in productivity growth is truly permanent or just temporary. Higher invest-
ment in computer technology began in the mid-1980s, but until recently there was lit-
tle sign of increased productivity growth. Had the investment in information
technology finally paid off? And would it continue?
Robert J. Gordon of Northwestern University used growth accounting methods to
shed light on this issue. After making adjustments for the low unemployment rate and
high GDP growth rate in the late 1990s, he found there had been increases in techno-
logical progress. In earlier work, Gordon had found these increases were largely con-
fined to the durable goods manufacturing industry, including the production of
computers themselves. Because the increase in technological progress was confined to
a relatively small portion of the economy, Gordon was originally skeptical that we were

Using Growth Accounting
Growth accounting is a useful tool for understanding different aspects of economic
growth. As an example, economic growth slowed throughout the entire world during
the 1970s. Using growth accounting methods, economists typically found the slow-
down could not be attributed to changes in the quality or quantity of labor inputs or
to capital deepening. Either a slowdown in technological progress or other factors
not directly included in the analysis, such as higher worldwide energy prices, must
have been responsible. This led economists to suspect that higher energy prices were
the primary explanation for the reduction in economic growth.

The first compares growth in China and India, the second explores how the Internet
and information technology have affected U.S. GDP.
WHAT CAUSES TECHNOLOGICAL PROGRESS?
Because technological progress is an important source of growth, we want to know how
it occurs and what government policies can do to promote it. Economists have identified
a variety of factors that may influence the pace of technological progress in an economy.
Research and Development Funding
One way for a country to induce more technological progress in its economy is to pay
for it. If the government or large firms employ workers and scientists to advance the
frontiers of knowledge in basic sciences, their work can lead to technological
progress in the long run. Figure 8.7 presents data on the spending on research and
development as a percent of GDP for seven major countries for 1999. The United
States has the highest number of scientists and engineers in the world. However,
although it spends the most money overall, as a percent of GDP the United States

now operating in a new economy  with permanently higher productivity growth.
However, in subsequent studies he found that productivity growth had spread to other
sectors of the economy, such as retail sales and financial institutions.
But will this contribution from information technology to labor productivity
growth last? Professor Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University and his co-authors
looked carefully at the contributions of information technology to labor productivity
in recent years. They examined the effects of information technology on labor pro-
ductivity growth, both through increased investment or capital deepening in that sec-
tor and also through its impact on technological progress. They found that from 2000
to 2006, labor productivity had continued to grow at rates like those in the late 1990s,
but the contribution the information technology sector made to this growth had
decreased. This naturally raises questions as to whether productivity growth will con-
tinue to be robust in future decades.

spends less than Japan. Moreover, a big part of U.S. spending on research and devel-
opment is in defense-related areas, unlike in Japan. Some economists believe
defense-related research and development is less likely to lead to long-run techno-
logical change than nondefense spending; however, many important technological
developments, including the Internet, partly resulted from military-sponsored
research and development.
Monopolies That Spur Innovation
The radical notion that monopolies spur innovation was put forth by economist
Joseph Schumpeter. In Schumpeter s view, a firm will try to innovate
that is, come
up with new products and more efficient ways to produce existing products
only if it
reaps a reward. The reward a firm seeks from its innovations is high profit, and it can
obtain a high profit if it is the sole seller, or monopolist, for the product. Other firms
will try to break the firms monopoly through more innovation, a process Schumpeter
called creative destruction. Schumpeter believed that by allowing firms to compete
to become monopolies, society benefits from increased innovation.
Governments do allow temporary monopolies for new ideas by issuing patents. A
patent allows the inventor of a product to have a monopoly until the term of the patent
expires, which in the United States is now 20 years. With a patent, we tolerate some
monopoly power (the power to raise prices that comes with limited competition) in
the hope of spurring innovation.
An idea related to patents that is becoming increasingly important is the need to
protect intellectual property rights. Information technology has made possible the
free flow of products and ideas around the world. Publishers of both books and
computer software face problems of unauthorized copying, particularly in some
developing countries. While residents of those countries clearly benefit from inex-
pensively copied books or software, producers in the developed countries then face
reduced incentives to enter the market. Even in the United States, pirated music and
movies pose a threat to the viability of the entertainment industry. Large and prof-
itable firms may continue to produce despite unauthorized copying, but other firms
may be discouraged. The United States has put piracy and unauthorized reproduc-
tion among its top agenda items in recent trade talks with several countries.
The Scale of the Market
Adam Smith stressed that the size of a market was important for economic develop-
ment. In larger markets, firms have more incentives to come up with new products
and new methods of production. Just as Schumpeter suggested, the lure of profits
guides the activities of firms, and larger markets provide firms the opportunity to
make larger profits. This supplies another rationale for free trade. With free trade,
markets are larger, and there is more incentive to engage in technological progress.
Induced Innovations
Some economists have emphasized that innovations come about through inventive
activity designed specifically to reduce costs. This is known as induced innovation. For
example, during the nineteenth century in the United States, the largest single cost in
agriculture was wages. Ingenious farmers and inventors came up with many different
machines and methods to cut back on the amount of labor required.
Education, Human Capital, and the Accumulation of Knowledge
Education can contribute to economic growth in two ways. First, the increased knowl-
edge and skills of people complement our current investments in physical capital.
Second, education can enable the workforce in an economy to use its skills to develop
new ideas or to copy ideas or import them from abroad. Consider a developing country

today. In principle, it has at its disposal the vast accumulated knowledge of the devel-
oped economies. But using this knowledge probably requires a skilled workforce
one
reason why many developing countries send their best students to educational institu-
tions in developed countries.
Increasing knowledge and skills are part of human capital
an investment in
human beings. Human capital is as important, maybe even more important, than
physical capital. Many economists, including Nobel Laureate Gary Becker of the
University of Chicago, have studied human capital in detail.
A classic example of human capital is the investment a student makes to attend col-
lege. The costs of attending college consist of the direct out-of-pocket costs (tuition and
fees) plus the opportunity costs of forgone earnings while at school. The benefits of
attending college are the higher wages and more interesting jobs offered to college grad-
uates compared to high-school graduates. Individuals decide to attend college when these
benefits exceed the costs, and it is a rational economic decision. A similar calculation faces
a newly graduated doctor who must decide whether to pursue a specialty. Will the for-
gone earnings of a general physician (which are quite substantial) be worth the time spent
learning a specialty that will eventually result in extra income? We can analyze invest-
ments in health and nutrition within the same framework. The benefits of regular exer-
cise and watching your weight are a healthier lifestyle and higher energy level.
Human capital theory has two implications for understanding economic growth.
First, not all labor is equal. When economists measure the labor input in a country, they
must adjust for differing levels of education. These levels of education reflect past
investments in education and skills; individuals with higher educational levels will, on
average, be more productive. Second, health and fitness also affect productivity. In
developing countries, economists have found a strong correlation between the height of
individuals (reflecting their health) and the wages they can earn in the farming sector.

THE ROLE OF POLITICAL FACTORS IN ECONOMIC GROWTH
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #5: How do varying political institutions affect
economic growth?
Economist Daron Acemoglu of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology has written
extensively about the role of political institutions and economic growth. Acemoglu distin-
guishes broadly between two types of political institutions: authoritarian institutions, such
as monarchies, dictatorships, or tightly controlled oligarchies, and participatory institu-
tions, such as constitutionally limited monarchies and democracies. History has witnessed
growth under both types of regimes. At various points in time, China, Spain, Turkey and
ancient Greece and Rome all exhibited technological innovation and economic growth.
But transformative economic growth, such as the world witnessed with the
Industrial Revolution that began in western Europe in the late 1700s, typically
requires more participatory institutions. The key reason is that sustained technologi-
cal progress is disruptive and authoritarian regimes have difficulty coping with all the
subsequent changes. Acemoglu highlights the fall in the old, authoritarian regimes in
Europe and the rise of constitutional or limited monarchies that set the preconditions
for the birth of the Industrial Revolution.
Acemoglu s theory does raise important questions for today. Can China, with its
authoritarian political culture, continue to grow without eventual political transfor-
mation? If that does eventually come, can it be absorbed peacefully within the society?

CULTURE, EVOLUTION, AND ECONOMIC GROWTH
APPLYING THE CONCEPT #6: Did culture or evolution spark the Industrial
Revolution?
In studying the economic history of England before the Industrial Revolution, Professor
Gregory Clark discovered an interesting fact. Examining archival data on wills and estates,
he found that children of the more affluent members of English society were more likely
to survive than those of the less affluent. Coupled with the slow growth of population over
several centuries, this differential survival of the wealthy had the effect of creating down-
ward mobility for the rich, as their sons and daughters increasingly populated the society.
According to Professor Clark, this change had profound effects on English soci-
ety. The cultural habits of the rich filtered through the entire society. Social virtues
such as thrift, prudence, and hard work became more commonplace, while impulsive
and violent behaviors were reduced. Eventually, these changes in culture became suf-
ficiently pronounced that a qualitative change took place in society. Individuals now
were able to take advantage of new developments in science and technology and
embrace new technologies and social change.
Economists Oded Galor and Omer Moav suggest that development can be viewed
in more traditional evolutionary terms. They argue that at some point during the
human evolutionary process, families that had fewer children but invested more in
them, gained a competitive advantage in the evolutionary cycle. The offspring of these
families had more human capital and more easily adapted to technological progress and
the other changes that were taking place in societies. Human genetic evolution, in their
view, set the stage for the Industrial Revolution. Both views share some similarities.
According to Clark, the evolution was primarily cultural, whereas for Galor and Moav
it was genetic. In both cases, however, humans transformed themselves as the Industrial
Revolution began.
Related to Exercise 4.10.

and Omer Moav, Natural Selection and the Origin of Economic Growth,  Quarterly Journal of Economics (November
2002): 1133 1191.
Human capital theory can also serve as a basis for important public policy decisions.
Should a developing country invest in capital (either public or private) or in education?
The poorest developing countries lack good sanitation systems, effective transportation,
and capital investment for agriculture and industry. However, the best use of investment
funds may not be for bridges, sewer systems, and roads, but for human capital and educa-
tion. Studies demonstrate that the returns from investing in education are extremely high
in developing countries. The gains from elementary and secondary education, in particu-
lar, often exceed the gains from more conventional investments. In developing countries,
an extra year in school can often raise individuals  wages by 15 to 20 percent a year.
New Growth Theory
For many years, economists who studied technological progress typically did so inde-
pendently of economists who studied models of economic growth. But starting in the
mid-1980s, several economists, including Nobel Laureate Robert E. Lucas of the
University of Chicago and Paul Romer of Stanford University, began to develop mod-
els of growth that contained technological progress as essential features. Their work
helped to initiate what is known as new growth theory, which accounts for techno-
logical progress within a model of economic growth.
In this field, economists study, for example, how incentives for research and develop-
ment, new product development, or international trade interact with the accumulation of

progress.

PART 3
physical capital. New growth theory enables economists to address policy issues, such as
whether subsidies for research and development are socially justified and whether policies
that place fewer taxes on income earned from investment will spur economic growth or
increase economic welfare. Current research in economic growth now takes place within a
broad framework that includes explanations of technological progress. As an example, new
growth theory suggests that investment in comprehensive education in a developing coun-
try will lead to permanent increases in the rate of technological progress as the workforce
will be better able to incorporate new ideas and technologies into the workplace.
Some researchers also suggest the type of education might also matter for techno-
logical innovation. Phillipe Aghion of Harvard University and Peter Howitt of Brown
University make the case that when a country is far behind the worlds technological
frontier, it is best for that country to invest in relatively basic education so that the
workforce can essentially copy the changes that are occurring in the more advanced
economies. But once an economy reaches the world s technological frontier, invest-
ment in the most advanced higher education might be most advantageous.4
New growth theory suggests that any social factor influencing the willingness of
individuals to pursue technological advancement will be a key to understanding eco-
nomic growth. Can cultural factors also play a role? The historical sociologist Max
Weber argued that changes in religious beliefs could help us understand growth, as he
emphasized how the rise of Protestantism, with its emphasis on the individual, set the
stage for the Industrial Revolution in Europe. This thesis has always been controver-
sial because the links between changes in religious beliefs and changes in economic or
other behaviors are not well understood. More recently, Professor Gregory Clark has
emphasized how the growth of middle-class values in England could possibly explain
why the Industrial Revolution began there.
A KEY GOVERNMENTAL ROLE: PROVIDING THE
CORRECT INCENTIVES AND PROPERTY RIGHTS
As we discussed in Chapter 3, governments play a critical role in a market economy.
They must enforce the rules of the market economy, using police powers to ensure that
contracts are upheld, individual property rights are enforced, and firms can enter safely
into economic transactions. Although we may take these features of our economy for
granted, not all countries enjoy the benefits of clear enforcement of property rights.
What is the connection between property rights and economic growth? Without
clear property rights, there are no proper incentives to invest in the future
the
essence of economic growth. Suppose, for example, that you lived on land that needed
costly improvements in order to be made valuable. You might be willing to make the
investment in these improvements if you were sure you would gain the economic ben-
efits from making them. But suppose there was a risk someone else would reap the
benefits
in that case, you would not have incentive to invest.
Clear property rights are, unfortunately, lacking in many developing countries
throughout the world. As many economists have argued, their absence has severely
impeded the growth of these economies.
Governments also have a broader role in designing the institutions in which indi-
viduals and firms work, save, and invest. Economists have increasingly recognized the
importance of these institutions in determining economic growth. For example, the
residents of Hong Kong link their rapid economic growth to free and open institutions
that provide the right incentives for technological innovations. They wanted to pre-
serve these institutions after they officially became part of China in 1997 and have
indeed been successful in maintaining an open society.
But for many countries, growth has been more elusive. For many years, interna-
tional organizations such as the World Bank
a consortium of countries created to
promote development
have tried a variety of diverse methods to assist developing
countries. These have included increases in foreign aid, infusions of new machinery,
promotion of universal education, and efforts to stem population growth. Despite
8.5

these efforts, some areas of the world, such as sub-Saharan Africa, have failed to
grow at all.
William Easterly, a former World Bank economist, believes the World Bank and
other international organizations have failed to take into account one of the basic laws
of economics: Individuals and firms respond to incentives. According to Easterly, gov-
ernments in developing countries have failed to provide the proper economic environ-
ment that would motivate individuals and firms to take actions that promote economic
development.5 As an example, providing free schooling is not enough
individuals
need to know their investments in education will pay off in the future in terms of
higher incomes or better jobs. Without the prospect that it will lead to an improve-
ment in their lives, individuals will not make the effort to obtain an education.
What else can go wrong? Governments in developing countries often adopt poli-
cies that effectively tax exports, pursue policies that lead to rampant inflation, and
enforce laws that inhibit the growth of the banking and financial sectors. The results
are predictable: fewer exports, an uncertain financial environment, and reduced saving
and investment. All these outcomes can cripple an economy s growth prospects.
Sometimes they are based on bad economic advice. Other times, racial or ethnic
groups in polarized societies use the economic system to take advantage of their rivals.
What can be done? In Easterly s view, the World Bank and other international
organizations need to stop searching for the magic bullet for development. Instead,
they should hold governments responsible for creating the proper economic environ-
ment. With the right incentives, Easterly believes individuals and firms in developing
countries will take actions that promote economic growth.
CHAPTER 8
WHY DO ECONOMIES GROW?

A P P L I C AT I O N 7
LACK OF PROPERTY RIGHTS HINDERS GROWTH IN PERU
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #7: Why are clear property rights important for
economic growth in developing countries?
On the hills surrounding Lima, Peru, and many other South American cities, large
numbers of residents live in urban slums, many having taken over these lands through
urban invasions.  Many families have resided in these dwellings for a long time, and
most have basic water, sewage, and electricity. But what they don t have is clear titles
to their properties.
Hernando DeSoto, a Peruvian economist and author of The Mystery of Capital, has
studied the consequences of informal ownership  in detail. He argues that through-
out the developing world, property is often held without clear title. Without this evi-
dence of ownership, people are not willing to make long-term investments to improve
their lives. But there are other important consequences as well.
Economists recognize that strong credit systems
the ability to borrow and lend
easily
are critical to the health of developing economies. But without clear title, peo-
ple cannot use property as collateral (or security) for loans. As a consequence, the poor
may in fact be living on very valuable land, but are unable to borrow against that land
to start a new business. Also, the types of investments made will depend on the avail-
ability of credit. DeSoto observed that producing palm oil in Peru is very profitable,
but it takes time and depends upon the ability to borrow funds. Production of coca
paste
an ingredient of cocaine
does not take as much time and does not depend on
finance. It is also a plague on the developed world. Switching farmers away from pro-
duction of coca paste to palm oil requires improvements in finance, which are very dif-
ficult without clear property rights.
Related to Exercise 5.7.

In this chapter, we explored
the mechanisms of economic
growth. Although economists
do not have a complete under-
standing of what leads to
growth, they regard increases in
capital per worker, technologi-
cal progress, human capital,
and governmental institutions as key factors. Here are the main
points to remember:
1 Per capita GDP varies greatly throughout the world. There is
debate about whether poorer countries in the world are con-
verging in per capita incomes to richer countries.
2 Economies grow through two basic mechanisms: capital
deepening and technological progress. Capital deepening is
an increase in capital per worker. Technological progress is
an increase in output with no additional increases in inputs.
3 Ongoing technological progress will lead to sustained eco-
nomic growth.
4 Various theories try to explain the origins of technological
progress and determine how we can promote it. They
include spending on research and development, creative
destruction, the scale of the market, induced inventions, and
education and the accumulation of knowledge, including
investments in human capital.
5 Governments can play a key role in designing institutions
that promote economic growth, including providing secure
property rights.

Economic Growth Rates
1.1
To gauge living standards across countries with popu-
lations of different sizes, economists use 
.
1.2
In poor countries, the relative prices for nontraded
goods (such as household services) to traded goods (such
as jewelry) are
than in rich countries.
1.3
Economists who have studied economic growth find
strong evidence for convergence among European
counties since 1890. 
(True/False)
1.4
At a 2 percent annual growth rate in GDP per
capita, it will take
years for GDP per
capita to double.
1.5
Future Generations. Some economists say that eco-
nomic growth involves a trade-off between current
generations and future generations. If a current gener-
ation raises its saving rate, what does it sacrifice? What
will be gained for future generations?
1.6
Will the Poorer Country Catch Up? Suppose one
country has a GDP that is one-eighth the GDP of its
richer neighbor. But the poorer country grows at
10 percent a year, while the richer country grows at
2 percent a year. In 35 years, which country will have a
higher GDP? (Hint: Use the rule of 70.)
8.1
1.7
Understanding Convergence in a Figure. Suppose
the line in Figure 8.2 was horizontal. What would that
tell us about economic convergence?
1.8
Growth in Per Capita GDP. The growth rate of real
GDP per capita equals the growth rate of real GDP
minus the growth rate of the population. If the growth
rate of the population is 1 percent per year, how fast
must real GDP grow for real GDP per capita to dou-
ble in 14 years?
1.9
Economic Growth and Global Warning. Basing
your answer on the research reported in the text, is it
likely that India is more vulnerable now to increases in
temperatures than it will be in 20 years? (Related to
Application 1 on page 162.)
1.10 Economic 
Growth, 
World 
Markets 
for
Entertainment, and Inequality. With worldwide
economic growth, markets are much larger, so movies
and music have much larger audiences. Could this lead
to increased inequality for entertainers? Discuss.

per capita of France and Japan from 1950 to 2000. Do
the data support the theory of convergence for these
two countries?
Capital Deepening
2.1
In an economy with no government sector or foreign
sector, saving must equal investment because
a. total demand is equal to consumption and
investment.
b. total income is equal to consumption and saving.
c. total income is equal to total demand.
d. All of the above
e. None of the above
2.2
If everything else is held equal, a decrease in the size of
the population will 
total output and
per capita output.
2.3
If the private sector saves 10 percent of its income and
the government raises taxes by $200 to finance public
investments, total investment
private and public
investment
will increase by 
.
2.4
If a country runs a trade surplus to finance increased
current consumption, it will have to reduce consump-
tion in the future to pay back its borrowings.
(True/False)
2.5
Policies That Promote Capital Deepening. Which
of the following will promote economic growth
through capital deepening?
a. Higher taxes used to finance universal health care
b. Increased imports to purchase new DVD players
for consumers
c. Increased imports to purchase supercomputers
for industry
2.6
Diminishing Returns to Capital and Real Wages. 
Explain why this statement is wrong: Since capital is
subject to diminishing returns, an increase in the sup-
ply of capital will reduce real wages.
2.7
Government Spending, Taxes, and Investment.
Suppose a government places a 10 percent tax on
incomes and spends half the money from taxes on
investment and half on public consumption goods,
such as military parades. Individuals save 20 percent
of their income and consume the rest. Does total
investment (public and private) increase or decrease
in this case?
2.8
Trade Deficits and Capital Deepening. The United
States ran large trade deficits during the 1980s and
1990s. What data would you want if you were to
investigate whether these trade deficits led to
increased or decreased capital deepening?
8.2
The Key Role of Technological Progress
3.1
Robert Solow added 
to the conventional
production function to account for technological change.
3.2
Once we account for changes in the labor force,
is the next biggest source of the growth
of GDP in the United States.
3.3
China has a higher rate of technological progress
than India. 
(True/False) (Related to
Application 3 on page 169.)
3.4
According to growth accounting studies, which of the
following is a possible reason for the slowdown in
growth in the 1970s?
a. Reduced rates of capital deepening
b. Changes in the quality or experience of the labor force
c. A slowdown in technological progress or other factors
d. All of the above are possible factors according to
growth accounting studies.
3.5
Technological Progress in Banking. Computers
have revolutionized banking for consumers through
the growth of ATMs and electronic bill paying capa-
bilities. Why might not all of these improvements for
consumers be counted as technological progress?
3.6
Foreign Investment and Technological Progress.
Many economists believe countries that open themselves
to foreign investment of plant and equipment will bene-
fit in terms of increased technological change because
local companies will learn from the foreign companies.
In the last several decades, China has been more open to
foreign investment than India. Explain how this is consis-
tent with the two countries  patterns of economic
growth. (Related to Application 3 on page 169.)
3.7
Technological Progress in Health Care. The intro-
duction of electronic health records is currently
viewed as an important innovation in the delivery of
health care. Explain how this innovation may increase
the supply of capital or labor used in health-care deliv-
ery and provide additional benefits to the consumer.
(Related to Application 4 on page 170.)
3.8
Information Technology Spillovers and Economic
Growth. Why would it matter if the productivity
gains associated with information technology spill
over into other sectors of the economy besides infor-
mation technology itself? Give a few examples of
changes in information technology improving produc-
tivity in other sectors of the economy. (Related to
Application 4 on page 170.)
3.9
Health Insurance, Wages, and Compensation. In
recent years, total compensation of employees
including benefits
has grown, but wages, not including
8.3

benefits, have not. Explain why this may have
occurred, taking into account that many employers
provide health insurance to their employees and
health-care costs have grown more rapidly than GDP.
Is health insurance free to employees?
What Causes Technological Progress?
4.1
Who developed the theory of scale of the market?
a. Joseph Schumpeter
b. Milton Friedman
c. Adam Smith
d. John Maynard Keynes
4.2
Investment in human capital includes purchases of com-
puters used by professors. 
(True/False)
4.3
Which of the following may influence technological
progress?
a. The scale of the market
b. Monopolies
c. Research and development spending
d. All of the above
4.4
A policy of not enforcing patents or copyrights would
the incentive to be innovative.
4.5
Cutting the Length of Patents. Suppose a group
of consumer activists claims drug companies earn
excessive profits because of the patents they have on
drugs. The activists advocate cutting the length of
time that a drug company can hold a patent to five
years. They argue that this will lead to lower prices
for drugs because competitors will enter the market
after the five-year period. Do you see any draw-
backs to this proposal?
4.6
Dictatorships and Economic Growth. Discuss this
quote: With a strong economy, dictators could raise
more money for armies and police to help keep them-
selves in power. Therefore, dictators should welcome
rapid economic growth.  (Related to Application 5 on
page 173.)
4.7
How Do We Measure Technological Progress? If
we cannot measure every invention or new idea, how
can we possibly measure the contribution to growth of
technological progress?
4.8
Height and Weight during Rapid Industrialization.
Economic historians have found that the average height
of individuals in both the United States and the United
Kingdom fell during the mid-nineteenth century
before rising again. This was a period of rapid industri-
alization as well as migration into urban areas. What
factors do you think might account for this fall in height
and how would it affect your evaluation of economic
welfare during the period?
8.4
4.9
Going to Medical School at the Age of 50. While
we might admire someone who decides to attend med-
ical school at the age of 50, explain using human capi-
tal theory why this is so rare.
4.10 Timing and Cultural Explanations of Economic
Growth. Some critics of cultural theories of economic
growth note that some societies can suddenly start to
grow very rapidly with no obvious accompanying cul-
tural changes. How well does Professor Gregory Clarks
theory fit the rapid growth in some East Asian economies
in recent years? (Related to Application 6 on page 174.)
A Key Governmental Role: Providing the
Correct Incentives and Property Rights
5.1
Clear property rights reduce growth in an economy
because producers are not able to freely use innova-
tions. 
(True/False)
5.2
Which of the following methods has the World Bank
not tried to assist developing countries?
a. Increases in foreign aid
b. Infusions of new machinery
c. Promotion of universal education
d. Promotion of population growth
5.3
The return from education in developing countries
is often higher than in developed countries.
(True/False)
5.4
New growth theory suggests that consumption spend-
ing will lead to permanent increases in the rate of
technological progress. 
(True/False)
5.5
Diversity and Economic Growth. Some economists
and political scientists have suggested that when com-
munities are more racially or ethnically diverse, they
invest less in education and spend more on private
goods. Assuming this theory is true, what are the con-
sequences for economic growth?
5.6
The Brain Drain  and Incentives for Education.
Some economists are concerned about the brain drain,
the phenomenon in which highly educated workers leave
developing countries to work in developed countries.
Other economists have argued that brain drain  could
create incentives for others in the country to secure
increased education, and many of the newly educated
might not emigrate. Explain why the brain drain  could
lead to increased education among the remaining resi-
dents. How would you test this theory?
5.7
Secure Property Rights and Work outside the
Home. With secure land titles, parents can work out-
side the home (rather than guarding their property) and
earn higher incomes. Explain why this might reduce
child labor. (Related to Application 7 on page 176.)

A P P E N D I X  A
A MO DEL O F C APITAL DEEP ENING
Here s a simple model showing the links among saving, depreciation, and capital
deepening. Developed by Nobel Laureate Robert Solow of the Massachusetts
Institute of Technology, the Solow model will help us understand more fully the criti-
cal role technological progress must play in economic growth. We rely on one of our
basic principles of economics to help explain the model as well as make a few simplify-
ing assumptions. We assume constant population and no government or foreign sec-
tor. In the chapter, we discussed the qualitative effects of population growth,
government, and the foreign sector on capital deepening. Here we focus solely on the
relationships among saving, depreciation, and capital deepening.
Figure 8A.1 plots the relationship in the economy between output and the stock
of capital, holding the labor force constant. Notice that output increases as the stock
of capital increases, but at a decreasing rate. This is an illustration of the principle of
diminishing returns.
180
Capital, K
Output, Y
* FIGURE 8A.1
Diminishing Returns to Capital
Holding labor constant, increases in the stock of capital increase output, but at a decreasing rate.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  D I M I N I S H I N G  R E T U R N S
Suppose output is produced with two or more inputs and we increase one
input while holding the other inputs fixed. Beyond some point
called the
point of diminishing returns
output will increase at a decreasing rate.
Increasing the stock of capital while holding the labor force constant will increase
output, but at a decreasing rate.
As Figure 8A.1 indicates, output increases with the stock of capital. But what
causes the stock of capital to increase? The capital stock will increase as long as gross
investment exceeds depreciation. Therefore, we need to determine the level of gross
investment and the level of depreciation to see how the capital stock changes over time.
Recall that without government or a foreign sector, saving equals gross invest-
ment. Thus, to determine the level of investment, we need to specify how much of
output is saved and how much is consumed. We will assume that a fraction s of total
output (Y) is saved. For example, if s = 0.20, then 20 percent of GDP would be saved
and 80 percent would be consumed. Total saving will be sY, the product of the saving
rate and total output.

In Panel A of Figure 8A.2, the top curve is total output as a function of the stock
of capital. The curve below it represents saving as a function of the stock of capital.
Because saving is a fixed fraction of total output, the saving curve is a constant fraction
of the output curve. If the saving rate is 0.2, saving will always be 20 percent of output
for any level of the capital stock. Total saving increases in the economy with the stock
of capital, but at a decreasing rate.

* FIGURE 8A.2
Saving and Depreciation as Functions of the Stock of Capital
To complete our model, we need to determine depreciation. Lets say the capital
stock depreciates at a constant rate of d per year. If d = 0.03, the capital stock would
depreciate at 3 percent per year. If the capital stock were 100 at the beginning of the
year, depreciation would equal 3. Total depreciation can be written as dK, where K is
the stock of capital.
Panel B of Figure 8A.2 plots total depreciation as a function of the stock of capi-
tal. The larger the stock of capital, the more total depreciation there will be. Because
the depreciation rate is assumed to be constant, total depreciation as a function of the
stock of capital will be a straight line through the origin. Then if there is no capital,
there will be no depreciation, no matter what the depreciation rate.
If the depreciation rate is 3 percent and the stock of capital is 100, depreciation
will be 3; if the stock of capital is 200, the depreciation rate will be 6. Plotting these
points will give a straight line through the origin.
We are now ready to see how the stock of capital changes:
The stock of capital will increase
the change will be positive
as long as total saving
in the economy exceeds depreciation.
Figure 8A.3 shows how the Solow model works by plotting output, saving, and
depreciation all on one graph. Suppose the economy starts with a capital stock K0.
Then total saving will be given by point a on the saving schedule. Depreciation at the
capital stock K0 is given by point b. Because a lies above b, total saving exceeds depre-
ciation, and the capital stock will increase. As the capital stock increases, there will be
economic growth through capital deepening. With more capital per worker in the
economy, output is higher and real wages increase. The economy benefits from the
additional stock of capital.
Using the graph, we can trace the future for this economy. As the stock of capital
increases, we move to the right. When the economy reaches K1, total saving is at point
c and total depreciation is at point d. Because c is still higher than d, saving exceeds
depreciation and the capital stock continues to increase. Economic growth continues.
Eventually, after many years, the economy reaches capital stock K*. The level of out-
put in the economy now is Y*, and the saving and depreciation schedules intersect at
change in the stock of capital = saving - depreciation = sY - dK

point e. Because total saving equals depreciation, the stock of capital no longer
increases. The process of economic growth through capital deepening has stopped.
In this simple model, the process of capital deepening must eventually come to
an end. As the stock of capital increases, output increases, but at a decreasing rate
because of diminishing returns. Because saving is a fixed fraction of output, it will
also increase but at a diminishing rate. On the other hand, total depreciation is pro-
portional to the stock of capital. As the stock of capital increases, depreciation will
always catch up with total saving in the economy. It may take decades for the process
of capital deepening to come to an end. But as long as total saving exceeds depreci-
ation, the process of economic growth through capital deepening will continue.
What would happen if a society saved a higher fraction of its output? Figure 8A.4
shows the consequences of a higher saving rate. Suppose the economy were originally
saving at a rate s1. Eventually, the economy would reach e1, where saving and depreci-
ation meet. If the economy had started to save at the higher rate s2, saving would
exceed depreciation at K1, and the capital stock would increase until the economy
reached K2. At K2, the saving line again crosses the line representing depreciation.

Starting at K0, saving exceeds depreciation. The stock of capital increases. This process continues
until the stock of capital reaches its long-run equilibrium at K*.

Output is higher than it was initially, but the process of capital deepening stops at this
higher level of output.
If there is ongoing technological progress, economic growth can continue. If
technological progress raises GDP, saving will increase as well, because saving
increases with GDP. This will lead to a higher stock of capital. In Figure 8A.5, techno-
logical progress is depicted as an upward shift of the saving function. The saving func-
tion shifts up because saving is a fixed fraction of output, and we have assumed that
technological progress has raised the level of output.

Technological Progress and Growth
Technological progress shifts up the saving function and promotes capital deepening.
With a higher level of saving, the stock of capital will increase. If the stock of cap-
ital were originally at K0, the upward shift in the saving schedule will lead to increases
in the stock of capital to K1. If there is further technological progress, capital deepen-
ing will continue.
Technological progress conveys a double benefit to a society. Not only does the
increased efficiency directly raise per capita output, it also leads to additional capital
deepening. Therefore, output increases for two reasons.
Lets summarize the basic points of the Solow model:
1 Capital deepening, an increase in the stock of capital per worker, will occur as
long as total saving exceeds depreciation. As capital deepening occurs, there will
be economic growth and increased real wages.
2 Eventually, the process of capital deepening will come to a halt as depreciation
catches up with total saving.
3 A higher saving rate will promote capital deepening. If a country saves more, it
will have a higher output. But eventually, the process of economic growth
through capital deepening alone comes to an end, even though this may take
decades to occur.
4 Technological progress not only directly raises output, but also it allows capital
deepening to continue.
It is possible to relax our assumptions and allow for population growth, govern-
ment taxes and spending, and the foreign sector. In more advanced courses, these
issues are treated in detail, but the underlying message is the same. There is a natural
limit to economic growth through capital deepening. Technological progress is
required to ensure that per capita incomes grow over time.

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
As we explained in previous chapters, recessions occur
when output fails to grow and unemployment rises. But
why do recessions occur?
In a sense, recessions are massive failures in economic
coordination. For example, during the Great Depression in
the 1930s, nearly one-fourth of the U.S. labor force was
unemployed. Unemployed workers could not afford to buy
goods and services. Factories that manufactured those
goods and services had to be shut down because there
was little or no demand. As these factories closed, even
more workers became unemployed, fueling additional fac-
tory shutdowns. This vicious cycle caused the U.S. econ-
omy to spiral downward. Similar failures in coordination
were happening throughout the world. The worldwide
depression continued through the 1930s. How could this
destructive chain of events have been halted?
This failure of coordination is not just a historical phe-
nomenon. In December 2007 the economy also entered a
very steep downturn
although not nearly as severe as the
Great Depression. Business activity slowed and many work-
ers lost their jobs. What was the cause of this slowdown of
economic activity?

CHAPTER 9
AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
186
E
conomies do not always operate at full employment, nor do they always grow
smoothly. At times, real GDP grows below its potential or falls steeply, as it did
in the Great Depression. Recessions and excess unemployment occur when
real GDP falls. At other times, GDP grows too rapidly, and unemployment falls
below its natural rate.
Too slow  or too fast  real GDP growth are examples of economic fluctuations
movements of GDP away from potential output. We now turn our attention to under-
standing these economic fluctuations, which are also called business cycles.
During the Great Depression, there was a failure in coordination. Factories
would have produced more output and hired more workers if there had been more
demand for their products. In his 1936 book, The General Theory of Employment,
Interest, and Money, British economist John Maynard Keynes explained that insuffi-
cient demand for goods and services was a key problem of the Great Depression.
Following the publication of Keynes s work, economists began to distinguish
between real GDP in the long run, when prices have time to fully adjust to changes
in demand, and real GDP in the short run, when prices don t yet have time to fully
adjust to changes in demand. During the short run, economic coordination problems
are most pronounced. In the long run, however, economists believe the economy will
return to full employment, although economic policy may assist it in getting there
more quickly.
In the previous two chapters, we analyzed the economy at full employment and
studied economic growth. Those chapters provided the framework for analyzing the
behavior of the economy in the long run, but not in the short run, when there can be
sharp fluctuations in output. We therefore need to develop an additional set of tools
to analyze both short- and long-run changes and the relationship between the two.
STICKY PRICES AND THEIR
MACROECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES
Why do recessions occur? In Chapter 7 we discussed how real, adverse shocks to the
economy could cause economic downturns. We also outlined the theory of real busi-
ness cycles, which focuses on how shocks to technology cause economic fluctuations.
Now we examine another approach to understanding economic fluctuations.
Led by Keynes, many economists have focused attention on economic coordina-
tion problems. Normally, the price system efficiently coordinates what goes on in an
economy
even in a complex economy. The price system provides signals to firms as
to who buys what, how much to produce, what resources to use, and from whom to
buy. For example, if consumers decide to buy fresh fruit rather than chocolate, the
price of fresh fruit will rise and the price of chocolate will fall. More fresh fruit and less
chocolate will be produced on the basis of these price signals. On a day-to-day basis,
the price system works silently in the background, matching the desires of consumers
with the output from producers.
Flexible and Sticky Prices
But the price system does not always work instantaneously. If prices are slow to adjust,
then they do not give the proper signals to producers and consumers quickly enough
to bring them together. Demands and supplies will not be brought immediately into
equilibrium, and coordination can break down. In modern economies, some prices are
very flexible, whereas others are not. In the 1970s, U.S. economist Arthur Okun dis-
tinguished between auction prices, prices that adjust on a nearly daily basis, and custom
prices, prices that adjust slowly. Prices for fresh fish, vegetables, and other food prod-
ucts are examples of auction prices
they typically are very flexible and adjust rapidly.
Prices for industrial commodities, such as steel rods or machine tools, are custom
prices and tend to adjust slowly to changes in demand. As shorthand, economists often
9.1

187
PART 4
refer to slowly adjusting prices as sticky prices  (just like a door that won t open
immediately but sometimes gets stuck).
Steel rods and machine tools are input prices. Like other input prices, the price of
labor also adjusts very slowly. Workers often have long-term contracts that do not
allow employers to change wages at all during a given year. Union workers, university
professors, high-school teachers, and employees of state and local governments are all
groups whose wages adjust very slowly. As a general rule, there are very few workers in
the economy whose wages change quickly. Perhaps movie stars, athletes, and rock
stars are the exceptions, because their wages rise and fall with their popularity. But
they are far from the typical worker in the economy. Even unskilled, low-wage work-
ers are often protected from a decrease in their wages by minimum-wage laws.
For most firms, the biggest cost of doing business is wages. If wages are sticky,
firms  overall costs will be sticky as well. This means that firms  product prices will
remain sticky, too. Sticky wages cause sticky prices and hamper the economys ability
to bring demand and supply into balance in the short run.
How Demand Determines Output in the Short Run
Typically, firms that supply intermediate goods such as steel rods or other inputs let
demand
not price
determine the level of output in the short run. To understand
this idea, consider an automobile firm that buys material from a steelmaker on a regu-
lar basis. Because the auto firm and the steel producer have been in business with one
another for a long time and have an ongoing relationship, they have negotiated a con-
tract that keeps steel prices fixed in the short run.
But suppose the automobile companys cars suddenly become very popular. The
firm needs to expand production, so it needs more steel. Under the agreement made
earlier by the two firms, the steel company would meet this higher demand and sell
more steel
without raising its price
to the automobile company. As a result, the
production of steel is totally determined in the short run by the demand from automo-
bile producers, not by price.
But what if the firm discovered that it had produced an unpopular car and needed
to cut back on its planned production? The firm would require less steel. Under the
agreement, the steelmaker would supply less steel but not reduce its price. Again,
demand
not price
determines steel production in the short run.
Similar agreements between firms, both formal and informal, exist throughout
the economy. Typically, in the short run, firms will meet changes in the demand for
their products by adjusting production with only small changes in the prices they
charge their customers.
What we have just illustrated for an input such as steel applies to workers, too, who
are also inputs  to production. Suppose the automobile firm hires union workers under
a contract that fixes their wages for a specific period. If the economy suddenly thrives at
some point during that period, the automobile company will employ all the workers and
perhaps require some to work overtime. If the economy stagnates at some point during
that period, the firm will lay off some workers, using only part of the union labor force.
In either case, wages are sticky
they will not change during the period of the contract.
Retail prices to consumers, like input prices to producers, are also subject to some
stickiness.  Economists have used information from mail-order catalogues to docu-
ment this stickiness. Retail price stickiness is further evidence that many prices in the
economy are simply slow to adjust.
Over longer periods of time, prices do change. Suppose the automobile com-
pany s car remains popular for a long time. The steel company and the automobile
company will adjust the price of steel on their contract to reflect this increased
demand. These price adjustments occur only over long periods. In the short run,
demand, not prices, determines output, and prices are slow to adjust.
To summarize, the short run in macroeconomics is the period in which prices
do not change or do not change very much. In the macroeconomic short run, both

formal and informal contracts between firms mean that changes in demand will be
reflected primarily in changes in output, not prices.
UNDERSTANDING AGGREGATE DEMAND
In this section, we develop a graphical tool known as the aggregate demand curve. Later
in the chapter, we will develop the aggregate supply curve. Together the aggregate
demand and aggregate supply curves form an economic model that will enable us to
study how output and prices are determined in both the short run and the long run.
This economic model will also provide a framework in which we can study the role
the government can play in stabilizing the economy through its spending, tax, and
money-creation policies.
What Is the Aggregate Demand Curve?
Aggregate demand is the total demand for goods and services in an entire economy. In
other words, it is the demand for currently produced GDP by consumers, firms, the
government, and the foreign sector. Aggregate demand is a macroeconomic concept,
because it refers to the economy as a whole, not to individual goods or markets.
The aggregate demand curve (AD) shows the relationship between the level of
prices and the quantity of real GDP demanded. An aggregate demand curve, AD, is
shown in Figure 9.1. It plots the total demand for GDP as a function of the price level.
(Recall that the price level is the average level of prices in the economy, as measured by

MEASURING PRICE STICKINESS IN CONSUMER MARKETS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: What does the behavior of prices in consumer
markets demonstrate about how quickly prices adjust in the U.S. economy?
Economists have taken a number of different approaches to analyze the behavior of
retail prices. Anil Kashyap of the University of Chicago examined prices in consumer
catalogs. In particular, he looked at the prices of 12 selected goods from L.L. Bean,
Recreational Equipment, Inc. (REI), and The Orvis Company, Inc. Kashyap tracked
several goods over time, including several varieties of shoes, blankets, chamois shirts,
binoculars, and a fishing rod and fly. He found considerable price stickiness. Prices of
the goods he tracked were typically fixed for a year or more (even though the catalogs
came out every six months). When prices did eventually change, Kashyap observed a
mixture of both large and small changes. During periods of high inflation, prices
tended to change more frequently, as we might expect.
Mark Bils of the University of Rochester and Peter Klenow of Stanford
University examined the frequency of price changes for 350 categories of goods and
services covering about 70 percent of consumer spending, based on unpublished data
from the BLS for 1995 to 1997. Compared with previous studies they found more fre-
quent price changes, with half of goods  prices lasting less than 4.3 months. Some cat-
egories of prices changed much more frequently. Price changes for tomatoes occurred
about every three weeks. And some, like coin-operated laundries, changed prices on
average only every 
years or so.

a price index.) At each price level, shown on the y axis, we ask what the total quantity
demanded will be for all goods and services in the economy, shown on the x axis. In
Figure 9.1, the aggregate demand curve is downward sloping. As the price level falls,
the total quantity demanded for goods and services increases. To understand what the
aggregate demand curve represents, we must first learn the components of aggregate
demand, why the aggregate demand curve slopes downward, and the factors that can
shift the curve.
The Components of Aggregate Demand
In our study of GDP accounting, we divided GDP into four components: consump-
tion spending (C), investment spending (I), government purchases (G), and net
exports (NX). These four components are also the four parts of aggregate demand
because the aggregate demand curve really just describes the demand for total GDP at
different price levels. As we will see, changes in demand coming from any of these
four sources
C, I, G, or NX
will shift the aggregate demand curve.
Why the Aggregate Demand Curve Slopes Downward
To understand the slope of the aggregate demand curve, we need to consider the
effects of a change in the overall price level in the economy. First, let s consider the
supply of money in the economy. We discuss the supply of money in detail in later
chapters, but for now, just think of the supply of money as being the total amount of
currency (cash plus coins) held by the public and the value of all deposits in savings
and checking accounts. As the price level or average level of prices in the economy
changes, so does the purchasing power of your money. This is an example of the real-
nominal principle.
R E A L - N O M I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
What matters to people is the real value or purchasing power of money or
income, not the face value of money or income.

Aggregate Demand
The aggregate demand curve plots the total demand for real GDP as a function of the price level.
The aggregate demand curve slopes downward, indicating that the quantity of aggregate demand
increases as the price level in the economy falls.

CHAPTER 9
AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
190
As the purchasing power of money changes, the aggregate demand curve is
affected in three different ways:
The wealth effect
The interest rate effect
The international trade effect
Lets take a closer look at each.
THE WEALTH EFFECT
The increase in spending that occurs because the real value
of money increases when the price level falls is known as the wealth effect. Lower
prices lead to higher levels of wealth, and higher levels of wealth increase spending on
total goods and services. Conversely, when the price level rises, the real value of money
decreases, which reduces peoples wealth and their total demand for goods and services
in the economy. When the price level rises, consumers can t simply substitute one good
for another thats cheaper, because at a higher price level everything is more expensive.
THE INTEREST RATE EFFECT
With a given supply of money in the economy, a
lower price level will lead to lower interest rates. With lower interest rates, both con-
sumers and firms will find it cheaper to borrow money to make purchases. As a conse-
quence, the demand for goods in the economy (consumer durables purchased by
households and investment goods purchased by firms) will increase. (We ll explain the
effects of interest rates in more detail in later chapters.)
THE INTERNATIONAL TRADE EFFECT
In an open economy, a lower price level
will mean that domestic goods (goods produced in the home country) become cheaper
relative to foreign goods, so the demand for domestic goods will increase. For exam-
ple, if the price level in the United States falls, it will make U.S. goods cheaper relative
to foreign goods. If U.S. goods become cheaper than foreign goods, exports from the
United States will increase and imports will decrease. Thus, net exports
a compo-
nent of aggregate demand
will increase.
Shifts in the Aggregate Demand Curve
A fall in price causes the aggregate demand curve to slope downward because of three
factors: the wealth effect, the interest rate effect, and the international trade effect.
What happens to the aggregate demand curve if a variable other than the price level
changes? An increase in aggregate demand means that total demand for all the goods
and services contained in real GDP has increased
even though the price level hasn t
changed. In other words, increases in aggregate demand shift the curve to the right.
Conversely, factors that decrease aggregate demand shift the curve to the left
even
though the price level hasn t changed.
Lets look at the key factors that cause these shifts. We will discuss each factor in
detail in later chapters:
Changes in the supply of money
Changes in taxes
Changes in government spending
All other changes in demand
CHANGES IN THE SUPPLY OF MONEY
An increase in the supply of money in
the economy will increase aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to
the right. We know that an increase in the supply of money will lead to higher demand
by both consumers and firms. At any given price level, a higher supply of money will
mean more consumer wealth and an increased demand for goods and services. A
decrease in the supply of money will decrease aggregate demand and shift the aggre-
gate demand curve to the left.
wealth effect
The increase in spending that occurs
because the real value of money increases
when the price level falls.

191
PART 4
CHANGES IN TAXES
A decrease in taxes will increase aggregate demand and shift
the aggregate demand curve to the right. Lower taxes will increase the income avail-
able to households and increase their spending on goods and services
even though
the price level in the economy hasn t changed. An increase in taxes will decrease
aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to the left. Higher taxes will
decrease the income available to households and decrease their spending.
CHANGES IN GOVERNMENT SPENDING
At any given price level, an increase in
government spending will increase aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand
curve to the right. For example, the government could spend more on national
defense or on interstate highways. Because the government is a source of demand for
goods and services, higher government spending naturally leads to an increase in total
demand for goods and services. Similarly, decreases in government spending will
decrease aggregate demand and shift the curve to the left.
ALL OTHER CHANGES IN DEMAND
Any change in demand from households,
firms, or the foreign sector will also change aggregate demand. For example, if the
Chinese economy expands very rapidly and Chinese citizens buy more U.S. goods,
U.S. aggregate demand will increase. Or, if U.S. households decide they want to
spend more, consumption will increase and aggregate demand will increase. Expecta-
tions about the future also matter. For example, if firms become optimistic about the
future and increase their investment spending, aggregate demand will also increase.
However, if firms become pessimistic, they will cut their investment spending and
aggregate demand will fall.
When we discuss factors that shift aggregate demand, we must not include any
changes in the demand for goods and services that arise from movements in the price
level. Changes in aggregate demand that accompany changes in the price level are
already included in the curve and do not shift the curve. The increase in consumer
spending that occurs when the price level falls from the wealth effect, the interest rate
effect, and the international trade effect is already in the curve and does not shift it.
Figure 9.2 and Table 9.1 summarize our discussion. Decreases in taxes, increases
in government spending, and increases in the supply of money all shift the aggregate
demand curve to the right. Increases in taxes, decreases in government spending, and
decreases in the supply of money shift it to the left. In general, any increase in demand

(not brought about by a change in the price level) will shift the curve to the right.
Decreases in demand shift the curve to the left.
How the Multiplier Makes the Shift Bigger
Let s take a closer look at the shift in the aggregate demand curve and see how far
changes really make the curve shift. Suppose the government increases its spending on
goods and services by $10 billion. You might think the aggregate demand curve would
shift to the right by $10 billion, reflecting the increase in demand for these goods and
services. Initially, the shift will be precisely $10 billion. In Figure 9.3, this is depicted
by the shift (at a given price level) from a to b. But after a brief period of time, total
aggregate demand will increase by more than $10 billion. In Figure 9.3, the total shift
in the aggregate demand curve is shown by the larger movement from a to c. The ratio
of the total shift in aggregate demand to the initial shift in aggregate demand is known
as the multiplier.
Why does the aggregate demand curve shift more than the initial increase in
desired spending? The logic goes back to the ideas of economist John Maynard
Keynes. Heres how it works: Keynes believed that as government spending increases
and the aggregate demand curve shifts to the right, output will subsequently increase,
too. As we saw with the circular flow in Chapter 5, increased output also means
increased income for households, as firms pay households for their labor and for sup-
plying other factors of production. Typically, households will wish to spend, or con-
sume, part of that income, which will further increase aggregate demand. It is this
additional spending by consumers, over and above what the government has already
spent, that causes the further shift in the aggregate demand curve.
The basic idea of how the multiplier works in an economy is simple. Lets say the
government invests $10 million to renovate a federal court building. Initially, total
spending in the economy increases by this $10 million paid to a private construction
firm. The construction workers and owners are paid $10 million for their work.
Suppose the owners and workers spend $6 million of their income on new cars

Initially, an increase in desired spending will shift the aggregate demand curve horizontally to the

is known as the multiplier.

193
PART 4
(although, as we will see, it does not really matter what they spend it on). To meet the
increased demand for new cars, automobile producers will expand their production and
earn an additional $6 million in wages and profits. They, in turn, will spend part of this
additional income
lets say, $3.6 million
on televisions. The workers and owners who
produce televisions will then spend part of the $3.6 million they earn, and so on.
To take a closer look at this process, we first need to look more carefully at the
behavior of consumers and how their behavior helps to determine the level of aggre-
gate demand. Economists have found that consumer spending depends on the level of
income in the economy. When consumers have more income, they want to purchase
more goods and services. The relationship between the level of income and consumer
spending is known as the consumption function:
where consumption spending, C, has two parts. The first part, Ca, is a constant and is
independent of income. Economists call this autonomous consumption spending.
Autonomous spending is spending that does not depend on the level of income.
For example, all consumers, regardless of their current income, will have to purchase
some food. The second part, by, represents the part of consumption that is dependent
on income. It is the product of a fraction, b, called the marginal propensity to
consume (MPC), and the level of income, or y, in the economy. The MPC (or b in
our formula) tells us how much consumption spending will increase for every dollar
that income increases. For example, if b is 0.6, then for every $1.00 that income
increases, consumption increases by $0.60.
Here is another way to think of the MPC: If a household receives some additional
income, it will increase its consumption by some additional amount. The MPC is
defined as the ratio of additional consumption to additional income, or
For example, if the household receives an additional $100 and consumes an additional
$70, the MPC will be
You may wonder what happens to the other $30. Whatever the household does not
spend out of income, it saves. Therefore, the marginal propensity to save (MPS) is
defined as the ratio of additional savings to additional income
The sum of the MPC and the MPS always equals one. By definition, additional
income is either spent or saved.
Now we are in a better position to understand the multiplier. Suppose the govern-
ment increases its purchases of goods and services by $10 million. This will initially
raise aggregate demand and income by $10 million. But because income has risen by
$10 million, consumers will now wish to increase their spending by an amount equal
to the marginal propensity to consume multiplied by the $10 million. (Remember that
the MPC tells us how much consumption spending will increase for every dollar that
income increases.) If the MPC were 0.6, then consumer spending would increase by
$6 million when the government spends $10 million. Thus, the aggregate demand
curve would continue to shift to the right by another $6 million in addition to the
original $10 million, for a total of $16 million.
But the process does not end there. As aggregate demand increases by $6 million,
income will also increase by $6 million. Consumers will then wish to increase their

spending by the MPC * $6 million or, in our example, by $3.6 million (0.6 * $6 mil-
lion). The aggregate demand curve will continue to shift to the right, now by another
$3.6 million. Adding $3.6 million to $16 million gives us a new aggregate demand
total of $19.6 million. As you can see, this process will continue, as consumers now
have an additional $3.6 million in income, part of which they will spend again. Where
will it end?
Table 9.2 shows how the multiplier works in detail. In the first round, there is an
initial increase in government spending of $10 million. This additional demand leads
to an initial increase in GDP and income of $10 million. Assuming that the MPC is
0.6, the $10 million of additional income will increase consumer spending by $6 mil-
lion. The second round begins with this $6 million increase in consumer spending.
Because of this increase in demand, GDP and income increase by $6 million. At the
end of the second round, consumers will have an additional $6 million; with an MPC
of 0.6, consumer spending will therefore increase by 0.6 * $6 million, or $3.6 million.
The process continues in the third round with an increase in consumer spending of
$2.16 million. It continues, in diminishing amounts, through subsequent rounds. If we
add up the spending in all the (infinite) rounds, we will find that the initial $10 million
of spending leads to a $25 million increase in GDP and income. Thats 2.5 times what
the government initially spent. So in this case, the multiplier is 2.5.
TABLE 9.2 THE MULTIPLIER IN ACTION
The initial $10 million increase in aggregate demand will, through all the
rounds of spending, eventually lead to a $25 million increase.

Instead of calculating spending round by round, we can use a simple formula to
figure out what the multiplier is:
Thus, in the preceding example, when the MPC is 0.6, the multiplier would be
Now you should clearly understand why the total shift in the aggregate demand
curve from a to c in Figure 9.3 is greater than the initial shift in the curve from a to b.
This is the multiplier in action. The multiplier is important because it means that rel-
atively small changes in spending could lead to relatively large changes in output. For
example, if firms cut back on their investment spending, the effects on output would
be multiplied,  and this decrease in spending could have a large, adverse impact on
the economy.
In practice, once we take into account other realistic factors such as taxes and
indirect effects through financial markets, the multipliers are smaller than our previ-
ous examples, typically near 1.5 for the U.S economy. This means that a $10 million
increase in one component of spending will shift the U.S. aggregate demand curve by
approximately $15 million. Some economists believe the multiplier is even closer to

one. Knowing the value of the multiplier is important for two reasons. First, it tells us
how much shocks to aggregate demand are amplified.  Second, to design effective
economic policies to shift the aggregate demand curve, we need to know the value of
the multiplier to measure the proper dose  for policy. In the next chapter, we present
a more detailed model of aggregate demand and see how policymakers use the real-
world multipliers.
UNDERSTANDING AGGREGATE SUPPLY
Now we turn to the supply side of our model. The aggregate supply curve (AS)
shows the relationship between the level of prices and the total quantity of final goods
and output that firms are willing and able to supply. The aggregate supply curve will
complete our macroeconomic picture, uniting the economys demand for real output
with firms  willingness to supply output. To determine both the price level and real
GDP, we need to combine both aggregate demand and aggregate supply. One slight
complication is that because prices are sticky  in the short run, we need to develop
two different aggregate supply curves, one corresponding to the long run and one to
the short run.
The Long-Run Aggregate Supply Curve
First we ll consider the aggregate supply curve for the long run, that is, when the
economy is at full employment. This curve is also called the long-run aggregate
supply curve. In previous chapters, we saw that the level of full-employment output,
yp (the p  stands for potential), depends solely on the supply of factors
capital,
labor
and the state of technology. These are the fundamental factors that determine
output in the long run, that is, when the economy operates at full employment.
In the long run, the economy operates at full employment and changes in the price
level do not affect employment. To illustrate why this is so, imagine that the price level
in the economy increases by 50 percent. That means firms  prices, on average, will also
increase by 50 percent. However, so will their input costs. Their profits will be the
same and, consequently, so will their output. Because the level of full-employment out-
put does not depend on the price level, we can plot the long-run aggregate supply curve
as a vertical line (unaffected by the price level), as shown in Figure 9.4.

CHAPTER 9
AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
196
The intersection of an aggregate demand curve and an aggregate supply curve deter-
mines the price level and equilibrium level of output. At that intersection point, the total
amount of output demanded will just equal the total amount supplied by producers
the
economy will be in macroeconomic equilibrium. The exact position of the aggregate
demand curve will depend on the level of taxes, government spending, and the supply of
money, although it will always slope downward. The level of full-employment output
determines the long-run aggregate supply curve.
An increase in aggregate demand (perhaps brought about by a tax cut or an increase
in the supply of money) will shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, as shown in
Figure 9.5. In the long run, the increase in aggregate demand will raise prices but leave
the level of output unchanged. In general, shifts in the aggregate demand curve in the
long run do not change the level of output in the economy, but only change the level of
prices. Here is an important example to illustrate this idea: If the money supply is
increased by 5 percent a year, the aggregate demand curve will also shift by 5 percent a
year. In the long run, this means that prices will increase by 5 percent a year
that is,
there will be 5 percent inflation. An important lesson: In the long run, increases in the
supply of money do not increase real GDP
they only lead to inflation.
This is the key point about the long run: In the long run, output is determined
solely by the supply of human and physical capital and the supply of labor, not the price
level. As our model of the aggregate demand curve with the long-run aggregate supply
curve indicates, changes in demand will affect only prices, not the level of output.
The Short-Run Aggregate Supply Curve
In the short run, prices are sticky (slow to adjust) and output is determined primarily
by demand. This is what Keynes thought happened during the Great Depression. We
can use the aggregate demand curve combined with a short-run aggregate supply
curve to illustrate this idea. Figure 9.6 shows a relatively flat short-run aggregate

DETERMINING OUTPUT AND THE PRICE LEVEL
We combine the aggregate
demand curve and the long-run aggregate supply curve in Figure 9.5. Together, the
curves show us the price level and output in the long run when the economy returns to
full employment. Combining the two curves will enable us to understand how changes
in aggregate demand affect prices in the long run.

supply curve (AS). The short-run aggregate supply curve shows the short-run rela-
tionship between the price level and the willingness of firms to supply output to the
economy. Lets look first at its slope and then the factors that shift the curve.
The short-run aggregate supply curve has a relatively flat slope because we
assume that in the short run firms supply all the output demanded, with small changes
in prices. We ve said that with formal and informal contracts firms will supply all the
output demanded with only relatively small changes in prices. The short-run aggre-
gate supply curve has a small upward slope. As firms supply more output, they may
have to increase prices somewhat if, for example, they have to pay higher wages to
obtain more overtime from workers or pay a premium to obtain some raw materials.
Our description of the short-run aggregate supply curve is consistent with evidence
about the behavior of prices in the economy. Most studies find that changes in
demand have relatively little effect on prices within a few quarters. Thus, we can think
of the aggregate supply curve as relatively flat over a limited time.
The position of the short-run supply curve will be determined by the costs of pro-
duction that firms face. Higher costs will shift up the short-run aggregate supply curve,
while lower costs will shift it down. Higher costs will shift up the curve because, faced
with higher costs, firms will need to raise their prices to continue to make a profit. What
factors determine the costs firms must incur to produce output? The key factors are
input prices (wages and materials),
the state of technology, and
taxes, subsidies, or economic regulations.
Increases in input prices (for example, from higher wages or oil prices) will
increase firms  costs. This will shift up the short-run aggregate supply curve.
Improvement in technology will shift the curve down. Higher taxes or more onerous
regulations raise costs and shift the curve up, while subsidies to production shift the
curve down. As we shall see later in this chapter, when the economy is not at full
employment, wages and other costs will change. These changes in costs will shift the
entire short-run supply curve upward or downward as costs rise or fall.
The intersection of the AD and AS curves at point a0 determines the price level and
the level of output. Because the aggregate supply curve is flat, aggregate demand pri-
marily determines the level of output. In Figure 9.6, as aggregate demand increases, the
new equilibrium will be at a slightly higher price, and output will increase from y0 to y1.

Aggregate Demand and Short-Run Aggregate Supply
With a short-run aggregate supply curve, shifts in aggregate demand lead to large changes in out-
put but small changes in price.

CHAPTER 9
AGGREGATE DEMAND AND AGGREGATE SUPPLY
198
If the aggregate demand curve moved to the left, output would decrease. If the
leftward shift in aggregate demand were sufficiently large, it could push the economy
into a recession. Sudden decreases in aggregate demand have been important causes of
recessions in the United States. However, the precise factors that shift the aggregate
demand curve in each recession will typically differ.
Note that the level of output where the aggregate demand curve intersects the short-
run aggregate supply curve need not correspond to full-employment output. Firms will
produce whatever is demanded. If demand is very high and the economy is overheated,
output may exceed full-employment output. If demand is very low and the economy is in
a slump, output will fall short of full-employment output. Because prices do not adjust
fully over short periods of time, the economy need not always remain at full employment
A P P L I C AT I O N 2
TWO APPROACHES TO DETERMINING THE CAUSES OF
RECESSIONS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: How can we determine what factors
cause recessions?
Economists have used the basic framework of aggregate demand and supply analysis
to explain recessions. Recessions can occur either when there is a sharp decrease in
aggregate demand
a leftward shift in the aggregate demand curve
or a decrease in
aggregate supply
an upward shift in the short-run aggregate supply curve. But this
just puts the question back one level: During particular historical episodes, what actu-
ally shifted the curves?
Figuring out what caused a recession in any particular episode is very challenging.
Here is one complication. Policymakers typically respond to shocks that hit the econ-
omy. So, for example, when worldwide oil prices rose in 1973 causing U.S. prices to
increase, policymakers also reduced aggregate demand to prevent further price
increases. Was the recession that resulted due to (1) the increase in oil prices that
shifted the short-run aggregate supply curve or (2) the decrease in aggregate demand
engineered by policymakers? It is very difficult to know.
One approach is to use economic models to address this question. Economists
James Fackler and Douglas McMillin built a small model of the economy to address this
issue. To distinguish between demand and supply shocks, they used an idea that we dis-
cuss in this chapter. Shocks to aggregate demand only affect prices in the long run but
do not affect output. On the other hand, shocks to aggregate supply can affect potential
output in the long run. Using this approach, they find that a mixture of demand and
supply shocks were responsible for fluctuations in output in the United States.
Using more traditional historical methods, economic historian Peter Temin
looked back at all recessionary episodes from 1893 to 1990 in the United States to try
to determine their ultimate causes. According to his analysis, recessions were caused
by many different factors. Sometimes, as in 1929, they were caused by shifts in aggre-
gate demand from the private sector, as consumers cut back their spending. Other
times, as in 1981, the government cut back on aggregate demand to reduce inflation.
Supply shocks were the cause of the recessions in 1973 and 1979.
Based on both economic models and traditional economic history, it does appear
that both supply and demand shocks have been important in understanding recessions.

or potential output. With sticky prices, changes in demand in the short run will lead to
economic fluctuations and over- and underemployment. Only in the long run, when
prices fully adjust, will the economy operate at full employment.
Supply Shocks
Up to this point, we have been exploring how changes in aggregate demand affect output
and prices in the short run and in the long run. However, even in the short run, it is possi-
ble for external disturbances to hit the economy and cause the short-run aggregate supply
curve to move. Supply shocks are external events that shift the aggregate supply curve.
The most notable supply shocks for the world economy occurred in 1973 and
again in 1979 when oil prices increased sharply. Oil is a vital input for many compa-
nies because it is used to both manufacture and transport their products to warehouses
and stores around the country. The higher oil prices raised firms  costs and reduced
their profits. To maintain their profit levels, firms raised their product prices. As we
have seen, increases in firms  costs will shift up the short-run aggregate supply curve
increases in oil prices are a good example.
Figure 9.7 illustrates a supply shock that raises prices. The short-run aggregate supply
curve shifts up with the supply shock because, as their costs rise, firms will supply their
output only at a higher price. The AS curve shifts up, raising the price level and lowering
the level of output from y0 to y1. Adverse supply shocks can therefore cause a recession (a
fall in real output) with increasing prices. This phenomenon is known as stagflation, and
it is precisely what happened in 1973 and 1979. The U.S. economy suffered on two

HOW THE U.S. ECONOMY HAS COPED WITH OIL PRICE
FLUCTUATIONS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Do changes in oil prices always hurt the
U.S. economy?
During the 1970s, the world economy was hit with a series of unfavorable supply
shocks that raised prices and lowered output, including spikes in oil prices and the
prices of many agricultural commodities due to hurricanes, droughts, and floods that
destroyed crops or land. As we have discussed, increases in oil prices shift the aggre-
gate supply curve. However, they also have an adverse effect on aggregate demand.
Because the United States is a net importer of foreign oil, an increase in oil prices is
just like a tax that decreases the income of consumers. As we have seen, an increase in
taxes will shift the aggregate demand curve to the left.
However, in the 1990s, things were different
pleasantly different. Between 1997
and 1998, the price of oil on the world market fell from $22 a barrel to less than $13 a
barrel. The result was that gasoline prices, adjusted for inflation, were lower than they
had been in over 50 years. This not only meant cheaper vacations and commuting and an
increase in SUV purchases, it also had positive macroeconomic effects. Favorable supply
shocks allowed output to rise and prices to fall simultaneously
the best of all worlds.
In 2008, oil prices shot up to $145 a barrel, largely because of increased demand
throughout the world, particularly in fast-growing countries such as China and India.
Gasoline prices in the United States exceeded $4.00 a gallon. The economy had been
weak prior to these increases, and policymakers feared the negative effects this major
supply disturbance would have both on inflation and GDP. Indeed, although the price
of gasoline fell in 2009 and 2010, the price increases in 2008 helped exacerbate the
recession brought on by the difficulties experienced in the financial system.

grounds: rising prices and falling output. Favorable supply shocks, such as falling prices,
are also possible, and changes in oil prices can affect aggregate demand.
FROM THE SHORT RUN TO THE LONG RUN
Up to this point, we have examined how aggregate demand and aggregate supply
determine output and prices both in the short run and in the long run. You may be
wondering how long it takes before the short run becomes the long run. Here is a pre-
view of how the short run and the long run are connected.
In Figure 9.8, we show the aggregate demand curve intersecting the short-run
aggregate supply curve at a0 at an output level y0. We also depict the long-run aggregate
supply curve in this figure. The level of output in the economy, y0, exceeds the level of
potential output, yp. In other words, this is a boom economy: Output exceeds potential.

PART 4
What happens during a boom? Because the economy is producing at a level
beyond its long-run potential, the level of unemployment will be very low. This will
make it difficult for firms to recruit and retain workers. Firms will also find it more
difficult to purchase needed raw materials and other inputs for production. As firms
compete for labor and raw materials, the tendency will be for both wages and prices to
increase over time.
Increasing wages and prices will shift the short-run aggregate supply curve upward as
the costs of inputs rise in the economy. Figure 9.9 shows how the short-run aggregate sup-
ply curve shifts upward over time. As long as the economy is producing at a level of output
that exceeds potential output, there will be continuing competition for labor and raw
materials that will lead to continuing increases in wages and prices. In the long run, the
short-run aggregate supply curve will keep rising until it intersects the aggregate demand
curve at a1. At this point, the economy reaches the long-run equilibrium
precisely the
point where the aggregate demand curve intersects the long-run aggregate supply curve.

Adjusting to the Long Run
With output exceeding potential, the
short-run AS curve shifts upward over
time. The economy adjusts to the long-
run equilibrium at a1.
When the economy is producing below full employment or potential output, the
process works in reverse. Unemployment will exceed the natural rate, and there will
be excess unemployment. Firms will find it easy to hire and retain workers, and they
will offer workers less wages. As firms cut wages, the average wage level in the econ-
omy falls. Because wages are the largest component of costs and costs are decreasing,
the short-run aggregate supply curve shifts down, causing prices to fall as well.
The lesson here is that adjustments in wages and prices take the economy from
the short-run equilibrium to the long-run equilibrium. In later chapters, we will
explain in detail how this adjustment occurs, and we will show how changes in wages
and prices can steer the economy back to full employment in the long run.
Looking Ahead
The aggregate demand and aggregate supply model in this chapter provides an
overview of how demand affects output and prices in both the short run and the long
run. The next several chapters explore more closely how aggregate demand determines
output in the short run. We expand our discussion of aggregate demand to see in detail
how such realistic and important factors as spending by consumers and firms, govern-
ment policies on taxation and spending, and foreign trade affect the demand for goods
and services. We will also study the critical role that the financial system and monetary
policy play in determining demand. Finally, in later chapters we will study in more
depth how the aggregate supply curve shifts over time, enabling the economy to recover
both from recessions and the inflationary pressures generated by economic booms.

202
In this chapter we discussed
how sticky prices
or lack
of 
full-wage 
and 
price 
flexibility
cause output to
be determined by demand
in the short run. We devel-
oped a model of aggregate
demand and supply to help us analyze what is happening or
has happened in the economy. Here are the main points in
this chapter:
1 Because prices are sticky in the short run, economists think of
GDP as being determined primarily by demand factors in the
short run.
2 The aggregate demand curve depicts the relationship
between the price level and total demand for real output in
the economy. The aggregate demand curve is downward
sloping because of the wealth effect, the interest rate effect,
and the international trade effect.
3 Decreases in taxes, increases in government spending, and
increases in the supply of money all increase aggregate
demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.
Increases in taxes, decreases in government spending,
and decreases in the supply of money all decrease aggre-
gate demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to
the left. In general, anything (other than price movements)
that increases the demand for total goods and services will
increase aggregate demand.
4 The total shift in the aggregate demand curve is greater than
the initial shift. The ratio of the total shift in aggregate
demand to the initial shift in aggregate demand is known as
the multiplier.
5 The aggregate supply curve depicts the relationship
between the price level and the level of output that firms
supply in the economy. Output and prices are determined at
the intersection of the aggregate demand and aggregate
supply curves.
6 The long-run aggregate supply curve is vertical because, in
the long run, output is determined by the supply of factors
of production. The short-run aggregate supply curve is
fairly flat because, in the short run, prices are largely fixed,
and output is determined by demand. The costs of produc-
tion determine the position of the short-run aggregate
supply curve.
7 Supply shocks can shift the short-run aggregate supply curve.
8 As costs change, the short-run aggregate supply curve
shifts in the long run, restoring the economy to the full-
employment equilibrium.

Suppose the supply of money increases, causing
output to exceed full employment. Prices will
and real GDP will 
in the

and real GDP
will 
in the long run.

Consider a decrease in the supply of money that
causes output to fall short of full employment. Prices
will 
and real GDP will 
in
the short run, and prices will 
and real
GDP will 
in the long run.
4.3
In a recession, real GDP is 
potential
GDP. 
This 
implies 
that 
unemployment 
is
, driving wages 
. This
results in a(n) 
shift of the short-run
aggregate supply curve.
4.4
A negative supply shock temporarily lowers output
below full employment and raises prices. After the
9.4
negative supply shock, real GDP is 
potential GDP. This implies that unemployment
is
, driving wages. This results in
a(n)
shift of the short-run aggregate sup-
ply curve.
4.5
Lack of Credit and Aggregate Demand and
Supply. In the 2008 recession, both firms and house-
holds had limited access to credit. Explain how this
could be both a negative shock to aggregate demand
and a negative shock to aggregate supply.
4.6
Shifts in Aggregate Demand and Cost-Push
Inflation. When wages rise and the short-run
aggregate supply curve shifts up, the result is cost-
push  inflation. If the economy was initially at full-
employment and the aggregate demand curve was
shifted to the right, explain how cost-push  infla-
tion would result as the economy adjusts back to
full employment.

Evaluating the Obama Fiscal Stimulus
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
As President Obama s administration began in
January 2009, the economy was in the midst of a very
severe recession. Most observers believed that some fis-
cal stimulus was needed, but the size and composition
came under fierce debate. Should the stimulus primarily
take the form of tax cuts, as many Republicans advo-
cated, or should it be primarily concentrated in increased
government spending, as Democrats generally sup-
ported? And how large should the entire stimulus pack-
age be relative to the size of the gross domestic product?
After very contentious political negotiations, President
Obama signed into law a $787 billion stimulus package,
which was approximately 5.5 percent of GDP, the largest
fiscal policy in U.S. history. Approximately one-third of the
package was devoted to tax cuts, the remaining two-thirds
to spending increases. Included in the spending increases
were a large number of infrastructure projects as well as aid
to state governments for assistance in meeting their
health-care obligations.
As the bill was being passed, White House advisers
claimed that with the stimulus unemployment would not
rise above 8 percent; however, by later in the summer
unemployment was near 10 percent. It also proved difficult
to spend so much money. By August of 2009, only 20 per-
cent of the stimulus funds had gone into effect. Did the
biggest fiscal stimulus work as expected?

W
hen the U.S. economy began to slow in late 2007 and early 2008, it was
not long before policymakers and politicians from both major parties were
calling for government action to combat the downturn. Common pre-
scriptions included increasing government spending or reducing taxes, although spe-
cific recommendations differed sharply among those making them. As the economy
was mired in a deep recession in 2008, even louder calls for action were heard.
In this chapter, we study how governments can use fiscal policy
changes in
taxes and spending that affect the level of GDP
to stabilize the economy. We explore
the logic of fiscal policy and explain why changes in government spending and taxa-
tion can, in principle, stabilize the economy. However, stabilizing the economy is
much easier in theory than in actual practice, as we will see.
The chapter also provides an overview of spending and taxation by the federal
government. These are essentially the tools the government uses to implement its fis-
cal policies. We will examine the federal deficit and begin to explore the controversies
surrounding deficit spending.
One of the best ways to really understand fiscal policy is to see it in action. In the
last part of the chapter, we trace the history of U.S. fiscal policy from the Great
Depression in the 1930s to the present. As you will see, the public s attitude toward
government fiscal policy has not been constant but has instead changed over time.
THE ROLE OF FISCAL POLICY
In the last chapter, we discussed how output and prices are determined where the
aggregate demand curve intersects the short-run aggregate supply curve. We also saw
that over time the short-run aggregate supply curve will shift to bring the economy
back to full employment. In this section, we will explore how the government can shift
the aggregate demand curve.
Fiscal Policy and Aggregate Demand
As we discussed in the last chapter, government spending and taxes can affect the level
of aggregate demand. Increases in government spending or decreases in taxes will
increase aggregate demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to the right.
Decreases in government spending or increases in taxes will decrease aggregate
demand and shift the aggregate demand curve to the left.
Why do changes in government spending or taxes shift the aggregate demand
curve? Recall from our discussion in the last chapter that aggregate demand consists
of four components: consumption spending, investment spending, government pur-
chases, and net exports. These four components are the four parts of aggregate
demand. Thus, increases in government purchases directly increase aggregate
demand because they are a component of aggregate demand. Decreases in govern-
ment purchases directly decrease aggregate demand.
Changes in taxes affect aggregate demand indirectly. For example, if the govern-
ment lowers taxes consumers pay, consumers will have more income at their disposal
and will increase their consumption spending. Because consumption spending is a
component of aggregate demand, aggregate demand will increase as well. Increases in
taxes will have the opposite effect. Consumers will have less income at their disposal
and will decrease their consumption spending. As a result, aggregate demand will
decrease. Changes in taxes can also affect businesses and lead to changes in investment
spending. Suppose, for example, that the government cuts taxes in such a way as to
provide incentives for new investment spending by businesses. Because investment
spending is a component of aggregate demand, the increase in investment spending
will increase aggregate demand.
In Panel A of Figure 10.1 we show a simple example of fiscal policy in action. The
economy is initially operating at a level of GDP, y0, where the aggregate demand curve
AD0 intersects the short-run aggregate supply curve AS. This level of output is below

the level of full employment or potential output, yp. To increase the level of output,
the government can increase government spending
say, on military goods
which
will shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, to AD1. Now the new aggregate
demand curve intersects the aggregate supply curve at the full-employment level of
output. Alternatively, instead of increasing its spending, the government could reduce
taxes on consumers and businesses. This would also shift the aggregate demand curve
to the right. Government policies that increase aggregate demand are called
expansionary policies. Increasing government spending and cutting taxes are exam-
ples of expansionary policies.
The government can also use fiscal policy to decrease GDP if the economy is
operating at too high a level of output, which would lead to an overheating economy
and rising prices. In Panel B of Figure 10.1, the economy is initially operating at a
level of output, y0, that exceeds full-employment output, yp. An increase in taxes can
shift the aggregate demand curve from AD0 to AD1. This shift will bring the economy
back to full employment. Alternatively, the government could cut its spending to
move the aggregate demand curve to the left. Government policies that decrease
aggregate demand are called contractionary policies. Decreasing government
spending and increasing taxes are examples of contractionary policies.
Both examples illustrate how policymakers use fiscal policy to stabilize the econ-
omy. In these two simple examples, fiscal policy seems very straightforward. But as we
will soon see, in practice it is more difficult to implement effective policy.
The Fiscal Multiplier
Let s recall the multiplier we developed in the last chapter. The basic idea is that the
final shift in the aggregate demand curve will be larger than the initial increase. For
example, if government purchases increased by $10 billion, that would initially shift
the aggregate demand curve to the right by $10 billion. However, the total shift in the
aggregate demand curve will be larger, say, $15 billion. Conversely, a decrease in pur-
chases by $10 billion may cause a total shift of the aggregate demand curve to the left
by $15 billion.
expansionary policies
Government policy actions that lead to
increases in aggregate demand.
contractionary policies
Government policy actions that lead to
decreases in aggregate demand.

CHAPTER 10
FISCAL POLICY

This multiplier effect occurs because an initial change in output will affect the
income of households and thus change consumer spending. For example, an increase
in government spending of $10 billion will initially raise household incomes by
$10 billion and lead to increases in consumer spending. As we discussed in the last
chapter, the precise amount of the increase will depend on the marginal propensity to
consume and other factors. In turn, the increase in consumer spending will raise out-
put and income further, leading to further increases in consumer spending. The mul-
tiplier takes all these effects into account.
As the government develops policies to stabilize the economy, it needs to take the
multiplier into account. The total shift in aggregate demand will be larger than
the initial shift. As we will see later in this chapter, U.S. policymakers have taken the
multiplier into account as they have developed policies for the economy.
The Limits to Stabilization Policy
We ve seen that the government can use fiscal policy
changes in the level of taxes or
government spending
to alter the level of GDP. If the current level of GDP is below
full employment or potential output, the government can use expansionary policies, such
as tax cuts and increased spending, to raise the level of GDP and reduce unemployment.
Both expansionary and contractionary policies are examples of stabilization policies,
actions to move the economy closer to full employment or potential output.
It is very difficult to implement stabilization policies for two big reasons. First,
there are lags, or delays, in stabilization policy. Lags arise because decision makers are
often slow to recognize and respond to changes in the economy, and fiscal policies and
other stabilization policies take time to operate. Second, economists simply do not
know enough about all aspects of the economy to be completely accurate in all their
forecasts. Although economists have made great progress in understanding the econ-
omy, the difficulties of forecasting the precise behavior of human beings, who can
change their minds or sometimes act irrationally, place limits on our forecasting ability.
LAGS
Poorly timed policies can magnify economic fluctuations. Suppose that (1)
GDP is currently below full employment but will return to full employment on its own
within one year, and that (2) stabilization policies take a full year to become effective. If
policymakers tried to expand the economy today, their actions would not take effect
until a year from now. One year from now, the economy would normally be back at full
employment by itself. But if stabilization policies were enacted, one year from now the
economy would be stimulated unnecessarily, and output would exceed full employment.
Figure 10.2 illustrates the problem caused by lags. Panel A shows an example of
successful stabilization policy. The solid line represents the behavior of GDP in the
absence of policies. Successful stabilization policies can dampen, that is, reduce in
magnitude, economic fluctuations, lowering output when it exceeds full employment
and raising output when it falls below full employment. This would be easy to accom-
plish if there were no lags in policy. The dashed curve shows how successful policies
can reduce economic fluctuations.
Panel B shows the consequences of ill-timed policies. Again, assume that poli-
cies take a year before they are effective. At the start of year 0, the economy is
below potential. If policymakers engaged in expansionary policies at the start of
year 1, the change would not take effect until the end of year 1. This would raise
output even higher above full employment. Ill-timed stabilization policies can
magnify economic fluctuations.
Where do the lags in policy come from? Economists recognize two broad classes
of lags: inside lags and outside lags. Inside lags refer to the time it takes to formulate a
policy. Outside lags refer to the time it takes for the policy to actually work. To help
you understand inside and outside lags, imagine that you are steering a large ocean
liner and you are looking out for possible collisions with hidden icebergs. The time it
takes you to spot an iceberg, communicate this information to the crew, and initiate
the process of changing course is the inside lag. Because ocean liners are large and

have lots of momentum, it will take a long time before your ocean liner begins to turn;
this time is the outside lag.
Inside lags occur for two basic reasons. One is that it takes time to identify and
recognize a problem. For example, the data available to policymakers may be poor and
conflicting. Some economic indicators may look fine, but others may cause concern. It
often takes several months to a year before it is clear that there is a serious problem
with the economy.
A good example of an inside lag occurred at the beginning of the Great
Depression. Although the stock market crashed in October 1929, we know from
newspaper and magazine accounts that business leaders were not particularly worried
about the economy for some time. Not until late in 1930 did the public begin to rec-
ognize the severity of the depression.
The other reason for inside lags is that once a problem has been diagnosed, it still
takes time before the government can take action. This delay is most severe for fiscal
policy because any changes in taxes or spending must be approved by both houses of
Congress and by the president. In recent years, political opponents have been preoc-
cupied with disagreements about the size of the government and the role it should play
in the economy, making it difficult to reach a consensus on action in a timely manner.
For example, soon after he was inaugurated in 1993, President Bill Clinton pro-
posed an expansionary stimulus package as part of his overall budget plan. The package
contained a variety of spending programs designed to increase the level of GDP and
avert a recession. However, the plan was attacked as wasteful and unnecessary, and it
did not survive. As it turned out, the stimulus package was not necessary
the economy
grew rapidly in the next several years. Nonetheless, this episode illustrates how difficult
it is to develop expansionary fiscal policies in time to have the effect we want them to.

CHAPTER 10
FISCAL POLICY
210
Policies are also subject to outside lags
the time it takes for them to become
effective. For example, if taxes are cut, it takes time for individuals and businesses to
change their spending plans to take advantage of the tax cuts. Therefore, it will be a
while before increases in spending raise GDP. Outside lags in fiscal policy are rela-
tively short. Moreover, the multiplier effects tend to work through the economy
rather quickly.
Economists use econometric models to replicate the behavior of the economy math-
ematically and statistically, and to assist them in developing economic forecasts. They
can also use models to estimate the length of outside lags. One such model predicts
that an increase in government spending will increase GDP by its maximum effect
after just six months.
FORECASTING UNCERTAINTIES
What makes the problem of lags even worse is
that economists are not very accurate in forecasting what will happen in the economy.
For example, a classic problem policymakers face when the economy appears to be slow-
ing down is knowing whether the slowdown is temporary or will persist. Unfortunately,
stabilization policy cannot be effective without accurate forecasting. If economic fore-
casters predict an overheated economy and the government adopts a contractionary pol-
icy, the result could be disastrous if the economy weakened before the policy took effect.
Today, most economic policymakers understand these limitations and are cautious in
using activist policies.
THE FEDERAL BUDGET
The federal budget
the document that describes what the federal government
spends and how it pays for that spending
provides the framework for fiscal policy. In
this section, we will take a closer look at federal spending and taxation and what
happens when one exceeds the other. The federal budget is extremely large, and the
programs that the federal government supports are very complex. To give you a sense
of the magnitude of the budget, in 2009 total federal spending was approximately
24.7 percent of GDP, or $3.52 trillion. Federal taxes were 14.8 percent of GDP. With
a U.S. population of about 300 million, total federal spending amounted to approxi-
mately $11,722 per person.
Probably the best way to begin to grasp the scope and complexities of the U.S.
federal budget is to look at recent data to see where we spend money and how we raise
it. As we explore the budgetary data, keep in mind that the government runs its bud-
get on a fiscal-year basis, not a calendar-year basis. Fiscal year 2009, for example, began
on October 1, 2008, and ended on September 30, 2009.
States and local governments also provide government services and collect taxes.
Some important services (for example, education) are primarily funded by state and
local governments, and others, such as welfare and health care for the poor, are funded
jointly by the federal government and state governments. However, because our focus
in this chapter is on federal fiscal policy, we will concentrate our discussion on federal
spending and taxation.
Federal Spending
Federal spending, spending by the U.S. government, consists of two broad compo-
nents: federal government purchases of goods and services and transfer payments. As
you should recall from our discussion of GDP accounting, only federal government
purchases of goods and services are included in GDP. Transfer payments, although an
important part of the federal budget, are not a component of GDP because they do
not represent any currently produced goods or services.
To study the components of federal spending, we will look at the final data from
fiscal year 2007 provided by the Congressional Budget Office, a nonpartisan agency of
Congress that provides both budgetary forecasts and historical data on the budget.

Lets begin with the broad categories of the budget. Total spending, or outlays, in
fiscal year 2009 were $3,518 billion or approximately 24.7 percent of GDP. Three
components of the budget comprise this total: discretionary spending, entitlements
and mandatory spending, and net interest.
Discretionary spending constitutes all the programs that Congress authorizes
on an annual basis that are not automatically funded by prior laws. It includes defense
spending and all nondefense domestic spending. When people commonly discuss fed-
eral spending, they often focus on this category, which includes the Defense
Department, the Environmental Protection Agency, the State Department, the
Interior Department, and other agencies. However, discretionary spending is less
than 40 percent of total federal spending. Total nondefense spending is about 4 per-
cent of GDP.
Congress and the president can use discretionary funds directly for activist fiscal
policy. To stimulate the economy, they can authorize additional spending by govern-
ment agencies, or they can urge agencies to accelerate their current spending plans.
However, it does take time for bureaucracies to act, and just because Congress autho-
rizes new spending does not mean the agencies will spend the funds immediately.
Entitlement and mandatory spending constitutes all spending that Congress
has authorized by prior law. These expenditures must be made by the federal govern-
ment unless Congress changes the laws. The terms entitlement and mandatory spend-
ing are not totally accurate, however. Individuals are entitled  to benefits only to the
extent they meet the requirements passed by Congress. Congress can always change
the rules. Similarly, this category of spending is mandatory  only to the extent
Congress maintains the current programs in place.
Entitlements and mandatory spending are the single largest component of the
federal budget. One of the most familiar programs is Social Security, which provides
retirement payments to retirees as well as a host of other benefits to widows and fam-
ilies of disabled workers. Medicare provides health care to all individuals once they
reach the age of 65. Medicaid provides health care to the poor, in conjunction with
the states. Spending on these two health programs by the federal government now
exceeds spending on Social Security. The government provides a range of other pro-
grams as well, including additional retirement and disability programs (aside from
Social Security) and farm price supports to provide income to farmers. Some of these
programs are means tested. That is, the amount of benefit is partly based on the income
of the recipient. Medicaid, for example, is a means-tested program.
Net interest is the interest the government pays on the government debt held by
the public, for example, U.S. Treasury bonds, bills, and U.S. savings bonds. We will dis-
cuss how the government borrows money later in the chapter. In fiscal year 2009, total
net interest payments to the public were $187 billion, or approximately 1.3 percent of

GDP. Total expenditures on net interest are directly related to the total government
debt held by the public and the level of interest rates. Increased government debt and
higher interest rates will lead to higher net interest payments by the government.
As the population ages, entitlements and net interest are becoming the fastest-
growing component of the federal budget.
Federal Revenues
The federal government receives its revenue from taxes levied on both individuals and
businesses. Table 10.2 shows the revenues the federal government received in fiscal
year 2009 in both dollar terms and as a percent of GDP.
Lets review the categories that comprise total federal revenue. The single largest
component of federal revenue is the familiar individual income tax. Tax returns calculat-
ing the tax individuals or couples owed during the prior year must be filed by April 15
of every year. During the year, the federal government collects in advance some of the

INCREASING LIFE EXPECTANCY AND AGING POPULATIONS
SPUR COSTS OF ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: Why are the United States and many other
countries facing dramatically increasing costs for their government programs?
As life expectancies increase, the population ages, and new medical technologies
become available to help people live longer, economists and budget analysts predict
that spending on federal retirement and health programs will grow extremely rapidly.
Today, Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid constitute approximately 10 percent
of GDP. Experts estimate that in 2075
when children born today are in their retire-
ment years
spending on these programs will be approximately 22 percent of GDP.
This is a larger share of GDP than all federal government spending today! How will
our society cope with increased demands for these services?
One possibility is to leave the existing programs in place and just raise taxes to pay
for them. This strategy would have two implications. First, if we maintained the fed-
eral share of GDP of all other programs, it would mean a large expansion of federal
government spending, from 20 percent of GDP to 32 percent of GDP. Second, it
would mean a very large increase in the tax burden on future workers and businesses.
Some economists suggest the government should save and invest now to increase
GDP in the future, reducing the burden on future generations. However, the saving
and investment would increase GDP, and entitlement payments would grow right
along with it. As a result, the relative burden of taking care of the elderly would not
change dramatically.
Another strategy is to try to reform the entitlement systems, placing more
responsibility on individuals and families for their retirement and well-being. For
example, we could increase the age at which retirement benefits begin to be paid, and
thereby encourage individuals to spend more years in the labor force. Or we could try
to reform the health-care system to encourage more competition to reduce health-
care expenditures.
All these changes would be very difficult to make, however. Other countries,
including Japan and many nations in Europe, which have even older populations and
low birth rates, will face more severe challenges and face them earlier than the United
States will. Perhaps we can learn from them. Nonetheless, pressures on the federal
budget will begin to escalate in the next decade, and policymakers will need to take
steps soon to cope with the challenge.

taxes due by withholding a portion of workers  paychecks. Taxpayers not subject to with-
holding or who earn income through investments must make estimated tax payments
each quarter, so the tax due the federal government is paid evenly over the year in
which it is earned.
The second-largest component of federal revenue is social insurance taxes, which
are taxes levied on earnings to pay for Social Security and Medicare. Today, social
insurance taxes are almost as large as individual income taxes, and together they com-
prise nearly 80 percent of total federal revenue. Unlike individual income taxes, social
insurance taxes are paid only on wages and not on income from investments.
Other taxes paid directly by individuals and families include estate and gift taxes,
excise taxes, and custom duties. Estate and gift taxes, sometimes known as the death
tax,  are levied on the estates and previous gifts of individuals when they pass away. In
2009 estates were taxed only if they exceeded a threshold of $3.5 million
so small
estates did not pay this tax. In 2010 the estate tax was allowed to expire but it was
expected to be revived and changed in 2010
otherwise the law dictated that much
lower thresholds would be in place in 2011. The estate and gift tax was expected to
raise only 0.2 percent of total federal revenue in fiscal year 2009, but it generated a
great deal of controversy. Opponents of the tax argue that it destroys family-held busi-
nesses, such as family farms passed down from one generation to the next. Proponents
claim the tax is necessary to prevent what they see as unfair accumulation of wealth
across generations.
The corporate tax is a tax levied on the earnings of corporations. This tax raised
less than 7 percent of total federal revenues during fiscal year 2009. The tax was a
more important source of revenue in past decades but has declined to today s rela-
tively low level. This decline has been attributed to many factors, including falling
corporate profits as a share of GDP, the growth of opportunities for tax shelters,
incentives provided by Congress to stimulate business investment and research and
development, and complex rules for taxing multinational corporations that operate on
a global basis. It was especially low in 2009 because corporate profits fell sharply dur-
ing the recession.
The other sources of government revenue are relatively minor. Federal excise taxes
are taxes levied on the sale of certain products, for example, gasoline, tires, firearms,
alcohol, and tobacco. Custom duties are taxes levied on goods imported to the United
States, such as foreign cars or wines.
SUPPLY-SIDE ECONOMICS AND THE LAFFER CURVE
Is it possible for a gov-
ernment to cut tax rates yet still raise more revenue? Thats a politicians dream. People
would face lower tax rates, yet there would be more money for politicians to spend.
Economist Arthur Laffer argued in the late 1970s that there was a strong possibility we
could do this in the U.S. economy. Laffers views influenced many politicians at the
time and became the basis for supply-side economics. Supply-side economics is a
school of thought that emphasizes the role taxes play in the supply of output in the
economy. Supply-side economists look at the effects of taxes not just on aggregate
demand, as we did earlier in this chapter, but also on aggregate supply. As we saw in
Chapter 7, a decrease in tax rates will typically tend to increase labor supply and output.
Thus, changes in taxes can also shift the aggregate supply curve.

Laffer also developed a model known today as the Laffer curve. Suppose a gov-
ernment imposed extremely high tariffs (taxes) on imported goods
tariffs so high
that no one could afford to import any goods whatsoever. If this were the case, the
government would not collect any revenue from the tariffs. But if the government cut
the rates and individuals began to buy imported goods, the government would start to
collect at least some tariff revenue. This was Laffer s point: Lower taxes (tariffs) could
actually lead to higher government revenues.
Virtually all economists today believe Laffers tax revenue idea won t work when it
comes to broad-based income taxes or payroll taxes. For these types of taxes, cutting
rates from their current levels would simply reduce the revenues the government col-
lects, because most economists believe the supply of labor is not as sensitive to
changes in tax rates as Laffer believed it was. But there are some taxes, such as tariffs
or taxes on the gains investors earn by holding stocks and bonds, for which Laffer s
claim is plausible.
The Federal Deficit and Fiscal Policy
The federal government runs a budget deficit when it spends more than it receives in
tax revenues in a given year. Here is how it works. Suppose a government wishes to
spend $100 billion but receives only $95 billion in tax revenue. To actually spend the
$100 billion, the government must obtain funds from some source. Facing a $5 billion
shortfall, it will borrow that money from the public by selling the public government
bonds. A government bond is an IOU in which the government promises to later pay
back the money lent to it, with interest. Thus, when the public purchases $5 billion of
these bonds, it transfers $5 billion to the government. Later the public will receive its
$5 billion back with interest.
A P P L I C AT I O N 2
THE CONFUCIUS CURVE?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: How are tax rates and tax revenues related?
While the idea that cutting tax rates might actually increase tax revenue is often attrib-
uted to economist Arthur Laffer, in fact, it is actually a much older idea than that. Yu
Juo, one of the 12 wise men who succeeded Confucius in ancient China, had a very
similar idea. He was asked by Duke Ai, It has been a year of famine and there are not
enough revenues to run the state. What should I do?
Juo said, Why can t you use a 10 percent tax?
The Duke answered, I can t even get by on a 20 percent tax; how am I going
to do it on 10 percent?
Juo said, If the people have enough what prince can be in want? If the peo-
ple are in want how can the Prince be satisfied?
Clearly, Yu Juo was skeptical that raising rates would raise revenues and advocated for
lower tax rates.
Today, revenue estimators in Washington, D.C., do not share entirely in Yu Juos
wisdom. But they do recognize that cutting tax rates will stimulate economic activity,
which will offset some of the loss in potential revenues to the government.

budget deficit
The amount by which government

215
PART 4
If the government collects more in taxes than it wishes to spend in a given year, it
is running a budget surplus. In this case, the government has excess funds and can
buy back bonds it previously sold to the public, eliminating some of its debt.
Many political and economic considerations enter into the decisions to change gov-
ernment spending or taxes or raise or lower deficits. In the last part of this chapter we will
see how fiscal policy has been used historically in the United States. In later chapters, we
will look in more depth at other political considerations that influence fiscal policy.
Automatic Stabilizers
Both government spending and tax revenues are very sensitive to the state of the
economy. Because tax collections are based largely on individual and corporate
income, tax revenues will fall sharply during a recession as national income falls.
At the same time, government transfer payments for programs such as unemploy-
ment insurance and food stamps will also tend to increase during a recession. The
result is higher government spending and lower tax collections and the increased
likelihood that the government will run a budget deficit. Similarly, when the econ-
omy grows rapidly, tax collections increase and government expenditures on
transfer payments decrease, and the likelihood of the federal government running
a surplus is greater.
Now suppose an economy had a balanced federal budget
neither deficit nor
surplus. An external shock (such as a dramatic increase in oil prices or drought)
then plunged the economy into a recession. Tax revenues fall and expenditures on
transfer payments increase, resulting in a budget deficit. Believe it or not, the
deficit actually serves a valuable role in stabilizing the economy. It works through
three channels:
1 Increased transfer payments such as unemployment insurance, food stamps, and
other welfare payments increase the income of some households, partly offsetting
the fall in household income.
2 Other households whose incomes are falling pay less in taxes, which partly offsets
the decline in their household income. Because incomes do not fall as much as
they would have in the absence of the deficit, consumption spending does not
decline as much.
3 Because the corporation tax depends on corporate profits and profits fall in a
recession, taxes on businesses also fall. Lower corporate taxes help to prevent busi-
nesses from cutting spending as much as they would otherwise during a recession.
The government deficit itself, in effect, offsets part of the adverse effect of the
recession and thus helps stabilize the economy.
Similarly, during an economic boom, transfer payments fall and tax revenues
increase. This dampens the increase in household income and also the increase in con-
sumption and investment spending that would accompany higher household income
and higher corporate profits. Taxes and transfer payments that stabilize GDP without
requiring explicit actions by policymakers are called automatic stabilizers.
The great virtue of automatic stabilizers is that they do not require explicit action
from the president and Congress to change the law. Given the long inside lags caused
by ideological battles in Washington, D.C., over spending, taxes, and the deficit, it is
fortunate that we have mechanisms in place to dampen economic fluctuations without
requiring explicit and deliberative action.
Are Deficits Bad?
Let s take a closer look at fiscal policy designed to stabilize the economy. If the
budget were initially balanced and the economy plunged into a recession, a budget
deficit would emerge as tax revenues fell and expenditures increased. To combat
automatic stabilizers

the recession, policymakers could then either increase government spending or
cut taxes. Both actions, however, would increase the deficit
an important point
to remember.
Despite concerns about increasing the deficit, this is precisely the right policy. If
policymakers tried to avoid running a deficit by raising taxes or cutting spending, that
would actually make the recession worse. The key lesson here is that during a reces-
sion, we should focus on what our fiscal policy actions do to the economy, not what
they do to the deficit.
Does that mean concerns about the federal budget deficit are misplaced? No,
because in the long run, large budget deficits can have an adverse effect on the econ-
omy. We explore these issues in more detail in a later chapter, but we can easily under-
stand the basic problem. We have seen that when an economy is operating at full
employment, output must be divided between consumption, investment, government
spending, and net exports. Suppose, then, the government cuts taxes for households
and runs a deficit. The reduced taxes will tend to increase consumer spending.
Consumers may save some of the tax cut but will consume the rest. However, because
output is fixed at full employment, some other component of output must be reduced,
or crowded out, which we first discussed in Chapter 7. Crowding out is an example of
the principle of opportunity cost.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  O P P O R T U N I T Y  C O S T
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
In this case, we normally expect that the increased consumption spending will
come at the sacrifice of reduced investment spending. As we have seen, with reduced
investment spending the economy will grow more slowly in the future. Thus, the bud-
get deficit will increase current consumption but slow the growth of the economy in
the future. This is the real concern with prolonged budget deficits.
Another way to understand the concern about long-run deficits is to think of what
happens in the financial markets when the government runs large deficits. As the gov-
ernment runs large deficits, it will have to borrow increasing amounts of money from
the public by selling U.S. government bonds. In the financial markets, the govern-
ment will be in increased competition with businesses that are trying to raise funds
from the public to finance their investment plans, too. This increased competition
from the government will make it more difficult and costly for businesses to raise
funds and, as a result, investment spending will decrease.

using government spending and taxation to sta-
bilize the economy
have been known for many years and, indeed, were discussed in
the 1920s. However, it took a long time before economic policy decisions were based
on these principles. Many people associate active fiscal policy in the United States
with actions taken by President Franklin Roosevelt during the Great Depression of
the 1930s. But this view is misleading, according to E. Cary Brown, a former econom-
ics professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.1
During the 1930s, politicians did not believe in modern fiscal policy, largely
because they feared the consequences of government budget deficits. According to
10.3

217
PART 4
Brown, fiscal policy was expansionary only during two years of the Great
Depression, 1931 and 1936. In those years, Congress voted for substantial pay-
ments to veterans, over objections of presidents Herbert Hoover and Franklin
Roosevelt. Although government spending increased during the 1930s, taxes
increased sufficiently during that same period, with the result that there was no
net fiscal expansion.
The Kennedy Administration
Although modern fiscal policy was not deliberately used during the 1930s, the growth
in military spending at the onset of World War II in 1941 increased total demand in
the economy and helped pull the economy out of its long decade of poor performance.
But to see fiscal policy in action, we need to turn to the 1960s. It was not until the
presidency of John F. Kennedy during the early 1960s that modern fiscal policy came
to be accepted.
Walter Heller, the chairman of the president s Council of Economic Advisers
under John F. Kennedy, was a forceful advocate of active fiscal policy. From his per-
spective, the economy was operating far below its potential, and a tax cut was the
perfect medicine to bring it back to full employment. When Kennedy entered
office, the unemployment rate was 6.7 percent. Heller believed the unemployment
rate at full employment
the natural rate  of unemployment, that is
was really
only about 4 percent. He convinced Kennedy of the need for a tax cut to stimulate
the economy, and Kennedy put forth an economic program based largely on mod-
ern fiscal policy principles.
Two other factors led the Kennedy administration to support the tax cut. First, tax
rates were extremely high at the time. The top individual tax rate was 91 percent,
compared to about 40 percent today. The corporate tax rate was 52 percent, compared
to 35 percent today. Second, Heller convinced Kennedy that even if a tax cut led to a
federal budget deficit, it was not a problem. In 1961, the federal deficit was less than
1 percent of GDP, and future projections indicated it would disappear as the economy
grew because of higher tax revenues.
The tax cuts were enacted in February 1964, after Lyndon Johnson became pres-
ident following Kennedy s assassination. They included permanent cuts in rates for
both individuals and corporations. Estimating the actual effects these tax cuts had on
the economy is difficult. To make a valid comparison, we need to estimate how the
economy would have behaved without them. What we do know is that the economy
grew at a rapid rate following the tax cuts. From 1963 to 1966, both real GDP and
consumption grew at rates exceeding 4 percent per year. We cannot rule out the pos-
sibility that the economy could have grown just as rapidly without the tax cuts.
Nonetheless, the rapid growth during this period suggests the tax cuts had the effect,
predicted by Hellers theory, of stimulating economic growth.
The Vietnam War Era
The next major use of modern fiscal policy occurred in 1968. As the Vietnam War
began and military spending increased, unemployment fell to very low levels.
From 1966 to 1969, the overall unemployment rate fell below 4 percent.
Policymakers became concerned that the economy was overheating and this would
lead to a higher inflation rate. In 1968, a temporary tax surcharge of 10 percent
was enacted to reduce total demand for goods and services. The 10 percent sur-
charge was a tax on a tax,  so it raised the taxes paid by households by 10 percent.
Essentially, the surcharge was specifically designed to be temporary and expired
within a year.
The surcharge did not decrease consumer spending as much as economists had
initially estimated, however. Part of the reason was that it was temporary. Economists
who have studied consumption behavior have noticed that consumers often base their

CHAPTER 10
FISCAL POLICY
218
spending on an estimate of their long-run average income, or permanent income,
not on their current income.
For example, consider a salesperson who usually earns $50,000 a year, although
her income in any single year might be slightly higher or lower. Knowing her perma-
nent income is $50,000, she consumes $45,000. If her income in one year is higher
than average, say $55,000, she is still likely to consume $45,000 (as if she earned just
her normal $50,000) and save the rest.
The one-year tax surcharge during the Vietnam War had a similar effect.
Because consumers knew the surcharge was not permanent, they didn t alter their
spending habits very much. The surtax reduced households  savings, not their con-
sumption. The result was a smaller decrease in demand for goods and services than
economists anticipated.
During the 1970s, there were many changes in taxes and spending but no major
changes in overall fiscal policy. A recession in 1973 led to a tax rebate and other incen-
tives in 1975, but, by and large, changes to fiscal policy were mild.
The Reagan Administration
The tax cuts enacted during 1981 at the beginning of the first term of President
Ronald Reagan were significant. However, they were not proposed to increase aggre-
gate demand. Instead, the tax cuts were justified on the basis of improving economic
incentives and increasing the supply of output. In other words, they were supply-side
motivated. Taxes can have important effects on the supply of labor, saving, and eco-
nomic growth. Proponents of the 1981 tax cuts emphasized these particular effects
and not increases in aggregate demand. Nonetheless, the tax cuts did appear to
increase consumer demand and helped the economy recover from the back-to-back
recessions in the early 1980s.
By the mid-1980s, large government budget deficits began to emerge, and policy-
makers became concerned. As the deficits grew and became the focus of attention,
interest in using fiscal policy to manage the economy waned because policymakers
placed primary concern on deficit reduction, not stabilization policy. Although there
were government spending and tax changes in the 1980s and 1990s, few were justified
solely as policies to change aggregate demand.
The Clinton and George W. Bush Administrations
At the beginning of his administration, President Bill Clinton proposed a stimu-
lus package  that would increase aggregate demand, but it was defeated in
Congress. Clinton later successfully passed a major tax increase that brought the
budget into balance. A Republican-controlled Congress that had different priori-
ties than the Clinton administration limited government spending. By 1998, the
federal budget actually began to show surpluses rather than deficits, setting the
stage for tax cuts.
During his first year in office in 2001, President George W. Bush passed a 10-year
tax cut plan that decreased tax rates, in part to eliminate the government surpluses and
return revenues to households, but also to stimulate the economy that was slowing
down as the high-tech investment boom was ending.
The first year of the tax cut featured tax rebates or refunds of up to $600 per mar-
ried couple. The refunds were intended to increase aggregate demand.
After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, President Bush and Congress
became less concerned with balancing the federal budget and authorized new spend-
ing programs to provide relief to victims and to stimulate the economy, which had
entered into a recession prior to September 11.
In May 2003, President Bush signed another tax bill to stimulate the sluggish
economy and, in particular, to increase investment spending. This bill had many dis-
tinct features, including moving up some of the previously scheduled cuts in tax rates

that were part of the 2001 tax bill, increasing the child tax credit, and lowering taxes
on dividends and capital gains.
In 2008, a slowing economy led President Bush and Congress to adopt tax
rebates and some investment incentives in early 2008. The tax cuts were relatively
large, approximately 1 percent of GDP, and the rebates, some as large as $1,800,
were designed to reach 128 million households. As we noted in the chapter opener,
President Obama and Congress enacted the largest stimulus package in history in
February 2009. Although it was likely to have some positive impact on employment
and GDP growth, its size and composition proved to be controversial. 
The combination of the 2001 and 2007 recessions, the financial crisis of 2008
and its aftermath, the various tax cuts, the large stimulus package of 2009, and the
increased expenses associated with the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq sharply changed
the fiscal landscape from the beginning of the decade. Although the deficit tem-
porarily became smaller in 2006 and 2007, the situation changed radically. By fiscal
year 2009 the deficit had soared to 9.9 percent of GDP, far above usual historical
levels. Future projections indicated that the deficit would likely fall, but still remain
high for future years.
Figure 10.3 plots the course of spending, taxes, and the deficit since 1996 and
shows the recent reemergence of deficits from the surpluses of the late 1990s and the
dramatic deficits in 2009. The prospect of future deficits may limit the ability of the
U.S. government to conduct expansionary fiscal policy in the near future and will set
the background for the political debates in Washington, D.C., for many years to come.

EVALUATING THE OBAMA FISCAL STIMULUS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Did President Obama s fiscal stimulus work
as expected?
As part of President Obama s fiscal stimulus package, the Council of Economic
Advisers was required to make quarterly reports to the Congress on the role that the
stimulus package played in economic recovery. The chairperson of the council,
Christina Romer from U.C., Berkeley, was charged with the difficult task of assessing
the efficacy of the stimulus package and the council delivered its first report to the
Congress in September 2009.
The council examined the effects of the stimulus project in several ways. First, it
used statistical methods to suggest that both employment and economic growth were
higher in the second and third quarters of 2009 then would have been predicted by
statistical models. This method, however, does not distinguish between the effects of
the stimulus package and other economic interventions such as monetary policy.
Second, the council used conventional economic models to estimate the effects of the
stimulus
essentially assuming conventional multipliers for government spending
and taxes. Third, the council compared international experiences of countries that
used different stimulus strategies and argued that those countries that had the most
ambitious programs of fiscal stimulus improved the most.
The council estimated that the stimulus package avoided a loss of about 1 million
jobs by August 2009. But critics pointed out that unemployment was near 10 percent
and most forecasters were still projecting high unemployment for several years. Even
if the stimulus package did have a positive effect, the lingering effects of the recession
would still be painful.

Federal Taxes, Spending, and Deficits, 1996 2009
This chapter explored the
role of government fiscal
policy. Using the AD AS
model, we showed how
fiscal policy can stabilize
the economy. We also
discussed the multiplier and the limits to stabilization policy. In
addition, the chapter gave us an overview of the federal bud-
get, including spending, revenues, deficits, and surpluses.
Finally, we explored how fiscal policy in the United States has
changed over time. Here are the key points:
1 Increases in government spending or decreases in taxes will
increase aggregate demand.
2 Decreases in government spending or increases in taxes will
decrease aggregate demand.
3 Because of the multiplier, the total shift in the aggregate
demand curve will be larger than the initial shift.
Policymakers need to take the multiplier into account as they
formulate policy.
4 Both inside lags (the time it takes to formulate policy) and
outside lags (the time it takes the policy to work) limit the
effectiveness of active fiscal policy.
5 The largest component of federal spending is entitlements
and mandatory programs.
6 The largest components of federal revenues are income
taxes and social insurance taxes collected from individuals.
7 Government deficits act as an automatic stabilizer that helps
to stabilize the economy in the short run.
8 In the short run, fiscal policy actions taken to combat a reces-
sion will increase the deficit; in the long run, deficits are a
concern because they may lead to the crowding out of
investment spending.
9 Active fiscal policy has been periodically used in the United
States to stimulate the economy; at other times, concerns
about deficits have limited the use of fiscal policy.

The Role of Fiscal Policy
1.1
To decrease aggregate demand, a government can
either decrease spending or 
taxes.
1.2
Contractionary fiscal policy shifts the aggregate
demand curve to the 
, 
prices, and 
real GDP.
1.3
If the multiplier for taxation is 1.10, then a $110 bil-
lion increase in taxes will ultimately shift the demand
curve by

1.4
lags refer to the time it takes for policy-
makers to recognize an economic problem and take
appropriate actions.
1.5
A Chinese Experiment. In 2000 the Chinese govern-
ment mandated three one-week holidays throughout
the year to stimulate consumer spending. The idea was
that these extended vacations would induce the Chinese
to spend more of their earnings while on vacation.
a. Using the AD AS framework, show the mechanism
through which the Chinese government believed that
the mandated holidays would stimulate the economy.
b. Although consumption spending rose during the
vacation period, the data show that consumption fell
before and after the vacation. Did the policy work?
1.6
Time-Dated Certificates as Fiscal Policies.When
Japan faced a decade-long recession in the 1990s,
many ideas were offered to combat the recession.
Here is one unusual fiscal policy: The government
would issue time-dated certificates to each person that
had to be spent on goods and services within a fixed
period (say, three months) or become worthless.
Suppose the government was considering whether to
issue $400 in time-dated certificates to each household
or give each household $400 in cash instead.
a. Which plan would lead to the greatest econo-
mic stimulus?
b. Which plan do you think the government would
find easier to administer?
c. Suppose a household had large credit card debt,
which it wished to reduce. Which of the two plans
would that household prefer?
1.7
Political Systems and the Inside Lag for Fiscal
Policy. Under a parliamentary system like in Britain,
there are fewer checks and balances on the government
than in the United States. In a parliamentary system, the
party that controls the legislature also runs the executive
branch. How do you think the inside lag for fiscal policy
in England compares to that in the United States?
1.8
Looking Backward. Some critics of stabilization policy
say that policymakers are always looking backward
through a rear view mirror at past data
and thus
10.1
cannot conduct stabilization policy. Can you give a
defense for policymakers despite the fact that they must
look at past data?

Using each of the following assumptions, do you think
the forecasters were correct? Answer yes or no.
a. Taxpayers were not aware they would receive refunds
until they had completed their income tax statements.
b. Taxpayers did know they would receive refunds but,
as consumers, based their spending decisions solely
on their current levels of income.
c. Taxpayers did know they would receive refunds
and, as consumers, based their consumption
decisions on their permanent incomes.

The Most Effective Part of the Stimulus Package.
President Obamas stimulus package contained several

that was most effective was the aid to the states.

The Income-Expenditure
Model
C H A P T E R
Heading into the global recession in 2007, the Chinese
economy was growing at the extraordinary rate of
11 percent per year. As Chinese policymakers began to
see the severity of the oncoming global recession, they
became concerned that real GDP growth would fall below
the 7 percent level they needed to incorporate the influx of
new entrants into the labor force. As a consequence, they
embarked on a massive stimulus package, more in the spirit
of Keynes than Mao.
In late 2008 the Chinese government announced it was
undertaking a stimulus plan equivalent to $586 billion in
U.S. dollars. This was a massive program, approximately
13 percent of GDP. Public infrastructure was the largest sin-
gle component of the plan, with investments for new rail-
ways, roads, irrigation, and transportation. Another major
component of the plan was funds to restore the damage
caused by the severe earthquakes that had hit Sichuan
province earlier in the year. Additional funds in the pack-
age were allocated for housing, social programs, and
human capital.
Since China was already embarking on a state-run, large-
scale investment program, it was able to put these pro-
grams into effect rather quickly. That was in sharp contrast to
the United States, which needed to gear up new programs
to spend funds on infrastructure. As a result, China man-
aged to avoid the worst of the global recession, with real GDP growth around 9 percent for both 2008 and
2009. A robust Chinese economy also helped the other economies in the world to recover as well.1

THE INCOME-EXPENDITURE MODEL

ewspaper and television stories about the economy tend to focus on what
causes changes in short-term real GDP. For example, we often read about
how changes in economic conditions in Europe or Asia or changes in gov-
ernment spending or taxation will affect near-term economic growth. To understand
these stories, we need to understand the behavior of the economy in the short run.
As we have seen, in the short run changes in aggregate demand play the key role in
determining the level of output. In the short run, prices are slow to change, and there-
fore fluctuations in aggregate demand translate directly into fluctuations in GDP and
income. In this chapter, we take a more detailed look at short-run fluctuations in GDP.
The model we develop in this chapter is called the income-expenditure model, some-
times referred to as the Keynesian cross. The model was developed by the economist
John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s and later extended and refined by many econo-
mists. When Keynes developed his approach to macroeconomics, the world economy
was in the midst of a severe depression. Unlike many other economists at the time,
Keynes did not believe the economy would return to full employment by itself. An
economy could get trapped  in a depression and not recover.
Keynes provided both a diagnosis of an economic depression and a cure. He argued
that the fundamental problem causing the world depression was insufficient demand
for goods and services. Here was the problem: Firms would not increase their produc-
tion and put the unemployed back to work unless there was sufficient demand for
the goods and services they produced. But consumers and firms would not demand
enough goods and services unless the economy improved and their incomes were
higher. Keynes argued that active fiscal policy
increasing government spending or cut-
ting taxes
could increase total demand for goods and services and bring the economy
back to full employment. This income-expenditure model is based on the idea that
higher expenditures were necessary to generate higher levels of income in the economy.
The income-expenditure model focuses on changes in the level of output or real
GDP. However, it does not take into account changes in prices. The model is thus
very useful for understanding economic fluctuations in the short run when prices do
not change very much. It is less useful in the intermediate or longer run, when prices
do adjust to economic conditions. For intermediate or longer-run analysis, we need to
use the aggregate demand and aggregate supply curves to understand movements in
both output and prices.
In this chapter, we focus on the short run. In the last part of this chapter, we show
how Keynes s income-expenditure model also provides an important building block
for our model of aggregate demand. In later chapters, we will incorporate financial
markets into our discussion of aggregate demand.
This chapter will primarily use graphical tools to explain the income-expenditure
model. An appendix to the chapter provides an algebraic treatment of the model and
shows how some of the key formulas are derived.
A SIMPLE INCOME-EXPENDITURE MODEL
First, we will develop a very simple income-expenditure model to illustrate the ideas
of Keynes. Later in the chapter, we will expand the income-expenditure model to
make it more realistic.
Equilibrium Output
Lets begin with the simplest income-expenditure model. It uses a graph like Figure 11.1,
with total expenditures for goods and services represented on the vertical axis, output (y)
represented on the horizontal axis, and a 45° line. The 45° line marks all the points on the
graph at which the value of the variable measured on the horizontal axis (output) equals
the value of the variable measured on the vertical axis (total expenditures). In our most
basic model, we temporarily omit the government and the foreign sector. Only consumers

and firms can demand output: Consumers demand consumption goods, and firms demand
investment goods. We make things even simpler by assuming that consumers and firms
each demand a fixed amount of goods. Let consumption demand be an amount C, and let
investment demand be an amount I. Total demand will be C + I. Total demand for goods
and services is also called planned expenditures. Thus, planned expenditures in this sim-
ple economy are equal to C + I.
In the income-expenditure model, we assume firms supply all the output that is
demanded. This means the short-run aggregate supply curve is flat, so firms will pro-
duce whatever is demanded without changing their prices. This assumption is reason-
able in the short run.
Because firms are willing to supply whatever is demanded, demand is the key fac-
tor in determining the level of output, or GDP. In the income-expenditure model, the
level of output will adjust to equal the level of planned expenditures. We call the level
of output the equilibrium output.
Lets denote the level of equilibrium output as y*. Then the level of equilibrium
output will be
At equilibrium output, planned expenditures for goods and services equal the level of
output or GDP.
Figure 11.2 can help us understand how the level of equilibrium output, or GDP,
in the economy is determined. On the expenditure-output graph, we superimpose the
line representing planned expenditures, C + I, which is a horizontal line because both
C and I are fixed amounts. Because planned expenditures are fixed at C + I, they do not
depend on the level of output. Equilibrium output is at y*, the level of output at which
the planned expenditure line crosses the 45° line. The two lines cross at point a, where
output measured on the horizontal axis equals planned expenditures by consumers
and firms measured on the vertical axis. Recall that on a 45° line the value on the hor-
izontal axis equals the value on the vertical axis.
Adjusting to Equilibrium Output
What would happen if the economy were producing at a higher level of output, such
as y1 in Figure 11.3? At that level of output, more goods and services are being pro-
duced than consumers and firms are demanding. Goods that are produced but not
purchased will pile up on the shelves of stores. Firms will react to these piles of goods

expenditure equals the amount that is
produced.

by cutting back on production. The level of output will fall until the economy reaches
y*, as indicated by the leftward arrow in Figure 11.3.
If the economy were producing at a lower level of output, y2, planned expendi-
tures would exceed total output. Firms would find that the demand for consumption
and investment goods is greater than their current production. Inventories now disap-
pear from the shelves of stores, and firms face increasing backlogs of orders for their
products. They respond by stepping up production, so GDP increases back to y*, as
indicated by the rightward arrow in Figure 11.3.

Table 11.1 also helps to illustrate the process that determines equilibrium output.
The table shows, with a numerical example, what happens to production when planned
expenditures do not equal output. Planned expenditures, consumption (C) plus invest-
ment (I), equal $100 billion. In the first row, we see that if current production is only

PART 4
$80 billion, stocks of inventories will be depleted by $20 billion, so firms will increase
output to restore their inventory levels. In the third row, production is at $120 billion,
creating an excess of inventories of $20 billion, and firms will cut back production. In
the second row, planned expenditures equal output, so neither inventories nor produc-
tion changes.
Be sure you remember that the equilibrium level of output occurs where planned
expenditures equal production. If the economy were not producing at that level, we
would find either that the demand for goods was too great relative to production, or
that there was insufficient demand relative to production. In either case, the economy
would rapidly adjust to reach the equilibrium level of output.
THE CONSUMPTION FUNCTION
To make the income-expenditure model more realistic, we will need to introduce
other components of demand, including the government and the foreign sector. But
first we need to recognize that consumers  planned expenditures will depend on their
level of income.
Consumer Spending and Income
Lets begin by reviewing the consumption function we first introduced in Chapter 9.
The consumption function describes the relationship between desired spending by
consumers and the level of income. When consumers have more income, they will
want to purchase more goods and services.
As we have seen, a simple consumption function can be described by the equation
in which total consumption spending, C, has two parts. The first part, Ca, is called
autonomous consumption, and it does not directly depend on the level of income.
The second part, by, represents the part of consumption that does depend on income.
It is the product of the fraction b, called the marginal propensity to consume
(MPC), and level of income in the economy, y. The MPC, which has a value of b in
our formula, tells us how much consumption spending will increase for every dollar
that income increases. If b equals 0.7, then for every $1 that income increases, con-
sumption would increase by 0.7 * $1, or $0.70.
In our simple income-expenditure model, output is also equal to the income that flows
to households. As firms produce output, they pay households income in the form of
wages, interest, profits, and rents. We can therefore use y to represent both output
and income.
We plot a consumption function in Figure 11.4. The consumption function is a
line that intersects the vertical axis at Ca, the level of autonomous consumption
spending, which is typically greater than zero (therefore, it has a positive intercept).
The slope of the consumption function equals b, the marginal propensity to con-
sume. Although output is plotted on the horizontal axis, remember that it is also
equal to income, so income rises dollar for dollar with output. That is why we can
plot the consumption function, which depends on income, on the same graph that
determines output.
Changes in the Consumption Function
The consumption function is determined by the level of autonomous consumption
and by the MPC. The level of autonomous consumption can change, and so can the
MPC. Changes in either shift the consumption function to another position on the
graph. A higher level of autonomous consumption but no change in MPC will shift
the entire consumption function upward and parallel to its original position. More

consumption occurs at every level of income. We show an increase in autonomous
consumption in Panel A of Figure 11.5.
A number of factors can cause autonomous consumption to change. Here are two:
Increases in consumer wealth will cause an increase in autonomous
consumption. Wealth consists of the value of stocks, bonds, and consumer
durables (consumer goods that last a long time, such as automobiles and refrig-
erators). Note that a person s wealth is not the same as income. Income is the
amount of money someone earns during a period, such as in a given year,
whereas wealth represents the persons total net worth. Nobel Laureate Franco
Modigliani found that increases in stock prices, which raise consumer wealth,
will lead to increases in autonomous consumption. Conversely, a sharp fall in
stock prices will lead to a decrease in autonomous consumption.
Increases in consumer confidence will increase autonomous consumption.
Forecasters pay attention to consumer confidence, a measure based on house-
hold surveys of how positive consumers are feeling about the future, because it

helps them to predict consumption spending. The Conference Board, a non-
profit organization devoted to disseminating economic analysis, publishes an
index of consumer confidence each month that many forecasters rely on.
A change in the marginal propensity to consume will cause a change in the slope of
the consumption function. We show an increase in the MPC in Panel B of Figure 11.5,
where we assume autonomous consumption is fixed. As the MPC increases, the con-
sumption function rotates upward, counterclockwise. This rotation means the con-
sumption function line gets steeper.
EQUILIBRIUM OUTPUT AND THE
CONSUMPTION FUNCTION
Using the consumption function, we can now begin to look at more complex versions
of the income-expenditure model. We continue to assume investment spending, I,
does not depend on the level of income. The only difference between what we did in
the preceding section and what we are about to do here is that we now recognize con-
sumption increases with the level of income. Figure 11.6 shows how GDP is

FALLING HOME PRICES, THE WEALTH EFFECT, AND
DECREASED CONSUMER SPENDING
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How do changes in the value of homes affect
consumer spending?
The value of homes in excess of what people borrow with a mortgage is known as their
home equity. Home equity is the single largest component of net wealth for most fam-
ilies in the United States. Compared to wealth holdings in the stock market, which
tend to be concentrated in the highest income brackets, home-equity wealth is more
widely dispersed across the income spectrum. Changes in the value of home equity
like other forms of wealth
affect consumer spending.
The period from 1997 to mid-2006 was paradise for consumers. Housing prices
rose nationally by approximately 90 percent and consumer wealth grew by $6.5 trillion
dollars over that period. The party ended in the summer of 2006 as housing prices
began to fall. In some regions of the country, where housing prices had risen most
sharply, they fell from their peak by about 30 percent. No longer were households refi-
nancing their mortgages and pulling out money to buy new cars, boats, or other con-
sumer durables. Instead, many recent home purchasers actually owed more than their
homes were worth
and, as a result, some defaulted on their loans and turned their
property over to lenders. How do these changes affect consumer spending?
In its review of the literature, the Congressional Budget Office found most stud-
ies estimated a decrease of consumer wealth of $1 would lower consumption spending
by somewhere between $0.02 and $0.07. Based on forecasts for housing prices, the
Congressional Budget Office estimated the declines in housing prices would reduce
consumer wealth and ultimately consumer spending between $21 and $72 billion or
subtract 0.1 to 0.5 percentage points from economic growth during 2007. This partly
explains the reduced rate of economic growth that occurred during that year.

determined. We first plot the consumption function, C, as before: A sloping line
graphically representing that consumption spending is a function of income. Because
we are assuming investment is constant at all levels of income, to get the C + I line, we
can simply vertically add the constant level of investment I to the consumption func-
tion. Adding vertically gives us the C + I line, which represents total planned expendi-
tures in the economy. This line is upward sloping because consumption spending
increases with income. At any level of income, we now know the level of total planned
expenditures, C + I.
The level of equilibrium output, y*, occurs where the planned expenditure line
C + I crosses the 45° line. At this level of output, planned expenditures equal output.
At any other level of production, planned expenditures will not equal output, and the
economy will adjust back to y* for the same reasons and in the same way as in the cor-
responding example in the preceding section.
In the appendix to this chapter, we show that the equilibrium output in this sim-
ple economy is
or, in the mathematical terms representing those words,
From this relationship and the numerical values for Ca, b, and I, we can calculate equi-
librium output. Suppose
This means the consumption function is C = 100 + 0.6y. Then, using our formula for

231
PART 4
Saving and Investment
We can determine equilibrium output another way, which highlights the relationship
between saving and investment. To understand this relationship, recall that in an
economy without taxation or government, the value of output, or production (y),
equals the value of income. Households receive this income and either consume it (C),
save it (S), or a combination of both. We can therefore say that saving equals output
minus consumption or, in mathematical terms,
In our simple economy, output is determined by planned expenditures, C + I, or
If we subtract consumption from both sides of this equation, we have
But we just saw that the left side, y  C, equals saving, S, so we have
Thus, equilibrium output is determined at the level of income where savings
equal investment.
However, the level of savings in the economy is not fixed. A savings function
describes the relationship between savings and the level of income. Total savings will
increase with the level of GDP. Recall from Chapter 9 the concept of the marginal
propensity to save (MPS): It is the ratio of additional savings to additional income.
Since households will increase their total savings as their income increases, total sav-
ings will increase with GDP.
Figure 11.7 illustrates how equilibrium income is determined where savings
equals investment. The horizontal line is a fixed level of investment in the economy.
The upward-sloping line is the savings function. The two lines intersect at the equi-
librium level of output, y*.

To illustrate these ideas with a numerical example, let s return to the previous case
in which the consumption function is C = 100 + 0.6y. Because S = y  C, saving is
This equation is the savings function for this example. The marginal propensity
to save (MPS) is 0.4. That means that for every dollar y increases, saving increases by
$0.40. Notice the slope of the savings function is the MPS.
 S = -100 + 0.4 y
 S = y - (100 + 0.6 y)

CHAPTER 11
THE INCOME-EXPENDITURE MODEL
232
In our previous example, investment was 40 and equilibrium output was 350. Lets
check that saving does equal that level of investment. Plugging in the value of equilib-
rium output, or income, into the savings function, we get
So saving equals investment at the level of equilibrium output.
Understanding the Multiplier
In all economies, investment spending fluctuates. We can use the model we developed
that determines output in the short run, the income-expenditure model, to see what
happens if there are changes in investment spending. Suppose investment spending
originally was I0 and increased to I1
an increase we will call 
(the symbol 
, the
Greek capital letter delta, is universally used to represent change). What happens to
equilibrium output?
Figure 11.8 shows how equilibrium output is determined at the original level of
investment and at the new level of investment. The increase in investment spending
shifts the C + I curve upward by 
. The intersection of the C + I curve with the 45° line
shifts from a0 to a1. GDP increases from y0 to y1 by the amount 
. The figure shows
that the increase in GDP
that is, the amount 
is greater than the increase
in investment
the amount 
or 
. This is a general result: The increase in
output always exceeds the increase in investment because of the multiplier effect we
discussed in the last chapter.
Lets review the logic of the multiplier. Suppose there is an initial increase of invest-
ment spending by $20 million. This additional demand will initially increase output,
income, and aggregate demand by $20 million. Assuming the MPC is 0.8, the $20 mil-
lion in additional income will lead to $16 million in increased consumer spending (the
MPC of 0.8 * $20 million). With an increase in consumer demand of $16 million, out-
put, income, and aggregate demand will therefore increase by another $16 million. In

turn, this will increase consumer spending by another $12.8 million (the MPC of 0.8 *
$16 million). This increased demand will therefore increase output, income, and aggre-
gate demand by $12.8 million, generating further increases in consumer spending of
$10.24 million. As this process continues over time, total spending will continue to
increase, but in diminishing amounts. If we add up all the spending in the (infinite)
rounds, we find the initial increase in investment spending will generate a total increase
in equilibrium income of $100 million, far more than the initial $20 million with which
we began. In this case, the multiplier is 5 (5 * $20 million = $100 million).
We show how to derive the formula for a simple multiplier in the appendix to
this chapter:
Suppose the MPC equals 0.8. Then the multiplier would be
Notice that the multiplier increases as the MPC increases. If MPC equals 0.4, the
multiplier is 1.67; if the MPC equals 0.6, the multiplier is 2.5. To see why the multiplier
increases as the marginal propensity to consume increases, think back to our examples
of the multiplier. The multiplier occurs because the initial increase in investment spend-
ing increases income, which leads to higher consumer spending. With a higher MPC,
the increase in consumer spending will be greater, because consumers will spend a
higher fraction of the additional income they receive as the multiplier increases. For
example, if the MPC is 0.8, they will spend an additional $0.80, whereas if the multiplier
was 0.6, they would spend only an additional $0.60. With a higher MPC, the eventual
increase in output will be greater, and therefore so will the multiplier.

USING LONG-TERM MACRO DATA TO MEASURE
MULTIPLIERS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: What evidence does the long historical
record provide about multipliers?
One of the difficulties in estimating multipliers is that during normal times, govern-
ment spending and taxes do not change too much so it is difficult to isolate their
effects on the economy. Economists Robert Barro and Charles Redlick went back in
the historical record to look at times when government expenditures and taxes did
change substantially: during the buildups and aftermaths of major wars.
In their work, they typically found much smaller multipliers for defense expendi-
tures, typically less than one. This means that increases in government spending did
increase the economy, but less than the amount of government spending itself. It also
implies that there must have been crowding out of other components of spending. They
found that multipliers were larger when there was more unemployment in the economy.
Barro and Redlick also suggest that other researchers found larger associations between
government spending and GDP because they had the causality backward
nondefense
spending often rises when GDP grows rapidly. Untangling these issues is a difficult task
for social scientists.

CHAPTER 11
THE INCOME-EXPENDITURE MODEL
234
One implication of the multiplier is that the effect of any change in investment
multiplies  throughout the economy. This explains why economies can often recover
quickly after natural disasters.
GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND TAXATION
We now make our income-expenditure model more realistic by bringing in govern-
ment spending and taxation, which makes the model useful for understanding eco-
nomic policy debates. In those debates, we often hear recommendations for either
increasing government spending or cutting taxes to increase GDP. As we will
explain, both the level of government spending and the level of taxation, through
their influence on the demand for goods and services, affect the level of GDP in the
short run.
Using taxes and spending to influence the level of GDP in the short run is known as
Keynesian fiscal policy. As we discussed in Chapter 7, changes in taxes can also affect the
supply of output in the long run through the way taxes can change incentives to work or
invest. However, in this chapter we concentrate on the role of taxes and spending in
determining demand for goods and services, and therefore output, in the short run.
Fiscal Multipliers
Let s look first at the role government spending plays in determining GDP.
Government purchases of goods and services are a component of total spending:
Increases in government purchases, G, shift the C + I + G line upward, just as increases
in investment, I, or autonomous consumption do. If government spending increases
by $1, the C + I + G line will shift upward by $1.
Panel A of Figure 11.9 shows how increases in government spending affect GDP.
The increase in government spending from G0 to G1 shifts the C + I + G line upward
and increases the level of GDP from y0 to y1.
As you can see, changes in government purchases have exactly the same effects
as changes in investment or changes in autonomous consumption. The multiplier
for government spending is also the same as for changes in investment or
autonomous consumption:
multiplier for government spending =

235
PART 4
For example, if the MPC is 0.6, the multiplier is 2.5:
Therefore, a $10 billion increase in government spending will increase GDP by
$25 billion. The multiplier for government spending works just like the multiplier for
investment or consumption. An initial increase in government spending raises GDP
and income. The increase in income, however, generates further increases in demand
as consumers increase their spending.
Now let s consider taxes. We need to take into account that government pro-
grams affect households  disposable personal income
income that ultimately flows
back to households (and thus consumption) after subtraction from their income of
any taxes paid and after addition to their income of any transfer payments they
receive, such as Social Security, unemployment insurance, or welfare. If the govern-
ment takes $10 net of every $100 you make, your income after taxes and transfer pay-
ments is only $90.
Heres how we include taxes and transfers into the model: We make consumption
spending depend on income after taxes and transfers, or y
 T, where T is net taxes
(taxes paid to government minus transfers received by households). For simplicity,
we ll just refer to T as taxes, but remember that it is taxes less transfer payments. The
consumption function with taxes is
If taxes increase by $1, after-tax income will decrease by $1. Because the marginal
propensity to consume is b, this means consumption will fall by b * $1, and the C + I
+ G line will shift downward by b * $1. For example, if b is 0.6, a $1 increase in taxes
will mean that consumers will have a dollar less of income and will therefore decrease
consumption spending by $0.60.
Panel B of Figure 11.9 shows how an increase in taxes will decrease the level of
GDP. As the level of taxes increases, the demand line will shift downward by b (the
increase in taxes). Equilibrium income will fall from y0 to y1. The multiplier for taxes
is slightly different than the multiplier for government spending. If we cut govern-
ment spending by $1, the C + I + G line will shift downward by $1. However, if we
increase taxes by $1, consumers will cut back their consumption by only b * $1. Thus,
the C + I + G line will shift downward by slightly less than $1, or b * $1. For example,
if b is 0.6, the demand line would shift down vertically by $0.60.
Because the demand line does not shift by the same amount with taxes as it does
with government spending, the formula for the tax multiplier is slightly different.
Heres the formula for the tax multiplier; we show how to derive it in the appendix:
The tax multiplier is negative because increases in taxes decrease disposable per-
sonal income and lead to a reduction in consumption spending. If the MPC is 0.6, the
tax multiplier will be
Notice that the tax multiplier is smaller (in absolute value) than the government
spending multiplier, which for the same MPC is 2.5. The reason the tax multiplier is
smaller is that an increase in taxes first reduces income of households by the amount
of the tax. However, because the MPC is less than one (0.6), the decrease in consumer
spending is less than the increase in taxes.

CHAPTER 11
THE INCOME-EXPENDITURE MODEL
236
Finally, you may wonder what would happen if we increased both government
spending and taxes by an equal amount at the same time. Because the multiplier for
government spending is larger than the multiplier for taxes, equal increases in both
government spending and taxes will increase GDP. Economists call the multiplier for
equal increases in government spending and taxes the balanced-budget multiplier
because equal changes in government spending and taxes will not unbalance the bud-
get. In the appendix we show that the balanced-budget multiplier in our simple model
is always equal to one. For example, if spending and taxes are both increased by
$10 billion, then GDP will also increase by $10 billion.
Using Fiscal Multipliers
Lets look at several examples of how we can use fiscal policy, altering taxes, and gov-
ernment spending to affect GDP. In all these examples, suppose GDP is $6,000 billion
and the marginal propensity to consume is 0.6. The government-spending multiplier is
The tax multiplier is
1 Suppose policymakers want to increase GDP by 1 percent, or $60 billion.
By how much do
policymakers have to increase government spending to meet this target? Because the
multiplier for government spending is 2.5, we need to increase government spending
by only $24 billion. With a multiplier of 2.5, the $24 billion increase in government
spending leads to an increase in GDP of $60 billion ($24 billion * 2.5 = $60 billion).
2 Suppose policymakers wanted to use tax cuts rather than government-spending increases
to increase GDP by $60 billion.
How large a tax cut would be necessary? Because
the tax multiplier is 1.5, we need to cut taxes by $40 billion. The $40 billion tax
cut times the multiplier will lead to the objective, a $60 billion increase in GDP
( $40 billion * ( 1.5) = $60 billion).
3 If policymakers wanted to change taxes and government spending by equal amounts, so as
to not affect the federal budget, how large a change would be needed to increase GDP by
$60 billion?
Because the balanced-budget multiplier is one, both government
spending and taxes must be increased by $60 billion.
The models we are using are very simple and leave out important factors.
Nonetheless, the same basic principles apply in real situations. Here are five examples
of activist Keynesian fiscal policy from recent times:
1 In 1993, the three members of the Presidents Council of Economic Advisers wrote a
letter to President Clinton stating they thought the cuts in government spending
being proposed at the time were $20 billion too large. The economic model the
council members used had a multiplier for government spending of approximately
1.5. With this multiplier, the decrease in GDP from the $20 billion spending cut
would be $30 billion ($20 billion * 1.5). This was approximately 0.5 percent of GDP.
If GDP was expected to grow at 3 percent a year without the cuts, the presidents
advisers estimated that with the cuts, GDP would grow at only 2.5 percent a year.
However, their advice came too late to influence the policy decisions.
2 During 1994, the U.S. government urged the Japanese to increase public spend-
ing and cut taxes to stimulate their economy. The Japanese came up with a plan
and presented it to U.S. policymakers, who evaluated it using multiplier analysis.
They thought the plan did not provide enough fiscal stimulus and urged the

PART 4
Japanese to take more aggressive actions. Several years later, the Japanese did
adopt a more aggressive plan. Unfortunately, as our chapter-opening story
describes, the Japanese government raised taxes in 1997, actually sending the
country further into a recession.
3 During the late 1990s, the Chinese economy came under pressure from the eco-
nomic downturn in Asia and its own attempts to reform and restructure its econ-
omy. To prevent a severe economic slowdown, the Chinese successively engaged
in active fiscal policy, increasing spending on domestic infrastructure, including
roads, rails, and urban facilities.
4 After the September 11, 2001, terrorist attack on the United States, the govern-
ment increased spending for disaster relief in New York and provided subsidies
and loan guarantees to the airlines. In addition, President Bush and Congress
immediately began to work on additional spending programs and tax-relief pro-
grams to stimulate the economy.
5 President Obamas economic advisors used multiplier analysis to gauge the size of
their stimulus package. The multipliers they used ranged between 1 and 2 for dif-
ferent components of spending. Although some observers suggested the stimulus
package should be even larger than $787 billion, or 5.5 percent of GDP, the eco-
nomic advisors argued that this size stimulus would be sufficient to offset the
worst of the recession.
Though it is very simple, our income-expenditure model illustrates some impor-
tant lessons:
An increase in government spending will increase total planned expenditures
for goods and services.
Cutting taxes will increase the after-tax income of consumers and will also lead
to an increase in planned expenditures for goods and services.
Policymakers need to take into account the multipliers for government spend-
ing and taxes as they develop policies.
The idea that governments should use active fiscal policy to combat recessions
was argued forcibly by John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s. His book The General
Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money provided the intellectual foundation for the
income-expenditure model in this chapter and explained why economies could
become mired in recessions and fail to recover on their own. As a consequence,
Keynes strongly advocated aggressive fiscal policymaking as the best option policy-
makers have for bringing economies out of recessions. Keynes was a very public figure
and took a major role in policy debates throughout his life.
One of Keynes s controversial ideas was that governments could stimulate the
economy even if they spent money on wasteful projects. In the General Theory, he even
remarked (tongue-in-cheek) how lucky the Egyptians were, because the death of the
pharaohs would lead to new pyramids being built. Pyramids do not add to the stock of
capital to produce regular goods and services. But Keynes s point was that building
pyramids (or antisatellite missiles today) does add to planned expenditures and stimu-
lates GDP in the short run.
In the long run, of course, we are better off if government spends the money
wisely, such as on needed infrastructure like roads and bridges. This is an example of
the principle of opportunity cost.

The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
But even here, we can carry things too far. Japan is notorious for its excessive pub-
lic spending on infrastructure, driven in part by the central governments doing favors

for local politicians by creating jobs in their districts. Economists have even compared
spending on bridges and roads in Japan to Keynes s famous pyramids.
Understanding Automatic Stabilizers
With a slight addition to our basic model, we can explain one of the important facts in
U.S. economic history. Figure 11.10 plots the rate of growth of U.S. real GDP from
1871 to 2009. It is apparent from the graph that the U.S. economy has been much
more stable after World War II than before. A major reason is that government taxes
and transfer payments, such as unemployment insurance and welfare payments, grew

JOHN MAYNARD KEYNES: A WORLD INTELLECTUAL
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: How influential a figure was John
Maynard Keynes?
John Maynard Keynes was born into an academic family in Cambridge, England, in
1883. His father, John Neville Keynes, was an economist and later an academic
administrator at Kings College in Cambridge. His mother was one of the first female
graduates of the same university, which Keynes entered in 1902. At King s College,
Keynes began a lifetime association with an important group of writers and artists, the
Bloomsbury group, which included the well-regarded writer Virginia Woolf.
Members of the group were known both for their progressive views and their contro-
versial lifestyles. In 1925, Keynes married the Russian ballerina Lydia Lopokova and
was very active in promoting the arts.
After earning his degrees, Keynes became a civil servant, taking a job with the India
Office in Whitehall England. He then returned to Cambridge, where he taught econom-
ics. With the onset of World War I, Keynes returned to government employment, this
time in the Treasury. After World War I, he attended the Versailles Peace Conference
and wrote a book, The Economic Consequences of the Peace, which condemned the peace
treaty and its negotiators for what he believed were the unfair and devastating burdens of
the reparations, payments for causing the war, that Germany was required to make to the
Allies. This book established Keynes as both a first-rate economic analyst and a brilliant
writer, with a keen wit and shrewd political insights. Indeed, the reparation burdens on
Germany partly led to its disastrous postwar economy and the rise of Nazism and Hitler.
Between the wars, Keynes wrote his most famous work, The General Theory of
Employment, Interest, and Money, which challenged the conventional wisdom that
economies would automatically recover from economic downturns. It was a bold and con-
troversial work, probably the most famous economics book written in the twentieth cen-
tury. Because he believed economies would not necessarily recover by themselves and
monetary policies could be ineffective during deep recessions, Keynes argued that govern-
ments needed to adopt active policies, such as increased public works, in order to stimulate
the economy. His work influenced an entire generation of economists, especially in the
United States and Great Britain, and provided the rationale for activist fiscal policy today.
The General Theory was Keyness last major written work. Near the end of World
War II, he played a prominent role at the Bretton Woods Conference in 1944, which
established the postwar world monetary system and led to the creation of the
International Monetary Fund and the World Bank. His last major public service was his
negotiation in 1945 of a multibillion-dollar loan the United States granted to Britain for
post World War II rebuilding efforts. Keynes died in 1946.

sharply after the war. These taxes and transfer payments can automatically reduce
fluctuations in real GDP and thereby stabilize the economy. As we saw in the last
chapter, taxes and transfers act as automatic stabilizers for the economy.
Again, here is how the automatic stabilizers work. On the one hand, when income
is high the government collects more taxes and pays out less in transfer payments.
Because the government is taking funds out of the hands of consumers, there will be
reduced consumer spending. On the other hand, when output is low (such as during
recessions), the government collects less in taxes and pays out more in transfer pay-
ments, increasing consumer spending because the government is putting funds into
the hands of consumers. The automatic stabilizers prevent consumption from falling
as much in bad times and from rising as much in good times. This stabilizes the econ-
omy without any need for decisions from Congress or the White House.
To see how automatic stabilizers work in our model, we must take into account
that the government levies income taxes by applying a tax rate to the level of income.
To simplify, suppose there is a single tax rate of 0.2 (or 20 percent) and income is $100.
The government would then collect $20 in taxes (0.2 * $100).
If consumption depends on after-tax income, we have the following consump-
tion function:
This is the consumption function with income taxes. The only difference between the
consumption function with income taxes and the consumption function without
income taxes is that the marginal propensity to consume is adjusted for taxes, and so
The reason for this adjustment is that consumers keep only a fraction (l  t) of
their income; the rest, t, goes to the government. When income increases by $1, con-
sumers  after-tax incomes increase by only $1 * (l  t), and of that $(l  t) they spend a
fraction, b.
Raising the tax rate therefore lowers the MPC adjusted for taxes. Figure 11.11
shows the consequences of raising tax rates. With a higher tax rate, the government
takes a higher fraction of income, and less is left over for consumers. Recall that the
slope of the C + I + G line is the marginal propensity to consume. Raising the tax rate
lowers the adjusted MPC and reduces the slope of this line. The C + I + G line with
taxes intersects the 45° line at a lower level of income. Output falls from y0 to y1.
adjusted MPC = b(1 - t)
C = Ca + b(1 - t)y

Increase in Tax Rates
An increase in tax rates decreases the
slope of the C + I + G line. This lowers
output and reduces the multiplier.
Note that as we raise tax rates, the C + I + G schedule rotates and does not just
move down vertically as in our previous examples. The reason for this difference is that
as we change the tax rate, we change the adjusted MPC, and thus the slope of the line.
Remember that a smaller marginal propensity to consume also leads to a lower
value for the multiplier. As tax rates increase and the adjusted MPC falls, the multi-
plier will decrease. A smaller multiplier means that any shocks, such as shocks to
investment, will have less of an impact on the economy.
Now that we have introduced income taxes into our model, we can see how automatic
stabilizers work. Since World War II, taxes and transfer payments in the United States
have increased sharply. As we have seen, higher tax rates will lower the multiplier and
make the economy less susceptible to shocks. With higher taxes and transfer payments, the
link between fluctuations in disposable personal income and fluctuations in GDP is much
looser. Because disposable personal income is more stable, consumption spending is also
more stable. Thus, the multiplier is smaller, and the economy is more stable.
As we have said, automatic stabilizers work silently in the background, doing their
job without requiring explicit action by policymakers. Total tax collections rise and fall
with GDP without requiring that policymakers change tax rates. The fact that the auto-
matic stabilizers work without any laws being enacted is particularly important at times
when it is difficult to obtain a political consensus for taking any action, and policymakers
are reluctant to use Keynesian fiscal policy as a deliberate policy tool.
Other factors contribute to the stability of the economy as depicted in Figure 11.10.
As we explained in the last chapter, many consumers base their spending decisions in
part on their long-run average income or permanent income, not just their current level
of income. If households base their consumption on their long-run income, they will
not be very sensitive to changes in their current income. For example, if their income
temporarily rises, they are likely to save, not spend, the additional income. Similarly, if
their income temporarily falls, they are likely to maintain their consumption and reduce
their current savings. In effect, when consumers base their consumption on their long-
run average income, their MPC out of current income (which could be higher or lower
than their long-run income) will be small. And because the MPC out of current income
is small, the multiplier will be small as well.
Another important factor in promoting the stability of the economy is firms
knowledge that the federal government will be taking actions to stabilize the economy.
Firms are less likely to decrease their investment spending in the face of a possible

241
PART 4
recession if they believe the government is likely to intervene to offset the severity
of recessions. Because investment spending tends to be a very volatile component of
spending, any factor that helps stabilize investment spending will also stabilize the
economy. The same logic also applies to consumers. If they believe the government
will offset the severity of economic fluctuations, they are less likely to change their con-
sumption spending in the face of shocks to their income.
Finally, in recent decades changes in firms  inventory management practices have
also contributed to the stability of the economy. In the past, manufacturing firms often
kept large inventories at their factories. If an unexpected shock slowed the economy, the
demand for firms  products would decrease and inventories would pile up. Firms would
be forced to cut production even further to reduce their stock of inventories, adding
additional downward pressure on the economy. This additional decrease in demand was
known as the inventory cycle and was a significant component of earlier recessions. In
recent times, U.S. firms have paid more attention to forecasting changes in the demand
for their products and have adopted sophisticated computer management techniques to
reduce the size of inventories they normally hold. With less inventory on hand, firms do
not have to change their production as much to adjust their inventories. The result is
that the inventory cycle has become a less important factor for economic instability.
EXPORTS AND IMPORTS
With international trade becoming increasingly important economically and politi-
cally, it is critical to understand how exports and imports affect the level of GDP. Two
simple modifications of our income-expenditure model will enable us to understand
how exports and imports affect GDP in the short run.
Exports affect GDP through their influence on how other countries demand
goods and services produced in the United States. An increase in exports means there s
an increase in the demand for goods produced in the United States. An increase in
imports means there s an increase in foreign goods purchased by U.S. residents.
Importing goods rather than purchasing them from our domestic producers reduces
the demand for U.S. goods. For example, if we in the United States spend a total of
$10 billion on all automobiles but we import $3 billion of them, then we ve spent only
$7 billion on U.S. automobiles.
To get a clearer picture of the effects on GDP from exports and imports, lets for
the moment ignore government spending and taxes. In the appendix, we present a
complete model with both a domestic government and foreign countries to whom we
sell our exports and from whom we buy our imports. To modify our model to include
the effects of world spending on exports and U.S. spending on imports, we need to
take two steps:
1 Add exports, X, as another source of demand for U.S. goods and services.
2 Subtract imports, M, from total spending by U.S. residents. We will assume that
imports, like consumption, increase with the level of income.
Consumers will import more goods as their income rises. We can write this as
where m is a fraction known as the marginal propensity to import. We subtract this
fraction from b, the overall marginal propensity to consume, to obtain the MPC for
spending on domestic goods, b  m. For example, if b is 0.8 and m is 0.2, then for every
$1 that GDP increases, total consumption increases by $0.80, but spending on domes-
tic goods increases by only $0.60 because $0.20 is spent on imports. The MPC in this
example, adjusted for imports, is 0.8  0.2, or 0.6.
Figure 11.12 shows how equilibrium output is determined in an open economy,
that is, an economy that engages in trade with the rest of the world. We plot planned
expenditures for U.S. goods and services on our graph and find the level of equilibrium

ment, and exports. The slope of the line is b

imports. Equilibrium output is the value of output where planned expenditures for

THE LOCOMOTIVE EFFECT: HOW FOREIGN DEMAND
AFFECTS A COUNTRY S OUTPUT
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: How do countries benefit from growth in
their trading partners?
From the early 1990s until quite recently, the United States was what economists term
the locomotive  for global growth, growing faster than the rest of the world and
increasing its demand for foreign products. As a share of the world economy, the United
States grew from approximately 26 percent in 1992 to over 32 percent in 2001. Imports
increase as an economy grows, and U.S. imports also increased along with output dur-
ing this period. Because the U.S. economy is such an important part of the world econ-
omy, its demands for foreign goods
U.S. imports
fueled exports in foreign countries
and promoted their growth. Studies have shown that the increase in demand for foreign
goods was actually more pronounced for developing countries than for developed coun-
tries. The United States was truly a locomotive, pulling the developing countries along.
When the U.S. economy began to slow in 2007 because of our housing and finan-
cial difficulties, growth in other parts of the world, including China and India, was still
robust. Their demand for U.S. goods spurred our exports and helped prevent U.S.
GDP from falling any further. In this case, foreign countries were the true locomo-
tives. As our chapter opening story describes, China remained a locomotive during the
downturn.

How Increases in Exports and Imports Affect U.S. GDP
Panel A shows that an increase in exports will increase the level of GDP. Panel B shows that an
increase in the marginal propensity to import will decrease the level of GDP.
Let s examine an application of the model we just developed. Suppose Japan
decides to buy another $5 billion worth of goods from the United States. What will
happen to U.S. domestic output? Panel A of Figure 11.13 shows the effect of an
increase in exports. The demand line will shift vertically upward by the increase in
exports 
. This will increase equilibrium income from y0 to y1.
The increase in income will be larger than the increase in exports because of the
multiplier effect. This multiplier is based on the MPC adjusted for trade. For exam-
ple, if b is 0.8 and m is 0.2, the adjusted MPC (b  m) is 0.6, and the multiplier will be
Therefore, a $5 billion increase in exports will lead to a $12.5 billion increase in GDP.
Now, suppose U.S. residents become more attracted to foreign goods, and as a
result our marginal propensity to import increases. What happens to GDP? Panel B
of Figure 11.13 depicts the effect of an increase in imported foreign goods. The
adjusted MPC (b
 m) will fall as the marginal propensity to import increases. This
reduces the slope of the planned expenditure line, and output will fall from y0 to y1.
The reason the line rotates rather than shifting down vertically is that an increase in
the propensity to import changes the slope of the planned expenditure line.
We can now understand why our domestic political leaders are eager to sell our
goods abroad. Whether it is electronics or weapons, increased U.S. exports will
increase U.S. GDP and reduce unemployment in the short run. We can also under-
stand how a recession abroad that led to a decrease in imports of U.S. goods could
cause a recession here. At the same time, we can further understand why politicians
will find buy American  policies attractive in the short run. To the extent that U.S.
residents buy U.S. goods rather than imports, output will be higher. This reasoning
is also why other countries like to see the United States grow rapidly.
THE INCOME-EXPENDITURE MODEL AND
THE AGGREGATE DEMAND CURVE
We used the income-expenditure model in this chapter to understand more fully
short-term economic fluctuations. The income-expenditure model is based on the
assumption that prices do not change. In Figure 11.14, we see how the model provides

Deriving the Aggregate

As the price level falls from P0 to P1,

increases the level of output from y0 to
y1. The aggregate demand curve shows
the combination of prices and equilib-
rium output.
the foundation for the aggregate demand curve, which will enable us to analyze
changes both in output and prices.
Suppose the price level in the economy is P0 and, at that level of prices, planned
expenditures are C0 + I0. At the top of the figure, we show how equilibrium output is
determined at level of output, y0. In the bottom part of the figure, we plot the price
level, P0, and corresponding level of output, y0. In the graph, this is point a.
Now lets lower the price level to P1. Recall from our discussion in Chapter 9 that
a lower price level will increase the demand for goods and services through wealth
effects, the interest rate effect, and the international trade effect. (You may want to go
back and review this discussion.) As a consequence of the increased demand for goods
and services arising from a lower price level, we show a higher level of planned expen-
diture, C1 + I1, and a higher level of equilibrium output, y1, in the top part of the fig-
ure. In the bottom part, we again plot the price level, P1, and the corresponding level
of output, y1. In the graph, this is point b.
Both point a and point b are on the aggregate demand curve. By the same logic,
we can create all the other points on the aggregate demand curve by either raising or
lowering the aggregate price level. For any price level, the income-expenditure model
can be used to determine the level of output and the corresponding point on the
aggregate demand curve. Thus, the income-expenditure model provides the basic
foundation for the aggregate demand curve.
At any price level, the income-expenditure model determines the level of equi-
librium output and the corresponding point on the aggregate demand curve. What
would happen if we kept the price level at P0 but increased planned expenditures,
let s say through an increase in government expenditures from G0 to G1? We depict
this case in Figure 11.15. The increase in government expenditure will raise the
equilibrium output, from y0 to y1. Because the price level has not changed, we have
a higher level of output at the same level of price. This means the aggregate
demand curve would shift to the right, from AD0 to AD1. In general, increases in
planned expenditures that are not directly caused by changes in prices will shift the

245
aggregate demand curve to the right; decreases in planned expenditures will shift
the curve to the left.
In the remaining chapters, we will use the aggregate demand and supply curves to
analyze economic fluctuations. This will enable us to understand movements in both
prices and output in the intermediate and longer runs. But, as we have seen, the
income-expenditure model developed in this chapter provides the underlying founda-
tion for the aggregate demand curve.

This chapter developed the income-
expenditure model, which is useful for
understanding short-run fluctuations.
We developed the graphical and
algebraic tools to study the effects of
consumer 
behavior, 
government
spending and taxation, and exports
and imports in determining GDP in
the short run. Here are the chapter s
main points:
1 In the income-expenditure model,
the level of output in the economy will
adjust to equal the level of planned expenditures. This level
of output is called equilibrium output.
2 Consumption spending consists of two parts. One part is
independent of income, but it can be influenced by changes
in wealth or consumer sentiment. The other part depends on
the level of income.
3 Increases in planned expenditures by households, the gov-
ernment, or the foreign sector lead to increases in equilib-
rium output.
4 Because of the multiplier, the final increase in equilibrium
output is larger than the initial increase. The formula for the
simple multiplier is
5 Policymakers can use multipliers to calculate the appropriate
size of economic policies.
6 Higher tax rates, by reducing the multiplier, can reduce fluc-
tuations in GDP.
7 Increases in exports lead to increases in equilibrium output;
increases in imports lead to decreases in equilibrium output.

stores. What will happen to GDP?
b. Suppose economists see inventories suddenly
increasing. Does this necessarily mean that there are
increases in demand for final goods and services?

Understanding the 45° Line. Use the simple
income-expenditure diagram depicted in Figure 11.3
on page 226 to answer the following questions.
a. If output equals y1, what is the level of
expenditures?
b. At output equal to y1, does the level of expenditures
fall above, below, or on the 45° line?
c. What does this say about the relationship between
output and expenditures?

Housing Price Increases and Falling Savings.

housing prices after 2002 was related to the fall in

household savings that was also observed during that
period. (Related to Application 1 on page 229.)
2.6
Retirement Savings and the Decline in the Stock
Market. When the stock market fell sharply in 2007
and 2008, many people near retirement found that
their savings for retirement were dramatically
reduced. What would be their logical response in this
situation? Is this consistent with the wealth effect?
2.7
Is the Wealth Effect on Consumption from
Housing Symmetrical? When housing prices rose,
some households took out a larger loan on their
homes and used the additional funds they borrowed to
finance purchases of consumer durables. This option
is not available when housing prices fall. Explain how
this difference might lead to a larger wealth effect for
increases in housing prices than decreases in prices.

by $10 billion. By how much will equilibrium
income decrease?
b. An economy has an MPC of 0.6. By how much will a
$10 billion increase in government purchases increase
equilibrium income? By how much will a $10 billion
increase in taxes decrease equilibrium income?
3.6
The Paradox of Thrift. The United States has insti-
tuted many policies to attempt to increase savings
rates in the United States. One such policy was the
creation of individual retirement accounts and other
incentives for savings. An implication of the income-
expenditure model is that an increase in the desire of
consumers to save will not necessarily lead to higher
11.3

savings. In fact, total savings will either remain the
same or perhaps fall. This is known as the paradox of
thrift. Lets see why this is true with an example.
a. Suppose I equals 40 and the savings function is S =
100 + 0.4y. Equilibrium income, y, in the economy is
350. Now suppose consumers wish to increase their
savings; the new savings function becomes S = 80 +
0.4y. Calculate the new level of equilibrium output
and savings after the change in the savings function.
b. Explain why equilibrium savings are unchanged.
c. Now suppose that with a decline in equilibrium
income, investment also falls. What would be
the effect on equilibrium output and total savings
if households now wished to increase their
desired savings?
d. What does this suggest about the ability of
policymakers to increase aggregate savings by
affecting citizens  savings rates?

Solving a Simple Model. Consider an economy in
which C = 200 + 0.5y and I = 200.
a. Determine the equilibrium income algebraically.
b. What is the multiplier for investment spending for
this economy?
c. What is the savings function?
d. Draw the savings function on a graph with the
investment level and indicate how equilibrium
income is determined.
e. What is the level of saving at the level of equilibrium
income? Show it is equal to investment.
3.8
Earthquakes and Subsequent GDP Growth.
Massive earthquakes, such as the one that afflicted
Sichuan province in China in 2008 are terrible events.
Yet, economists believe that GDP typically rises after
an earthquake. Explain why this happens and whether
that means that earthquakes are really good things.
3.9
A Difficulty in Estimating Government Spending
Multipliers. Tax revenues typically rise along with
GDP. Governments may typically spend some of this
additional revenue on discretionary items in the bud-

the work of analysts trying to determine the multi-

The MPC is 0.8.

The Broken Window Fallacy. Critics of Keynes
pointed out that not all spending is really productive.
If vandals break windows and you replace them, GDP
will certainly rise. Yet, you are probably worse off than
before because you had to use resources to repair the
windows. Discuss.

President Ford s Theory.
During the 1970s,
President Gerald Ford proposed that taxes be
decreased but that, to avoid increasing the govern-
ment budget deficit, government spending should be
decreased by the same amount.
a. What happens to GDP if taxes and government
spending are both decreased by the same amount?
b. Should President Ford have been worried about his
tax-reduction plan? Why or why not?
4.8
Inventory Policies and Economic Stability. In
recent years, many companies have adopted Japanese-
style just-in-time  inventory management. For exam-
ple, when your cashier at Walmart records your
purchase of a new toaster, it automatically triggers a
process to re-order a toaster for the store. In the past,
store managers had to forecast their inventory needs.
Why might this method of inventory management
lead to more economic stability?

Keynes s Other Contributions. Although John
Maynard Keynes is best known today for his book The
General Theory of Employment, Interest, and Money, he
made other important contributions as well. Search
the Web to find out (1) Keynes s main criticism of the
Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I and (2)
his contribution to the post World War II monetary
system. (Related to Application 3 on page 238.)

Trade Wars. During the 1930s, many countries in the
world

But because one countrys imports are another coun-
try s exports, such actions cause international reper-
cussions. Lets look at the worldwide consequences of
such policies using the income-expenditure model.
a. Suppose the United States adopted policies to
reduce imports from Europe. This means
European exports to the United States would be
reduced. What would happen to European
equilibrium income?
b. Suppose, in response to U.S. policies, Europe
decides to restrict imports from the United States.
What then happens to U.S equilibrium income?
c. What do you think happened to the volume of
world trade during the 1930s?
5.6
Using Open-Economy Multipliers. In an open
economy, the marginal propensity to consume is 0.9,
and the marginal propensity to import is 0.3. How
much of an increase in investment would be necessary
to raise GDP by 200? What would be your answer if
this was a closed economy?
5.7
U.S. Export Growth. In 2007, several components of
GDP grew much more slowly than in prior years but
exports increased sharply. The rest of the world was
growing rapidly during this period. Based on this
information, what is the most natural explanation for
the growth in U.S. exports? (Related to Application 4

top row of each column gives you the monthly disposable
income. How would you allocate it each month among the
various categories of spending in the table and savings?
Complete each column in the table. The sum of your
entries should equal your disposable income at the top of
each column.
After you have filled out the chart, compute the
changes in your savings and total consumption as your
income goes up. What is your marginal propensity to
save (MPS)? What is your marginal propensity to con-
sume (MPC) over your total expenditures? Graph your

FOR MU L A S  FOR  EQ UILIBR IUM  I NC OM E  AND TH E
MU LTI P L I ER
In the chapter, we developed the logic of the income-expenditure model and generally
relied on graphical analysis. However, we also referred to a few formulas. In this
appendix, we explain where these formulas, both for equilibrium income and the mul-
tiplier, come from.
Specifically, in this appendix, we do three things:
Derive a simple formula for calculating equilibrium output for the simplest
economy in which there is no government spending or taxes.
Derive the multipliers for the economy with the government.
Derive equilibrium output with both government and the foreign sector.
To derive the formula for equilibrium output, we use simple algebra in the follow-
ing steps:
1 We know that equilibrium output occurs where output equals planned expendi-
tures, and we know that planned expenditures equal C + I; therefore,
2 Next, we substitute the symbol y for output; more importantly, we substitute for
the consumption function, C = (Ca + by):
3 Collect all terms in y on the left side of the equation:
4 Factor the left side:
5 Divide both sides by (1  b):
where y* means the equilibrium level of output. This is the formula for equilib-
rium output in the text.
Now let s find the multiplier for investment in this simple economy. To do that,
we use the formula we just derived and calculate the equilibrium income at one level
of investment, which we call the original level, and then calculate the equilibrium
income at some other level of investment, which we call the new level. (We will calcu-
late  in general terms, not in specific numerical quantities.) What we will get is a for-
mula for the change in output that results from the changes in investment.
For the original level of investment at I0, we have
For a new level of investment at I1, we have
y1 = (Ca + I1)
(1 - b)
y0 = (Ca + I0)
(1 - b)
y* = (Ca + I)
(1 - b)
y(1 - b) = Ca + I
y - by = Ca + I
y = (Ca + by) + I
 output = C + I
 output = planned expenditures = C + I
249

The change in output, 
, is the difference between the two levels of output that
occur at each level of investment:
Substituting for the levels of output, we have
Because the denominator in both expressions is the same (1  b), we can put the
numerators over that common denominator:
Finally, because (I1  I0) is the change in investment, 
, we can write
or
Therefore, because the multiplier is the ratio of the change in income to the change in
investment spending, we have
Here is another way to derive the formula for the multiplier. This way helps to
illustrate its underlying logic. Suppose investment spending increases by $1. Because
spending determines output, output will rise by $1. However, because consumption
depends on income, consumption will increase by the marginal propensity to con-
sume times the change in income. This means that as output rises by $1, consumption
will increase by (b * $1). Because spending determines output, this additional increase
in consumer demand will cause output to rise further (b * $1). But again, as output
and income increase, consumption will increase by MPC times the change in income,
which in this case will be b * (b * $1) or b2 * $1. As we allow this process to continue,
the total change in output will be
or
The term in parentheses is an infinite series whose value is equal to
Substituting this value for the infinite series, we have the expression for the multiplier:
¢y = $1 *

¢y = $1 * (1 + b + b2 + b3 + Á )

250

Now we introduce government spending and taxes. Government spending is
another determinant of planned expenditures, and consumption spending depends on
after-tax income, so consumption equals Ca + b(y
T). Following the same steps we used
for equilibrium output without government, we do the same, but now with government:
We first collect all terms in y on the left and leave the other terms on the right:
We then factor the left side:
We then divide both sides by (1  b):
Using this formula and the method just outlined, we can find the multiplier for
changes in government spending and the multiplier for changes in taxes:
The multiplier for an increase in government spending is larger than the tax multi-
plier for a reduction in taxes in the same amount as an increase in government spend-
ing. Government spending increases total demand directly. Reductions in taxes first
affect consumer s incomes. Because consumers will save a part of their income
increase from the tax cut, not all of the tax cut is spent. Therefore, the tax multiplier is
smaller (in absolute value) than the government spending multiplier.
As we explained in the text, because government spending has a larger multiplier
than taxes, equal increases in government spending and taxes, called balanced-budget
increases, will increase total output. For equal dollar increases in both taxes and gov-
ernment spending, the positive effects from the spending increase will outweigh the
negative effects from the tax increase. To find the balanced-budget multiplier, just add
the government spending and tax multipliers:
The balanced-budget multiplier equals 1; a $10 billion increase in both taxes and gov-
ernment spending will increase GDP by $10 billion.
Finally, we derive equilibrium output with government spending, taxes, and the
foreign sector. First, recall that equilibrium output occurs where output equals
demand. We now must include planned expenditures from both the government sec-
tor and the foreign sector. Planned expenditures from the foreign sector are exports
minus imports:
output = planned expenditures = (C + I + G + X - M)
 = 1
 = (1 - b)
(1 - b)

y* = (Ca - bT + I + G)
(1 - b)
y(1 - b) = Ca - bT + I + G
y - by = Ca - bT + I + G
 y = Ca + b(y - T) + I + G
 output = planned expenditures = (C + I + G)
251

Consumption depends on disposable income:
and imports depend on the level of output:
Substitute the equations for consumption and imports into the equation where output
equals demand:
Collect all terms in y on the left and leave the other terms on the right:
Factor the left side:
Divide both sides by [1  (b  m)]:
This is the expression for equilibrium income with government in an open econ-
omy. It can be used, following the method we outlined, to calculate multipliers in the
open economy.
y* = (Ca - bT + I + G + X)
C1 - (b - m)D
yC1 - (b - m)D = Ca - bT + I + G + X
y - (b - m)y = Ca - bT + I + G + X
y = Ca + b(y - T) + I + G + X - my
M = my
C = Ca + b(y - T)

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
The housing market is a perfect example of the close
links between investment and finance. With the stock
market falling sharply in 2000, housing looked like an alter-
native and attractive investment. Interest rates were low
and homeowners and potential investors found that it was
easy to borrow money to purchase new or larger homes.
Wall Street and government agencies developed ever more
complex ways to pour money into the housing market, and
banks and finance companies did not seem to be asking
too many questions about their borrowers. As housing
prices continued to rise, the building industry responded to
the general euphoria. Investment in residential housing
increased 40 percent in real terms from 2000 to 2006.
It was too good to last. With all the new construction,
the increased supply of housing stopped the rise in prices.
Some buyers made foolish decisions and took on loans
that were too large for their incomes. As financial markets
became nervous, lenders became more cautious and
sharply cut back on funds available to the market. With
increased supply and reduced demand, housing prices
began to fall. The building industry recognized it had too
many new houses in the pipeline and began to cut back.
From its peak in the first quarter of 2006 to the fourth quar-
ter of 2009, new housing construction fell by 53 percent.
The fall in residential housing alone brought down real
GDP by 3 percent and devastated many state economies.

CHAPTER 12
INVESTMENT AND FINANCIAL MARKETS

I
nvestment spending plays a number of critical roles in the economy. As we have seen,
economic growth depends on whether the stock of capital
plant and equipment
increases in the economy. Moreover, investment is also a key component of aggregate
demand, so fluctuations in investment spending can cause recessions and booms. In this
chapter, we will study the factors that determine investment spending by firms. We also
will examine the role that institutions such as banks, savings and loans, and other new and
evolving financial institutions play in facilitating that investment.
An investment, broadly defined, is an action that creates a cost today but provides
benefits in the future. A firm builds a new plant today to earn more revenue in the
future. College students pay money to attend school now so they can earn higher
salaries later. A government spends money today to construct a dam that will provide
hydroelectric power for years to come. These are examples of investments. Notice
that we re using the term investment in a broader sense than we did in Chapter 5 when
we discussed GDP. In that chapter when we talked about investment, we were talking
about expenditures by firms on currently produced goods and services. In this chapter,
we broaden the definition to include actions taken by anyone
individuals, firms, and
governments
to improve well-being later.
AN INVESTMENT: A PLUNGE INTO THE UNKNOWN
When individuals, firms, or governments make an investment, they incur costs today
in the hope of future gains. The phrase hope of  is an important aspect of investment
decisions. That simply means that payoffs occurring in the future cannot be known
with certainty. Investments are a plunge into the unknown.
Firms and individuals frequently revise their outlook on the future precisely
because it is uncertain. These revisions can occur suddenly and lead to sharp swings in
investment spending. Sometimes investors are optimistic and decide to increase their
investment spending; at other times, they may quickly become pessimistic and cut
back on their investment spending. To estimate future events, firms pay careful atten-
tion to the current pace of the economy. If economic growth is sluggish, they are
likely to forecast that it will be sluggish in the future and cut back on investment
spending. If economic growth is strong, they are likely to forecast that it will remain
so and increase their investment spending. In other words, investment spending tends
to be closely related to the current pace of economic growth.
This phenomenon is known as the accelerator theory of investment spending. It
postulates that when real GDP growth is expected to be high, firms anticipate that
investing in plants and equipment will pay off later, so they increase their total invest-
ment spending. However, John Maynard Keynes had another theory. Keynes said the
sharp swings in optimism and pessimism related to investment spending were often
irrational, reflecting, perhaps, our most basic, primal instincts. He often referred to
them as the animal spirits  of investors. It was, in part, animal spirits that led to the
rise and fall in residential investment that we discussed in the chapter-opening story.
It is likely that both projections for the future and Keynes s animal spirits are
closely associated with current investment. If this is the case, we would expect invest-
ment spending to be a very volatile component of GDP. As Figure 12.1 indicates, this
is indeed the case.
Figure 12.1 plots total investment spending as a share of U.S. GDP from 1970 to
2009. Notice two things about Figure 12.1:
From 1970 to 2009, the share of investment as a component of GDP ranged
from a low of about 10 percent in 1975 to a high of over 18 percent in 2000
a
dramatic 8-percentage-point difference.
Swings in investment spending often occurred over short periods of time. For
example, during recessions (noted by the shaded areas in the figure), investment
spending fell sharply. During booms, investment spending rose sharply. In
other words, investment spending is highly procyclical; it increases during
booms and falls during recessions.

Many different factors can contribute to uncertainty in the economy. Volatile
energy prices are one. In general, when the future is uncertain, firms become cautious
in their behavior and may postpone making investment decisions.
Although investment spending is a much smaller component of GDP than con-
sumption (70 versus 16 percent), it is much more volatile than consumption. Recall
that changes in the components of GDP
C, I, G, or NX
are amplified by the mul-
tiplier. For example, if the multiplier is 1.5, and investment spending initially falls by
1 percent of GDP, then GDP will fall by 1.5 percent. However, if the fall in GDP
makes firms more pessimistic, they may cut investment even further. This further cut

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How Do Fluctuations in Energy Prices Affect
Investment Decisions By Firms?
As we have seen in previous chapters, increases in oil prices can lead to a drop in GDP.
However, uncertainty about oil prices is also an important factor. Economists Hui
Guo and Kevin Kliesen found evidence that volatility in oil prices adversely affects
GDP growth.
One important way volatility of oil prices can hurt the economy is by creating
uncertainty for firms making investment decisions. For example, consider whether a
firm should invest in an energy-saving technology for a new plant. If energy prices
remain high, it may be profitable to invest in energy-saving technology, but if energy
prices fall, these investments would be unwise. If firms are faced with an increasingly
uncertain future, they will delay their investment decisions until the uncertainty is
resolved. In 2008, oil prices reached $145 a barrel, but later in the year fell below
$50. On what number should firms base their investment decisions?

in investment will decrease GDP even more. That is, a small initial fall in investment
can trigger a much larger fall in GDP. Nobel Laureate Paul Samuelson described this
phenomenon of investment volatility by developing the multiplier-accelerator model.
The multiplier-accelerator model showed that a downturn in real GDP leads to an
even sharper fall in investment, which further reduces GDP via the multiplier.
Psychology and expectations about future real GDP growth are not the only fac-
tors that affect investment. Because investments are really trade-offs
something in
the present traded for something in the future
the terms  affecting the trade-off are
also important. These terms are interest rates, which we discuss next.
EVALUATING THE FUTURE
A dollar paid today does not have the same value as a dollar paid next year. Because
investments yield future payoffs, we need to be able to compare costs and benefits at
different points in time. As we will see, we can use interest rates to do this.
Understanding Present Value
Suppose a good friend comes to you and says, I need some cash, badly. If you give me
$100 today, I can give you back $105 next year. Do we have a deal?  How would you
decide whether to accept this deal? Somehow, you need a tool to be able to compare
dollars today with dollars received in the future. That tool is present value. The
present value of a payment to be received in the future is the maximum amount a
person is willing to pay today to receive the future payment. Recall the principle of
opportunity cost.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  O P P O R T U N I T Y  C O S T
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
Lets think about how much you are willing to pay for the right to receive $105 in
one year. Suppose you can earn 5 percent per year in a savings account or money mar-
ket account. A moment of thought will show you that you would be willing to lend
your friend $100. Here is why: If you kept your $100 in the bank at 5 percent interest,
you would have $105 at the end of the year
just the amount your friend would repay
you. While you would have sacrificed $5 in interest, you would have earned $5 on the
loan ($105  $100).
However, you would not want to lend your friend more than $100. If you lent
more
say $102
then your loss in interest of $5.10 (5 percent of $102) would be
greater than your $3 gain on the loan ($105  $102). In this case, the amount you sac-
rifice will be greater than what you get in return.
Of course, you would like to lend your friend less than $100 and make even more
profit. But the maximum amount you would be willing to pay today to receive $105
next year, when the interest rate is 5 percent, is $100. Thus, the present value of $105
in this example is $100.
PRESENT VALUE AND INTEREST RATES
Here is another useful way to think of
present value. Suppose you want to buy a new car in five years for $20,000. You want
to know how much you need to have in your bank account today, so that after five
years you have the $20,000 to make the payment for the car. A simple formula can
answer this and similar questions. If K is an amount of money at some point in the
future; t is the amount of time, or years, in the future until you need the money; and i
is the interest rate you earn on your account, then the amount you need today is just
the present value of the K dollars, which is

present value
The maximum amount a person is willing
to pay today to receive a payment in
the future.

PART 4
In the example of your friend, her payment (K) is $105, the interval of time (t) in
which shes going to pay it is one year, and the interest rate (i) is 0.05. Using the pre-
sent value formula, the present value of $105 in one year is $100:
This is the maximum amount you are willing to lend her today to receive $105
from her in one year.
Let s consider another example. Suppose the interest rate were 10 percent and
you were offered $1,000 to be paid to you in 20 years. How much is that $1,000 worth
today? That is, how much of your money today would you be willing to tie up  (loan
out) to get $1,000 in 20 years? At an interest rate of 10 percent, this is how much:
You would be willing to pay only $148.64 today to receive $1,000 in 20 years. The
reason you would be willing to pay so much less than $1,000 is that money earning
interest grows over time. At a 10 percent interest rate, after 20 years you would have
received exactly $1,000 by initially investing just $148.64.
Returning to our original example with your friend, what happens if the interest
rate is 10 percent instead of 5 percent? If your friend still promises you $105 after one
year but the interest rate is double, how much would you be willing to loan her today?
Using the formula, you would loan only $95.45 today:
What this means is that if the interest rate is higher, you will be willing to pay less
for the same payment in the future. This is an important result. The present value of a
given payment in the future decreases as the interest rate increases. Here is why: With a
higher interest rate, the opportunity cost of lending out your money is higher.
Because you can earn more on your money with a higher rate, you will not be willing
to pay as much now to get the same $105 dollars in the future. Similarly, when interest
rates fall, the present value of a given payment in the future increases. For example, if inter-
est rates fell to 2 percent, the present value (the value today) of $105 in one year would
be higher
$102.94:
With a lower interest rate, the opportunity cost of keeping your money in the
bank or loaning it to a friend is less. That means you will be willing to pay more
money now for the same $105 payment in the future.
Lets summarize our discussion of present value:
1 The present value
the value today
of a given payment in the future is the max-
imum amount a person is willing to pay today for that payment.
2 As the interest rate increases, the opportunity cost of your funds also increases, so
the present value of a given payment in the future falls. In other words, you need
less money today to get to your future money goal.
3 As the interest rate decreases, the opportunity cost of your funds also decreases,
so the present value of a given payment in the future rises. In other words, you
need more money today to get to your money goal.
Individuals, firms, and the government all use interest rates to make decisions
that involve the future. For example, individuals take interest rates into account when
they decide how much to save for the future or even when to retire. And, as we will
see, firms and the government use interest rates to decide whether to undertake
important investments.

Real and Nominal Interest Rates
Even if you deposit $100 in a bank account and get $105 at the end of the year, if the
economy s annual rate of inflation amounts to 5 percent or more, your purchasing
power would not have increased at all. In other words, the 5 percent inflation will eat
up all your 5 percent earnings. This is an example of the real-nominal principle.
R E A L - N O M I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
What matters to people is the real value of money or income
the
purchasing power
not the face value of money.
When there is inflation, economists make a distinction between the interest rate
quoted in the market, which is called the nominal interest rate, and the real interest
rate, which is what you actually earn after taking account of inflation. The real inter-
est rate is defined as the nominal interest rate minus the inflation rate:
If the nominal rate of interest is 6 percent per year and the inflation rate is 4 per-
cent during the year, the real rate of interest is 2 percent (6  4).
To understand what the real rate of interest means, suppose you have $100
and annual inflation is 4 percent. It s not hard to figure out that next year you will
need $104 to have the same purchasing power you do today. Let s say you deposit
today $100 at a 6 percent annual interest rate. At the end of the year, you will have
$106 ($100 * 1.06).
Now let s calculate your real gain. After one year, you will have increased your
holdings by $6, but taking into account the $4 you needed to keep up with inflation,
your gain is only $2. The real rate of interest you earned, the nominal rate adjusted for
inflation, is 2 percent, or $2.

OPTIONS FOR A LOTTERY WINNER
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: How Can Understanding The Concept of
Present Value Help a Lucky Lottery Winner?
The lucky winner of a lottery was given an option. She could either receive $1 million
a year for 20 years, for a total of $20 million, or simply receive $10 million today. Why
would anyone take the $10 million today?
To answer this question, we need to use the concept of present value. A dollar paid
today is not the same as a dollar paid next year. Depending on the interest rate, the
$10 million today might be more valuable than the $20 million paid over 20 years.
Indeed, if interest rates were 10 percent, you could take the $10 million today, put it in
the bank, and earn $1 million in interest (10 percent of $10 million) forever
not just
for 20 years! To determine which payment option is best, our lottery winner would
first need to calculate the present value of $1 million for each of the 20 years, add up
the results, and compare the sum to the $10 million being offered to her today. With
an 8 percent interest rate, the present value of an annual payment of $1 million every
year for 20 years is $9.8 million. So if interest rates exceed 8 percent, it is better to take
the $10 million dollars. (The actual calculation
adding up the present value at an
8 percent interest rate for all 20 years
is a bit tedious. In the problems at the end of
the chapter, we show you how to make this calculation using an Excel spreadsheet.)
Related to Exercise 2.7.

PART 4
Lets see what happens when you borrow money. Suppose you borrow $100 at a
10 percent annual interest rate, but inflation is 6 percent during the year. At the end of
the year, you must pay back $110 ($100 * 1.10). But with an inflation rate of 6 per-
cent, the lender would need 6 of the 10 dollars you paid in interest just to keep up with
inflation. That means the lender would effectively get just a $4 gain ($10  $6), instead
of the full $10 gain. Thus, when corrected for the effects of inflation, the real rate of
interest you will have to pay is just 4 percent, or $4, on the original $100 loan.
As an example, in 2002 if seniors invested their money in three-month U.S. gov-
ernment Treasury bills, they would have earned an average interest rate of 1.6 percent.
However, inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index, was 2.4 percent. In
real terms, these seniors would have actually lost money during the year, earning a
negative real rate of interest of 0.8 percent.
We defined the real interest rate as the nominal interest rate minus the actual
inflation rate. When firms or individuals borrow or lend money, they do not know
what the rate of inflation will actually be in the future. Instead, they must form an
expectation
an estimate
of what they believe the inflation rate will be in the future.
For a given nominal interest rate, we can define the expected real interest rate as the
nominal interest rate minus the expected inflation rate. The expected real interest rate
is the rate at which borrowers or lenders expect to make transactions.
It is difficult to precisely determine expected real rates of interest because we
never know exactly what inflation rates people really anticipate. One approach is to
rely on the judgments of professional forecasters. Here is an example. In April 2010
nominal interest rates on three-month U.S. government securities was 0.22 percent.
The nominal rate was very low, but positive. However, inflation forecasts for the
remainder of that year were about 2 percent. This meant that the expected real rate
was 1.78 percent. To determine real returns, we need to know both the nominal rate
of interest and forecasts for inflation.
Up to this point, we have discussed the  interest rate. However, at any point in
time, there are really many different interest rates. One reason is that loans vary by
their riskiness and by their maturity (the length of the loan). Riskier loans and loans
for longer maturities typically have higher interest rates.
Figure 12.2 depicts the movement in three interest rates from 2002 to 2008 for
three types of investments: corporate AAA bonds (loans investors make to corporations
that are good credit risks), 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds (loans to the government for
10 years), and six-month treasuries (loans to the U.S. government for six months).

Notice that rates for corporate bonds are higher than rates for 10-year Treasury
bonds. The reason is that corporations are less likely to pay back their loans than the
U.S. government. Notice, too, that for most of this time period, the U.S. government
typically paid a lower rate when it borrowed for shorter periods of time (6 months)
than for longer periods of time (10 years). That is the normal pattern. However, in
2006 and 2007, it became cheaper for the government to borrow for the longer
period. In later chapters we ll look more carefully at the factors that determine inter-
est rates.
UNDERSTANDING INVESTMENT DECISIONS
Now that we understand the concept of present value and interest rates, we can use
these tools to understand investment decisions. Consider a project we have to pay for
today in order to benefit in the future. Here is the simple investment rule for such a
project: Invest in a project if the cost you incur today is less than or equal to the present value
of the future payments from the project.
In our first present-value example, the project  (the loan to your friend) pays
$105 in one year, and the present value (with an interest rate of 5 percent) is $100.
Because the cost of the project is also $100, the project is worthwhile.
Consider a more complicated project that pays $110 in year 1 and in year 2. The
interest rate is 10 percent. The present value of the benefits from this project is
As long as the cost of the project today is less than $191, it pays to invest in it.
We can use our theory to develop the relationship between investment spending
and the real rate of interest in the economy. In the economy as a whole, millions of
different investment projects can be undertaken, nearly all providing different returns.
Consider the array of investments A through E in Table 12.1. Each project costs $100
in the current period and provides a return one period later. The returns are expressed
in real terms; that is, they have been adjusted for inflation.
present value =
$110

$110

Lets look at the present value of these investments at various interest rates. At an
interest rate of 2 percent per year, only investment A is unprofitable. For the other
investments, the present value of the return exceeds the cost. If the interest rate in the
market increases to 4 percent, both A and B will be unprofitable. At an interest rate of
6 percent, A, B, and C will be unprofitable; D will be unprofitable as well if the mar-
ket interest rate increases to 8 percent. If the interest rate exceeds 9 percent, all the
investments will be unprofitable.
As interest rates rise, there will be fewer profitable investments in which firms
are willing to invest, and the total level of investment spending in the economy will
decline. Figure 12.3 depicts the negative relationship, graphically represented as
the downward-sloping line, between real interest rates and investment. As the
graph indicates, high real interest rates will deter investment spending. As an

261
PART 4
example, during the early 1980s when real interest rates rose, business investment
dropped sharply.
In practice, firms need to take into account other factors besides interest rates in
making their investment decisions. In the neoclassical theory of investment, pio-
neered by Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University, taxes along with real interest rates
play a key role in determining investment spending. Jorgenson used his theory to
analyze how investors respond to a variety of tax incentives, including investment
tax credits.
Should we use a real or nominal interest rate to determine whether to invest?
The answer is that it doesn t really matter, as long as we are consistent. If the future
benefits of the project are not adjusted for inflation, then we should use the nominal
interest rate because it takes into account overall inflation
inflation is built into the
nominal rate, so to speak. But if we first express the future benefits of the investment
in current dollars
that is, if we reduce their nominal value by the amount that
prices in the economy are expected to increase
then we should use the real rate of
interest in our calculations.
Keep this distinction between real and nominal interest rates in mind. If nominal
interest rates are 10 percent but inflation is 9 percent, the real rate of interest is only
1 percent. A firm makes its investment decisions by comparing its expected real net
return from investment projects to the real rate of interest. Just because nominal
interest rates are high does not mean the real interest rate is also high.
During the 1970s, homeowners in California understood this. They purchased
homes in record numbers, even though it meant borrowing money at interest rates
exceeding 10 percent. Buyers were willing to borrow at such high rates because hous-
ing prices in California had been rising by more than 10 percent annually, and they
believed the trend would continue. They realized, for example, that if housing prices
rose by 12 percent per year, they were essentially earning a 2 percent annual return
because their mortgage loans were just 10 percent. (They would earn the returns only
when they sold their homes.) That would make the real interest rate of the money
borrowed 2 percent. This caused a housing boom in California that lasted until hous-
ing prices stopped rising at such high rates.
Investment and the Stock Market
Economists have long noticed a correlation between the stock market and invest-
ment spending. All other things being equal, when the level of the stock market is
high, investment spending also tends to be high. It makes sense that the two are
related. Consider a firm s options when it wants to finance a new project. The firm
really has three choices: First, it can rely on its retained earnings
the earnings
the firm hasn t paid out in dividends to its owners. Second, it can borrow funds

from a bank or sell corporate bonds to the public. Third, it can issue and sell new
shares, or stock. When a firm s stock price is high, it can issue shares at a premium
and use the proceeds from their sale to finance new investments. The higher the
share price, the fewer shares the firm needs to sell to raise capital. This means,
essentially, that the cost of the project the firm wants to undertake falls as the com-
pany s stock price climbs. In other words, high stock prices lead to high investment.
This is known as the Q-theory of investment, and it was originally developed by
the late Nobel Laureate James Tobin of Yale University. In the boom of the late
1990s when the level of the stock market was high along with share prices, many
firms financed large investments by selling their shares.
During roughly this same time period, the stock market and investment spending
appeared to be even more tightly linked than in the past. Figure 12.4 plots the
Standard and Poors index of stock prices on the same graph as the share of investment
spending as a component of GDP from 1997 to 2003. As you can see, both the stock
market and investment spending rose sharply from 1997, peaking in mid-2000. They
then both fell sharply
the stock market plunged, investment spending fell, and the
economy entered a recession.

Both the stock market and investment spending rose sharply from 1997, peaking in mid-2000.
The reason the two were so tightly linked was that investors were overly opti-
mistic about the future. They believed that, driven by new technology, the newfound
economic prosperity would last forever (or at least certainly longer than it did). With
optimistic expectations about the future, stock prices should have been high because
stock prices are based on the present value of the dividends people expect firms to pay
in the future:
Because investors  expectations about future dividends were high, stock prices
were high. Firms, like individual investors, rushed to make massive, long-term invest-
ments, particularly in the fiber-optics and telecommunications industries. Some
observers questioned whether the expectations were rational. Still, there were enough
optimistic investors to sufficiently drive up prices.

PART 4
As we saw in Figure 12.1 on page 255, investment spending during this period in
the United States reached new highs. In many cases, stock prices for companies that
had never turned a profit nonetheless soared to astronomical heights. Unfortunately,
both investors and firms may have been subject to what former Federal Reserve
chairman Alan Greenspan famously dubbed irrational exuberance
something
similar to Keynes s animal spirits.  Although the economy had performed very well
in the late 1990s, it could not grow at those rates forever. Many investors and firms
believed it could, though. When they began to realize it couldn t, the stock market
plunged and investment plans were curtailed. What linked the stock market and
investment in both their rise and their fall were first optimistic and then pessimistic
expectations about the economy. Rather than causing the rise and fall of investment
spending, the stock market mirrored expectations about the economy held by firms
and individual investors.
HOW FINANCIAL INTERMEDIARIES
FACILITATE INVESTMENT
Households save and invest their funds for different reasons than firms. A typical cou-
ple might be saving money for their retirement or for their childrens education, and
they generally won t like the idea of their savings being subject to risk. They do, how-
ever, want their savings to be readily accessible and convertible to money
what econ-
omists call liquid
in case they have a financial emergency. Funds deposited in a bank
account, for example, provide a source of liquidity for households because they can be
withdrawn at any time.
Unlike households, firms and business managers are typically risk-takers. They
are gambling that their vision of the future will come true and make them vast profits.
These investors need funds they can tie up for long periods of time. For example, an
entrepreneur who wants to build a skyscraper or casino may need financing for several
years before beginning construction and for years afterward until the business begins
to produce profits.
Suppose individual entrepreneurs had to obtain funds directly from individual
savers. First, they would have to negotiate with thousands of people to obtain suffi-
cient funds. This would take a lot of time and be costly. Second, the savers would face
extraordinarily high risks if they loaned all their money to a single entrepreneur who
had a risky project to undertake. Not only would all their funds be tied up in a single
project, it would not be easy to monitor the investor s decisions. How could they be
certain the entrepreneur wouldn t run off with their money? Additionally, their invest-
ments would not be liquid. To compensate these savers for the risk they would be tak-
ing and the lack of liquidity they would face, entrepreneurs would have to pay them
extremely high interest rates, but higher interest rates would make it harder, perhaps
impossible, for the entrepreneur to make a profit. No prospect of profits would mean
no one would invest in the project in the first place. In other words, society would not
be able to turn its savings into profitable investment projects. Figure 12.5 depicts this
dilemma. How can the problem be solved?

The answer is through financial intermediaries. Financial intermediaries
include banks, savings and loans, insurance companies, brokerage firms, compa-
nies that run mutual funds, and other types of financial institutions. These institu-
tions accept funds from savers and make loans to businesses and individuals. For
example, a local bank accepts deposits from savers and uses the funds to make
loans to local businesses. Savings and loan institutions will accept deposits in sav-
ings accounts and use these funds to make loans, often for housing. Insurance
companies accept premium payments from individuals in exchange for the protec-
tion provided by the insurance payments. Then insurance companies lend the pre-
miums received to earn returns from investments so they can pay off the insurance
claims of individuals. Figure 12.6 shows how financial intermediaries create a
valuable link between savers and investors. Pooling the funds of savers to make
loans to individual borrowers reduces the costs of negotiation. Financial institu-
tions also have more expertise to evaluate and monitor investments than most
individual investors.

Financial Intermediaries
To some degree, these financial intermediaries also provide liquidity. In normal
circumstances, not all households withdraw their money at the same time, so financial
intermediaries can lend out most of the money and still have enough on hand to meet
withdrawals by depositors.
But how do financial intermediaries reduce risk? They do this by diversifying
investors  assets
by not putting all the eggs in one basket,  so to speak.
Intermediaries invest (that is, make loans) in a large number of projects whose returns,
although uncertain, are independent of one another. By independent, we mean the
return from one investment is unrelated to the return on another investment.
Consider a bank investing in a large number of projects that all together produce an
average return of 8 percent annually. Each project alone is risky and could pay a return
either higher or lower than 8 percent. However, as long as the returns on all these
projects are independent of one another, those with higher returns will likely offset
those with lower returns. By investing in a large number of projects, the bank
increases the odds that as a group the projects will earn 8 percent.
Other financial intermediaries reduce risks in related ways. A fire insurance
company accepts premiums from many individuals in communities throughout
the country and uses the funds to make investments. Because not all houses will

265
PART 4
burn down in the same year, the insurance company knows it will have a stable
source of funds for its investments. Insurance diversification works well only when
companies insure events that are independent of one another, however. Some sit-
uations are not independent and therefore can t easily be insured by the same
company. For example, an insurance company would be unwise to provide
earthquake insurance for just the Los Angeles area. If an earthquake did occur, the
firm would be faced with making payments to many clients who suffered loss with-
out anyone else s payments to offset them. In somewhat the same way, even bank
loans are not fully independent. During a recession, many more firms will
experience financial difficulties and have trouble meeting their loan obligations to
their banks.
In recent years, we have seen an innovation in financial intermediation. In the
past, if a savings and loan company made a loan to a home purchaser, it would hold
onto the loan until it was paid off. That meant the savings and loan could make new
loans or mortgages only if it was able to attract new deposits to provide the funds.
Two large government-sponsored financial intermediaries, Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac, changed the way mortgage markets operated. They purchased mort-
gages from savings and loans and banks throughout the country, packaged them, and
sold them to investors in the financial market. This enabled savings and loans to
offer additional mortgages with the funds they received from Fannie Mae or
Freddie Mac, and it allowed investors to own a part of a diversified collection of
mortgages from around the country. The private sector quickly adopted these prac-
tices as well.
The practice of purchasing loans, re-packaging them, and selling them to the
financial markets is known as securitization. Although it started with home mort-
gages, securitization now applies to other types of financial obligations, such as credit
card and consumer debt. Financial intermediaries will often borrow money from
financial markets to purchase loans in order to re-package and sell them. Using bor-
rowed funds to purchase assets is known as leverage. Increases in leverage increase
the risk that financial intermediaries undertake because they are obligated to pay off

UNDERWATER HOMES: BETS GONE WRONG
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Why Did Many Homeowners in 2010 Owe
More to Banks Than Their Home Was Worth?
In early 2010, one quarter of all U.S. homes were underwater.  No, there was not
massive flooding across the entire country. The term underwater means that
homeowners owed more on their mortgages than their home was worth. How did
this happen?
Consider someone who purchased a $600,000 home in 2007 and borrowed
$540,000 to make this purchase. Although the homeowner had invested $60,000, it
was still a highly levered investment. If the price of the home fell by 20 percent to
$480,000, the homeowner would still owe the bank the original $540,000 and be
$60,000 underwater.
In states where the housing boom was strongest
Nevada, Florida, Arizona, and
parts of California
this phenomenon was most pronounced. In the Las Vegas area,
for example, approximately 70 percent of all homeowners were underwater! This is a
striking example of the down-side from leverage.

When Financial Intermediaries Malfunction
Financial intermediation can sometimes go wrong. When it does, the economy suf-
fers. Important examples of the failure of financial intermediation include commercial
bank failures during the Great Depression, the U.S. savings and loan crisis of the
1980s, a similar crisis in Japan in the 1990s, and the U.S. housing credit and securiti-
zation crisis of 2007 and 2008.
In the early days of the Great Depression, many banks in the United States, par-
ticularly in rural areas, provided farmers and local businesses with loans that turned
out to be unprofitable. This worried depositors, and rumors circulated that banks
would fail. Depositors panicked, and many tried to withdraw their money simultane-
ously in what is called a bank run. During the Great Depression, bank runs occurred
throughout the world. In 1931, a panic broke out after the collapse of Creditanstalt,
Austria s largest bank. Banking panics occurred throughout other countries in Europe,
including Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Poland.
Few banks, profitable or unprofitable, can survive a run, because not all deposits
are kept on hand. The result of the bank runs was that thousands of healthy U.S.
banks shut down, leaving large parts of the United States without a banking system.
Many farms and businesses could no longer find a source of loans, and the severity of
the Great Depression worsened. Studies have shown that the countries with the most
severe banking panics were hardest hit by the Depression.
To prevent banking panics from happening again, in 1933 the U.S. government
began providing deposit insurance on money placed in banks and savings and
loans. Today deposit insurance guarantees the government will reimburse deposi-
tors for amounts up to $250,000 in each account at each bank should their banks
fail. Because everyone knows their deposits are secure, bank runs no longer regu-
larly occur. Today, most countries have some form of deposit insurance intended to
prevent panics.
Ironically, deposit insurance indirectly led to the U.S. savings and loan crisis,
which occurred during the 1980s. In the early 1970s, savings and loan institutions
(S&Ls) made mortgage loans to households at low interest rates. However, later in the
decade nominal interest rates rose sharply as inflation increased. The savings and
loans were in trouble: They had to pay high interest rates to attract deposits, but they
were earning interest at low rates from the money they had loaned out previously.
Many of the S&Ls failed.
The government tried to assist the savings and loan industry by broadening the
range of investments the industry could make. Some S&Ls soon began aggressively
investing in speculative real estate and other risky projects to earn higher returns.
Depositors weren t worried, though, because they knew their savings were insured by
the government. Unfortunately, many of these risky projects failed, and the govern-
ment was forced to bail out the S&Ls at a cost of nearly $100 billion to taxpayers.
Because depositors  savings were insured, most people didn t suffer directly from the
collapse of their savings and loan institutions. As taxpayers they suffered, though,
because they had to foot the bill.
Japan suffered similar problems in the 1990s. By 1995, seven of the eight largest
Japanese mortgage lenders had gone bankrupt following a crash in real estate prices.
Like the U.S. government, the Japanese government also used taxpayers  funds to bail
these lenders out.
The decline in housing prices that we described in the chapter opening story
triggered a severe crisis in the newly developed securitization markets. Although the
actual details are complex, the basic story is simple. Lenders had made loans to bor-
rowers who had limited ability to repay, and when borrowers began to miss pay-
ments or default on their loans, it caused major disruptions in the market for
securitized loans, which, in turn, disrupted credit to other sectors in the economy,

causing a massive disruption to financial markets. Even Fannie Mae and Freddie
Mac fell victim to the housing decline and were placed under direct government
control in September 2008.
As the housing-generated financial crisis spread to the rest of the financial mar-
kets, the credit markets essentially froze  and banks worldwide would no longer
lend to each other. Customers scrambled to withdraw their funds in financial insti-
tutions that they perceived were weak, leading to a run  on these institutions. As a
result, financial institutions such as Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers were forced
to close and institutions such as Merrill Lynch and Wachovia Bank were taken
over by other financial institutions. When the financial institution Lehman
Brothers failed it set off a panic in the markets that spread to other international
banks and financial institutions. The stock market plunged dramatically world-
wide, reflecting the severity of the crisis and fear that it would lead to a total
worldwide financial collapse. As credit became unavailable, businesses began to
suffer as well, as they were not able to borrow funds to run their enterprises on a
day-to-day basis. State and local government also found it nearly impossible to
borrow at the height of the crisis.
Governments around the world took a number of steps to alleviate this crisis.
Central banks, whose activities during the crisis are described in more detail in the
next chapter, provided loans and credit through a wide variety of channels. After
considerable turmoil, the U.S. Congress passed a bailout package, called the
Troubled Asset Relief Program, or TARP, that enabled the Treasury to use up to
$700 billion to shore up the financial system. Following the lead of Great Britain,
the U.S. Treasury used some of these proceeds to provide funds to large banks in

SECURITIZATION: THE GOOD, THE BAD, AND THE UGLY
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: How have recent financial innovations
created new risks for the economy?
As securitization developed, it allowed financial intermediaries to provide new funds
for borrowers to enter the housing market. This led to a rise in the rate of homeown-
ership and was hailed as a positive development. But there was a dark side to this
process as well.
As the housing boom began in 2002, lenders and home purchasers began to take
increasing risks. Lenders made subprime  loans to borrowers with limited ability
to actually repay their mortgages and did not exercise full diligence in making loans.
Some households were willing to take on considerable debt because they were con-
fident they could make money in a rising housing market. Lenders securitized the
subprime loans and financial firms offered exotic investment securities to investors
based on these loans. Many financial institutions purchased these securities without
really knowing what was inside them. Because the securities were so new, the agen-
cies that traditionally evaluated the riskiness of these investments did not post suffi-
cient warning.
When the housing boom stopped and borrowers stopped making payments on
subprime loans, it created panic in the financial market. Not only did investors
and financial firms now realize their investments were extremely risky, they began
to worry about the creditworthiness of banks and other financial intermediaries
that held these securities as assets. Many were highly leveraged and exposed to
great risk. Effectively, through securitization the damage from the subprime
loans spread to the entire financial market, causing a major crisis.

In this chapter we discussed
investment spending, present
value, interest rates, and finan-
cial intermediaries. We saw that
investment spending is volatile,
rising and falling sharply with real
GDP, and depends on expecta-
tions about the future. By devel-
oping the concept of present value, we saw how firms can make
investment decisions when the costs and benefits of an invest-
ment occur at different times. We also explained why invest-
ment spending also depends inversely on real interest rates and
explained the distinction between real and nominal interest
rates. Finally, we examined how financial intermediaries channel
funds from savers to investors, reduce interest rates, and pro-
mote investment
and sometimes malfunction. Here are the
main points to keep in mind:
1 Investments incur costs today but provide benefits in
the future.
2 Investment spending is a volatile component of GDP
because expectations about the future are uncertain and
ever changing.
3 We use the concept of present value to compare the costs
and benefits of investments that occur at different points in
time. The present value of a payment K, t years in the future,
at an interest rate of i is
4 The real interest rate equals the nominal interest rate
minus inflation.
5 Investment spending depends inversely on real interest rates.
6 Financial intermediaries reduce the risk and costs of making
investments by pooling the funds of savers and monitoring
the projects of borrowers. Financial intermediaries can
package loans for sale to the broader financial markets
through securitization.

efficient, they can break down at times, causing severe eco-
nomic disruptions.

order to restore confidence in the financial system and took limited ownership in
these banks. As previously noted, the government took control of Fannie Mae and
Freddie Mac and also provided funding to some large financial firms, such as the
American International Group (AIG), which provided financial insurance to other
firms and was deemed essential to keep afloat during the crisis. The United States
and other countries around the world also increased the limits on the amounts eligi-
ble for deposit insurance to bolster consumer confidence in banking institutions.
The goals of all these actions were to restore confidence in a system of financial
intermediation that was under considerable stress.
From these examples you can see why financial intermediation does not always
work. There is a continual debate on the role government should play in investment
decisions for the economy and its role in regulating financial intermediaries. Today,
some economists and policymakers are carefully reassessing the risks in our complex
financial markets.

A Leverage Example. Suppose you purchased an asset
for $1000. The asset is risky and can either increase in
value to $1,200 or fall in value to $900. Lets look at the
effects of leverage on your returns to this investment.
a. Suppose you did not borrow any money, but put in
your own $1000 to purchase the asset. What
percent gain would you make if the asset increased
and what percent loss would you experience if the
asset fell in value?

asset. What is your percentage gain or loss on your
investment now?

However, it became a risky way of doing business for
U.S. savings and loans in the 1970s. Explain why mak-
ing loans only for housing and holding on to the mort-
gages may be very risky. Why does this risk provide a
rationale for securitization?

Diversification
This classroom exercise illustrates the power of diversifica-
tion. Your instructor will describe the game and how to par-
ticipate. To take part in this exercise, you need to recall a
simple lesson from basic statistics: If you flip a coin many
times, the fraction of heads that results approaches one-half
as you increase the number of flips.
You are offered a chance to play this game in which you
receive a payoff according to the following formula:
 number of tosses) - 0.5]
 + $100 [(number of heads>
Payoff = $10
In this game, you first get $10, but you win or lose addi-
tional funds, depending on whether the fraction of heads
that comes up exceeds one-half.
To help you understand what s going on in this game,
suppose you toss the coin only once. Here, the outcome
depends only on whether the coin comes up either heads
or tails:
The game does have a positive expected payoff. The
expected or average payoff for this game is the probability of
Tails: $10 + $100(0>1 - 0.5) = - $40
Heads: $10 + $100(1>1 - 0.5) = $60

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
As long as there has been paper money, there have
been counterfeiters. To combat these counterfeiters
(many of whom now just use high-quality photo-
copiers to recreate money), the U.S. Treasury has intro-
duced one cutting-edge printing technique after
another. For example, if you hold a real $5 dollar bill
up to the light, you ll notice a faint hologram of Lincoln
directly to the right of his printed image. The holo-
gram can t be reproduced easily with a photocopier
but is easily visible to cashiers and bank personnel
(and anyone else willing to look).
The government must keep innovating to stay
ahead. In 2008 the Federal Reserve Banks issued a
redesigned $5 bill with two new watermarks and a
security thread that glows blue under ultraviolet
light, with numbers and letters running alongside.
These may all seem like technological marvels, but
the institution of money is an even greater miracle.

273
PART 5
T
he term money has a special meaning for economists, so in this chapter we ll
look carefully at how money is defined and the role it plays in the economy.
The overall level of money affects the performance of an economy. In
Chapter 9, we learned that increases in the money supply increase aggregate demand.
In the short run, when prices are largely fixed, this increase will raise total demand and
output. But in the long run, continuing money growth leads to inflation.
Our nation s central bank, the Federal Reserve (commonly called the Fed ), is
responsible for controlling the money supply. In this chapter, we ll see how the
Federal Reserve is structured, how it operates, and why it s so powerful.
WHAT IS MONEY?
Economists define money as any items that are regularly used in economic transac-
tions or exchanges and accepted by buyers and sellers. Let s consider some examples of
money used in that way.
We use money regularly every day. In a coffee shop, we hand the person behind
the counter some dollar bills and coins, and we receive a cup of coffee. This is an
example of an economic exchange: One party hands over currency
the dollar bills
and the coins
and the other party hands over goods and services
the coffee. Why
do the owners of coffee shops accept dollar bills and coins in payment for coffee? The
reason is that they will be making other economic exchanges with the dollar bills and
coins they accept. Suppose a cup of coffee costs $1.50 and 100 cups are sold in a day.
The seller then has $150 in currency. If the coffee costs the seller $100, the seller pays
$100 of the currency received and keeps $50 for other expenses and profits. Money
makes that possible.
In the real world, transactions are somewhat more complicated. The coffee shop
owners take the currency they receive each day, deposit it in bank accounts, and then
pay suppliers with checks drawn on those accounts. Clearly, currency is money because
it is used to purchase coffee. Checks also function as money because they are used to
pay suppliers. In some ancient cultures, precious stones were used in exchanges. In
more recent times, gold bars have served as money. During World War II, prisoners of
war did not have currency, but they did have rations of cigarettes, so they used them
like money, trading them for what they wanted.
Three Properties of Money
Regardless of what money is used in a particular society, it serves several functions,
all related to making economic exchanges easier. Here we discuss three key proper-
ties of money.
MONEY SERVES AS A MEDIUM OF EXCHANGE
As our examples illustrate,
money is given by buyers to sellers in economic exchanges; therefore, it serves as a
medium of exchange. Suppose you had a car you wanted to sell in order to buy a boat
and money did not exist. You could look for a person who had a boat and wanted to
buy a car and then trade your car directly for a boat. This is an example of barter: the
exchange of one good or service for another.
But there are obvious problems with barter. Suppose local boat owners were
interested in selling boats but not interested in buying your car. Unless there were a
double coincidence of wants
that is, unless you wanted to trade a car for a boat,
and the boat owner wanted to trade a boat for your car
this economic exchange
wouldn t occur. The probability of a double coincidence of wants occurring is very,
very tiny. Even if a boat owner wanted a car, he or she might want a different type of
car than yours.
By serving as a medium of exchange, money solves this bartering problem. The
car owner can sell the car to anyone who wants it and receive money in return. With
that money, the car owner can then find someone who owns a boat and purchase the

boat for money. The boat owner can use the money in any way he or she pleases. With
money, there is no need for a double coincidence of wants. This is why money exists
in all societies: It makes economic transactions much easier.
Here is another way to think about this. One of our key principles of economics is
that individuals are better off through voluntary exchange.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  V O L U N TA R Y  E X C H A N G E
A voluntary exchange between two people makes both people better off.
Money allows individuals to actually make these exchanges. Without money, we would
be left with a barter system, and most transactions that make both people better off
would not be possible.
MONEY SERVES AS A UNIT OF ACCOUNT
Money also provides a convenient
measuring rod when prices for all goods are quoted in money terms. A boat may be
listed for sale at $5,000 in money terms, a car at $10,000, and a movie ticket at $5. We
could, in principle, quote everything in terms of movie tickets. The boat would be
worth 1,000 tickets, and the car would be worth 2,000 tickets. But because we are
using money and not movie tickets as a medium of exchange, it is much easier to
express all prices in terms of money. A unit of account is a standard unit in which we
can state prices and compare the value of goods and services. In our economy, money
is the unit of account because we quote all prices in terms of money. It is convenient to
use the medium of exchange as the unit of account, so we can quote prices for all goods
and services in terms of the same units we use in transactions
in our case, money.
MONEY SERVES AS A STORE OF VALUE
If you sell your car to purchase a boat,
you may not be able to purchase the boat immediately. In the meantime, you will be
holding the money you received from the sale. Ideally, during that period, the value of
the money will not fall. What we are referring to here is the function of money as a
store of value.
Money is actually a somewhat imperfect store of value because of inflation.
Suppose inflation is 10 percent a year, which means average prices rise 10 percent
each year. Let s say you sold a tennis racket for $100 in order to buy 10 CDs worth
$100, but you waited a year to buy them. Unfortunately, because of inflation, at the
end of the year the 10 CDs cost $110 (%100 * 1.10), or $11 each. With your $100,
you can now buy only 9 CDs and get $1 in change. Your money has lost some of its
stored value.
As long as inflation is low and you do not hold the money for a long time, the loss
in its purchasing power won t be a big problem. But as inflation rates increase, money
becomes less useful as a store of value.
Different Types of Monetary Systems
Through history, the world has witnessed different types of monetary systems. In one
system a commodity serves as money, such as gold or silver in bars or coins. This is an
example of commodity money. At some point, governments began issuing paper
money. However, the paper money was backed by an underlying commodity, for
example, so many ounces of gold per unit of paper currency. Under a traditional gold
standard, an individual could present paper money to the government and receive its
stated value in gold. In other words, paper money could be exchanged for gold. Until
1933 in the United States, individuals could exchange their dollars for gold. However,
President Franklin Roosevelt banned private possession of gold in 1933, although for-
eign governments could still exchange dollars for gold until 1971. The next step in the
evolution of monetary systems was to break the tie between paper money and gold
and create a system of fiat money. Fiat money has no intrinsic value like gold or
silver
it is simply created by a government decree and becomes the official legal

tender of the society. In the United States today, if you take a $100 bill to the govern-
ment you will not receive any gold or silver
just another $100 bill in return.
You may wonder what gives money value under a fiat system if it has no intrinsic
value. The answer is that the government controls the value of fiat money by control-
ling its supply in the economy. That is why it is important to prevent counterfeiting,
as our chapter-opening story described. In the next chapter, we will see precisely how
the government controls the supply of money.
Measuring Money in the U.S. Economy
In the United States and other modern economies, people can carry out economic
transactions in several different ways. In practice, this leads to different measures of
money. The most basic measure of money in the United States is called M1. It is the
sum of currency in the hands of the public, demand deposits, other checkable deposits,
and traveler s checks. M1 totaled $1,712 billion in March 2010. Table 13.1 contains
the components of M1 and their size; Figure 13.1 shows their relative percentages.
M2
M1 plus other assets, including deposits in
savings and loans accounts and money
market mutual funds.
The first part of M1 is currency held by the public, that is, all currency held out-
side bank vaults. The second component is deposits in checking accounts, called
demand deposits. Until the 1980s, checking accounts did not pay interest. The third
component, other checkable deposits, was introduced in the early 1980s and did pay
interest. Today, the distinction between the two types of deposit accounts is not as
meaningful as it used to be because many checking accounts earn interest if the bal-
ances are sufficiently high. Finally, travelers checks are included in M1 because they
are regularly used in economic exchanges.
Lets take a closer look at the amount of currency in the economy. Because there
are approximately 300 million people in the United States, the $871 billion of cur-
rency amounts to over $2,903 in currency for every man, woman, and child in the
United States. Do you and your friends each have $2,903 of currency?
Most of the currency in the official statistics is not used in ordinary commerce in
the United States. Who is using and holding this currency? Some is used in illegal
transactions such as the drug trade. Few drug dealers open bank accounts to deposit
currency. In addition, a substantial fraction of U.S. currency is held abroad.
M1 does not include all the assets we use to make economic exchanges. M2 is a
somewhat broader definition of money that includes M1 plus deposits in saving
accounts, deposits in money market mutual funds, and time deposits of less than
$100,000. These investment-type assets often can t readily be used for exchanges

CITY-ISSUED MONEY IN THE GREAT DEPRESSION
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: What types of money did cities issue during
the Great Depression?
As banks failed during the Great Depression, residents in many cities and towns faced
a shortage of money to make transactions. Both individuals and businesses lost funds
in failed banks or had their funds frozen during banking closure. While some busi-
nesses and individuals resorted to barter, this strategy naturally had its limitations.
A number of cities around the country began issuing their own currencies and
perhaps, at its peak in the 1930s, a total of $1 billion was in circulation. Some corpo-
ration and school boards also issued their own scrip. Some of it looked like regular
government-issued money, but there were some unusual creations. Two California
towns issued their money on clamshells and Hal s Tire Service in Oregon created
$1 bills on old tires.
Whatever party issued the money obtained goods in exchange for this scrip and
thus directly benefited from issuing new money. These benefits would last until they
were forced to return real U.S. money in exchange for their privately-issued scrip.

Economists use different definitions of money because it is not always clear which
assets are used primarily as money
that is, which assets are used for economic
exchanges and which are used primarily for saving and investing. Money market
mutual funds came into existence only in the late 1970s. Some people temporarily
park  their assets in these funds, anticipating they will move them into riskier,
higher-earning stock market investments later. Others may use them to earn interest
while avoiding the risks of the stock market or bond market. Sometimes, people use
money market mutual funds like regular checking accounts or like savings accounts. If
money market mutual funds are used like checking accounts, they should be consid-
ered part of M1. If they are used like savings accounts, however, they should be part of
M2. Economists keep an eye on both M1 and M2 because they don t know precisely
how people are using all these money market accounts.
Although consumers commonly use credit cards to make transactions in our
economy, they are not part of the money supply. Here s why: Suppose you have a
credit card from the First Union Bank and purchase a new television from an elec-
tronics store. As you use your credit card, you are effectively borrowing the amount

The figure shows a hypothetical balance sheet for a bank holding 10 percent in required reserves,

the amounts they are required to hold. This bank has loaned out all of its excess reserves, $2,000.
you charge from the First Union Bank, which, in turn, will pay the electronics store
on your behalf. When you receive your credit card bill from the bank, you must begin
to pay off the loan. Credit cards enable you to purchase goods now but pay for them at
a later date. Unlike money, a credit card is not a medium of exchange, a unit of
account, or a store of value. Credit cards do make it easier to conduct business, but
they are not an official part of the money supply.
What about debit cards? If you own a debit card, you can use it to access the
funds you have in your checking account when you make the transaction. When you
use your debit card to make a purchase
say at a supermarket
it is exactly the same
thing as writing a check. Thus, a debit card is not an independent source of money.
The money supply consists of the balances in checking accounts plus currency held by
the public.
HOW BANKS CREATE MONEY
In this section, we will learn the role that banks play in the creation of money in a
modern economy. To understand this role, we first have to look more carefully at the
behavior of banks.
A Bank s Balance Sheet: Where the Money Comes from and
Where It Goes
In Chapter 12 we learned that a typical commercial bank accepts funds from savers in
the form of deposits, for example, in checking accounts. The bank does not leave
all these funds idle, because if it did it would never make a profit. Instead, the bank turns
the money around and loans it out to borrowers. It will be easier to understand how
banks create money if we first look at a simplified balance sheet for a commercial bank.
The balance sheet will show us how the bank raises money and what it does with it.
Balance sheets have two sides: one for assets and one for liabilities. Liabilities are
the source of funds for the bank. If you open a checking account and deposit your
funds in it, the bank is liable for returning the funds to you when you want them. The
bank must also pay you interest on the account if you keep enough money in it. Your
deposits are therefore the bank s liabilities. Assets, in contrast, generate income for
the bank. Loans made by the bank are examples of its assets, because borrowers must
pay interest on the loans the bank collects.
When a bank is initially opened, its owners must place their own funds into it so it
has some startup funds. We call these funds owners  equity. If the bank subsequently
makes a profit, owners  equity increases; if it loses money, owners  equity decreases.
In Figure 13.3, we show the assets and liabilities of a hypothetical bank. On the
liability side, the bank has $2,000 of deposits, and owners  equity is $200. Owners
equity is entered on the liability side of the balance sheet because it is a source of the
bank s funds. The total source of funds is therefore $2,200
the deposits in the bank
plus owners  equity.

Process of Deposit Creation:
Changes in Balance Sheets
The figure shows how an initial deposit
of $1,000 can expand the money sup-
ply. The first three banks in the figure
loaned out all their excess reserves and
the borrowers deposited the full sum of
their loans. In the real world, though,
people hold part of their loans as cash
and banks don t necessarily loan out all
their excess reserves. Consequently, a
smaller amount of money will be cre-
ated than whats shown here.
On the asset side, the bank holds $200 in reserves. These are assets that are not
lent out. Reserves can be either cash kept in a bank s vaults or deposits in the nations
central bank, the Federal Reserve. Banks are required by law to hold a specific fraction
of their deposits as reserves, called required reserves. If a bank chooses to hold addi-
tional reserves beyond what is required, these are called excess reserves. A bank s
reserves are the sum of its required and excess reserves.
In our example, the bank is holding 10 percent of its deposits, or $200, as reserves.
The remainder of the banks assets, $2,000, consists of the loans it has made. By con-
struction, total assets will always equal liabilities, including owners  equity. Balance
sheets must therefore always balance.
How Banks Create Money
To understand the role banks play in determining the supply of money, lets suppose
someone walks into the First Bank of Hollywood and deposits $1,000 in cash to open
a checking account. Because currency held by the public and checking deposits are
both included in the supply of money, the total money supply has not changed with
this transaction. The cash deposited into the checking account reduced the currency
held by the public by precisely the amount the checking account increased it.
Now lets assume banks keep 10 percent of their deposits as reserves. That means
the reserve ratio
the ratio of reserves to deposits
will be 0.1. The First Bank of
Hollywood will keep $100 in reserves and make loans totaling $900. The top panel in
Figure 13.4 shows the change in the First Bank of Hollywoods balance sheet after it
has made its loan.
Suppose the First Bank of Hollywood loans the funds to an aspiring movie producer.
The producer opens a checking account at the First Bank of Hollywood with the $900 he
borrowed. He then buys film equipment from a supplier, who accepts his $900 check and
deposits it in the Second Bank of Burbank. The next panel in Figure 13.4 shows what
happens to the balance sheet of the Second Bank of Burbank. Liabilities increase by the

deposit of $900. The bank holds $90 in reserves (10 percent of the $900 deposit) and can
lend out $810.
Suppose the Second Bank of Burbank lends the $810 to the owner of a coffee-
house and she opens a checking account there with the $810 as her balance. She then
purchases $810 worth of coffee with a check made out to a coffee supplier, who
deposits it into the Third Bank of Venice.
The Third Bank of Venice receives a deposit of $810. It keeps $81 in reserves and
can lend out $729. This process continues throughout the Los Angeles area with new
loans and deposits. The Fourth Bank of Pasadena will receive a deposit of $729, hold
$72.90 in reserves, and lend out $656.10. The Fifth Bank of Compton will receive a
deposit of $656.10, and the process goes on.
How the Money Multiplier Works
The original $1,000 cash deposit has created checking account balances throughout
Los Angeles. What s the total amount? Adding up the new accounts in all the banks
(even the ones we have not named), we have
How did we come up with this sum? It s from the following simple formula, which we
derive in the appendix to this chapter:
In our example, the reserve ratio is 0.1, so the increase in checking account bal-
ances is 1/0.1, or 10 times the initial cash deposit. The initial $1,000 deposit led to a
total increase in checking account balances of $10,000 throughout all of the banks.
Recall that the money supply, M1, is the sum of deposits at commercial banks plus
currency held by the public. Therefore, the change in the money supply, M1, will be
the change in deposits in checking accounts plus the change in currency held by the
public. Notice that we referred to change,  meaning an increase or decrease. Here s
why: In our example, the public, represented by the person who initially made the
$1,000 deposit at the First Bank of Hollywood, holds $1,000 less in currency.
However, deposits increased by $10,000. Therefore, the money supply, M1, increased
by $9,000 ($10,000  $1,000). No single bank lent out more than it had in deposits.
Yet for the banking system as a whole, the money supply expanded by a multiple of the
initial cash deposit.
The term 1/reserve ratio in the formula is called the money multiplier. It tells us
what the total increase in checking account deposits would be for any initial cash
deposit. Recall the multiplier for government spending in our demand-side models:
An increase in government spending led to larger increases in output through the
multiplier. The government-spending multiplier arose because additional rounds of
consumption spending were triggered by an initial increase in government spending.
In the banking system, an initial cash deposit triggers additional rounds of deposits
and lending by banks. This leads to a multiple expansion of deposits.
As of 2010 in the United States, banks were required to hold 3 percent in reserves
against checkable deposits between $10.7 million and $55.2 million and 10 percent on all
checkable deposits exceeding $55.2 million. Because large banks would face a 10 percent
reserve requirement on any new deposits, you might think, on the basis of our formula,
that the money multiplier would be approximately 10.
However, the money multiplier for the United States has typically been between
two and three
much smaller than the value of 10 implied by our simple formula. There
are two reasons for this. First, our formula assumed all loans made their way directly
into checking accounts. In reality, people hold part of their loans as cash. That cash is

not available for the banking system to lend out. The more money people hold in cash,
the less they have on deposit that can be loaned out again. This decreases the money
multiplier. Second, the money multiplier will also be less if banks held excess reserves.
Until recently, this was not an important factor, but a recent change to pay interest on
excess reserves has sharply increased their levels. We can represent these factors in a
money multiplier ratio, but it will not be as simple as the one we introduced here.
How the Money Multiplier Works in Reverse
The money-creation process also works in reverse. Suppose you go to your bank and
ask for $1,000 in cash from your checking account. The bank must pay you the
$1,000. The bank s liabilities fall by $1,000, but its assets must also fall by $1,000.

Required and Total Reserves
of Banks
Until September of 2008, banks held
few excess reserves so total reserves (in
red) were very close to required
reserves (in purple). In response to the
financial crisis of 2008, the Fed injected
large amounts of reserves into the sys-
tem and began paying interest on
reserves in October. As a result, excess
reserves rose and total reserves now
exceed excess reserves.
A P P L I C AT I O N 2
THE GROWTH IN EXCESS RESERVES
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: Why have banks recently started to hold
vast amounts of excess reserves?
During the height of the financial crisis in September 2008, the Fed injected large
amounts of reserves into banks, and in the next month, it started paying interest to
banks on these reserves. Prior to this time, banks earned no interest on either required
or excess reserves. This created an incentive for banks to keep minimal excess reserves
and lend any extra funds they had. However, once banks began to earn interest on
excess reserves, they did not have to lend their funds out to earn interest. If lending
opportunities were not very attractive, the bank could safely keep their funds on hand.
As Figure 13.5 indicates, banks have responded to the new incentives. Prior to the
change in law, banks held few excess reserves. After the change in the law, excess
reserves increased sharply and total reserves now far exceed required reserves. In the
long run, the Federal Reserve will need to make sure that banks do not lend out too
many reserves or the result will be higher inflation.
Related to Exercises 2.2 and 2.10.

281
PART 5
Withdrawing your $1,000 means two things at the bank. First, if the reserve ratio is
0.1, the bank will reduce its reserves by $100. Second, your $1,000 withdrawal minus
the $100 reduction in reserves means the bank has $900 less to lend out. The bank will
therefore reduce its loans by $900. With fewer loans, there will be fewer deposits in
other banks. The money multiplier working in reverse decreases the money supply.
You may wonder how a bank goes about reducing its outstanding loans. If you had
borrowed from a bank to invest in a project for your business, you would not want the
bank phoning you to ask for its funds, which are not lying idle but are invested in your
business. So banks do not typically call in outstanding loans from borrowers. Instead,
if banks cannot tap into their excess reserves when their customers want to withdraw
cash, they have to make fewer new loans. In these circumstances, a new potential bor-
rower would find it harder to obtain a loan from the bank.
Up to this point, our examples have always started with an initial cash deposit.
However, suppose Paul receives a check from Freda and deposits it into his bank.
Pauls bank will eventually receive payment from Freda s bank. When it does, it will
initially have an increase in both deposits and reserves
just as if a cash deposit were
made. Because Pauls bank has to hold only a fraction of the deposits as reserves, it will
be able to make loans with the remainder.
However, there is one crucial difference between this example, in which one indi-
vidual writes a check to another, and our earlier example, in which an individual makes
a cash deposit: When Paul receives the check from Freda, the money supply will not
be changed in the long run. Here s why: When Freda s check is deposited in Paul s
bank, the money supply will begin to expand, but when Fredas bank loses its deposit,
the money supply will start to contract. The expansions and contractions offset each
other when private citizens and firms write checks to one another.
In the next chapter, we will see how the Federal Reserve can change the money
supply to stabilize the economy. In the remainder of this chapter, we ll look at the
structure of the Federal Reserve and the critical role that it plays as a central bank sta-
bilizing the financial system.
A BANKER S BANK: THE FEDERAL RESERVE
The Federal Reserve System was created in 1913 after a series of financial panics in
the United States. Financial panics can occur when there is bad news about the econ-
omy or the stability of financial institutions. During these panics, numerous bank runs
occurred, depleting the funds on hand that banks could loan out. Severe economic
downturns followed.
Congress created the Federal Reserve System to be a central bank, or a bankers
bank.  One of the Feds primary jobs is thus to serve as a lender of last resort. When
banks need to borrow money during a financial crisis, they can turn to the central
bank as a last resort  for these funds. If a bank experienced a run, the Federal Reserve
could lend it the funds it needed.
Functions of the Federal Reserve
The Federal Reserve has several key functions. Lets briefly describe them.
THE FED SUPPLIES CURRENCY TO THE ECONOMY
Working through the
banking system, the Federal Reserve is responsible for supplying currency to the
economy. Although currency is only one component of the money supply, if individu-
als prefer to hold currency rather than demand deposits, the Federal Reserve and the
banking system will facilitate the public s preferences.
THE FED PROVIDES A SYSTEM OF CHECK COLLECTION AND CLEARING
The
Federal Reserve is responsible for making our system of complex financial transac-
tions work.  This means that when Paul writes Freda a check, the Federal Reserve
oversees the banks to ensure Fredas bank receives the funds from Paul s bank. This is

known as check clearing. As our economy moves to more electronic transactions, the
Federal Reserve provides oversight over these transactions as well.
THE FED HOLDS RESERVES FROM BANKS AND OTHER DEPOSITORY
INSTITUTIONS AND REGULATES BANKS
As we have seen, banks are required to
hold reserves with the Federal Reserve System. The Federal Reserve also serves as a
regulator to banks to ensure they are complying with rules and regulations. Ulti-
mately, the Federal Reserve wants to ensure the financial system is safe.
THE FED CONDUCTS MONETARY POLICY
One of the important responsibili-
ties of the Federal Reserve is to conduct monetary policy, the range of actions that
influence the level of real GDP or inflation.
Virtually all countries have central banks. The Indian central bank is known as the
Reserve Bank of India. In the United Kingdom, the central bank is the Bank of
England. Central banks serve as lenders of last resort to the banks in their countries
and also help to control the level of economic activity. If the economy is operating at a
level thats too hot  or too cold,  they can manipulate the money supply to fend off
economic problems. We ll see how central banks use monetary policy to influence real
GDP or inflation and fend off economic problems in the next chapter.
The Structure of the Federal Reserve
When members of Congress created the Federal Reserve System, they were aware the
institution would be very powerful. Consequently, they deliberately created a structure
that attempted to disperse the power, moving it away from major U.S. financial centers
(such as New York) to other parts of the country. They divided the United States into
12 Federal Reserve districts, each of which has a Federal Reserve Bank. These district
banks provide advice on monetary policy, take part in decision making on monetary pol-
icy, and act as a liaison between the Fed and the banks in their districts.
Figure 13.6 shows where each of the 12 Federal Reserve Banks is located. At the time
the Fed was created, economic and financial power in the United States was concentrated

in the East and the Midwest. Although this is no longer the case, the locations of the
Federal Reserve Banks still reflect the Feds historical roots. Which major western city
does not have a Federal Reserve Bank? It is, of course, Los Angeles.
There are two other subgroups of the Fed in addition to the Federal Reserve
Banks. The Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve is the true seat of power in
the Federal Reserve System. Headquartered in Washington, D.C., the seven members
of the board are appointed for 14-year terms by the president and confirmed by the
Senate. The chairperson serves a 4-year term as the principal spokesperson for mone-
tary policy in the United States. Financial markets throughout the world anticipate
and carefully observe what the chairperson says.
The third subgroup of the Fed is the Federal Open Market Committee
(FOMC), which makes decisions about monetary policy. The FOMC is a 12-person
board consisting of the 7 members of the Board of Governors, the president of the
New York Federal Reserve Bank, and the presidents of four other regional Federal
Reserve Banks. (The presidents of the regional banks other than New York serve on a
rotating basis; the 7 nonvoting bank presidents attend the meetings and offer their
opinions.) The chairperson of the Board of Governors also serves as the chairperson
of the FOMC. The FOMC makes the actual decisions on changes in the money sup-
ply. Its members are assisted by vast teams of professionals at the Board of Governors
and at the regional Federal Reserve Banks. The structure of the Federal Reserve
System is depicted in Figure 13.7.

Federal Reserve

On paper, monetary policymaking power appears to be spread throughout the gov-
ernment and the country. In practice, however, the Board of Governors, and especially
the chairperson, has the real control. The Board of Governors operates with consider-
able independence. Presidents and members of Congress can bring political pressures
on the Board of Governors, but their 14-year terms tend to insulate the members from
external pressures. The current chairman of the Federal Reserve is Ben S. Bernanke,
who began his term on February 1, 2006.
The Independence of the Federal Reserve
Countries differ in the degree to which their central banks are independent of politi-
cal authorities. In the United States, the chairperson of the Board of Governors is
required to report to Congress on a regular basis, but in practice the Fed makes its
own decisions and later informs Congress what it did. The Fed chairperson also often
meets with members of the executive branch to discuss economic affairs. Following
the Fed s interventions during the financial crisis, there is increasing interest in
Congress to make the Fed disclose additional information.

CHAPTER 13
MONEY AND THE BANKING SYSTEM
284
The central banks in both the United States and the United Kingdom currently
operate with considerable independence of elected officials. In other countries, the cen-
tral bank is part of the treasury department of the government and is potentially subject
to more direct political control. There has been a lively debate among economists and
political scientists as to whether countries with more independent central banks (banks
with less external political pressure) experience less inflation. Central banks that are not
independent will always be under pressure to help finance their countrys government
deficits by creating money. We ll see in a later chapter that when central banks succumb
to this pressure, the result is inflation. Independence, on the other hand, typically means
less inflation.
WHAT THE FEDERAL RESERVE DOES
DURING A FINANCIAL CRISIS
As the lender of last resort, the Fed can quell disturbances in the financial markets.
Lets look at a historical example and the Fed s action in the midst of the 2008 finan-
cial crisis.
13.4
A P P L I C AT I O N 3
THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM UNDER STRESS: SEPTEMBER 11, 2001
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: How did the Fed manage to keep the
financial system in operation immediately following the attacks on
September 11, 2001?
The Fed was tested on September 11, 2001, following the terrorist attacks against the
United States. Many financial firms keep little cash on hand and expect to borrow on
a daily basis to pay their ongoing bills and obligations. When the financial markets
closed after September 11, many of these firms were in trouble. Unless some actions
were taken quickly, they would default on their debts, leading to payment problems
for other firms and further defaults. To prevent a default avalanche, the Federal
Reserve immediately took a number of steps to provide additional funds to the finan-
cial system.
The first tool the Federal Reserve used was to allow banks to borrow more.
Ordinarily the volume of these direct loans from the Federal Reserve is not very large.
On Wednesday, September 12, total lending to banks rose to $45.5 billion, up from
just $99 million the week before.
The Federal Reserve System also serves as a clearinghouse for checks. A bank will
bring checks it receives from customers to the Federal Reserve and receive immediate
credit on its accounts. The Federal Reserve then debits the account of the bank upon
which the check was written. The difference between the credits and the debits
extended by the Federal Reserve is called the Federal Reserve float.  Immediately fol-
lowing September 11, the Federal Reserve allowed this float to increase sharply from
$2.9 billion to $22.9 billion. These actions effectively put an additional $20 billion into
the banking system.
The Federal Reserve also purchased government securities in the marketplace
and as a result put $30 billion into the hands of private citizens and their banks. It
arranged to provide dollars to foreign central banks such as the Bank of England so
they could meet their needs and the needs of their banks to facilitate any dollar trans-
actions they had during the crisis. Taken together, these actions increased the credit
extended by the Federal Reserve by over $90 billion. This massive response prevented
a financial panic that could have had devastating effects on the world economy.

A P P L I C AT I O N 4
COPING WITH THE FINANCIAL CHAOS CAUSED BY THE
MORTGAGE CRISIS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: How did the Fed successfully respond to
the collapse of major financial institutions in 2008?
Sunday, March 16, 2008, was not a peaceful day for the Board of Governors. Over
the prior week, one of Wall Street s most famous investment houses, Bear Stearns,
had gone into full collapse. Although Bears Stearns had roughly $17 billion in
readily available assets, it appeared this was not enough to satisfy the market.
Other investment firms believed Bear Stearns had made so many poor investments
that it was not financially viable. They rapidly began pulling out their funds from
the firm.
The Fed feared that a complete collapse of Bear Stearns would devastate the
financial system and cause a global panic as investors would want to pull out their
funds from all financial institutions, effectively causing a run  in the financial mar-
kets. During the week the Fed began to search for ways to deal with this crisis. One
solution was to try to convince another financial institution to take over Bear Stearns
and keep the financial markets open. The problem, however, was that no one had a
clear idea precisely what quality of assets Bears Stearns had on its balance sheet, and
thus no firm wanted to be exposed to the risk of purchasing them. Finally, the Fed
convinced the investment firm JPMorgan Chase & Co. to buy Bear Stearns
but only
after the Fed agreed to loan Chase $30 billion. The Fed had successfully averted a
major financial crisis but had put U.S. taxpayers at risk by lending such a large amount
to a private investment house.
Unfortunately, Bear Stearns was only an early symptom of a problem that
increased in severity over the coming months. As we discussed in Chapter 12, by
September and October of 2008 the mortgage crisis had effectively spilled over into
the worlds financial markets. Banks and other financial institutions were afraid to lend
to one another because they were not sure whether or not their loans would be repaid.
The worlds financial markets were freezing up, stock markets were in sharp decline,
and there was growing panic.
The panic was brought to a head when the Fed and Treasury decided not to
arrange a bailout for Lehman Brothers, another major financial institution, as they
had done for Bear Stearns. The markets worldwide reacted adversely to this decision.
The Fed and Treasury quickly changed tactics, however, and authorized an $85 billion
loan to the American International Group (AIG) and took an 80 percent ownership
stake in the company. The Fed had thought that the failure of AIG would trigger mas-
sive failures of other institutions whose assets were insured by AIG. As the crisis con-
tinued, the Fed continued to develop new programs, such as purchasing the
short-term debt of corporations
commercial paper
so that it effectively spread its
lender of last resort function beyond financial institutions. It also began a program to
extend loans to money market funds, some of which had come under financial pres-
sure, and it started to make purchases of securities backed by mortgages in order to
keep funds flowing to the housing sector. Finally, it began to pay interest on deposits
held at the Fed, a move designed to induce banks to hold more reserves and increase
the Feds own ability to make critical loans.
Taken together, these were sweeping changes to the Feds role in the financial sys-
tem. The Fed has now abandoned its efforts to support the commercial paper market
and money market funds, but has maintained the other programs. Only time will tell
whether the remaining changes, adopted during a two-month period, will become
permanent tools of the Fed or will fade away when the economy eventually recovers.

We began this chapter by
examining the role money
plays in the economy and how
economists define money. We
then looked at the flow of
money in and out of banks and
saw how banks can create
money with deposits and
loans. Finally, we examined the structure of the Federal Reserve
and the key roles that central banks can play during financial
crises. Here are the main points you should remember from
this chapter:
1 Money consists of anything we regularly use to make
exchanges. In modern economies, money consists primarily
of currency and deposits in checking accounts.
2 Banks are financial intermediaries that earn profits by accept-
ing deposits and making loans. Deposits, which are liabilities
of banks, are included in the money supply.
286
3 Banks are required by law to hold a fraction of their deposits
as reserves, either in cash or in deposits with the Federal
Reserve. Total reserves consist of required reserves plus
excess reserves.
4 If there is an increase in reserves in the banking system, the
supply of money will expand by a multiple of the initial
deposit. This multiple is known as the money multiplier.
5 Decisions about the supply of money are made at the
Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC), which includes
the 7 members on the Board of Governors and the presi-
dent of the New York Federal Reserve Bank, as well as 4 of
the 11 other regional bank presidents, who serve on a rotat-
ing basis.
6 In a financial crisis like those that occurred in 2001 and
2008, the Fed can help stabilize the economy. Current and
recent Fed chairmen have been powerful figures in the
national economy.

1.7
Debit Cards. In recent years, debit cards have
become popular. Debit cards allow the holder of the
card to pay a merchant for goods and services directly
from a checking account. How do you think the intro-
duction of debit cards affected the amount of currency
in the economy? How about the amount of checking
account deposits?

1.8
Gift Cards. Gifts cards have grown in popularity as a
mechanism to give gifts. Cards are available for popu-
lar book stores and for coffee shops. Should these gift
cards be considered part of the money supply? How
do they differ from travelers checks?
1.9
California Money? In 1992, the state of California
ran out of funds and could not pay its bills. It issued
IOUs, called warrants, to its workers and suppliers.
Only large banks and credit unions accepted the war-
rants. Should these warrants be viewed as money?
(Related to Application 1 on page 276.)
1.10 Credit Cards. Why aren t traditional credit cards part
of the money supply?
1.11 Inflation and Currency Held Abroad. Suppose
inflation in the United States rose to around 7 percent
a year. How do you think this would affect the demand
for U.S. currency by foreigners?
1.12 Currency and Underground Economy. Search the
Web for articles on currency and the underground
economy.  How have various authors used estimates
of currency to measure the underground economy?

Bad Loans to South America. During the 1980s,
U.S. banks made loans to South American countries.
Many of these loans turned out to be worthless. How
did this affect the assets, liabilities, and owners  equity
of these banks?
2.6
Banks versus Insurance Companies. Both insur-
ance companies and banks are financial intermedi-
aries. Why do macroeconomists study banks more
intensively than insurance companies?
2.7
Understanding M1 and M2. If you write a check
from your checking account to your money market
account, what happens to M1 and M2?
2.8
Cash Withdrawals and Changes in the Money
Supply. If a customer withdrew $2,000 in cash from a
bank and the reserve ratio was 0.2, by how much could
the supply of money eventually be reduced?
2.9
Money Market Mutual Funds, Banks, and Reserves.
Money market mutual funds typically invest in govern-
ment securities and other financial instruments that can
be easily bought and sold. They are not subject to reserve
13.2
requirements and, in fact, hold minimal reserves. Banks,
on the other hand, make loans to businesses for invest-
ment purposes. If there were no reserve requirements for
banks, how do you think their reserve holdings would
compare to money market mutual funds?
2.10 Setting the Interest Rate on Reserves. What would
be the danger if the Fed set an interest rate on reserves
close to the market interest rate on loans? (Related to
Application 2 on page 280.)

Where Should Regional Banks Be Located
Today? Given the changes in the location of eco-

of the Federal Reserve, how would the location of the
regional banks change if they were allocated by eco-
nomic activity?

Federal Open Market Committee. Given your under-
standing of the conduct of monetary policy, why is
this true?

How Much Oversight? After the financial crisis in
2008, Congress wanted to have more oversight of the
Fed and some suggested that the Government
Accountability Office even audit the decisions of the
Fed. What are the risks of this increased oversight?

Required Reserves during the Great Depression.
During the Great Depression, banks held excess
reserves because they were concerned depositors
might be more inclined to withdraw funds from their
accounts. At one point, the Fed became concerned
that excess reserves were too high and raised the
reserve requirements for banks.
a. Assuming banks were holding excess reserves for
precautionary purposes, do you think they would
continue to want to hold them even after reserve
requirements were raised? Explain.
b. What do you think happened to the money supply
after the Fed raised reserve requirements?
4.5
Crisis in the Short-Term Credit Market. In 1973,
several major companies went bankrupt and were not
going to be able to pay interest on their short-term
loans. This caused a crisis in the market. There was
concern that the short-term credit market would col-
lapse, and that even healthy corporations would not be
able to borrow. How do you think the Fed should have
handled that situation?
4.6
The Federal Reserve Loan to JPMorgan Chase &
Co. When the Federal Reserve makes a loan to a
bank or financial institution, it requires the institution
to specify certain assets the Federal Reserve can take
possession of if the loan is not repaid. These assets are
known as collateral. When the Federal Reserve made
its $30 billion loan to JPMorgan, it allowed
JPMorgan to use some of the assets of Bears Stearns
as collateral. Why was this risky for the Federal
Reserve and a good deal for JPMorgan? (Related to
Application 4 on page 285.)
4.7
Check Clearing and September 11. How did the
Federal Reserve manipulate the check-clearing
process to increase liquidity in response to the poten-
tial financial crisis following the terrorist attacks of
September 11, 2001? (Related to Application 3 on
page 284.)
4.8
Bailouts? Some critics of the Fed s actions with AIG
and Bear Stearns said that the government was just
bailing out failing financial firms that should have
been allowed to fail. It is true that owners of both
firms did benefit from these actions. Nonetheless, can
you defend the Fed? (Related to Application 4 on
page 285.)

ECO NO M I C EX PERI M EN T
Money Creation
This experiment demonstrates the money-creation process.
Students act like bankers and investors. Bankers loan money
to investors, who then buy machines that produce output.
The experiment is divided into several separate days. On
each day, all loans are executed in the morning, all deposits
happen over the lunch hour, and all machines are purchased
in the afternoon. Each bank can receive only one deposit
and issue only one loan. The interest rate paid to depositors
and the interest rate paid by borrowers are negotiable. The
experiment starts when the instructor deposits $625 from
the sale of a government bond into a bank.
Bank Actions
The sequence of possible bank actions on a given day is
as follows:
1. Early morning: Count money. Check for excess
reserves, including deposits from the previous noon.
2. Middle morning: Loan out any excess reserves in a sin-
gle loan to a borrower and negotiate an interest rate for
the loan. The loan is executed by writing a bank check
to the borrower.
3. Noon: Receive a deposit (bank check deposited into a
checking account).
4. Afternoon: Relax, golf.
Rules for Banks
The rules for banks are as follows:
1. For each $1 deposited, you must hold $0.20 in reserve.
2. If you don t issue a loan, you can earn 3 percent by
investing overseas.
Investor Actions
The sequence of possible investor actions on a given day is
as follows:
1. Early morning: Sleep in while bankers count their money.
2. Middle morning: Borrow money from a bank and nego-
tiate an interest rate for the loan.
3. Noon: Deposit the loan at the bank of your choice and
negotiate an interest rate for the deposit.
4. Afternoon: Buy machines from Machine, Inc., paying
with a personal check.

To show how to derive the formula for deposit creation, let s use the example in the
text. We showed that with 10 percent held as reserves, a $1,000 deposit led to total
deposits of
Lets find the total sum of all these deposits. Because each bank successively had to
hold 10 percent in its reserves, each successive bank received only 0.9 of the deposits
of the prior bank. Therefore, we can write the total for the deposits in all the banks as
We need to find the sum of the terms in parentheses. Using a formula for an infi-
nite sum,
the expression becomes
Therefore, the total increase in deposits will be
To derive the general formula, note that if the reserve ratio is r, the bank will lend
out (1  r) per dollar of deposits. Following the steps we just outlined, we find the infi-
nite sum will be

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
Little did Ben S. Bernanke know when he took over
the reins as chairman of the Federal Reserve on
February 1, 2006, that he would face a novel and
complex crisis brought on by the fall in housing prices
and its reverberations throughout the entire financial
system in 2007 and 2008. Unlike his immediate prede-
cessors, Alan Greenspan and Paul Volcker, who had
gained their experience and expertise working on Wall
Street and in banking, Bernanke had primarily an acade-
mic career. As a former chairman of the Economics
Department at Princeton University, he was known for his
scholarly work focused on the Great Depression and the
role of monetary policy in controlling inflation. Although
he had little direct experience in financial markets, he did
have some experience in economic policy and monetary
policy in Washington.
Bernanke used his academic and policy experience to
his advantage in meeting the challenges of the financial cri-
sis. He convened brainstorming sessions with the president
of the New York Federal Reserve Bank and leading
financiers on Wall Street to further develop his own under-
standing of rapidly changing financial structures and the
risks the mortgage crisis posed to them. As a scholar of the
Great Depression, he also understood that the Federal
Reserve had to take bold action to avert major crises. This
background helped him to devise new and daring strategies for the Fed to deal with an unforeseen finan-
cial crisis. After a career in academia, his job as chairman provided Bernanke with a new education
by fire.

I
n this chapter, we will learn why everyone is so interested in what the Federal
Reserve is about to do. In the short run, when prices don t have enough time to
change and we consider them temporarily fixed, the Federal Reserve can influence
interest rate levels in the economy. When the Federal Reserve lowers interest rates,
investment spending and GDP increase because the cost of funds is cheaper.
Conversely, when the Fed increases interest rates, investment spending and GDP
decrease because the cost of funds is higher. It is this power of the Fed to affect inter-
est rates in the short run that will influence firms decisions to invest. Individuals who
want to invest in or purchase homes also want to know what the Fed will do about
interest rates in the near future.
THE MONEY MARKET
The money market is the market for money where the amount supplied and the
amount demanded meet to determine the nominal interest rate. Recall that the nomi-
nal interest rate is the stated or quoted interest rate before adjusting for inflation. We
begin by learning the factors that determine the publics demand for money. Once we
understand what affects the demand for money, we can see how the actions of the
Federal Reserve determine the supply of money. Then we ll see how the demand and
supply of money together determine interest rates.
The Demand for Money
Lets think of money as simply one part of wealth. Suppose your total wealth is valued
at $1,000. In what form will you hold your wealth? Should you put all your wealth into
the stock market? Or perhaps into the bond market? Or should you hold some of your
wealth in money, that is, currency and deposits in checking accounts?
INTEREST RATES AFFECT MONEY DEMAND
If you invest in assets such as
stocks or bonds, you will generally earn income on them. Stocks are shares in the
ownership of a corporation. There are two sources of income from stocks: divi-
dends paid to their owners out of the profits of the corporation, and the typical
increase in their value over time. Bonds are loans that are repaid with interest.
Thus, both stocks and bonds provide returns to investors. If you hold your wealth
in currency or in a checking account, however, you will receive either no interest or
very low interest. And if inflation rises sharply, you might even lose money. Hold-
ing your wealth as money in currency or a checking account means you sacrifice
some potential income.
Money does, however, provide a valuable service. It facilitates transactions. If
you go to a grocery store to purchase cereal, the store will accept currency or a
check, but you won t be able to pay for cereal with your stocks and bonds. People
hold money primarily for this basic reason: Money makes it easier to conduct every-
day transactions. Economists call this reason for holding money the transaction
demand for money.
To understand the demand for money, we rely on the principle of opportunity cost.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  O P P O R T U N I T Y  C O S T
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
The opportunity cost of holding money is the return you could have earned by
holding your wealth in other assets. We measure the opportunity cost of holding
money by the interest rate. Suppose the interest rate available to you on a long-term
bond is 6 percent per year. If you hold $100 of your wealth in the form of this bond,

you ll earn $6 a year. If you hold currency instead, you ll earn no interest. So the
opportunity cost of holding $100 in currency is $6 per year, or 6 percent per year.
As interest rates increase in the economy, the opportunity cost of holding
money also increases. Economists have found that as the opportunity cost of hold-
ing money increases, the public demands less money. The quantity demanded of
money will decrease with an increase in interest rates.
In Figure 14.1, we draw a demand for money curve, Md, as a function of the
interest rate. At higher interest rates, individuals will want to hold less money than
they will at lower interest rates because the opportunity cost of holding money is
higher. As interest rates rise from r0 to r1, the quantity of money demanded falls from
M0 to M1.
THE PRICE LEVEL AND GDP AFFECT MONEY DEMAND
The demand for
money also depends on two other factors. One is the overall price level in the econ-
omy. The demand for money will increase as the level of prices increases. If prices for
your groceries are twice as high, you will need twice as much money to purchase
them. The amount of money people typically hold during any time period will be
closely related to the dollar value of the transactions they make. This is an example of
the real-nominal principle in action.
R E A L - N O M I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
What matters to people is the real value of money or income
its purchas-
ing power
not the face value of money or income.
The other factor that influences the demand for money is the level of real GDP
or real income. It seems obvious that as income increases, individuals and businesses
will make more purchases. Similarly, as real GDP increases, individuals and businesses

OTHER COMPONENTS OF MONEY DEMAND
Traditionally, economists have
identified other motives besides transactions for individuals or firms to hold money. If
you hold your wealth in the form of property, such as a house or a boat, it is costly to
sell it on short notice if you need to obtain funds. These forms of wealth are illiquid,
meaning that they are not easily transferable into money. If you hold your wealth in
currency or checking accounts, you do not have this problem. Economists recognize
that people have a liquidity demand for money; they want to hold money so they can
make transactions on quick notice.
During periods of economic volatility, investors might not want to hold stocks
and bonds because their prices might fall. Instead, they might convert them into hold-
ings that fall into the M2 category, such as savings accounts and money market funds.
These investments earn lower interest rates on average, but are less risky than stocks
and bonds, whose prices can fluctuate. This demand for safer assets is called the
speculative demand for money. For example, after the stock market began to fall in
2000, individuals became very uncertain about the future and shifted their funds from
the stock market to money market mutual funds. This shift of assets from stocks to
money temporarily increased M2. When the market started to recover, some investors
shifted funds back into the stock market.
In summary, individuals hold money for three motives: to facilitate transactions,
to provide liquidity, and to reduce risk. The amount of money they want to hold will
depend on interest rates, the level of real GDP, and the price level.
HOW THE FEDERAL RESERVE CAN CHANGE
THE MONEY SUPPLY
As we discussed in the last chapter, the banking system as a whole can expand the
money supply only if new reserves come into the system. As we saw, when private cit-
izens and firms write checks to one another, there will be no net change in the supply

more money.
Figure 14.2 shows how changes in prices and GDP affect the demand for money.
Panel A shows how the demand for money shifts to the right as the price level
increases. At any interest rate, people will want to hold more money as prices increase.

any interest rate, people will want to hold more money as real GDP increases. These
graphs both show the same result. An increase in prices or an increase in real GDP
will increase money demand.

PART 5
of money. Because the total amount of reserves in the system is unchanged, the money
supply cannot expand. There is one organization, however, that has the power to
change the total amount of reserves in the banking system: the Federal Reserve.
Open Market Operations
The Fed can increase or decrease the total amount of reserves in the banking system
through open market operations, which are the purchase or sale of U.S. government
securities by the Fed. There are two types of open market operations:
In open market purchases, the Fed buys government bonds from the pri-
vate sector.
In open market sales, the Fed sells government bonds to the private sector.
To understand how the Fed can increase the supply of money, lets trace what hap-
pens after an open market purchase. Suppose the Federal Reserve purchases $1 mil-
lion worth of government bonds currently owned by the private sector. The Fed
writes a check for $1 million and presents it to the party who sold the bonds. The
Federal Reserve now owns those bonds. The party who sold the bonds then deposits
the $1 million in its bank.
Here is the key to how the supply of money increases when the Fed purchases
government bonds: As we explained in the last chapter, each bank must keep an
account with the Fed containing both its required and excess reserves. The check
written against the Federal Reserve increases the banks total reserves, essentially giv-
ing it more money to loan out. In this case, the bank s account balance increases by
$1 million. If the reserve requirement is 10 percent, the bank must keep $100,000 in
reserves, but it can now loan out $900,000 from its excess reserves. Basically, when the
Fed buys bonds, the proceeds go out into the economy. Open market purchases of
bonds therefore increase the money supply.
The Federal Reserve has powers that ordinary citizens and even banks do not
have. The Fed can write checks against itself to purchase government bonds without
having any explicit funds  in its account for the purchase. Banks accept these checks
because they count as part of their total reserves.
As you might expect, open market sales will, conversely, decrease the supply of
money. Suppose the Federal Reserve sells $1 million worth of government bonds to a
Wall Street firm. The firm will pay for the bonds with a check for $1 million drawn on
its bank and give this check to the Federal Reserve. The bank must either hand over
$1 million in cash or, more likely, reduce its total reserves with the Federal Reserve
by $1 million. When the Fed sells bonds, it is basically taking the money exchanged
for them out of the hands of the public. Open market sales therefore decrease the
money freely available in the economy.
In summary, if the Federal Reserve wishes to increase the money supply to
stimulate the economy (perhaps it is operating too sluggishly), it buys government
bonds from the private sector in open market purchases. If the Fed wishes to
decrease the money supply to slow the economy down (perhaps it is growing too
quickly and inflation is occurring), it sells government bonds to the private sector
in open market sales.
Other Tools of the Fed
Open market operations are by far the most important way in which the Federal
Reserve changes the supply of money. There are two other ways in which the Fed can
change the supply of money, which we ll discuss next.
CHANGING RESERVE REQUIREMENTS
Another way the Fed can change the
money supply is by changing the reserve requirements for banks. If the Fed wishes to
increase the supply of money, it can reduce banks  reserve requirements so they have

more money to loan out. This would expand the money supply. To decrease the sup-
ply of money, the Federal Reserve can raise reserve requirements.
Changing reserve requirements is a powerful tool, but the Federal Reserve
doesn t use it very often, because it disrupts the banking system. Suppose a bank is
required to hold exactly 10 percent of its deposits as reserves and has loaned the
other 90 percent out. If the Federal Reserve suddenly increases its reserve require-
ment to 20 percent, the bank would be forced to call in or cancel many of its loans.
Its customers would not like this! Today, the Fed doesn t make sharp changes in
reserve requirements. It did in the past, including during the Great Depression,
because it mistakenly believed that the banks were holding too much in excess
reserves. Banks, however, were holding additional reserves because they wanted to
protect themselves from bank runs. As a result, after the increase in required
reserves, banks increased their reserves even more, further reducing the supply of
money to the economy.
CHANGING THE DISCOUNT RATE
Another way the Fed can change the money
supply is by changing the discount rate. The discount rate is the interest rate at
which banks can borrow directly from the Fed. Suppose a major customer asks for
a large loan from a bank that has no excess reserves. Unless the bank can find an
additional source of funds, it will not be able to make the loan. Banks are reluctant
to turn away major customers. They first try to borrow reserves from other banks
through the federal funds market, a market in which banks borrow and lend

BEYOND PURCHASING TREASURY SECURITIES
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How has the Fed recently expanded its role
in financial markets?
Traditionally, to conduct monetary policy and to expand the money supply, the
Fed purchased
either outright or on a temporary basis
Treasury securities.
When it purchased these securities for the public, it credited the reserve accounts
in banks and the amount of these reserves in banks would, in part, determine the
amount of money and credit in the economy. The Fed did not intervene directly in
particular security or credit markets, instead leaving those decisions to be made by
the private market.
After the financial crisis of 2008, the Fed sharply changed its policies. It greatly
expanded its involvement in the economy both in size and scope. The first way to see
this is to note that the Feds total assets increased during 2008 from less than $1 tril-
lion to over $2 trillion. The second way is to note the change in composition of its
assets. Prior to the financial crisis, the Fed primarily held Treasury securities as its
assets. In 2010 the Fed held over $1 trillion in mortgage-backed securities. During the
financial crisis, the Fed designed a wide variety of new programs to channel funds to
particular credit markets.
The Feds support of the mortgage market and other specific credit markets was
designed to make these markets work more smoothly and prevent disruptions during
the crisis. Critics of the Feds policies suggest that through its support of specific mar-
kets, the Fed crossed a political threshold that may pose risks to its long-term inde-
pendence. During 2009 the Fed did wind down its investments in many specific
markets, but increased the size of its mortgage-backed securities. Through these
financial holdings, the Fed is still playing a direct role in the housing market.

reserves to and from one another. If the rate
called the federal funds rate
seems too high to the bank, it could borrow directly from the Federal Reserve at
the discount rate. By changing the discount rate, the Federal Reserve can influ-
ence the amount of borrowing by banks. If the Fed raises the discount rate, banks
will be discouraged from borrowing reserves because it has become more costly.
Lowering the discount rate will induce banks to borrow additional reserves.
Recently, the Fed has developed new methods to allow banks and other institu-
tions to borrow from it.
HOW INTEREST RATES ARE DETERMINED:
COMBINING THE DEMAND AND SUPPLY
OF MONEY
Combining the demand for money, determined by the public, with the supply of
money, determined by the Fed, we can see how interest rates are determined in the
short run in a demand-and-supply model of the money market.
Figure 14.3 depicts a model of the money market. The supply of money is
determined by the Federal Reserve, and we assume for simplicity that it is indepen-
dent of interest rates. We represent this independence by a vertical supply curve for
money, Ms. In the same graph, we draw the demand for money Md. Market equilib-
rium occurs where the demand for money equals the supply of money, at an interest
rate of r*.

Equilibrium in the Money Market
Equilibrium in the money market occurs at an interest rate of r*, at which the quantity of money
demanded equals the quantity of money supplied.
At this equilibrium interest rate r*, the quantity of money demanded by the private
sector equals the quantity of money supplied by the Federal Reserve. What happens if
the interest rate is higher than r*? At a higher interest rate, the quantity of money
demanded will be less than the fixed quantity supplied, so there will be an excess supply
of money. In other markets, excess supplies cause the price to fall. The same result hap-
pens here. The price of money  in the market for money is the interest rate. If the

Federal Reserve and Interest Rates
Changes in the supply of money will change interest rates.
We can also think of the process from the perspective of banks. Recall our discus-
sion of money creation through the banking system. After the Feds open market pur-
chase of bonds, some of the money the Fed paid for the bonds gets deposited into
banks. Banks will want to make loans to consumers and businesses with that money,
because holding it in their reserves with the Fed earns them no interest. To entice
people to borrow, banks will lower the interest rates they charge on their loans. After
an open-market purchase of bonds by the Fed, interest rates will fall throughout the
entire economy.
Now we understand why businesspeople and politicians all want to know what
the Federal Reserve is likely to do in the near future. The Fed exerts direct control
over interest rates in the short run. If the Fed decides interest rates should be lower,
it buys bonds in the open market to increase the supply of money. If the Fed wants
higher interest rates, it sells bonds in the open market to decrease the money supply.
Interest Rates and Bond Prices
Sometimes you see in the financial section of the newspaper a statement like,
Today, interest rates rose as bond prices fell.  You may wonder whether these two
actions are connected. Indeed they are. When the Fed raises interest rates, bond
prices fall.
interest rate were below r*, the demand for money would exceed the fixed supply:
There would be an excess demand for money. As in other markets when there are
excess demands, the price rises. Here, the price of money or the interest rate would rise
until it reached r*. As you can see, money-market equilibrium follows the same logic as
any other economic equilibrium.
We can use this simple model of the money market to understand the power of
the Federal Reserve. Suppose the Federal Reserve increases the money supply
through an open market purchase of bonds. In Panel A of Figure 14.4, an increase in
the supply of money shifts the money supply curve to the right, leading to lower inter-
est rates. A decrease in the money supply through the Fed s open market sale of bonds,
as depicted in Panel B of Figure 14.4, decreases the supply of money, shifting the
money supply curve to the left and increasing interest rates.

299
PART 5
To see why, recall that bonds represent a promise to pay money in the future. If
you own a bond, you are entitled to receive payments on it at a later time. But why do
the prices of bonds move in the opposite direction of interest rates?
Because a bond payment occurs in the future, we need to use the concept of pre-
sent value from Chapter 12 to determine the value of this payment today. The price of
a bond is simply the present value of its future payments. Consider a bond that makes
a payment one period in the future. The price of the bond
the present value of the
payment
is equal to
That is, the price of a bond is the payment promised, divided by one plus the inter-
est rate.
Suppose the promised payment next year is $106 and the interest rate is 6 percent
per year. The price of the bond will be
In this case, the bond would cost $100 if it were issued today. But what hap-
pens if interest rates in the economy change later? What if rates rise higher than
6 percent or fall lower than 6 percent? What will the bond you are holding be
worth then, if you decided, for example, you needed the money and had to sell it
to someone else? This is an important question because most of the bonds for sale
on the market are not newly issued bonds
they are bonds that have already been
issued with specific promised payments that people are buying and selling from
one another.
Lets consider two examples:
Suppose the promised payment is still $106, but the interest rate falls from 6 to
4 percent per year. Using the formula, the price of the bond will rise to
$106/1.04, or $101.92
$1.92 more than it was with an interest rate of 6 per-
cent. The price of the bond rose because, at the lower interest rate of 4 percent,
a buyer will need more money
$101.92 versus $100
to get the same $106 the
bond will pay next year. In other words, at a lower interest rate the value today
of a future payment (its present value) is higher.
Now suppose interest rates rise from 6 to 8 percent per year. In this case, the
price you could sell your bond for will fall to $106/1.08, or $98.15. The rea-
son the price falls is that a buyer would need only $98.15 to get the $106
next year. As interest rates rose, the price of the bond fell. In other words, at
a higher interest rate, the value today of a future payment (its present value)
is lower.
In financial markets, many types of complex bonds pay different sums of
money at different times in the future. However, all bonds, no matter how com-
plex or simple, promise to pay some money in the future. The same logic that
applies to simple one-period bonds, like the one just described, applies to more
complex bonds. As interest rates rise, investors need less money to meet the
promised payments in the future, so the price of all these bonds falls. As interest
rates fall, investors need more money to meet the promised payments. Therefore,
as the Fed changes interest rates, bond prices will move in the opposite direction
of interest rates.
price of bond = $106
1.06 = $100
price of bond =
promised payment
(1 + interest rate)

CHAPTER 14
THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND MONETARY POLICY

HOW OPEN MARKET OPERATIONS DIRECTLY AFFECT BOND PRICES
There
is another way to understand why when bond prices change in one direction, inter-
est rates will change in opposite directions. We know that when the Federal
Reserve buys bonds in the open market, interest rates fall. But think about what the
Federal Reserve is doing when it conducts the open market purchase. The Federal
Reserve is buying bonds from the public. As the Fed buys bonds, it increases the
demand for bonds and raises their price. This is another reason bond prices rise as
interest rates fall.
Similarly, interest rates rise following an open market sale of bonds by the Fed.
When the Fed conducts an open market sale, it is selling bonds, increasing the supply
of bonds in the market. With an increase in the supply of bonds, the price of bonds
will fall.
Because the Federal Reserve can change interest rates with open-market pur-
chases and sales and thereby affect the price of bonds, you can now see why Wall
Street firms typically hire Fed watchers (often former officials of the Federal Reserve)
to try to predict what the Fed will do. If a Wall Street firm correctly predicts the Fed
will surprise the market and lower interest rates, the firm could buy millions of dollars
of bonds for itself or its clients prior to the Feds announcement and make vast profits
as the prices of the bonds inevitably rise.
GOOD NEWS FOR THE ECONOMY IS BAD NEWS FOR BOND PRICES
You
may have heard on television or read in the newspaper that prices in the bond mar-
ket often fall in the face of good economic news, such as an increase in real output.
Are the markets perverse? Why is good news for the economy bad news for the
bond market?
We can understand the behavior of the bond market by thinking about the
demand for money. When real GDP increases, the demand for money will increase.
A P P L I C AT I O N 2
RISING INTEREST RATES DURING AN ECONOMIC RECOVERY
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: What happens to interest rates when the
economy recovers from a recession?
Economists have often noticed that as an economy recovers from a recession, interest
rates start to rise. And, in general, interest rates tend to rise as the economy grows
quickly. An example occurred during 2005, when interest rates on three-month
Treasury bills rose from 2.3 percent at the beginning of the year to 3.9 percent at the
end of the year, as real GDP grew very rapidly.
Some observers think this is puzzling because they associate higher interest rates
with lower output. Why should a recovery be associated with higher interest rates?
The simple model of the money market helps explain why interest rates can rise
during an economic recovery. One key to understanding this phenomenon is that the
extra income being generated by firms and individuals during the recovery will
increase the demand for money. Because the demand for money increases while the
supply of money remains fixed, interest rates rise.
Another factor is that the Federal Reserve itself may want to raise interest rates as
the economy grows rapidly to avoid overheating the economy. In this case, the Fed
cuts back on the supply of money to raise interest rates. In both cases, however, the
public should expect rising interest rates during a period of economic recovery and
rapid GDP growth.

The Money Market and Investment Spending
The equilibrium interest rate r* is determined in the money market. At that interest rate, investment
spending is given by I*.
We should note that consumption as well as investment can depend on interest
rates. That is, spending on consumer durables, such as automobiles and refrigerators,
will also depend negatively on the rate of interest. Consumer durables are really
investment goods for the household: If you buy an automobile, you incur the cost
today and receive benefits, such as the ability to use the car, in the future. As interest
rates rise, the opportunity costs of investing in an automobile will rise. Consumers will
respond to the increase in opportunity cost by purchasing fewer cars. In this chapter,
we discuss how changes in interest rates affect investment, but keep in mind that the
purchases of consumer durables are affected too.
As the demand for money increases, the money demand curve will shift to the right.
From our model of the money market, we know that increased money demand will
increase interest rates. Bond prices move in the opposite direction from interest rates.
Therefore, good news for the economy is bad for the bond market.
INTEREST RATES AND HOW THEY CHANGE
INVESTMENT AND OUTPUT (GDP)
Higher or lower interest rates are just a means to an end, though, for the Fed. The
Feds ultimate goal is to change output
either to slow or speed the economy by influ-
encing aggregate demand.
To show how the Fed affects the interest rate, which in turn affects investment
(a component of GDP), and finally GDP itself, we combine our demand and sup-
ply for money with the curve that shows how investment spending is related to
interest rates. This appears in Figure 14.5. Panel A in Figure 14.5 shows how inter-
est rates are determined by the demand and supply for money. It is identical to
Figure 14.3 on page 297, which we studied earlier. The graph shows us the equilib-
rium interest rate for money. Now let s move to Panel B in Figure 14.5. We can see
that at the equilibrium interest rate r* the level of investment in the economy will
be given by I*.

as a whole will increase in the short run. Thus, by reducing interest rates, the Fed
affects output and prices in the economy.

Monetary Policy and International Trade
We have been discussing monetary policy without taking into account international
trade or international movements of financial funds across countries. Once we bring
in these considerations, we will see that monetary policy operates through an addi-
tional route.
Suppose the Federal Reserve lowers U.S. interest rates through an open mar-
ket purchase of bonds. As a result, investors in the United States will be earning
lower interest rates and will seek to invest some of their funds abroad. To invest
abroad, they will need to sell their U.S. dollars and buy the foreign currency of the
country where they intend to invest. This will affect the exchange rate
the rate
at which one currency trades for another currency in the market. As more investors
sell their dollars to buy foreign currency, the exchange rate will fall. A fall in the
exchange rate or a decrease in the value of a currency is called depreciation of a
currency. Lower U.S. interest rates brought on by the Fed will cause the dollar to
depreciate. This will ultimately change the demand and supply of goods and ser-
vices around the globe because it will make U.S. goods cheaper than foreign goods.
Let s see why.
In this case, the lower value of the dollar will mean that U.S. goods become rela-
tively cheaper on world markets. Suppose the exchange rate is two Swiss francs to the
dollar, meaning you will receive two Swiss francs for every dollar you exchange. If a
U.S. machine sells for $100,000, it will cost 200,000 Swiss francs. Now suppose the
value of the dollar depreciates so that one dollar now buys only one Swiss franc. The
same U.S. machine will now cost Swiss residents half of what they used to pay for it
just 100,000 francs instead of 200,000. In other words, the lower value of the dollar
makes U.S. goods cheaper for foreigners. As a result, foreign residents will want to
buy more U.S. goods, and U.S. companies will want to export more goods to meet the
higher foreign demand.
Thats the good news about the lower value of the U.S. dollar. The bad news is that
the lower value of the dollar will make it more expensive for U.S. residents to buy for-
eign goods. If the exchange rate were still two Swiss francs to the dollar as it originally
was at the outset of our example, Swiss chemicals with a price tag of 60,000 francs
would cost a U.S. resident $30,000. If the exchange rate of the dollar depreciates to one
franc per dollar, however, the same chemicals will cost twice as much
$60,000. As the
dollar depreciates, imports become more expensive, and U.S. residents tend to import
fewer of them.

The Fed can also use its influence to increase interest rates, which will have the exact
opposite effect. Investment spending will fall, along with aggregate demand. The
aggregate demand curve will shift to the left, and the price level and output in the
economy will fall, too. We can again represent this entire sequence of events:

CHAPTER 14
THE FEDERAL RESERVE AND MONETARY POLICY
304
Lets recap this: As the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar falls, U.S. goods become
cheaper and foreign goods become more expensive. The United States then exports
more goods and imports fewer goods. Net exports increase, in other words. This
increase in net exports increases the demand for U.S. goods and increases GDP.
Remember that this all began with an open market purchase of bonds by the Fed that
increased the money supply. Here is the sequence of events:
To summarize, an increase in interest rates will reduce both investment spending
(including consumer durables) and net exports. A decrease in interest rates will
increase investment spending and net exports. As you can see, monetary policy in an
open economy is even more powerful than monetary policy used in a closed economy.
The Fed and other central banks are well aware of the power they have to
influence exchange rates and international trade. Countries that depend extensively
on international trade
such as Canada and Switzerland
find that the effects of
monetary policy on exchange rates are critical to their economic well-being. We ll
study these issues in more depth in Chapter 19.
MONETARY POLICY CHALLENGES FOR THE FED
Now that we have seen how changes in the money supply affect aggregate demand, we
can see that the government has two different types of tools to change the level of
GDP in the short run: The government can use either fiscal policy
changes in the
level of taxes or government spending
or monetary policy
changes in the supply of
money and interest rates
to alter the level of GDP.
If the current level of GDP is below full employment or potential output, the
government can use expansionary policies such as tax cuts, increased spending, or

The three new links in the sequence are from interest rates to exchange rates,
from exchange rates to net exports, and from net exports to GDP.
This sequence also works in reverse. If the Fed conducts an open market sale of
bonds, U.S. interest rates rise. As a result, foreign investors earning lower interest
rates elsewhere will want to move their money to the United States where they can
earn a higher return. As they buy more U.S. dollars, the exchange rate for the dol-
lar will increase, and the dollar will increase in value. An increase in the value of a
currency is called appreciation of a currency. The appreciation of the dollar will
make U.S. goods more expensive for foreigners and imports cheaper for U.S. resi-
dents. Suppose the U.S. dollar appreciates, and each dollar can now be exchanged
for three Swiss francs instead of two. The same machine the Swiss had to pay
200,000 francs for when the exchange rate was one dollar to two francs now costs
300,000 francs. The Swiss chemicals U.S. residents bought for $30,000 will now
cost them less
just $20,000.
When U.S. interest rates rise as a result of an open market sale by the Fed, we
expect exports to decrease and imports to increase, decreasing net exports. The
decrease in net exports will reduce the demand for U.S. goods and lead to a fall in out-
put. Here is the sequence of events:

increases in the money supply to raise the level of GDP and reduce unemployment. If
the current level of GDP exceeds full employment or potential output, the economy
will overheat, and the rate of inflation will increase. To avoid this overheating, the
government can use contractionary policies to reduce the level of GDP back to full
employment or potential output.
In Chapter 10, we explored some of the limitations of stabilization policy. We saw
that fiscal policy is subject to lags and fraught with complications because political
parties have different ideas about what the government should or should not do, and it
takes them time to reach agreement. Monetary policy also has its complications.
Lags in Monetary Policy
Recall that there are two types of lags in policy. Inside lags are the time it takes for pol-
icymakers to recognize and implement policy changes. Outside lags are the time it
takes for policy to actually work.
The inside lags for monetary policy are relatively short compared to those for fis-
cal policy. The FOMC meets eight times a year and can decide on major policy
A P P L I C AT I O N 3
THE EFFECTIVENESS OF COMMITTEES
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Is it better for decisions about monetary
policy to be made by a single individual or by a committee?
When Professor Alan Blinder returned to teaching after serving as vice-chairman of
the Federal Reserve from 1994 to 1996, he was convinced that committees were not
effective for making decisions about monetary policy. With another researcher,
Blinder developed an experiment to determine whether individuals or groups make
better decisions.
The experiment Blinder and his colleague developed was designed to explore how
quickly individuals and groups could distinguish between changes in underlying
trends and random events. For example, if unemployment were to rise in one month,
it could be a temporary aberration or it could be the beginning of a recession.
Changing monetary policy would be a mistake if the rise were temporary, but waiting
too long to change policy would be costly if the change were permanent. Who is bet-
ter at making these sorts of determinations?
The results of the experiment showed that committees make decisions as quickly
as, and more accurately than, individuals making decisions by themselves. Moreover,
it was not the performance of the individual committee members that contributed to
the superiority of committee decisions
the actual process of having meetings and dis-
cussions appears to have improved the group s overall performance.
In later research, Blinder also found that it did not really matter whether the com-
mittee had a strong leader. His findings suggest it is the wisdom of the group, not its
leader, that really matters. Also, to the extent the leader has too much power
and the
committee functions more like an individual than a group
monetary policy will actu-
ally be worse!

changes at any time and very quickly. It can even give the chairperson of the Board of
Governors some discretion to make changes between meetings.
Of course, it does take time for the people working at the Fed to recognize that
problems are beginning to occur in the economy. A good example is the 1990 recession.
In 1990, Iraq invaded Kuwait. After the invasion, there was some concern that higher oil
prices and the uncertainty of the political situation in Kuwait would trigger a recession
in the United States, which, of course, is heavily dependent on oil. However, Alan
Greenspan, then chairman of the Federal Reserve, testified before Congress as late as
October 1990 that the economy had not yet slipped into a recession. Not until
December did Greenspan declare that the economy had entered into a recession. Yet,
looking back, we now know the recession had actually started five months earlier, in July.
The outside lags related to monetary policy, however, are quite long. Most econo-
metric models predict it will take at least two years for most of the effects of an inter-
est rate cut to be felt. This delay means that for the Fed to conduct successful
monetary policy, it must be able to accurately forecast two years in the future!
However, the Fed has difficulty predicting when recessions are about to occur. As an
example, in May 2000 the Fed
fearing a rise in inflation
raised the federal funds
rate from 6.00 to 6.50 percent. Yet, on January 3, 2001, the Fed reversed itself and
restored the rate to 6.00 percent, because it feared a recession. It was too little
and
too late
to prevent the 2001 recession.
Because of the lags for monetary policy and the difficulties of forecasting the
economy, many economists believe the Fed should not take a very active role in trying
to stabilize the economy. Instead, they recommend the Fed concentrate on keeping
the inflation rate low and stable.
Decisions about monetary policy are made by a committee. How does this affect
the effectiveness of monetary policy?
Influencing Market Expectations: From the Federal Funds Rate to
Interest Rates on Long-Term Bonds
It is important to recognize that the Fed directly controls only very short-term inter-
est rates in the economy, not long-term interest rates. In fact, when the Fed makes its
decisions on monetary policy, it really decides what the rate should be in the federal
funds market
the market in which banks trade reserves overnight. Once the Fed
decides what rate it wants in the market, it conducts open-market operations
buying
and selling short-term government bonds
to achieve this rate. Thus, when the
Federal Reserve decides the course of monetary policy, it is really just setting a very
short-term interest rate for the economy.
However, when a firm is deciding on a long-term investment or a household is
deciding whether to purchase a new home, it will base its decisions on the interest rate
at which it can borrow money, and this will typically be a long-term interest rate
not
a short-term rate. For example, a household might take out a 30-year mortgage to
purchase a home. If the rate is too high, it might not take out the loan. So for the Fed
to control investment spending it must also somehow influence long-term rates. It can
do this indirectly by influencing short-term rates. Heres how.
Long-term interest rates can be thought of as averages of current and expected
future short-term interest rates. To see why future short-term interest rates are
important, consider putting $100 of your money in the bank for two years. If the
interest rate is 5 percent for the first year, you would have $105 at the end of that year.
If the interest rate for the following year were 10 percent, you would then have
$115.50 ($105 * 1.10) at the end of the second year. Both the current short-term
interest rate (5 percent) and next year s short-term interest rate (10 percent) would
determine the value of your bank account. Similarly, both the current short-term
interest rate and future short-term rates determine the present value of payments in

This chapter showed how
monetary policy affects aggre-
gate demand and the econ-
omy in the short run. Together,
the demand for money by the
public and the supply of
money determined by the
Federal Reserve determine interest rates. Changes in interest
rates will in turn affect investment and output. In the interna-
tional economy, interest rates also affect exchange rates and
net exports. Still, there are limits to what effective monetary
policies can do. Here are the main points of the chapter:
1 The demand for money depends negatively on the interest
rate and positively on the level of prices and real GDP.
2 The Fed can determine the supply of money through open
market purchases and sales, changing reserve requirements,
changing the discount rate, or increasing lending to banks
and other institutions. Open market operations are the pri-
mary tool the Fed uses to implement monetary policy.

the future on a bond or loan. Long-term interest rates are an average of the current
short-term interest rate and expected future short-term rates.
The Fed can directly control the federal funds rate and other short-term
interest rates. Its actions also provide information to the market about the likely
course for future short-term rates. If the Fed wishes to stimulate long-term invest-
ment by cutting the short-term interest rate, it must also convince the public that
it will keep future short-term rates low as well in order to reduce long-term inter-
est rates. Influencing expectations of the financial markets is an important part of
the Fed s job.
The Fed does try to communicate its general intentions for future policy
actions to the public to help make those policies more effective. However, the
public ultimately must form its own expectations of what the Fed is going to do.
Coping with financial market expectations complicates the Fed s task in develop-
ing monetary policy. The Fed itself has debated how best to communicate with the
financial markets.
To further complicate matters, the Fed can also monitor the public s expectations
of its future policies in the financial markets. There are now futures  markets for the
federal funds rates in which market participants essentially place bets on future federal
funds rates. Thus, before the Fed takes any actions on interest rates or even makes any
statements about its future intentions, it can see what the market is thinking. The Fed
has to decide whether to take actions consistent with market expectations of Fed
actions or to surprise the market in some way.
To cope with this trend, the Fed has gradually become more open in its delibera-
tions. For many years, the Fed would not even say whether it had changed interest
rates. These policies began to change slowly in the 1990s. Starting in 2000, after each
FOMC meeting the Fed has announced its target for the federal funds rate and made
a brief statement explaining its actions.
Looking Ahead: From the Short Run to the Long Run
The model for monetary policy we developed in this chapter can help you understand
the behavior of the economy only in the short run, when prices do not change very
much. Monetary policy can affect output in the short run when prices are largely
fixed, but in the long run changes in the money supply affect only the price level and
inflation. In the long run, the Federal Reserve can only indirectly control nominal
interest rates, and it can t control real interest rates
the rate after inflation is figured
in. In the next part of the book, we will explain how output and prices change over
time, and how the economy makes the transition by itself from the short to the long
run regardless of what the Fed does.

1.2
Money demand will 
(increase/decrease)
as prices fall.
1.3
The principle of 
suggests that the
demand for money should increase as prices increase.
1.4
The 
demand for money arises
because individuals and businesses use money in ordi-
nary business.
1.5
Checking Account Interest Rates. During the
1980s, banks started to pay interest (at low rates) on
checking accounts for the first time. Given what you
know about opportunity costs, how would interest
paid on checking affect the demand for money?
1.6
Pegging Interest Rates. Suppose the Federal
Reserve wanted to fix, or peg,  the level of interest
rates at 6 percent per year. Using a simple demand-
and-supply graph, show how increases in money
demand would change the supply of money if the
Federal Reserve pursued the policy of this fixed inter-
est rate. Use your answer to explain this statement: If
the Federal Reserve pegs interest rates, it loses control
of the money supply.

An ATM Next to Your Apartment Building.
Suppose an ATM connected to your own bank is
installed right next to your apartment building.

a. How will this affect the average amount of currency
you carry around with you?
b. If you withdraw funds at your ATM only from your
checking account, will your action have any effect
on total money demand?

Flea Markets and the Demand for Money. People
often like to visit flea markets to look for unexpected
opportunities. Flea markets also typically use cash.
Explain why this is an example of the liquidity demand

3 The level of interest rates is determined in the money market
by the demand for money and the supply of money.
4 To increase the level of GDP, the Federal Reserve buys bonds
on the open market. To decrease the level of GDP, the
Federal Reserve sells bonds on the open market.
5 An increase in the money supply will decrease interest rates,
increase investment spending, and increase output. A
decrease in the money supply will increase interest rates,
decrease investment spending, and decrease output.
6 In an open economy, a decrease in interest rates will depreci-
ate the local currency and lead to an increase in net exports.
Conversely, an increase in interest rates will appreciate the
local currency and lead to a decrease in net exports.

the money supply from expanding too rapidly. Explain
carefully how these two actions, taken together, could
keep the supply of money in China from increasing.

Other Channels of Monetary Policy. Consider this
quote: 
Monetary policy does not work simply
through lowering interest rates. Sometimes it can
directly affect particular credit markets in the econ-
omy.  Can you give an example of actions that the Fed
has taken that fit this quotation? (Related to
Application 1 on page 296.)
How Interest Rates Are Determined:
Combining the Demand and Supply of Money
3.1
Interest rates typically fall in a recession because the
demand for money depends 
on changes
in real income.
3.2
If interest rates are 9 percent per year, the price of a
bond that promises to pay $109 next year will be equal
to 
.
3.3
Through its effect on money demand, an increase in
prices will 
interest rates.
3.4
Open market purchases lead to rising bond prices and
interest rates.
3.5
Pricing a Bond. If a bond promises to pay $110 next
year and the interest rate is 5 percent per year:
a. What will the price of the bond be?
b. What will the new price of the bond be if the
interest rate falls to 3 percent?
3.6
Buy or Sell Bonds? If you strongly believed the
Federal Reserve was going to surprise the markets and
raise interest rates, would you want to buy bonds or
sell bonds?
3.7
Recessions and Interest Rates. The economy starts to
head into a recession. Using a graph of the money mar-
ket, show what happens to interest rates. What happens
to bond prices? (Related to Application 2 on page 300.)
3.8
A Decrease in the Riskiness of the Stock Market.
If investors began to think the stock market is becom-
ing less risky, how will this belief affect the demand
for money? Would this more likely affect M1 or M2?
3.9
Rising Prices and the Money Market. Draw a graph
of the money market to show the effects of an increase
in prices on interest rates.
Interest Rates and How They Change
Investment and Output (GDP)
4.1
When the Federal Reserve sells bonds on the open
market, it leads to 
(higher/lower) levels
of investment and output in the economy.
14.4
14.3
4.2
To decrease the level of output, the Fed should
conduct an open market 
(sale/purchase)
of bonds.
4.3
An open market purchase

money, which 
interest rates, which
investment, and finally results in a(n)
in output.
4.4
An increase in the supply of money will 
(appreciate/depreciate) a countrys currency.
4.5
Interest Rates, Durable Goods, and Nondurable
Goods. Refrigerators and clothing are to some extent
durable. Explain why the decision to purchase a refrig-
erator is likely to be more sensitive to interest rates
than the decision to buy clothing.
4.6
Where Is Monetary Policy Stronger? In an open
economy, changes in monetary policy affect both
interest rates and exchange rates. Comparing the
United States and Switzerland, in which country
would monetary policy have a more significant effect
on GDP through changes in exchange rates?
4.7
Side Effects of Supporting a Currency. Suppose
a countrys currency came under attack by speculators,
and to prevent the value of its currency from falling,
the central bank needed to raise interest rates. What
would be the side effect of such a policy?
Monetary Policy Challenges for the Fed
5.1
(Inside/Outside) lags are longer for
the Fed.
5.2
Experimental evidence shows us that individuals per-
form 
than committees in making mone-
tary policy decisions.
5.3
Long-term interest rates can be thought of as
of short-term rates.
5.4
The Fed directly controls long-term interest rates.
(True/False)
5.5
Open Economies and Outside Lags in Monetary
Policy. Research suggests that the effects of monetary
policy through interest rates, exchange rates, and net
exports are more rapid than the effects of monetary
policy on investment. As an economy becomes more
open, how will this change affect the outside lag in
monetary policy?
5.6
Asset Prices as a Guide to Monetary Policy? Some
central bankers have looked at asset prices, such as
prices of stocks, to guide monetary policy. The idea is
that if stock prices begin to rise, it might signal future
inflation or an overheated economy. Are there any
dangers to using the stock market as a guide to mone-
tary policy?

Rates on Two-Year Bonds and One-Year Bonds.
Suppose the interest rate on a two-year bond was
higher than the interest rate on a one-year bond.
What does the market believe will happen next year to
one-year interest rates?
5.8
International Influences on Fed Policy. As interna-
tional trade becomes more important, monetary pol-
icy becomes more heavily influenced by developments
in the foreign exchange markets. Go to the Web page
of the Federal Reserve (www.federalreserve.gov) and
read some recent speeches given by Fed officials. Do
international considerations seem to affect policymak-
ers in the United States today?
5.9
Are Federal Reserve Chairmen Too Powerful?
Economic research has shown that the chairman of
the Federal Reserve is more powerful, relative to
other committee members, than the head of the cen-
tral bank in other countries. Fed chairpersons have
much more influence over actual decisions than other
members. Recall Professor Blinder s findings that
committees make better decisions than individuals
and that leaders of groups, per se, do not matter for
the quality of decision making. Make an argument
that the tradition of a strong chairman in the United
States reduces the effectiveness of monetary policy.
(Related to Application 3 on page 305.)
5.10 Should the Fed Adopt a Fixed Formula for
Monetary Policy? Some economists suggest that
the Fed should follow an explicit rule or formula for
monetary policy. For example, the rule would specify
how interest rates would change based on changes in
real GDP and inflation. Only with a fixed rule, these
economists argue, would the public really under-
stand the Fed s future intentions for policy. What are
some of the disadvantages of adopting an explicit
rule or formula?

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
Just prior to the start of the December 2007 recession,
unemployment stood at 4.7 percent. It rose to over
10 percent in 2009. In 2010 both the Federal Reserve Board
and the Congressional Budget Office projected that unem-
ployment would still remain above 7 percent in 2012. Thus,
looking ahead to five years after the recession started,
unemployment was still forecast to be stubbornly high.
This path for prolonged unemployment raises a number
of questions. What forces bring the economy back to full
employment? How fast do these forces work by them-
selves? What policies, if any, can speed this process along?
These questions are not new. They were tackled by
John Maynard Keynes in the 1930s and, in modern times,
by leading economists like Milton Friedman and Paul
Samuelson. Some economists advocate aggressive gov-
ernment action, but others feel that such actions may
impede the recovery. The debate continues today.

CHAPTER 15
MODERN MACROECONOMICS: FROM THE SHORT RUN TO THE LONG RUN
312
O
ne of the great debates surrounding macroeconomic policymaking centers on
the short run versus the long run. Up to this point in the book, we have dis-
cussed the short and long run separately. Now, however, we ll explain how the
economy evolves from the short run to the long run. The relationship between the two
is one of the most important dimensions of modern macroeconomics, which carefully
distinguishes between them.
LINKING THE SHORT RUN AND THE LONG RUN
To begin to understand how the short run and the long run are related, lets return to
what we mean by each in macroeconomics.
The Difference between the Short and Long Run
In Chapter 9, we explained how in the short run, wages and prices are sticky and do
not change immediately in response to changes in demand. The short run in
macroeconomics is the period of time over which prices do not change or do not
change very much. Over time, though, wages and prices adjust, and the economy
reaches its long-run equilibrium. Short-run analysis applies to the period when wages
and prices do not change
at least not substantially. Long-run, full-employment eco-
nomics applies after wages and prices have largely adjusted to changes in demand.
The long run in macroeconomics is the period of time in which prices have fully
adjusted to any economic changes.
In the short run, GDP is determined by the current demand for goods and ser-
vices in the economy, so fiscal policy
such as tax cuts or increased government
spending
and monetary policy
such as adjusting the money supply
can affect
demand and GDP. However, in the long run, GDP is determined by the supply of
labor, the stock of capital, and technological progress
in other words, the willingness
of people to work and the overall resources the economy has to work with. Full
employment is another characteristic of the long run. Because the economy is operat-
ing at full employment in the long run, output can t be increased in response to
changes in demand. So, for example, an increase in government spending won t
increase GDP in the long run because spending on one good or service has to come at
the expense of another good or service. Similarly, increasing the supply of money
won t increase GDP in the long run either. It will only cause the price level in the
economy to rise.
Should economic policy be guided by what we expect to happen in the short run
or what we expect to happen in the long run? To answer this question, we need to
know two things:
1 How does what happens in the short run determine what happens in the long run?
2 How long is the short run?
Wages and Prices and Their Adjustment over Time
Wages and prices change every day. If the demand for scooters rises at the same time
that demand for tennis rackets falls, we would expect to see a rise in the price of scoot-
ers and a fall in the price of tennis rackets. Wages in the scooter industry would tend
to increase, and wages in the tennis racket industry would tend to fall.
Sometimes, we see wages and prices in all industries rising or falling together.
For example, prices for steel, automobiles, food, and fuel may all rise together.
Why? Wages and prices will all tend to increase together during booms when GDP
exceeds its full-employment level or potential output. Wages and prices will fall
together during periods of recessions when GDP falls below full employment or
potential output.

change or do not change very much.

rate . . .

output is below potential.
wages and prices fall.
If the economy is producing at a level above full employment, firms will find it
increasingly difficult to hire and retain workers, and unemployment will be below its
natural rate. Workers will find it easy to get and change jobs. To attract workers and
prevent them from leaving, firms will raise their wages. As one firm raises its wage,
other firms will have to raise their wages even higher to attract the workers that remain.
Wages are the largest cost of production for most firms. Consequently, as labor
costs increase, firms have no choice but to increase the prices of their products.
However, as prices rise, workers need higher nominal wages to maintain their real
wages. This is an illustration of the real-nominal principle.
R E A L - N O M I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
What matters to people is the real value of money or income
its
purchasing power
not the face value of money or income.
This process by which rising wages cause higher prices and higher prices feed
higher wages is known as a wage price spiral. It occurs when the economy is produc-
ing at a level of output that exceeds its potential.
When the economy is producing below full employment or potential output, the
process works in reverse. Unemployment will exceed the natural rate. Firms will find
it easy to hire and retain workers, and they can offer workers less. As all firms cut
wages, the average level of wages in the economy falls. As we have said, wages are the
largest component of firms  costs. So, when wages fall, prices start to fall, too. In this
case, the wage price spiral works in reverse.
Table 15.1 summarizes our discussion of unemployment, output, and changes in
wages. Lets emphasize one point: In addition to the changes in wages and prices that
occur when the economy is producing at more or less than full employment, there is
also typically ongoing inflation in the economy. For example, suppose an economy
that has been operating at full employment has been experiencing 4 percent annual
inflation. If output later exceeds full employment, prices will begin to rise at a rate
faster than 4 percent. Conversely, if output falls to a level less than full employment,
prices will then rise at a slower rate than 4 percent.
wage price spiral
The process by which changes in wages
and prices cause further changes in wages
and prices.
In summary, when output exceeds potential output, wages and prices throughout
the economy will rise above previous inflation rates. If output is less than potential
output, wages and prices will fall relative to previous inflation rates. (We will explore
ongoing inflation more in Chapter 16.)
HOW WAGE AND PRICE CHANGES MOVE
THE ECONOMY NATURALLY BACK TO FULL
EMPLOYMENT
The transition between the short run and the long run is easy to understand. If
GDP is higher than potential output, the economy starts to overheat and wages and
prices increase. This increase in wages and prices will then push the economy back
to full employment.
15.2

CHAPTER 15
MODERN MACROECONOMICS: FROM THE SHORT RUN TO THE LONG RUN
314
Using aggregate demand and aggregate supply, we can illustrate graphically
how changing prices and wages help move the economy from the short to the long
run. First, let s review the graphical representations of aggregate demand and
aggregate supply:
1 Aggregate demand.
Recall from Chapter 9 that the aggregate demand curve
shows the relationship between the level of prices and the quantity of real
GDP demanded.
2 Aggregate supply.
Also recall from Chapter 9 that there are two aggregate supply
curves: one for the short run and one for the long run. The short-run aggregate
supply curve is represented as a relatively flat curve. The shape of the curve
reflects the idea that prices do not change very much in the short run and that
firms adjust production to meet demand. The long-run aggregate supply
curve, however, is represented by a perfectly vertical line. The vertical line means
that at any given price level, firms in the long run are producing all that they can,
given the amount of labor, capital, and technology available to them in the econ-
omy. The line represents what firms can supply in the long run at a state of full
employment or potential output.
Returning to Full Employment from a Recession
In Chapter 9, we looked at the adjustment process for an economy producing at a level
of output exceeding full employment or potential output. Now let s look at what hap-
pens if the economy is in a slump, producing below full employment or potential out-
put. Panel A of Figure 15.1 shows an aggregate demand curve and the two aggregate
supply curves. In the short run, output and prices are determined where the aggregate
demand curve intersects the short-run aggregate supply curve
point a. This point
corresponds to the level of output y0 and a price level P0. Notice that y0 is a level less
than full employment or potential output, yp. In the long run, the level of prices and
output is given by the intersection of the aggregate demand curve and the long-run
aggregate supply curve
point c. Output is at full employment, yp, and prices are at PF.
How does the economy move from point a in the short run to point c in the long run?
Panel B shows us how.
At point a, the current level of output, y0, falls short of the full-employment level
of output, yp. With output less than full employment, the unemployment rate is above
the natural rate. Firms find it relatively easy to hire and retain workers, and wages and
then prices begin to fall. As the level of prices decreases, the short-run aggregate sup-
ply curve shifts downward over time, as shown in Panel B. This downward shift occurs
because decreases in wages lower costs for firms. Competition between firms will lead
to lower prices for their products.
As shown in Panel B, this shift in the short-run aggregate supply curve will
bring the economy to long-run equilibrium. The economy initially starts at point a,

How the Economy Recovers from
a Downturn
If the economy is operating below full
employment, as shown in Panel A,
prices will fall, shifting down the short-
run aggregate supply curve, as shown in
Panel B. This will return output to its
full-employment level.

315
PART 6
where output falls short of full employment. As prices fall from P0 to P1, the aggre-
gate supply curve shifts downward from AS0 to AS1. The aggregate demand curve
and the new aggregate supply curve intersect at point b. This point corresponds to a
lower level of prices and a higher level of real output. However, the higher level of
output still is less than full employment. Wages and prices will continue to fall,
shifting the short-run aggregate supply curve downward.
Eventually, the aggregate supply curve will shift to AS2, and the economy will
reach point c, the intersection of the aggregate demand curve and the long-run aggre-
gate supply curve. At this point, the adjustment stops because the economy is at full
employment and the unemployment rate is at the natural rate. With unemployment at
the natural rate, the downward wage price spiral ends. The economy has made the
transition to the long run. Prices are lower and output returns to full employment.
This is how an economy recovers from a recession or a downturn.
Returning to Full Employment from a Boom
But what if the economy is too hot  instead of sluggish? What will then happen is the
process we just described, only in reverse, as we show in Figure 15.2. When output
exceeds potential, unemployment will be below the natural rate. As firms bid for labor,
the wage price spiral will begin, but this time in an upward direction instead of down-
ward as in Panel B. The short-run aggregate supply curve will shift upward until the
economy returns to full employment. That is, wages and prices will rise to return the
economy to its long-run equilibrium at full employment.
In summary:
If output is less than full employment, prices will fall as the economy returns to
full employment, as shown in Figure 15.1.
If output exceeds full employment, prices will rise and output will fall back to
full employment, as shown in Figure 15.2.

How the Economy Returns from a Boom
If the economy is operating above full employment, as shown in Panel A, prices will rise, shifting the

employment level.
Economic Policy and the Speed of Adjustment
How long does it take to move from the short run to the long run? Economists dis-
agree on the answer. Some economists estimate it takes the U.S. economy two years
or less, some say six years, and others say somewhere in between. Because the adjust-
ment process is slow, there is room, in principle, for policymakers to step in and guide
the economy back to full employment.

CHAPTER 15
MODERN MACROECONOMICS: FROM THE SHORT RUN TO THE LONG RUN
316
Suppose the economy is operating below full employment at point a in
Figure 15.3. One alternative for policymakers is to do nothing, allowing the economy
to adjust itself with falling wages and prices until it returns by itself to full employ-
ment, point b. This may take several years. During that time, the economy will expe-
rience excess unemployment and a level of real output below potential.

Using Economic Policy to Fight a
Recession
Rather than letting the economy natu-
rally return to full employment at
point b, economic policies could be
implemented to increase aggregate
demand from AD0 to AD1 to bring the
economy to full employment at point c.
The price level within the economy,
however, would be higher.
Another alternative is to use expansionary policies, such as open market purchases
by the Fed or increases in government spending and tax cuts, to shift the aggregate
demand curve to the right. In Figure 15.3, we show how expansionary policies could
shift the aggregate demand curve from AD0 to AD1 and move the economy to full
employment, point c. Notice here that the price level is higher at point c than it would
be at point b.
Demand policies can also prevent a wage price spiral from emerging if the econ-
omy is producing at a level of output above full employment. Rather than letting an
increase in wages and prices bring the economy back to full employment, we can
reduce aggregate demand. Either contractionary monetary policy
open market
sales
or contractionary fiscal policy
cuts in government spending or tax
increases
can be used to reduce aggregate demand and the level of GDP until it
reaches potential output.
Expansionary policies and demand policies are stabilization policies, which look
simple on paper or on graphs. In practice, the lags and uncertainties we discussed for
both fiscal and monetary policy make economic stabilization difficult to achieve. For
example, suppose we are in a recession and the Fed decides to increase aggregate
demand using expansionary monetary policy. There will be a lag in the time it takes
for the aggregate demand curve to shift to the right. In the meantime, the adjustment
that occurs during a recession
falling wages and prices
has begun to shift the short-
run aggregate supply curve downward. It is conceivable that if the adjustment were
fast enough, the economy would be restored to full employment before the effects of
the expansionary monetary policy were actually felt. When the expansionary mone-
tary policy kicks in and the aggregate demand curve finally shifts to the right, the
additional aggregate demand would increase the level of output so it exceeded the full-
employment level, leading to a wage price spiral. In this case, monetary policy would
have destabilized the economy.
Active economic policies are more likely to destabilize the economy if the adjust-
ment is quick enough. Economists like Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago
(1912 2006) believed the economy adjusts rapidly to full employment and generally
opposed using monetary or fiscal policy to try to stabilize the economy. Economists

317
PART 6
like John Maynard Keynes believed that the economy adjusted slowly and were more
sympathetic to using monetary or fiscal policy to stabilize the economy.
It is possible that the speed of adjustment can vary over time, making decisions
about policy even more difficult. As an example, economic advisers for President
George H. W. Bush had to decide whether the economy needed any additional
stimulus after the recession of 1990. Based on the view that the economy would
recover quickly on its own, they took only some minor steps. The economy did
largely recover by the very end of the Bush administration, but too late for his
reelection prospects.
Liquidity Traps
Up to this point, we have assumed the economy could always recover from a reces-
sion without active policy, although it may take a long time. As our chapter-opening
story mentioned, Keynes expressed doubts about whether a country could recover
from a major recession without active policy. He had two distinct reasons for these
doubts. First, as we will discuss later in the chapter, the adjustment process
requires interest rates to fall and thereby increase investment spending. But sup-
pose nominal interest rates become so low that they could not fall any further.
Keynes called this situation a liquidity trap. When the economy is experiencing a
liquidity trap, the adjustment process no longer works. Second, Keynes feared
falling prices could hurt businesses. Japan seems to have suffered from both these
problems in the 1990s.
Political Business Cycles
Up to now, we have assumed policymakers are motivated to use policy to try to
improve the economy. But suppose they are more interested in promoting their per-
sonal well-being and the fortunes of their political parties? Using monetary or fiscal
liquidity trap
A situation in which nominal interest rates
are so low, they can no longer fall.

AVOIDING A LIQUIDITY TRAP
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: What steps can policymakers take to deal
with a possible liquidity trap?
As a keen student of the Great Depression, Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke
became concerned when short term interest rates
such as the federal funds rate
fell
below 0.5 percent in late 2008 as the Fed responded to the financial crisis. Bernanke
recognized that with interest rates already so low, there was little room for the Fed to
decrease them further. What steps could the Fed take to deal with what appeared to be
a looming liquidity trap?
A number of academic economists suggested that the Fed commit to increasing
inflation in the future by promising to create new money far into the future. Then,
even if nominal rates could not fall below zero, real rates of interest (nominal minus
expected inflation) could be negative. However, since the Fed is responsible for main-
taining a low inflation rate, this was not an ideal policy.
The Fed decided to begin paying interest on bank reserves. Although there were
several reasons for this policy, one reason that the Fed advanced was that this would
put a floor on market interest rates. After all, if banks could earn, for example, 0.5 per-
cent on their reserves, they would not lend those reserves out at lower rates to other
banks or make loans at lower rates. The Fed had found a new tool to manage an econ-
omy with low interest rates.

ELECTIONS, POLITICAL PARTIES, AND VOTER EXPECTATIONS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: What are the links between presidential
elections and macroeconomic performance?
The original political business cycle theories focused on incumbent presidents trying
to manipulate the economy in their favor to gain reelection. Subsequent research
began to incorporate other, more realistic factors.
The first innovation was to recognize that political parties could have different
goals or preferences. In particular, in the United States, Republicans historically have
been more concerned about fighting inflation, whereas Democrats have placed more
weight on reducing unemployment. Economists and political scientists began to
incorporate these partisan effects into their analyses.
The second major innovation was to recognize that the public would anticipate
that politicians will try to manipulate the economy. Suppose that, if elected,
Republicans will contract the economy to fight inflation, whereas Democrats will
stimulate the economy to lower unemployment. If the public is not sure who will win
the election, the outcome will be a surprise to them
a contractionary surprise if
Republicans win and an expansionary surprise if Democrats win. As Professor Alberto
Alesina of Harvard University first pointed out, this suggests that economic growth
should be less if Republicans win and greater if Democrats win. The postwar U.S. evi-
dence is generally supportive of this theory.

policy in the short run to improve a politician s reelection prospects may generate
what is known as a political business cycle.
Here is how a political business cycle might work. About a year or so before an elec-
tion, a politician might use expansionary monetary policy or fiscal policy to stimulate the
economy and lower unemployment. If voters respond favorably to lower unemploy-
ment, the incumbent politician may be reelected. After reelection, the politician faces
the prospect of higher prices or crowding out. To avoid this, the politician may engage
in contractionary policies. The result is a classic political business cycle: Because of
actions taken by politicians for reelection, the economy booms before an election but
contracts afterwards. Good news comes before the election, and bad news comes later.
It is clear the classic political business cycle does not always occur; however, a
number of episodes fit the scenario. President Nixon used expansionary policies dur-
ing a reelection campaign in 1972, which resulted in inflation. However, counter-
examples also exist, such as President Carter s deliberate attempt to reduce inflation
with contractionary policies just before his reelection bid in the late 1970s. Although
the evidence on the classic political business cycle is mixed, there may be links
between elections and economic outcomes. More recent research has investigated
the systematic differences that may exist between political parties and economic out-
comes. All this research takes into account both the short- and long-run effects of
economic policies.
UNDERSTANDING THE ECONOMICS OF THE
ADJUSTMENT PROCESS
Earlier in the chapter we explained that changes in wages and prices restore the econ-
omy to full employment in the long run, and that the government and the Fed can get
it there more quickly with fiscal and monetary policy. But what is happening behind

the scenes? What do changes in wages and the price level mean for the economy in
terms of money demand, interest rates, and investment spending? Lets go back and
take a closer look at the adjustment process in terms of these factors so we can better
understand how the adjustment process actually works.
First, recall that when an economy is producing below full employment, the ten-
dency will be for wages and prices to fall. Similarly, when an economy is producing at
a level exceeding full employment or potential output, the tendency will be for wages
and prices to rise.
The adjustment process first begins to work as changes in prices affect the
demand for money. Recall the real-nominal principle.
R E A L - N O M I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
What matters to people is the real value of money or income
its
purchasing power
not the face value of money or income.
According to this principle, the amount of money people want to hold depends on
the price level in the economy. If prices are cut in half, you need to hold only half as
much money to purchase the same goods and services. Decreases in the price level will
cause the money demand curve to shift to the left; increases in the price level will shift
it to the right. Now let s put this idea to use.
Suppose the economy is initially in a recession. With output below full employ-
ment, actual unemployment will exceed the natural rate of unemployment, so there
will be excess unemployment. Wages and prices will start to fall. Figure 15.4 shows
how the fall in the price level can restore the economy to full employment via money
demand, interest rates, and investment without active fiscal or monetary policy. First,
we show with the AD AS diagram in Panel A of Figure 15.4 how prices fall when the
economy is operating below full employment. Second, in Panel B, the fall in the price
level decreases the demand for holding money. As the price level decreases from P0 to
P1, the demand for money shifts to the left from 
to 
. Interest rates fall from r0
to r1, and the falling interest rates increase investment spending from I0 to I1. As the
level of investment spending in the economy increases, total demand for goods and

How the Changing Price Level Restores the Economy to Full Employment
With the economy initially below full employment, the price level falls, as shown in Panel A,
stimulating output. In Panel B, the lower price level decreases the demand for money and leads
to lower interest rates at point d. In Panel C, lower interest rates lead to higher investment
spending at point f. As the economy moves down the aggregate demand curve from point a
toward full employment at point b in Panel A, investment spending increases along the aggre-
gate demand curve.

CHAPTER 15
MODERN MACROECONOMICS: FROM THE SHORT RUN TO THE LONG RUN
320
services also increases, and the economy moves down along the aggregate demand
curve as it returns to full employment.
Now you can also understand why the aggregate demand curve is downward-
sloping through the interest rate effect. As we move down the aggregate demand
curve, lower prices lead to lower interest rates, higher investment spending, and a
higher level of aggregate demand. Thus, aggregate demand increases as the price level
falls, which explains why the curve slopes downward.
What we have just described continues until the economy reaches full employ-
ment. As long as actual output is below the economys full-employment level, prices
will continue to fall. A fall in the price level reduces money demand and interest rates.
Lower interest rates stimulate investment spending and push the economy back
toward full employment. All this works in reverse if output exceeds the economy s
potential output. In this case, the economy is overheating and wages and prices rise. A
higher price level will increase the demand for money and raise interest rates. Higher
interest rates will decrease investment spending and reduce the level of output. The
process continues until the economy cools off  and returns to full employment.
Now you should understand why changes in wages and prices restore the econ-
omy to full employment. The key is that (1) changes in wages and prices change the
demand for money, and (2) this changes interest rates, which then affect aggregate
demand for goods and services and ultimately GDP.
We can also use the model we just developed to understand the liquidity trap. If
an economy is in a recession, interest rates will fall, restoring the economy to full
employment. But at some point, interest rates may become so low they equal zero.
Nominal interest rates cannot go far below zero, because investors would rather hold
money (which pays a zero rate) than hold a bond that promises a negative return.
Suppose, however, that as interest rates approach zero, the economy is still in a slump.
The adjustment process then has nowhere to go. This appears to be what happened in
Japan in the 1990s. Interest rates on government bonds were zero, but prices contin-
ued to fall. At this point, the fall in prices by itself could not restore the economy to
full employment. Policymakers in the United States also became concerned by this
possibility. When interest rates on three-month U.S. government bills fell below
1 percent from June 2003 to May 2004, Fed officials openly discussed their limited
options if further monetary stimulus became necessary.
What can policymakers do if an economy is in a recession but nominal rates
become so close to zero that the natural adjustment process ceases to work?
Economists have suggested several solutions to this problem. First, expansionary fis-
cal policy
cutting taxes or raising government spending
still remains a viable
option to increase aggregate demand. Second, the Fed could become extremely
aggressive and try to expand the money supply so rapidly that the public begins to
anticipate future inflation. If the public expects inflation, the expected real rate of
interest (the nominal rate minus the expected inflation rate) can become negative,
even if the nominal rate cannot fall below zero. A negative expected real interest rate
will tempt firms to invest, and this will increase aggregate demand. Finally, as we
described in Application 1, the Fed began to pay interest on reserves to give itself
more leverage for monetary policy. Even though a liquidity trap may make it more
difficult for an economy to recover on its own, there is still room for proper eco-
nomic policy to have an impact.
The Long-Run Neutrality of Money
An increase in the money supply has a different effect on the economy in the short run
than it does in the long run. In Figure 15.5, we show the effects of expansionary mon-
etary policy in both the short run and the long run. In the short run, as the supply of
money increases, the economy moves from the original equilibrium to point a, with
output above potential. But in the long run, the economy returns to point b at full
employment, but at a higher price level than at the original equilibrium. How can the
Federal Reserve change the level of output in the short run but affect prices only in

321
PART 6
the long run? Why is the short run different from the long run? We can use our model
of the demand for money and investment to understand this issue.
Assume the economy starts at full employment. In Figure 15.6, interest rates are
at rF, and investment spending is at IF. Now, suppose the Federal Reserve increases
the money supply from 
to 
. We show this as a rightward movement in the
money-supply curve. In the short run, the increase in the supply of money will reduce
interest rates to r0, and the level of investment spending will increase to I0. Increased
investment will stimulate the economy and increase output above full employment.
All this occurs in the short run. The red arrows show the movements in interest rates
and investment in the short run.

Starting at full employment, an increase in the supply of money from Ms

1 will initially reduce
interest rates from rF to r0 (from point a to point b) and raise investment spending from IF to I0

price level increases, the demand for money increases, restoring interest rates and investment to
their prior levels
rF and IF, respectively. Both money supplied and money demanded will remain at
a higher level, though, at point e.
However, once output exceeds full employment, wages and prices will start to
increase. As the price level increases, the demand for money will increase. This will
shift the money-demand curve upward and will start to increase interest rates.
Investment will start to fall as interest rates increase, leading to a fall in output. The
blue arrows in Figure 15.6 show the transition as prices increase. As long as output
exceeds full employment, prices will continue to rise, money demand will continue
to increase, and interest rates will continue to rise. Where does this process end? It
ends only when interest rates return to their original level of rF. At an interest rate
of rF, investment spending will have returned to IF. This is the level of investment
that meets the total level of demand for goods and services and keeps the economy
at full employment.

CHAPTER 15
MODERN MACROECONOMICS: FROM THE SHORT RUN TO THE LONG RUN
322
When the economy returns to full employment, the levels of real interest rates,
investment, and output are precisely the same as they were before the Fed increased
the supply of money. The increase in the supply of money had no effect on real inter-
est rates, investment, or output in the long run. Economists call this the long-run
neutrality of money. In other words, in the long run, changes in the supply of money
are neutral with respect to real variables in the economy. For example, if the price of
everything in the economy doubles, including your paycheck, you are no better or
worse off than you were before. In the long run, increases in the supply of money have
no effect on real variables, only on prices.
This example points out how, in the long run, it really does not matter how
much money is in circulation, because prices will adjust to the amount of nominal
money available. In the short run, however, money is not neutral. In the short run,
changes in the supply of money do affect interest rates, investment spending, and
output. The Fed does have strong powers over real GDP, but those powers are
ultimately temporary. In the long run, all the Fed can do is determine the level of
prices in the economy.
Now we can understand why the job of the Federal Reserve has been described by
William McChesney Martin, Jr., a former Federal Reserve chairman, as taking the
punch bowl away at the party.  The punch bowl is money: If the Fed sets out the
punch bowl, this will temporarily increase output or give the economy a brief high.
But if the Federal Reserve is worried about increases in prices in the long run, it must
take the punch bowl away and everyone must sober up. If not, the result will be con-
tinuing increases in prices, or inflation.
Crowding Out in the Long Run
Some economists are strong proponents of increasing government spending on
defense or other programs to stimulate the economy. Critics, however, say increases in
spending provide only temporary relief and ultimately harm the economy because
government spending crowds out  investment spending. In Chapter 7, we discussed
the idea of crowding out. We can now understand the idea in more detail.
Suppose the economy starts out at full employment and then the government
increases its spending. This will shift the aggregate demand curve to the right, causing
output to increase beyond full employment. As we have seen, the result of this boom
will be that wages and prices increase.
Now let s turn to our model of money demand and investment. Figure 15.7
shows that as prices increase, the demand for money shifts upward in Panel A, rais-
ing interest rates from r0 to r1 and reducing investment from I0 to I1, as shown in
long-run neutrality of money
A change in the supply of money has no
effect on real interest rates, investment, or

A P P L I C AT I O N 3
INCREASING HEALTH-CARE EXPENDITURES AND
CROWDING OUT
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Will increases in health-care expenditures
crowd out consumption or investment spending?
In 1950 health-care expenditures in the United States were 5.2 percent of GDP; by
2000 this share had risen to 15.4 percent. Driving these increases were several factors:
increasing relative prices of health care compared to other goods, a larger population
of the elderly, and increased longevity. Since 1950 the average life span has increased
by 1.7 years per decade.
Many observers think these trends will continue. Health-care costs have contin-
ued to rise rapidly in recent years. Two economists, Charles I. Jones and Robert E.
Hall, go further and suggest normal increases in economic growth will propel
health-care expenditures to approximately 30 percent of GDP by mid-century.
Their argument is that as societies grow wealthier, individuals face the tradeoff of
buying more goods (automobiles or cars) to enjoy their current life span or spending
more on health care to extend their lives. At some point, the extra years of life
become more valuable than consumer durables, with the result that spending on
health care rises rapidly.
Assuming this argument is correct and health-care expenditures increase, what
other component of GDP will fall? If investment is crowded out, living standards
would fall in the long run, reducing the ability to consume both health and non-
health goods. Perhaps it is more likely that other types of consumption spending
will fall. Spending on health would then come at the expense of spending on con-
sumer durables or larger houses. That would be the preferred outcome.

Exercise 3.7.

Panel B. Higher interest rates are the mechanism through which crowding out of
public investment occurs. As investment spending by the public then falls (gets
crowded out), we know that aggregate demand decreases. This process will continue
until the economy returns to full employment. Once the economy returns to full
employment, the decrease in investment spending by the public will exactly match
the increase in government spending. However, when the economy does return to
full employment, it will be at a higher interest rate level and lower level of invest-
ment spending by the public.
Thus, the increase in government spending has no long-run effect on the level of
output
just on the interest rate. Instead, the increase in government spending dis-
placed, or crowded out, private investment spending. If the government spending
went toward government investment projects
such as bridges or roads
then it will
have just replaced an equivalent amount of private investment. If the increased gov-
ernment spending did not go toward providing investment but, for example, went for
military spending, then the reduction in private investment will have reduced total
investment in the economy, private and public. This decrease in total investment
would have further negative effects on the economy over time. As we saw in earlier
chapters, a reduction in investment spending reduces capital deepening and leads to
lower levels of real income and wages in the future.
Economists make similar arguments when it comes to tax cuts. Tax cuts ini-
tially will increase consumer spending and lead to a higher level of GDP. In the

CHAPTER 15
MODERN MACROECONOMICS: FROM THE SHORT RUN TO THE LONG RUN
324
long run, however, adjustments in wages and prices restore the economy to full
employment. However, interest rates will rise during the adjustment process and
this increase in interest rates will crowd out private investment. In the long run, the
increase in consumption spending will come at the expense of lower investment
spending, decreased capital deepening, and lower levels of real income and wages
in the future.
Crowding out can occur from sources other than the government. Expected
increases in U.S. health-care expenditures will pose similar challenges to crowding out
in the coming decades as well.
What about decreases in government spending or increases in taxes? Decreases in
government spending, such as cuts in military spending, will lead to increases in
investment in the long run, which we call crowding in. Initially, a decrease in govern-
ment spending will cause a decrease in real GDP. But as prices fall, the demand for
money will decrease, and interest rates will fall. Lower interest rates will crowd in
investment as the economy returns to full employment. In the longer run, the higher
investment spending will raise living standards through capital deepening. Increased
taxes, to the extent they reduce consumption spending, will crowd in investment
through precisely the same mechanism.
CLASSICAL ECONOMICS IN HISTORICAL
PERSPECTIVE
The term classical economics refers to the work of the originators of modern economic
thought. Adam Smith was the first so-called classical economist. Other classical
economists
Jean-Baptiste Say, David Ricardo, John Stuart Mill, and Thomas
Malthus
developed their work during the late eighteenth and nineteenth cen-
turies. Keynes first used the term classical model in the 1930s to contrast it with his
Keynesian model, which emphasized the difficulties the economy could face in the
short run. The ideas developed in this chapter can shed some light on a historical
debate in economics about the role of full employment in modern Keynesian and
classical thought.
Say s Law
Classical economics is often associated with Say s law, the doctrine that supply creates
its own demand.  To understand Say s law, recall from our discussion of GDP
accounting in Chapter 5 that production in an economy creates an equivalent amount
of income. For example, if GDP is $10 trillion, then production is $10 trillion, and
$10 trillion in income is generated. The classical economists argued that the $10 tril-
lion of production also created $10 trillion in demand for current goods and services.
This meant there could never be a shortage of demand for total goods and services in
the economy, nor any excess.
But suppose consumers, who earned the income, decided to save rather than
spend it. Wouldn t this increase in saving lead to a shortfall in the total demand for
goods and services? Wouldn t, say, inventories of goods pile up in warehouses?
Classical economists argued no, that the increase in savings would eventually find its
way to an equivalent increase in investment spending by firms, because the savings by
households would eventually get channeled to firms via financial markets. As a result
spending on consumption and investment together would be sufficient so that all the
goods and services produced in the economy would be purchased.
Keynes, on the other hand, argued that there could be situations in which total
demand fell short of total production in the economy for extended periods of time. In
particular, if consumers increased their savings, there was no guarantee that invest-
ment spending would rise to offset the decrease in consumption. And if total spending
did fall short of total demand, goods and services would go unsold. When producers
15.4

325
could not sell their goods, they would cut back on production, and output in the econ-
omy would consequently fall, leading to a recession or depression.
Keynesian and Classical Debates
The debates between Keynesian and classical economists continued for several
decades after Keynes developed his theories. In the 1940s, Professor Don Patinkin
and Nobel Laureate Franco Modigliani clarified the conditions for which the classical
model would hold true. In particular, they studied the conditions under which there
would be sufficient demand for goods and services when the economy was at full
employment. Both economists emphasized that one of the necessary conditions for
the classical model to work was that wages and prices must be fully flexible
that is,
they must adjust rapidly to changes in demand and supply.
If wages and prices are not fully flexible, then Keynes s view that demand could
fall short of production is more likely to hold true. We ve seen that over short periods
of time, wages and prices, indeed, are not fully flexible, so Keynes s insights are impor-
tant. However, over longer periods of time, wages and prices do adjust and the
insights of the classical model are restored.
To help clarify the conditions under which the economy will return to full
employment in the long run on its own, Patinkin and Modigliani developed the
adjustment-process model we used in this chapter. They highlighted many of the key
points we emphasized, including the speed of the adjustment process and possible pit-
falls, such as liquidity traps.
In the chapter-opening story, we noted that some economists advocate aggressive
government action during recessions, while others feel that such actions may impede
recovery. We now have a better understanding of why economists differ on these
issues. Economists who feel the adjustment process is slow typically recommend
activist policies, while those who believe that adjustment is more rapid will tend to be
skeptical of activist policies. In addition, economists will differ in their judgments
about the ability of the government to act quickly and make effective decisions. That
will also determine whether they believe policy will make the economy perform better
or worse.
This chapter explained how
the economy makes the transi-
tion from the short run to the
long run. It also highlighted
why monetary and fiscal poli-
cies have different effects in
the short run and in the long
run. Understanding the distinc-
tion between the short run and the long run is critical to evalu-
ating economic policy. Here are the main points to remember
from this chapter:
1 The short run in macroeconomics refers to the period of time
in which prices do not change very much. The long run in
macroeconomics is the period over which prices have time to
change in response to economic changes.
2 When output exceeds full employment, wages and prices rise
faster than their past trends. If output is less than full employ-
ment, wages and prices fall relative to past trends.
3 The price changes that occur when the economy is away
from full employment push the economy back to full
employment. Economists disagree on the length of time this
adjustment process takes; estimates range from less than
two years to six years.
4 Economic policies are most effective when the adjustment
process is slow. However, to improve their chances of
being reelected, politicians can take advantage of the dif-
ference between the short-run and long-run effects of eco-
nomic policies.
5 If the economy is operating below full employment, falling
wages and prices will reduce money demand and lower
interest rates. The fall in interest rates will stimulate invest-
ment and lead the economy back to full employment.
6 The reverse occurs when output exceeds full employment.
Increases in wages and prices will increase money demand
and interest rates. As investment spending falls, the econ-
omy returns to full employment.
7 In the long run, increases in the supply of money are neutral.
That is, increases in the money supply do not affect real inter-
est rates, investment, or output. This characteristic is known
as the long-run neutrality of money.

Cost of Living Adjustments and the Wage Price
Spiral. Suppose organized labor has successfully bar-
gained for cost of living increases for its workers. That
is, when prices rise
as measured by the CPI
wages
are automatically adjusted by the same percentage.
Would this make the economy more or less likely to
experience a wage price spiral?
1.6
Unemployment and Wage Price Changes. If the nat-
ural rate of unemployment is 6 percent and the actual
rate of unemployment is 7 percent, how will wages and
prices change? Suppose the natural rate was 7 percent?

Supply Shocks and Policy Choices. In Chapter 9,
we discussed supply shocks, sudden increases in the
prices of commodities such as oil or food. These
shocks shift the short-run aggregate supply curve. For
example, the increase in oil prices in 2006 will shift the
short-run aggregate supply curve upward, because
firms costs have risen and firms must charge higher
prices to avoid losing money.
a. Suppose the economy is operating at full
employment and foreign countries raise the world
price of oil. Assuming policymakers do not take any
action, describe what will happen to prices and
output in the short run and in the long run. Show
these situations graphically.
b. Suppose the Federal Reserve decided it wanted to
offset any adverse effects on output due to a supply
shock. What actions could it take? What would
happen to the price level if the Fed used monetary
policy to fight unemployment in this situation?
c. Economists say supply shocks create a dilemma
for the Federal Reserve that shocks to demand (for
example, from sudden increases in investment
spending by optimistic firms) do not create.
Using your answer to part (b) and the aggregate
demand and aggregate supply graph, explain why
economists say this.

Stabilization Policy and the Speed of Adjustment.
Economists who believe the transition from the short
run to the long run occurs rapidly do not generally
favor using active stabilization policy. Use the aggre-
gate demand and aggregate supply graphs to illustrate
how active policy, with a rapid adjustment process,
could destabilize the economy.
2.7
Understanding the Liquidity Trap. The adjust-
ment process can run into problems during a liquidity
trap when interest rates are driven close to zero and
the economy remains below full employment. Both
Japan in the 1990s and the United States during the
Great Depression in the 1930s are possible exam-
ples of liquidity traps. (Related to Application 1 on
page 317.)

rates actually dropped and when they were at
their lowest.

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
As the financial crisis spread in 2008, central banks
around the world increased the supply of money and
liquidity, and governments borrowed extensively and
incurred increasing amounts of government debt.
Increases in the supply of money and debt are often pre-
cursors for inflation. Although a slack economy limited any
inflationary pressures and, in some cases, led to mild defla-
tion, there were concerns by some that inflation would
inevitably follow in the not-too-distant future.
One traditional indicator of a fear of inflation was the
price of gold. From 2005 to 2010, the price of an ounce of
gold rose from approximately $400 to $1200, an increase
by a factor of three! This was precisely during the same
period when stock markets worldwide first rose and then
sharply fell. Commercials for investing in gold products
appeared on cable television and radio stations through-
out the country.
Gold, however, is a very risky investment and not suit-
able for most people. An alternative strategy some
investors use is to buy Treasury Inflation Protected
Securities
or TIPS. These securities provide investors with
guaranteed purchasing power, but typically with a lower
return. Buying insurance against inflation is costly
it is
much better if central banks do not let inflation develop in
the first place.

I
n this chapter, we integrate two themes we ve been stressing separately:

nominal wages
Wages expressed in current dollars.
real wage
The wage rate paid to employees adjusted
for changes in the price level.
money illusion
Confusion of real and nominal magnitudes.
expectations of inflation
The beliefs held by the public about the
likely path of inflation in the future.
In the short run, changes in money growth affect real output and real GDP.
In the long run, the rate of money growth determines the rate of inflation, not
real GDP.
Economic policy debates often concern inflation and unemployment because they
affect us all so directly. We will look at the relationships between inflation and unem-
ployment, examining macroeconomic developments in the United States in the last
several decades. We also explore why heads of central banks typically appear to be
strong enemies of inflation.
Although the United States had serious difficulties fighting inflation in the 1970s
and 1980s, other countries have, at times, had much more severe problems with infla-
tion. In this chapter, we ll study the origins of extremely high inflationary periods and
their links to government budget deficits.
MONEY GROWTH, INFLATION, AND
INTEREST RATES
An economy can, in principle, produce at full employment with any inflation rate. No
magic  inflation rate is necessary to sustain full employment. To understand this
point, consider the long run when the economy operates at full employment. As we
have seen, in the long run, money is neutral. If the Federal Reserve increases the
money supply at 5 percent a year, annual inflation will be 5 percent. That is, prices in
the economy will rise by 5 percent a year.
Inflation in a Steady State
Lets think about how this economy looks in this steady state  of constant inflation.
The nominal wages
wages in dollars
of workers are all rising at 5 percent a year.
However, because prices are also rising at 5 percent a year, real wages
wages
adjusted for changes in purchasing power
remain constant.
Some workers may feel cheated by the inflation. They might believe that without
inflation, they would experience real-wage increases, because their nominal wages are
rising 5 percent a year. Unfortunately, these workers are wrong. They suffer from
what economists call money illusion, a confusion of real and nominal magnitudes.
Here s the source of the illusion: Because real wages are constant, the only reason
nominal wages are rising by 5 percent a year is the general 5 percent inflation. If there
were no inflation, nominal wages would not increase at all.
After a time, everyone in the economy would begin to expect the 5 percent
annual inflation that had occurred in the past to continue in the future. Economists
call this belief expectations of inflation. People s expectations of inflation affect all
aspects of economic life. For example, in the steady-state economy we just
described, automobile producers will expect to increase the price of their products
by 5 percent every year. They will also expect their costs
of labor and steel, for
example
to increase by 5 percent a year. Workers will begin to believe the 5 per-
cent increase in their wages will be matched by a 5 percent increase in the prices of
the goods they buy. Continued inflation becomes the normal state of affairs, and
people build it into their daily decision making. For example, they expect the price
of a car to be 5 percent higher next year and will take that into consideration when
they go shopping for a new car.
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS AND INTEREST RATES
When the public expects
inflation, real and nominal rates of interest will differ because we need to account
for inflation in calculating the real return from lending and borrowing. Recall that
the nominal interest rate
the rate quoted in the market
is equal to the real rate of
interest plus the expected inflation rate. If the real rate of interest is 2 percent and
16.1

331
PART 6
inflation is 5 percent a year, the nominal interest rate will be 7 percent. Although
lenders receive 7 percent a year on their loans, their real return after inflation is just
2 percent.
In Chapter 15 you saw that in the long run, the real rate of interest does not
depend on monetary policy because money is neutral. That is, even though the money
supply may be higher or lower, the price level will be higher or lower. However,
nominal rates of interest do depend on monetary policy, because whether the Fed
expands or contracts the money supply affects the rate of inflation, which in the long
run is determined by the growth of the money supply. As Nobel Laureate Milton
Friedman pointed out, countries with higher money growth typically have higher
nominal interest rates than countries with lower money growth rates because they
have higher inflation. If Country A and Country B have the same real rate of interest,
but Country A has a higher inflation rate, Country A will also have a higher nominal
interest rate.
INFLATION EXPECTATIONS AND MONEY DEMAND
Money demand
the
amount of money people want to hold
will also be affected by expectations about
inflation. If people expect 5 percent inflation a year, then their demand for money will
also increase by 5 percent a year. The reason, of course, is that people know every-
thing will cost 5 percent more, so they ll need more money in their pockets to pay for
the same goods and services. This is an example of the real-nominal principle.
R E A L - N O M I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
What matters to people is the real value of money or income
its
purchasing power
not the face value of money or income.
As long as the Fed allows the supply of money to increase by 5 percent
the same
amount as inflation
the demand for money and its supply will both grow at the same
rate. Because money demand and supply are both growing at the same rate, real inter-
est rates and nominal interest rates will not change.
How Changes in the Growth Rate of Money Affect the Steady State
If the growth rate of money changes, however, there will be short-run effects on
real interest rates. To continue with our example, suppose the public expects 5 per-
cent annual inflation and both the money supply and money demand grow at 5 per-
cent a year. Now suppose the Fed suddenly decreases the annual growth rate of
money to 4 percent, while the public continues to expect 5 percent annual infla-
tion. Because money demand grows at 5 percent but the money supply grows at
only 4 percent, growth in the demand for money will exceed growth in the supply
of money. The result will be an increase in both real interest rates and nominal
interest rates.
We have seen that higher real rates of interest will reduce investment spending by
firms and reduce consumer durable goods spending by households. With reduced
firm and consumer demand for goods and services, real GDP will fall and unemploy-
ment will rise. The reduction in the growth rate of the money supply is contrac-
tionary. In the long run, however, output will return to full employment through the
adjustment process described in Chapter 15. The economy will eventually adjust to
the lower rate of money growth, and inflation will eventually fall from 5 percent to
4 percent per year to match it. In the long run, the real rate of interest will eventually
fall and return to its previous value. Nominal interest rates, which reflect expectations
of ongoing inflation, will be 1 percent lower, because inflation has fallen from 5 per-
cent to 4 percent per year. Table 16.1 depicts the long-run relationships between
money growth, inflation, increases in money demand, and real and nominal interest
rates in this example.

This basic pattern fits U.S. history in the late 1970s and early 1980s. At that
time, the Federal Reserve sharply decreased the growth rate of the money supply, so
interest rates rose temporarily. By 1981, interest rates on three-month Treasury bills
rose to over 14 percent from 7 percent in 1978. The economy went into a severe
recession, with unemployment exceeding 10 percent. By the mid-1980s, however, the
economy returned to full employment with lower interest rates and lower inflation
rates. By 1986, Treasury bill rates were below 6 percent.
This is another example in which the long-run effects of policy actions differ
from their short-run effects. In the short run, a policy of tight money leads to slower
money growth, higher interest rates, and lower output. But in the long run, reduced
money growth results in lower interest rates, lower inflation, and no effect on the level
of output.
UNDERSTANDING THE EXPECTATIONS
PHILLIPS CURVE: THE RELATIONSHIP
BETWEEN UNEMPLOYMENT AND INFLATION
In the late 1950s, A.W. Phillips was studying British economic data and noticed that
lower unemployment was associated with higher inflation. That is, the inflation rate
rises when economic activity booms and unemployment is low. Phillips also noticed
that the inflation rate falls when the economy is in a recession and unemployment is
high. This inverse relationship between unemployment and inflation became known
as the Phillips curve.
In the early 1960s, Nobel Laureates Paul Samuelson and Robert Solow found a
similar relationship between unemployment and the inflation rate in the United
States. However, these early studies examined periods when there was no significant
underlying inflation, and they did not take into account peoples expectations of infla-
tion. The relationship between unemployment and inflation when we take into
account expectations of inflation is known as the expectations Phillips curve.
The expectations Phillips curve was introduced into the economics profession in
the late 1960s by Edmund Phelps of Columbia University and Milton Friedman, then
at the University of Chicago. The expectations Phillips curve included the notion that
unemployment varies with unanticipated inflation. Friedman argued, for example, that
when the inflation rate suddenly increases, it is likely that workers did not fully antic-
ipate some of this sudden increase. Actual inflation will then exceed expected inflation.
Workers will see their nominal wages increase, but because they do not fully expect
this sudden inflation, they will think their real wages have risen. With higher per-
ceived real wages being offered, potential workers will be inclined to accept the jobs
firms offer them. As a result, unemployment will fall below the natural rate. That s
why we often see an association between increases in the inflation rate and a decrease
in the unemployment rate.
After workers recognize that the inflation rate is higher, though, they will incor-
porate this higher inflation rate into their expectations of inflation. They will no
longer confuse the higher nominal wages firms offer with higher real wages.
Unemployment will then return to its natural rate. So there is no permanent relation-
ship between the level of unemployment and the level of inflation.

PART 6
Similarly, if the inflation rate falls, workers may not expect some of this fall.
Because inflation is less than expected, workers will believe their real wages aren t ris-
ing as fast as they actually are. With lower perceived real wages being offered, poten-
tial workers will be less inclined to accept the jobs firms offer them. The
unemployment rate will increase as a result. However, once they recognize that infla-
tion is lower than they realized, and that the wages firms offered them really aren t
that low, workers will be more inclined to accept work. Unemployment will then
again return to the natural rate. So a decrease in the inflation rate is likely to be asso-
ciated with temporary increases in unemployment.
Later in this chapter we ll see an example of this relationship between infla-
tion and unemployment in the late 1980s and early 1990s. A disconnect  between
what people expect and what ultimately occurs can adversely affect the economy,
as we ll see next. Table 16.2 summarizes the key points about the expectations
Phillips curve.

Are the Public s Expectations about Inflation Rational?
As we just saw, expectations about inflation affect actual inflation because workers and
firms build their inflation forecasts into their wage- and price-setting decisions.
Mistakes in predicting inflation therefore have consequences. But how do workers and
firms form inflation expectations in the first place? And, second, when do they form
their inflation expectations?
Two broad classes of theories attempt to explain how the public forms its expecta-
tions of inflation. Some economists and psychologists, including Nobel Laureate
Herbert Simon, believe the public uses simple rules of thumb to predict future infla-
tion. One such rule of thumb might be to assume next years inflation rate will be the
same as this year s. According to this view, it is unreasonable to expect too much
sophistication from the public because of the complexity of the economy and the dif-
ficulty of forecasting it.
In the 1970s, a group of economists led by Nobel Laureate Robert E. Lucas, Jr.,
from the University of Chicago developed an alternative view, called the theory of
rational expectations. The rational expectations theory portrayed workers and firms
as much more sophisticated, basing their expectations on all the information available
to them. According to the theory, the public, on average, anticipates the future cor-
rectly. Although the public may make mistakes in specific instances, on average, peo-
ple s expectations are rational or correct.
The two approaches
rules of thumb versus rational expectations
tend to
deliver similar predictions when the economy is very stable and there are no major
policy changes. However, when there are major policy changes
for example, when
the government introduces new policies to fight inflation or reduce federal deficits
the two approaches predict different outcomes. The rational expectations theory pre-
dicts the public will anticipate the consequences of these policies and change its
expectations about inflation accordingly; the rule-of-thumb theory says it won t.
Which view is correct? The truth lies somewhere in the middle. On the one hand,
sophisticated firms, such as Microsoft and Walmart, do appear to take advantage of
available information. On the other hand, a considerable amount of inertia and non-
rationality appears to enter into the general public s decision-making process. And
sometimes the public may be rational about small signals but miss the big picture. For
rational expectations
The economic theory that analyzes how
the public forms expectations in such a
manner that, on average, it forecasts the
future correctly.

example, during the stock-market boom in the late 1990s, investors may have had an
accurate assessment of which tech stocks were relatively more promising but failed to
recognize that all tech stocks were overvalued.
The other major issue is the question of when inflation expectations are formed.
As we discussed in Chapter 9, both workers and firms often make explicit long-term
contracts or enter into implicit long-term agreements. With long-term contracts,
workers and firms must make forecasts far into the future. For example, if a union is
negotiating wages for three years, it will need to forecast inflation three years into the
future and negotiate current and future wages today based on that forecast. Making
decisions this far in advance is clearly very difficult, so it is understandable that mis-
takes can occur. Indeed, workers and firms can be quite rational but still make mis-
takes when predicting inflation simply because of the long time frames involved.
Wage contracts set in the early 1980s, for example, would have rationally  antici-
pated continued high inflation, although changes in monetary policy brought infla-
tion below what was predicted.
U.S. Inflation and Unemployment in the 1980s
We can use the expectations Phillips curve to help understand the patterns of inflation
and unemployment that occurred in the 1980s. For the sake of this discussion, we will
assume workers and firms follow relatively simple rules of thumb and that sudden
increases in inflation are partly unanticipated and thus accompanied by lower unem-
ployment. Conversely, sudden decreases in inflation are accompanied by temporarily
higher unemployment.
When President Jimmy Carter took office at the beginning of 1977, the infla-
tion rate was approximately 6.5 percent per year and unemployment exceeded
7 percent of the labor force. By 1980, inflation had risen to 9.4 percent. There
were two reasons for this increase. First, utilizing expansionary policy, the Carter
administration had steadily reduced unemployment to under 6 percent by 1979.
Because the natural rate of unemployment was close to 6 percent of the labor
force at that time, reducing unemployment below this rate led to an increase in
the annual inflation rate. Second, there was an oil shock in 1979, which also con-
tributed to higher inflation.
Fears of even higher inflation led President Carter to appoint a well-known
inflation fighter, Paul Volcker, as chairman of the Federal Reserve. Volcker immedi-
ately began to institute a tight money policy, and interest rates rose sharply by 1980.
When President Ronald Reagan took office, he supported Volcker s policy.
Eventually, high real-interest rates took their toll, and unemployment rose to over
10 percent by 1983. As actual unemployment exceeded the natural rate of unem-
ployment, the inflation rate fell, just as the expectations Phillips curve predicted. By
1986, the inflation rate fell to approximately 2.7 percent per year with unemploy-
ment at 7 percent of the labor force. The severe recession had done its job in reduc-
ing the inflation rate.
However, as we can see in Figure 16.1, after 1986 the unemployment rate began
to fall again, from about 7 percent to a little over 6 percent in 1987. Notice that as
actual unemployment fell below the natural rate (which, at that time, was about
6.5 percent), inflation began to rise, increasing from about 2.75 to 3 percent. By
1989, as unemployment continued to fall, annual inflation had risen to 4.5 percent,
and the Fed then raised interest rates to combat it. The Fed s action reduced output
and increased unemployment to over 7 percent. Notice that by 1992, inflation had
fallen dramatically because unemployment exceeded the natural rate.
By the time President George H. W. Bush took office in 1989, actual unemploy-
ment was below the natural rate of unemployment, inflation had been rising, and the
Fed started slowing down the economy. The rate of inflation was eventually reduced,
but the recovery back to full employment in 1992 1993 came too late in Bushs term
for the voters to fully appreciate, and he lost his bid for reelection.

SOURCE: Economic Report of the President (Washington, D.C.: U.S. Government Printing Office, yearly).
Shifts in the Natural Rate of Unemployment in the 1990s
Up to this point, our analysis assumes that the natural rate of unemployment is a
constant
say, for example, 5 percent of the labor force. If actual unemployment
falls below this constant rate (the economy is hot, in other words), inflation will tend
to increase. Similarly, if the actual unemployment exceeds 5 percent (the economy is
sluggish), inflation will fall.
But the natural rate of unemployment can shift over time. At the beginning of
the 1980s in the United States, most economists believed that the natural rate of
unemployment was between 6 or 7 percent. By the late 1990s, many economists had
begun to believe the natural rate of unemployment had fallen to about 5 percent.
What can shift the natural rate of unemployment? Economists have identified a
number of factors:
Demographics. The composition of the workforce can change, decreasing the
natural rate. For example, we know teenagers have higher unemployment rates
than adults. If changes in population lead to a lower percentage of teenagers in
the labor force, we would expect the natural rate of unemployment to decrease.
In the 1990s, the share of teenagers in the labor force fell. This change in demo-
graphics appears to have been what caused the natural rate of unemployment to
decline in the United States.
Institutional changes. Changes in laws, regulations, and economic institu-
tions can influence the natural rate of unemployment. Suppose the govern-
ment shortens the length of time unemployed workers can collect benefits.
We would then expect the unemployed to return to work more rapidly and
the natural rate of unemployment to fall. Some economists have argued that
the rise of temporary employment agencies in the United States during the
1990s made the labor market more efficient. Workers were matched more
quickly with jobs, and this contributed to the decline of the natural rate. In
Europe, a very different set of institutional factors had the opposite result:
Generous benefits for the unemployed increased the time they spent unem-
ployed. Restrictions on employers making it difficult to fire workers led them
to hire fewer people in the first place. Both these factors raised the natural
rate of employment.

CHAPTER 16
THE DYNAMICS OF INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT
336
The recent history of the economy. Some economists believe the economic
performance of the economy itself may influence the natural rate of unemploy-
ment. Suppose the economy goes into a long recession. During that time, many
young people may not be able to find jobs and will fail to develop a strong work
ethic. Other workers may lose some of their skills during a prolonged period of
unemployment. Both factors could lead to longer-term unemployment and an
increase in the natural rate of unemployment.
Changes in growth of labor productivity. If the growth rate in labor pro-
ductivity falls, wages must also rise more slowly because they are tied to pro-
ductivity increases in the long run. However, if workers don t realize this,
they might continue to push for higher nominal wage increases and be less
inclined to accept lower nominal wages. This will increase the natural rate of
unemployment. Similarly, if productivity growth is higher than anticipated,
wages will rise more quickly because firms will be willing to pay more to
retain their workers and recruit new ones. As a result of this unexpected pro-
ductivity growth, workers may not be as aggressive in asking for additional
nominal wage increases because they are pleased with what they are already
getting. They will be more inclined to accept these wages, and this will effec-
tively lower the natural rate of unemployment. Some economists believe this
in fact happened in the late 1990s when productivity growth soared and the
natural rate of unemployment temporarily fell. Actual unemployment fell to
near 4 percent without any visible signs of increasing inflation. Of course,
once workers in the economy understand that a shift in productivity growth
has occurred, the natural rate will return to its original value, closer to, say,
5 percent.
A P P L I C AT I O N 1
SHIFTS IN THE NATURAL RATE OF UNEMPLOYMENT
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How can data on vacancies and
unemployment be used to measure shifts in the natural rate?
Economists believe that the natural rate of unemployment changes over time,
although they often have difficulty pinning down an exact estimate. Policymakers
need to have an accurate assessment of the natural rate to avoid any unnecessary
unemployment or prevent inflation from emerging. But how can we estimate changes
in the natural rate?
One way to estimate the shifts in the natural rate of unemployment is to look at
the relationships between job vacancies and unemployment. Normally, the higher
the unemployment rate, the fewer job vacancies there will be. This relationship is
known as the Beveridge curve. But if the labor market matches individuals with jobs
more efficiently, resulting in a decline in the natural rate of unemployment
for
example, through the use of Internet searches or new technology
there will be
fewer job vacancies corresponding to any level of unemployment. Using a variety of
vacancy measures, economist William Dickens found that shifts in the relationship
between vacancies and unemployment allowed him to make new estimates of the nat-
ural rate. He found that the natural rate was approximately 5 percent in the mid
1960s, but then rose in the late 1960s and peaked near 7 percent in the late 1970s and
early 1980s. The natural rate began to drift down in the late 1980s and through the
1990s, again reaching the 5 percent level in 2000. It has since remained at this level.

Choices of the Fed: Recession or
Inflation
If workers push up their nominal wages,
the aggregate supply curve will shift
from AS0 to AS1. If the Fed keeps
aggregate demand constant at AD0, a
recession will occur at point a, and the
economy will eventually return to full
employment at point c. If the Fed
increases aggregate demand, the econ-
omy remains at full employment at b,
but with a higher price level.
The actions of the union will depend on what its leaders expect the Fed to do. On
the one hand, if they believe the Fed will not increase aggregate demand, their actions
will trigger a recession. Union leaders know this and might be reluctant to negotiate a
high wage because of it. If they don t negotiate an increase in nominal wages, the
economy will remain at full employment and there will be no increase in prices. On
the other hand, if union leaders believe the Fed will increase aggregate demand, they
have nothing to lose and will push for higher nominal wages. The result will be higher
prices in the economy.
As this example illustrates, expectations about the Fed s determination to fight
inflation will affect behavior in the private sector. If the Fed is credible or believable in
its desire to fight inflation, it can deter the private sector from taking aggressive
actions that drive up prices. This is the reason the heads of central banks are conserv-
ative, preferring to risk increasing unemployment rather than inflation. For example,
having a conservative chair of the Fed, someone who strongly detests inflation, sends
HOW THE CREDIBILITY OF A NATION S
CENTRAL BANK AFFECTS INFLATION
Why are the heads of central banks, such as the chair of the Federal Reserve Board of
Governors, typically very conservative and constantly warning about the dangers of
inflation? The basic reason is that these monetary policymakers can influence expec-
tations of inflation, and expectations of inflation will influence actual behavior of
workers and firms. For example, when workers anticipate inflation, they will push for
higher nominal wages. When firms anticipate inflation, they will set their prices
accordingly. If policymakers are not careful in the way they respond to expectations of
inflation, they can actually make it difficult for a society to fight inflation.
Consider an example. A large union is negotiating wages for workers in the
auto and steel industries. If the union negotiates a very high nominal wage, other
unions will likely follow, negotiating for and winning higher wages. Prices of autos
and steel will inevitably rise as a result, and the Fed will begin to see higher infla-
tion emerge. Suppose the Fed has been keeping the money supply constant. What
are its options?
We depict the Feds dilemma in Figure 16.2. By setting a higher nominal wage, the
union shifts the aggregate supply curve from AS0 to AS1. The Fed then has a choice:
Keep the money supply and aggregate demand at AD0. The economy will ini-
tially fall into a recession.
Increase the money supply and raise aggregate demand from AD0 to AD1. This
will keep the economy at full employment but lead to higher prices.

a signal to everyone in the economy that the Fed will be unlikely to increase the
money supply, regardless of what actions are taken in the private sector.
After experiencing relatively high average inflation from 1955 to 1988, New
Zealand took a different approach to ensure the credibility of its central bank. Since
1989, the central bank has been operating under a law that specifies its only goal is to
attempt to maintain stable prices, which, in practice, requires it to keep inflation
between 0 and 2 percent a year. This policy sharply limits the central bank s ability to
stabilize real GDP, but it does signal to the private sector that the central bank will
not be increasing the money supply, regardless of the actions taken by wage setters
or unions.
Our example suggests that with a credible central bank, a country can have lower
inflation without experiencing extra unemployment. Some political scientists and
economists have suggested that central banks that have true independence from the
rest of the government, and are therefore less subject to political influence, will be
more credible in their commitment to fighting inflation.
There is evidence to support this conjecture. Figure 16.3 plots an index of inde-
pendence against average inflation rates from 1955 to 1988 for 16 countries. The
points appear to lie along a downward-sloping line, meaning more independence is
associated with lower inflation. Germany and Switzerland, the countries with the
most-independent central banks during that time period, had the lowest inflation
rates. Another piece of evidence that credible banks can lower inflation safely is pro-
vided by the changes that occurred in the United Kingdom in the late 1990s.
As our discussion illustrates, how a central bank influences expectations is impor-
tant for understanding the behavior of prices and output in an economy. Understanding
how the private sector forms its inflation expectations in the first place is also important.
Economists have used the theory of rational expectations we discussed earlier to explain
the credibility of central banks. In our example, the theory of rational expectations
implies the union will, on average, anticipate whether the Fed will expand the money
supply in the face of wage increases. A credible Fed will tend to deter wage increases by
not expanding the money supply. Many economists believed Fed Chairman Alan
Greenspan was very credible in his determination to fight inflation. This in itself helped
reduce inflation during the 1990s. People expected that Greenspan would refuse to set
out the punch bowl  of money (see Chapter 15), and they were right.
But suppose someone does not believe the central bank will control inflation.
Does that person have any recourse? In the United States and some other countries,
he or she does. As we mentioned in the chapter opening story, the U.S. government
now sells bonds
TIPS
that protect an investor from inflation. Investors can protect
themselves from unexpected inflation by buying TIPS.

PART 6
INFLATION AND THE VELOCITY OF MONEY
Countries sometimes experience stunning inflation rates. For example, in 15 months
from August 1922 to November 1923, the price level in Germany rose by a factor of
10 billion! To explain these extremely high inflation rates and their relationship to
money growth, we now introduce a concept that is closely related to money demand:
the velocity of money. The velocity of money is defined as the ratio of nominal GDP to
the money supply:
One useful way to think of velocity is that it is the number of times money must
change hands, or turn over, in economic transactions during a given year for an econ-
omy to reach its GDP level. To understand this, consider a simple example. Suppose
nominal GDP is $5 trillion per year and the money supply is $1 trillion. The velocity
of money in this economy will then be as follows:
In this economy, the $1 trillion money supply has to change hands, or turn over, five
times a year to purchase the $5 trillion of nominal GDP. If the money supply turns
over five times in one year, this means people are holding each dollar of money for
365 days/5, or 73 days. If velocity is very high, people turn money over very quickly on
average and do not hold it for a long time. If velocity is low, people turn over money
slowly and hold onto it longer.

$5 trillion per year

INCREASED POLITICAL INDEPENDENCE FOR THE BANK OF
ENGLAND LOWERED INFLATION EXPECTATIONS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: Can changes in the way central banks are
governed affect inflation expectations?
On May 6, 1997, the then-chancellor of the exchequer in Great Britain, Gordon
Brown, announced a major change in monetary policy. From that time forward, the
Bank of England would be more independent from the government. Although the
government would still retain the authority to set the overall goals for policy, the Bank
of England would be free to pursue its policy goals without direct political control.
Mark Spiegel, an economist with the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco,
studied how the British bond market reacted to the policy change. He compared the
interest rate changes on two types of long-term bonds: British bonds that are auto-
matically adjusted (or indexed) for inflation (such as TIPS in the United States) and
bonds that are not. The difference between the two interest rates primarily reflects
expectations of inflation. Thus, if the gap narrowed following the policy announce-
ment, this would be evidence that the new policy reduced expectations of inflation. If
it did not, the announced policy would have had no effect on inflation expectations.
After the announcement, the gap narrowed, and Spiegel concluded the announce-
ment did, indeed, cause expectations about inflation to fall by about half a percentage.

velocity of money
The rate at which money turns over
during the year. It is calculated as nominal
GDP divided by the money supply.

CHAPTER 16
THE DYNAMICS OF INFLATION AND UNEMPLOYMENT
340
To further understand the role of money and velocity, lets rewrite the definition
of velocity as
or
where M is the money supply, V is the velocity of money, P is a price index for GDP,
and y is real GDP. This equation is known as the equation of exchange, or the
quantity equation. On the right side, 
is nominal GDP. It is the product of the
price index and real GDP. It also represents total nominal spending. On the left side,
the money supply, M, is multiplied by V, the velocity, or turnover rate, of money.
As you can see, the quantity equation links the money supply and velocity to nom-
inal GDP. If velocity is predictable, we can use the quantity equation and the supply of
money to predict nominal GDP. But it s not quite that easy; the velocity of money
does vary over time. Figure 16.4 plots the velocity of M2 (the measure of the money
supply that includes currency, demand deposits, savings accounts, time deposits, and
deposits in money market mutual funds) in the United States between 1959 and 2009.
During this period, velocity reached a low of around 1.6 in the 1960s and a high of 2.1
in the late 1990s. In other words, the total amount of M2 held by the public turned
over between 1.6 and 2.1 times a year for the U.S. economy to reach nominal GDP.

We can use the basic quantity equation to derive a closely related formula for
understanding inflation in the long run:
We will call this the growth version of the quantity equation. Here is how to
use this formula: Suppose money growth is 10 percent a year, the growth of real out-
put is 3 percent a year, and velocity has zero growth (it is constant). Then the rate of
growth of prices
the inflation rate, in other words
is
 7 percent = growth rate of prices (inflation)
 10 percent + 0 percent = growth rate of prices + 3 percent
 = growth rate of prices + growth rate of real output
 growth rate of money + growth rate of velocity

341
PART 6
Inflation will be 7 percent a year. The formula allows for real economic growth and for
growth in velocity. For example, if velocity grew during this period at the rate of 1 per-
cent a year instead of zero, the annual inflation rate would be 8 percent (10 + 1  3).
Economists use this formula to provide quick estimates of the inflation rate.
As we ve learned, there is a definite link between increases in the growth of
money and the rate of inflation. Inflation was lowest in the 1950s, when money
growth was lowest. It was also highest in the 1970s, when money growth was highest.
The link is not perfect, because real GDP and velocity grew at different rates during
these two decades. However, years of economic research have revealed that sustained
increases in money growth will, indeed, lead to inflation.
The links between money growth and inflation are particularly dramatic when
money growth is extremely high. But what leads countries to vast increases in their
money supply? We ll explore that next.
HYPERINFLATION
The inflation rates observed in the United States in the last 40 years are insignificant
compared to some of the inflation rates around the world throughout history.
Economists call very high inflation rates
over 50 percent per month, which is
approximately 13,000 percent per year
hyperinflation. One of the first hyperinfla-
tion studies was conducted by Phillip Cagan of Columbia University in the 1950s.

Greece, Hungary, and Russia are three countries that have experienced hyperin-
flation. According to the data in Table 16.3, for a period of one year, Greece had a
monthly inflation rate of 365 percent. A monthly inflation rate of 365 percent means
the price level rises by a factor of 4.65 each month. If the price level rises by 4.65, its
percent increase is
To get a sense of what a 365 percent inflation rate means, suppose we had inflation
of this magnitude in the United States. At the beginning of the month, $1 could
buy a large order of french fries. Because prices are rising by a factor of 4.65 each
month, by the end of the month it would take $4.65 to buy the same order of
french fries, and $1 by the end of the month would be worth only 21.5 cents
(1/4.65 = 0.215, or 21.5 cents). After two months, a dollar would be worth only
4.6 cents (0.215 * 0.215 = 0.046). Suppose this inflation continues month after
month. After one year, a dollar bill would be worth only 1 millionth of 1 cent! In
hyperinflations, money doesn t hold its value very long.
In Hungary after World War II prices rose by 19,800 percent each month. The
hyperinflation in Russia in the early 1920s seems moderate by comparison: Prices

there rose by only 57 percent per month. However, hyperinflations have also
occurred in recent times. Table 16.4 presents data on three hyperinflations during
the 1980s
in Bolivia, Argentina, and Nicaragua, all averaging about 100 percent
per month.

seignorage
Revenue raised from money creation.
On the basis of the quantity theory, we suspect these hyperinflations must have all
been caused by money growth. You can see this in the data. For example, in Greece,
the monthly inflation of 365 percent was accompanied by money growth of 220 per-
cent. In Hungary, the monthly inflation of 19,800 percent was accompanied by money
growth of 12,200 percent.
The value of money deteriorates sharply during hyperinflations and no longer
serves as a good store of value. In these extreme circumstances, we would expect
people wouldn t want to hold money very long but would immediately try to spend
it. In other words, the velocity of money should increase sharply during hyperinfla-
tions. This is precisely what happens. The last column of Table 16.3 shows how
velocity increases during hyperinflations. In the hyperinflation in Greece, velocity
increased by a factor of 14. In the hyperinflation in Hungary, velocity increased by a
factor of 333.
During hyperinflations, money doesn t facilitate exchange well. Because prices
are changing so fast and unpredictably, there is typically massive confusion about
the true value of commodities. Different stores may be raising prices at different
rates, so the same commodities may sell for radically different prices. People spend
all their time hunting for bargains and the lowest prices, a process that becomes very
costly in human terms. Hyperinflation also means people have less time to produce
goods and services. No country can easily live very long with a hyperinflation. The
government must take swift measures to end a hyperinflation before it completely
destroys the economy.
How Budget Deficits Lead to Hyperinflation
If the cause of hyperinflations is excessive money growth, why do governments allow
the money supply to grow so fast, risking economic catastrophe? The answer lies in
the way some governments finance their deficits
the gap between government
spending and revenues.
A government must cover its deficit in some way. If a government wants to spend
$1,000 but is collecting only $800 in taxes, where can it get the needed $200? One
option is to borrow the $200 by selling government bonds
IOUs
to the public. In
the future, the government will have to repay the $200 in bonds plus the interest the
public earns on them. Another alternative is to create $200 of new money. All govern-
ments have the ability to run the printing presses and come up with $200 in new cur-
rency. The revenue raised from money creation is called seignorage. In principle,
governments can do a combination of both
selling bonds and printing money
as
long as the deficit is covered:
government deficit = new borrowing from the public + new money created

343
PART 6
Now we are in a position to understand how hyperinflations originate. Consider
Hungary after World War II. The country s economy was destroyed by the war,
and its citizens were demanding government services. The government had limited
ability to collect taxes because of the poor state of the economy, but it gave in to the
demands from its citizens for spending at levels that far exceeded what it could col-
lect. The result was a large deficit. Then the government faced a problem: How
would it finance this large deficit? No individuals or governments wanted to buy
bonds or IOUs from Hungary (lend it money) because the country s economy was
in such bad shape that prospects for repayment in the near future were grim.
Unable to borrow, Hungary resorted to printing money at a massive rate. The
result was hyperinflation.
A more recent example of a devastating hyperinflation occurred in Zimbabwe,
beginning in 2007. What were the causes of this hyperinflation?
To end hyperinflation, governments must eliminate their budget deficits by either
increasing taxes, cutting spending, or both. This, of course, will cause some economic
pain, but there is no other remedy. Once the deficit has been cut and the government
stops printing money, the hyperinflation will end. Without money growth to feed it,
hyperinflation will quickly die of starvation.
Economists who emphasize the role the supply of money plays in determining
nominal income and inflation are called monetarists. The most famous monetarist
was Milton Friedman, who studied complex versions of the quantity equation and
explored the role of money in all aspects of economic life. Friedman had many influ-
ential students, such as Phillip Cagan, who is best known for his work on hyperinfla-
tions (see Table 16.3). Friedman and Cagan, along with other monetarist economists,
pioneered research on the link between money, nominal income, and inflation.
During the 1960s, little attention was being paid to the role of money in determining
aggregate demand. The work of Friedman and other monetarists was extremely influ-
ential in changing the opinions of economic thinkers at that time. Moreover, the mon-
etarists were also insistent that, in the long run, inflation was a monetary problem.
Today, most economists agree with them that, in the long run, inflation is caused by
growth in the money supply.

HYPERINFLATION IN ZIMBABWE
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: What caused a severe hyperinflation to
emerge recently in Zimbabwe?
In June 2008 the consumer price index in Zimbabwe was 8 million percent higher
than it was a year before. A $12 lunch in local currency cost 1.1 trillion Zimbabwe dol-
lars. What caused Zimbabwe to suffer from this crippling hyperinflation?
The simple answer is that the political and economic system began to self-
destruct. Zimbabwe has been ruled since 1980 by the dictator Robert Mugabe,
whose policies to intervene militarily in African conflicts and expropriate white-
owned farms had the cumulative effect of crippling the economy. As the economy
deteriorated, tax revenues declined, as well as export revenues necessary to pur-
chase imported fuel. To pay soldiers to help keep him in power, to bribe his sup-
porters, and to keep the government functioning, Mugabe and his central bank
simply resorted to printing new banknotes. The result was hyperinflation and fur-
ther deterioration of the economy as the financial system collapsed.

In this chapter, we explored
the role expectations of infla-
tion play in the economy and
how societies deal with infla-
tion. Interest rates, as well as
changes in wages and prices,
both reflect expectations of
inflation. These expectations depend on the past history of
inflation and on expectations about central bank behavior. To
reduce inflation, policymakers must increase actual unemploy-
ment above the natural rate of unemployment. We also looked
at the ultimate causes of hyperinflations. Here are the key
points to remember from this chapter:
1 In the long run, higher money growth leads to higher infla-
tion and higher nominal interest rates.
2 A decrease in the growth rate of money will initially lead to
higher real-interest rates and higher nominal-interest
rates. In the long run, real rates return to their original
level; nominal rates are permanently lower because of
reduced inflation.
3 The rate of inflation increases when actual unemployment
falls below the natural rate of unemployment; the rate of
inflation decreases when actual unemployment exceeds the
natural rate of unemployment. Economists explain this rela-
tionship using the expectations Phillips curve.
4 How the public forms expectations of inflation and the time
frame in which it must form them are important factors in
understanding the behavior of inflation and unemployment.
Sometimes the public uses rules of thumb to form expecta-
tions; other times it may use rational expectations.
5 Monetary policymakers need to be cautious about the state-
ments and pronouncements they make because what they
say can influence inflation expectations. Conservative central
bankers can dampen expectations of inflation.
6 The quantity equation and the growth version of the quantity
equation show how money, velocity, and nominal income are
related. The simple quantity equation is
7 Governments sometimes create new money to finance large
portions of their budget deficits. Raising funds through print-
ing money is known as seignorage. When governments do
this excessively, the result is hyperinflation. Stopping hyper-
inflation requires closing the government deficit and reduc-
ing money creation.

inflation. Moreover, it should credibly promise to con-
tinue this inflation policy into the future. The result,

higher GDP growth. Krugmans recommendation was
based on the distinction between real and nominal
interest rates. Can you explain his logic?

nal return of 8 percent on a savings deposit, the tax rate
is 30 percent, and the inflation rate is 6 percent, what is
the after-tax rate of return?

If inflation increases less than expected, the actual
unemployment rate will be

The increase in the fraction of young people in the
labor force that occurred when the baby-boom gener-
ation came of working age tended to

In the late 1980s, as unemployment fell below the nat-
ural rate, inflation

2.5
Targeting the Natural Rate? Because the natural
rate of unemployment is the economists  notion of
what constitutes full employment,  it might seem
logical for the Fed to use monetary policy to move
unemployment toward its natural rate. However,
many economists believe such a policy would be
unwise because the natural rate may shift over time
and policymakers may misjudge the correct rate.
What would happen if the Fed targeted a 5 percent
unemployment rate but the true natural rate were
6 percent?
2.6
Explaining a Movement in the Inflation Rate. In
Figure 16.1 you can see that inflation rose between
1988 and 1989 with little change in the unemploy-
ment rate. Can you explain why?
2.7
Hysteresis and the Natural Rate of Unemployment.
In economics the term hysteresis  means that the his-
tory of the economy has a lingering effect on current
economic performance. Using this idea, explain why a
deep recession could lead to an increase in the natural
rate of unemployment. Which demographic groups do
you think would be affected the most?
2.8
Oil Price Changes, Vacancies, and the Natural
Rate. During the mid-1970s, changes in oil prices
required products to be produced by different types of
firms in different locations. This raised the number of
vacancies relative to the unemployment rate. According
16.2
to the theory of William Dickens, how did this affect
the natural rate of unemployment? (Related to
Application 1 on page 336.)

Public Pronouncements and Fed Officials. In
addition to political and institutional factors, public
pronouncements also affect the credibility of the
Fed. When Alan Blinder, a Princeton University pro-
fessor of economics, was appointed vice-chair of the
Federal Reserve in 1994, he gave a speech to a group
of central bankers and monetary policy specialists. In
that speech, he repeated one of the lessons in this
chapter: In the long run, the rate of inflation is inde-
pendent of unemployment and depends only on
money growth; in the short run, lower unemploy-
ment can raise the inflation rate. Blinder s speech
caused an uproar in the financial press. Some com-
mentators attacked him as not being sufficiently vigi-
lant against inflation. Use the idea of credibility to
explain why an apparently innocent speech would
create such a reaction. (Related to Application 2 on
page 339.)
3.6
Pay Incentives for Fed Officials? In the private
sector, the pay of executives is typically tied to the
performance of their company. Could this work in
the public sector as well? Suppose pay for the chair-
man of the Federal Reserve is tied to the price of
long-term bonds. That is, if bond prices rise, the
chairman receives a bonus, but if they fall, the chair-
man s salary will decrease. Would this provide a cred-
ible incentive for the chairman to keep inflation low?
(Hint: Think of the links between inflation, interest
rates, and bond prices.) Do you see any disadvantages
to this proposal?
3.7
Buying Gold to Protect Against Inflation.
Consider the following statement: Since gold is a
commodity and prices of commodities by definition
increase with inflation, buying gold will protect me
from any inflationary increases.  Can you point out a
possible problem with buying gold to protect yourself

Inflation and the Velocity of Money

The velocity of money is defined as 
income divided by the supply of money.
4.2
The quantity equation links money, velocity, real
income, and

4.3
If we know the growth of velocity, income, and the
money supply, we can explain the 
rate.

If the growth of the money supply is 4 percent a year,
velocity decreases by 1 percent, and there is no growth
in real output, the inflation rate equals

4.5
Velocity and ATMs. Suppose the introduction of
ATMs led households to hold less of their wealth as
deposits in banks or savings and loans. How would this
affect measured velocity?
4.6
Using the Quantity Equation. If the growth rate of
money is 10 percent per year, annual inflation is 7 per-
cent, and the growth rate of velocity is 1 percent per
year, what is the growth rate of real output?
4.7
Velocity of Money in the United States. Using the

Hyperinflation

borrow from the public or create

5.2
During hyperinflations the velocity of money tends to

Economists call inflation hyperinflation  when the
inflation rate exceeds 
percent per month.
5.4
Hyperinflations cannot occur unless the growth rate of
is very high.

Hyperinflation and Barter. Some economists and
journalists noticed that during Zimbabwe s hyperinfla-
tion, the economy was turning to a barter economy.
Why do you think this would occur? (Related to

Money Illusion
Economists say that people suffer from money illusion if
their behavior is influenced by nominal changes that are also
not real changes. Consider the following scenarios and be
prepared to discuss them in class.
a. Erin bought an antique clock for $100. Two years later,
Betsy bought an identical clock for $121. Meanwhile,
there had been inflation each year of 10 percent. Both
Erin and Betsy sold their clocks to other collectors. Erin
sold hers for $130, and Betsy sold hers for $133. Who
profited more from her transaction?
b. Bob and Pete are traders in classic comic books. A year
ago, Bob and Pete each bought the same comic book for
$10. Bob sold his a couple of days later for $20. Pete

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
Economists are often cautious and try to warn 
policymakers that carrying out effective economic
policy is difficult. But politicians must ultimately make
decisions. As we learned in Chapter 1, President Harry S.
Truman made the following observation about his cau-
tious economists: All my economists say, On the one
hand, . . . ; On the other hand, . . .  Give me a one-
handed economist!
Decisions about government spending, taxes, deficits,
interest rates, and exchange rates may seem very abstract,
but they directly affect our lives. Poor economic policies
can lead to the virtual collapse of countries. Policymaking
therefore requires prudence. Of course, it is always very
easy to criticize politicians in power when something goes
wrong. In another famous quote, Truman recognized that
decision making is not easy. Before air conditioning was
commonplace, he was known to have remarked, If you
can t stand the heat, get out of the kitchen.

CHAPTER 17
MACROECONOMIC POLICY DEBATES
348
A
s a student and citizen, you are inevitably drawn into economic debates. In
most cases, the debates are complex because they involve a mixture of facts,
theories, and opinions. Value judgments play a large role in economic debates.
Your views on the proper role of tax policy, for example, will depend on whether you
believe low-income earners should receive a higher share of national income. Your
views on the size of government will depend on whether you believe individuals or the
government should play a larger role in economic affairs.
In previous chapters, you learned the basic vocabulary of economics and studied
different theories of the economy. Now you are ready to examine some of the key pol-
icy issues in macroeconomics. In this chapter, we will focus on three macroeconomics
issues that are the subject of much debate:
Should we balance the federal budget?
Should the Fed target inflation or pursue other objectives?
Should we tax consumption rather than income?
SHOULD WE BALANCE THE FEDERAL BUDGET?
Before we begin to consider answers to the question Should we balance the federal
budget?  let s review some terms from Chapter 10: Government expenditures include
goods and services purchased by the government and transfer payments, such as
Social Security and welfare, made to citizens. A surplus occurs when the govern-
ment s revenues exceed its expenditures in a given year. The government runs a
deficit when it spends more than it receives in revenues from either taxes or fees in
a given year.
The government debt is the total of all its yearly deficits. For example, if a govern-
ment initially had a debt of $100 billion and then ran deficits of $20 billion the next
year, $30 billion the year after that, and $50 billion during the third year, its total debt
at the end of the third year would be $200 billion: the initial $100 billion debt plus the
successive yearly deficits of $20 billion, $30 billion, and $50 billion. If a government
ran a surplus, it would decrease its total debt. For example, suppose the debt were
$100 billion and the government ran a surplus of $10 billion. With the surplus, the
government would buy back $10 billion of debt from the private sector, thereby
reducing the remaining debt to $90 billion.
In this chapter, we focus on the government debt held by the public, not the total
federal debt, which includes debt held by other governmental agencies. Sometimes
popular accounts in the press or on the Web highlight the total federal debt. However,
the debt held by the public is the best measure to assess the burden the federal debt
can have on the economy.
The Budget in Recent Decades
The fiscal picture for the United States has changed substantially over the last
30 years. Beginning in the 1980s and through most of the 1990s, the federal budget
ran large deficits
deficits as far as the eye can see,  as David Stockman, the director
of the Office of Management and Budget in President Reagans administration, put it.
What Stockman could not see at that point, however, was what would occur in the late
1990s. In fiscal year 1998, during President Clintons administration, the federal gov-
ernment ran a budget surplus of $69 billion
its first surplus in 30 years. It continued
to run surpluses for the next 3 fiscal years as well.
The surplus emerged for two key reasons. First, economic growth was very rapid
and tax revenues
including tax revenues from the sales of stocks and bonds
grew
more quickly than anticipated. Second, federal budget rules were in place that limited
total spending.

Debt as a Percent of GDP, 1791 2009
The nation s debt/GDP ratio tends to rise sharply during wars because more spending is needed to
finance them. However, the ratio also can rise during peacetime, as it did during the Reagan presi-
dency in the 1980s.
SOURCES: Congressional Budget Office, The Long-Term Budget Outlook,  December 2003, and yearly updates.
When President George W. Bush took office in January 2001, the large
surplus led him to propose substantial tax cuts. Bush and Congress then passed a
10-year tax cut amounting to $1.35 trillion over the course of the decade.
Although the tax cuts were large, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) esti-
mated at that time that the federal government would nonetheless continue to run
surpluses through 2010.
The CBO noted that, as a result of these federal government surpluses, the out-
standing stock of federal debt held by the public would be reduced. Because GDP
would be growing over this period, the stock of debt relative to GDP, which is the
standard way to measure the effect of debt in an economy, would also decline. The
CBO estimated that in 2011, the ratio of debt to GDP would fall despite Bush s tax
cuts, in part because the tax cuts were set to expire in 2010. Figure 17.1 depicts the
debt/GDP ratio from 1791 to 2009. As you can see, except for a period in the 1980s
typically the ratio rises sharply during wars and the Great Depression and falls dur-
ing peacetime. With neither a war nor a recession looming on the horizon in early
2001, the CBO predicted that the debt/GDP ratio would be relatively low by the
end of the decade.
Unfortunately, a series of events intervened to bring deficits back into the picture
and prevent the debt/GDP ratio from falling. The fight against terrorism led to
higher spending on homeland security and military spending as wars were launched in
Afghanistan and Iraq. The Bush tax cuts, the collapse of the stock market twice during
the decade, the recessions that began in 2001 and 2007, and the housing bust mid-
decade all sharply reduced tax revenues. President Obama s stimulus package in 2009
added new tax cuts and additional spending, which fueled the deficit. The federal gov-
ernment ran a budget deficit of approximately $1.3 trillion in fiscal year 2010, a far cry

from the surpluses in the late 1990s. You can see from the last few years of Figure 17.1
that the debt-to-GDP ratio has recently risen. Current projections by the CBO sug-
gest that the debt-to-GDP ratio will increase even when the economy resumes a nor-
mal level of economic growth.
Five Debates about Deficits
As we have seen, federal budgets are affected by a wide range of factors, including
wars, demographic pressures, recessions, and the choices our politicians make on
spending and taxes. But what principles should guide policymakers? Should they
cut spending and raise taxes to reduce the national debt over time? Or does the
level of the national debt really matter? Let s take a look at the debates over the
national debt.
DEBATE 1: DO DEFICITS LEAD TO INFLATION?
If a government is spending
$2,000 but collecting only $1,600 in taxes, where does it get the $400 needed to fill the
gap? One option is to borrow $400 from the public in return for government bonds,
which are, in effect, IOUs. In the future the government would have to pay back the
$400 plus any interest on the bonds. Another way to cover the gap is simply to create
$400 worth of new money. In principle, governments could use a mix of borrowing
money and creating money, as long as the total covers its deficits:
In the United States, the Treasury Department issues government bonds to
finance the deficit. The Federal Reserve has the option of buying existing govern-
ment bonds, including those newly issued by the Treasury Department. If the
Federal Reserve does purchase the government s bonds, the purchase creates money
by taking debt out of the hands of the public in exchange for money. Economists call
the purchase by a central bank of newly issued government debt monetizing the
deficit. If governments finance deficits by creating new money, the result will be
inflation. In the United States, we normally finance only a very small portion of our
deficits by creating money. For example, between 2005 and 2006 the Federal
Reserve purchased only $34 billion in government bonds of approximately $330 billion
issued by the Treasury during that period. The Fed sold the remainder to the public.
However, during the financial crisis, the Fed engaged in massive purchases in securi-
ties, adding over a trillion dollars to its balance sheet. However, by paying interest
on reserves, it induced banks to hold matching excess reserves and thus prevented
the money supply held by the public from increasing. This prevented inflation
from emerging.
If a country has no options other than creating money to finance its deficits
in other words, if the public is unwilling to buy its bonds, as was the case in
Hungary following World War II
those deficits will inevitably cause inflation. As
we discussed in Chapter 16, hyperinflations occur when economies run large
deficits and monetize them. Germany and Russia after World War I, Bolivia and
Argentina in the 1980s, Russia in the 1990s, and most recently Zimbabwe are just
some of the countries that, in addition to Hungary, have endured massive inflations
because they monetized their deficits. However, large, stable countries like the
United Kingdom, the United States, and Japan don t monetize much of their debt
because they are able to borrow from the public. In these countries, deficits do not
lead inevitably to inflation.
DEBATE 2: IS GOVERNMENT DEBT A BURDEN ON FUTURE GENERATIONS?
The national debt, another commonly used term for total government debt, can
impose two different burdens on society, both of which fall on the shoulders of future
generations. First, a large debt can reduce the amount of capital in the economy and
thereby reduce future income and real wages for its citizens. Here s how.
government deficit = new borrowing from the public +  new money created
monetizing the deficit
Purchases by a central bank of newly
issued government bonds.

351
PART 6
The savings of individuals and institutions flow into capital formation and increase
an economys capital stock. For example, when savers purchase new stocks and bonds,
the companies issuing them use the proceeds to invest in plants and equipment.
When the government runs a deficit and increases its national debt, it also
finances its spending by selling bonds to these same savers, who might hold both
types of assets in, say, their retirement portfolios. Further, let s say that the total
amount that the public can save is fixed at $1,000. If the government needs to
finance a $200 deficit and does so by selling new bonds, then only $800 in savings is
available to invest in private companies. The selling of $200 in government bonds to
finance the deficit therefore crowds out  $200 that could have been raised by pri-
vate companies.
The result of government deficits is that less savings are available to firms for
investment. This illustrates one of our basic principles in economics.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  O P P O R T U N I T Y  C O S T
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
As we discussed in earlier chapters, reduced saving and investment will ultimately
reduce the stock of private capital, the building of new factories, and the purchasing of
equipment to expand production and raise GDP. As a result, there will be less capital
deepening. With lower capital per worker, real incomes and real wages will be lower
than they otherwise might have been. The government deficit (caused by increased
spending or decreased taxes) comes at a cost in the future.
Governments can spend the proceeds of borrowing on investments, such as pro-
ductive infrastructure
in this case, future real wages and incomes will not be
adversely affected. With productive investment, government deficits will not be a bur-
den on society.
Second, a large national debt will mean that higher taxes will be imposed on
future generations to pay the interest that accumulates on the debt. Just like your col-
lege loans, the bill eventually comes due
even for the national debt.
Sometimes you hear that these interest payments are not a real burden because
we owe the national debt to ourselves.  This is a misleading argument for several rea-
sons. First, we don t owe the interest payments only to ourselves. In 2009, approxi-
mately 52 percent of U.S. public debt was held by foreigners. Second, a high
proportion of the debt is held by older, wealthy individuals or by institutions, but the
taxes levied to service it will be paid by everyone in the United States.
Some economists do not believe that government deficits, resulting in govern-
ment debt, impose a burden on a society. These economists believe in Ricardian
equivalence, the proposition that it does not matter whether government expendi-
ture is financed by taxes or financed by issuing debt. This idea is named after David
Ricardo, a nineteenth-century classical economist. To understand the case for
Ricardian equivalence, consider the following example. A government initially has
a balanced budget. It then cuts taxes and issues new debt to finance the deficit left
by the reduction in taxes. Everyone understands the government will have to raise
taxes in the future to service the debt, so everyone increases savings to pay for the
taxes that will be increased in the future. If saving rises sufficiently, the public
everyone
will be able to purchase the new debt without reducing the funds they
invest in the private sector. Because net investment doesn t decline, there will be no
debt burden.
As you can see, Ricardian equivalence requires that savings by the private sector
increase when the deficit increases. Do savers behave this way? It is actually difficult to
provide a definite answer, because we must take many other factors into account in
any empirical studies of savings. It appears, however, that during the early 1980s, sav-
ings decreased somewhat when government deficits increased. This is precisely the
opposite of what Ricardian equivalence predicts. As long as Ricardian equivalence

whether government expenditure is

DEBATE 3: HOW DO DEFICITS AFFECT THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT?
Nobel
Laureate James Buchanan has argued that people are less aware of government deficits
than of the taxes they re forced to pay. Therefore, financing government expenditures
through deficits, rather than through higher taxes, will inevitably lead to higher gov-
ernment spending and bigger government. Although this argument may seem plausi-
ble, it presents two problems. First, in recent U.S. history, spending by state and local
governments has grown much faster than federal spending. However, state and local
governments face many more restrictions when it comes to borrowing money than
the federal government faces. For example, many states require legislators to run a
balanced budget. Deficit spending isn t allowed. Second, if politicians trying to get
reelected really prefer higher government spending and deficits to higher taxes and
surpluses, why did the federal government run surpluses in the late 1990s?
Some research suggests politicians can use deficits strategically to actually reduce
the growth of government. During the 1980s, for example, the government ran large
deficits caused by a combination of a deep recession and major tax cuts. The deficits
subsequently made it difficult for other politicians to propose new spending programs.
Proponents of smaller government, therefore, may wish to cut taxes to reduce sur-
pluses or increase deficits in order to make it more difficult for other politicians to
increase government spending. These deficit proponents want to create deficits to
does not fully hold true, its reasonable to assume the government debt imposes a bur-
den on society. Nonetheless, many economists believe using the deficit as the sole
measure of a societys future burdens doesn t tell the whole story. These economists
believe we should look at broader measures that take into account long run promises
of the federal government.
From an international perspective, the United States does not have the largest
government debt measured relative to GDP. Figure 17.2 depicts the percentage of
debt to GDP for several developed countries. By this measure, Japan has the most
serious public debt problem.

353
PART 6
prevent Congress from having too much money to be able to spend. Some congress-
men supported President Bush s tax cut in 2001, which reduced the surplus over a
10-year period, precisely for this reason.
DEBATE 4: CAN DEFICITS BE GOOD FOR AN ECONOMY?
Recall from the
fiscal policy chapter that during a downturn, running a deficit helps stimulate private-
sector spending. Consequently, the government may deliberately run a deficit to pull
the economy out of a recession. The deficit the government creates puts additional
income into the hands of the public. With more money, people don t have to drasti-
cally cut their consumption spending. Because total spending in the economy does not
fall as much, the severity of the recession is lessened.
Deficits automatically emerge during recessions, which also stabilize the econ-
omy. Recall how automatic stabilizers work. As incomes fall during a recession, so
do tax payments. Moreover, transfer payments such as welfare and food stamps rise.
Because government spending increases while tax revenues fall, the deficit must, of

NEW METHODS TO MEASURE THE LONG-TERM FISCAL
IMBALANCES FOR THE UNITED STATES
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: What are the long-term fiscal imbalances for
the United States?
Even though federal budget-deficit projections have increased sharply in recent years,
they still don t accurately portray the long-run fiscal problems facing the United
States. As the population ages, life expectancies increase, and health-care costs con-
tinue to grow, expenditures on Social Security and Medicare are expected to increase
significantly, too. Although payroll taxes today exceed expenditures, in the not-too-
distant future these taxes will fall far short of anticipated expenditures. Over time,
there will be an escalating gap between revenues and expenditures, which will have to
be met by outright borrowing.
How can we measure the size of the gap? Economists Jagadeesh Gokhale of the
Cato Institute and Kent Smetters of the University of Pennsylvania have developed a
more comprehensive measure of a nations indebtedness. The method includes esti-
mating the present value of the gap between the government s revenues and expendi-
tures and adding it to the current national debt.
In 2005 Gokhale and Smetters calculated this new total measure, which they call
the fiscal imbalance,  as approximately $63 trillion, or 5 times GDP. This is a huge
number. Even during World War II, government debt was only 1.2 times GDP. In the
long run, a fiscal imbalance of this size is not sustainable
no one will lend the U.S.
government that amount of money. Eliminating these imbalances will require dra-
matic increases in taxes or reduced expenditures. To maintain the current level of ben-
efits, workers and firms would have to pay nearly 30 percent in payroll taxes
about
double what they pay today
or income taxes would have to nearly double.
Alternatively, benefits programs could be scaled back.
Gokhale and Smetters estimate that about 80 percent of the fiscal imbalance will
stem from Medicare
which pays the rising health-care costs for the elderly. What
these numbers suggest is that our current health-care system for retirees will need to
undergo fundamental reform to make it more sustainable. Otherwise, the United
States will need to radically increase taxes to meet the shortfall.

course, rise. However, a rising deficit may be what it takes to steer the economy back
to full employment. Automatic stabilizers were clearly in evidence in the recession
that began in late 2007, as tax revenues fell sharply for the next several years.
The existence of automatic stabilizers and the use of expansionary fiscal policy
during recessions suggest that we should not worry about short-run government
deficits. Over short time periods, deficits can help the economy to cope with shocks,
such as oil price increases or a collapse in the stock market. They give the government
some room to maneuver out of a recession. Most economists believe automatic stabi-
lizers reduced economic fluctuations during the twentieth century.
Deficits can also play a role in tax smoothing. Suppose there is a large, temporary
increase in government spending, as might occur during a war. The government could
either finance the war by running a deficit and issuing debt or by increasing tax rates
to keep the budget in balance. Professor Robert Barro of Harvard University has
argued that it is more efficient to keep tax rates relatively constant than to raise them
sharply and then lower them later. Temporarily raising tax rates to very high levels
could cause distortions in economic behavior that we would like to avoid. Thus, by
running deficits and only gradually raising taxes later to service the debt, we avoid cre-
ating excess distortions in the economy.
DEBATE 5: WOULD A BALANCED-BUDGET AMENDMENT REALLY WORK?
For many years, there were strong efforts to enact a Constitutional amendment to bal-
ance the federal budget. As recently as 1995, Congress came very close to passing a
balanced-budget amendment, sending it back to the states for ratification. The
amendment passed in the House of Representatives but failed by a single vote in the
Senate. How would a balanced-budget amendment actually work?
Many different budgetary constitutional amendments have been proposed. They all
require that, after a phase-in period, Congress propose in each fiscal year a budget in
which total revenues (excluding borrowing) cover total expenditures. The amendments
also have various escape clauses
for example, to allow borrowing during wartime. Some
amendments also allow Congress to suspend the requirement to balance the budget for
other reasons, such as during a recession when deficits naturally emerge. Finally, some
versions would limit the rate of spending increases to the rate at which GDP is growing.
Proponents of the balanced-budget amendment say it will finally exert discipline
on the federal government, preventing large deficits in peacetime, such as those that
occurred in the 1980s. With a balanced budget we could be sure to avoid the negative
effects of deficits: reduced capital formation and tax burdens that are shifted onto
future generations.
Critics of a balanced-budget amendment point to many different problems, such
as the following:
A balanced budget may not allow enough flexibility, or room, for the govern-
ment to effectively deal with recessions. Under some versions of the amend-
ment, unless three-fifths of Congress votes to suspend requirements, the
government would have to cut expenditures or raise taxes during a recession.
This would make the recession worse and limit the ability of the government to
use fiscal policy to stabilize the economy.
The Constitution is not the right mechanism to try to enforce complicated bud-
get rules. As various interested parties challenge the actions of Congress, the
courts would become heavily engaged in federal budget matters.
Congress could devise special budgets to get around the requirement, for exam-
ple, by taking some types of spending off budget,  which means simply not
counting them as part of the official budget.
Congress could also find nonbudgetary ways to carry out the policies that it
desires. For example, it could issue more regulations or impose mandates or
requirements on businesses or other governments to carry out its will. These
regulations or mandates could be even more costly to the economy than
added deficits.

PART 6
SHOULD THE FED TARGET INFLATION OR
PURSUE OTHER OBJECTIVES?
In previous chapters we looked at the various roles that the Federal Reserve can play.
Monetary policy can be used to stabilize the real economy, preventing unemployment
from exceeding the natural rate or falling too far below the natural rate. As we saw in
Chapters 13 and 14, the Fed also plays a critical role as a lender of last resort and a
unique resource to combat financial crises.
On the other hand, we also learned that, in the long run, money was neutral and
monetary policy cannot affect the real level of output or unemployment. We also saw
that the natural rate can shift over time, making it difficult to target the appropriate
unemployment rate. In these circumstances, what should the Fed do? Should it just
focus on inflation or try to follow some other rule or procedure to balance concerns of
inflation and unemployment?
In the early years of the first decade of the twenty-first century, the rate of infla-
tion had fallen to between 1 and 2 percent. Some economists thought the time was
right for the Fed to concentrate on simply keeping the inflation rate low and stable. In
other words, they thought the Fed should use monetary policy to target  an appro-
priate inflation rate and make its primary objective keeping inflation in check.
Following the expansion of the Feds activities during the financial crisis of 2008 and
its aftermath, there is continuing concern about long-run inflation.
In recent years, various inflation-targeting methods have been adopted in a num-
ber of developed countries, including Canada, the United Kingdom, New Zealand,
Sweden, Australia, and Spain. In addition, many developing countries have found
that inflation targeting increased the autonomy of their central banks, helping them
fight inflation.
Two Debates about Inflation Targeting
Inflation targeting has had many strong proponents. Lets take a close look at two key
debates about this topic.
DEBATE 1: SHOULD THE FED FOCUS ON ONLY INFLATION?
We have learned
that in the long run monetary policy can influence only the level of prices, not the level
of employment. Proponents of inflation targeting argue that the Fed should have only
one primary goal: controlling inflation. Having it worry about other factors
unemployment or the exchange rate
will, they say, distract it from its mission and
lead to long-run inflationary pressures building in the economy. Moreover, if the Fed
were committed to the single goal of controlling inflation, its credibility would be
enhanced. As we have seen, if the Fed is credible, the private sector will become more
responsive to changes in monetary policy. For example, long-term interest rates will
become more responsive to changes in short-term rates if the public understands what
the Feds motives are and what it is doing. And credible policies may actually decrease
the need for active monetary policies. Having a single goal would also help to keep the
Fed free of political pressures. Such political pressures might include attempts by one
political party or the other to stimulate the economy or give financial markets a tempo-
rary boost before an election.
Other proponents of inflation targeting hold a somewhat less rigid view.
Although they believe fighting inflation should be the primary objective of the Fed,
or of a central bank, they believe an inflation-targeting regimen could be designed
to give the central bank some flexibility. For example, the central bank could be
required to target a broader range of inflation
say, between 1 and 3 percent
and
meet the target several years in the future. Under either of these alternatives, central
banks would have some room to meet employment or other policy objectives
besides just inflation. In practice, many countries do allow some wiggle room  in
their inflation targeting regimens by using broad inflation bands or distant targets.

CHAPTER 17
MACROECONOMIC POLICY DEBATES
356
Before he took over as chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2006, Ben Bernanke was
an advocate for inflation targeting. While he was a member of the Board
of Governors in 2003, Bernanke gave a speech outlining his own views on the mer-
its of inflation targeting. For Bernanke, inflation targeting increased the effective-
ness of monetary policy because it provided a long-term anchor for inflation
expectations. As long as the private sector
individuals and firms
understood the
Fed was holding firm to long-run inflation targets, it would have added flexibility to
use aggressive monetary policy in the short run to offset adverse shocks to the
economy
without upsetting long-run inflation expectations. Bernanke called infla-
tion targeting a policy of constrained discretion. Under inflation targeting, the Fed
could take actions to offset shocks to real output or to the financial system, but it
had to keep its long-run inflation targets in clear view. After the financial crisis of
2008, Bernanke stopped speaking about inflation targeting and devoted his speeches
to explaining the Fed s actions during the crisis and designing an exit strategy  for
the Fed s massive interventions.
Even prior to the recent recession, many economists disagreed with the idea of
inflation targeting because they strongly objected to the Fed concentrating solely on
controlling inflation. In the United States, Congress and the president are frequently
incapable of quickly agreeing on a fiscal policy to stave off or end a recession. Of
course, automatic fiscal stabilizers exist, but they are often not sufficient to cushion
the economy when a shock hits. Practically speaking, only monetary policy is available
to stabilize output and prevent deep recessions from emerging. If monetary policy is
geared solely toward controlling inflation, as inflation-targeting proponents would

WOULD A POLICY RULE HAVE PREVENTED THE
HOUSING BOOM?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: Did the Federal Reserve cause the housing
boom through excessively loose monetary policy?
John Taylor from Stanford University has argued that the Feds easy money  policy
from mid-2001 through 2004 was largely responsible for the housing boom in the
decade that ultimately caused so much financial damage. Taylor used his own model of
monetary policy
the Taylor rule
to analyze the Feds behavior. In his prior work,
he demonstrated that the Fed s behavior could be closely described by a model that
allowed for some monetary policy tightening and easing in response to output move-
ments. Applying this model to the decade of 2000, however, Taylor found that, com-
pared to past experience, the Fed was much too aggressive in lowering interest rates.
Interest rates fell from 2 percent in mid-2001 to 1 percent by 2004. Past experience,
however, would have suggested that the Fed would have raised interest rates to 4 per-
cent by 2004
a very significant deviation.
Taylor then showed that housing starts
which are very sensitive to interest
rates
would have been much lower if the Fed had not followed its easy money pol-
icy. The boom and bust would have been avoided. Finally, as an additional piece of
evidence, Taylor looked at the experiences of European countries. There the same
phenomenon occurred. Countries that deviated most from the Taylor rule
for
example, Spain
experienced the worst boom and bust cycles for housing.

PART 6
like, and if fiscal policies are difficult for Congress and the president to pass, that
leaves the government no other tools to fight a recession.
Economists also debate the level for an inflation target. Suppose there were gen-
eral agreement that the ultimate goal should be total price stability
that is, zero
inflation. There would still be legitimate questions about what constitutes stable
prices. It is very difficult to measure changes in prices accurately when there is a great
deal of technological change occurring in the economy, because technological
improvements change the quality of goods so rapidly that government statisticians
can t easily catch up with them. If, as many economists believe, our price indexes over-
state the true inflation rate, annual inflation of 2 percent may in reality be true price
stability. Indeed, many proponents of inflation targeting agree with this point and rec-
ommend a 2 percent inflation rate as price stability.
Critics of stabilization policy, of course, believe that not using monetary policy
to try to stabilize the economy would actually improve our economic performance.
In their view, attempts to stabilize the economy have done more harm than good
over the years by making fluctuations worse. In previous chapters, we discussed the
difficulties in conducting stabilization policy. These include lags, uncertainties
about the strength and timing of policies, and difficulties in estimating the natural
rate of unemployment. If you believe these difficulties are insurmountable, you will
likely think the Fed should target just inflation. If you think they can be overcome,
you will likely believe the Fed should be allowed to stabilize output and employ-
ment, too.
Some economists like the idea of the Fed having to meet targets, but they have
suggested alternatives to inflation targeting. One approach that has wide appeal was
developed by economist John Taylor of Stanford University. Taylor suggested that the
Fed follow a rule that keeps a long-run inflation target but allows the Fed to raise or
lower interest rates depending on whether output is above or below potential. His
own analysis suggests that the performance of the Fed would be superior if it followed
a rule of this type, rather than making ad hoc decisions. The advantage of a rule of this
nature is that it allows the Fed to offset shocks to the economy, but requires the Fed to
meet long run inflation targets.
DEBATE 2: IF THERE WERE AN INFLATION TARGET, WHO WOULD SET
IT?
Even if the United States decided to adopt inflation targeting as a policy, several
important questions would remain. Perhaps the most important is Who would set
the target?
In the United Kingdom, which adopted targeting in 1992, the elected govern-
ment decides on the inflation target for the central bank. These elected officials typi-
cally specify a range for the inflation rate that the bank must meet. The central bank
participates in the discussions and has an opportunity to present its views to the pub-
lic through its publications and published minutes of its meetings. But ultimately it is
the elected government that makes the final decision.
In other countries, the central bank has even more influence in setting the infla-
tion target. In New Zealand, for example, the central bank has the responsibility of
achieving and maintaining stability in the general level of prices  without any com-
peting goals, such as stabilizing employment or output. The law also requires the
head of the central bank and the finance minister to negotiate inflation goals and
make them public.
What would be an appropriate arrangement for the United States? Under current
law, the Fed chairman reports regularly to Congress, but the Fed has considerable
power to use monetary policy to stabilize output as well as to fight inflation as it
pleases. Would our Congress and president be willing to cede power to the Fed and
allow it to focus only on fighting inflation? And, if they did, would Congress or the
president want to determine the target range for inflation and instruct the Fed how
quickly to meet these targets?
As you can see, changing our current system would require major decisions
about who has authority and control over our economic system. Currently, the Fed

CHAPTER 17
MACROECONOMIC POLICY DEBATES
358
has considerable power and autonomy. Although inflation targeting might make the
Fed more independent, another phenomenon could occur, too: Congress and the
president might end up with more power over monetary policy. And that might lead
to more inflation, not less.
SHOULD WE TAX CONSUMPTION RATHER
THAN INCOME?
As we discussed in earlier chapters, the United States is a country with a low saving
rate. This hurts our long-run growth prospects because our investment spending is
determined by our own savings and savings from abroad. Many factors
not purely
economic ones
contribute to our low saving rate. For example, colleges generally
give less financial aid to students whose families have saved for their education. Many
of our welfare programs cut the benefits of families who have saved in the past and still
have some funds left in their accounts. The U.S. tax system also discourages savings.
Heres how.
In the United States, you must pay taxes on both the wages you earn and the
earnings you make on your savings. Suppose you earn $100 at your job and you
have a tax rate of 20 percent. That means you keep $80 after taxes. Now suppose
you save $50 of that money and invest it at 10 percent. At the end of one year, you
will have earned an additional $5 on the $50 you saved (10% * $50), but you will
get to keep only $4 of it because the government will take $1 in taxes (20% * $5).
So, you will have to pay the government $21 in total: $20 on the $100 you earned
in wages, plus $1 on the $5 you earned on your savings. If you did not save at all,
you would pay only $20 in taxes, not $21.
Not all tax systems work this way. Tax systems based on consumption do not
penalize individuals who save. Sales taxes in the United States and value-added taxes
abroad are familiar examples of consumption taxes. It is also possible to create a
consumption tax from an income tax by not taxing the earnings on savings
just as
we do with tax-exempt bonds issued by state and municipal governments. Or, as an
alternative, the government could allow savings to be deducted from gross income
before the calculation for total taxes owed is made. The key feature of consumption
taxation is that you do not face any additional taxes if you decide to save more of
your income.
There are, however, ways in the United States to save money and still limit your
taxes. In addition to buying tax-exempt bonds, you can invest in an IRA (individual
retirement account) or 401(k), 403(b), and Keogh plans, which are also types of retire-
ment accounts. The money in pension funds is treated similarly. It isn t taxed until the
person who contributed it retires and withdraws it. During retirement, most people
earn less money than when they were working, so the tax rate they pay on the money
they withdraw from these accounts is lower than when they saved it. Also, the money
accumulates more quickly because it grows tax-free while it s in these accounts. In
practice, the U.S. tax system is a hybrid system, part way between an income tax and a
consumption tax.
Two Debates about Consumption Taxation
Proponents claim that taxes based on consumption will increase total savings and may
even be more equitable. Let s explore these claims.
DEBATE 1: WILL CONSUMPTION TAXES LEAD TO MORE SAVINGS?
There is
no question that taxing consumption instead of savings creates an incentive to save.
However, theres no guarantee the incentive will actually result in more money saved
in the economy. Suppose the tax burden is shifted to consumption by reducing the tax
rate on savings. People will want to take advantage of this incentive and reduce their
17.3

income, of individuals.

359
PART 6
consumption and increase their saving. On the other hand, people will also want to
spend more because, with the tax cut, they are wealthier.
Although there has been much research done on how a consumption tax would
affect savings, the results are far from conclusive. It is true that individuals will allocate
their savings to tax-favored investments over investments that are not favored. For
example, they will put money into their IRAs. What is not clear is whether the funds
they will put there are literally new savings
meaning reduced consumption
or
merely transfers from other accounts, such as conventional savings accounts, which do
not have the same tax advantages. Untangling these effects is a difficult issue, and it
remains an active area of ongoing research.
The tax system imposed on corporations in the United States also creates disin-
centives to save and invest. Suppose you purchase a share of stock in a corporation.
When the corporation earns a profit, it pays taxes on the profit at the corporate tax
rate. When the corporation pays you a dividend on the stock out of the profits it earns,
you must pay taxes on the dividend income that you receive. Corporate income is
taxed twice, in other words
first when it is earned by the corporation and again when
it is paid out to shareholders.
Some economists have argued that the corporate taxes lead to less-efficient
investment because they result in capital flowing into other sectors of the economy
(into real estate, for example) that do not suffer from double taxation. For this reason,
in 2003 Congress passed a bill introduced by President Bush that lowered
but did
not eliminate
taxes on corporate dividends.
DEBATE 2: ARE CONSUMPTION TAXES FAIR?
The basic idea behind a con-
sumption tax seems fair. Individuals should be taxed on what they take away from the
economy s total production
that is, what they consume
not on what they actually
produce. If an individual produces a lot but does not consume the proceeds from
what was produced and instead plows it back into the economy for investment, that
individual is contributing to the growth of total output and should be rewarded, not
punished. Individual A earns $50 and consumes it all; individual B earns $100 but
consumes only $40. Who should pay more?
In practice, moving to a consumption-tax system could have a major impact on
the distribution of income in the economy. Suppose we simply exempted the returns
from savings from the income tax. This exception would clearly favor wealthy and
high-income individuals who save the most and earn a lot of income in interest, divi-
dends, rents, and capital gains. Table 17.1 shows estimates based on the capital gains
received by different income classes for the year 2009 and dividends paid by corpora-
tions. Capital gains are the profits investors earn when they sell stocks, bonds, real
estate, or other assets. As you can see, taxpayers with annual incomes exceeding
$1,000,000 earned over half of the economys capital gains over this period. Obviously,
capital assets are highly concentrated among the wealthy.

CHAPTER 17
MACROECONOMIC POLICY DEBATES

If capital gains and other types of capital income were not taxed, total tax rev-
enue would fall, and the government would have to raise tax rates on everyone to
maintain the same level of spending. Excluding capital income from taxation does
have its costs.
Some economists believe it is important that high-income individuals continue
to pay a significant share of total taxes. In the last several decades, the distribution of
income has become more unequal, as superstar athletes, famous actors and musi-
cians, CEOs, and successful entrepreneurs and investors have all earned large for-
tunes. The tax system is one way we have to at least partially reduce inequalities in
income. Critics of consumption taxes worry that moving our tax system in that
direction will take away this important tool for social equality. However, other econ-
omists believe that high-income individuals already shoulder a very high share of
the total tax burden and that we need to focus on designing an efficient system to
promote economic growth.
Proponents of consumption taxes have tried to meet the challenge of fairness in
different ways. The flat tax  designed by Robert E. Hall of Stanford University and
Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institute brings the personal income tax and corporate
income tax into a single, unified tax system. Under the flat tax, one low, single tax rate
applies to both businesses and individuals. Businesses deduct their wage payments
before they pay taxes. In addition, they can deduct any investment spending they make
from their income before the tax is calculated. Recall that in a simple economy, with-
out government or the foreign sector, saving equals investment, S = I. Allowing a
deduction for investment has generally the same effect as allowing a deduction for sav-
ings. So this flat tax is a type of consumption tax.
This version of the flat tax has an important feature that ensures that wealthy
individuals (and other owners of corporations) still pay taxes. Suppose the corporation
or business makes an extraordinary return on its investment. Consider, for example,
the tremendous profit generated by Apples iPod. Over 14 million iPods were shipped
in fiscal year 2006. If the profit for each iPod were $100, Apple s total profit from

IS A VAT IN OUR FUTURE?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Can the United States adopt a European-
style value-added tax?
Virtually all developed countries and many developing countries have a value-
added tax, commonly known as a VAT. The United States is a prominent excep-
tion. The VAT is essentially a sales tax that is levied on each stage of production.
Firms pay the VAT on their sales and then receive a credit for VAT paid on their
purchases. Unlike a sales tax, the VAT is embedded in the price of goods. It is
rebated when goods are exported but imports are required to pay the VAT. Rates
on the VAT can be high
for example, the basic rate in the United Kingdom is
17.5 percent.
The VAT has some important advantages. It is relatively easy to collect and, as
a consumption tax, does not penalize savings. There are some potential difficulties.
Since U.S. states already levy retail sales taxes, incorporating a VAT at the state
level could be difficult and be seen to impinge on state taxing authority. In addi-
tion, some conservatives worry that it is too efficient and consumers will not notice
all the taxes they pay. Liberals worry that the VAT, like all consumption taxes,
could be regressive. An old joke goes that the time will come for the VAT when lib-
erals recognize it is a money machine and conservatives recognize it is regressive.

In this chapter we explored
three topics that are the center
of 
macroeconomic 
policy
debates today. Here are the
key points to remember:
1 A deficit is the difference
between the governments cur-
rent expenditures and revenue.
The government debt is the
sum of all past yearly deficits.
2 Deficits can be financed through either borrowing or money
creation. Financing deficits through money creation is called
monetizing the deficit. It leads to inflation.
3 Deficits can be good for the country. Automatic stabilizers
and expansionary fiscal policy both work through the cre-
ation of deficits.
4 The national debt incurs two burdens on citizens: It can
reduce the amount of capital in an economy, leading to lower
levels of income; it can also result in higher taxes that future
generations will have to pay.
5 A number of developed countries have recently changed
their monetary policy to emphasize targeting the inflation
rate or a range for the inflation rate.
6 Although targeting inflation can increase the credibility of a
central bank, it does limit the tools left for active stabiliza-
tion policy.
7 A consumption tax would increase the incentives for private
saving. However, it is not clear that total savings would nec-
essarily increase, and there would be concerns about the fair-
ness of this form of taxation.

ratio? How do these ratios compare to the same
ratios in the United States today? To what period
in U.S. history does the debt/GDP ratio in

Government Debt. The gap between taxes and
spending, excluding interest on the debt, is known as
the primary surplus. Suppose there is $100 million of
iPods would be $1.4 billion. Under this version of the flat tax, these extraordinary
gains would be taxed in full. Owners of a corporation or business may earn extraordi-
nary gains, but if they do, they will pay taxes on them.
The projected federal deficit has led many policymakers to consider whether a
European-style value-added tax (VAT) would make sense for the United States.
Grafting a VAT on to the U.S. fiscal system would pose many challenges.

to zero to stabilize the price level. An adverse supply

the Federal Reserve should follow strict rules for the
conduct of monetary policy. These rules would
require the Fed to make adjustments to interest rates
based on information that is fully available to the pub-
lic, information such as the current unemployment
rate and the current inflation rate. Essentially, they
would put the Fed on autopilot and remove its discre-
tion. What are the pros and cons of such an approach?

What Difference Would Focusing on Asset Prices
Make? Suppose you believed the Fed should make its
decisions by focusing partly on asset prices, such as
stocks or prices of housing, and should have used mon-

Trade, Consumption, and Inequality
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
Countries always want to have foreign markets open for
their exporters. But if a country limits access to its own mar-
kets, foreign countries may take action to limit access to their
own markets. The United States, despite an overall strong
record in trade, is no exception. Here are a few examples.
As part of the North American Free Trade Agreement,
the United States was required to open its borders to trucks
from Mexico, although it resisted allowing this. As a result,
in 2009 Mexico imposed tariffs on over $2 billion of U.S.
goods, reducing employment in U.S. export industries.
In 2010 the United States accused China of selling alu-
minum products below their fair market value and imposed
sanctions on the Chinese. In turn, China decided that the
United States was doing precisely the same thing with nylon
products and imposed its own tariffs on these products.
Trade agreements can help lower barriers to interna-
tional commerce, but countries still have to believe that
other countries are playing fair. Otherwise, two can tango.

A
s the world economy grows, U.S. policies toward international trade become
ever more important. Many people view trade as a zero-sum game.  They
believe that if one country gains from international trade, another must lose.
Based on this belief, they advocate restricting trade with other countries. The United
States does restrict trade to protect U.S. jobs in many sectors, such as those in the
apparel and steel industries. One lesson from this chapter is that free trade could make
all countries better off. The challenge for government officials is to create policies
that accomplish, or come close to accomplishing, this goal.
In this chapter, we discuss the benefits of international trade and the effects of
policies that restrict trade.
BENEFITS FROM SPECIALIZATION AND TRADE
What if you lived in a nation that could produce everything it consumed and didn t
depend on any other country for its economic livelihood? If you were put in charge of
your nation, would you pursue a policy of national self-sufficiency? Although self-
sufficiency might sound appealing, it would actually be better for your country to spe-
cialize in the production of some products and then trade some of those products to
other countries. You saw in Chapter 3 that specialization and exchange can make both
parties better off. In this chapter, we use a simple example to explain the benefits of
specialization and international trade between two nations.
Let s say there are two nations, Shirtland and Chipland. Each nation produces
computer chips and shirts, and each consumes computer chips and shirts. Table 18.1
shows the daily output of the two goods for the two nations. In a single day, Shirtland
can produce a maximum of either 108 shirts or 36 computer chips, whereas Chipland
can produce a maximum of either 120 shirts or 120 computer chips. The last two rows
of the table show the opportunity costs of the two goods. Recall the principle of oppor-
tunity cost.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  O P P O R T U N I T Y  C O S T
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
In Chipland, the trade-off between shirts and chips is one to one: The opportu-
nity cost of one shirt is one chip, and the opportunity cost of one chip is one shirt. In
Shirtland, people can produce three times as many shirts as chips in a given amount of
time: The opportunity cost of one chip is three shirts. Conversely, the opportunity
cost of one shirt is one-third of a chip.

Production Possibilities Curve
The production possibilities curve shows the combination of two goods that can be produced with a
nation s resources. For Chipland, the trade-off between the two goods is one to one. For Shirtland,
the trade-off is 3 shirts for every computer chip. In the absence of trade, Shirtland can pick point c

possible combinations of products that an economy can produce, given that its pro-
ductive resources are fully employed and efficiently used. This curve, which we dis-
cussed in Chapter 2, provides a menu of production options. To keep things simple,
we assume the curve is a straight line, indicating a constant trade-off between the two
goods. As shown by Shirtland s production possibilities curve in Figure 18.1, the fol-
lowing combinations of chips and shirts are possible:
1 All shirts and no chips: point a. If Shirtland uses all its resources to produce shirts,
it will produce 108 shirts per day.
2 All chips and no shirts: point d. If Shirtland uses all its resources to produce chips,
it will produce 36 chips per day.
3 Equal division of resources: point b. Shirtland could divide its resources between
shirts and chips to produce 54 shirts and 18 chips each day.
All the other points on the line connecting points a and d are also feasible. One
option is point c, with 28 chips and 24 shirts. The steepness of the curve s slope
negative 3.0
shows the opportunity cost of computer chips: 1 chip per 3 shirts.
Figure 18.1 also shows the production possibilities curve for Chipland. Chipland can
daily produce 120 shirts and no chips (point e), 120 chips and no shirts (point g), or
any combination of chips and shirts between these two points. In Chipland, the
trade-off is 1 shirt per computer chip: The opportunity cost of 1 chip is 1 shirt, so the
slope of the production possibilities curve is negative 1.0.
Each nation could decide to be self-sufficient, picking a point on its production
possibilities curve and producing everything it wants to consume. For example,

367
PART 7
Shirtland could pick point c, daily producing 28 chips and 24 shirts, and Chipland
could pick point f, daily producing 60 chips and 60 shirts. In the language of interna-
tional trade, this is a case of autarky, or self-sufficiency (in Greek, aut means self  and
arke means to suffice ).
Comparative Advantage and the Terms of Trade
Would the two nations be better off if each specialized in the production of one good
and traded with the other nation? To decide which nation should produce a particular
good, we need to look at each good and figure out which nation has the lower oppor-
tunity cost of producing it. As you saw in Chapter 3, the nation with the lower oppor-
tunity cost has a comparative advantage in producing that good. As we emphasized in
Chapter 3, it is comparative advantage that matters for trade
not absolute advantage,
the ability of a nation to produce a particular good at a lower absolute cost than that of
another nation. Let s see how it works.
1 Chips produced in Chipland.
The opportunity cost of one chip is one shirt in
Chipland, and the opportunity cost of one chip is three shirts in Shirtland. Chipland
has a comparative advantage in the production of chips. Because Chipland sacrifices
fewer shirts to produce one chip, Chipland should produce chips.
2 Shirts produced in Shirtland.
The opportunity cost of one shirt is one chip in
Chipland, and the opportunity cost of one shirt is one-third of a chip in
Shirtland. When it comes to producing shirts, Shirtland has a comparative
advantage because it sacrifices fewer chips to produce one shirt. Shirtland should
therefore produce shirts.
Trade will make it possible for people in each specialized nation to consume both
goods. At what rate will the two nations exchange shirts and chips? To determine the
terms of trade, the rate at which units of one product can be exchanged for units of
another product, let s look at how much Shirtland is willing to pay to get one chip and
how much Chipland is willing to accept to give up one chip.
1 To get one chip, Shirtland is willing to pay up to three shirts. Thats how many
shirts it would sacrifice if it produced its own chip. For example, if the nations
agree to exchange two shirts per chip, Shirtland could rearrange its production,
producing one fewer chip but three more shirts. After exchanging two of the
newly produced shirts for one chip, Shirtland will have the same number of chips
but one additional shirt.
2 To give up one chip, Chipland is willing to accept any amount greater than one
shirt. For example, if the nations agree to exchange two shirts per chip, Chipland
could rearrange its production, producing one more chip and one fewer shirt.
After it exchanges the newly produced chip for two shirts, Chipland will have the
same number of chips but one additional shirt.
The potential for mutually beneficial trade between the two countries is possible
because the willingness to pay
three shirts by Shirtland
exceeds the willingness to
accept
one shirt by Chipland. It s possible for Shirtland and Chipland to split the dif-
ference between the willingness to pay and the willingness to accept, exchanging two
shirts per chip. This will actually make both countries better off in terms of the total
amount of goods they can consume. We ll see why next.
The Consumption Possibilities Curve
A nation that decides to specialize and trade is no longer limited to the options
shown by its own production possibilities curve. The consumption possibilities
curve shows the combinations of two goods (computer chips and shirts in our
terms of trade
The rate at which units of one product can
be exchanged for units of another product.

another nation.
Figure 18.2 shows the consumption possibilities curve for our two nations, assum-
ing that they exchange two shirts per chip:
In Panel A, Chipland specializes in chip production, the good for which it has a
comparative advantage. It produces 120 chips and no shirts (point g). Given the
terms of trade, Chipland can exchange 40 of its 120 chips for 80 shirts, leading
to point h. At point h, Chipland can consume 80 chips and 80 shirts.
In Panel B, Shirtland specializes in shirt production. It produces 108 shirts and
no chips (point a). Given the terms of trade, it can exchange 80 of its 108 shirts
for 40 chips, leading to point k on its consumption possibilities curve. Shirtland
can consume 28 shirts and 40 chips.

Consumption Possibilities Curve
The consumption possibilities curve shows the combinations of computer chips and shirts that can
be consumed if each country specializes and trades. In Panel A, Chipland produces 120 chips and
trades 40 of these chips to Shirtland for 80 shirts. In Panel B, Shirtland produces 108 shirts and
trades 80 of these shirts to Chipland for 40 chips. The trade allows each nation to consume more.
How do the outcomes with specialization and trade compare to the autarky out-
comes? Chipland moves from point f (autarky) to point h, so trade increases the con-
sumption of each good by 20 units. Shirtland moves from point c to point k, so this
nation consumes 12 additional chips and 4 additional shirts.
In Figure 18.2, each consumption possibilities curve lies above the nations pro-
duction possibilities curves, meaning each nation has more options about how much
to consume under specialization and trade. In most cases, a nation picks a point on the
consumption possibilities curve that provides more of each good. Of course, this is a
very simple example. In the actual world market, many countries produce and trade
many goods. The marketplace determines what the terms of those trades will be,
depending upon supply, demand, and pricing.
How Free Trade Affects Employment
You ve now seen that trade allows each nation to consume more of each good. But
we haven t yet discussed the effects of trade on employment. Under free trade, each
nation will begin to specialize in a single good, causing considerable changes in the

369
PART 7
country s employment in different industries. In Chipland, the chip industry dou-
bles in size
output increases from 60 to 120 chips per day
while the shirt industry
disappears. Workers and other resources will leave the shirt industry and move to
the chip industry. In Shirtland, the flow is in the opposite direction: Workers and
other resources move from the chip industry to the shirt industry.
Is free trade good for everyone? Switching from self-sufficiency to specialization
and trade increases consumption in both nations, so on average, people in each nation
benefit from free trade. But some people in both nations will be harmed by free trade.
In Chipland, for example, people in the shirt industry will lose their jobs when the
shirt industry disappears. Some workers can easily move into the expanding computer
chip industry. For these workers, free trade is likely to be beneficial. However, other
shirt workers will be unable to make the move to the chip industry and will be forced
to accept lower-paying jobs or face unemployment. Free trade is likely to make these
displaced workers worse off. There is a saying, Where you stand on an issue depends
on where you sit.  In our example, a worker sitting at a sewing machine in Chipland is
likely to oppose free trade because that worker is likely to lose a job. A worker sitting
at a workstation in a computer chip fabrication facility is likely to support free trade
because the resulting increase in computer chip exports will generate more employ-
ment opportunities in that industry.
PROTECTIONIST POLICIES
Now that you know the basic rationale for specialization and trade, we can explore the
effects of public policies that restrict it. All the restrictions we explore limit the gains
from specialization and trade. We will consider four common import-restriction policies:
an outright ban on imports, an import quota, voluntary export restraints, and a tariff.
Import Bans
To show how an import ban affects the market, lets start with an unrestricted market
no import ban. Figure 18.3 shows the market for shirts in Chipland, a nation with a
comparative advantage in producing computer chips, not shirts. The domestic supply

Effects of an Import Ban
In the free-trade equilibrium, demand intersects the total supply curve at point c, with a price of $12
and a quantity of 80 shirts. If shirt imports are banned, the equilibrium is shown by the intersection of
the demand curve and the domestic supply curve (point a). The price increases to $23.

curve shows the quantity of shirts supplied by firms in Chipland. Looking at point b,
we see that Chipland firms will not supply any shirts unless the price is at least $17 per
shirt. The total supply curve for shirts, which shows the quantity supplied by both
domestic firms and foreign firms (in Shirtland), lies to the right of the domestic supply
curve. At each price, the total supply of shirts exceeds the domestic supply because for-
eign firms supply shirts, too. Point c shows the free-trade equilibrium. The demand
curve from domestic residents intersects the total supply curve at a price of $12 per
shirt and a quantity of 80 shirts. Because this price is below the minimum price for
domestic firms, domestic firms produce no shirts, and all the shirts in Chipland are
imported from Shirtland.
What will happen if Chipland bans imported shirts? Foreign suppliers will disap-
pear from the shirt market, so the total supply of shirts will be the domestic supply. In
Figure 18.3, point a shows the equilibrium when Chipland bans imported shirts: The
domestic demand curve intersects the domestic supply curve at a price of $23 per shirt
and a quantity of 60 shirts. In other words, the decrease in supply resulting from the
import ban increases the price consumers have to pay for shirts and decreases the
quantity available for them to buy.
Quotas and Voluntary Export Restraints
An alternative to an import ban is an import quota
a government-imposed limit on
the quantity of a good that can be imported. An import quota is a restrictive policy
that falls between free trade and an outright ban: Imports are cut, but not eliminated.
For example, if a quota were put on shirts, the price consumers would have to pay
would fall somewhere between the price they would pay with free trade ($12 per shirt,
as in our example) and the price they would pay if imported shirts were banned
($23 per shirt). Where exactly the price would fall would depend on how high or low
the quotas are.
Import quotas are illegal under international trading rules. To get around these
rules, an exporting country will sometimes agree to a voluntary export restraint
(VER). VERs are similar to import bans. When an exporting nation adopts a VER, it
decreases its exports to avoid having to face even more restrictive trade policies
importing countries might be tempted to impose on them. Although VERs are legal
under global-trade rules, they violate the spirit of international free-trade agreements.
In any case, quotas and VERs have the same effect. Like a quota, a VER increases the
price of the restricted good, making it more feasible for domestic firms to participate
in the market.
Figure 18.4 shows the effect of an import quota or VER. Starting from the free-
trade equilibrium at point c, an import quota will shift the total supply curve to the left:
At each price there will be a smaller quantity of shirts supplied because foreign suppli-
ers aren t allowed to supply as many. The total supply curve when there is an import
quota or VER will lie between the domestic supply curve and the total supply curve
under free trade. The equilibrium under an import quota or VER occurs at point d,
where the demand curve intersects the total supply curve under an import limitation.
The $20 price per shirt with the import quota exceeds the $17 minimum price of
domestic firms, so domestic firms supply 22 shirts (point e). Under a free-trade policy,
they would have supplied no shirts.
A quota or a VER produces winners and losers. The winners include foreign and
domestic shirt producers. In our example, foreign firms can sell shirts at a price of $20
instead of $12 each, and the price is high enough for domestic firms to participate in
the market. This generates benefits for the firms and their workers. The losers are
consumers, who pay a higher price for shirts. In some cases, the government issues
import licenses to some citizens, who can then buy shirts from foreign firms at a low
price, such as $12, and sell the shirts at the higher domestic price, $20. Because import
licenses provide profits to the holder, they are often awarded to politically powerful

firms or individuals. Moreover, because they are so valuable, some people may bribe
government officials to obtain them.
We know consumers pay higher prices for goods that are subject to protectionist
policies, but how much more? Here is one example. In the United States, voluntary
export restraints on Japanese automobiles in 1984 increased the price of a Japanese car
by about $1,300 and the price of a domestic car by about $660.1

Market Effects of a Quota, a VER, or a Tariff
An import quota shifts the supply curve to the left. The market moves upward along the demand

point with a tariff that shifts the total supply curve to the same position.
A P P L I C AT I O N 1
THE IMPACT OF TARIFFS ON THE POOR
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: Do tariffs (taxes) on imported goods hurt the
poor disproportionately?
Economists have found that tariffs in the United States fall most heavily on lower-
income consumers. In the United States, tariffs are very high on textiles, apparel
items, and footwear. These goods represent a higher fraction of the consumption of
lower-income households than higher-income households. For example, footwear
accounts for 1.3 percent of the expenditure of lower-income households, as compared
to 0.5 percent for higher-income households.
Moreover, even within these categories of goods for which tariffs are high, the
highest tariffs fall on the cheapest products
precisely those that will be purchased by
lower-income consumers. For example, low-price sneakers face a 32 percent tariff
whereas expensive track shoes face only a 20 percent tariff. In general, to protect U.S.
industries, tariffs are highest on labor-intensive goods; goods that use relatively more
labor than capital. But these goods tend to be lower priced. That is why tariffs do fall
disproportionately on the poor.

CHAPTER 18
INTERNATIONAL TRADE AND PUBLIC POLICY
372
An alternative to a quota or a VER is an import tariff, which is a tax on an
imported good. Tariffs have the same effect as quotas and VERs. We know from our
earlier discussions that a tax shifts the supply curve to the left and increases the equi-
librium price. In Figure 18.4, suppose the tariff shifts the total supply curve with free
trade so that it intersects the domestic demand curve at point d. In other words, we
reach the same point we reached with the quota: Consumers pay the same $20 price
per shirt, and domestic firms produce the same quantity (22 shirts).
There is one fundamental difference between a quota and a tariff. An import
quota allows importers to buy shirts from foreign suppliers at a low price
say,
$12 per shirt
and sell them for $20 each, the artificially high price. In other words,
importers make money from the quota. Under a tariff, the government gets the
money, collecting $8 per shirt from foreign suppliers. Citizens in Chipland will prefer
the tariff to the quota because the government can use the revenue from the tariff to
cut other taxes or expand public programs.
In the real world, tariffs can have major effects. One trade expert estimated that
cutting industrial tariffs by 50 percent would increase the output of the world s econ-
omy by $270 billion per year. Similar easing of tariffs on agricultural products would
cut the world s food bill by $100 billion.2
Tariffs also appear to disproportionately affect the poor.
Responses to Protectionist Policies
A restriction on imports is likely to lead to further restrictions on trade. For example,
if Chipland bans shirt imports, Shirtland might retaliate by banning computer chips
from Chipland. A trade war of this sort could escalate to the point where the two
nations return to self-sufficiency. If this happens, the two countries would be forced to
scale back their consumption. We can see that by looking back at Figure 18.2:
Chipland will move from point h to point f, and Shirtland will move from point k to
point c. This sort of retaliatory response is common. Because it is, we know that pro-
tecting one industry in a nation is likely to harm that nations other exports. Chiplands
shirt industry, if protected from imports, may grow, but it will be at the expense of its
computer-chip industry.
Many import restrictions have led to retaliatory policies and substantially lessened
trade. The most famous was the Smoot-Hawley Tariff Act of 1930. When the United
States increased its average tariff on imports to 59 percent, its trading partners retali-
ated with higher tariffs on U.S. products. The resulting trade war reduced interna-
tional trade and deepened the worldwide depression of the 1930s.
The threat of retaliatory policies may persuade a nation to loosen its protectionist
policies. For example, in 1995 the United States announced it would impose 100 per-
cent tariffs on Japanese luxury cars if Japan didn t ease its restrictions on imported
auto parts. Just hours before the tariffs were to take effect, the two nations reached an
agreement that was expected to increase the sales of U.S. auto parts to Japanese firms.
In 2002, President Bush imposed tariffs on steel. However, when faced with the threat
of retaliatory policies in Europe, he ended the sanctions in 2003.
Import restrictions also create an incentive to smuggle goods. The restrictions
create a gap between the cost of purchasing the restricted goods abroad and the price
goods can be sold for in the protected economy, so there is a profit to be made.
WHAT ARE THE RATIONALES FOR
PROTECTIONIST POLICIES?
Why would a government impose protectionist policies such as an import ban, quota,
VER, or tariff? We ll look at three possible reasons:
1 To shield workers from foreign competition
18.3
tariff
A tax on imported goods.

373
PART 7
2 To nurture infant industries until they mature
3 To help domestic firms establish monopolies in world markets
To Shield Workers from Foreign Competition
One of the most basic arguments for protectionism is that it shields workers in
industries that would be hurt by trade. Suppose, relative to the United States,
nations in the Far East have a comparative advantage in producing textiles. If the
United States were to reduce existing tariffs on textiles, domestic manufacturers
could not compete. They would have to close their factories and lay off workers. In
an ideal world, the laid-off workers would take new jobs in other sectors of the
economy. In practice, this is difficult. Many workers don t immediately have the
skills to go to work in other sectors, and obtaining those skills takes time. Moreover,
the textile industry is heavily concentrated in the southeastern part of the United
States. Politicians from that region will try to keep tariffs in place to prevent tempo-
rary unemployment and changes in employment patterns in their areas
they have
an incentive to protect their own constituents, even though it may cause major eco-
nomic losses for the economy. The result of this protection will be less-efficient
production, higher prices, and lower consumption for the United States. How much
does it cost to protect a job?
To Nurture Infant Industries until They Mature
During World War II the United States built hundreds of boats, called Liberty ships,
for the navy. As more and more of these ships were built, each required fewer hours to
complete because workers acquired knowledge during the production process and got
better at it. Engineers and economists call this phenomenon learning by doing. To
learn a new game, such as Ping-Pong, you learn by doing. At first, you may find it dif-
ficult to play, but your skills improve as you go along.
Tariffs and other protectionist policies are often defended on the grounds that
they protect new or infant industries that are in the early stages of development and
can benefit from learning by doing. A tariff shields a young industry from the compe-
tition of its more mature rivals. After the infant industry grows up,  the tariff can
eventually be eliminated because the industry is able to compete. In practice, infant
industries rarely become competitive with their foreign rivals. During the 1950s and
1960s, many Latin American countries used tariffs and other policies to protect their
young manufacturing industries from foreign competition. Unfortunately, the domes-
tic industries never became as efficient as foreign suppliers, and the Latin American
countries that tried this policy suffered. Another problem with protecting an infant
industry is that once a government gives an industry tariff protection, it is difficult to
take that protection away. More generally, even some established companies also com-
plain about unfair competition,  but this concept does not always make sense.
To Help Domestic Firms Establish Monopolies in World Markets
If the production of a particular good requires extremely large economies of scale, the
world market will support only a few, or perhaps just one, firm. In this case, a nation
might be tempted to adopt policies to ensure a company within its borders will end up
being the world monopolist. Suppose the commercial aircraft industry can support
only one large firm. If two firms enter the industry, both will lose money. A nation
could agree to provide financial support to a domestic firm to guarantee the firm will
make a profit. With such a guarantee, the domestic firm will enter the industry.
Knowing this, a foreign firm will be reluctant to enter, so the domestic firm will cap-
ture the monopoly profit. The country where the successful firm is located will bene-
fit from higher production and more jobs for its citizens.

One famous example is Airbus, an airplane-manufacturing consortium in Europe
that competes with the U.S. firm Boeing. Several European countries provided large
subsidies for the firms producing the Airbus line of planes. These subsidies allowed
the consortium firms to underprice their rivals in the United States, and at least one
U.S. manufacturer of commercial airplanes was forced out of business.
What could go wrong with these monopoly creation policies? First, if both nations
subsidize their domestic firms, both firms will enter the market and lose money. The
taxpayers in both countries will then have to pay for the subsidies. Second, a nation
may pick the wrong industry to subsidize. Together, the British and French subsidized
an airplane known as the Concorde, which flew at supersonic speeds, rapidly shuttling
passengers between Europe and the United States. Although the Concorde captured
the market, the market was not worth capturing. The venture lost money because the
Concorde was very costly to develop and fly, and few people were willing to pay a large
premium for supersonic travel. The Concorde stopped flying in 2003. Finally, the sub-
sidized firm may not perform well. As an example, in 2006, Airbus was facing severe
problems with its planes and losing business to its competitor, Boeing.
A BRIEF HISTORY OF INTERNATIONAL
TARIFF AND TRADE AGREEMENTS
Today, the average U.S. tariff is 4.6 percent of the value of imported goods, a rate
close to the average tariffs in Japan and most European nations but very low by
historical standards. When the Smoot-Hawley tariffs were implemented in the

PROTECTION FOR CANDLE MAKERS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: Does the concept of unfair  competition
make sense?
In response to the spread of protectionism, the French economist Frédéric Bastiat
(1801 1850) wrote the following fictitious petition, in which French candle makers
asked for protection from unfair  competition:
We are suffering from the intolerable competition of a foreign rival, placed, it would seem, in a
condition so far superior to ours for the production of light, that he absolutely inundates our national
market at a price fabulously reduced. The moment he shows himself, our trade leaves us
all of our
customers apply to him; and a branch of native industry, having countless ramifications, is all at
once rendered completely stagnant. This rival 
 is none other than the sun.
What we pray for is, that it may please you to pass a law ordering the shutting up of all windows,
sky-lights, dormer windows, curtains, blinds, bull s eyes; in a word all openings, holes, chinks, clefts,
and fissures, by or through which the light of the sun has been in use to enter houses, to the prejudice
of the meritorious manufactures with which we 
 have accommodated our country
a country
which, in gratitude, ought not to abandon us now.
Does it not argue to the greatest inconsistency to check as you do the importation of coal, iron, cheese,
and goods of foreign manufacture, merely because 
 their price approaches zero, while at the same
time you freely admit, and without limitation, the light of the sun, whose price is during the whole
day at zero?

1930s, the average U.S. tariff was a whopping 59 percent of a product s price.
Tariffs are lower today because several international agreements subsequently
reduced them.
The first major international trade agreement following World War II was the
General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT). This agreement was initi-
ated in 1947 by the United States and 23 other nations and now has over 149 mem-
bers. Nine rounds of GATT negotiations over tariffs and trade regulations have
taken place, resulting in progressively lower tariffs for the member nations. The
last completed set of negotiations, the Uruguay round (1994), decreased tariffs by
about one-third of the previous level. In 1995, the World Trade Organization
(WTO) was formed to enforce GATT and other international trade agreements.
Under GATT s most favored nation provision, a country that reduces tariffs for
one nation must do so for all members of GATT. This provision helps reduce tar-
iffs throughout the world.
The most recent round of trade negotiations began in Doha, Qatar, in 2001 but
collapsed in 2008. This round was billed as an attempt to benefit developing countries
that exported agricultural goods. The idea was that reductions in subsidies and tariffs
on agriculture goods in developed countries would promote exports of agriculture
goods for developing countries. In turn, developed countries wanted lower tariffs for
industrial goods in developing countries. Why did the negotiations fail? One reason
was that China and India, rapidly growing countries each with populations over a bil-
lion, were more interested in promoting their industrial bases than their agricultural
exports. Perhaps a second reason was that previous trade negotiations had been suc-
cessful, leaving less room for grand bargains  that would motivate all countries to
embrace new agreements.
If global negotiations do no work, what alternatives are there? In addition to the
large group of nations in the WTO, other groups of nations have formed trade asso-
ciations to lower trade barriers and promote international trade. Here are some of the
best-known agreements:
The North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) took effect in 1994 and
was implemented over a 15-year period. It eliminates all tariffs and other trade
barriers between Canada, Mexico, and the United States.
The European Union (EU) was designed to remove all trade barriers within
Europe and create a single market. Initially, the EU consisted of just six coun-
tries: Belgium, Germany, France, Italy, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands.
Denmark, Ireland, and the United Kingdom joined in 1973; Greece in 1981;
Spain and Portugal in 1986; and Austria, Finland, and Sweden in 1995. In
2004, the biggest ever enlargement took place with 10 new countries joining
the EU.
The leaders of 18 Asian nations have formed an organization called Asian
Pacific Economic Cooperation (APEC). In 1994, APEC signed a nonbinding
agreement to reduce trade barriers among these nations.
The

America
Free
Trade
Agreement
(DR-CAFTA) promotes trade liberalization between the United States, the
Dominican Republic, and five Central American countries: Costa Rica, El
Salvador, Guatemala, Honduras, and Nicaragua. DR-CAFTA is modeled
after NAFTA.
Some economists are concerned that these regional trade agreements may stand
in the way of broader international trade agreements under GATT. Although regional
agreements may lead to reduced tariffs for neighboring or member countries, they do
little to promote efficiency across the globe. For example, a Belgian firm may find it
easier to sell goods in France than does a firm from South America that has a lower
cost of production.

RECENT POLICY DEBATES AND TRADE
AGREEMENTS
We re now ready to discuss three recent policy debates concerning international trade:
1 Are foreign producers dumping their products?
2 Do trade laws inhibit environmental protection?
3 Do outsourcing and trade cause income inequality?
Are Foreign Producers Dumping Their Products?
Although tariff rates have been reduced in recent years, a number of controversies sur-
rounding free trade remain. One of these relates to dumping. A firm is dumping when
the price it charges in a foreign market is either lower than the price it charges in its
home market or lower than its production cost. Dumping is illegal under international
trade agreements. Hundreds of cases of alleged dumping are presented to WTO
authorities each year. Here are some cases in which the WTO concluded that dump-
ing had indeed occurred: Hong Kong VCRs sold in Europe; Chinese bicycles sold in
the United States; Asian TV sets sold in Europe; steel from Brazil, India, Japan, and
Spain sold in the United States; U.S. beef sold in Mexico; and Chinese computer disks
sold in Japan and the United States. Under the current provisions of the WTO, a
18.5
A P P L I C AT I O N 3
ARE THEY REALLY DUMPING?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: How does the Commerce Department try to
determine whether countries are dumping their products?
Dumping is selling a product in a foreign market at a lower price than a firms own
domestic market. You might think that this would require a comparison of actual
prices charged in home markets compared to foreign markets. But that is rarely the
case in the United States. For example, from 1995 to 1998, only 4 out of 141 cases of
dumping used actual prices.
Instead, the U.S. Department of Commerce typically uses a constructed value
method where it makes its own estimates of what prices in countries  own markets
would be based on available data on production costs, transportation, and other
expenses and also a margin for profit and administration. In many cases, these are
very crude and dated estimates. In other cases, they rely solely on the information
provided by the parties who filed the complaint, who clearly have a vested interest in
the outcome.
Perhaps this is why the Commerce Department virtually always finds that foreign
countries are in fact guilty of dumping their products. Chinese companies have been
accused of dumping for a wide array of products including crawfish, paint brushes,
sodium nitrate, and plastic shopping bags. Critics of dumping believe that con-
structed values  calculations overstate prices in domestic markets and inevitably lead
to the conclusion that firms are in fact guilty of dumping their products.

PART 7
nation can impose antidumping duties, a tax, on products that are being dumped
within its borders.
Why would a firm dump
charge a low price in the foreign market? The first rea-
son is price discrimination. Price discrimination occurs when a firm charges a different
price to different customers buying the same product. If a firm has a monopoly in its
home market but faces strong competition in a foreign market, it will naturally charge a
higher price in the home market. What the firm is doing is using its monopoly power to
charge higher prices to consumers at home and charge lower prices to consumers
abroad where it faces competition. This strategy maximizes the firms profits.
To illustrate how international price discrimination works, lets look at the case of
Korean VCRs.3
In the 1980s there were only three firms, all Korean, selling VCRs in Korea, but
there were dozens of firms selling VCRs in Europe. The lack of competition in
Korea generated very high prices for Korean consumers, who paid much more than
European consumers paid for identical Korean VCRs and VCRs produced by firms
in other countries. Essentially, Korean firms used their market power to discrimi-
nate against consumers in their own country. When international trade authorities
concluded these companies were, indeed, dumping VCRs in Europe, the Korean
firms responded by cutting prices in their home market. However, they didn t
increase their prices in Europe
much to the delight of European consumers and
the dismay of European producers, who had sought relief from the dumping in the
first place.
The Korean VCR example brings up a second reason for dumping: predatory
pricing
cutting prices in an attempt to drive rival firms out of business. The preda-
tory firm sets its price below its production cost, low enough that both the predator
and its prey (a firm in the foreign market) lose money. After the prey goes out of busi-
ness, the predator increases its price to earn a monopoly profit.
Although the rationale for antidumping laws is to prevent predatory pricing, it is
difficult to determine whether low prices are the result of this or price discrimination.
Many economists are skeptical about how frequently predatory pricing actually
occurs, as opposed to price discrimination. They suspect many nations use their
antidumping laws as protectionist policies in disguise. Because WTO rules limit tariffs
and quotas, some nations may be tempted to substitute antidumping duties for these
protectionist policies.
Until the 1990s, antidumping cases were brought almost exclusively by Australia,
New Zealand, Europe, Canada, and the United States. However, starting in the
1990s, the number of antidumping cases alleged by developing countries began to
rise. Today, approximately half the cases are brought by developing countries.
Professor Thomas Prusa of Rutgers University has studied antidumping and has
found it is a potent weapon for protecting domestic industries. If an antidumping case
is settled and a tariff is imposed as a result, imports typically fall by 50 to 70 percent
during the first three years of the protection period. Even if a country loses a claim,
imports still fall by 15 to 20 percent.4
Do Trade Laws Inhibit Environmental Protection?
In recent trade negotiations, a new player
environmental groups
appeared on
the scene. Starting in the early 1990s, environmentalists began to question
whether policies that liberalized trade could harm the environment. They were
concerned that increased trade would lead to worldwide environmental degrada-
tion. An important issue that attracted their attention was the killing of dolphins
by tuna fishers.
Anyone who catches tuna with a large net will also catch the dolphins that swim
with the tuna, and most of the dolphins will die. In 1972, the United States outlawed

the use of tuna nets by U.S. ships. However, ships from other nations, including
Mexico, were still catching tuna with nets and selling that tuna in the United States.
The United States responded with a ban of Mexican tuna caught with nets. The
Mexican government complained to an international trade authority that the tuna
boycott was an unfair trade barrier. The trade authority agreed with Mexico and
forced the United States to remove the boycott.
Under current WTO rules, a country can adopt any environmental standard it
chooses, as long as it does not discriminate against foreign producers. For example,
the United States can limit the exhaust emissions of all cars that operate in the United
States. As long as emissions rules apply equally to all cars, domestic and imports, the
rules are legal according to the WTO. An international panel upheld U.S. fuel effi-
ciency rules for automobiles on this principle.
The tuna boycott was a violation of WTO rules because killing dolphins does not
harm the U.S. environment directly. For the same reason, the United States cannot
ban imported goods produced by factories that generate air or water pollution in
other countries. It is easy to understand why WTO rules do not allow countries to
restrict trade on the basis of the methods that are used to produce goods and services.
Countries differ in the value they place on the environment. For example, a poor
nation may be willing to tolerate more pollution if it means attaining a higher stan-
dard of living for its citizens.
If trade restrictions cannot be used to protect the dolphins and deal with other
global environmental problems, what else can we do? Shouldn t we have the right
to protect dolphins? International agreements have been used for a variety of dif-
ferent environmental goals, from limiting the harvest of whales to reducing the
chemicals that deplete the ozone layer. These agreements are difficult to reach,
however, so some nations will be tempted to use trade restrictions to pursue envi-
ronmental goals. If they do, they will encounter resistance because WTO rules
mean that a nation can pursue its environmental goals only within its own borders.
In recent years, environmentalists have lobbied Congress not to approve bilateral
trade deals unless sufficient environmental standards are in place. This trend is
likely to continue.
Trade disputes about environmental issues are part of a larger phenomenon that
occurs when trade issues and national regulations collide. At one time, most trade dis-
putes were simply matters of protecting domestic industries from foreign competi-
tion. Agriculture, textile, and steel industries around the world frequently benefited
from various forms of protection. But in recent years, a new breed of trade disputes
has erupted revolving around social problems and the role that government regulation
should play in solving them.
The EU, for example, has banned imports of hormone-treated beef. The United
States and Canada successfully challenged this ban with the WTO. They argued there
was no scientific evidence that hormone-treated beef adversely affected human health.
The EU refused to rescind the ban and, as a consequence, the United States and
Canada were permitted to impose retaliatory tariffs on a wide range of European
products that affected many EU industries.
The EU s ban on hormone-treated beef was intended to protect European
farmers from imports, but it also reflected Europeans  nervousness about technol-
ogy. After all, Europe banned all hormone-treated beef, not just imported beef.
Shouldn t a country have a right to pursue this policy, even if it is not based on the
best science of the day? Although the costs of the policy are straightforward in
terms of higher beef prices, the benefits, in terms of potential safety and peace of
mind, are much more difficult to assess. Similar issues have arisen as genetically
modified crops have become more commonplace. As a world trading community,
we will have to decide at what point we allow national policy concerns to override
principles of free trade.

PART 7
Do Outsourcing and Trade Cause Income Inequality?
Inequality in wages has been growing in the United States since 1973. The wages of
skilled workers have risen faster than the wages of unskilled workers. World trade has
also boomed since 1973. Could there be a connection between the two?
Trade theory suggests a link between increased trade and increased wage inequal-
ity. Here is how they might be linked. Suppose the United States produces two types
of goods: one using skilled labor (say, airplanes) and one using unskilled labor (say,
textiles). The United States is likely to have a comparative advantage in products that
use skilled labor, and developing countries are likely to have a comparative advantage
in products that use unskilled labor. An increase in world trade will increase both
exports and imports. An increase in U.S. exports means we ll need to produce more
goods requiring skilled labor, so the domestic demand for skilled labor will increase,
and so will the wages of these workers. At the same time, an increase in U.S. imports
means we ll be buying more goods produced by unskilled laborers abroad, so the
demand for unskilled workers here will decrease, and these peoples wages will fall. As
A P P L I C AT I O N 4
TRADE, CONSUMPTION, AND INEQUALITY
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: Why might international trade reduce
measured inequality in the United States?
While it is conventional wisdom now that inequality in the United States has
increased in the last several decades, until recently no one had taken a careful look at
the actual living standards of different income groups, taking into account the goods
they purchase. Two economists from the University of Chicago, Christian Broda and
John Romalis, discovered that the prices low-income groups paid for goods and ser-
vices increased substantially less than for high-income groups. As a result, living stan-
dards have not become more unequal.
The key to understanding this result is that consumption patterns of the rich
and poor differ. The poor consume a higher ratio of nondurable goods (such as cos-
metics, toys, and sporting goods) to services than the rich, while prices for non-
durable goods have risen less than prices for services. Prices for the nondurable
goods purchased by the poor, which are typically sold in grocery, drug, and mass
merchandise stores, also increased less than the prices of nondurable goods pur-
chased by the rich. And the poor typically consume a higher fraction of new goods,
whose prices have often fallen.
Trade with China is an important part of this story. About one-third of the change
in relative prices that has helped the poor can be accounted for by an increase in
imports from China. These are the goods that stock the shelves of Walmart and other
lower-end stores where the poor shop. Sam Walton and his successors effectively ran
their own antipoverty program.
The moral of the story: Trade does not just affect employment patterns
it also
changes prices. We must take both factors into account to understand how living stan-
dards have changed for the rich and poor.

a result, the gap between the wages of the two types of workers in the United States
will grow.
In addition, U.S. firms will produce some components of their goods and services
overseas, which is known as outsourcing. If a firm outsources products that use
unskilled labor, the demand for unskilled labor in the United States will decline, and
this will also increase the gap between wages for the skilled and the unskilled.
Economists have tried to determine how much trade has contributed to growing
wage inequality in the United States. As usual, other factors make such a determina-
tion difficult. It is difficult, for example, to distinguish between the effects of trade and
the effects of technical progress. Technical change, such as the rapid introduction
and use of computers, will also tend to increase the demand for skilled workers and
decrease the demand for unskilled workers. Economists have noted, however, that the
exports of goods using skilled labor and the imports of goods using unskilled labor
have both increased, just as the theory predicts. Nonetheless, at least some of the
increased wage inequality is caused by international trade. Trade, however, may also
reduce the prices of goods and services purchased by consumers in different income
classes. We must take this factor into account in assessing trade and inequality.
One response to this undesirable side effect of trade is to use trade restrictions
to protect industries that use unskilled workers. Another approach is to make the
transition to an economy with more skilled than unskilled jobs less traumatic. In the
long run, of course, workers will move to industries that require skilled labor, and
they will eventually earn higher wages. However, in the short run the government
could facilitate the transition by providing assistance for the education and training
of unskilled workers.
More recently, there has been another concern. In recent years, jobs in call cen-
ters for airlines and credit card companies, customer service and technical support for
computers, and the work of writing computer code have been relocated overseas.
Some of these jobs require considerable skill, and therefore not all jobs that are out-
sourced will be low-skilled jobs. Nor can all services be outsourced, particularly those
that are less routine. In the coming years, we will gain better insights into how inter-
national trade and outsourcing affect the wages of skilled workers.
Why Do People Protest Free Trade?
We have seen some of the important policy issues surrounding trade. Under current
international trade rules, a country cannot dictate the terms under which another
country actually produces the goods and services it sells
even if production harms
the environment. It is also possible that free trade can contribute to inequality within
the United States, although lower prices for goods consumed partially offset this
effect. But do these reasons explain the passion we sometimes see in protests against
free trade, such as the riots in 1999 in Seattle at a WTO meeting or the protestors
dressed in death masks gathering at world trade meetings? Possibly, but protestors
are more likely driven by something very basic. As we have seen in this chapter, trade
and specialization provide important opportunities to raise living standards through-
out the globe. But they also mean individuals and nations surrender some of their
independence and sovereignty. By not producing precisely what we consume, we
become dependent on others to trade with us. By cooperating with other nations, we
need to develop agreed-upon rules that, at times, limit our own actions.
The protestors may simply not understand the principles of trade, but they also
may fear loss of cultural identity and independence. In todays world, no man is an
island.  Nations have become increasingly dependent on one another. Multinational
corporations are the ultimate symbol of this interdependence, producing and distrib-
uting goods on a global scale. Thus companies such as McDonald s, Starbucks, or
Nike can come under attack by protestors. The benefits of trade, however, are so vast
that countries will need to find ways to address issues of sovereignty and control while
retaining an open and prosperous trading system.

In this chapter, we discussed
the benefits of specialization
and trade, and we explored
the 
trade-offs 
associated
with
protectionist policies.
There is a basic conflict
between consumers who pre-
fer free trade because free
trade decreases prices and workers in the protected indus-
tries who want to keep their jobs. Here are the main points
of the chapter:
1 If one country has a comparative advantage vis-à-vis
another country in producing a particular good (a lower
opportunity cost), specialization and trade will benefit
both countries.
2 An import ban or an import quota increases prices, pro-
tecting domestic industries, but domestic consumers pay
the price.
3 Because the victims of protectionist policies often retaliate,
the protection of a domestic industry can harm an export-
ing industry.
4 A tariff, a tax on imports, generates revenue for the govern-
ment, whereas an import quota
a limit on imports
gener-
ates revenue for foreigners or importers.
5 In principle, the laws against dumping are designed to pre-
vent predatory pricing. In practice, predatory pricing laws are
often used to shield domestic industries from competition.
Allegations of it are hard to prove.
6 Under World Trade Organization (WTO) rules, each country
may pursue its environmental goals only within its own borders.
7 International trade has contributed to the widening gap
between the wages of low-skilled and high-skilled labor.
However, it also has reduced the relative prices facing the
poor, offsetting some of the effects on inequality.

other way  as smugglers bring shirts into the country.
Your job is to combat shirt smuggling. Use the infor-
mation in Figure 18.3 on page 369 to answer the fol-
lowing questions:
a. Suppose importers can sell their shirts on the world
market at a price of $12 per shirt. How much is an
importer willing to pay to get customs officials to
look the other way?
b. What sort of change in trade policy would make
your job easier?
2.6
Tariffs on Computer Chips. Suppose a country
imposed tariffs on computer chips to protect its chip-
making industries. What other types of firms in that
economy might object to this policy?
2.7
Tariffs and the Poor. Historically, apparel and
textiles were subject to high tariffs. Explain why this
might hurt low-income consumers more than high-
income consumers. (Related to Application 1 on
page 371.)
2.8
Auctioning Import Licenses. In the text we
explained that tariffs can be set to have the same
effects as import quotas. However, if the government
gives import licenses to producers, it will not collect
any revenues. Suppose the government auctions the
import licenses to the highest bidders. How will the
revenue from the auction compare to the revenue
raised by tariffs?
What Are the Rationales for Protectionist
Policies?
3.1
The 
-industry argument is often given to
provide a rationale for tariffs for new firms.
3.2
Knowledge gained during production is known as
by doing.
3.3
If only one firm can exist in a market, a government
may try to subsidize the firm so that the country can
share in the 
profits.
3.4
In the 1950s and 1960s, countries in 
used tariffs and other policies to nurture domestic
industries.
3.5
Learning By Doing? An industry has been operating
for 10 years under protection. The government wants
to remove the trade protection, but the industry
claims that it needs the protection because of learning
by doing. Evaluate its claim. Can you think of a cir-
cumstance where it could be true?
3.6
Two Countries Fighting Over Airplane Production.
Suppose there are monopoly profits in the production
of airplanes, but two countries are each determined to
capture the industry. When one country subsidizes its

domestic firm, the other country matches the tactic. As
a result, both firms stay in business. Who gains and
who loses? Consider the effects on the firms, con-
sumers, and taxpayers.
3.7
Unfair Competition. We are amused by candle mak-
ers asking for protection from the sun under the guise
of unfair competition. How does this differ from U.S.
producers of clothing claiming there is unfair compe-
tition from low-wage countries? (Related to

the authors of the report discuss the important
changes that occurred in 1934 under the Reciprocal
Trade Agreements Act. They contend that it began
to move the United States to a policy of more open
trade after the Smoot-Hawley tariffs. Identify the
key changes enacted in 1934.

Expansion in the European Union. When the EU
originated, member countries generally had similar
standards of living. However, with the most recent
expansion of the EU, countries that were less devel-

wage inequality within the more established
European countries?
4.7
Trade in Intellectual Property. Trade in interna-
tional property (for example, patents, licenses, roy-
alty agreements) has been particularly controversial.
Go to the intellectual property section of the WTO s
Web site (http://www.wto.org/english/tratop_e/

studies. Do developing countries, as well as devel-
oped countries, have an interest in protecting intel-
lectual property?

not purchase food products that use genetically

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
Today, the world currency markets are always open.
When foreign-exchange traders in New York City are
sound asleep at 3:00 A.M., their counterparts in London
are already on their phones and computers at 8:00 A.M.
In Tokyo, it s 6:00 P.M., and the day is just ending. By the
time Tokyo traders return home after their long commutes,
the New York traders are back at work. The currency mar-
kets keep working even when the labor market rests.
On any given day, trillions of dollars of value are
exchanged in currency markets. The fortunes of industries,
and sometimes countries, are determined by the ups and
downs of currencies. Controversies have always swirled
around exchange markets. Are they dominated by large
speculators, or are they driven by the necessities of doing
business around the world? Most importantly, do these
markets work efficiently and effectively?

CHAPTER 19
THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE

A
ll currencies are traded 24 hours a day. The value of every currency depends on
news and late-breaking developments throughout the world. Rising gas prices, a
new terrorist attack, or a change in the leadership of a foreign government can
easily affect the price at which currencies trade with one another. If the U.S. secretary of
the Treasury utters a casual remark about the dollar or the value of the Chinese currency,
it reverberates instantly throughout the world. Modern communications
e-mail,
instant messaging, smart phones, videoconferencing, and satellite transmissions
accelerate the process.
How do changes in the value of currencies affect the U.S. economy? In Chapter 14,
we explored the role of monetary policy in an open economy and its effects on exchange
rates. In this chapter, we take a more comprehensive and in-depth look at exchange rates
as well as other aspects of the international financial system. Understanding our inter-
national financial system will help you to interpret the often complex financial news
from abroad. For example, if the value of the dollar starts to fall against the Japanese yen,
what does it mean? Is this good news or bad news?
HOW EXCHANGE RATES ARE DETERMINED
In this section, we examine how the value of a currency is determined in world mar-
kets. We then look at the factors that can change the value of a currency.
What Are Exchange Rates?
To conduct international transactions between countries with different currencies, it
is necessary to exchange one currency for another. The exchange rate is defined as
the price at which we can exchange one currency for another.
Suppose a U.S. songwriter sells the rights of a hit song to a Japanese producer.
The U.S. songwriter agrees to accept $50,000. If the exchange rate between the U.S.
dollar and Japanese yen is 100 yen per dollar, it will cost the Japanese producer
5,000,000 yen to purchase the rights to the song. Because international trade occurs
between nations with different currencies, the exchange rate
the price at which one
currency trades for another currency
is a crucial determinant of trade. Fluctuations
in the exchange rate can have a huge impact on what goods countries import or export
and the overall trade balance.
Throughout this chapter, we will measure the exchange rate in units of foreign
currency per U.S. dollar, that is, as 100 Japanese yen per dollar or 0.8 euro per dollar.
The euro is the common currency in Europe. With these exchange rates, you would
receive 100 yen for each dollar, but only 0.8 euro for each dollar.
We can think of the exchange rate as the price of dollars in terms of foreign cur-
rency. Recall from Chapter 14 that an increase in the value of a currency relative to
the currency of another nation is called an appreciation of a currency. If the exchange
rate between the dollar and the yen increases from 100 yen per dollar to 110 yen per
dollar, one dollar will purchase more yen. Say, for instance, you ve taken a trip to
Japan for spring break. Because the dollar has appreciated, your dollar will exchange
for more yen. You will now have more yen to spend on Japanese goods
say, MP3
players, DVD players, or entertainment
than you had before the dollar appreciated.
The dollar has become more expensive in terms of yen. Its price has risen, in other
words. Because the dollar has increased in value, we say the dollar has appreciated
against the yen.
A depreciation of a currency is a decrease in the value of a currency relative to the
currency of another nation. If the exchange rate falls from 100 to 90 yen per dollar,
you ll get fewer yen for each dollar you exchange. Japanese goods
whose prices
remain the same in Japanese yen
will become more expensive to U.S. residents.
You ll have to use more dollars to obtain the yen to purchase the same MP3 and DVD

PART 7
players. The price of dollars in terms of yen has fallen, in other words, so we say the
dollar has depreciated against the yen.
Be sure you understand that if one currency appreciates, the other must depreci-
ate. If the dollar appreciates against the yen, for example, the yen must depreciate
against the dollar. You ll get more yen in exchange for the dollar, but now when you
trade your yen back, you ll get fewer dollars. For example, if the dollar appreciates
from 100 to 110 yen per dollar, when you trade 100 yen back into U.S. currency, no
longer will you get $1.00
you ll get just $0.91. Conversely, if the dollar depreciates
against the yen, the yen must appreciate against the dollar. If the dollar depreciates
from 100 yen to 90 yen per dollar, when you trade back 100 yen, you ll get $1.11,
rather than just $1.00.
The exchange rate enables us to convert prices in one country to values in another
country. A simple example illustrates how an exchange rate works. If you want to buy
a watch from France, you need to know what it would cost. You e-mail the store in
France and are told the watch sells for 240 euros. The store owners live in France and
want to be paid in euros. To figure out what it will cost you in dollars, you need to
know the exchange rate between euros and dollars. If the exchange rate is 0.8 euro per
dollar, the watch will cost you $300:
If the exchange rate is one euro per dollar, the watch will cost only $240. As you
can see, changes in the exchange rate will affect the prices of goods purchased on
world markets and partly determine the pattern of imports and exports throughout
the world.
How Demand and Supply Determine Exchange Rates
How are exchange rates determined? The exchange rate between U.S. dollars and
euros is determined in the foreign-exchange market, the market in which dollars trade
for euros. To understand this market, we can use demand and supply. In Figure 19.1,
we plot the demand and supply curves for dollars in exchange for euros.

* FIGURE 19.1
The Demand for and Supply of U.S. Dollars
Market equilibrium occurs where the demand for U.S. dollars equals the supply.

The supply curve is the quantity supplied of dollars in exchange for euros.
Individuals or firms that want to buy European goods or assets will need to exchange
dollars for euros. The supply curve is drawn under the assumption that as euros
become cheaper, total spending on European goods and assets will increase.
Therefore, the supply curve slopes upward: As the value of the dollar increases, more
dollars will be supplied to the currency market in exchange for euros.
The demand curve represents the quantity demanded of dollars in exchange for
euros. Individuals or firms in Europe that want to buy U.S. goods or assets must trade
euros for dollars. For example, to visit Disney World in Florida, a German or French
family must exchange euros for dollars. As the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar falls,
dollars become cheaper in terms of euros. This makes U.S. goods and assets less
expensive for European residents, because each euro buys more U.S. dollars. As U.S.
goods and assets become cheaper, we assume more European residents will want to
trade euros for dollars. Therefore, the demand curve for dollars in exchange for euros
slopes downward: Total demand for dollars will increase as the price of the dollar falls,
or depreciates, against the euro.
Equilibrium in the market for foreign exchange occurs where the demand curve
intersects the supply curve. In Figure 19.1, equilibrium occurs at an exchange rate of
0.8 euro per dollar. At this price, the willingness to trade dollars for euros just matches
the willingness to trade euros for dollars. The foreign exchange market is in balance,
and the price of euros in terms of a dollar is $1.25.
Price of euros per dollar in equilibrium:
Now, however, suppose the demand and supply forces between dollars and euros
change. If the exchange rate, e, increases, the dollar buys more euros
the price of dol-
lars in terms of euros increases, in other words. For example, if e increases from
0.8 euro per dollar to 1 euro per dollar, the dollar has become more valuable
meaning
it has appreciated against the euro. Be sure you see both sides of the same exchange
coin: If the dollar appreciates against the euro, then the euro must depreciate against
the dollar. So, if the exchange rate increases from 0.8 to 1 euro per dollar, what will the
price of a single euro be now?
When the dollar appreciates, each euro is worth less. In this case, the price of the
euro will fall from $1.25 per euro to $1.00 per euro.
Dollar appreciates:
If the exchange rate falls from 0.8 euro to 0.6 euro per dollar, the dollar has depre-
ciated in value against the euro
the price of dollars in terms of euros has decreased,
in other words. When the dollar depreciates, each euro is worth more. In this case, the
price of the euro will rise from $1.25 to $1.67.
Dollar depreciates:
Changes in Demand or Supply
Changes in demand or changes in supply will change equilibrium exchange rates. In
Figure 19.2, we show how an increase in demand, a shift of the demand curve to the
right, will increase, or appreciate, the exchange rate. U.S. dollars will become more
expensive relative to euros as the price of U.S. dollars in terms of euros increases.
0.6 euro per dollar = 1 dollar
0.6 euro = 1.67 dollars per euro, or $1.67 per euro
1.0 euro per dollar = 1 dollar
1 euro = 1.0 dollar per euro, or $1.00 per euro
0.8 euro per dollar = 1 dollar
0.8 euro = 1.25 dollars per euro, or $1.25 per euro

PART 7
Two factors are the main causes of shifts of the demand curve for dollars: First,
higher U.S. interest rates will lead to an increased demand for dollars. With higher
returns in U.S. markets, investors throughout the world will want to buy dollars to
invest in U.S. assets. The other factor, lower U.S. prices, will also lead to an increased
demand for dollars. For example, if prices at Disney World fell, there would be an
overall increase in the demand for dollars, because more tourists would want to visit
Disney World.
Figure 19.3 shows the effects of an increase in the supply of dollars, a shift in the
supply curve to the right. An increase in the supply of dollars will lead to a fall, or
depreciation, of the value of the dollar against the euro. What are the main causes of
and increase in the supply of dollars? Again, the same two factors: interest rates and
prices. Higher European interest rates will lead U.S. investors to purchase European

bonds or other interest-paying assets. Purchasing European bonds will require U.S.
investors to supply dollars for euros, which will drive down the exchange rate for
dollars. Lower European prices will also lead to an increase in the supply of dollars
for euros.
Lets summarize the key facts about the foreign exchange market, using euros as
our example:
1 The demand curve for dollars represents the demand for dollars in exchange for
euros. The curve slopes downward. As the dollar depreciates, there will be an
increase in the quantity of dollars demanded in exchange for euros.
2 The supply curve for dollars is the supply of dollars in exchange for euros. The
curve slopes upward. As the dollar appreciates, there will be an increase in the
quantity of dollars supplied in exchange for euros.
3 Increases in U.S. interest rates and decreases in U.S. prices will increase the
demand for dollars, leading to an appreciation of the dollar.
4 Increases in European interest rates and decreases in European prices will
increase the supply of dollars in exchange for euros, leading to a depreciation of
the dollar.
REAL EXCHANGE RATES AND PURCHASING
POWER PARITY
As our examples of Disney World and watches from France indicate, changes in mar-
ket exchange rates can affect the demand for a countrys goods and services. However,
we have been assuming that the prices of watches and trips to Disney World do not
change. In general, prices do change over time, so we need to adjust the exchange rate
determined in the foreign exchange market to take into account changes in prices.
This adjustment is an application of the real-nominal principle.
R E A L - N O M I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
What matters to people is the real value of money or income
its purchasing
power
not the face value of money or income.
Economists have developed a concept called the real exchange rate that adjusts the
market exchange rates for changes in prices. The real exchange rate is defined as the
price of U.S. goods and services relative to foreign goods and services, expressed in a
common currency. We measure it by expressing U.S. prices for goods and services in
foreign currency and comparing them to foreign prices. Here is the formula for the
real exchange rate:
We can use this formula to help us understand the factors that change the real
exchange rate. First, an increase in U.S. prices will raise the real exchange rate.
When foreign prices and the exchange rate are held constant, an increase in U.S.
prices will raise the relative price of U.S. goods. Second, an appreciation of the dol-
lar when prices are held constant will also increase the price of U.S. goods relative to
foreign goods. And if foreign prices fall, U.S. goods will become relatively more
expensive as well.
Notice that the real exchange rate takes into account changes in a country s
prices over time because of inflation. Suppose Country A had an inflation rate of
real exchange rate =

20 percent, and Country B had no inflation. Suppose, too, the exchange rate of
Country As currency depreciated 20 percent against the currency of Country B. In
this case, there would be no change in the real exchange rate between the two
countries. Although prices in Country A would have increased by 20 percent, its
currency would be 20 percent cheaper. From the point of view of residents of
Country B, nothing has changed at all
they pay the same price in their currency
to buy goods in Country A.
Economists have found that a country s net exports (exports minus its imports)
will fall when its real exchange rate increases. For example, if the U.S. real exchange
rate increases, the prices of U.S. goods will increase relative to foreign goods. This
will reduce U.S. exports because our goods will have become more expensive; it will
also increase imports to the United States because foreign goods will have become
cheaper. As a result of the decrease in U.S. exports and the increase in U.S. imports,
net exports will decline.
Figure 19.4 plots an index of the real exchange rate for the United States against
net exports as a share of GDP from 1980 to 2009, a period in which there were large
changes in the real exchange rate and net exports. The index, called a multilateral real
exchange rate, is based on an average of real exchange rates with all U.S. trading part-
ners. Notice that when the multilateral real exchange rate increased, U.S. net exports
fell. As you can see in the figure, starting in both 1983 and 1996 the real exchange rate
increased sharply. Subsequently, net exports as a share of GDP fell. A decrease in the
real exchange rate increases net exports. For example, in 1986 and 2005, the real
exchange rate began to decrease and net exports subsequently increased. The relation-
ship between the real exchange rate and net exports is not perfect, however
other
factors, such as the growth of GDP, also affect net exports.

At this Big Mac  exchange rate
3.49 Chinese yuan to every U.S. dollar
the
Big Mac in China would cost the same as in the United States. However, the actual
exchange rate for the Chinese yuan in March 2010 when these prices were computed
was 6.83 Chinese yuan per U.S. dollar, so the Big Mac was actually cheaper in China.
Relative to the exchange rate implied by the law of one price, the Chinese yuan was
95 percent undervalued. This is a very large difference and cannot easily be attributed
to measurement issues. This calculation gives a hint as to the Chinese-U.S. exchange
rate controversy.

THE CHINESE YUAN AND BIG MACS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How can the price of a Big Mac in China
shed light on the U.S.-Chinese currency tensions?
In recent years, the U.S. and Chinese governments have been at odds about the
appropriate value of the exchange rate between the Chinese yuan and the U.S. dollar.
The United States believes that the Chinese government is holding the yuan below its
true value. Can the price of a Big Mac in China shed light on this controversy?
For a number of years, the magazine the Economist measured the price of a Big
Mac throughout the world and used these prices to explore whether currency values
were too high or too low compared to the law of one price. Table 19.1 contains the
results for selected countries, including China.
Big Macs sell for widely different prices around the globe, as measured in dol-
lars compared to the $3.58 price in the United States in March 2010. They are a
bargain in China at $1.83, but very expensive in Switzerland at $6.16. Table 19.1
also contains the market-exchange rate predicted by the theory of purchasing
power parity. To obtain this exchange rate, divide the price of Big Macs in the for-
eign country by the dollar price. For example, for China the purchasing power
exchange rate is
 =  3.49 Chinese yuan per U.S. dollar
 
12.50 Chinese yuan (the price of a Big Mac in China)
$3.58 (the price of a Big Mac in the United States)

traded easily across countries (such as gold bars), we would expect the price to be
the same when expressed in a common currency. For example, the price of gold
bars sold in France should be nearly identical to the price of gold bars sold in New
York. If the price were higher in France, demand would shift to New York, raising
the price in New York and lowering the price in France until the prices were equal.
The tendency for easily tradable goods to sell at the same price when expressed in
a common currency is known as the law of one price. Metals, agricultural com-
modities, computer chips, and other tradable goods follow the law of one price.
If all goods were easily tradable and the law of one price held exactly, exchange
rates would reflect no more than the differences in the way the price levels are
expressed in the two countries. For example, if a basket of goods in Europe costs
3,000 euros and the identical basket costs $3,750 in the United States, an exchange
rate of 0.8 euros to one dollar would make the costs the same in either currency
.
According to one theory of how market exchange rates are determined, they sim-
ply reflect differences in the overall price levels between countries. According to the
theory of purchasing power parity, a unit of any given currency should be able to
buy the same quantity of goods in all countries. In our European-U.S. example, the
theory of purchasing power parity predicts a market exchange rate of 0.8 euro per dol-
lar. At that exchange rate, European and U.S. goods would sell for the same price if
their products were expressed in a common currency. Research has shown that pur-
chasing power parity does not hold precisely.
Many systematic studies have confirmed that purchasing power parity does not
give fully accurate predictions for exchange rates. The reason is that many goods, such
as housing and services like haircuts, are not traded across countries. The law of one
price does not hold for notraded goods, which make up approximately 50 percent of
the value of production in an economy. There is some truth to purchasing power par-
ity, because exchange rates do reflect differences in the price level between countries.
But, as the example with the Big Mac shows, purchasing power parity can provide a
clue to exchange rates in some circumstances.
THE CURRENT ACCOUNT, THE FINANCIAL
ACCOUNT, AND THE CAPITAL ACCOUNT
In this section, we examine international transactions in more detail. A useful frame-
work for understanding international transactions is the balance of payments, a sys-
tem of accounts that measures transactions of goods, services, income, and financial
assets between domestic households, businesses, and governments and residents of the
rest of the world during a specific time period.
Economists find it useful to divide international transactions in the balance of
payments into three types: the current account, the financial account, and the capital
account. These measures provide the most comprehensive picture of a countrys bal-
ance of trade with the rest of the world and the consequences of that trade for a coun-
try s ownership of assets, such as stocks, bonds, and real estate. A country s current
account is the sum of its
net exports (exports minus imports),
net income received from investments abroad, and
net transfer payments from abroad (such as foreign aid).
If a country has a positive current account, we say that its current account is in
surplus. If a country has a negative current account, we say that its current account is
in deficit. If the income from investments abroad and net transfer payments is negligi-
ble, the current account becomes equivalent to a countrys net exports.

CHAPTER 19
THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE

A country s financial account transactions include all the purchases and sales of
existing financial and produced assets (stocks, bonds, real estate) by the private sector
and the government. The financial account is defined as the value of the country s net
sales (sales minus purchases) of assets. If the United States sold $100 billion net in
assets, its financial account would be $100 billion. If the value on the financial
account is positive, we say the country has a surplus on the financial account.
Similarly, if the value on the financial account is negative, we say it has a deficit on
the financial account.
A country s capital account transactions consist of two components. First,
they include the purchase or sale of nonproduced, nonfinancial assets, such as
patents, copyrights, trademarks, and leases. Second, they also include transfers of
capital, such as debt forgiveness or migrants  transfers (goods or financial assets
accompanying migrants as they leave or enter the country). Capital account trans-
actions are much smaller in magnitude than transactions on the current or finan-
cial account.
Rules for Calculating the Current, Financial, and Capital Accounts
Here is a simple rule for understanding transactions on the current, financial, and cap-
ital accounts: Any action that gives rise to a demand for foreign currency is a deficit
item. Any action that gives rise to a supply of foreign currency is a surplus item.
Lets apply this rule to the current account and the financial account, taking the
point of view of the United States (a similar logic applies to the capital account):
1 Current account. Items imported into the United States show up as a deficit (neg-
ative) on the current account because we have to trade U.S. currency for foreign
currency to buy them. Items exported from the United States show up as a sur-
plus (positive) in the current account because foreigners have to trade their cur-
rency for U.S. dollars to buy those products. Income from investments abroad
and net transfers received are treated like exports because they result in a supply
of foreign currency for dollars. Summarizing, we have
2 Financial account. The purchase of a foreign asset by a U.S. resident leads to a
deficit (negative) item on the financial account because it requires a demand for
foreign currency. (You can think of the purchase of a foreign asset as just another
import.) A purchase of a U.S. asset by a foreign resident leads to a supply of for-
eign currency and a surplus (positive) item on the financial account. (Think of
this as an export.) Summarizing, we have
The current, financial, and capital accounts of a country are linked by a very
important relationship:
current account +  financial account +  capital account = 0

U.S. financial account surplus = foreign purchases of U.S. assets
  +  net income from foreign investments +  net transfers from abroad

financial account
The value of a country s net sales (sales
minus purchases) of assets.

PART 7
The current account plus the financial account, plus the capital account must sum
to zero. Why?
To keep things simple, let s ignore the relatively minor capital account transac-
tions. In that case, the current plus financial accounts must sum to zero, because
any excess demand for foreign currency that arises from transactions in goods and
services
that means we re looking at the current account
must be met by an
excess supply of foreign currency arising from asset transactions
the financial
account. Suppose the United States has a current account deficit of $50 billion,
which means it is importing more than it is exporting. This excess demand of for-
eign currency by people in the United States can be met only by an excess supply of
foreign currency that arises from the financial account
where foreign residents
are purchasing $50 billion more in U.S. assets than U.S. residents are purchasing of
foreign assets. In other words, the current account deficit is offset by the financial
account surplus.
Lets look at this from a slightly different angle. Consider again the case in which
the United States is running a current account deficit because imports from abroad
exceed exports. (For simplicity, transfers and income earned from investments abroad
are both zero.) The current account deficit means that, on net, foreign residents and
their governments are the recipients of dollars because they have sold more goods to
the United States than they have purchased.
What do foreign residents do with these dollars? They can either hold the dollars
or use them to purchase U.S. assets. In either case, foreign residents and their govern-
ments have acquired U.S. assets, either dollars or other U.S. assets, such as U.S.
Treasury bills. The value of these assets is the U.S. current account deficit. Because a
sale of a U.S. asset to a foreign resident is a surplus item on the U.S. financial account,
the value of the financial account will be equal to the negative of the value of the cur-
rent account. So, from this perspective also, the current account and the financial
account must sum to zero.
If a country runs a current account surplus
it is exporting more than importing,
in other words
the country acquires foreign exchange. The country can either keep
the foreign exchange or use it to buy foreign assets. In either case, its purchases of net
foreign assets will equal its current account surplus. Because the financial account is
the negative of the purchases of net foreign assets, the current account and financial
account will again sum to zero.
Table 19.2 shows the balance of payments for the United States for 2008: the cur-
rent account, the financial account, and the capital account. The current account is
made up of the balance in goods, services, net investment income, and net transfers. In
2008, the United States had a negative balance on the goods account and net transfer,
but a positive balance on the services and net income category. However, the large
negative balance on the goods account made the overall current account balance

negative. The financial account includes net increases in U.S. holdings abroad (nega-
tive entries in the financial account) and foreign holdings of U.S. assets (positive
entries in the financial account). Because the government collects the current account,
financial account, and capital account data from separate sources, a statistical discrep-
ancy occurs. (In 2008, this was exceptionally large because of the difficulty of under-
standing all the transactions involved with the financial crisis.) Once we include this
statistical discrepancy, the current account, the financial account, and the capital
account sum to zero.
Since 1982, the United States has run a current account deficit every year.
This means the United States has run a financial plus capital account surplus of
equal value for these years as well. Because a financial account surplus means for-
eign nations acquire a country s assets, the United States has reduced its net hold-
ing of foreign assets. In 1986, the U.S. Department of Commerce estimated the
United States had a net international investment position of $136 billion,
meaning U.S. holdings of foreign assets exceeded foreign holdings of U.S. assets
by $136 billion.
Because of its current account deficits, the U.S. net international investment
position fell every year. By 2008 the U.S. net international investment position was

WORLD SAVINGS AND U.S. CURRENT ACCOUNT DEFICITS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: What factors may allow the United States to
continue running large trade deficits with the rest of the world?
The 2006 Economic Report of the President directly addressed whether the United States
can continue to run large current account deficits and, of course, financial account
surpluses. In the report, the government recognized that the current account deficits
would eventually be reduced. However, it also highlighted a number of factors sug-
gesting the deficits could continue for a long period of time.
The report explains that the U.S. current account deficit needs to be placed in
a global context. For the United States to continue to run a current account
deficit, other countries in the world need to continue to purchase U.S. assets. In
essence, they must have total savings in excess of their own investment desires. As
long as there are countries in this situation, the United States could continue to
run a trade deficit.
In recent years, four major countries experienced circumstances that encouraged
them to save by purchasing assets from abroad. Both Japan and Germany had high
savings rates, but low rates of domestic investment. Slow economic growth in both
countries led firms to be very cautious about making domestic investment. With lim-
ited domestic investment opportunities, savers in Japan and Germany thus placed
their funds abroad. Russia has large reserves of oil and gas, and increasing energy
prices in the last several years provided Russians with substantial new revenue. They
decided to use this revenue to invest abroad. Finally, China had high investment rates
but even higher savings rates. As a result, China as a whole invested abroad. For the
United States to continue to run trade deficits in the future, these or other countries
must want to continue to save more than they want to invest domestically.

negative $3.5 trillion, meaning foreign residents owned $3.5 trillion more U.S. assets than
U.S. residents owned foreign assets. You may have heard the United States referred to as a
net debtor. This is just another way of saying the U.S. net international investment position
is negative. As a consequence of the United States being a net debtor, earnings from inter-
national assets flow out of the United States to foreign countries. In the future, part of the
incomes earned in the United States will be paid to foreigners abroad. This is a natural
consequence of the United States being a net debtor.
What are the consequences of the large U.S. trade deficits?
When the United States runs a trade deficit, U.S. residents are spending more on
goods and services than they are currently producing. Although the United States
does sell many goods and services abroad (such as supercomputers, movies, DVDs,
and accounting services), it buys even more goods and services from abroad (such as
clothes, electronics, and machine tools).
A trade deficit forces the United States to sell some of its assets to individuals or
governments in foreign countries. Here is how it works: When U.S. residents buy
more goods abroad than they sell, they give up more dollars for imports than they
receive in dollars from the sale of exports. These dollars given up to purchase imports
end up in the hands of foreigners, who can then use them to purchase U.S. assets such
as stocks, government bonds, or even real estate. In recent years, Asian investors,
including foreign governments, have bought a variety of assets in the United States,
including U.S. Treasury bonds and even stakes in investment banking firms. Foreign
governments have accumulated considerable assets and invested them in private mar-
kets abroad through sovereign investment funds. Current estimates place the value
of assets in these funds at $3.8 trillion.
The purchase of U.S. assets by foreign investors should not be surprising, because
we have been running large trade deficits with many Asian economies, especially
China. These countries were willing to sell us more goods than we were selling to
them, and therefore they accumulated U.S. dollars with which they could purchase
U.S. assets. There is considerable debate about whether the very large U.S. current
account deficits can continue.
FIXED AND FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE RATES
To set the stage for understanding exchange rate systems, let s recall what happens
when a country s exchange rate appreciates
increases in value. There are two dis-
tinct effects:
1 The increased value of the exchange rate makes imports less expensive for the
residents of the country where the exchange rate appreciated. For example, if the
U.S. dollar appreciates against the euro, European watches will become less
expensive for U.S. consumers. U.S. consumers would like an appreciated dollar,
because it would lower their cost of living.
2 The increased value of the exchange rate makes U.S. goods more expensive on
world markets. A U.S. exchange appreciation will increase imports, such as
European watches, but decrease exports, such as California wine.
Because exports fall and imports rise, net exports (exports minus imports) will
decrease. Similarly, when a country s exchange rate depreciates, there are two dis-
tinct effects:
1 For example, if the U.S. dollar depreciates against the Japanese yen, Japanese
imports will become more expensive in the United States, thereby raising the
cost of living in the United States.
2 At the same time, U.S. goods will become cheaper in world markets. U.S. exports
will rise and imports will fall, so net U.S. exports will increase.

CHAPTER 19

Conversely, if the governments want to lower the price of the dollar relative to
euros, they will buy euros in exchange for dollars. By selling dollars for euros, they
increase the supply of dollars. The price of the dollar therefore falls while the price of
the euro increases. Note that to affect the price of the euro against the dollar, the
U.S. government must exchange euros for dollars. The government will acquire and

Government Intervention to Raise the Price of the Dollar
To increase the price of dollars, the U.S. government sells euros in exchange for dollars. This shifts
the demand curve for dollars to the right.
Fixing the Exchange Rate
Sometimes countries do not want their exchange rate to change. They may want to
avoid sharp rises in the cost of living for their citizens when their currency depreci-
ates, or they may want to keep net exports from falling when their currency appre-
ciates. To prevent the value of the currency from changing, governments can enter
the foreign exchange market to try to influence the price of foreign exchange.
Economists call these efforts to influence the exchange rate foreign exchange
market intervention.
In the United States, the Treasury Department has the official responsibility for
foreign exchange intervention, though it operates in conjunction with the Federal
Reserve. In other countries, governments also intervene in the foreign exchange mar-
ket. To influence the price at which one currency trades for another, governments
have to affect the demand or supply for their currency. To increase the value of its cur-
rency, a government must increase the currencys demand. To decrease the value of its
currency, the government must increase its supply.
In Figure 19.5, we show how governments can fix, or peg, the price of a currency.
Suppose the U.S. and European governments want the exchange rate to be 0.8 euro
per dollar. The price at which demand and supply are currently equal, however, is only
0.6 euro per dollar. To increase the price of the U.S. dollar, the governments will need
to increase the dollar s demand. To do this, either government
the United States or
European central banks
or both, can sell euros for dollars in the foreign exchange
market. This will shift the demand curve for dollars to the right until the price of dol-
lars rises to 0.8 euro per dollar.

accumulate euros any time it tries to raise their price. To raise the price of the dollar,
which lowers the value of the euro, the U.S. government must sell some of the euros
it has accumulated. But what would happen if the United States had no euros to sell?
The United States could borrow euros from European governments or persuade
them to sell euros for dollars.
Fixed versus Flexible Exchange Rates
Next, we discuss two different types of exchange rate systems. Then we take a brief
look at historical U.S exchange rate policy and developments in exchange rates in the
world today.
FLEXIBLE EXCHANGE RATE SYSTEM
If exchange rates are determined in free
markets, we have a flexible exchange rate system. Under a pure flexible exchange
rate system, the price of a currency will rise if the demand increases more than supply
and will fall if supply increases more than demand. As we have seen, a variety of factors
can determine exchange rates, including foreign and domestic interest rates as well as
foreign and domestic prices. Other factors, including market psychology, can also
affect the value of a nations currency. Whatever its source, an increase in the demand
for currency will raise its price. We have also seen that governments may intervene to
prevent currency from changing its value. In the most extreme case, there would be no
change in the value of a currency.
FIXED EXCHANGE RATES
Whether you are in California, New York, or Indiana,
all prices are quoted in dollars. No one asks whether your dollar came from San
Francisco or Miami. Within the United States, a dollar is a dollar. Suppose, though,
that every state had its own currency. There might be a California dollar (with a
picture of the Golden Gate Bridge), an Oregon dollar (showing pictures of tall
trees), and a Florida dollar (showing Disney World, of course). In principle, these
dollars might trade at different rates, depending on the demand and supply of one
state s dollar relative to the supply and demand for another state s dollar. For exam-
ple, the Texas dollar might be worth more than the Michigan dollar, trading for
1.2 Michigan dollars.
Think how much more complicated it would be to do business. To buy goods
from a mail-order company in Maine, you would have to find out the exchange rate
between your states dollar and the Maine dollar. Any large business operating in all
50 states would be overwhelmed trying to keep track of all the exchange rate move-
ments across the states. The economy would become less efficient because individuals
and businesses would have to focus a lot of their attention on exchange rates.
These same ideas apply across nations. Wouldn t it be nice if all countries either
used the same currency or fixed their exchange rates against one another so that no
one would have to worry about exchange rate movements? Currency systems in
which governments try to keep constant the values of their currencies against one
another are called fixed exchange rate systems. After World War II, the countries
of the world operated under a fixed exchange system known as Bretton Woods. The
Bretton Woods system was named after the town in New Hampshire where repre-
sentatives of each nation met in 1944 and agreed to adopt this system. The system
centered on the United States: All countries fixed or pegged their currencies against
the U.S. dollar.
In a typical fixed exchange rate system, every country that pegs its rate to a central
countrys exchange rate must intervene in the foreign exchange market when neces-
sary to keep its exchange rate constant. For example, a government would have to
intervene if, at the fixed exchange rate, the private demand and supply for its currency
were unequal.

CHAPTER 19
THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE
400
BALANCE OF PAYMENTS DEFICITS AND SURPLUSES
Suppose the supply of a
country s currency exceeds the demand at the fixed exchange rate. An excess sup-
ply of a country s currency at the fixed exchange rate is known as a balance of pay-
ments deficit. A balance of payments deficit will occur whenever there is a
deficit on the current account that is not matched by net sales of assets to foreign-
ers by the private sector. For example, a current account deficit of $100 billion
with net sales of assets to foreigners of only $80 billion would mean that there is
an excess supply of $20 billion. With an excess supply of a country s currency in
the currency market, that currency would fall in value without any intervention.
To prevent the currency from depreciating in value and to maintain the fixed
exchange rate, the government would have to sell foreign currency and buy its
own currency. As you saw from our foreign exchange intervention discussion, if a
country sells foreign exchange, its holdings of foreign exchange will fall. So you
can see that when a country runs a balance of payments deficit, it has decreased its
holdings of foreign exchange.
It s also very possible that the demand for a countrys currency will exceed its sup-
ply at the fixed exchange rate. An excess demand for a countrys currency at the fixed
exchange rate is known as a balance of payments surplus. A balance of payments
surplus arises when there is a current account surplus that is not matched by net pur-
chases of foreign assets by the private sector. With an excess demand for a countrys
currency, it will rise in value without any intervention. To prevent its currency from
appreciating
to maintain the fixed exchange rate, in other words
the government
will have to buy foreign currency and sell its own. Because it is buying foreign
exchange, its holdings of foreign exchange will increase. From this discussion, you
should be able to see that when a country runs a balance of payments surplus, it has
increased its holding of foreign exchange.
Under a fixed exchange rate system, countries that run persistent balance of pay-
ments deficits or balance of payments surpluses must take corrective actions. If domes-
tic policy actions, such as changing taxes, government spending, or the money supply,
do not cure the problem, a country will eventually have to change the level at which the
exchange rate is fixed. A country that faces a balance of payments deficit can lower the
value at which the currency is pegged to increase its net exports, a process called
devaluation. Conversely, a country that faces a balance of payments surplus can
increase the value at which its currency is pegged and reduce its net exports, a process
called revaluation.
The U.S. Experience with Fixed and Flexible Exchange Rates
As we discussed earlier, after World War II the countries of the world adopted the
Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system. In the 1970s, the Bretton Woods system
was replaced by the current system
a flexible exchange rate system
in which supply
and demand primarily determine exchange rates.
If a fixed exchange rate system makes it easier to trade, why did it break down in
the early 1970s? Fixed exchange rate systems provide benefits, but they require coun-
tries to maintain similar economic policies
especially to maintain similar inflation
rates and interest rates. To understand this, suppose the exchange rate between the
United States and Germany were fixed, but the United States has an annual inflation
rate of 6 percent compared to 0 percent in Germany. Because prices in the United
States would be rising by 6 percent per year, the U.S. real exchange rate against
Germany would also be increasing at 6 percent per year. This difference in their real
exchange rates over time would cause a trade deficit to emerge in the United States as
U.S. goods became more expensive on world markets
including in Germany. As long
as the differences in inflation continued and the exchange rate remained fixed, the U.S.
real exchange rate would continue to appreciate, and the U.S. trade deficit would grow

even worse. Clearly, this course of events would have to be halted under an agreed-
upon fixed exchange rate system.
In the late 1960s, inflation in the United States began to exceed inflation in other
countries, and a U.S. balance of payments deficit emerged
just as in our example. In
1971, President Nixon surprised the world and devalued the U.S. dollar against the
currencies of all the other countries. This was a sharp departure from the rules under-
lying Bretton Woods. Nixon hoped that a one-time devaluation of the dollar would
alleviate the U.S. balance of payments deficit and maintain the underlying system of
fixed exchange rates.
However, the U.S. devaluation did not stop the U.S. balance of payments
deficit. Germany tried to maintain the mark s fixed exchange rate with the U.S.
dollar by purchasing U.S. dollars in the foreign exchange market. What Germany
was doing was importing inflation from the United States. With the U.S. balance
of payments deficit continuing, Germany was required to buy U.S. dollars to keep
the mark from appreciating. Germany bought U.S. dollars with German marks.
Those German marks were then put into circulation. The German supply of marks
in Germany therefore increased, and this increase in marks raised the inflation rate
in Germany.
Private-sector investors knew that Germany did not wish to run persistent trade
surpluses and import U.S. inflation. They bet that Germany would revalue the mark
against the dollar
that is, raise the value of the mark against the dollar. They
bought massive amounts of German assets, trading their dollars for marks to pur-
chase them because they thought the mark s value would eventually sharply increase.
Their actions forced the German government to buy even more dollars to force the
price of the mark upward and keep it pegged to the dollar. The resulting flow of
financial capital into Germany was so massive that the German government eventu-
ally gave up all attempts to keep its exchange rate fixed to the dollar. Instead, it let
the exchange rate be determined in the free market. This was the end of the Bretton
Woods system.
Exchange Rate Systems Today
The flexible exchange rate system has worked well enough since the breakdown of
Bretton Woods. World trade has grown at a rapid rate. Moreover, the flexible
exchange rate system has seamlessly managed many diverse situations, including two
major oil shocks in the 1970s, large U.S. budget deficits in the 1980s, and large
Japanese and Chinese current account surpluses in the last two decades.
During the Bretton Woods period, many countries placed restrictions on the
flows of financial capital by, for example, not allowing their residents to purchase for-
eign assets or by limiting foreigners  purchases of domestic assets. By the 1970s, these
restrictions began to be eliminated, and private-sector transactions in assets grew
rapidly. With massive amounts of funds being traded in financial markets, it becomes
very difficult to fix, or peg, an exchange rate.
Nonetheless, countries whose economies are closely tied together might want the
advantages of fixed exchange rates. One way to avoid some of the difficulties of fixing
exchange rates between countries is to abolish individual currencies and establish a
single currency. This is precisely what a group of European countries decided to do.
They adopted a single currency, the euro, throughout Europe and a single central
bank to control the supply of the currency. With a single currency, European coun-
tries hope to capture the benefits of serving a large market like the United States does
with its single currency.
The United Kingdom, Denmark, and Sweden decided to remain outside this
European single currency system. Their currencies, like the U.S. dollar and the
Japanese yen, now float against each of the other currencies and the euro. Many other

CHAPTER 19

countries have tied their exchange rate to either the dollar or the yen. Some econo-
mists believe that the world will eventually settle into three large currency blocs: the
euro, the dollar, and the yen.
MANAGING FINANCIAL CRISES
Hardly a year goes by without some international financial crisis. In 1994 Mexico
experienced a severe financial crisis. In 1997 the Asian economic crisis began. The
Argentinean economy collapsed in 2002. How do these crises originate? What poli-
cies can be followed to prevent or alleviate them?
Let s first consider the Mexican case. During the late 1980s and early 1990s,
Mexico decided to fix, or peg, its exchange to the U.S. dollar. Mexicos goal was to sig-
nal to investors throughout the world that it was serious about controlling inflation
and would take the steps needed to keep its inflation rates in line with that of the
United States. Mexico also opened up its markets to let in foreign investors. The
country seemed to be on a solid path to development.
However, in some sense, the policies proved to be too successful in encouraging
foreign investment. As funds poured into the country, the demand for goods
increased, and prices started to rise. This rise in prices caused an increase in Mexico s

A DOWNSIDE TO THE EURO
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: How did the 2008 financial crisis lead to
problems for some countries in the Euro-zone?
When the euro was launched, countries with typically weaker currencies or fiscal dis-
cipline benefited from the discipline of one currency and a strong, single central bank.
No longer would investors fear, for example, that Greece or Spain would pursue infla-
tionary monetary polices, as monetary policy was decided by the European Central
Bank. As a consequence, the stability created by the euro with the strong influence of
Germany
recognized for its monetary and fiscal prudence
benefited the tradition-
ally weaker countries.
As investment picked up worldwide in 2003, funds poured into a wide range of
countries in the Euro-zone, fueling real estate and construction booms in Ireland
and Spain, and financing a wide range of projects in Italy and Greece. As their
economies boomed, prices and wages were driven up substantially. But when the
investment boom came to a crashing end, these countries needed to make adjust-
ments as their wage and price structure was out of line. But their options were lim-
ited because, as members of the Euro-zone, they could not depreciate their
currencies. As a result, they were faced with the prospect of either making major
budgetary adjustments, cutting spending or raising taxes, or a prolonged period of
unemployment to reduce wages and prices. In 2010 Greece faced a major financial
crisis as its budgetary imbalance was particularly severe and investors demanded
major readjustments. A currency depreciation would have been a much easier solu-
tion for Greece in this situation, but this was no longer possible. This is a downside
to a single currency for a collection of countries whose economies and political cul-
tures differ sharply.

real exchange rate, and the rise in the real exchange rate caused a large trade deficit
to emerge.
Initially, the trade deficit did not cause any difficulties for the Mexican govern-
ment. Because foreign investors were willingly trading foreign currencies for
Mexican pesos to buy Mexican securities, the government in Mexico did not have
any problem maintaining its pegged exchange rate with the United States.
Although the Mexicans were importing more than they were exporting, at this
point they could still obtain the dollars they needed to finance the trade imbalance
from foreign investors who were purchasing Mexican securities. The government
did not have to intervene in the foreign exchange market to keep the price of the
peso constant against the dollar. In other words, Mexico did not have a balance of
payments deficit.
But then internal political difficulties ensued. Following an assassination of a
political candidate and a rural uprising, foreign investors started to pull their funds
out of Mexico. At this point, the Mexican government made a crucial mistake.
Instead of trying to reduce its trade deficit by taking steps to reduce prices, it allowed
the trade deficit to continue. Moreover, both the government and the private sector
began to find that they had to borrow in dollars because foreign investors thought
A P P L I C AT I O N 4
THE ARGENTINE FINANCIAL CRISIS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: What are the causes of financial collapses
that occur throughout the globe?
During the late 1980s, Argentina suffered from hyperinflation. As part of its finan-
cial reforms, it pegged its currency to the U.S. dollar, making pesos convertible
into dollars. To issue pesos, the central bank had to have an equal amount of dollars,
or its equivalent in other hard currencies, on hand. Some economists believed this
reform would bring stability to the financial system. Unfortunately, they were
proved wrong.
The financial and other institutional reforms worked well in the early 1990s, but
then several problems developed. As the dollar appreciated sharply on world markets
after 1995, Argentina began to suffer from a large trade deficit because its currency was
pegged to the dollar. Essentially, the United States  rising currency became Argentinas
problem. Wage increases also pushed up the real exchange rate, exacerbating the trade
deficit. The Argentinean government
including its provincial governments
found it
difficult to control spending and had to borrow extensively from abroad in dollar-
denominated loans. Then in 1999, Brazil devalued its currency, putting additional
pressure on neighboring Argentina. As investors saw the persistent trade and govern-
ment deficits that were occurring in Argentina, they became doubtful that the country
could repay its debts and feared its currency would be devaluated. Local citizens also
became fearful of a devaluation and tried to convert their pesos into dollars, further
deepening the problem.
Eventually, Argentina was forced to default on its international debt in 2002 and
freeze bank accounts. Middle-class Argentineans who still had funds in their banks
suffered a sharp decrease in their wealth. A severe economic downturn ensued. The
hopes of the reforms in the early 1990s had become a bitter memory. However, the
Argentinean economy proved resilient and began a recovery over the next several
years.
Related to Exercise 5.5.

Mexico might be forced to devalue the peso. If a devaluation were to occur, any
lender of pesos would suffer a loss because the debt would be repaid at a lower
exchange rate. Consequently, Mexican borrowers were forced to borrow in loans
denominated in dollars.
Eventually, more political turmoil caused investors to pull out their funds,
selling pesos for dollars. The Mexican central bank spent nearly $50 billion buy-
ing these pesos in an effort to keep the exchange rate constant. The $50 billion
was not enough. Mexico ran out of dollars. Because it could no longer buy pesos
to maintain the exchange rate, Mexico had to devalue, putting the peso more in
line with its market value. The devaluation created even more turmoil because the
government and the private sector had borrowed billions in dollars. When the
peso was devalued against the dollar, the burden of these debts measured in pesos
increased sharply, so more pesos were needed to pay the dollar-denominated
debts. Mexico faced the prospect of massive bankruptcies and the potential col-
lapse of its economy.
To prevent a financial collapse that could easily have spread to many other devel-
oping countries, the U.S. government (along with other international financial insti-
tutions) arranged for Mexico to borrow dollars with an extended period for
repayment. This allowed Mexican banks and corporations to avoid bankruptcies and
prevented a major disaster. In 1996, the Mexican government was able to pay off
nearly three-fourths of the loan from the United States.
The Asian crisis had a similar flavor. Economic growth had been remarkable in
Asia for over 20 years, improving to a great extent the standard of living of millions of
people. In the early 1990s, several Asian countries began to open up their capital mar-
kets to foreign investors and borrow extensively from abroad. Billions of dollars
poured into Asia. In many cases, there was little financial supervision, and many of the
investments proved to be unwise. Companies in both Thailand and South Korea
began to lose money. Domestic investors and world investors suddenly became pes-
simistic and pulled their funds out of South Korea and Thailand, among other Asian
countries. The withdrawal of funds forced currencies throughout Asia to be devalued.
Because many businesses had borrowed in dollars, the devaluations raised the burden
of the debt and further deepened the crisis, taking its toll on other countries, includ-
ing Indonesia, Malaysia, and Hong Kong. The International Monetary Fund
attempted to help restore the health of these economies  financial systems, but in
many cases, its policies were ineffective. Some economists, such as Nobel Laureate
Joseph Stiglitz, believe the entire Asian crisis was an example of market overreaction
and could have been avoided by bolder action from world organizations and devel-
oped countries.
Even when a country takes strong, institutional steps to peg its currency, a col-
lapse is still possible.
These examples highlight some of the many factors that can bring about financial
crises. In vast global capital markets, funds can move quickly from country to country,
and economic policies sometimes do not keep pace with changing political and eco-
nomic developments. It can be extremely difficult to maintain a fixed exchange rate in
this environment. The flow of funds, moreover, is often so large that financial failures
can rock trade and commerce.
The countries of the world are searching for a reliable set of rules and institu-
tional mechanisms that can avoid and limit the spread of financial crises. Historically,
the International Monetary Fund has played a key role in assisting countries that
run into financial difficulties. However, in Mexico, the sums were so large that
the United States was forced to take the lead in resolving the situation. In Asia, the
International Monetary Fund did not have backing from the United States, so the
efforts to alleviate the crisis were less successful. In Argentina, rigid adherence to a
fixed exchange rate and a government that could not control spending both con-
tributed to a collapse. As world capital markets continue to grow, governments

THE WORLD OF INTERNATIONAL FINANCE
404

405
In this chapter, we examined
the world of international
finance. You saw how exchange
rates 
are 
determined 
in
markets and how governments
can influence these markets.
You also learned how the
real exchange rate affects the
trade deficit. Behind the complex world of international financial
transactions are these few simple ideas:
1 Exchange rates
are generally determined in foreign
exchange markets by supply and demand.
2 The real exchange rate is the price of U.S. goods and services
relative to foreign goods and services, expressed in a com-
mon currency. The equation for the real exchange rate is
real exchange rate = exchange rate *  U.S. price index
foreign price index
3 The balance of payments consists of three types of interna-
tional transactions:
The current account is equal to net exports plus net
income from existing investments abroad and net
transfers from abroad.
The financial account is the value of a countrys sales
less purchases of assets.
The capital account is the net value of a country s cap-
ital transfers and the purchase and sale of non-
produced, nonfinancial assets.
The sum of the current account, plus the financial account,
plus the capital account is zero.
4 Governments can attempt to change the value of currencies
by buying or selling currencies in the foreign exchange mar-
ket. Purchasing a currency will raise its value; selling a cur-
rency will decrease its value.
5 A system of fixed exchange rates can provide a better envi-
ronment for business but requires that countries keep their
inflation rates and interest rates within narrow limits.

Tall Lattés and the Real Exchange Rate between
the Euro and the Dollar. According to the
Economist, in early 2004 the average price of a tall
latté in Starbucks in the United States was $2.80. In
the countries that use the euro, the average price was
2.93 euros. Because the exchange rate at this time
was 0.79 euro per dollar, the dollar price of lattés in
the euro area was $3.70. (Related to Application 1 on
page 392.)
a. At what exchange rate between the dollar and the
euro would a latté cost the same in the euro area as
it did in the United States?
b. Does this calculation suggest that the euro is too
high  or too low  relative to the dollar?

Energizer Batteries around the World. According
to the Wall Street Journal on August 5, 2008, a pack
of four AA batteries sold for $2.33 in Hong Kong,
$6.05 in New York, and $8.24 in Paris (prices con-
verted to dollars). At that time, 7.80 Hong Kong dol-
lars were equal to 1 U.S. dollar and the euro (used in
Paris) cost $1.54.

New York, Hong Kong, and Paris for the same

b. Are the actual exchange rates too high  or too
low  relative to these calculations?

Why is this a puzzle? Can you think of any possible
explanations for this puzzle? (Hint: Some economists

this data, what do you think the market believes is the
expected rate of depreciation of the Turkish lira against
the U.S. dollar? Explain.

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
Imagine your first job in the marketing department of a
firm that sells a national coffee brand. When your boss
announces a plan to cut the firms coffee price by 10 percent,
you recall from your economics course that the price elastic-
ity of demand for coffee is about 0.30, meaning that a
10 percent decrease in price will increase the quantity sold
by only 3 percent. Doing some quick calculations with these
numbers, you figure that a price cut will decrease your firms
total revenue, so the price cut seems to be a really bad idea.
Are you missing something? As we ll see in this chapter, we
must be careful in applying estimates of price elasticity of
demand to the pricing decisions of individual firms.

CHAPTER 20
ELASTICITY: A MEASURE OF RESPONSIVENESS
410
I
n Chapter 4 we discussed the law of demand, which states that an increase in price
decreases the quantity demanded, ceteris paribus. The law of demand is useful, but
sometimes we need to know the numbers behind the law of demand. That is, we
need to know exactly how much less will be demanded at a higher price. In this chap-
ter, we will quantify the law of demand, exploring the responsiveness of consumers to
changes in price. Suppose your student film society has decided to increase the price
for its tickets from $10 to $11. You know from the law of demand that you ll sell fewer
tickets, but the question is How many fewer tickets? As we ll see, you can use the
concept of elasticity to predict how many tickets you ll sell and how much money
you ll collect in total.
Switching to the supply side of the market, the law of supply tells us that an
increase in price increases the quantity supplied, ceteris paribus. Sometimes the ques-
tion is By how much?  We ll quantify the law of supply, showing how to predict just
how much more of a product will be supplied at a higher price. For example, if the
world price of oil increases from $70 to $80 per barrel, we know from the law of sup-
ply that domestic producers will supply more oil, but the question is How much
more?  We can use the concept of elasticity to predict how much more domestic oil
will be supplied at the higher price.
THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND
The price elasticity of demand (Ed) measures the responsiveness of the quantity
demanded to changes in price. To compute the price elasticity of demand, we divide
the percentage change in the quantity demanded by the percentage change in price,
and then take the absolute value of the ratio:
The vertical bars indicate that we take the absolute value of the ratio, so the price elas-
ticity is always a positive number. For example, suppose the price of milk increases by
10 percent and the quantity demanded decreases by 15 percent. The price elasticity of
demand is 1.5:
The law of demand tells us that price and quantity demanded move in opposite
directions. Therefore, the percentage change in quantity will always have the oppo-
site sign of the percentage change in price. In our example, a positive 10 percent
change in price results in a negative 15 percent change in quantity. The ratio of the
percentage changes is
1.50, and taking the absolute value of this ratio, the elasticity
is 1.50. Although it is conventional to use the absolute value to compute the price
elasticity, the practice is not universal. So you may encounter a negative price elastic-
ity, which means that the elasticity is reported as its numerical value rather than its
absolute value.
When the price elasticity is listed as a positive number, the interpretation of the
elasticity is straightforward. If the elasticity number is large, it means that the demand
for the product is very elastic, or very responsive to changes in price. In contrast, a
small number indicates that the demand for a product is very inelastic.

PART 8
Computing Percentage Changes and Elasticities
As we saw in the appendix to Chapter 1, we can compute a percentage change in two
ways. Using the initial-value method, we divide the change in the value of a variable
by its initial value. For example, if a price increases from $20 to $22, the percentage
change is $2 divided by $20, or 10 percent:
Alternatively, we could use the midpoint method. We divide the change in the variable
by its average value, that is, the midpoint of the two values. For example, if the price
increases from $20 to $22, the average or midpoint value is $21 and the percentage
change is $2 divided by $21, or 9.52 percent:
The advantage of the midpoint approach is that it generates the same absolute per-
centage change whether the variable has increased or decreased. The reason is that the
denominator is the same in both cases. In contrast, the initial-value computation is
based on the initial value, so our answer there depends on the direction of the
change
which of the two values is the initial value.
Table 20.1 shows the calculation of the price elasticity of demand with the two
approaches. When the price increases from $20 to $22, the quantity demanded decreases
from 100 to 80 units. Using the initial-value method, we get an elasticity of 2.0, equal to
the 20 percent change in quantity divided by the 10 percent change in price. As shown in
the lower part of the table, the midpoint method generates an elasticity of 2.33.
Why do the two approaches generate different elasticity numbers? The midpoint
approach measures the percentage changes more precisely, so we get a more precise
measure of price elasticity. In this case, the percentage changes are relatively small, so
percent change with midpoint value =
2
20  +   22
2
 *  100 = 2
21 *  100 = 9.52%
percent change with initial value = 22 -  20
20
 *  100 = 2
20 *  100 = 10%

the two elasticity numbers are close to one another. If the percentage changes were
larger, however, the elasticity numbers generated by the two approaches would be
quite different, and it would be wise to use the midpoint approach. In this book, we
use the initial-value approach because it generates nice round numbers and allows us
to focus on economics rather than arithmetic. But any time you want to be more pre-
cise, you can use the midpoint formula.
Price Elasticity and the Demand Curve
Figure 20.1 shows five different demand curves, each with a different elasticity. We
can divide products into five types, depending on their price elasticities of demand.
Elastic demand (Panel A). In this case, a 20 percent increase in price (from
$5 to $6) decreases the quantity demanded by 40 percent (from 20 to 12), so
the price elasticity of demand is 2.0. When the price elasticity is greater than
1.0, we say that demand is elastic, or highly responsive to changes in price.
Some examples of goods with elastic demand are restaurant meals, air travel,
and movies.
Inelastic demand (Panel B). The same 20 percent increase in price decreases
the quantity demanded by only 10 percent (from 20 to 18), so the price elastic-
ity of demand is 0.50. When the elasticity is less than 1.0, we say that demand is
inelastic, or not very responsive to changes in price. Some examples of goods
with inelastic demand are salt, eggs, coffee, and cigarettes.
Unit elastic demand (Panel C). A 20 percent increase in price decreases the
quantity demanded by exactly 20 percent, so the price elasticity of demand is
1.0. Some examples of goods with unit elasticity are housing and fruit juice.
Perfectly inelastic demand (Panel D). When demand is perfectly inelastic, the
quantity doesn t change as the price changes, so the demand curve is vertical at the
fixed quantity. The price elasticity of demand is zero. This extreme case is rare
because for most products, consumers can either switch to a substitute good or do
without. For example, although there are no direct substitutes for household
water, as the price of water rises, people install low-flow showerheads and water
their lawns and clean their cars less frequently. The rare cases of perfectly inelas-
tic demand are medicines
such as insulin for diabetics
that have no substitutes.
Perfectly elastic demand (Panel E). In the case of perfect elasticity, the price
elasticity is infinite and the demand curve is horizontal, meaning that only one
price is possible. At that price, the quantity demanded could be any quantity,
from one unit to millions of units. If the price were to increase even a penny, the
quantity demanded would drop to zero. As we ll see later in the book, firms in a
perfectly competitive market face this sort of demand curve. For example, each
wheat farmer can sell as much as he or she wants at the market price but would
sell nothing at any price above the market price.
Elasticity and the Availability of Substitutes
The key factor in determining the price elasticity for a particular product is the availabil-
ity of substitute products. Consider the substitution possibilities for insulin and corn-
flakes. There are no good substitutes for insulin, so diabetics are not very responsive to
changes in price. When the price of insulin increases, they cannot switch to another
medicine, so the demand for insulin is inelastic. In contrast, there are many substitutes
for cornflakes, including different types of corn cereals, as well as cereals made from
wheat, rice, and oats. Faced with an increase in the price of cornflakes, consumers can
easily switch to substitute products, so the demand for cornflakes is relatively elastic.
Table 20.2 on page 414 shows the price elasticities of demand for various prod-
ucts. The different elasticities illustrate the importance of substitutes in determining
the price elasticity of demand. Because there are no good substitutes for water and

salt, it is not surprising that the elasticities are small. For example, the price elasticity
of demand for water is 0.20, meaning that a 10 percent increase in price decreases the
quantity demanded by 2 percent. The demand for coffee is inelastic (0.30), because
although there are alternative beverages and caffeine-delivery systems (tea, infused
soft drinks, sports drinks, and pills), coffee provides a unique combination of taste and

CHAPTER 20
ELASTICITY: A MEASURE OF RESPONSIVENESS
414
caffeine. Although there is an artificial substitute for eggs (for people concerned about
dietary cholesterol), there are no natural substitutes, so the demand for eggs is rela-
tively inelastic (0.30).
Alternative brands of a product are good substitutes for one another, so the
demand for a specific brand of a product is typically elastic. For example, the elasticity
of demand for a specific brand of coffee is 5.6, compared to an overall elasticity for
coffee of 0.30. This means that a 10 percent increase in the price of coffee in general
(all brands) will decrease the quantity of coffee sold by 3 percent, but a 10 percent
increase in the price of a specific brand will decrease the quantity of that brand sold by
56 percent. Each brand of coffee is a substitute for all the other brands, so consumers
are very responsive to a change in the price of a specific brand. Similarly, the demand
for specific brands of tires is more elastic than the demand for tires in general.
The availability of substitutes increases over time, so the longer the time con-
sumers have to respond to a price change, the more elastic the demand. Because it
often takes time for consumers to respond to price changes, the short-run price elas-
ticity of demand is typically smaller than the long-run elasticity. For example, when
the price of gasoline increases, consumers can immediately drive fewer miles in their
existing cars or switch to public transportation. As shown in Table 20.2, the short-run
price elasticity of demand for gasoline is 0.25. In the long run, consumers can buy
more fuel-efficient cars and move closer to workplaces. As time passes, consumers
have more options to cut gasoline consumption
more substitution possibilities
so
demand becomes more elastic. In Table 20.2, the long-run price elasticity of demand
for gasoline is 0.60, over twice as large as the short-run elasticity.
Other Determinants of the Price Elasticity of Demand
Two other factors help determine the price elasticity of demand for a product.
First, the elasticity is generally larger for goods that take a relatively large part of
a consumer s budget. If a good represents a small part of the budget of the typical

consumer, demand is relatively inelastic. For example, suppose the price of pencils
is 20 cents and then increases by 10 percent, or 2 cents. Because the price change
is tiny compared to the income of the typical consumer, we would expect a rela-
tively small decrease in the quantity of pencils demanded. In contrast, if the price
of a car is $20,000 and then increases 10 percent ($2,000), we would expect a big-
ger response because the change in price is large relative to the income of the typ-
ical consumer.
International comparisons of the price elasticity of demand for food suggest that
demand is more price elastic when the good represents a large part of the consumer s
budget. As shown in Table 20.2, in wealthy countries the price elasticity of demand for
food is around 0.15. In poor countries, people spend a larger fraction of their budget
on food, so they are more responsive to changes in food prices. In these poor coun-
tries, the price elasticity of demand is around 0.34.
Another factor in determining the elasticity of demand is whether the product is a
necessity or a luxury good. As shown in Table 20.2, the demand for food, a necessity,
is relatively low in both wealthy and poor countries. Similarly, the demand for physi-
cian visits is inelastic (elasticity = 0.25). In contrast, the elasticity of demand for luxury
goods such as restaurant meals, foreign travel, and motorboats is relatively elastic. Of
course, not all goods that are considered luxuries have elastic demand. For example,
the price elasticity of demand for weekend canoe trips is 0.19, and the demand elastic-
ity for sport fishing is 0.28. These elasticities suggest that one person s luxury is
another persons necessity.
Table 20.3 summarizes our discussion of the determinants of the price elasticity of
demand. Demand is relatively elastic if there are many good substitutes, if we allow
consumers a long time to respond, if spending on the product is a large part of the
consumer s budget, and if the product is a luxury as opposed to a necessity.
A P P L I C AT I O N 1
A CLOSER LOOK AT THE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND
FOR GASOLINE
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How does the price elasticity of demand vary
over time?
We ve seen that the demand for gasoline is more elastic in the long run, when con-
sumers have more opportunity to respond to changes in price. A recent study explores
two sorts of responses to higher gasoline prices. First, when the price increases, people
drive fewer miles, so there are fewer cars on the road, As shown in the following table,
the elasticity of traffic volume is 0.10 in the short run (within one year) and 0.30 in the
long run (after five years). In other words, a 10 percent increase in the price of gasoline
decreases the number of cars on the road by 1 percent in the short run and 3 percent in
the long run. A second response to higher prices is to switch to more fuel-efficient cars.
As shown in the table, the elasticity of fuel efficiency is 0.15 in the short run and 0.40 in
the long run.

ELASTICITY: A MEASURE OF RESPONSIVENESS
416
USING PRICE ELASTICITY TO PREDICT
CHANGES IN QUANTITY
The price elasticity of demand is a very useful tool for economic analysis. If we know
the elasticity of demand for a particular good, we can quantify the law of demand, pre-
dicting the change in quantity resulting from a change in price.
If we have values for two of the three variables in the elasticity formula, we can
compute the value of the third. The three variables are (1) the price elasticity of
demand itself, (2) the percentage change in quantity, and (3) the percentage change in
price. So if we know the values for the price elasticity and the percentage change in
price, we can compute the value for the percentage change in quantity. Specifically, we
can rearrange the elasticity formula:
For example, suppose you run a campus film series and you ve decided to increase
your admission price by 15 percent. If you know the elasticity of demand for your
movies, you could use it to predict how many fewer tickets you ll sell at the higher
price. If the elasticity of demand is 2.0 and you increase the price by 15 percent, we
would predict a 30 percent decrease in the quantity of tickets demanded:
Beer Prices and Highway Deaths
We can use the concept of price elasticity to predict the effects of a change in the price
of beer on drinking and highway deaths among young adults. The price elasticity of
demand for beer among young adults is about 1.30.2 If a state imposes a beer tax that
increases the price of beer by 10 percent, we would predict that beer consumption will
decrease by 13 percent:
The number of highway deaths among young adults is roughly proportional to
their beer consumption, so the number of deaths will also decrease by 13 percent.
According to a recent study, a doubling of the beer tax from $0.16 to $0.32 per six-
pack would decrease highway deaths among 18- to 20-year-olds by about 12 percent.
Raising the beer tax back to where it was in 1951 would cut highway deaths by
32 percent.
Cigarette Prices and Teenagers
Another ongoing policy objective is to reduce smoking by teenagers. Under the 1997
federal tobacco settlement, cigarette prices increased by about 62 cents per pack, a
percentage increase of about 25 percent. The demand for cigarettes by teenagers is
 = 10% *  1.30 = 13%
 percentage change in quantity demanded = percentage change in price *  Ed
 =  15% *  2.0 =  30%
 percentage change in quantity demanded =  percentage change in price *  Ed
percentage change in quantity demanded = percentage change in price *  Ed

elastic, with an elasticity of 1.3.3 Therefore, a 25 percent price hike will reduce teen
smoking by 32.5:
About half the decrease in consumption occurs because fewer teenagers will
become smokers, and the other half occurs because each teenage smoker will
smoke fewer cigarettes.
PRICE ELASTICITY AND TOTAL REVENUE
Firms use the concept of price elasticity to predict the effects of changing their prices.
A firm produces products to sell, and a firms total revenue equals the money it gen-
erates from selling products. If a firm sells its product for the same price to every con-
sumer, total revenue equals the price per unit times the quantity sold:
Suppose a firm increases the price of its product. Will its total sales revenue
increase or decrease? The answer depends on the price elasticity of demand for the
product. If you know the price elasticity, you can determine whether a price hike will
increase or decrease the firm s total revenue.
Lets return to the example of the campus film series. Suppose you are thinking
about increasing the price of tickets by 10 percent, from $10 to $11. An increase in the
ticket price brings good news and bad news:
Good news: You get more money for each ticket sold.
Bad news: You sell fewer tickets.
Your total revenue will decrease if the bad news (fewer tickets sold) dominates the
good news (more money per ticket). The elasticity of demand tells us how bad the bad
news is. The more elastic the demand, the larger the reduction in the quantity sold
the worse the bad news.
Elastic versus Inelastic Demand
The upper part of Table 20.5 shows an example of the effects of a price hike when the
demand for a product is elastic. In this case, the price elasticity of demand is 2.0, so a
10 percent increase in price decreases the quantity demanded by 20 percent, from
100 to 80 tickets. Because the percentage decrease in quantity (the bad news) exceeds
the percentage increase in price (the good news), total revenue decreases, from $1,000
to $880. In general, an elastic demand means that the percentage change in quantity
(the bad news from a price hike) will exceed the percentage change in price (the good
news), so an increase in price will decrease total revenue.
total revenue = price per unit *  quantity sold

percentage change in quantity demanded = 25% *  1.30 = 32.5%

We get the opposite result if the demand for the good is inelastic: An increase in
price increases total revenue. The lower part of Table 20.5 shows an example of the
effects of a price hike when demand is inelastic (equal to 0.50). Suppose that your cam-
pus bookstore starts with a textbook price of $100 and sells 10 books per minute. If the
bookstore increases its price by 20 percent (from $100 to $120 per book), the quantity of
textbooks sold will decrease by only 10 percent (from 10 to 9 per minute). Therefore,
the store s total revenue will increase from $1,000 per minute ($100 * 10 books) to
$1,080 per minute ($120 * 9 books). In general, an inelastic demand means that the
percentage change in quantity will be smaller than the percentage change in price, so an
increase in price will increase total revenue.
Table 20.6 shows, for different types of goods, the effects of changes in price on
total revenue.
Elastic demand. The relationship between price and total revenue is negative: An
increase in price decreases total revenue; a decrease in price increases total revenue.
Inelastic demand. The relationship between price and total revenue is positive: An
increase in price increases total revenue; a decrease in price decreases total revenue.
Unit elastic demand. Total revenue does not vary with price.

We can use the relationships summarized in Table 20.6 to work backward. If
we observe the relationship between the price of a product and total sales revenue
of the product, we can determine whether the demand for the product is elastic or
inelastic. Suppose that when a music store increases the price of its CDs, its total
revenue from CDs drops. The negative relationship between price and total rev-
enue means that demand for the store s CDs is elastic: Total revenue decreases
because consumers are very responsive to an increase in price, buying a much
smaller quantity. In contrast, suppose that when a city increases the price it charges
for water, the total revenue from water sales increases. The positive relationship
between price and total revenue suggests that the demand for the city s water is
inelastic: Total revenue increases because consumers are not very responsive to an
increase in price.
Using Elasticity to Predict the Revenue Effects of Price Changes
If we know whether the demand for a product is elastic or inelastic, we can predict the
effect of a change in price on total revenue. Here are four illustrations of the revenue
consequences of changes in price.
1 Market versus Brand Elasticity: Recall the chapter opener about the coffee
producer that is considering its price. The question is whether a price cut will
increase or decrease the firm s total revenue. Although general demand for coffee

419
PART 8
is inelastic (price elasticity of demand = 0.30), the demand for specific brands is
elastic (price elasticity of demand = 5.6). Therefore, a price cut on a specific
brand of coffee will increase a firms total revenue.
2 Bus Fares and Deficits: In every large city in the United States, the public bus
system runs a deficit: Operating costs exceed revenues from passenger fares. The
price elasticity of demand for bus ridership in the typical city is inelastic, about
0.33.4 Therefore, the good news associated with a fare hike (more revenue per
rider) will dominate the bad news (fewer riders), and total fare revenue will
increase, reducing the bus deficit.
3 A Bumper Crop Is Bad News for Farmers: A bumper crop of soybeans (an
unusually large harvest) brings good news and bad news for farmers. The
good news is that they will sell more bushels of soybeans. The bad news is
that the increase in supply will decrease the equilibrium price of soybeans, so
farmers will get less money per bushel. Unfortunately for farmers, the
demand for soybeans and many other agricultural products is inelastic, mean-
ing that to sell the extra output, the price must fall by a relatively large
amount. The bad news dominates the good news, so a bumper crop means
less total revenue for farmers.
4 Antidrug Policies and Property Crime: What is the connection between
antidrug policies and property crimes such as robbery, burglary, and auto theft?
The government uses various policies to restrict the supply of illegal drugs, and
the decrease in supply increases the equilibrium price. Because the demand for
illegal drugs is inelastic, the increase in price will increase total spending on illegal
drugs.5 A drug addict who supports his or her habit by stealing personal property
will commit more property crimes to pay for the pricier drugs. In other words,
there is a trade-off: A policy that increases drug prices will reduce drug consump-
tion, but will also increase the amount of property crime committed by addicts
who continue to abuse drugs.
A P P L I C AT I O N 2
VANITY PLATES AND THE ELASTICITY OF DEMAND
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: How does an increase in price affect total
expenditures?
The radio quiz show Wait Wait . . . Don t Tell Me! recently asked the following ques-
tion: Which state has the highest number of vanity license plates? The correct answer
is Virginia, where over 10 percent of cars have vanity license plates such as 10SNE1
and GLBLWRMR. An economist might have extended the question to ask why there
are so many vanity plates in Virginia. Although Virginians may be unusually vain, a
more plausible explanation is that the price of vanity plates is only $10, or about one-
third of the average price in the United States.
Is the low price in Virginia rational from the state s perspective? Suppose the
state s objective is to maximize the revenue from vanity plates. According to a recent
study, the demand for vanity plates in Virginia is inelastic, with a price elasticity of
demand equal to 0.26. Therefore, if the state increased the price, the total revenue
from vanity plates would increase.

ELASTICITY: A MEASURE OF RESPONSIVENESS

ELASTICITY AND TOTAL REVENUE FOR A
LINEAR DEMAND CURVE
It is often useful to represent the demand for a product with a linear demand curve.
A linear demand curve
a straight line
has a constant slope, but that does not
mean that it has a constant elasticity of demand. In fact, the price elasticity of
demand decreases as we move downward along a linear demand curve. On the
upper half of a linear demand curve, demand is elastic; on the lower half of the
curve, demand is inelastic. At the midpoint of a linear demand curve, demand is
unit elastic.
Price Elasticity along a Linear Demand Curve
We can use Panel A of Figure 20.2 to show how price elasticity varies along a linear
demand curve. The slope of the demand curve is $2 per unit quantity. We see this by
picking any two points and computing the slope as the vertical difference between
the two points (the rise ) divided by the horizontal difference between the two
points (the run ). For example, between points e and u, the vertical difference is
$30 and the horizontal difference is 15, so the slope is $30/15 = $2. That means a
$2 decrease in price increases the quantity demanded by one unit.

Elasticity and Total Revenue along
a Linear Demand Curve
Demand is elastic along the upper half
of a linear demand curve, so an increase
in quantity from a decrease in price
increases total revenue (between points
a and b on the total-revenue curve).
Demand is inelastic along the lower half
of a linear demand curve, so an increase
in quantity from a decrease in price
decreases total revenue (between
points b and c). Total revenue is maxi-
mized at the midpoint of a linear
demand curve (point u), where demand
is unit elastic.

421
PART 8
Table 20.7 shows how to compute the price elasticity of demand with three start-
ing points: e (for elastic demand), u (for unit elastic), and i (for inelastic). As shown in
columns B and D, a $2 reduction in price increases the quantity demanded by one unit.
Column C: Percentage change in price. Starting from point e, we cut $2 off an
$80 price, resulting in a 2.5 percent price cut. The same $2 price cut is
larger in percentage terms farther down the demand curve, where the price
is lower. For point u, the percentage change in price is 4 percent (equal to
$2/$50), and for point i the percentage change in price is 10 percent
(equal to $2/$20).
Column E: Percentage change in quantity. At point e, we start with 10 units, so a
one-unit increase in quantity is a 10 percent increase. Moving down the col-
umn, the same one-unit increase in quantity is smaller in percentage terms as
we move down the demand curve, where the quantity is larger. For point u, the
percentage change in price is 4 percent (equal to 1/25), and for point i the per-
centage change in quantity is 2.5 percent (equal to 1/40).
Column F: Price elasticity of demand. Starting from point e, the price elasticity
is large (4.0) because the percentage change in quantity (10 percent) is four
times the percentage change in price (2.5 percent). Starting at point u,
demand is unit elastic because the percentage change in quantity equals the
percentage change in price. Starting from point i, demand is inelastic (0.25),
because the percentage change in quantity is one-fourth the percentage
change in price.

Why does the price elasticity vary along a linear demand curve? It s tempting to
think the elasticity will be constant because a straight line has a constant slope. But
that s incorrect, because we measure elasticity by percentage changes, not absolute
changes. As we move downward along the demand curve, we re moving in the direc-
tion of larger quantities, so the same absolute change in quantity (one unit) becomes a
smaller percentage change in quantity. At the same time, as we move downward along
the curve, we are moving to lower prices, so a $2 price reduction leads to a larger
percentage change in price. As a result, the elasticity (the ratio of the percentage
changes) decreases as we move downward along the demand curve.
Elasticity and Total Revenue for a Linear Demand Curve
Panel B of Figure 20.2 shows the relationship between total revenue and the quantity
sold for the linear demand curve. Demand is elastic along the upper half of a linear
demand curve, which means that a decrease in price will increase the quantity sold by
a larger percentage amount. As a result, total revenue will increase, as shown by the

CHAPTER 20
ELASTICITY: A MEASURE OF RESPONSIVENESS
422
positively sloped total-revenue curve between points a and b. In contrast, demand is
inelastic along the lower half of a linear demand curve, which means that a decrease in
price will increase the quantity sold by a smaller percentage amount. As a result, total
revenue will decrease, as shown by the negatively sloped total-revenue curve between
points b and c. The total-revenue curve reaches its maximum at the midpoint of the
linear demand curve, where demand is unit elastic. In Figure 20.2, demand is unit
elastic at point u on the demand curve, so total revenue reaches its maximum at $1,250
at point b on the total-revenue curve.
OTHER ELASTICITIES OF DEMAND
We ve seen that the price elasticity of demand measures the responsiveness of con-
sumers to changes in the price of a particular good. Of course, the demand for a
particular product also depends on other variables such as consumer income and
the prices of related goods
substitutes and complements. We can use two other
elasticities to measure the responsiveness of consumers to changes in these other
variables that affect demand: income elasticity of demand and cross-price elasticity
of demand.
Income Elasticity of Demand
We saw in Chapter 4 that the demand for a particular product depends in part on
the consumer s income. The income elasticity of demand measures the respon-
siveness of demand to changes in income, indicating how much more or less of a
particular product is purchased as income changes. The income elasticity of
demand is defined as the percentage change in quantity demanded divided by the
percentage change in income:
For example, if a 10 percent increase in income increases the quantity of books
demanded by 15 percent, the income elasticity of demand for books is 1.50 (equal to
15% divided by 10%).
We can use the income elasticities of demand for various products to classify the
products. Recall from Chapter 4 that when a consumer s income increases, he or she
buys more of a normal  good. If the income elasticity is positive
indicating a pos-
itive relationship between income and demand
we say that the good is normal.
New cars and new clothes are products that have positive income elasticities and are
thus considered normal goods. In contrast, if the income elasticity is negative
indicating a negative relationship between income and demand
we say the good is
inferior.  Some examples of inferior goods are intercity bus travel, used clothing,
and used cars.
Cross-Price Elasticity of Demand
We saw in Chapter 4 that the demand for a particular product also depends in part on
the prices of related goods
substitutes and complements. The cross-price elasticity
of demand measures the responsiveness of demand to changes in the prices of other
goods, indicating how much more or less of a particular product is purchased as other
prices change. The cross-price elasticity is defined as the percentage change in quan-
tity demanded of one good (X ) divided by the percentage change in the price of
another good (Y):
Exy =
percentage change in quantity of X demanded
percentage change in price of Y
Et =
percentage change in quantity demanded
percentage change in income
20.5
income elasticity of demand
A measure of the responsiveness of
demand to changes in consumer income;
equal to the percentage change in the
quantity demanded divided by the
percentage change in income.
cross-price elasticity of demand
A measure of the responsiveness of
demand to changes in the price of another
good; equal to the percentage change in
the quantity demanded of one good (X)
divided by the percentage change in the
price of another good (Y ).

PART 8
As we saw in Chapter 4, two goods are considered substitutes if there is a posi-
tive relationship between the quantity demanded of one good and the price of the
other good. For example, an increase in the price of bananas increases the demand
for apples as consumers substitute apples for the now relatively expensive bananas.
For substitute goods, the cross-price elasticity is positive. In contrast, two goods
are considered complements if there is a negative relationship between the quantity
demanded of one good and the price of the other. For example, an increase in the
price of ice cream increases the cost of apple pie with ice cream, causing consumers
to demand fewer apples. For complementary goods, the cross-price elasticity is
negative. Table 20.8 summarizes the signs (positive or negative) for different types
of goods.

Estimates of cross-price elasticity of demand are useful to retailers in their pric-
ing decisions. For example, when a grocery store cuts the price of peanut butter by
10 percent, the store will sell more peanut butter but will also sell more complemen-
tary goods such as jelly and bread. If the cross-price elasticity of demand for jelly is
0.5, a 10 percent decrease in the price of peanut butter will increase the demand for
jelly by 5 percent. Retailers use coupons for one product to promote sales of that
good as well as sales of complementary goods. Armed with the relevant cross elastic-
ities, retailers can predict just how much more of a complementary good consumers
will buy.

I CAN FIND THAT ELASTICITY IN FOUR CLICKS!
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Where do I find estimates of elasticities
of demand?
Suppose you want to find estimates of the elasticities of demand (own price, income,
cross-price) for orange juice. The U.S. Department of Agriculture has a Web site that
provides estimates of demand elasticities for hundreds of food products (from apples
to yogurt) for dozens of countries (from Albania to Zimbabwe). Starting from (http://
www.ers.usda.gov/Data/Elasticities/), you are four clicks away from the following esti-
mates of demand elasticities for orange juice in the United States: income elasticity =
2.212; own price elasticity = 1.391; cross-price elasticity for apple juice = 0.908. Here
are the clicks: (1) Demand Elasticities from Literature; (2) Choose Country; Choose
Commodity; (3) Cross Commodity; (4) Submit.
It s important to note two things about the reported elasticities. First, the regular
price elasticity is reported as a negative number and labeled own price elasticity  for
Marshallian Demand.  Second, the reported expenditure elasticity  is similar to the
income elasticity, with the denominator of the elasticity equal to the percentage
change in total consumer expenditure (versus percentage change in income).

ELASTICITY: A MEASURE OF RESPONSIVENESS
424
THE PRICE ELASTICITY OF SUPPLY
We ve used the concept of elasticity to measure the responsiveness of consumers to
changes in prices. We now look at elasticity on the supply side of the market. The
price elasticity of supply measures the responsiveness of the quantity supplied to
changes in price. We compute this elasticity by dividing the percentage change in
quantity supplied by the percentage change in price:
We can use some of the numbers in Figure 20.3 to compute the price elasticity of
supply of milk. Consider Panel A, with a relatively steep supply curve. When the price
of milk increases from $1.00 to $1.20, the quantity supplied increases from 100 mil-
lion gallons (point a) to 102 million gallons (point b). The percentage change in quan-
tity is the change (2) divided by the initial value (100), or 2 percent:
The percentage change in price is the change ($0.20) divided by the initial value
($1.00), or 20 percent:
Dividing the percentage change in quantity supplied by the percentage change in
price, the price elasticity of supply is 0.10:
Es =
percentage change in quantity supplied
percentage change in price
= 2%
20% = 0.10
percentage change in price = $0.20

by 50 percent, implying a supply elasticity of 2.5.

425
PART 8
What Determines the Price Elasticity of Supply?
Whats the connection between the slope of the supply curve and the price elasticity of
supply? With a steep curve, a given increase in price (in the denominator of the elas-
ticity formula) generates a small increase in quantity supplied (in the numerator of the
elasticity formula). In Panel A of Figure 20.3, an increase in price from $1.00 to $1.20
increases the quantity supplied from 100 to 102, so the price elasticity of supply is 0.10
(equal to 2% divided by 10%). In contrast, with a relatively flat supply curve the same
increase in price generates a larger increase in quantity supplied, so the supply elastic-
ity is relatively large. In Panel B of Figure 20.3, an increase in price from $1.00 to
$1.20 increases the quantity supplied from 100 to 150, so the price elasticity of supply
is 2.50 (equal to 50% divided by 20%).
Why is the market supply curve positively sloped? As we saw in Chapter 4, the
market supply curve shows the marginal cost of production. A positively sloped supply
curve tells us that the marginal cost of production increases as the total output of the
industry increases. In other words, if we want to get more output out of an industry,
the price must rise to cover the higher production costs associated with a larger indus-
try. For example, as the total output of the gasoline industry increases, the worldwide
demand for crude oil increases, pushing up its price. So to get more gasoline, the price
of gasoline must increase to cover the higher cost of crude oil. The more rapidly
crude-oil prices rise, the larger the increase in the gasoline price required to get more
gasoline
and the steeper the gasoline supply curve.
The price elasticity of supply is determined by how rapidly production costs
increase as the total output of the industry increases. If the marginal cost increases
rapidly, the supply curve is relatively steep and the price elasticity is relatively low. For
example, if crude-oil prices increase rapidly as the total amount of gasoline increases, the
supply curve for gasoline will be relatively steep and the price elasticity of supply of
gasoline will be relatively low. In contrast, the output of the pencil industry increases the
prices of wood and other inputs used to produce pencils are unlikely to increase by
much, so the supply curve will be relatively flat and the price elasticity of supply will be
relatively large.
The Role of Time: Short-Run versus Long-Run Supply Elasticity
Time is an important factor in determining the price elasticity of supply for a product.
As we saw in Chapter 4, the market supply curve is positively sloped because of two
responses to an increase in price:
Short run. A higher price encourages existing firms to increase their output by
purchasing more materials and hiring more workers.
Long run. New firms enter the market and existing firms expand their produc-
tion facilities to produce more output.
The short-run response is limited because of the principle of diminishing returns.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  D I M I N I S H I N G  R E T U R N S
Suppose output is produced with two or more inputs, and we increase one
input while holding the other input or inputs fixed. Beyond some point
called the point of diminishing returns
output will increase at a
decreasing rate.
In the short run, the fixed input is the firm s production facility. Although a higher
price will induce firms to produce more, the response is limited by the fixed capacity
of the firms  production facilities. As a result, the short-run supply curve is relatively
steep and the short-run supply elasticity is relatively small.

CHAPTER 20
ELASTICITY: A MEASURE OF RESPONSIVENESS
426
The long-run supply response to an increase in price is not limited by diminish-
ing returns because production facilities are not fixed. Over time, new firms enter
the market with new production facilities and old firms build new facilities. As a
result, a given increase in price generates a larger increase in quantity supplied. The
long-run supply curve will be relatively flat and the elasticity of supply will be rela-
tively large.
The milk industry provides a good example of the difference between the short-
run and long-run price elasticity of supply. In Panel A of Figure 20.3, the steep curve
is a short-run supply curve, showing the relationship between price and quantity sup-
plied over a one-year period. The price elasticity of supply over a one-year period is
about 0.10: If the price of milk increases by 20 percent and stays there for a year, the
quantity of milk supplied will rise by only 2 percent.6 In the short run, dairy farmers
can squeeze just a little more output from their existing production facilities.
In Panel B of Figure 20.3, the long-run supply curve shows the relationship
between price and quantity supplied over a 10-year period. In the long run, dairy
farmers can expand existing facilities and build new ones, so farmers are more respon-
sive to a higher price
the supply curve is flatter and the supply elasticity is larger.
The price elasticity of supply is 2.5, so the same 20 percent rise in price increases the
quantity supplied by 50 percent.
Extreme Cases: Perfectly Inelastic Supply and Perfectly
Elastic Supply
Figure 20.4 shows the extreme cases of supply elasticity. The supply curve in Panel A
is a vertical line, indicating that regardless of price, the quantity supplied is 50 units.
This is the case of perfectly inelastic supply, with a price elasticity of supply equal
to zero. The numerator in the elasticity expression (the percentage change in quan-
tity supplied) is zero, regardless of the percentage change in the price of the good.
Land is an example of a product that has a perfectly inelastic supply. In the words of
American humorist and author Will Rogers, The trouble with land is that they re
not making it any more.
The supply curve in Panel B of Figure 20.4 is a horizontal line, indicating that
the quantity supplied is infinitely responsive to any change in price. This is the case
of perfectly elastic supply, with a price elasticity of supply equal to infinity. The

PART 8
numerator in the elasticity expression (the percentage change in quantity supplied)
is infinite, regardless of the percentage change in the price. One implication of this
supply curve is that if the price were to drop below $4, the quantity supplied would
fall to zero.
What is the economic logic behind a horizontal supply curve? Recall that the
supply curve shows the marginal cost of production. A horizontal supply curve
indicates that the marginal cost of production doesn t change as the total output of
the industry increases. For example, if the production cost per pencil is $0.20 no
matter how many pencils the industry produces, the supply curve will be horizontal
at $0.20.
Predicting Changes in Quantity Supplied
We can use the price elasticity of supply to predict the effect of price changes on the
quantity supplied. For example, suppose that the elasticity of supply is 0.80 and the
price increases by 5 percent. Rearranging the elasticity formula, we would predict a
4 percent increase in the quantity supplied:
As we saw in Chapter 4, many governments establish minimum prices for agricul-
tural products. The higher the minimum price, the larger the quantity supplied, con-
sistent with the law of supply. If we know the price elasticity of supply, we can predict
just how much more will be supplied at a higher minimum price. For example, if the
minimum price of cheese increases by 10 percent and the price elasticity is 0.60, the
quantity of cheese supplied will rise by 6 percent:
USING ELASTICITIES TO PREDICT CHANGES
IN EQUILIBRIUM PRICE
When demand or supply changes
that is, when the demand curve or the supply
curve shifts
we can draw a demand and supply graph to predict whether the equilib-
rium price will increase or decrease. In many cases, the simple graph will show all we
need to know about the effects of a change in supply or demand. But what if we want
to predict how much a price will increase or decrease? We can use a simple formula to
predict the change in the equilibrium price resulting from a change in demand or a
change in supply.
The Price Effects of a Change in Demand
In Figure 20.5, an increase in demand shifts the demand curve to the right and
increases the equilibrium price. We explained in Chapter 4 that a demand curve shifts
as a result of a change in something other than the price of the product
for example,
a change in income, tastes, or the price of a related good. When demand increases, the
immediate effect is excess demand: At the original price ($1.00), the quantity
demanded exceeds the quantity supplied by 35 million gallons (135 million  100 mil-
lion). As the price increases, both consumers and producers help to eliminate the
excess demand: Consumers buy less (the law of demand), and firms produce more (the
law of supply).
20.7
 = 0.60 *  10% = 6%
 percentage change in quantity supplied = Es *  percentage change in price
 
 = 0.80 *  5% = 4%
 percentage change in quantity supplied = Es *  percentage change in price

CHAPTER 20
ELASTICITY: A MEASURE OF RESPONSIVENESS
428
Under what conditions will an increase in demand cause a relatively small
increase in price?
Small increase in demand. If the shift of the demand curve is relatively small, the
gap between the new demand and the old supply will be relatively small, and the
small excess demand can be eliminated with a relatively small increase in price.
Highly elastic demand. If consumers are very responsive to changes in price, the
increase in price caused by excess demand will cause a large reduction in the
quantity demanded. As a result, the excess demand will be eliminated with a rel-
atively small increase in price.
Highly elastic supply. If producers are very responsive to changes in price, the
increase in price caused by excess demand will cause a large increase in the
quantity supplied. As a result, the excess demand will be eliminated with a rela-
tively small increase in price.
We can use the following price-change formula to predict the change in the equilib-
rium price resulting from a change in demand. We divide the percentage change in
demand by the sum of the price elasticities of supply and demand:
The numerator is the rightward shift of the demand curve in percentage terms. In
Figure 20.5, the initial quantity demanded at a price of $1.00 is 100 million gallons
(shown by the initial demand curve), and the new quantity demanded at the same
price is 135 million gallons (shown by the new demand curve). The change in
demand is 35 percent (35/100). The change in demand is in the numerator of the
price-change formula, indicating that the larger the increase in demand (the larger
the rightward shift of the demand curve), the larger the increase in the equilibrium
price. The two price elasticities appear in the denominator. This is sensible because
if consumers and producers are very responsive to changes in price (the elasticities
are large numbers), excess demand will be eliminated with a relatively small
increase in price.

An Increase in Demand Increases the Equilibrium Price
An increase in demand shifts the demand curve to the right, increasing the equilibrium price. In this
case, a 35 percent increase in demand increases the equilibrium price by 10 percent. Using the
price-change formula, 10% = 35% / (2.5 + 1.0).

429
PART 8
We can illustrate the price-change formula with a simple example. Suppose that
demand increases by 35 percent (the demand curve shifts to the right by 35 percent).
If the supply elasticity is 2.5 and the demand elasticity is 1.0, the predicted change in
the equilibrium price is 10 percent:
In Figure 20.5, the equilibrium price increases by 10 percent, from $1.00 to $1.10. If
either demand or supply were less elastic (if either of the elasticity numbers were
smaller), the predicted change in price would be larger. For example, if the supply
elasticity were 0.75 instead of 2.5, we would predict a 20 percent increase in price
(35% divided by 1.75).
What about the direction of the price change? We know from Chapter 4 that an
increase in demand increases the equilibrium price, and a decrease in demand
decreases the equilibrium price. Therefore, the percentage change in price is positive
when the change in demand is positive (when demand increases and the demand curve
shifts to the right), and negative when the change in demand is negative (when
demand decreases and the demand curve shifts to the left). For example, suppose the
demand for a product decreases by 12 percent (the demand curve shifts to the left by
12 percent). If the supply elasticity is 1.6 and the demand elasticity is 0.40, the price-
change formula shows that the equilibrium price will decrease by 6 percent:
To illustrate the practical use of the price-change formula, consider the effect of
population growth on housing prices. The Portland metropolitan area is expected to
grow by 12 percent in the next decade. Suppose planners want to predict the effects of
population growth on the equilibrium price of housing. At the metropolitan level, the
price elasticity of supply is about 5.0 and the price elasticity of demand is 1.0. If the
demand for housing is proportional to population, a 12 percent increase in population
will increase the equilibrium price of housing by 2 percent:
The Price Effects of a Change in Supply
Consider next the effects of a change in supply on the equilibrium price. In Figure 20.6,
a decrease in supply shifts the supply curve to the left and increases the equilibrium
price. We explained in Chapter 4 that a change in supply results from changes in some-
thing other than the price of the product
for example, a change in the cost of labor or
raw materials, a change in production technology, or a change in the number of firms.
The immediate effect of a decrease in supply is excess demand: At the original price,
the quantity demanded exceeds the quantity supplied. In response to the excess
demand, the price increases. Consumers respond to the higher price by purchasing
less, and producers respond by producing more, so the gap between the quantity
demanded and the quantity supplied narrows.
Under what conditions will a decrease in supply cause a relatively small increase
in price?
Small decrease in supply. If the shift of the supply curve is relatively small, the gap
between the new supply and the old demand will be relatively small, and the
small excess demand can be eliminated with a relatively small increase in price.

MILK PRICES IN THE SHORT RUN AND LONG RUN
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: How does a change in demand affect the
equilibrium price in the short run and long run?
We can use the price-change formula to predict the effects of a change in demand on
equilibrium prices in the short run and long run. Suppose a national advertising cam-
paign increases the demand for milk by 3 percent. The price elasticity of demand for
milk is 0.20 and the short-run price elasticity of supply is 0.10. Therefore, in the short-
run the equilibrium price of milk will increase by 10 percent. For example, if the initial
price was $3.50 per gallon, the increase in demand would increase the price to $3.85.
percentage change in equilibrium price = 3 % / (0.10 + 0.20) = 3% / 0.30 = 10%
In the long run, the price elasticity of supply is 2.50, and the equilibrium price of milk
will be only 1.1 percent higher than the original price.
percentage change in equilibrium price = 3 % / (2.50 + 0.20) = 3% / 2.70 = 1.1%
For example, if the initial price was $3.50 per gallon, the increase in demand would
generate a long-run price of $3.54.

ply increases the equilibrium price by 10 percent. Using the price-change formula, 10% = ( 30% /

This chapter explored the num-
bers behind the laws of
demand and supply. The law of
demand tells us that an
increase in price decreases the
quantity demanded, ceteris
paribus. If we know the price
elasticity of demand for a par-
ticular product, we can determine just how much less of it will
be purchased at the higher price. Similarly, if we know the price
elasticity of supply for a product, we can determine just how
much more of it will be supplied at a higher price. Here are the
main points of the chapter:
1 The price elasticity of demand
defined as the percentage
change in quantity demanded divided by the percentage
change in price
measures the responsiveness of consumers
to changes in price.
2 Demand is relatively elastic if there are good substitutes.
3 If demand is elastic, the relationship between price and total
revenue is negative. If demand is inelastic, the relationship
between price and total revenue is positive.
4 The price elasticity of supply
defined as the percentage
change in quantity supplied divided by the percentage
change in price
measures the responsiveness of producers
to changes in price.
5 If we know the elasticities of demand and supply, we can pre-
dict the percentage change in price resulting from a change
in demand or supply.

We can use a variation on the price-change formula to predict the price effects of
a change in supply. We modify the numerator of the formula by substituting the per-
centage change in supply for the percentage change in demand and then add a minus
sign. The minus sign indicates a negative relationship between supply and the equilib-
rium price: When supply decreases (when the supply curve shifts to the left), the price
increases; when supply increases, the price decreases:
To illustrate the practical use of the price-change formula, consider the effects of
import restrictions on equilibrium prices. Suppose that import restrictions decrease
the supply of shoes by 30 percent. As shown in Figure 20.6, the policy shifts the sup-
ply curve to the left by 30 percent: At the original price of $40, the quantity supplied
decreases from 100 million pairs (point a) to 70 million pairs (point b). The decrease in
supply increases the equilibrium price, and the price-change formula tells us just how
much the price will increase.
To use the price-change formula, we need the price elasticities of supply and
demand. Suppose the supply elasticity is 2.3 and, as shown in Table 20.2, the demand
elasticity is 0.70. Plugging these numbers into the price-change formula, we predict a
10 percent increase in price:
In Figure 20.6, the price rises by 10 percent, from $40 to $44 per pair.

beer will reduce the number of highway deaths among
young adults by 
percent.
2.2
Recall the example Cigarette Prices and Teenagers
from the chapter. A 20 percent increase in the price of
cigarettes will reduce the quantity of cigarettes
demanded by teenagers by 
percent.
2.3
If the price elasticity of demand is 0.60, a 10 percent
increase in price will 
the quantity
demanded by 
percent.
2.4
MADD Beer Tax. Recall the example Beer Prices and
Highway Deaths,  from the chapter. The organization
Mothers Against Drunk Driving (MADD) has a goal of
reducing the number of highway deaths among young
20.2
20.1
adults by 39 percent. Assume that the number of high-
way deaths for young adults is proportional to their beer
consumption. By what percentage must the price of beer
increase to meet the MADD target?
2.5
Meeting the Teenage Smoking Target. Recall the
example Cigarette Prices and Teenagers  from the
chapter. One of the stated objectives of the federal
Tobacco Agreement of 1997 was to reduce teenage
smoking by 60 percent. The price must increase by
percent to achieve this target.
2.6
Use the Correct Elasticity. Your company currently
sells 50 units of salt per year and has decided to
increase its price from $1.00 to $1.20. In a meeting,
one person says, As shown in Table 20.2 on page 414,
the price elasticity of demand for salt is 0.10, so if we
increase the price of salt by 20 percent, the quantity
demanded will decrease by 2 percent.  Whats wrong
with this statement?
2.7
Projecting Transit Ridership. As a transit planner,
your job is to predict ridership and total fare revenue.
Suppose the short-run elasticity of demand for com-
muter rail (over a one-month period) is 0.60, and the
long-run elasticity (over a two-year period) is 1.60.
The current ridership is 100,000 people per day.
Suppose the transit authority decides to increase its
fares from $2.00 to $2.20.
a. Predict the changes in train ridership over a one-
month period (the short run) and a two-year period
(the long run).
b. Over the one-month period, will total fare
revenue increase or decrease? What about the
two-year period?
2.8
Income and the Price Elasticity of Demand for
Medical Care. Like many other developing nations,
Peru subsidizes medical care, charging consumers a
small fraction of the cost of providing services such as
visits to medical clinics. The price elasticity of demand
for medical care is 0.67 for poor households but only
0.03 for wealthy households. Suppose the government
reduced its subsidies for medical care, and the price to
consumers increased by 10 percent. Predict the
changes in the quantity of medical care demanded (for
example, the number of visits to clinics) for poor
households and wealthy households.
Price Elasticity and Total Revenue
3.1
In the state of Virginia, the demand for vanity license
plates is 
(elastic/inelastic), so an increase
in price would 
(increase/decrease) total
revenue from vanity plates. (Related to Application 2
on page 419.)

3.2
A policy that limits the supply of illegal drugs
increases the number of burglaries and robberies

3.3
If demand is elastic, an increase in price 
(increases/decreases) total revenue; if demand is
inelastic, 
an 
increase 
in 
price 
(increases/decreases) total revenue.
3.4
Suppose that at the current price the price elasticity
of demand for a campus film series is 2.0. If
the price is cut, total revenue will 
(increase/decrease).
3.5
Revenue Effects of a Bumper Crop. Your job is to
predict the total revenue generated by the nation s
corn crop. Last year s crop was 100 million bushels,
and the price was $5 per bushel. This year s weather
was favorable throughout the country, and this year s
crop will be 110 million bushels, or 10 percent larger
than last year s. The price elasticity of demand for
corn is 0.50.
a. Predict the effect of the bumper crop on the price
of corn. Assume that the entire crop is sold this
year, meaning that the price elasticity of supply is
zero. Illustrate with a complete graph.
b. Predict the total revenue from this year s corn crop.
c. Did the favorable weather increase or decrease
the total revenue from corn? Why?
3.6
Elasticity and Vanity Plates. Suppose the price
elasticity of demand for vanity plates in your state is
0.60. The initial price is $20 and the initial quantity
is 1,000 plates per week. Suppose the state increases
the price by 10 percent. (Related to Application 2 on
page 419.)
a. Predict the new quantity per week and total
revenue per week.
b. The increase in price 
(increases,
decreases) total revenue because 
is
.
3.7
The Price of Heroin and Property Crime. The
price elasticity of demand for heroin is 0.27. Suppose
that half of heroin users support their habits with
property crime, so the loss from property crimes com-
mitted by heroin users equals half the total spending
(total revenue) on the drug. Suppose the government
reduces the supply of heroin, increasing the equilib-
rium price by 20 percent. Fill in the blanks in the fol-
lowing table.
3.8
Revenue from Mobile Phones. Consider the
demand for mobile phones. Suppose the price elastic-
ity of demand for the market as a whole is 0.80.
a. If all mobile-phone companies simultaneously
increased their prices, will total revenue in the
industry increase or decrease?
b. If a single mobile-phone company increased its
price, would you expect the company s total
revenue to increase or decrease? Explain.
3.9
Price Hikes and Cable TV Revenue. Four years ago
the cable company in your city increased its price by
20 percent, and its total revenue increased. Last year, a
new company started providing TV service with satel-
lite dishes. This year, the cable company increased its
price by 20 percent, but its total revenue decreased.
Provide an explanation for the different revenue con-
sequences of the cable companys price hikes.
3.10 According to an economic consultant, For your firm,
an increase in price is a win-win situation. Your total
revenue will increase and your total cost will decrease.
Therefore, you ll earn more profit (equal to Total
Revenue
Total Cost).
a. Concerning the revenue effect of a price hike,
what is the consultant assuming about your firm
and its customers?
b. Concerning the cost effect of a price hike, what
is the consultant assuming about your firm and
its customers?
Elasticity and Total Revenue for a Linear
Demand Curve
4.1
Demand is 
on the upper portion of a lin-
ear demand curve and 
on the lower por-
tion of a linear demand curve.
4.2
Suppose we are on the upper portion of a linear
demand curve. If the price increases by 10 percent, the
quantity demanded will decrease by 
(more/less) than 10 percent and total revenue will
(increase/decrease).
4.3
At the midpoint of a linear demand curve, the price
elasticity of demand is 
.
4.4
If we are on the lower part of a linear demand curve, a
decrease in price 
(increases/decreases)
total revenue.
4.5
Maximizing Revenue from Wilderness Passes.
Your state issues wilderness passes to people who
hike, bike, and ski in wilderness areas. Its objective is
to maximize the total revenue from the passes. The
current price is $30. The demand for wilderness
passes is linear, and a price of $90 would drive the
quantity demanded to zero. What is the appropriate
price? Illustrate with a complete graph.

Income and Starbucks Coffee Shops. Starbucks
just hired you to determine whether your city could
support a new Starbucks coffee shop. There are cur-
rently four Starbucks coffee shops in the city, and
each has just enough customers to survive. The aver-
age household income in the city is expected to
increase by 10 percent per year for the next few years.
Suppose the income elasticity of demand for
Starbucks  coffee products is 1.25. The population of
the city is constant.
a. By what percentage will the demand for coffee
increase each year?
b. How soon will the area have enough demand to
support a fifth Starbucks?
5.7
Gas Prices and Public Transit Ridership. Consider
the effect of higher gasoline prices on public transit
ridership. The initial price of public transit is $2.00 per
ride and the initial ridership is 100,000 people per day.
Suppose the elasticity of transit ridership with respect
to the price of gasoline is +0.667 (or 2/3) and the price
of gasoline increases by 30 percent.
20.5
a. Assume the price of public transit remains at $2.
Use a graph to show the effect of the increase in the
gas price on transit ridership.
b. Suppose the transit authority matches the increase
in the price of gasoline, increasing the transit fare
by 30 percent. The price elasticity of demand for
transit ridership is 0.333 (or 1/3). Use your graph
to show the combined effect of the gas tax and
higher transit fare.
c. Explain why the net change in transit ridership is
positive or negative.
5.8
iPods and iTunes. You have been hired to predict
the effects of increasing the price of iTunes songs by
10 percent, from $0.99 to $1.09. You are interested in
the effects of the price hike on the number of songs
downloaded legally from iTunes, the number of
songs downloaded legally from other online music
stores, the number of iPod players sold, and the
number of CDs sold in stores. Given the hypotheti-
cal elasticities in the following table, fill in the
blanks. Recall that conventional practice for the price
elasticity of demand of a product uses the absolute

Find the following elasticities from the USDA Web
site. (Related to Application 3 on page 423.)
a. Organic broccoli in the United States: own
price elasticity = 
; expenditure (similar
to income) = 
; cross-price of con-
ventional broccoli = 
. If improved
production techniques decreased the equilibrium
price of organic broccoli by 10 percent, the
quantity of organic broccoli would increase by
percent and the quantity of
conventional 
broccoli 
would 
decease 
by
percent.
b. Soft drinks in the United States: own price
(Marshallian is regular demand) = 
. If
a tax on soft drinks increased the equilibrium price
by 10 percent, the quantity of soft drinks would
decrease by 
percent.
c. Fish in Tanzania. Own price = 
;
income = 
. If the price of fish

increases by 8.37 percent, the quantity demanded
would decrease by 
percent. If per-
capita income increases by 20 percent, the quantity
of fish demanded would increase by about
percent.
The Price Elasticity of Supply
6.1
When the price of paper increases from $100 to
$104 per ton, the quantity supplied increases from
200 to 220 tons per day. The price elasticity of sup-
ply is 
.
6.2
Suppose the price elasticity of a supply of cheese is
0.80. If the price of cheese rises by 20 percent, the
quantity
of
cheese
supplied
will
increase
by
percent.
6.3
Because the principle of diminishing returns is
applicable only in the 
(short/long) run,
the 
elasticity of supply is 
(smaller/larger) than the 
elasticity
of supply.
6.4
As the supply curve becomes flatter, the price elasticity
of supply 
(increases/decreases).

demand for chewing tobacco by 18 percent. The equi-
librium price of chewing tobacco will 
(decrease/increase) by 
percent.
7.2

for motel rooms increases by 15 percent, the equilib-
rium price of motel rooms will 
(decrease/increase) by 
percent.
7.3
Suppose the price elasticity of demand for tomatoes is
0.70 and the supply elasticity is 3.30. If publicity
about an outbreak of salmonella decreases demand by

12 percent, the equilibrium price will 
(decrease/increase) by 
percent.
7.4
Suppose the price elasticity of demand for accordions
is 2.0 and the supply elasticity is 3.0. If a subsidy on
accordions increases supply by 20 percent, the equilib-
rium price will 
(decrease/increase) by
percent.
7.5
College Enrollment and Apartment Prices.
Consider a college town where the initial price of
rental apartments is $400 and the initial quantity is
1,000 apartments. The price elasticity of demand for
apartments is 1.0, and the price elasticity of supply
of apartments is 0.50. (Related to Application 4 on
page 430.)

expected to increase the demand for apartments in
a college town by 15 percent. Use your graph to
show the effects of the increase in demand on the
apartment market. Label the new equilibrium
point b.
c. Predict the effect of the increase in demand on the
equilibrium price of apartments.
7.6
Regulations and the Price of Housing. Suppose
local building regulations increase the cost of build-
ing new houses, decreasing supply by 12 percent. The
initial price of new housing is $200,000, the price
elasticity of demand is 1.0, and the price elasticity of
supply is 3.0. Predict the effect of the regulations on
the equilibrium price of new housing. Illustrate your
answer with a graph that shows the initial point (a)
and the new equilibrium (b). (Related to Application 4
on page 430.)

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
Between 1696 and 1851, England taxed windows. The
tax liability of a household increased with the number of
windows in its house. Property owners responded to the
tax by plugging their windows with brick and switching to
alternative ventilation systems. As we ll see in this chapter,
taxes cause people to change their behavior, so the total
burden of a tax exceeds the tax revenue paid to the gov-
ernment. In the case of the window tax, the burden of the
tax included the loss of light and ventilation as bricks
replaced glass.

CHAPTER 21
MARKET EFFICIENCY AND GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION
438
W
hen making choices, people strive for efficiency, trying to do the best
they can given their limited resources. The notion of efficiency applies to
all sorts of decisions. A household decides how much to spend on con-
sumer goods, how much to save, and how much to spend on a college education. The
household tries to do the best it can given its limited income. A Frisbee producer
decides how many workers to hire and tries to make as much profit as possible, given
the limitations of its factory. A government chooses between shuttle trips and Mars
missions and tries to generate as much scientific information as possible, given its
space exploration budget. As we ll see, economics provides a framework to guide us
from inefficient choices to efficient ones.
In Chapter 3 we discussed the exchange principle, which conveys the simple idea
that transactions make both the buyer and the seller better off.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  V O L U N TA R Y  E X C H A N G E
A voluntary exchange between two people makes both people better off.
In this chapter, we will take a closer look at the benefits of exchange, examining
the experiences of both buyers and sellers. We will see how to compute the surplus or
net benefit from a market and see why the market equilibrium
where the quantity
demanded equals the quantity supplied
may generate the largest possible surplus.
We ll explore the logic behind Adam Smiths metaphor of the invisible hand
the idea
that individual buyers and sellers, each acting in his or her own self-interest, may pro-
mote the social interest.
You ll notice that we use the word may  in noting the virtues of markets and the
invisible hand. A market equilibrium will generate the largest possible surplus when
four conditions are met:
No external benefits: The benefits of a product (a good or service) are confined to
the person who pays for it.
No external costs: The cost of producing a product is confined to the person who
sells it.
Perfect information: Buyers and sellers know enough about the product to make
informed decisions about whether to buy or sell it.
Perfect competition: Each firm produces such a small quantity that the firm can-
not affect the price.
In this chapter, we discuss markets that meet these four conditions. As we ll see
later in the book, when these conditions are not satisfied, free markets don t generate
the largest possible surplus. A market that generates the largest possible surplus is
efficient. A situation is efficient if we are doing the best we can, given our limited
resources. In the case of a market, doing the best we can means getting the largest
possible surplus. When that happens, we say that the market is efficient.
Governments around the world intervene in markets, sometimes promoting effi-
ciency, and other times preventing it. We ll see that when the four efficiency condi-
tions are met, government intervention is inefficient in the sense that it decreases the
total surplus of the market.
CONSUMER SURPLUS AND PRODUCER
SURPLUS
We ll begin our discussion of market efficiency by showing how to measure the bene-
fits experienced by consumers and producers. We ll start with consumers and then
look at producers.

The Demand Curve and Consumer Surplus
Consumer surplus equals the maximum amount a consumer is willing to pay (shown by the demand
curve) minus the price paid. Juan is willing to pay $22, so if the price is $10, his consumer surplus is
$12. The market consumer surplus equals the sum of the surpluses earned by all consumers in the
market. In this case, the market consumer surplus is $30 = $12 + $9 + $6 + $3 + $0.
willingness to pay
The maximum amount a consumer is
willing to pay for a product.
consumer surplus
The amount a consumer is willing to pay
for a product minus the price the
consumer actually pays.
The Demand Curve and Consumer Surplus
If you said thank you  the last time you purchased a book, did you mean it? If you
were willing to pay more for the book than the price you actually paid, you probably
really did mean it when you said thank you,  because you got what you considered to
be a good deal. Your willingness to pay for a product (a good or a service) is the max-
imum amount you are willing to pay for the product. Your consumer surplus is equal
to your willingness to pay minus the price you actually pay. For example, if you are
willing to pay $21 for a book that you buy for $10, your consumer surplus is $11.
The market demand curve shows consumers  willingness to pay for a product.
Consider the demand for lawn cutting in a small town; the market demand curve is
shown in Figure 21.1. The demand curve shows that at a price of $25, no one will pay
to have the lawn cut (point t), but if the price drops to $22, the first consumer ( Juan)
will pay for a lawn cut. This suggests that Juan is willing to pay up to $22 to have his
lawn cut, but no more. Moving down the demand curve, the second consumer (Tupak)
will pay for a lawn cutting when the price drops to $19, meaning that his willingness
to pay is $19. As we continue to move downward along the demand curve, the price
drops below the willingness to pay for more and more consumers, so more people
have their lawns cut.
We can use the demand curve to measure just how much of a net benefit or sur-
plus consumers get. Suppose that the price of a lawn cut is $10, and everyone in town
pays this price. Juans consumer surplus is $12, equal to his willingness to pay ($22)
minus the price. Similarly, Tupak s consumer surplus is $9, equal to the difference
between his willingness to pay ($19) and the market price. To compute the total con-
sumer surplus in the lawn-cutting market, we simply add up the surpluses for each of
the five consumers who buy lawn cutting at a price of $10. In this example, the market
consumer surplus is $30, which is the sum of $12 (Juan) + $9 (Tupak) + $6 (Thurl)

The Supply Curve and Producer Surplus
Producer surplus equals the market price minus the producer s willingness to accept, or marginal
cost (shown by the supply curve). Abe s marginal cost is $2, so if the price is $10, his producer sur-
plus is $8. The market producer surplus equals the sum of the surpluses earned by all producers in
the market. In this case, the market producer surplus is $20 = $8 + $6 + $4 + $2 + $0.
+ $3 (Forest) + $0 (Fivola). The fifth consumer (Fivola) gets no consumer surplus,
because the price equals her willingness to pay. The sixth person (Siggy) doesn t have
his lawn cut because the amount he is willing to pay is less than the price.
The Supply Curve and Producer Surplus
Like consumers, the people who produce goods and services say thank you  when
they sell their products. This suggests that they receive a net benefit or surplus from
voluntary transactions. A seller s willingness to accept is the minimum amount he or
she is willing to accept as payment for a product, and is equal to the marginal cost of
production. For example, if your marginal cost of cutting a lawn is $4, you will be will-
ing to accept any amount greater than or equal to $4. Of course, you d prefer $10 to
$4, but you ll accept as little as $4, because the lower amount covers all your costs,
including the opportunity cost of your time. Producer surplus equals the price a pro-
ducer receives for a product minus the marginal cost of production. For example, if
your marginal cost for cutting a lawn is $4 and you do it for $10, your producer sur-
plus is $6.
Figure 21.2 shows the market supply curve for lawn cutting in our small town.
Let s imagine that up to six people are willing to cut lawns if the price is right, and
each person can cut one lawn per hour. Each person incurs the same cost for renting a
lawn mower but has a different opportunity cost for his or her time. The first pro-
ducer (Abe) incurs a cost of $2, so he is willing to accept as little as $2 to cut a lawn.
On the supply curve, if the price is $2, one person
Abe
will cut lawns. Bea has a
higher opportunity cost of time, so her cost is $4, meaning that she won t cut a lawn
unless she is paid at least $4. So if the price is $4, two people
Abe and Bea
will cut
lawns. Moving upward along the supply curve, the other potential lawn cutters have
even higher costs, so they don t start cutting until the price reaches their higher will-
ingness to accept: $6 for Cecil, $8 for Dee, and so on. The higher the price, the larger
the number of people willing to cut lawns.
We can use the supply curve to measure just how much of a net benefit or surplus
producers get. If the price of lawn cutting is $10, Abes producer surplus for cutting the
lawn is $8, the price he receives minus his cost ($2). Similarly, Beas producer surplus is
$6, equal to the difference between the price and her cost ($4). To compute the total pro-
ducer surplus in the lawn-cutting market, we simply add up the surpluses for each of the

Market Equilibrium and the Total Market Surplus

five producers who cut lawns at a price of $10. In this example, the market producer sur-
plus is $20, which is the sum of $8 (Abe) + $6 (Bea) + $4 (Cecil) + $2 (Dee) + $0 (Eve).
The fifth producer (Eve) gets no producer surplus because the price equals her cost,
and the sixth potential producer (Efrin) doesn t cut any lawns because the price is less
than his cost.
MARKET EQUILIBRIUM AND EFFICIENCY
Figure 21.3 puts the demand and supply curves together to show the equilibrium in
the market for lawn cutting. The demand curve intersects the supply curve at a price
of $10 per lawn. At this price, five lawns are cut, meaning that there are five buyers
and five sellers. The total surplus of a market is the sum of consumer surplus and
producer surplus. In Figure 21.3, the consumer surplus is $30 and the producer sur-
plus is $20, so the total surplus of the market
shown by the shaded areas
is $50. As
we ll see in this part of the chapter, the market equilibrium generates the highest pos-
sible total surplus. Thats why we say that the market equilibrium is efficient: We can t
do any better in terms of the total surplus.
21.2
Total Surplus Is Lower with a Price below the Equilibrium Price
To see why the market equilibrium maximizes the total surplus of the market, let s
look at the total surplus of the market when the price is less than the equilibrium
price. The government could set a maximum price, also known as a price ceiling.
Suppose the government imposes a maximum price of $4 on lawn cutting. As
shown in Panel A of Figure 21.4, at this price only two people cut lawns
Abe and
Bea. Abe s producer surplus is shown by the darkly shaded area between the price line
and the supply curve. For Bea, the price equals her willingness to accept, so she partic-
ipates in the market but gets no producer surplus, receiving a price just high enough

to keep her in the market. Consumers can buy only as much as producers are willing to
sell, so the market consumer surplus equals the surpluses of just the first two consumers
Juan and Tupak. This is shown as the lightly shaded areas between the price line and the
demand curve. By comparing Panel A in Figure 21.4 to Figure 21.3, we see that the maxi-
mum price reduces the total surplus of the market. For the first two lawns, consumers sim-
ply gain at the expense of producers. The maximum price also eliminates the surpluses
from the third and fourth lawns because these transactions don t happen. Therefore, the
total surplus decreases.
The maximum price reduces the total surplus of the market because it prevents
some mutually beneficial transactions. For example, the third consumer, Thurl, is will-
ing to pay $16 to have his lawn cut, and the third producer, Cecil, is willing to cut a lawn
if he is paid at least $6. Thurl is willing to pay more than Cecil requires, so cutting
Thurls lawn would generate a net benefit of $10. If they split the difference, agreeing on
a price of $11, each would get a surplus of $5. The maximum price prevents Thurl and
Cecil from executing their transaction. The same logic applies to the fourth lawn: The
maximum price prevents Forest and Dee from executing a transaction that would gen-
erate a net benefit of $5, equal to Forests willingness to pay ($13) minus Dees marginal
cost ($8).
Total Surplus Is Lower with a Price above the Equilibrium Price
To reinforce the notion that the market equilibrium maximizes the total surplus of the
market, lets look at the total surplus of the market when the price exceeds the equilib-
rium price. The government could set a minimum price, also known as a price floor.
Suppose the government sets a minimum price for lawn cutting at $19. As shown in
Panel B of Figure 21.4, the demand curve indicates that at a price of $19, only two

Price Controls Decrease the Total Surplus of the Market
(A) A maximum price of $4 reduces the total surplus of the market. The first two consumers gain at
the expense of the first two producers. The consumer and producer surpluses for the third and fourth
lawns are lost entirely, so the total value of the market decreases.

PART 8
consumers, Juan and Tupak, will have their lawns cut. The total surplus of the market
is the sum of consumer and producer surplus for these first two lawns, the same as it
was under the maximum price. Again, this is lower than the total surplus that the con-
sumer and producer could have gained, as shown by Figure 21.3.
Whats the difference between the two pricing policies? Under a maximum price,
the first two consumers gain at the expense of the first two producers, whereas under
the minimum price, the first two producers gain at the expense of the first two con-
sumers. Like the maximum price, the minimum price prevents mutually beneficial
transactions for the third, fourth, and fifth lawns.
Efficiency and the Invisible Hand
The market equilibrium maximizes the total surplus of the market because it guaran-
tees that all mutually beneficial transactions will happen. Once we reach the market
equilibrium at the intersection of the supply curve and demand curve, there are no
more transactions that would benefit a buyer and a seller. The market demand curve
tells us that the potential buyer of the sixth lawn cut (Siggy) is willing to pay only $7 for
a lawn cut, and the supply curve tells us that the potential seller of the sixth lawn cut
(Efrin) has a marginal cost of $12. This transaction doesn t happen because the poten-
tial buyer is not willing to pay the cost of producing the good.
Our example of the market for lawn cutting illustrates a general lesson about mar-
kets. The typical market has thousands of buyers and thousands of sellers, each acting
in his or her own self-interest. The market reaches the quantity that maximizes the
total surplus of the market and is therefore efficient. Instead of using a bureaucrat to
coordinate the actions of everyone in the market, we can rely on the actions of individ-
ual consumers and individual producers, each guided only by self-interest. This is
Adam Smiths invisible hand in action.
Government Intervention in Efficient Markets
In most modern economies, governments take an active role. As we ll see later in the
book, government action can be justified on efficiency grounds when one of the four
efficiency conditions listed at the beginning of the chapter is not being met. But for a
market that meets the four efficiency conditions, the market equilibrium generates the
largest possible total surplus, so government intervention can only decrease the sur-
plus and cause inefficiency. A government motivated exclusively by efficiency would
not intervene in such a market, but instead would permit the invisible hand to guide
consumers and producers to the market equilibrium.
So why would a government intervene in an efficient market? Sometimes the gov-
ernment s objective is not to promote efficiency
to maximize the size of the pie
but
instead to slice the pie in favor of one group or another. For example, a government
that restricts shoe imports prevents some domestic workers from losing their shoe-
making jobs. Of course, limiting imports will decrease the supply of shoes, and con-
sumers will pay higher prices. As we ll see, when the government intervenes in an
efficient market to slice the pie in favor of one group, the pie shrinks, so there is a
trade-off between efficiency (maximizing the size of the pie) and distributional con-
cerns (slicing the pie).
What is the role of economic analysis in exploring government intervention in
efficient markets? We will focus our attention on the inefficiencies of government
intervention, looking at how much the pie shrinks. We will briefly discuss some of the
distributional consequences of intervention
how the slices change. The decision
about whether intervention in an efficient market is worthwhile
whether the
changes in the slices are worth losing part of the pie
is made in the political sphere.
Economic analysis shows the trade-offs associated with public policies.
Under some circumstances, groups of people who fare poorly in the market econ-
omy deserve special consideration. If a society decides that a particular group merits
special treatment
for example, workers who lose their jobs because of imports

more direct form of assistance is generally superior than intervention in efficient mar-
kets by the government. One alternative would be for the government to provide
money for workers to get training for new jobs.
CONTROLLING PRICES
MAXIMUM AND
MINIMUM PRICES
We ll start our discussion of government intervention with policies that control
product prices. The government could set a maximum price or a minimum price. In
both cases, if the market meets the four efficiency conditions listed at the beginning
of the chapter, government intervention reduces the total surplus of the market and
causes inefficiency.
Setting Maximum Prices
We ve already seen two different effects of a maximum price or price ceiling. In Chapter 4
we saw that when the government sets a maximum price that is less than the equilibrium
price, the result is permanent excess demand for the product. The maximum price encour-
ages firms to supply less and encourages consumers to buy more. So at the maximum price
there is excess demand because consumers want to buy more than producers want to sell.
In this chapter, we saw from Panel A in Figure 21.4 that a maximum price decreases the
total surplus of the market: Some consumers gain at the expense of producers, and the
total surplus decreases. Here are some examples of goods that have been subject to maxi-
mum prices or may be subject to maximum prices in the near future:
Rental housing. During World War II, the federal government instituted a
national system of rent controls. Although only New York City continued rent
control after the war, during the 1970s rent control spread to dozens of cities.
Gasoline. In response to sharp increases in the price of gasoline in the 1970s, the
national government set a maximum price on gasoline.
Medical goods and services. Some proposals to control medical costs include price
controls for prescription drugs.
In all three cases, a maximum price will cause excess demand and reduce the total sur-
plus of the market.
Rent Control
Figure 21.5 shows the effects of rent control on consumer and producer surplus.
Panel A shows the market equilibrium, with a price (monthly rent) of $400 per
apartment and a quantity of 1,000 apartments. The total surplus is the sum of the
consumer surplus and producer surplus, shown as the area between the demand
curve and the supply curve. Panel B shows the effect of a maximum price of $300 per
apartment. The decrease in price causes movement downward along the supply
curve to point b, and the quantity of apartments supplied decreases to 700. Because
the policy decreases the number of apartments from 1,000 to 700, the total surplus
of the market decreases. For the first 700 apartments, consumers gain at the expense
of producers, paying $300 per apartment rather than $400. Apartments 701 through
1,000 disappear from the market, so the surpluses associated with these apartments
are lost entirely. The decrease in total surplus means that the market is inefficient.
Because rent control decreases the total surplus of the market, the policy gener-
ates a deadweight loss. In Figure 21.5, the deadweight loss is shown by the yellow tri-
angle abc, the decrease in the total surplus of the market. This is a deadweight loss in

Rent Control Decreases Total Surplus
(A) In the market equilibrium, with a price of $400 and 1,000 apartments, the total surplus is the area

the sense that it is not offset by a gain to anyone else. The consumers and producers
who are excluded from the market by rent control lose the surpluses they could have
received in the market. The loss of consumer surplus is shown by triangle cad, and the
loss of producer surplus is shown by triangle dab. Adding these together, we get the
deadweight loss shown by triangle abc.
Another way to see the inefficiency of rent control is to apply the principle of vol-
untary exchange.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  V O L U N TA R Y  E X C H A N G E
A voluntary exchange between two people makes both people better off.
As shown by the points between c and a on the demand curve, 300 consumers are will-
ing to pay between $400 and $550 for an apartment. As shown by the points between
points b and a on the supply curve, there are 300 producers who are willing to rent out
an apartment for amounts between $300 and $400. Although the 300 excluded con-
sumers are willing to pay more than these suppliers require to provide an apartment,
the transactions are illegal under rent control. Because rent control outlaws transac-
tions that would make both parties better off, it causes inefficiency.
Three more subtle effects associated with rent control add to its inefficiency:
Search costs. At the artificially low maximum price, the number of people seeking
apartments exceeds the number of apartments available. Consumers will spend
more time searching for apartments, so an additional cost of rent control is the
opportunity cost of the extra time spent searching for apartments.
Cheating. Because rent control outlaws mutually beneficial transactions,
many people violate the spirit and the letter of the law by cheating. In some
rent-control cities, consumers pay extra money to property owners to outbid

CHAPTER 21
MARKET EFFICIENCY AND GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION
446
other consumers. These extra payments are often disguised as nonrefund-
able security deposits  or as key money
thousands of dollars to get the
keys to an apartment.
Decrease in quality of housing. Given the lower payoff from providing apartments
for rent, property owners will have less incentive to spend money on repair and
maintenance, so the quality of apartments will decrease. In other words, lower
rent is offset in part by lower housing quality.
Is rent control good for the poor? Rent control specifies a maximum rent for an
apartment, regardless of who lives there. Rent-controlled apartments are occupied by
the rich and the poor, so many wealthy people benefit from rent control. In other
words, rent control is ineffective in helping the poor. As we explain later in the book,
the government could use other policies to more effectively improve the economic
circumstances of the poor.
Setting Minimum Prices
We ve already seen two different effects of a minimum price, or price floor. In
Chapter 4 we saw that when the government sets a minimum price that exceeds the
equilibrium price, the result is permanent excess supply. The increase in price encour-
ages producers to produce more and encourages consumers to buy less. So at the mini-
mum price, there is excess supply because producers want to sell more than consumers
want to buy. In this chapter, we saw from Panel A in Figure 21.4 that a minimum price
decreases the total surplus of the market: Some producers gain at the expense of con-
sumers, and the total surplus decreases.
Governments around the world establish minimum prices for agricultural goods.
Under a price-support program, a government sets a minimum price for an agricul-
tural product and then buys any resulting surpluses at that price.
CONTROLLING QUANTITIES
LICENSING
AND IMPORT RESTRICTIONS
What happens when the government controls the quantity of a particular product
instead of its price? We ll consider two policies that control quantities. In the domes-
tic economy, many state and local governments limit the number of firms in particular
markets by limiting the number of business licenses to operate in those markets. Many
national governments restrict imports, using import bans or quotas on the quantity of
a product
for example, shoes or cheese
that can be imported.
The licensing of business by state and local government is extensive. For example,
many cities and states limit the number of taxicabs, dry cleaners, tobacco farms, liquor
stores, bars, and even dog groomers. Some people defend licensing programs on the
grounds that they protect consumers from low-quality products and poor service. But
studies have shown that most licensing programs increase prices without improving
the quality of products and service.1
Another motive for cities to issue licenses is to limit the number of establishments
that could be considered nuisances to some citizens, for example, bars, convenience
stores, and gas stations.
Taxi Medallions
We can use the licensing of taxis to explain how the practice affects the market for taxi
service and other markets in which licenses are common. Panel A of Figure 21.6 shows
the market equilibrium in the taxi market. The demand curve intersects the supply
curve at point a. The industry provides 10,000 miles of taxi service per day at a price of
$3 per mile. Each taxi is capable of producing a maximum of 100 miles of service per

The Market Effects of Tax Medallions
(A) The market equilibrium is shown by point a, with a price of $3.00 and a quantity of 10,000 miles
of service per day (100 taxis and 100 miles per taxi). The total surplus is the area between the
demand and supply curves. 
(B) A medallion policy reduces the quantity of taxi service to 8,000 miles per day (80 taxis and
100 miles per taxi) and increases the price to $3.60 (point c). The producers of the first 8,000 miles
gain at the expense of consumers, but the surpluses for between 8,000 and 10,000 miles are lost
entirely. Therefore, the total surplus decreases.

day, and there are 100 taxicabs in the market. The total surplus of the market equals the
sum of consumer surplus and producer surplus, shown by the area between the demand
curve and the supply curve.
Now suppose that the city passes a law requiring each taxicab to have a license
also known as a taxi medallion
and limits the number of medallions to 80. The city
then gives taxi medallions to the first 80 people who show up at city hall. In Panel B of
Figure 21.6, the vertical line at 8,000 miles of service shows that this policy fixes the
quantity of taxi service at 8,000 miles per day (80 taxis times 100 miles per taxi per
day). The medallion policy creates an excess demand for taxi service: At the original
price ($3.00), the quantity demanded is 10,000 miles, but the citys 80 taxicabs provide
only 8,000 miles of service. As a result, the market moves upward along the demand
curve to point c, where the price is $3.60 per mile of service. The medallion policy
increases the price and decreases the quantity of taxi services.
Licensing and Market Efficiency
The medallion policy decreases the total surplus of the taxi market. In Figure 21.6, we
see that the total surplus in Panel B is less than the total surplus in Panel A. The
medallion policy decreases consumer surplus, a result of the higher price and the
smaller quantity supplied. Producer surplus could increase or decrease, depending on
the shapes of the market supply and market demand curves. In this example, the pro-
ducer surplus of taxi drivers with medallions actually increases by a small amount. As
in the cases of a maximum price or a minimum price, the medallion policy decreases
the quantity of goods sold, decreasing the total surplus of the market. The producers
of the first 8,000 miles of service gain at the expense of consumers, but the surpluses
that could have been gained between 8,000 and 10,000 miles are lost entirely, so the
total surplus of the market decreases. The deadweight loss is shown by the area of yel-
low triangle abc.

CHAPTER 21
MARKET EFFICIENCY AND GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION
448
Another way to see the inefficiency of taxi medallions is to look at just the con-
sumers and producers who are excluded from the market and what they lose. Some
of the excluded consumers would gladly pay the cost of providing taxi service. As
shown by the points between points c and a on the demand curve, many consumers
are willing to pay between $3.00 and $3.60 per mile for taxi service. Although there
are plenty of drivers who would be willing to provide taxi service at these prices,
they can t do so without a medallion. Because the medallion policy prevents these
riders and drivers from executing mutually beneficial transactions, the policy
causes inefficiency.
Our analysis of taxi medallions applies to any market subject to quantity con-
trols. State and city governments use licensing to limit many types of small busi-
nesses. When an establishment such as a convenience store or dry cleaner would
cause a nuisance to its neighbors, the inefficiency of the sort shown in Figure 21.6
may be offset at least partly by the benefit of controlling nuisances. Of course, the
alternative policy is to control the nuisance directly by restricting the location of
the establishment rather than simply limiting the number of establishments. In
general, a policy that limits entry into a market increases price, decreases quantity,
and causes inefficiency in the market. In evaluating such a policy, we must compare
the possible benefits from controlling nuisances to the losses of consumer and pro-
ducer surplus.
Winners and Losers from Licensing
Who benefits and who loses from licensing programs such as a taxi medallion pol-
icy? The losers are consumers, who pay more for taxi rides. The winners are the
people who receive a free medallion and the right to charge an artificially high price
for taxi service.
In some cities, people buy and sell taxi medallions. The market value of a medal-
lion reflects the profits it can earn its owner. For example, the market price of a medal-
lion is over $150,000 in New York City, $140,000 in Boston, and $100,000 in
Toronto.2 In cities such as Chicago, where medallions are more plentiful, the market
price is much lower.
Why don t governments simply eliminate the taxi medallion system and allow free
entry into the taxi market? Because doing so would decrease the price of taxi service
and reduce the market value of medallions to zero. Some city governments are reluc-
tant to eliminate medallions because owners use their political power to keep the sys-
tem (and the value of their medallions) in place.
Import Restrictions
We ve seen that the government can control the quantity of a good produced by issu-
ing a limited number of business licenses to producers. Another way to control quan-
tity is to limit the imports of a particular good. Like a licensing policy, an import
restriction increases the market price and decreases the total surplus of the market.
To show the market effects of import restrictions, let s start with an unrestricted
market. Panel A of Figure 21.7 shows the market equilibrium in the sugar market
when there is free trade. The domestic supply curve shows the quantity supplied by
domestic (U.S.) firms at different prices. Looking at point m, we see that U.S. firms
will not supply any sugar unless the price is at least $0.26 per pound. The total sup-
ply curve, which shows the quantity supplied by both domestic and foreign firms,
lies to the right of the domestic curve. At each price, the total supply exceeds the
domestic supply because foreign firms also supply sugar. Point a shows the free-
trade equilibrium: The domestic demand curve (which shows the demand by U.S.
consumers) intersects the total supply curve at a price of $0.12 per pound and a

449
PART 8
* FIGURE 21.7
The Effects of an Import Ban on U.S. Prices and Consumer and Producer Surplus
(A) With free trade, the demand intersects the total supply curve at point a with a price of $0.12 and
a quantity of 360 million pounds. This price is below the minimum price of domestic suppliers ($0.26,
as shown by point m), so domestic firms do not participate in the market. The total surplus is shown
by the shaded areas (U.S. consumer surplus and foreign producer surplus). 
(B) If sugar imports are banned, the equilibrium is shown by the intersection of the demand curve and
the domestic (U.S.) supply curve (point b). The price increases to $0.30. Although the ban generates a
producer surplus for domestic producers, their gain is less than the loss of domestic consumers.

quantity of 360 million pounds per day. Because this price is below the minimum
price for domestic firms, domestic firms do not supply any sugar to the U.S. market.
What would happen if the United States banned sugar imports? Foreign suppliers
would disappear from the market, so the total supply of sugar would consist of only the
domestic supply. In Panel B of Figure 21.7, the new equilibrium would be shown by
point b: The demand curve would intersect the domestic supply curve at a price of
$0.30 per pound and a quantity of 160 million pounds. The decrease in supply resulting
from the import ban would increase the price and decrease the quantity. As a result,
domestic firms would produce all the sugar for the domestic market.
The import ban would ultimately decrease the total surplus in the sugar market.
The shaded areas in the two graphs show the consumer and producer surpluses that
would result with and without free trade. The import ban decreases the U.S. consumer
surplus, as shown by the two blue triangles in the two graphs. The ban would also elim-
inate the producer surplus of foreign suppliers (shown by the red triangle in Panel A of
Figure 21.7) and generate a producer surplus for domestic suppliers (shown by the red
triangle in Panel B of Figure 21.7). Therefore, the import ban would cause domestic
producers to gain at the expense of domestic consumers. Because consumers would
lose more than domestic producers would gain, the import ban would cause a net loss
for people in the United States.
Import restrictions are often defended on the grounds that they increase
employment in the protected  industries, such as apparel and steel. But the protec-
tion of these jobs increases consumer prices, so there is a trade-off: more jobs in the
protected industry, but higher prices for consumers.3 According to one study, import
restrictions in 1993 protected 56,464 jobs in the U.S. textile and apparel industries at

a cost to consumers of about $178,000 per job and protected 3,419 jobs in the motor
vehicle industry at a cost of about $271,000 per job. A study commissioned by the
Swedish Ministry for Foreign Affairs concluded that import quotas imposed by the
European Union (EU) increased the cost of clothing for the typical family in the EU
by about 270 euros per year. The quotas protected jobs in the domestic clothing
industry, but the cost per job saved was about 41,000 euros per year.
A P P L I C AT I O N  2
SUPPLY AND DEMAND FOR HUMAN ORGANS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: What is the role of prices in
allocating resources?
What is the economist s solution to the shortage of human organs for transplants?
Sometimes governments go beyond simply reducing the quantity produced and outlaw
market transactions entirely. Each year, thousands of Americans die waiting for
replacement kidneys, hearts, livers, pancreases, and lungs. In the last decade, improve-
ments in the effectiveness of organ transplants have increased the demand for used
human organs. Because the supply hasn t increased along with demand, there are short-
ages of transplantable organs. In a normal market, the price would rise to eliminate the
shortage, but because it is illegal to buy and sell human organs, there is no pricing
mechanism to close the gap between the quantity supplied and the quantity demanded.
The conventional approach to the organ shortage is to appeal to peoples generos-
ity, urging them to commit their organs to the transplant program. The failure of this
approach led Nobel-winning economist Gary Becker to suggest monetary incentives

their survivors for the organs they donate and would distribute the organs to hospitals
for transplanting. This proposal raises all sorts of ethical questions and has not been
embraced by many policymakers or health experts.

USED CARS TO MEXICO: 1998 CARS ONLY
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How do import restrictions affect prices?
In 2008 Mexico banned the importation of all used cars except cars produced in the
model year 1998. Before then, it was legal to import used cars 10 to 15 years old, and
enterprising firms purchased used cars at auctions in south Texas for resale to Mexican
used-car dealers. Younger cars were banned to protect Mexicos new-car industry, and
older cars were banned for environmental reasons.
The new law that restricted imports to 1998-model cars caused immediate
changes in the prices of used cars in Texas. The prized 1998 models jumped in price
by $500 to $800, while the prices of older cars decreased. The sudden change in pol-
icy left some U.S. firms with large inventories of cars that could no longer be exported
to Mexico.

PART 8
WHO REALLY PAYS TAXES?
In this part of the chapter, we ll look at the market effects of taxes and answer two
important questions. First, who really bears the burden of a tax? As we ll see, it is
not necessarily the person who actually pays the tax to the government. Second, is
the total burden of a tax equal to the revenue collected by the government? As we ll
see, a tax changes people s behavior, so the total burden actually exceeds the rev-
enue collected.
Tax Shifting: Forward and Backward
We can use supply and demand curves to look at the market effects of taxes. Suppose
that your city imposes a tax of $100 per apartment and collects the tax from housing
firms
the firms that own apartment buildings and rent out the apartments. You may
think the burden of the tax falls exclusively on the housing firm, because that s who
mails the check to the government. But some simple supply and demand analysis will
show why this is incorrect. The housing firm will charge more for apartments and pay
less for its inputs, such as labor and land, so the tax will actually be paid by consumers
and input suppliers.
Figure 21.8 shows the market effects of a $100 tax on apartments. As we saw ear-
lier in the chapter, the market supply curve tells us how high the price must be to get
producers to supply a particular quantity of output. The price must be high enough to
cover all the costs of production. A unit tax increases the cost of production, so we need
a higher price to get firms to produce any given quantity. In other words, the supply
curve shifts upward by the amount of the tax. A unit tax of $100 per apartment
increases a property owner s cost per apartment by $100, so the supply curve shifts
upward by $100.

The Market Effects of an Apartment Tax
A tax of $100 per apartment shifts the supply curve upward by the $100 tax, moving the market
equilibrium from point a to point b. The equilibrium price increases from $300 to $360, and the equi-
librium quantity decreases from 900 to 750 apartments.

CHAPTER 21
MARKET EFFICIENCY AND GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION
452
The shift of the supply curve increases the equilibrium price of apartments. At
the $300 price, there will be an excess demand for apartments, and the price will
increase to eliminate the excess demand. In Figure 21.8, the market moves from
point a to point b: The demand curve intersects the new supply curve at a price of
$360, compared to $300 before the tax. In other words, housing firms shift part of
the tax forward onto consumers, who pay $60 of the $100 tax. Although housing
firms pay the entire $100 tax in a legal sense, they get some of the money to pay the
tax by charging consumers $60 more for apartments.
The apartment tax also affects the people who supply inputs such as land and
labor to the housing industry. The tax decreases the output of the industry, so the
industry needs smaller quantities of the inputs used to produce apartments. The
resulting excess supply of inputs like labor and land will decrease land and labor prices,
decreasing the cost of producing apartments. As a result, part of the $100 tax gets
shifted backward onto input suppliers. Although housing firms pay the apartment tax
in a legal sense, they get some of the money to pay the tax by paying less to workers
and landowners.
Tax Shifting and the Price Elasticity of Demand
The amount of the tax shifted forward to consumers depends on the price elasticity of
demand for the taxed good. If the demand for a taxed good is inelastic
meaning that
consumers are not very responsive to price changes
we need a large price hike to
eliminate the excess demand caused by the tax. Therefore, consumers will be hit by a
large increase in price, and so they will pay the bulk of the tax. This is shown in Panel
A of Figure 21.9. Demand is inelastic
that is, the demand curve is steep
so a $5 tax
increases the equilibrium price by $4 (from $10 to $14). In other words, consumers
pay four-fifths of the tax. In Panel B of Figure 21.9, demand is elastic
that is, the
demand curve is relatively flat
so consumers pay just a small part of the tax. A $5 tax
increases the equilibrium price by only $1 (from $10 to $11). In this case, consumers
pay only one-fifth of the tax.

Elasticities of Demand and Tax Effects
If demand is inelastic (Panel A), a tax will increase the market price by a large amount, so consumers
will bear a large share of the tax. If demand is elastic (Panel B), the price will increase by a small
amount and consumers will bear a small share of the tax.

453
PART 8
Why should we care about tax shifting? We ve seen that a tax increases consumer
prices and decreases input prices, so to determine who actually pays a tax, we must
look beyond the actual taxpayer. As shown in the following application, the subtleties
of tax shifting are often revealed by the objections of people who don t actually pay a
tax in a legal sense.
Cigarette Taxes and Tobacco Land
In 1994, President Clinton proposed an immediate $0.75 per pack increase in the ciga-
rette tax. The tax had two purposes: to generate revenue for Clinton s health-care
reform plan and to decrease medical costs by discouraging smoking. Based on our dis-
cussion of the market effects of a tax, we would predict that the tax would be shared by
consumers, who would pay higher prices, and the owners of land where tobacco is
grown. It appears tobacco farmers and landowners understand the economics of ciga-
rette taxes. Led by a group of representatives and senators from tobacco-growing areas
in North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia, Congress scaled back Clintons proposed
tax hike from $0.75 to $0.05. Although the government would have collected the tax
from cigarette manufacturers, savvy tobacco farmers realized the tax would decrease
the price of their tobacco-growing land.
The Luxury Boat Tax and Boat Workers
A lesson on backward shifting occurred when Congress passed a steep luxury tax on
boats and other luxury goods in 1990. Under the new tax, a person buying a
$300,000 boat paid an additional $20,000 in taxes. The burden of the tax was actu-
ally shared by consumers and input suppliers, including people who worked in boat
factories and boatyards. The tax increased the price of boats, and consumers bought
fewer boats. The boat industry produced fewer boats, and the resulting decrease in
the demand for boat workers led to layoffs and lower wages for those who managed
to keep their jobs. Although the idea behind the luxury tax was to soak the rich,
the tax actually harmed low-income workers in the boat industry. The tax was
repealed a few years later.
Tax Burden and Deadweight Loss
We ve seen that people respond to a tax by changing their behavior. As a result, the total
burden of a tax will exceed the total amount of money the government actually collects
from the tax. To see why, suppose the government imposes a tax on no. 3 pencils,
and the tax is large enough that everyone who initially used no. 3 pencils switches to
other types of pencils or other writing implements. If no one purchases no. 3 pencils,
the tax won t raise any revenue for the government, but the tax still generates a burden
because some people who would prefer to use no. 3 pencils have switched to other writ-
ing implements.
We ll use the fish market to explore the total burden of a tax. To simplify
matters, let s assume that the supply curve for fish is horizontal, as shown in
Figure 21.10. As we ll see later in the book, a supply curve will be horizontal if the
prices of the inputs used in the industry don t change as the total output of the
industry changes. For the fish market, this means that wages and the prices of bait
and fuel don t change as the total fish harvest changes. The demand curve intersects
the initial supply curve at point a, so the price is $2 per pound and the quantity is
60,000 pounds of fish per day.
Suppose the government imposes a tax of $1 per pound of fish, and the tax is paid
in legal terms by producers. As we saw earlier, a unit tax shifts the market supply

CHAPTER 21
MARKET EFFICIENCY AND GOVERNMENT INTERVENTION
454
upward by the amount of the tax. As shown in Figure 21.10, a $1 tax on fish producers
shifts the supply curve up by $1: Each firm now needs $3, not $2, to cover all of its
costs, including the tax.
In Figure 21.10 the fish tax increases the equilibrium price of fish from $2 to
$3. Why does the price increase by an amount equal to the tax? The supply curve is
horizontal because input prices are fixed, regardless of how much output is pro-
duced. There is no opportunity to shift the tax backward onto input suppliers, so
consumers bear the full cost of the tax.
We can use the concept of consumer surplus to determine just how much con-
sumers lose as a result of the tax. Before the fish tax, the consumer surplus is shown by
the area between the initial price line (and horizontal supply curve) and the demand
curve, or areas A, B, and C. When the price increases to $3, the consumer surplus
shrinks to the area of triangle A, so the loss of consumer surplus (the total burden of
the tax) is shown by rectangle B and yellow triangle C. Let s take a closer look at these
two areas.
Rectangle B shows the extra money consumers must pay for the 40,000 pounds
of fish they purchase. The tax increases the price by $1 per pound, so consumers
pay an extra $40,000.
Triangle C shows the loss of consumer surplus on the fish that are not consumed
because of the tax. Consumers obey the law of demand, so when the price rises,
they cut their purchases, buying 20,000 fewer pounds of fish. As a result, they
give up the consumer surplus they would have received on these 20,000 pounds
of fish.

The Deadweight Loss or Excess Burden of a Tax
When the supply curve is horizontal, a tax increases the equilibrium price by the tax ($1 per pound in
this example). Consumer surplus decreases by the areas B and C. Total tax revenue collected is
shown by rectangle B, so the total burden exceeds tax revenue by triangle C. Triangle C is some-
times known as the deadweight loss or excess burden of the tax.

RESPONSE TO LOWER TAXES IN FRENCH RESTAURANTS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: How Does a Tax Cut Affect Prices?
In France, regular restaurants pay a 20 percent value-added tax (VAT) on sit-down
meals, while fast-food restaurants pay just a 5 percent tax on take-away meals. A group
of large restaurant owners made the following pledge. If the nation were to cut its
VAT rate on restaurant meals to 5 percent, the owners would
cut the prices of restaurant meals by 5 percent, and
increase the wages paid to waiters and dishwashers by 10 percent.
The owners predicted that these changes would increase the quantity of restaurant
meals sold by 14 percent and increase restaurant employment by 40,000 workers.
Does the pledge of the restaurant owners make economic sense? We know that
firms shift taxes forward to consumers in higher prices and backward to workers in
lower wages. A tax cut will of course have the opposite effects. The restaurant market is
highly competitive, so any decrease in cost will lead to lower prices as restaurants com-
pete for customers. And lower prices will increase the quantity of meals served, increas-
ing the demand for restaurant workers and their wages. So although the actual numbers
in the owners  pledge for lower prices and higher wages may not be correct, the pledge
is consistent with the economics of tax shifting.

TAXING MOBILE PHONES IN AFRICA
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: How do taxes affect behavior?
It is widely acknowledged that mobile phones promote economic development in less
developed countries. In areas with unreliable transport and postal systems, mobile ser-
vices can lead to substantial improvements in communication and thus facilitate mar-
ket transactions. Many countries in Africa have relatively high taxes on mobile
phones, with handset tax rates above 30 percent and air time (service) tax rates above
25 percent. These high tax rates discourage the use of mobile phones and impede eco-
nomic development. In addition, the taxes encourage the development of illegal mar-
kets as a means of tax evasion.
What are the consequences of cutting the taxes on handsets and services? When
Kenya cut its tax on handsets, prices dropped immediately by 16 percent. A study of
the mobile phone market suggests that a decrease in the tax rate on mobile services
would increase usage and promote economic development. In addition, although a tax
cut would decrease total tax revenue in the short run, revenue would increase in the
long run as the quantity of services used (and taxed at a lower rate) increased.

In this chapter, we discussed
the efficiency of markets and
the consequences of govern-
ment intervention in perfectly
competitive markets. In a mar-
ket without external benefits
or costs, government interven-
tion prevents consumers and
producers 
from 
executing
beneficial transactions and
thus decreases the total sur-
plus of the market. We also
saw that taxes affect the prices
of 
consumer 
goods 
and
inputs. To determine who
actually bears the cost of a tax,
we must look beyond the taxpayer. Here are the main points of
the chapter:
1 The total surplus of a market equals the sum of consumer sur-
plus and producer surplus.
2 In a market that meets the four efficiency conditions (no
external cost, no external benefit, perfect information, per-
fect competition), the market equilibrium maximizes the total
surplus and is therefore efficient.
3 Price controls reduce the total surplus of a market because
they prevent mutually beneficial transactions.
4 Quantity controls (such as licensing and import restrictions)
decrease consumer surplus and the total surplus of the market.
5 A tax on a good may be shifted forward onto consumers and
backward onto input suppliers.
6 Because a tax causes people to change their behavior, the total
burden of the tax exceeds the revenue generated by the tax.

How does the total burden of the tax compare to the tax revenue raised by the
government? The total tax revenue is the tax per pound ($1) times the quantity con-
sumed (40,000 pounds), or $40,000. This is shown by rectangle B: Part of the loss
experienced by consumers is the revenue gain for government. But in addition to los-
ing rectangle B, consumers also lose triangle C, so the consumers total burden of the
tax exceeds the tax revenue. Triangle C is sometimes known as the deadweight loss
from taxation or the excess burden of a tax.
In the example shown in Figure 21.10, we used a horizontal supply curve to sim-
plify matters and make the analysis of deadweight loss transparent. In a market with a
positively sloped supply curve, a tax generates a deadweight loss, but the analysis is a
bit more complex. For students interested in a challenge, one of the problems at the
end of the chapter deals with deadweight loss for the apartment market, a market with
a positively sloped supply curve.

of a tax and the amount of revenue

two visits. For consumers, each $1 increase in price
decreases the quantity demanded by one visit. Suppose
that in an attempt to control the rising costs of med-
ical care the government imposes price controls, set-
ting a maximum price of $50 per visit.

by 3 million gallons.

maximum rent of $150 per padacre, regardless of how
the land is used. Recall the old saying The trouble
with land is that they re not making it anymore.

4.10 Bidding for a Boston Taxi Medallion. In 1997,
there were 1,500 taxi medallions in the city of
Boston, and each medallion generated a profit of
about $14,000 per year. In 1998, the city announced
that it would issue 300 new taxi medallions, auc-
tioning the new medallions to the highest bidders.4
Even with the new medallions, the number of taxis
in the city would still be less than the number that
would occur in an unregulated market. Your job is
to predict the annual profit from a medallion after
the new medallions were issued. To predict the new
annual profit, assume the following:
The cost of providing taxi service is constant at
$2.00 per mile of service.
The initial price of taxi service (with 1,500 medal-
lions issued) is $2.14 per mile.
Each taxi (or medallion) provides 100,000 miles of
service per year, so issuing the 300 new medallions
increases the total quantity of taxi service from
150 million miles to 180 million miles.
The slope of the demand curve is $0.001 per mil-

Barber Licensing. Consider the market for haircuts
in a city. In the market equilibrium, the price per hair-
cut is $6 and the quantity is 240 haircuts per day. For
consumers, each $1 increase in price decreases the
quantity demanded by 20 haircuts. For producers,
each $1 increase in price increases the quantity sup-
plied by 60 haircuts. In the market equilibrium, there
are 24 barbers, each of whom produces 10 haircuts per
day. Suppose the city passes a law requiring all barbers
to have a license and then issues only 18 barber

The Employment and Wage Effects of a Luxury
Boat Tax. Suppose the luxury boat industry initially
employs 1,000 workers and produces 100 boats per
month. Suppose a tax on luxury boats increases the
equilibrium price from $300,000 to $345,000. The
price elasticity of demand for luxury boats is 2.0.
a. The luxury tax increases the equilibrium price of
boats by 
percent, so it decreases the
quantity of boats demanded from 100 to
. If builders continue to employ
10 workers for each boat, the number of boat
workers decreases from 1,000 to 
.
b. Suppose the workers in the industry respond to
the luxury boat tax by agreeing to take a wage cut
that decreases the cost of producing boats by
5 percent. In addition, suppose firms pass on the
savings in labor costs to boat consumers. The
wage reduction decreases the price of boats
by
percent and increases the
quantity of boats demanded from
to
. If builders continue to employ

workers is

b. How does the elimination of the tax affect the

Shifting a Housecleaning Tax. Consider a city
where poor people clean the houses of rich people.
Initially, housecleaning firms charge their customers
$10 per hour, keep $1 per hour for administrative
costs, and pay their workers $9 per hour. Like many
luxury goods, the demand for housecleaning service is
very elastic. Housecleaning workers are not very
responsive to changes in the wage.
a. Use supply and demand curves to show the initial
equilibrium in the market for cleaning services
(price = $10 per hour; quantity = 1,000 hours of
cleaning per week), and label the equilibrium as
point a.
b. Suppose the city imposes a tax of $3 per hour on
cleaning services, and one-third of the tax is shifted
forward to consumers. Use your graph to show the
effects of the tax on the housecleaning market.
Label the new equilibrium as point b. What is the

c. Is it reasonable that only one-third of the tax is
shifted forward? Explain.

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
In February 2010, Apple Computer sold its 10 billionth
song at its iTunes music store. The song, Guess Things
Happen That Way  by Johnny Cash, was downloaded by a
man from Georgia, who was then awarded a $10,000 gift
card for the iTunes store. Apple s online music store, estab-
lished in 2003, was a dramatic departure from the tradi-
tional way of selling music on CDs, with each bundle  of
songs on a CD selling for between $15 and $20. One of
the purposes of launching the service was to provide an
alternative to Internet music piracy for people who wanted
just a few songs, not an entire CD. In designing the online
music store, the folks at Apple Computer applied some of
the basic concepts of consumer choice, although they
might not have realized it.

I
n Chapter 4 we introduced the law of demand and showed how it generates
negatively sloped demand curves. In this chapter, we ll use the theory of con-
sumer choice to provide the economic logic behind the law of demand and neg-
atively sloped demand curves. The theory of consumer choice is based on the
notion that consumers do the best they can, given the limitations dictated by their
incomes and prices. As we ll see, every point on a demand curve represents the best
choice for a consumer.
TOTAL AND MARGINAL UTILITY
We ll start our discussion of consumer choice with the concept of utility, defined
as the satisfaction experienced from consuming a good. Utility is difficult to mea-
sure: We can t hook a consumer up to a utility meter to determine how much hap-
pier he or she is after watching a movie. Nonetheless, suppose we can measure the
consumer s benefit as the number of utils generated by the good (a util is one unit
of utility or satisfaction.
Panel A of Figure 22.1 shows the relationship between the number of songs
downloaded and the total utility from the songs. As the number of songs increases,

total utility increases, but at a decreasing rate. When the consumer gets the first song,
total utility increases from 0 to 17 utils (point a on the total utility curve). For the sec-
ond song, utility increases from 17 to 26 utils (point b), so the second song increases
utility by 9 utils (26 utils  17 utils). Moving upward along the curve from point c to
point d, the ninth song increases utility by only 2 utils (46 utils  44 utils).
Panel B of Figure 22.1 shows the consumer s marginal utility curve. Marginal
utility is the change in total utility resulting from getting one additional unit of a
good. According to the law of diminishing marginal utility, as the consumption
of a particular good increases, marginal utility decreases. In Panel B of Figure 22.1,
the marginal utility drops from 17 utils (point e on the utility curve) for the first
song, to 9 utils for the second song (point f), and so on down to 2 utils for the ninth
song (point g).
CONSUMER CHOICE
Let s consider the decisions of Maxine, a consumer who must decide how many
movies and paperback books to buy each month. Maxine has a fixed income per
month to spend on the two goods, so her options are limited by her budget. For every
movie she watches, she sacrifices three books, and the opportunity cost of a movie is
the foregone utility from the three books she could have bought instead. To decide
how to spend her money, Maxine takes two steps:
1 She figures out her menu of options, the list of affordable combinations of books
and movies.
2 She picks the affordable combination that generates the highest level of utility, or
satisfaction. Her choice will reflect her own personal preferences and tastes.
We ll start with a discussion of Maxines budget options, and then discuss her preferences.
Consumer Constraints: The Budget Line
Consider first the constraints faced by a consumer. Maxine s ability to purchase
movies and other goods is limited by her income and the prices of movies and other
products. Suppose Maxine has a fixed income of $30 per month, which she spends
entirely on movies and used paperback books. The price of movies is $3 and the price
of books is $1.
A consumer s budget line shows all the combinations of two goods that exhaust
the consumer s budget. In Figure 22.2, if Maxine spends her entire $30 budget on
books, she gets 30 books and no movies (point a). At the other extreme, she can spend
her entire budget on movies, getting 10 of them at a price of $3 per movie (point k).
The points between these two extremes are possible, too. For example, she could
reach point b (1 movie and 27 books) by spending $3 on movies and $27 on books, or
point c (2 movies and 24 books) by spending $6 on movies and $24 on books.
A consumer s budget set is the set of affordable combinations of two goods. The
budget set includes the budget line
combinations that exhaust the budget
as well as
combinations that cost less than the consumer has to spend, leaving the consumer
with leftover money. In Figure 22.2, Maxines budget set is shown as a shaded triangle.
She can afford any combination on or below the budget line, but cannot afford com-
binations above it.
It s important to distinguish the budget line from a demand curve. Although the
budget line may look similar to a consumer s demand curve, they are very different
graphical tools. The budget line shows the different combinations of two goods that a
consumer can buy. In contrast, the demand curve shows the quantity of a single good
that a consumer is willing to buy at different prices.

PART 8
Making Choices Using the Equimarginal Rule
Maxines objective is to pick the point on her budget line that generates the highest level
of satisfaction, or utility. To pick the best point, she can use the equimarginal rule.
E Q U I M A R G I N A L  R U L E
Pick the combination of two activities where the marginal benefit per
dollar for the first activity equals the marginal benefit per dollar for the
second activity.
Table 22.1 shows how the equimarginal rule works for a consumer. The benefit of
consuming a good is the utility generated by the good, so the marginal benefit of a
good is the marginal utility. The second and third columns show different points on
Maxines budget line: As we move down through the table, we are moving downward
along the budget line. The fourth column shows, for each point on the budget line, the
marginal utility of movies. As we move down through the table, the quantity of movies
increases. Under the assumption of diminishing marginal utility, the marginal utility of
movies decreases as the number of movies increases. For example, the marginal utility
of the first movie is 48 utils, and the marginal utility of the second movie is 45 utils.
The fifth column in Table 22.1 shows the marginal utility of books at different
points on the budget line. At point b, Maxine gets a large number of books (27), so the

equimarginal rule
Pick the combination of two activities
where the marginal benefit per dollar for
the first activity equals the marginal
benefit per dollar for the second activity.

marginal utility from an additional book is relatively low (6 utils). As we move down
through the table, the quantity of books decreases, so the marginal utility of books
increases. The marginal utility of the 24th book is 8 utils (point c), compared to 10 utils
for the 21st book (point d) and 24 utils for the 12th book (point g).
Columns 6 and 7 in Table 22.1 show the marginal utility per dollar for the two
goods. At point b, the marginal utility of movies is 48 utils and the movie price is $3,
so the marginal utility per dollar is $16. Moving downward through the table, the
marginal utility per dollar decreases because the larger the number of movies, the
smaller the marginal utility of movies. The marginal utility per dollar decreases to
14 utils for point d, to 12 utils for point e, and so on down to 8 utils for point g. As
shown in column 7, because the price of books is $1, the marginal utility per dollar of
books equals the marginal utility of books. As we move down through the table, the
marginal utility per dollar increases as the quantity of books decreases. The popular term
for the marginal utility per dollar is the bang per buck.
We re now ready to find the best point on the budget line. Suppose we start at point b
and see whether Maxine could do better. At point b (1 movie and 27 books), the marginal
utility per dollar on movies (16 utils) exceeds the marginal utility per dollar on books
(6 utils). In other words, movies generate a larger bang per buck (16 utils versus 6 utils), so
it would be sensible to buy more movies and fewer books. If Maxine moves to point c
(2 movies and 24 books), the marginal utility per dollar of movies (15 utils) still exceeds the
marginal utility per dollar of books (8 utils), so she should continue to move downward
along the budget line. She will stop at point e because at this point (4 movies and
18 books), the marginal utility per dollar on the two goods is equal, at 12 utils per dollar:
In other words, the two goods generate the same bang per buck, so Maxine is maxi-
mizing her utility.
We can use the last three columns of Table 22.1 to verify that utility is maximized
with 4 movies and 18 books. Column 8 shows the total utility from movies, which is
48 utils with 1 movie, 93 utils with 2 movies (equal to 48 for the first movie plus 45 for
the second), 135 utils for 3 movies, and so on. Column 9 shows the total utility from
books. Starting at the bottom of the table, the utility from the first trio of books equals
the marginal utility per book (42 utils) times 3 books, or 126 utils. Moving upward in
column 9, the utility from books increases to 234 for 6 books (126 for the first trio of
books plus 108 for the second trio), 324 utils for 9 books, and so on up to 558 for

27 books. Column 10 shows the total utility from movies and books together, the sum
of the numbers in columns 8 and 9. The total utility reaches its maximum at point e,
with 4 movies and 18 books. If we move from point e to point f (5 movies, 15 books),
movie utility increases by 30 utils but book utility decreases by 36 utils, so total utility
decreases by 6 utils, from 657 utils to 651 utils. Moving in the opposite direction from
point e, we have fewer movies and more books, and utility again decreases. In other
words, utility is maximized at point e, with 4 movies and 18 books.
What would happen if Maxine went too far, choosing point f instead of point e? At
point f (5 movies, 15 books), books generate a larger bang per buck than movies. So
she would increase the number of books and reduce the number of movies, in the
process moving upward along the budget line to point e. At this point, the two goods
have the same bang per buck (marginal utility per dollar), so she cannot do any better.
Bundling of Goods and iTunes
The chapter opener described how online music stores provide an alternative to buy-
ing bundles of songs on CDs. We can use the theory of consumer choice to explain the
logic behind this recent development in the music business.
Consider Sam, who has $30 to spend on music and arcade games. In an ideal
world, he could buy music by the song, just as he buys arcade games individually.
Suppose the price of music in this ideal world is $1 per song and the price of arcade
games is $0.50 per game. In Figure 22.3, Sams budget line is the line connecting points
a and d and all the points in between. He can spend his entire budget on games, getting
60 games (point a), or spend it all on songs, getting 30 songs (point d). Alternatively, he
could divide his budget between the two goods. Suppose that in this ideal world, Sams
best point is b, where the marginal utility per dollar on songs equals the marginal util-
ity per dollar on arcade games. At point b, Sam would get 6 songs and 48 arcade games.
Suppose music cannot be purchased by the song but instead must be purchased on
CDs. Each CD carries 15 songs and has a price of $15. In this case, Sam has only three
options: He can spend his entire budget on games (60 games, as shown by point a), or
he can get one CD with 15 songs and also get 30 games (point c), or he can spend his
entire budget on two CDs (30 songs, point d ). All these points are inferior to point b
because they all violate the equimarginal rule. Sams utility is maximized at point b, so
if he must choose either 0 songs or 15 songs, he will be worse off.
In the world of Internet file sharing, Sam actually has another option. He can use
a swapping service to get songs for free. Of course, this swapping is illegal, and Sam
risks a legal penalty and may also feel bad about breaking the law. If the benefit (free

Internet Music Piracy and iTunes
When music is sold as 15-song bundles
on CDs, the consumer has three budget
points (a, c, and d) rather than an entire
budget line. If songs are sold individu-
ally, the consumer has a complete bud-
get line and can legally reach his or
her ideal combination of 6 songs and
48 arcade games (point b).

songs) exceeds the cost (risk of penalties and any bad feelings about breaking the law),
he will engage in piracy.
Consider next the effects of iTunes and other online music services that sell single
songs. Now Sam has a third alternative: He can get his ideal number of songs without
any risk of criminal penalties. One motivation for online music stores is to reduce
music piracy by people who want just a few songs from a particular CD. Of course,
there are other motives for piracy, and music industry experts expect piracy to con-
tinue. But the experience with online music stores
billions of songs sold
suggests
that many consumers are willing to pay for music by the song.
THE INDIVIDUAL DEMAND CURVE
As we saw in Chapter 4, the demand curve for an individual consumer is negatively
sloped. The negative slope reflects the law of demand: The higher the price of a
good, the smaller the quantity demanded. We can use the lessons from consumer
theory to explain the economics behind the law of demand and the negatively sloped
demand curve.
An individual demand curve shows the relationship between the price of a prod-
uct and the quantity demanded by a rational consumer. In other words, the demand
curve shows, for each price, the utility-maximizing quantity for the consumer. We
already have one point on Maxine s demand curve for movies. When the price is $3,
she maximizes utility by going to four movies. In Figure 22.4, this is shown by point i
22.3
A P P L I C AT I O N  1
A TAX ON SOFT DRINKS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How does a tax on one good affect the
demand for substitute goods?
In response to the obesity problem among children and adolescents, some policymak-
ers have proposed a tax on soft drinks, those 150-calorie drinks that are responsible for
about 10 percent of the caloric intake of adolescents. In an article in the New England
Journal of Medicine, a group of doctors advocates a tax of one cent per ounce, which
would increase the price of a 20-ounce beverage by about 20 percent. There is no
doubt that a 20 percent increase in price would decrease the consumption of
soft drinks. Although estimates of the price elasticity of demand for soft drinks vary, a
mid-range estimate of 0.50 means that a tax that increased the price of soft drinks by
20 percent would decrease soft-drink consumption by about 10 percent.
There is some uncertainty about the effects of soft-drink tax on total caloric intake
and obesity rates. Applying the equimarginal rule, the tax will decrease the marginal
bang per buck of soft drinks, causing consumers to substitute juice and other products
for soft drinks. For example, if before the tax the common marginal bang per buck is 12
(equal to 6 utils / $0.50), a 20 percent tax will decrease the marginal bang per buck of
soft drinks to 10 (equal to 6 utils / $0.60). The bang per buck from juice will then
exceed the bang per buck of soft drinks, and the consumer will substitute juice for soft
drinks until the marginal bangs per buck are equalized. Because consumers substitute
other food products for soft drinks, the decrease in soft-drink calories will be at least
partly offset by increases in calories from other food.

on her demand curve. This is the best Maxine can do when the price of movies is $3,
her income is $30, and the price of books is $1.
The Income and Substitution Effects of a Price Change
Lets take a closer look at a consumer s response to a change in price. We will break
down Maxines response to a decrease in price into two effects:
Substitution effect A decrease in the price of movies decreases the price of
movies relative to the price of other goods such as books. As movies become less
costly relative to books, Maxine substitutes movies for books.
Income effect A decrease in the price of movies increases Maxines real income
(the purchasing power of her nominal income), and she will buy more of all
normal goods. If watching movies is a normal good, she will watch more movies.
To show the substitution effect, consider the following thought experiment. Suppose
the price of movies decreases from $3 to $2 and at the same time Maxine s nominal
income decreases from $30 to $26. In other words, her income drops by $4, which leaves
her with just enough money to afford her original bundle of 4 movies and 18 books:
Because the price reduction is exactly offset by a decrease in Maxine s nominal
income, we say that her real income hasn t changed.
If Maxine can still afford her original bundle of goods, will she choose it? We can
use the equimarginal rule to show that the bundle that was the best choice at a price of
$3 is no longer the best choice when the price is only $2. In Table 22.2, the first four
numbers (reading left to right) come from Table 22.1. When the price of movies is $3,
Maxine chooses point e, where the marginal utility per dollar on movies equals the
marginal utility per dollar on books (12 utils). The last two columns show what hap-
pens when the price of movies drops to $2. The marginal utility per dollar on movies
is now higher (18 utils = 36 utils divided by $2), so Maxines original choice no longer
satisfies the equimarginal rule. Although she can still afford the original choice, she
can do better. Given the larger bang per buck of movies, she will watch more movies
and buy fewer books. In other words, given the lower relative price of movies, she sub-
stitutes movies for books
the substitution effect. For example, at the lower price she
might watch six movies instead of only four.
 total spending = $26 = $8 +  $18
 book spending = $18 = 18 books *  $1
 movie spending = $8 = 4 movies *  $2
substitution effect
The change in quantity consumed that is
caused by a change in the relative price of
the good, with real income held constant.
income effect
The change in quantity consumed that is
caused by a change in real income, with
relative prices held constant.

Consider next the income effect of a decrease in the price of movies. To
observe the income effect, we simply restore Maxine s original nominal income of
$30 and see how she responds. In other words, we undo  the $4 reduction in
income that we used to reveal the substitution effect. The change in movie con-
sumption caused by the $4 increase in income is the income effect. When Maxine s
income increases from $26 to $30, she will consume more of all normal goods. If
watching movies is a normal good, she will use some of the extra money to watch
more movies. For example, if she spends half of the additional $4 on movies, she
will watch one more movie.
Points on the Demand Curve
We re ready to return to the individual demand curve shown in Figure 22.4. One
point on the curve is point i, the combination of a price of $3 and a quantity of four
movies. Given a movie price of $3, a book price of $1, and a budget of $30, thats the
best Maxine can do, as shown in Table 22.1. Point i tells us that when the price of
movies is $3, the utility-maximizing choice is four movies.
What happens when the price of movies decreases to $2? The net effect of the
price change is the substitution effect plus the income effect. For example, suppose
the substitution effect increases the quantity of movies from four to six, and then the
income effect increases the quantity of movies by one more. Adding the two effects,
the decrease in price increases the quantity demanded by three movies, from four to
seven. This is shown by a movement downward along the demand curve from point i
to point j. The quantity demanded increases because the relative price of movies is
lower (the substitution effect) and real income is higher (the income effect). For nor-
mal goods, the two effects work in the same direction, generating a negatively sloped
demand curve that reflects the law of demand.
Although we haven t actually derived point j on the demand curve, we could do so
by repeating the process that we used to derive point i. With a lower movie price of
$2, Maxine would have a different budget line
a different set of affordable consump-
tion bundles. To find another point on the demand curve, we would create a new ver-
sion of Table 22.1, and then find the combination of movies and books where the
marginal utility per dollar for movies equals the marginal utility per dollar for books.
That would give us the utility-maximizing quantity of movies when the price is $2
another point on the individual demand curve. In general, each point on a demand
curve shows the utility-maximizing choice for a particular price.
Example: Substitution Effect of a Gasoline Tax
Suppose the federal government imposes a new gasoline tax of $2 per gallon and
simultaneously cuts income taxes. For the average taxpayer, the two changes in tax
policy exactly offset each other, leaving total taxes and net income unchanged. How
will this change in tax policy affect gasoline consumption?
We can use a simple example to show the consumer response to the tax changes.
Suppose the initial price of gasoline (before the tax) is $4 per gallon and the price of
another good such as a song purchased online, is $1. Consider a representative citizen,
who initially maximizes utility by purchasing 1,000 gallons of gasoline per year. Thats

471
PART 8
the quantity that satisfies the equimarginal rule. Because the price of gasoline is four
times the price of an online song, the marginal utility of gasoline must be four times
the marginal utility of a song. For example, the marginal utility of gasoline is 12 utils,
compared to 3 utils for online songs:
How will the change in tax policy affect the citizens utility-maximizing choice?
Suppose the government combines the $2 gas tax with an income-tax cut of
$2,000 per year, meaning that the citizen could consume 1,000 gallons of gasoline and
still have the same amount of money to spend on other goods: The $2,000 income-tax
cut would exactly offset the $2,000 in extra gas taxes. Although the initial consump-
tion bundle is affordable, the substitution effect tells us that the citizen won t choose
it. Suppose the price of gasoline increases by the entire $2 tax, from $4 to $6. Using
the equimarginal rule, the bang per buck of gasoline drops to 2 utils per dollar
(12 utils divided by $6), compared to 3 utils per dollar for online songs. Therefore, the
citizen will cut back on gasoline and buy more online songs.
The decrease in gas consumption is the substitution effect in action. An increase
in the relative price of gasoline, with real income held constant, reduces the consump-
tion of gasoline as the consumer substitutes other goods such as online songs for gaso-
line. The lesson from this application is that when a gas tax is combined with an
offsetting cut in income taxes, the quantity of gasoline consumed will decrease
because of the substitution effect.
CONSUMER PUZZLES

BRANDING
The theory of consumer choice explains the logic behind the law of demand and
also provides a general framework for consumer decision making. In this part of
the chapter, we explore a couple of consumer puzzles. The first is the surprisingly
large consumer response to free goods. The second is the powerful effect of prod-
uct branding.

THE PRICE OF PIRATE SONGS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: What is the substitution effect of a
price increase?
Scarlett loves songs about pirates. Her parents give her money each month, and their
objective is to keep her utility level roughly constant from month to month. So when
the price of online pirate songs increases, her parents increase their monthly payment
by an amount equal to the change in the price times the number of pirate songs
Scarlett purchased before the price increase. For example, if the price increases by
$0.20 and Scarlett bought 10 pirate songs per month at the previous price, her parents
will pay her an additional $2 per month.
How will Scarlett respond to an increase in price? She can afford the same bundle
of goods as before, but will she choose it? The substitution effect tells us that Scarlett
will consume fewer pirate songs even though she could afford to buy the same num-
ber. The increase in the price of songs relative to the price of other goods will cause
her to substitute other goods for pirate songs.

THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN $0.20 AND FREE!
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: How do consumers respond to free goods?
A few years ago Amazon.com introduced free shipping for U.S. orders over $25. A
consumer who bought a single book for less than $25 would pay about $4 in shipping,
but if adding a second book to the order brought the book total to at least $25, ship-
ping was free. The free-shipping offer decreased the effective price of any book that
pushed the book order over $25, and sales increased dramatically.
In France, the company offered cheap
but not free
shipping for orders over
$25. Crossing the $25 threshold cut the shipping charge to only 1 franc, about
$0.20. In contrast with the U.S. experience, book sales increased by a relatively
small amount.
The Amazon.com experiences in the United States and France illustrate a puzzle
in consumer behavior. Cutting the shipping charge from $4 to $0 had a huge effect,
but cutting the charge to $0.20 didn t have much of an effect. Consumers are highly
responsive to freebies, and many firms incorporate free goods and services into their
marketing.

NEUROSCIENCE AND THE COLA CHALLENGE
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: How does product branding affect consumers
brain activity?
In the Pepsi Challenge  advertisements, randomly chosen consumers tasted Pepsi
and Coke, and a majority preferred Pepsi. In an advertising campaign running at the
same time, Coca-Cola proclaimed that a majority of consumers who tasted both prod-
ucts actually preferred Coke. Can both companies be correct?
There was a subtle difference between the two taste tests. Pepsi used blind tasting,
while Coca-Cola used nonblind tasting. In other words, consumers in the Coca-Cola
taste tests knew which brand they were drinking, while consumers in the Pepsi tests
did not. When consumers see the labels, more people prefer Coke. When consumers
don t know what brand they are drinking, Pepsi has the edge. In other words, brand-
ing makes a difference.
Neuroscientists ran the cola challenge while monitoring the brain activity of the
tasters. When the participants knew which brand they were drinking, the portion of
the brain involved in higher order functions
working memory, associations, higher-
order cognitions, and ideas
was stimulated, and the activation was much greater with
Coke than with Pepsi. In other words, branding affects brain activity and consumer
preference.

In this chapter, we ve used
the theory of consumer choice
to explain the economic logic
behind the law of demand
and the negatively sloped
demand curve. The con-
sumer s objective is to maxi-
mize utility, given an income
and the prices of consumer goods. Here are the main points
of the chapter:
1 The law of diminishing marginal utility says that as the con-
sumption of a good increases, utility increases at a decreas-
ing rate.
2 The theory of consumer choice has two steps: First, identify
the affordable combinations of goods. Second, pick the
affordable combination that maximizes utility.
3 The equimarginal rule tells us to pick the combination of two
activities at which the marginal benefit per dollar for the first
activity equals the marginal benefit per dollar for the second.
4 The individual demand curve is negatively sloped, reflecting
the substitution effect and income effect of a change in price.
A decrease in price decreases the relative price of the good,
and consumers substitute the good for other goods (the
substitution effect). A decrease in price also increases the
consumer s real income, increasing the consumption of all
normal goods (the income effect).

Response to the Gas Tax. Petrov earns $10,000 in
pretax income and initially pays $2,200 in income
taxes and consumes 600 gallons of gasoline per year
(at a price of $3 per gallon) and spends $6,000 on
another good (at a price of $1 per unit). At the initial
bundle of gas and the other good, the marginal utility
of gas is 30 utils and the marginal utility of the other
good is 10 utils.
a. Draw a complete graph showing Petrov s initial
(before the gas tax) budget line and his initial
choice. At his initial choice, the marginal utility per
dollar on gasoline is

b. Suppose the government imposes a new gasoline
tax of $2 per gallon, and assume that the gas tax
increases the price of gas to $5. To make his initial

come in two quality levels, low and high. At a store in
the apple-growing region, the price of low-quality
apples is $1 per pound, and the price of high-quality
apples is $4 per pound. Johnny lives in the apple-
growing region and buys eight pounds of each type.
His marginal utility of apples is 3 utils for low-quality
apples and 12 utils for high-quality apples.
a. Is Johnny maximizing his utility?
b. Suppose Johnny moves to an area outside the
apple-growing region. Shipping the apples to his
new area adds $2 to the price of a pound of apples,
for both low- and high-quality apples. To simplify
matters, assume Johnny s income increases by an
amount large enough to fully offset the higher
prices of apples. In other words, he can still afford
the original bundle of eight pounds of each type of
apples. If he continues to buy eight pounds of
apples of each type, is he maximizing his utility? If
not, how should he change his mix of high- and
low-quality apples?
c. What are the implications for the mix of high- and
low-quality apples in apple-growing areas and
other regions? Where will most of the high-quality
apples be sold?

In February 2010, Apple Computer sold its 10 billionth song at its iTunes music store.
The song, Guess Things Happen That Way  by Johnny Cash, was downloaded by a
man from Georgia, who was then awarded a $10,000 gift card for the iTunes store.
Apple s online music store, which was established in 2003, was a dramatic departure
from the traditional way of selling music on CDs, with each bundle  of songs on a
CD selling for between $15 and $20. One of the purposes of launching the service was
to provide an alternative to Internet music piracy for people who wanted just a few
songs, not an entire CD. In designing the online music store, the folks at Apple
Computer applied some of the basic concepts of consumer choice, although they
might not have realized it.
In Chapter 4 we introduced the law of demand and showed how it generates
negatively sloped demand curves. In this appendix, we ll use a model of consumer
choice to provide the economic logic behind the law of demand and negatively
sloped demand curves. The consumer-choice model is based on the notion that
consumers do the best they can, given the limitations dictated by their incomes
and prices. As we ll see, every point on a demand curve represents the best choice
for a consumer.
CONSUMER CONSTRAINTS AND
PREFERENCES
Let s consider the decisions of Maxine, a consumer who must decide how many
movies and paperback books to buy each month. Maxine has a fixed income per
month to spend on the two goods, so her options are limited by her budget. To decide
how to spend her money, Maxine takes two steps:
1 She determines her menu of options, the list of alternative combinations of books
and movies her budget allows.
2 She picks the combination of movies that generates the highest level of satisfaction.
To pick a combination from the menu, Maxine will carefully consider her own per-
sonal preferences and tastes. We ll start with a discussion of Maxine s budget options,
and then discuss her preferences.
Consumer Constraints: The Budget Set and Budget Line
Consider first the constraints faced by a consumer. Maxine s ability to purchase
movies and other goods is limited by her income and the prices of movies and other
products. Suppose Maxine has a fixed income of $30 per month, which she spends
entirely on movies and used paperback books. The price of movies is $3, and the price
of books is $1.
A consumer s budget line shows all the combinations of two goods that exhaust
the consumer s budget. In Figure 22A.1, if Maxine spends her entire $30 budget on

books, she gets 30 books and no movies (point a). At the other extreme, she can
spend her entire budget on movies, getting 10 of them (point k). The points
between these two extremes are possible, too. For example, she could reach point b
(1 movie and 27 books) by spending $3 on movies and $27 on books, or point c
(2 movies and 24 books) by spending $6 on movies and $24 on books. Although the
budget line may look similar to a consumer s demand curve, they are very different
graphical tools. The budget line shows the different combinations of two goods that
a consumer can buy.
A consumers budget set is the set of all the affordable combinations of two goods.
The budget set includes the budget line (combinations that exhaust the budget) as well
as combinations that leave the consumer with leftover money. In Figure 22A.1,
Maxine s budget set is shown as a shaded triangle. She can afford any combination
below the budget line, but cannot afford combinations above it.
The budget line shows the market trade-off between books and movies. Starting
from any point on the budget line, if Maxine buys one more movie, she diverts $3
from book purchases, reducing the number of $1 books she can purchase by three.
The market trade-off equals the price ratio, the price of movies ($3) divided by the
price of books ($1), or three books per movie. The market trade-off also equals the
absolute value of the slope of the budget line, the rise  (the change in books) divided
by the run  (the change in movies). Because all consumers pay the same price for the
two goods, they all face the same market trade-off of three books per movie.
Consumer Preferences: Indifference Curves
We ve seen the consumer s budget set, which shows what the consumer can afford.
The next step in our discussion of consumer choice is to look at what the consumer
wants
what makes the consumer happy. Once we have a means of representing

consumer preferences, we can show how a consumer makes his or her choice, picking
the best of the combinations shown by the budget set.
We can represent the consumers preferences or tastes with indifference curves. An
indifference curve represents the fundamental idea that there are different ways for a con-
sumer to reach a particular level of satisfaction, or what economists call utility. An
indifference curve shows the different combinations of two goods that generate the same
level of utility or satisfaction. In Figure 22A.2, the indifference curve passing through
points b, i, m, and n separates the combinations of books and movies into three groups:
1 Superior combinations. All of the combinations above the indifference curve gen-
erate higher utility than combinations on the curve. Maxine would prefer point j
to point i because she gets more of both goods with point j.
2 Inferior combinations. All the combinations below the indifference curve generate
lower utility than combinations on the curve. Maxine would prefer point m to
point k because she gets more of both goods with point m.
3 Equivalent combinations. All combinations along the indifference curve generate
the same utility level. Maxine is therefore indifferent between combinations b, i,
m, and n.
An indifference curve shows the preferences of an individual consumer, so indif-
ference curves vary from one consumer to another. Nonetheless, the indifference
curves of all consumers share two characteristics: They are negatively sloped, and they
become flatter as we move downward along an individual curve.
Why is the indifference curve negatively sloped? If we increased Maxine s movie
consumption by one unit without changing her book consumption, her utility would
increase. To restore the original utility level, we must take away some books, and that s
what happens along an indifference curve. To keep utility constant, there is a negative
relationship between books and movies, so the indifference curve is negatively sloped.
The slope of the curve is called the marginal rate of substitution (MRS) between
the two goods; it is the rate at which a consumer is willing to trade or substitute one
good for another. The MRS is the consumer s trade-off between the two goods, the
number of books we must take from Maxine to offset the effect of giving her one more

movie. In Figure 22A.2, if Maxine starts at point b and we give her one more movie, we
take away eight books to keep her on the same indifference curve. Therefore, starting
from point b, her marginal rate of substitution is eight books per movie.
The indifference curve becomes flatter as we move downward along the curve.
This reflects the assumption that consumers prefer balanced consumption to extremes.
As we move downward along Maxine s indifference curve, movie consumption
increases while book consumption decreases. Starting from one extreme (few movies
and many books), she is willing to sacrifice many books to get another movie: The
MRS is large and the indifference curve is steep. For example, starting from point b, her
MRS is eight books per movie. But as she gets more and more movies (and fewer and
fewer books), she isn t willing to sacrifice as many books to get more movies. As a
result, her MRS decreases, and the indifference curve becomes flatter. For example,
between points m and n, the MRS is one book per movie.
An indifference curve map is a set of indifference curves, each with a different
level of utility. Figure 22A.3 shows three indifference curves: I1, I2, and I3. As Maxine
moves from a point on indifference curve I1 to any point on I2, her utility increases.
This is sensible because she can get more of both goods on I2, so she will be better off.
For example, point v provides more of both goods than point u. In general, Maxines
utility increases as she moves in the northeasterly direction to a higher indifference
curve (from I1 to I2 to I3, and so on).

MAXIMIZING UTILITY
We have now presented the two components of the consumer-choice model. The
budget line represents the consumer s limitations or constraints, and the indifference
curves represent the consumer s preferences or tastes. We can use the model to show
how a consumer makes a rational choice. Maxine s objective is to maximize her utility,
given her budget and the prices of movies and books. Maxine can pick from many
affordable combinations of books and movies, and she will pick the one that generates
the highest level of utility, or satisfaction. In graphical terms, Maxine will reach the
highest indifference curve possible, given her budget set.

481
The Tangency Condition
In Figure 22A.4, Maxine maximizes her utility at point e, with 4 movies and 18 books.
She achieves the utility level associated with indifference curve I2. Why does she
choose point e instead of other points, such as i, b, or w?
Point i. Maxine doesn t choose this point for two reasons. First, it is not on the
budget line, so it does not exhaust her budget: She would have some money left
over. Second, it is on a lower indifference curve
and thus generates less utility
than point e.
Point b. Although point b exhausts Maxines budget, it lies on a lower indiffer-
ence curve than e, so it generates less utility than point e. Starting from point b,
Maxine could reallocate her budget and buy more movies and fewer books. As
she moves down her budget line, she moves to progressively higher indifference
curves, ultimately reaching point e on indifference curve I2.
Point w. Although point w is on a higher indifference curve than point e and
thus would generate a higher utility level, it lies outside Maxines budget set, so
she cannot afford it.

Maximizing Utility: MRS Equals the Price Ratio
To maximize utility, the consumer finds the combination of books and movies where an indifference
curve is tangent to the budget line. At the utility-maximizing combination, the marginal rate of sub-
stitution (the consumer s own trade-off, shown by the slope of the indifference curve) equals the
price ratio (the market trade-off, shown by the slope of the budget line).
At point e, Maxine reaches the highest indifference curve possible, given her budget
set. Notice that at point e, the indifference curve touches
but does not pass
through
the budget line. In other words, the indifference curve is tangent to the
budget line.
The Utility-Maximizing Rule: MRS = Price Ratio
What is the economic interpretation of the tangency condition? At the point of tan-
gency, the slope of the indifference curve equals the slope of the budget line. The
slope of the budget line equals the price ratio, computed as the movie price ($3)

482
divided by the book price ($1), or three books per movie. The slope of the indiffer-
ence curve is the marginal rate of substitution (MRS), so if the two curves are tangent
at point e, the MRS is also three books per movie. In other words, the consumer s
trade-off between the two goods (the MRS) equals the market trade-off between the
two goods (the price ratio). The utility-maximizing rule is to pick the combination
such that
To show why the tangent point is best, suppose Maxine tentatively chooses a point
where the MRS is not equal to the price ratio. For example, suppose she started at
point b, where the indifference curve is relatively steep and the MRS is eight books per
movie. Starting at point b, she is willing to give up eight books to get a single movie.
But given the market trade-off between the two goods, she can actually get that movie
by sacrificing only three books. So she will move down her budget line and consume
more movies. The same argument applies to any combination for which the MRS (the
consumer s own trade-off) is not equal to the price ratio (the market trade-off). At any
time that Maxine is willing to trade at a rate that is different from market trade-off, it
will be in her best interest to do so. The benefits of trading will be exhausted when the
MRS equals the price ratio. In Figure 22A.4, this happens at point e.
Bundling of Goods and iTunes
The opening vignette described iTunes, one of the new online music stores. Online
music stores provide an alternative to the traditional method of buying bundles of
songs on CDs. We can use the consumer-choice model to explain the logic behind this
new development in the music business.
Consider Sam, who has $30 to spend on music and arcade games. In an ideal
world, he could buy music by the song, just as he buys arcade games individually.
Suppose the price of music in this ideal world is $1 per song and the price of arcade
games is $0.50 per game. In Figure 22A.5, Sam s budget line is the line connecting
points a and d. He can spend his entire budget on games, getting 60 games (point a),

Internet Music Piracy and iTunes
When music is sold as 15-song bundles on CDs, the consumer has three budget points (a, c, and d)
rather than an entire budget line. If songs are sold individually, the consumer has a full budget line
and can legally reach his or her ideal combination of 6 songs and 48 arcade games (point b).

483
or spend it all on songs, getting 30 songs (point d ). Alternatively, he could split his
budget between the two goods. With a price ratio of 2 games per song, the market
trade-off is 2 games per song. Suppose that in this ideal world, Sams best point is b,
where an indifference curve is tangent to his budget line, meaning that his MRS equals
the price ratio. At point b, Sam would have 6 songs and 48 arcade games.
Suppose that music cannot be purchased by the song but instead must be pur-
chased on CDs. Each CD carries 15 songs and has a price of $15. In this case, Sam
has only three options: He can spend his entire budget on games (60 games, as
shown by point a), or he can get one CD with 15 songs and also get 30 games
(point c), or he can spend his entire budget on two CDs (30 songs, point d ). All of
these points are below the indifference curve I2 associated with point b, so his util-
ity is lower at any of these other points. For example, the indifference curve going
through point c is I1, which is lower than I2. He d prefer point b (6 songs and
48 games) to point c.
In the world of CDs and Internet file sharing, Sam actually has another option.
He can use a swapping service to get songs for free. Of course, this is illegal, and Sam
risks a penalty and may also feel bad about breaking the law. If the benefit (free songs)
exceeds the cost (the risk of being penalized and the bad feelings about law breaking),
he will engage in piracy.
Consider next the effects of iTunes and other online music services that sell single
songs. Now Sam has a third option: He can get his ideal combination of goods with-
out any risk of criminal penalties. One motivation for online music stores is to reduce
music piracy by people who want just a few songs off a particular CD. Of course, there
are other motives for piracy, and piracy is expected to continue. But the early experi-
ence with online music stores suggest that many consumers prefer the flexibility of
buying music by the song and are willing to pay for it.

WHAT S YOUR MRS?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: To determine whether a consumer is making
the best choice, what single question can you ask?
We can use the utility-maximizing rule to determine whether consumers are doing the
best they can. Suppose a firm has a fixed budget of $200 to spend on punch and cook-
ies for its holiday party. The price of punch is $2 per cup and the price of cookies is
$1 per cookie; both goods will, of course, be provided free of charge to workers at the
party. The firms objective is to maximize the utility of the typical employee, and your
job is to determine whether the company spent this year s party budget wisely. To sim-
plify matters, assume that all employees have identical tastes for cookies and punch, so
data from a single person will apply to every employee. You can ask the typical
employee a single question. Whats your question?
From the utility-maximizing rule, we know that when a consumer is maximizing
utility, the marginal rate of substitution equals the price ratio. You know the price
ratio for the holiday party is 2.0 (the price of punch is twice the price of cookies), so
the question for the typical employee is What is your marginal rate of substitution?
Or in more familiar language, How many cookies would you be willing to trade for
one cup of punch?
If the answer is two cookies per cup of punch,  the MRS equals the price ratio,
and the firm did the best it could. On the other hand, if the answer is five cookies per
cup of punch,  the MRS exceeds the price ratio, and the firm could have generated
higher utility with its $200 by providing more punch and fewer cookies.

DRAWING THE INDIVIDUAL
DEMAND CURVE
One of the purposes of this appendix is to explain the economic logic of the individual
demand curve. We can use the model of consumer choice to show that every point on
the individual demand curve is the result of utility maximization. Specifically, we can
use the budget line and indifference curve for movies and books to draw Maxine s
demand curve for just one of those products
say, movies. The exercise of drawing
the curve reveals the logic of the law of demand.
The Negatively Sloped Demand Curve
We ve already derived one point on Maxines demand curve. Panel A in Figure 22A.6
shows the consumer-choice model, with indifference curves and a budget line. When
the price of movies is $3, Maxine maximizes utility at point e, with four movies. Panel
B shows her demand curve for movies, with the number of movies shown on the hor-
izontal axis and the price of movies on the vertical axis. When the price is $3, her
utility-maximizing choice is shown as point e in the upper panel and point E in the
lower panel. In other words, the demand curve shows her utility-maximizing choice.
With so many curves floating around, it is worth reviewing their roles in con-
sumer decision making:
The budget line shows the affordable combinations of two goods, representing
the consumer s constraints.
An indifference curve shows the different combinations of two goods that gener-
ate the same utility level, representing the consumer s preferences.
The demand curve shows how much of a single product a consumer is willing to
buy at a particular price. To get the demand curve, we use both the budget line
and indifference curves.
Panel A of Figure 22A.6 shows what happens to the budget line when the price of
movies decreases to $2. The decrease in price tilts the budget line outward. The orig-
inal vertical intercept (30 books) is still in the budget set, because if the entire budget

THE BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN $0.20 AND FREE!
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: How do consumers respond to free goods?
A few years ago Amazon.com introduced free shipping for U.S. orders over $25. A
consumer who bought a single book for less than $25 would pay about $4 in shipping,
but if adding a second book to the order brought the book total to at least $25, ship-
ping was free. The free-shipping offer decreased the effective price of any book that
pushed the book order over $25, and sales increased dramatically.
In France, the company offered cheap
but not free
shipping for orders over
$25. Crossing the $25 threshold cut the shipping charge to only 1 franc, about $0.20.
In contrast with the U.S. experience, book sales increased by a relatively small amount.
The Amazon.com experiences in the United States and France illustrate a puzzle
in consumer behavior. Cutting the shipping charge from $4 to $0 had a huge effect,
but cutting the charge to $0.20 didn t have much of an effect. Consumers are highly
responsive to freebies, and many firms incorporate free goods and services into their
marketing.

is spent on books the price of movies is irrelevant. The horizontal intercept moves
outward from 10 movies to 15 movies because with a lower movie price, a given bud-
get will buy more movies. The price of movies decreases relative to the price of books,
so the slope of the budget line
the price ratio
decreases.
How will Maxine respond to the lower price of movies? Given the new budget
line and the same set of indifference curves, Maxine picks point t, where one of her
indifference curves is tangent to the new budget line. Maxine responds to the decrease
in price by consuming seven movies instead of four. With this combination, her MRS
is equal to the new price ratio
two books per movie. The decrease in price decreases
the market trade-off between the two goods from three to two, and Maxine chooses a
new combination where her own trade-off matches the lower market trade-off.
Panel B of Figure 22A.6 shows the point on the demand curve associated with a
movie price of $2 (point T ). When the price is $2, Maxine consumes seven movies.
This is consistent with the law of demand: The lower the price, the larger the quantity
demanded, ceteris paribus. Recall that when we draw a demand curve, we use the ceteris
paribus assumption that everything except the price of the product is fixed. To draw
Maxine s demand curve for movies, we change the price of movies, holding her
income and the price of books fixed. Because we are using a single set of indifference
curves, we are also holding her personal preferences for the two goods fixed.
We ve used the consumer-choice model to find two points on the individual
demand curve. We could repeat the process for other prices to find other points on the

A decrease in the price of movies tilts the budget line outward. In Panel A, the indifference curve is tan-
gent to the new budget line at point t, with a larger quantity of movies (seven instead of four). In Panel B,

demand curve. For each price, we find the quantity of movies that generates the high-
est possible utility level, given the consumer s budget and the price of the other good.
Each point on the demand curve satisfies the utility-maximizing rule that the MRS
(the consumer s own trade-off) equals the price ratio (the market trade-off).
The Income and Substitution Effects of a Price Change
Lets take a closer look at a consumer s response to a change in price. We will break
down Maxines response to a decrease in price into two effects:
Substitution effect. A decrease in the price of movies decreases the price of
movies relative to the price of other goods, such as books. As movies become
less costly relative to books, Maxine substitutes movies for books.
Income effect. A decrease in the price of movies increases Maxine s real income
(the purchasing power of her nominal income), and she will buy more of all
normal goods. If watching movies is a normal good, she will watch more movies.
To show the substitution effect, consider the following thought experiment.
Suppose the price of movies decreases from $3 to $2, and at the same time Maxines
nominal income (the face value of her income) decreases from $30 to $26. In other
words, her nominal income drops by $4, which leaves her with just enough money to
afford her original bundle of 4 movies and 18 books:
Because the price reduction is exactly offset by a decrease in her nominal income, we
say that her real income hasn t changed. In Figure 22A.7, the new budget line goes
through her original utility-maximizing point e (4 movies, 18 books).
Because the new budget line goes through point e, Maxine could continue to con-
sume the original bundle. But will she? As we saw earlier, the MRS at point e is 3.0
the old price ratio. The new budget line, with a slope equal to the new price ratio of
2.0, is flatter than the original budget line. At point e, the indifference curve is steeper

The Substitution Effect of a
Decrease in Price
To observe the substitution effect,
shown by the move from point e to
point s, we offset the decrease in price
of movies (from $3 to $2) by decreasing
the consumer s income to $26, thereby
making the original choice (point e) just
affordable. At the original choice, the
MRS (three books per movie) exceeds
the new price ratio (two books per
movie), so the consumer can do better.
Moving from point e to point s, utility
increases and the quantity of movies
increases from four to six.

than the new budget line, meaning that the MRS (3.0) exceeds the new price ratio
(2.0). Therefore, Maxine can do better and can increase her utility level by moving
downward along the new budget line, getting more movies and fewer books. Utility is
maximized at point s, where the indifference curve I4 is tangent to the new budget line.
At this point, MRS equals the new price ratio of 2.0, so thats the best she can do. The
quantity of movies increases from four to six.
Our little thought experiment has revealed the substitution effect of the decrease
in price. The relative price of movies decreased from $3 to $2 while real income was
unchanged, so the increase in quantity from four to six movies is due exclusively to the
change in the relative price of movies. Although Maxine can just afford her original
bundle, she doesn t choose it: The decrease in the relative price of movies causes her
to substitute movies for books.
Consider next the income effect of a decrease in the price of movies. To
observe the income effect, we simply restore Maxine s original nominal income of
$30 and see how she responds. In other words, we undo  the $4 reduction in
income that we used to reveal the substitution effect. In Figure 22A.8, starting at
point s we restore the original nominal income by increasing nominal income by
$4 while keeping the price of movies at $2 and the price of books at $1. The budget
line shifts outward in a parallel fashion, and the increase in income allows Maxine
to move to a higher indifference curve. She maximizes utility at point t, where the
indifference curve I3 is tangent to the higher budget line. When Maxine s nominal
income increases from $26 back to $30, the utility-maximizing quantity of movies
increases from six to seven. In other words, the income effect increases consump-
tion by one movie.
Figure 22A.8 shows how to break down a consumer s response to a decrease in
price into the substitution effect and the income effect. Point e shows the original
choice, when nominal income is $30 and the price of movies is $3. Point t shows the
utility-maximizing choice when nominal income is $30 and the price of movies is $2.
We can break down this three-movie change into a substitution effect that increases
the quantity from four to six movies (point e to point s) and an income effect that
increases the quantity from six to seven movies (point s to point t).

a price of $2 per movie. The budget line shifts outward, and the consumer maximizes utility at point t,
so the quantity of movies increases from six to seven.

Example: The Substitution Effect of a Gasoline Tax
Consider the following change in federal tax policy. Suppose the federal govern-
ment imposes a new gasoline tax of $2 per gallon and simultaneously cuts income
taxes. Taxpayers will pay more in gasoline taxes, but less in income taxes. For the
average taxpayer, the two changes in tax policy will exactly offset each other, leav-
ing total taxes unchanged. How will this change in tax policy affect the consump-
tion of gasoline?
We can use a simple example to show the consumer response to the tax changes.
Consider a representative citizen, who initially (before the tax changes) buys 1,000 gallons
of gasoline per year and pays $5,000 in income taxes. In Figure 22A.9, the citizens initial
choice is point a, where the original budget line
the flatter and darker curve
is tangent
to the indifference curve I1. The citizen buys 1,000 gallons of gasoline, because thats the
affordable quantity where the MRS equals the price ratio.
The steeper and lighter budget line in Figure 22A.9 represents the new tax
policy. In this example, the government combines a $2 gasoline tax with a
$2,000 decrease in the income tax of the representative citizen. This means that the
citizen could still consume 1,000 gallons of gasoline and have the same amount of
money to spend on other goods: The $2,000 income-tax cut would exactly offset
the $2,000 in extra gas taxes. In Figure 22A.9, the new budget line goes through
the citizen s initial choice (point a), so the initial bundle is still affordable. Will the
consumer still choose the initial bundle?
The substitution effect of the gasoline tax will reduce gasoline consumption. At
point a, the indifference curve is flatter than the new budget line, so point a no longer
maximizes utility. The MRS is less than the price ratio, and utility will increase as the
citizen moves upward along the new budget line, buying less gasoline and a larger
quantity of other goods. In Figure 22A.9, the new utility-maximizing point is b, with
only 700 gallons of gasoline. Although the citizen could still afford to get 1,000 gal-
lons of gasoline, the increase in the relative price of gasoline means thats not the best
choice. Because of the substitution effect, when a gas tax is combined with an income
tax cut, the quantity of gasoline consumed will decrease.

Increasing the Gas Tax and
Decreasing the Income Tax
If a $2 gasoline tax is combined with a
$2,000 decrease in the income tax, a
person who initially buys 1,000 gallons
(point a) can still afford the initial choice.
But the increase in the relative price of
gasoline means that the initial point no
longer maximizes utility. At point a, the
MRS is less than the new price ratio,
and the substitution effect moves the
consumer from point a to point b,
reducing gasoline consumption from
1,000 to 700 gallons.

We ve used the theory of consumer choice to explain the eco-
nomic logic behind the law of demand and the negatively
sloped demand curve. The consumers objective is to maximize
utility, given his or her income and the prices of consumer
goods. Here are the main points of the appendix:
1 The theory of consumer choice has two steps: First, identify
the affordable combinations of goods. Second, pick the
affordable combination that maximizes utility.
2 To maximize utility, the consumer finds the bundle of goods
at which an indifference curve is tangent to the budget line.
3 At the utility-maximizing combination of two goods, the mar-
ginal rate of substitution (the consumer s own trade-off
between the two goods) equals the price ratio (the market
trade-off).
4 The individual demand curve is negatively sloped, reflecting
the substitution effect and income effect of a change in price.
A decrease in price decreases the relative price of the good,
and consumers substitute the good for other goods (the
substitution effect). A decrease in price also increases the
consumer s real income, increasing the consumption of all
normal goods (the income effect).

THE PRICE OF PIRATE SONGS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: What is the substitution effect of a
price increase?
Scarlett loves songs about pirates. Her parents give her money each month, and their
objective is to keep her utility level roughly constant from month to month. So when
the price of online pirate songs increases, her parents increase their monthly payment
by an amount equal to the change in the price times the number of pirate songs
Scarlett purchased before the price increase. For example, if the price increases by
$0.20 and Scarlett bought 10 pirate songs per month at the previous price, her parents
will pay her an additional $2 per month.
How will Scarlett respond to an increase in price? She can afford the same bundle
of goods as before, but will she choose it? The substitution effect tells us that Scarlett
will consume fewer pirate songs even though she could afford to buy the same num-
ber. The increase in the price of songs relative to the price of other goods will cause
her to substitute other goods for pirate songs.

some prompting from a friend, Jackson said, To get
an additional VR session, I would be willing to sacri-
fice two paintball sessions.  (Related to Application 1

c. Suppose the cable company switches from per-
channel pricing to a bundle plan: You get six
stations for a cost of $24 per month, but zero
stations if you don t pay the full $24. In other
words, the company tells you to take it (six stations)
or leave it (zero stations). Identify the new budget
points on your graph. Does the switch make you
better or worse off?

On your graph, show that taking it is better than
leaving it (picking zero channels).

2.15 Is the Average Bundle Better? Biff consumes two
entertainment goods, arcade games and CDs. When
you ask him in week one, How many arcade games
are you willing to sacrifice for one more CD?  he says,
two.  When you ask him the same question a week
later (week two), he says, five.  Over this period, his
underlying preferences for arcade games and CDs
haven t changed.
a. What could explain the change in his trade-off from
week one to week two? Illustrate with a completely
labeled graph, with CDs on the horizontal axis and
arcade games on the vertical axis.
b. Suppose Biff reached the same utility levels in
weeks one and two. In week three, you offer to
provide Biff his average consumption bundle from
weeks one and two, that is, the average number of
CDs and the average number of arcade games. Will
he be better off, worse off, or equally well off
compared to weeks one and two? Illustrate with a
completely labeled graph.
2.16 Free Goods and the Marginal Principle. Consider
the Amazon.com experiences with cheap shipping for
orders exceeding $25. Suppose the typical consumer
buys $15 books, and the regular shipping charge is $4,
regardless of how many books are purchased. (Related
to Application 2 on page 484.)
a. In the United States the free-shipping offer
changes the marginal cost of a second book from
$
to $
. In France, the
initial cheap-shipping offer changes the marginal
cost of a second book from $
to
$
.
b. Consider a U.S. consumer who buys a single book
when there is a $4 shipping charge, and responds to
the offer of free shipping by purchasing two books
rather 
than 
only 
one. 
The 
consumer s
marginal benefit for the first book is greater than
, and the marginal benefit for the second
book is between 
and 
.

Suppose Biff s parents adjust their monthly payment
to offset any change in price, ensuring that the bundle
Biff chose the previous month is just affordable.
Suppose the price of movies changes. The change in
the parental payment equals

parents adjust the payment, Biff will buy 
(more/fewer) movies because of the

Response to the Gas Tax. Petrov earns $10,000 in
pretax income and initially pays $2,200 in income
taxes, consumes 600 gallons of gasoline per year (at a
price of $3 per gallon), and spends $6,000 on other
goods (at a price of $1 per unit).
a. Draw a complete graph showing Petrov s initial
(before the gas tax) budget line, indifference curve,
and utility-maximizing quantities of gas and other
goods (in $ spent). At his initial choice, the
marginal rate of substitution is 
.
b. Suppose the government imposes a new gasoline
tax of $2 per gallon, and assume that the gas
tax increases the price of gas to $5. To make his
initial bundle of gasoline and other goods
affordable after the $2 gas tax, Petrovs income tax
must decrease by 
.
c. On your graph, draw a new budget line for a policy
that combines the $2 gas tax with the change in
income tax you computed for part b.
d. Use your graph to show whether the tax policy will
increase, decrease, or not affect Petrov s gas
consumption.

Shipping the Good Apples Out? Suppose apples
come in two quality levels, low and high. At a store in
the apple-growing region, the price of low-quality
apples is $1 per pound and the price of high-quality
apples is $4 per pound. Johnny lives in the apple-
growing region, and maximizes utility, spending his
$25 income on five pounds of each type.
a. Use a complete consumer-choice graph to show
Johnny s initial choice. Put high-quality apples on
the horizontal axis and low-quality apples on the
vertical axis.
b. Suppose Johnny moves to an area outside the
apple-growing region, where his income is $45 (up
from $25). Shipping the apples to his new area adds
$2 to the price of a pound of apples, for both low-
quality and high-quality apples. Use a consumer-
choice graph to show his new budget line and his
new utility-maximizing choice of low-quality and
high-quality apples.
c. What does this exercise suggest about the mix of
high-quality and low-quality apples in apple-growing
areas compared to the high-low mix in other areas?
Will the proportion of high-quality apples be higher
or lower in the apple-growing region?

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
Consider the challenge of providing safe water to rural
families in less developed countries. In India, the conven-
tional approach is for each family to use an individual carbon-
activated filter, at a monthly cost of $2 per month. The
alternative approach developed by the Byrraju Foundation
exploits economies of scale in water filtration. A community
filtration plant with a capital cost of $15,000 can provide
clean water to 1,500 families at a monthly cost of only $1 per
family. An added advantage of the filtration plant is that vil-
lagers can pay for water on a daily basis rather than being
required to come up with large amounts of cash to buy the
individual filter and replacement cartridges.1

CHAPTER 23
PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY AND COST
494
T
his chapter explores the relationship between the quantity of output produced
and the cost of production. As we ll see, a firms production cost is determined
by its production technology
the way the firm combines capital, labor, and
materials to produce output. After we explain the link between technology and costs,
we ll look at the actual cost curves of several products, including aluminum, hospital
services, wind power, truck freight, and airplanes.
Economists distinguish between the short run and the long run. The long run
is a period long enough that a firm is perfectly flexible in its choice of all inputs,
including its production facility. In contrast, when a firm cannot modify its facility,
it is operating in the short run. In this chapter, we ll explore both short-run and
long-run costs. In later chapters, we ll show how firms use short-run and long-run
cost curves to make decisions about whether to enter a market and how much out-
put to produce.
ECONOMIC COST AND ECONOMIC PROFIT
This is the first of several chapters on the decisions firms make. A firms objective is to
maximize its economic profit, which equals its total revenue minus its economic cost:
As we saw earlier in the book, a firms total revenue is the money it gets from selling its
product. If a firm charges the same price to every consumer, its total revenue equals
the price per unit of output times the quantity sold.
This chapter explores the firm s cost of production. A firm s economic cost
equals the cost of all the inputs used in the production process; we measure it as the
opportunity cost of the inputs. Recall the first key principle of economics.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  O P P O R T U N I T Y  C O S T
The opportunity cost of something is what you sacrifice to get it.
To compute a firms economic cost, we must determine what the firm sacrifices to use
inputs in the production process. Economic cost is opportunity cost.
As shown in the first column of numbers in Table 23.1, a firms economic cost can
be divided into two types. A firms explicit cost is its actual monetary payments for
inputs. For example, if a firm spends a total of $10,000 per month on labor, capital,
and materials, its explicit cost is $10,000. This is an opportunity cost because money
spent on these inputs cannot be used to buy something else. A firms implicit cost is
the opportunity cost of the inputs that do not require a monetary payment. Here are
two examples of inputs whose costs are implicit rather than explicit:
Opportunity cost of the entrepreneur s time. If an entrepreneur could earn
$5,000 per month in another job, the opportunity cost of the time spent run-
ning the firm is $5,000 per month.
Opportunity cost of the entrepreneur s funds. Many entrepreneurs use their
own funds to set up and run their businesses. If an entrepreneur starts a business
with $200,000 withdrawn from a savings account, the opportunity cost is the
interest income the funds could have earned in the bank, for example, $2,000
per month.
Economic cost equals explicit cost plus implicit cost:
economic cost = explicit cost +  implicit cost
economic profit = total revenue -  economic cost

In the first column of Table 23.1, the firms economic cost is $17,000, equal to $10,000
in explicit cost plus $7,000 in implicit cost.
Accountants have a different approach to computing costs. Their narrower defin-
ition of cost includes only the explicit cost of inputs:
In other words, accounting cost includes the monetary payments for inputs, but
ignores the opportunity cost of inputs that do not require an explicit monetary pay-
ment. In the second column of Table 23.1, the accounting cost is the $10,000 in mon-
etary payments for labor, capital, and materials. Accounting profit equals total
revenue minus accounting cost:
A firms accounting cost is always lower than its economic cost, so its accounting profit
is always higher than its economic profit. For the rest of this book, when we refer to
cost and profit, we mean economic cost and economic profit.
A FIRM WITH A FIXED PRODUCTION
FACILITY: SHORT-RUN COSTS
Consider first the case of a firm with a fixed production facility. Suppose you have
decided to start a small firm to produce plastic paddles for rafts. The production of
paddles requires a workshop where workers use molds to form plastic material into
paddles. Before we can discuss the cost of production, we need information about the
nature of the production process.
Production and Marginal Product
The table in Figure 23.1 shows how the quantity of paddles produced varies with the
number of workers. A single worker in the workshop produces one paddle per day.
Adding a second worker increases the quantity produced to five paddles per day. The
marginal product of labor is the change in output from one additional unit of labor.
In the table, the marginal product of the first worker is one paddle, compared to a
marginal product of four paddles for the second worker.
Why does the marginal product increase as output increases? As we saw earlier in
the book, when a firm increases its workforce, workers can specialize in production
tasks. Productivity increases because of the benefits of continuity
each worker
spends less time switching between production tasks. In addition, there are benefits
from repetition
each worker becomes more proficient at an assigned task. A two-
worker operation produces more than twice as many paddles as a one-person opera-
tion because the two workers can specialize, one being responsible for preparing the
plastic for the mold and the other for working the mold.

CHAPTER 23
PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY AND COST
496
Starting with the third worker, the production process is subject to diminishing
returns, one of the key principles of economics.
P R I N C I P L E  O F  D I M I N I S H I N G  R E T U R N S
Suppose output is produced with two or more inputs and we increase one
input while holding the other inputs fixed. Beyond some point
called the
point of diminishing returns
output will increase at a decreasing rate.
The third worker adds three paddles to total output, down from four paddles
for the second worker. As the firm continues to hire more workers, the marginal
product drops to two paddles for the fourth worker and one paddle for the
fifth worker. As we saw earlier in the book, diminishing returns occurs because
each worker gets a smaller share of the production facility. In the paddle example,
the workers share a mold; as the number of workers increases, they will spend more
time waiting to use it.
Figure 23.1 shows the firms total-product curve, which represents the relation-
ship between the quantity of labor (on the horizontal axis) and output (on the vertical
axis), ceteris paribus. The total-product curve shows the effects of labor specialization
as well as diminishing returns. For the first two workers, output increases at an
increasing rate because labor specialization increases the marginal product of labor.
Starting with the third worker, however, total output increases at a decreasing rate
because of diminishing returns.
Short-Run Total Cost
We ve seen the production relationship between labor input and output, so we re
ready to show the relationship between output and production cost. Suppose the
opportunity cost of your time is $50 per day, and you can hire workers for your work-
shop at the market wage of $50 per day. You can purchase your workshop, including
the building and the paddle mold, for $365,000. If the interest rate you could have
earned on that money is 10 percent per year, the opportunity cost of tying up your
$365,000 in the workshop is $36,500 per year, or $100 per day.

PART 9
In the short-run analysis of costs, we divide production costs into two types, fixed
cost and variable cost.
Fixed cost (FC) is the cost that does not vary with the quantity produced. In
our example, the fixed cost is the cost of the workshop, including the cost of the
building and the mold. As shown in the third column of Table 23.2, the fixed
cost is $100 per day, regardless of how much output is produced.
Variable cost (VC) is the cost that varies with the quantity produced. For
example, to produce more paddles, you must hire more workers. If the cost per
worker is $50 per day, your daily variable cost is $50 times the number of work-
ers, including you. As shown in the fourth column of Table 23.2, variable cost is
$50 for one worker, $100 for two workers, and so on.
To compute the firms total cost, we simply add the fixed and variable costs. The
firms short-run total cost (TC) equals the sum of fixed and variable costs:
The fifth column in Table 23.2 shows the total cost for different quantities of output.
For example, one worker produces one paddle at a total cost of $150, equal to the
fixed cost of $100 plus a variable cost of $50. Hiring a second worker increases output
to five paddles and increases total cost to $200, equal to $100 in fixed cost and $100 in
variable cost. Moving down the fifth column, the total cost rises to $250 for 8 units of
output, $300 for 10 units, and so on.
TC = FC +  VC

Short-Run Costs: Fixed Cost,
Variable Cost, and Total Cost
The short-run total-cost curve shows the
relationship between the quantity of
output and production costs, given a
fixed production facility. Short-run total
cost equals fixed cost (the cost that
does not vary with the quantity pro-
duced) plus variable cost (the cost that
varies with the quantity produced).
short-run total cost (TC)
The total cost of production when at least
one input is fixed; equal to fixed cost plus

fixed cost and variable cost, so the vertical distance between the TC curve and the
VC curve equals the firm s fixed cost. Notice that this distance is the same at any
level of output.
Short-Run Average Costs
There are three types of average cost. Average fixed cost (AFC) equals the fixed cost
divided by the quantity produced:
To compute AFC for our paddle company, we simply divide the fixed cost ($100) by the
quantity of paddles produced. In Table 23.2, we divide the number in column 3 by the
number in column 2. This calculation gives us the values for AFC, which are shown in
column 6. For example, the output in the second row is one paddle, so the average fixed
cost is $100 = $100/1. In the third row, output is five paddles, so the average fixed cost
is $20 = $100/5. As output increases, the $100 fixed cost is spread over more units, so
AFC decreases.
A firms average variable cost (AVC) incorporates the costs that vary with the
quantity produced. Average variable cost equals the variable cost divided by the quan-
tity produced:
To compute AVC for our paddle company, we simply divide the number in column 4
of Table 23.2 by the number in column 2. That calculation gives us the values for
AVC, shown in column 7. For example, the output in the third row is five paddles
and the variable cost is $100, so the average variable cost is $100/5 paddles, or $20.
Notice that for small quantities of output, the AVC decreases as the quantity pro-
duced increases
from $50 for one paddle, $20 for two paddles, and so on. The
AVC declines because of the benefits of labor specialization. Adding workers to a
small workforce makes workers more productive on average, so the amount of labor
required per unit of output drops, pushing down the average variable cost. In con-
trast, for large quantities of output, average variable cost increases as output
increases because of diminishing returns. Adding workers to a large workforce
makes workers less productive on average, pulling up the average variable cost. In
Figure 23.3, the AVC curve is negatively sloped for small quantities, but positively
sloped for large quantities.

Short-Run Average Costs
The short-run average-total-cost curve
(ATC) is U-shaped. As the quantity pro-
duced increases, fixed costs are spread
over more and more units, pushing
down the average total cost. In contrast,
as the quantity increases, diminishing
returns eventually pulls up the average
total cost. The gap between ATC and
AVC is the average fixed cost (AFC).

499
PART 9
A firms total cost is the sum of its fixed cost and variable cost, so the short-run
average total cost (ATC), or what we ll simply call average cost,  is the sum of the
average fixed cost and the average variable cost:
In Figure 23.3, we go from the AVC to ATC by adding the average fixed cost to AVC.
For example, for 5 paddles AFC is $20 and AVC is $20, so ATC is equal to $40, the sum
of $20 + $20. For 10 paddles, the average fixed cost is lower
only $10
while the
average variable cost is $20, so ATC is $30, the sum of $10 + $20. In Figure 23.3, the
gap between the AVC and ATC curves is the average fixed cost.
The ATC curve in Figure 23.3 is negatively sloped at quantities less than 10 pad-
dles. The negative slope results from two forces that work together to push average
cost down as output increases:
Spreading the fixed cost. For small quantities of output, a one-unit increase in
output reduces AFC by a large amount because the fixed cost is pretty thick,
being spread over just a few units of output. For example, going from one pad-
dle to five paddles decreases AFC from $100 to $20 per paddle.
Labor specialization. For small quantities of output, AVC decreases as output
increases because labor specialization increases worker productivity.
These two forces both push ATC downward as output increases, so the curve is nega-
tively sloped for small quantities of output.
What happens once the firm reaches the point at which the benefits of labor spe-
cialization are exhausted? As the firm continues to increase output beyond that point,
the average variable cost increases because of diminishing returns. There is a tug-of-
war between two forces: The spreading of fixed cost continues to push ATC down,
while diminishing returns and rising average variable cost pull ATC up. The outcome
of the tug-of-war varies with the quantity produced, giving the ATC curve its U-shape:
Intermediate quantities of output, such as output between 3 and 10 paddles.
The tug-of-war is won by the spreading of fixed cost, because the fixed cost is
still relatively thick  and diminishing returns are not yet very strong. As a
result, ATC decreases as output increases. For example, at 5 paddles ATC is $40,
but at 10 paddles ATC drops to only $30.
Large quantities of output, such as 11 or more paddles. The tug-of-war is won
by diminishing returns and rising average variable cost. In this case, the reduc-
tions in AFC are relatively small because the fixed cost is already spread pretty
thinly and diminishing returns are severe. As a result, ATC increases as output
increases. For example, at 10 paddles ATC is $30, but at 11.5 paddles ATC jumps
to $34.78.
Short-Run Marginal Cost
The short-run marginal cost (MC) is the change in short-run total cost per unit
change in output. In other words, it is the increase in total cost resulting from a one-
unit increase in output. Mathematically, marginal cost is calculated by dividing the
change in total cost (TC) by the change in output (Q):
The marginal cost of the first paddle is the increase in cost when the firm produces
the first paddle. To produce the first unit of output, the firm hires a single worker at
$50. As shown in column 9 of Table 23.2, the marginal cost of the first paddle is $50.

CHAPTER 23
PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY AND COST

Moving down the ninth column, hiring the second worker for $50 increases output to
five paddles. A $50 increase in total cost increases output by four paddles, so the mar-
ginal cost is $12.50:
In this case, marginal cost decreases as output increases because of labor specializa-
tion and rising worker productivity. The first worker produces just one paddle, but
adding a second worker increases output by four paddles. The $50 expense of adding
the second worker translates into a $12.50 expense for each of the four extra paddles
produced. We saw earlier that specialization leads to increasing marginal productivity.
Now we know that specialization also leads to decreasing marginal cost. In Figure 23.4,
the short-run marginal-cost curve is negatively sloped for the first five paddles.
The positively sloped portion of the marginal-cost curve is a result of diminishing
returns. Hiring the third worker increases output from 5 to 8, so the $50 expense
translates into a $16.67 expense for each of the 3 extra paddles produced. Diminishing
returns has set in, so marginal cost increases as output increases. The marginal cost
increases to $25 for between 8 and 10 paddles ($50/2 paddles), then increases to $50
for between 10 and 11 paddles ($50/1 paddle), and so on. In general, diminishing
returns decreases labor productivity and causes rising marginal cost.
The Relationship between Marginal Cost and Average Cost
Figure 23.4 shows the relationship between short-run marginal cost and short-run
average total cost. Whenever the marginal cost is less than the average cost (for fewer
than 10 paddles), the average cost is falling. In contrast, whenever the marginal cost
exceeds the average cost (for more than 10 paddles), the average cost is rising. Finally,
when the marginal cost equals the average cost, the average cost is neither rising nor
falling. Therefore, the marginal-cost curve intersects the short-run average total cost
curve at its minimum point.

PRODUCTION AND COST IN THE LONG RUN
Up to this point, we ve been exploring short-run cost curves, which show the cost of
producing different quantities of output in a given production facility. We turn next to
long-run cost curves, which show production costs in facilities of different sizes. The
long run is defined as the period of time over which a firm is perfectly flexible in its
choice of all inputs. In the long run, a firm can build a new production facility such as a
factory, store, office, or restaurant. Another option in the long run is to modify an exist-
ing facility.
The key difference between the short run and the long run is that there are no
diminishing returns in the long run. Recall that diminishing returns occur because
workers share a fixed production facility, so the larger the number of workers in the
facility, the smaller the share of the facility available for each worker. In the long run, a
firm can expand its production facility as its workforce grows, so there are no diminish-
ing returns.
Expansion and Replication
Continuing the example of paddle production, suppose you have decided to replace
your existing workshop with a new one. You have been producing 10 paddles per
day at a total cost of $300 per day, or an average cost of $30 per paddle. Suppose a
23.3
We can use some simple logic to explain the relationship between average and
marginal cost. Suppose that you start the semester with 9 completed courses and a
cumulative grade-point average of 3.0. In the first row of Table 23.3, you have 27 grade
points (4 points for each A, 3 points for each B, and so on), so your GPA is 3.0, which is
27 points divided by 9 courses. You enroll in a single course this semester
a history
course. Your new GPA will depend on your grade in the history course, the marginal
grade. There are three possibilities:
Marginal grade less than the average grade. In the second row of Table 23.3, if
you get a D in history, your grade point total increases from 27 points to 28 points.
Dividing the new total by 10 courses, your new GPA is 2.80. Its lower because
your marginal grade of 1.0 is less than the old average grade of 3.0.
Marginal grade equal to the average grade. In the third row of Table 23.3, if you
get a B in history, your grade point total increases from 27 points to 30 points.
Dividing the new total by 10 courses, your new GPA is 3.0. It hasn t changed
because your marginal grade of 3.0 equals the old average grade of 3.0.
Marginal grade greater than the average grade. In the fourth row of Table 23.3,
if you get an A in history, your grade point total increases from 27 points to
31 points, so your new GPA is 3.10. Its higher because your marginal grade of 4.0
is greater than the old average grade of 3.0.
To summarize, whenever the marginal grade is less than the average grade, the aver-
age will fall; whenever the marginal grade exceeds the average grade, the average
will rise; and whenever the marginal grade equals the average grade, the average will
not change.

company that sponsors rafting adventures orders new paddles, and you decide to
produce twice as much output in your new facility. What should you do?
One possibility is simply to double the original operation. You could build two work-
shops identical to the original shop and hire two workforces, each identical to the original
workforce. In the table in Figure 23.5, your firm moves from the third row of numbers
(four workers and $100 worth of capital produces 10 paddles per day) to the fourth row,
with twice as much labor, capital, and output. A firms long-run total cost (LTC) is the
total cost of production when the firm is perfectly flexible in choosing its inputs, including
its production facility. As shown in column 5 of the table in Figure 23.5, if your firm dou-
bles its output from 10 paddles to 20 paddles, the long-run total cost doubles too, from
$300 to $600.
The firm s long-run average cost (LAC) equals the long-run cost divided by
the quantity produced. As shown in column 6 of the table in Figure 23.5, doubling
output from 10 to 20 paddles doesn t change the long-run average cost because
doubling output by doubling both labor and capital increases costs proportion-
ately. In the graph in Figure 23.5, point b shows the average cost with 10 paddles
and point c shows the average cost with 20 paddles. As the quantity produced
increases, the average cost doesn t change, so the average-cost curve is horizontal
over this range of output. This is the case of constant returns to scale: As a firm
scales up its operation, costs increase proportionately with output, so average cost
is constant.
The same logic applies to larger output levels. Your firm could build a third work-
shop identical to the first two workshops, and its production costs will increase pro-
portionately, from $600 to $900. In the table in Figure 23.5, the average cost for
30 paddles is $30, the same as for 10 and 20 paddles. In general, the replication
process means the long-run total cost increases proportionately with the quantity

produced, so the average cost is constant. In Figure 23.5, the long-run average-cost
curve is horizontal for 10 or more paddles per day. In other words, there are constant
returns to scale for output levels of 10 or more paddles.
We ve seen that if a firm wants to double its output in the long run, replication is
one option. By simply replicating an existing operation, a firm can double its output
and its total costs, leaving average cost unchanged. Another possibility is to build a
single larger workshop, one that can produce twice as much output at a lower cost
than would be possible by simply replicating the original. If so, the long-run average
cost of producing 20 or 30 paddles would be less than $30 per paddle.
A firm s long-run marginal cost (LMC) is the change in long-run cost resulting
from producing one more unit of output. In the long run, the firm is perfectly flexible
in choosing its inputs. Therefore, LMC is the increase in cost when the firm can
change its production facility as well as its workforce.
Reducing Output with Indivisible Inputs
What would happen if you decide to produce only 5 paddles per day instead of 10?
Although its tempting to think that your total costs would be cut in half, thats not nec-
essarily the case. Remember that you use a single mold to produce 10 paddles per day.
If you cut your output in half, you would still need the mold, so your capital costs won t
be cut in half. In addition, if each mold requires a fixed amount of floor space, you
would still need the same floor space. Therefore, cutting output in half wouldn t
decrease the cost of your production facility at all. You would still have a cost of $100
per day for the mold and the workspace. Because cutting output in half doesn t cut cap-
ital costs in half, the average cost for producing 5 paddles will exceed the average cost
for 10 paddles.
The mold is an example of an indivisible input, one that we cannot scale down
to produce a smaller quantity of output. When a production process requires the use
of indivisible inputs, the average cost of production increases as output decreases,
because the cost of the indivisible inputs is spread over a smaller quantity of output.
Most production operations use some indivisible inputs, but the costs of these inputs
vary. Here are some examples of firms and their indivisible inputs:
A railroad company uses tracks to provide freight service between two cities.
The company cannot scale down by laying a half set of tracks
a single rail.
A shipping firm uses a large ship to carry TV sets from Japan to the United
States. The company can t scale back by transporting TVs in rowboats.
A steel producer uses a large blast furnace. The company can t scale back by
producing steel in a toaster oven.
A hospital uses imaging machines for X-rays, CAT scans, and MRIs. The hospi-
tal can t scale back by getting mini-MRI machines.
The second row of the table in Figure 23.5 on page 502 shows labor and capital
costs in the smaller operation. Suppose that to produce 5 paddles, you ll need two
workers, including yourself. In this case, your labor cost will be $100. Adding the $100
cost of the indivisible input (the mold and shop space), the total cost of producing
5 paddles per day will be $200, or $40 per paddle. This cost exceeds the average cost
of 10 paddles because in the smaller operation you still need the same amount of cap-
ital. In Figure 23.5 on page 502, point a shows that the average cost of 5 paddles per
day exceeds the average cost for larger quantities.
Scaling Down and Labor Specialization
A second possible reason for higher average long-run costs in a smaller operation is
that labor will be less specialized in the small operation. As we saw earlier in the
chapter, labor specialization

task
makes workers more productive because of continuity and repetition.
Reversing this process, when we reduce the workforce each worker will become less
specialized, performing a wider variety of production tasks. The loss of specialization
will decrease labor productivity, leading to higher average cost.
To see the role of labor specialization, consider the first row of numbers in the
table in Figure 23.5. To produce one paddle per day, the firm needs a full day of work
by one worker. The single worker performs all production tasks and is less productive
than the specialized workers in larger operations. This is one reason for the relatively
high average cost in a one-paddle operation ($150). The second reason is that the cost
of the indivisible input is spread over fewer paddles.
Economies of Scale
A firm experiences economies of scale if the long-run average cost of production
decreases as output increases, meaning that the long-run average-cost curve is nega-
tively sloped. In Figure 23.5 on page 502, the paddle producer experiences economies
of scale between points a and b. At point a, the long-run average cost is $40, compared
to $30 at point b and beyond. An increase in output from 5 to 10 paddles decreases the
long-run average cost of production because the firm spreads the cost of an indivisible
input over a larger quantity, decreasing average cost. In other words, there are some
economies
cost savings
associated with scaling up the firms operation.
One way to quantify the extent of scale economies in the production of a particu-
lar good is to determine the minimum efficient scale for producing the good. The
minimum efficient scale is defined as the output at which scale economies are
exhausted. In Figure 23.5, the long-run average-cost curve becomes horizontal at
point b, so the minimum efficient scale is 10 paddles. If a firm starts out with a quan-
tity of output below the minimum efficient scale, an increase in output will decrease
the average cost. Once the minimum efficient scale has been reached, the average cost
no longer decreases as output increases.
Diseconomies of Scale
A positively sloped long-run average-cost curve indicates the presence of
diseconomies of scale. In this case, average cost increases as output increases.
Diseconomies of scale can occur for two reasons:
Coordination problems. One of the problems of a large organization is that it
requires several layers of management to coordinate the activities of the differ-
ent parts of the organization. A large organization requires more meetings,
reports, and administrative work, leading to higher unit cost. If an increase in
the firm s output requires additional layers of management, the long-run
average-cost curve may be positively sloped.
Increasing input costs. When a firm increases its output, it will demand more of
each of its inputs and may be forced to pay higher prices for some of these inputs.
For example, an expanding construction firm may be forced to pay higher wages to
attract more workers. Alternatively, an expanding firm may be forced to hire workers
who are less skilled than the original workers. An increase in wages or a decrease in
productivity will increase the average cost of production, generating a positively
sloped long-run average-cost curve.
Firms recognize the possibility of diseconomies of scale and adopt various
strategies to avoid them. An example of a firm that adjusts its operations to avoid
diseconomies of scale is 3M, a global technology company that produces products
ranging from Post-it® notes to pharmaceuticals and telecommunications systems.
The company makes a conscious effort to keep its production units as small as pos-
sible to keep them flexible. When a production unit gets too large, the company
breaks it apart.

PART 9
Actual Long-Run Average-Cost Curves
Figure 23.6 shows the actual long-run average-cost curves for three products: alu-
minum production, truck freight, and hospital services.2
In each case, the long-run average cost curve is negatively sloped for small quan-
tities of output and relatively flat
almost horizontal
over a large range of output. In
other words, these curves are L-shaped. Other studies suggest that the long-run cost
curves of a wide variety of goods and services have the same shape.
Why is the typical long-run average-cost curve L-shaped? The long-run average-
cost curve is negatively sloped for small quantities of output because there are
economies of scale resulting from indivisible inputs and labor specialization. As output
increases, the average-cost curve eventually becomes horizontal and remains horizon-
tal for a wide range of output. Over the horizontal portion of the cost curve, increases
in inputs lead to proportionate increases in output, so the average cost doesn t change.
In other words, the long-run average total cost (LAC ) is constant and production is
subject to constant returns to scale.

PRODUCTION TECHNOLOGY AND COST

Short-Run versus Long-Run Average Cost
Why is the firms short-run average-cost curve U-shaped, while the long-run average-
cost curve is L-shaped? For large quantities of output, the short-run curve is positively
sloped because of diminishing returns and the resulting decrease in labor productivity
and increase in marginal cost. If a firm increases its output while at least one input is held
fixed, diminishing returns eventually occur, pulling up the average cost of production.
The difference between the short run and long run is a firms flexibility in choos-
ing inputs. In the long run, a firm can increase all of its inputs, scaling up its operation
by building a larger production facility. As a result, the firm will not suffer from
diminishing returns. In most cases, the long-run average-cost curve will be negatively
sloped or horizontal. In some cases, firms experience diseconomies of scale, so the
long-run average-cost curve will be positively sloped for high output levels.
Nonetheless, the long-run average cost will not be as steep as the short-run curve,
which is relatively steep because of diminishing returns.
APPLICATIONS OF PRODUCTION COST
So far we ve explored the links between production technology and the cost of pro-
duction. We ve seen the firm s short-run cost curves, which show how production
costs vary with the quantity produced when at least one input is fixed. We ve also seen
the long-run average-cost curve, which shows how the average cost of production
varies when the firm is perfectly flexible in choosing its inputs. In this part of the chap-
ter, we look at actual production costs for several products.

THE PRODUCTION COST OF MOBILE PHONES
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: What are the cost components for electronic
products?
What is the average cost of producing a mobile phone? Table 23.4 shows the compo-
nent costs of four phone models. Excluded from the data is the cost of assembly, which
is $6.50 for the iPhone. The prices of the individual components have fallen in recent
years, pulling down the average cost of producing a mobile phone.

INDIVISIBLE INPUTS AND THE COST OF FAKE KILLER WHALES
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: How do indivisible inputs affect
production costs?
Sea lions off the Washington coast eat steelhead and other fish, depleting some species
threatened with extinction and decreasing the harvest of the commercial fishing
industry. Rick Funk is a plastics manufacturer who has offered to build a life-sized
fiberglass killer whale, mount it on a rail like a roller coaster, and send the whale div-
ing through the water to scare off the sea lions, whales  natural prey. According to
Funk, it would cost about $16,000 to make the first whale, including $11,000 for the
mold and $5,000 for labor and materials. Once the mold is made, each additional
whale would cost an additional $5,000. In other words, the cost of producing the first
fake killer whale is more than three times the cost of producing the second. In terms
of total cost, producing two whales would cost a total of $21,000, while three whales
would cost a total of $26,000, and so on.
This little story illustrates the effects of indivisible inputs on the firms cost curves.
The mold is an indivisible input, because it cannot be scaled down and still produce
whales. If Funk wants to cut his production from two whales per month down to one,
he still needs the mold; he cannot simply produce half as many whales with half a mold
or a mold that is half the size. The cost of producing the first whale, $16,000, includes
the cost of the mold, the indivisible input. Once the firm has the mold, the marginal
cost for each whale is only $5,000, so the average cost per whale decreases as the num-
ber of whales increases.

SCALE ECONOMIES IN WIND POWER
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: What are the sources of scale economies
in production?
There are scale economies in the production of electricity from wind because electric-
ity can be generated from turbines of different sizes. Although large wind turbines are
more costly than small ones, the higher cost is more than offset by greater generating
capacity. The scale economies occur because the cost of purchasing, installing, and
maintaining a wind turbine increases less than proportionately with the turbines gen-
erating capacity. Table 23.5 shows the costs of a small turbine (150-kilowatt capacity)
and a large turbine (600-kilowatt capacity), each with an assumed lifetime of 20 years.
The large turbine has four times the generation capacity of the small turbine
20 million kilowatt hours versus 5 million kilowatt hours
but its purchase price is
less than three times as much. The two turbines have the same installation cost, and
the operating and maintenance cost of the larger turbine is less than twice as large.
Adding the various costs, the larger turbine, with four times the generating capacity,
has less than twice the cost. As a result, the average cost per kilowatt-hour is only
$0.032 for the large turbine, compared to $0.065 for the smaller turbine.

THE AVERAGE COST OF A MUSIC VIDEO
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: What is the cost structure for
information goods?
A music video is an information good
a product that is essentially a bundle of infor-
mation. Most of the cost of producing an information good results from collecting the
information and making a first copy. Once the information is organized and digitized,
the marginal cost of reproduction is tiny. In other words, an information good has
large first-copy cost, and a tiny marginal cost.
For a music video, the first-copy cost is the cost of putting images and sounds into
a digital format. The typical music video has a first-copy cost of $223,000
an amount
that includes $28,000 for the people responsible for the script or treatment,  $81,000
for two days of filming, $81,000 for editing, and $33,000 for other costs. Once the
images and sounds are digitized, the marginal cost of making additional copies is
small, or in the case of a music video distributed online, actually zero.
The average cost of a music video depends on how many copies are distributed.
Suppose the music video can be distributed online, at zero marginal cost. The average
cost is $223 if 1,000 copies are distributed, and drops to $0.23 if one million copies are
distributed. In Figure 23.7, the average-cost curve is negatively sloped and gets closer

509
and closer to the horizontal axis as the quantity distributed increases. The gap
decreases as the fixed production cost is spread over a larger number of copies. If con-
sumers can download the music video at a price of $1, the break-even quantity is
223,000 copies distributed.
Related to Exercises 4.4, 4.9, and 4.10.
A P P L I C AT I O N 5
THE FALLING COST OF SOLAR POWER
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #5: How does technological innovation affect
production cost?
Photovoltaic cells (or solar cells) convert sunlight directly into electricity. In 1980, the
capital cost of solar cells was about $20 per watt of electricity generated.
Technological innovation reduced the capital cost to less than $5 per watt in 2007.
Even more recent advances focus on reducing the amount of silicon in each solar cell
and employing nanotechnology to keep reflected light bouncing around inside the cell
until it is eventually absorbed. These innovations will reduce the capital cost to less
than $2 per watt generated, and perhaps as little as $1.35 per watt. In contrast, the
capital cost of a coal-fired power plant is about $1 per watt generated.
An alternative approach uses mirrors to focus sunlight to produce steam to drive a
generator. A power-tower uses an array of mirrors to focus the suns rays on an ele-
vated platform. The cost of producing electricity in this way is a bit higher than the
cost of electricity from coal-fired power plants, but if coal plants were required to pay
a carbon tax
a tax based on the carbon they release into the atmosphere
solar
energy would be price-competitive.
The most intriguing innovation of recent years is a sort of hybrid technology.
It uses mirrors, but instead of focusing sunlight to boil water, it focuses sunlight
on solar cells. Early estimates suggest the cost of this hybrid technology would
make solar power competitive with electricity from coal-fired power plants.

In this chapter, we explored
the cost side of a firm, explain-
ing the shapes of the firm s
short-run and long-run cost
curves. Table 23.6 summarizes
the definitions of various types
of costs. Here are the main
points of the chapter:
1 The negatively sloped por-
tion of the short-run marginal-cost curve (MC) results from
input specialization that causes increasing marginal returns.
2 The positively sloped portion of the MC results from
diminishing returns.
3 The short-run average-total-cost curve (ATC) is U-shaped
because of the conflicting effects of (a) fixed costs being spread
over a larger quantity of output and (b) diminishing returns.
4 The long-run average-cost curve (LAC) is horizontal over
some range of output because replication is an option, so
doubling output will no more than double long-run total cost.
5 The LAC is negatively sloped for small quantities of output
because (a) there are indivisible inputs that cannot be scaled
down and (b) a smaller operation has limited opportunities
for labor specialization.
6 Diseconomies of scale arise if there are problems in coordi-
nating a large operation or higher input costs in a larger
organization.

2.11 Same Average Cost with Different Quantities?
Suppose there are two pencil producers with identical
production facilities
identical factories and equip-
ment. The firms pay the same wages and pay the same
prices for materials. Sam has a small workforce and pro-
duces 1,000 pencils per minute; Marian has a medium-
size workforce and produces 2,000 pencils per minute.
The two firms have the same average total cost of
10 cents per pencil. Suppose you build a production
facility identical to the ones used by the other firms and
hire enough workers and buy enough materials to pro-
duce 2,500 pencils per minute. Would you expect your
average cost to be 10 cents per pencil (like the other
two firms), less than 10 cents, or more than 10 cents?

Deregulation and the Cost of Trucking. Suppose
the government initially limits the number of trucking
firms that can haul freight. The market for truck
freight is served by a single firm that produces five
million ton-miles of service per year, where one ton-
mile is the hauling of one ton of freight one mile. The
newly elected governor has proposed that other firms
be allowed to enter the market. At a public hearing on
the issue of eliminating the entry restrictions, the
manager of the existing firm issued a grim warning: If
you allow entry into the market, four or five firms will
enter, and the unit cost of truck freight will at least
triple. There are big economies of scale in trucking
services, so a single large firm is much more cost-efficient
than several small firms would be.  Whats your reaction
to this statement?
3.5
Draw the Long-Run Cost Curve. Consider the
long-run production of shirts. The cost of the indivis-
ible inputs used in the production of shirts is $400 per
day. To produce 1 shirt per day, the firm must also
spend a total of $5 on other inputs
labor, materials,
and other capital. For each additional shirt, the firm
incurs the same additional cost of $5.
a. Compute the average cost for 40 shirts, 100 shirts,
200 shirts, and 400 shirts.
b. Draw the long-run average-cost curve for 40 to
400 shirts per day.
3.6
Diminishing Returns versus Diseconomies of Scale.
Explain the difference between diseconomies of scale
and diminishing returns. Based on the cost curves you ve
seen in this chapter, which is more likely in firms?
3.7
Constant Marginal Cost. Consider a firm operating
in the long run with an indivisible input that has a cost
of $120. The marginal cost of production is constant
at $3 per unit. Draw the firms long-run average-cost
curve for 1 to 12 units of output. The long-run aver-
age cost drops from $
for the first unit to
$ 
for the twelfth unit.

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
In the award-winning 2004 movie Sideways, the main
character raved about pinot noir wine, noting that the
pinot grape requires special care and attention, and can
be grown only in a few places. The character said that the
payoff from all the attention is a wine whose subtle and
brilliant flavors make it one of the best wines on the
planet.1
This rave review increased the demand for pinot noir
wine grown in the Willamette Valley in Oregon. In the short
run, the supply of wine is inflexible, and eager consumers
competed for the limited stock, causing prices to soar. For
some brands, the price tripled. Producers responded to
higher prices by expanding the vineyard acreage devoted
to the pinot grape. A few years later, the new acreage
came on line, increasing the quantity of wine produced.
Eager growers competed for consumers by cutting prices,
in many cases back to pre-Sideways prices. As we ll see in
this chapter, when an increase in demand meets an inflexi-
ble short-run supply, prices rise in the short run. Eventually
suppliers catch up with demand, and prices fall.

T
his is the first of four chapters exploring the decisions firms make in different
types of markets. Markets differ in the number of firms that compete against
one another for customers. In this chapter, we ll look at a perfectly competi-
tive market. In a perfectly competitive market, hundreds, or even thousands, of
firms sell a homogeneous product. Each firm is such a small part of the market that it
takes the market price as given: Each firm is a price taker. For example, each soybean
farmer takes the market price as given. There is no reason to cut the price to sell more
soybeans, because the farmer can sell as much as he wants at the market price. There
is no reason to increase the price, because the farmer would lose all his customers to
other farmers selling at the market price.
A perfectly competitive market has two other features. First, on the demand side
of the market there are hundreds, or even thousands, of buyers, each of whom takes
the market price as given. Second, there are no barriers to market entry, so firms can
easily enter or exit the market. To summarize, here are the five features of a perfectly
competitive market:
1 There are many sellers.
2 There are many buyers.
3 The product is homogeneous.
4 There are no barriers to market entry.
5 Both buyers and sellers are price takers.
If you re thinking that the model of perfect competition is unrealistic, you re
right. Most firms actually have some flexibility over their prices. For example,
when Target increases its price of DVDs, it will certainly sell fewer DVDs, but the
quantity sold will probably not drop to zero. Although perfect competition is rare,
it s a good starting point for analyzing a firm s decisions, because a price-taking
firm s decisions are easy to understand. The firm doesn t have to pick a price; it
just decides how much to produce, given the market price. Once you understand
this simple case, you will be ready to tackle the more complex decisions made by
firms that are price makers
able to affect prices. We ll discuss that scenario in
later chapters.
In this chapter, we ll see how price-taking firms use information on revenues and
costs to decide how much output to produce. The output decisions of price-taking
firms underlie the market supply curve and the law of supply. In other words, this chap-
ter reveals the economic logic behind the market supply curve and the law of supply.
PREVIEW OF THE FOUR MARKET
STRUCTURES
Let s start by distinguishing between a market demand curve and the demand curve
for an individual firm. As we saw earlier in the book, the market demand curve
shows the relationship between the price and the quantity that suppliers can sell in
the market, assuming all firms charge the same price. In contrast, the firm-specific
demand curve shows the relationship between the price charged by a specific firm
and the quantity that firm can sell. In a monopoly, a single firm serves the entire mar-
ket, so the firm-specific demand curve is the same as the market demand curve. As
shown in Panel A of Figure 24.1, the monopolist can choose any point on the mar-
ket demand curve, recognizing that the higher the price, the smaller the quantity
the firm will sell.
As shown in Panel B of Figure 24.1, things are different for a perfectly competi-
tive firm. The firm-specific demand curve is horizontal
perfectly elastic. A perfectly
competitive firm can sell as much as it wants at the market price of $12, but if it raises
its price even a penny, it will sell nothing.

In Panel A, the demand curve facing a
monopolist is the market demand curve.
In Panel B, a perfectly competitive firm
takes the market price as given, so the
firm-specific demand curve is horizontal.
The firm can sell all it wants at the mar-
ket price, but would sell nothing if it
charged a higher price.
Most markets lie between the extremes of monopoly and perfect competition.
Table 24.1 compares perfectly competitive markets with three alternative market
structures, which we ll discuss in the next three chapters:
Monopoly. A single firm serves the entire market. A monopoly occurs when the
barriers to market entry are very large. This can result from very large
economies of scale or a government policy that limits the number of firms.
Some examples of monopolies that result from large economies of scale are
local phone service, cable TV, and electric power transmission. Some examples
of monopolies established by government policy are drugs covered by patents,
the selling of firewood in national parks, and the U.S. Postal Service.
Monopolistic competition. There are no barriers to entering the market, so
there are many firms, and each firm sells a slightly different product. For exam-
ple, coffee shops in your city provide slightly different goods and compete for
customers. Your local grocery store sells many brands of toothbrushes, with
slight differences in size, shape, color, and style.
Oligopoly. The market consists of just a few firms because economies of scale or
government policies limit the number of firms. Some product examples are
automobiles, computer processor chips, airline travel, and breakfast cereals.
The large economies of scale in automobile production result from the large
startup costs, with billions of dollars required to build a factory or assembly
plant. Similarly, a fabrication plant for computer processor chips costs several
billion dollars.

PART 9
THE FIRM S SHORT-RUN OUTPUT DECISION
We ll start our discussion of perfect competition with an individual firm s decision
about how much output to produce. The firms objective is to maximize economic profit,
which, as we saw in the previous chapter, equals total revenue minus economic cost.
Recall that economic cost includes all the opportunity costs of production, both explicit
costs (cash payments) and implicit costs (the entrepreneurs opportunity costs). In the
preceding chapter, we saw that the cost of production varies with the quantity pro-
duced. In this chapter, we ll see how economic profit varies with the quantity produced
and then show how a firm can pick the quantity that maximizes its economic profit.
Remember that economic profit differs from the conventional notion of profit.
Accountants focus on the flow of money into and out of a firm, so they ignore costs
that do not involve explicit transactions. Accounting profit equals total revenue minus
explicit costs. Because accountants ignore implicit costs, accounting profit usually
exceeds economic profit.
We will use the market for plain T-shirts to illustrate decision making in a per-
fectly competitive market. Some plain T-shirts are sold directly to consumers, and
others are sold to firms that imprint words and images on the T-shirts and then sell
the finished shirts to consumers. Plain T-shirts are produced in countries around the
world by a large number of producers.
The Total Approach: Computing Total Revenue and Total Cost
One way for a firm to decide how much to produce is to compute the economic profit
at different quantities and then pick the quantity that generates the highest profit. As
we ve seen, economic profit equals total revenue minus economic cost. We looked at
the cost side of the profit equation in Chapter 23. The revenue side for a perfectly
competitive market is straightforward. A firm s total revenue is the money it gets by
selling its product. Total revenue is equal to the price of the product times the quan-
tity sold. For example, if a firm sells eight T-shirts at $12 per shirt, total revenue is $96
(equal to 8 * $12). If our T-shirt producer has an economic cost of $63, the firm s
profit is $33 (equal to $96  $63).
Table 24.2 shows the total revenue and total costs of a hypothetical producer of
plain cotton T-shirts. Follow the row for an output of eight shirts. As shown in the
second and third columns, the fixed cost is $17, and the variable cost increases with
the amount produced. The fourth column shows total cost, the sum of the fixed and

variable costs. As shown in the fifth column, at a price of $12 per shirt, the firm s total
revenue is $12 times the number of shirts produced. The sixth column shows eco-
nomic profit, equal to total revenue minus total cost.
Figure 24.2 shows one way to choose the quantity of output that maximizes profit.
We re looking for the largest profit, shown by the biggest gap between total revenue
and total cost. For example, for five shirts the gap is $25: Total revenue (TR) equals
$60, and total cost (TC) equals $35. Moving down the table and across the figure, we
see that profit increases to $30 for six shirts:
Profit is maximized at $33 when the firm produces either seven or eight shirts:
When profit reaches its highest level with two different quantities (seven and eight
shirts in this example), we assume the firm produces the larger quantity. When the
firm produces eight shirts, its total revenue is $96 and its total cost is $63, leaving a
profit of $33.
 TR -  TC = 96 -  63 = $33
 TR -  TC = 84 -  51 = $33
TR -  TC = $72 -  $42 = $30

Using the Total Approach to
Choose an Output Level
Economic profit is shown by the vertical
distance between the total-revenue
curve and the total-cost curve. To maxi-
mize profit, the firm chooses the quantity
of output that generates the largest ver-
tical difference between the two curves.
The Marginal Approach
The other way for a firm to decide how much output to produce relies on the marginal
principle, the general decision-making rule that is one of the key principles of economics.
M A R G I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds its
marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal benefit equals the
marginal cost.
Because our firm is in business to make money, the benefit it gets from producing
shirts is revenue. The marginal benefit
or marginal revenue
of producing shirts is
marginal revenue
The change in total revenue from selling
one more unit of output.

519
PART 9
the change in total revenue that results from selling one more shirt. A perfectly com-
petitive firm takes the market price as given, so the marginal revenue
the change in
total revenue from one more shirt
is simply the price:
The marginal principle tells us that the firm will maximize its profit by choosing the
quantity at which price equals marginal cost:
In Figure 24.3, the horizontal line shows the market price for T-shirts, which our
shirt producer takes as given. The price line intersects the marginal-cost curve at eight
shirts per minute, so that s the quantity that satisfies the marginal principle and maxi-
mizes profit.

The Marginal Approach to Picking
an Output Level
A perfectly competitive firm takes the
market price as given, so the marginal
benefit, or marginal revenue, equals the
price. Using the marginal principle, the
typical firm will maximize profit at point
a, where the $12 market price equals
the marginal cost. Economic profit
equals the difference between the
price and the average cost ($4.125 =
$12  $7.875) times the quantity pro-
duced (eight shirts per minute), or
$33 per minute.
To see that an output of eight shirts per minute maximizes the firms profit, imag-
ine that the firm initially produced only five shirts per minute. Could the firm make
more profit by producing more
that is, six shirts instead of five?
From the seventh row of numbers in Table 24.2 on page 517 and point c in
Figure 24.3, we know the marginal cost of the sixth shirt is $7.
The price of shirts is $12, so the marginal revenue is $12.
Because the extra revenue from the sixth shirt (price = $12) exceeds the extra cost
(marginal cost = $7), the production and sale of the sixth shirt increases the firms total
profit by $5 (equal to $12  $7). Therefore, it is sensible to produce the sixth shirt.
The same logic applies, with different numbers for marginal cost, for the seventh
shirt. For the eighth shirt, marginal revenue equals marginal cost, so the firm s profit
doesn t change. To be consistent with the marginal principle, we ll assume the firm
produces to the point where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In this case, the
firm chooses point a and produces eight shirts.
If the firm produced more than eight shirts, it would earn less than the maximum
profit. Imagine that the firm initially produced nine shirts. From Table 24.2 and the
marginal-cost curve in Figure 24.3, we see that the marginal cost of the ninth shirt is
$16 (point d), which exceeds the marginal revenue (the market price) of $12. The
ninth shirt adds more to cost ($16) than it adds to revenue ($12), so producing the
shirt decreases the firm s profit by $4. The marginal principle suggests that the firm
should choose point a, with an output of eight shirts. The output decision is the same
whether the firm uses the marginal approach or the total approach.

The advantage of the marginal approach is that it is easier to apply. To use the total
approach, a firm needs information about the total revenue and total cost for all possible
output levels. In contrast, a firm can apply the marginal principle by simply increasing
its output by one unit and computing the marginal revenue (the price) and the marginal
cost. Using the marginal principle, the firm should produce more output if the price
exceeds the marginal cost, or produce less if the opposite is true. The firm can use the
marginal principle to fine-tune its decision until the price equals the marginal cost.
Economic Profit and the Break-Even Price
We ve seen that the perfectly competitive firm maximizes its profit by producing the quan-
tity at which its marginal revenue (price) equals its marginal cost. How much profit does
the firm earn? The firms economic profit equals its total revenue minus its total cost. One
way to compute a firms total economic profit is to multiply the average profit per unit pro-
duced
the gap between the price and the average cost
by the quantity produced:
In Figure 24.3, the average cost of producing eight shirts is $7.875 (point b), so the
economic profit is $33:
In Figure 24.3, the firms profit is shown by the area of the shaded rectangle. The area of
a rectangle is the height of the rectangle times its width. In Figure 24.3, the height of the
profit rectangle is the average profit of $4.125 per shirt (equal to $12  $7.875) and the
width is the eight shirts produced, so the profit is $33.
How would a decrease in price affect the firms output decision? A decrease in price
shifts the marginal-revenue (price) line downward, so it will intersect the marginal-cost
curve at a smaller quantity. In Figure 24.3, suppose the price drops to $7. The marginal-
revenue line will shift downward, causing it to intersect the marginal-cost curve at point
c, so the firm will produce only six shirts per minute. In other words, when the price
decreases from $12 to $7 the quantity produced decreases from eight to six shirts. This
is the law of supply in action: The lower the price, the smaller the quantity supplied.
What about the firms economic profit at a price of $7? At point c, average total cost
is $7, the same as the price. Therefore, economic profit is zero. We have discovered the
break-even price, the price at which economic profit is zero. The break-even price is
shown by the minimum point of the ATC curve, where marginal cost equals average
total cost. Remember that zero economic profit means that the firm is making just
enough money to cover all its costs, including the opportunity costs of the entrepreneur.
THE FIRM S SHUT-DOWN DECISION
Consider next the decisions faced by a firm that is losing money. Suppose the price of
shirts drops to $4, which is so low that the firm s total revenue is less than its total cost.
In Table 24.3, the marginal principle tells the firm to produce four shirts at this price,
but the firms total cost of $30 exceeds its total revenue of $16, so the firm will lose
$14 per minute. Should the firm continue to operate at a loss or shut down?
Total Revenue, Variable Cost, and the Shut-Down Decision
The decision to operate or shut down is a short-run decision, a day-to-day decision to
temporarily halt production in response to market conditions. Suppose our shirt fac-
tory hires workers by the day, so it makes the decision at the beginning of each day.
The decision-making rule is
 shut down if total revenue 6 variable cost
 operate if total revenue 7  variable cost

economic profit = ($12 -  $7.875) *  8 = $4.125 *  8 = $33

521
PART 9
As we saw in Chapter 23, a firms variable cost includes all the costs that vary with
the quantity produced. In the case of the shirt firm, it includes the costs of workers,
raw materials such as cotton, and the cost of heating and powering the factory for the
day. The variable cost does not include the $17 fixed cost of the production facility
for example, the cost of the machines or the factory itself
because these costs are not
affected by the decision to operate or shut down.
Although the decision is made at the beginning of each day, we can use the revenue
and costs per minute to compare total revenue to variable cost. From Table 24.3, when
the price is $4, the best quantity is four shirts and the variable cost is $13. The total rev-
enue from selling four shirts at $4 per shirt is $16, which exceeds the $13 variable cost.
By operating the factory, the firm pays $13 in variable cost to generate $16 in revenue,
so the firm is better off operating the facility. The benefit of operating the facility
exceeds the variable cost, so it is sensible to produce four shirts per minute.

The Shut-Down Decision and the
Shut-Down Price
When the price is $4, marginal revenue
equals marginal cost at four shirts (point
a). At this quantity, average cost is
$7.50, so the firm loses $3.50 on each
shirt, for a total loss of $14. Total rev-
enue is $16 and the variable cost is only
$13, so the firm is better off operating
at a loss rather than shutting down and
losing its fixed cost of $17. The shut-
down price, shown by the minimum
point of the AVC curve, is $3.00.
Figure 24.4 shows the firms choice when the price of shirts is $4. The marginal
principle is satisfied at point a, where the price equals the marginal cost. As shown by
point b, the average cost of producing four shirts is $7.50, so the firm loses $3.50 per
shirt. The shaded rectangle shows the firm s loss of $14. The height of the rectangle is
the $3.50 loss per shirt, and the width of the rectangle is the four shirts produced.
Of course, if the price drops to a low enough level, the firm will shut down the
factory. For example, if the price drops to $1, the marginal principle is satisfied with
two shirts per day. At this quantity, the variable cost is $6, which exceeds $2 revenue

($1 per shirt times two shirts). With this low price, the firms total revenue is not high
enough to cover the firms variable cost from operating the facility, so it is better to
shut down for the day.
The Shut-Down Price
There is a shortcut for determining whether it is sensible to continue to operate
compare the price to the average variable cost. Total revenue equals the price times
the quantity produced, and the variable cost equals the average variable cost times the
quantity produced. Therefore, total revenue will exceed variable cost if the price
exceeds the average variable cost. If that happens, the firm should continue to operate.
Otherwise, the firm should shut down.
In Figure 24.4, with a price of $4, the marginal principle is satisfied at point a, and the
average variable cost of producing four shirts is $3.25 (point c). The price exceeds the
average variable cost, so it is sensible to continue operating, even at a loss.
The firm s shut-down price is the price at which the firm is indifferent
between operating and shutting down. To find the shut-down price, we find the
minimum point on the AVC curve. In Figure 24.4, AVC reaches its minimum of $3
at a quantity of three shirts per minute, so the shut-down price is $3 (shown by
point d ). The average variable cost never drops below $3, so if the price drops
below $3 it would be impossible to generate enough revenue to cover the firm s
variable cost. When the price equals the shut-down price, the firm is generating
just enough revenue to cover its variable costs, so it is just as well off operating as
shutting down.
How long will a firm continue to operate at a loss? Let s think about what happens
when the firm must decide whether or not to build a new production facility. The firm
will build a new facility
and stay in the market
only if the price of shirts exceeds the
average total cost of production. In other words, the firm will stay in the market only
if the market price is high enough for its total revenue to cover all the costs of produc-
tion, including the cost of the new facility. In other words, the price must be greater
than or equal to the firms break-even price. Although a firm might make a short-run
decision to operate an existing facility at a loss, it won t replace the facility unless a
new facility will be profitable.
Fixed Costs and Sunk Costs
Note that the decision whether to operate or shut down does not incorporate the fixed
costs of the production facility. If we assume the facility cannot be rented out to some
other firm while the shirt firm isn t using it, the fixed cost is a sunk cost, a cost the
firm has already paid or committed to pay, so it cannot be recovered even by shutting
down the factory. Therefore, the firm should ignore the cost of the facility when
deciding whether to operate or shut down.
Rent is just one example of an irrelevant sunk cost. The marginal principle
tells us that decisions are based on the costs that depend on what we do, not on
costs that we can do nothing about. Suppose a dairy farmer spills two-thirds of a
300-gallon load of milk on the way to an ice-cream plant. Should the farmer return
to the farm or deliver the remaining 100 gallons? As long as the marginal cost of
delivering the milk
the opportunity cost of the farmer s time and the cost of
fuel
is less than the amount the farmer will be paid for the remaining 100 gallons,
it is sensible to deliver the milk. The spilt milk is a sunk cost that is irrelevant to
the farmer s delivery decision. The farmer should not cry over spilt milk, but
deliver the rest.

PART 9
SHORT-RUN SUPPLY CURVES
Now that we ve explored the output decision of a price-taking firm, we re ready to
show how a firm responds to changes in the market price of its product. We ll show
the relationship between price and quantity supplied with two short-run supply
curves, one for the individual firm and one for the entire market.
The Firm s Short-Run Supply Curve
The firm s short-run supply curve shows the relationship between the market price
and the quantity supplied by the firm in the short run, over a period of time during
which one input
the production facility
cannot be changed. In the case of shirt
producers, the firms supply curve answers the following question: At a given market
price for shirts, how many shirts will the firm produce? In Figures 24.3 and 24.4, we
used the marginal principle to answer this question for several different prices: At a
price of $3, the quantity is 3 shirts; at a price of $7, the quantity is 6 shirts; at a price of
$12, the quantity is 8 shirts.
The firms short-run supply curve is the part of the firms short-run marginal-cost
curve above the shut-down price. The shut-down price for the shirt firm is $3, so, as
shown by point a in Figure 24.5, the short-run supply curve is the marginal-cost curve

THE BREAK-EVEN PRICE FOR SWITCHGRASS, A FEEDSTOCK
FOR BIOFUEL
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: What is the break-even price?
In the search for alternatives to fossil fuels, a prominent contender is switchgrass, a
perennial grass that is native to the U.S. plains states. The principal advantage of
switchgrass and other cellulosic feedstocks for biofuels are their small carbon foot-
print. At what price will farmers convert their fields to switchgrass?
A recent study estimates the break-even price for growing switchgrass in North
Dakota. The price per ton varies with the fertility of the land, from $56 on the least
fertile land to $95 on the most fertile, or $76 on average. To compute the break-even
price, the researchers started by adding up the explicit costs of production, including
the costs of capital (machinery and equipment), labor, and raw materials. Then they
added the opportunity cost of using land for switchgrass rather than another crop, for
example, alfalfa, wheat, or soybeans.
We can illustrate the calculations with a simple example. Suppose the most prof-
itable alternative to switchgrass is alfalfa, and the implicit rent on land used to grow
alfalfa is $120 per acre
thats how much a farmer can earn in alfalfa production. If the
switchgrass yield is 3 tons per acre, the opportunity cost of land per ton of switchgrass
is $40 per ton (equal to $120 / 3). If the explicit cost of a ton of switchgrass (for capital,
labor, and raw materials) is $36, the break-even switchgrass price is $76 = $36 + $40.
What are the implications for switchgrass biofuel? To get some North Dakota
farmers to switch their crops to switchgrass, the price must be at least $56 per ton.
And the higher the price, the larger the acreage devoted to switchgrass. To get the
most fertile land in North Dakota switched to switchgrass, the price must be $95.

starting at $3. For any price above the shut-down price, the firm will choose the quan-
tity at which price equals marginal cost, so we can read the firm s quantity supplied
directly from its marginal-cost curve. If the price is $7, the firm will supply 6 shirts per
minute (point b). As the price increases, the firm responds by supplying more shirts:
8 shirts at a price of $12 (point c) and 10 shirts at a price of $21 (point d).
What about prices below the shut-down price? If the price drops below the shut-
down price, the firm s total revenue will not be high enough to cover its variable cost,
so the firm will shut down and produce no output. In Panel A of Figure 24.5, the firms
supply curve starts at point a, indicating that the quantity supplied is zero for any price
less than $3.
The Short-Run Market Supply Curve
The short-run market supply curve shows the relationship between the market price
and the quantity supplied by firms as a whole in the short run. Panel B of Figure 24.5
shows the short-run market supply curve when there are 100 identical shirt firms. For
each price, we get the quantity supplied for the entire market by multiplying the quan-
tity supplied by the typical firm (from the individual supply curve) by 100. At a price of
$7, each firm produces 6 shirts (point b in Panel A), so the market supply is 600 shirts
(point f in Panel B). If the price increases to $12, each firm increases production to
8 shirts (point c in Panel A), so the market supply is 800 shirts (point g in Panel B).
What happens if firms are not identical but instead have different individual sup-
ply curves? To compute the market supply in this case, we add the quantities supplied
by the hundreds of firms in the market. The assumption that firms are identical is
harmless: It makes it easier to derive the market supply curve from the supply curve of
the typical firm, but it does not change the analysis.
Market Equilibrium
Figure 24.6 shows a perfectly competitive market in equilibrium. For a short-run
equilibrium, two conditions are satisfied:
1 At the market level, the quantity of the product supplied equals the quantity
demanded. The demand curve intersects the short-run market supply curve at a
price of $7 and a quantity of 600 shirts per minute (Panel A).
2 The typical firm in the market maximizes its profit, given the market price. Given
the market price of $7, each of the 100 firms maximizes profit by producing 6 shirts
per minute (Panel B).

In Figure 24.6, the market has reached a short-run equilibrium because the price of $7
generates a total of 600 shirts per minute, exactly the quantity demanded by con-

In the long run, firms can enter or leave an industry, and existing firms can mod-
ify their facilities or build new facilities. The market reaches a long-run equilibrium
when the two conditions for short-run equilibrium are met, and a third long-run con-
dition holds as well:

ing firms to leave the market and no incentive for other firms to enter the market.

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: How do entry costs affect the number of
firms in a market?
For another example of a competitive market, consider phone service in the develop-
ing world, where many people relied on pay phones until the recent development of
mobile phones generated a new competitive industry.
In Pakistan, phone service is now provided by thousands of wireless women,
entrepreneurs who invest $310 in wireless phone equipment (transceiver, battery,
charger), a signboard, a calculator, and a stopwatch. Then they sell phone service to
their neighbors, charging by the minute and second. On average, their net income is
about $2 per day, about three times the average per capita income in Pakistan. The
market for phone service has the features of a perfectly competitive market, with easy
entry, a standardized good, and a large enough number of suppliers that each takes the
market price as given. In contrast, to enter the phone business in the United States,
your initial investment would be millions, or perhaps billions, of dollars, so the market
for phone service is not perfectly competitive.

CHAPTER 24
PERFECT COMPETITION
526
In Figure 24.6, at the quantity chosen by the typical firm (six shirts), the price ($7)
equals the average total cost, so each firm makes zero economic profit, with total rev-
enue equal to total cost. In other words, the market price equals the break-even price.
When economic profit is zero, the firm s revenue is high enough to cover all its
costs
including the opportunity costs of the entrepreneur
but not high enough to
cause additional firms to enter the market. Each firm already in the market makes just
enough money to stay in business, so there is no incentive for new firms to enter the
market, and no incentive for existing firms to leave.
THE LONG-RUN SUPPLY CURVE FOR AN
INCREASING-COST INDUSTRY
Let s look at the long-run market supply curve, which shows the relationship
between the market price and the quantity supplied by all firms in the long run, a
period long enough that firms can enter or leave the market. Suppose the typical shirt
firm produces six shirts per minute, using a standard set of inputs, including a factory,
some workers, and raw materials of cotton and thread. In a perfectly competitive
industry, there are no restrictions on entry, so anyone can use the standard set of
inputs to produce six shirts per minute.
We ll start with the case of an increasing-cost industry, in which the average
cost of production increases as the total output increases, for two reasons:
Increasing input price. As an industry grows, it competes with other industries
for limited amounts of various inputs, and this competition drives up the prices
of these inputs. For example, suppose the shirt industry competes against other
industries for a limited amount of cotton. To get more cotton to produce more
shirts, firms in the shirt industry must outbid other industries for the limited
amount available, and this drives up the price of cotton.
Less productive inputs. A small industry will use only the most productive
inputs, but as the industry grows, firms may be forced to use less productive
inputs. For example, a small shirt industry will use only the most skillful work-
ers, but as the industry grows, it will hire workers with lower skills. As the aver-
age skill level of the industry s workforce decreases, the average cost of
production increases: A firm will require more labor time
and pay more in
labor costs
to produce each shirt.
Another example of progressively less productive inputs is the production of agri-
cultural products such as sugar. Because of variation in climate and soil conditions, it
is cheaper to grow sugar in some areas than in others. As the quantity of sugar pro-
duced increases, growers are forced to produce sugar in areas with less favorable cli-
mates and soil conditions, and this results in higher costs.
Production Cost and Industry Size
Table 24.4 shows hypothetical data on the cost of producing shirts. Lets start with the
first row, which shows the firms production costs in an industry with 100 firms and a
total of 600 shirts produced per day (6 shirts per firm). To compute the total cost for
the typical firm, we add the cost of the firms production facility (the cost of the shirt
factory), the cost of labor, and the cost of materials. In the first row, the total cost of the
typical firm producing 6 shirts per minute is $42, and the average cost is $7 per shirt
($42 divided by 6 shirts). In the second row, if the number of firms doubles to 200 and
each firm continues to produce 6 shirts per minute, the total output of the industry will
double to 1,200 shirts per minute. For the two reasons listed earlier (higher input
prices and less productive inputs), the total cost per firm increases to $60, so the aver-
age cost per shirt increases to $10. In the last row, when the total output of the industry
increases to 1,800 shirts per minute, the average cost per shirt increases to $13.

increasing-cost industry
An industry in which the average cost of
production increases as the total output of
the industry increases; the long-run
supply curve is positively sloped. 

527
PART 9
The shirt industry is an example of an increasing-cost industry. In the last column
of Table 24.4, the average cost increases from $7 for an industry that produces
600 shirts, to $10 for an industry that produces 1,200 shirts, and so on. The average
cost increases because firms in a larger industry pay higher input prices and use less
productive inputs.
Drawing the Long-Run Market Supply Curve
The long-run supply curve tells us how much output will be produced at each price in
the long run, when the number of firms in the market can change. Recall that in the
long-run equilibrium, each firm makes zero economic profit, meaning that the price
equals the average cost of production.
The data in Table 24.4 shows three points on the long-run supply curve. At a
price of $7, a total of 100 firms will be in the market, with each producing 6 shirts per
hour. This combination (price = $7 and quantity = 600 shirts) is on the long-run sup-
ply curve because the price equals the average cost. Each firm makes zero economic
profit, so there is no incentive for firms to either enter or exit the market. This is
shown by point a in Figure 24.7. Suppose the price of shirts increases. At the higher
price, shirt making will be more profitable, and firms will enter the market, increasing
total output. Firms will continue to enter the market until the economic profit
becomes zero again, which happens when the average cost again equals the price.
From Table 24.4, we see that entry will continue until the market reaches 200 firms
producing 1,200 shirts at an average cost and price of $10. This is shown by point b in
Figure 24.7. Point c shows another point on the long-run supply curve, with a price of
$13 and a quantity of 1,800 shirts.
The long-run supply curve in Figure 24.7 is positively sloped, as it will be for any
increasing-cost industry. This is another example of the law of supply. An increase in
the price of shirts initially makes shirt production profitable, so firms enter the market
and produce more shirts. As industry-wide output increases, the greater demand for
cotton and labor increases input prices, which in turn increases the average cost of
producing shirts. Firms will continue to enter the market until the average cost rises

Long-Run Market Supply Curve
The long-run market supply curve shows
the relationship between the price and
quantity supplied in the long run, when
firms can enter or leave the industry. At
each point on the supply curve, the
market price equals the long-run aver-
age cost of production. Because this is
an increasing-cost industry, the long-run
market supply curve is positively sloped.

CHAPTER 24

to the point where it equals the price of shirts. The positively sloped supply curve tells
us the market won t produce a larger quantity of shirts unless the price rises to cover
the higher average cost associated with the larger industry.
Examples of Increasing-Cost Industries: Sugar and Apartments
The sugar industry is an example of an increasing-cost industry. If the price of
sugar is only 11 cents per pound, sugar production is profitable in areas with rela-
tively low production costs, including the Caribbean, Latin America, Australia,
and South Africa. At a price of 11 cents, the world supply of sugar equals the
amount produced in these areas. As the price increases, sugar production becomes
profitable in areas where production costs are higher, and as these areas enter the
world market, the quantity of sugar supplied increases. For example, at a price of
14 cents per pound, sugar production is profitable in some countries in the
European Union, too. At a price of 24 cents, production is profitable even in the
United States.
The market for apartments is another example of an increasing-cost industry
with a positively sloped supply curve. Most communities use zoning laws to restrict
the amount of land available for apartments. As the industry expands by building
more apartments, firms compete fiercely for the small amount of land zoned for
apartments. Housing firms bid up the price of land, increasing the cost of produc-
ing apartments. Producers can cover these higher production costs only by charg-
ing higher rents to tenants. In other words, the supply curve for apartments is
positively sloped because land prices increase with the total output of the industry,
pulling up average cost and necessitating a higher price for firms to make zero eco-
nomic profit.

WOLFRAM MINERS OBEY THE LAW OF SUPPLY
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: How do producers respond to an increase
in price?
For an example of the law of supply with market entry, consider the market for
wolfram during World War II. Wolfram is an ore of tungsten, an alloy required to
make heat-resistant steel for armor plate and armor-piercing shells. During World
War II, the United States and its European allies bought up all the wolfram pro-
duced in Spain, thus denying the Axis powers
Germany and Italy
this vital mili-
tary input. However, the wolfram-buying program was very costly to the Allied
powers for two reasons:
The Allied powers had to outbid the Axis powers for the wolfram, so the price
increased from $1,144 per ton to $20,000 per ton.
Spanish firms responded to the higher prices by supplying more wolfram. Workers
poured into the Galatia area in Spain, where they used simple tools to gather wol-
fram from the widely scattered outcroppings of ore. This market entry increased
the quantity of wolfram supplied tenfold. Because wolfram miners obeyed the law
of supply, the Allied powers were forced to buy a huge amount of wolfram, much
more than they had expected.

PART 9
SHORT-RUN AND LONG-RUN EFFECTS OF
CHANGES IN DEMAND
We can use what we ve learned about the short-run and long-run supply curves to get
a deeper understanding of perfectly competitive markets. Let s use the two supply
curves to explore the short-run and the long-run effects of a change in demand in a
perfectly competitive market.
The Short-Run Response to an Increase in Demand
Figure 24.8 shows the short-run effects of an increase in the demand for shirts. Panel A
shows whats happening at the market level. Lets start with the initial equilibrium shown
by point a: The original demand curve intersects the short-run market supply curve at a
price of $7 per shirt and a quantity of 600 shirts. When demand increases, the new
demand curve intersects the supply curve at a price of $12 and a quantity of 800 shirts
(point b). In Panel B, an increase in price from $7 to $12 increases the output per firm
from 6 shirts to 8 shirts. At this quantity, the $12 price now exceeds the average total
cost, so the typical firm makes an economic profit, as shown by the shaded rectangle.
Point b is not a long-run equilibrium because each firm is making a positive eco-
nomic profit. Firms will enter the profitable market, and as they compete for customers
the price of shirts will decrease. New firms will continue to enter the market until the
price drops to the point at which economic profit is zero. How far will the price drop?
The Long-Run Response to an Increase in Demand
We can use the long-run supply curve to determine the long-run price after an
increase in demand. In Figure 24.9, the short-run effect of the increase in demand is
shown by the move from point a to point b: The price increases from $7 to $12, and
the quantity increases from 600 to 800. Economic profit is positive, so firms will enter

THE WORLDWIDE SUPPLY OF COPPER
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: Why is the market supply curve
positively sloped?
The mining industry is another example of an increasing-cost industry. Copper mines
differ in the purity of their ore and the cost of extracting it. When the price of copper
is relatively low, only low-cost mines operate. As the price of copper increases, mines
with progressively higher extraction costs become profitable and are brought on line.
Between 2001 and 2006, the price of copper increased from $1,300 to $7,000 per ton,
and the industry moved upward along the long-run supply curve as high-cost mines
started or resumed production.
A recent geological survey of Afghanistan found a significant deposit of copper at
Aynak, just south of Kabul beneath an old al-Qaeda training camp. With a copper
price of $7,000, it would be profitable to spend the $1 billion necessary to develop the
site. But if the price of copper were to fall back to the level observed in 2001, the
Aynak mine would be a losing proposition.

the market. As shown by the long-run supply curve, entry will continue until the price
drops to $10 and the quantity is 1,200 shirts per minute. The new long-run equilib-
rium is shown by point c, where the new demand curve intersects the long-run supply
curve. At this price and quantity, each of the 200 firms produces six shirts per minute
and earns zero economic profit.
Figure 24.9 shows how the price of shirts changes over time. An increase in
demand causes a large upward jump in the price from $7 to $12 in the short run, fol-
lowed by a slide downward to the new long-run equilibrium price of $10. In the short
run, firms respond to an increase in price by squeezing more output from their exist-
ing production facilities. Because of diminishing returns, it is very costly to increase
output in the short run, so the price must increase by a large amount to cover these
much higher production costs. The higher price causes new firms to enter the market,
and as they enter the price gradually drops to the point at which each firm makes zero

The short-run supply curve is steeper

the short run, an increase in demand
increases the price from $7 (point a) to
$12 (point b). But in the long run, firms
can enter the industry and build more

ally drops to $10 (point c). The large

industry and build new factories, so there are no diminishing returns to increase pro-
duction costs.
LONG-RUN SUPPLY FOR A CONSTANT-COST
INDUSTRY
So far we have examined products produced by increasing-cost industries, whose aver-
age cost increases as the industry expands. We turn next to a constant-cost industry,
an industry whose average cost is constant
it doesn t change as the industry expands.
That is, the prices of inputs such as labor and materials do not change as the total out-
put of the industry increases. This happens when the industry uses a relatively small
amount of the available labor and materials, meaning that events in the industry
increases or decreases in output
do not affect the price of the input. As a result, the
average cost of production for the typical firm doesn t change as the industry grows.
In Table 24.4, the shirt industry would be a constant-cost industry if the average cost
of shirts were constant at $7 regardless of how many shirts were produced.
Long-Run Supply Curve for a Constant-Cost Industry
As an example of a constant-cost industry, consider the production of birthday cake
candles. As the industry grows, it will use more workers, wicks, and wax, but because
the industry is such a small part of the markets for labor and materials, the prices of
these inputs won t change. As a result, the average cost of production won t change as
the industry grows.
The long-run supply curve for a constant-cost industry is horizontal at the
constant average cost of production. If the average cost of birthday cake candles is
$0.05 per candle, the long-run supply curve for candles will be horizontal at $0.05, as
shown by Figure 24.10. At any lower price, the quantity of candles supplied would be
zero, because in the long run no rational firm would provide candles at a price lower
than the average cost of production. At any higher price, firms would enter the candle
industry in droves, and entry would continue until the price dropped to the constant
average cost of $0.05 per candle.

PLANNING CONTROLS AND HOUSING CYCLES IN BRITAIN
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #5: How do supply restrictions affect the boom-
bust housing cycle?
Restrictions on residential development make housing suppliers less responsive to
changes in demand. As a result, the housing market is more prone to cycles of rising
and falling prices. In a market with development controls, an increase in demand
causes a large increase in price because the supply side of the market is hobbled in its
response. The stricter the controls, the steeper the supply curve, and the larger the
short-run increase in price. If the restrictions are eventually relaxed to accommodate
higher demand, the supply side of the market responds, leading to an increase in
quantity and a drop in prices. In Britain, development restrictions are more severe
than they are in the United States, and this partly explains why Britain has more fre-
quent housing booms and busts.

Hurricane Andrew and the Price of Ice
For an example of the effects of an increase in demand in a constant-cost industry, lets
look at the short-run and long-run effects of a hurricane. In 1992, Hurricane Andrew
struck the southeastern United States, leaving millions of people without electricity
for several days. Figure 24.11 shows the short-run and long-run effects of the hurri-
cane on the price of ice, which was used to cool and preserve food in areas without
electricity. Before the hurricane, the market was at point a, with a price of $1 per bag
of ice. The long-run supply curve is horizontal, indicating that the ice industry is a
constant-cost industry.
In the short run (a day or two), the number of ice suppliers is fixed. The increase
in demand caused by the hurricane moved the market from point a to point b, and the
price rose to $5 per bag of ice. In the long run, firms responded to the higher price by
entering the market. Many people trucked ice from distant locations and sold it from
trucks parked on streets and highways. As these firms entered the ice market in the
days after the hurricane, the price of ice gradually dropped, and the market eventually
reached the intersection of the new demand curve and the long-run supply curve
(point c), with a price equal to the pre-hurricane price. In the case of the retail ice
industry, the long run is just a few days.
This pattern of price changes following the hurricane was observed in other mar-
kets. Immediately after the hurricane, $200 chain saws were sold for $900, but the
price dropped steadily as new roadside firms entered the market. The same sort of

A hurricane increases the demand for
ice, shifting the demand curve to the
right. In the short run, the supply curve
is relatively steep, so the price rises by a
large amount
from $1 to $5. In the
long run, firms enter the industry,
pulling the price back down. Because
ice production is a constant-cost indus-
try, the supply is horizontal, and the
large upward jump in price is followed
by a downward slide back to the origi-
nal price.

533
In this chapter, we explored
the decisions made by per-
fectly competitive firms and
the implications of these deci-
sions for the supply side of the
market. In the short run, a firm
uses the marginal principle to
decide how much output to produce. In the long run, a firm will
enter a market if the price exceeds the average cost of produc-
tion. Here are the main points of this chapter:
1 A price-taking firm should produce the quantity of output at
which the marginal revenue (the price) equals the marginal
cost of production.
2 An unprofitable firm should continue to operate if its total
revenue exceeds its total variable cost.
3 The long-run supply curve will be positively sloped if the
average cost of production increases as the industry grows.
4 The long-run supply curve is flatter than the short-run supply
curve because there are diminishing returns in the short run,
but not in the long run.
5 An increase in demand causes a large upward jump in price,
followed by a downward slide to the new long-run equilib-
rium price.

Preview of the Four Market Structures
1.1
The firm-specific demand curve shows the relation-
ship between the 
charged by the firm
and the 
by the firm.
1.2
The firm-specific demand curve is 
(horizontal/negatively) sloped for a perfectly competi-
tive firm and 
(horizontal/negatively)
sloped for a monopolist.
1.3
For a monopolist, the firm-specific demand curve is
the same as the 
demand curve.
1.4
A perfectly competitive firm is a price 
,
while a monopolist is a price 
.
The Firm s Short-Run Output Decision

2.2
Economic cost equals 
cost plus

2.3
For a perfectly competitive firm, marginal revenue
equals 
, and to maximize profit, the firm

produces the quantity at which 
equals
.
2.4
The market price for wheat is $5. If a farmer s mar-
ginal cost is $7, the farmer should produce
(more/less) output.
2.5
At the current output level, a farmers marginal cost of
producing sugar is $0.30. If the price of sugar is
$0.22 per pound, the farmer should 
(increase/decrease) production. If the price of sugar is
$0.32 per pound, the farmer should 
(increase/decrease) production.
2.6
A firm produces 20 units of output at a market price
of $5, a marginal cost of $5, and an average cost of
$3. The firm s economic profit is $ 
, and
the firm 
(is/is not) maximizing its eco-
nomic profit.
2.7
If the market price equals a firm s break-even price,
the firm earns 
economic profit because
equals 
.
2.8
A decrease in price 
(increases/decreases)
a firm s marginal revenue, so it 
(increases/decreases) the quantity supplied. This is the
law of 
in action.
price changes occurred for bottled water, tarpaper, and plywood. The basic pattern
was a large upward jump in price followed by a downward slide to the long-run equi-
librium price.

2.9
More or Fewer Deliveries? Consider a delivery firm
that delivers packages by bicycle, charging $13 per
package and paying each of its workers $12 per hour.
One day, one of the workers was two hours late to
work, and the number of packages delivered that day
decreased by one package.
a. Did the tardiness of the worker increase or decrease
the firms profit?
b. Based on the new information provided by this
experience, should the firm produce more
deliveries by increasing its workforce, or produce
fewer deliveries by reducing its workforce? Explain,
using the marginal principle.
2.10 Advice for a Firm. You ve been hired as an economic
consultant by a price-taking firm that produces scarves.
The firm already has a factory, so it is operating in the
short run. The price of scarves is $9, the hourly wage is
$24, and each scarf requires $1 worth of material. The
following table shows the relationship between the
number of workers and the output of scarves.
a. Fill in the blanks in the table.
b. What is the profit-maximizing output?
$76 = $36 explicit cost + $40 opportunity cost for land.
For each of the following changes, explain the effects
on the farmer s production cost and break-even price.
(Related to Application 1 on page 523.)
a. The cost of fertilizer increases.
b. The market price of alfalfa increases.
3.7
Advice for an Unprofitable Firm. You ve been hired
as an economic consultant by a price-taking firm that
produces baseball caps. The firm already has a factory,
so it is operating in the short run. The price of caps is
$5, the hourly wage is $12, and each cap requires
$1 worth of material. The firm has experimented with
different workforces and the results are shown in the
first two columns of the following table.
a. Fill in the blanks in the table.
b. Is it sensible to continue to operate at a loss with
14 workers?
c. Would it be better to operate with 15 workers?
Explain, using the marginal principle.

The Firm s Shut-Down Decision
3.1
A firm will continue to operate an unprofitable busi-
ness if 
exceeds 
cost.
3.2
Your firm has a total revenue of $500, a total cost of $700,
and a variable cost of $600. You should 
(operate/shut down) because 
exceeds
.
3.3
A firm that is losing money should continue to operate in
the short run if the market price exceeds 
.
3.4
Your firm has a price of $5, an average total cost of $7,
and an average variable cost of $4. In the short run,
you should 
(operate/shut down) because
exceeds 
. In the long run,
you should 
(stay in/exit) the market
because 
exceeds

A Bluffing Farmer? Consider the following statement
from a wheat farmer to his workers: The price of wheat
is very low this year, and the most I can get for the crop
is $35,000. If I paid you the same amount as I paid you
last year ($30,000), I d lose money because I also have to
worry about the $20,000 I paid three months ago for
seed and fertilizer. I d be crazy to pay a total of $50,000
to harvest a crop I can sell for only $35,000. If you are
willing to work for half as much as last year ($15,000),
my total cost will be $35,000, so I ll break even. If you
don t take a pay cut, I won t harvest the wheat.  Is the
farmer bluffing, or will the farm workers really lose their
jobs if they reject the proposed pay cut?
3.9
Operate or Shut Down? In Figure 24.4 on page 521,
suppose the market price of shirts drops to $2. At this
price, the marginal principle will be satisfied at a point
below point 
on the marginal-cost curve.
Price is 
(less/greater) than AVC, so the
firm will be better off 
(operating/
shutting down).
Short-Run Supply Curves
4.1
A firms short-run supply curve shows the relationship
between 
on the horizontal axis and
on the vertical axis.
24.4

4.2
To draw a firm s short-run supply curve, you need its
curve and its 
price.
4.3
A perfectly competitive industry has 100 identical
firms. At a price of $8, the typical firm supplies seven
units of output, so the market quantity supplied is
units of output.
4.4
Figure 24.6 on page 525 shows a long-run equilib-
rium because (1) the quantity 
equals
the quantity 
; (2) the typical firm maxi-
mizes 
by picking the quantity at which
equals 
; (3) each firm makes
economic profit because 
equals

4.5
A firm making zero economic profit stays in the mar-
ket because total revenue is high enough to cover all
the firms costs, including the opportunity costs of the
entrepreneurs 
and 
.
4.6
In Pakistan, the market for phone service is perfectly
, because a person can enter the market
with a relatively small initial investment
only $310.
(Related to Application 2 on page 525.)
4.7
Soybeans versus Processor Chips. Why is the mar-
ket for soybeans perfectly competitive, with thousands
of soybean farmers, while the market for computer
processor chips is dominated by a few large firms?
(Related to Application 2 on page 525.)
4.8
Draw the Supply Curves. The following table shows
short-run marginal costs for a perfectly competitive firm:
a. Use this information to draw the firm s marginal-
cost curve.
b. Suppose the shut-down price is $10. Draw the
firms short-run supply curve.
c. Suppose there are 100 identical firms with the same
marginal-cost curve. Draw the short-run industry
supply curve.
4.11 Expand If Profit Margin Is Positive? Consider a
firm that uses the following rule to decide how much
output to produce: If the profit margin (price minus
short-run average total cost) is positive, the firm will
produce more output. Use the firm s short-run cost
curves to evaluate this approach. Draw the firm s
short-run supply curve and compare it to the short-
run supply curve of a profit-maximizing firm.
The Long-Run Supply Curve for an Increasing-
Cost Industry
5.1
The long-run supply curve shows the relationship
between 
on the horizontal axis and
on the vertical axis.

ing-cost industry increases, the average cost of pro-
duction

and the productivity of inputs used by
firms

5.3
As the total output of an increasing-cost industry
increases, the average cost of production 
(increases/decreases), so the supply curve is
(horizontal/positively 
sloped/
negatively sloped).
5.4
In Table 24.4 on page 521, suppose the relationship
between industry output and the total cost for the typ-
ical firm is linear, and each firm produces six shirts. If
there are 400 firms in the industry, the total cost for
the typical firm is $ 
, and the average cost
per shirt is $ 
. Another point on the sup-
ply curve is a price of $ 
and a quantity of
shirts.
5.5
An increase in the price of shirts will cause firms to
the industry, and as output increases the
cost of production increases. Entry will
continue until 
equals 
.
5.6
Land-use zoning that limits the amount of land for
apartments generates a relatively 
(flat/steep) supply curve for housing, so an increase in
the demand for apartments leads to a relatively
(large/small) increase in price.
5.7
During World War II, the quantity of wolfram sup-
plied increased because the Allies  buying program
increased the 
of wolfram. (Related to
Application 3 on page 528.)
5.8
As the price of copper increases, the quantity of cop-
per produced increases because areas with relatively
high 
enter the market. (Related to
Application 4 on page 529.)

Equilibrium and Break-Even Price. Explain why
the equilibrium price in a perfectly competitive indus-
try is sometimes below the break-even price, some-
times above it, and sometimes equal to it.
4.10 Maximizing the Profit Margin? According to the
marginal principle, the firm should choose the quan-
tity of output at which price equals marginal cost. A
tempting alternative is to maximize the firm s profit
margin, defined as the difference between price and
short-run average total cost. Use the firm s short-run
cost curves to evaluate this approach. Draw the firms
short-run supply curve and compare it to the supply
curve of a firm that maximizes its profit.

and the output is 100 tons. (Related to Application 3
on page 528.)
a. Using the numbers related in the Application, draw
a supply and demand graph showing the effects of
the Allies  wolfram-buying program. Your supply
curve should be a long-run curve, which incor-
porates the entry and exit of firms.
b. Using the formula for the elasticity of supply in the
earlier chapter on elasticity, compute the price
elasticity of supply.
5.10 Copper Price Elasticity of Supply. Suppose the price
of copper increases from $1,500 to $2,500 per ton and
the quantity supplied increases from 9 million tons to
11 million tons. Use the midpoint formula to compute
the price elasticity of supply for copper. (Related to
Application 4 on page 529.)
5.11 Sugar Import Ban. Suppose that initially there are no
controls on sugar imported into the United States, so
the price paid in the United States equals the prevail-
ing world price.
a. If the world price is 13 cents per pound, what areas
of the world supply sugar to the world market and
the United States?
b. Suppose the United States bans sugar imports. The
new price of sugar will be at least $ 
.
5.12 Long-Run Supply Curve of Lamps. Suppose each
lamp manufacturer produces 10 lamps per hour.
Complete the following table. Then use the data in
the table to draw the long-run supply curve for lamps.

there is a net

old equilibrium.
6.3
An increase in demand causes a large initial upward
(jump/slide) in price, followed by a
downward 
(jump/slide) to the new long-
run equilibrium price.
6.4
Because of differences in the severity of restrictions on
residential development Britain has 
(more/fewer) housing booms and busts than the
United States. (Related to Application 5 on page 531.)
6.5
Increase in Housing Demand in Britain versus
the United States. Suppose that in both Britain and
the United States, the initial equilibrium price of
housing is $200,000. Britain has more severe restric-
tions on residential development in the short run.
Suppose the demand for housing increases by the
same amount in the two countries. (Related to
Application 5 on page 531.)
a. Draw a set of supply and demand curves showing
the effects on housing prices in the short run.
b. The price increase is larger in 
because that country has a relatively 
supply curve.
c. Suppose the long-run supply curves in the two
countries have the same slope. Show the long-run
effects of the increase in demand.
d. In the long run, Britain s price of housing is
(higher/lower/the same).
Long-Run Supply for a Constant-Cost Industry
7.1
As the total output of a constant-cost industry
increases, the 
cost does not change, so
the long-run supply curve is 
(horizontal/
positively sloped/negatively sloped).
7.2
A constant-cost industry consumes a relatively
(small/large) amount of inputs such
as labor and materials, so as industry output increases
the prices of these inputs 
(increase/
decrease/don t change).

5.13 How Steep a Supply Curve? Consider two cities,
one on a small island, and a second on a large plain.
a. Draw a long-run supply curve for housing for each
city, and explain any differences between the two
supply curves.
b. If demand for housing increases by the same
amount in each city, which city will experience a

The Price of Haircuts. The haircutting industry in
your city uses a tiny fraction of the electricity, scissors,
and commercial space available on the market. In
addition, the industry employs only about 100 of the
50,000 people who could cut hair.
a. Draw a long-run supply curve for haircutting in
your city.
b. Suppose the initial equilibrium price of haircuts is
$12. Draw demand and supply graphs to show the
short-run and long-run effects of an increase in
population. Does population growth affect the
long-run equilibrium price of haircuts?
7.6
Butter Prices. Several years ago, people became con-
cerned about the undesirable health effects of eating
butter. The demand for butter dropped, decreasing its
price. Some time later, the price of butter started rising
steadily, although demand hadn t been changing. After
several months of price hikes, the price of butter reached
the price observed before demand decreased. A blogger
suggested that the rising price of butter was evidence of
a conspiracy on the part of butter producers. Provide an
alternative explanation for the rising price of butter and
its eventual return to the original price.
7.7
The Price of Tattoos. According to a market expert,
tattooing in your city is a constant-cost industry. The
initial equilibrium price is $24.
a. Arrows up or down: In the long run the wage of tattoo
artists

b. If the demand for tattoos doubles and stays at the
higher level for three years, the price of tattoos
three years from now will be $

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
Why Does Movie Popcorn Cost So Much? That $4 bucket
of popcorn you get in the movie theater costs less than
$0.10 to produce. What explains the 4,000 percent markup?
Economists have struggled with this question for years, and
now we have an answer.1
Moviegoers vary in their willingness to pay for seeing a
movie, and a movie theater has an incentive to identify the high
demanders and charge them more, while keeping the price low
for the low demanders. It turns out that a reliable predictor of
the willingness to pay for a movie is the consumption of movie
popcorn: The people who buy a lot of popcorn are the con-
sumers who are willing to pay the most for a movie experience.
So a convenient way for the theater to charge more to the con-
sumers who are willing to pay more is to jack up the price of
popcorn. As a result, the low demanders simply pay the admis-
sion price, while the high demanders pay the admission price
plus the jacked-up price of a bucket of popcorn.
We can illustrate with a simple example. Suppose a low
demander is willing to pay $11 for a movie, while a high
demander is willing to pay $15 for a movie and popcorn. If
the theater charges $10 for admission and $4 for popcorn,
each consumer will get a consumer surplus of $1 (equal to
$11  $10 for the low demander and $15  $14 for the high
demander), so both consumers will see the movie. If instead
the theater charged $12 for admission and $0.10 for pop-
corn, the high demander will see the movie, but the low demander won t. The theaters pricing strategy
gets the low demander into the theater at a price of $10, and because the marginal cost of an additional
consumer is close to zero, the theater s profit increases.

I
n the previous chapter we explored the decisions made by firms in a perfectly com-
petitive market, a market in which there are many firms. This chapter deals with
the opposite extreme: a monopoly, a market in which a single firm sells a product
that does not have any close substitutes. In contrast with a perfectly competitive, or
price-taking, firm, a monopolist controls the price of its product, so we can refer to a
monopolist as a price maker. A monopolist has market power, the ability to affect the
price of its product. Of course, consumers obey the law of demand, and the higher the
monopolists price, the smaller the quantity it will sell.
A monopoly occurs when a barrier to entry prevents a second firm from entering
a profitable market. Among the possible barriers to entry are patents, network exter-
nalities, government licensing, the ownership or control of a key resource, and large
economies of scale in production:
A patent grants an inventor the exclusive right to sell a new product for some
period of time, currently 20 years under international rules.
When the value of a product to a consumer increases with the number of con-
sumers who use it, network externalities are at work. For example, the larger
the number of people on an online social network, the greater the opportunities
for interaction. Similarly, the larger the number of people using a software
application such as a word processor, the greater the opportunities to share files.
Network externalities provide an advantage to existing firms and may inhibit
the entry of new ones.
Under a licensing policy, the government chooses a single firm to sell a particu-
lar product. Some examples are licensing for radio and television stations, off-
street parking in cities, and vendors in national parks.
If a firm owns or controls a key resource, the firm can prevent entry by refusing
to sell the input to other firms. The classic example is DeBeers, the South
African company that controls about 80 percent of the world s production of
diamonds. Before the 1940s, the Aluminum Company of America
ALCOA
had long-term contracts to buy most of the worlds available bauxite, a key input
to the production of aluminum.
A natural monopoly occurs when the scale economies in production are so
large that only a single large firm can earn a profit. The market can support
only one profitable firm, because if a second firm entered the market, both firms
would lose money. Some examples are cable TV service, electricity transmis-
sion, and water systems.
In this chapter, we will discuss unnatural  monopolies, which result from artificial
barriers to entry. Later in the book, we ll explore the reasons for natural monopolies
and various public policies to control them.
This chapter examines the production and pricing decisions of a monopoly and
explores the implications for society as a whole. As we ll see, monopoly is inefficient
from societys perspective because it produces too little output. We ll also discuss the
trade-offs with patents, which lead to monopoly and higher prices but also encourage
innovation. We ll also explore the issue of price discrimination, which occurs when
firms such as airlines and movie theaters charge different prices to different types of
consumers. Although we discuss price discrimination in a monopoly, it also happens in
markets with more firms, including oligopoly (a few firms) and monopolistic competi-
tion (many firms selling differentiated products).
THE MONOPOLIST S OUTPUT DECISION
Like other firms, a monopolist must decide how much output to produce, given its objec-
tive of maximizing its profit. We learned about production costs in an earlier chapter, so
we start our discussion of the monopolists output decision with the revenue side of the
profit picture. Then we show how a monopolist picks the profit-maximizing quantity.

* FIGURE 25.1
The Demand Curve and the
Marginal-Revenue Curve
Marginal revenue equals the price for
the first unit sold, but is less than the
price for additional units sold. To sell an
additional unit, the firm cuts the price
and receives less revenue on the units
that could have been sold at the higher
price. The marginal revenue is positive
for the first four units, and negative for
larger quantities.
Total Revenue and Marginal Revenue
A firm s total revenue
the money it gets by selling its product
equals the price
times the quantity sold. In this part of the chapter, we ll assume that the monopo-
list charges the same price to each customer. The table in Figure 25.1 shows how to
use a demand schedule (in columns 1 and 2) to compute a firm s total revenue (in
column 3). At a price of $16, the firm doesn t sell anything, so its total revenue is
zero. To sell the first unit, the firm must cut its price to $14, so its total revenue
is $14. To get consumers to buy two units instead of just one, the firm must cut its
price to $12, so the total revenue for selling two units is $24. As the price continues
to drop and the quantity sold increases, total revenue increases for a while but then
starts falling. To sell five units instead of four, the firm cuts its price from $8 to $6,
and total revenue decreases from $32 to $30. The total revenue for selling six units
is even lower, only $24.

The firms marginal revenue is defined as the change in total revenue that results
from selling one more unit of output. You can see this in column 4 of the table in
Figure 25.1. For example, the marginal revenue for the third unit is $6, equal to the
total revenue from selling three units ($30) minus the total revenue from selling only
two units ($24). As shown in the table, marginal revenue is positive for the first four
units sold. Beyond that point, selling an additional unit actually decreases total rev-
enue, so marginal revenue is negative. For example, the marginal revenue for the fifth
unit is $2, and the marginal revenue for the sixth unit is $6.

541
PART 9
The table in Figure 25.1 illustrates the trade-offs faced by a monopolist in cutting
the price to sell a larger quantity. When the firm cuts its price from $12 to $10, there
is good news and bad news:
Good news: The firm collects $10 from the new customer (the third), so rev-
enue increases by $10.
Bad news: The firm cuts the price for all its customers, so it gets less revenue
from the customers who would have been willing to pay the higher price of $12.
Specifically, the firm collects $2 less from each of the two original customers, so
revenue from the original customers decreases by $4.
The combination of good news and bad news leads to a net increase in total revenue
of only $6, equal to $10 gained from the new customer minus $4 lost on the first
two customers.
Our discussion of good news and bad news has revealed a key feature of a monop-
oly: Marginal revenue is less than price. To sell one more unit, the monopolist must cut
its price, and the difference between marginal revenue and price is the bad news
the
loss in revenue from consumers who would have bought the good at the higher price.
In fact, this is true for any firm that must cut its price to sell more.
You may recall from the previous chapter that marginal revenue is different for a
perfectly competitive firm, which can sell as much as it wants at the market price. If a
perfectly competitive firm sells one unit at $12, it can sell a second unit at the same
price, so its marginal revenue is $12 for the second unit sold, just as it was $12 for the
first unit sold. For a perfectly competitive firm, marginal revenue is always equal to
the price, no matter how many units the firm sells. A perfectly competitive firm does
not cut the price to sell more, so there is no bad news associated with selling more.
A Formula for Marginal Revenue
We can use a simple formula to compute marginal revenue. The formula quantifies
the good news and bad news from selling one more unit:
The first part of the formula is the good news, the money received for the extra unit
sold. The second part is the bad news from selling one more unit, the revenue lost by
cutting the price for the original customers. The revenue change equals the price
change required to sell one more unit
the slope of the demand curve, which is a neg-
ative number
times the number of original customers who get a price cut.
We can illustrate this formula with an example. Suppose the monopolist wants to
increase the quantity sold from two to three, so it cuts the price from $12 to $10. The
new price is $10, the old quantity is two units, and the slope of the demand curve is
$2, so marginal revenue is $6:
Similarly, to sell the fifth unit, the firm would cut the price from $8 to $6, and mar-
ginal revenue is actually negative:
Marginal revenue is negative because the $8 revenue lost from the original customers
exceeds the $6 gain from the new customer. This happens because there are so many
original customers who get a price cut. If a monopolist continues to cut its price, mar-
ginal revenue will eventually become negative because there will be so many con-
sumers who get price cuts.
The graph in Figure 25.1 shows the demand curve and marginal-revenue curve
for the data shown in the table. For the first unit sold, the marginal revenue equals the
price. Because the firm must cut its price to sell more output, the marginal-revenue
marginal revenue = $6 -  ($2 per unit *  4 units) =
- $2
marginal revenue = $10 -  ($2 per unit *  2 units) = $6
marginal revenue = new price +  (slope of demand curve *  old quantity)

curve lies below the demand curve. For example, the demand curve shows that the
firm will sell three units at a price of $10 (point c), but the marginal revenue for this
quantity is only $6 (point h). The firm will sell five units at a price of $6 (point e), but
the marginal revenue for this quantity is $2 (point i). The marginal revenue is posi-
tive for the first four units and negative for larger quantities.
Using the Marginal Principle
A monopolist can use the marginal principle to decide how much output to produce.
Suppose a firm called Curall holds a patent on a new drug that cures the common cold
and must decide how much of the drug to produce.
M A R G I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds its
marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal benefit equals the
marginal cost.
The firms activity is producing the cold drug, and it will pick the quantity at which the
marginal revenue from selling one more dose equals the marginal cost of production.
In Figure 25.2, the first two columns of the table show the relationship between
the price of the cold drug and the quantity demanded. We can use these numbers to
draw the market demand curve, as shown in the graph in Figure 25.2. Because the firm
is a monopolist
the only seller of the drug
the market demand curve shows how
much the firm will sell at each price. The demand curve is negatively sloped, consistent

The Monopolist Picks a Quantity

To maximize profit, the monopolist picks
point a, where marginal revenue equals
marginal cost. The monopolist produces
900 doses per hour at a price of $15
(point b). The average cost is $8 (point c),
so the profit per dose is $7 (equal to the
$15 price minus the $8 average cost) and
the total profit is $6,300 (equal to $7 per
dose times 900 doses). The profit is

with the law of demand. For example, at a price of $18 per dose, the quantity demanded
is 600 doses per hour (point f ), compared to 900 doses at a price of $15 (point b).
Like other monopolists, the firm must cut its price to sell a larger quantity, so
marginal revenue is less than price. This is shown in the third column of the table as
well as the graph. We can use the marginal-revenue formula explained earlier to com-
pute marginal revenue for different quantities of output:
The slope of the demand curve is $0.01 per dose. To simplify the arithmetic, rather
than using the new  price and old  quantity, we can use a matched pair of price and
quantities from the demand curve to get an approximation of marginal revenue.
When the change in price is relatively small (for example, $0.01) the difference
between the new and old price is small enough to be ignored. For example, at a price
of $18, the quantity sold is 600 doses, so marginal revenue is $12:
Similarly, at a price of $15, the quantity is 900 doses and marginal revenue is $6:
We re ready to show how a monopolist can use the marginal principle to pick a
quantity to produce. To maximize its profit, the firm will produce the quantity at
which the marginal revenue equals marginal cost. As shown in the fourth row in the
table in Figure 25.2, this happens with a quantity of 900 doses. In the graph, the
marginal-revenue curve intersects the marginal-cost curve at point a, with a quantity
of 900 doses, so that s the quantity that maximizes profit. To get consumers to buy this
quantity, the price must be $15 (point b on the demand curve). The average cost of
production is $8 per dose (shown by point c).
We can compute the firms profit in two ways. First, profit equals total revenue
minus total cost:
Second, we can compute the profit per dose and multiply it by the number of doses:
The profit per dose is the price minus the average cost: $7 = $15  $8:
To show that a quantity of 900 doses maximizes the firm s profit, let s see what
would happen if the firm picked some other quantity. Suppose the firm decided to
produce 599 doses per hour at a price just above $18 (just above point f on the demand
curve). Could the firm make more profit by cutting the price by enough to sell one
more dose? The firm should answer two questions:
What is the extra cost associated with producing dose number 600? As shown
by point d on the marginal-cost curve, the marginal cost of the 600th dose is $4.
What is the extra revenue associated with dose number 600? As shown by point
e on the marginal-revenue curve, the marginal revenue is $12.
If the firm wants to maximize its profit, it should produce the 600th dose because
the $12 extra revenue exceeds the $4 extra cost, meaning the firm s profit will
increase by $8. The same argument applies, with different numbers for marginal
revenue and marginal cost, for doses 601, 602, and so on, up to 900 doses. The firm
should continue to increase the quantity produced as long as the marginal revenue
profit = $7 per dose *  900 doses = $6,300
profit = profit per dose *  quantity of doses
profit = $15 per dose *  900 doses -  $8 per dose *  900 doses = $6,300
profit = total revenue -  total cost
marginal revenue = $15 -  ($0.01 *  900 doses) = $6
marginal revenue = $18 -  ($0.01 *  600 doses) = $12
marginal revenue = new price +  (slope of demand curve *  old quantity)

CHAPTER 25
MONOPOLY AND PRICE DISCRIMINATION
544
exceeds the marginal cost. The marginal principle is satisfied at point a, with a total
of 900 doses.
Why should the firm stop at 900 doses? Beyond 900 doses, the marginal revenue
from an additional dose will be less than the marginal cost associated with producing
it. Although the firm could cut its price and sell a larger quantity, an additional dose
would add less to revenue than it adds to cost, so the firms total profit would decrease.
As shown in the fifth row in the table in Figure 25.2, the firm could sell 1,000 doses at
a price of $14, but the marginal revenue at this quantity is only $4, while the marginal
cost at this quantity is $6.70. Producing the 1,000th dose would decrease the firm s
profit by $2.70. For any quantity exceeding 900 doses, the marginal revenue is less
than the marginal cost. Therefore, the firm should produce exactly 900 doses.
Lets review what we ve learned about how a monopolist picks a quantity and how
to compute the monopoly profit. The three-step process is as follows:
1 Find the quantity that satisfies the marginal principle, that is, the quantity at
which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In the example shown in
Figure 25.2, marginal revenue equals marginal cost at point a, so the monopolist
produces 900 doses.
2 Using the demand curve, find the price associated with the monopolists chosen
quantity. In Figure 25.2, the price required to sell 900 doses is $15 (point b).
3 Compute the monopolists profit. The profit per unit sold equals the price minus
the average cost, and the total profit equals the profit per unit times the number of
units sold. In Figure 25.2, the profit is shown by the shaded rectangle, with height
equal to the profit per unit sold and width equal to the number of units sold.
THE SOCIAL COST OF MONOPOLY
Why should we as a society be concerned about monopoly? Most people are not sur-
prised to hear that a monopolist uses its market power to charge a relatively high
price. If this were the end of the story, a monopolist would simply gain at the expense
of consumers. In other words, a monopoly would change how we slice the economic
pie,  with a bigger slice for producers and a smaller slice for consumers. As we ll see
in this part of the chapter, the social consequences of monopoly go beyond a different
slicing of the pie: A monopoly causes inefficiency and actually reduces the size of the
pie, so there is less to divide among consumers and producers.
Deadweight Loss from Monopoly
How does a monopoly differ from a perfectly competitive market? To show the differ-
ence, let s consider an example of an arthritis drug that could be produced by a
monopoly or a perfectly competitive industry. Lets take the long-run perspective
a
period of time long enough that a firm is perfectly flexible in its choice of inputs and
can enter or leave the market.
Consider the monopoly outcome first. Lets assume the long-run average cost of pro-
ducing the arthritis drug is constant at $8 per dose. As we saw in the chapter on production
and cost, if average cost is constant, the marginal cost equals the average cost. In Panel A
of Figure 25.3, the long-run marginal-cost curve is the same as the long-run average-cost
curve. Given the demand and marginal-revenue curves in Panel A of Figure 25.3, the
monopolist will maximize profit where marginal revenue equals marginal cost (point a),
producing 200 doses per hour at a price of $18 per dose (point b). The monopolists profit
is $2,000 per hour
a $10 profit per dose ($18  $8) times 200 doses.
Consider next the market for the arthritis drug under perfect competition. We re
assuming the arthritis drug industry is a constant-cost industry: Input prices do not change
as the industry grows, so the long-run market supply curve is horizontal at the long-run
average cost of producing the drug, which is $8 per dose. In Panel B of Figure 25.3,
the horizontal long-run supply curve intersects the demand curve at point c, with an
25.2

545
PART 9
equilibrium price of $8 and an equilibrium quantity of 400 doses per hour. Compared to a
monopoly outcome, the perfectly competitive outcome has a lower price ($8 instead of
$18 per dose) and a larger quantity (400 doses instead of 200).
To examine the social cost of monopoly power, lets imagine we start with a per-
fectly competitive market, and then switch to a monopoly. Consumers will be worse
off under monopoly, and we can use the concept of consumer surplus to determine
just how much worse off they will be. As we saw in the chapter on market efficiency,
consumer surplus is shown by the area between the demand curve and the horizontal
price line. In Figure 25.4, the monopoly price is $18, so the consumer surplus with a
monopoly is shown by triangle A. In contrast, the perfectly competitive price is $8, so
the consumer surplus with perfect competition is shown by the larger triangle consist-
ing of triangle A, rectangle B, and triangle D. In other words, a switch from perfect
competition to monopoly decreases consumer surplus by the areas B and D.
We can use some simple geometry to compute the reduction in consumer surplus.

In Figure 25.4, the base of rectangle B is 200 and the height is $10, so the area is $2,000:
The switch to monopoly increases the price by $10 per dose, so consumers pay $10 extra
on the 200 doses they buy from the monopolist, resulting in a loss of $2,000. The other
part of the consumer loss is triangle D. The formula for the area of a triangle is
In Figure 25.4, the base of triangle D is 200 and the height is $10, so the area is $1,000:
The switch to monopoly increases the price and decreases the quantity demanded because
consumers obey the law of demand. Consumers lose consumer surplus on the doses they
would have consumed at the lower price, and this $1,000 loss is shown by triangle D. The
total loss of consumers is the sum of the areas of rectangle B and triangle D, or $3,000.
It s clear that consumers lose from monopoly, but what about the monopolist?
Under perfect competition, each firm makes zero economic profit. In contrast, the
monopolist earns positive economic profit, shown by rectangle B in Figure 25.4.
The monopolist s profit per dose is $10, the $18 price minus the $8 average cost.
The monopolists profit is $2,000:
This $2,000 gain by the monopolist comes at the expense of consumers.
Because the monopolist recovers only part of the loss experienced by consumers,
there is a net loss from switching to monopoly. Consumers lose rectangle B and trian-
gle D, but the monopolist gains only rectangle B. That leaves triangle D as the net
decrease in the market surplus, or the deadweight loss from monopoly. The word
deadweight indicates this loss is not offset by a gain to anyone. Triangle D measures the
consumer surplus lost because the monopoly produces less output than a perfectly
competitive market. The monopolist prevents consumers from getting consumer sur-
plus for the 201st through the 400th units of output, meaning it reduces the size of the
economic pie and causes inefficiency. The lesson is that monopoly is inefficient
because it generates less output than a perfectly competitive market.
Rent Seeking: Using Resources to Get Monopoly Power
Another source of inefficiency from a monopoly is the use of resources to acquire
monopoly power. Because a monopoly is likely to earn a profit, firms are willing to spend
money to persuade the government to erect barriers to entry that grant monopoly power
through licenses, franchises, and tariffs. In Figure 25.4, a firm would be willing to spend
up to $2,000 per hour to get a monopoly on the arthritis drug. One way to get monopoly
power is to hire lobbyists to persuade legislators and other policymakers to grant monop-
oly power. Rent seeking is the process of using public policy to gain economic profit.
Rent seeking is inefficient because it uses resources that could be used in other ways.
For example, the people employed as lobbyists could instead produce goods and ser-
vices. In Figure 25.4, if the monopolist spent all its potential profit of $2,000 per hour on
rent-seeking activity, the net loss to society would be areas B and D, not just area D. A
classic study of rent seeking by economist Richard Posner found that firms in some
industries spent up to 30 percent of their total revenue to get monopoly power.2
As an example of rent seeking, consider Coca-Cola s apparent generosity to a
large state university. The company paid for a new football scoreboard and gave
$2.3 million to remodel the universitys student center.3 In return, Coca-Cola earned
the exclusive right to sell beverages on campus. Like any monopolist, Coca-Cola will
use its monopoly power to charge higher prices, so the cost of the scoreboard and stu-
dent center actually comes out of the pockets of students.

PART 9
Monopoly and Public Policy
Given the social costs of monopoly, the government uses a number of policies to
intervene in markets dominated by a single firm or likely to become a monopoly.
We ll examine these policies later in the book. In the case of natural monopoly
a
market that can support only a single firm
the government can intervene by regulat-
ing the price the natural monopolist charges. In other markets, the government uses
antitrust policies to break monopolies into smaller companies and prevent corporate
mergers that would lead to others. These policies are designed to promote competi-
tion, leading to lower prices and more production.
PATENTS AND MONOPOLY POWER
One source of monopoly power is a government patent that gives a firm the exclusive
right to produce a product for 20 years. As we ll see, a patent encourages innovation
because the innovators know they will earn monopoly profits on a new product over
the period covered by the patent. If the monopoly profits are large enough to offset the
substantial research and development costs of a new product, a firm will develop the
product and become a monopolist. Granting monopoly power through a patent may be
efficient from the social perspective because it may encourage the development of
products that would otherwise not be developed.
Incentives for Innovation
Let s use the arthritis drug to show why a patent encourages innovation. Suppose a
firm called Flexjoint hasn t yet developed the drug but believes the potential benefits
and costs of doing so are as follows:
The economic cost of research and development will be $14 million, including
all the opportunity costs of the project.
The estimated annual economic profit from a monopoly will be $2 million (in
todays dollars).
Flexjoint s competitors will need three years to develop and produce their own
versions of the drug, so if Flexjoint isn t protected by a patent, its monopoly will
last only three years.
Based on these numbers, Flexjoint won t develop the drug unless the firm receives
a patent that lasts at least 7 years. Thats the length of time the firm needs to recover
the research and development costs of $14 million ($2 million per year times 7 years).

A CASINO MONOPOLY IN CRESWELL, OREGON?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: What is the value of a monopoly?
A developer interested in building a casino in Creswell, Oregon, placed a curious
announcement in the local newspaper. If local voters approved the casino, the devel-
oper promised to give citizens a total of $2 million per year. With an adult population
of about 1,600, each adult in Creswell would receive a cash payment of $1,250 per
year. Why did the developers propose this deal? This is an example of rent seeking:
The casino developer was seeking the profits that would come from having a monop-
oly in the casino market, and was willing to pay at least $2 million to get it.

CHAPTER 25
MONOPOLY AND PRICE DISCRIMINATION
548
If there is no patent and the firm loses its monopoly in 3 years, it will earn a profit of
$6 million, which is less than the cost of research and development. In comparison,
with a 20-year patent the firm will earn $40 million, which is more than enough to
recover its $14 million cost.
Trade-Offs from Patents
Is the patent for Flexjoint s drug beneficial from the social perspective? The patent
grants monopoly power to the firm, and the firm responds by charging a higher price
and producing less than the quantity that would be produced in a perfectly competi-
tive market. Looking back at Figure 25.4, a monopolist produces 200 doses per hour
instead of 400. From societys perspective, 400 doses is better than 200 doses, but we
don t have that choice. Flexjoint won t develop the drug unless a patent protects the
firm from competition for at least seven years. Therefore, societys choice is between
the monopoly outcome of 200 doses or 0 doses. Because a quantity of 200 doses is
clearly better than none, the patent is beneficial from societys perspective.
What about a product a firm develops without the protection of a patent?
Suppose we change the Flexjoint example by altering one number: The cost of
research and development is only $5 million, not $14 million. Suppose it still takes
Flexjoint s competitors three years to develop a substitute, and Flexjoint s profit per
year is still $2 million. Without a patent, Flexjoint would earn an economic profit of
$6 million during its three-year monopoly ($2 million per year times three years),
which is more than the $5 million cost of research and development. Therefore, the
firm would develop the new drug even without a patent. In this case, a patent would
merely prolong a monopoly, and so it would be inefficient from societys perspective.
A P P L I C AT I O N  2
BRIBING THE MAKERS OF GENERIC DRUGS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: What happens when a patent expires and a
monopoly ends?
When a patent expires, new firms enter the market, and the resulting competition for
consumers decreases prices and increases quantities. In the pharmaceutical drug mar-
ket, when the patent for a brand-name drug expires, other firms introduce generic
versions of the drug. The generics are virtually identical to the original branded drug,
but they sell at a much lower price. The producers of branded drugs have an incentive
to delay the introduction of generic drugs and sometimes use illegal means to do so.
In recent years, the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) has investigated allega-
tions that the makers of branded drugs made deals with generic suppliers to keep
generics off the market. The alleged practices included cash payments and exclusive
licenses for new versions of the branded drug. In 2003, the FTC ruled that two drug
makers had entered into an illegal agreement when Schering-Plough paid Upsher-
Smith Laboratories $60 million to delay the introduction of a low-price alternative to
its prescription drug K-Dur 20, which is used to treat people with low potassium.
Another tactic is to claim that generics are not as good as the branded drug.
DuPont has claimed that generic versions of its Coumadin (a blood thinner) are not
equivalent to Coumadin and may pose risks to patients. Because generic versions are
virtually identical to the branded drugs, such claims are not based on science.

PART 9
What are the general conclusions about the merits of the patent system? It is sen-
sible for a government to grant a patent for a product that would otherwise not be
developed, but it is not sensible for other products. Unfortunately, no one knows in
advance whether a particular product would be developed without a patent, so the
government can t be selective in granting patents. In some cases, patents lead to new
products, while in other cases, they merely prolong monopoly power.
PRICE DISCRIMINATION
Up to this point in the book, we ve assumed a firm charges the same price to all its
customers. As we ll see in this part of the chapter, however, a firm may be able to
divide consumers into two or more groups and sell the good at a different price to
each, a practice known as price discrimination. For example, airlines offer discount
tickets to travelers who are flexible in their departure times, and movie theaters have
lower prices for senior citizens. The only legal restriction on price discrimination is
that a firm cannot use it to drive rival firms out of business.
Although price discrimination is widespread, it is not always possible. A firm has
an opportunity for price discrimination if three conditions are met:
1 Market power.
The firm must have some control over its price, facing a nega-
tively sloped demand curve for its product. Although we will discuss price dis-
crimination by a monopolist, any firm that faces a negatively sloped demand
curve can charge different prices to different consumers. In fact, the only type of
firm that cannot engage in price discrimination is a perfectly competitive price-
taking firm. Such a firm faces a horizontal demand curve, taking the market price
as given. For all other types of markets
monopoly, oligopoly, and monopolistic
competition
price discrimination is possible.
2 Different consumer groups.
Consumers must differ in their willingness to
pay for the product or in their responsiveness to changes in price, as measured by
the price elasticity of demand. In addition, the firm must be able to identify dif-
ferent groups of consumers. For example, an airline must be able to distinguish
between business travelers and tourists, and a movie theater must be able to dis-
tinguish between seniors and nonseniors.
3 Resale is not possible.
It must be impractical for one consumer to resell the
product to another consumer. Airlines prohibit consumers from buying and
reselling tickets. If airlines allowed consumers to sell discount tickets to each
other, you could go into business as a ticket broker, buying discount airline tick-
ets one month ahead and then selling them to business travelers one week before
the travel date. In general, the possibility of resale causes price discrimination to
break down.
One approach to price discrimination is to identify consumers who are not willing
to pay the regular price and offer them a discount. Here are some examples:
Discounts on airline tickets. Airlines offer discount tickets to travelers who
spend Saturday night away from home because they are likely to be tourists,
not business travelers. The typical tourist is not willing to pay as much for air
travel as the typical business traveler. Airlines also offer discount tickets to
people who plan weeks ahead, because tourists plan further ahead than busi-
ness travelers.
Discount coupons for groceries and restaurant food. The typical coupon-
clipper is not willing to pay as much as the typical consumer.
Manufacturers  rebates for appliances. A person who takes the trouble to
mail a rebate form to the manufacturer is not willing to pay as much as the typ-
ical consumer.
25.4
price discrimination
The practice of selling a good at different
prices to different consumers.

CHAPTER 25
MONOPOLY AND PRICE DISCRIMINATION
550
Senior-citizen discounts on airline tickets, restaurant food, drugs, and
entertainment. Some seniors have more time to shop for bargains, and are thus
more sensitive to prices. Other seniors have relatively low income, and are will-
ing to pay less than the typical consumer.
Student discounts on movies and concerts. The typical student has less
income than the typical consumer, and is thus willing to pay less for movies.
The challenge for a firm is to figure out which groups of consumers should get
discounts. Firms can experiment with different prices and identify groups of con-
sumers that are most sensitive to price. In September 2000, Amazon.com started
charging different prices for different types of consumers. For example, consumers
who used Netscape s browser paid $65 for the Planet of the Apes DVD, while Internet
Explorer users paid $75 for the same DVD.4 Prices also varied with the consumers
Internet service provider and the number of previous purchases from Amazon. An
Amazon spokeswoman said the company varied prices in a random fashion, as part of
ongoing tests to see how consumers respond to price changes. In other words, it appears
that Amazon was assessing the willingness to pay of different types of consumers. In prin-
ciple, Amazon could use the data collected to develop systems of price discrimination, giv-
ing discounts to the most price-sensitive consumers. After widespread protests of the
Amazon pricing experiments, the company stopped the practice and issued refunds to
about 7,000 consumers who had paid relatively high prices.
Senior Discounts in Restaurants
Consider a restaurant whose patrons fall into two groups, senior citizens and others.
In Figure 25.5, the demand curve for senior citizens is lower than the demand curve
for other groups, reflecting the assumption that the typical senior is willing to pay less
than the typical nonsenior. Their lower willingness to pay could result from having
lower income or more time to shop for low prices.
Under a price-discrimination plan, the restaurant will simply apply the marginal
principle twice, once for seniors and a second time for nonseniors. This approach is
sensible, because the two groups have different demands for restaurant meals, so the
restaurant should treat them differently. Panel A of Figure 25.5 shows how to pick a
price for senior citizens. The marginal principle
marginal revenue equals marginal
cost
is satisfied at point a, with 280 senior meals per day. Therefore, the appropriate
price for seniors is $3, as shown by point b on the senior demand curve. In Panel B of
Figure 25.5, the marginal principle is satisfied at point c for nonseniors, with
260 meals per day and a price of $6 per meal.
We know the application of the marginal principle maximizes profit in each seg-
ment of the market. Therefore, price discrimination
with a price of $3 for seniors
and $6 for everyone else
maximizes the restaurant s total profit. If the restaurant

The Marginal Principle and Price

To engage in price discrimination, the
firm divides potential customers into
two groups and applies the marginal
principle twice

Using the marginal principle, the profit-
maximizing prices are $3 for seniors
(point b) and $6 for nonseniors (point d).

were instead to charge a single price of $5 for both groups, the profit from each group
would be lower, so the restaurants total profit would be lower, too.
Price Discrimination and the Elasticity of Demand
We can use the concept of price elasticity of demand to explain why price discrimina-
tion increases the restaurant s profit. From the chapter on elasticity, we know that
when demand is elastic (Ed > 1), there is a negative relationship between price and
total revenue: When the price decreases, total revenue (price times quantity sold)
increases because the percentage increase in the quantity demanded exceeds the per-
centage decrease in price.
Suppose the restaurant initially has a single price of $5 for both seniors and nonse-
niors. Compared to other consumers, senior citizens have more elastic demand for
restaurant meals, in part because they have lower income and more time to shop for low
prices. A price cut for senior citizens brings good news and bad news for the restaurant:
Good news: Demand is highly elastic, so total revenue increases by a large
amount.
Bad news: More meals are served, so total cost increases.
If the senior demand for meals is highly elastic, that is, Ed is well above 1.0, the good
news will dominate the bad news: The increase in revenue will more than offset the
increase in cost. Consequently, a price cut will increase the firm s profit.
For nonseniors, the firm will have an incentive to increase the price above the ini-
tial common price of $5. Suppose nonseniors have a mildly elastic demand for meals,
with Ed just above 1.0. A price hike for nonseniors brings bad news on the revenue side
and good news on the cost side:
Bad news: Demand is mildly elastic, so total revenue decreases by a small amount.
Good news: Fewer meals are served, so total cost decreases.
If the demand by nonseniors is mildly elastic, the good news will dominate the bad
news: The savings in production costs will exceed the revenue loss. Consequently, the
price hike for nonseniors will increase the firm s profit.
Examples: Movie Admission versus Popcorn, and Hardback
versus Paperback Books
Why do senior citizens pay less than everyone else for admission to a movie, but the
same as everyone else for popcorn? As we ve seen, a senior discount is not an act of
generosity by a firm, but an act of profit maximization. Senior citizens are typically
willing to pay less than other citizens for movies, so a theater divides its consumers
into two groups
seniors and others
and offers a discount to seniors. This price dis-
crimination in favor of senior citizens increases the theater s profit. Why don t the-
aters offer a senior discount for popcorn? Unlike admission to the theater, popcorn
can be easily transferred from one customer to another. If senior citizens could buy
popcorn at half the regular price, many nonseniors would get seniors to buy popcorn
for them, so the theater wouldn t sell as much popcorn at the regular price and its
profit would decrease. In contrast, as long as ticket takers check consumers  admis-
sions tickets, admission to the movie is not transferable.
Why are hardback books so much more expensive than paperback books? Most
books are published in two forms
hardback and paperback. Although the cost of pro-
ducing a hardback book is only about 20 percent higher than producing a paperback, the
hardback price is typically three times the paperback price. The hardback edition comes
first, and the paperback edition is published months, or even years, later. Booksellers use
hardbacks and paperbacks to distinguish between two types of consumers: those who are
willing to pay a lot and those who are willing to pay a little. Some people are eager to

read a book when it first comes out, and publishers provide them with high-price hard-
backs. The more casual readers are willing to wait for the lower-priced paperback. The
pricing of hardback and paperback books is another example of price discrimination,
under which consumers with less elastic demand pay a higher price.

PAYING FOR A COLD SOFT DRINK ON A HOT DAY
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: When do firms have an opportunity to
charge different prices to different consumers?
On a hot day, are you willing to pay more than you normally would for an ice-cold can
of Coke? If so, you re the type of consumer Coca-Cola Company had in mind when it
developed a high-tech vending machine, complete with heat sensors and microchips,
that charges a higher price when the weather is hot. According to then-CEO Douglas
Ivester, the desire for a cold drink increases when the weather is hot, so it is sensible that
the price is higher. 
The announcement of the new vending machine led to howls of protest from
consumers, and Coca-Cola Company responded by saying that it had no plans to
actually use the new machine. The company said that it developed the machine as part
of its ongoing exploration of new technology designed to improve product availability
and provide consumers with interactive experiences with vending machines. Based on
the reaction to the news of the heat-sensing vending machine, you can imagine the
interaction between a consumer and a vending machine that charges a higher price for
a cold drink on a hot day.

RADIOHEAD LETS CONSUMERS PICK THE PRICE
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: Does voluntary pricing work?
In late 2007, Radiohead released its album In Rainbows for downloading directly from its
Web site. The band adopted an unusual pricing strategy: Let each consumer decide how
much to pay. This looks like price discrimination with a twist. Suppose everyone pays a
fixed fraction of his or her willingness to pay for the album, say half. Under voluntary
pricing, Radiohead would continue to collect lots of money from people who are willing
to pay a lot for the album, and also get money from people who are willing to pay only a
few dollars. The twist is that consumers decide how much to pay, and we d expect some
freeloaders. It turned out that roughly 60 percent of U.S. consumers simply downloaded
the album for free, and the other 40 percent voluntarily paid an average of $8.05.
Worldwide, about 38 percent paid something, and the average price was $6.00.
What are the trade-offs in Radioheads pricing strategy? Suppose for the moment
that each downloader in the United States would have purchased a $15.00 CD if it
were available, so the only effect of voluntary pricing was that customers switched from
buying CDs to downloading. The typical music artist gets roughly 15 percent of the
revenue from the sale of a CD, or $2.25 for a $15.00 album. Using the U.S. numbers
listed earlier, the average payment from a Radiohead downloader (including the people
who paid and the freeloaders) was $3.22. In this case, Radiohead s strategy would
increase its total revenue, because it would get an average of $3.22 per customer rather

553
than $2.25 from a music company. Across the world market, however, fewer people
paid and the payment per person was lower. The average payment from a downloader
was only $2.28, or just above the revenue from a conventional CD.
These simple calculations ignore two other possible benefits of Radioheads pric-
ing scheme. A switch to voluntary pricing could convert some freeloaders (people who
exploited illegal file swapping) into paying customers. And voluntary pricing could
attract new customers who weren t willing to pay $15 for a CD. If voluntary pricing
converts some freeloaders and attracts new customers, it will be lucrative.

In this chapter, we ve seen
some of the subtleties of
monopolies and their pricing
policies. Compared to a per-
fectly competitive market, a
monopoly charges a higher
price, produces a smaller quan-
tity, and wastes resources in the
pursuit of monopoly power. On the positive side, some of the
products we use today might never have been invented without
the patent system and the monopoly power it grants. Firms with
market power often use price discrimination to increase their
profits. Here are the main points of the chapter:
1 Compared to a perfectly competitive market, a market
served by a monopolist will charge a higher price, produce
a smaller quantity of output, and generate a deadweight
loss to society.
2 Some firms use resources to acquire monopoly power, a
process known as rent seeking.
3 Patents protect innovators from competition, leading to
higher prices for new products but greater incentives to
develop new products.
4 To engage in price discrimination, a firm divides its cus-
tomers into two or more groups and charges lower prices to
groups with more elastic demand.
5 Price discrimination is not an act of generosity; it s an act of
profit maximization.

The Monopolist s Output Decision
1.1
For a monopolist, marginal revenue is 
(greater/less) than price.
1.2
A monopoly that cuts its price gains revenue from its
customers but loses revenue from its
customers.
1.3
At a price of $18 per CD, a firm sells 60 CDs. If the
slope of the demand curve is $0.10, marginal revenue
for the 61st CD is $
. The firm should cut
25.1
the price to sell one more CD if the marginal cost is
less than $
.
1.4
Arrow up or down: As the quantity produced by a
monopolist increases, the gap between the marginal-
revenue curve and demand curve

1.5
To maximize profit, a monopolist picks the quantity at
which 
equals

1.6
Arrows up or down: At a price of $18 per CD, the
marginal revenue of a CD seller is $12. If the marginal
cost of CDs is $9, the firm should 
its
price to 
the quantity.

1.7
You want to determine the profit-maximizing quantity
for a monopolist. You can ask the firm s accountant to
draw the firm s revenue and costs curves, but each
curve will cost you $1,000. From the following list,
indicate which curves you will request: average total
cost, average fixed cost, average variable cost, mar-
ginal cost, demand, marginal revenue.
1.8
Book Pricing: Publishers versus Authors. Consider
the problem of setting a price for a book. The mar-
ginal cost of production is constant at $20 per book.
The publisher knows from experience that the slope of
the demand curve is $0.20 per book: Starting with a
price of $44, a price cut of $0.20 will increase the
quantity demanded by one book. For example, here
are some combinations of price and quantity:
b. If the owner picks the price that maximizes profit,
how many seats in the arena will be empty? Why is
it rational to leave some seats empty?
c. Suppose the owner could engage in price
discrimination. Would you expect the number of
filled seats to increase or decrease? Explain.
1.11 Negative Marginal Revenue. The manager of your
firm is puzzled because the larger the quantity of out-
put sold, the lower its total revenue. The manager
gets weekly data in a table with two columns of num-
bers: Quantity Sold and Total Revenue. After you do
some computations and add a third and a fourth col-
umn of numbers, the manager looks at the new table
and says, Aha, now I see why selling more decreases
total revenue.
a. The third column of numbers has data on
, and the fourth column has data on
.
b. How do the additional columns of numbers explain
the negative relationship between quantity sold and
total revenue?

list gets a profit at the expense of consumers.

2.3
The deadweight loss from monopoly is shown graphi-
cally by the area between the 
curve and
the 
curve between the 
quantity and the 
quantity.
2.4
The average cost for providing off-street parking is
$30 per space per day, and as a monopolist you could
charge $35 per space per day for 200 spaces. The max-
imum amount that you are willing to pay for a monop-
oly is $

Ending a Casino Monopoly. Consider a state that
initially has a single casino for gambling. Suppose the
state allows a second casino to enter the market. How
would you expect the entry of the second casino to
affect (a) the variety of games offered in the casinos
and (b) the payout (winnings) per dollar spent?

Payoff for Casino Approval. Recall the Application

c. Why would the publisher and the author disagree
about the price for the book?
d. Design an alternative author-compensation scheme
under which the author and the publisher would
choose the same price.
1.9
Restaurant Pricing. Consider a restaurant that charges
$10 for all you can eat and has 30 customers at this price.
The slope of the demand curve is $0.10 per meal, and
the marginal cost of providing a meal is $3. Compute
the profit-maximizing price and quantity, and illustrate
with a complete graph.
1.10 Empty Seats. Consider the Slappers, a hockey team
that plays in an arena with 8,000 seats. The only cost
associated with staging a hockey game is a fixed cost
of $6,000: The team incurs this cost regardless of
how many people attend a game. The demand curve
for hockey tickets has a slope of $0.001 per ticket
($1 divided by 1,000 tickets): Each $1 increase in
price decreases the number of tickets sold by 1,000.
For example, here are some combinations of price
and quantity:
Price per ticket
$4
$5
$6
$7
Quantity of tickets
8,000

The owners objective is to maximize the profit per
hockey game (total revenue minus the $6,000 fixed cost).
a. What single price will maximize profit?

2.8
Consumer Compensation. Consider the story of
Coca-Cola and the scoreboard in the chapter. Your job
is to fully compensate each student for the cost associ-
ated with the soft-drink monopoly. Suppose Coca-
Cola increased the price of soft drinks by $0.20 per
can and each student consumed 10 soft drinks before
the monopoly was granted.
a. Kate continues to buy 10 soft drinks at the higher
price. What is the appropriate compensation for her?
b. Elise buys only 4 soft drinks at the higher price.
Her demand curve is linear. What is her
appropriate compensation? Draw a graph that
shows her change in consumer surplus.
2.9
Pricing with Zero Marginal Cost. Consider a nat-
ural spring that produces water with a unique taste.
The monopolist who owns the spring has a fixed cost
of installing plumbing to tap the water but no mar-
ginal cost. The demand curve for the spring water is
linear. Draw a graph to show the monopolists choice
of a price and quantity. At the profit-maximizing
quantity, what is the price elasticity of demand? If the
spring were owned by a government that applied the
marginal principle, what price would it charge?
2.10 Rules of Monopoly. In the board game Monopoly, a
player who gets the third deed for a group of properties
(for example, the third of three orange properties) dou-
bles the rent charged to all other players who land on any
property in the group. Similarly, a player who has a single
railroad charges a rent of $25, while a player who has all
four railroads charges a rent of $200 for each railroad.
a. Are these pricing rules consistent with the analysis
of monopoly in this chapter?
b. In the game, is there a deadweight loss from
monopoly? Why or why not?
2.11 The National Park Service Monopoly.
The
National Park service grants a single firm the right to
sell food and other goods in Yosemite National Park.
a. What are the trade-offs associated with this policy?
Who gains and who loses?
b. Does your answer to part (a) depend on whether
the monopoly is granted as a political favor or
auctioned to the highest bidder?
2.12 Deadweight Loss and Demand Elasticity. Using
Figure 25.4 as a starting point, consider a similar
product that has the same monopoly price and quan-
tity ($18 and 200 doses), but a more elastic demand.
The long-run marginal cost is the same ($8).
a. A more elastic demand generates a 
(flatter/steeper) market demand curve.
b. Draw a graph like the one shown in Figure 25.4
and show the deadweight loss from the monopoly
on the product.
c. The deadweight loss is 
(larger/smaller)
than the loss shown in Figure 25.4 because the change
in 
is 
(larger/smaller).
Patents and Monopoly Power
3.1
A patent increases the incentive to develop new prod-
ucts because it 
the price of the product
and thus generates profit to cover a firm s costs of
.
3.2
In some cases, a patent is socially inefficient because it
merely 
; in other cases, a patent is socially
beneficial because it

3.3
Consider the arthritis drug example on page 547. If
the research and development costs are $20 million,
Flexjoint will develop the drug if it gets a patent that
lasts at least 
years.
3.4
To prolong their monopoly power, the producers of
branded drugs pay millions of dollars to 
.
(Related to Application 2 on page 548.)
3.5
Paying to Keep a Generic Out. Suppose your firm
produces a branded drug at an average cost of $2 per
dose and a price of $5 per dose. You sell 1,000 doses
per day. If a generic version of the drug were intro-
duced, your daily sales would decrease to 400 doses.
How much are you willing to pay each day to prevent
the entry of the generic version? (Related to
Application 2 on page 548.)
3.6
Patent for NoSmak. A potential new drug, NoSmak,
could cure lip-smacking with one dose, but research and
development would cost $80 million. The monopoly
profit (earned while a single firm produces the product)
will be $10 million per year. After a patent expires, the
original developer of the drug will have sufficient brand
loyalty to earn $3 million per year for another 10 years.
a. What is the shortest patent length required to
induce a firm to develop the drug?
b. How would your answer to part (a) change if you
ignore the profit earned after the patent expires?
Price Discrimination
4.1
A price-discriminating firm will charge a higher price to
consumers with a relatively 
(elastic/
inelastic) demand and a lower price to consumers with a
relatively 
(elastic/inelastic) demand.
4.2
The aspirin sold in airports is more expensive than
aspirin sold in grocery stores because the demand for
aspirin in airports is relatively 
.
4.3
The rationale for charging a higher price for a soft drink
on a hot day is that demand is 
(more/less)
elastic on hot days. (Related to Application 3 on
page 552.)
4.4
Radiohead s pricing strategy will be profitable if the
average payment per downloader is at least $3.00.

Senior citizens pay less than everyone else for admis-
sion to a movie, but the same as everyone else for pop-
corn because popcorn is

4.6
The price of a hardback edition of a best-selling book is
typically three times the price of the paperback edition
because the demand from the eager consumers who buy
hardbacks is relatively

4.7
Trade-Offs from a Heat-Sensing Vending
Machine. Suppose a soft-drink vending machine has a
capacity of 180 cans and is filled every 10 days. The
following table shows the quantities demanded on hot
and cold days with different prices. The first row
shows what happens with a single price of $2, and the
second row shows what happens with heat-based pric-
ing. (Related to Application 3 on page 552.)
royalty of $2.25 per CD. If the band releases the
album for downloading from its Web site at a volun-
tary price, 4.5 million people will download. Under
what circumstances will the band be indifferent
between a conventional CD release and downloading
with a voluntary price? (Related to Application 4 on
page 552.)
4.10 Book Pricing and Elasticity of Demand. A pub-
lisher initially prices both hardback books and paper-
back books at $20 per book. The hardback version
comes out first, followed two months later by the
paperback version. The publisher initially sells the
same number of hardbacks and paperbacks (100 each).
Each book costs $2 to produce.

a. How does the switch to heat-based pricing affect
the total quantity sold when there are 5 hot days
and 5 cold days?
b. This occurs because the cold-weather consumers,
who experience a lower price, have a 
(more/less) elastic demand than hot-weather
consumers, who experience a higher price.

Senior Discounts for Movies. Your movie theater
charges a single price of $6. The marginal cost of each
patron is $1. A recent marketing survey revealed the fol-
lowing information about senior citizens and nonseniors.
a. The marginal revenue for senior citizens is
$
, while the marginal revenue for
nonseniors is $

principle tells you to 
the price for

Radiohead s Voluntary Pricing. Suppose that if
Radiohead were to release its new album as a $15 CD,
it would sell 4 million copies and earn the standard
b. The price elasticity of demand for hardback (eager)
buyers is 0.50, and the price elasticity of demand
for paperback (patient) buyers is 2.00. Suppose the
publisher increases the price for hardbacks by
10 percent and decreases the price of paperbacks by
10 percent. Complete the following table.
c. Does price discrimination increase or decrease the
publisher s profit?
4.11 Haircuts in Mulletville. The town of Mulletville has
a single hairstylist. The marginal cost of a haircut is
the same for men and women ($10). The quantity of
haircuts is 100 for men and 100 for women. The
profit-maximizing price for women is $35, compared
to $15 for men.
a. What explains the price difference?
b. Illustrate with a complete graph.
4.12 Tax Cuts for Discounters? Consider the following
statement from a member of a city council: Several of
the merchants in our city offer discounts to our senior
citizens. These discounts obviously decrease the mer-
chants  profits, so we should decrease the merchants
taxes to offset their losses on senior-citizen discounts.
Do you agree or disagree? Explain.

4.13 Airline Pricing. Consider an airline that initially has a
single price of $300 for all consumers. At this price, it
has 120 business travelers and 80 tourists. The airlines
marginal cost is $100. The slope of the business
demand curve is $2 per traveler, and the slope of the
tourist demand curve is $1 per traveler. Does the single-
price policy maximize the airline s profit? If not, how
should it change its prices?

ECO NO M I C EX PERI M EN T
Price Discrimination
An experiment shows how a monopolist
a museum
picks
different prices for different consumer groups. Here is how
the experiment works:
The instructor picks a group of three to five students to
represent the museum.
Of the remaining students
potential museum patrons
half represent senior citizens with senior-citizen cards.
Each consumer receives a number indicating how much
he or she is willing to pay for a trip to a museum.
In each round of the experiment, the museum posts two
prices: one for senior citizens and one for nonseniors.
Each consumer then decides whether to buy a ticket at
the relevant posted price.
A consumer s score in a particular round equals the dif-
ference between his or her given willingness to pay and
the amount he or she actually paid for admission.
The museums score in each round equals its profit, or its
total revenue minus its total cost. The total cost equals $2
per patron (for ticket-takers, guides, cleanup, and other
tasks) times the number of tickets sold.
The experiment runs for five rounds. After the fifth
round, each consumer computes his or her score by
adding up the consumer surpluses. The museums score
equals the sum of its profits from the five rounds.

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
In the recession that started in 2008, some industries
actually experienced increases in demand that caused
market entry
new firms entered the markets.1 When
total employment and income dropped, many consumers
switched from buying new shoes to repairing old shoes,
and the demand for shoe repair increased. In 2008 the
sales of adult footwear decreased by about 3 percent, and
the volume of shoe repairs increased dramatically; news-
papers reported that in some shops sales increased by
40 to 50 percent. Some consumers purchased used shoes
in thrift shops and brought them to cobblers for repairs and
reconditioning. The surge in sales increased the profits of
shoe-repair shops, and firms entered the market by open-
ing new shops. The entry of new firms reversed
at least
temporarily
a long decline of shoe-repair shops. The
number of shops in the United States decreased from
120,000 during the Great Depression to 7,000 in 2008. As
the economy comes out of the recession, the question is
whether the long-term trend of disappearing cobblers will
be restored, or whether a new consumer thriftiness will
allow more cobblers to stay in business.

I
n this chapter, we explore a firm s decision to enter a market and examine the
consequences of entry on prices and the profits of other firms. Firms will enter
a market as long as they can make an economic profit. As we ll see, the entry of
firms squeezes profit in three ways: The price decreases, the average cost of pro-
duction increases, and the quantity sold per firm decreases. Eventually the entry
process stops, and we can count the number of firms serving the market. If entry
stops at a single firm, we have a natural monopoly, a topic we cover later in the
book. If many firms enter the market, we have monopolistic competition, the topic
of this chapter.
Monopolistic competition is a hybrid market structure, with features of both
monopoly and perfect competition. The term may seem like an oxymoron
a pair of
contradictory words
similar to virtual reality  and books on tape.  However, the
term actually conveys the two key features of the market:
Each firm in the market produces a good that is slightly different from the
goods of other firms, so each firm has a narrowly defined monopoly.
The products sold by different firms in the market are close substitutes for one
another, so there is intense competition between firms for consumers. For exam-
ple, your local grocery store may stock several brands of toothbrushes with dif-
ferent design features. If the price of one brand increases, some loyal customers
will continue to buy the brand, but others will switch to different brands that
are close substitutes.
Some other examples of monopolistic competition are the markets for bread, cloth-
ing, restaurant meals, and gasoline. In each case, firms in the market sell products that
are close, but not perfect, substitutes.
The analysis in this chapter is based on two assumptions. First, we assume there
are no barriers to entry: There are no patents or government licensing programs to
restrict the number of firms. Second, we assume that firms do not act strategically:
Each firm acts on its own, taking the actions of other firms as given. This means that
firms already in the market do not conspire to fix prices and do not try to prevent
other firms from entering the market. In the next chapter, we ll explore several types
of strategic behavior in an oligopoly, a market with just a few firms.
THE EFFECTS OF MARKET ENTRY
Consider a market served by a single profitable firm, a monopolist. As we saw earlier
in the book, a firm in any market can use the marginal principle to decide how much
output to produce.
M A R G I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds its
marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal benefit equals the
marginal cost.
Consider a firm whose activity is producing toothbrushes. On the cost side, the
firm has the conventional cost curves: For small quantities produced, the average-cost
curve is negatively sloped and marginal cost is less than average cost. On the benefit
side, the marginal benefit of producing toothbrushes is the marginal revenue from
selling one more brush. In Panel A of Figure 26.1, if a single firm produces tooth-
brushes, the firm-specific demand curve (the demand curve applicable to a specific

Market Entry Decreases Price and Squeezes Profit
(A) A monopolist maximizes profit at point a, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The firm
sells 300 toothbrushes at a price of $2.00 (point b) and an average cost of $0.90 (point c). The profit
of $330 is shown by the shaded rectangle.
(B) The entry of a second firm shifts the firm-specific demand curve for the original firm to the left.
The firm produces only 200 toothbrushes (point d) at a lower price ($1.80, shown by point e) and a
higher average cost ($1.00, shown by point f ). The firms profit, shown by the shaded rectangle,
shrinks to $160.

firm) is the same as the market demand curve. As we saw in the chapter on monopoly,
the firm s marginal-revenue curve lies below the demand curve because a monopolist
must cut its price to sell more output.
As we saw in the previous chapter, a monopolist maximizes profit by picking the
quantity at which marginal revenue equals marginal cost. In Figure 26.1, this happens
at point a, with a quantity of 300 toothbrushes. From point b on the demand curve,
the price associated with this quantity is $2.00. From point c on the average-cost
curve, we see that the average cost of this quantity is $0.90. The firms profit, shown
by the shaded rectangle, is $330:
Given the large profits in the toothbrush market, will a second firm enter the market?
Entry Squeezes Profits from Three Sides
Suppose a second firm, producing a slightly different toothbrush, enters the mar-
ket. When the second firm enters, the firm-specific demand curve for the original
firm will shift to the left. At any particular price, some consumers will patronize the
new firm, so there will be fewer consumers for the original firm: The original firm
will sell fewer brushes at each price. In Panel B of Figure 26.1, the firm-specific
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity = ($2.00 - $0.90) * 300 = $330

561
PART 9
demand curve for the original monopolist shifts to the left, and profit decreases for
three reasons:
1 The market price drops.
The marginal principle is satisfied at point d, so the orig-
inal firm now produces 200 toothbrushes at a price of $1.80 (point e). The com-
petition between the two firms causes the price to drop, from $2.00 to $1.80.
2 The quantity produced by the first firm decreases.
The original firm produces only
200 toothbrushes, down from the 300 it produced as a monopolist.
3 The first firm s average cost of production increases.
The decrease in the quantity
produced causes the firm to move upward along its negatively sloped average-
cost curve to a higher average cost per toothbrush, from $0.90 to $1.00 (point f ).
The effects of entry are shown by comparing the profit rectangles in Panels A
and B of Figure 26.1. Entry shrinks the firms profit rectangle because it is squeezed
from three directions. The top of the rectangle drops because the price decreases. The
bottom of the rectangle rises because the average cost increases. The right side of the
rectangle moves to the left because the quantity decreases. In this example, profit
drops from $330 to $160:
What about the second firm? If we assume the second firm has access to the same
production technology as the first firm and pays the same prices for its inputs, the
cost curves for the second firm will be the same as the cost curves for the first firm. If
the product of the second firm is nearly identical to the product of the first firm, the
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity = ($1.80 - $1.00) * 200 = $160

NAME BRANDS VERSUS STORE BRANDS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How does brand competition within stores
affect prices?
In many stores, nationally advertised brands share the shelves with store brands. For
example, you can buy Kelloggs Frosted Flakes or Safeways Frosted Flakes. Similarly,
Bayer Aspirin shares a shelf with Safeway Aspirin. The introduction of a store brand is
a form of market entry
a new competitor for a national brand
and usually
decreases the price of the national brand.
The classic example of the price effects of store brands occurred in the market for
lightbulbs. In the early 1980s, the price of a four-pack of General Electric bulbs was
about $3.50. The introduction of store brands at a price of $1.50 caused General
Electric to cut its price to $2.00. In markets without store brands, the General Electric
price remained at $3.50. Similarly, in the market for disposable diapers, increased com-
petition from store brands caused Procter & Gamble to cut its prices by 16 percent.
For a wide variety of products
laundry detergent, ready-to-eat breakfast cereals,
motor oil, and aluminum foil
the entry of store brands decreased the price of national
brands.

firm-specific demand curve for the second firm will be nearly identical to the firm-
specific demand curve of the first firm. As an approximation, we can use Panel B of
Figure 26.1 to represent both firms. Each firm produces 200 toothbrushes at an aver-
age cost of $1.00 per toothbrush and sells them at a price of $1.80.
Examples of Entry: Car Stereos, Trucking, and Tires
To illustrate the effects of entry on price, cost, and profit, imagine that you just inher-
ited enough money to start your own car-stereo business. Suppose that the existing
monopolist sells 10 stereos per day at a price of $230 and an average cost of $200 per
stereo, for a profit of $30 per stereo. If you enter the market, the increased competi-
tion will drop the price below $230, and if you sell fewer than 10 stereos (the monop-
oly quantity), your average will be greater than $200 because you will spread your
fixed costs over fewer units. In other words, your entry squeezes profit per unit from
both sides. For example, if the market price drops to $215 and the average cost
increases to $205, your profit per stereo will be $10, significantly less than the monop-
olists initial profit of $30 per stereo.
What happens when the government eliminates artificial barriers to entry? The
Motor Carrier Act of 1980 eliminated the government s entry restrictions on the
trucking industry, most of which had been in place since the 1930s. New firms entered
the trucking market, and freight prices dropped by about 22 percent. The market
value of a firms trucking license indicates how much profit the firm can earn in the
market. Deregulation increased competition and decreased prices and profits, and the
average value of a trucking license dropped from $579,000 in 1977 to less than
$15,000 in 1982.2
Empirical studies of other markets provide ample evidence that entry decreases
market prices and firms  profits. In other words, consumers pay less for goods and ser-
vices, and firms earn lower profits. In one study of the retail pricing of tires, a market
with only two tire stores had a price of $55 per tire, compared to a price of $53 in a
market with three stores, $51 with four stores, and $50 with five stores. The larger the
number of stores, the lower the price of tires.3
MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
We ve seen that the entry of a firm in a profitable market decreases the price and the
profit per firm. Under a market structure called monopolistic competition, firms will con-
tinue to enter the market until economic profit is zero. Here are the features of
monopolistic competition:
Many firms. Because there are relatively small economies of scale, a small firm
can produce its product at about the same average cost as a large firm. For
example, a small donut shop can produce donuts and coffee at about the same
average cost as a large shop. Because even a small firm can cover its costs, the
market can support many firms.
A differentiated product. Firms engage in product differentiation, the process
used by firms to distinguish their products from the products of competing
firms. A firm can distinguish its products from the products of other firms by
offering a different performance level or appearance. For example, automobiles
differ in horsepower and fuel efficiency, and toothpastes differ in flavor and
their ability to clean teeth. Some products are differentiated by the services that
come with them. For example, some stores provide informative and helpful
salespeople, whereas others require consumers to make decisions on their own.

product differentiation
The process used by firms to distinguish
their products from the products of
competing firms.

563
PART 9
Some pizza firms offer home delivery, and some software producers offer free
technical assistance. As we ll see later in the chapter, some products are differ-
entiated by where they are sold.
No artificial barriers to entry. There are no patents or regulations that could pre-
vent firms from entering the market.
These characteristics explain the logic behind the label monopolistic competi-
tion.  Product differentiation means each firm is the sole seller of a narrowly
defined good. For example, each firm in the toothbrush market has a unique design
for its toothbrushes, so each is a monopolist in the narrowly defined market for that
design. Because the products from different firms are close substitutes, there is keen
competition for consumers. When one toothbrush maker increases its price, many
of its consumers will switch to the similar toothbrushes produced by other firms. In
other words, the demand for the product of a monopolistically competitive firm is
very price elastic: An increase in price decreases the quantity demanded by a rela-
tively large amount because consumers can easily switch to another firm selling a
similar product.
When Entry Stops: Long-Run Equilibrium
We ll use the toothbrush example to illustrate the features of monopolistic competi-
tion. The producers of toothbrushes differentiate their products with respect to color,
bristle design, handle size and shape, and durability. As we saw earlier, after a second
firm enters the toothbrush market, both firms still make a profit. Will a third firm
enter this lucrative market? The entry of a third firm will shift the firm-specific
demand curve for each firm further to the left. As we saw earlier, a leftward shift of a
firms demand curve decreases the market price, decreases the quantity produced per
firm, and increases the average cost per toothbrush. If after the third firm enters the
market all three firms still earn positive profit, a fourth firm will enter.
Because there are no barriers to entering the toothbrush market, firms will con-
tinue to enter until each firm makes zero economic profit. Figure 26.2 shows the long-
run equilibrium from the perspective of the typical firm. Suppose a total of six firms
are in the toothbrush market. Given the firm-specific demand curve in a market with
six firms, the typical firm satisfies the marginal principle at point a by selling
80 brushes per minute at a price of $1.40 (point b) and an average cost of $1.40.
Because the price equals the average cost, the typical firm makes zero economic profit.
Each firm s revenue is high enough to cover all its costs
including the opportunity
cost of all its inputs
but not enough to cause additional firms to enter the market. In
other words, each firm makes just enough money to stay in business.
What are the implications of market entry for the market as a whole? In Figure 26.2,
each of the six firms in the market produces 80 toothbrushes at a price of $1.40, so the
total quantity produced is 480. In contrast, we started with a monopoly that had a price of
$2.00 and a quantity of 300 toothbrushes. In other words, market entry decreased the
price from $2.00 to $1.40 and increased the total quantity demanded from 300 to 480,
consistent with the law of demand.
Differentiation by Location
In some monopolistically competitive markets, differentiation is simply a matter of loca-
tion. Some examples are gas stations, music stores, book stores, grocery stores, movie
theaters, and ice-cream parlors. In each case, many firms sell the same product at differ-
ent locations. Your city probably has several book stores, each of which sells a particular
book at about the same price. Everything else being equal, you are likely to purchase
books from the most convenient store, but if a store across town offers lower prices, you

might purchase your books there instead. In other words, each store has a monopoly in
its own neighborhood, but competes with book stores in the rest of the city.
Figure 26.3 shows the long-run equilibrium in the market for books. Because
there are no barriers to entering the market, new book stores will enter the market
until each store makes zero economic profit. The typical book store satisfies the

enough to cause additional stores to enter the market. In other words, the firm makes
just enough money to stay in business.
TRADE-OFFS WITH ENTRY AND
MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION
We ve seen that market entry leads to lower prices and a larger total quantity in the
market. At the same time, entry decreases the output per firm and increases the
average cost of production. As shown in Figures 26.2 and 26.3, monopolistically

OPENING A DUNKIN  DONUTS SHOP
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: What does it take to enter a market with
a franchise?
One way to get into a monopolistically competitive market is to get a franchise for
a nationally advertised product. If you want to get into the donut market, you
could pay a franchise fee of $40,000 to Allied Domecq, the parent company of
Dunkin  Donuts. That gives you the right to sell donuts under the Dunkin
Donuts brand. You ll also get a few weeks of training at the corporate headquar-
ters in Massachusetts and some help in organizing a grand opening. Once you
start making money, you ll pay a royalty to the parent company equal to 5.9 per-
cent of your sales.
How much money are you likely to make in your donut shop? You will compete
for donut consumers with other donut shops, bakeries, grocery stores, and coffee
shops. Given the small barriers to entering the donut business, you should expect keen
competition for consumers. Although your brand-name donuts will give you an edge
over your competitors, remember that you must pay the franchise fee and royalties. In
the monopolistically competitive donut market, you should expect to make zero eco-
nomic profit, with total revenue equal to total cost. Your total cost includes the fran-
chise fee and royalties, as well as the opportunity cost of your time and the
opportunity cost of any funds you invest in the business.
Table 26.1 shows the franchise fees and royalty rates for several franchising
opportunities. The fees indicate how much entrepreneurs are willing to pay for the
right to sell a brand-name product.

MARKET ENTRY AND MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION

competitive firms operate on the negatively sloped portion of their average-cost
curves, so average cost is higher than the minimum. In other words, the average cost
of production would be lower if a single toothbrush firm served the entire market by
providing a single type of toothbrush. What are the other consequences of entry and
monopolistic competition?
Average Cost and Variety
There are some trade-offs associated with monopolistic competition. Although
the average cost of production is higher than the minimum, there is also more
product variety. In a market with many toothbrush firms, consumers can choose
from a wide variety of designs, so the higher average cost is at least partly offset
by greater product variety. Here are two other examples of the benefits of prod-
uct variety:
Restaurant meals. The typical large city has dozens of Italian restaurants, each
of which has a different menu and prepares its food in different ways.
Consumers can pick from restaurants offering a wide variety of menus and
preparation techniques. Although a city with a single Italian restaurant would
have a lower average cost of preparing Italian meals, consumers would get
less variety.
Shoes and clothing. Shoes are differentiated according to their style and per-
formance. If we all wore the same type of shoes, the average cost of produc-
ing shoes would be lower, but consumers would be unable to match their
shoe preferences with suitable shoes. Similarly, if we all wore uniforms, the
average cost of clothing would be lower, but that would eliminate
clothing choice.
What are the trade-offs when products are differentiated by location? When
firms sell the same product at different locations, the larger the number of firms, the
higher the average cost of production. But when firms are numerous, consumers
travel shorter distances to get the product. Therefore, higher production costs are at
least partly offset by lower travel costs. If a large metropolitan area had only one book
store, the average cost of books would be lower, but consumers would spend more
time traveling to get the books.
Monopolistic Competition versus Perfect Competition
Product differentiation is what makes monopolistic competition different from per-
fect competition. Perfectly competitive firms produce homogeneous products, while
monopolistically competitive firms produce differentiated products. Panel A of
Figure 26.4 shows the equilibrium for a perfectly competitive firm. Each price-taking
firm has a horizontal demand curve. Point a shows the long-run equilibrium because
the typical firm (1) satisfies the marginal principle, choosing the quantity where mar-
ginal revenue equals marginal cost, and (2) earns zero economic profit because price
equals average cost:
The only place where price equals both marginal cost and average cost is the mini-
mum point of the average-cost curve, shown by point a.
price = marginal cost = average cost

567
PART 9
Panel B shows the equilibrium for a monopolistically competitive firm. The
firm has a differentiated product, so its demand curve is negatively sloped and
marginal revenue is less than the price. With a negatively sloped demand curve, the
zero-profit condition
price equals average cost
will be satisfied along the nega-
tively sloped portion of the average-cost curve. In other words, the only place
* FIGURE 26.4
Monopolistic Competition versus Perfect Competition
(A) In a perfectly competitive market, the firm-specific demand curve is horizontal at the market
price, and marginal revenue equals price. In equilibrium, price = marginal cost = average cost. The
equilibrium occurs at the minimum of the average-cost curve.
(B) In a monopolistically competitive market, the firm-specific demand curve is negatively sloped and
marginal revenue is less than price. In equilibrium, marginal revenue equals marginal cost (point b)
and price equals average cost (point c).

C3PO AND ENTRY IN THE MARKET FOR SPACE FLIGHT
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: What are the effects of market entry?
The National Atmospheric and Space Administration (NASA) is ending its space-
shuttle program, but has developed programs to encourage firms to enter the market
for space flight. Once the shuttle program is ended, the market will be monopolized
by the Russian Space Agency, which charges a monopoly price of $47 million per
astronaut for a trip to the International Space Station. Under its C3PO program
(Commercial Crew & Cargo Program), NASA is investing financial and technical
resources to stimulate efforts within the private sector to develop and demonstrate
safe, reliable, and cost-effective space transportation capabilities.  The objectives of
the program are to improve the performance and decrease the cost of rockets and to
develop spacecraft suitable for different rockets. The development of cheaper rockets
and more flexible spacecraft will foster competition among space-flight firms. The
increased competition is expected to cut the price of a trip to the space station by more
than half, to about $20 million.

MARKET ENTRY AND MONOPOLISTIC COMPETITION

where a tangency can occur is along the negatively sloped portion of the average-
cost curve. Compared to a perfectly competitive firm, a monopolistically competi-
tive firm produces less output at a higher average cost. In Figure 26.4, the average
cost for the monopolistically competitive firm is P2, compared to P1 for a perfectly
competitive firm.
To illustrate the difference between the two market structures, imagine that product
differentiation diminishes. Suppose, for example, that consumers decide that the
distinguishing features of toothbrushes
color, shape, and bristle design
don t matter.
As a result, the products of competing firms will become better substitutes, so the
demand for a particular firm s product will become more elastic. In Panel B of
Figure 26.4 the firm-specific demand curve will become flatter and will be tangent to the
average-cost curve at a larger quantity, closer to the perfectly competitive quantity Q1. As
differentiation continues to diminish, the firms demand curve will become flatter and
flatter, and we will get closer and closer to the perfectly competitive outcome, where the
average cost reaches its minimum.
ADVERTISING FOR PRODUCT
DIFFERENTIATION
We ve seen that product differentiation is a key feature of monopolistic competition.
A firm can use advertising to inform consumers about the features of its product and
thus distinguish its product from the products of other firms. In addition, advertise-
ments can inform consumers about prices. A famous study of the eyeglass market
found that advertising promoted price competition between firms and reduced eye-
glass prices by about 20 percent.4
Some advertisements don t provide any real information about a product or its
price. You ve seen the advertisements featuring beer drinkers frolicking on the
beach with attractive people, cigarette smokers riding horseback, drivers of sports
cars impressing classmates at high-school reunions, and sport-drink consumers

ADVERTISING AND MOVIE BUZZ
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: What signal does an expensive advertising
campaign send to consumers?
For another example of signaling from advertising, consider movies. A movie dis-
tributor may produce several movies each year but advertise just a few of them.
Although there are few repeat consumers for a particular movie, there is word-of-
mouth advertising, also known as buzz : People who enjoy a movie talk about it
and persuade their friends and family members to see it. If a distributor believes a
movie will be appealing and thus generate a lot of buzz, an advertisement that gets
the buzz started could pay for itself. In contrast, a distributor won t expect much
buzz from a less-appealing movie, so advertising won t be sensible. In general, an
expensive advertisement sends a signal that the movie will generate enough word-
of-mouth advertising to cover the cost of the advertisement.

performing amazing athletic feats. These sorts of advertisements are designed
to promote an image for a product, not to provide information about the prod-
uct s features.
Celebrity Endorsements and Signaling
An advertisement that doesn t provide any product information may actually help
consumers make decisions. Firms spend millions of dollars to get celebrities like
Drew Brees and Kristen Stewart to endorse their products. When a famous athlete or
actor appears in an advertisement for a product, everyone realizes the celebrity is
doing the advertisement for money, not to share his or her enthusiasm for the adver-
tised product. Nonetheless, these advertisements are effective in increasing sales.
Why do they work?
By paying millions of dollars to run an advertisement featuring a celebrity, a
firm sends a signal to consumers that the advertised product is appealing and likely
to be popular. To illustrate this signaling effect, consider a firm that develops a new
energy bar and picks a celebrity to endorse it. The purpose of a celebrity advertise-
ment is to get people to try the product for the first time. After that, a consumer will
base any repeat purchases on the taste and nutritional value of the energy bar.
Suppose an advertisement with a cost of $10 million would cause 10 million con-
sumers to try the energy bar. As shown in the first row of Table 26.2, energy bar A is
an appealing product, and half the consumers who try it will become repeat con-
sumers. If the firm makes a profit of $4 on each repeat customer, the firm s profit of
$20 million exceeds the $10 million cost of the advertisement, so the firm will run
the advertisement.
What about a product that is less appealing? The second row of Table 26.2
shows the effects of an advertisement for energy bar B. Only 1 in 10 people who try
energy bar B will become a repeat customer, so the firm s profit from an advertise-
ment is only $4 million. That is not enough to cover the $10 million cost, so the
firm won t advertise the less-appealing product. Notice that celebrity endorsements
for the two products are equally effective in getting people to try the products, but
what matters is repeat customers. The less-appealing product gets fewer repeat cus-
tomers because it s an inferior product, and that s why it s not worthwhile to pay for
an advertisement.
Celebrity endorsements and other expensive advertising send a signal to con-
sumers that the producer expects many repeat customers. Firms undertake extensive
marketing research to project the sales of their products, and when their research sug-
gests the product will be popular, they have an incentive to spend money on advertis-
ing to send the signal to consumers. The signal tells consumers which new products
are expected to have the greatest general appeal.

Bidding for Bookstore Licenses. Paige initially has
the only license to operate a bookstore in Bookville. She
26.1
charges a price of $9 per book, has an average cost of
$4 per book, and sells 1,001 books per year. When
Paige s license expires, the city decides to auction
two bookstore licenses to the highest bidders.
Suppose the relevant variables (price, average cost,
and output per firm) take on only integer values
no
fraction or decimals.
a. Suppose Paige is optimistic and imagines the best
possible outcome with a two-firm market. What is
the maximum amount she is willing to pay for one
of the two licenses?
b. Suppose Paige is pessimistic and imagines the worst
possible outcome with a two-firm market. What is
the maximum amount she is willing to pay for one
of the two licenses?

Beware the Too-Easy Answer. Your city initially
restricts the number of pizzerias to one. The existing
monopolist sells 3,000 pizzas per day. A pizzeria
reaches the horizontal portion of its long-run average
cost curve at an output of about 1,000 pizzas per day.
Suppose the city eliminates the entry restrictions.

KE Y TE R MS
This chapter is about market
entry and monopolistic com-
petition. In a monopolistically
competitive market, entry con-
tinues until each firm in the
market makes zero economic
profit. Firms can differentiate
their products by design, level
of service, location, or product image. Here are the main points
of the chapter:
1 The entry of a firm into a market decreases the market
price, decreases output per firm, and increases the average
cost of production.
2 In a monopolistically competitive market, firms compete for
customers by producing differentiated products.
3 In the long-run equilibrium with monopolistic competition,
marginal revenue equals marginal cost, price equals average
cost, and economic profit is zero.
4 Under monopolistic competition, the average cost of pro-
duction is higher than the minimum, but there is also more
product variety.
5 A firm can use celebrity endorsements and other costly adver-
tisements to signal its belief that a product will be appealing.

Predict the equilibrium number of pizzerias. Beware
of the TEC (too easy to be correct) answer.
1.10 Equilibrium? In your city, there are currently
three firms providing oil changes. For each firm, there
is a fixed cost of $80 per day and a marginal cost of
$12 per oil change. Each firm currently maximizes its
profit by providing 10 oil changes per day.
a. For each firm, marginal revenue = $

To enter the donut market as a seller of Dunkin
Donuts, you ll pay a one-time franchise fee of

2.5
Willingness to Pay for a Dunkin  Donuts
Franchise. You operate a Dunkin  Donuts shop under
a franchise agreement. You pay a royalty of 6 percent
of your sales revenue to the parent company. Your
profit-maximizing quantity is 10,000 donuts per year,
and at this quantity your price is $1.00 and your aver-
age cost per donut (including all the opportunity cost
of production but not the 6 percent royalty) is $0.44.
(Related to Application 2 on page 565.)
a. Draw a graph with revenue and costs curves to
show your profit-maximizing choice.
b. What is the maximum amount you are willing to
pay per year for the franchise?
2.6
How Many Book Stores? The city of Bookburg ini-
tially allows only one book store, which sells books at a
price of $20 and an average cost of $11. Suppose the
city eliminates its restrictions on book stores, allowing
additional stores to enter the market. According to an
expert in the music market, Each additional music
store will decrease the price of books by $2 per book
and increase the average cost of selling books by $1 per
book.  Predict the equilibrium number of book stores.
2.7
Lawn-Cutting Equilibrium. Consider the market
for cutting lawns. Each firm has a fixed daily cost
of $18 for equipment, and the marginal cost of cut-
ting a lawn is $4. Suppose each firm can cut up to
26.2
three lawns per day. The market demand curve for
lawn cuts is linear, with a vertical intercept of
$70 and a slope of $1 per lawn.
a. If each firm in the market cuts three lawns, what is
the average cost per lawn?
b. What is the equilibrium price under monopolistic
competition?
c. How many lawns will be cut in total, and how many
firms will be in the market?
2.8
Zero Price for a Permit. Consider a city that initially
issues five licenses to pet groomers and does not allow
the licenses to be bought and sold. Shortly after an
economist joins the city licensing authority, the city
decides to allow the licenses to be bought and sold on
the open market. Much to the surprise of the licensers,
the price of the licenses was zero: No one was willing
to pay a positive amount for a pet grooming license.
a. Explain why the price of grooming licenses was zero.
b. Illustrate your answer with a complete graph.

Fixed Costs and Entry
Here is an experiment that shows the implications of entry
for prices and profits. Students play the role of entrepre-
neurs who must decide whether to enter the market for lawn
cutting. If they decide to enter the market, they must then
decide how much to charge for cutting lawns.
There are eight potential lawn-cutting firms, each repre-
sented by one to three students. The firms have two sorts
of costs: a fixed cost per day and a marginal cost of cutting
each lawn. Each firm can cut up to two lawns per day.
There are 16 potential consumers. Each potential con-
sumer is willing to pay a different amount to have his or
her lawn cut.
The experiment has two stages. In the first stage, each
potential firm decides whether to enter the market. The
entry decision is sequential: The instructor will go down
the list of potential firms, one at a time, and give each
firm the option of entering the market. The entry deci-
sions are public knowledge. When a firm enters the mar-
ket, it incurs a fixed cost of $14.
Each firm in the market posts a price for lawn cutting,
and consumers shop around and decide whether to pur-
chase lawn care at the posted prices.
Each trading period lasts several minutes, and each firm
can change its posted price up to three times each period.
A consumers score in a trading period equals the differ-
ence between the amount that the consumer is willing to
pay for lawn care and the price actually paid.
A firms score equals its profit, which is its total revenue
minus its total cost (the fixed cost of $14 plus the variable
cost, equal to $3 per lawn times the number of lawns cut).

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and Museum staged its
2010 induction ceremony in New York City. Four people
who traveled long distances to the induction ceremony
met in a coffeehouse to talk about the artists to be
inducted
ABBA, Genesis, Jimmy Cliff, the Hollies, and
the Stooges. Then they talked about the prices of their air-
line tickets. Although they all traveled about the same dis-
tance to New York, they paid very different prices for their
airline tickets.
Katrina was puzzled: Brian lives in a city that s served
by a single airline, and so do I. But Brian paid $200 and
I paid $400.
Jason was puzzled too: Melissa lives in a city that s
served by two airlines, and so do I. But Melissa paid
$300 and I paid $400.
In this chapter, we explain these puzzling differences in
prices. The monopolist in Brian s city could be charging a
low price to discourage other firms from entering the mar-
ket. The two airlines in Jasons city could have a price-fixing
scheme under which they do not compete with one another,
but instead conspire to charge the same high price.

T
his is the fourth chapter on decision making by firms. In this chapter, we look
at an oligopoly, a market with just a few firms. Given the small number of
firms in an oligopoly, the actions of one firm have a large effect on the other
firms. Therefore, firms in an oligopoly act strategically. Before a firm takes a particu-
lar action, it considers the possible reactions of its rivals. For example, before
Southwest Airlines cuts its fares in an attempt to sell more tickets, it will consider the
possible reactions by other airlines. If the rivals maintain their old fares, Southwest s
fare cut will increase its sales and profit. But if the rivals match the lower fare,
Southwest is likely to gain only a few customers, and its profit may actually decrease.
Game theory is the study of decision making in strategic situations. We can apply
the theory to the game of chess as well as the decisions of oligopolists. A chess player
develops a strategy to win the game, anticipating his or her opponent s reaction to
each of his or her moves. Similarly, an oligopolist develops a strategy to maximize
profit, anticipating the reactions of rival firms. We ll use game theory to discuss three
business strategies: conspiring to fix prices, preventing another firm from entering the
market, and advertising.
WHAT IS AN OLIGOPOLY?
In an oligopoly, a few firms have market power
the power to control prices.
Economists use concentration ratios to measure the degree of concentration in a
market, computed as the percentage of the market output produced by the largest
firms. For example, a four-firm concentration ratio is the percentage of total output in
a market produced by the four largest firms. In Table 27.1, the four-firm concentra-
tion ratio for house slippers is 97 percent, indicating that the largest four firms pro-
duce 97 percent of house slippers in the United States.
An alternative measure of market concentration is the Herfindahl-Hirschman Index
(HHI). It is calculated by squaring the market share of each firm in the market and
then summing the resulting numbers. For example, consider a market with two firms,
one with a 60 percent market share and a second with a 40 percent share. The HHI
for the market is 5,200:
HHI = 602 + 402 = 3,600 + 1,600 = 5,200

CHAPTER 27
OLIGOPOLY AND STRATEGIC BEHAVIOR
576
In contrast, for a market with 10 firms, each with a 10 percent market share, the HHI
is 1,000:
According to the guidelines established by the U.S. Department of Justice in 1992, a
market is unconcentrated  if the HHI is below 1,000 and highly concentrated  if it
is above 1,800. For example, a market with five firms, each with a 20 percent market
share, has an HHI of 2,000 and would be considered highly concentrated:
An oligopoly
a market with just a few firms
occurs for three reasons:
1 Government barriers to entry.
As we saw in Chapters 21 and 25, the government
may limit the number of firms in a market by issuing patents or controlling the
number of business licenses.
2 Economies of scale in production.
As we saw in Chapter 25, a natural monopoly
occurs when there are relatively large economies of scale in production, so a sin-
gle firm produces for the entire market. In some cases, scale economies are not
large enough to generate a natural monopoly, but are large enough to generate a
natural oligopoly, with a few firms serving the entire market.
3 Advertising campaigns.
In some markets, a firm cannot enter a market without a
substantial investment in an advertising campaign. For example, the breakfast-
cereal oligopoly results from the huge advertising campaigns required to get a
foothold in the market. As in the case of economies of scale in production, just a
few firms will enter the market.
CARTEL PRICING AND THE DUOPOLISTS DILEMMA
One of the virtues of a market economy is that firms compete with one another for
customers, and this leads to lower prices and larger quantities. But in some markets,
firms cooperate instead of competing with one another. Eighteenth-century econo-
mist Adam Smith recognized the possibility that firms would conspire to raise prices:
People of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment and diversion,
but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the public, or in some contrivance to
raise prices. 1 We ll see that raising prices is not simply a matter of firms getting
together and agreeing on higher prices. An agreement to raise prices is likely to break
down unless the firms find some way to punish a firm that violates the agreement.
We ll use a market with two firms
a duopoly
to explain the key features of an
oligopoly. The basic insights from a duopoly apply to oligopolies with more than two
firms. Consider a duopoly in the market for air travel between two hypothetical cities.
The two airlines can use prices to compete for customers, or they can cooperate and
conspire to raise prices. To simplify matters
and to keep the numbers manageable
lets assume that the average cost of providing air travel is constant at $100 per passen-
ger. As shown in Figure 27.1, the average cost is constant, which means that marginal
cost equals average cost.
A cartel is a group of firms that act in unison, coordinating their price and quan-
tity decisions. In our airline example, the two airlines could form a cartel and choose
the monopoly price. In Figure 27.1, the firm-specific demand curve for a monopolist
is the market-demand curve, and the marginal-revenue curve intersects the marginal-
cost curve at a quantity of 60 passengers per day (point a). If the two airlines act as one,
they will pick the monopoly price of $400 and split the monopoly output, so each will
have 30 passengers per day. The average cost per passenger is $100, so each airline
earns a daily profit of $9,000:
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity per firm = ($400 - $100) * 30 = $9,000
27.2
HHI = 202 * 5 = 400 * 5 = 2,000
HHI = 102 * 10 = 100 * 10 = 1,000

577
PART 9
This is an example of price fixing, an arrangement in which firms conspire to fix
prices. As we ll see later in the chapter, cartels and price fixing are illegal under U.S.
antitrust laws.
What would happen if the two firms competed rather than conspired to fix the
price? If they competed, each firm would have its own demand curve. As we saw in the
previous chapter, the firm-specific demand curve for the typical firm lies to the left of
the market demand curve because consumers can choose from two firms. At a particu-
lar price, consumers will be divided between the two firms, so each firm will serve only
part of the market. In Figure 27.2, the demand curve for the typical duopolist is below
the market demand curve. For example, at a price of $300, point d shows that the mar-
ket quantity is 80 passengers, while point b shows that each firm has 40 passengers.
Panel A in Figure 27.2 shows the quantity and price choice of an individual firm.

the firms form a cartel, the price is $400

the monopoly quantity). The profit per
passenger is $300 (equal to the $400
price minus the $100 average cost), so
the profit per firm is $9,000.

is satisfied at point a, where marginal revenue equals marginal cost. The firm has 40 pas-
sengers at a price of $300 (point b). The two firms are identical, so each has 40 passengers
at a price of $300. Given an average cost of $100, each firm earns a profit of $8,000:
Price Fixing and the Game Tree
Clearly, each firm will earn more profit under a price-fixing cartel, but will a cartel
succeed, or will firms cheat on a cartel agreement? We can answer this question with
the help of a game tree, a graphical representation of the consequences of different
actions in a strategic setting. Each firm must choose a price for airline tickets, either
the high price (the $400 cartel price) or the low price (the duopoly price of $300).
Each firm can use the game tree to pick a price, knowing that the other firm is picking
a price too.
Figure 27.3 shows the game tree for the price-fixing game. Lets call the managers
of the airlines Jack and Jill. The game tree has three components:
The squares are decision nodes. Each square has a player ( Jack or Jill) and a list
of the players possible actions. For example, the game starts at square A, where
Jill has two options: high price or low price.
The arrows show the possible paths of the game from left to right. Jill chooses
her price first, so we move from square A to one of Jacks decision nodes, either
square B or square C. If Jill chooses the high price, we move from square A to
square B. Once we reach one of Jacks decision nodes, he chooses a price
high
or low
and then we move to one of the rectangles. For example, if Jack
chooses the high price too, we move from square B to rectangle 1.
The rectangles show the profits for the two firms. When we reach a rectangle,
the game is over, and the players receive the profits shown in the rectangle.
There is a profit rectangle for each of the four possible outcomes of the price-
fixing game.
We ve already computed the profits for two payoff rectangles. Rectangle 1 shows
what happens when each firm chooses the high price. This is the cartel or price-fixing
outcome, with each firm earning $9,000. Rectangle 4 shows what happens when each
firm chooses the low price. This is the duopoly outcome, when firms compete and
each firm earns a profit of $8,000.
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity per firm = ($300 - $100) * 40 = $8,000

Price-Fixing Game
The equilibrium path of the game is
square A to square C to rectangle 4:
Each firm picks the low price and earns
a profit of $8,000. The duopolists
dilemma is that each firm would make
more profit if both picked the high
price, but both firms pick the low price.

PART 9
What would happen if the two firms chose different prices? If Jill chooses the
high price and Jack chooses the low price, Jack will capture a large share of the market
and gain at Jill s expense. In the first column of Table 27.2, Jill charges the high price
and has only 10 passengers at a price of $400, so her profit is $3,000:
In the second column, Jack charges the low price and has 60 passengers at a price of
$300, so his profit is $12,000:
This is shown by rectangle 2 in Figure 27.3: The path of the game is square A to
square B to rectangle 2. The other underpricing outcome is shown by rectangle 3. In
this case, Jill chooses the low price and Jack chooses the high price, so Jill gains at
Jacks expense. The roles are reversed, and so are the numbers in the profit rectangle.
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity per firm = ($300 - $100) * 60 = $12,000
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity per firm = ($400 - $100) * 10 = $3,000

Equilibrium of the Price-Fixing Game
We can predict the equilibrium of the price-fixing game by a process of elimination.
We ll eliminate the rectangles that would require one or both firms to act irrationally,
leaving us with the rectangle showing the equilibrium of the game:
If Jill chooses the high price, we ll move along the upper branches of the tree
and eventually reach rectangle 1 or 2, depending on what Jack does. Although
Jill would like Jack to choose the high price too, this would be irrational for
Jack. He can earn $12,000 profit by choosing the low price, compared to $9,000
with the high price. Therefore, we can eliminate rectangle 1.
If Jill chooses the low price, we ll move along the lower branches of the tree and
eventually reach rectangle 3 or 4, depending on Jacks choice. Jack won t choose
the high price because he can earn $8,000 with the low price, compared to
$3,000 with the high price. Therefore, we can eliminate rectangle 3.
We ve eliminated the two profit rectangles that represent a high price for Jack
rectangles 1 and 3. For Jack, the low price is a dominant strategy: Regardless of
what Jill does, Jack s best choice is the low price.
Two profit rectangles are left
2 and 4
and Jill s action will determine which
rectangle is the equilibrium. Jill knows Jack will choose the low price regardless of
what she does. She could choose the high price and allow Jack to capture most of
the market, leaving her with a profit of only $3,000 in rectangle 2. A better choice
is to pick the low price and get a profit of $8,000 in rectangle 4. In other words, it
would be irrational for Jill to allow herself to be underpriced, so the outcome of
the game is shown by profit rectangle 4: Each player chooses the low price. The
thick arrows show the equilibrium path of the game, from square A to square C to
rectangle 4.
Both firms will be unhappy with this equilibrium because each could earn a
higher profit with rectangle 1. To get there, however, each firm must choose the high
price. The duopolists  dilemma is that although both firms would be better off if
they both chose the high price, each firm chooses the low price. The dilemma occurs

because there is a big payoff from underpricing the other firm and a big penalty from
being underpriced, so both firms pick the low price. As we ll see later in the chapter, to
avoid the dilemma, the firms must find some way to prevent underpricing.
Nash Equilibrium
We have used a game tree to find the equilibrium in a price-fixing game. It is an equi-
librium in the sense that each player (firm) is doing the best he or she can, given the
actions of another player. The label for such an equilibrium is Nash equilibrium.
This concept is named after John Nash, the recipient of the 1994 Nobel Prize in eco-
nomics, who developed his equilibrium concept as a 21-year-old graduate student at
Princeton University. Nash s life story, which includes a 25-year bout with schizo-
phrenia and a dramatic recovery, is chronicled in the book A Beautiful Mind, later
made into a movie starring Russell Crowe as Nash.2
In the Nash equilibrium for the price-fixing game, both firms pick the low price.
Each firm is doing the best it can, given the action of the other firm:
If Jill picks the low price, Jacks best action is to pick the low price.
If Jack picks the low price, Jills best action is to pick the low price.
What about the other potential outcomes? Consider first the possibility that both
firms pick the high price. This is not a Nash equilibrium because neither firm is doing
the best it can, given the action of the other firm:
If Jill picks the high price, Jack s best action is to pick the low price.
If Jack picks the high price, Jills best action is to pick the low price.
Consider next the possibility that Jill picks the low price and Jack picks the high price.
This is not a Nash equilibrium because Jack is not doing the best he can, given Jills choice:
If Jill picks the low price, Jacks best action is to pick the low price.
The concept of the Nash equilibrium has been applied to a wide variety of decisions.
Analysts have used it to study the nuclear arms race, terrorism, evolutionary biology,
art auctions, environmental policy, and urban development. Later in the chapter, we
will use it to predict the outcomes of games of entry deterrence and advertising.
OVERCOMING THE DUOPOLISTS  DILEMMA
The duopolists  dilemma occurs because the two firms are unable to coordinate their
pricing decisions and act as one. Each firm has an incentive to underprice the other
because the low-price firm will capture a larger share of the market and earn a larger
profit. Firms can avoid the dilemma in two ways: low-price guarantees and repetition
of the pricing game, with retaliation for underpricing.
Low-Price Guarantees
The duopolists  dilemma occurs because the payoff from underpricing the other firm
is too lucrative to miss. To eliminate the possibility of underpricing, one firm can
guarantee it will match a lower price of a competitor. Suppose Jill places the following
advertisement in the local newspaper:
If you buy an airline ticket from me and then discover that Jack offers the same trip at a
lower price, I will pay you the price difference. If I charge you $400 and Jack s price is only
$300, I will pay you $100.
Jill s low-price guarantee is a credible promise because she announces it in
the newspaper.

PART 9
Suppose Jack makes a similar commitment to match a lower price from Jill.
Figure 27.4 shows the effect of low-price guarantees on the game tree. Jill now has
two decision nodes. As before, she starts the game in square A. If Jill picks the high
price and then Jack picks the high price, we end up at rectangle 1, as before. But if Jill
picks the high price and Jack picks the low price, we get to square D. Jill will issue a
refund of $100 to each of her consumers. In effect, she has retroactively chosen the
low price, and payoff rectangle 2 is the duopoly outcome, with both firms picking the
low price. For the lower half of the game tree, recall that Jack has committed to match
a lower price by Jill, so the old payoff rectangle 3 disappears, leaving us with rectangle 4,
where both firms choose the low price and get the duopoly profit.
The thick arrows show the path of the game with low-price guarantees. Consider
Jacks decision first:
If Jill picks the high price, Jack chooses between payoff rectangles 1 and 2, a pair
of high prices or a pair of low prices. His profit is higher at $9,000 with a pair of
high prices (rectangle 1), so if Jill picks the high price, he will too.
If Jill picks the low price, Jack is committed to the low price too.
Consider Jill s decision. She knows Jack will match her price
either high or
low
meaning she chooses between profit rectangles 1 and 4. Profit is higher with
rectangle 1, so she will pick the high price.
The low-price guarantee eliminates the possibility of underpricing, so it elimi-
nates the duopolists  dilemma and promotes cartel pricing. The firms don t have to
create a formal cartel to get the benefits from cartel pricing. The motto of a low-price
guarantee is Low for one means low for all,  so both firms charge the high price.
Once the possibility of underpricing has been eliminated, the duopoly will be replaced
by an informal cartel, with each firm picking the price that a monopolist would pick.
To most people, the notion that a low-price guarantee leads to higher prices is
surprising. After all, if Jill promises to give refunds if her price exceeds Jack s price, we
might expect Jill to keep her price low to avoid handing out a lot of refunds. In fact,

Low-Price Guarantees Increase Prices
When both firms have a low-price guarantee, it is impossible for one firm to underprice the other.
The only possible outcomes are a pair of high prices (rectangle 1) or a pair of low prices (rectangles 2
or 4). The equilibrium path of the game is square A to square B to rectangle 1. Each firm picks the
high price and earns a profit of $9,000.

Jill doesn t have to worry about giving refunds because Jack will also choose the high
price. In other words, the promise to issue refunds is an empty promise. Although con-
sumers might think that a low-price guarantee will protect them from high prices, it
means they are more likely to pay the high price.
Repeated Pricing Games with Retaliation for Underpricing
Up to this point, we ve assumed the price-fixing game is played only once. Each firm
chooses a price and keeps it for the lifetime of the firm. What happens when two firms
play the game repeatedly, picking prices over an extended period of time? We ll see
that repetition makes price fixing more likely because firms can punish a firm that
cheats on a price-fixing agreement, whether its formal or informal.
1 A duopoly pricing strategy.
Jill chooses the lower duopoly price for the remaining
lifetime of her firm. Once Jill is underpriced, she abandons the idea of cartel pric-
ing and accepts the duopoly outcome, which is less profitable than the cartel out-
come but more profitable than being underpriced by the other firm.
2 A grim-trigger strategy.
When Jack underprices Jill, she responds by dropping
her price to a level at which each firm will make zero economic profit. This is
called the grim-trigger strategy because grim consequences are triggered by
Jack s underpricing.
3 A tit-for-tat strategy.
Starting in the second month, Jill chooses whatever price
Jack chose the preceding month. This is the tit-for-tat strategy
one firm
chooses whatever price the other firm chose in the preceding period. As long as
Jack chooses the cartel price, the cartel arrangement will persist. But if Jack
underprices Jill, the cartel will break down.
Figure 27.5 shows how a tit-for-tat system works. Jack underprices Jill in the sec-
ond month, so Jill chooses the low price for the third month, resulting in the duopoly
outcome. To restore the cartel outcome, Jack must eventually choose the high price,
allowing Jill to underprice him for one month. This happens in the fourth month, and
the cartel is restored in the fifth month. Although Jack can gain at Jills expense in the
second month, if he wants to restore cartel pricing, he must allow her to gain at his
expense during some other month. Under a tit-for-tat strategy, a duopolist does
exactly what his or her rival did the last round. This encourages firms to cooperate
rather than compete. Several studies have shown that a tit-for-tat strategy is the most
effective strategy to promote cooperation.3

PART 9
These three pricing schemes promote cartel pricing by penalizing the firm that
underprices the other firm. To decide whether to underprice Jill, Jack must weigh the
short-term benefit against the long-term cost:
The short-term benefit is the increase in profit in the current period. If Jack
underprices Jill, he can increase his profit from the cartel profit of $9,000 to the
$12,000 earned by a firm that underprices the other firm. Therefore, the short-
term benefit of underpricing is $3,000.
The long-term cost is the loss of profit in later periods. Jill will respond to Jacks
underpricing by cutting her price, and this decreases Jacks profit. For example,
if Jill retaliates with the duopoly price, Jack s future profit will be $8,000 per day
instead of the $9,000 he could have earned by going along with the cartel price.
The cost of underpricing is the daily loss of $1,000 in profit.
If the two firms expect to share the market for a long time, the long-term cost of
underpricing will exceed the short-term benefit, so underpricing is less likely. The
threat of punishment makes it easier to resist the temptation to cheat on the cartel.
Price Fixing and the Law
Under the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890 and subsequent legislation, explicit price
fixing is illegal. It is illegal for firms to discuss pricing strategies or methods of punish-
ing a firm that underprices other firms. In one of the early price-fixing cases (Addyston
Pipe, 1899), six manufacturers of cast-iron pipe met to fix prices. Several months after
the Supreme Court ruled that their cartel pricing was illegal, the firms merged into a
single firm, so instead of acting like a monopolist, they became a monopolist. Here are
some other examples of price fixing:
1 Electric generators (1961).
Executives from General Electric and Westinghouse
were convicted of fixing prices for electrical generators, resulting in fines of over
$2 million and imprisonment or probation for 30 corporate executives.
A P P L I C AT I O N  1
MARINE HOSE CONSPIRATORS GO TO PRISON
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How do firms conspire to fix prices?
In 2007, the U.S. government discovered a seven-year conspiracy to fix the price of
marine hose, which is used to transfer oil from tankers to onshore storage facilities.
The case ultimately led to fines and prison sentences for the employees of several
marine-hose firms and for a person paid by the firms to coordinate the price-fixing
scheme. The executives were arrested after a meeting in Houston in which they allo-
cated customers to different members of the cartel and fixed prices. Each firm in the
cartel agreed to submit artificially high bids for customers allocated to other firms, a
practice known as bid rigging.
The prison sentences ranged from one to two years. There is some evidence that
prison sentences are more effective than fines in deterring business crimes such as
price fixing. In England, for instance, a survey of executives suggests the most feared
punishment is prison time. In the United States, people convicted of price fixing reg-
ularly offer to pay bigger fines to avoid prison.

In exchange for advertising subsidies, music retailers

tors. Any retailer that advertised a CD for less than the MAP would lose all of its

Trade Commission reached an agreement with music distributors to end the
MAP scheme. The FTC estimated that the MAP scheme imposed an annual cost
of $160 million on U.S. music consumers.4

ALTERNATIVE MODELS OF OLIGOPOLY PRICING
We ve explored a model of cartel pricing, an arrangement under which firms conspire
to fix prices at the monopoly level. In this part of the chapter, we consider two alterna-
tive models of oligopoly pricing: a model of price leadership and the model of the
kinked demand curve.
Price Leadership
Because explicit price fixing is illegal, firms sometimes rely on implicit pricing agree-
ments to fix prices at the monopoly level. Under the model of price leadership, one
of the oligopolists plays the role of price leader. The leading firm picks a price, and
other firms match the price. Such an agreement allows firms to cooperate without
actually discussing their pricing strategies.
The problem with an implicit pricing agreement is that it relies on indirect signals
that are often garbled and misinterpreted. Suppose two firms have cooperated for sev-
eral years, both sticking to the cartel price. When one firm suddenly drops its price,
the other firm could interpret the price cut in one of two ways:
A change in market conditions. Perhaps the first firm observed a change in
demand or production cost and decides that both firms would benefit from a
lower price.
Underpricing. Perhaps the first firm is trying to increase its market share and
profit at the expense of the second firm.
The first interpretation would probably cause the second firm to match the lower price
of the first firm, and price fixing would continue at the lower price. In contrast, the sec-
ond interpretation could trigger a price war, undermining the price-fixing agreement.
The Kinked Demand Curve Model
The kinked demand curve model of oligopoly gets its name from its assumptions
about how firms in an oligopoly respond when one firm changes its price. The model
assumes that when one firm cuts its price, the other firms will match the price cut. But
if one firm raises its price, other firms don t match the price hike.
The firm-specific demand curve in Figure 27.6 incorporates the assumptions of the
kinked demand curve model. The demand curve shows the demand facing Kirk, one of

PART 9
three firms in the oligopoly. Suppose each of the three firms starts out with a price of $6,
and Kirk sells 30 units of output (point k). What happens if Kirk changes his price?
If Kirk decreases his price, the other firms will decrease their prices too. Kirk
will have the same price as the other firms, so his quantity will increase by a rel-
atively small amount
from 30 to 33 units.
If Kirk increases his price, the other firms will not change their prices. Kirk will
have a higher price than the other firms, so his quantity will decrease by a rela-
tively large amount
from 30 to 10 units.
In this model, the demand curve of the typical firm has a kink at the prevailing
price. It is relatively flat for higher prices because other firms won t match a higher
price. It is relatively steep for lower prices because other firms will match a lower price.
Once a price has been established, it will tend to persist. The benefit of cutting the
price is relatively small because the other firms will match a lower price. Moving in the
other direction, the penalty for an increase in price is relatively large because the other
firms won t match a higher price.
The model of kinked demand is a model of pessimism. Each firm assumes the
worst about how its fellow oligopolists will respond to a change in price: The other
firms will not go along with a higher price, but will match a lower price. Although this
model may have some intuitive appeal, there is no evidence that firms act this way.
Starting in 1947, various studies of oligopolies have failed to find compelling evidence
to support the kinked demand model of oligopoly.5
SIMULTANEOUS DECISION MAKING AND
THE PAYOFF MATRIX
So far we have considered a game with sequential decisions. Jill chooses her price first,
and then Jack observes her choice and then makes his own. An alternative scenario is
that the two firms make their decisions simultaneously, so each firm picks its price
without knowing the other firms price. The analysis of a simultaneous game requires
a different tool. A payoff matrix shows, for each possible outcome of a game, the
consequences
or payoffs
for each player.

match the price hike, the quantity sold by the firm will decrease by a relatively large amount.

CHAPTER 27
OLIGOPOLY AND STRATEGIC BEHAVIOR
586
Simultaneous Price-Fixing Game
Figure 27.7 shows the payoff matrix for the price-fixing game. Each cell in the matrix
shows the payoffs from a potential outcome of the game. In the northwest corner of
the matrix, if both firms pick the high price, each firm earns a profit of $9,000. In the
southeast corner, if both firms pick the low price, each firm earns a profit of $8,000. If
one firm picks the low price and the other picks the high price, the low-price firm
earns $12,000 and the high-price firm earns only $3,000. For example, in the north-
east corner, if Jill picks the high price and Jack picks the low price, Jill earns a profit of
$3,000 and Jack earns a profit of $12,000.
We can use the payoff matrix to predict the equilibrium of the price-fixing game.
In a simultaneous-decision game, Jack doesn t know whether Jill will pick the low
price or the high price. There are two possibilities:
If Jill picks the high price, we will be in the upper half of the matrix, and Jack s
best response is the low price. In the northeast corner of the matrix, he can earn
$12,000 by picking the low price. This is better than the $9,000 he can earn by
picking the high price in the northwest corner.
If Jill picks the low price, we will be in the lower half of the matrix, and Jacks
best response is the low price. In the southeast corner of the matrix, he can earn
$8,000 by picking the low price. This is better than the $3,000 he can earn by
picking the high price in the southwest corner.
In other words, the low price is the dominant strategy for Jack. Jill knows this, so she
realizes that the equilibrium will be in the eastern half of the matrix. Her best
response is the low price. In the southeast corner of the matrix, she can earn $8,000 by
picking the low price. This is better than the $3,000 she can earn in the northeast cor-
ner by picking the high price. Therefore, the equilibrium is the same as with the
game-tree approach: Both firms pick the low price.
The Prisoners  Dilemma
We can gain some insight into the duopolists  dilemma by examining the classic pris-
oners  dilemma. Consider two people, Bonnie and Clyde, who have been accused of
committing a crime. The police give each person an opportunity to confess to the
crime. The traditional version of the story is a simultaneous decision-making game:
The two are put in separate rooms, and each makes a choice without knowing the
other s choice.
The police confront Bonnie and Clyde with the payoff matrix in Figure 27.8. If
both confess, each gets 5 years in prison, as shown in the southeast corner of the matrix.
If neither confesses, the police can convict both of them on a lesser charge, and each
gets 2 years, as shown in the northwest corner of the matrix. If only one confesses, he
or she will implicate the other prisoner. The confessor is rewarded with a 1-year prison

sentence, while the other prisoner gets 10 years. If Bonnie confesses and Clyde does
not, we are in the southwest corner of the matrix. If the roles are reversed, we are in the
northeast corner.
We can use the payoff matrix to predict the equilibrium of the prisoner game. In a
simultaneous-decision game, Clyde doesn t know whether Bonnie will confess or not:
If Bonnie does not confess, we are in the upper half of the matrix, and Clydes
best response is to confess. In the northeast corner of the matrix, he gets one
year in prison if he confesses. This is better than the two years he would get in
the northwest corner by not confessing.
If Bonnie confesses, we are in the lower half of the matrix, and Clyde s best
response is to confess. In the southeast corner of the matrix, he gets 5 years in
prison. This is better than the 10 years he would get in the southwest corner by
not confessing.
In other words, confessing is the dominant strategy for Clyde. Bonnie knows this, so
she realizes that the equilibrium will be in the eastern half of the matrix. Her best
response is to confess. In the southeast corner of the matrix, she gets 5 years in prison.
This is better than the 10 years she would get in the northeast by not confessing.
If both prisoners confess and each gets 5 years in prison, we have a Nash equilib-
rium because each prisoner is doing the best he or she can, given the actions of the
other prisoner. Although both would be better off if they both kept quiet, they impli-
cate each other because the police reward them for doing so. There is an incentive for
squealing, just as there is an incentive for one duopolist to underprice the other.

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: When does cooperation break down?
An economics professor discovered three students cheating on the final exam.
Speaking to the students individually in his office, he gave each student two options:
1 If the student confessed, he or she would receive a zero on the final exam, but suf-
fer no other consequences.
2 If the student did not confess, he or she would go before the Office of Student
Judicial Affairs, and any confessions by the other two students would be used
as evidence.
During the sessions in the professors office, one of the accused said, This feels like

We ve seen what happens when two duopolists try to act as one, fixing the price at the
monopoly level. Consider next how a monopolist might try to prevent a second firm
from entering its market. We will use some of the numbers from our airline example,
although we will look at a different city with a different cast of characters.
Suppose Mona initially has a secure monopoly in the market for air travel between
two cities. When there is no threat of entry, Mona uses the marginal principle (mar-
ginal revenue equals marginal cost) to pick a quantity and a price. In Figure 27.9, we
start at point c on the market demand curve, with a quantity of 60 passengers per day
and a price of $400 per passenger. Her profit is $18,000:
If Mona discovers that a second airline is thinking about entering the market, what
will she do? Now that her monopoly is insecure, she has two options: She can be pas-
sive and allow the second airline to enter the market, or she can try to prevent the
other firm from entering the market.
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity per firm = ($400 - $100) * 60 = $18,000

Point c shows a secure monopoly, point d shows a duopoly, and point z shows the zero-profit out-
come. The minimum entry quantity is 20 passengers, so the entry-deterring quantity is 100 (equal to
120  20), as shown by point e. The limit price is $200.
The Passive Approach
The passive approach will lead to the duopoly outcome we saw earlier in the chapter.
In Figure 27.9, if the second firm enters the market, we move downward along the
market demand curve from point c to point d. In a duopoly, each firm charges a price
of $300 and serves 40 passengers, half the total quantity demanded at a price of $300.
For each duopolist, the daily profit is $8,000:
profit = (price - average cost) * quantity per firm = ($300 - $100) * 40 = $8,000

PART 9
Entry Deterrence and Limit Pricing
The second option is to take actions to prevent the second firm from entering the
market. To decide whether to deter the entry of the other firm, Mona must answer
two questions:
What must she do to deter entry?
Given what she must do to deter entry, is deterrence more profitable than being
passive and sharing the market with the second firm?
To prevent the second firm from entering the market, Mona must commit herself
to serving a large number of passengers. If she commits to a large passenger load,
there won t be enough passengers left for a potential entrant to make a profit. Suppose
there are economies of scale in providing air travel, and the minimum entry quantity
is 20 passengers per day: That is, it would be impractical for a firm to serve fewer than
20 passengers. In Figure 27.9, the long-run average cost curve is negatively sloped for
relatively low levels of output, and the average cost for the minimum entry quantity of
20 passengers is just over $100, say $101.
Mona must compute the quantity of output that is just large enough to prevent
the second firm from entering the market. In Figure 27.9, point z shows the point of
zero economic profit in the market: If the two firms serve a total of 120 passengers per
day and split the market equally, with 60 passengers each, the price ($100) equals aver-
age cost, so each firm would earn zero economic profit. The quantity required to pre-
vent the entry of the second firm is computed as follows:
If Mona commits to serve 100 passengers and a second firm were to enter with the
minimum quantity of 20 passengers, the price would drop to $100. Mona, with an
average cost of $100 to serve 100 passengers, would break even. The second firm,
with an average cost just above $100, would lose money. Specifically, if the average
cost of 20 passengers is $101, the second firm would lose $1 per passenger, or $20
in total.
Note that Mona cannot simply announce that she will serve 100 passengers. She
must take actions that ensure that her most profitable output is in fact 100 passengers.
In other words, she must commit to 100 passengers. She could commit to the larger
passenger load by purchasing a large fleet of airplanes and signing labor contracts that
require her to hire a large workforce.
Which is more profitable, entry deterrence or the passive duopoly outcome? The
deterrence strategy, shown by point e in Figure 27.9, generates a price of $200 and a
profit of $10,000:
This is larger than the $8,000 profit under the passive approach, so deterrence is the
best strategy.
Figure 27.10 uses a game tree to represent the entry-deterrence game. Mona
makes the first move, and she considers the consequences of her two options:
If Mona is passive and commits to serve only 40 passengers, we reach the upper
branch of the game tree. The best response for Doug, the manager of the sec-
ond firm, is to enter to earn a profit of $8,000, as shown by rectangle 1.
If Mona commits to serve 100 passengers, we reach the lower branch of the
game tree. If Doug enters with the minimum entry quantity of 20 passengers,
his average cost will be $101, which exceeds the market price of $100.
Therefore, the best response is to stay out of the market and avoid losing money.
 = $10,000
 profit = (price - average cost) * quantity per firm = ($200 - $100) * 100
100 = 120 - 20
deterring quantity = zero profit quantity - minimum entry quantity

CHAPTER 27
OLIGOPOLY AND STRATEGIC BEHAVIOR
590
Mona can choose between rectangles 1 and 4. Monas profit is higher in rectangle 4, so
that s the equilibrium. The equilibrium path of the game is square A to square C to
rectangle 4.
Monas entry-deterrence strategy generates a market price of $200, which is less
than the $400 price charged by a secure monopolist and less than the $300 price with
two competing firms. Mona can keep the second firm out of the market, but only by
producing a large quantity and charging a relatively low price. This is known as limit
pricing: To prevent a firm from entering the market, the firm reduces its price. The
price that is just low enough to prevent entry is known as the limit price.
Examples: Microsoft Windows, Aluminum, and Campus
Bookstores
For an example of limit pricing, consider the pricing of the Windows operating sys-
tem by Microsoft. Windows runs about 90 percent of the worlds personal computers,
so it is natural to think Microsoft has a monopoly in the market for operating systems.
According to economist Richard Schmalensee, Microsofts profit-maximizing monop-
oly price is between $900 and $2,000. Thats the amount Microsoft would charge if it
acted like a secure monopolist.6 The fact that Microsoft charges only $99 for
Windows suggests it is an insecure monopolist, and that it picks a lower price to dis-
courage entry and preserve its monopoly. If Microsoft charged $2,000, there would be
a greater incentive for other firms to develop competing operating systems.
For another example of limit pricing, consider the Aluminum Company of
America (Alcoa). Between 1893 and 1940, Alcoa had a monopoly on aluminum pro-
duction in the United States. During this period, Alcoa kept other firms out of the
market by producing a large quantity and keeping its price relatively low. Although a
higher price would have generated more profit in the short run, the entry of other
firms would eventually have reduced Alcoa s profit.
We can apply the notion of entry deterrence to your favorite monopoly: your
campus bookstore. On most college campuses, other organizations are prohibited,
usually by the state government or the college, from selling textbooks on campus.
Internet commerce has given students another option: Order textbooks online and
have them shipped by mail, UPS, FedEx, or Airborne Express. Several online book-
sellers charge less than the campus bookstore, and the growth of Internet book sales
thus threatens the campus bookstore monopoly. If your campus bookstore suddenly

PART 9
feels insecure about its monopoly position, it could cut its prices to prevent online
booksellers from capturing too many of its customers. If it does this, you will pay
lower prices even if you don t patronize the Internet seller.
Entry Deterrence and Contestable Markets
We ve seen that an insecure monopolist may cut its price to prevent a second firm
from entering the market. The same logic applies to a market that has a few firms but
could have many. The mere existence of a monopoly or oligopoly does not necessarily
generate high prices and large profits. To protect its market share, an oligopolist may
act like a firm in a market with many firms, leading to relatively low prices.
The threat of entry faced by an insecure monopolist underlies the theory of mar-
ket contestability. A contestable market is a market with low entry and exit costs.
The few firms in a contestable market will be threatened constantly by the entry of
new firms, so prices and profits will be relatively low. In the extreme case of perfect
contestability, firms can enter and exit a market at zero cost. In this case, the price will
be the same as the price that would occur in a competitive market. Although few mar-
kets are perfectly contestable, many markets are contestable to a certain degree, and
the threat of entry tends to decrease prices and profits.
When Is the Passive Approach Better?
Although our example shows that entry deterrence is the best strategy for Mona, it
won t be the best strategy for all insecure monopolists. The key variable is the mini-
mum entry quantity. Suppose that the scale economies in air travel were relatively
small, so a second firm could enter the market with as few as 10 passengers. In this
case, if Mona commits to serving only 100 passengers, that won t be enough to deter
entry: A firm entering with 10 passengers will still make a profit. If the minimum
entry quantity is 10 passengers, the entry-deterring quantity rises to 110 passengers:
 110 = 120 - 10
 deterring quantity = zero profit quantity - minimum entry quantity

MERCK AND PFIZER GO GENERIC?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: How do patent holders respond to the
introduction of generic drugs?
Between 2006 and 2011, many of the top-selling branded drugs will lose their patent
protection. The producers of generic versions of the branded drugs will enter markets
with hundreds of billions of dollars of annual sales. The producers of branded drugs
are responding to the increased competition in two ways. First, they are launching
their own versions of the generics, in cooperation with other firms. Merck has an
agreement with Dr. Reddys Laboratories, an Indian firm, to produce generic versions
of Zokor. Pfizer will produce a generic version of Zoloft through Greenstone, a sub-
sidiary. The second response to increased competition is to cut the prices of branded
drugs to compete with generics. Anticipating the entry of a generic version of Zokor,
Merck cut its price so aggressively that the company was accused of trying to prevent
the producers of generics from entering the market. Sanofi and BMS, the makers of
the branded drug Plavix, cut their price to undercut the generic version introduced by
Apotex.

CHAPTER 27
OLIGOPOLY AND STRATEGIC BEHAVIOR
592
Mona can commit to serving 110 passengers and thus prevent the second firm
from entering the market, but is this the most profitable strategy? As shown by point f
in Figure 27.9, the limit price associated with an entry-deterring quantity is $150.
Monas profit from entry deterrence would be $5,500:
This is less than the $8,000 profit she could earn by being passive and letting the sec-
ond firm enter the market. In this case, the minimum entry quantity is relatively small,
so the entry-deterring quantity is large and the limit price is low. As a result, sharing a
duopoly is more profitable than increasing output and cutting the price to keep the
other firm out.
For another example of the passive response to market entry, consider the ball-
point pen, introduced in 1945 by Reynolds International Pen Corporation.7 For three
years Reynolds earned enormous profits producing this revolutionary product and
selling it for $12.50, about 16 times the average production cost of $0.80. Then in
1948, Reynolds stopped producing pens, dropping out of the market entirely. Why?
Other producers could easily copy the simple production technology of the ballpoint
pen. The limit price was thus so low that it was better for Reynolds to charge a high
price and squeeze out as much profit as possible from a short-lived monopoly while it
lasted. By 1948, a total of 100 firms had entered the ballpoint market, and the price
had fallen to the average cost of production, so each firm made zero economic profit.
THE ADVERTISERS  DILEMMA
We have explored two sorts of strategic behavior of firms in an oligopoly
price fixing
and entry deterrence. A third type of strategy concerns advertising. As we ll see, firms
in an oligopoly may suffer from an advertisers  dilemma: Although both firms would
be better off if neither spent money on advertising, each firm advertises.
Consider the producers of two brands of aspirin. Each firm must decide whether to
spend $7 million on an advertising campaign for its product. In Table 27.3, the first two
columns show what happens if neither firm advertises. Each firm earns $8 million in net
revenue (revenue minus production cost) and spends no money on advertising, so each
firm earns $8 million in profits. The third and fourth columns show what happens if
each firm spends $7 million on advertising. The net revenue for each firm increases by
only $5 million, so the profit of each firm drops by $2 million, to $6 million.
What happens if one firm advertises and the other does not? As shown in the last
two columns in Table 27.3, a firm can increase its profit by advertising. If Adeline spends
$7 million on advertising and Vern spends nothing, Adelines net revenue increases to
$17 million and her profit increases to $10 million. Adelines advertisements cause some
of Verns consumers to switch to Adeline, and Verns profit drops to $5 million.

We can use the data in Table 27.3 to construct a game tree for the advertising
game. In Figure 27.11, Adeline makes her decision first, followed by Vern:
If neither firm advertises, we go from square A to square C to rectangle 4, and
each firm gets a profit of $8 million.

593
PART 9
If both firms advertise, we go from square A to square B to rectangle 1, and each
firm earns a profit of $6 million.
If Adeline advertises and Vern does not, we go from square A to square B to rec-
tangle 2. Adeline earns $10 million, while Vern earns $5 million. If the roles are
reversed, we end up in rectangle 3, with Vern the advertiser earning $10 million
and Adeline earning only $5 million.
To determine the outcome of this advertising game, let s start with Vern s possi-
ble actions:
If Adeline advertises, we move along the upper branches of the game tree from
square A to square B. Vern will earn $6 million if he advertises (rectangle 1), but
only $5 million if he does not advertise (rectangle 2). Therefore, Vern s best
response is to match Adelines campaign.
If Adeline does not advertise, we move along the lower branches from square A to
square C. Vern will earn $10 million if he advertises, but only $8 million if he does
not. Therefore, if Adeline does not advertise, Verns best response is to advertise.
Advertising is Verns dominant strategy because it is the best response no matter what
Adeline does.
Consider next the options faced by Adeline. She will figure out that advertising is
a dominant strategy for Vern, so she realizes that the only possible outcomes are
shown by rectangles 1 and 3. To get to rectangle 1, she advertises and gets a profit of
$6 million. This is better than not advertising and going to rectangle 3, with a profit
of $5 million. So Adeline s best response is to advertise. The thick arrows show the
equilibrium path of the game, from square A to square B to rectangle 1. In equilib-
rium, both firms advertise and each earns a profit of $6 million.
What is the advertisers  dilemma? Both Adeline and Vern would be better off if
neither advertised. Each would get a profit of $8 million, compared to $6 million
when they both advertise. But each firm has an incentive to use advertising to increase
its sales at the expense of the other. Stuck in the dilemma, each firm earns $2 million
less than it would if neither advertised.
Why does the advertisers  dilemma occur? In general, it happens when advertis-
ing causes a relatively small increase in the total sales of the industry but allows a firm
that advertises to gain at the expense of firms that don t. In our example, a pair of
advertising campaigns costing a total of $14 million increases the net revenue of the

Knowing this, Adeline realizes that the
only possible outcomes are shown by
rectangles 1 and 3. From Adeline s per-
spective, rectangle 1 ($6 million) is bet-
ter than rectangle 3 ($5 million), so her
best response is to advertise. Both
Adeline and Vern advertise, and each

In this chapter, we ve seen that
when a few firms share a market
they have an incentive to act strate-
gically. Firms in an oligopoly try to
use cartel pricing
price fixing
to
avoid competition and keep prices
high. A monopolist may commit to
a large quantity and a low price in
order to prevent a second firm from
entering the market. Oligopolists may use advertising to
increase their sales at the expense of competitors. Here are
the main points of the chapter:
1 Each firm in an oligopoly has an incentive to underprice the
other firms, so price fixing will be unsuccessful unless firms
have some way of enforcing a price-fixing agreement.
entire industry by only $10 million. The increase in revenue is less than the cost of
advertising, so advertising decreases total profit. Nonetheless, each firm has an incen-
tive to advertise to take sales away from the other firm. If the increase in industry-wide
net revenue were larger, advertising could benefit both firms.
A P P L I C AT I O N 4
GOT MILK?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: What is the rationale for generic
advertising?
The Got Milk? advertisement campaign is run by the National Fluid Milk Producers,
an industry group that is funded by a tax of $0.20 per hundredweight of processed
milk. Milk producers pool their resources and run a generic (non-brand) advertising
campaign. Why?
Milk is a standardized good, so advertising by one producer increases demand and
benefits other producers. The Got Milk? campaign increases the demand for milk by
about 6 percent, and the bang per buck (the increase in milk sales per dollar on adver-
tising) is about $5. No single firm has an incentive to incur the cost of an advertising
campaign, because the firm bears all the cost but experiences only a fraction of the
benefits. The result is an advertisers  dilemma: All firms would benefit from an adver-
tising campaign, but no single firm has an incentive to pay for a campaign. The solu-
tion to this advertisers  dilemma is to share the cost of an advertising campaign, along
with the benefits.

2 One way to maintain price fixing is a low-price guarantee:
One firm chooses the high price and promises to match any
lower price of a competitor.
3 Price fixing is more likely to occur if firms choose prices
repeatedly and can punish a firm that chooses a price below
the cartel price.
4 To prevent a second firm from entering the market, an inse-
cure monopolist may commit itself to producing a relatively
large quantity and accepting a relatively low price.
5 The advertisers  dilemma is that both firms would be better
off if neither firm advertised.

Overcoming the Duopolists  Dilemma
3.1
For firms with a low-price guarantee, the promise
of matching a lower price is a(n) 
promise, because all firms will charge the same
price.
27.3
3.2
Suppose that Jack and Jill use a tit-for-tat scheme to
encourage cartel pricing. Jill chooses the low price for
two successive months, and then switches to the high
price. The two firms will deviate from cartel pricing
for a total of 
months.
3.3
If two firms expect to be in the market together for a
long time, the 
(cost/benefit) of under-
pricing will be large relative to the 
(cost/benefit).
3.4
The practice of low-price guarantees could explain

At the beginning of this chapter, we saw that Jason
paid more for his plane ticket than Melissa did for
hers, even though both people live in cities that are

in one city uses a 
guarantee to keep
prices high.

Low-Price Guarantees for a Canopy Tour. Dip
and Zip provide canopy tours in a rain forest. The
average cost per rider is constant at $10. Here are the
possible outcomes:
Price fixing (cartel). Each firm has 6 passengers at a
price of $20.
Duopoly (no price fixing). Each firm has 8 passen-
gers at a price of $15.
Underpricing (one firm charges $20 and the other
charges $15). The low-price firm has 13 passengers
and the high-price firm has 2 passengers.
Dip chooses a price first, followed by Zip.
a. Assume that the firms do not provide low-price
guarantees. Draw a game tree and predict the
outcome of the price-fixing game.
b. Suppose both firms provide low-price guarantees.
Draw a new game tree and predict the outcome of
the price-fixing game.
c. Is the promise to match any lower price a
substantive promise or an empty promise?

Alternative Models of Oligopoly Pricing
4.1
Under a price-leadership model, a sudden drop in
price by the leader is unlikely to trigger a price war if
other firms believe that the price cut was caused by
higher 
.
4.2
Arrows up, down, or horizontal: Under the kinked
demand curve model, a firm that cuts its price expects
its competitor to 
its price, while a firm
that raises its price expects its competitor to
its price.

An entrepreneur who acts in a manner consistent with
the kinked demand curve model is a(n)

model, the demand for a firm s product is relatively
elastic when the price

Simultaneous Decision Making and the
Payoff Matrix
5.1
Consider a market with two firms managed by Harry
and Vera. Under a cartel (both firms pick the high
price), each firm earns a profit of $80. Under a duop-
oly (both firms pick the low price), each firm earns a
profit of $60. If the two firms pick different prices, the
high-price firm earns a profit of $20 and the low-price
firm earns a profit of $90.
a. Fill in the following payoff matrix.
b. The outcome of the pricing game is that Harry
picks the 
price and Vera picks the
price.

The Insecure Monopolist and Entry Deterrence
6.1
Otto has a monopoly on limousine service, and Carla
is thinking about entering the market. The outcome
of the entry-deterrence game represented by the
game tree on the following page is that Otto picks
the
quantity and Carla
the market.
6.2
Use the game tree in the previous exercise as a starting
point. If the minimum entry quantity increases, a single
number in one of the profit rectangles changes from
$
to a smaller number. If the relevant num-
ber is reduced by half, the new outcome of the entry-
deterrence game is that Otto picks the 
quantity and Carla 
the market.
6.3
Consider a market with an insecure monopolist. The
zero-profit quantity is 60 units and the minimum
entry quantity is 5 units. The entry-deterring quantity
is 
units. The zero-profit price is $80.
The slope of the market demand curve is $2 per unit
of output. The limit price is $

6.10 Ninja Turtles versus Tai Chi Frogs. The demand for
fantasy amphibians is linear, with a slope of $0.01 per
amphibian. The average cost of production is constant
at $3. The demand curve intersects the horizontal
average-cost curve at a quantity of 600 amphibians. A
firm selling ninja turtles currently has a monopoly, sell-
ing 300 turtles at a price of $6. A second firm is consid-
ering entering the market with tai chi frogs, and the
minimum entry quantity is 100 amphibians. If the turtle
firm is passive and lets the frog firm enter, each firm will
sell 200 amphibians at a price of $5.
a. Draw a graph like the one shown in Figure 27.9 on
page 588 with all the relevant numbers.
b. Draw a game tree like the one shown in Figure 27.10
on page 588 and predict the outcome of the game.
How will the turtle firm respond to the threat of
entry? Will the frog firm enter the market?
c. How would your response to part (a) change if the
minimum entry quantity dropped to 50 amphibians?
6.11 Take the Pen Money and Run? Consider the exam-
ple of Reynolds International Pen and the ball-point
pen. Suppose the unit cost of a ballpoint pen is $1.00.
Reynolds has two options:
1. Passive.
Pick the monopoly price of $13. In the
first year, Reynolds will sell 100,000 pens. Over
time as other firms enter the market with lower
prices, the quantity sold by Reynolds will decrease
by 20,000 per year, to 80,000 in the second year and
so on, down to zero in the sixth year.
2. Deterrence.
Commit to produce one million pens
per year, an amount large enough to deter entry.
The limit price is $1.05.
a. Under the passive strategy, the profit per year is
$
in the first year, $
in
the second year, and so on, down to zero in the
sixth year. The total profit over the 6-year period
would be $

b. Under the deterrence strategy, the profit per year is

. Over a 20-year period, total profit
would be $

c. Taking a 20-year perspective, which strategy is
more profitable?
d. How would your answer to part (c) change if the
limit price were $1.50 rather than $1.05?
6.12 Shuttle Deterrence? Consider the market for air
travel between Boston and New York. The long-run
average cost is constant at $100 per passenger, and the
demand curve is linear, with a slope of $2 per passen-
ger. The demand curve intersects the horizontal
average-cost curve at a quantity of 120 passengers.
The minimum entry quantity is 20 passengers.
FirstShuttle currently has a monopoly, with 60 passen-
gers at a price of $220. Another firm, SecondShuttle,
is considering the market, and the minimum entry
quantity is 20 passengers. If FirstShuttle is passive and
lets the other firm enter, each firm will have 40 pas-
sengers at a price of $180.
a. Draw a graph like the one shown in Figure 27.9 on

6.13 Going Off Patent. Consider the producer of a
branded drug that will soon go off-patent and com-
pete with generic versions of the drug. The average
cost of production is constant at $8 per dose. The pro-
ducer could prevent the entry of generics by commit-
ting to a limit price of $10. At this price, the firm will
sell 100 doses per day. Alternatively, the producer
could charge a price of $12 and passively allow gener-
ics to enter the market. The price elasticity of demand
for the branded drug is 2.0. (Related to Application 3
on page 591.)
a. Under the passive approach (price = $12), the
quantity of the branded drug demanded is
; the firm s profit is 
.
b. Under the entry-deterrence approach, the firm s
profit is $
.
c. The best approach is

d. If the price elasticity of demand for the branded drug
were 3.0 instead of 2.0, the profit under the passive
approach would be $

of $5 million per firm. If both firms run a standard cam-
paign, the net revenue from sales increases by $4 for
each firm. If only one firm runs a campaign, the adver-
tisers net revenue from sales increases by $8 million,
and the other firms net revenue from sales decreases by
$7 million. Fill in the blanks in the following table,

Got Milk? Bessie and George are milk producers, and
each must decide whether to spend $7 million on an

both advertise, each will earn $20 million in net revenue
and $13 million in profit ($20 million minus $7 million
for advertising). If only one producer advertises, that firm
will earn $16 million in net revenue, and the other firm
will earn $15 million in net revenue. Prepare a game tree
like Figure 27.11 on page 593. Assume that Bessie
decides first. What is the outcome of this advertising
game? If there is an advertisers  dilemma, how does it dif-
fer from the advertisers  dilemma discussed earlier in the

dilemma? (Related to Application 4 on page 594.)

Price-Fixing
Here is a price-fixing or cartel game for the classroom.
You ll have an opportunity to conspire to fix prices in a
hypothetical market with five firms. The instructor divides
the class into five groups. Each group represents one of five
firms that produce a particular good.
Each group must develop a pricing strategy for its firm,
recognizing that the other groups are choosing prices for
their firms at the same time. Only two choices are possible:
a high price (the cartel price) or a low price.
The profit of a particular firm depends on the price
chosen by the firm and the prices chosen by the four other
firms. Here is the profit matrix:
From the second row, if one of the five firms chooses the
high price, and the other four firms choose the low price, the
high-price firm earns a profit of $2, and each low-price firm
draw a game tree, and predict the outcome of the adver-
tising game.

the first three rounds, the firms make their choices without

make their choices. The group s score equals the profit
earned by the firm.

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
In 1997, a U.S. court blocked the proposed merger of
Staples and Office Depot, the nation s two largest office-
supply retailers. The judge in the case observed that the
merger would eliminate Office Depot as a competitor and
allow Staples to increase its prices by 13 percent. Where
did the judge get that number?
When you buy groceries, hardware, or office supplies, a
scanner at the checkout reads bar code information,
recording the price you pay and the quantity you purchase.
The scanner system helps retailers keep track of their stock
and allows them to instantly change prices without putting
new price tags on their products. The scanner data can
also be used to observe the pricing patterns of firms such
as Staples. Economists with the Federal Trade Commission
(FTC) found an interesting pattern: The prices charged by
Staples were lower in cities where Office Depot also had a
store. The competition generated by Office Depot led to
prices that were, on average, 13 percent lower.1

CHAPTER 28
CONTROLLING MARKET POWER: ANTITRUST AND REGULATION
602
T
his chapter looks at various public policies dealing with markets that are dom-
inated by a small number of firms. We ll start with the case of natural monop-
oly, which occurs when the scale economies in production are so large that
only a single large firm can survive. In this case, the government can intervene by reg-
ulating the price charged by the natural monopolist. Then we ll look at markets in
which the government can affect the number of firms in the market by using various
policies to promote competition.
The government uses antitrust policies to break monopolies into several smaller
companies, prevent corporate mergers that would reduce competition, and regulate
business practices that tend to reduce competition. Sometimes prior government reg-
ulations actually end up inhibiting competition, so the government later deregulates
an industry to promote more competition. In the last part of the chapter, we ll look at
the recent deregulation of three markets: air travel, telecommunications, and electric-
ity. In these three markets, the government reversed a long history of regulation,
deregulating the industries to promote competition.
NATURAL MONOPOLY
In an earlier chapter, we considered monopolies that resulted from artificial barriers
to entry, such as patents and government licenses. In this chapter, we ll look at natural
monopolies, which occur when the economies of scale for producing a product are so
large that only a single firm can survive. Some examples of natural monopolies are
water systems, natural gas distribution, electricity transmission, and cable TV service.
It is efficient for a city to have a single supplier of water service because a second sup-
plier would install a second set of water pipes when a single set of pipes would suffice.
Similarly, it is efficient to have a single set of transmission lines for electricity and a
single set of cables for TV service.
Picking an Output Level
Figure 28.1 shows the long-run average-cost curve for water service in a particular
city. The curve is negatively sloped and steep, reflecting the large economies of scale
that occur because water service requires a costly system of pipes, and the cost is the
same whether the firm pipes 70 or 70 million cubic meters of water. As the quantity of
water increases, the average cost per unit decreases because the cost of the pipe system
is spread over a larger volume of water.
What about the long-run marginal cost
the cost of an additional cubic meter of
water delivered to a customer
once the system is built? For each additional unit, a
water company incurs a cost for the energy required to pump the unit from the water
source to a customer. The pumping cost depends on the distance (horizontal and ver-
tical) from the source to the customer. To simplify matters, we ll assume that the mar-
ginal cost is constant at $0.80 per cubic meter.
Figure 28.1 shows how to use the cost curves and revenue curves to pick the out-
put level that maximizes profit. Like other firms, the provider of water can use the
marginal principle.
M A R G I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds its
marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal benefit equals the
marginal cost.
If a single firm
a monopolist
provides water, the firm-specific demand curve is
the same as the market demand curve: The market demand curve shows, for each
price, the number of units sold by the monopolist. From the firm s perspective, the

A Natural Monopoly Uses the
Marginal Principle to Pick
Quantity and Price
Because of an indivisible input (the pipe
system), the long-run average-cost
curve is negatively sloped. The monop-
olist chooses point a, where marginal
revenue equals marginal cost. The firm
sells 70 million units of water at a price
of $2.70 (point b) and an average cost
of $2.10 (point c). The profit per unit of
water is $0.60 (equal to $2.70  $2.10).
marginal benefit of a cubic meter of water is the increase in revenue
the marginal
revenue. The marginal principle is satisfied at point a, with 70 million cubic meters.
The price associated with this quantity is $2.70 per unit (shown by point b), and the
average cost is $2.10 per unit (shown by point c), so the profit per unit is $0.60. The
price exceeds the average cost, so the water company will earn a profit.
Will a Second Firm Enter?
If there are no artificial barriers to entry, a second firm could enter the water market.
What would happen if a second firm entered the market? In Figure 28.2, the entry of
a second firm would shift the demand curve of the first firm
the former monopo-
list
to the left, from D1 to D2: At each price, the first firm will sell less water because
it now shares the market with another firm. For example, at a price of $2.70, a total of
70 million units are sold, or 35 million for each firm (point d ). In general, the larger
the number of firms, the lower the demand curve for the typical firm.
Will a second firm enter the market? Notice that the demand curve of the typical
firm in a two-firm market lies entirely below the long-run average-cost curve, so there
is no quantity at which the price exceeds the average cost of production. No matter
what price the typical firm charges, it will lose money. The firms demand curve lies
below the average-cost curve because the average-cost curve is steep, reflecting the
large economies of scale for water provision. A second firm
with half the market
would have a very high average cost and wouldn t be able to charge a price high enough
to cover the cost of building the pipe system in the first place. Therefore, the second
firm will not enter the market, so there will be a single firm, a natural monopoly.
Price Controls for a Natural Monopoly
When a natural monopoly is inevitable, the government often sets a maximum price
that the monopolist can charge consumers. There are many examples of natural monop-
olies that are subject to maximum prices. Local governments regulate utilities and firms
that provide water, electricity, cable service, and local telephone service. Many state gov-
ernments use public utility commissions (PUCs) to regulate the electric power industry.

CHAPTER 28
CONTROLLING MARKET POWER: ANTITRUST AND REGULATION
604
We can use the water market to explain the effects of government regulation on a nat-
ural monopoly. Suppose the government sets a maximum price for water and requires the
water company to serve all consumers who are willing to pay the maximum price. In other
words, the government
not the firm
picks a point on the market demand curve. Under
an average-cost pricing policy, the government picks the price at which the market demand
curve intersects the monopolists long-run average-cost curve. In Figure 28.3, the average-
cost curve intersects the demand curve at point e, with a price of $1.20 per cubic meter.

PART 9
A P P L I C AT I O N  1
PUBLIC VERSUS PRIVATE WATERWORKS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: What is the rationale for regulating a
natural monopoly?
In the middle part of the nineteenth century, the British parliament staged an experi-
ment in private enterprise. In the early part of the century, water was drawn from local
rivers, stored in ponds on higher ground, and then distributed by wooden pipes to
customers. In most urban areas, this primitive sort of water system was run by local
government. The Industrial Revolution caused the rapid growth of urban areas, and
local governments lacked explicit powers to borrow money to finance the expansion of
their water systems. The policies of Parliament caused many towns and cities to
switch to private water companies, and by 1851 about three-fifths of the urban popu-
lation got their water from private companies. There were many problems with the
private provision of water, including low pressure that sometimes made firefighting
ineffective and water hardness (high mineral content) that damaged industrial boilers
and reduced the quality of silk products. The control of the water supply gradually
returned to local governments, and by 1891 only one-sixth of the urban population
was served by private water companies. In addition to improving water pressure and
water softness, the move to municipal provision increased total consumption of water
and decreased the capital cost per unit of water.
What does the British experience with water privatization tell us? The distribu-
tion of water is a natural monopoly, meaning that although a single firm will be prof-
itable, two firms will not. The private water companies established under the policies
of Parliament were unregulated natural monopolies. As we ve seen, an unregulated
monopoly is socially inefficient. In this case, the inefficiency resulted in a low-quality
product (hard water), low service (low pressure), low output (small quantity of water
per capita), and high capital cost. If the water monopolies had been regulated in an
efficient manner, the experience with privatization of the water supply would have
been different.

SATELLITE RADIO AS A NATURAL MONOPOLY
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: When does a natural monopoly occur?
In 2008, the nations only two satellite radio providers, Sirius Satellite Radio and XM
Satellite Radio, merged into a single firm. Together the two firms had 14 million sub-
scribers, each paying $13 per month for dozens of channels, most of which are free of
advertisements. Both firms were losing money as they struggled to get enough sub-
scribers to cover their substantial fixed costs. The cost of the infrastructure to set up a
single system
satellites and ground stations
is about $2 billion. In addition, both
firms added to their setup costs by signing contracts with radio personalities, news
organizations, and sports information sources. One possible advantage of a merger
was that the new firm could have a lower fixed cost per subscriber and thus could earn
a profit. One possible disadvantage was that the new firm might charge higher prices.
Two years later, the new firm, Sirius XM, earned its first quarterly profit of
$14.2 million, compared to a loss one year earlier of $245.8 million. The firm became
profitable
just barely
by increasing the number of subscribers to 19 million and

trust
An arrangement under which the owners
of several companies transfer their
decision-making powers to a small group
of trustees.
This is much lower than the profit-maximizing price of $2.70. As a result, the total quan-
tity of water demanded is much larger
150 million units compared to 70 million. The
purpose of the average-cost pricing policy is to get the lowest feasible price. The water
company would lose money at any price less than $1.20, so a lower price isn t feasible.
How will this regulatory policy affect the monopolist s production costs? Under
average-cost pricing, a change in the monopolist s production cost will have little
effect on its profit, because the government will soon adjust the regulated price to
keep the price equal to the average cost. The government will increase the regulated
price when the monopolists cost increases and decrease the price when the monopo-
lists cost decreases. Because the monopolist has no incentive to cut costs and faces no
penalty for higher costs, its costs are likely to creep upward. As average cost increases,
the regulated price will too.
ANTITRUST POLICY
A trust is an arrangement under which the owners of several companies transfer their
decision-making powers to a small group of trustees. The purpose of antitrust policy
is to promote competition among firms, which leads to lower prices for consumers.
Two government organizations, the Antitrust Division of the Department of
Justice and the Federal Trade Commission, are responsible for initiating actions against
individuals or firms that may be violating antitrust laws. The courts have the power to
impose penalties on the executives found to be in violation of the laws, including fines
and prison sentences. In some cases, the government seeks no penalties but directs the
firm to discontinue illegal practices and take other measures to promote competition.
We ll explore three types of antitrust policies: breaking up monopolies, blocking merg-
ers, and regulating business practices.
Breaking Up Monopolies
One form of antitrust policy is to break up a monopoly into several smaller firms. The
label antitrust  comes from the names of the early conglomerates that the govern-
ment broke up. The classic example is John D. Rockefeller s Standard Oil Trust,
which was formed in 1882 when the owners of 40 oil companies empowered nine
trustees to make the decisions for all 40 companies. The trust controlled over 90 per-
cent of the market for refined petroleum products, and the trustees ran it like a
monopoly. In 1911, the government ordered its breakup. The Supreme Court found
that Rockefeller had used unnatural methods  to maintain his monopoly power and
drive his rivals out of business. In addition to forming the trust, he coerced railroads to
give him special rates for shipping, and he spied on his competitors. The government
broke up Standard Oil into 34 separate companies, including the corporate ancestors
of Exxon, Mobil, Chevron, and Amoco.

thus lowering its cost per subscriber. In other words, the merger transformed two
unprofitable firms into a single profitable firm.
There was some concern that the merger would increase prices. Consumers
choose from five packages of stations, including a limited set of stations for $10, the
original Sirius stations for $13 (the same price as before the merger), a package that
combines the original Sirius stations and a subset of the XM radio stations for $17,
and a complete package for $19. In other words, the merger did not increase the price
of the original Sirius package, but gave consumers more options for lower-priced and
higher-priced packages.

PART 9
The American Tobacco Company started in 1890 as a merger of several tobacco
firms. By 1907, the company had acquired over 200 rival firms and controlled 95 percent
of the U.S. cigarette market. The Supreme Court found that American Tobacco main-
tained its monopoly power by driving rivals out of business and agreeing to exclusive con-
tracts with wholesalers that prevented them from purchasing cigarettes from other
companies. The court-ordered breakup in 1911 led to new companies, including several
of todays big cigarette companies: Reynolds, Liggett and Meyers, and P. Lorillard.
In 1982, the government broke up American Telephone and Telegraph (AT&T)
into seven regional phone companies. AT&T had used its legal monopoly in local
telephone service to prevent competition in the markets for long-distance service and
communications equipment. After an eight-year legal battle, AT&T agreed to form
seven Regional Bell Operating Companies, transforming Ma Bell  into seven Baby
Bells.  The new AT&T was allowed to compete in the market for long-distance ser-
vice, where it faced competition from newcomers MCI and Sprint. AT&T was also
allowed to operate in the market for communications equipment, where it faced com-
petition from newcomers Mitel and Northern Telecom.
Blocking Mergers
A merger occurs when two or more firms combine their operations. A horizontal
merger involves two firms producing a similar product, for example, two producers of
pet food. A vertical merger involves two firms at different stages of the production
process, for example, a sugar refiner and a candy producer. A second type of antitrust
policy is to block corporate mergers that would reduce competition and lead to
higher prices. We saw in an earlier chapter that as the number of firms in a market
increases, competition among firms drives down prices. Because a merger decreases
the number of firms in a market, it is likely to lead to higher prices. In 1994,
Microsoft tried to purchase Intuit, the maker of Quicken, a personal-finance soft-
ware package that was a substitute for a similar Microsoft product. The merger
would have reduced competition in the personal-finance software market, so the gov-
ernment blocked it.
Of course, the government does not oppose all corporate mergers. One possible
benefit from a merger is that the new firm could combine production, marketing, and
administrative operations, producing products at a lower average cost. Consumers
might reap the rewards in the form of lower prices. In 1997, the Justice Department
and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) released new guidelines for proposed
mergers. The new guidelines allow companies involved in a proposed merger to pre-
sent evidence that the merger would reduce costs and lead to lower prices, better
products, or better service. If the evidence for greater efficiency is convincing, the
government might allow a merger that reduces the number of firms in a market. The
chairman of the FTC assessed the effects of the new guidelines as follows:2
There may be some deals that go through which otherwise would not have. But it won t
change the result in a large number of cases [rather it will have] the greatest impact in a
transaction where the potential anticompetitive problem is modest and efficiencies that
would be created are great.
The new guidelines will bring the U.S. antitrust rules closer in line with those of
Europe and Canada and could help U.S. companies compete in those markets.
In recent years, the analysis of proposed mergers has shifted from counting the
number of firms in a market to predicting how a particular merger would affect prices.
The data generated by retail checkout scanners provide an enormous amount of infor-
mation about prices and quantities sold. Using these data, economists can determine
how one firm s pricing policies affect the sales of that firm and its competitors.
Economists can use this information to predict whether a merger would lead to
higher prices.
merger
A process in which two or more firms
combine their operations.

The FTC used this logic to convince the court that the proposed merger of Staples
and Office Depot would lead to higher prices. The judge in the case observed that,
direct evidence shows that by eliminating Staples  most significant, and in many markets,
only, rival, the merger would allow Staples to increase prices or otherwise maintain prices
at an anticompetitive level.
Evidence from the companies  pricing data showed that the merger would have
allowed Staples to increase its prices by about 13 percent. According to an FTC study,
blocking the merger saved consumers an estimated $1.1 billion over five years.
Merger Remedy for Wonder® Bread
In some cases, the government allows a merger to happen but imposes restrictions on
the new company. In 1995, Interstate Bakeries, the nation s third-largest wholesale
baker, tried to buy Continental Baking, the maker of Wonder bread. Based on grocery
store scanner data, the government concluded that Wonder bread is a close substitute
for Interstate s bread: The demand for Wonder bread increases when the price of
Interstate s bread increases, and vice versa.3 The scanner data showed that when
Interstate increased its price, many consumers switched to Wonder bread, so their
bread money went to Continental instead of Interstate. The substitutability of the two
brands discouraged Interstate from increasing its prices.
Table 28.1 shows an example of a merger leading to higher prices and smaller
quantities. Lets assume that the average cost per loaf of bread is $1.50, and this doesn t
change with a merger. The situation before the merger is shown in columns 1 and 3:
For each brand, the price per loaf of bread is $2.00, the quantity is 100 loaves, and the
profit is $50 (the profit $0.50 per loaf times 100 loaves).
How would a merger affect the incentives to raise prices? After a merger, a single
company would earn the profits from both brands (Wonder and Interstate) and pick

As we saw in the chapter opener, the FTC used pricing data to support its decision
to block a proposed merger between Staples and Office Depot. The data showed that
Staples charged lower prices in cities where Office Depot also had stores. Figure 28.4
shows Staples  revenue and cost curves for one specific product: file folders. Panel A
shows what happens when Staples faces no competition from an Office Depot, and
Panel B shows what happens when it does. The demand curve of Staples is lower in the
city where it faces competition with Office Depot because the two firms share the mar-
ket. Using the marginal principle, Staples picks the quantity and price where its mar-
ginal revenue equals its marginal cost. The profit-maximizing price is $14 in a city
without an Office Depot and $12 in a city with one.

PART 9
both prices. Suppose the new company increased the price of Interstate bread to $2.20
but kept the price of Wonder bread at $2.00. The price hike would bring bad news
and good news for the new company:
Bad news: Less profit on Interstate Bread. As shown in columns 3 and 4, the
price hike decreases the quantity of Interstate bread from 100 to 70 loaves.
Although the profit per loaf increases to $0.70 (the new price of $2.20 minus the
average cost of $1.50), only 70 loaves are sold, so the profit from the brand drops
to $49, down from $50. The bad news is the $1 loss of profit on Interstate Bread.
Good news: More profit on Wonder bread. As shown in columns 1 and 2, the
increase in the price of Interstate Bread increases the quantity of Wonder bread
sold from 100 to 110 loaves. The profit per loaf is still $0.50 per bread, so the
profit on Wonder bread increases to $55, up from $50. The good news is the
extra $5 of profit on Wonder bread.
In this case, the good news ($5 more profit from Wonder) exceeds the bad news ($1 less
profit from Interstate), so the price hike increases the total profit of the merged com-
pany. This is shown in columns 5 and 6. Although the total quantity drops, total profit
increases by $4. A merger means that the good news from a price hike stays within the
larger firm, encouraging that firm to increase prices.
The lesson from this example is that a merger of two firms selling close substitutes
may lead to higher prices. Thats what the Department of Justice concluded in the case
of Interstate Bakeries and Continental Bakery. The government allowed the merger
between the two companies but forced Interstate to sell some of its brands and bak-
eries. For example, Interstate sold the rights to sell its Weber brand bread to Four-S
Baking Company. The idea was to ensure that other companies would be able to com-
pete with the newly merged company.
Regulating Business Practices: Price-Fixing, Tying, and
Cooperative Agreements
The third type of antitrust policy involves the regulation of business practices. The
government may intervene when a specific business practice increases market concen-
tration in an already concentrated market. A tie-in sale occurs when a business forces
the buyer of one product to purchase another product. The FTC recently charged a
pharmaceutical company with tying the sale of clozapine, an antipsychotic drug, to a
blood testing and monitoring system. Another illegal business practice is a cooperative
agreement to limit advertising. The FTC recently charged a group of auto dealers
with restricting comparative and discount advertising.
The Robinson Patman Act prohibits the selling of products at unreasonably low
prices  with the intent of reducing competition, a practice known as predatory pricing.
A firm engages in predatory pricing when it sells a product at a price below its production
costs, with the objective of driving a rival out of business. Once the predators rivals drop
out of the market, the firm then charges a monopoly price, well above its production cost.
This strategy will be profitable if the firm can charge the monopoly price for a long
enough period to offset the losses it experienced while driving its rivals out of business.

CHAPTER 28
CONTROLLING MARKET POWER: ANTITRUST AND REGULATION
610
But is predatory pricing really practical? Consider a market with two firms, one of
which is determined to have the market to itself. By cutting its price below its cost, the
firm can drive its competitor out of business, losing perhaps $10 million in the
process. If it increases its price next year, there may be nothing to prevent a new firm
from entering the market. If so, it would have to cut its price below its cost again to
drive the new firm out. The problem with predatory pricing is that it never ends. The
firm must repeatedly lose money to drive out an endless series of competitors.
The Microsoft Cases
In recent years, the most widely reported antitrust actions have involved Microsoft
Corporation, the software giant. Microsoft receives royalties from computer makers
that install the Microsoft operating software on their computers. The curious
and
illegal
feature of the original arrangement was that Microsoft received a royalty for
every computer made by the firm, even if the firm installed other operating systems
on some of its computers. This scheme discouraged computer makers from using soft-
ware from Microsofts rivals, and the courts declared the practice illegal in 1994.
In the case of United States v. Microsoft Corporation, the judge concluded that
Microsoft stifled competition in the software industry. Specifically, Microsoft tried to
use its monopoly in the market for operating systems to get a monopoly in the
browser market. Under an initial ruling, the judges remedy was to break up the corpo-
ration into two companies, one producing the Windows operating system and a sec-
ond producing application software. On appeal, the U.S. Justice Department rejected
this remedy, and in 2002 directed Microsoft to accommodate rival browsers on the
Windows desktop and release more technical information about its operating system.
A Brief History of U.S. Antitrust Policy
Table 28.2 provides a brief summary of the history of antitrust policy. The first legis-
lation was the Sherman Antitrust Act of 1890, which made it illegal to monopolize a
market or to engage in practices that result in a restraint of trade. Because the act did
not specify which practices were illegal, it led to conflicting court rulings.
Many of the ambiguities of the Sherman Act were resolved by the Clayton Act of
1914. The Clayton Act outlawed specific practices that discourage competition,
including tie-in sales contracts and price discrimination that reduces competition.
The act also outlawed mergers resulting from the purchase of a competitor s stock
when such a merger would substantially reduce competition.

HEINZ AND BEECH-NUT BATTLE FOR SECOND PLACE
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Does competition between the second- and
third-largest firms matter?
In 2001 H.J. Heinz Company announced plans to buy Milnot Holding Company s
Beech-Nut for $185 million. The merger would combine the nation s second- and
third-largest sellers of baby food, with a combined market share of 28 percent. The
combined company would still be less than half the size of the market leader, Gerber,
with its 70 percent market share. The FTC successfully blocked the merger, based on
two observations:
Most retailers stock only two brands of baby food, Gerber and either Heinz or
Beech-Nut. The two smaller companies compete vigorously for shelf space,
with discounts, coupons, and other programs that lead to lower prices for con-
sumers. After the merger, the Heinz brand would disappear, leaving Beech-Nut
as a secure second brand on the shelves next to Gerber. The elimination of com-
petition for second place would lead to higher prices.
The smaller the number of firms in an oligopoly, the easier it is to coordinate
pricing. The FTC argued that significant market concentration makes it easier
for firms in the market to collude, expressly or tacitly, and thereby force price
above or farther above the competitive level.  In other words, in a market with
two firms instead of three, it would be easier for the baby-food manufacturers to
fix prices.

XIDEX RECOVERS ITS ACQUISITION COST IN TWO YEARS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: How does a merger affect prices?
In 1981 the FTC brought an antitrust suit against Xidex Corporation for its earlier
acquisition of two rivals in the microfilm market. By acquiring Scott Graphics, Inc., in
1976 and Kalvar Corporation in 1979, Xidex increased its market share of the U.S.
microfilm market from 46 to 71 percent. As a result, the price of microfilm increased:
The price of one type of microfilm (diazo) increased by 11 percent, and the price of a
second type (vesicular) increased by 23 percent. These price hikes were large enough
that Xidex recovered the cost of acquiring its two rivals ($4.2 million for Scott
Graphics and $6 million for Kalvar) in less than two years. To settle the antitrust law-
suit, Xidex agreed to license its microfilm technology
at bargain prices
to other
firms.

Subsequent 
legislation 
clarified 
and 
extended 
antitrust 
laws. 
The
Robinson Patman Act of 1936 prohibited predatory pricing. The Celler Kefauver
Act of 1950 closed a loophole in the Clayton Act by prohibiting one firm from pur-
chasing another firm s physical assets, such as buildings and equipment, when the
acquisition would reduce competition substantially. The Hart Scott Rodino Act of
1980 extended antitrust legislation to proprietorships and partnerships. Before this
act, antitrust legislation applied only to corporations.
DEREGULATION: AIRLINES,
TELECOMMUNICATIONS, AND ELECTRICITY
We have discussed government policies that address the problems that result from
market concentration. When a monopoly is inevitable, the government can regulate a
natural monopoly to prevent excessive prices. When the merger of two firms would
increase concentration, the government can prevent the merger and thereby promote
competition. We now shift the emphasis and look at situations in which government
regulations inhibit competition rather than promote it. When a regulation inhibits
competition, government can use deregulation to reverse the course and promote
competition. We explore the deregulation of two markets: air travel and telecommuni-
cations. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 eliminated entry restrictions and price
controls in the market for air travel. The Telecommunications Act of 1996 eliminated
most price controls for cable television and established a framework for entry into the
markets for cable television service, local telephone service, and Internet service.
Deregulation of Airlines
Consider first the deregulation of airline service.4 Before 1978, the Civil Aeronautics
Board (CAB) regulated interstate air travel by limiting entry into the market and con-
trolling prices. About 90 percent of the markets were monopolized, and studies indi-
cated that prices were 30 to 50 percent higher than they would have been in a more
competitive environment. The Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 eliminated most of
the entry restrictions and price controls, and the CAB eventually disappeared.
Deregulation led to lower prices, which fell by about 28 percent, on average. By
1998 deregulation had generated $24 billion in savings for passengers. Here are the
factors that contributed to the lower prices and the percentage of savings for each:
28.3
Factor
Percentage of Savings
Competition from incumbent carriers
18%
Competition from Southwest Airlines
31
Competition from other entrants
10
Improvements in operating efficiencies
41
Although prices fell on most routes, about a quarter of routes actually experienced
price increases. In general, prices were lower on long routes and higher on short
routes. This is not surprising, because the CAB had a policy of setting long-haul fares
above average cost and short-haul fares below average cost. In addition, many airports
are dominated by just one or two airlines. In 1998 the fares at 12 hub airports with a
two-firm concentration ratio of at least 85 percent were 23 percent higher than at other
airports with more competition, including low-cost carriers like Southwest Airlines.
Deregulation of Telecommunication Services
Consider next the deregulation of telecommunication services.5 The Telecommunications
Act of 1996 established new rules to promote competition among firms that transmit
video, voice, and data. Several provisions of the act affect the Regional Bell Operating

613
PART 9
Companies (the Baby Bells) that were formed as a result of the breakup of AT&T in 1982.
Here are the most important provisions of the act:
Local telephone service. The act opened local telephone service to competi-
tion. New firms will now compete with the Baby Bells for local-service cus-
tomers. In addition, cable TV firms might eventually provide telephone service
over their cables.
Cable TV service. Price controls for cable TV services were eliminated, and tele-
phone companies will now be allowed to enter the market for cable TV services.
Long-distance service. Once there is sufficient competition for local tele-
phone service, the Baby Bells will be allowed to enter the long-distance market.
The challenge in deregulating local telephone service is to develop a set of rules
giving competitors access to the wires and cables leading into residences. That access
is currently controlled by the Baby Bells. After a slow start, there has been some
progress in opening up local telephone service to competition, with most of the
progress in large cities. As competition spreads, we can expect lower prices for local
service, just as we saw in 1984 with the deregulation of long-distance service.
Deregulation of Electricity
Consider next the deregulation of electricity. The electricity industry has been regulated
as a natural monopoly since its early days. There are three stages of producing electricity:
generation in power plants, transmission along high-voltage lines, and distribution to
final users along low-voltage lines. The transmission stage is subject to economies of scale
because a city can be served by one set of transmission lines from power plants. There are
substantial fixed costs associated with laying the transmission lines, so it is sensible to lay
one set of lines and regulate the single firm as a natural monopolist. The same economies
of scale occur when it comes to the distribution of power to individual users.
Until recently, there were also substantial economies of scale in electricity genera-
tion. The minimum efficient scale for power plants was large relative to the size of the
markets they served, meaning that a single firm could supply the market more effi-
ciently than several small firms. Under traditional electricity regulation, public and pri-
vate utilities were responsible for all three phases of electricity production: They
generated electricity in their own power plants and then used their own transmission
and distribution systems to deliver electricity to consumers. State and local govern-
ments granted each utility a monopoly over a particular geographical area and set the
price of electricity at a level so the utility earned a reasonable or fair  accounting
profit, including a fair return on capital investment. This is the average-cost pricing we
discussed earlier in the chapter. Because utilities were responsible for all three stages of
production, there was just one price to control
the retail price charged to consumers.
In the 1990s, there was growing pressure to deregulate the electricity market for
two reasons. First, technological innovations reduced the economies of scale in electric-
ity generation, so generation was no longer a true natural monopoly. For example, the
minimum efficient scale for combined cycle gas turbine technology (CCGT) is about
one-fifth the scale of a traditional power plant. Instead of a single power source for a
city, there could be many generators, with competition among alternative producers
leading to lower prices. A second factor in the pressure to deregulate was the substantial
variation in electricity prices across states. For example, the price was about 10 cents per
kilowatt-hour (kWh) in California and some northeastern states (Massachusetts,
Connecticut, and New York), 6 cents in some central states (Indiana and Wisconsin),
and 5 cents in northwestern states (Oregon and Washington). Consumers in high-price
states called for deregulation to allow electricity to be transmitted across state lines.
Between 1998 and 2002, a total of 20 states deregulated their electricity markets.
In California, two years after deregulation the market was in disarray, with high
prices, rolling blackouts, and large losses for the state s utilities. The problems were
caused by a perfect storm  of the partial nature of the deregulation, higher fuel costs,

614
In this chapter, we ve explored
public policies for markets
with a few dominant firms. In
the case of natural monopoly,
the government can regulate
prices. In other industries, the
government uses antitrust poli-
cies to affect the number of
firms in the market, encouraging competition that leads to
lower prices. Here are the main points of the chapter:
1 A natural monopoly occurs when there are large-scale
economies in production, so the market can support only
one firm.
a drought that decreased the supply of hydroelectric power from the Pacific
Northwest, and price manipulation by power-generating companies. California partly
re-regulated the market, but other states persisted. For these other states, deregula-
tion decreased electricity prices by about 7 percent for retail customers and by smaller
amounts for commercial (3% reduction) and industrial (1% reduction) users.6
2 Under an average-cost pricing policy, the regulated price for a
natural monopoly is equal to the average cost of production.
3 The government uses antitrust policy to break up some dom-
inant firms, prevent some corporate mergers, and regulate
business practices that reduce competition.
4 The modern approach to merger policy uses price data to
predict the effects of a merger.
5 In most circumstances, predatory pricing is unprofitable
because the monopoly power is costly to acquire and hard
to maintain.
6 The deregulation of the airline industry led to more competition
and lower prices on average, but higher prices in some markets.

Environmental Costs for Regulated Monopoly.
The Bonneville Power Administration (BPA) is a
regulated monopoly in the Northwest that uses
dozens of hydroelectric dams to generate electricity.
Unfortunately, the BPAs dams block the paths of
migrating fish, contributing to the decline of several
species. Suppose that BPA spends $100 million to
make its hydroelectric dams less hazardous for migrat-
ing fish. Who will bear the cost of this program?

From Private to Public Water Supply. Consider the
British experience with water provision. Suppose that
an unregulated private monopoly has a price of $3 per

$2 per unit, and a constant marginal cost of $1.
(Related to Application 1 on page 605.)

2.10 Check YellowPages.com? On Yellins first day on the
job as an economist with the FTC, she was put on a
team examining a proposed merger between the coun-
trys second- and fourth-largest hardware store chains.
Her job was to predict whether a merger would
increase hardware prices. Her boss handed her some
CDs with checkout scanner data from the second-
largest chain. Each CD contained scanner data from
one small town, listing the prices and quantities of
hammers, wrenches, nuts, bolts, rakes, glue, drills, and
hundreds of other hardware products. Her boss also
gave her the Web address for YellowPages.com. How
can she use the information in the disks and

2.11 Cost Savings from a Merger. Consider the following
statement from a firm that has proposed a merger
between two companies: The two companies could
save about $50 million per year by combining our pro-
duction, marketing, and administrative operations. In
other words, we could realize substantial economies of
scale. Therefore, the government should allow the
merger.  In light of the new guidelines concerning
mergers, how would you react to this statement?
2.12 Deadweight Loss from a Merger. Consider a mar-
ket that is initially served by two firms, each of which
charges a price of $10 and sells 100 units of the good.
The long-run average cost of production is constant at
$6 per unit. Suppose a merger increases the price to
$14 and reduces the total quantity sold from 200 to
150. Compute the consumer loss associated with the
merger. How does it compare to the increase in profit?
What is the net loss from the merger?

additional airlines to serve your city. According to a
recent report, the additional competition made possi-
ble by the new gates would decrease the average air-
line fare from $220 to $200 and increase the number
of passengers from 400 to 600 per day. The city would
borrow money to finance the project, and the daily
payment required to pay off the loan over 20 years
would be $8,100. How does the benefit to consumers
compare to the cost of the project?

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
So, why are you selling this used car?
The buyers of used cars ask this question frequently and
then listen carefully to the answer. Assuming the car seller
is honest, the answer the buyer hopes for is Because I
need a different car for my new job,  or I buy a new car
every three years.  The buyer wants to avoid sellers who
are trying to get rid of a lemon
a car that breaks down
frequently and generates large repair bills. People don t
ask this sort of question in other markets. For example, no
one ever asks, So, why are you selling this pizza?
Does my insurance policy cover accidental death from
bungee jumping?
Life is risky, and people buy insurance to decrease their
financial losses from events such as theft, sickness, injury,
and death. The question from the potential bungee jumper
reveals an important fact about insurance: It causes people
to take greater risks because they know insurance will
cover part of the cost of an accident.

A situation in which one side of the

T
his chapter explores the role of information in markets and what happens when
one side of the market has better information than the other. In the market for
used cars, sellers know more about the quality of the product than buyers do.
In the market for life insurance, buyers know more about the risks they face than sell-
ers do. As we saw earlier in the book, the model of supply and demand is based on sev-
eral assumptions, one of which is that buyers and sellers have enough information to
make informed choices. In a world of fully informed buyers and sellers, markets oper-
ate smoothly, generating an equilibrium price and an equilibrium quantity for each
good. In a world with imperfect information, some goods will be sold in very small
numbers or not sold at all. In addition, buyers and sellers will use resources to acquire
information to help make better decisions. The 2001 Nobel Prize in economics was
awarded to three economists
George Akerlof, Michael Spence, and Joseph Stiglitz
who studied the effects of imperfect information on all sorts of markets.
THE LEMONS PROBLEM
The classic example of a market with imperfect information is the market for used
cars.1 Suppose there are two types of cars, low quality and high quality. A low-quality
car, also known as a lemon,  breaks down frequently and has relatively high repair
costs. A high-quality car, also known as a plum,  is reliable and has relatively low
repair costs. Suppose buyers cannot distinguish between lemons and plums. Although
a buyer can get some information about a particular car by looking at the car and tak-
ing it for a test drive, the information gleaned from this kind of inspection is not
enough to determine the quality of the car. In contrast, a person selling a car after
owning it for a while knows from experience whether the car is a lemon or a plum. We
say there is asymmetric information in a market if one side of the market
either
buyers or sellers
has better information than the other side. Because buyers cannot
distinguish between lemons and plums, there will be a single market for used automo-
biles: Both types of cars will be sold together in this mixed market for the same price.
Uninformed Buyers and Knowledgeable Sellers
How much is a consumer willing to pay for a used car that could be either a lemon or
a plum? To determine a consumer s willingness to pay in a mixed market with both
lemons and plums, we must answer three questions:
1 How much is the consumer willing to pay for a plum?
2 How much is the consumer willing to pay for a lemon?
3 What is the chance that a used car purchased in the mixed market will be of
low quality?
Suppose the typical buyer is willing to pay $4,000 for a plum and $2,000 for a
lemon. The buyer is willing to pay less for a lemon because it is less reliable and has
higher repair costs. For someone willing to put up with the hassle and repair expense,
a lemon is a reasonable car. Thats why the typical buyer is willing to pay $2,000, not
$0, for a low-quality car we tag with the label lemon.  Someone who pays $2,000 and
gets a lemon is just as happy as someone who pays $4,000 and gets a plum.
Consumer expectations play a key role in determining the market outcome when
there is imperfect information. Suppose half the used cars on the road are lemons, and
consumers know this. A reasonable expectation for consumers is that half the cars on the
used-car market will be lemons, too. In other words, buyers initially expect a 50 50 split
between the two types of cars. A reasonable assumption is that a buyer in the mixed mar-
ket is willing to pay the average value of the two types of cars, or $3,000. In other words,
a buyer is willing to pay $3,000 for a 50 50 chance of getting either a plum or a lemon.
The current owner of a used car knows from everyday experience whether the
car is a lemon or a plum. Given the single market price for all used cars, lemons and
29.1

619
PART 10
plums alike, the question for each owner is Should I sell my car?  The answers to
this question are shown by the two supply curves in Figure 29.1, one for lemons and
one for plums:
Lemon supply. As shown by the lower curve, the minimum supply price for
lemons is $500: At any price less than $500, no lemons will be supplied. Lemons
have a lower minimum price because they are worth less to their current own-
ers. The number of lemons supplied increases with price. For example, 80 cars
will be supplied at a price of $3,000 (point b).
Plum supply. As shown by the upper curve, the minimum supply price for
plums is $2,500: At any price less than $2,500, no plums will be supplied.
Consistent with the law of supply, the higher the price of used cars, the larger
the number of plums supplied. For example, 20 plums will be supplied at a price
of $3,000 (point a).

All Used Cars on the Market Are Lemons
If buyers assume that there is a 50 50 chance of getting a lemon or a plum, they are willing to pay
$3,000 for a used car. At this price, 20 plums are supplied (point a) along with 80 lemons (point b). This
is not an equilibrium because consumers  expectations of a 50 50 split are not realized. If consumers
become pessimistic and assume that all cars on the market will be lemons, they are willing to pay
$2,000 for a used car. At this price, only lemons will be supplied (point c). Consumer expectations are
realized, so the equilibrium is shown by point c, with an equilibrium price of $2,000.
Equilibrium with All Low-Quality Goods
Table 29.1 shows two scenarios for our hypothetical used-car market, based on the
supply curves shown in Figure 29.1. In the first column, we assume buyers have 50 50
expectations about the quality of used cars. As we saw earlier, if buyers expect a 50 50
split between lemons and plums, the typical buyer will be willing to pay $3,000 for a
used car. From the supply curves in Figure 29.1, we know that at this price 20 plums
and 80 lemons will be supplied, so 80 percent of the used cars (80 of 100) will be
lemons. In this case, consumers are too optimistic and underestimate the chance of
getting a lemon.
The experiences of these 100 consumers show that the actual chance of getting
a lemon is 80 percent, not 50 percent as initially assumed. Once future buyers real-
ize this, they will of course become more pessimistic about the used-car market.

CHAPTER 29
IMPERFECT INFORMATION: ADVERSE SELECTION AND MORAL HAZARD
620
thin market
A market in which some high-quality
goods are sold but fewer than would be
sold in a market with perfect information.
Suppose they assume that all the used cars on the market will be lemons. Under
this assumption, the typical buyer will be willing to pay only $2,000 (the value of a
lemon) for a used car. As shown in Figure 29.1, this price is less than the $2,500
minimum price for supplying plums, so plums will disappear from the used-car
market. At a price of $2,000, the quantity of plums supplied is zero, but the quan-
tity of lemons supplied is 45 (point c). In other words, all the used cars will be
lemons, so consumers  pessimism is justified. Because consumers  expectations are
consistent with their actual experiences in the market, the equilibrium price of used
cars is $2,000. The equilibrium in the used-car market is shown in the second col-
umn of Table 29.1.
In this equilibrium, no plums are bought or sold, so every buyer will get a lemon.
People get exactly what they pay for: They are willing to pay $2,000 for a serviceable
but low-quality car, and thats what each consumer gets. The domination of the used-
car market by lemons is an example of the adverse-selection problem. The unin-
formed side of the market (buyers in this case) must choose from an undesirable or
adverse selection of used cars. The asymmetric information in the market generates a
downward spiral of price and quality:
The presence of low-quality goods on the market pulls down the price con-
sumers are willing to pay.
The decrease in price decreases the number of high-quality goods supplied,
decreasing the average quality of goods on the market.
This decrease in the average quality of goods on the market pulls down the
price consumers are willing to pay again.
In the extreme case, the downward spiral continues until all the cars on the mar-
ket are lemons.
A Thin Market: Equilibrium with Some High-Quality Goods
The disappearance of plums from our hypothetical used-car market is an extreme
case. The plums disappeared from the market because informed plum owners decided
to keep their cars rather than sell them at a relatively low price in the used-car market.
This outcome would change if the minimum supply price of plums were lower, specif-
ically if it were below $2,000. In this case, most but not all the used cars on the market
will be lemons, and some lucky buyers will get plums. In this case, we say asymmetric
information generates a thin market: Some high-quality goods are sold, but fewer
than would be sold in a market with perfect information.

PART 10
Figure 29.2 shows the situation that leads to a thin market. The minimum supply
price for plums is $1,833, and the quantity of plums supplied increases with the price of
used cars. Suppose consumers are initially pessimistic, assuming all cars for sale will be
lemons. This means consumers are willing to pay only $2,000 for a used car. Because the
minimum supply price for plums ($1,833) is now less than the willingness to pay for a
lemon, some plums will be supplied at a price of $2,000. In Figure 29.2, 5 plums and
45 lemons are supplied at this price, so 1 of every 10 buyers will get a plum. In this case,
pessimism is not an equilibrium, because some buyers will get plums when they expect
lemons. This is also shown in the first column of Table 29.2.

If buyers are pessimistic and assume that only lemons will be sold, they are willing to pay $2,000 for

equilibrium because 10 percent of consumers get plums, contrary to their expectations. If consumers
assume that there is a 25 percent chance of getting a plum, they are willing to pay $2,500 for a used
car. At this price, 20 plums are supplied (point c), along with 60 lemons (point d). This is an equilib-
rium because 25 percent of consumers get plums, consistent with their expectations. Consumer
expectations are realized, so the equilibrium is shown by points c and d.

IMPERFECT INFORMATION: ADVERSE SELECTION AND MORAL HAZARD
622
In equilibrium, consumer expectations about the chances of getting the two types
of cars are realized. Suppose consumers expect one of every four cars to be a plum.
Lets assume each consumer is willing to pay $2,500 for a used car under these circum-
stances. Consumers are willing to pay a bit more than the value of a lemon because
there is a small chance of getting a plum. In Figure 29.2, at this price 20 plums are
supplied (point c) and 60 lemons are supplied (point d ), so in fact one in four con-
sumers actually gets a plum. This is an equilibrium because 25 percent of the cars sold
are plums and 75 percent are lemons, consistent with consumers  expectations. This is
also shown in the second column of Table 29.2.
Evidence for the Lemons Problem
The lemons model makes two predictions about markets with asymmetric informa-
tion. First, the presence of low-quality goods in a market will at least reduce the num-
ber of high-quality goods in the market and may even eliminate them. Second, buyers
and sellers will respond to the lemons problem by investing in information and other
means of distinguishing between low-quality and high-quality goods. What is the evi-
dence for the lemons model?
Studies of the market for used pickup trucks have provided mixed results concern-
ing the lemons problem.2 It appears that for trucks less than 10 years old, those sold
on the market are just as reliable, on average, as those that remain with their current
owners. These studies provide support for the second implication of the theory of
lemons, that people acquire information and develop effective means to deal with the
problem of asymmetric information. In contrast, there does seem to be a lemons
problem for trucks at least 10 years old, which represent about one-third of transac-
tions. Compared to old trucks that remain with their current owners, old trucks
that are sold have significantly higher repair costs, with a difference in cost of about
45 percent. Old trucks that are sold have a much higher probability of requiring
engine and transmission repairs.
RESPONDING TO THE LEMONS PROBLEM
In a market with asymmetric information, there are strong incentives for buyers
and sellers to solve the lemons problem. In our example of a thin market, the price
of a used car is $2,500, but consumers are willing to pay $4,000 for a plum. This
$1,500 gap between the willingness to pay for a plum and the price in the mixed
market provides an incentive for buyers to acquire information to help identify
plums. It also provides an incentive for plum owners to prove they are selling high-
quality cars.
Buyers Invest in Information
In our model of the thin market, one in four buyers pays $2,500 to get a plum
worth $4,000. The more information a buyer has, the greater the chance of picking
a plum from the cars in the mixed market. Suppose a buyer gets enough informa-
tion to identify the plums in a market. The buyer could purchase a plum worth
$4,000 at the prevailing price of $2,500, generating a gain of $1,500. A buyer can
get information about individual cars by taking the car to a mechanic for a careful
inspection. In addition, a buyer can get general information about the reliability of
different models from magazines and the Internet. Consumer Reports publishes
information on repair histories of different models and computes a Trouble
index, scoring each model on a scale of 1 to 5. By consulting these information
sources, a buyer improves the chances of getting a high-quality car. Another
29.2

623
PART 10
information source is Carfax.com, which provides information on individual cars,
including their accident histories.
Consumer Satisfaction Scores from ValueStar and eBay
The problem of asymmetric information in consumer goods such as cars also
occurs for some types of consumer services. Most consumers can t easily deter-
mine the quality of service they will receive from an auto repair shop, a landscaper,
or a plumber. How can a high-quality service provider distinguish itself from low-
quality providers?
Some organizations provide information about firms that provide consumers ser-
vices such as landscaping, auto repair, and home improvement. ValueStar is a consumer
guide and business directory that uses customer satisfaction surveys to determine how
well a firm does relative to its competitors in providing quality service. To earn the
right to display a Customer-Rated seal from ValueStar, a firm must prove that it has all
the required licenses and insurance and must agree to pay for a survey of its past cus-
tomers. ValueStar uses consumer surveys to compute a consumer-satisfaction score for
each company. Any company receiving a score of at least 85 out of 100 has the right to
display a Customer-Rated Gold seal for a one-year period. In New York City,
servicemagic.com rates all kinds of contractors and household service providers, with
scores based on reports from consumers.
Online consumers help each other by rating online sellers. On eBay, buyers must
rely on sellers to honestly disclose the quality of the goods they are auctioning and to
promptly ship them once a consumer pays. Buyers help other purchasers distinguish
good  from bad  sellers on eBay by rating them online with stars,  indicating their
satisfaction with their transactions. The same sort of information is provided by peo-
ple who buy second-hand books.
Guarantees and Lemons Laws
Used-car sellers also have an incentive to solve the lemons problem. If a plum owner
persuades a buyer that his or her car is a plum and then sells the car for $4,000 rather
than $2,500, the seller s gain is $1,500. Sellers can identify a car as a plum in a sea of
lemons by offering one of the following guarantees:
Money-back guarantees. The seller could promise to refund the $4,000 price if
the car turns out to be a lemon. Because the car is in fact a plum
a fact known
by the seller
the buyer will not ask for a refund, so both the buyer and the
seller will be happy with the transaction.
Warranties and repair guarantees. The seller could promise to cover any extraor-
dinary repair costs for one year. Because the car is a plum, there won t be any extra-
ordinary costs, so both the buyer and the seller will be happy with the transaction.
Many states have laws that require automakers to buy back cars that experience
frequent problems in the first year of use. For example, under California s Song-
Beverly Consumer Warranty Act, also known as the Lemons Law,  auto dealers are
required to repurchase vehicles that have been brought back for repair at least four
times for the same problem or have been in the mechanic s shop for at least 30 cal-
endar days in the first year following purchase. A vehicle repurchased under the
lemons law must be fixed before it is sold to another customer and must be identi-
fied as a lemon with a stamp on the title and a sticker on the car that says lemons
law buyback.  One problem with enforcing these laws is that lemons can cross state
lines without a paper trail. The interstate commerce in lemons has led to new laws
in some states requiring the branding of lemons on vehicle titles to follow the car
when it crosses state lines.

REGULATION OF THE CALIFORNIA KIWIFRUIT MARKET
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: How can government solve the adverse-
selection problem?
Kiwifruit is subject to imperfect information because buyers cannot determine its
sweetness
its quality level
by simple inspection. The sweetness level at the time of
consumption is determined by the fruit s maturity
its sugar content at the time of
harvest. Kiwifruit continues to convert starch into sugar after it is picked, but fruit that
is picked early has a low sugar content at harvest time and never tastes sweet. There is
asymmetric information because producers know the maturity of the fruit, but fruit
wholesalers and grocery stores, who buy fruit at the time of harvest, cannot determine
whether a piece of fruit will ultimately be sweet or sour.
Before 1987, kiwifruit from California suffered from the lemons  problem.
Maturity levels of the fruit varied across producers. On average, the sugar content at
the time of harvest was below the industry standard, established by kiwifruit from
New Zealand. Given the large number of lemons  among California kiwifruit, gro-
cery stores were not willing to pay as much for California fruit. In other words, the
presence of low-quality (immature) fruit in the mixed market pulled down the price of
California fruit. Mature kiwifruit is more costly to produce than immature fruit, and
the low price decreased the production of mature fruit. This result is similar to the
way low used-car prices decrease the number of high-quality used cars on the market.
In general, adverse selection led to low prices and a relatively large volume of low-
quality kiwifruit from California.
In 1987, California producers implemented a federal marketing order to address
the lemon kiwi problem. The federal order specified a minimum maturity standard,

THE RESALE VALUE OF A WEEK-OLD CAR
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: Why does a new car lose about 20 percent
of its value in the first week?
If you buy a new car for $20,000 today and then try to sell it a week later, you proba-
bly won t get more than $16,000 for it. Even if you drove it just a couple of hundred
miles, cleaned it up, and returned it to the dealer with that new-car smell, the car will
lose about 20 percent of its value in the first week. You won t fare any better by putting
an advertisement in the newspaper or trying to sell the car on eBay. Why does the typ-
ical new car lose so much of its value in the first week?
A potential buyer of a week-old car might believe that a person who returns a car
after only one week could have discovered it was a lemon and may be trying to get rid of
it. Alternatively, the seller could have simply changed his or her mind about the car. The
problem is that buyers don t know why the car is being sold. As long as there is a chance
the car is a lemon, they won t be willing to pay the full as-new price for it. In general,
buyers are willing to pay a lot less for a week-old car, and so the owners of high-quality,
week-old cars are less likely to put them on the market. This downward spiral ultimately
reduces the price of week-old cars by about 20 percent.

BASEBALL PITCHERS ARE LIKE USED CARS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Does the market for baseball pitchers suffer
from the adverse-selection problem?
Professional baseball teams compete with each other for players. After six years of play
in the major leagues, a player has the option of becoming a free agent and offering his
services to the highest bidder. A player is likely to switch teams if the new team offers
him a higher salary than his original team.
One of the puzzling features of the free-agent market is that pitchers who switch
teams are more prone to injuries than pitchers who don t. On average, pitchers who
switch teams spend 28 days per season on the disabled list, compared to only 5 days
for pitchers who do not switch teams. This doesn t mean that all the switching pitch-
ers are lemons; many are injury-free and are valuable additions to their new teams. But
on average, switching pitchers spend five times longer recovering from injuries.
This puzzling feature of the free-agent market for baseball players is explained by
asymmetric information and adverse selection. Because the coaches, physicians, and
trainers from the players original team have interacted with the player on a daily basis
for several years, they know from experience whether he is likely to suffer from injuries
that prevent him from playing. In contrast, the new team has much less information. Its
physicians can examine the pitcher, and the team can check league records to see how
long the pitcher has spent on the disabled list, but these measures do not eliminate the
asymmetric information. The original team has several years of daily experience with
the pitcher and has better information about the pitchers physical health.
Now consider the incentives for a team to outbid another team for a pitcher.
Suppose the market price for pitchers is $1 million per year, and a pitcher who is cur-
rently with the Detroit Tigers is offered this salary by another team. If the Tigers
think the pitcher is likely to spend a lot of time next season recovering from injuries,
they won t try to outbid the other team for the pitcher: They will let the pitcher switch
teams. But if the Tigers think the pitcher will be injury-free and productive, he will be
worth more than $1 million to them, and they will outbid other teams and keep him.
Thats why an injury-prone pitcher is more likely to switch teams. As in the used-car
market, there are many lemons  on the used-pitcher market. The market for baseball
players playing other positions does not suffer from adverse selection, perhaps because
the injuries that affect their performance are easier for other teams to detect.
Although you may think it s bizarre to compare baseball pitchers to used cars,
people in baseball don t think so. They recognize the similarity between the two mar-
kets. Jackie Moore, who managed a free-agent camp where teams looking for players
can see free agents in action, sounded like a used-car salesman: We want to get play-
ers off the lot. We want to cut a deal. How many camps can you go into where you can
look at a player and take him home with you?

and as the average quality of California fruit increased, so did the price. Within a few

UNINFORMED SELLERS AND
KNOWLEDGEABLE BUYERS: INSURANCE
So far, we have explored the effects of asymmetric information when sellers are more
knowledgeable than buyers. The same sort of problems occur when buyers are more
knowledgeable than sellers. The best example of superior knowledge on the demand
side of the market is insurance. A person who buys an insurance policy knows much
more about his or her risks and needs for insurance than the insurance company
knows. For example, when you buy an auto insurance policy, you know more than
your insurance company about your driving habits and your chances of getting into an
accident. We ll see that insurance markets suffer from the adverse-selection problem:
Insurance companies must pick from an adverse or undesirable selection of customers.
Health Insurance
To illustrate the information problems in the market for insurance, consider health
insurance provided to individual consumers. Suppose there are two types of con-
sumers: low-cost consumers with relatively low medical expenses of $2,000 per year
and high-cost consumers with relatively high medical expenses of $6,000 per year.
The amount a consumer is willing to pay for an insurance policy covering all medical
expenses increases with the anticipated medical expenses, so high-cost people are will-
ing to pay more for health insurance.
The insurance company cannot distinguish between high-cost and low-cost peo-
ple, but it still must pick a price for its coverage. To simplify matters, let s assume there
are no administrative costs, so the only cost for the insurance company is the medical
bills it pays for its customers. Let s also assume the insurance company sets the price
equal to its average cost per customer, equal to the total medical bills paid by the
insurance company divided by the number of customers. These assumptions simplify
the math without affecting the basic results.
What is the insurance company s average cost per customer? To determine the
average cost in a mixed market, we must answer three questions:
What is the cost of providing medical care to a high-cost person?
What is the cost of providing medical care to a low-cost person?
What fraction of the customers are low-cost people?
Suppose that half the population is high cost and the other half is low cost. Let s
assume the insurance company is somewhat naive and initially assumes that the mix of
insurance buyers will be the same as the population mix. In other words, the insurance
company initially assumes that half its customers will be high cost and half will be low
cost. In this case, the average cost per customer is $4,000, that is, the average of $2,000
for each low-cost customer and $6,000 for each high-cost customer.
There is asymmetric information in the insurance market because potential buyers
know from everyday experience and family histories what type of customer they are,
either low cost or high cost. For each person, the question is Given the single market
price for all insurance, for low-cost and high-cost people alike, should I buy insur-
ance?  The answers to this question are shown in two demand curves in Figure 29.3.
The demand curve for the high-cost people is higher than the curve for the low-cost
people, reflecting their larger benefits from having medical insurance.
Equilibrium with All High-Cost Consumers
Table 29.3 shows two scenarios for our hypothetical insurance market, with numbers
based on the demand curves shown in Figure 29.3. In the first column, firms initially
assume a 50 50 mix of customers. As we saw earlier, if sellers expect a 50 50 split
29.4

between the two types, the average cost per customer is $4,000, and thats the price
they charge for medical insurance. From the demand curves in Figure 29.3, we know
that at this price 25 low-cost people will buy insurance (point a), along with 75 high-
cost people (point b). In this case, insurance companies are too optimistic and under-
estimate the fraction of customers with large medical bills. The actual fraction of
high-cost customers is 75 percent, and the actual average cost is $5,000 (equal to 0.25
times $2,000, plus 0.75 times $6,000). The companys average cost of $5,000 exceeds
its price of $4,000, so the firm will lose money.
Suppose that after observing the outcome in the first column, insurance compa-
nies become very pessimistic. They assume that all their customers will be high-cost
people. Under this assumption, the average cost per customer is $6,000, the average
cost per high-cost customer, and thats the pessimistic price. As shown in Figure 29.3,
this price exceeds the maximum that low-cost people are willing to pay for insurance
($5,200), so none of the low-cost consumers will buy insurance at this price. But a
total of 40 high-cost consumers will buy insurance at this price (point c). In other
words, all the customers will be high-cost people, so the companys pessimism is justi-
fied. The price chosen by the insurance company equals the actual average cost of
providing service, so the equilibrium is shown by point c, with an equilibrium price of
$6,000. This equilibrium is shown in the second column of Table 29.3.
The domination of the insurance market by high-cost people is another example of
the adverse-selection problem. The uninformed side of the market (sellers in this case)
must choose from an undesirable or adverse selection of consumers. The asymmetric
information in the market generates an upward spiral of price and average cost of service:
The presence of high-cost consumers in the market pulls up the average cost of
service, pulling up the price.

All Insurance Customers Are High-Cost People
If insurance companies assume there will be a 50 50 split between high-cost and low-cost cus-
tomers, the average cost of insurance and its price is $4,000. At this price, there are 25 low-cost cus-
tomers (point a) and 75 high-cost customers (point b). This is not an equilibrium, because 75 percent
of insurance buyers are high-cost customers, contrary to the expectations of a 50 50 split. If insur-
ance companies become pessimistic and assume that all buyers will be high-cost consumers, the
average cost and price is $6,000. The insurance company s expectations are realized, so the equilib-
rium is shown by point c.

The increase in price decreases the number of low-cost consumers who pur-
chase insurance.
This decrease in the number of low-cost consumers pulls up the average cost
of insurance.
In the extreme case, the upward spiral continues until all insurance customers
are high-cost people.
Our example of health insurance indicates that only high-cost people buy insur-
ance. A more realistic outcome is a thin market, with a relatively small number of low-
cost people buying insurance. The adverse-selection problem could be less severe, but
it will still be present as long as insurance companies cannot distinguish perfectly
between low-cost and high-cost people.
Responding to Adverse Selection in Insurance: Group Insurance
Insurance companies use group insurance plans to diminish the adverse-selection prob-
lem. By enrolling all the employees of an organization in one or two insurance plans,
they ensure that all workers, not just high-cost people, join the pool of consumers.
In our example, group insurance would generate a 50 50 mix of low-cost and
high-cost customers, and the break-even price would be $6,000. In contrast, when a
firm sells insurance to individuals, the low-cost people have an incentive to go without
insurance, leading to the adverse-selection problem and higher prices.
Most insurance companies use experience rating to set their prices for group
insurance. They charge different prices to different firms, depending on the past med-
ical bills of the firms employees. A firm whose employees have low medical bills pays
a low price for its employees  health insurance. Experience rating gives firms an incen-
tive to decrease the health costs of their workers by investing in safety and health pro-
grams for them. Firms also have an incentive to avoid hiring applicants with health
problems. Under experience rating, a firm that hires a worker with above-average
medical costs will ultimately pay a higher price for its group insurance.
The Uninsured
One implication of asymmetric information in the insurance market is that many low-
cost consumers who are not eligible for a group plan will not carry insurance. Given
the adverse-selection problem, the price for an individual insurance plan is relatively
high, and many consumers go without insurance. This is a contributing factor to the
problem of the uninsured. In 2008, about 47 million people (about 14 percent of the

U.S. population) were not covered by health insurance. About 70 percent of working-
age people have private insurance, and another 10 percent have some sort of govern-
ment insurance, leaving 20 percent without health insurance. In general, the
uninsured are the people and their families who do not receive insurance through
their employers, are unemployed or between jobs, or are poor but do not qualify for
Medicaid. The uninsured obtain care for medical emergencies but typically do not
receive routine
and ultimately less costly
preventive care.
In 2010 the U.S. Congress approved legislation to regulate the nation s health
insurance markets and reduce the number of uninsured people. The new law will pre-
vent insurance companies from denying coverage based on preexisting conditions and
outlaws lifetime caps on reimbursement. In addition, the law requires individuals to get
health insurance, and imposes penalties on people who remain uncovered. Other pro-
visions impose penalties on employers that do not provide insurance to their employ-
ees. For small businesses and low-income individuals, the law provides subsidies and
tax credits to partly offset the cost of insurance. The law is expected to significantly
reduce the number of uninsured citizens.
Other Types of Insurance
The same logic of adverse selection applies to the markets for other types of insur-
ance, including life insurance, home insurance for theft and property damage, and
automobile insurance. Buyers know more than sellers about their risks, so there is
adverse selection, with high-risk individuals more likely to buy insurance. Life insur-
ance companies provide group coverage to get a broader base of consumers and also
try to distinguish between high-risk and low-risk people with physical exams.
However, because the companies are unable to distinguish between high-risk and low-
risk people with sufficient precision, the adverse-selection problem persists.
INSURANCE AND MORAL HAZARD
Does insurance affect people s risk-taking behavior? The answer is yes. Insurance
causes people to take greater risks because they know part of the cost of an undesirable
outcome will be borne by their insurance companies. Here are some examples of peo-
ple taking greater risks because they have insurance:
Will Irma buy a fire extinguisher for her kitchen? If she had to pay for any prop-
erty damage caused by a fire, she would definitely buy a fire extinguisher. But
because her homeowner s insurance covers property damage from fires, she
doesn t buy a fire extinguisher.
Will Harry drive his car carefully? If he had to pay for all repairs resulting from
a collision out of his own pocket, he would drive very carefully. But because his
auto insurance covers some of the repair costs, he drives fast and recklessly.
Will Flo fly on a commercial airline or hitch a ride with her pilot friend in a
four-seat airplane? Traveling in small airplanes is much riskier. If Flo dies in an
airplane crash, her family will lose the income she would otherwise earn. If she
didn t have life insurance to offset these income losses, she would be less likely
to risk harming her family by flying on the small plane instead of the commer-
cial airline. But because she knows her family will collect $1 million in life
insurance, she is willing to take the risk.
The risky behavior triggered by insurance is an example of the moral-hazard
problem. Moral hazard occurs when one side of an economic relationship takes
undesirable or costly actions that the other side of the relationship cannot observe.
For example, Irma s insurance company doesn t know whether she has a fire extin-
guisher. If there is a fire, Irma s hidden action
going without an extinguisher
is
29.5

630
costly for the insurance company. Similarly, Harry s insurance company doesn t
know how fast and recklessly he drives, and insurance encourages him to drive reck-
lessly. His hidden action of reckless driving increases the likelihood of a costly acci-
dent. Just as collision insurance encourages risky driving, life insurance encourages
risky activities such as flying small airplanes, parachuting, and bungee jumping.
Similarly, health insurance encourages risky behavior such as smoking, drinking,
and unhealthy diets.
Insurance Companies and Moral Hazard
Insurance companies use various measures to decrease the moral-hazard problem.
Many insurance policies have a deductible
a dollar amount that a policy holder must
pay before getting compensation from the insurance company. For example, if your car
insurance policy has a $500 deductible and the damage from a collision is $900, the
insurance company will pay you only $400. You pay the other $500 as your deductible.
Deductibles reduce the moral-hazard problem because they shift to the policy holder
part of the cost of a claim on the policy. Like a deductible, an insurance copayment
shifts part of the cost of risky behavior to policy holders and thus reduces the moral-
hazard problem.
Savvy insurance companies anticipate moral hazard. To illustrate, suppose 1 of
10 bicycles on your campus was stolen in 2008. If you decide to be the first to offer
bicycle theft insurance, you might naively assume that the theft rate wouldn t change.
But the moral-hazard problem tells us that people with insurance take greater risks,
so we d expect a higher theft rate on a campus where insurance is widespread.
Students who buy theft insurance are likely to be less careful in protecting their
bikes, perhaps using flimsy locks or no locks at all. Or they might start leaving their
bikes on campus overnight. A savvy insurance company would assume a theft rate
higher than 10 percent and set its price accordingly.
Deposit Insurance for Savings and Loans
For another example of moral hazard, consider the insurance provided for bank
deposits. When you deposit money in a Savings and Loan (S&L), the money doesn t
just sit in a vault. The S&L will invest the money, loaning it out and expecting to
make a profit when loans are repaid with interest. Unfortunately, some loans are
not repaid, and the S&L could lose money and be unable to return your money.
To protect people who put their money in S&Ls and other banks, the Federal
Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC) insures the first $100,000 of your deposit,
so if the S&L goes bankrupt, you ll still get your money back. The government
enacted the federal deposit insurance law in 1933 in response to the bank failures
of the Great Depression.
How does deposit insurance affect you and the people who manage the S&L? If
you know you ll get your money back no matter what happens to the S&L, you may
deposit your money there without evaluating the performance of the S&L and the risk-
iness of its loans to borrowers and investments in the stock market. The manager of an
S&L will also be more likely to make risky investments knowing that if it doesn t pay
off and the S&L goes bankrupt, the federal government will reimburse depositors.
Recognizing this moral hazard problem, the federal government has historically lim-
ited S&Ls to relatively safe investments.
In the 1980s, the federal government loosened some of the investment restric-
tions on S&Ls, and S&L managers began investing in volatile securities, including
high-risk commercial mortgages and junk bonds. When these risky investments
failed, many of the S&Ls went into bankruptcy. The government then bailed out the
failed S&Ls, at a total cost to taxpayers of about $200 billion.

CROP INSURANCE AND ADVERSE SELECTION
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #5: Who buys insurance?
Farmers can buy crop insurance to cover their losses in the event of a small yield or low
crop prices. If the total revenue from the crop drops below some target level, a payment
from the insurance company covers at least part of the revenue shortfall. Farmers differ in
the variability of their crop revenue from year to year, with high-risk farmers experiencing
large fluctuations and low-risk farmers experiencing small fluctuations. The theory of
adverse selection suggests that a high-risk farmer is more likely to buy crop insurance, and
thats what happens: The farmers subject to large fluctuations in yields and prices buy
insurance in greater numbers and also purchase policies with relatively generous coverage.
The market for crop insurance is a bit different from other insurance markets because
of the involvement of the national government. The government subsidizes the purchase
of crop insurance, and also limits the ability of the insurance companies to vary the price of
crop insurance across farmers with different levels of risk.

WHY IS CAR INSURANCE SO EXPENSIVE IN PHILADELPHIA?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: How does adverse selection affect the price
of insurance?
The price of car insurance in Philadelphia is twice as high as in Pittsburgh, even
though Pittsburgh has a much higher auto-theft rate. Why? In brief, uninsured driv-
ers cause high prices, and high prices cause uninsured drivers.
The higher price in Philadelphia is a result of an upward spiral in insurance prices
caused by uninsured drivers. If two drivers, one insured and the other not, collide, the
insurance company of the insured driver covers the cost of the collision, even if the
insured driver isn t at fault. In other words, the presence of uninsured drivers increases
the cost to the insurance company. The company will pass on these costs to customers
in the form of higher prices. Higher prices encourage more drivers to go without
insurance, leading to higher costs, even higher prices, and even more uninsured driv-
ers. For cities that get into this upward price spiral, insurance prices will be relatively
high. This happens in San Francisco, with prices higher than nearby San Jose; in
Miami, with prices higher than Jacksonville; and in St. Louis, with prices higher than
Kansas City.

THE ECONOMICS OF CONSUMER SEARCH
Suppose the price of a particular television model varies from one store to another. If
you don t know which store has the lowest price, should you keep shopping until you
find it? The short answer is No.  Searching is costly because it takes time to visit a
store, make a phone call, or visit a Web site. We can apply the marginal principle to
the problem of searching for low prices. It will be sensible to continue searching if the
marginal benefit of search (the expected savings from finding a lower price) exceeds
the marginal cost (the time cost). In most cases, it will be rational to stop shopping
before you find the lowest possible price.
Search and the Marginal Principle
We can illustrate the economics of search with a simple example. Suppose the price
of a television ranges from $100 at the lowest price store to $180 at the highest
price store. In addition, suppose that for a randomly selected store, any price from
the low price to the high price is equally likely. Let s assume that the opportunity
cost of the time required to visit a store
the marginal cost of search
is constant
at $0.90 per visit.
The marginal benefit of search depends on your discovered price
the lowest
price you have found so far in your search. The first column in Table 29.4 shows how
to compute the marginal benefit of another visit when the discovered price is $140. A
price of $140 is at the 50th percentile of the price range of the television (from $100 to
$180). In other words, half the stores have lower prices (from $100 to $139), and half
have higher prices (from $141 to $180). We compute the marginal benefit of an addi-
tional visit as follows:
Row 2: If you visit one more store, the probability of finding a lower price is
0.50. You have a 50 50 chance of finding a lower price.

CAR INSURANCE AND RISKY DRIVING
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #6: How does car insurance affect driving behavior?
The theory of moral hazard suggests that an insured driver, who bears less than the
full cost of a collision, will drive less carefully than an uninsured driver. A recent
study suggests that the moral-hazard cost of automobile insurance is substantial.
When a state makes car insurance compulsory and thus decreases the number of
uninsured drivers, roads become more hazardous: The number of collisions and
the number of traffic deaths increase. Roads become more dangerous because the
newly insured drivers drive less cautiously. The study estimates that a one percent-
age point decrease in the number of uninsured drivers increases the number of traf-
fic fatalities by 2 percent. Of course, there are benefits associated with compulsory
insurance, but in the interests of efficiency, we must compare the benefits to the
costs, including the increase in fatalities on more hazardous roads.

Row 3: If you actually find a lower price, it will be between the low price of $100
and your discovered price of $140. The best guess for a lower price is the mid-
point of this range, or $120.
Row 4: The best guess for the savings from a lower price is the gap between the
discovered price ($140) and the lower price ($120), or $20.
Row 5: The probability of finding a lower price is 0.50, so your expected savings
from visiting another store is $10 (equal to the anticipated $20 price gap times
0.50). You have a 50 50 chance of saving $20, so on average a visit to another
store will generate a $10 savings.
To summarize, the marginal benefit of search is $10, which exceeds the $0.90 marginal
cost. Therefore, if your discovered price is $140, it is sensible to visit one more store.
As shown in the second column of Table 29.4, if the discovered price is $120,
the marginal benefit of another visit is only $2.50. This is lower than the marginal
benefit shown in column 1 (discovered price = $140) for two reasons. First, a discov-
ered price of $120 is in the 25th percentile of the price range of $100 to $180 (only
one-fourth of stores have lower prices), so the probability of finding a lower price is
only 0.25. Second, if you actually find a lower price, the savings will be smaller
because you start with a lower discovered price. A lower price will be between $100
and $120, so your best guess of a lower price is $110 (the middle of the range) and
your best guess of the savings from a lower price is only $10 (equal to $120  $110).
Multiplying the probability of finding a lower price (0.25) by the $10 price gap, the
expected savings is $2.50. This marginal benefit still exceeds the $0.90 marginal
cost, so it is sensible to visit an additional store to try to improve on your discovered
price of $120.
As shown in the third column of Table 29.4, if the discovered price is only $110,
visiting an additional store is not sensible. In this case, only one in eight stores have
lower prices, meaning that the probability of finding a lower price at the store you
visit is only 0.125. In addition, your best guess of a lower price is $105 (the middle of
the range from $100 to $110), and your savings from a lower price is only $5. The
expected savings from an additional visit is only $0.625 (equal to 0.125 times $5),
which is less than the $0.90 marginal cost. In this case, the cost of an additional visit
exceeds the expected benefit, so it is best to pay your discovered price of $110 rather
than continuing to search for a lower price.
Figure 29.4 illustrates the application of the marginal principle to the search
process. The horizontal axis shows the discovered price, and the vertical axis
shows the marginal benefit and marginal cost. As we saw in Table 29.4, the higher
the discovered price, the larger the marginal benefit of additional search, so the
marginal-benefit curve is positively sloped. For example, the marginal benefit is
$2.50 for a discovered price of $120 (point b), compared to $10 for a discovered
price of $140 (point a). If the marginal cost is constant at $0.90 per visit (per unit
of search), the marginal-cost curve is horizontal. If the discovered price is less
than $112 (for example $110), the marginal benefit is less than the marginal cost,
and it is not sensible to search for a lower price.

CHAPTER 29
IMPERFECT INFORMATION: ADVERSE SELECTION AND MORAL HAZARD

Reservation Prices and Searching Strategy
A consumer s reservation price is defined as the discovered price at which the
consumer is indifferent about additional search. If the discovered price exceeds
the reservation price, additional searching is sensible, but if the discovered price is
lower, additional searching is irrational. In Table 29.4, the reservation price is
computed as $112.
The probability of finding a lower price is 0.15 (a price of $112 is in the 15th
percentile of the price range $100 to $180).
The best guess of a lower price is $106 (the midpoint of the range $100 to $112).
The marginal benefit (the expected savings over the discovered price) is $0.90,
equal to 0.15 times $6.
The marginal benefit equals the marginal cost, so the consumer is indifferent about
additional search. In Figure 29.4 the reservation price is shown by the intersection of
the marginal-cost curve and the marginal-benefit curve at point c.
The reservation price provides consumers with a convenient rule for when to stop
searching for a lower price. The consumer should continue to search until the discov-
ered price (the lowest price found) is less than or equal to the reservation price. Some
consumers will get lucky and discover a price below their reservation prices with just a
reservation price
The price at which a consumer is

Marginal Benefit and Marginal Cost of Search
The marginal benefit of search increases with the discovered price (the lowest price found so far),
while the marginal cost of search is constant. If at a particular discovered price the marginal benefit
exceeds the marginal cost, it is sensible to continue searching for a low price. The reservation price,
defined as the price where the marginal benefit of search equals the marginal cost, is $112 (shown
by point c).

Price Sequences and the Reservation Price
Each sequence (indicated by dots in #1 or triangles in #2) shows prices observed on visits to different
stores. The lines connect the discovered prices (lowest price so far). A rational consumer stops shop-
ping for lower prices when the discovered price is less than or equal to the reservation price ($112).
little bit of searching, while others will take longer. But a consumer who knows the
range of prices from lowest to highest can compute a reservation price before starting
the search, and then search until the discovered price is less than or equal to the reser-
vation price.
Figure 29.5 provides two examples of price searches that stop when the discov-
ered price drops below the reservation price. The dots show one sequence of
observed prices, starting at $174, followed by $175, then $165, and so on to $110
after 10 visits. The solid line connects the discovered prices
the lowest price
observed over the course of the search. The dots above the line are the observed
prices that, at the time they were observed, exceeded the discovered price. The dis-
covered price finally drops below the reservation price in the 10th visit. The triangles
show a second sequence of observed prices, starting with $151, followed by $152,
then $162, then $130, and finally $107. The second (diamond) sequence is half as
long as the first because the discovered price drops below the reservation price in the
fifth visit.
The Effects of Opportunity Cost and Product Prices on Search Effort
Reservation prices and search efforts vary across consumers. A consumer with a rela-
tively high opportunity cost of search time will have a higher marginal cost of search
and will naturally spend less time searching for lower prices. In Figure 29.4 an

increase in the marginal cost of search will shift the marginal-cost curve upward,
increasing the reservation price. For example, if the cost per visit were $2.50 instead of
$0.90, the reservation price would be $120 rather than $112. The higher the reserva-
tion price, the less time it will take, on average, to discover a price below the reserva-
tion price. Therefore, a consumer with a high opportunity cost of search won t spend
as much time searching for low prices.
The amount of searching for low prices also depends on the price of the product.
The higher the price, the bigger the payoff from discovering a price that is, say, 2 per-
cent lower. For example, if an additional visit to a car dealer could save you 2 percent
on a $10,000 car ($200), an additional visit will be sensible if your opportunity cost is
less than $200. In contrast, if additional searching might save you 2 percent on a $10
pizza ($0.20), it is not sensible to continue searching unless your opportunity cost is
less than $0.20. In general, the higher the price of a product, the greater the incentive
to search for a lower price.
The amount of searching also depends on the range of prices, from lowest to
highest. The smaller the gap between the low and high price, the smaller the possible
savings from additional search. In our example, suppose the price range for the televi-
sion is only $139 to $141, and suppose your discovered price is $140 (the average
price). As before, there is a 50 50 chance that an additional visit will generate a lower
price. But at most you ll save only $1, and your best guess for a lower price is $39.50
(the middle of the range $139 to $140). Given the relatively small anticipated savings,
additional search will be rational only if your marginal cost is very low ($0.25). In gen-
eral, the smaller the price range for a product, the less time consumers will spend
searching for lower prices.
In this chapter, we ve seen what
happens when one of the
assumptions underlying most
supply and demand analysis
that people make informed
decisions
is violated. If either buyers or sellers don t have reli-
able information about a particular good or service, the market
will suffer from the adverse-selection problem. The uninformed
side picks from an adverse selection of goods or customers.
Here are the main points of the chapter:
1 The adverse-selection problem occurs when one side of the
market cannot distinguish between high-quality and low-
quality goods. The presence of low-quality goods pulls down
the price that buyers are willing to pay, which decreases the
quantity of high-quality goods supplied, which further
decreases the average quality and the price. In the extreme
case, only low-quality goods are sold.
2 A thin market occurs when the sellers of high-quality goods
have a relatively low minimum supply price, so some high-
quality goods are sold.
3 In a market subject to asymmetric information, buyers
have an incentive to invest in information to help make
better choices and sellers have an incentive to provide
quality guarantees.
4 Insurance markets suffer from adverse selection because
compared to insurance sellers, buyers have better informa-
tion about the risks they face.
5 Insurance encourages risky behavior because part of the
cost of an unfavorable outcome will be paid by an insur-
ance company.
6 Searching for low prices is costly, and a rational consumer is
likely to stop searching for low prices before finding the low-
est possible price.

The Lemons Problem
1.1
There is asymmetric information in the used-car mar-
ket because 
(buyers/sellers) cannot dis-
tinguish between lemons and plums but 
(buyers/sellers) can.
1.2
The supply curve for high-quality used cars lies
(above/below) the supply curve for low-
quality used cars.
1.3
The following table shows the prices and quantities in
three different used-car markets. Complete the table
by filling in the last two rows.
29.1
a. Illustrate with a complete graph for each market.
b. What is the fundamental difference between the
two markets?
1.8
Fashion and Prices. You are in the market for a used
car and have narrowed your options to two types of
cars, type F and type P. According to Consumer Reports,
the two types of cars have roughly the same frequency
of lemons (50 percent). Like other consumers, you are
willing to pay $1,000 for a lemon and $7,000 for a
plum. The people who buy new F cars are fashion-
conscious and purchase a new car every three years.
The people who buy new P cars are insensitive to the
whims of fashion. Predict the equilibrium prices of the
two types of cars and defend your answer with two
graphs, one for each type of car.
1.9
Double Ignorance. Suppose both buyers and sellers
of used cars are ignorant: No one can distinguish
between lemons and plums. Would you expect the
market to be dominated by lemons? Illustrate with a
completely labeled graph.
1.10 Groucho Club. Consider a classic quip from
Groucho Marx: I won t join any club that is willing to
accept me as a member.  Suppose Groucho wants to
associate with high-income people (the higher the
income the better) and everyone else has the same
preferences as Groucho.
a. Use the notion of adverse selection to explain
this quip.
b. Relate the quip to the adverse-selection problem.
1.11 Purchasing a Fleet of Used Cars. You are respon-
sible for buying a fleet of 10 used cars for your
employees and must pick either brand B or brand C.
For your purposes, the two brands are identical
except for one difference: Based on your experience
with the two brands, you figure that 50 percent of B
cars in the market are lemons and only 20 percent of
C cars in the market are lemons. You are willing to
pay $1,000 for a known lemon and $3,000 for a
known plum. If the price of B cars is $1,800 and the
price of C cars is $2,200, which brand of car should
you pick?
1.12 Adverse Selection of MP3 Players. Consider the
market for used MP3 players, with knowledgeable
sellers and ignorant buyers. Half the MP3 players in
existence are plums and half are lemons. Each buyer is
willing to pay $50 for a plum or $20 for a lemon. The
minimum supply price for a plum is $10 and the mini-
mum supply price for a lemon is $2.
a. In equilibrium, will the market be thin  or will
all the used MP3 players in the market be

We will have a thin market for used cars if the mini-
mum supply price for plums (high quality) is
(greater than/less than) the willingness
to pay for a lemon.
1.5
Arrows up or down: A decrease in the minimum sup-
ply price for a plum (high quality) shifts the plum sup-
ply curve 
and the likelihood of buying a
plum

1.6
Suppose you are willing to pay $1,000 for a low-quality
used car and $5,000 for a high-quality used car. If there
is an 80 percent chance of getting a low-quality car and
a 20 percent chance of getting a high-quality car, you
are willing to pay $
for a used car.
1.7
Consumer Reports. You want to buy a used car,
specifically a 1999 Zephyr. According to Consumer
Reports, half the 1999 Zephyrs now on the road are
lemons, meaning they break down frequently and
generate large repair bills. Consumers are willing to
pay $2,000 for a lemon, but $5,000 for a plum.
According to Ms. Wizard, The equilibrium price of
used 1999 Zephyrs will be $2,000 in Sourland but
$2,600 in Sweetland.

lemons? Explain and illustrate your answer with a
complete graph.
b. Suppose that at a price of $26, the quantity of
plums is 20 and the quantity of lemons is 80. Is this
an equilibrium? Explain and illustrate your answer
with a complete graph.
Responding to the Lemons Problem
2.1
Consider a thin used-car market. Someone just devel-
oped a device that can instantly identify the nearest
plum in a used-car lot. The device works only once.
The maximum amount that a consumer would be will-
ing to pay for the device equals 
minus
.
2.2
A money-back guarantee will be provided by the own-
ers of 
, but not by the owners of
(lemons/plums).
2.3
Paying for Information. You are willing to pay
$7,000 for a high-quality car
a plum. The current
price of used cars is $4,000, and 4 of 5 cars in the mar-
ket are lemons, meaning that 1 in 5 is a plum.
a. Suppose you could pay a finder s fee to a personal
shopper/mechanic who will find you a plum at a
price of $4,000. What is the maximum you are
willing to pay as a finder s fee?
b. As you shop for a used car, you will bring each car
you consider to your mechanic, who will
thoroughly inspect the car and tell you for certain
whether it is a plum or a lemon. If the price per
inspection is $400, is it worth the money?
c. How would your answer to part (b) change if only
1 out of 10 used cars was a plum?
2.4
Money-Back-Plus Guarantee. The equilibrium
price in the thin market is $2,600. Suppose car sell-
ers provide a special money-back-plus guarantee:
A dissatisfied buyer can return a car for a refund
plus $100.
a. If a lemon owner sells his or her car for $5,000, the
owner s gain from providing the guarantee is
$
.
b. If a plum owner sells his or her car for $5,000, the
owner s gain from providing the guarantee is
$
.
Applications of the Lemons Model

3.4
Your favorite baseball team just announced that it
signed a new pitcher from the free-agent market. We
expect the new pitcher to be injured 
(more/less) often than free-agent pitchers who
returned to their old teams. (Related to Application 3
on page 625.)
3.5
Mix of Lemons and Plums in the Week-Old Car
Market. Recall the application The Resale Value of a
Week-Old Car.  Suppose the value of a high-quality
week-old car (a plum) is $20,000 (the same as the pur-
chase price of a new car), while the value of a low-
quality week-old car (a lemon) is $10,000. Suppose
that at a price of $16,000 per car, 6 of 10 cars on the
used market are plums and 4 of 10 are lemons.
(Related to Application 1 on page 624.)
a. How much is the typical buyer willing to pay for a
used car in the mixed market?
b. Is the $16,000 price an equilibrium price? Why or
why not?
c. Suppose that for every 10 new cars sold by new-car
dealers, 9 are plums and only 1 is a lemon. Why is
the equilibrium mix in the used car market different
from the mix of new cars sold?
3.6
Equilibrium in the Kiwifruit Market. Consumers
are willing to pay 10 cents for a sour kiwifruit and
30 cents for a sweet kiwifruit. The minimum supply
price for sour kiwifruit is 6 cents and the minimum
supply price for sweet kiwifruit is 18 cents. The slope
of each supply curve is 1 cent per thousand kiwifruit.
(Related to Application 2 on page 624.)
a. Suppose consumers initially expect a 50 50 mix of
sweet and sour kiwifruits. Is this an equilibrium?
Illustrate with a graph.
b. Suppose consumers are pessimistic, expecting all
sour kiwifruit. Is this an equilibrium? Illustrate with
a graph. What is the price of kiwifruit?
c. Suppose the state outlaws sour kiwifruit, and they
disappear from the market. What happens to the
equilibrium price of kiwifruit? What is the
equilibrium quantity of sweet kiwifruit?
3.7
Willingness to Pay for Used Baseball Pitchers.
Suppose a healthy baseball pitcher is worth $5 million
per year to his team, compared to only $1 million per
year for an unhealthy pitcher. Suppose that half the
638

pitchers in the league are healthy, and half are
unhealthy. According to an executive of a baseball
team, If my assumptions are correct, our team is
willing to pay a maximum of $3 million for a pitcher
in the free-agent market.  (Related to Application 3
on page 625.)
a. What are the executives assumptions?
b. Are these assumptions realistic?
Uninformed Sellers and Knowledgeable
Buyers: Insurance
4.1
Suppose the average annual malpractice cost is
$40,000 for reckless doctors and $2,000 for careful
doctors. If half of an insurance companys insured doc-
tors are reckless, the company will earn zero economic
profit if the price of insurance is $ 
. If
careful doctors are not willing to pay any more than
$5,000 for insurance, the price required for zero eco-
nomic profit is $

Genetic Testing and Insurance Prices. Suppose the
likelihood that a person will get disease X is deter-
mined in large part (but not exclusively) by his or her
genes. Initially, it is impossible to determine who car-
ries the gene for the disease, and many people spend
$500 on special health insurance to cover the costs of
treatment for the disease. Suppose scientists uncover
the gene responsible for the disease and develop a sim-
ple test for the gene.
a. Suppose the government passes a law that prevents
insurance companies from getting the results of a
customers genetic test for X. Will the new price of
X insurance be greater than or less than $500?
b. Suppose insurance companies have access to the
results of genetic tests and they require all
customers to get the test. How will the insurance
company change its price of X insurance?
4.4
Rising Insurance Rates. Consider an insurance com-
pany that provides group medical coverage for univer-
sity employees. The company discovered that some of
its younger employees had switched to other insur-
ance companies. The company responded to the loss
of customers by increasing its price. This is puzzling
because you might think the insurance company
would drop its price to prevent other employees from
switching to other companies.
a. What is the rationale for increasing the price?
29.4
b. If you change one word in the second sentence, it
would be logical for the insurance company to
decrease rather than increase its price. What is the
word, and why is it decisive?
4.5
State Auto Insurance Pool. Consider a state in
which automobile drivers are divided equally into two
types of drivers: careful and reckless. The average
annual auto insurance claim is $400 for a careful driver
and $1,200 for a reckless driver. Suppose the state
adopts an insurance system in which all drivers are
placed in a common pool and allocated to insurance
companies randomly. An insurance company cannot
refuse coverage to any driver it is assigned, but a driver
who is unhappy with the insurance company has the
option of being randomly reassigned to another insur-
ance company. By law, each insurance company must
charge the same price to all its customers. Predict the
price of auto insurance under the two alternative pol-
icy scenarios:
a. Under Policy M, auto insurance is mandatory.
b. Under Policy V, auto insurance is voluntary.

5.5
Selling iPod Insurance. On the campus of Klepto
College, half the iPods are expensive (replacement
value is $400) and half are cheap (replacement value
is $100). There is a 20 percent chance that any par-
ticular iPod
expensive or cheap
will be stolen in
the next year. Suppose a firm offers iPod-theft insur-
ance for $50 per year: The firm will replace any
insured iPod that is stolen. Suppose the firm sells
20 insurance policies.
a. Assume for the moment that the theft rate remains
at 20 percent for both types of iPods. The firm s
total revenue equals 
. The firm s
cost
the money paid out to replace stolen iPods
will be $

and $ 
to replace cheap iPods, for a
total of $ 
. The insurance firm will
make zero economic profit with a price of 
$ 
.
b. Is it realistic to assume that the introduction of
insurance will not affect the theft rate? Which is a
more plausible assumption, that the theft rate
will decrease to 10 percent or that it will increase
to 30 percent? For the more plausible theft rate,
compute the zero-profit insurance price when
insurance is purchased exclusively by the owners of
expensive iPods.

Skydiver Question. Several of your friends have
offered to take you on a tandem skydiving adventure:
Strapped together with a single set of parachutes
(main and emergency), you will all jump out of an air-
plane and then either float to earth or crash. All your
skydiving friends are equally skillful, and none of them
has the thrill-seeker gene. You can ask each of them a
single question.
a. Whats your question?
b. Provide the answer you re looking for in a
skydiving mate.
5.7
Insurance and Fire Prevention. In a given year,
there is a 10 percent chance that a fire in Ira s ware-
house will cause $100,000 in property damage. If Ira
spends $4,000 on a fire-prevention program, the
probability of a fire would drop to zero.
a. If Ira doesn t have fire insurance, will he spend the
money on the prevention program?
b. If Ira has an insurance policy that covers 80 percent
of the property damage from a fire (covering
$80,000 of the $100,000 worth of damage), will he
spend the money on the prevention program?

is linear and negatively sloped, with a slope of
$10 per customer. At the initial price of $1,500, half
the city s drivers (50 drivers) buy insurance. The

page 631.)

Safety Rebate from the Insurance Company. In 2010

policy holder a 5 percent rebate on his or her insurance
premium in any year in which the driver does not file an

annual premium of $1,200 will get a $60 rebate check
each year it does not file a claim. Explain the rationale
for the rebate policy. What problem is the policy trying
to solve? (Related to Application 6 on page 632.)

Rolling for Lemons
In this experiment, students play the role of consumers pur-
chasing used cars. Over half the used cars on the road (57%)
are plums, and the remaining cars (43%) are lemons. Each
consumer offers a price for a used car and then rolls a pair of
dice to find out whether he or she gets a lemon or a plum. In
general, rolling a big number is good news: To get a plum,
you need to roll a big number. The higher the price you
offer, the smaller the number you must roll to get a plum.
Here is how the experiment works:
Each consumer tells the instructor how much he or she is
offering for a used car and then rolls the dice.
The instructor tells the consumer whether the number
rolled is large enough to get a plum. If the number is not
large enough, the consumer gets a lemon.
The consumers  scores equal the difference between the
maximum amount they are willing to pay for the type of
car they got ($1,200 for a plum and $400 for a lemon) and
the price they actually paid. For example, if Otto offers
$500 and gets a plum, his score is $700. If Carla offers
$600 and gets a lemon, her score is $200.
The instructor announces the result of each transaction
to the class.
There are three to five buying periods. At the end of the
last trading period, each consumer adds up his or her score.

Bike Insurance
This experiment shows the effect of asymmetric informa-
tion on the market for bicycle insurance. Consider a city
with two types of bike owners: Some face a relatively high
probability of bike theft, and others face a relatively low
probability of bike theft. Bike owners know from experience
whether they face a high probability or a low probability of
theft, but the insurance company cannot distinguish
between the two types of owners. For the city as a whole,
20 percent of bicycles are stolen every year. Here is how the
experiment works:
The class is divided into small groups. Each group repre-
sents an insurance company that must pick a price at
which to offer bike-theft insurance. The insurance com-
pany must pay $100 for each insured bike that is stolen.
The instructor has a table that shows for each price of
bike insurance how many owners of each type (high
probability and low probability) will purchase insurance.

NOTES
Using the numbers supplied by the instructor, each
insurance company can compute its total revenue (the
price per bike insured times the number of insured
bikes), the number of bikes stolen, and the company s
total replacement cost.
The group s score for a trading period equals the com-
pany s profit, which is the total revenue less the total
replacement cost for stolen bikes.
The experiment runs for several trading periods, and a
groups score equals the sum of its profits over these trad-
ing periods.

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
Here is the text from a TV newscast in the year 2070:
Boomer, the 200-meter asteroid on a collision path
with the earth, is expected to land at about 10:00 A.M.
in the heart of the world s breadbasket, the American
Midwest. The energy expected to be released by the
impact will exceed the total explosive yield of all the
nuclear weapons on the planet.
Although Boomer is much smaller than the asteroid
that caused the extinction of the dinosaurs about 65 mil-
lion years ago, it is large enough to cause significant
changes in the world s climate. The collision will generate a
stratospheric dust cloud that will inhibit photosynthesis
and retard plant growth, resulting in lower agricultural
yields and higher food prices throughout the world.

C
ould this catastrophe have been averted? Yes, according to scientists at the
National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA). In 1996 scientists
developed the technology for an asteroid-diversion system: Large optical
telescopes would detect an asteroid on a collision course with the earth, and an
orbiting gossamer mirror of coated polyester would focus a tight beam of sunlight
on the asteroid, vaporizing enough of its surface to change its path. In a United
Nations debate over the asteroid-diversion system, the representatives of all
nations agreed that the potential benefits of the system would outweigh the costs,
but no one was willing to pay for the system. Why couldn t the nations of the
world agree on such an important program, one that would have prevented
tomorrow s catastrophe?
In this chapter, we ll see that if a particular good generates external benefits, gov-
ernment intervention can make beneficial transactions. For example, although every-
one on Earth would benefit from an asteroid-diversion system, the cost is so high that
no single person would provide it. We will never have such a program
even if its
benefits exceed its costs
unless we make a collective decision about what sort of sys-
tem to develop and how to pay for it. One purpose of government is to help make this
kind of collective decision. A multinational arrangement may be necessary to launch
an asteroid-diversion program.
This chapter explores the challenges associated with providing goods that
generate external benefits. After an overview of government spending programs
and tax sources, we ll look at the differences between private goods, such as hous-
ing, and public goods, such as levees. We ll discuss various responses to the prob-
lem of free riders
people who benefit from public goods but don t pay for them.
We ll also discuss the external benefits from education and other private goods.
Then we ll show how the preferences of citizens affect elections and decisions in
the public sector. Finally, we ll look at some alternative theories on government
decision making.
Although it s convenient to talk about the  government, there are thousands
of governments in the United States, and each citizen deals with at least three dif-
ferent levels of government. Figure 30.1 shows the budget breakdown for the
three levels of government. The United States has more than 80,000 local govern-
ments, including municipalities (city governments), counties, school districts, and
special districts responsible for providing services such as water, fire protection,
and libraries. Local governments spend most of their money on education
(kindergarten through high school), public welfare and health (payments to poor
households and support for public hospitals), highways, fire protection, and police
and corrections. For states, the biggest spending programs are education (includ-
ing colleges and universities), public welfare, highways, health and hospitals, and
corrections (state courts and prisons). For the federal government, the biggest
spending programs are programs for the elderly (Social Security and Medicare),
national defense, income security (payments to the poor), and interest on the
national debt.
Figure 30.2 shows the revenue sources for local governments, states, and the fed-
eral government. About two-fifths of local government revenue comes from higher
levels of government in the form of intergovernmental grants. The other major rev-
enue source for local governments is the property tax, which is a fixed percentage of
the value of residential, commercial, or industrial property. At the state level, the
most important revenue sources are intergovernmental grants from the federal gov-
ernment, the sales tax, and the individual income tax. A person s state income tax lia-
bility is based on how much he or she earns, with tax rates that typically increase as
income increases. At the federal level, the major revenue sources are individual
income taxes and employment taxes, which include taxes collected to support Social
Security and Medicare.

PUBLIC GOODS AND PUBLIC CHOICE
646
public good
A good that is available for everyone to
consume, regardless of who pays and who
doesn t; a good that is nonrival in
consumption and nonexcludable.
private good
A good that is consumed by a single
person or household; a good that is rival
in consumption and excludable.
free rider
A person who gets the benefit from a
good but does not pay for it.
EXTERNAL BENEFITS AND PUBLIC GOODS
As we saw earlier in the chapter on market efficiency, when there are neither external
benefits nor external costs, the market equilibrium is efficient. When a government
intervenes in an efficient market, the result is inefficiency. In this chapter, we ll see
that a market with external benefits is inefficient, so there is an opportunity for gov-
ernment to promote efficiency.
For most goods, the benefits of consumption are confined to the person who buys
the good. The benefit experienced by a buyer is called a private benefit. In contrast, when
someone else benefits from a good, the good generates an external benefit. To illus-
trate the idea of external benefits and inefficiency, consider a dam built for flood-control
purposes. One thousand people would be protected by the dam, and each person would
get a $50 benefit. If one person builds a dam, the private benefit is $50 and the external
benefit is $49,950, or $50 for each of the 999 other people who benefit. If the cost of
building the dam is $20,000, no single person will build it because the cost exceeds the
$50 private benefit. In other words, if we rely on the forces of supply and demand, with
each person considering only the private benefits and costs of the dam, it won t be built.
When there are external benefits from a good, collective decision making generates
more efficient choices. In the case of the dam, the total benefit of $50,000 exceeds the
$20,000 cost, so the dam is efficient and society as a whole will be better off if it is built.
The government can solve this problem by collecting enough tax revenue to pay for the
dam. Suppose the government proposes to collect $20 per person to pay for the dam.
The tax raises $20,000 in tax revenue ($20 per person times 1,000 people), which is just
high enough to pay the $20,000 cost of the dam. Most people will support this proposal
because the $20 tax per person is less than the $50 benefit per person. The government
can use its taxing power to provide a good that would otherwise not be provided.
Public Goods and the Free-Rider Problem
The dam is an example of a public good. A public good is available for everyone to uti-
lize, regardless of who pays for it and who doesn t. More precisely, a public good is
nonrival in consumption: The fact that one person benefits from a good does not pre-
vent another person from benefiting. For example, the fact that I benefit from a flood-
control dam doesn t reduce your benefit from the dam. Public goods are also
nonexcludable: It is impractical to exclude people who don t pay. Some examples of
public goods are national defense, law enforcement, space exploration, the preserva-
tion of endangered species, the protection of the earth s ozone layer, and fireworks
shows. If someone refuses to pay for one of these public goods, it would be impracti-
cal to prevent that person from consuming or benefiting from the good.
In contrast with public goods, each unit of a private good is consumed by a sin-
gle person or household. For example, only one person can eat a hot dog, so it is a pri-
vate good. If a government hands out free cheese, is the free cheese a public good or a
private good? Although anyone can get in line for the cheese, only one person can
actually consume a particular piece of cheese, so the free cheese is a private good that
happens to be available free of charge from the government. Similarly, an apartment
in a public housing project can be occupied by a single household, so it is a private
good provided by the government.
Most public goods are supported by taxes. What would happen if we eliminated
taxes and asked people to contribute money to pay for national defense, dams, city
streets, and the police? Would people contribute enough money to support these pro-
grams at the efficient level? The problem with using voluntary contributions to support
public goods is known as the free-rider problem. A free rider is a person who gets the
benefit from a good but does not pay for it. Each person has a financial incentive to try
to get the benefits of a public good without paying for it. That is, some people will try to
get a free ride  at the expense of others who do pay. Of course, if everyone tries to get
a free ride there will be no money to support the public good, so it won t be provided.
30.1
external benefit
A benefit from a good experienced by
someone other than the person who buys
the good.

647
PART 10
The flip side of the free-rider problem is the chump problem: No one wants to be
the chump
the person who gives free rides to other people
so no one contributes any
money. The free-rider problem suggests that if taxes were replaced with voluntary con-
tributions, the government would be forced to cut back or eliminate many programs.
Overcoming the Free-Rider Problem
Many organizations, including public radio and television, religious organizations,
and charitable organizations, raise money through voluntary contributions. So it
appears that some people overcome their inclination to be free riders and contribute
voluntarily to organizations that provide public goods. The successful organizations
use a number of techniques to encourage people to contribute:
Giving contributors private goods such as coffee mugs, books, musical recordings,
and magazine subscriptions. People are more likely to contribute if they get
something for it.
Arranging matching contributions. You are more likely to contribute if you
know your $30 contribution will be matched with a contribution from another
person or your employer.
Appealing to a person s sense of civic or moral responsibility. People are more
likely to contribute when they are reminded that they benefit from the service.
Note, however, that these organizations are only partly successful in mitigating the
free-rider problem. Public radio is one of the success stories, even though the typical
public-radio station gets contributions from fewer than a quarter of its listeners.
Asteroid Diversion as a Public Good
Consider the issue of protecting the earth from catastrophic collisions with aster-
oids. On average, the earth is hit by a 200-meter asteroid every 10,000 years, by a
2-kilometer asteroid every million years, and by a 10-kilometer asteroid every
100 million years.1 As we saw at the beginning of the chapter, we have the tech-
nology to divert approaching asteroids.
The diversion of asteroids is a public good in the sense that it is available for
everyone s benefit, regardless of who pays and who doesn t. As with any public good,

FREE RIDERS AND THE THREE-CLOCK TOWER
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How can we respond to the free-rider problem?
In the days before inexpensive wristwatches, most people did not carry their own time-
pieces. Many towns built clock towers to help their citizens keep track of time. The towns
paid for the clock towers with voluntary contributions from citizens. One town in the
northeastern United States built a four-sided tower but put clock faces on only three sides
of the tower. To most people, this seems bizarre. If you build a clock tower, why not put
clock faces on all four sides? It turns out that one of the towns wealthy citizens refused to
contribute money to help build the clock tower. The town officials decided not to put a
clock face on the side of the tower facing this citizens house. In other words, the citizen
tried
unsuccessfully
to get a free ride. The problem is that other citizens on the same
side of town also suffered from not having a clock. In this case, preventing a free ride by
one citizen caused problems for other citizens. It also caused inefficiency because the cost
of a fourth clock was presumably much less than the foregone benefits to the excluded cit-
izens.

CHAPTER 30

the key to developing an asteroid-diversion program is to collect money to pay for
the program. According to NASA scientists, the program would require several new
telescopes, which would cost about $50 million to install and about $10 million per
year to operate.2 The cost of the gossamer mirror or the nuclear weapons required to
change the path of the asteroid would be $100 million to $200 million. Although it
would be sensible to finance the program with contributions from all earthlings, it
may be impossible to collect money from everyone. A more likely outcome is that
one or more developed countries will finance their own diversion systems.
PRIVATE GOODS WITH EXTERNAL BENEFITS
In contrast to a public good, a private good can be utilized by only a single person or
household. However, some private goods generate benefits for people who do not
directly consume the good. For example, suppose I replace the peeling paint on my house
with a fresh coat of paint. I benefit from the new paint because it protects my house from
decay and my house will look better. My neighbors will also benefit from the improved
appearance of the neighborhood. Similarly, if I buy a fire extinguisher and install fire-
proof roofing, my neighbors benefit because a fire is less likely to spread to their houses.
External Benefits from Education
Education is another private good that generates external benefits. Most of the bene-
fits of education go to the student because education increases productivity and
income, and presumably it makes everyday life easier and more interesting. Education
generates three kinds of external benefits:
1 Workplace externalities.
In most workplaces, people work in groups and team-
work is important. A well-educated person understands instructions readily and is
more likely to suggest ways to improve the production process. As a result, when

GLOBAL WEATHER OBSERVATION
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: What happens when external benefits spill
across international borders?
As another example of a public good, consider global weather observation. In this case,
information gathered by one country generates external benefits when it is shared with
other countries. Satellites, nomadic buoys, and weather stations monitor weather in dif-
ferent parts of the world, but no single organization gathers all the information to reveal
the big weather picture. Another problem is that the uninhabited parts of the world, in
particular the vast oceans of the Southern Hemisphere, receive little monitoring. This
makes it difficult to observe the interactions between oceans and atmosphere, and diffi-
cult to measure any changes in sea level that might be caused by global warming.
In recent years, the United States has taken the lead in encouraging cooperation
and the sharing of data collected by different organizations around the world. The
experience of coordination in monitoring El Niño, the intermittent ocean current
that affects weather in the western United States, is encouraging. According to the
National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), early warnings of a
change in the current in 1997 98 reduced damage to the California economy by about
$1.1 billion.

PART 10
a well-educated person joins a work team, the productivity of everyone on the
team increases. Higher productivity generally leads to higher profits for firms,
and members of the team are likely to earn higher salaries.
2 Civic externalities.
Citizens in a democratic society make collective decisions by
voting in elections, and each citizen must live with these decisions. A well-
educated person is more likely to vote intelligently, so there are external benefits
for other citizens.
3 Crime externalities.
Educated people earn higher legal incomes and thus commit
less crime. High-school dropouts have relatively low wages and high crime rates,
so increasing the high-school graduation rate generates large reductions in crime.
A recent study estimates the external benefits of education related to lower crime
rates.3 For every high-school student who graduates rather than dropping out after
11th grade, the cost of crime decreases by about $1,600 per year for the rest of the
graduates working life. The average cost of one year of high school is about $6,000, so
for a one-time expense of $6,000 society gets a crime-reduction benefit of $1,600 per
year for 30 or 40 years.
External Benefits and the Marginal Principle
Consider a parent s decision about how much time and money to spend on a childs
education. Suppose the parent bases the decision on his or her cost and the childs pri-
vate benefits
the childs increase in potential earnings as an adult. To be specific, con-
sider the decision on how many books to buy for the child. In Figure 30.3, the
marginal private benefit curve shows the extra benefit to the child from each additional
book, measured as the increase in future income. Assume the marginal cost of books is
constant at $8 per book. Applying the marginal principle, the parent will choose point
a, where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost, and buy nine books.
M A R G I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds its
marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal benefit equals the
marginal cost.
The higher of the two negatively sloped curves is the marginal social benefit of
education. The marginal social benefit equals the marginal private benefit plus the
marginal external benefit. As we ve seen, there are external benefits from education, so

Education (represented here as the num-

exceeds the marginal private benefit.
Using books as an example of educa-
tion, an individual picks point a, where
the marginal private benefit equals the
marginal cost. Point b is the socially effi-
cient point, where the marginal social
benefit equals the marginal cost.

CHAPTER 30

the social benefit exceeds the private benefit. From societys perspective, the best point
is b, where the marginal social benefit equals the marginal cost. The socially efficient
quantity is 15 books. As an illustration, consider the 12th book. The marginal private
benefit is $6 (shown by point c) and the external benefit is $4, so the marginal social
benefit is $6 plus $4, or $10 (shown by point d). The social benefit exceeds the $8 cost,
so providing the book is efficient from the social perspective. The private benefit of $6
is less than the $8 cost, however, so the parent won t buy the 12th book, but instead
will stop with 9 books. The lesson is that when there are external benefits, decisions
based on private benefits will generate an inefficiently small quantity of the good.
Because of the external benefits from education, the government uses various poli-
cies to encourage people to become educated. Local governments provide free educa-
tion through high school. States subsidize students at public colleges and universities,
providing college education at a fraction of its actual cost. In addition, the federal gov-
ernment provides financial aid to students in both public and private schools.
Other Private Goods That Generate External Benefits
The government subsidizes other goods that generate external benefits. Subsidies for
on-the-job training and education encourage workers and firms to invest in human
capital and increase labor productivity. It is sensible for the government to subsidize
training and education because some of the benefits are transferred to other firms
when workers change employers. Another example of external benefits is research at
universities and other nonprofit organizations. If a research project provides knowl-
edge or technology that leads to the development of new products or the improve-
ment of old ones, the benefits from the project spill over onto consumers and

EXTERNAL BENEFITS FROM LOJACK
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: What private goods generate
external benefits?
LoJack, a system used to recover stolen vehicles, is a private good that generates exter-
nal benefits. A small, silent transmitter hidden in a vehicle allows police to track a
stolen car. The name is a play on words, meant to convey the idea that LoJack will
recover vehicles that are hijacked or stolen. A thief who steals a LoJack-equipped car
won t keep the car for long and is likely to get caught, so LoJack is an effective deter-
rent to car theft. Car thieves cannot distinguish between cars with and without
LoJack, so the system decreases the payoff from car theft in general, and criminals
steal fewer cars. People who install LoJack systems in their cars generate benefits for
themselves and external benefits for other car owners who don t have LoJack.
A study by two economists estimated the private and external benefits from
LoJack. The annual cost of a LoJack system is about $100. For a car owner who car-
ries theft insurance, the benefit from a LoJack system is the discount offered by an
insurance company, typically well below the $100 annual cost. For every three LoJack
systems installed, the number of auto thefts decreases by one car per year. The exter-
nal benefit from fewer vehicle thefts is about $1,300 per LoJack per year. The benefits
are experienced by people who don t buy their own LoJack systems but who benefit
because thieves can never be sure whether a particular car is protected by LoJack or
not.

producers. When there are external benefits, the government can encourage people to
take actions that benefit other people. By making beneficial transactions happen, the
government can increase efficiency.
PUBLIC CHOICE
We have discussed the challenges associated with providing and paying for goods that gen-
erate external benefits. In this part of the chapter, we study public-choice economics, a
field that uses models of rational choice to explore decision making in the public sector.
We ll start with a model of government decisions based on voting and then look at some
alternative models.
Voting and the Median-Voter Rule
As citizens in a democracy, we pick people to make public decisions. We vote for peo-
ple to represent our viewpoints in legislative bodies (city council members, state legis-
lators, and congressional representatives), and we vote for people in executive
positions (mayors, governors, and presidents). The basic idea of a democracy is that
the government will take actions that are approved by the majority of citizens. If gov-
ernments are responsive to voters, the voting public ultimately makes all the impor-
tant decisions, and the actions of the government will reflect their preferences.
One concept of public-choice economics is known as the median-voter rule.
According to this rule, the choices made by the government will match the prefer-
ences of the median voter, defined as the voter whose preferences lie in the middle of
the set of all voters  preferences: Half the voters want more of something (for exam-
ple, a larger government budget) and half want less (a smaller government budget). As
we ll see, this rule has some important implications for decision making and politics.
To see the logic of the median-voter rule, consider a state where there are two can-
didates for governor
Penny and Buck
and the only issue in the election is how much
the state should spend on education. Each citizen will vote for the candidate whose pro-
posed education budget is closest to the citizens preferred budget. Figure 30.4 shows
citizens  preferences for education spending, with different preferred budgets on the
horizontal axis and the number of voters on the vertical axis. For example, two citizens

to purchase a seedling and plant it is relatively low,
but the owner s opportunity cost of upkeep (time and money spent watering, raking
leaves, trimming) can be large. The benefits
from shade, improved air quality, and
aesthetics
go to the property owner and the neighbors. A forest economist estimates
that a mature tree adds about $7,000 to the value of the owner s house, and also
increases the value of neighboring houses (within 100 feet) by a total of $13,000.
Given the $13,000 external benefit, we anticipate that the equilibrium number of trees
will be less than the socially efficient number. To address this problem, some cities
subsidize the purchase of trees. For example, the city of Portland, Oregon, pays $50
for each new tree. In addition, some cities provide public services such as leaf pickup
that reduce the cost of upkeep.

have a preferred budget of $1 billion, four have a preferred budget of $2 billion, and so
on. The median budget, which splits the rest of the voters into two equal groups (20 vot-
ers on each side), is $5 billion.
Suppose the two candidates start out with very different proposed education bud-
gets. Penny proposes a budget of $3 billion, and Buck proposes $7 billion. The 20 cit-
izens with preferred budgets less than or equal to $4 billion will vote for Penny
because her proposed budget is closest to their preferred budgets. Bucks supporters
include the 20 citizens with preferred budgets greater than or equal to $6 billion. The
two candidates will split the 10 voters with a preferred budget of $5 billion (halfway
between the two proposed budgets), so each candidate will get a total of 25 votes,
resulting in a tie.
Penny could increase her chance of being elected by increasing her proposed bud-
get. Lets say she proposes $4 billion instead of $3 billion. All the voters with a pre-
ferred budget of $5 billion will vote for Penny because Pennys $4 billion proposal is
now closer to their $5 billion preferred budget than Buck s $7 billion proposal. Penny
won t lose any of her other votes either, so she will win the election by a vote of 30
(equal to 2 + 4 + 6 + 8 + 10) to 20 (equal to 8 + 8 + 4). If Buck is smart, he will realize
that he could get more votes by moving toward the median budget. For example, if he
decreases his proposed budget to $6 billion, the election would result in a tie vote
again. Penny and Buck will continue to move their proposed budgets toward the
median budget ($5 billion) until they both propose budgets that are very close to the
median budget.
Powerful forces pull the two candidates toward the preferences of the median
voter. As long as Penny proposes a smaller budget than Buck, the people with small
preferred budgets will continue to vote for her. The benefit of moving toward the
median is that she can take some votes from Buck. Similarly, Buck doesn t have to
worry about people with large preferred budgets but can concentrate instead on the
battle for voters in the middle. The result is that by election day the two candidates
have adopted virtually the same position: The position of the median voter. Voters
trying to choose between two candidates may feel they don t have much choice. In
fact, the median-voter rule says the choices made by government will match the pref-
erences of the median voter, regardless of who wins the election.
Although we usually think that people make political decisions by voting in elec-
tions, it is also possible to vote with your feet.  In 1956 economist Charles M.

The Median-Voter Rule
If Penny proposes a $3 billion budget and Buck proposes a $7 billion budget, the election will result
in a tie. By moving toward the median budget, Penny can increase her chance of being elected. In
equilibrium, both candidates will propose a budget close to the $5 billion preferred budget of the
median voter.

PART 10
Tiebout suggested that a household s choice of which community to live in is based in
part on the tax and spending policies of different communities.4 Households express
their preferences by moving to communities that offer the best package of services and
taxes. A community with inefficient public services will experience a loss in popula-
tion, perhaps causing the local officials to make public services more efficient to
attract new residents.
It is clear that people vote with their ballots and with their feet. In both cases, cit-
izens can express their preferences for public goods, taxes, and public policies. These
two sources of citizen power limit the ability of governments to take actions that are
inconsistent with the preferences of most voters.
The Median Voter and the Median Location
The logic of the median-voter result also applies to competition among some types of
sellers. Imagine a one-mile stretch of beach with 120 swimmers and sunbathers dis-
tributed evenly along it. Suppose each person on the beach will purchase one ice-
cream cone and is willing to travel up to a mile to get it. If there are two ice-cream
vendors on the beach selling identical products, where will they locate?
The most efficient arrangement is to locate the two vendors a half mile apart. We
could divide the beach into two half-mile territories and locate each vendor at the mid-
dle of a territory. As shown in Panel A of Figure 30.5, Lefty would be at the 1/4 mile
mark, and Righty would be at the 3/4 mile mark. If beachgoers patronize the closer

If the two sellers start at the 1/4 and 3/4 mile marks, each

If Lefty moves to the median location, his territory increases to the

Righty can recover her lost territory by moving to the median
location. In equilibrium, both sellers locate at the median location
and each has half the market:

* FIGURE 30.5
Competition on a Beach Leads to a Median Location for Both Sellers
(A) If one seller starts at the 1/4 mile mark and the other starts at the 3/4 mile mark, each has a terri-
tory of 1/2 mile and sells 60 cones. 
(B) If Lefty moves to the median location, his territory increases to the 5/8 mile mark, and he sells
75 cones, compared to 45 for Righty.

CHAPTER 30
PUBLIC GOODS AND PUBLIC CHOICE

vendor, each vendor would sell 60 ice-cream cones. This arrangement will minimize
the total travel costs of ice-cream patrons.
Is this an equilibrium arrangement? If Lefty were to move to the right
to the
1/2 mile mark, the median location that splits consumers into two equal halves
he
would not lose any of his customers to his left but would capture part of Rightys mar-
ket. As shown in Panel B of Figure 30.5, Lefty would then be the closer vendor for the
people located between the 1/2 mile mark and the 5/8 mile mark. Therefore, Lefty
would sell 75 cones (up from 60) and Righty would sell only 45 cones. To protect her
market, Righty would move to the median location, too, locating right next to Lefty.
By doing so, Righty can recover her 50 percent share of the market, again serving the
consumers on the right half of the beach. At any other location, she would get less
than half the market, given Lefty is at the median location. In equilibrium, shown in
Panel C of Figure 30.5, both vendors pick the median location and each serves half
the market.
The outcome of the ice-cream vendors  game is the same as for the politicians
game. Like politicians, the vendors have an incentive to move to the median location,
so there is no real difference between the two vendors.
Alternative Models of Government: Self-Interest and
Special Interests
Several economists, including Nobel Laureate James Buchanan, have suggested a
model of government that focuses on the selfish behavior of government officials.
According to this view, politicians and bureaucrats pursue their own narrow interests,
which, of course, may differ from the public interest. For example, politicians or
bureaucrats may gain prestige from starting a new spending program even if the cost
of the program exceeds its social benefit. Because voters don t have much information
about the costs and benefits of public services, they may not be in a position to evalu-
ate the actions of politicians or bureaucrats and vote accordingly.
The self-interest theory of government explains why voters sometimes approve
explicit limits on taxes and government spending. For example, many states have lim-
its on property tax rates and total revenue, and many states also limit total government
spending. According to the self-interest theory of government, limitations on taxes
and spending are necessary safeguards against politicians and bureaucrats who benefit
from larger budgets.
Another model of government is based on the idea that small groups of people
manipulate government for their own gain. Suppose the total benefit of a dam is less
than its total cost, so the project is inefficient, but a few farmers reap large benefits
from the dam, while the costs are spread over a million taxpayers. The farmers have a
strong incentive to spend time and money convincing policymakers to build the dam.
In contrast, if the tax is only $1 per person, few taxpayers will make their preferences
known to policymakers because the marginal benefit (the $1 tax savings) is less than
the marginal cost (the opportunity cost of their time). If politicians listen to people
who express their preferences and contribute money to political campaigns, the ineffi-
cient project may be approved. This is an example of a special-interest group (farmers)
manipulating the government at the expense of a larger group (all taxpayers). In gen-
eral, when a few people share the benefit from a project and a large number of people
share the cost, the government is more likely to approve inefficient projects.
Whenever benefits are concentrated on a few citizens but costs are spread out
over many, we expect special-interest groups to form. Special-interest organizations
often use lobbyists to express their views to government officials and policymakers.
Which Theory Is Correct?
Which of these theories or viewpoints best describes the actual practices of govern-
ments? This is a very difficult question. Economists and political scientists have studied
many dimensions of the decision-making processes underlying tax policies and spending

655
PART 10
policies. There is evidence that people do vote with ballots and with their feet, and that
these two forms of voting make a difference. There is also evidence that government
officials sometimes pursue their own interests and those of special-interest groups.
The field of public choice is a very active area of research for both economists and
political scientists.

THE MEDIAN VOTER AND SUPPORT FOR PUBLIC SCHOOLS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #5: What are the implications of the median-
voter rule?
Why do voters support public schools? The median-voter result allows us to narrow
this question to Why does the median voter support public schools?  The median
voter will vote in favor of public schools if his (or her) benefit exceeds her cost (his or
her tax liability). When will that happen?
Table 30.1 provides an example with three voters with different incomes. In
Scenario A voter 3 has a very high income, so the median income ($20) is less than the
average income ($30). In this case, the median voter has only 22 percent of total
income (20/90), and if school taxes are proportional to income, the median voter will
pay only 22 percent of school taxes. If the benefit of education is distributed equally
across voters, schooling looks like a good deal to the median voter: Pay 22 percent of
taxes to get 33 percent of the benefits.
In Scenario B the median income is greater than the average income. In this case,
the highest-income voter doesn t earn much more than the median voter, and the
median voter has 40 percent of total income (20/51) and thus pays 40 percent of
school taxes. Compared to Scenario A, public schooling appears less attractive (pay
40% of taxes to get 33% of benefits) and if the median voter bases her decision strictly
on her own benefits, a NO vote is more likely.

A recent paper finds evidence that in the early years of public education (in the
1800s), Scenario B generated strong voter support for public schools. In other words,
even when the median voter faced an above-average tax liability, he or she voted in
favor of public schools. One interpretation of this result is that the median voter based
his or her vote on both the private and the external benefit of education. Suppose the
education of others increased the welfare of the median voter by a relatively large
amount. In that case, the external benefit experienced by the median voter will be
large enough to offset his or her relatively large tax bill, and the rational response is to
vote YES.

In this chapter, we ve seen why the
government provides public goods.
The free-rider problem means that
we can t rely on voluntary contribu-
tions to support public goods and
subsidies, so taxes are necessary to
support public programs. We ve
also examined different views on
how governments actually make
decisions. Here are the main points
of the chapter:
1 When a good generates external benefits, collective decision
making generates more-efficient choices.
2 A public good is available for everyone to consume (nonri-
val in consumption), regardless of who pays and who
doesn t (nonexcludable).
3 A system of voluntary contributions suffers from the free-rider
problem: People do not have a financial incentive to support
public goods.
4 Education generates external benefits in the workplace and
in elections and reduces crime.
5 The median-voter rule suggests that government choices will
match the preferences of the median voter, defined as the voter
whose preferences lie in the middle of voter preferences.

Voluntary Contributions
Do people really try to get free rides? Or would most people
contribute at least some money to support a public good? Here
is a classroom experiment that helps to answer this question:
The instructor selects 10 students and gives each student
10 dimes.
Each student can contribute money to support a public
good by dropping 1, 2, or 3 dimes into a public-good pot.
Each student has the option of keeping all the dimes and not
contributing anything. The contributions are anonymous:
No one knows how much a particular student contributes.
For each dime in the pot, the instructor adds 2 dimes.
For example, if the students contribute a total of
40 dimes, the instructor adds 80 dimes, for a total of
120 dimes in the pot. The two-for-one match represents
the idea that the benefits of public goods exceed the
costs. In this case, the benefit/cost ratio is three to one.
The instructor divides the money in the public-good pot
equally among the 10 students. For example, if there are
120 dimes in the pot, each student receives 12 dimes.
Steps 2 through 4 can be repeated four or five times.
We can change the experiment to mimic the compul-
sory tax system. The instructor could require each student
to contribute 3 dimes, the maximum amount. Would a
switch to a compulsory tax system make the students better
or worse off?

Experiment Debriefing
After completing the experiment, do the following exercise:
Consider the contribution incentives for Margie, one of
the 10 students in the experiment. She thinks in marginal
terms and asks herself, If I contribute one more dime, how
would that affect my payoff from the experiment?
a. Answer Margie s question, assuming her contribution
does not affect the contributions of other students.
b. If Margie uses the marginal principle to make all her
decisions, will she contribute the extra dime?

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
The European Union has a cap-and-trade system for the
emission of carbon dioxide, one of the greenhouse
gases responsible for climate change. Each company is
granted allowances that represent their target level of emis-
sions or 
cap  for the year. The European Climate
Exchange (www.ecx.eu) provides firms the opportunity to
buy and sell their allowances. If a firm expects its total emis-
sion of CO2 to be less than its cap, the firm can sell its sur-
plus allowances to a firm that expects its emissions to
exceed its own cap. A firm whose emissions exceed its
allowance (the cap plus allowances bought or minus
allowances sold) pays a penalty of 100 euros per excess ton
of CO2. This system of marketable emissions permits pro-
motes efficiency because it ensures that CO2 abatement is
undertaken by the firms with the lowest abatement cost.

A
s we saw earlier in the chapter on market efficiency, one condition for a market to
be efficient is that there are no external costs in production: The cost of produc-
ing a product is confined to the person who sells it. In contrast, when production
generates external costs such as air or water pollution, we say there is market failure:
Markets fail to allocate resources efficiently. The role of public policy is to intervene in
the market to make it more efficient. As we ll see in this chapter, the best response to
market failure is not to abandon markets, but instead to use them to reduce pollution in
the most efficient manner. We ll discuss two market-oriented policies: pollution taxes and
auctions for pollution permits. The chapters theme is that often the economic solution to
market failure is to create markets where they do not currently exist.
THE OPTIMAL LEVEL OF POLLUTION
Should we eliminate all pollution? Although a pristine environment with pure water
and air sounds appealing, there would be some very unappealing consequences. To
reduce air pollution, we could eliminate trucks, but shipping goods by horse-drawn
wagon would result in higher freight costs and higher prices for most products
and a
different sort of pollution. We could reduce water pollution by shutting down all the
paper mills, but reverting to parchment and slate boards would be unwieldy. Given the
consequences of eliminating pollution, it is sensible to allow some pollution to occur.
Whats the optimal level of pollution?
Using the Marginal Principle
The most convenient way to discuss pollution policies is in terms of pollution abate-
ment, that is, reductions in pollution from some starting level. We can use the mar-
ginal principle to determine the optimal level of pollution abatement.
M A R G I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds its
marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal benefit equals the
marginal cost.
According to this principle, we should cut pollution to the level where the marginal
benefit of abatement equals its marginal cost.
The marginal principle focuses our attention on the trade-offs from pollution
its costs and benefits. From societys perspective, there are many benefits from pollu-
tion abatement:
Better health. Cleaner water means less sickness from waterborne pollutants,
and cleaner air means fewer respiratory problems and thus lower health-care
costs and fewer sick days taken by workers.
Increased enjoyment of the natural environment. Improving the air quality
increases visibility and improves the health of trees. Improving the water qual-
ity enhances recreational activities, such as swimming, boating, and fishing.
Lower production costs. Some firms are dependent on clean water for survival:
Farmers use water for irrigation, and some manufacturers use clean water as
part of the production process. Cleaner water means lower production costs for
these firms.
On the other hand, pollution abatement is costly because resources
labor, capital,
and land
are used in the abatement process. Using the marginal principle, we look for
the level of pollution abatement at which the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost.

Efficient Abatement and Coase Bargaining
The efficient level of pollution abatement, where the marginal benefit equals the marginal cost, is
300 tons (200 tons of waste). If the property rights are assigned to the polluter (steel mill), we start
with zero abatement, and the other party (the fishing firm) pays to reach 300 tons of abatement. If
the property rights are assigned to the other party, we start with zero pollution, and the polluter pays
to increase pollution to 200 tons of waste.
Example: The Optimal Level of Water Pollution
To illustrate the determination of the optimum level of pollution, consider a lake
shared by a steel mill and a fishing firm. The mill dumps waste into the lake, and pol-
lution degrades the fish habitat and decreases the fish harvest. Figure 31.1 shows the
marginal benefits and marginal costs of pollution abatement. The firm can abate pol-
lution, and the positively sloped curve is the marginal cost of abatement, which
increases from $3 for the first unit abated (point b) to $13 for the last unit abated
(point f ). The negatively sloped curve is the marginal benefit of abatement, equal to
the increase in the fish harvest from a one-ton decrease in pollution. The marginal
benefit decreases as abatement increases, from $21 for the first ton of abatement
(point a) to $1 for the last ton abated (point g).
We can apply the marginal principle to determine the socially efficient outcome.
The efficient outcome is shown by point e, where the marginal benefit of abatement
equals the marginal cost at 300 tons of abatement and 200 tons of waste. For any smaller
quantity of abatement, the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost, so increasing
abatement is more beneficial than costly. For example, if we start with 100 tons of abate-
ment (400 tons of waste), the marginal benefit is $17, compared to a marginal cost of $5.
Abating an additional ton increases the fish harvest by $17 but costs the steel firm only
$5, so additional abatement is socially efficient. At the other extreme, we could have a
pristine lake, with zero waste and 500 tons of abatement (points f and g). This is ineffi-
cient because the last unit of abatement (decreasing pollution from 1 ton to 0) has a cost
of $13 (point f ) and a benefit of only $1 (point g). Stated another way, the first unit of
pollution is less costly to experience ($1) than it is to prevent ($13), so it is efficient to
have some pollution. The same logic applies to the 301st through the 500th units of
abatement: The marginal benefit of abatement is less than the marginal cost.

663
PART 10
Coase Bargaining
Under some circumstances, an external-cost problem can be resolved through bar-
gaining among the affected parties. The Coase bargaining solution, named after econ-
omist Ronald Coase, applies to a situation when there is a small number of affected
parties, and the transactions costs of bargaining are relatively low.
We can illustrate the bargaining solution with our example of a lake shared by a
steel mill and a fishing firm. If the steel mill has the property rights to the lake, it can
dump waste into the lake. The fishing firm benefits from abatement, and would be
willing to pay the mill to reduce pollution. For the first ton of abatement, the fishing
firm is willing to pay $21, the cost of abating the first ton is only $3, and the two par-
ties can cut a deal. If they split the difference between the benefit and the cost, the
fishing firm will pay $12 to the mill for one ton of abatement, and both will be better
off. The fishing firm pays $12 to get $21 in additional fish, while the mill gets $12 to
incur an abatement cost of $3. The same logic applies to the second ton of abatement:
The marginal benefit (just below $21) exceeds the marginal cost (just above $3), so
the two parties can cut a deal. As shown by points c and d, the marginal benefit of the
100th ton of abatement exceeds the marginal cost by $12, so there is still an opportu-
nity for an abatement deal. The deal making continues until we reach point e, where
the marginal benefit to the fishing firm equals the marginal cost to the mill. Beyond
this point, the marginal benefit of abatement is less than the marginal cost: The
amount the fishing firm is willing to pay for one more ton of abatement is less than the
cost of abatement.
How would things change if we assigned the property rights to the fishing firm
rather than the steel mill? In this case, we would start with a pristine lake, with 0 tons of
pollution and thus 500 tons of abatement. In Figure 31.1, we start at points f and g. As
shown by point g, the marginal benefit of the last unit of abatement (going from 1 ton of
pollution to 0), is a $1 increase in the fish harvest. As shown by point f, the marginal cost

REDUCING METHANE EMISSIONS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: How do we determine the optimum level
of pollution?
Methane is one of the greenhouse gases that contribute to global warming. It is
released into the atmosphere from landfills, natural gas systems, coal mining, and live-
stock management. In this case, abatement of emissions requires methane recovery
capturing the gas before it is released into the atmosphere and then using it to
generate heat or electricity. The marginal cost of abatement is less than $10 per ton
for the first 36 million metric tons, and increases at an increasing rate, reaching
$150 per ton at 69 million metric tons. It is relatively cheap to recover moderate
amounts of methane from landfills and coal mines and to reduce leaks in the distribu-
tion of natural gas. As the volume recovered increases, however, the abatement sys-
tems become progressively more expensive. For example, it is relatively cheap to
reduce natural-gas leakage by maintaining surface facilities such as pipelines, but rela-
tively expensive to reduce venting at production sites.
What is the optimal level of methane abatement? It depends on the marginal ben-
efit of abatement. For example, if the marginal benefit is $10, the optimum level is
about 36 million metric tons. But if the marginal benefit is $150, the optimum level of
abatement is about 69 million metric tons.

of the last unit of abatement is $13. In other words, going from 1 ton of pollution to 0
generates a cost to the steel mill of $13. Reversing direction, allowing 1 ton of pollution
would save the steel firm $13. In other words, allowing the first ton of waste would harm
the fishing firm by only $1 and save the mill $13, so there is room to bargain. Splitting
the difference between the $1 harm and $13 cost savings, if the steel mill paid $7 for the
right to dump 1 ton of waste, both firms would be better off: The fishing firm would
receive $7 to tolerate a $1 loss in harvest, while the steel mill would pay $7 to avoid $13
in abatement cost. The same logic applies to the second ton of pollution: The harm to
the fishing firm (just above $1) is less than the cost savings to the steel firm (just below
$13), so the fishing firm can cut a deal to allow 2 tons of waste. The bargaining stops at
the socially efficient point (200 tons of waste and 300 tons of abatement) because an
additional ton of pollution harms the fishing firm by more than it saves the steel firm.
We ve seen that assigning property rights to either the steel mill or the fishing
firm generates the socially efficient outcome. Once property rights are assigned, bar-
gaining and side payments allow the firms to adjust the level of pollution as long as the
marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost. For efficiency purposes, it doesn t matter
who owns the lake as long as someone owns it. Of course, the assignment of property
rights has important equity implications: Whoever owns the lake collects the side pay-
ments from the party that doesn t.
Under what circumstances can we rely on Coase bargaining to generate the
socially efficient outcome? In our example, bargaining is plausible because there are
only two parties. In contrast, if there were several polluting and fishing firms, bar-
gaining among all the affected parties would probably be unwieldy. In general, Coase
bargaining requires a small number of affected parties and small transactions costs
(the costs of arranging side payments). When the number of affected parties is large,
the bargaining process won t work, and the solution to a spillover problem requires a
centralized policy such as pollution taxes, regulations, or marketable permits.
TAXING POLLUTION
The economic approach to pollution is to get producers to pay for the waste they gen-
erate, just as they pay for labor, capital, and materials. The costs of labor, capital, and
materials are the private cost of production, the cost borne by the producer of the
product. The external cost of production is the cost incurred by someone other than
the producer, for example, the cost associated with health problems and premature
deaths from sulfur dioxide. The social cost of production is the sum of the private
cost and the external cost. The idea of a pollution tax equal to the external cost per
unit of pollution is to internalize  the externality
to make the producer responsible
for the external cost of production. When the tax equals the external cost imposed on
others, the externality is internalized. In the example of sulfur dioxide pollution, the
appropriate pollution tax is the external cost of $3,500 per ton.
A Firm s Response to a Pollution Tax
A polluting firm will respond to a pollution tax in the same way it responds to the
prices of labor and materials. The firm will use the marginal principle to decide how
much waste to generate and how much to abate. The firm will increase the level of
abatement as long as the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost and stop when the
marginal benefit equals the marginal cost.
Figure 31.2 shows an electricity producers marginal benefits and costs of abating
SO2. The marginal cost is $2,200 for the first ton abated (point a), and the marginal
cost increases with the level of abatement to $3,500 for the sixth ton abated (point c)
and $4,500 for the seventh ton (point d). The marginal cost increases with the amount
abated because the firm must use progressively more costly means to cut emissions.
From the firms perspective, the benefit of abating pollution is that it can avoid paying

the pollution tax. The marginal benefit of abatement is the $3,500 savings in pollution
taxes from abating a ton of SO2 rather than discharging it into the air.
The firm satisfies the marginal principle at point c, with six tons of abatement. For
the first six tons abated, the marginal benefit of abatement
avoiding the $3,500 tax
is greater than or equal to the marginal cost. The firm stops at six tons because the
marginal cost of abating a seventh ton ($4,500, as shown by point d ), exceeds the mar-
ginal benefit (the $3,500 tax avoided). Instead of paying $4,500 to abate one more ton,
the firm will instead pay the $3,500 tax.
The Market Effects of a Pollution Tax
Consider the effect of a pollution tax on the market for the product produced by pol-
luting firms. For example, a tax on SO2 increases the cost of producing electricity
because firms pay for abatement and also pay pollution taxes on any remaining waste
they generate. As we saw in an earlier chapter on market efficiency, a tax shifts the
supply curve upward by the amount of the tax, decreasing the equilibrium quantity
and increasing the equilibrium price.
Consider the effects of pollution taxes on the market for electricity. The produc-
tion of electricity generates two major pollutants:
Sulfur dioxide. Electric power plants are responsible for about two-thirds of
SO2 emissions. As we saw earlier in the chapter, the marginal damage from SO2
is $3,500 per ton, so thats the appropriate pollution tax.
Nitrogen oxides (NOx). Power plants are also responsible for about one-quarter
of the nations NOx emissions, a contributing factor in acid rain and the most
important factor in urban smog. The study cited earlier in the chapter estimated
that the appropriate tax for NOx is about $1,100 per ton.
Figure 31.3 shows the effects of pollution taxes in the market for electricity.
The taxes increase the cost of producing electricity, shifting the supply curve
upward. The equilibrium moves from point a to point b, where the demand curve
intersects the new supply curve. According to the electricity study, the pollution
taxes would increase the price of electricity from $64.90 to $67.60 per megawatt-
hour, an increase of 4 percent. The price elasticity of demand for electricity is 0.28,
so the 4 percent increase in price decreases the quantity of electricity demanded by

The Firm s Response to an SO2 Tax
From the perspective of a firm subject to a pollution tax, the marginal benefit of abatement is the
$3,500 pollution tax that can be avoided by cutting pollution by one ton. The firm satisfies the marginal
principle at point c, with six tons of abatement, leaving two tons of SO2 discharged into the atmosphere.

1.1 percent, from 4,294 to 4,247 megawatt-hours. Like other taxes, the pollution tax
is shifted forward to consumers in the form of a higher price, and they respond by
consuming less of the polluting good. When consumers face the full cost of produc-
ing electricity, they buy less of it.
A pollution tax also changes the production process as firms switch to cleaner
technology. Figure 31.4 shows the effects of pollution taxes on the energy sources
used to generate electricity. Producers respond to the taxes by switching to low-sulfur
coal, which is more expensive but reduces their SO2 taxes. The share of power gener-
ated with low-sulfur coal increases from 0.43 to 0.53. The taxes increase the cost of
using coal relative to the cost of using natural gas and nuclear power, so the share of

electricity from these other sources increases while the share of power from coal
decreases. As firms shift to cleaner energy sources, the amount of SO2 and NOx emis-
sions per unit of electricity generated decreases.
These pollution taxes decrease the total amount of air pollution for two reasons.
First, as shown in Figure 31.3, the increase in the price of electricity decreases the
quantity of electricity demanded by 1 percent. Second, as shown in Figure 31.4, the
shift to cleaner energy sources means that each unit of electricity generates less pollu-
tion. The combined effect of these two changes is a substantial reduction in pollution:
SO2 decreases to 11 percent of its initial volume, and NOx decreases to 30 percent of
its initial volume. An added bonus of the pollution tax is that the government could
use the revenue from the tax to cut other taxes, for example, the payroll tax or the
income tax.
Example: A Carbon Tax
An ongoing environmental issue is how to respond to the problem of global warming
caused by greenhouse gases. One approach is to tax carbon-based fuels. A carbon tax
of $100 per ton of carbon content would translate into taxes of $0.28 per gallon of
gasoline, $12 per barrel of oil, and $70 per ton of coal. The tax on coal would be rela-
tively high because of its higher carbon content.
A carbon tax would reduce greenhouse emissions in several ways:
The price of gasoline would increase, causing people to drive less and buy more
energy-efficient vehicles.
The tax would increase the price of electricity, decreasing the quantity of elec-
tricity demanded and the quantity of fossil fuels burned.
The higher price of home heating would cause people to turn down their ther-
mostats and improve the heating efficiency of their homes, perhaps by installing
energy-efficient windows or more insulation.
Some electricity producers would switch from coal to natural gas, which has a
lower carbon content, and thus a lower carbon tax. Others would switch to non-
carbon energy sources such as wind power, solar power, and geothermal sources.

POLLUTION TAXES IN RURAL AND URBAN AREAS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: How do pollution taxes vary across space?
A recent study estimates the marginal damages (marginal external cost) for 10,000 sources
of air pollution in the United States. The study reveals substantial spatial variation in the
marginal damage from pollution, a result of differences in population densities around the
pollution sources. For example, the marginal damage from SO2 is $220 per ton for an
electricity-generating unit in rural Oregon, compared to $10,860 per ton for a generator
upwind of New York City. The appropriate pollution tax equals the marginal damage from
pollution, so the tax on a polluter in an urban area would be much higher than the tax on
a rural polluter. One response to a system of efficient pollution taxes would be to shift pol-
lution to less densely populated areas, where damages from pollution are much lower.

CHAPTER 31
EXTERNAL COSTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
668
TRADITIONAL REGULATION
Although the economic approach to pollution is to get polluters to pay for the waste
they generate, governments often take a different approach. Under a traditional regu-
lation policy, the government tells each firm how much pollution to abate and what
abatement techniques to use.
Uniform Abatement with Permits
To illustrate the effects of regulation, consider an area with two electricity generators,
firm L (for low cost) and firm H (for high cost). Suppose that in the absence of pollution-
abatement efforts, each firm would discharge two tons of pollution per hour. The gov-
ernment sets a target abatement level of two tons of SO2 per hour, divided equally
between the two firms. Under this uniform abatement policy, the government will issue
four pollution permits to each firm, forcing each firm to cut pollution from two tons to
one ton.
Table 31.1 shows the numbers behind the example. The marginal abatement
cost of firm L is $2,000 and the marginal abatement cost for firm H is $5,000. Under
the uniform-abatement policy, the total cost of abatement is $2,000 for firm L and
$5,000 for firm H, for a total of $7,000. Suppose instead the government imposes a
pollution tax of $3,000 per ton. Firm L will respond by abating two tons because the
marginal cost of abatement ($2,000) is less than the tax. In contrast, firm H will pay
the tax because the marginal cost of abatement ($5,000) exeeds the tax. When the
low-cost firm does all the abating, the total cost of reducing pollution by two tons is
only $4,000.
31.3
A policy of uniform abatement is inefficient because it does not take advantage of
the differences in abatement costs between the two firms. In contrast, a pollution tax
encourages abatement by the most efficient abaters. When we treat firms equally in
terms of the consequences of their pollution (each pays the same tax per ton), we get
an efficent response. The low-cost firm incurs abatment costs to avoid the tax, while
the high-cost firm incurs tax costs to avoid costly abatement.
Command and Control
Traditional regulation policies have another dimension that contributes to higher
compliance costs. Under a command-and-control policy, the government requires
each firm to produce no more than a certain volume of pollution and requires the
abatement be done with a particular technology. The problem with this approach is
that the mandated abatement technology
the control part of the policy
is unlikely
to be the most efficient technology for two reasons:
The regulatory policy specifies a single abatement technology for all firms.
Because the producers of a polluting good often use different materials and

production techniques, an abatement technology that is efficient for one firm
may be inefficient for others.
The regulatory policy decreases the incentives to develop more efficient abate-
ment technologies. The command part of the policy specifies a maximum vol-
ume of waste for each firm, so there is no incentive to cut the volume of waste
below the maximum allowed. In other words, the benefit of developing new
technologies is relatively small because there is no payoff from using them. In
contrast, a pollution tax provides the right incentives: If the firm develops a new
technology that cuts pollution, it will pay less in pollution taxes.
A command-and-control policy causes firms to use inefficient abatement technolo-
gies, so production costs will be higher than they would be under a pollution tax.
Market Effects of Pollution Regulations
How do the market effects of pollution regulation compare to the effects of a pollu-
tion tax? Recall that the uniform abatement policy achieves the same reduction in pol-
lution at a higher cost because it doesn t exploit differences in abatement costs across
firms. In addition, the control part of command and control may lead to relatively
costly abatement techniques because theres no incentive to develop better ones. This
will cause the supply curve for the polluting good to shift upward by a larger amount
than it would with a tax. A larger supply shift causes a larger increase in the equilib-
rium price and a larger reduction in quantity. The inefficiency of regulations is passed
on to consumers, who pay higher prices.
One advantage of the command-and-control policy is its predictability. The
policy specifies how much waste each firm can produce, so we can predict the total
volume of waste. In contrast, we don t know exactly how firms will respond to the
pollution tax
they could pollute a little or a lot, depending on the tax and the cost
of abating pollution
so it is difficult to predict the total volume of waste that will
be emitted.
Lesson from Dear Abby: Options for Pollution Abatement
We ve seen that one problem with traditional environmental policy is that it is inflex-
ible. It doesn t allow firms to use the most efficient abatement methods available. An
example of different abatement strategies comes from advice columnist Abigail Van
Buren.1 A person with the moniker Dreading Winter  sought advice about how to
deal with a pollution problem. Her neighbors heated their home with a wood-burning
stove, and the smell and smoke from the wood fire gave Dreading Winter burning
eyes, a stuffy nose, and painful sinuses. She offered the neighbors $500 to stop burn-
ing wood, but they declined the offer. The readers of Dear Abby  offered the follow-
ing suggestions to Dreading Winter:
Buy the neighbors a catalytic add-on for the wood stove or a wood-chip gasifier
for an oil furnace. In either case, there would be much less air pollution from
burning wood.
Soak a towel in water, swish it around the room, and watch the smoke disappear.
Leave a saucer of vinegar in each room to eliminate the smoke odor.
Pay your neighbors to hire a chimney sweep to clean their flue.
Seal and caulk your windows to keep the smoke outside at a cost of less than $500.
Use the $500 to purchase an air purifier for your home.
These suggestions demonstrate a fundamental idea behind environmental eco-
nomics: There is usually more than one way to deal with a pollution problem. The
economic question is What is the most efficient and least costly way to reduce the
problem?  In some cases, it may be more efficient to prevent pollution (by modifying

CHAPTER 31
EXTERNAL COSTS AND ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
670
the stove or switching to an alternative fuel) than to let pollution happen and then
clean up the environment (by using an air purifier). In other cases, cleanup will be
more efficient than prevention.
MARKETABLE POLLUTION PERMITS
In recent years, policymakers have developed a new approach to environmental policy.
The approach uses marketable pollution permits, sometimes called pollution
allowances. Here is how a government runs a system of marketable pollution permits:
Pick a target pollution level for a particular area.
Issue just enough permits to meet the pollution target.
Allow firms to buy and sell the permits.
In the policy world, this is known as a cap-and-trade system: The government caps
the total emissions by issuing a fixed number of permits, and then allows firms to trade
the permits.
Voluntary Exchange and Marketable Permits
Making pollution permits marketable is sensible because it allows mutually beneficial
exchanges between firms with different abatement costs. This is another illustration of
the principle of voluntary exchange.

MERCURY IN TUNA
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Are there different ways to reduce pollution
or mitigate its effects?
Recent studies have reported dangerously high levels of mercury in tuna served in
sushi restaurants. In one study, one-third of the samples had more than one part of
mercury per million, the level that allows the Food and Drug Administration (FDA)
to take fish off the market. Our exposure to mercury from all sources could be reduced
in a number of ways, at vastly different costs.
Mercury is released into the environment when blood-pressure monitors
break and spill their mercury. The cost of a proper cleanup of a spill is about
$35,000 per kilogram of mercury spilled. Alternatively, a switch to nonmer-
cury monitors would cost about $597 per kilogram of mercury avoided.
Many vehicles contain mercury in switches for lights and antilock braking
systems, and mercury is released when the vehicles are recycled and inciner-
ated. The cost of a system that prevents releases during incineration is about
$27,000 per kilogram of mercury captured. Alternatively, the cost of remov-
ing the switches prior to incineration is only about $590 per kilogram of mer-
cury captured.
The cost of reducing mercury emissions from power generation is about
$27,000 per kilogram avoided.

A voluntary exchange between two people makes both people better off.
Firms will buy and sell pollution permits only when an exchange will make both firms
better off. This happens when the firms have different abatement costs.
To illustrate the effects of marketable permits, let s return to the example of the
two electricity generators with different abatement costs shown in Table 31.1.
Suppose the government issues each firm one permit (one less than the initial level of
pollution). In other words, the government will reduce pollution by two tons. Can the
two firms make a deal for a permit?
Firm H is willing to pay a maximum of $5,000 for a permit because thats how
much it costs to abate a ton of pollution.
Firm L is willing to accept a minimum of $2,000 for a permit because thats how
much it costs to abate a ton of pollution.
Firm H is willing to pay up to $5,000 and firm L is willing to accept as little as $2,000,
so there is an opportunity for mutually beneficial exchange. If the two firms split
the difference, the price of a permit is $3,500, and each firm gains $1,500 from the
transaction. Firm H pays $3,500 to save $5,000 on abatement cost, for a savings of
$1,500. Firm L gets $3,500 but pays an additional $2,000 in abatement cost, for a ben-
efit of $1,500.
How does the marketability of permits affect the total cost of abatement? In our
example, the total cost with nonmarketable permits is $7,000, including $2,000 for
firm L and $5,000 for firm H. In contrast, when a single firm does all the abating, the
cost for two tons of abatement is $4,000 (two tons times $2,000 per ton). The savings
of $3,000 equals the gap between the abatement cost of the high-cost and low-cost
firm. Making the permits marketable exploits differences in abatement costs across
firms, so we get the same level of abatement at a lower total cost.
The first program of marketable pollution permits, started in 1976 by the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency, allowed limited trading of permits for several air-
borne pollutants. Trading was later extended to lead in gasoline (in 1985) and to the
chemicals responsible for the depletion of the ozone layer (in 1988).
The Clean Air Act of 1990 established a system of marketable pollution permits
(also known as allowances) for SO2. Under the cap-and-trade program, in 1990 the gov-
ernment issued permits for SO2 emissions based on a firms emission levels 10 years
earlier. Each company initially received enough permits to discharge between 50 and
70 percent of the volume it had discharged a decade earlier, and over time the number
of permits will decrease. Firms can also trade the permits. For example, if one firm has
an abatement cost of $140 and a second firm has an abatement cost of $180, the low-
cost firm could sell a permit to the high-cost firm at a price of $160, giving each firm a
benefit of $20: The low-cost firm gets $160 for a permit and incurs an abatement cost
of $140; the high-cost firm pays $160 for a permit but saves $180 in abatement cost. A
report from the National Acid Precipitation Assessment Program (NAPAP) showed
that being able to buy and sell permits lowered firms  total cost of abatement by 15 to
20 percent.
Each year the Environmental Protection Agency issues permits to existing SO2
sources but withholds some for auction on the Chicago Board of Trade. In 2008, a
total of 125,000 permits were auctioned at an average price of $390 per ton.
Individuals and environmental groups are allowed to buy the permits and, if they wish,
reduce pollution by withdrawing them from the market. In 2001 a total of 31 permits
went to schools and environmental groups.

Supply, Demand, and the Price of Marketable Permits
We can use a model of supply and demand to represent the market for pollution per-
mits. Figure 31.5 depicts a trading system introduced in the Los Angeles basin for
smog pollutants such as NOx. The supply curve for permits is vertical at the fixed
number of permits provided by the government. The demand for permits comes from
firms that can use a permit to avoid paying for pollution abatement, and the willing-
ness to pay for a permit equals the savings in abatement costs. In Figure 31.5 the
demand curve for permits is negatively sloped, meaning that the larger the number of
permits available, the lower the willingness to pay for a permit. This is sensible
because with more permits and pollution, the marginal cost of abatement will be rela-
tively low. With a fixed supply of 100 permits in 1994, the equilibrium price, shown by
the intersection of the demand curve and the 1994 supply curve at point a, is $7.

The Market for Pollution Permits
The equilibrium price of permits is shown by the intersection of the demand curve and the vertical
supply curve. The supply curve is vertical because each year the government specifies a fixed num-
ber of permits. A decrease in the number of permits shifts the supply curve to the left, increasing the
equilibrium price.
Under Los Angeless smog program, the number of NOx permits decreased each
year, and in 2003 reached its goal of cutting NOx discharges to 30 percent of the level
attained nine years earlier.2 In Figure 31.5, the decrease in the number of permits from
100 to 30 shifts the supply curve to the left, increasing the equilibrium price of permits
from $7 at point a to $21 at point b. Polluters in Los Angeles responded to the higher
permit prices by abating more. The Los Angeles Department of Water and Power
installed abatement equipment
at a cost of $40 million
because abatement was
cheaper than buying pollution permits. Libbey Glass Company installed low-pollution
burners in its plant, dropping its emissions below the volume allowed by its permits.
The company sold its extra permits to other firms, generating income for Libbey. The
firms that bought the permits from Libbey were able to continue production using
their existing abatement equipment.
How do technological advances in abatement technology affect the price of pollu-
tion permits? A pollution permit allows a firm to avoid paying for abatement, and the
higher the abatement cost that can be avoided, the larger the amount a firm is willing

673
PART 10
to pay for a permit. A technological innovation that decreases abatement costs will
encourage firms to use the new technology to abate pollution rather than buying per-
mits that allow pollution. As a result, the demand curve for permits shifts downward
and to the left, and the equilibrium price of permits decreases.
EXTERNAL COSTS FROM AUTOMOBILES
The use of automobiles generates three types of external costs. First, as we saw in
Chapter 1, a person who uses a congested highway slows down other travelers, impos-
ing time costs on other people. Second, automobiles generate air pollution, so drivers
impose external costs on people sensitive to air pollutants. The third externality is
motor-vehicle accidents
collisions with other vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. In
this part of the chapter, we ll explore various policy responses to these externalities.
External Costs from Pollution
Ozone pollution, more commonly known as smog, is one of our most persistent envi-
ronmental problems. Smog results from the mixing of several pollutants, including
nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and volatile organic compounds. Smog causes health
problems, triggering asthma attacks in the 15 million people in the United States who
suffer from asthma and causing other respiratory problems, leading to premature
deaths. Smog also retards plant growth and decreases agricultural productivity.
Because of health and other problems created by smog, the EPA has established stan-
dards for smog concentrations in urban areas. Nonetheless, in many cities ozone pol-
lution levels rise above these healthful levels.
The Breathmobile provides a visible reminder of the health effects of smog.
Started in Los Angeles in 2000, the mobile asthma clinic, housed in a 34-foot recre-
ational vehicle, provides free diagnosis and treatment for asthmatic schoolchildren.
The clinic identifies and treats children who experience aggravated asthma symptoms

WEATHER AND THE PRICE OF POLLUTION PERMITS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: How is the price of pollution
permits determined?
The European Climate exchange is a market for the CO2 allowances issued to
European Union (EU) countries under the EU cap-and-trade system. The equilib-
rium price of an allowance is determined by the interplay of supply and demand. The
EU determines the total quantity of allowances issued, and distributes the allowances
to organizations in the energy-intensive industries, including iron and steel produc-
tion, building materials, pulp and paper, electricity generators, and heat generators.
The demand for the allowances is determined by a number of factors, including the
level of economic activity, fuel prices, and the weather.
The Nordic countries rely heavily on hydroelectric power to generate electricity.
In a dry year, the amount of power generated by hydroelectric plants is relatively low,
and the Nordic countries shift to coal-fired plants. For example, in the exceptionally
dry year of 1996, the emissions from power and heat generation in Denmark were
roughly 70 percent higher than the emissions in 1990, a relatively wet year. A dry year
will generate a relatively high demand for CO2 emissions and thus increase the equi-
librium price of the allowances. Related to Exercises 4.5 and 4.10.

on smoggy days. The Breathmobile program started in low-income neighborhoods
and has since spread to other cities.3
The automobile is by far the biggest source of smog-causing pollutants. We cur-
rently use a command-and-control approach to regulate automobile pollution: The
EPA tells automakers what abatement equipment to install in cars. The equipment
does not control the total emissions of the car, just the pollution per mile driven. If peo-
ple buy cleaner cars but then drive more miles, total emissions can actually increase.
The economic approach to air pollution is to internalize the external cost with a
pollution tax. Under such a tax, a car owner would have the car tested at the end of the
year to determine how much pollution it generated per mile and then pay a tax equal
to the miles driven times the external cost per mile. For example, if the external cost
for a particular car is $0.02 per mile and the mileage for the year is 10,000 miles, the
pollution tax for the year would be $200. The pollution tax would encourage people to
buy cleaner cars, maintain their emissions equipment, drive less, and use alternative
modes of transportation. The tax is consistent with the idea that people should pay the
full cost of driving their automobiles, including the external costs.
One alternative to a direct pollution tax on automobile travel is a gasoline tax.
According to a recent study, smog-related damages from automobiles average about
$0.02 per mile driven, which translates to an average of $0.40 per gallon of gasoline.4
Burning gasoline also contributes to global warming, and if the appropriate carbon tax
is $100 per ton of carbon, the associated gasoline tax would be about $0.28 per gallon.
Adding the $0.40 tax for smog damage and the $0.28 tax for global warming, the gaso-
line tax would be $0.68 per gallon. This tax would be added to the current gasoline
taxes (a federal tax of $0.18 and state taxes that average about $0.22), which pay for
highway construction and maintenance. A gasoline tax would be inferior to a real pol-
lution tax because a driver s gasoline tax bill would not depend directly on pollution,
so there would be less incentive to drive cleaner cars.
Figure 31.6 shows the market effects of a gasoline tax equal to $0.68 per gallon.
The tax shifts the supply curve upward by the amount of the tax, as shown by points a
and b. The new equilibrium is shown by point c, with an equilibrium price of $2.00 (up
from $1.60) and an equilibrium quantity of 80 million gallons (down from 100 million
gallons). The increase in price decreases the quantity demanded as consumers drive

The Market Effects of a Gasoline Tax
A gasoline tax of $0.68 per gallon shifts the supply curve upward by the amount of the tax and
increases the equilibrium price by $0.40. The tax is shifted forward onto consumers, who pay $0.40
more per gallon, and backward onto input suppliers, who receive lower prices for crude oil.

fewer miles, switch to alternative travel modes
bus, train, bicycle, walking
and
switch to more fuel-efficient cars.
The equilibrium price rises by $0.40, which is less than the $0.68 tax. As we saw
earlier in the book, a tax is shifted forward to consumers in the form of a price hike
($0.40 in this example) and backward onto input suppliers in the form of lower prices
for inputs. The decrease in the quantity of gasoline produced will decrease the
demand for crude oil, decreasing its price. In other words, part of the gasoline tax will
be borne by the people and governments who own crude oil.
External Costs from Congestion
As we saw in Chapter 1, the typical urban commuter wastes about 47 hours per year in
slow traffic and wastes $84 worth of fuel. The economic approach to congestion is to
internalize the external cost by imposing a tax on drivers equal to the external costs
they impose on others. To compute the appropriate tax per mile driven, we compute
the change in total travel time caused by one additional car on the highway and multi-
ply the change in travel time by the opportunity cost of travel time. For peak travel in
the typical large metropolitan areas, the external cost is about $0.21 per mile traveled,
so a commuter who makes a 10-mile trip during peak travel times would pay a conges-
tion tax of $2.10. During off-peak periods when highways are less crowded, the exter-
nal cost is much lower, around $0.04 per mile driven. When traffic volume is low
enough that everyone can travel at the legal speed limit, the external cost is zero, so
there would be no congestion tax.
Modern technology allows the efficient collection of congestion taxes. Under a
vehicle identification system (VIS), each car is equipped with a transponder
an elec-
tronic device that allows sensors along the road to identify a car as it passes. The system
records the number of times a vehicle uses a congested highway and sends a congestion
bill to the driver at the end of the month. For example, a driver who travels 10 miles

YOUNG DRIVERS AND COLLISIONS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #5: What is the external cost of young drivers?
A VMT tax of 4.4 cents per mile would internalize the external cost from collisions on
average, but the external cost varies with the age of the driver. As shown in Table 31.2,
the external cost of young drivers is over three times the external cost of middle-aged
drivers. A precise VMT tax would have higher tax rates for the drivers with higher
external cost. For example, the tax for young drivers would be 11 cents per mile, com-
pared to 3.4 cents per mile for a middle-aged driver. Such a tax would reduce the miles
driven by all drivers, but the reductions would be larger for young drivers, the group
with the highest collision rates and external costs.

along a congested highway 20 times per month would pay a monthly congestion bill of
$42.00 (20 times $2.10). The alternative approach is to use anonymous debit cards to
charge for driving on congested roads.
The use of congestion taxes and other time-sensitive pricing of highways is
spreading. Singapore uses Electronic Road Pricing (ERP), a debit-card system with
charges that increase with the level of congestion. In Toronto, users of the Express
Toll Road pay fees that depend on the distance traveled and time of day. The per-
kilometer toll is $0.10 (Canadian) during peak periods, $0.07 during other weekday
times, and $0.04 on the weekend. Along some highways in Southern California, driv-
ers can pay a fee to use lanes normally reserved for carpools. The toll varies in real
time  from $0.50 to $4.00, depending on the level of congestion, and is highest from
7 A.M. to 8 A.M. and 4 P.M. to 5 P.M.
External Costs from Collisions
A third externality from the use of the automobile comes from motor-vehicle accidents
collisions with other vehicles, bicycles, and pedestrians. In the United States, the annual
cost of property damage, injuries, and deaths from traffic collisions is about $300 billion
per year. About two-thirds of these costs are incurred by the driver who causes the acci-
dent, and the other third is borne by someone else. In other words, traffic collisions have
substantial external costs. On average, the collision-related external cost of travel is about
4.4 cents per mile driven. By way of comparison, the fuel cost per mile is about 10 to
15 cents. The direct approach to internalize this externality would be to impose a tax of
4.4 cents per vehicle-mile traveled, a VMT tax. Such a tax would improve traffic safety by
reducing the number of miles driven.
Consider two alternatives to the VMT tax. First, the premium for automobile
insurance could be based on miles driven rather than being a fixed amount per year. A
person who drove less would pay less for insurance, which is sensible because he or she
would be less likely to have an accident and impose an external cost on someone else.
Second, a gasoline tax could be imposed. The basic problem is that a persons gas-
tax bill depends on the amount of gasoline consumed, not the number of miles driven
and the external cost of collisions. Gas mileage varies across vehicles, and a person in
a car with better gas mileage would pay less than the external cost of collisions.
The theme of this chapter is
that the best way to control
pollution and other external
costs is to rely on the exchange
principle 
and 
markets. 
A
pollution tax internalizes the
external cost of pollution,
causing firms to cut the pollution per unit of output and con-
sumers to buy less of a polluting product. A cap-and-trade
system for emissions achieves a pollution target at the lowest
possible cost because the firms with the lowest cost do most of
the abatement. The external costs from automobiles could be
internalized with taxes on pollution, congestion, and miles
driven. Here are the main points of the chapter:
1 The optimum level of pollution abatement is where the mar-
ginal benefit equals the marginal cost.
2 A tax on the emissions of electricity generators decreases
total emissions as firms switch to cleaner fuels and con-
sumers buy less electricity at the higher price.
3 Compared to a pollution tax, traditional pollution regulations
lead to higher production costs and higher product prices.
4 Allowing firms to buy and sell pollution permits reduces
the cost of abatement because low-cost firms do more of
the abatement.
5 Urban smog is a continuing problem, in part because the tra-
ditional command-and-control policies are less effective than
an annual automobile pollution tax.
6 The external cost from traffic congestion could be internal-
ized with a tax that varies with the level of traffic congestion.
7 The external cost from traffic collisions could be internalized
with a tax that varies with the likelihood of causing a collision.

Reforestation versus Abatement. Suppose your firm
commits to reducing greenhouse gases by 11 tons per
year. You can pay for a reforestation project that offsets
your emissions at a cost of $7 per ton of carbon offset.
Or you can modify your production cost to abate pollu-
tion. Your marginal cost of abating the first ton is $3; the
marginal cost increases by $1 for each additional ton, to
$4 for the second ton, $5 for the third ton, and so on.

offsets and abatement?

(point b). Whats the new equilibrium price?

European Union. The supply of allowances is fixed,

Pollution Permits
In this pollution-permit experiment, students play the role
of paper firms that buy or sell pollution permits. The class is
divided into groups of three to five students, with each
group representing a firm that produces one ton of paper
per period. The instructor provides each firm with data
about its cost of production. The cost depends on how
much waste the firm generates: The smaller the volume of
waste, the higher the production cost. Here is an example:
Each firm receives three pollution permits for each of the five
trading periods. A firm that does not sell any of its permits to
other firms has the right to generate three gallons of waste in
that period. A firm that sells one of its three permits can gen-
erate only two gallons of waste, and a firm that buys a permit
from another firm can generate four gallons of waste.

At the beginning of each of the five trading periods,
firms meet in the trading area to buy or sell pollution

permits for that day. Each firm can buy or sell one permit
per day. Once a transaction has been arranged, the buyer
and the seller inform the instructor of the transaction,
record the transaction on their report cards, and then leave
the trading area. The firms objective is to maximize profit,
and in each trading period we compute the firms profit with
the following equation:
In each period, a firm will either buy or sell a permit, so we
compute the firm s profit with just three numbers. For
example, using the production cost numbers shown in the
table, if the price of paper is $50 per ton and a firm buys a
+  revenue from permit sold - cost of permit purchased
profit = price of paper - production cost
permit for $5 and generates four gallons of waste, the firms
profit is
If another firm sells a permit for $5 and generates two gal-
lons of waste, the firms profit is
For the fourth and fifth trading periods, several environ-
mental groups have the option of buying pollution per-
mits. Each environmental group is given a fixed sum of
money to spend on permits, and its objective is to get as
many permits as possible, reducing the total volume of
pollution in the process.
profit = $50 - $36 + $5 - 0 = $19
profit = $50 - $20 + 0 - $5 = $25

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
What is the monetary payoff from a college degree?
Among full-time workers in 2007, a college graduate
earned roughly twice as much as a high-school graduate.1
In other words, the college premium is roughly 100 percent.
The college premium is higher for men (111%) than for
women (89%). Looking back a few decades, the college
premium in 1972 was only 43 percent. These facts raise two
questions: First, why do college graduates earn so much
more than high-school graduates? Second, why did the
earnings gap almost double during the last three decades?

CHAPTER 32
THE LABOR MARKET, INCOME, AND POVERTY
682
U
p to this point in the book, we have discussed the markets for final goods and
services. In this chapter, we switch to the market for one of the factors of
production
labor. Labor costs are responsible for about three-fourths of
production costs, and for most people labor income is by far the most important
source of income. We ll use a model of demand and supply to see how wages are
determined and why wages differ between college graduates and high-school gradu-
ates, men and women, and people in different occupations. We ll also take a look at
the distribution of income and the problem of poverty.
THE DEMAND FOR LABOR
We can use demand and supply curves to show how wages are determined and exam-
ine how changes in the labor market affect wages and employment. We ll start with
the demand side of the labor market, looking first at how an individual firm can use
the key principles of economics to decide how many workers to hire.
The demand for labor and other productive inputs is different from the
demand for consumer products such as iPods, books, haircuts, and pizza. Firms use
workers to produce the products demanded by consumers, and so economists say
that labor demand is a derived demand.  That is, it is determined by, or derived
from, the demand for the products that workers produce. As we ll see in this chap-
ter, the demand for labor is determined by the demand for consumer products and
the price of those products.
Labor Demand by an Individual Firm in the Short Run
Consider a perfectly competitive firm that produces rubber balls. Because this firm is
perfectly competitive, it takes the price of its output and the prices of its inputs as
given. Because it hires a tiny fraction of the workers in the labor market, it takes the
market wage as given and can hire as many workers as it wants at that wage. In addi-
tion, the firm produces a tiny fraction of the rubber balls sold in the market, so it takes
the price of its output as given. Lets say the price of rubber balls is $0.50.
Consider the firms hiring decision in the short run, defined as the period during
which at least one input
for example, its factory
cannot be changed. We can use
two of the key principles of economics to explain the firms hiring decision. Recall the
marginal principle.
M A R G I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds its
marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal benefit equals the
marginal cost.
The firm will pick the quantity of labor at which the marginal benefit of labor equals
the marginal cost of labor. It can hire as many workers as it wants at the market wage,
so the marginal cost of labor equals the hourly wage. If the wage is $8 per hour, the
extra cost associated with one more hour of labor
the marginal cost
is $8, regard-
less of how many workers the firm hires.
What is the marginal benefit of labor? The firm hires labor to produce balls, so
the marginal benefit equals the monetary value of the balls produced with an addi-
tional hour of labor. Table 32.1 shows how to compute the marginal benefit associated
with different quantities of labor. The first two columns show the relationship
between the number of workers and the quantity of balls produced. Recall the princi-
ple of diminishing returns.

Suppose that output is produced with two or more inputs and we increase
one input while holding the other inputs fixed. Beyond some point
called
the point of diminishing returns
output will increase at a decreasing rate.
As we saw earlier in the book, the marginal product of labor, the change in out-
put from one additional unit of labor, typically rises for the first few workers and then
eventually decreases. To simplify matters, we ll assume diminishing returns start to
occur with the second worker. As shown in the third column of Table 32.1, the mar-
ginal product of labor decreases as the number of workers increases, from 26 for the
first worker, to 24 for the second worker, and so on.
The marginal benefit of labor equals the marginal-revenue product of labor
(MRP), which is defined as the extra revenue generated by one additional unit of
labor. To compute the MRP, we multiply the marginal product of labor by the price of
output ($0.50 per ball in this example):
Figure 32.1 shows the marginal-revenue product curve. Because the marginal product
drops as the number of workers increases, the MRP curve is negatively sloped, falling
from $11 for the third worker (point a) to $8 for the fifth worker (point b), and so on.

The Marginal Principle and the
Firm s Demand for Labor
Using the marginal principle, the firm
picks the quantity of workers at which
the marginal benefit (the marginal-
revenue product of labor) equals the
marginal cost (the wage). The firm s
short-run demand curve for labor is the
marginal-revenue product curve.

A firm can use its MRP curve to decide how much labor to hire at a particular
wage. In Figure 32.1, the marginal-cost curve is horizontal at the market wage ($8).
The perfectly competitive firm takes the wage as given, so the marginal-cost curve is
also the labor-supply curve faced by the firm. The marginal principle is satisfied at
point b, where the marginal cost equals the marginal-revenue product. The firm will
hire five workers because for the first five workers, the marginal benefit (the MRP) is
greater than or equal to the marginal cost (the $8 wage). It would not be sensible to
hire another worker, because the additional revenue from the sixth worker ($6) would
be less than the $8 additional cost of that worker. If the wage increases to $11, the firm
will satisfy the marginal principle at point a, hiring only three workers.
The MRP curve is also the firms short-run demand curve for labor, which shows
the relationship between the wage and the quantity of labor demanded in the short run,
when the firm cannot change its production facility. The demand curve answers the fol-
lowing question: At each wage, how many workers does the firm want to hire? We ve
already used the MRP curve to answer this question for two different wages ($11 and
$8), and we can do the same for any other wage. Because the MRP curve is a marginal-
benefit curve, and the firm uses the marginal principle to decide how much labor to hire,
the MRP curve is the same as the firms demand curve for labor. If you pick a wage, the
MRP curve tells you exactly how much labor the firm will demand at that wage.
What sorts of changes would cause the demand curve to shift? To draw the labor-
demand curve, we fix the price of the output and the productivity of workers.
Therefore, an increase in the price of the output will increase the MRP of workers,
shifting the entire demand curve for labor to the right: At each wage, the firm will hire
more workers. This is shown in Figure 32.2. An increase in the price of balls shifts the
labor-demand curve to the right. At a wage of $8, the firm hires seven workers instead
of five. Similarly, if workers become more productive, the increase in the marginal prod-
uct of labor will increase the MRP and shift the demand curve to the right. Conversely,
a decrease in price or labor productivity will shift the demand curve to the left.

An Increase in the Price of Output
Shifts the Labor-Demand Curve
An increase in the price of the good
produced by workers increases the mar-
ginal revenue product at each quantity
of workers, shifting the demand curve
to the right. At each wage, the firm will
demand more workers. For example, at
a wage of $8, the demand for labor
increases from five workers (point b) to
seven workers (point d).
Market Demand for Labor in the Short Run
To draw the short-run market demand curve for labor, we add the labor demands of all
the firms that use a particular type of labor. In the simplest case, all firms are identical,
and we simply multiply the number of firms by the quantity of labor demanded by the
typical firm. If there were 100 firms and each hired 5 workers at a wage of $8, the mar-
ket demand for labor would be 500 workers. Similarly, if the typical firm hired 3 work-
ers at a wage of $11, the market demand would be 300 workers.

685
PART 11
Labor Demand in the Long Run
Recall that in the long run, firms can enter or leave the market and firms already in the
market can change all their inputs, including their production facilities. The long-run
demand curve for labor shows the relationship between the wage and the quantity of
labor demanded over the long run, when the number of firms in the market can
change and firms in the market can modify their production facilities.
Although there are no diminishing returns in the long run, the market demand
curve is still negatively sloped. As the wage increases, the quantity of labor demanded
decreases for two reasons:
The output effect. An increase in the wage will increase the cost of produc-
ing balls, and firms will pass on at least part of the higher labor cost to their
consumers: Prices will increase. According to the law of demand, firms will
sell fewer balls at the higher price, so they will need less of all inputs, includ-
ing labor.
The input-substitution effect. An increase in the wage will cause the firm to
substitute other inputs for labor. At a wage of $4, it may not be sensible to use
much machinery in the ball factory, but at a wage of $20, it may be sensible to
mechanize the factory, using more machinery and fewer workers. This substitu-
tion of other inputs for labor decreases the labor input per unit of output.
The input-substitution effect decreases the labor input per unit of output while the
output effect decreases total output. The two effects operate in the same direction, so
the market demand curve is negatively sloped.
The notion of input substitution applies to other labor markets as well. For the
most graphic examples of factor substitution, we can travel from a developed country,
such as the United States, Canada, France, Germany, or Japan, to a less-developed
country in South America, Africa, or Asia. Wages are much lower in the less-developed
countries, so production tends to be more labor intensive. In other words, labor is less
costly relative to machinery and equipment, so labor is substituted for these other
inputs. Here are some examples:
Mining. U.S. firms use huge earthmoving equipment to mine for minerals; firms
in some less-developed countries use thousands of workers digging by hand.
Furniture. Firms in developed countries manufacture furniture with sophisti-
cated machinery and equipment; firms in some less-developed countries make
furniture by hand.
Accounting. Accountants in developed countries use computers and sophisti-
cated software programs; some accountants in less-developed countries use sim-
ple calculators and ledger paper.
Short-Run versus Long-Run Demand
How does the short-run demand curve for labor compare to the long-run demand
curve? There is less flexibility in the short run because firms cannot enter or leave the
market and they cannot modify their production facilities. As a result, the demand for
labor is less elastic in the short run. That means the short-run demand curve is steeper
than the long-run demand curve. In the chapter on perfect competition we used the
same logic to explain why the short-run supply curve for a product (plain cotton
T-shirts) was steeper than the long-run supply curve for the product.
THE SUPPLY OF LABOR
The labor-supply curve answers the following question: How many hours of labor
will be supplied at each wage? When we speak of a labor market, we are referring to
the market for a specific occupation in a specific geographical area. Consider the

supply for nurses in the hypothetical city of Florence. The supply question is How
many hours of nursing services will be supplied at each wage? To answer that ques-
tion, we must think about how many nurses are in the city and how many hours each
nurse works.
The Individual Labor-Supply Decision: How Many Hours?
Let s start with an individual s decision about how many hours to work. The deci-
sion to work is a decision to sacrifice some leisure time for money: Each hour of
work reduces leisure time by one hour. Therefore, the demand for leisure is the flip
side of the supply of labor. The price of leisure time is the income sacrificed for
each hour of leisure, that is, the hourly wage. We know from earlier chapters that
an increase in the price of a good has two effects: a substitution effect and an
income effect. An increase in the wage
the price of leisure
has two effects on the
demand for leisure.
Consider first the substitution effect for leisure demand. The worker faces a
trade-off between leisure time and consumer goods such as music, books, food, and
entertainment. For each hour of leisure time Leah takes, she loses one hour of work
time, and her income drops by an amount equal to the wage. Therefore, she has less
money to spend on consumer goods. For example, if the wage is $8 per hour, each
hour of leisure decreases the amount of income available to spend on consumer
goods by $8. When the wage increases to, say, $10, Leah will sacrifice more
income
and consumer goods
for each hour of leisure she takes. Given the larger
sacrifice of consumer goods per hour of leisure time, she will demand less leisure.
That means she will work more hours and earn more money for consumer goods. In
other words, as the wage increases, she will substitute income
and the consumer
goods it buys
for leisure time.
Consider next the income effect for leisure demand. For most people, leisure is
a normal good in the sense that the demand for leisure increases as real income
increases. An increase in the wage increases Leahs real income in the sense that she can
afford more of all goods, including leisure time. Suppose Leah has a total of 100 hours
per week to divide between leisure and work. At a wage of $10, she works 36 hours and
has 64 hours of leisure. She also earns $360 ($10 per hour times 36 hours of work) and
spends that amount on consumer goods. If her wage increases to $15, her real income
increases because she can have more consumer goods and more leisure time. For exam-
ple, if she worked only 30 hours, she could buy $450 worth of consumer goods ($15 per
hour times 30 hours) and have 70 hours of leisure (100 hours per week minus 30 hours
of work). The increase in real income causes Leah to consume more of all normal
goods, including leisure time. The increase in real income causes her to demand more
leisure and supply less labor.
In the labor market, the income and substitution effects of an increase in wages
operate in opposite directions. The substitution effect decreases the desired leisure
time, while the income effect increases the desired leisure time. Therefore, we can t
predict whether an increase in the wage will cause a worker to demand more leisure
time (supply less labor) or less leisure (supply more labor).
An Example of Income and Substitution Effects
A simple example will show why we can t predict a worker s response to an increase in
the wage. Suppose each nurse in Florence initially works 36 hours per week at an
hourly wage of $10 and the wage increases to $12. The following are three reasonable
responses to the higher wage:
1 Lester works fewer hours. If Lester works 30 hours instead of 36 hours, he gets
6 hours of extra leisure time and still earns the same income per week ($360 =
30 hours * $12 per hour).

PART 11
2 Sam works the same number of hours. If Sam continues to work 36 hours per week,
he gets an additional $72 of income ($2 per hour * 36 hours) and the same
amount of leisure time.
3 Maureen works more hours. If Maureen works 43 hours instead of 36 hours, she
sacrifices 7 hours of leisure time but earns a total of $516, compared to only $360
at a wage of $10 per hour.
Empirical studies of the labor market confirm that each of these responses is reason-
able. When the wage increases, some people work more, others work less, and others
work about the same amount. At the market level, the aggregate response to an
increase in the wage varies across markets.
The Market Supply Curve for Labor
Now that we know how individual workers respond to changes in wages, we re ready to
consider the supply side of the labor market. The market supply curve for labor shows
the relationship between the wage and the quantity of labor supplied. In Figure 32.3, the
market supply curve for labor is positively sloped, consistent with the law of supply:
There is a positive relationship between the wage (the price of labor) and the quantity of
labor supplied, ceteris paribus. An increase in the wage affects the quantity of nursing sup-
plied in three ways:
1 Hours worked per employee. When the wage increases, some nurses will work
more hours, some will work fewer hours, and some will work the same number of
hours. We don t know for certain whether the average number of work hours will
increase, decrease, or stay the same, but the change in the average number of
hours worked is likely to be relatively small.
2 Occupational choice. An increase in the nursing wage will cause some workers to
switch from other occupations to nursing and motivate more new workers to pick
nursing over other occupations.
3 Migration. Some nurses in other cities will move to Florence to earn the higher
wages offered there.

A P P L I C AT I O N 1
CABBIES RESPOND TO AN INCREASE IN THE WAGE
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: When the wage increases, will the typical
person work more hours or fewer hours?
Taxi drivers have a lot of flexibility in choosing their work hours, and we can readily
observe their response to an increase in the wage. An increase in the taxi fare, which is
regulated by cities, represents an increase in the wage earned by taxi drivers. A recent
study of the taxi market in New York City shows that an increase in the regulated fare (an
increase in the wage) actually decreases the quantity of labor supplied. In 2004 a 19 per-
cent increase in the regulated fare decreased the miles driven per cabbie by 5.6 percent.
Overall, the elasticity of miles driven (quantity of labor supplied) with respect to the fare
per mile (the wage) is 0.22. In other words, a 10 percent increase in the wage decreases
the quantity of labor supplied by 2.2 percent.

CHAPTER 32
THE LABOR MARKET, INCOME, AND POVERTY
688
The second and third effects reinforce one another, so an increase in the wage causes
movement upward along the market supply curve. If the wage of Florence nurses increases
from $10 to $15 per hour, the quantity of nurses supplied increases from 8,000 hours per
day (point b) to 16,000 hours per day (point a). Although individual workers may not work
more hours as the wage increases, the supply curve is positively sloped because an increase
in the wage changes workers  occupational choices and causes migration.
LABOR MARKET EQUILIBRIUM
We re ready to put demand and supply together to think about equilibrium in the
labor market. A market equilibrium is a situation in which there is no pressure to
change the price of a good or service. Figure 32.3 shows the equilibrium in the market
for nurses. The supply curve intersects the demand curve at point a, so the equilib-
rium wage is $15 per hour and the equilibrium quantity is 16,000 hours of nursing per
day. At this wage, there is neither an excess demand for labor nor an excess supply of
labor, so the market has reached an equilibrium.
Changes in Demand and Supply
How would a change in the demand for nurses affect the equilibrium wage of nurses?
We know from Chapter 4 that a change in demand causes the equilibrium price and the
equilibrium quantity to move in the same direction: An increase in demand increases the
equilibrium price and quantity, whereas a decrease in demand decreases the equilibrium
price and quantity. For example, suppose the demand for medical care increases. Nurses
help to provide medical care, so an increase in the quantity of medical care demanded
will shift the demand curve for nurses to the right: At each wage, firms will demand
more hours of nursing services. As shown in Figure 32.4, an increase in demand
increases the equilibrium wage and the equilibrium quantity of nursing services.
How would a change in supply of nurses affect the equilibrium wage of nurses?
We know from Chapter 4 that a change in supply causes price and quantity to move in
opposite directions: An increase in supply decreases the equilibrium price but
increases the equilibrium quantity, whereas a decrease in supply increases the equilib-
rium price but decreases the equilibrium quantity. Suppose a new television program
makes nursing look like an attractive occupation, causing a large number of young
people to become nurses rather than accountants, lawyers, or doctors. The supply
curve for nurses will shift to the right: At each wage, more nursing hours will be sup-
plied. The equilibrium wage will decrease, and the equilibrium quantity will increase.

16,000 hours to 19,000 hours.
The Market Effects of the Minimum Wage
We can use the model of the labor market to show how various public policies, such as
the federally mandated minimum wage, affect total employment. In July 2008 the fed-
eral minimum wage was $6.55 per hour. Figure 32.5 shows the effects of a minimum
wage on the market for restaurant workers. The market equilibrium is shown by point
a: The supply of restaurant workers equals demand at a wage of $5.45 and a quantity
of 50,000 worker hours per day. Suppose a minimum wage is established at $6.55 per
hour. At this wage, the quantity of labor demanded is only 49,000 hours (point b on
the demand curve). In other words, the minimum wage decreases the quantity of labor
restaurants use by 1,000 hours per day.

The Market Effects of a
Minimum Wage
The market equilibrium is shown by point
a: The wage is $5.45 per hour, and the
quantity of labor is 50,000 hours. A mini-
mum wage of $6.55 decreases the quan-
tity of labor demanded to 49,000 hours
per day (point b). Although some workers
receive a higher wage, others lose their
jobs or work fewer hours.
What are the trade-offs associated with the minimum wage? For restaurant work-
ers and restaurant diners, there is good news and bad news:
Good news for some restaurant workers. Some workers keep their jobs and
receive a higher wage ($6.55 per hour instead of $5.45 per hour).
Bad news for some restaurant workers. Some workers lose their jobs. If the typ-
ical workday for restaurant workers is 5 hours, the loss of 1,000 hours of restau-
rant work per day translates into a loss of 200 jobs.
Bad news for diners. The increase in the wage increases the cost of producing
restaurant meals, increasing the price of meals.

CHAPTER 32
THE LABOR MARKET, INCOME, AND POVERTY

There are winners and losers from the minimum wage. Workers who keep their
jobs gain at the expense of other workers and at the expense of diners. A recent study
suggests that a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage decreases the number of
minimum wage jobs by about 1 percent.2
EXPLAINING DIFFERENCES IN WAGES AND
INCOME
Now that we know how the equilibrium wage for a particular occupation is deter-
mined, we re ready to explain why wages vary from one job to another. Let s think
about why some occupations pay more than others, why women earn less than men,
and why college graduates earn more than high-school graduates.
Why Do Wages Differ across Occupations?
There is substantial variation in wages across occupations. Most professional athletes
earn more than medical doctors, who earn more than college professors, who earn
more than janitors. We ll see that the wage for a particular occupation will be high if

TRADE-OFFS FROM IMMIGRATION
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: Who benefits from the immigration of low-
skilled workers?
Since about 1850, international migration has played an important role in labor mar-
kets. In the first wave of immigration, from 1850 to 1913, over a million people
migrated to the Americas each year. Most were from European countries. After sev-
eral decades of war and economic depressions, massive immigration resumed in 1945,
and most of the immigrants were from less-developed countries. The most recent
wave of immigration started in 1990 and has increased the supply of labor to the U.S.
economy by about 10 percent per decade.
Immigration creates winners and losers within the economy. The increase in the
supply of labor decreases wages for the native workers who have the same skill level as
the immigrants. Because the average U.S. immigrant has less education and earns less
income than the average native, immigrants compete with low-skill natives, decreas-
ing their wages. On the benefit side, the decrease in the wages of low-skill labor
decreases production costs and product prices, so consumers benefit. In general, we
expect low-skill workers to lose as a result of immigration because the lower wages
will dominate the benefits of lower consumer prices. In contrast, we expect high-skill
workers to benefit from lower prices.
Economists have estimated the net effect of immigration on the U.S. economy.
George Borjas shows that immigration to the United States has a small positive effect,
with the losses in wages of low-skilled workers more than offset by gains to consumers
and firms. This conclusion is consistent with the idea that exchange increases effi-
ciency and the size of the overall economic pie. Studies of the most recent wave of
immigration suggest that immigration decreases the wages of high-school dropouts
and other low-skilled workers.

PART 11
the supply of workers in that occupation is small relative to the demand for those
workers. This is shown in Figure 32.6, where the supply curve intersects the demand
curve at a high wage. The supply of workers in a particular occupation could be small
for four reasons:
1 Few people with the required skills. To play professional baseball, people must
be able to hit balls thrown at them at about 90 miles per hour. The few people
who have this skill are paid a lot of money, because baseball owners compete with
one another for skillful players, bidding up the wage. The same logic applies to
other professional athletes, musicians, and actors. The few people who have the
skills required for these occupations are paid high wages.
2 High training costs. The skills required for some occupations can be acquired
only through education and training. For example, the skills required of a med-
ical doctor call for medical school training, and legal skills must be acquired in
law school. If it is costly to acquire these skills, a relatively small number of peo-
ple will become skilled, and they will receive high wages. The higher wage com-
pensates workers for their training costs.
3 Undesirable working conditions. Some occupations have undesirable working
conditions, and workers demand higher wages as compensation. Wages are
higher for jobs that are dirty or stressful or require people to work at odd hours.
4 Danger. Some jobs are dangerous, and wages are higher to compensate for the
risk of injury or death. The workers with the greatest risk of losing their lives on
the job are lumberjacks, boilermakers, taxicab drivers, and mine workers. To com-
pensate for the higher risk of getting killed on the job, steelworkers receive a wage
premium of 3.7 percent. In the United States, the average job fatality rate is 1 in
25,000 workers per year. For a worker who faces twice the average fatality rate, the
wage is about 1 percent higher. The wage premium for jobs with an annual injury
rate of 2 percent is 1.15 percent for men and 3.68 percent for women.3
5 Artificial barriers to entry. As we ll see in the next chapter, government and
professional licensing boards restrict the number of people in certain occupa-
tions, and labor unions restrict their membership. These supply restrictions
increase wages.

The Gender Pay Gap
Why do women, on average, earn less than men? In the United States in 2008, the
typical woman earned about 80 percent as much as the typical man.4 A recent study
explored several factors that contribute to the gender pay gap.5 The study observed a

CHAPTER 32
THE LABOR MARKET, INCOME, AND POVERTY
692
gap of about 20 percent among workers aged 26 to 34, and identified four factors that
contribute to the gender gap:
Difference in worker skills and productivity. On average, women have less edu-
cation and work experience, so they are less productive and thus receive lower
wages. An important factor in the lower level of work experience among women
is that many women interrupt their careers to raise children. The study con-
cluded that lower productivity is the most important factor in the gender gap.
Differences in occupational preferences. Wages vary across occupations:
Clerical and service occupations receive lower wages than craft and professional
occupations. Compared to men, women express stronger preferences for low-
wage occupations, such as clerical and service occupations, and weaker prefer-
ences for some high-wage occupations, such as craft and operator occupations.
In contrast, men have slightly stronger preferences for high-wage professional
and technical occupations. On balance, the general orientation of women
toward low-wage occupations contributes to the gender gap.
Occupational discrimination. Given the variation in wages across occupations,
if employers have a bias against hiring women for high-paying occupations,
women will receive lower wages. The study shows that on average, women are
less successful than men in attaining their desired occupations, and this occupa-
tional discrimination by employers explains between 7 and 25 percent of the
gender gap.
Wage discrimination. If employers pay women less than their equally produc-
tive male counterparts, womens wages will be lower. The results of the study on
this issue are mixed, with some evidence that wage discrimination is a signifi-
cant factor in the gender pay gap.
The general conclusion of the study is that differences in productivity and occupa-
tional status are the most important factors in the gender pay gap. It appears that the
relatively large number of women in low-paying occupations results both from the
occupational preferences of women and employer discrimination that inhibits occupa-
tional attainment for women.
Racial Discrimination
What about differences in earnings by race? In 2008 African-American males who
worked full-time earned 73 percent as much as their white counterparts earned, while
African-American females earned 85 percent as much as their white counterparts.
Hispanic males earned 65 percent as much as white males, while Hispanic females
earned 78 percent as much as white females.6 For both males and females, part of the
earnings gap is caused by differences in productivity: On average, whites have more
education and work experience, so they are paid higher wages. However, part of the
wage gap is caused by racial discrimination. Some African-American and Hispanic
workers are paid lower wages for similar jobs, and others are denied opportunities to
work in some high-paying jobs.
How much of the earnings gap is caused by discrimination? Recent studies sug-
gest that racial discrimination decreases the wages of African-American men by about
13 percent and that these earnings differences have decreased over the last few
decades and are now small enough that most of the disparity in earnings between
blacks and whites in the labor market of the 1990s is due to the differences in skills
they bring to the market, and not to discrimination within the labor market. 7 The
differences in skills brought to the labor market are caused by a number of factors,
including past discrimination that has inhibited the acquisition of job skills and differ-
ences in educational opportunities. For example, in urban areas about one-third of
African-American high-school students have above-average scores on reading and
math exams, compared to about two-thirds of white students.

693
PART 11
Why Do College Graduates Earn Higher Wages?
In 2007 the typical college graduate earned roughly twice as much as the typical high-
school graduate. There are two explanations for the college premium.
The first explanation is based on supply and demand analysis. A college education
provides the skills necessary to enter certain occupations, so a college graduate has
more job options than a high-school graduate. Both high-school grads and college
grads can fill jobs that require only a high-school education, so the supply of workers
for these low-skill jobs is plentiful, and the equilibrium wage for these jobs is low. In
contrast, there is a smaller supply of workers for jobs that require a college education,
so the wages in these high-skill jobs are higher than the wages for low-skill jobs. This
is the learning effect of a college education: College students learn the skills required
for certain occupations, increasing their human capital.
The second explanation of the college premium requires a different perspective on
college and its role in the labor market. Suppose certain skills are required for a particular
job, but an employer cannot determine whether a prospective employee has these skills.
For example, most managerial jobs require the employee to manage time efficiently, but it
is impossible for an employer to determine whether a prospective employee is a good
manager of time. Suppose that these skills are also required to complete a college degree.
For example, to get passing grades in all your classes, you must be able to use your time
efficiently. When you get a college degree, firms will conclude that you have some of the
skills they require, so they may hire you instead of a high-school graduate. This is the
signaling effect of a college education: People who complete college provide a signal to
employers about their skills. This second explanation suggests that colleges simply provide
a testing ground where students can reveal their skills to potential employers.
Over the last three decades, this wage gap, or college premium,  has almost dou-
bled. The most important factor in doubling the college premium is technological

A P P L I C AT I O N 3
THE BEAUTY PREMIUM
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: What explains differences in wages?
How does physical attractiveness affect earnings? Studies of the U.S. labor market
show that beautiful people earn more than people of average looks, and unattractive
people earn less. The beauty premium is 5 percent for the 33 percent of workers who
are considered beautiful or handsome, and the beauty premium is larger for men than
for women. The penalty for bad looks is about 8 percent for the 10 percent of workers
who are considered plain or unattractive. The beauty premium and the plain penalty
have been observed in other countries and within specific occupations such as lawyers.
Why do beautiful people earn more income? According to biologists, beauty is a
marker for underlying characteristics such as health and intelligence, and beautiful
people start with a slight edge in the labor market. Beautiful people get more oppor-
tunities to learn through experience, and they also acquire better professional con-
tacts. Because of these wider opportunities, a small difference in innate characteristics
can be amplified into a large difference in earnings. Another factor in the beauty pre-
mium is that some workers and consumers simply like dealing with attractive people,
so there is a higher demand for beautiful workers, resulting in higher wages.

change. Changes in technology have increased the demand for college graduates rela-
tive to the demand for other workers. In all sectors of the economy, firms are switch-
ing to sophisticated machinery and equipment that require highly skilled workers.
Consequently, the share of jobs that require a college education has increased steadily,
increasing the demand for college graduates. Of course, the supply of college gradu-
ates has increased, too, but not by as much as demand. Because the increase in demand
is large relative to the increase in supply, the wages of college graduates have
increased. Another factor in the growing college premium is the pace of technological
change. Workers with more education can more easily learn new skills and new jobs,
so firms are willing to pay more for college graduates.
THE DISTRIBUTION OF INCOME
In 2004 the median household income in the United States was $48,201
half of
households earned more income and half earned less. There is substantial variation in
household income, with some households earning much more and others earning
much less. In this part of the chapter, we ll discuss the extent of income inequality in
the United States and explore some of the reasons why the households with the high-
est income are receiving a larger share of total income.
Income Distribution Facts
Income can be measured in different ways, and two income measures are relevant for
our discussion. Market income is defined as all earnings received from labor and capital
markets. It includes wages and salaries, as well as earnings from bonds, stocks, and real
estate. Disposable income equals market income, plus government transfers, minus taxes
paid. The transfers include income supplements, Social Security payments, food
stamps, and housing assistance. The taxes include state and federal income and payroll
taxes, as well as local property taxes.
Table 32.2 shows the distributions of income before and after the effects of gov-
ernment transfer programs and taxes. To compute the numbers in the second column
of the table (Percent of Market Income), we take four steps:
1 Rank the nations households according to market income: The household with
the highest income is at the top of the list, and the household with the lowest
income is at the bottom of the list.
2 Divide the households into five groups, or quintiles : The lowest fifth includes
the poorest 20 percent of households (the lowest 20% of the list); the second fifth
is the next poorest 20 percent, and so on.
3 Compute each group s income by adding up the income received by all the
households in the group.
4 Compute each group s percentage of total income (the number in the third col-
umn of the table) by dividing the groups income by the nations total income.

PART 11
By repeating this process for disposable income, we can compute the numbers in the
third column of the table.
Consider first the distribution of market income, shown in the second column of
Table 32.2. The lowest fifth earns only 1.50 percent of the total market income, while
the highest fifth earns over half the total market income. If we combine the lowest two
fifths, the lowest 40 percent of households earn 8.76 percent of total market income.
Three key factors explain these substantial differences in market income:
1 Differences in labor skills and effort. Some people have better labor skills
more human capital
than others, so they earn higher wages. Labor skills are
determined by innate ability and education. In addition, some people work
longer hours or at more demanding jobs, so they earn more income.
2 Luck and misfortune. Some people are luckier than others in investing their
money, starting a business, or picking an occupation. Among the unlucky people
are those who develop health problems that make it difficult to earn income.
Among the lucky people are those who inherit wealth and earn income by invest-
ing their inheritance.
3 Discrimination. Some people are paid lower wages or have limited opportuni-
ties for education and work because of their race or gender.
Consider next the distribution of disposable income, which includes the effects of
government redistribution and tax polices. Going from market income to disposable
income, the largest changes occur at the top and the bottom of the income distribu-
tion. The share of the lowest fifth increases by about 3 percentage points, while the
share of the highest fifth decreases by about 7 percentage points. In other words, gov-
ernment transfer and tax policies reduce income inequality.
Recent Changes in the Distribution of Income
Table 32.3 shows the changes in the distribution of money income (total pretax cash
income) between 1970 and 2005. The share of the top fifth rose from 43 to 51 per-
cent, while the share of every other group dropped. By historical standards, these
changes in the distribution of income were very rapid. What caused these changes in
the distribution in money income?
It appears that the most important reason for growing inequality is what labor
economists call an increase in the demand for skill. 8 In the labor market, the
demand for highly skilled (highly educated) workers has increased relative to
the demand for less-skilled (less-educated) workers. As a result, the wage gap between
the two groups has widened. As we saw at the beginning of the chapter, in the last
three decades the college premium has increased significantly. At the same time, the
premium for advanced degrees increased. Finally, the dropout penalty (the wage gap
between high-school graduates and dropouts) has nearly doubled.

CHAPTER 32
THE LABOR MARKET, INCOME, AND POVERTY
696
Why did the demand for skill increase over the last three decades? There are two
main reasons:
Technological change. Advances in technology have simultaneously decreased
the demand for less-educated workers and increased the demand for college
graduates and people with advanced degrees. While the new technology has
made it possible to replace many low-skilled workers with smart  machines
and computers, it has also increased the demand for workers who have the edu-
cation and skills required to produce the new technology and use it.
Increased international trade. An increase in international trade means more
exports and imports. Trade allows developed countries like the United States to
easily export goods produced with high-skilled labor and import goods pro-
duced with low-skilled labor. As a result, the expansion of international trade in
the last three decades has increased the demand for high-skilled workers and
decreased the demand for low-skilled workers in the United States.
Economists have not yet reached a consensus on the relative importance of these
two factors.
Changes in the Top End of Income Distribution: 1920 2002
Figure 32.7 shows the trends in the income shares of the top decile (top 10 percent) of
income earners. The income share was just 43 percent in 1922 and just under 45 per-
cent at the start of World War II. The share plunged during the war and leveled out in
the postwar period at about 33 percent. The share started increasing in 1970, rising
from 32 to 42 percent by 2002.

Saez, Income Inequality in the United
States, 1913 2002 (November 2004).
What caused these patterns? Recent studies of the trends for the top decile gener-
ated the following observations:9
1 During World War II, the income share of the top decile decreased because gov-
ernment wage controls compressed wages. In addition, the government
increased tax rates on invested money (stock dividends, interest earnings, and

697
PART 11
entrepreneurial income) to support the war effort, and these rates remained rel-
atively high until the 1980s.
2 The stability of the income share in the period 1945 1970 is puzzling because
one would expect wages to rebound after wage controls ended following World
War II. During this time period, there was a postwar rebound in top-decile wages
in France and other countries, but not in the United States.
3 The increase in the income shares since 1970 has been caused by rapid increases
in the compensation of the highest-wage workers
the executives of large corpo-
rations and other organizations. Most of the action is in rising wages, not
increases in investment income.
POVERTY AND PUBLIC POLICY
The U.S. government defines a poor household as one with a total income less than
the amount required to satisfy the minimum needs  of the household. The govern-
ment estimates a minimum food budget for each type of household and multiplies the
food budget by three to get the official poverty budget. A household with income
lower than the official poverty budget is considered poor. In 2009 the poverty budget
was $16,781 for a three-person household and $22,128 for a four-person household,
roughly half of the median household income.  In 2009, about 44 million people were
below the poverty line, or 14.3 percent of the population.
Poverty Rates for Different Groups
Table 32.4 shows the incidence of poverty among different groups of people. For each
group, the poverty rate equals the percentage of people in that group who live in
households with incomes lower than the official poverty budget.
1 Race. The poverty rates for both African Americans and Hispanics are more
than twice the poverty rates for whites.
2 Type of family. The poverty rate for female-headed households is about
five times the poverty rate for households headed by a married couple.
3 Age. The poverty rate is relatively low for the aged, and relatively high
for children.
Education is a key factor in determining wages, and poverty rates are lower for
more-educated workers. As we saw earlier in the chapter, college graduates earn

roughly twice as much as high-school graduates. The poverty rate for college gradu-
ates is 3 percent, compared to 9 percent for high-school graduates. For high-school
dropouts, the poverty rate is 22 percent.
Redistribution Programs for the Poor
The government uses a number of programs to provide assistance to the poor. These
programs, broadly defined as welfare programs,  are means-tested programs,
meaning that only people whose incomes fall below a certain level receive assistance.
These programs reduce the poverty rate by a substantial margin. The poverty rates
shown in Table 32.4 include cash transfers to poor households. Cash transfers
decrease the overall poverty rate by about one-third. The poverty rates listed in
Table 32.4 do not include the value of noncash programs such as food stamps, which
decrease poverty rates by roughly two percentage points.
Table 32.5 shows the government expenditures on means-tested programs in
2004. As shown in the second row, cash assistance is responsible for less than one-fifth
of total spending, while medical care makes up over half of total spending.

Welfare Reform and TANF
In 1996, the overhaul of federal antipoverty programs ended decades of policy based
on the notion that poor families are entitled to cash and in-kind assistance. The
Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act of 1996 eliminated
the entitlement of poor families to receive cash assistance. The federal government
now provides block grants to states to provide Temporary Aid to Needy Families
(TANF), with restrictions on what recipients must do to qualify for assistance and lim-
its on how long they can receive assistance:
A recipient must participate in work activities, defined as employment, on-the-job
training, work experience, community service, or vocational training.
After a total of 60 months of cash assistance (consecutive or nonconsecutive), assis-
tance stops. States can allow exceptions to the 60-month rule for up to 20 percent
of recipients.
The general thrust of welfare reform was to change an entitlement program into a
program that requires work in exchange for time-limited assistance. Since the
implementation of welfare reform, the number of people receiving assistance has
decreased dramatically.

Welfare and Work Incentives

assistance program affect work incentives. The first feature is the base cash payment.

the lower the incentive to work to supplement the base income. There is
considerable variation across states in the base payment. In Alabama, the monthly pay-
ment for a single-parent family of three is $164, compared to $801 in Minnesota.10
The second feature that affects work incentives is the benefit reduction rate for
market income. When a recipient earns market income, the welfare payment
decreases. For example, if the benefit reduction rate is 40 percent, each dollar of mar-
ket income reduces the welfare payment by $0.40, so the net income from a dollar of
market income is $0.60. There is considerable variation across states in benefit reduc-
tion rates. In about a third of states, the benefit reduction rate is 100 percent: Each
dollar of market income reduces the welfare payment by a dollar. California allows
recipients to earn $225 without any benefit reduction, and each additional dollar
reduces the welfare payment by 50 cents. About one-third of states have reduction

APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: How does racial discrimination affect the
labor market?
Imagine that two recent high-school graduates apply for low-skill jobs advertised
in the newspaper. The jobs include waiting tables, dishwashing, and working in
warehouses. One man is white and admits to serving 18 months in prison for sell-
ing cocaine. The other applicant is an African-American man without a criminal
record. Which applicant has a greater chance of being called back for a second
interview? In a carefully designed experiment with college students posing as job
applicants, the white applicant with a criminal record was called back 17 percent of
the time, while the crime-free African-American applicant was called back only
14 percent of the time. In other words, the study implies that the disadvantage of
being African American is roughly equivalent to the disadvantage of spending
18 months in prison.
This experiment in Milwaukee revealed substantial racial discrimination in hiring for
low-skill jobs. According to Devah Pager, the researcher who conducted the experiment,
race remains a large barrier in entry-level jobs, where affirmative action is not practiced.
Employers don t invest much time in gathering information on applicants, and look for a
quick signal of the suitability of an applicant. Given the prevalent stereotypes about
young black men, race continues to send a negative signal to employers.
In another experiment, economists responded in writing to help-wanted ads in
Chicago and in Boston, using hypothetical names that were likely to be identified by
employers as either white or African American. Applicants named Greg Kelly or
Emily Walsh were 50 percent more likely to be called for interviews than those named
Jamal Jackson or Lakisha Washington. Having a white-sounding name on an applica-
tion was equivalent to about eight additional years of work experience. The
researchers experimented with different résumés for both types of applicants. Adding
work experience and computer skills increased the likelihood of interviews by 30 per-
cent for white-sounding applicants but only 9 percent for those whose names sug-
gested an African-American background.

In this chapter, we ve seen how
wages are determined in per-
fectly competitive labor mar-
kets and why wages differ from
one occupation to another.
We ve also looked at the distri-
bution of income in the United
States and explored possible
reasons for growing inequality. Here are the main points of
the chapter:
1 The long-run demand curve for labor is negatively sloped
because the output and input-substitution effects operate in
the same direction: An increase in the wage decreases labor
per unit of output and decreases the total output produced.
2 An increase in the wage triggers income and substitution effects
that operate in opposite directions, so an increase in the wage
has an ambiguous effect on the quantity of labor supplied.
3 The wage in a particular occupation will be relatively high if
supply is small relative to demand. This will occur if (1) few
people have the skills required for the occupation, (2) train-
ing costs are high, or (3) the job is dangerous or stressful.
4 College graduates earn more than high-school graduates
because a college education provides new skills and allows
people to reveal their skills to employers.
5 The trade-off with a minimum wage is that some workers
earn higher income, but others lose their jobs.
6 The wealthiest 20 percent of families in the United States earn
about half of total income, while the wealthiest 10 percent earn
42 percent of total income. At the other end of the income
distribution, the poorest 20 percent earn only 3.5 percent of
total income.
7 Poverty rates are relatively high among African Americans, His-
panics, high-school dropouts, and female-headed households.

rates of 50 percent or less. The larger the reduction rate, the lower the payoff for each
hour of market income, and the lower the incentive to earn additional income. There
is evidence that in states with relatively large work incentives, welfare recipients work
more hours and earn more market income.11

The Demand for Labor
1.1
The marginal revenue product of labor equals
times 
.
1.2
A profit-maximizing firm will hire the number of
workers where 
equals 
.
1.3
Your favorite professional team is considering hiring a
new player for $3 million per year. It will be sensible
(profitable) to hire the player if his 
is
greater than the $3 million cost.
1.4
Arrows up or down: The logic of the output effect is
that a decrease in the wage will 
produc-
tion costs, so the price of output will 
and
the quantity of output demanded will 
. As
a result, the quantity of labor demanded will
.
32.1
1.5
The input-substitution effect is that a decrease
in the wage 
(increases/decreases)
the quantity of labor per unit of 
, so
the quantity of labor demanded 
(increases/decreases).
1.6
The short-run market demand curve for labor is
(steeper/flatter) than the long-run
demand because 
occur(s) in the short run.
1.7
Demand for News Kids. Consider the market for
newspaper delivery kids in Kidsville. Each news kid
receives a piece rate of $2 per subscriber per month and
has a fixed territory that initially has 100 subscribers. The
price elasticity of demand for subscriptions is 2.0.
Suppose the new city council of Kidsville passes a law
that establishes a minimum piece rate of $3 per sub-
scriber per month. As a result, the publisher increases the
monthly price of a subscription by 20 percent. How will

the new law affect the monthly income of the typical
news kid?
1.8
Demand for Airline Pilots. Comment on the follow-
ing:
There is no substitute for an airline pilot:
Someone has to fly the plane. Therefore, an increase
in the wage of airline pilots will not change the num-
ber of pilots used by the airlines.
The Supply of Labor
2.1
Arrows up or down: An increase in the wage
the opportunity cost of leisure time,
which tends to 
leisure time and
labor time.
2.2
Arrows up or down: An increase in the wage
real income, and if leisure is a normal
good this tends to 
leisure time and
labor time.
2.3
We 
(can/cannot) predict a worker s
response to an increase in the wage because the
effect and the 
effect work
in 
(the same/opposite) direction(s).
2.4
Your objective is to earn exactly $120 per week. If your
wage decreases from $6 to $4 per hour, you respond
by 
working 
hours 
instead 
of
hours. In other words, your labor-supply
curve is 
sloped.
2.5
If every worker in a particular occupation works
exactly 40 hours per week, regardless of the wage, the
individual supply curve is vertical. 
(True/False)
2.6
For cabbies in New York City, the elasticity of supply
of labor is 
(positive/negative/zero).
(Related to Application 1 on page 687.)
2.7
Income and Substitution Effects. Sabrina works for
a workers  cooperative that initially pays her a lump
sum of $200 per week (as long as she works at least
15 hours per week) and a wage of $20 per hour of
work. She initially works 40 hours per week. Suppose
the cooperative changes its pay plan by increasing the
lump-sum payment to $280 and decreasing the hourly
wage to $18.
a. If Sabrina continues to work 40 hours per week,
how does the change in the pay plan affect her
total income?
b. Use the concepts of the income and substitution
effects to predict whether Sabrina will work more
hours, fewer hours, or the same number of hours.
(Hint: Is there an income effect to consider?)
2.8
City versus National Carpenter Supply. Draw two
supply curves for carpenters: one for the market in the
city of Portland and one for the market in the United
32.2
States. In which market would you expect a more elastic
supply of carpenters?
2.9
Tax Rate and Tax Revenue. Critically appraise the
following statement: The law of supply says that an
increase in price increases the quantity supplied. A
decrease in the income tax rate will increase the
worker s net wage, so each worker will work more
hours. As a result, the revenue from the income tax
will increase.
2.10 Personal Labor Supply. We discussed the responses
of Lester, Sam, and Maureen to a wage increase.
Which person s response is closest to your own? If
your wage increased, would you work more hours,
fewer hours, or about the same number of hours?
2.11 Cabbie Wages and Income. Suppose New York City
increases the taxi fare by 20 percent. (Related to
Application 1 on page 687.)
a. For the typical cabbie, daily income will increase
by
(more than/less than/exactly)
20 percent. Explain.
b. Suppose the initial fare per mile is $0.60 and the
initial miles per day is 100. Compute the
percentage change in daily income.
Labor Market Equilibrium
3.1
Arrows up or down: A decrease in the supply of
nurses will

and
the equilibrium quantity of nurs-
ing services.
3.2
Arrows up or down: An increase in the demand for
nursing services will 
the equilibrium
wage and 
the equilibrium quantity of
nursing services.
3.3
Arrows up or down: A minimum wage 
the quantity of labor demanded and 
the
quantity of labor supplied.
3.4
A minimum wage for restaurant workers brings good
news to 
, but bad news to 
and 
.
3.5
In Figure 32.5 on page 689, an increase in the wage
decreases the quantity of labor demanded. Using the
simple approach to computing percentage changes
(see the Appendix to Chapter 1), the implied elasticity
of demand for labor is 
.
3.6
The average immigrant has 
(less/more)
education than the average native, so immigration
(increases/decreases) the wages of
(low/high) skill natives. (Related to
Application 2 on page 690.)
3.7
The immigration of low-skill workers generates net
benefits for
workers because they benefit

associated with lower

Application 2 on page 690.)
3.8
Living Wage and Labor Income. Consider a univer-
sity that has sweatshirts bearing its logo produced
overseas by a contractor who initially pays a wage of
$8 per sweatshirt and has other costs of $12 per sweat-
shirt, resulting in a price of $20 per sweatshirt. At this
price, the university sells 100 sweatshirts per week.
Suppose a student group succeeds in getting the con-
tractor to increase the wage to $10 per shirt and the
other costs of production don t change.
a. The price per sweatshirt will increase from
to 
, an increase of
percent.
b. Suppose the price elasticity of demand for the
universitys sweatshirts is 3.0. At the higher price, a
total of 
sweatshirts will be purchased
and the total spending on sweatshirt labor (total
labor income) will change from $
to
$
.
c. Suppose consumers are willing to pay a higher
price for sweatshirts made by workers receiving a
higher wage. How would this change the numbers
in part (b)? Provide an example in which the higher
wage actually increases the total spending on
sweatshirt labor.
3.9
Wage and Price Effects of Immigration. In the ini-
tial equilibrium in the market for farm workers, the
wage is $10 per hour. The elasticity of supply of farm
workers is 2.0, and the elasticity of demand for farm
workers is 1.0. Suppose that immigration increases the
supply of farm workers by 12 percent: The supply
curve shifts to the right by 12 percent. (Related to
Application 2 on page 690.)
a. Use the price-change formula discussed in an
earlier chapter on elasticity to compute the change
in the equilibrium wage.
b. Suppose that farm workers are responsible for one-
fourth of the production cost of food. What are the
implications of immigration for the cost of
producing food and its price?
3.10 Payroll Tax. You are an economic consultant to a city
that just imposed a payroll tax of $1 per hour of work.
This payroll tax is paid by workers through a payroll
deduction: For each hour of work, the employer
deducts $1 and sends the money to the city govern-
ment. The initial wage (before the tax) is $10, and
total employment is 20,000 hours per day. Use a graph
to show the effect of the tax on the equilibrium wage
and employment.
3.11 Higher Teacher Salaries. Advocates of higher
salaries for teachers point out that most teachers have
college degrees and that teaching children is an
important job.
a. Why aren t teachers  salaries higher, given the
importance of the job and the education required?
b. Suppose a new law establishes a minimum teacher
salary that is 20 percent higher than the prevailing
salary. How would you expect this law to affect the
average quality of teachers and the taxes paid by the
typical household?
Explaining Differences in Wages and Income
4.1
The wage for a particular occupation will be relatively
low if labor 
(demand/supply) is small
relative to labor 
(demand/supply).
4.2
If a city has a relatively high crime rate, we would
expect the wage for taxi drivers to be relatively
(high/low).
4.3
In some countries, it is customary to tip restaurant
waiters. We would expect the wages paid to waiters to
be 
(higher/lower/the same) in countries
where tips are customary.
4.4
If a worker switches from a relatively safe factory job
to a job in a steel mill, the wage will increase by
roughly 
(2/4/10/30) percent.
4.5
The wage premium for beautiful people is about
percent, while the wage penalty for
unattractive people is about 
percent.
(Related to Application 3 on page 693.)
4.6
Beautiful workers get wider opportunities to
, so a small difference in innate charac-
teristics can lead to a large difference in 
.
(Related to Application 3 on page 693.)
4.7
Improved Safety and Wages. Consider an occupa-
tion that initially has a relatively high rate of nonfatal
injuries. The equilibrium wage is $20 per hour, and
the equilibrium quantity is 100,000 hours. Suppose a
new safety device cuts the injury rate in half, and the
supply of labor increases by 12 percent: The labor
supply curve shifts to the right by 12 percent.
a. Use a graph to show the effects of the safety device
on the equilibrium wage and employment.
b. Suppose the elasticity of supply of labor is 3.0 and
the elasticity of demand is 1.0. Use the price change
formula discussed in an earlier chapter on elasticity
to compute the change in the equilibrium wage.
c. Suppose the demand curve you ve drawn is a long-
run demand curve. Explain the roles of the output
effect and substitution effect on the change in the
quantity of labor demanded.
4.8
Waiter Tips and Income. Consider a city where the
typical waiter has a five-hour shift and daily sales  (total
bills presented to customers) of $400. The customary tip
is 15 percent, so tips add up to $60 per day (15% of
$400). The initial wage is $10 per hour, so the typical
waiter initially earns $50 in wages paid directly by the
32.4
702

restaurant. Suppose a local waiter association runs a suc-
cessful campaign to get the citys restaurant patrons to
increase the average tip from 15 to 20 percent.
a. Use a supply and demand graph with wage
(excluding tips) on the vertical axis to show the
effects of the new tip rate on the labor market.
b. How will the new tip rate affect the daily income
(wages plus tips) of the typical waiter?
The Distribution of Income
5.1
Government transfer and tax policies increase the
income share of the lowest quintile of the income dis-
tribution from about 
percent to about
percent.
5.2
The college premium is defined as the percentage
difference between the incomes of 
and
. 
It 
is 
currently 
about 
percent.
5.3
Arrows up or down: Since 1970, the income share of
the top fifth of the income distribution has
, while the shares of the lowest and mid-
dle fifths have 
.
5.4
Arrows up or down: An important factor in growing
inequality over the last 30 years is technological
change that has 
the demand for college
graduates and 
the demand for less-
educated workers.
Poverty and Public Policy
6.1
For each of the following pairs of population groups,
indicate which group has a higher poverty rate:
White, 
Hispanic
White, 
Asian
32.6

Married couple, 
Female-
headed household

6.2
Government spending and tax policies reduce the
overall poverty rate from roughly 
(25/20/15/10) percent to roughly 
(15/10/5/2) percent.
6.3
Cash aid to the poor makes up roughly 
(90/50/30/20) percent of the total spending on means-
tested programs.
6.4
A low-income person receiving cash aid under TANF
receives a fixed sum per month for an unlimited length
of time. 
(True/False)
6.5
Job applicants with white-sounding names were
(2/20/50) percent more likely to be
called for interviews than those whose names sug-
gested an African-American background. (Related to
Application 4 on page 699.)
6.6
Quick Signals from High School. Consider the
application, 
Lakisha Washington versus Emily
Walsh.  According to the researcher, [Employers]
want a quick signal whether the applicant seems suit-
able.  Suppose a firm hiring workers cannot distin-
guish between high-productivity and low-productivity
applicants, but the firm knows whether an applicant
graduated from high school H, where the average
achievement level is relatively high, or high school L,
where the average achievement level is relatively low
(Related to Application 4 on page 699.)
a. If the firm will hire one of two applicants, one from
high school H and a second from high school L,
which is the better choice?
b. What insights does this exercise provide about why
firms are more likely to interview and hire
applicants with white-sounding names?

Why Do Law Firms Pay More for Janitors
and Secretaries?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS
Why do janitors employed by law firms earn twice as
much as janitors employed by hotels? This is a puzzle
because in a perfectly competitive market, two equally
productive janitors would earn the same wage, regardless
of where they work. If janitors initially earned a higher
wage in law firms, the wage gap would be quickly elimi-
nated as janitors bid against each other for the more lucra-
tive jobs, and law firms eagerly hire cheaper janitors. Why
does the wage gap persist?
The same sort of wage gap occurs for other low-skilled
workers such as secretaries and truckers.1 Mexican truckers
who haul petroleum earn more than those who haul corn.
British clerical workers in the computer industry earn more
than those in the textile industry. Many studies have shown
that low-skilled workers are paid more when they work in
industries where the average labor productivity of the
industry is relatively high.

CHAPTER 33
UNIONS, MONOPSONY, AND IMPERFECT INFORMATION
706
T
his chapter continues our discussion of labor markets, exploring three topics
that take us beyond the simple model of perfect competition in the previous
chapter. One of the assumptions of perfect competition in the labor market is
that each worker acts independently of other workers, taking the market wage as
given. In this chapter, we start by explaining how labor unions allow workers to act
collectively, controlling the supply of labor and negotiating wages. A second assump-
tion of perfect competition is that each firm takes the wage as given, so a firm can hire
an unlimited number of workers at the prevailing market wage. In this chapter, we ll
see what happens when a single firm dominates the demand for labor. A third assump-
tion of perfect competition is perfect information: Each firm knows the productivity
level of each worker. In this chapter, we see what happens when firms cannot distin-
guish between workers with different productivities. We ll use the notion of imperfect
information in the labor market to explain the puzzle of higher wages for janitors in
law firms.
LABOR UNIONS
A labor union is a group of workers organized to increase job security, improve work-
ing conditions, and increase wages and fringe benefits. Acting as a group, union mem-
bers have some control over the wages and fringe benefits they receive. There are two
types of labor unions:
A craft union includes workers with a specific skill or trade in particular occu-
pations, such as plumbers, bakers, or electricians.
An industrial union includes all types of workers from a single industry, such as
steelworkers or autoworkers.
Umbrella organizations include many individual unions. The largest of these
unions of unions  is the American Federation of Labor Congress of Industrial
Organizations (AFL-CIO). Unions use collective bargaining to negotiate contracts
covering wages, fringe benefits, job security, and working conditions.
A Brief History of Labor Unions in the United States
As shown in Panel A of Figure 33.1, about one in eight workers in the United States
belongs to a union, down from about one in three workers in the 1950s. The union-
ization rate is 8.2 percent for private-sector workers, compared to 39.8 percent for
public-sector workers. Panel B shows the wide range of unionization rates in other
countries, from 2 percent in India to 78 percent in Sweden. The United States has a
much lower unionization rate than other industrial countries.2
Lets take a brief look at the history of labor organizations in the United States.
Labor unions arose largely in response to long work hours and awful working condi-
tions. The long workweek was not new to those who had worked on farms, but the
working conditions were. For the early union organizers, the key demands were higher
wages, shorter hours, and safer work environments. The main umbrella organizations
were the Knights of Labor (founded in 1869) and the AFL (founded in 1886). The CIO
(formed in 1935) was a collection of industrial unions that represented semiskilled
workers in mass production, including workers in the automobile, rubber, and steel
industries. The CIO merged with the AFL in 1955, forming the AFL-CIO.
The states and the federal government have empowered labor unions. The
most important labor legislation gave workers the right to form unions, but limited
their power:
The National Labor Relations Act (Wagner Act) of 1935 guaranteed workers
the right to join unions and required each firm to bargain with a union formed
by a majority of its workers. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) was
established to conduct certification elections in which workers could pick a

tion rules or refused to negotiate with union officials.
The Labor Management Relations Act (Taft Hartley) of 1947 gave government
the power to stop strikes that imperiled the national health or safety  and
allowed states to pass right-to-work laws. These laws, which are currently in
force in 22 states (most in the South, Southwest, and Plains states), make it ille-
gal to require a worker to join a union as a condition of employment.

of 1959 was a response to allegations of corruption and misconduct by union
officials. This act guaranteed union members the right to fair elections, made it
easier for them to monitor union finances, and made the theft of union funds a
federal offense.
Labor Unions and Wages
There is evidence that unions raise the wages of union workers. For the United States,
the consensus is that union workers earn 10 to 20 percent more than nonunion work-
ers doing the same work.3 Most other industrialized countries have a smaller union
wage differential. For example, it is 10 percent in the United Kingdom, 8 percent in
Canada, and 4 percent in Germany.
What are the trade-offs between wages and employment? Suppose workers in a
particular industry form an industrial union and agree on a union wage that exceeds
the equilibrium wage. As we saw in the previous chapter, an increase in the wage
decreases the quantity of labor demanded because of the output effect and the input-
substitution effect.
Output effect. An increase in the wage increases the cost of production, and a
firm will pass on the higher cost to consumers by increasing its product price.
Consumers respond to the higher price by purchasing a smaller quantity, so the
firm will produce less output and employ fewer workers.
Input-substitution effect. An increase in the wage increases the cost of labor rel-
ative to the cost of capital, and the firm will substitute capital for labor, reducing
the quantity of labor demanded.
Given the trade-off between wages and employment, an increase in the union wage
increases the income of the workers who keep their jobs, but also decreases the num-
ber of union jobs.
right-to-work laws
Laws that prohibit union shops, where
union membership is required as a
condition of employment.

Market Structure and the Wage Jobs Trade-Off
We ve seen that one factor in the trade-off between wages and employment is the
output effect. An increase in the wage increases the product price and decreases the
firms output, so the firm hires fewer workers. When will the output effect be rela-
tively large?
Large fraction of costs from labor. If labor is responsible for a relatively large
fraction of production costs, an increase in the wage will cause a relatively large
increase in the product price and, thus, a relatively large decrease in output and
the quantity of labor demanded.
Elastic demand. If the price elasticity of demand for the product is relatively
large, a given increase in price will cause a relatively large reduction in output.
Under these conditions, a given increase in the union wage will cause a relatively large
decrease in the number of union jobs. Given the large loss of jobs from a higher wage,
we expect the union workers to accept a relatively small wage premium over nonunion
workers. In contrast, when the output effect is small
when labor costs are a relatively
small fraction of production costs and product demand is relatively inelastic
an
increase in the wage leads to a relatively small loss of jobs, and we expect a relatively
large union wage differential.
The price elasticity of demand for a product depends, in part, on the degree of
market competition. As we saw earlier in the book, a firm with just a few competitors
faces a relatively inelastic demand for its product because consumers have few options.
The inelastic demand means that an increase in the union wage will cause a relatively
small loss in union jobs. Therefore, we expect relatively large union wage differentials
in a monopoly or an oligopoly. In more-competitive markets, consumers have more
options and the demand for a firm s output is relatively elastic. An increase in the
union wage causes a relatively large loss of union jobs, so we expect a relatively small
union wage differential.
The Effects of Unions on Worker Productivity and Turnover
One response to the trade-off between wages and jobs is to impose work rules that
increase the amount of labor required to produce a given quantity of output. This is
called featherbedding. One example of featherbedding is requiring a minimum crew
size, which forces a firm to hire more workers than it needs to perform a particular
task. For example, the typical unionized airline hires three workers to guide an air-
plane into the gate, while nonunion airlines use only two workers. In the past, railroad
unions forced railroads to use firemen (whose job was to shovel coal) on diesel-
powered engines, which don t use coal.
Featherbedding may actually decrease the demand for labor. Although feath-
erbedding forces the firm to use more labor per unit of output, it also decreases the
quantity of output produced. A firm that hires workers it doesn t need will have higher
production costs, resulting in a higher price for its product. Consumers respond to a
higher price by purchasing less output, so although the firm may use more labor per
unit of output, it sells less output. If output falls by a large amount, the quantity of
labor demanded by the firm will actually decrease.
We ve seen that unions lead to higher wages and may impose work rules that
reduce productivity. In other words, unions increase production costs. What are the
possible benefits of unions? First, unions may increase worker productivity by facili-
tating communication between workers and managers. A second possible benefit of
unions is lower turnover among workers. If a worker is unhappy with a job, one option
is to quit. From the firm s perspective, this is costly because the firm loses an experi-
enced worker and must train a new one. A dissatisfied worker who belongs to a union
has a second option: The worker can use the union as an intermediary to discuss job
issues with managers. This sort of communication can solve problems before they

TRUCKERS TRADE OFF WAGES AND JOBS
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #1: Is there a trade-off between union wages
and the number of union jobs?
In recent decades, the union wage differential has decreased in many industries,
including trucking services. Between 1978 and 1996, the union differential decreased
from 40 percent to 23 percent. The deregulation of the industry in the 1980s allowed
many small firms to enter the market, and many of these new firms were not union-
ized. As a result, the demand for union truckers decreased, and unions faced a trade-
off between wages and employment. If they maintained the relatively high union
wage, total employment of union truckers would decrease by a large amount. In con-
trast, if they tried to maintain the same level of union employment, union truckers
would be forced to accept much lower wages.
Figure 33.2 shows the response of union truckers to the entry of nonunion firms. In
1978 the union wage was $20 per hour and union employment was 526,000 truckers
(point a). The entry of nonunion firms shifted the demand curve facing union truckers
to the left. If the wage had remained at $20, total union employment would have
dropped by half, to 263,000 workers (point b). Rather than accepting such a large reduc-
tion in union employment, truckers accepted a wage of $14 per hour, and total union
employment in 1996 was 439,000 (point c). In other words, union truckers accepted
lower wages in exchange for more jobs
or a smaller reduction in jobs.

become so severe that the worker quits. There is evidence that firms whose workers
are in unions have lower turnover rates, in part because they facilitate communication
between workers and managers.4 These lower turnover rates lead to lower training
costs and a more experienced workforce. The savings from less turnover is equivalent
to a 1 to 2 percent reduction in costs.
MONOPSONY POWER
In the preceding chapter, we assumed that each employer is such a small part of the
labor market that the employer takes the market wage as given. In graphical terms, a
perfectly competitive firm faces a labor-supply curve that is horizontal at the market
wage. In other words, each firm is a wage taker. In contrast, in a labor market with a
single employer, the firm is a wage maker, choosing what wage to pay its workers. Of
course, the lower the wage, the smaller the quantity of labor supplied to the firm. For
example, if your city has a single hospital, there will be a single employer of surgical
nurses. This is the case of monopsony: a single buyer of an input. The classic exam-
ple of monopsony is a company town, where most workers are employed by the same
firm. For example, a coal-mining firm could employ most of the workers in an isolated
town in West Virginia, or a pineapple plantation could employ most of the workers on
a small Hawaiian island.

WHAT HAPPENED TO THE HIGH-APTITUDE FEMALE
TEACHERS?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #2: How does unionization affect wages and the
composition of the workforce?
In the last few decades, a progressively smaller share of the top college graduates
became teachers. Aptitude is measured by scores on standardized tests, and there is
compelling evidence that high aptitude translates into high teaching skills in the class-
room. In the case of teachers, the top aptitude group includes graduates whose test
scores placed them in the 80th percentile (the top 20%). In 1964 about 25 percent of
the female graduates in the top aptitude group became teachers, but by 2000 the share
had dropped to 11 percent. As a result, the share of classroom teachers from the top
aptitude group decreased dramatically. What happened?
A recent study suggests that the loss of high-aptitude teachers resulted from salary
compression caused by unionization. In 1963 a teacher in the top aptitude group was
paid 59 percent more than the average teacher, while a teacher in the lowest aptitude
group (bottom 20% of test scores) was paid 28 percent less than the average teacher.
By 2000 these salary differences had almost completely disappeared
teacher salaries
were nearly independent of aptitude, and depended almost exclusively on seniority
and the amount of graduate coursework. The elimination of the salary differentials
naturally decreased the supply of the highest aptitude teachers, who could earn
salaries more in line with their aptitudes in other occupations. For example, a larger
share of the top aptitude group became computer specialists, accountants, and man-
agers.

PART 11
Marginal Labor Cost Exceeds the Wage
A monopsonist faces a positively sloped market supply curve of labor. If the firm wants
to hire more workers, it must pay a higher wage to attract them away from other
firms. In Figure 33.3, the firm can hire seven workers at a wage of $10 (point a) and
eight workers at a wage of $12 (point b). The firm s marginal labor cost (also known
as marginal factor cost) is defined as the increase in the firm s total labor cost from one
more unit of labor. When the firm decides to hire eight workers instead of seven, its
total labor cost increases from $70 per hour ($10 per worker per hour times seven
workers) to $96 per hour ($12 per worker per hour times eight workers), an increase
of $26. Therefore, the firms marginal labor cost for the eighth worker is $26 (shown
by point c in Figure 33.3).

The Supply of Labor and Marginal Labor Cost for a Monopsonist
To hire more workers, the monopsonist must pay a higher wage, so the marginal labor cost exceeds
the wage. To hire the eighth worker, the firm increases the wage from $10 (point a) to $12 (point b).
The marginal labor cost for the eighth worker is $26 (point c), equal to $12 paid to the eighth worker
plus $14 extra paid to the seven original workers, each of whom receives $2 more per hour.
As shown in Figure 33.3, the marginal labor cost exceeds the wage. When a firm
increases the wage to hire one more worker, it must increase the wage for all of its
workers. For example, to hire the eighth worker, the firm pays $12 to the new worker,
but it also pays an extra $2 for each of the seven workers who were willing to work at
the lower wage of $10. We compute the marginal labor cost as follows:
In this example, the marginal labor cost is $26, including $12 for the new worker and
$14 extra for the original workers.

The Hiring Decision of a
Monopsonist
The monopsonist satisfies the marginal
principle at point a, where the marginal
benefit of labor (marginal revenue
product) equals the marginal labor
cost, so the firm hires 40 workers. The
labor-supply curve indicates that to hire
40 workers, the monopsonist must pay
a wage of $4 (point b).
M A R G I N A L  P R I N C I P L E
Increase the level of an activity as long as its marginal benefit exceeds its
marginal cost. Choose the level at which the marginal benefit equals the
marginal cost.
The firm chooses the quantity of labor at which the marginal benefit of labor
equals the marginal cost. As we saw in the previous chapter, the marginal benefit of
labor equals the marginal-revenue product of labor
the increase in revenue gener-
ated by an additional worker. The marginal-revenue product curve is also the
demand curve for labor. In Figure 33.4, the marginal-labor cost curve intersects the
marginal revenue product curve at point a, so the monopsonist hires 40 workers. As
shown by the labor supply curve, to hire 40 workers the firm must pay a wage of $4
(shown by point b).
Why does the monopsonist stop at 40 workers when it could hire an additional
worker for just over $4, and the 41st worker would have a marginal revenue product of
just under $8? To hire one more worker, the monopsonist must increase the wage to
$4.10. The marginal labor cost of the 41st worker incorporates the higher wages that
must be paid to the first 40 workers:
Because a higher wage must be paid to the 40 original workers, the marginal labor cost
of the 41st worker ($8.10) exceeds the marginal revenue product (less than $8.00).
Therefore, the firm stops at 40 workers.

PART 11
Monopsony versus Perfect Competition
How does the monopsony outcome compare to the perfectly competitive outcome?
Any firm that hires workers
either a monopsonist or perfect competitor
will con-
tinue to hire more workers until the marginal cost equals the marginal benefit (the
marginal revenue product). A perfectly competitive firm is both a price taker and a
wage taker: Each firm is too small to affect either the price of output or the price of
labor. Therefore, the marginal cost of labor is simply the wage. In Figure 33.4, the
perfectly competitive equilibrium is shown by the intersection of the demand curve
(marginal-revenue product curve) and the supply curve at point c. The equilibrium
wage is $6, and the equilibrium quantity is 60 workers.
For a monopsonist, the marginal cost of labor exceeds the wage because the firm
must increase its wage to hire more workers. Compared to a perfectly competitive
firm, a monopsonist has a higher marginal cost of labor. As a result, a firm will hire
fewer workers than a collection of perfectly competitive firms. In Figure 33.4, the
monopsonist hires only 40 workers because its higher marginal cost equals the mar-
ginal benefit at a smaller quantity of labor.
You may have noticed the similarity between a monopsonist and a monopolist. As
shown in the first column of Table 33.1, a monopolist in a product market produces a
relatively small quantity of output and charges a relatively high price. In the second
column of the table, a monopsonist in the labor market demands a relatively small
quantity of labor and pays a relatively low wage. In both cases, market power gener-
ates a relatively small quantity of either output (monopoly) or labor (monopsony).

What is the role of a labor union in a labor market with a single buyer?
Monopsony leads to an artificially low wage, and a union may lead to an artificially
high wage. A market with both a union and a monopsonist will have a wage some-
where between the two extremes, with the actual value of the wage determined by the
bargaining power of the two sides. In such a market, the market powers on the two
sides of the market counteract each other, leading to a wage between the artificially
low monopsony wage and the artificially high union wage.
Monopsony and a Minimum Wage
In the preceding chapter, we showed that a minimum wage decreases the quantity of
labor demanded below the perfectly competitive level. In this case, there is a trade-off
between higher wages and total employment. How does this analysis change when a
monopsonist has market power on the demand side of the market?
Figure 33.5 shows the effects of a minimum wage of $7. This wage exceeds the
monopsony wage of $4 as well as the perfectly competitive wage of $6. The minimum
wage rules out wages below $7, so the supply curve facing the monopsonist is horizon-
tal up to 70 workers. The first 70 workers are willing to work at the minimum wage,
so to hire the 41st worker the firm doesn t have to pay any more than it did for the first
40 workers. For the first 70 workers, the marginal labor cost is the minimum wage of
$7. If the firm wants to hire more than 70 workers, it must pay a wage higher than the
minimum, as shown by the market supply curve beyond point d. But for fewer than
70 workers, the supply curve facing the firm is horizontal, so the marginal labor cost is
constant at the minimum wage of $7.

A Minimum Wage Increases
Employment by a Monopsonist
With a minimum wage, the labor-supply
curve is horizontal at the minimum wage
($7) up to the point where the minimum-
wage line intersects the original supply
curve. For the first 70 workers, the mar-
ginal labor cost for the monopsonist
equals the minimum wage. The monop-
sonist chooses point e, where the mar-
ginal benefit of labor (the marginal
revenue product) equals the marginal
labor cost. The minimum wage increases
the quantity of labor hired from 40 work-
ers to 50.
To maximize its profit, the firm will pick the quantity of labor at which the mar-
ginal benefit equals the marginal cost. At point e, the marginal labor cost (shown by
the horizontal portion of the new supply curve) equals the marginal benefit (shown by
the marginal revenue product curve), so the monopsonist hires 50 workers, up from
40 workers before the minimum wage. In other words, the minimum wage increases
the quantity of labor demanded.
How does this analysis compare to the analysis of the minimum wage in the pre-
vious chapter? Recall that in a perfectly competitive market, the minimum wage
decreases the quantity of labor. In Figure 33.5, the competitive outcome is shown by
point c, with 60 workers. So a minimum wage of $7 generates less than the competi-
tive quantity but more than the monopsony quantity (40 workers). Starting from the
monopsony outcome, a minimum wage of $7 moves the market closer to the perfectly
competitive outcome. In fact, if the minimum wage were set at $6, the market would
reach the competitive quantity of 60 workers. The minimum wage makes the monop-
sonist a wage-taking firm, so the quantity of labor demanded increases.
Monopsony and the Real World
Although a pure monopsony, such as a company town, is rare, the insights from the
monopsony model are relevant for actual labor markets. The essential feature of the
model is that if an individual firm wants to hire additional workers, it must increase
its wage to attract more workers. In other words, the firm faces a positively sloped
supply curve for workers, not a horizontal curve. We saw that a positively sloped sup-
ply curve generates a marginal labor cost curve above the supply curve, and the profit-
maximizing quantity of labor is less than the perfectly competitive quantity.
British economist Joan Robinson (1903 1983), a leader in the modeling of
imperfect competition, listed several reasons why a firm could face a positively sloped
labor-supply curve:
There may be a certain number of workers in the immediate neighbourhood and to attract
those from farther afield it may be necessary to pay a wage equal to what they can earn near
home plus their fares to and fro; or there could be workers attached to the firm by prefer-
ence or custom and to attract others it may be necessary to pay a higher wage. Or igno-
rance may prevent workers from moving from one to another in response to differences in
the wages offered by the different firms.5

715
PART 11
Because of these frictions in the labor market, a firm must pay a higher wage to
get more workers: The labor supply curve facing a firm is positively sloped. With a
positively sloped supply curve, the marginal labor cost exceeds the wage, and the
quantity of labor will be less than occurs in a perfectly competitive market.
IMPERFECT INFORMATION AND
EFFICIENCY WAGES
Up to this point, our discussion of labor markets has been based on the assumption of
perfect information. Each employer knows the productivity level of each worker and
hires a worker only if the marginal benefit exceeds the marginal cost. In some markets,
workers differ in their skill levels and the amount of effort they exert on the job. At the
time of hiring, employers cannot always distinguish between skillful and unskillful
workers or between hard workers and lazy workers. In other words, there is asymmet-
ric information in the labor market.
The Mixed Market for Labor
In the chapter on imperfect information, we saw that in a market with asymmetric
information, high-quality and low-quality goods are sold in a mixed market at a single
price. In the labor market, workers differ in their productivity, but a potential

PUBS AND THE LABOR-SUPPLY CURVE
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #3: Do firms face a positively sloped labor-
supply curve?
Labor economist Alan Manning provides some unconventional evidence of positively
sloped labor-supply curves. He notes that people go to the pub to celebrate when
they get a job, rather than greeting the news with a shrug of the shoulders . . . .  In
other words, a new job is a big deal.
If a pub celebration seems like the obvious response to a new job, consider what
happens when each firm faces a horizontal supply curve for labor, with a single market
wage. A firm has no incentive to pay a higher wage because it can hire as many work-
ers as it wants at the market wage. And if the firm paid a lower wage, all its workers
would instantly switch to other firms paying the market wage. In this perfectly com-
petitive environment, a worker won t celebrate a new job because the new job pays the
same as any other job the worker could get. The wage paid by an employer equals the
workers opportunity cost.
Suppose instead that the supply curve facing a firm is positively sloped. To hire
more workers, the firm must pay a higher wage. Most workers will receive a wage that
exceeds the opportunity cost of their time, so each worker gets a producer surplus.
Workers switch jobs to get a bigger surplus, so they celebrate new jobs. Manning
notes that people also go to the pub to drown their sorrows when they lose their
jobs.  This response wouldn t be sensible with a horizontal supply curve, because
someone who loses a job could instantly get another one at the same wage. But with a
positively sloped supply curve, losing a job means losing a producer surplus.

employer may not be able to distinguish between workers with high or low productiv-
ity. As shown in Table 33.2, suppose that low-productivity workers have half the mar-
ginal revenue product of high-productivity workers, and also half the opportunity
cost. Suppose employers are perfectly competitive and cannot distinguish between
low-skill and high-skill workers before hiring them. Each firm offers a single wage to
all workers, realizing that its workforce may include some workers of each type. What
is the equilibrium wage?

In a perfectly competitive labor market, competition among firms will bid up
the wage to equal the marginal revenue product (MRP) of hired workers.
Therefore, the equilibrium wage will be at least $40 because that s the MRP of the
least-productive workers. Consider a wage of $40, which exceeds the opportunity
cost of low-productivity workers ($25) but not the opportunity cost of high-
productivity workers ($50). As a result, only low-productivity workers will apply
for jobs and be hired. As shown in the first row of Table 33.3, the wage equals the
MRP of the workers hired, so each firm makes zero economic profit. In other
words, $40 is an equilibrium wage.

In this market with asymmetric information, there is actually a second equilib-
rium wage, equal to $60. This wage is high enough to exceed the opportunity costs of
both types of workers, so both types apply for jobs and are hired. Suppose the number
of low-productivity workers equals the number of high-productivity workers. In this
case, the average labor productivity of the hired workers will be the average of $40 (for
low-productivity workers) and $80 (for high-productivity workers), or $60. As shown
in the last row of Table 33.3, the wage equals the average productivity of the hired
workforce, so each firm will make zero economic profit. In other words, $60 is
another equilibrium wage.
What about wages between $40 and $60? The second row of Table 33.3 shows the
effects of a $45 wage. The wage is below the opportunity cost of high-productivity
workers, so all the hired workers will have an MRP of $40 and firms will lose $5 on each
worker hired. Economic profit is negative, so this is not an equilibrium. The third row
of the table shows the effects of a $55 wage, which exceeds the opportunity cost of high-
productivity workers. Half the workers have an MRP of $40, and half have an MRP of
$80, for an average of $60. Firms earn an average profit of $5 per worker, and the posi-
tive economic profit will cause competing firms to bid up the wage. The wage will con-
tinue to rise until it reaches $60, the wage at which economic profit is zero, and we have
an equilibrium.
We ve seen that paying a higher wage may increase the average productivity of
workers. This is known as paying efficiency wages. Productivity increases because a

PART 11
higher wage makes it possible to hire workers with higher opportunity costs. There
are two other reasons for paying efficiency wages:
Reduce shirking. When a high wage is combined with a policy of firing workers
who shirk
putting in less than a full effort
the firm can encourage hard work.
The penalty associated with being fired will be much greater if the firm pays a
wage above the worker s opportunity cost.
Reduce turnover. A wage above the worker s opportunity cost will reduce
worker turnover. A firm that pays a higher wage than its competitors discour-
ages workers from switching employers. The firm paying the higher wage will
have lower turnover and thus incur smaller costs in hiring and training workers.
The classic example of paying efficiency wages comes from the automobile indus-
try in the early 1900s, when the prevailing wage for autoworkers was $3 per day.6
Assembly-line jobs were repetitive and tedious, and the turnover rate of workers was
very high. When Henry Ford decided to increase the daily wage for his workers from
$3 to $5 in 1914, most observers were baffled. They predicted that Fords labor costs
would be almost twice as high as those of his rivals, so he would lose a lot of money
and quickly go out of business. Contrary to expectations, Ford s profit doubled from
$30 million to $60 million, a result of higher productivity caused by several changes in
the workforce:
The pool of job applicants improved, so Ford could choose better workers.
Fewer workers were fired for shirking.
Fewer workers quit voluntarily.
The rate of absenteeism was cut in half.
In the words of Henry Ford, There was no charity in any way involved. . . . The pay-
ment of five dollars a day for an eight-hour day was one of the finest cost-cutting

WHY DO LAW FIRMS PAY MORE FOR JANITORS AND
SECRETARIES?
APPLYING THE CONCEPTS #4: When is it profitable to pay an above-
market wage?
As we saw in the chapter opener, janitors employed by law firms earn twice as much
as equally productive janitors employed by hotels. The same sort of wage gap occurs
for other low-skilled workers such as secretaries and truckers. The key difference
between a law firm and a hotel is that on average, workers in the law firm are more
productive and are paid more than workers in a hotel. Like other workers, low-
skilled workers such as janitors and secretaries require supervision, and the opportu-
nity cost of supervising them is much higher for managers in the law firm. In the law
firm, supervision of janitors comes at the expense of supervising and managing
highly paid legal and financial experts. Paying efficiency wages
wages above the
prevailing market rate
for janitors and clerical workers reduces supervisory time
by reducing shirking, absenteeism, and turnover among low-skilled workers.

In this chapter, we extended our dis-
cussion of labor markets beyond the
simple world of perfectly competitive
labor markets, where each side of the
labor market takes the market wage as
given. Labor unions have market
power
the ability to affect wages
on the supply side of the market, while
a monopsonist has market power on
the demand side of the market. When
workers know more about their pro-
ductivity than employers, this asym-
metric information provides an incentive for firms to increase
wages in order to increase the average productivity of workers.
Here are the main points of the chapter:
1 A union faces a trade-off between wages and total employ-
ment: An increase in the wage causes an output effect and an
input-substitution effect that combine to decrease the quan-
tity of labor demanded.
2 The gap between the union wage and the nonunion wage
will be relatively large when the price elasticity of demand for
a product is relatively low. Demand is relatively inelastic in
less-competitive product markets.
3 A firm facing a positively sloped labor supply curve must pay
a higher wage to hire more workers, and the marginal labor
cost exceeds the wage.
4 The equilibrium employment in a monopsony is less than the
equilibrium employment in a perfectly competitive market.
5 In a labor market with asymmetric information about worker
productivity, an increase in the wage may increase the aver-
age productivity of hired workers and increase profit.

Labor Unions
1.1
In the United States, union workers earn 
to 
percent more than nonunion workers
doing the same work. The union wage differential is
(larger/smaller) in most other industrial-
ized countries.

training costs and
the average experience level of workers.

1.8
Maximizing Labor Income. Consider a union that
faces a linear demand for its workers. The vertical
intercept is $40 and the slope is $0.20 per worker, so
the horizontal intercept is 200 workers. (Related to
Application 1 on page 709.)
a. The union faces a trade-off between the wage and
employment: For every $2 increase in the wage,
employment decreases by 
workers.
b. Suppose the union tentatively picks a wage of $30,
where the elasticity of demand for labor is 3.0 (in
absolute value). If the union decreases the wage by
5 percent, by how much will the quantity of labor
demanded increase? Will total labor income
increase or decrease?
c. Suppose the union s objective is to maximize total
labor income. What is the income-maximizing
wage and quantity of labor demanded?
1.9
Product Elasticities and the Wage Job Trade-Off.
Consider two unions, one in an industry where

3.0 (industry E), and one where the price elasticity of
demand is 2.0 (industry I). In both industries, the initial
wage is $30 and labor is responsible for half the cost of
production, so the percentage change in the product
price is half the percentage change in the wage. In each
industry, the initial employment is 100 workers.
Suppose each union increases its wage by 10 percent.
a. Compute the output effect of the wage increase for
each industry: Total employment in industry E
drops from 100 to 
; total employment
in industry I drops from 100 to 
.
b. Assume that there is no substitution effect from
changes in wages. Use two graphs to show the
effects of the increase in the wage on the quantity
of labor demanded.
1.10 Trade-Offs from Featherbedding. Suppose that
featherbedding increases the labor time per unit of
output from five hours to six and increases the firms
production cost and its price by 15 percent. The firm
initially produces and sells 100 units of output. If the
price elasticity of demand for the firms product is 2.0,
how will featherbedding affect the firms total demand
for labor?
1.11 Labor Demand Elasticity and Total Income.
Suppose a union s objective is to maximize the total
income of nurses (total money spent by firms on
nurses). At the current wage, the price elasticity of
demand for nurses is 0.75 (in absolute value).
a. Should the union increase or decrease the union
wage? Explain.
b. Is there a trade-off between wages and total
employment?
1.12 No Substitution Effect. Suppose the union wage rises
by 10 percent in an industry where input substitution is
impossible. Comment on the following: Firms cannot
substitute capital for the more expensive labor, so the
higher wage won t affect the quantity of labor demanded.
1.13 Equalizing Teacher Salaries. Consider a school that
can hire two types of teachers, average and high quality.
The vertical intercept of the supply curve for average
teachers is $50, and the slope is $1 per average teacher.
The vertical intercept of the supply curve for high-
quality teachers is $120, and the slope is $1 per high-
quality teacher. (Related to Application 2 on page 710.)
a. Initially, the wage for average teachers is $100 and
the wage for high-quality teachers is $160. Draw
the supply curves and compute the number of
average and high-quality teachers.
b. Suppose that unionization levels-up  the wage to
$130: Both types of teachers earn a wage of $130.
Use your supply curves to compute the number of
average and high-quality teachers. How has the
composition of the workforce changed?
c. Where have the high-quality teachers gone?
Monopsony Power
2.1
A monopsony occurs when there is a single

2.2
For a monopsonist, the marginal labor cost exceeds
the wage because to hire more workers, the firm must

2.3
A monopsonist hires workers to the quantity at which

2.4
A monopolist sells its output at a relatively
(high/low) price, while a monopsonist buys its inputs at
a relatively
(high/low) price.

Arrows up or down: If several hospitals in a city
merge into a single hospital, we expect a

Job-related celebrations in pubs suggest that the labor
supply curve is
(horizontal, positively
sloped). (Related to Application 3 on page 715.)
2.7
Elasticity of Supply. Consider the application,
Pubs and the Labor-Supply Curve,  which suggests
that workers switch jobs to get a bigger producer sur-
plus. Consider two types of workers, janitors in a
large city and radiology technicians in a medium-size
city with two hospitals. (Related to Application 3 on
page 715.)
a. Which type of worker is likely to get a larger
change in producer surplus when switching jobs?
b. What are the implications for the supply curves
facing the employers
janitorial firms and hospitals?
2.8
Competition versus Monopsony. Consider the fol-
lowing data on the supply of labor and the demand for
labor. The first three rows show the supply side of the
market, and the last two rows show the demand side.

that half of landscaping workers have a marginal-
revenue product of $40 and an opportunity cost of
$30 and the other half have a marginal-revenue prod-
uct of $60 and an opportunity cost of $45. A landscap-
ing firm cannot distinguish between the two types of
workers. (Related to Application 4 on page 717.)

What is the average productivity of its workforce? On
average, what is the firms profit per worker?
b. Suppose the firm increases its wage to $47. What is
the average productivity of its workforce? On
average, what is the firm s profit per worker?
c. What are the equilibrium wages?
3.7
Equilibrium with Efficiency Wages. Consider a
labor market with asymmetric information: Each
worker knows his or her marginal-revenue product,
but firms cannot distinguish between low-skill and
high-skill workers. Each low-skill worker has an
opportunity cost of $80 and a marginal revenue prod-
uct of $100, and each high-skill worker has an oppor-
tunity cost of $130 and a marginal revenue product of
$200. The workforce is divided equally between the
two types of workers. Fill in the blanks in the follow-
ing table.

Imperfect Information and Efficiency Wages

3.2
Arrows up or down: In a labor market with asymmet-
ric information, a firm will hire only low-productivity
workers if the firm s 
is less than the

3.3
In a labor market with asymmetric information, an
increase 
in 
the 
wage 
(increases/
decreases) the average productivity of the workforce
if the wage rises above the 
of high-
productivity workers.

tivity of a firm s workers by discouraging
