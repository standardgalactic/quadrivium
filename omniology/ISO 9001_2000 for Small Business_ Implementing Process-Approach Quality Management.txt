                                      PREFACE
This book is written for quality practitioners in manufacturing shop environments to aid
them in the understanding of how process-approach quality management is implemented
and practiced to the rigorous requirements of ISO 9001/2000. It is a completely integ-
rated system in which the organizational quality objectives are identified and interactive-
ly communicated in the fulfillment of internal and external customer requirements. This
is not a theory book, but a fact-impelled reality, based on experience, derived from actual
quality practice in manufacturing shops. Process-approach to quality management is the
preferred technique by ISO 9001/2000. It embodies a total commitment from organiza-
tions to establish, implement, and maintain a documented quality system that controls
process-driven interactions among all the internal and external parties in achieving
conformity of a product to quality requirements.
To control process-driven interactions among these parties, I have established a system-
wide integration of quality objectives and interactively structured them into all the core
departmental work assignments, creating a quality throughput system. By doing this, I
have interconnected the sequentially flowing work processes with the quality objective
criteria. At the same time, I have also identified the beginning and end of these
interacting work assignments to enable us to determine the process and quality
boundaries for each. This, now, allows us to measure performance results in each work
assignment as the flow-process is continuing toward product realization. By knowing the
performance results, we can promptly determine whether the process or the quality
requirements have been met and accordingly implement continual improvements. The
entire quality system’s procedures in this book have been designed to support this type of
organizational interaction with all the contractual parties, maintaining integration and
coherence in achieving internal and external customer satisfaction.
As a management representative in the sense of ISO commitments, I have taken the
lessons learned from being an ISO Rep and coupled them with the lessons learned from
my forty-years shop experience in manufacturing and produced this book. It contains the
necessary instructions, procedures, and examples, all integrated and accurately communi-
cated to the relevant work centers. My intention was to ensure that others would be able
to take this book and convert and implement their quality systems along the model of this
process-approach quality management system, without outside help. This process-
approach quality system is specially tailored for small businesses in the manufacturing
sector, incorporating all the quality system’s objectives in line with ISO 9001/2000
requirements. To ensure operational effectiveness, I have implemented and debugged this
system in real manufacturing environments. This is now the operating system with
several Connecticut based companies. The works contain the quality manual, quality
operating procedures, and appropriate forms. To ensure effective implementation, I have
created some 235 pages of flowcharts as a training aid, which can be converted to
become the quality operating procedures in small shops to replace text-type procedures.
This is a TQM system for small manufacturing firms, incorporating the P-D-C-A provi-
sions as a preventive quality tool and also as a corrective action tool.

                               DEDICATION
To my beautiful wife, Maria, who complained a lot about my wasting time on this book,
but still endured it and stayed faithful. To my loving son, Adam, who most of the time
wanted to escape my presence when I talked about the contents of this book, but still
willingly proofread it. To my loving daughter, Judy, always willing, but short on time,
nevertheless, can’t wait to read the book. I thank the Almighty God that the book is
finished.

                       ABOUT THE AUTHOR
Among all the college courses one can take to earn a degree in his chosen field, Quality
System Design and Management was not one of them. Arpad left college to learn it in
industry. He was researching why errors and mistakes occurred in just about anything
man did for others. Besides biblical connotations, he found that most of the time the
causes were the lack of adequate process instructions in relation to the expected work
results − that clear-cut instruction of what the quality requirements of the job were. He
published his first book on the subject in Hungarian in 1998.
Arpad runs his own business today and teaches small companies about the special-cause
variations that responsible employees introduce into the work processes
upstream/downstream that impact continuing assignments in product realization
processes with devastating results on cost, cycle time, and customer satisfaction. These
special-cause variations are the mistakes in planning and communication that employees
unknowingly transfer cross-functionally without detection. When they are detected, the
damage in work processes and products has been inflicted.
The book at hand is based on Arpad’s forty years experience in manufacturing in the
United States and Europe.  It is a quality management system in line with ISO
9001/2000, interactively designed to remove special-cause variations as customer
requirements are aligned with internal processes. It is also an integrated process-
approach system, tailored for self-implementation in two to six months in cross-
functional organizations and is fully convertible to meet one’s own specific requirements.

ACKNOWLEDGEMENT
 Just when I finished this book, it dawned on me how little I know without the
imagination, common sense, and good judgment of others. As I wrote these words down,
another thing came to mind. How can I express my appreciation to so many people,
living and dead, who unselfishly poured out their goodwill to help me, without hurting
someone’s feeling? I couldn’t. Because of this, it would be unwise for me to give thanks
to a few and leave out the many. If I did, I would be spending the rest of my life trying to
justify my reasons. But, let it be known to all those who have given me advice, support,
recommendation, criticism or rejection that my appreciation for their contributions is
such that words cannot describe. Only my prayers can provide the due acknowledgment
to each and all without leaving anybody stranded.

“Our Quality Management System is based on the process management principles defined by Mr. Gaal in
this book. We are a small company, employing about forty people in the aerospace related contract
manufacturing business. The processes and responsibilities are identified and the instructions on how to do
them are stated in understandable language. My employees follow the instructions and I don’t have to
worry what’s going on when I am not around. The quality operating procedures 006, 007, and 009 replace
Mil-I-45208 inspection system, as a functional inspection procedure for whatever there is to know how to
take care of controlling products as they go through the many operations. This book has the tell-me-how-to-
do-it. And this documented quality system, by defining and integrating the product related processes,
created the overall framework for us to keep focused on the most important part of our business, —
satisfying our customers. Our customers are very satisfied with the quality of our products and the business
is growing due in large measure to this documented quality system.”
Zbigniew Stanek, President, Aero-Craft Corporation
“The method for resolution of customer complaints is so thoroughly handled by the author of this book that
I don’t think anybody would ever lose a customer for non-responsiveness. What is really good here is that
solving problems is not a superficial matter, but an in-depth analysis to go to the source of the problem and
correct it. Furthermore, you cannot make a mistake in doing it because the instructions, especially the
flowcharts, are so clearly presented that even the most elementary mind would be able to follow it.
There is a natural evolution of operational sequencing going on in this book that I have found most
interesting. The interrelated processes are so cohesively presented that one doesn’t have to rely on theories
to explain them for the reality of events speak for themselves. I can take this book and show it to any of my
co-workers that this is how you should control the process you are working on. It is amazing how well
every part of the many processes are integrated and referenced to maintain an orderly follow-through.
I truly enjoyed reading this book for it has a directed force behind it to do things right from the beginning to
the end in maintaining organizational objectives. It would be a great business asset to any manufacturer to
control the most vital part of its business, the very shop where a product is realized.”
Eugene McMullan, National Sales Manager, Leon’s Bakery
“The attention to detail, the logic of process and the conclusion of the final product leaves one with a sense
of awe and fulfillment. One believes that he/she can develop and produce a system that will assure the
quality of any manufactured product. The structure of the Training Matrics, encompassed in a compact
232-page manual allows the reader full latitude to adjust the process to whatever his needs present. With
exacting detail and thoroughness, each process and action person is given a blueprint and flowchart that
defies misinterpretation. Additionally, all items are totally cross-referenced at the point of introduction to
allow the reader a different manner of learning and understanding. For me there are really four books in this
offering with an Executive Summary. The four main books are The Training Matrics, Quality Systems
Manual, Quality Operating Procedures, and Forms.
This work, in my opinion, provides the new or well-established manufacturer with a concrete, clear,
superbly documented means of developing their own Quality Management System. It provides great
latitude within its structure to account for individual needs, nuances, and style yet gives the rationale and
direction necessary to ensure the development of an effective entity within the boundaries of the
manufacturing plant. This has been a most enjoyable learning experience for me. I heartily recommend this
masterpiece to all who truly seek a verified means of providing excellence in manufacturing.”
R.C. Cormier, Adjunct Professor, University of Hartford

                             INTRODUCTION
The Reason
The most important part of any manufacturing business is the shop. That’s where the
product is made and that’s where the problems are concentrated. Problems come in
documents, processes, and methods with different impact on product quality or the way
we achieve it. This book will show you how to remove problems, but not necessarily with
conventional methods. The method we are using is known as Process-Approach Quality
Management, which manages product quality problems through prevention in every area
in the product’s life cycle. In the past, we have been focusing on problems most often
found at the end of the line. This process-approach system will go to the front of the line
instead and work with everybody who may not have realized that problems do flow down
from process to process which, eventually, impact both the product and customer
satisfaction. From here on, therefore, we will be working with process owners through
documented procedures in order to implement preventive work habits.
One reason why anybody would want to write a book is to fulfill a need. Many years ago,
when I needed advice on how to integrate organizational work processes to fall in line
with process-approach controls, I found no publication on the market to help me. I took
the challenge and spent seven years bringing it all together and issued it in this book, not
realizing at the beginning that there would be a time when others would have a need for it
also. That need has finally arrived due to the year 2000 revisions of the ISO 9000
standards. The book contains my forty years experience in manufacturing, the lessons
that are extremely important in practicing process-approach controls.
The quality system procedures, integrated and issued in this book, have been designed to
control work processes in a true production environment. This is how a process-approach
system should be implemented. Depending on the type of work assignment, work result
verification by process owners should be a requirement if we want to stem the flow of
errors from process to process. In a process approach quality management, controlling
product quality should not be confined to the manufactured parts alone, for all kinds of
document errors also account for a substantial part of the total non-conformance figure.
These, too, should be controlled not after their release, but at the time of issuance.
There is nothing in this book that has not been put through operational use to prove out
the validity of the system to practical applications in controlling the processes to which
the procedures apply. Those companies that implemented this quality management
system and have registered to ISO 9002/1994 can attest to that.
Therefore, the procedures presented here are qualified for implementation in shop
environments engaged in contract manufacturing services. Registration is not the main
objective here, compatibility to ISO 9000 is. Any alteration or conversion to add or
remove requirements from the presented material can be easily accomplished without
upsetting the basic procedural framework. Pages have been devoted under the ‘Guidance’
section to accommodate the prospective user in this effort.

4   INTRODUCTION
Inevitably, the question, how this can be possible, is going to be asked by all prospective
users. Just as the ISO 9000 standards don’t define the type of products they want the
guidelines to control, neither does this quality management system. The reasons are well
founded. When the work processes are maintained and controlled according to approved
procedures, the final product will meet the customer’s product quality requirements,
regardless what type of product was manufactured. The work assignments we are
controlling are directly tied to the evolution of processes in the work cycle and not to how
the detailed work methods are executed. Efficient work methods depend on the
experience and continued training of the work force and not on how the processes control
product quality. In our process-approach system, the responsible departments have been
charged individually and collectively to establish and implement the process steps needed
to complete work assignments, ensuring every step of the way the maintenance of
product quality, as required. The process steps in manufacturing shops are defined in Job
Travelers or Operation Sheets, or in combination of the two, and the product
specifications are defined in the drawings and attachments thereto. The skilled operators
will know what to do without burdening them with faulty work methods instructions,
which become the nitpicker’s paradise during audits. Therefore, we have intentionally
excluded them from the process-approach procedures.  We are not in the business of
work methods training, but rather in the business of controlling the processes which
control the product on its journey to customer satisfaction.
The following departments in manufacturing shops are the responsible bodies to plan,
implement, and execute the customers’ Purchase Order requirements from the beginning
to the end in the product’s life-cycle. They fall under the control of this process-approach
system. These departments are commonly known as core departments and they interact in
the chain of events to carry out customer requirements.
Contracts − charged with negotiating agreements with customers and flowing down
purchase order requirements to other departments;
Engineering − charged with laying out manufacturing processes, including software
programs, processing work instructions, production folders, etc.;
Purchasing − charged with ordering materials and lining up subcontractors;
Production Planning − charged with scheduling the manufacturing processes;
Manufacturing − charged with processing the products;
Inspection − charged with controlling product quality.
One of the objectives of writing these procedures was to limit the bulk of documents that
burden the quality system under ISO commitment. While documentation is important, not
every detail, especially work methods, should be in quality documents, for that alone
could choke production efficiency. Forgotten in this process is the fact that the workers
who are putting the quality in the product read basically only the processing dedicated
procedures. It is not the Tier levels of different documents that will guarantee acceptable
work results from process owners in the chain of the process cycle. Rather, it is the way
those Tier levels are integrated to link the quality requirements to the processes within the
organization’s overall commitment to product quality. In this effort, I have combined the
www.Ebook777.com

 ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   5
various Tier levels into two − the Quality System Manual and the Quality Operating
Procedures − to make the system suitable for small business applications, where low
overhead and multiple job assignments dominate the business environment.
A process-approach quality management system must incorporate continuous
improvement tools in every process that has anything to do with the product’s processing
cycle. That is the dominant objective of this process-approach system. As we read the
quality objective procedures in this book, we would hardly recognize that they are in fact
achieving not only product quality but also those aspects of the Total Quality
Management principles that accomplish continuous improvement. The whole process-
approach system is integrated in a closed-loop process control, enacted via the
application of twelve Quality Operating Procedures. To give you a taste of it, I have
listed below a few controlling provisions. Others will be experienced during
implementation and application.
1. The product quality requirements are identified, documented, and implemented in
process instruction procedures up front before any processing takes place.
2. The process is controlling the product and prevents the problems from migrating from
work center to work center in the processing cycle.
3. All the members of the organization are process owners, accountable for their work
assignments and working together as a team to prevent problems to take hold of the
process.
4. Standard quality objectives are maintained in all the processes to ensure consistent
product quality. When these objectives become ineffective, they are modified through
just-in-time corrective/preventive action to make them effective again. (Management
Reviews are not just-in-time corrective action tools.)
5. Non-conformance is handled as a continuous improvement tool, as it happens, where
it happens. Documented procedures ensure just-in-time implementation of
corrective/preventive action and follow-up.
6. Customer complaints and product returns are lessons learned, corrective action tools
and they are handled as a process to determine cause and corrective action.
7. Supervisory process surveillance is a time honored, on-the-spot corrective action tool
and is maintained through documented procedures.
8. Customer requirements and product quality awareness are maintained through regular
training, according to organized procedures in the Training Metrics.
As we step back for a moment and look at the individual components of this process-
approach system, we will recognize that they were designed by applying the General
System Theory to integrate and improve organizational teamwork and commitment to
effectively manage quality systems in manufacturing shops.
This book is a completely revised edition of the original text I published in Hungarian
under ISBN 963 04 9683 6 in 1998 (Title: Vilagpiac Minosegkovetelmenye). The
company name “MINFOR” used in this book’s procedures is my registered company in
Hungary. Lessons learned from the first edition made me realize that I needed a
completely new layout for this edition to enable me to incorporate training methods,

flowcharting, process ownership, continuous improvement tools, the handling of
customer complaints and product returns and many others. To make this process-
approach system a truly useful tool in small business quality management for the
manufacturing shops, I had to implement it, debug it and register it. What you see here is
a real operating system that you can also implement without any outside intervention.
Small business cannot follow the documentation system big business is pursuing. They
cannot afford it, much less maintain it.
The Purpose
The process of enacting product quality requirements is like a seed planted. It will not
grow to perfection unless all the conditions for it have been taken care of. This is also
true in a quality management system. The seed is the product and the conditions for
growth are the organization’s commitment to quality, ever more working toward
perfection to attain the objectives for quality to nourish customer satisfaction, internally
and externally.
When a product becomes non-conforming, let’s forget for a moment the exhaustive effort
of getting it right and look at the central point that evades our attention most of the time:
at what cost will it be right? Here is just one example that will tell the story.
1. Contracts – the administrator was sick and stayed home for several days. He didn’t
leave anybody in charge to follow up things. A customer faxed in a purchase order
line item change, altering configuration and material. The Receptionist ripped it off
and placed it on the administrator’s desk. Nobody else paid attention to it;
2. Engineering – still working to the requirements of the old purchase order, issued the
continuing job traveler, the operation sheet, and the drawing, as it did it before;
3. Purchasing – ordered the same material without knowing there was a change;
4. Production Planning – scheduled production the way the part was run before, being
unaware of changes;
5. Production – set the job up the way it used to run it before;
6. Inspection – checked the parts the way it always did. Accepted and released them for
shipment;
7. The customer returned the product as “Non-conforming to specification requirements,
due to purchase order amendments.”
Sounds familiar? Similar blunders take place every day, in a thousand different varieties,
in the real world of running a business. Can we fix it? I always have faith that we can.
But it will take some effort on the part of top management to realign organizational
commitments and departmental responsibilities to manage flow-down requirements to
prevent problems from taking over the processes.
This is the centerpiece of what this book is all about, − controlling departmental
responsibilities one after the other as the work process flows from contracts to
engineering, to purchasing, to planning, to production, and to inspection. ISO 9001/2000
calls this type of setup, “process-approach” in managing product quality. I have never
believed in anything else. For as long as we are part of an organization that has no

 ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   7
process control in place, we tend to pass on our mistakes to the next guy in the process
cycle, only to compound them progressively to impact cost and product quality. It’s bad
enough to have a problem anywhere in the processing cycle, but when it is at the end of
the line, it could wipe out any profit the organization counted on making on the project.
This book will integrate departmental responsibilities under a command and control
structure through the process-approach mechanism so that we can prevent the transfer of
mistakes from department to department. The details on how to realize this are laid out in
the procedural context, called Quality Operating Procedures (QOP). I wouldn’t dare to
call this book complete for everybody and for everything insofar as quality process
controls are concerned. However, what’s included here is more than adequate to
effectively manage core departmental quality requirements for product quality
enforcement in small businesses, engaged in contractual manufacturing relationships.
Writing procedures, to enforce process approach quality requirements in the evolution of
work assignments, must focus the work instruction definitions on preventive quality
measures. Preventive quality practices should not be only the aftermath of fault
discoveries, but rather the prerequisite in planning activities that eventually become the
specified work instruction. I have put extraordinary effort into writing my procedures to
include preventive measures wherever processes would impact product quality.
Customers require product quality excellence even though the purchase orders issued by
them may not always clearly define what they really want. A process-approach quality
management system must provide the enforcement vehicle by which product quality
requirements are imposed in the defined processes, whether customer purchase orders
clearly state the product quality requirements or not. To ensure that these requirements
are accurately flown down to the relevant processing centers, I have entrusted Quality
and Engineering with the responsibility to make that happen. The fulfillment of customer
satisfaction in manufacturing begins, first of all, by knowing up front what the customer’s
product quality requirements are.
In contractual relationship, the product quality requirements should be stipulated in the
contract (the PO). If they aren’t there, the customer doesn’t know what those
requirements are, or will accept those work results that the supplier is willing to build into
the product. In order to ensure that quality requirements will be built into the product,
they must be identified at the earliest possible moment the contract is issued, or even
earlier at the RFQ phase. Once identified, the requirements must be made part of the
work procedures (the Job Traveler and Operation Sheet) at all relevant process steps and
built into the product. Then verified that the work-results demonstrate compliance. In
order to make this happen, I have added documented procedures, enforcing this critical
requirement as soon as the customers’ purchase orders are issued and logged in. The
process is known as ‘Purchase Order Review’ and it is carried out by Quality Engineering
through the application of Form A-001, the first one of the many controlled forms used
for work results demonstration.

8   INTRODUCTION
The Objective
There should never be anxiety on the part of management over meeting customers’
product quality requirements. Ensuring customer satisfaction must start with the evolu-
tion of work procedures and not through backtracking after the problems have been
discovered at the end of the line. For, if we don’t understand up front our customers’
product quality requirements, we will not be able to build them into the product the first
time around.
In any defined processing cycle there are only two types of products going through the
product realization chain, − conforming and non-conforming products. Both must be
identified and controlled wherever and whenever they happen in the processing cycle.
Quality Operating Procedures 006 and 009 in this process-approach system handle these
controls very effectively. These procedures realistically represent the most important
controlling documents in any quality management system, for they are directly tied to
controlling product acceptance and rejection in the entire processing cycle.
Many times, when non-conformance during processing has been identified, work
continuation goes into a tailspin and everything stops in order to determine what
happened. In the majority cases, historically, document errors of all sorts cause the non-
conformance. Correcting the errors in documents could take anywhere from days to
weeks, especially if the customer is the government. These are, of course, not as frequent
as the internally generated document errors which cause the equipment, already in a
production mode, to be put on hold, pending the outcome of the investigation. In many
cases, this is completely unnecessary for the problems and causes become identifiable
right on the spot and immediately could be resolved between engineering and quality in
order to let production continue, if there were a procedure in place allowing them to do
that. I have carefully considered remedying situations like this and created the procedural
vehicle to take care of it. Quality Operating Procedure 002, Section Two, paragraph
3.03.1 provides the necessary steps needed to accomplish this. QOP 002 is the procedure
that deals with the control of documents and data for the whole quality system.
The process-approach quality management system presented in this book had also been
designed to enforce continuous improvement as the problems occur in all the areas of the
operating quality system. This has been locked into the documented mechanism of the
process-approach system. Every time nonconformance is reported and submitted for
MRB review, corrective action has to be determined and identified. The Management
Representative has to oversee the plan for implementation and follow-up to ensure
effectiveness. He cannot close out an MRB, form (A-006), until corrective action has
been effectively implemented. Experience tells me that failure to follow up corrective
actions promptly causes unrelenting repetition of the same problem and becomes the
beehive, emptied during management meetings. This is why I have locked in the follow-
up requirement as a just-in-time action item. Furthermore, doing corrective action, based
on periodic Management Review, is not at all effective in timely implementation of
changes. The customer can’t wait.
Very few things are more irksome to administrative and inspection personnel alike, than

the lack of guidance as to what to do with the heap of documents generated during a
day’s work. I have given special attention to this matter. Quality Operating Procedure
002, Section Three (Handling and Retention) lists all the applicable documents of the
quality system and gives guidance to each department as to where to file the pertinent
papers, when completed.
A very important element of this process-approach system is to take care of customer
complaints and the measurement of customer satisfaction in a coordinated fashion and on
a regular basis. Because these subjects have product non-conformance attributes,
especially in the manufacturing area, I have defined the responsibility and the
administration for them under Quality functions. To simplify this undertaking, I have
designed a single form to take care of both assignments (Form A-038). The details for
this are covered in Quality Operating Procedure 009, Section Three. The application of
this form in non-manufacturing areas is not advisable. While the manufacturing
companies most of the time use measurable results to determine customer satisfaction,
this cannot always be said of the service industry.
Not all the small companies want text-type procedures, such as the ones included here, in
order to manage their operations effectively. Those that have only a few employees may
prefer to guide themselves with flowcharts. That was one of the reasons why I have
earmarked (shaded) the primary processes in the flowcharts presented in this book. By
retaining the primary processes along with the connected instructions and the header
(page plate) on each page, the flowcharts can serve as documented procedures with the
quality manual and the forms in controlling one’s manufacturing operations. A few clicks
with the mouse can remove very neatly any unneeded portions in the flowcharts. The
flowcharts have also been fully integrated with the quality manual and forms just as the
text-type procedures have been, creating a  ‘global’ linkage of the quality system.
To ensure that the Quality Management System procedures presented in this book qualify
for operational implementation in a small business, manufacturing environment, I have
worked with a Connecticut based company to make that a reality. After implementation,
this company registered itself to ISO 9002/1994. The Certificate Registration Number is
253, issued by HSB Registration Services, a fully accredited member of ANSI/RAB.
I would like to go on explaining other innovative features embodied in the presented
procedures that represent the process-approach quality management system, but find it
unnecessary because they will be recognized upon application. Also, the “Guidance”
section behind this page will cover the operational elements of the system. For a quick
glance as to how the procedures are integrated with requirements and responsibility in
this process-approach system, please look up Quality Operating Procedure (QOP) 012,
Sections One and Two at the end of Book Section Three. It will give you a close-up view
of the operational communicating tool that also satisfies ISO 9001/2000 requirements.
For those companies wanting to align their ISO 9001/1994 quality system documents to
meet the requirements of ISO 9001/2000, I have provided the identification of changes
and at the same time given guidance how to implement them. These are located under
Appendix Five.

General Information
This book has four sections. Each is devoted to specific requirements.
Book Section One  − The Training Metrics (pg 34)
Book Section Two  − The Quality System Manual (pg 267)
Book Section Three − The Quality Operating Procedures (pg 291)
Book Section Four  − The Forms (pg 452)
Basic explanation about each section –
1.0   The Training Metrics – (Book Section One)
1.1    Background
The word Quality in small business mostly means inspecting parts. Rarely would anybody think
that it could be much more than that. When we look at a small business, regardless what it
makes, it is made up of functional departments like big business, but much less of it. It is still
run by people, − the hierarchy. How often when we inspect parts and find something wrong, do
we point to higher-ups in the organization for the cause of it? It is much harder to solve
problems upstream in a hierarchy than downstream from it. Take this fact from me. I have gone
through forty-two companies in forty years. They made plastic parts, fasteners, diodes, sheet
metal parts, printed wiring boards, optics, special processes and a host of other things. And I
have found the same setup everywhere. We are more focused on getting parts out the door than
controlling in-processes to avoid problems. We would rather rework the parts or even junk them
than cure the source of the problem that caused it. Higher-ups have authority with immunity
from blame. Most often the cause of problem points to the leadership for not being able to
recognize that managing product quality pulls in with it the whole organization, for the cause of
problems can be as many as there are people within an organization. So let’s put the controls
into the system and let the system control everybody alike, regarding product quality.
This is where process approach in managing quality brings everybody together within an orga-
nization in order to limit the transfer of problems from the beginning to the end, from one as-
signment to the next assignment. This is where every person within an organization becomes a
process owner and responsible for controlling his/her own work process. Training every person
within an organization is the key in understanding how process approach in product quality
management works.
During a training session, I was explaining this process approach concept to people with admin-
istrative and supervisory responsibilities. The explanation alone didn’t work. The people had
only limited concept in recognizing the chain of events that took place in a product’s life-cycle.

12   GUIDANCE
They could not follow the interconnecting steps of how a product is moved from one process to
the next, from contracts to planning, to engineering, to purchasing, to production, to inspection,
and out to the customer. They tried to put my words into a road map. And it worked for the first
few minutes. Then, as time went on, people lost track of what comes after what. Yet, nobody
spoke up, raised his hand, or jumped out of his seat to tell me, “I just can’t get it!” This training
session went on for a few days before I realized what was missing: − the picture. I suspended
the training for a week.
At home, I started planning and drawing flowcharts. I took the entire quality system and broke it
down into its structural elements − the General System Theory process. I was the student and
not the teacher. If I couldn’t understand it, nobody else could, I said. The wastebasket was fill-
ing up in the meantime. Time was pressing me to move, for the week was almost over. Pretend-
ing that I must get a good night’s sleep on account of work tomorrow, I urged everybody in the
family to go to bed early. We did.
As I heard my wife going into a deep, rhythmical breathing, I crept away from her. She was
sleeping. Until that time, I was praying. In between, I was imagining how the flowcharts should
be sequenced. Praying?! Yes, praying. When you can’t see the light at the end of the tunnel,
that’s when you look up. That’s where you find the Almighty Hand blocking the light. And
that’s how your prayers remove the blockage.
In my makeshift office, I had already sheets upon sheets of flowcharts. I looked at them in the
silence of the night. Everybody was gone. Now, I took all the sheets and jammed them into the
wastebasket. Childish! I said. I decided not to try running through the whole quality system,
giving a little bit here and a little bit there. I changed direction and went back to the beginning −
the process-approach. It made a lot of sense. This way accomplishing training, accomplishing
process controls, and accomplishing product quality, I could focus, step by step, on what was
needed to make the interconnection, making each step build on the work results of the previous
steps. The commonly used statistical tools guided me in the right direction. (See book page 504)
This is how the whole Training Metrics and the Quality Operating Procedures in this book were
developed − step by step, right from the beginning. My students, the leaders of the company,
remarked after seeing the flowcharts, “How come, we didn’t start out that way, anyway?” I was
embarrassed. “Ignorance!” I replied.
1.2   What will the flowcharts do for you
They will give you the step by step understanding how a quality system is structured. How the
processes of the system interrelate with each other. What-to-do and what not-to-do. The expla-
nations, the recommendations, the advice, the instructions and the warning notes, all in all, lead
the user to make meaningful interpretations about a quality system that is built on process-
approach. The training metrics is a tool that guides the reader in understanding the primary
processes, illustrating those assignments that are needed to integrate core departmental func-
tions in carrying out flow-down requirements. As such, they have been closely integrated with
the quality manual, the text-type quality operating procedures, and the forms issued in this book.

                                                                                                        ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   13
Besides being a training material for those in need to know how a quality system in a small-
shop environment should work, the flowcharts can also be used as a checklist in determining the
proper flow process and requirements of a given assignment. Anybody can use the training
metrics to establish a quality system. It gives guidance on how to structure the quality manual −
the paragraph numbering, the revision controls, the interfacing references, the page plating
requirement and a lot more. Similarly, it gives guidance how to put together and control the
process instructions (Quality Operating Procedures) and the forms. It shows how to integrate a
quality management system that is tailored to fit the working conditions in small business. What
it gives you is the real world, the hands-on experience as it happens, as you are running a
business on a hectic schedule. What you will find here is what is practiced every day in getting
the work done, according to both the customer and internal requirements in maintaining product
quality for customer satisfaction.
1.3   How to use the flowcharts
Flowcharts are point to point indicators of how a process flows in line with planned expecta-
tions. In this book, we are using the flowcharts to give direction as to how the planned pro-
cesses and assignments are accomplished in a quality system. To do this, we needed geometrical
figures to express and differentiate what are primary, alternate, and parallel processes, as well as
instructions, advice, notes and explanations. All in all, the flowcharting techniques tie every
thing together to create that lasting picture to focus our attention on how we should do things.
Here are the flowcharting figures we use in the Training Metrics:                             (flow)
   The input
To show where a process starts, we use an oval figure. It is shaded.
        The work process
We use a rectangle to indicate the primary, alternate, and parallel processes.
We find here written, the essential steps in the process flow, leading
to the completion of an assignment. Both the primary and parallel processes
are also shaded.
Then comes the decision diamond that will interrupt the primary process,
for something that was needed to be done before we could go on, or needed
to divide a primary process into two or more other processes in order to
complete an assignment. The diamonds are also shaded.
To inter-connect process steps, we use straight lines (not arrows)
      The   output
To show where a process has ended, we use a rhomboid. It is not shaded.
(Don’t look for the customary “OVALS.” I want to avoid any confusion.)
To indicate that more processes belong together to complete the whole task,
we use this symbol to split one from the other.

As we go from page to page, we use a circle to indicate
that the process is still continuing.

An interrupted process example:
      Do-over
       yes
     no
     Figure 3
In order to make flow diagrams understandable for the purposes of training, I have added  instruc-
tions and other notations where they were needed. This would not have been possible without the
use of additional flowcharting figures. In this application then, they become the just-right consult-
ing tools without the presence of the consultant (See Figure 4 and 5). In reality, this is a question and
answer session. We will find the use of this method interwoven even with the primary processes (See
Figure 6). The examples below will illustrate this.
Most of the Training Metrics have Basic Information provided to understand the specifics that relate to
the questions posed by the decision diamonds. The answers to these are given inside the rhomboidal
figures. The flowcharting figures used with Basic Information are not shaded.

1.4   Summary
The Training Metrics  takes  the  place of  expensive  consulting and it comes free with this book.
There are twelve separately grouped Training Metrics issued in this book, corresponding to the
twelve text-type Quality Operating Procedures (QOP) found in Book Section Three.
A few things are worth to remember when using the Training Metrics:
1. Each procedure in the Training Metrics contains full coverage for the corresponding sections
found in the Quality Operating Procedures, and as needed, additional information as well.
2. Use the Training Metrics and the Quality Operating Procedures together, section for section,
      to understand the full scope of process requirements.
3. References are given everywhere for the application of forms. They are needed all the time,
      once a quality system has been implemented. They show the recorded work results − the
      evidence to prove compliance to requirements. Remember them.
4. The Training Metrics have been fully integrated with the requirements of the quality system
      manual in this book. They can serve in creating your own quality system; they can guide
      you to implement and maintain your system; they can be used as your own training metrics;
      and finally, they can be converted into your own process instruction procedures.
 2.0   The Quality System Manual −−−− (Book Section Two)
The manual in  this  book  follows  the  requirements  of  ISO 9002/1994. It is intentionally con-
structed according to the clause numbering system of  the  Standard for a very good reason. ISO
9001/2000 ignores the descriptive layout of the  quality system requirements as that is known in
the manufacturing  sector. ISO 9001/1994  covered  this  quite  well. We  are  talking about core
departmental  responsibilities − Contracts,  Purchasing,  Engineering, Planning, Processing, and
Inspection. These  are  the vital, functional departments  that are interacting in the processes of a
product’s life-cycle. We  can  easily  recognize  and  determine these functions as we look at the
contents of the ISO 9001/1994. This  is  not  the case in ISO 9001/2000. It tries to be everything
to everybody and puts the quality  requirements  out  of order without tying them to any specific
industry. A small business  owner  would  have  to  hire a  consultant just to understand what the
Standard  is  trying  to say,  never  mind  implementing it. Without the assistance of consultants,
small  business  owners  would  be  locked out of the  benefits  that ISO 9001/2000 should bring
about through its TQM framework.

Therefore, in this book, ISO 9001/2000 implementation  takes  place  through  process-approach
quality  management, the  way  business  owners  run  their  businesses  in  manufacturing.  Any
business owner in the manufacturing sector can take this book and implement his quality system
from it  without  consultants. Additionally, companies  that  are registered to ISO 9002/1994 can
also convert their system, simply  by  following  the  explanations given under Appendix Five at
the end of the book. The only  caution  I  should  give you, however, is that if you need to incor-
porate sector specific requirements, follow  the technique I have used  in incorporating AS 9000
in this book. If you don’t need to, you will have an ISO compatible  quality management system
based  on  your  manufacturing  business  processes,  ensuring  organizational  focus  on product
quality, integrated performance measurement, and a locked-in continuous improvement.
The quality manual in this book identifies the product quality requirements from ISO 9002/
1994, for that is the suitable framework for the maintenance of product quality in manu-
facturing. Within this framework, I have implemented the requirements of ISO 9001/2000. I
have not “personalized” the manual because that doesn’t seat well with the formal structure of
the process-approach system in this book. Furthermore, the work instructions as to how to
accomplish processes have been removed from the Quality Operating Procedures and replaced
by process instructions. This development allows this quality system to be used as a model in
the manufacturing sector.
Inasmuch as the manual follows the layout of 9002/1994, the main emphasis is placed on core
departmental responsibilities and decidedly on the assignments within these departments. Why?
The core departmental responsibilities in contracts, purchasing, engineering, planning,
processing, and inspection are all grounded in product related activities all day. These are the
departments that have to deal with the realities to move the contracted product from the
purchase order phase to the shop floor and to the shipping dock, ensuring that product quality is
maintained everywhere. To make all this happen in a constructive way and with as little
problem as possible, the ground rules have been incorporated in every quality objective
procedure. This is the process-approach system. This is where the Quality System Manual
becomes a book of commitments. I have so worded this document that the requirements of the
quality system are structurally linked to the Quality Operating Procedures which contain one or
more Quality Objective Procedure.
No quality management system is easy to understand in terms of implementation and operation.
For this reason, I have chosen only the core departmental assignments in managing quality
requirements in small business, paving the way through the conversion methods to incorporate
the non-product related areas of the business later, once the cost benefits of the process-
approach system are realized.
2.1   How to use the Quality Manual in this book
The best way to use the Quality System Manual is to understand what each main clause (4.1,
4.2, 4.3, … 4.7, 4.8, … etc.) is stating. Then, go from there to the referenced Quality Operating
Procedure. If there isn’t any QOP given, the manual itself contains the process instructions in
the sub-clauses. Example: paragraph 4.20 − Statistical Techniques.

18   GUIDANCE
It will not be long before you notice that the manual has incorporated a sector specific standard,
AS 9000. This has been done for a couple of reasons. First, to cover the metal cutting industry,
− shops in the aircraft parts machining sector would have a need for it. Second, it will serve as
an example of how other sector specific standards can also be incorporated likewise. TL-9000,
ISO 14001, and QS 9000 Standards can be similarly adapted. While I’m on this subject, I
should note that the sector specific standards rely on ISO 9000 as the primary requirement in the
maintenance of quality systems. The sector specific requirements are add-on requirements and
they can be easily aligned with every requirement in the quality manual presented here. In my
case, by the expansion of the sub-clauses, I was able to incorporate the requirements of AS9000.
What this really means is that whether it is my manual or yours, the basic ISO 9000
requirements would have to be covered first for each clause, other than exclusions.  Then would
come the add-on requirements.
Just a few pages below (on pg 23), I will be spending some time with you explaining conversion
techniques in all areas of the quality system in order to facilitate adding or taking away require-
ments.
2.2   Summary
We will not mention on this page how to put together a quality manual, for that is already given
in the Training Metrics in QOP 002. Nevertheless, some things need to be highlighted.
1. Management must define its commitments and objectives to quality.
(See Mission Statement in the QSM, clause 1.1)
2. The quality system manual must state in policy statements what are the responsibilities of
the organization to product quality. (See clause 4.1.2.1)
3. The policy statements should be written in commending language (shall), short and clear.
(Elaborate here only the essentials. Hold details to a minimum, for you have to give account
as to how you carry them out.)
4. The manual must give references to other controlling documents.
5. The manual must be a controlled document. (See the headers (page plate) on each page in
the manual.)
6. The manual must state the applicable Standard from which the requirements have been
imposed. (Find this in the Mission Statement)
7. The quality system manual is a policy document. It must contain definition as to product
quality responsibilities and objectives for the operating system. All statements expressed in
the manual must be accounted for.
I could go on and on here and write easily thirty pages about manual construction. It would not
help much without illustration. Instead of fragmenting the matter, I have presented the whole
quality manual for you to look at. See it in Section Two in this book. Use it as your picture in

ten thousand words. You can rewrite it or use it as it is, if it suits your particular product quality
requirements. Don’t forget to put your name on it.
3.0   The Quality Operating Procedures −−−− (Book Section Three)
The Quality Operating Procedures (QOP) are process instructions. As such, they are the second
Tier documents in this book, outlining and elaborating the quality objective requirements of the
quality system manual. They have a structural layout of their own and are controlled no less
than the manual is. In order to maintain the linkage in documents, the QOPs refer back to the
manual to identify from where the requirements have been taken. They must also refer to those
documents in which the documentation (record keeping) is carried out. This way, the linkage
among documents is maintained forward and backward to ensure that the quality system is fully
integrated. All this has been structured into the QOPs in this book to make them a practical
document to be relied on as the source material in controlling work processes. QOP 012,
Sections One and Two, gives you the put-thru index for quick navigation between procedures
and requirements. Section One is the operational put-thru, while Section Two steps in to handle
non-conforming cases. Book page numbers have been given throughout in order to facilitate
finding the referenced materials.
On every page of every QOP there is a header (page plate) to indicate the document’s control-
ling mechanism − issue and revision date, revision level, page number, document approval and
references to the QSM and Forms.
To understand how to construct process instruction procedures, please refer to the “Training
Metrics” in Book Section One under QOP 002 (pg 66,67,68). It’s right after the manual’s con-
struction methods.
The level of detail in describing the process instructions in my procedures has been kept inten-
tionally in line with the required skill level of the process owners. The instructions are not a
beginner’s procedure. If they were, they would lose practicality of application with skilled
people. The work methods on how to carry out the identified processes have been removed
(“work method” is also known in the industry as “work culture”). Processing related work
methods instructions should be given in the Job Travelers and Operation Sheets, as required.
Inspection related work methods instructions should be defined in the “Inspection Instruction
Sheets” (IMS), as required. Work methods instructions are as varied as companies are. This
process-approach management system or any other quality management system would flunk on
arrival if it tried to standardize the work methods instructions and present it as a model.
QOP 006 (Control of Inspections, pg 127 or 357) and QOP 009 (Control of Non-conforming
Products, pg 199 or 403) are the heart of the procedures. Through the application of these two
process instructions, we regulate product quality enforcement of the business, for they control
what is conforming and non-conforming. This should be the most familiar ground for all quality
professionals. Under the military standards, product-quality was dominantly controlled through
them. Therefore, these two sets of documents require most of our attention. They are long, all
inclusive procedures and require the use of most of the forms.

20   GUIDANCE
The Quality Operating Procedures that support this quality management system have been de-
signed with paper reduction in mind. Instead of creating individual operating procedures for
every assignment identified in the system, I have combined those assignments that belong to the
same work category under one operating procedure and called them quality objective proce-
dures instead. Take for instance, Quality Operating Procedure 006. It has seven individual
sections. Every assignment deals with an inspection requirement − first piece, first article,
process control, final, receiving, customer source, and subcontractor source inspections. The
other QOPs follow the same grouping setup as much as possible. Approximately 150 pages
have been saved by this consolidation effort. When I think of the time that process owners
wasted on reading inflated procedures, I place myself into their shoes, for many times I myself
wore them.
The Quality Operating Procedures presented in this book are controlled and linked together by
the application of a dedicated Master List. The Master List identifies each operating procedure
and lists the sectional titles and provides revision status indication for each operating proce-
dure. It has its own revision recording page to indicate changes impacting the individual
procedures. This is how the ‘Procedures Manual’ is controlled. Apart from this, the individual
operating procedures are also controlled, first by a page header, second by their individual
revision control page. To carry out the steps in doing the changes and other relevant controls, I
have issued Quality Operating Procedure 002 for that reason (pg 60 or 311). To do it even easier
than following text instructions, I have provided flowcharting methods for guidance. It is
located under “Training Metrics” in QOP 002 (pg 60). This QOP is the very longest of all
procedures, for whatever you need to do with the quality system’s documents, this is the place
to find it. (I would like to add a word of caution here, regarding the distribution of the Quality
Operating Procedures. The procedures as a whole should be kept together in a binder, titled
Procedures Manual. Otherwise, they would be scattered all over the place and controlling them
would be impossible.)
Writing process instructions is about the most  demanding  thing to do, for we are always facing
the unknown − how long should the instruction part of it be. I have learned from my own
experience that writing instructions to employees should be based in general on two basic
requirements:  (1) the general skill and experience level of the work force, (2) the complexity of
the assignment. The first one is where we can easily be carried away and bore the work force to
death with it. When an employee has to spend more time on understanding the process instruc-
tion  than getting the work done, then that process instruction is counter-productive. This is why
you will find that the QOPs in this book are just a little bit more than basic outlines of the steps
needed to accomplish the identified process assignments. And that’s the way it should be, for an
experienced employee knows the steps of his/her process assignment better than what the
written words can tell. In fact, all of us procedure writers should learn first how the employees
are doing their work before we try to tell them how we would like them to do it. And just one
more thing, the extent of the detail in process instructions can be the richest ground to every
auditor to find that “You are not doing what you said you do!” Process instructions should not
be training procedures. In my case, I have provided the Training Metrics for that purpose.
3.1 Summary
The Quality Operating Procedures are stand-alone documents, fulfilling the stated objectives of
the Quality Manual. They are individually identified and controlled: 1. by a page header on

                                                                                                        ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   21
every page (page plate), and 2. by its own revision control page. As a group, they are identified
and controlled by Master List, which has its own header and revision page. When these
procedures are issued to the floor, they should be held together in a binder and titled as
Procedures Manual. Individual distribution of the Procedures Manual should be maintained, for
we should always know who has them. As we make changes to them, we need to recall them.
For this purpose, Form A-010 was created (pg 465).
Other information regarding the use of Quality Operating Procedures:
1. Use the Table of Contents in front of every procedure to quickly find the title of interest;
2. Use the Master List to identify QOP numbers, title and revision status (pg 36 or 293);
3. The interrelationship among documents is referenced everywhere in the procedures, as
needed;
4. Paragraph sections that pertain to AS 9000 are indicated in “bold” throughout the
procedures;
5. For each Quality Operating Procedure, there is a Training Metrics provided. It is identified
with the same QOP number and title.
4.0   Forms – (Book Section Four)
There is no worthwhile quality system in any business without being able to prove that work
results meet the customer’s specification requirements. Record keeping shows the evidence of
compliance and the use of the forms provides the means to accomplish it. For this reason, the
forms, applied in conjunction with process instruction procedures, are tailored to meet the spe-
cific needs of individual quality objectives. They are identified and referenced, as required, in
each quality objective procedure. I have kept them as a group, separated them from the
individual procedures, only for the reasons of practical handling and control. Most of them are
very familiar forms and are easily understood by quality professionals everywhere. What is not
so easily understood, however, is how to control and retain them. I have not spared words or
pages to ensure that this matter would leave no questions to the readers. Every form fulfills a
need and is accordingly controlled. The application of the forms is described in each quality
objective procedure as the work-specific tasks require them. Special attention has been given in
QOP 002, Section Three (pg 85 or 328), to the filing and retention control of every form
identified in this book. This is also an ISO requirement this time around.
Record keeping is the most hated chore in running a quality system, for it requires accuracy and
completeness. Being fully aware of this from my own experience as inspector and documenta-
tion auditor, I have paid particular attention in designing the forms user-friendly, making data
recordings to fall in line with process flow requirements. But, as with anything we do, we think
we are doing great, then somebody else comes along who can do it much better. I encourage all
users to evaluate each form and change it in line with the requirements of his/her own needs.
All the forms used in this book have been identified and organized in order that we can easily
recognize what they stand for. To facilitate the reader in this area, each form has been numbered
in sequential order − A-001, A-002, A-003, etc. and is given a title that comes as close to the
process application as possible. References to the use of forms have been given everywhere as

22   GUIDANCE
required, both in the quality manual and in the process instruction procedures. Furthermore,
easy identification and control is facilitated by the assignment of the Master List, which is
located in front of the collection. To keep track of changes, as we occasionally have to make
them, a revision control sheet is provided and is located right behind the Master List. The
method of how to carry out changes to documents, including forms, is detailed in QOP 002,
Section Two, and also in the Training Metrics bearing the same QOP number and section.
It is sometimes mind-boggling for inspection personnel and especially new people to know at
once what all the quality forms stand for and how, when, and where they are applied. In order to
help to find quickly where the relevant information is on the application of a form, each form
has been marked with a reference locator. You may look at the bottom left on each form and go
from there to the referenced source material to find the details on its application.
Changes to the forms issued in this book are inevitable, for there are so many different ways
products can be controlled. One of the reasons why the forms have been provided in this book
was to give a complete guidance to the readers as to how they should be established, identified,
integrated, and controlled in a process-approach quality management system designed for small
businesses. The other was to see how they are integrated with the procedures.
5.0   A Few Words on Implementing this Process-Approach System
The toughest decision we have to make when it comes to implementation is where to start.
Changing over from the old system to the new system carries with it the inherent uncertainties
stemming from not having experience with the new system. Fortunately, the quality system
presented in this book is not a new system. Although there are innovations in it, like the appli-
cation of Form A-001 “Purchase Order Review Sheet,” and A-009, “Amendment to
Procedures,” the basics are based on already proven practices, repackaged to bring
organizational interaction together to create a process approach system. What is found in this
system should not be new at all to those who operated to Mil-Q-9858 and Mil-I-45208.  What
will be somewhat unfamiliar, however, is the universally hated requirement of accurate and
complete documentation of work results. This too, should not be taken as overbearing, for I
have removed unnecessary paperwork and basically limited record keeping to product quality
enforcement. So, before implementing anything this book offers, the user should first know his
current system in order to be able to realign it with the procedural norms presented here. Then,
start the implementation in the following order:
(Use the Training Metrics to help the implementation process)
1. Start at the very beginning, the Contract Department. Implement first all four sections of
Quality Operating Procedure 001, given in Book Section Three − Control of RFQ; Purchase
Order Review; Verbal Purchase Orders; and Amendment to Contract. The reason for this is
to prevent the flow-down of errors right from the beginning.
2. Then, implement Section Five (Receiving Inspection) from Quality Operating Procedure
006. With this move, you will limit the flow-in of deficient products from the outside.

                                                                                                        ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   23
3. Then, implement Section Four (Final Inspection) from Quality Operating Procedure 006.
This will prevent the outflow of deficient parts.
4. While implementing the above three steps, issue form A-033 (Operator Product Verification
Record) to those process owners who are responsible to put quality in the product. This
move will cut down the generation of internally flowing non-conforming parts. (See the
application of Form A-033 in QOP 006, Section One, par 3.01, pg 135 or 364.)
5. Now, take care of all the rejects by implementing Quality Operating Procedure 009, Control
of Non-conforming Products, and start the corrective action and follow-up process.
6. By this time there should be plenty of records generated. Implement now Section Three
(Handling and Retention of records) from Quality Operating Procedure 002.
7. Now, implement the rest of the Quality Operating Procedures in line with work processing
requirements. It will be a must to implement them as they are integrated within the
provisions of the already implemented operating procedures.
I have given you here the very same methods that I am using even today in implementing the
same system presented in this book. The usual six months to a year implementation time, I am
managing within two to three months. The biggest drawback to faster implementation I have
encountered was creating organizational unity to integrate the system. Old habits are tough to
give up by certain employees. Handle it as raising kids. Show and tell over and over again.
6.0   Conversion Methods
The basics…
Think for a moment and ask yourself:  “What type of product am I supplying to my customers?”
The answer to this question will determine the type of Standard(s) you need to have. Sector
specific requirements are add-on requirements to the basic ISO requirements.
6.1   The quality manual in this book fulfills the requirements of:
1. ISO 9002/1994 and 9001/2000;
2. AS 9000 ( is a sector specific requirement for aircraft-parts makers);
3 The clause layout of the quality manual is identical to the layout of ISO 9002/1994. The
requirements and updating features to ISO 9001/2000 are shown in Appendix One, pg 499,
and implemented as explained in Appendix Five, pg 509, at the end of the book.
4 The sector specific requirements (AS9000 in our case) have been added at the end of the
main clauses in the sub-clauses, following the way other sector specific standards have
added their own requirements.
If we wipe out the sub-clause information from the manual that relates to AS 9000, we have
created a basic all-purpose quality manual that is compatible with ISO 9001/2000. When a
requirement of the new Standard doesn’t apply to a company’s product or service it provides, it
can be excluded. This is what I did also in paragraph 4.4 and 4.19. When a requirement of the

24   GUIDANCE
Standard is omitted, however, the reason for its omission must be stated in the manual. The
manual in this book has been provided for guidance also in establishing, implementing,
integrating and maintaining a process-approach quality system in core departmental activities in
manufacturing. (Omission of requirements is strictly controlled by clause 1.2 of ISO 9001/00.)
6.2   Three areas to be concerned with when making changes to the manual:
         A quality manual is the primary document of a company, describing the commitments
         and objectives (requirements) of the quality system and linking them to the process in-
         struction procedures in the QOPs. This process is called integrating the system.
When we add requirements to or take away requirements from the manual (as with sector
specific standards), we also have to add or take away the process instruction references and the
instructions to it in the lower-tier procedures. This is how we flow down the addition or removal
of requirements from the quality manual and the process instruction procedures. When we add
requirements to the manual and don’t define how we are going to comply with it, either in the
manual or in the process instruction procedures, we are in violation. When we are removing a
requirement and don’t wipe out the process instructions and references to it, we are again in
violation. This is the easiest way to confuse the system and also flunk the audit. So, when we
make changes, we must cross check the system’s documents in order to ensure that we have
made an accurate and complete reconciliation (resolved the differences) in the flow-down
process. Part of this reconciliation process may or may not impact the system’s forms. When it
does, we either revise the existing form or add a new form.
The entire process-approach system presented in this book is a very simple setup. Two different
but inter-linked manuals embody the control of the entire product quality requirements in a
small business − the quality manual and the operating procedures manual. The quality manual
states the requirements. The process instructions in each quality objective procedure implement
and maintain those requirements. Navigation between procedures is straightforward. From the
Quality Manual, we look up the references and go to the Quality Operating Procedure(s). The
process instruction procedures for each quality objective will identify its own form(s) needed to
record work results. When making changes, we should follow these flow-down steps in the
same manner. By doing so, we can add or remove any clause, paragraph, or sector specific
requirement from the manual and the quality operating procedure with just a few clicks of the
mouse.
         The quality manual must give references to lower-tier documents to indicate where the
         process instructions or other relevant documents can be found.
In the presented quality manual, these references to the Quality Operating Procedures (QOP) or
to the forms are given under each applicable clause, as required.
         Furthermore, a quality manual must be a controlled document. It must indicate revision
          level, issuance date, and approval. Its pages must be numbered. And as you make changes
          to it, they must be recorded. To successfully incorporate the changes in all the distributed
          manuals, they should be tracked as to the individuals who have them.

Please turn to the manual now (found under Book Section Two, pg 267) and check out these
three controlling conditions circled above. They will have to be remembered as long as you
operate a quality system, for these are standard rules for controlling changes, linkage and
integration in procedures, whether it’s my manual or yours. For the details as to how to carry
them out, please refer to QOP 002, Section Two (pg 71 or 317). The Training Metrics in Book
Section One, under the same QOP identification, will flowchart the process steps for you and
also give you additional advice.
7.0   Controlling Flow-down Requirements:
In a process-approach quality system, performance responsibility of one process owner interacts
with the performance responsibility of another process owner. The whole processing cycle of a
contracted product is interdependent from the beginning (contracts) to the end (shipping). The
procedures in this book, established to regulate this type of quality management, follow the
same interdependency from the beginning to the end. So, as we make changes in one area, we
must first consider the impact they make elsewhere in the chain of events, before we can
implement them. This is called the flow-down impact verification. As such, a bunch of things
have to be done one after the other to ensure that we carry the changes through in a controlled
manner.
Let’s go through the process now to show you how AS 9000 was added to the procedures. Simi-
larly, you can also add or remove any other sector specific requirement or the requirements of
your own particular business by following the same method. A word of caution must be added
here, regarding AS9000 requirements. Most of these requirements are plain, commonsense re-
quirements that are actually needed if we want to run an effective, truly coordinated quality ma-
nagement system, − not just in the metal cutting business, but elsewhere also. So, when chop-
ping these requirements away, please consider first what will happen without them.  Truthfully,
I have done the same thing and incorporated a number of them in the very procedures presented
in this book.
It was already noted that sector specific requirements are add-on requirements to ISO
9001/1994 and that they are imposed by the expansion of sub-clauses.  The imposed require-
ments begin universally under clause number 4 −−−− Quality System Requirements.
7.1   Let’s demonstrate what we did. Example one:
For AS9000, the first requirement then is sub-clause 4.1.2.4 − “Suppliers having a quality
assurance activity performed by an individual process owner (e.g., operator, buyer, planner)
shall have procedures that define the specific tasks and responsibilities that are authorized and
the corresponding requirements and training necessary to perform those tasks.”
We can go ahead and write pages upon pages to tell in the quality manual how we would be en-
forcing this. That would be a foolish thing to do, for we can answer this in one sentence. Our
manual under sub-clause 4.1.2.4 says:

26   GUIDANCE
4.1.2.4 SAE AS9000  (notice the sub-clause in the Standard is identical to the sub-clause in the
manual) “The requirements of AS9000 have been incorporated throughout the pro-
duct’s processing cycle by the application of Quality Operating Procedures.”
This is exactly what we have done in the process instructions, the Quality Operating Procedures.
We have defined the “specific tasks and responsibilities” to the process owners. Regardless,
whether it’s AS9100, TL9000, QS9000, or ISO 9000, controlling the work processes that are
impacting product quality cannot be done without process instruction procedures. Otherwise,
non-conformance will take over the process.
A very important objective we must remember when we deal with sector specific standards: The
nature of the business we are engaged in. The reason why we want to impose additional sector
specific requirements is because we are already supplying that product to the markets. A potato
grader would not need AS9000, but an aircraft parts manufacturer would. In this manner then,
the process instructions given to the employees should reflect the imposition of any additional
requirement beyond those already given to fulfill the basic requirements of the ISO Standard.
These additional requirements are called complementary requirements to the basic ISO require-
ments.
In paragraph 4.1.2.4 above, we have satisfied in the manual the sector specific requirement by
stating how we are going to fulfill it. The rest belongs in the process instruction procedure. That
is all a quality manual should say.
7.2   Let’s go to a more difficult requirement. Example two:
For AS9000 the requirement says:
4.5.3.1 Document Change Incorporation: “The supplier shall establish a process to ensure the
timely review, distribution, implementation and maintenance of all authorized and
released drawings, standards, specifications, planning, and changes. The supplier shall
maintain a record of change effectivity and, when required, shall coordinate these
effectivities with the customer.”
Is this a strange, never heard or done requirement? Of course not. How would anybody be able
to satisfy the customer’s purchase order requirements, if he didn’t have a process established to
review, distribute, implement and maintain the drawings, standards, specifications, planning,
and changes, throughout the entire production cycle? Nobody could do it without screwing it
up. The fact is, however, that in a lot of cases, we do not have written procedures establishing
how to do it. We are doing it by the traditional way: “I told you how to do it!” Hence,
confusion, mistakes, delays, and arguments pervade our actions. In reality, this requirement
should be a routinely established practice, not only for AS9000, but for every business whose
business is to satisfy contract services. And that is exactly what we have done in this book,
flown down the customer’s requirements everywhere within the organization to ensure
compliance to the “Document Change Incorporation.” Here is what we are saying in our
manual:

                                                                                                        ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   27
4.5.3.1 SAE AS9000  − amendments to customer documents are controlled through the provi-
sions of QOP 001, Section Four (pg 52 or 307). The internal implementation of those
amendments are carried out in accordance with the provisions of QOP 002, Section
Two, paragraph 3.03, as required (pg 73 or 317).
As you can see, we don’t elaborate, for that belongs in the lower-tier procedure. We have
identified the requirement “Document Change Incorporation” and stated where the process
instruction for it can be found. Plain and simple.
But now, let’s go to QOP 002 operating procedure and also to the equivalent training metrics
and find out what we have done with this “effectivity.”
Without repeating here the process instructions given in QOP 001, Section Four and in QOP
002, Section Two, we will give you a short rundown as to what we have done. For the full
details, however, please go to the identified procedures.
We have taken this “Document Change Incorporation” and made it a standard practice for any
business that is engaged in contractual relationship with a customer, irrespective of AS9000 or
any other sector specific standard. Why? Any business engaged in supplying products to
customers is routinely involved in document changes as a result of “amendment to a contract”
or amendments to its own internal documents as a result of the contract amendment. This whole
change process to documents is an everyday bugger in the life of running a business. So why
not make it then part of the process-approach, a core responsibility, in order to prevent the “I
told you so” confusion associated with it. We have made this document change process a
quality management tool and created for it the process instruction enforcement (controls) on
how to carry it out. (This is what I meant, when I said above—plain, commonsense
requirement.)
While the process instructions in QOP 002 (text) give you the formalities on what to do and
how to control this very important objective, it is very difficult to train employees from it. There
are too many steps involved here in implementing document changes, and it is not easy to keep
the sequence going without skipping something. In order to facilitate the training of employees
and to understand better how to walk through the various process steps, I provided the training
metrics to work hand-in-hand with the text-type procedures. During training, you can follow the
illustrative techniques of flowcharting, step by step. Use it also as your checklist to verify
results.
7.3   Let’s talk about an even bigger challenge. Example three:
Every  company is required to comply with EPA and OSHA imposed requirements to a degree,
depending on the type of business it runs − impacted by the number of employees, type of
equipment and facility, product it makes, and its location. Most companies manage these affairs
separately from their quality management system. There is nothing wrong doing it that way,
except the cumulative costs associated with setting up separate procedures and administration to
do it. In a small business this could be a back-breaker. Under a process approach system not
only the product quality requirements but also the regulated EPA and OSHA requirements can
be effectively documented through an additional operating procedure. This could be done,

28   GUIDANCE
similarly, as we have executed the enclosure of AS9000 and followed it by the flow-down re-
quirements in the process instructions and forms. The new standard (ISO 9001/2000) sees the
future of quality management systems as an all-embracing policy document to combine all the
organizational responsibilities under one unified and integrated management system. Makes a
lot of sense.
As we look at the manual’s title page, we read, “ The provisions of SAE AS9000 are incorpo-
rated as a complementary requirement when imposed by contract.” Similar wording can be
lined up for each additional standard you wish to incorporate in your quality manual. Then,
impose the specific requirements of the selected standard in the manual’s sub-clauses under
each applicable main clause as we did it for AS9000. Writing new operating procedures and
creating new forms to satisfy the record keeping requirements would every bit depend on the
standard chosen. As you go through combining different sector specific requirements under one
management system, I strongly urge you to collect first from everybody all the existing papers
that people already have started or implemented. Then, review them in order to understand what
you already have and what else you would need to have in complying with the requirements of
the selected standard. As the new procedures take effect, the old procedures would have to be
locked up as people would rather fall back on the way it used to be than follow new
requirements. Training, training, and more training is the only way to overcome this problem.
The techniques of incorporating EPA (ISO 14001) or OSHA requirements in the quality manual
is not different from what I have done with AS9000. What would be different, however, is the
process instruction on how to carry it out. These would have to be tailored as to the impact of
EPA and OSHA requirements have on the type of business a company is engaged in. Because of
this wide application, the requirements of EPA and OSHA have not been included in the quality
manual and no operating procedures have been provided in this book for them.
While sector specific standards impose their requirements as complementary to the ISO Stan-
dard’s, the EPA and OSHA requirements stand over and above all the requirements as federal,
state, and local laws impose them under regulatory or statutory requirements. The ISO as well
as the Sector Standards expect compliance with them not by detailed imposition but by
reference to them. As such, it is up to the local company to implement and enforce them
according to the requirements of the type of business it runs. So it stands to reason that a
company may impose EPA or OSHA requirements separately from its quality management
system or in combination thereof.
We have gone through three examples above to show you the methods by which you can make
changes in your quality manual to fall in line with requirements needed to operate your
business. Whether it’s a sector specific requirement or a quality objective of your own, the
quality manual in this book is structured to lend itself for provision and text changes without
upsetting the fundamental construction requirements. One major task you will need to
remember is that when you make changes in this manual to suit your needs, flow down the
requirements in all lower-tier procedures. The rest of the controls are found in QOP 002. You
can add completely new requirements and new quality operating procedures and forms so long
as they are fully reconciled to indicate linkage in the succession of documents.

Keep in mind that if you are just setting up a process-approach system, you  do not have to wor-
ry about controlling revision indications. Revision indication control takes effect only after you
have released the quality system procedures for implementation or to the registrar. It is advised,
however, that you make changes one at a time and completely flow the requirements down into
the lower-tier procedures, so that you don’t lose track of what belongs where. With this small
advice, I have told you my own agonies in trying to do too many things at once. I had to re-do
this whole book in order to flow-down correctly all the changes I made to it.
7.4   Summary
As changes are made to the quality manual, an immediate ripple effect takes place that may or
may not impact the lower-tier procedures. That depends on what had been changed. Change to
the clause requirements in the manual imposes change to the process instructions and con-
ceivably to the forms also, whether the instructions are in the manual or issued separately.
Rewriting the text to suit one’s style of speech, without changing requirements and references,
doesn’t impact anything, except your well being. Removing requirements from the quality
manual requires the removal of the applicable process instructions and possibly the impacted
form(s). Whether you add or take away requirements from the manual, the flow-down
requirements cannot be ignored, for the entire process-approach system would have enforce-
ment problems. The operating procedures’ and the forms’ manuals are controlled separately by
Master List and their Revision Sheets. When changes affect the included documents in these
manuals, their Master Lists must also be updated. The quality manual has its own Revision
Sheet to record changes. QOP 002, Section Two, explains how to carry out the changes. For
training purposes, use the identical QOP from the Training Metrics, found in Book Section One.
8.0 Steps to follow when making changes to the quality manual or
         procedures
Note: Consider carefully the revision dates you are posting on documents and the effective
implementation of changes into the work processes. They should coincide with each other.
Conduct the necessary training ahead of time and not after the changes have been imple-
mented. This would avoid confusion within your organization.
Phase One
1. determine what’s needed to be changed. Review the change impact as it affects the manual,
the process instructions, and the forms. ( This is the flow-down impact analysis);
2. then, make copies of the impacted pages from the master documents and enter the changes
on these pages. Flow down the change(s) from the manual to the process instructions and
the forms, as applicable;
3.   have the change(s) reviewed by someone else knowledgeable of the documented system;
4.   review these corrections, if any, and revise the already made changes accordingly;
5. dry-run the intended change(s) through the operating system and adjust the text to suit the
needs of the process. (This is the reality check. Don’t skip it!);
Phase Two
6. now take the masters of the manual, the quality operating procedures, and the forms;
www.Ebook777.com

30   GUIDANCE
7. first, delete the original text in the manual and write in the new text from the draft. Second,
do the same thing in the impacted quality operating procedure(s) and the form(s). Then,
highlight the changes just made. If the change is a new requirement, add a new sub-clause
number in the manual, in sequential order, under the main clause and write in the new text
there. Follow the same method in the quality operating procedure. Then, define the process
instruction in the QOP, as required. But, if there is no QOP referenced in the manual, there
are two things you can do. Either create a new QOP or include the process instruction
requirement in the manual, right under the sub-clause (see clause 4.18 on pg 289). Now,
revise or create the appropriate form(s) to cover any recording requirements resulted from
the change. In case of problems regarding form construction, turn to the Training Metrics,
QOP 002, Section One, pg 69. In case of sequencing problems, please review the QSM and
the QOPs to observe how AS9000 was added.
Phase Three
8. update the Revision Sheet(s) in the quality manual and the impacted quality operating
procedure(s) to indicate the nature of the change(s);
9. then, update the header (page plate) on every page in the manual to indicate the new revision
date and revision number. If page numbers increase, adjust the sequence accordingly;
10. then, update the header (page plate) on every page of the affected quality operating proce-
dure to indicate the new revision date and revision number. If page numbers increase, adjust
the sequence accordingly;
11. after that, update the header of the procedures’ Master List and its revision sheet. Then,
update the header of the forms’ Master List and its revision sheet to indicate the new
revision number and revision date. (These headers have different revision levels than the
rest of the procedures for they control the quality operating procedures and the forms
separately as a group.) Now, update in the body of the ‘Revision History’ sheet for both, by
indicating the nature of change;
12. now, update in the body of the Master List for the Procedures Manual, under the applicable
QOP number, to indicate the new revision number, revision date, and status. Do the same in
the Master List of the forms also;
13. then, go to the applicable form(s) and update the new revision status of the individual
form(s). Each form has the revision indication subscripted on the right bottom of the
page(s);
14. then update on each form, as required, the where-to-find information on the application of
the form(s). This is located on the left bottom of each form.
Note: I know that there is a lot to do here. But don’t worry, I have given examples for these
          items as I debugged the system. Go to the “Revision History” of the QSM on page 271
          and to the “Procedures Manual” on page 294 and see there how I implemented a
          number of changes.
Phase Four
15. conduct the necessary training for the employees to the extent required by the nature of the
change(s) prior to the effective implementation of the change(s) into the work processes.

Phase Five
16. make enough copies of the revised quality manual, the quality operating procedures, and
      the forms to cover the replacement for all accounted documents issued earlier. The distri-
      bution of the quality manual and the quality operating procedures manual should be
      controlled by the application of Form A-010. The distribution of forms should be
      controlled as we issue them from centrally located file(s);
17. collect the obsolete quality manuals, the obsolete operating procedures, and the obsolete
forms from all areas and replace them with the revised documents;
18. maintain record of distribution on Form A-010;
19. discard the obsolete documents, or put them in a secured place to prevent inter-mixing;
20. retain the draft pages (the copies you made from the masters on which you entered the
changes) under separate file as long as they may be needed for background information;
21. replace in the field (including the registrar) all issued and controlled manuals. Request
return of the obsolete manuals at the same time. Discard the obsolete manuals. Uncontrolled
manuals, issued to certain customers for information only, don’t require replacement.
22. keep all masters (hard and/or soft copies) in a secured place.
9.0 Changing the Training Metrics to become the Quality Operat-
         ing Procedure for your quality system (AS9000 is excluded
         from the Flowcharts)
Background
Flowcharting to better understand quality related work processes and aiding process owners to
ease the recognition of compliance requirements has become a universal tool in all types of
businesses. Using flowcharts entirely as process instructions for the complete quality system
procedures are not yet as common as they should be. I can only guess that work habits have a
lot to do with it. Granted, the verbosity of the text-type procedures should never be duplicated in
flowcharting, for making a hundred blocks per page in all directions would make it useless for
process owners. The human eye is not created to scan a labyrinth and understand the details of it
at once. Process owners don’t have the time to do that. They have to mind production. Taking
this into consideration, I opted, as much as possible, to the straight-line, vertical flow method in
flowcharting. I mapped the whole process-approach system in this fashion to make it a practical
tool for easy scanning by the workers. I have removed as many decision diamonds as I possibly
could for the same reason, even at the expense of breaking some flowcharting rules.
9.1   Remove what’s not needed from the flowcharts
Because I designed the flowcharts more for training purposes than for process instruction proce-
dures, a few things may have to be removed from them to make them user-friendly. Not that
they cannot be used as they are. The areas that deal with procedure construction and system
installation and maintenance advice don’t really belong to mapping work processes for product
quality enforcement. You can easily see these as you compare the text-type procedures to the
flowcharts, section by section. The question the user will have to answer is what’s useful and
practical. Do you need ‘Basic Information’? Do you need the information on procedure con-
struction methods? Or the advice given in the rhomboids, the scrolls, and the asteroids? If not,
www.Ebook777.com

32   GUIDANCE
put the cursor on the edge line of the figure you want to remove and click the left button on the
mouse once, then press the delete key, and it’s gone.
The flowcharts presented in this book have been fully integrated with the quality manual, the
text-type procedures and the forms. Each page has a header with the same controlling in-
formation as the text-type procedures. So, by removing the unneeded figures that don’t relate to
the primary processes (shaded) and to the connected instruction blocks, the compliance require-
ments will not be affected. The flowcharts follow the layout pattern of the text-type procedures.
Section by section, title by title, requirement by requirement, they are parallel to the layout
pattern with the text-type procedures. What is missing, however, from the flowchart procedures
is the revision indication. This can be easily recognized when you look in the header on each
page. The boxes for issue date, revision date and level are empty. If you want to use these flow-
charts as a controlled process instruction procedure, you will need to add these to each page, as
required. The revision history page to each QOP is already added, including the same Master
List from the text-type procedures’ manual. The revisions in both types of procedures are the
same, even though the Training Metrics don’t show them.
10.0   Miscellaneous
10.1   Keep a progressive outlook for your quality system
When you do conversion work to this quality manual, consider very carefully what you’re re-
moving. As you go through it and find that a requirement doesn’t need to be in there because
you aren’t doing it, think again. Are you doing part of it? Will you be doing it tomorrow? As
long as a requirement is in line with your business pursuit, but you don’t at the moment have a
need to enforce it, don’t remove it. There are no rules on the books that say you can’t be
forward looking in your planning for the future. If you are in the metal fabrication business, the
same advice applies to AS9000 also. Don’t hesitate to keep the basic requirements in the
manual because you are not doing it today. Prevent yourself from continually changing the
manual to incorporate later the same provisions that you have just removed. Keep ahead of the
continuous improvement aspirations made unmistakably clear in ISO 9001/2000. Any metal
cutting shop can take the quality manual, the quality operating procedures, and the forms from
this book and implement them as they are. Don’t forget to put your name on them. The
companies using this process-approach quality management system and registered to ISO
9002/1994 are Aircraft Parts manufacturers. They need one of the most complete product
quality tools in the manufacturing business. With that in mind, you can rest assured that I have
provided you with quality procedures covering the top of the industry from which you may want
to come lower as your manufacturing operations determine it.
10.2   Make sure that your Management Representative is not just one of the guys
The role of the Management Representative is tantamount to the success or the failure in estab-
lishing, implementing and maintaining a quality management system. I tell you this because I
am one. If this person lacks experience in practicing quality and the operational rigors of your
business, effective and efficient results of all three prerequisites (how to establish, implement,
and maintain) will only be marginal. I am putting myself on the line on this one, for there are a
number of books on the market describing that this job can be filled by any manager in your
business. Not so. Besides having both the quality experience and know-how of your type of

                                                                                                        ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   33
operation, he must also possess overall understanding of the interactions of the quality objective
requirements. He must have guts to deal with recalcitrant individuals, or else he/she will be the
treadmill for exercise. Book knowledge alone will not do it.
10.3   Keep Management Reviews to address significant problems
Management Review is another area where operational details of the quality management sys-
tem have been orchestrated to address problems that should have been solved as part of
everyday responsibility. In this “process-approach” quality management system, corrective
action and follow-up must be taken care of at once to bring about continuous improvement in
the operating system. Effective and efficient production in line with product quality enforce-
ment must be a proactive, consistent effort. Corrective action and follow-up of those problems
that hinder this effort must be resolved promptly as they happen and where they happen within
the departments that are responsible for maintaining the effectiveness of operations collectively.
In the life of a small business, reviewing problems to improve the system cannot wait until top
management sits down to hear them, for it would be highly damaging to the ongoing operations
to delay satisfying the immediate needs of customers, both internal and external. Due to the
sensitive nature of product turnaround requirements in small businesses, I have structured the
quality system’s procedures so as to build key requirements into the operating procedures that
should ensure an unhindered production environment. Along with this reality in small business,
I have also designed the Management Review criteria so it can be both a walk-me-thru process
for improving system deficiencies on the spot and a periodic review process for addressing
major issues. Through the provisions of Quality Operating Procedure 009 (Controlling Non-
conforming Products), all system deficiencies can be cured even without waiting for
Management Reviews. All it takes is to identify the deficiency on Form A-006, submit it to
MRB (Material Review Board) to determine the cause and corrective action and touch base with
top management to determine resources and implementation. Then, implement and follow up
the corrective action requirement and close out the NCMR (Non-conforming Material Report).
In order to have a record of the Management Review, the completion of Form A-034
(Management Review Status Record, pg 493) would be required. This type of agenda doesn’t
include a free lunch, but it surely works to thwart the festering problems lingering around,
awaiting Management Review.
10.4 Book Summary
This book would not be complete without giving you additional information as to how Total
Quality Management (TQM) and the all important Plan-Do-Check-Act cycle (developed by
W. A. Shewhart) were incorporated as the principal drivers of this process-approach quality
management system. For that information, please turn to Appendix Four, book page 503.
Companies registered under ISO 9002/1994 and seeking to convert their quality systems to meet
the requirements of ISO 9001/2000 should turn to Appendix Five, book page 509. I have not
only identified the changes, but also incorporated them into this process-approach quality
management system. References and examples are provided for the reader as to where the
changes belong, whether it’s the quality manual or the operating procedures.

      OVERVIEW TO THE DIAGRAMMATIC PROCEDURES
The training metrics are teaching tools, using flowcharting methods for many different learn-
ing objectives in the implementation and operation of the process-approach quality manage-
ment system presented in this book. They are used in conjunction with the text quality oper-
ating procedures to enable quick comprehension as to how the specific processes flow from
the beginning to the end in the realization of work assignments. To ensure objective guid-
ance: instructions, basic subject information, advisement and individualized notes have been
given where they were needed in line with the primary flow processes. In short, the training
metrics are tutorial products to facilitate the implementation of core departmental assign-
ments, based on process-approach quality management in manufacturing. But they are more.
They can be easily turned into quality operating procedures using the flowcharting methods.
They have been fully integrated with the text-type procedures and forms, and the quality sys-
tem manual. For a quick review as to how the many processes are linked to the controlling
procedures, please see QOP 012, Sections One (pg 250) and Two (pg 254). Note that page
numbers have been added next to the references in order to facilitate easy navigation between

 OVERVIEW TO QOP 001
                         (CONTRACT REVIEW)
Fulfilling customer satisfaction starts at the earliest phase when we establish a relationship
with our customers. Most of us don’t realize this fact until later when we find out that the
customer’s product specification many times is riddled with mistakes. The customer doesn’t
pay for downtime that you incur as a result of these mistakes. A process-approach quality
management system starts right here, ensuring that you work with the customer up front, at
the quoting  phase of the job, so that you  don’t quote a job with all its  mistakes already  in
it. Section One of this QOP is dealing with the quotation process, the RFQ.
Section Two of this QOP is dealing with controlling the Purchase Order Review, giving you
a second opportunity to make sure that you take care of those mistakes that either you or the
customer may have made between the time the RFQ was reviewed and the Purchase Order
issued. Although many times Quality is not part of the job quoting process, this time it takes
a serious review of the issued Purchase Order. It is at this time Quality determines what is
really needed to make sure that product quality verification is planned for during the entire
built-cycle of the product and that everybody becomes aware of it up front so that they can
also plan for it. It is at this time Quality summarizes these requirements and issues them on
Form A-001. This is the time when preventive quality starts rolling into the processing docu-
ments issued by Engineering.
Section Three controls how verbal agreements should be handled in order that we avoid con-
frontation  with  the  customer  later  over  what  was said versus what should have been said.
Again, preventive quality plays a major roll here to avoid problems later.
Section Four takes care of those issues that have everything to do with customer initiated
document changes. It tells you how to control and implement them in order that customer
satisfaction is maintained for both the organization and the buyer.

 2.0     APPLICATION
             This procedure shall apply to accepted RFQs. Turned down RFQs shall not be
             controlled.
 3.0     PROCEDURE
            RFQ Review
      (The quoting process)
Some Basic Information
   What’s
  the
  reason?
Job quotation is a fundamental requirement for the
growth of the business we are engaged in. Therefore, it
is the first and foremost responsibility of an organiza-
tion to pay attention how quotations are done, for the
survival of the business depends on it. Quality should
play an important decision making role in this process,
but it is frequently ignored.
Why is it
ignored?
Traditionally, the cost associated with managing Quality
is budgeted under overhead and it’s taken for granted
that it plays any important role in the job quotation
process. As a result, inspection time is put under a
standard cost factor – product support. What’s not
realized here, however, is the fact that the product being
quoted may require more than just inspection time. It
may require special inspection equipment and skills that
only the person who is experienced can tell. Of course, if
this is unknown to the person doing the quoting, the job
quoted will have a price deficiency in it, which will not
be known until Quality gets involved.

QOP 001  DOCUMENT REQ’D: RFQ, technical data package, forms A-004, A-005
Does this
create a
problem?
In some cases, it certainly does. Request For Quote
(RFQ) does not always have “Purchase Quality
Provisions” attached to it, except in “Hi-Tech”
industries. Even there the practice is not universal.
So, the person doing the quote can easily forget “cost
to quality.” Then, when the PO is awarded, Quality
gets involved, only to discover, “I don’t have the
measuring equipment nor the skills to do it.”
Forgetting  “cost to quality” could wipe out all the
profit you have calculated making.
What’s
the
answer?
Get Quality Involved!

1.0    PURPOSE
          To establish documented procedures for implementing contract amendments and
          the resulting internal document changes.
2.0    APPLICATION
           Contract amendments and the resulting changes shall apply to all the affected
           product(s) and document(s). Changes to internal documents shall be implemented
           by the use of form A-009, as required. (See QOP 002, Sec Two, par 3.03.1, pg 73)
3.0    PROCEDURE
                        
    
   Processing Amendments
       To Purchase Order(s)
   What are
  we talking
  about?
   Some Basic Information
      Why
     involve
     Quality?
Amendment(s) to Purchase Order(s) are changes to
the already made agreements. They may or may not
impact the product and/or quality. They may be
imposed on a supplier without preconditions, or the
conditions are negotiated before or after the amend-
ments are issued. Either way done, the process must
be controlled or we face administrative confusion and
possibly product quality problems.
The Quality Department is responsible for enforcing the
product related documented system. Amendments to
Purchase Orders impact in some cases not only the
product but also the quality of the product. So, if the
Quality Department is kept in the dark, you have on your
hands not only an organizational problem but also a
product quality enforcement problem. The procedures
presented in this book cure both of these problems.

                                                                                                  ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   53

REQUIREMENT: Amendment to Purchase Orders, QSM 4.3.3
SUBJECT:  Processing Amendments
QOP 001  DOCUMENT REQ’D: PO,RFQ, Forms A-001,A-003,A-004,A-005,A-006,A-009,A-011,A-031
   Why do
   amend-
   ments?
Amendment to a Purchase Order is the vehicle by
which we correct mistakes, implement product
improvements, design changes and others. That’s why
we do them. Customers love to handle PO amend-
ments informally over the phone, especially in com -
mercial business. That type of business transaction
opens up a can of worms, for the process engineers
often don’t follow the documented system require-
ments  to put the change(s) through formally.
This process-approach system requires that they do.
 What’s the
 biggest
 problem?
Follow-up by those in charge and who carry
through the documentation process does not
always happen and that’s the biggest problem.
Implementing amendments is not as easy as it
sounds, for they can be more difficult than doing
purchase order processing. They may impact the
product’s documents, hence processing and
product quality.  We’ll address these below.
End of Basic Information
Watch out for Notice of Revisions (NORs) from customers. They
are not yet implemented drawing changes. Several of them may be
outstanding before formal drawing change takes place. Yet, they are
formal notifications to implement changes, frequently to both the
product’s configuration and the related document(s). For handling
this type of change implementation, as well as other processing-
related document changes, we have thoughtfully designed Form A-
009 to manage them. The application of Form A-009 is explained
below.

OVERVIEW TO QOP 002
      (CONTROL OF DOCUMENT AND DATA)
The control of documents and data is prerequisite to be able to manage an effective quali-
ty system. Without it, you have no system. This QOP 002 has three sections in order to
ensure that we manage the documents and data in line with a process-approach quality
management system. We give you instructions on how to design and control the
documents, comprising the quality system’s procedures; give you instructions on how to
carry out revisions, how to identify documents and how to retain them. In fact, this
process-approach system is constructed, implemented, and maintained exactly the way it
tells you how you should do yours. What is really good here is that whatever you need to
know regarding document and data control is in one procedure. Other QOPs often refer
you to come here and do your thing according to the stated requirements laid out for you.
There are so many steps involved here that I could easily write pages to tell you about
them, but I won’t do it here. Rather, I’ll do it where it counts − inside the procedure. This
QOP is one of the longest procedures, along with QOP 006 (inspection control, on pg
127), and QOP 009 (non-conformance control, on pg 199), to make sure that the
documented system is effectively laid out, inter-linked, coordinated, and maintained for
all the quality system’s documents in the process-approach system.

         The Quality System Manual
Write the manual to the requirements of
ISO 9002/1994. Omit sections that don’t
apply to the business. Tell why. Sequence
additional requirements in subparagraphs.
Maintain sequencing order of the numeri -
cal and/or alphabetical line items. Refe -
rence lower-tier documents.
Write the text of the Quality Manual in the
imperative ‘shall’ to express the manda-
tory nature of the requirements. Provide
process instructions only if it’s not avail-
able in other procedures.
Provide a header (page plate) on each
page. Record here the applicable data:
issue date, approval, revision status and
date, page number and other linkage
information.    Make it like this!
         Reminder!
The manual should make
reference to the Standard
as needed and it should
be short (15 to 30  pages),
written in policy state -
ments.

General Requirement
         Errors, mistakes, and misleading instructions in documents are adversely affecting per-
         formance, processing efficiency, and product quality. Therefore, this process-approach
         system provides the tools to remove them when and where they occur. Process owners in
         all departments are required to report them as soon as they discover them to their imme-
         diate supervisors. The supervisors in turn are required to determine what immediate im-
         pact they have on the ongoing process, foremost on product quality, and take the neces-
         sary steps to eliminate them. QOP 012 (the Performance Standard), Section Two, para-
         graph 3.04 (pg 257) gives the required guidance as to how to go about curing these
         document deficiencies.
      By
   whom?
The Management Repre-
sentative for Quality. The
Process Engineer for
Production. They work as
a team.
    How to
    make
    changes?
      Why
      divide
      them?
Processing related document changes are very
frequent. At times customers, at times internal
improvements, mistakes and other anomalies
require document changes. Once the product is
impacted, the affected documents require prompt
change. Quality related documents, on the other
hand, require much less change once implemen-
tation is over. To save time and paperwork, it is
more economical to divide the change processes
along the lines of practicality.
End of Basic Information
       Reminder!
Quality reviews all
changes to determine
the impact on:
 
Product quality
 
Documentation
 
Implementation
 
Follow-up
The process of making changes to docu -
ments is divided into two basic areas:
1. 
processing related document changes
2. 
quality system document changes
The first one is done by the application of
Form A-009 and involves Engineering. It
may or may not impact the quality docu-
ments. The second one is done by draft
changes to the quality system’s documents.
Details to both types are covered below.

                                                                                            ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   73

Standard and NCMR Processing Related Document Changes
Standard changes are routinely done
changes, enacted because of improve -
ment to processing methods, or re-
sponding to customer initiatives, or
correcting all  types of errors that do
not have any impact on product qual-
ity and current processing. NCMR
impacted changes involve corrective
action which may require a “standard”
or “immediate” change process.
 Implementation of Standard Document Changes
 Instruction
Changes to the quality system’s documents as
a result of A-009 are called “indirect changes”

The Management
Representative does:
Review the documents sent by the Quality
Engineer. Determine validity. Evaluate impact
to the system’s documents, to performance,
customer satisfaction, and flow-down. Make a
decision on what to do and record it with
justification on Form A-009 under ‘Notes.’
If decision is hold, find alternate solution that
doesn’t require document change and
implement it.
If decision is to reject it, sign and date A-009
and file all the related documents under  the
‘Document Change Folder.’ Reopen case
when symptom recurs.
         Note
Locate the ‘Document
Change Folders’ in Engi-
neering  when A-009 is
used. Ensure file control
and accessibility.
    Change Control of the Quality System’s Documents
What are
we talking
about?
The processing related documents such as Job Travelers,
Operation Sheets, Software Programs and others are changed
via the use of Form A-009. These changes are very frequent
and may or may not indirectly impact changes to the quality
documents. Changes to the quality system’s documents, on
the other hand, are much less frequent once implementation
is over, but it is more time consuming due to the determina -
tion of flow-down impact, training, and implementation.
Therefore, it is more practical to have two separately
controlled methods for document changes. Implementing
direct changes to the quality system’s documents don’t
require the use of Form A-009.  They are done by the draft-
change method – marking copies of the master documents…
    Implementing Indirect Changes to the Quality System’s Documents

tion of obsolete documents.
The quality system’s forms are
part of the operating procedures
by reference. They have been
separated from them for reasons
of handling and maintenance.
Ensure that any change due to
flow-down requirements is also
implemented in the forms.
Determine flow-down requirement. When
flow-down documents have been impacted,
make a copy from their masters. Mark the
copies by crossing out current text and writing
above the new text. The marked documents
will become the draft-change copies. Hold the
masters as well as the marked copies at hand.

Representative does:
Implementing Direct Changes to the Quality System’s Documents
What are
we talking
about?
Direct changes to the quality system’s documents may
become necessary as a result of system audits, perfor -
mance evaluation, statistical analysis in MRB activities;
policy change due to customer requirements, changes in
goals and objectives for future business, implementation
of sector specific standards, updating changes due to
revisions in the applicable standards; management
reviews, and others. Improvements in line with business
objectives should be the driving forces behind imple-
menting changes. The Management Representative is
responsible for implementing quality system changes.
Consolidate supporting materials to justify the
change. Determine the requirements and iden-
tify which documents are affected. Make a
copy of the masters. Return the masters to ori-
ginal file.
1
Determine which section within the quality
system’s documents the above made copies
belong.  When done, evaluate flow-down re-
quirement. Establish linkage to all the impact-
ed documents. Keep notes on linkage.
2
Now, make a copy of each page of the master
document affected by the flow-down impact.
Then, mark the copies as required by crossing
out the current text and writing above it the
new text. Hold onto both the masters and the
draft-change documents. Now:

End of Implementing Direct Changes
What are
we talking
about?
The quality system’s documents are grouped in three sepa-
rately controlled entities – the Quality Manual, the Quality
Operating Procedures, and the Forms. Each has a built-in
mechanism to control revision indication changes. The
quality manual has its own ‘Revision History’ page and is
located at the beginning pages. The quality operating
procedures have two different ‘Revision History’ pages.
One controls the revision indication of each procedure,
the other  is attached to a ‘Master List’  to control the
Procedures Manual. The forms are controlled through their
own ‘Master List”’and its ‘Revision History’ page.
Revision Indication Change to the Quality System Manual
Make a copy of the master of the ‘Revision
History’ page of the manual. Cross out the
current revision date and number. Write above
it the new date and number. Now, go to the
recording section and write in the required
information under each column. This marked
copy will be the draft-change document.
          Note
Always update revi-
sion indication with
direct or indirect
change to the quality
documents!

Note!
Consider the location of the
‘Document Change Folders’
carefully.
Suggestion: The indirectly im -
pacted change records, which
were implemented via the appli -
cation of Form A-009, should be
put in the Engineering area. Engi -
neering needs to have easy access
to them for background informa-
tion. On the other hand, the di-
rectly carried out change records,
which were done on the draft
copies, should be located in the
Quality Department, for they are
basically Quality related.

Some Basic Information on the
          Nature of Forms
  What
   are
  they?
Forms are record keeping procedures.
They contain the recorded evidence of
compliance imposed by the various
process instructions −  the QOPs.
They are part of the Quality Operating
Procedures but split off from them for
reasons of handling and maintenance
Can they be
apart from
process in -
structions?
Which forms
aren’t usual-
ly separated?
Note!
Forms should be designed
when possible for multipur-
pose use, where only the part
numbers of products change,
but the recording requirements
stay the same. (see Form A-
018 (pg 473) used for all types
of inspection data collection)
End of Basic Information
At times forms are part of the pro-
cess instructions by reference only
(as in this book). At other times,
they are combined (dedicated )
with the Job Traveler and/ or
Operation Sheet. For practical
handling and retention, they should
be kept separate. That’s the smart
way of doing it.
Dedicated Job Travelers with

General
The quality system’s effectiveness is demonstrated through the control of its records
which serve as evidence to prove product conformance or non-conformance to the
specified requirements within the established and implemented system. (see Summary of
Forms and Master List, pg 453)
Since record keeping is evidenced through the application of the various forms, the
various departments within the organization shall be responsible for managing them in
accordance with procedural requirements as described in the applicable QOPs.
         To prove the effective operation of the quality system, subject records shall be periodical-
         ly audited in accordance with documented procedures (see QOP 010, pg 224). Obsolete
         documents shall be retrieved from all affected areas. Their retention shall be determined
         according to need and those that are retained shall be stamped “Obsolete.”
         The quality system’s records demonstrate the documentation of work results, recorded by
         those process owners who bear the responsibility for their accuracy and completeness
         each step of the way in the product’s realization processes. The record retention responsi-
         bility, therefore, shall be assigned to those process owners who carry out the last step in
         the documentation, review, approval, or final handling of the designated record(s). Ac-

 OVERVIEW TO QOP 003
         (CONTROL OF PURCHASES)
How often we find that the Purchasing Department was out of the quality loop because of
its independent stature. Then the purchased item came in and was rejected. The inspec-
tion report indicated that the product was made by somebody who had absolutely no
knowledge as to what kind of product quality the customer required. Now, you have to
rework it at your expense, for you are out of time to meet the scheduled delivery require-
ment. Within a process-approach quality management system, the Purchasing Depart-
ment becomes part of the team; after all we work for the same company and the same
customer. Don’t we? So let’s bring this sacred cow into the fold in order that we all know
our customers’ requirements for product quality. QOP 003 is the procedure that requires
the Purchasing Agent and the Subcontractor to understand the product quality require-
ments expected to be realized in purchased products. This procedure is packed with
preventive quality requirements in order that we don’t buy junk that would end up
causing problems and wipe out any profit we calculated to make on the project.

1.0 
PURPOSE
To define the quality requirements for reviewing and approving the issuance of
product related internal Purchase Orders. (Job quoting may be a preliminary
requirement.)
2.0 
APPLICATION
The provisions herein apply to the issuance of internal Purchase Orders for product
related materials, processes (special) and other subcontracted services, which
products will be delivered in compliance with the quality requirements of
customers’ purchase orders.
3.0 
PROCEDURE
        Approval and Issue of
    Purchase Orders (Internal)
   Some Basic Information
What type
of Purchase
Orders ?
Product related Purchase
Orders internally issued to
Subcontractors (Suppliers)
Note!
Purchase Orders issued for
general purchases, unless they
are product or process related,
should not be under Quality
review and approval. Don’t
create a bureaucratic system
for the sake of paperwork!
What does
Quality do
with PO’s?
Quality ensures that both the
customer’s and the internal
quality requirements have been
effectively flown down to the
subcontractors in all the product
related purchase orders issued.

The Purchasing Agent does:
The Quality System’s proce-
dures provide work instruction
to control  this process. To
ensure compliance, the system
is regularly audited. Read the
flowcharts below under para-
graphs 3.01 and 3.02.
      Who
  can issue
     PO’s?
Anybody who can comply with
procedural requirements:
1. 
knows what to order
2. 
follows the procedures

  How can
   you be
    sure?
A PO requisition can
streamline product or
non-product related
purchases.
Quality must ensure that product
related PO’s have adequate content
information to enforce product,
material, and process quality
requirements.
Quality must ensure that the
subcontractor is capable and has
adequate controls and process
approval (special) to meet the
customer’s quality requirements.
     End of Basic Information
       Issuance of Internal Purchase Orders

    Evaluation of Subcontractors
Who are
  they?
They are the Vendors who
provide subcontracted services
to the Organization in line with
product quality requirements.
Can cus-
tomers be
suppliers as
well?
Many times, they are. They
may supply raw materials,
tooling, engineering and/or
special services as part of the
contract provisions.
Do QA pro-
visions ap-
ply to cus-
tomers?
Under ISO, a customer is
also responsible to supply
acceptable products and
services as any other
supplier.

3.03
          General
             Subcontractors are expected to comply with the provisions of Purchase Orders issued to them.
             These Purchase Orders contain stipulated provisions relating to general and specific product re-
             lated requirements. The Quality Provisions are just one component of the total requirements. In a
             rating process, the violations of the imposed PO provisions should be compared against a predeter-
             mined criteria (penalty points) made up according to the business interest of the Company. The
             predetermined criteria should be the standard rule against which subcontractors are rated and after
             so many violations disqualified. (In small businesses, subcontractors are relatively few and the
             rating system is based more on arbitrary decision than on an established rating system. According-
             ly, the arbitrary decision making is heavily based on two factors: delivery and product quality capa-
             bility. In tune with this approach, the following process instructions should be subject to individual
             consideration.)

 OVERVIEW TO QOP 004
(CONTROL OF CUSTOMER SUPPLIED PRODUCT)
Customer supplied products could be just about anything that an organization may need
in supporting the contracted product’s realization processes. The presumption that what-
ever the customer may provide in supporting product realization is already a qualified
product, because the customer checked it before releasing it, is as far from the truth as
catching a 10 pound bass on dry land. Of course, not every customer falls under this
scenario. The customer’s previously demonstrated capability should be the yardstick by
which we should take any chances in accepting the supplied product(s). Without control-
ling customer supplied products, we are inviting the same type of problems as accepting
unverified products from subcontractors. Just when we are going through the first pro-
duction piece verification, we discover the problems. This is another area where any
profit we wanted to make on the job has evaporated. Sometimes I wonder where
customer satisfaction begins, now that I am buying product support from the customer.
Anyway, QOP 004 is giving you the tools in order to control customer supplied products,
just as you would buy products from anybody else. It’s a fair deal.

                                                                                         ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   111

1.0 
  PURPOSE
  To control customer supplied products in accordance with the quality provisions
  of the Purchase Order and this procedure.
2.0 
  APPLICATION
  Customer supplied product determines the processing schedule to furnish goods
  within delivery requirements of the contract. As such, the quality of the supplied
  product bears a substantial impact to comply with that requirement. The applica-
  tion of this procedure shall ensure the expedient identification, verification, docu-
  mentation and release of the customer supplied product.
3.0 
  PROCEDURE
 What’s a
 customer
 supplied
 product?
By the provisions of a contract, a
customer may agree to furnish
materials, services, and/or
technical support in order to assist
the supplier to deliver a fully or
partially completed product.
 Why control
         it?
Anything a customer provides
can be as deficient in quality as
that of your own product if you
don’t control the manufacturing
processes. A Quality Manage-
ment System based on process-
approach controls must protect
both the customer and the orga-
nization from the transfer of
deficient products from one
place to the other. Hence,
documented procedures must be
in place to ensure this from
happening.
Note!
Customers don’t usually write
contrary quality provisions
into their contracts against pro-
ducts they supply to subcon-
tractors. That’s the other guy’s
problem.

 OVERVIEW TO QOP 005
(PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION AND TRACEABILITY)
Product identification is much like your birth certificate. It tells you something but not
everything about yourself. Product-related documents do the same thing. This is the way
we identify some very basic earmarks about the product we are putting through the vari-
ous processes. The part, the serial, the lot or batch numbers, all serve to identify the pro-
duct. Sometime, we don’t mark the product, so we identify it on the document accom-
panying it. Then, we attach tags or labels to the product. We also identify the product on
the Job Traveler and on the Operation Sheet. The customer does it on the Purchase Order
and on the product specification. Now, we can not only match the product to its
documents, but we can also trace it on the production floor, in the stockroom or even in
the field. This is what product identification is all about. QOP 005 tells you how to
control the process of product identification and traceability.

3. 
subcontracting
4. 
lot/batch control
5. 
shelf-life control
6. 
identifying rejects
7. 
product recall
 When to
   do it?
It depends on the type of
traceability required for:
1. 
raw material control
2. 
in-process control
3. 
finished product
control
4. 
delivery control
5. 
customer’s control
6.

attached to the product
If product is rejected, Form A-012
is attached to it. Form A-006 is
processed
Before product is released for ship-
ment, its identification and marking
is matched to the paperwork. The
paperwork then is attached to the
product.
All product related paperwork must
indicate the product’s identifying
criteria. – Cust. P/N, Rev., S/N, etc.
At Receiving, Form A-015 must be
filled out to contain  all the product
related information
At Contracts, Engineering,
Planning,  Quality, etc. all the
documents must indicate the pro -
duct’s identification criteria
The serial number of Form A-006
(NCMR) must be recorded on all
the respective inspection and pro-
duction documents for traceability
When a product is serialized (in a
lot/batch) the numbers must be
recorded in the related production
and inspection paperwork.
Note!
All the various blank forms of the
Quality System have been so
designed as to indicate a product
and/or process identification and
documentation requirements. An
effective Quality Management
System  based on process ap -
proach must control  the interre-
lation of documents to the pro-
cesses. Identification and product
traceability not only extend to
material things but must also lead
to the recognition of assignments
and responsibilities through
documentation in order  to show
evidence of compliance.

            General
1. The primary controlling method for document and product identification shall
be the customer’s Purchase Order imposed product part number and its revi-
sion level. Additional controls, such as individual serial numbering, batch or
lot control, shall be imposed both in the related documents and on the product
itself, as required.
2. Parts serialization, batch or lot control, when imposed, shall begin from the
receipt of product(s), or as otherwise determined by the processing require-
ment. This shall form the basis also for identification later when splitting
quantities for multiple processing is required.
3. Follow-on marking and documentation when, through processing, the original
      marking has been removed, shall be identically re-marked throughout process-
      ing.
4. Process owners’ accountability for product identification and record keeping
for the parts they have done shall be enforced and tracked by supervision.
5. Identification and documentation of the products and/or services, ordered on
internally issued Purchase Orders, shall conform to the customer’s Purchase
Order requirements.
6. Departments issuing product-related documents shall enforce the identifica-
tion and documentation requirements according to the customer’s Purchase
Order.

OVERVIEW TO QOP 006
(INSPECTION AND TEST CONTROL)
This QOP is the longest of the quality operating procedures and it is by design that way.
Instead of having a dozen or more procedures written separately on the different inspec-
tion assignments needed to support product quality enforcement, I have combined them
all under one control. During my forty years in the field of Quality, I found that the
various inspection functions were documented in such a fragmented, confusing manner
that it took longer to find the procedure covering a specific type of inspection than to do
the work itself. This was one reason why I combined them all under one directory. The
second reason was to cut down on the volume of documents burdening the quality sys-
tem, and the third was to maintain linkage to one QOP instead of a dozen. Now, anything
you want to find regarding inspections will take you a second to find under its own index.
This consolidated QOP is the first most important controlling document of the quality
management system, for it deals with product verification, acceptance, documentation
and release of products to the customer. It has seven separate sections, each dedicated to
control one or more inspection function, and it covers the entire processing cycle of a
contracted product, including customer and subcontractor source inspection. Please look
up the index, next page, to discover how extensively we cover the field of inspections.
Statistical process controls (SPC) may or may not be a determining factor, for the quality
objective procedures, written for each assignment, have incorporated basic preventive
instructions to monitor process variations and correct them when unacceptable levels
arise. The use of control charts, commonly known as run charts, is strictly up to the
customers, although the management representative could occasionally impose it on his
own when it becomes necessary in the process of isolating the causes of problems.

                                  SECTION ONE
1.0 
PURPOSE
To enforce quality provisions in controlling the verification, documentation, and
approval of the first production unit.
2.0 
APPLICATION
The provisions of this procedure shall apply to:
1. First production piece verification and approval;
2. First piece rework/repair verification and approval;
3. First piece verification and approval of subcontracted work, excluding special
process.
3.0 
PROCEDURE
What does
it mean?
Who are the
process
owners?
Inspection and test control means
that product quality enforcement
is carried out to the requirements
of written procedures. Through
these procedures, the process
owners are instructed as to what to
do in order to prove that what they
did was in or out of line with work
instructions.
Process owners are all the mem-
bers of an organization, entrusted
to take ownership of their work
assignments in order to fulfill
product quality and other require-
ments in line with the organiza-
tion’s objectives.
Note on Work Instruction
How much detail should be
defined in work instructions
is highly dependent on the
complexity of the product, on
the education, skill, and expe-
rience level of the process
owners. The Job Traveler and
Operation Sheet should be the
main work instruction proce-
dure for production related
processes, sequentially outlining
the requirements of the product
specification – the drawing. The
product specification is the
bible. For Special Processes, the
process specification serves as
the work instruction.

we talking?
1. 
first piece inspection
2. 
first article control
3. 
in-process inspection
4.

 What is
 first pc.
 insp.?
  Why so
 many in-
spections?
Verification and approval
of a phase operation of a
setup. (On multiple set-
ups, each setup has a first
piece process approval,
first by the operator, then
by inspection.)
Each type of inspection
has a defined objective to
control the product at the
earliest phase of  process
realization to prevent non-
conformance.
Don’t risk production!
Require first piece
verification and
approval!
Anything
left out?
End of Basic Information
The application of control
charts may be required as
part of process control. If it
is required, it should be
stated in the Job Traveler.

The Supervisor does:
 First Production Piece Verification and Approval
Verify revision level of documents to Job Trav-
eler requirement
Measure the work-piece and record the work re-
sults onto form A-033, as required
Sign the Job Traveler. Then, submit the product
with its documents to inspection for verification
and approval, or
Review the requirement to ensure what has been
specified has been measured and accurately re-
corded. Keep the product and documents together
Reject the product if a specified requirement is
out of tolerance and can’t be readjusted to meet
the requirement. Notify your supervisor.
Ensure measuring equipment is suitable for the
purpose and is calibrated. Re-verify as needed

Process NCMR through Quality for the rejected
product, as required
2
Implement corrective action, as required
3
Determine production continuation while the first
piece inspection approval is pending. Review job
completion according to Job Traveler. Then sign
Form A-033 under the ‘Audit’ line, as required
4
         Instruction
Base production continuation on
risk involved, the complexity of
the product and the skill level of
the operator. For violations that
don’t impact product quality
take on spot corrective action.
         Instruction
Producing a fully acceptable
first piece may require more
than one setup piece. Deter-
mine if this is allowed, for
you may be working on a
very expensive and complex
part where a wrong cut may
scrap the part.  Determine
also whether control chart is
required to monitor process
variations after first piece
approval.
Remember that process mo-
nitoring is a very important
part of your responsibility to
ensure that all production
pieces meet the customer’s
requirement. You are the
only one who can build qua-
lity into the product. We are
all proud of you for being
able to do this.

 2.   inspection and documentation
 3.   customer source inspection
 4.   packaging and delivery
 5.   document retention
3.0 
 PROCEDURE
             General Requirements
1. First Article quality requirements shall be detailed in the Purchase Order
Review Sheet, Form A-001;
2. The Job Traveler (A-008) shall outline the processing steps in sequential order,
      including subcontracting, in order to control an orderly process realization;
3. The Quality Engineer shall enforce process controls in line with the require-
ments stated in the Job Traveler and the Purchase Order Review Sheet, A-001;
4. All the provisions of the quality system procedures shall be binding on all de-
partments carrying out the First Article objectives, as required.
Why first
article?
The customer may require
that before full production is
authorized, the supplier’s
capability and the product’s
inspection and test controls
be approved.

    yes
What will
it take
to do this?
It depends on the customer’s
requirement, but more than
likely the various process con-
trols of the First Article unit
could encompass most of the
established procedures of the
Quality System.
Ensure that quality
requirements are listed
on Form A-001!
     End of Basic Information
Any difference
between First
Article and Fi-
nal Inspection?
While both the First Article
and Final Inspection require
full process control account-
ability, First Article, in
addition, requires complete
review and approval of the
processing and quality
procedures by the customer
prior to authorizing pro-
duction.
And the
cost to
quality?
The Quality System’s pro-
cedures in this book provide
suitable and adequate con -
trols for this type of work.
Any extra cost incurred
should be recovered later
during production autho-
rization.
But Watch!!!
It could also be a debugging
operation for the customer,
disguised under “product
development” and no
assurance of production.

            Note 1.   The First Article Inspection Report shouldn’t be put together until all the
                            required processing steps have been completed and the product verified,
                            approved, and released from final inspection.
Note 2.   The First Article Inspection Report (FAIR) consists of all those docu-
                            ments that were issued to control the various processing operations in-
                            cluding subcontracting, special processes and any MRB activity, prov-
                            ing work results documentation in compliance with requirements.
The Quality Engineer does:
  Compiling the First Article Inspection Report
Bring together the Production Folder, the First
Article Inspection Product Folder, and the
Supplier Product Folder.
1
     Instruction
The First Article related
processing and quality
records should be located
in these three folders.
Find the Job Traveler and form A-001. Review
both documents and ensure that all the require-
ments have been complied with. For any omis-
sion of the requirements, process an NCMR, as
required, and execute it in accordance with QOP
009, Section One and Two. Begin gathering the
documents needed to make up the First Article
Inspection Report (FAIR)
2
Start with the Job Traveler. The first step should
be ‘Material Release.’ Find the material’s certi-
fication. This document should be your fourth
record in the ‘FAIR’ stack. (The first one is the
customer’s PO. The second one is the Job Trav-
eler. The third one is form A-001)
Note
Any document missing
is probably left behind
somewhere in the pro-
cessing area. Process
owners are not the best
organizers of job relat-
ed papers.
3
       Instruction
When the customer supplies
the material, it usually does
not provide the certifica-
tion with it. The customer’s
PO should specify what has
been supplied.
When the First Article con-
sists of more than one part,
there should be a parts list
notation in the PO.
Go, step by step, following the Job Traveler, pull
together from the folders all those records sub -
stantiating work results documentation, including
subcontracting and special processes. Place the
documents in sequential order. Place any NCMR
related documents where the non-conformance
occurred. The last document should be the Final
Inspection Report  (A-018). (The C of C comes
separately with the shipping documents)
4
Stay neat in all docu-
ment presentation. It’s
highly reflective of
product quality!
      Instruction
Look for the signatures
after each operation num-
ber sequenced in the Job
Traveler. No signature
means the process owner
forgot to sign off the spe-
cific operation or it wasn’t
done.
You may omit this step if
forms A-008 and A-001
were already reviewed un-
der paragraph 6.0 above.

The Quality Engineer does:
Remove the staples from the documents, as re-
quired. Make as many copies of the collection as
needed. Then, sort the copies in sequential order
to make up the individual stacks
5
Take the originals and staple them back together
as they were before and put them back into the
folders from which you removed them
6
Make up the index page indicating the sequential
order of the documents – title and subject. Num-
bering the pages is optional. Title the index page
‘FAIR’ and show the customer’s name, PO and
part number on it
7
Put one index page on top of each stack and bind
each stack in a folder suitable for the occasion
8
Locate the First Article unit. Ensure that form A-
013 is on it (Acceptance Material Ticket).
9
       Instruction
Form A-013 signifies product
acceptance by Final Inspec-
tion. If the First Article unit
had customer authorized
rework/repair done, then form
A-012 should also be on it.
The customer must
know the reject history
of the product. Form
A-012 will trigger that
recognition. The NCMR
number is identified on form
A-012, ensuring traceability to
the reject history.
Put a copy of the FAIR onto the First Article unit
and move it to a clean area. Hold the original
folders as well as the additional FAIR copies
close by the product until the customer’s source
inspection is over. (The Source Representative
will need access to the product’s specifications
(drawings, etc. from the original folders).

   General
               The First Article documents are not standard production documents due to the
               nature of project specific handling and controls imposed by the customer’s
               Purchase Order. Although the controlling documents had been derived from the
               established quality system’s procedures, the purpose for which they were ap-
               plied made them isolated under First Article sectioning. Therefore, retention of
               these documents should not be intermixed with the standard production and
               quality records.
The Quality Engineer does:
             Document Retention

age location of the First Article documents
1
Place the Production Folder, the First Article In-
spection Product Folder, the Supplier Product
Folder and the extra copies of the FAIR in a con-

2
Place a label on the container, indicating ‘FAIR,’

             Process Control
What’s
process
control?
How do we
measure
performance?
Where are
the specified
requirements?
All activities that have been
imposed in the progressive
realization of a product need to
be verified through a monitoring
process, known as surveillance,
in order to determine compliance
to the imposed requirement.
We measure performance through
the recorded evidence of the work
results. We evaluate this recorded
evidence against the requirement
stated in the applicable procedure
(work instruction) in order to
prove whether we did or did not
comply with the stated require-
ment.
For the Quality Management
System, the specified require-
ments are stated in the Quality
Manual. For controlling product
quality, the specified requirements
are stated in the Quality Operating
Procedures. Together, these two
tier documents regulate what we
must do, step by step, to comply
with those specified requirements
needed to enforce product quality.
            Note!
Linkage in-between the
documents is maintained by
references in order to
indicate where to find the
specified requirements.
           Note!
We are only reviewing process-
ing related assignments re-
garding performance require-
ments. Process reviews are not
the “annual” quality system
audits, which are scheduled
according to the Audit Schedule
established on Form A-021.
Process surveillance has every-
thing to do with preventive
quality and the ongoing im-
provement practices to the
operating system. This effort
represents a major component
of the Process Approach Quality
Management System to enforce
the established requirements.
Some Basic Information
Who needs
all this de-
tail?
The responsibility for product
quality is no longer in the hands of
one department – Quality. Other
departments handling product related
assignments must also be knowl-
edgeable of the product quality
requirements so that they don’t pass
on their mistakes from process to
process. Being a process owner of a
product related assignment, one must
know how to comply with the rules
of the quality system. Non-quality
personnel need all this information.
You may have a
better idea. Write
it down! See book

Suggestion Path’

3.01
The Inspection Supervisor or the
Quality Engineer does:
  How does
  process
  control
  work?
Everybody in a Quality Management System has his/her work assignment
and commensurate responsibility identified. All are process owners of
assignments even if it is temporary. As we follow the process instructions
and do our assignments accordingly, we have performed the required task.
Under ordinary circumstances, we have finished our designated work
assignments. The question comes up, how do we prove what we did was
right? We can’t, unless we check it and record the work results and
thereby prove it. By these three steps – following the process instruction,
doing the work, recording the work results – we have done what was
asked of us to do – followed the directions. So, process control becomes a
built-in achievement as a result of following directions. If nobody would
make a mistake, we would have a product that would meet customer
satisfaction every time. But we know that’s not the case. So, we have
added a preventive step to the process to ensure that we find the mistakes
not at the end of the line but more so at the beginning. We review the
recorded work results during the performance phase of our assignments in
order to determine that there is no mistake in them.
  End of Basic Information
Review the process owner’s performance to ensure
that the product’s identity (part number and descrip-
tion) and the related identifiers (customer, S/N, lot/
batch number) had been accurately recorded on the
applicable forms in the controlled areas, as required:
1
At Receiving (on forms A-015 and A-027) as stated
in QOP 006, Section Five, paragraph 3.02.1 (pg 169)

  SECTION FOUR
1.0 
PURPOSE
Maintain control over final inspection and testing.
2.0 
APPLICATION
This procedure shall apply to the verification, documentation, acceptance, and
release of a completed product in compliance with the customer’s Purchase Order
requirements.
3.0 
PROCEDURE
General Requirement
1. Final inspection and testing entail the review of past performance regarding the
product’s processing, verification, acceptance, and documentation. Additional
verification and documentation shall be done, as necessary, in order to demon-
strate complete compliance to the customer’s Purchase Order requirements,
prior to delivery (or storage);
2. In the absence of PO quality provisions, the internally imposed and implement-
ed quality requirements shall be reviewed and approved prior to releasing a
completed product for delivery to the customer (or storage);
3. The above provisions equally apply to customer returned products.
               Final Inspection and Testing
What are
we looking
at?
To start with, we are reviewing the
Job Traveler, Operation Sheet and
Form A-033 (or A-018) against the
quality requirements stipulated in
Form A-001 and determining
whether all the required processing
operations have been completed,
verified and signed off by the
process owners. We are doing final
product verification and documen -
tation to ensure that the end pro-
duct meets the customer’s PO
quality requirements.
      Some Basic Information
                   Note
Think for a moment and realize how we
have imposed the product quality require-
ments for the entire processing cycle. We
have to go back to the very beginning – to
the time when we determined the Purchase
Order Quality Requirements and imposed
them in Form A-001. Now, we must prove
during Final Inspection that we have lived
up to those requirements. (When the Job
Traveler was issued, the Process Engineer
transcribed from Form A-001 to the Job
Traveler the imposed quality requirements.)

3.01
The Quality Inspector does:
What can
we learn
from it?
What else
can be
wrong ?
Through final inspection, we are
isolating all those problems that
should have been caught and
corrected during in-processes.
Yes, through final inspection, we
can also find out what ails the
Quality System and impose
corrective action to cure them.
Most commonly, any rejected
product has not yet been taken
care of in time for product
delivery. Also, workmanship
related requirements were not
yet completed
Can we
fix what’s
wrong?
Yes, we must intensify per-
formance monitoring in areas
where violations occurred and
follow up on every corrective
action we have imposed. This
way, we enforce compliance to
the requirements.
End of Basic Information
   Note
Problems discovered during Final
Inspection raises very serious
questions.  How well did the line
supervisor do the process owners’
job performance review, required
under Section Three of this QOP
006?
               Note
Product expediting rules equally
apply to the Quality Department
but for some unknown reason the
rejected product sends out “don’t
touch me” shock waves. Quality
is responsible to expedite the re-
solution of all rejected products.
Job performance moni-
toring keeps every pro -
cess owner alert to follow
procedures, especially if
his/ her pay raise depends
on it.
             Document Review
Collect the product’s processing and inspection
folders, as applicable
1
         Instruction
These folders are: Inspection
Product Folder, Supplier Pro-
duct Folder, Production Folder,

3.02
The Quality Inspector does:
             Note!
Record keeping is not
always done by the rule
of imposition. As long as
the recorded data does
not cause misinterpreta-
tion of quality require-
ments, it can stand with-
out correction. It should
not be overlooked, how-
ever, without reminding
the process owners.
Take the Job Traveler (A-008) from the Produc-
tion Folder and Form A-001 from the Inspection
Product Folder
2
         Instruction
Under certain processing con-
ditions, the Job Traveler may
be moving from process to
process with the product. You
may have to look for it where
the product is.
Review the Job Traveler against the inspection re-
quirements imposed in Form A-001 and establish
compliance to the imposed requirements:
3
Verify the process owner’s signature under each
specified operation
3a
Verify the Quality Inspector’s signature where
first piece inspection was required
3b
        Note
Sometimes the Job
Travelers have un-
authorized notes
and changes on
them. Unless they
are approved by
the Process and
Quality Engineers,
they are not valid
and shouldn’t be
enforced.
Verify any subcontracted work acceptance either
on form A-018 or on the subcontractor’s form
3c
Verify the acceptance of rework/repair, docu-
mented on form A-023, resulting from MRB and
the customer’s disposition (on waiver A-024)
3d
Verify the acceptance of customer returned pro-
duct(s) as per “3d” above
3e
Verify further that the documented records fully
cover verification and acceptance of all the quan-
tities required by the Job Traveler
4
Contact the responsible supervisor if the docu-
mentation is incomplete or the records are miss-
ing in order to implement on-spot corrective ac-
tion as stated under paragraph 3.04 of Section
Three of this QOP 006. (Last sentence)

usually a problem!)
Verify the part description and revision level in
the controlling documents (drawing, job traveler
and operation sheet, software program) that they
accurately reflect the customer’s Purchase Order
part description and revision level requirement
2
Determine whether 100% or sampling inspection
is required. Select the required samples randomly
3
          Instruction
For sampling inspection refer
to ANSI Z1.4 or use the old
reliable Mil-Std-105, or the
customer imposed requirement
Obtain a blank form of A-018 and fill in the pro-
duct related information from the Job Traveler in
the upper portion of the form. Fill in under ‘Type
of Inspection’: Final Inspection and Testing
4
Inspect the product as required and record the
verification results on form A-018. Then:
5
Verify and record the results of any special pro-
cess work done, as applicable
5a
          Note
When special pro-
cesses are done be -
fore product veri-
fication, serious
rework/repair may
result from the
assumption that the
product was right.
DON’T DO IT!
Verify and record the results of any rework/repair
work done, as applicable
5b
Verify and record the results of any workmanship
done (refer to the drawing notes)
5c
Customer returns
due to workman-
ship problems is
the number one
headache for

Do visual (optical) inspection and record the
results on form A-018
5d
Handle the product if MRB disposition is requir-
ed in accordance with QOP 009, Section One,
Two, and Three. Otherwise, interact with depart-
mental supervision
6
         Instruction
Any product with customer
authorized rework/repair (on
waiver A-024) requires
tagging with form A-012
prior to shipment in addition
to tag A-013
Stamp, or sign and date all the required docu-
ments after product acceptance
7
It’s not unusual to
have more than one
NCMR on a pro-
duct. Most NCMRs
are generated as a
result of Final
Inspection
Follow up and ensure NCMR closure, as required

Automate this sort of doc-
ument handling as much
as practical.
Review the Packing Slip. Ensure that the docu-
ments that will be sent to the customer with the
shipment have been accurately listed. Require
correction, as necessary. Then, sign the Packing
Slip as required and release it (E-mail) to the
Shipping Department. In the meantime:
2
Issue the Certificate of Conformance, when re-
quired, on form A-029. Make copy of it!
3
          Instruction
It’s not a requirement of this
quality system to keep a “Register
Log” for your certs. If you want to
avoid confusion when you have to
look for a specific cert, it is highly
recommended that you do keep a
register according to the S/N, cus-
tomer, and date as issued.

            Instruction
Customer supplied products are
subject to the same quality re -
quirements as any other supplied
products unless otherwise stated.
Provisions of QOP 004 and QOP
009 equally apply. Dimensional
verification and documentation
should be based on previously
demonstrated product quality.
Missing, damaged or wrong pro-
duct must be identified on Form
A-015 and reported to Contracts
and the Customer, and resolved
via NCMR (A-006) provisions as
stated in QOP 009.
           Note!
It is a misconception that
customer’s products may
forego receiving inspec-
tion. Controls should be
determined on a case by
case evaluation based on
previously demonstrated
product quality.
End of Basic Information
Some companies use Purchase Order
Requisitions to streamline require-
ments as to what to control.
Go to QOP 004 and carry out the receipt of the customer
supplied product(s) as stated under paragraph 3.01.

pitfalls?
From My Scrapbook
I suppose a lesson is
not learned until you
yourself experience it!
Contact the subcontractor’s Quality Department and
inquire about product readiness
1
Find out whether final inspection had been complet-
ed, the work results documented, and the product
accepted. Interact accordingly
1a
Agree upon time and date for source inspection
1b
Review the Supplier Product Folder and determine
the subcontractor’s past performance regarding pro-
duct quality, including any SCAR activity. Take note
of any outstanding issues and determine if those
issues impact the product you are about to source
inspect. Interact accordingly
2
Gather the necessary documents (drawing(s) forms
A-018 and A-036, etc.) needed to take with you in
order to carry out source inspection. Flag the folders
from which you have removed the needed documents
for they will have to be returned there

180   TRAINING METRICS 007
        OVERVIEW TO QOP 007
(CONTROL OF INSPECTION, MEASURING AND TEST EQUIPMENT)
When we talk about product verification, what we really mean is to check that product
with a measuring device to determine if it meets a determined tolerance limit. How often
do we do this without questioning whether that measuring device we just used is good
enough to do the job? So you see, that measuring device also has a tolerance limit. And
then, when we confirm that measuring device to determine its accuracy, the validating
equipment also has a tolerance limit. There must be someone in every shop, where
measuring equipment is used, to take care of the gages, or very soon we be out of
business, because we can’t accurately measure what we made. All this, of course, is a
reminder that we must always know, ahead of time, whether our measuring and test
equipment was calibrated and that they are suitable for the type of measurement we want
to make. QOP 007 is the procedure that tells us how to go about controlling measuring
and test equipment. This procedure controls not only company owned equipment, but
also personal and customer owned or loaned measuring and test equipment.

                                                                                       ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES    181

        Some Basic Information
What’s
calibration?
By the dictionary: (Webster’s)
“to standardize (as a measuring
instrument) by determining the
deviation from a standard so as to
ascertain the proper correction
factors”
By this book:
It means all the above, plus the
identification, confirmation, and
documentation of the controlled
measuring and test equipment.
Where do
we start the
controls?
In order to start controlling the measur-
ing and test equipment, we must know
first what we have on hand – the type(s)
and quantities. We do this (inventory) on
a “Gage Calibration List” which we will
create now. But to make this form really
useful, we’ll add other important infor-
mation to it. We’ll give this form a
casual name – Gage List Index. The
contents of this form you will use as long
as you have a calibration system. Later
on, when we define the gage Identi-
fication requirement, this is the form we
mean to be used.

Employees’ gages have to be
controlled only as long as they
stay with the company. So their
gages can’t be controlled on a
permanent bases because that
would create unneeded and con-
fusing paperwork with the Com-
pany’s gages. As a result, we
have to create different forms to
show cycle time and calibration
record. Above is the “Gage List”
and below are: first, the “Cycle

1.0 
  PURPOSE
  Maintain control over inspection, measuring, and test equipment.
2.0 
  APPLICATION
  This procedure shall apply to all types of Company and employee owned inspec-
  tion, measuring, and test equipment, as well as to those under loan agreement
  (verbal or documented).
3.0 
  PROCEDURE
  General Requirement
            Record keeping shall be the acceptable means to demonstrate control of inspec-
            tion, measuring and test equipment, including test software, and comparative
            references. The control of measuring and test equipment shall comply with ISO
            10012 -1 and/or ANSI/NCSL Z540-1. Computerized data collection shall be
            allowed to maintain the records of calibration.
The built-in variability (gage maker’s tolerance) of the selected measuring and
            test equipment shall be known in order to be able to assign that equipment to
            validate a specified requirement (dimension, weight, etc.) to the defined tolerance
            limits. (Match the equipment to the capability requirement.) Any software used in
measuring applications shall be confirmed prior to its application.
The documented accuracy of the calibration masters shall be traceable to known
            standards (national or international, or even to a homemade standard in excep-
            tional cases) in order to ensure suitability for the intended confirmation require-
            ment. The documented accuracy and repeatability of the calibration masters and
            comparative references shall be certified by independent authority at predeter-
            mined intervals, based on the equipment manufacturer recommendations or as
            otherwise specified by internal requirement.
The calibration records shall demonstrate the frequency (cycle time) of confirma-
tions of all the identified measuring and test equipment, including process own-
ers’ equipment and test software. Traceable record maintenance shall be a re-
quirement as evidence of control. The calibration records shall be made available
to customers or their representatives upon request.

                                                                                       ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES    187

The Calibration Technician does:
     Controlling the Identification of Gages
Uniquely identify (label) all inspection, measuring, and
test equipment. Do this either on the instrument itself, or
when that’s not possible, on the container holding the
instrument
1
         Caution
Use discretion when metal
stamping or other types of
identification means are
used so as not to damage
the internal mechanism of
the equipment.
Uniquely identify the employee owned measuring and
test equipment which they use to verify and accept the
Company’s product(s)
2
         Instruction
Check above under Basic In-
formation the form called:
“Gage Calibration List.”  The
ID number shown for a gage
will have to be transferred
onto the Calibration Sticker for
the specified Company’s gage.
Check also “The Personal
Gage List” for the same reason
for the employee owned gages.
Control the inventory of those gages that are on loan
agreement or on borrowed bases. Identify them on form
A-020 (Cal. Status Report) only. Don’t calibrate these as
the owners do the scheduling of calibration. Verify their
accuracy and repeatability by similarity comparison and
record the results on form A-020, as required
3
Ensure that the ID number assigned to each measuring
and test equipment is always maintained on the specific
equipment (Calibration Sticker) and on all the calibration
related documents even if that equipment is removed
from service
4
Don’t reassign the once issued ID number to any other
equipment (new or refurbished) unless the old calibra-
tion record clearly states the replacement requirements
and can substantiate the was versus the is calibration
accuracy and repeatability status
5
Identify all the equipment no longer suitable for measur-
ing and test requirements as “No Longer in Service.”
Stamp, or sign and date the label. Or scrap the equip-
ment.

5
Keep the Training Log, form A-016, up to date whenever
training instructions to the employees have been provid-
ed, especially for new employees
6
       Instruction
Don’t consider cursory
reminders as truly mean-
ingful instructions, for
you will end up logging in
meaningless results all
day long. Enter only those
instructions onto form A-
016 that give employees
real benefit of learning
and training.
Maintain surveillance throughout the processing areas or
where the measuring and test equipment is being used to
ensure safe containment and handling of the equipment.
Ensure on spot corrective action through supervision, as
appropriate.

Place a stamped, or signed and dated Calibration Sticker
on each identified measuring and test equipment accord-
ing to the calibration and due date recorded on form A-
020. For the employee gages, do it as required by the
Employee Gage Calibration Cycle Time sheet shown
above under Basic Information. Observe the following:
2
Don’t place calibration stickers on individual pin (plug)
gages belonging to a set. Place the sticker on the box
containing the pins. The same thing applies to size
blocks and other gage sets. The “Calibration Certificate”
is your “Proof of Record.” Describe it as such on form
A-020, under the description ‘Status.’ Attach the cert to
the back of form A-020 and tuck both documents in a
Sheet Protector. Then, stack these Sheet Protectors in a
binder
2a
Some shops have work reference plug gages and size
blocks that are not in the calibration system due to down-
grading. That’s OK. But put a note on the box containing
the gages, “For Reference Only – Verify Before Use –
Not For Product Acceptance”
2b
Some shops have granite surface plates and other equip-
ment located in the most obvious places that are not
exactly to the “Standards” but are perfectly useable for

OVERVIEW TO QOP 008
(CONTROL OF INSPECTION AND TEST STATUS)
The control of inspection and test status means a lot more than just keeping track of in-
spection stamps and passwords. The meaning behind it has everything to do with the
authorized use or application of them. The authorized use of this media signifies that a
product has been verified, accepted, and released to go on to the next determined step in
the product’s finishing cycle. Without it, we would not know whether any phase opera-
tion was checked or not. We would be going on and on finishing a product only to find
out at the end that from the first piece on to the last piece everything was rejected. No-
body indicated along the way that any processing step was controlled. What a way to
learn a lesson! So, those who are authorized to release products from operation to opera-
tion bear a very significant responsibility in the application of inspection stamps and
passwords. QOP 008 will define for you how to go about controlling the use of signa-
tures, stamps, and passwords.

 Control of Inspection and Test Status
   What
   does it
   mean?
Products going through the various
processing steps need to be controlled
by the indication of inspection and test
status at each step of the process in
order to know whether they were
accepted or rejected. This indication is
best done (by stamping or signature)
on the Job Traveler and/or  Operation
Sheet. Depending on the inspection
and test requirements, Quality may
add certain other controlling docu-
ments along the way to ensure that the
inspection and test results meet the
customer’s requirement (rework/repair
on A-023). The last inspection and
test status is indicated when the
product is released for delivery to the
customer. Inspection and test status
may also be indicated on the product
itself, if authorized.
Hardly. Even the best minds miss
direction at times. Correcting mis-
takes far away from the process
where they happened can be very
costly. The best controls are those
that isolate the nonconformance as
it happens and implement the
required corrective action. But we
are not always successful. This is
why we should enforce inspection
and test indication at every speci -
fied process, so the non-conformi-
ty is caught where it happened and
not at the end of the process cycle.
We should only allow a non-
conforming product to continue
when we know that it will be
corrected at one of the later pro -
cesses. Never without documen-
tation, however. (See scroll on the
left)

of a casting when it has been
over or under cut within a
certain limit of the tolerance.
At finishing it will become
conforming to the specified
requirement. Still, correct the
mistake on the spot and
document it so the next
operator knows what had
happened and can adjust his
equipment to compensate for
the error.
Products without the
indication of inspection
and test status shouldn’t be
allowed to be moved onto
the next processing phase

3.0     PROCEDURE
          General Requirement
Inspection and test status indication shall be applied to product acceptance and
release during the entire processing cycle, including products that are on hold
and/or waiting for disposition. The indication of inspection and test status may be
executed on the product itself, as required, but not without backup documentation
to prove it. All products stored for further processing or shipment to customers
shall have the inspection and test status indicated (on the Job Traveler or A-013).
Computerized (software based) document and data management for product related
matters shall require access code (password) for all employees whose assignments
affect product quality. Product acceptance and release indication executed through
a software based documentation system shall be limited to designated personnel,
responsible for the acceptance and release of the identified product(s). The issuance
of access codes (passwords) shall be documented and controlled. Periodic monitor-
ing by the issuing authority to ensure proper application of the access codes shall
be enforced and adequately documented, as required.

     Instruction
Destroy all worn-out
stamps and cross out
their inventory status.
Determine who will be the stamp owners, autho-
rized to use the stamps for specific applications,
according to their assignments to accept and re-
lease products. Issue and distribute to the stamp
owners a Quality Directive on the application of
stamps and the associated responsibility. Use
form A-003 (blank) on which to issue this direc-
tive, as appropriate

       Suggestion
Don’t make QOPs or SOPs
for the purpose of Quality
Directives or other instruc-
tional communications for
then you will have to control
them similarly as the proce -
dures are controlled in this
book. Form A-003 was de-
signed to take care of all
internal communication re-
quirements. Just fill in the
header part of the form ac-
cording to the type of direc -
tive you wish to issue or
control. Cite references as
required and place “N/A”
when things don’t apply.
Then, go and write your
statements in the blank
space below.
Assign the stamps according to documentation
requirement stated on form A-032
3
Monitor the application of the issued stamps, as
required, to prevent improper use. Record the mo-
nitoring results onto form A-022. When finished,
sign and date this form and hand it over to the
Management Representative. Take corrective
action, as required. In severe cases resort to the
NCMR process (QOP 009) for C/A implementa-
tion, as appropriate (pg 207)
4
      Instruction
The NCMR process for
C/A is not limited for
product handling only.
Corrective Action ap-
plies uniformly to pro-
ducts, documents, and
people, as required.

6
Retain forms A-003 (Quality Directive) and A-
032 in one file folder. (When issuing stamps,
issue the Quality Directive at the same time.)
7
          STANDARD
The stamp owner’s signa-
ture on Form A-032 repre-
sents the acceptance of re-
sponsibility in the proper
application of the issued
stamp(s). The stamp(s)
owner may apply his/her
signature on the processing
related documents instead
of using the authorized
stamp(s) in the acceptance
and release of product(s).
    The Control of Electronic Passwords
Determine the need as to methods used in the is-
suance, limitation, and application of electronic
access codes (passwords). Accordingly, issue and
distribute a Communication Directive, using form
A-003, as appropriate, informing the employees
about basic requirements and conduct, regarding
password ownership, application, and responsibi-
lity

OVERVIEW TO QOP 009
(CONTROL OF NON-CONFORMING PRODUCTS)
This procedure is about controlling non-conforming products and it is the third longest
procedure by design. Don’t be surprised to learn that in a process-approach quality
management system, the control of non-conforming products also means controlling
deficiencies in documents, processes, and methods. We cannot have an effectively run
business by controlling hardware problems alone when the contributing causes of the
non-conformance originated by deficiencies in documents, processes, and methods. Con-
trolling deficiency in every process from planning to the delivery of the product is the
quintessential driver in a process-approach system to effect on time continuous improve-
ment to the operating management system. The lack of this type of control in businesses
of all types is the hornet’s nest from which everybody runs away instead of facing it and
eliminating it through effective corrective action. This QOP has been linked to other
QOPs in the quality management system, and the other QOPs in turn have been linked to
this QOP, in order to bring about solving the festering problems in all the core depart-
mental activities, contributing directly or indirectly to the deficiencies in documents, pro-
cesses, methods and products. Once a non-conformance has been identified and written
up on Form A-006, MRB is required to call for corrective action in line with the
significance of the problem. The application of the type of statistical tools at this time
will be determined by the Management Representative in the quest to identify the root
cause(s) of the problem at hand, should supervision have failed to do so. The
implementation of corrective action cannot be shoved aside, cannot be ignored, and
cannot be turned over to Management Reviews as long as there are documented
procedures in force to cure it. The Management Representative cannot close out any
Form A-006 (Non-conforming Material Report) until he/she has followed up the effective
implementation of corrective/preventive action. Under this system, the Management
Representative is being independently audited for compliance. This is the significance of
the stated provisions in QOP 009.

SUBJECT: Some Basic Information
QOP 009  DOCUMENT REQ’D: Section One, Two, and Three of this procedure
           Control of Non-conforming Products
What is a
nonconform-
ing product?
Anything that violates a speci-
fied requirement. It could be
errors in documented proce-
dures, or in processing related
methods, or in the processed
product itself.
Note!
By quality classification, there
are only two types of products
within any organization:
1. 
Conforming to specified
requirements
2. 
Non-conforming to
specified requirements
Both should be controlled and
inter-linked through the appli -
cation of documented pro-
cedures.
   What’s the
   meaning of
   specified?
Specified means that a require-
ment is stated in writing. All
the Quality Management
System’s documented proce-
dures have different kinds of
specified requirements. The
control of nonconforming pro-
ducts is just one out of many
others of the system’s
documented procedures that
has specified requirements.
When can we
call a product
nonconform-
ing?
When the nonconformance has
been demonstrated by documen-
tation that it does not meet the
specified requirement(s) of the
controlling procedures.
           Some Pointers
1. When a product does not meet
the processing requirements im-
posed by controlling documents
(drawing, Job Traveler, Operation
Sheet, etc.)
2. When the documented proce-
dures contain errors that may
affect product quality
3. When the work results don’t
comply with the specified
requirements.
    Note!
When a product is made “better than”
the specified requirement, without
configuration violation, that is not
considered to be a non-conforming
product. It is an improvement beyond
what the customer wanted and is
acceptable by all customers. Exam-
ple: workmanship of all kinds.

QOP 009 DOCUMENT REQ’D: Section One, Two, and Three of this procedure
1.0 
STANDARD
Maintain control over non-conforming products, documents, and actions affecting
product quality.
2.0 
APPLICATION
This procedure shall apply to the handling, reporting, and documentation of non-
conforming products, documents, and actions affecting product quality.
3.0     Definitions
1. Deviation – a specific customer authorization issued prior to the manufacture
      of a product to allow departure from a defined design requirement for a speci-
      fic number of units for a specific duration.
2. Product non-conformance – is any condition that violates the requirement of
a specification, process, or procedure.
3. Repair -- a non-conforming product which cannot be further processed to
meet a specified requirement without written approval from the customer.
4. Rework – a non-conforming product which can be reprocessed under defined
conditions to meet a specified drawing requirement.
5. Waiver – a written request sent to a customer for disposition of a non-
conforming product.
4.0     General Requirements
           Non-conformance in product(s) and documented procedures shall be verified and
           documented in order to be processed as a reported non-conformance. Otherwise, it
           would lack the documented evidence to prove the indication of non-conformance
           (Forms A-018 and A-009).
           Decisions made by the reviewing authority (MRB) shall be unanimous. In case of
           conflict, the management shall make the final decision.
           A minimum of two (2) members of the reviewing authority shall be required to
           make a decision binding. One of the members shall always be a quality represen-
           tative. The customer has final authority over non-reworkable products.

          Maintain control over the reporting of non-conformance.
2.0     APPLICATION
          This procedural section shall apply to the process of reporting non-conformance:

The Reporting Authority does:
             Internal Reporting
Determine whether the non-conformance is:
 
Error in documented procedures (1a )
 
Rejected materials (used collectively) (1b)
 
Both of the above (through NCMR) (1c)
 
Other (actions) (1d )
1
          Instruction
Error in documented proce-
dures could involve the pro-
cess and the product. Resolve
it through issuing an NCMR.
Correct the error in documented procedures in ac-
cordance with QOP 002, Section Two, paragraph
3.03.1. Use form A-009 to do it (pg 73)
1a
            Instruction
Form A-009 (Amendment to Pro-
cedures) works like an ECN (Engi-
neering Change Notice), or a NOR
(Notice of Revision)  when you
have a Designing Department.
When there is
no Designing
Department,
document
change control
is always a
problem!
Process the rejected material(s) in accordance
with this QOP 009, Section Two or Three. Use
form A-006 (Nonconforming Material Report) to
do it, as applicable
1b
            Instruction
Notify all affected parties,
including the customer!
When both error in documented procedures and
rejected material(s) are present, follow “1b” just
above
1c
When C/A is required, due to lack of compliance
with written procedures, or with audit results im-
plementation, or with any other major violation,
process it through this QOP 009, Section Two.
Use form A-006.

                 Note!
A significant element of our Quali-
ty Management System is the built-
in methods to correct all types of
non-compliance through the MRB
process to ensure and effect spon-
taneous improvement to the operat-
ing system.

ducts. (pg 116)
 Reporting Nonconformance to Subcontractors
Follow the instructions stated in this QOP 009,
Section Two, paragraph 3.01.4.4 regarding sub-
contractor rejects (RTV). (pg 212)
       NCMR Issuance Control
Record (enter) the sequentially maintained
NCMR serial number onto form A-007 before
issuing an NCMR. Locate the NCMR Register
(A-007) in front of the latest NCMR collection
held in a binder. Follow the instructions in this
QOP 009, Section Two, paragraph 3.01.1 regard-
ing the processing of NCMRs. (pg 207)
          Instruction
Each issued NCMR must be
accounted for, reported, track-
ed, dispositioned, implement-
ed, followed up, and closed
out.
        End of Section One
        Observation
There will always be
areas where you question
whether the issuance of
an NCMR will be cost
effective to disposition
problems. Questions to
ask: Is it product and
customer related? Does
it require documented
corrective action? Does
the NCMR processing
cost far exceed the
significance of the
problem? What’s the
impact of this error,
upstream/downstream?
Can this problem snow-
ball into a bigger prob-
lem? If your answer to
the above is “No,” on-
spot preventive action
would be the best
alternative solution.
Follow it up later to
ensure effectiveness.

3.01.1
The Reporting Authority does:
Processing Nonconforming Material Reports (A-006)
Obtain a blank form of A-006. Observe that the
form is divided into 6 sections, each requiring
specific entry
1
Assign from the NCMR Register (A-007) onto
form A-006 (top right) the next sequential S/N.
Locate the NCMR Register in front of the latest
collection of NCMRs in a binder. Use additional
blanks of A-006 as continuation sheets under the
same S/N, as required
2
Transfer the product-related data from the Inspec-
tion Report (A-018) onto the NCMR in section
one and two. Post the NCMR S/N onto form A-
018 and other related documents, as required.
Sign and date the NCMR under “Inspector” and
turn it over to the supervisor for his review and
approval.

              Note!
When reporting non-product
related problems to effect cor-
rective action in processes, or
in failure to carry out spe-
cified requirements, the
NCMR may stand alone to
enforce MRB decisions.

Rely on technical support when
facing the unknown. Don’t
guess! The management repre-
sentative is your best guide in
this process. He may need to
look deeper in order to isolate
the contributing causes to the
problem at hand that you were
unable to do from the available
data.
Describe the contributing reasons for the noncon-
formance in the third block on form A-006. Don’t
explain the end result. We all know that from the
Inspection Report (A-018)
2
The effectiveness
of corrective ac-
tion depends on
your explanation
of what the cause
was. So don’t
guess or write
something silly!
Sign and date under ‘Supervisor’ as indicated and
send this NCMR together with all related
documents (A-018, etc.) and the product to the
Material Review Board (MRB), as practical.
3
                MRB Disposition
Review and evaluate the inspection results (from
A-018) and the cause (from A-006) of the non-
conformance in order to determine the appropri -
ate steps to take in dispositioning the subject non-
conformance
1
Note!
Quality is a permanent member of
MRB. “Engineering” may be substi-
tuted, as required.
Observe that there may be cases
where MRB authority, other than
“REWORK,” is not granted by the
customer. A question may arise:
Should I need an “Engineering”
signature on the NCMR (Form A-
006) in order to submit a “Waiver” to
the customer? The answer is: Yes.
While the waiver shows only a partial
information of the rejected product,
the NCMR shows all of it. It serves
as a cross-functional activity indica-
tor, incorporating the required actions
needed to implement improvements.
The closure of NCMR should ensure
that all requirements have been satis-
fied including waiver requirement(s).
See paragraph 3.01.7 below.
Make the disposition and indicate under ‘MRB
Disposition’ the appropriate action required. Do
this by encircling the activity indicator(s) (RWK,
RPR, ACC, RTV, SCR, Waiver. Next, add under
‘Instruction/Comment,’ in line with the affected
item(s), any relevant information required to be
followed by those who will be implementing your
disposition(s)
2
Determine whether any C/A is required. Enter
this requirement as indicated on A-006. Then,
sign and date as shown, authorizing enforcement

     PROCEDURE
      Customer Complaints, Product Return,
   and Satisfaction Reports
Now that customer satisfaction has become
the main driver in product quality enforce-
ment, organizations need to have a closer
look at how they develop and implement
documented procedures that would better
measure customer complaints. Let’s look at
the objectives. What is customer satis-
faction? Is it what the customer likes and  is
satisfied with? Or is it what meets all the
requirements that he has stated in his
Purchase Order? There could be a wide gap
between the two. The first one could be
highly subjective, while the second one,
highly objective. We will be dealing here
with the latter one, for that is the defined
requirement that can be enacted through the
application of written procedures. The first
one is packed with a lot of gray areas. The
main point, however, is how we pay closer
attention to customer complaints.
What are
we talking
about?

                  General Requirement
     Product acceptance by the customers through the “Customer Complaint and
                  Evaluation Report” (Form A-038) is not a contractual requirement unless it is
                  specifically stated in the customer’s Purchase Order. Product deficiencies
                  between the customer and the supplier’s organization in contractual relation-
                  ships are handled through the Quality Provisions of the customer’s Purchase
                  Orders (SCAR provisions) and the Company’s documented procedures, the
                  “Control of Non-conforming Products” stipulated in QOP 009. Therefore, the
                  application of Form A-038 is a self-imposed requirement to document and
                  implement those areas of product concerns that fall outside the established
                  documented system. The purpose of the application of Form A-038 is to
                  ensure ultimate customer satisfaction in product quality beyond those provi-
                  sions stipulated in customers’ Purchase Orders. Failure to define by the cus-
                  tomers the Quality Provisions in their Purchase Orders shall not be construed
                  by the customers as accepting responsibility by the supplier’s organization
                  through the application of Form A-038.
    Form A-038 is a multipurpose document: 1. designed to handle customer com-
                  plaints reported outside of the SCAR provisions of the customer’s Purchase
                  Order. (See paragraph 3.01 above) 2. designed to handle the unsolicited pro-
                  duct evaluation responses that customers may wish to express when they re-
                  ceive a delivered product. (Covered under this paragraph 3.04)

OVERVIEW TO QOP 010
     (INTERNAL QUALITY AUDIT)
The quality system procedures in this process-approach system don’t resemble the
standard operating procedures (SOP) in conventional quality systems. The quality
procedures in this system have been designed to be user-friendly in all areas as to the
identification of requirement, the definition of responsibility, work assignment, ac-
countability, and process flow. For an auditor to spend more time on compiling the
checklist than on doing the audit itself is absolutely unacceptable in economic terms.
This, of course, is not the auditor’s problem. How the quality system’s procedures have
been laid out and integrated must lend a user-friendly flow process in which what you
need is right in front of you. Since internal audits are done mostly by in-house em-
ployees, it makes a big difference economically whether the auditor spends a few hours
or a few days in accomplishing internal audits. I paid serious attention to this also when I
planned the layout of my procedures, for I used to do audits at many companies in my
forty years service and could not easily find where and how responsibilities were linked
to work assignments in the conventionally written SOPs. Every quality operating proce-
dure in this process-approach system is also a checklist, not only for the auditor, but also
for the process owner and his supervisor as well. Note the dramatic shift from con-
ventional methods as to how we maintain continuous improvement in training employees
whenever corrective action requirement points to the operators’ lack of understanding of
their work assignment. The details of the audit process are the subject of this QOP.

                                                                                        ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   225

        Internal Quality Audits
What are
we audit-
ing for?
We are auditing to determine if the
planned requirements have been carried
out according to the quality objectives
we have established in the documented
procedures. We do this in order to iso-
late non-conformities to enable us to
measure their impact on the product,
processes, and procedures to implement
corrective action for improvement.
What type
of audit?
We are doing Quality System
conformance audit – a first-party
audit.
What about
in-process
surveil-
lance?
In-process surveillance is a compo-
nent of the Quality System audit
identified under clause paragraph 4.9
in the Quality Manual. We have
created a separate operating procedure
to do that. It is located under QOP
006, Section Three (pg 151) and is
called “Process Control Surveillance.”
Some Basic Information
Why
separate
the two?
The quality system audit is broad
based, while the in-process surveil-
lance is limited to a specific assign-
ment.  The system audit includes the
review of in-process surveillance as
well in order to determine whether
they are done according to the
requirement mentioned just above.

1.0 
  PURPOSE
  Maintain control over the process of carrying out internal quality system audits.
2.0 
  APPLICATION
  The provisions of this operating procedure shall apply to: determining internal
  audit requirements, carrying out internal quality system audits and documentation
  of those activities.
3.0 
  PROCEDURE
3.01  Definition
Audit – a planned, independent review and verification process to determine com-
pliance to the approved procedures of the Quality Management System.
3.02 
The manual defines in policy statements the quality system’s requirements and
gives linkage by reference or inclusion to the applicable process instructions,
known as Quality Operating Procedures (QOPs). The manual follows the layout
of ISO 9002/1994 and within these provisions incorporates the requirements of
ISO 9001/2000. It reflects every clause of the Standard according to its numerical
layout, except clauses 4.4 and 4.19.
Auditors must first understand the specific paragraph requirement in the quality
manual and have familiarity with the referenced or included process instructions
(QOPs)  before undertaking audits. This is a prerequisite for auditors to enable
them to carry out any planned audit(s) effectively. Auditors shall not impose their
own set of requirements to contradict the provisions of the established and imple-
mented Quality Management System.

The Auditor does:
Don’t commit
audit scheduling
to exact timing!
It doesn’t happen
that way!
      Reminder
The same Audit
Schedule (A-021)
should be used year
after year, even if
changes have been
made to it.
      Reminder!
While internal system
audits are often done by
the Management Repre-
sentative, there must be
someone else appointed
also who would audit his
audit performance to
ensure independent
assessment. It sounds like
no end to the audit pro-
cess, but the Registrar will
look for results in this
area.
Observe: that a QOP outlines the specific work
compliance requirement stated in the Quality
Manual: that each page of a QOP has been page
plated to guide you to understand linkage and
document requirement
1
Observe: that the process  instruction procedures
embodied in QOPs guide you forward to under-
stand the task at hand and at the same time refers
you to the specific forms used by the process
owners to record work results: that each QOP
gives you indication of linkage to other QOPs,
enabling you to find the exact enforcement re-
quirement for the identified task
2
Observe: that each QOP is a stand-alone docu-
ment that may contain several interrelated work
assignments, step by step, requiring work perfor-
mance accomplishment and documentation of
work results by the process owners
3
          Example
QOP 006 (Inspection and Test
Control) contains 7 interrelat-
ed work assignments:
 
first piece inspection
 
first article qualification
 
process control
 
final inspection
 
receiving inspection
 
customer source insp.
 
source inspection at subs.
Observe: that when auditing is carried out, the
QOP sections and the related paragraphs should
be identified and documented in the Audit Plan
(Reporting), form A-022, to indicate the specific
audit effort
4
Observe: that in order to determine conformance
or nonconformance to the specified requirements,
the applicable procedures and forms will have to
be reviewed and understood ahead of time
5
Observe: that the Management Representative
may perform the quality system audit(s) provided
that he/she is not the direct process owner of the
work assignment being audited
6
Observe: that when the Management Representa-
tive performs a scheduled (A-021) quality system
audit, his/her audit performance shall be verified
(audited) by any other independent agent to estab-
lish definite audit compliance. (Use the same
QOP 010, including Audit Reporting (A-022))

The Auditor does:
         Forms?
Each form has a refe-
rence indication given
at the bottom left to
guide the user back to
the QOP for instruc-
tions on application.
         Doing the Audit
Obtain from the Management Representative the
latest (approved and released) Quality Manual,
the Quality Operating Procedures Manual and the
Audit Schedule (form A-021). Obtain the Audit
Plan (Reporting) form (A-022) from the Forms
File (many will be needed)
1
Take the Audit Schedule (A-021) and determine
which clause paragraph is scheduled to be audit-
ed for the specified month. Find that clause para-
graph in the Quality Manual
2
Review all the requirements given under the
clause paragraph in the manual. Then, review the
work performance requirements, given either un-
der the clause paragraph in the manual, or linked
to a Quality Operating Procedure. Review the
applicable form(s) assigned either in the manual
or the QOP
3
Prepare (fill out) the left side of the Audit Plan,
form (A-022). Write down in the form what will
be audited. Show, step by step, the applicable
QOP, the Section in the QOP, and the paragraphs
4
Carry out the audit in accordance with the process
instructions given in the applicable sections of the
QOP, or the Quality Manual. Verify, as required,
the work result documentation, recorded by the
process owner(s) in the applicable form(s). Deter-
mine compliance
5
Record on the right side of the Audit Plan (Re-
porting) form (A-022), in line with the identified
paragraph, the non-compliance found during your
audit. If none, indicate None. Report the facts and
not what you would like to be done. Follow the
procedure. If the procedure is wrong or mis-
leading, report that also.
6
          Instruction
An auditor is not allowed to
make judgments which would
impact product quality or the
process owners’ job perfor-
mance.
              Note!
You are looking at a fully integ-
rated, documented system, laid
out in line with process evolu-
tion. You don’t need to scurry
around in the procedures to find
linkage to a requirement. All of
it is right in front of you on every
page of the operating procedures.
The page header will tell you
where the requirement is coming
from. It will tell you the needed
documents related to the process.
In the body of the procedure, you
find that the responsibility is
identified, the work assignment
is defined, and the process steps
are elaborated. Every page of the
procedures is designed to be a
checklist for both the process
owner as well as the auditor.

If performance had not been carried out and doc-
umented as required by the work instruction, im-
plement corrective action through supervision in
accordance with QOP 006, Section Three, par
3.0, step 2 (pg 151), as appropriate, in line with
the identified supervisory responsibility. If
NCMR enforcement is required, do it in accor-
dance with QOP 009, Section Two (pg 207)
4a
         Instruction
Corrective action imple -
mentation may not be an
easy process when more
than one problem-one cause
is at hand. You may need to
do cause and effect diagram-
ming and failure mode effect
analysis (FMEA) as well as
some serious brainstorming
and benchmarking to pin
down the actual causes of
problems before deciding on
cross-functional corrective
action implementation.
While the implementation
process is fully described
here for you, the knowledge
and skill in the application
of statistical tools you
should possess as part of
your job description as Man-
agement Representative.

OVERVIEW TO QOP 011
      
      (MANAGEMENT REVIEW)
Management Review in a process-approach system is not the forum to present a
stupendous pile of papers to impress upper management that lots of things were done but
there are still numerous unmanageable problems outstanding, making the operating sys-
tem ineffective. This sort of thing happens when companies implement ISO compliant
systems according to the way they always ran their businesses. They have documented all
their weaknesses and not much had been improved in product quality. They have now
little more to show except a mountain of records and lots of bills, awaiting review. You
see, under a process-approach system the responsibilities for process owners are defined
from the beginning to the end in the product’s processing cycle and work assignment
accountability to requirement is demonstrated at every process in the chain of events. The
product is only an object, moving through the cycle, controlled by the process and not by
the problems. Every process owner checks his/her work, because nobody else can build
quality in the product. At the end you are ready to ship that product to the customer. This
is how customer satisfaction is also built into the processes.
Controlling non-conformance in documents, processes, methods, and products is also
managed as a process. The problems are not pushed aside to be forgotten until they strike
back again. So, management is given all the good news how problems were solved as
part of process control and not as pending management review to look for improvements
where improvements would do nothing more than fanning the wind – too late to add
value to the process. Yet, management reviews are very important to assess successes and
through it set new business plans for growth in an effectively managed production envi-
ronment. In a process-approach system, management makes improvements on the basis
of successes − a very significant change from the ISO philosophy.

               Management Review
What does
it mean?
But I’m the
only Boss!
What then?
Isn’t this
just window
dressing?
A review process by executive
management to ensure continu-
ing suitability and effectiveness
of the Quality Management
System.
If you were the “only Boss” who
made that business decision to im-
plement a Quality Management
System, then, you will be the
“only Boss” with whom the
Management Review will be
conducted.
Never should be. Under Management Responsibility as stated in
the Quality Manual, the commitment and objectives for the
quality system have been stated. In the Quality Operating Pro-
cedures, they have been translated into performance require-
ment to ensure operational effectiveness in all the core depart-
ments of the company. Because of the “process-approach” lay-
out of the documented system, there should be no questions left
open as to what is supposed to be done in any areas within the
core departments to satisfy those objectives. Any major setback
discovered through the scheduled system audit should be viewed
first as probably due to the lack of enforcement, rather than to
the flaws in definition. A process approach management system
must have built-in corrective action procedures to cure both the
flaws in definition and the lack of enforcement. The operating
procedures presented in this book have the built-in corrective
action tools to remedy these and other operations’ related
problems. There is a delegated authority built into these
procedures to overcome any window dressing perception. We
don’t do business just for the sake of satisfying the provisions of
a Standard. We do business to satisfy internal and external
product quality requirements that happen to fall in line with the
provisions of a Standard.

SUBJECT: Some Basic Information
QOP 011  DOCUMENT REQ’D:  Forms A-003, A-006, A-007, A-034
Who should
attend?
In a small shop environment, Management Reviews may not
even take place in a formal gathering. It may be done one on
one between the “Boss” and the Management Representative.
There is nothing wrong in doing it this way, so long as the
documentation  of things are also taken care of. It could also
be that the Management Representative himself is in charge of
the same core departments he is to shake up for the purpose of
improvement. What is relevant though is the fact that manage-
ment addresses the recognized setbacks and commits itself to
correct them. The ceremonial hoopla may be nothing more
than handing out corrective action requirements to take care of
any setback, so that the objectives of the quality system ad-
vance to a higher level of improvement from where they were
before. In small business those should also attend Manage-
ment Reviews who are identified as part of the problem. For
seeing the presentation from a different angle, they would
better understand the implementation of improvement.
How often
to hold it?
As often as required by significant events -  major improve-
ment recommendations resulting from assessments in pro-
duction planning, customer complaints, nonconformance
analysis, environmental and maintenance anomalies, training
related deficiencies, supervisory non-commitment to the
documented system’s requirements, and more. Problems that
cannot be solved within the framework of the documented
system, yet impact it, should be the major drivers in deciding
how often to hold Management Reviews. The first year after
implementation, Management Reviews should be frequent.
People don’t want to part with nonproductive habits, don’t
want to follow controls and record keeping. But when
discipline takes over, Management Reviews done once or
twice a year should be sufficient. (Remember though, if the
“Boss” doesn’t fully back up the Management Represen-
tative, Management Reviews become meaningless. The whole
system will go back the way it was before, or even worse.)
What’s the
essential
input?
The essential input for Management Reviews should be:
1. 
Product quality improvement.
2. 
Setbacks that can’t be cured through the current
provisions of the corrective action procedures.
All other inputs should be considered as riders with
these, proving how the assessed audit results were
handled to maintain effectiveness. In a process-approach
quality management system, there should be little room
left for system deficiency, for the system itself must em-
body, through its layout, the core departmental provi-
sions and address them through enforceable procedures.
But, as in all systems, there is always room for improve-
ment, especially with new business prospects, or addi -
tional inclusion of other functions (EPA, OSHA, etc.) to
the already established system.

                                                                                        ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   239

QOP 011  DOCUMENT REQ’D:  Forms A-003, A-006, A-007, A-034
What’s the
process?
From the above given exhortation, it should be clear that a
good management review has everything to do with examin-
ing the results of internal audit assessment, impacting the
objectives to reach effectiveness. Those who are present at
the management review should decide from the presented
material  – trend analysis, cost comparisons, throughput
diagrams – where to add or take away requirements to shift
the operating practices to serve the profitability of the com-
pany and yet, meet customer satisfaction. The Management
Representative should be in full charge of the review process
according to the agenda he had identified in his Management
Review Status Record, Form A-034. (It can also happen in
small shops that there is no reviewing team other than the
“Boss” and the Management Representative. The circum -
stances are that these two individuals do the managing of the
company. So, a management review in this case would be
rather informal and yet very effective. Still, the documenta -
tion end of things must be taken care of. It is for this very
reason that Form A-034 had been so designed - simple, yet
contains the essential requirements.)
What’s the
outcome?
(output)
As indicated in the first step of this ‘Basic Information,’
Management Review is a review process – input/ work
process/ output. The central part of this three-step process is
every bit dependent on how the first part ‘input’ was plan-
ned to achieve expected results  - ‘output.’ Decisive results
from management reviews cannot be expected when the
input is grounded in wishy-washy planning and incoherent
data to support the decision making process. In this view
then, the Management Representative should be keenly
aware of the comprehensiveness and factuality of the pre-
sentation material required for the agenda. Without thorough
preparation, the decision maker(s) would only be guessing
the outcome, which would surely be harmful to any mean-
ingful improvement. It would become counter productive.
After it’s
over, then
what?
It’s never really over. Management Review is an
ongoing process, interrupted either by preparing for
the next one, or implementing the decisions of the
last one.  The last review should always be inter-
linked with the next review to indicate continuous
improvement.

PURPOSE
Define the Company’s management review requirements in order to assess, as
often as necessary, the suitability and effectiveness of the quality management
system.

APPLICATION
The provisions of this procedure shall apply to the preparation, presentation,
conclusion, and follow-up of management reviews.
3.0 
PROCEDURE
3.01     General Requirement
            Management Reviews shall be based on the results of effective assessment of the
            internal audits of the Quality Management System. Effectiveness of performance
            shall be measured against targeted limits (threshold) established in line with the
            internal (organizational) and external (customer satisfaction) business interest
            (risk limits) of the Company. Reason: Without being able to demonstrate compli-
            ance versus noncompliance (ratios) against realistically established threshold lim-
            its, the goals to accomplish the set objectives of the quality system would miss the
            reason for additional improvements beyond the routine improvements accom-
            plished through the corrective action provisions of QOP 009.
            The Management Representative shall be responsible for establishing reasonable
            threshold limits (maximum allowable non-compliance figures) in all the areas
            where this can be objectively implemented in order to know when to trigger
            (plan-do-check-act) corrective measures to remove the causes that negatively
            impacted the goals to achieve the business objectives of the Company. (See para-
            graph 3.02, step 2 on pg 241.) When the corrective measures, identified through
            assessment, cannot be implemented through the provisions of QOP 009, Sections
            Two and Three, the Management Representative shall set the agenda for Manage-
            ment Review.
            Management shall not be called to session to review issues for which the answers
            to solve them are given in the documented procedures, for that would be derelic-
            tion (shirking one’s duty). Conversely, when the lack of enforcement on the part
            of the delegated authority (supervision) impacts compliance with the provisions of
            the documented system, management shall be called to session to implement cor-
            rective action.

                                                                                        ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   241

     Preparation for Management Review
Review the statistical results of the internal audit as-
sessment. Determine the levels of non-compliance.
Determine whether they have been cured through the
corrective action provisions of QOP 009, Sections
Two and Three. If they have not been cured, set the

Determine new objectives, recommendations, and
solutions
1
Before calling
management into
session take a

Gather the supporting data to justify Management
Review – supporting data to demonstrate to manage-
ment both the positive and the negative areas of the
internal audit assessment. Show the effectiveness
versus the lack of effectiveness in respect to overall
performance objectives. Prepare proposal for how to
resolve the lack of effectiveness. Describe this on
form A-003 to support your discussion (persuasion)
points during Management Review. Issue it to all.

Your NCMRs are
a major source for
determining the
dispersion of
problems. Pick the
high numbers for
C/A.
Select the participants to the Management Review.
Ensure that those against whom corrective action
may be issued are present. Management wants to
hear their input for solutions
3
Compile the supporting data in order of presentation.
Make enough copies of these documents so that each
participant can have a copy ahead of time
4
Draw up the agenda for the Management Review un-
der sections 1 and 2 of form A-034. Complete the
“Attendees, Place and Date” sections. Distribute
form A-034 to all participants
5
Trend analysis of
recurring problems
may reveal major
flaws in training
methods, or how
enforcement is
carried out, or even
the requirement to
change procedures.
Trend analysis
should be a major
tool in determining
system C/A.

                                      OVERVIEW TO QOP 012
    (PERFORMANCE STANDARD)
QOP 012 is designed to give you a quick review of linkage as to how a process-approach
system integrates assignments to procedures in handling two types of  product categories,
 − conforming and non-conforming products.
Both must be simultaneously dealt with, right through a product’s realization processes.
If we don’t, the conforming product eventually will be shipped, but the non-conforming
product will die on the vine in many cases. Sometimes it will become a quickly fixed
product, without corrective action. We don’t prevent problems this way. We repeat them.
This is not the continual improvement opportunity ISO 9001/2000 has in mind.
Continuous improvement in a process-approach quality management system primarily
takes place by implementing corrective action through process control, hence preventing
problems from flowing down, process to process. It is for a very good reason then, why
we must also control non-conforming products as we do conforming products.
Section One and Two of this QOP communicate the put-through mechanism, first for the
conforming products, second for the non-conforming products. These two procedures
impact directly or indirectly every other Quality Operating Procedure in the quality
system, simply because they effectively handle the two product categories mentioned
above, throughout all the realization processes. They are performance standards, for
every identified process has a performance requirement linked to it, which requires work
result documentation and end result measurement to evaluate achievement in both
category types.
Section Three is a completely different procedure, dealing with developmental projects to
qualify processing methods, and from it, formalizing the project related work instructions
for an ongoing production effort, often required with new customer purchase orders.

     SECTION ONE
          Processing Control
              Job Travelers
  What’s a
 Job
 Traveler?
A Job Traveler is a Process Router, indicating the sequences
of the processing steps as defined by Engineering and
Quality. It also contains the specific work instruction under
each processing step as to what is required to be done. It
gives references, when required, to other controlling docu -
ments such as Operation Sheets or quality procedures, etc.
A Job Traveler is the single most important trace document
for a specified product. Once a processing step has been
completed, it clearly indicates what quantities were accept-
ed or rejected. A Job Traveler controls the product’s in-
spection and test status indication at each defined opera-
tion (number). This document, when all the specified opera-
tions have been completed and the product has been final
inspected and released, is kept by Quality in the Inspection
Product Folder as a permanent record. Without it, there is no
reliable processing accountability, no history to indicate in-
process control of a specified product – the evidence to
DEMONSTRATE compliance.
Who issues
them?
Job Travelers originate from Engineering. After all the
processing sequences and the related work instruction
requirements have been incorporated, Engineering
releases them to Production Planning. Job Travelers can
also be temporarily issued when certain new orders
require the determination of capability and processing
development. What is important to remember is that Job
Travelers are controlled documents. Once they have been
finally released, changes to them require document con-
trol. See QOP 002, Section Two, par. 3.03.1. (pg 73)
Who main-
tains them?
The Job Travelers are maintained by Engineering and
are part of the specified Production Folders, although
they may be released separately depending on urgency
of setup preparation. The preparation and release of
processing related technical work instructions, which
will be contained in the Production Folders, decisively
depend on the complexity of the product itself. There
are times when a Job Traveler will be the sole document
in a Production Folder. And that’s fine as long as it
clearly defines what to do. The retention of Job
Travelers is defined under QOP 002, Section Three.

What about
revision
control?
This area is a bit complicated. Job Travelers have three
different levels of revision indications. The sample under
Form A-008 is specifically marked to indicate this. Follow
the numbers 1, 2, and 3. The different levels are:
1. 
the customer’s part number revision (drawing).
See QOP 001, Section Four. (pg 52)
2. 
the processing related document revision  (Operation
Sheets) as may be shown under each operation number.
(When processing related documents change in any of
the specified operations, this revision number will also
be updated. Otherwise, we may be working to wrong
requirements. (See QOP 002, Section Two, par. 3.03.1
on pg 73)
3. 
the revision control of Form A-008 itself. We may
change the basic template from time to time as we
improve the way we do things. This change is not only
reflected on the form itself but also in the Master List
that controls it. (The Master List is in front of the
Forms Manual in Book Section Four on pg 453)

SUBJECT: Processing Evolution from Beginning to End (Put Through)
QOP 012  DOCUMENT REQ’D:  Form A-008 (Job Traveler), A-001
1.0   PURPOSE
          Standardize work assignments in order to demonstrate the process-approach put
  through system in an actual work environment.
2.0   APPLICATION
  Subject procedure applies to contractually defined products, going through the
  phases of planning, processing, verification, release and delivery to the customer.
3.0   PROCEDURE
  General
  A Job Traveler is that controlled document which defines all the required process
  steps that regulate the movement of a product from the beginning of a process to
  the end of a process in a way that process owners can determine from it, step by
  step, the identification of a product and its related documents, the equipment and
  tooling, the work instruction on what to do and what not to do in order to process
  that product to meet the scheduled work process requirement and ultimately, the
  customer’s requirement, without unnecessary interruptions.
  In order for a Job Traveler to become a useful, valid, and an approved process
  control document for all those who are required to follow it, the issuing authority
  (Process Engineer) must interact with Contracts, Production Planning, Purchasing,
  Manufacturing, and Quality to integrate the processing cycle evolution of the pro-
  duct, equipment, people, and methods. This would have to be done in a manner
  such that not one of the members of the operation’s team would have to wait to
  fulfill its responsibilities to carry out his/her work assignment in the  product’s
  realization processes due to poor planning in the beginning phases of the layout
  processes. After all, the Job Traveler is the road map of the processing cycle, which
  requires continuous input and follow-up by those in charge of it, so that when it is
  released to the traffic (the work realization processes), the people (process owners)
  would not have to be rerouted to take alternate paths to reach their targets (produc-
  tion goals), because somebody failed to do his part to make the road map (Job
  Traveler) an accurately reflected schedule-execute-verify-control driven directive
  (Plan-Do-Check-Act).
  This process-approach quality management system planned the Job Traveler (in-
  cluding Split Travelers) to be  the single most important document to control the
  product’s entire routing requirements in a manner so  as to ensure that accurate di-
  rections are given, in sequential order, to the process owners. This would enable

                                                                                        ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   251

   them to carry out their work assignments so that the product could be processed
   through the cycle the first time in a controlled manner, ensuring that quality is con-
   tinuously built into the product. Of course, to make this a reality, everybody would
   have to be entrusted to take charge of his work assignment in order to help each
   other to work as a team. This brings us then to integrating the work assignments
   within the process-approach system so the above can be realized, ensuring along
   the way that each process owner verifies his/her work results and documents it, as
   required, to prevent transferring mistakes, regardless who made them, from pro-
   cess to process.

SUBJECT: Handling Non-conforming Products (Put Through)
QOP 012  DOCUMENT REQ’D:  Form A-006 (NCMR for MRB action)
   SECTION TWO
1.0 
 PURPOSE
 Integrate the handling and control of non-conformities as part of process control
 during the product’s overall processing cycle.
2.0 
 APPLICATION
 This procedure provides specific instructions on how to handle and control non-
 conformities identified at any point in the processing cycle of the product,
 including customer complaints and product returns.
3.0 
 PROCEDURE
            General
 Since a non-conforming state could contribute to process deficiencies anywhere
 in the processing cycle of a product, timely resolution of the constraint, created
 by it, must be implemented to ensure effective process continuation. A noncon-
 forming state does not only mean hardware in a process-approach system, but it
 also includes errors in documents, in processes, and in the methods. These may
 eventually affect production and product quality. To stop the transfer of deficien-
 cies creeping from process to process, we have implemented the controls to iso-
 late them and cure them when and where they occur. Not every nonconformity
 leads to hardware deficiency and when it doesn’t, we have implemented other
 methods in this process-approach system to cure them. Carefulness must be exer-
 cised therefore between the two distinct varieties − hardware vs. non-hardware −
 for the cost difference in handling is substantial. Applying the NCMR (MRB)
 process is primarily hardware related. It should also be used when no other docu-
 mented procedure exists to handle corrective action. The four main categories in
 which we may discover non-conformities that we must control are:
1. hardware related (handled by the application of the NCMR (MRB)
process);
2. production related documents (handled by the application of Form A-
009);
3. customer related documents (handled through QOP 001, Section Four);
4. documents making up the Quality System manual and the Quality
Operating Procedures (handled by draft revisions).

                                                                                        ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   255

               General Information
Customer-related document changes involve two separately initiated efforts. The
first one is initiated by the customer through the provisions of Purchase Order
Amendments. The second one is initiated internally, due to deficiencies discover-
ed in the customer’s documents. The customer-initiated changes involve extensive
review process, due to cost factors, and therefore they are handled much like a
quotation process (RFQ). It is covered under QOP 001, Section Four, pg 52. The
internally initiated changes involve the application of a “Waiver Request” through
the provisions of QOP 009, Section Two, paragraph 3.01.4.2.1, step 1, under “Re-
pair.” (pg 210)

PURPOSE
            Maintain control over those activities that involve the product’s processing quali-
            fication when there are no documented procedures exist on how to do it, as with
            new customer Purchase Orders.
2.0 
APPLICATION
             This procedure applies to the planning and implementation of qualification pro-
            cesses on new jobs where the capability as to how to do it has not been previously
            documented and demonstrated.
3.0 
PROCEDURE
General Information
Processing qualification of new products is often regarded by many customers as
nothing more than setting up a new job in an otherwise similar production envi-
ronment. While the equipment, tools, and operator’s skill may be the same, the
processing steps and work methods involved could be completely different. This
type of product cannot be regarded as identical to those products for which the
processing capability has already been demonstrated and documented. Under
uncontrolled conditions, the entire order could become scrap. A process-approach
quality management system must provide the procedural mechanism under which
the processing qualification can be orderly carried out and the product released to
the customer according to his/her PO requirement. Since we have already pro-
vided controlling procedures for First Article Production Approval (ESA)
under QOP 006, Section Two, we will be applying certain provisions of the
same (text) procedures to implement basic requirements for the processing
qualification of new jobs. The applicable steps are marked with a star “  .”
(see pg 368)

the qualification steps on new jobs, which procedures
when formalized would become the standard work
instruction for process owners.

 BOOK SECTION TWO
    OVERVIEW TO THE QUALITY SYSTEM MANUAL
Seven years ago as I was writing the first edition of this Process-Approach Quality Sys-
tem Manual for manufacturing shops, I was searching for a “conveyor” (the flow process
mechanism) which would identify the quality requirements suitable for shop operations. I
wanted the quality requirements to represent the true nature of how a manufactured
product was put through the various stages from planning through product completion
and delivery to the customer. What I was looking for was a process approach that would
tie the various departmental activities into a structured dependency so that everybody
would be focused in one direction to bring about managing their work processes in line
with commitments to product quality in a product’s flow cycle. I was looking for
something that did not exist. I gave up the search and settled down instead to find only
the quality requirements. As I was mulling over the 1987 edition of ISO 9000, I
recognized that it had already identified for me the core departmental requirements that I
needed, less the linkage to a process-approach system. I decided that I would follow the
layout mechanism of the Standard and develop to it, separately, the process-approach
procedures. In this second edition, I have retained the quality requirements of the same
Standard (ISO 9001/1994) for controlling product quality in shop operations because the
need exists for them, and because they represent reality.
Change in layout in the upcoming year 2000 Standard will not remove this reality. The
Standard will shift the requirements around and add more to them so that nobody can
recognize them anymore as a manufacturing quality standard. The upcoming changes in
ISO 9001/2000 will not affect this process-approach system, because I have already in-
corporated them as good business practice in manufacturing. Appendix One at the end of
the book explains the alignment, while the operating procedures have implemented them.
Appendix Five, on the other hand, identifies the changes and demonstrates how the
implementation occurred. The encircled numbers that appear next to the clause titles in
this quality manual are corresponding to the clause number requirements of ISO
9001/2000.

quirements for organizational commitment to product quality, customer satisfaction,
and continuous improvement. These commitments are summarized in this manual and
communicated in written procedures to the members of the organization in a manner
that the contracted product is systematically controlled from process to process in the
product’s life cycle and accordingly manufactured within regulatory and statutory re-
quirements. Management’s goals are to achieve the prevention of non-conformities in
document maintenance, in process attainment, and in product realization. Manage-
ment shall require from process owners demonstration of work results through docu-
mentation to enable the organization to measure satisfactory compliance to the stated
product specifications and related work instructions in order to achieve its objectives.
1.1     MISSION

            and continuous improvement to the requirements of this quality system manual and in
            association with the requirements of  ISO 9001/2000.
1.2     OBJECTIVES
Plan interrelated processes and communicate them to affected parties. Carry out as-
            signments to meet the planned requirements. Document the work results and measure
            performance, as required. Implement corrective/preventive action, as required. Re-
            view overall effectiveness to consistently achieve product quality, customer satisfac-
            tion, and continuous improvement. Set new objectives in line with business goals.

4.2.1      General
This Quality System Manual outlines the requirements of ISO 9001/2000 as to how
the product quality objectives are identified, documented, and maintained in line
with organizational commitments, including permissible exclusions. The Manual
references the QOPs, which outline the specific process instructions relating to
specified tasks, sequences and interactions. In certain cases, the Manual itself states
the applicable process instructions. Work results are recorded on specified forms,
identified, controlled, and retained according to documented procedures. Taken
together, the Quality System Manual, the Quality Operating Procedures, and the
Forms comprise the documented system through which the criteria and methods
are implemented and maintained to ensure effective operation and control. They
are controlled documents. Through these efforts, the requirements for product
quality, customer satisfaction, and continuous improvement have been communi-
cated at appropriate levels and functions within the organization.
4.2.2 
Quality system procedures
Identified process instructions shall serve as procedures to ensure the effective and
consistent operation of the process-approach quality management system. These
process instructions have been systematically documented in twelve Quality Oper-
ating Procedures (QOP) and issued and controlled to enforce the process-approach

CONTROL OF NON-CONFORMING PRODUCT
4.13.1 
General
In a process-approach quality management system, non-conforming product is
more than just hardware. Any error in documents or processes that impacts pro-
duct quality, or the methods and processes that may affect or create a bottleneck
to achieve product quality is also called non-conforming product. Therefore, man-
aging non-conforming products in all the areas of core departmental functions is
as important as managing conforming products. Documented procedures, there-
fore, have been so integrated that a total quality management of the non-conform-
ing products becomes cohesively a de facto operation within the quality manage-
ment system to provide for continual improvement to enable the organization to
attain its management objectives. The controlling provisions to handle the various
types of non-conformance are detailed in QOP 009 (pg 199 or 403).
AS9000 Notes 1 and 2, regarding notification of non-conformance and non-con-
forming customer returns, have been incorporated in QOP 009 as a routinely re-
quired quality management objective.
4.13.2 
Review and disposition of non-conforming product
The responsibility and authority to evaluate and disposition non-conforming
products is defined in detail in QOP 009, Sections One, Two, and Three.
Documented procedures give direction on how to control the various types of
dispositions (rework, repair, accept, regrade, scrap, etc., see pg 210 or 412).
4.13.2.1 AS9000  Material Review Authority:
Notwithstanding the requirements of 4.13.2, the supplier shall not use dis-
positions of use-as-is or repair, unless specifically authorized by the custom-
er, if (1) the product is produced to customer design, or (2) the nonconformi-
ty results in a departure from the contract requirements.
This provision is incorporated in QOP 009, Section Two, paragraph 3.01.4.2 and
3.01.4.3 (pg 210 or 412).
4.13.2.2 AS9000  Regrading Material:
Product dispositioned for regrade requires a change in product identification
to preclude the product’s original use. Adequate test reports and certifica-
tions shall reflect the regrading. This provision is incorporated in QOP 009,
Section Two, paragraph 3.01.4.7, step 2 (pg 214 or 415).

a) Customer complaints, reports, and product returns are handled in accordance
with QOP 009, Section Three (pg 217 or 417);
b) Cause determination of non-conformities in product, process, or the quality
system is dependent on the type of non-conformance reported as required
under the provisions of QOP 009, Section One. Documentation of the cause(s)
of non-conformity is handled through the application of Form A-006 in ac-
cordance with QOP 009, Section Two, paragraph 3.01.2 (pg 208 or 410).
c) The MRB authority is responsible for determining corrective/preventive
action as part of the disposition process stated under QOP 009, Section Two,

In a process-approach quality management system, the documented procedures
dealing with defining processing related activities must put emphasis on preven-
tive quality such as product handling and preservation requirements. By providing
adequate instructions for these efforts along with other subjective requirements
(workmanship), the final product will be made ready for packaging and delivery
to customers or to storage at the end of final inspection, without additional and
separate work instruction procedures and process loading requirements. QOP 001,
Section Two, paragraph 3.03, steps 2 and 3 (pg 48 or 302) incorporate this
requirement for the Process Engineer to do at the time when he/she develops the
product’s processing requirement procedures. At Final Inspection, the Quality
Inspector is required to verify and document the results of these activities prior to
releasing the product for delivery to the customer or to storage. (See QOP 006,
Section Four, paragraphs 3.02 and 3.03, pg 163 or 381)
4.15.2 
Handling
Throughout the entire processing cycle from the receipt of products through
production and delivery, the Job Traveler and/or Operation Sheet is providing
instructions for product handling.
4.15.3     Storage
Contract related raw materials or the finished goods are stored either in temporary
holding areas or in other suitable places to enforce control over them. The raw
materials are tagged with Form A-027. The finished goods are tagged with Form
A-013. These tags indicate inspection approval to receive or release the product
for further processing in accordance with instructions stated in the Job Traveler.
Product preservation shall be a planned requirement as stated in QOP 001, Sec-
tion Two, paragraph 3.03, step 2 (pg 48 or 302).
Non-conforming or unidentified products are not permitted to be stored together
with conforming products, as appropriate.

Semi-finished or in-process related products may be held or stored anywhere,
provided that the Job Traveler and/or the process related documents are together
with the product. Indication of the last inspection status is mandatory.
Shelf-life controlled products (chemical compounds, surfactants, etc.) are
controlled according to EPA regulations as defined in the EPA standards.
4.15.4     Packaging
Packaging of products for delivery to subcontractors (Suppliers) and for shipment
to customers is maintained to best commercial practice or as otherwise stated in
the contract (PO) and/or Form A-001 (Purchase Order Review Sheet).
4.15.5     Preservation
      Preservation methods are defined as required in the Job Traveler and/or Operation
                  Sheet in accordance with QOP 001, Section Two, paragraph 3.03, step 2, as re-
                  quired.
                  Mixing of different products or different part numbers in accomplishing the pre-
                  servation process is not allowed unless the segregation process is also defined in
                  the Job Traveler and/or Operation Sheet.
                  All foreign objects (chips, shredding, dirt, oil, etc.) shall be eliminated from the
                  finished products according to the work instructions stated in the Job Traveler
                  and/or Operation Sheet, as required.(AS9000 paragraph 4.9j above)
4.15.6     Delivery
     Product delivery is carried out in accordance with QOP 006, Section Four, para-
graph 3.03. When it is a contractual requirement, the protection of the quality of
the product during delivery to destination shall be complied with.
4.16 
CONTROL OF QUALITY RECORDS
Control of the quality documents and records from contract activities through the
delivery of the product is maintained in accordance with documented procedures
as stated in QOP 002, Sections One, Two, and Three (pg 60 or 311). Additionally,
each QOP has specific instruction as to the control of process related records.
4.16.1

INTERNAL QUALITY AUDITS
Internal quality audits are planned, carried out, and documented in accordance
with the procedures stated in QOP 010. Accordingly, when required by assess-
ment, corrective action and follow-up are implemented with those responsible in
order to maintain the effective operation of the Quality Management System. In
addition, process control surveillance is also implemented in accordance with
QOP 006, Section Three (pg 151 or 374), to effect timely isolation and corrective
action of process related non-conformance. Through the analysis of data and
communication of the audit results, upper management determines the state of the
quality system and initiates additional improvement, as required. Corrective/
preventive action is implemented in accordance with the provisions of QOP 010,
paragraph 3.03.3 (pg 231 or 426).
4.18 
TRAINING
This process-approach quality management system considers the training of all
employees to be the most important tool in understanding (awareness) and main-
taining product quality objectives in all areas of work activities. Accordingly,
management has developed and implemented documented procedures to maintain
effective training and the evaluation of it in line with individual needs. For each
Quality Operating Procedure, there is a corresponding Training Metrics instituted
for training purposes and is administered by the Management Representative. Re-
cords of training activities are maintained on Form A-016 (pg 471), and the eval-
uation of training results is maintained on form A-039 (pg 498).

STATISTICAL TECHNIQUES
4.20.1 
Identification of need
Standard control charts (uncontrolled forms) on which to record variable or at-
tribute data are used in the production areas, as required, to determine process
variations. Sampling plans (Mil-Std-105 and/or ANSI Z1.4-1993) are applied in
accordance with the contract provisions. Other statistical tools such as Pareto
Chart, Cause-and-Effect Diagrams, Tree Diagrams, Failure Mode Effect Analysis
(FMEA), etc., are also used as required by customers, or as determined by the
Management Representative.

4.20.2 
Procedure
The Quality Engineer determines during Purchase Order review the contractual
need for Statistical Process Control Charts and identifies this requirement on
Form A-001 (Purchase Order Review Sheet). The Process Engineer picks up this
information from Form A-001 (see QOP 001, Section Two, paragraph 3.02) and
enters the requirement in the Job Traveler. The process owner follows the noted
information in the Job Traveler and picks up the control charts from the Quality
Department. He/she enters the measurement data on the control chart and mon-
itors the work result data between the upper and lower level tolerance boundaries
and adjusts the equipment when the trend becomes unfavorable. The control chart
becomes part of the Inspection Product Folder and may be submitted to the cus-
tomer with other inspection data at time of product delivery.
The Management Representative may apply any statistical tools as part of his/her
responsibility in determining root causes of problems in the process of imple-
menting corrective actions to maintain continual improvements.
Inspection personnel may use sampling statistics regularly when permitted by the
quality provisions of the contract (PO). (AS9000, par. 4.20.3 apply, as required)
4.20.3 
AS9000  Sampling Inspection:
When the supplier uses sampling inspection as a means of product accept-
ance, the plan shall be statistically valid and appropriate for use. The plan
shall preclude the acceptance of known defectives in the lot. This requirement
is incorporated as a standard operating procedure.

QUALITY OPERATING PROCEDURES
     PROCEDURES MANUAL
   
        OVERVIEW TO THE PROCEDURES MANUAL
The Quality Operating Procedures (QOPs) are stand-alone documents under their indivi-
dual number, embodying one or more sections. These sections are known as quality
objective procedures. Each QOP is designed to include specific process instructions and
performance procedures relating to the type of requirement it needs to control. Some of
the QOPs contain several interrelated requirements. These requirements are divided into
dedicated sections within the QOP. Example: QOP 006 has seven sections. Each section
is defining a specific type of inspection requirement, the quality objective requirement.
QOP 009 has three sections. Each section defines how to control non-conforming
products and interrelated matters. QOP 002 has also three sections, and each section
defines how to control the system’s documents. Other QOPs define how to control a
single requirement, and for procedural reasons, they couldn’t be combined with any other
QOP. ‘Stand-alone’ means that each QOP has its own control mechanism (page plate) to
take care of its own revision, page number, approval, and other internal requirements.
The control mechanism is uniformly applied to all the twelve operating procedures.
Collectively, these Quality Operating Procedures are also controlled through a Master
List in order to maintain the ‘Procedures Manual.’ The ‘Master List’ is located two pages
behind this page. These procedures collectively control all the process and quality
requirements needed to maintain an effective process-approach system in a
manufacturing shop environment. From the beginning to the end each procedure
maintains process flow in line as to how assignments are carried out in a real work
environment. Only experience is needed to carry out each identified assignment in order
to effectively fulfill each requirement. The method of how each assignment is carried out
is dependent on the experience level of the process owner. That is why these procedures
are universally suitable in a manufacturing work environment with only a few employees.
For each procedure there is an equivalent Training Metrics provided to better understand
product quality requirements. This explains the fact that in a small shop environment
several processes may be performed by one individual. While it is performed, he/she
bears the job title and the responsibility for that process assignment.
Note that page numbers have been added next to the references in order to facilitate easy
navigation between documents.

 OVERVIEW TO QOP 001
                         (CONTRACT REVIEW)
Fulfilling customer satisfaction starts at the earliest phase when we establish a
relationship with our customers. Most of us don’t realize this fact until later when we find
out that the customer’s product specification often is riddled with mistakes. The customer
doesn’t pay for downtime that you incur as a result of these mistakes. A process-approach
quality management system starts right here, ensuring that you work with the customer
up front, at the quoting phase of the job, so that you don’t quote a job with all its mistakes
already in it. Section One of this QOP deals with the quotation process, the RFQ.
Section Two of this QOP deals with controlling the Purchase Order Review, giving you a
second opportunity to make sure that you take care of those mistakes that either you or
the customer may have made between the time the RFQ was reviewed and the Purchase
Order issued. Although many times Quality is not part of the job quoting process, this
time it takes a serious review of the issued Purchase Order. At this time Quality
determines what is really needed to make sure that product quality verification is planned
for during the entire build cycle of the product and that everybody becomes aware of it up
front so that they also can plan for it.  As at this time Quality summarizes these require-
ments and issues them on Form A-001. Now preventive quality starts rolling into the
processing documents issued by Engineering.
Section Three controls how verbal agreements should be handled in order that we avoid
confrontation with the customer later over what was said versus what should have been
said. Again, preventive quality plays a major role here to avoid problems later.
Section Four takes care of those issues that have everything to do with customer initiated
document changes. It tells you how to control and implement them in order that customer
satisfaction is maintained for both the organization and the buyer.

SECTION TWO
  1.0  PURPOSE
          Ensure that the Purchase Order content information agrees with that of the
          tender and to determine and document quality requirements imposed in the PO.
  2.0  APPLICATION
           The purchase order requirements shall apply to all activities affecting documents
           and processes, during the entire processing cycle of the identified product.
  3.0  PROCEDURE
  3.01  The Administrative Secretary shall: On receipt of  PO:
1. Log in the receipt of the PO on form A-005.
2. Review the content information and determine its accuracy against the tender.
(The “tender” is the formal response sent to the customer earlier and is located
in the RFQ folder.)
a) If the content information of the PO agrees with that of the tender, accept it
by stamping on it “Accepted.” Then, sign and date it.
b) If it doesn’t agree with the tender, have the Contract Administrator resolve
the differences with the customer. When that’s done, accept the PO as in
“a” above. Then, do the following:
3. Make up the PO folder. Put the customer’s name and PO number on it.
4. Fill out form A-011 (Control of Customer Documents). Record on this form
the customer sent document numbers and their revision levels. When that’s
done, attach it to the inside of the front cover of the PO folder.
5. Make copies of the PO and its attachment(s) now, as required.
a) Send a copy to Engineering, Planning, and Quality.
b) Send other copies as required. Then:
6. Fill out form A-031 (Issue and Traceability of Drawings). Record on this form
the part number and revision level of the documents that you have distributed
(new) and retrieved (obsolete). Dispose of the obsolete documents, as required.
Stamp “Obsolete” on those retained.

the controlling requirements for an effective product quality realization for the
contracted product.
3.03    The Process Engineer shall:
1. Review the PO and related technical documents received from Contracts.
Review also form A-001, received from Quality.
2. Plan the processing layout to meet the PO requirements. The quality
requirements recorded on form A-001 are part of the processing layout, as
stated. So are workmanship, handling, cleaning and preservation, and safety.
If this order is new and you don’t have the process capability developed for it,
determine the need for process qualification and do it as defined under QOP
012, Section Three (Developmental Process, pg 449).
3. Prepare, review, and approve all the required documents needed for product
realization. (Job Traveler, Operation Sheets, Software Program, etc.)
           4.   Maintain master documents in Engineering Folder(s).

QUALITY OPERATING PROCEDURE 002   311
OVERVIEW TO QOP 002
      (CONTROL OF DOCUMENT AND DATA)
The control of documents and data is the prerequisite required to manage an effective quality
system. Without it, you have no system. This QOP 002 has three sections in order to ensure that
we manage the documents and data in line with a process-approach quality management
system. We give you instructions on how to design and control the documents, comprising the
quality system’s procedures. We give you instructions on how to carry out revisions, how to
identify documents and how to retain them. In fact, this process-approach system is exactly
constructed, implemented, and maintained the way it tells you how you should do yours. What
is really good here is that whatever you need to know regarding document and data control is in
one procedure. Other QOPs often refer you here to do your thing according to the stated re-
quirements laid out for you.
There are so many steps involved here that I could easily write pages to tell you about them,
but I won’t. Rather, I’ll do it where it counts − inside the procedure. This QOP is one of the
longest procedures, along with QOP 006 (inspection control, pg 357) and QOP 009 (non-
conformance control, pg 403), to make sure that the documented system is effectively laid out,
inter-linked, coordinated, and maintained for all the quality system’s documents in the process-
approach system.

SECTION TWO
1.0 
PURPOSE
To maintain control over document and data changes.
2.0 
APPLICATION
The control over document and data changes shall apply to all the identified documents
of the quality management system.
3.0 
PROCEDURE
General Requirement
Errors, mistakes, and misleading instructions in documents are adversely affecting per-
formance, processing efficiency, and product quality. Therefore, this process-approach
system provides the tools to remove them when and where they occur. Process owners
in all departments are required to report them to their immediate supervisors as soon as
they discover them. The supervisors in turn are required to determine what immediate
impact they have on the ongoing process, foremost on product quality, and take the
necessary steps to eliminate them. QOP 012 (the Performance Standard), Section Two,
paragraph 3.04 (pg 445) gives the required guidance as to how to go about curing these
document deficiencies.
3.01     Customer Controlled Documents
            Changes to customer controlled documents and data shall be approved and released
            only by the customer(s) through the issuance of amendment(s) against the already
            placed Purchase Order(s). Internal implementation of Purchase Order amendments shall
            be carried out as defined in QOP 001, Section Four (pg 307) and in this procedure.
Note 1. Implementation of customer initiated verbal changes into the processing opera-
                         tions shall be prohibited without procedural documentation as stated above.
3.02 
Internally Controlled Processing Related Documents
Changes to processing related documents and data shall be carried out by the applica -
tion of form A-009 (pg 464) as stated below under paragraph 3.03.1 and 3.03.2 “Imple-
mentation.” These changes may or may not impact the quality system’s procedures.
(See paragraph 4.0 below.) When they do, they are known as indirect changes.

3.03.1  Immediate and Provisional Changes (Needed to allow uninterrupted processing.)
Implementation: (Obtain form A-009 from page 464 in order to understand the process.)
1. The Process Engineer fills out the upper portion of form A-009, then fills out items
1, 2, and 3 and submits it to the supervisor for review. The supervisor reviews the
      change. Signs and dates “Reviewed By.” Now, the Process Engineer forwards this
      document to the Quality Engineer;
2. The Quality Engineer reviews the proposed change(s). Upon concurrence, he/she
signs and dates “Accepted By.” If the proposed change is unsatisfactory, he/she
sends it back to the Process Engineer for correction. Processes in item “1” shall be
repeated;
3. After the correction has been made, reviewed, and accepted, the Quality and the
Process Engineers execute the immediate change(s) in the processing related
document(s) on the processing floor.
      The following steps shall be carried out:
✿ 
cross out the current data in the applicable document(s);
✿ 
write above it the new data as described in A-009;
✿ 
both, sign and date the provisional change in the document(s).
            Note 2. This change will be valid until the next production lot is scheduled, or as
                         otherwise determined.
4. The Process Engineer now changes the master document(s), including revision
      level(s). Submits the revised document(s) for review and approval to supervision.
      After approval, he/she makes as many copies of the revised master document(s) as
      needed for distribution. Returns the masters to the Engineering file. Then:
✿ 
attaches one copy of the master document(s) to A-009 and turns these over to
the Quality Engineer;
✿ 
distributes the rest of the copies to all the affected departments;
✿ 
removes the obsolete document(s) at the same time and disposes them, as
required;
✿ 
then, updates the Production Folder(s);
✿ 
maintains both the Engineering and Production Folders, as required.
Note 3. Obsolete document(s) shall be stamped “Obsolete” and retained for background
              information, as required.
5. The Quality Engineer now takes the documents sent by the Process Engineer.
He/she determines the impact caused by this revision to the quality system’s
documents. Then, completes items 4 and 5 on form A-009. If there is no impact,
he/she checks off “N/A” in item 8. Signs and dates the document and files A-009
together with the revised document(s) in the “Document Change Folder.” On the
other hand, if there is impact, he/she lists the impacted documents under item 6 on
A-009 and does the following:

✿ 
turns over to the Management Representative all the documents ( A-009, the
document(s) revised by Engineering, and the highlighted copies of the quality
documents).
6. The Management Representative obtains the processing related document package
from the Quality Engineer and carries out his/her responsibility as stated in para-
graph 4.01 below.
3.03.2    Standard and NCMR Processing Related Document Changes
3.03.2.1  Standard Document Changes
   General
   Standard document changes are routine changes without having immediate impact on
               the current processing requirements. They shall be implemented in accordance with
               production scheduling, established by the customer’s Purchase Order delivery require-
               ment.
   Implementation:
1. All the provisions stated above in paragraph 3.03.1, except item 3, shall be carried
      out when incorporating standard changes to the processing related document(s);
2. Implementation takes effect with the next processing cycle, or as determined by
      the customer’s Purchase Order.
3.03.2.2 NCMR Affected Changes
   General
When non-conforming products are dispositioned, changes to processing and/or
quality documents may be imposed through corrective action, depending on the cause
of the problem. The corrective action may require either an immediate or standard
document change.
    Implementation:
1. When the corrective action requires an immediate change to the processing docu -
ments, all the provisions stated in paragraph 3.03.1 above shall be carried out;
2. When the corrective action requires a standard change to documents, all the
      provisions stated in paragraph 3.03.1, except item 3, shall be carried out;

3.03.2.3  Software Changes
               Implementation
               Software programs are controlled as documents. Changes to these documents shall be
               accomplished in accordance with the requirements stated under paragraphs 3.03.1
and 3.03.2 above and as stated in QOP 001, Section Four (Amendment to Contract, pg
307).
Exception applies:
Developmental projects shall be exempted from the provisions of paragraphs 3.03.1
and 3.03.2 until product development has been accomplished. (See QOP 012, Section
Three on page 449)
Note 4. Document changes should promote improvement to the operating system’s
             effectiveness and efficiency. Cost and customer satisfaction should be
             evaluated.
4.0     Change Control of the Quality System’s Documents
General
The processing related documents (Job Travelers, Operation Sheets, Software
Programs, and other setup-related documents) have their changes accomplished through
the application of form A-009. The quality system documents, however, have their
changes carried out directly within their own structural system when not impacted by
change requirements in form A-009. Processing related document changes may or may
not trigger off changes to the quality system’s documents. When they do, they will
indirectly impact the quality system’s procedures. Therefore, when direct changes are
required to the quality system’s documents, form A-009 shall not be processed. Rather,
the direct change method shall be carried out through the process of draft changes in the
copies of the impacted master document(s). (See paragraph 4.02 below on page 322)
Note 5. Changes made in the text of the quality system’s documents after original issue
shall be highlighted. (italicized or “bold”)
Note 6. Typing and syntax errors in the masters can be corrected without formal change
control only if they don’t impact product quality and/or processing. The
Management Representative shall control these types of corrections, including
the uniform distribution of the revised documents along with the retraction of
obsolete documents.

Note 7. The quality system’s forms are part of the quality operating procedures by
reference. They have not been attached to the quality operating procedures for
reasons of practical handling and control. When making changes to the
procedures, ensure that any change due to flow-down requirement has been
incorporated.
4.01     Indirect Change(s) to the Quality System’s Documents
4.01.1 Procedure to Implement Indirect Changes
The Management Representative shall:
1. Review the documents submitted by the Quality Engineer and research the validity
of the change. Based on research results, he/she evaluates the overall impact of this
change to the quality operating system, including performance, customer
satisfaction, and flow-down requirements. Then, makes decision whether to put it on
hold and determine other measures, reject it for the time being, or implement it.
He/she records this decision with justification onto form A-009 under “Notes.”
Then:
2. In case of “hold”, he/she finds alternate solution(s), which would not require
revision to the manual or to the operating procedures (QOPs), and implements it.
3. In case of “rejection,” he/she signs and dates A-009 and files it together with the
attachment(s) in the “Document Change Folder” and waits for recurring symptoms
to reopen it.
4. In case of “implementation,” he/she takes the already highlighted documents,
crosses out the current text and writes above it the required new text. Then:
5. Takes care of the flow-down requirements, if required. In this effort, he/she takes
the impacted master document(s) and makes copies. Marks the copies by crossing
out the current text and writing above it the required new text. These will become
the draft-change copies. Hold the masters and drafts at hand.
6. Evaluate the impact this change has on performance, customer satisfaction, and
implementation. Plan accordingly, and set up training for the affected personnel
before formalizing and implementing the change(s). After training:
7. Takes all the impacted master documents and updates them according to the draft
changes (remove old data, insert new data) and highlights the new data in the
master(s) - (italicize or “bold”). Then, completes A-009, item 7, and signs and dates
it. (Keep A-009 together with the draft-change documents as they will be needed
under paragraph 5.0 below.)
8. Now, carries out the revision indication changes in all the affected documents as
stated under paragraph 5.0 below before distribution.

9. After the revision indication changes, prepares to distribute the revised documents.
Does this in the following manner:
a) If the quality manual and/or the quality operating procedures are impacted, make
the in-shop distribution of the revised documents and retraction of the obsolete
documents at the same time according to the document owners listed on form
A-010 (pg 465).
                  For the manual:
✿ 
Replace the obsolete manuals with the revised manuals. Dispose of the obsolete
manuals, as required. (Don’t forget to recall and replace the quality manuals
issued to customers, as required (controlled vs. uncontrolled)).
For the operating procedures:
✿ 
Replace the obsolete quality operating procedures and the master list and its
revision history page in the “Procedures Manual” for each owner. Dispose of the
collected obsolete quality operating procedures, the master lists and their revi-
sion history pages, as required.
b) When the forms are impacted, remove the obsolete forms and replace them with
the revised forms from all the shop files, as required. Do the same in the
master’s file. Remember to place the forms’ “Master List” and its “Revision
History” page in front of the pile. Dispose of obsolete forms, as required.
4.02 
Direct Changes to the Quality System’s Documents
General
Direct changes to the quality system’s documents may become necessary as a result of
system audits, performance evaluations, statistical analysis in MRB activities, policy
change due to customer requirements, changes in goals and objectives for future
business, implementation of sector specific standards, updating changes due to revisions
in the applicable standards, management reviews, and others. The driving forces behind
implementing changes to the quality system’s documents should be targeted to achieve
improvements to the overall operating system in line with business objectives. The
Management Representative is responsible for implementing changes to the quality
system’s documents.
4.02.1 Procedure to Implement Direct Changes

1. Consolidate supporting materials to justify the change. Determine requirement.
 Identify which document is affected and make a copy of the master(s). When done,
 return the master(s) to original file.
2. Now, take the copies and determine where they belong. Is it the quality manual, or
a quality operating procedure, or a form, or all three? Conduct a thorough evalua -
tion regarding flow-down requirements. Start this process with the quality manual,
then the operating procedures, and the forms. Observe references in the chain of
events as stated in the manual, carried over to the operating procedures and from
      there to the forms. Establish linkage within the procedural system. Keep a note
      where things are in order to be able to pinpoint linkage to flow-down requirement.
3. After flow-down has been identified, make a copy of each page of the master
document affected by the flow-down impact. Now, take all the copies and mark the
change(s). Cross out the text needed to be changed and write above it the required
new text.
4. Evaluate the impact this change has on performance, customer satisfaction, and
implementation. Plan accordingly, and set up training for the affected personnel
before formalizing and implementing the change(s).
5. While training is going on, take the master documents impacted by the draft
changes. Delete in them the impacted data and type in the required new data as it
appears in the draft-change document(s). Highlight the new data, as required -
(italicize or make it “bold”). Now, go to paragraph 5.0 below and carry out the
revision indication changes in the affected documents before distribution.
6. By the time training is over, prepare to distribute the revised documents. Do this in
the following manner:
a) If the quality manual and/or the quality operating procedures are impacted,
      make the in-shop distribution of the revised documents and retraction of the
        obsolete documents at the same time according to the document owners listed
      on form A-010 (pg 465).
                   For the manual:
✿ 
 Replace the obsolete manuals with the revised manuals. Dispose of the
obsolete manuals, as required. (Don’t forget to recall and replace the quality
manuals issued to customers, as required (controlled vs. uncontrolled)).
 For the operating procedures:
✿ 
Replace the obsolete quality operating procedures and the master list and its
revision history page in the “Procedures Manual” for each owner. Dispose of
the collected obsolete quality operating procedures, the master lists and their
revision history pages, as required.

Revision Indication Control of the Quality System’s Documents
General
The quality system’s documents are grouped in three separately controlled entities: the
            quality manual, the quality operating procedures, and the forms. Each entity has built-
            in mechanism to take care of revision indication changes. The quality manual has its
            own “Revision History” page, located at the beginning pages in the manual (pg 271).
            The quality operating procedures have two different “Revision History” pages, one to
            control the revision of each quality operating procedure and the second one to control
            all of them together. This second one is attached to the “Master List” (pg 294) which
            controls all the procedures as a “Procedures Manual.” The forms are controlled through
            a different “Master List” and its related “Revision History” page. (All are located in
            front of the respective group.)
            Note 9.    Revision indication changes must be carried out whether the quality system’s
                            documents have been impacted by indirect changes (through the application
                            of form A-009), or by direct changes (through the application of draft
                            changes).
            Note 10. The Management Representative will have to determine which entity out of
                            the three has to be updated for the revision indication changes.
5.01 
Revision Indication Change to the Quality System Manual
The text changes in the master manual have now been updated from the draft changes.
            Before the distribution of the revised manual can take place, the revision indication in
            the manual’s “Revision History” page and then on every page of the manual must be
            done. This shall be accomplished as stated hereunder:
The Management Representative shall:
1. Make a copy of the “Revision History” page of the master manual and start the
change process in the page header. Cross out the current revision date and number
and write above the effective date and number. Next, go to the recording section and

this time also the manual’s “Revision History” page. Adjust page numbers, as
required. (Don’t forget to realign the “Contents” page numbers, as required.) Then:
3. Make as many copies of the master manual as needed in line with the “Document
      Issuance Control,” form A-010, which lists the manuals’ numbers and owners.
      Organize the pages of each manual in sequential order and bind them into individual
      manuals. Number each manual as they are listed on form A-010. Then, do the distri-
      bution of the manuals as stated in paragraph 4.02.1, item 6a, above, on page 323, for
      the directly impacted changes, or paragraph  4.01.1, item 9a, above, on page 322,
      for the indirectly impacted changes.
4. When finished, put all the draft-change copies in sequential order and file them as
one interrelated package in the “Document Change Folder.” Then, file the masters
in their original folder(s). Maintain file control.
5.02 
Revision Indication Change to the Quality Operating Procedures
            The text changes in the master pages of the impacted quality operating procedure have
            now been updated from the draft changes. Before the distribution of the revised quality
            operating procedure can take place, the revision and change indication in the “Revision
            History” page must be done. Then, on every page of the procedure, the revision indica-
            tion and date must be updated. In addition to this, the “Master List” and its “Revision
            History” page must also be updated. This shall be accomplished as stated hereunder:
The Management Representative shall:
1. Make a copy of the “Revision History” page from the master of the affected Quality
Operating Procedure and start the change process in the page header. Cross out the
current revision date and number and write above the effective date and number.
2. If other data requires change, do the same thing. Next, go to the recording section
and write in the required information under each column’s description.
This page will be the draft copy.
3. Now, take the master procedure and formally change the revision date and number
in the header on every page according to the draft changes done in “1” above.
Update at this time also the procedure’s “Revision History” page. Adjust page
numbers, as required. (Don’t forget to realign the “Contents” page numbers, as
required.) Then:

the listing section and cross out there the current “revision, date, and status”
indications and write above the effective revision and date as it appears in the
already marked “Revision History” copy of the affected operating procedure (done
under step 1, above). Indicate “Revised” under the “status” column. These two
pages, the “Revision History” copy under step 4 and the “Master List” copy under
this step, will be the draft copies.
6. Now, take the masters of the “Master List” and its “Revision History” page and
      formally change them according to the marked data in the draft-change copies.
7. Then, take all the masters − the formally revised Quality Operating Procedure, the
Master List and its Revision History page − and make as many copies as needed in
line with the “Document Issuance Control” form A-010, which list the manuals’
numbers and owners. Organize the pages of each operating procedure in sequential
      order. (Punch the holes if required.) Then, do the distribution (insertion into the
      “Procedures Manual”) of the Quality Operating Procedure, the Master List and its
      Revision History page as stated in paragraph 4.02.1, item 6a, above, on page 323,
      for the directly impacted changes, or paragraph  4.01.1, item 9a, above, on page
      322, for the indirectly impacted changes.
8. When finished, put all the draft-change copies in sequential order and file them in
the “Document Change Folder” as one interrelated package. Then, file the masters
in their original folder(s). Maintain file control.
5.03     Revision Indication Change to the Quality System’s Forms

6.0     Handling Non-conforming Product(s) Resulting from Document Changes
General
Document change(s) may cause a contracted product to become non-conforming at any
stage in the processing cycle. It could also impact the already delivered product. Non-
conforming product(s), resulting from “Amendment to Contract,” may trigger off trace-
ability requirement as well. Processing related non-conforming product(s) may require
notification to the customer, via the “Waiver” process, in order to determine disposition,
may also impact the already delivered product(s). All phases in controlling nonconform-
ing product(s), resulting from document changes, should be carried out as stated in
Quality Operating Procedure 009, Section One (pg 408) and Two (pg 410).
6.01 
Implementation
The Quality Engineer shall:
1.  Identify and tag the non-conforming product through the application of form A-012
     (Rejected Material Ticket) and separate it, as practical.
2.  Process completely form A-006 (Non-conforming Material Report) in accordance
                 with QOP 009, Section One and Two.
3.  Follow up all the requirements stated in QOP 009, Sec Two (pg 410) as applicable,
                 until the non-conformance has been eliminated and the product disposed of.
Note 11.  When document changes are imposed as a result of Corrective Action through
                             the disposition process of an NCMR, the non-conforming product(s) should
                             be handled on the same NCMR. (see paragraph 3.03.2.2, above, on page 319)

SECTION THREE
1.0 
PURPOSE
Summarize the retention, maintenance, and responsibility in managing the Quality
System’s records.
2.0 
APPLICATION
The hereunder written procedure shall apply to all the identified and documented
records within the Quality System.
3.0 
PROCEDURE
General
The quality system’s effectiveness is demonstrated through the control of its records
which serve as evidence to prove product conformance or non-conformance to the
specified requirements within the established and implemented system. (see Summary
of Forms,  shown on the Master List, page 453)
Since record keeping is evidenced through the application of the various forms, the
various departments within the organization shall be responsible for managing them in
accordance with procedural requirements as described in the applicable QOPs.
From time to time, subject records shall be made readily available for review by the
customer or regulatory agencies. (see QSM and SAE AS9000 paragraph 4.16.1)
To prove the effective operation of the quality system, subject records shall be period-
ically audited in accordance with documented procedures (QOP 010, pg 421). Obsolete
documents shall be retrieved from all affected areas. Their retention shall be determined
according to need and those that are retained shall be stamped “Obsolete.”
The quality system’s records demonstrate the documentation of work results, recorded
by those process owners who bear the responsibility for their accuracy and complete-
ness each step of the way in the product’s realization processes. The record retention
responsibility, therefore, shall be assigned to those process owners who carry out the
last step in the documentation, review, approval, or final handling of the designated
record(s). According to work assignment responsibilities, as defined in the quality sys-
tem’s procedures, the retention of records shall be done as defined below.

                      OVERVIEW TO QOP 003
         (CONTROL OF PURCHASES)
How often we find that the Purchasing Department is out of the quality loop because of its
independent stature. Then the purchased item comes in and is rejected. The inspection report
indicates that the product was made by somebody who had absolutely no knowledge as to what
kind of product quality the customer required. Now, you have to rework it at your expense, for
you are out of time to meet the scheduled delivery requirement. Within a process-approach
quality management system, the Purchasing Department becomes part of the team. After all we
work for the same company and the same customer. Don’t we? So let’s bring this sacred cow into
the fold in order that we all know our customers’ requirements for product quality. QOP 003 is
the procedure that requires the Purchasing Agent and the Subcontractor to understand the product
quality requirements expected to be realized in purchased products. This procedure is packed with
preventive quality requirements in order that we don’t buy junk that would end up causing
problems and wipe out any profit we calculated to make on the project.

SECTION TWO
1.0 
PURPOSE
Define the quality requirements regarding evaluation of subcontractors (Suppliers).
2.0 
APPLICATION
The results of evaluation shall apply to the selection and approval of subcontractors. The
evaluation process shall be based on subcontractors’ capability to deliver acceptable
products, and on evidence of documented procedures of quality requirements. (AS9000,
par. 4.6.2 “NOTE”)
3.0 
PROCEDURE
3.01 Selection of Suppliers (Subcontractors)
The Purchasing Agent shall:
1. Select the suitable subcontractors.
a) on established subcontractors, base suitability on the already existing quality
      records from the Supplier Product Folders located in Quality. Observe previously
      demonstrated capability, product quality and delivery history and act accordingly;
b) on new subcontractors, base the initial suitability by reviewing their available
background profiled on the Internet, or any records available from the local Better
Business Bureau, or recommendations from customers and business associates.
2. Request Quality Engineering to determine subcontractors’ capability by survey, as
required;
3. Ensure that procurement activities are in line with production scheduling requirements.
Note 1.  In urgent situations, the Purchasing Agent should interact with Quality to evaluate
              and approve subcontractors at the same time internal Purchase Orders are reviewed
              for approval. “Blind” approval should not be accepted.
3.02   Evaluation of Suppliers (Subcontractors)
          The Quality Engineer shall:
1. Review the chosen subcontractors selected by the Purchasing Agent regarding evalua-
tion and approval;
2. Determine whether the selected subcontractor(s) are established or new suppliers;

         accordingly:
                   a)  do on-site survey
   b)  or mail-in survey
3.02.1   On-site Survey
             The Quality Engineer shall:
1.   Contact subcontractor’s Quality and arrange the date for the on-site survey;
2.   Review the project specifics that would be required for capability determination in
doing the survey at the subcontractor;
3.   Prepare the necessary documents to take in order to facilitate the survey (on Form A-
026 or A-035, whichever is more suitable). Go to the subcontractor as scheduled;
4.   Conduct the quality survey by following the questions listed on the selected survey
form. Check off each item according to finding. Take notes as required;
5.   Review the survey results with the subcontractor’s Quality Representative. Point out
areas of non-conformance, if any, and inform the subcontractor that approval is
dependent on corrective action. Or inform the subcontractor that there have been no
violations found. Prepare to conclude the survey;
6.   Sign and date the survey form and give a copy to the subcontractor’s representative;
7.   Back home, submit the completed survey form to supervision for final approval
(auditing) and issue trip report on survey results to all concerned (Purchasing);
8.   Make up the Supplier Product Folder as required and file in it the relevant survey
related documents, including the trip report.
Note 2.  Issuance and approval of purchase order(s) to subcontractors with outstanding
              corrective action requirements should not be done until the identified noncom-
              pliance has been corrected and implemented. Issue Form A-037 (Supplier
              Corrective Action Request, pg 496) in order to verify compliance.
3.02.2  Mail-in Survey
            The Quality Engineer shall:
1. Send (mail or fax) Survey Request (Form A-026) to the selected subcontractor. State in
     the cover letter the reason and contingency for the survey requirement;
2. Review the returned Survey Request. Sign and date it;
3. Forward the signed Survey Request to supervision for approval review;
4.  Notify all concerned (Purchasing) on approval or disapproval (on Form A-003);

                                                                                                    QUALITY OPERATING PROCEDURE 003   343

              corrective action requirements should not be done until the identified noncom-
              pliance has been corrected and implemented. Issue Form A-037 (Supplier
              Corrective Action Request) in order to verify compliance.
3.03   Subcontractor Rating
          General
          Subcontractors are expected to comply with the provisions of Purchase Orders issued to
          them. These Purchase Orders contain stipulated provisions relating to general and specific
          product related requirements. The Quality Provisions are just one component of the total
          requirements. In a rating process, the violations of the imposed PO provisions should be
          compared against a predetermined criteria (penalty points) made up according to the
          business interest of the Company. The predetermined criteria should be the standard rule
          against which subcontractors are rated and after “so many” violations disqualified. (In
          small businesses, subcontractors are relatively few and the rating system is based more on
          arbitrary decision than on an established rating system. Accordingly, the arbitrary decision
          making is heavily based on two factors: delivery and product quality capability. In tune
          with this approach, the following process instructions should be subject to individual con-
          sideration.)
          Implementation
          The Quality Engineer shall:
1.  Compile a list of all the active subcontractors;
2.  Design a form (uncontrolled) with only two entries:
    (Uncontrolled Form)
     VENDOR RATING
 Vendor’s Name
Violations
 1. The Hatchet Company
           1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10
3. Circle the number of violations progressively each time the same vendor had been
issued a SCAR (Supplier Corrective Action Request);
4. Interact with management in order to determine at which point to “pull the plug” on a
subcontractor;
5. Document the result of management’s decision on Form A-003;

 OVERVIEW TO QOP 004
(CONTROL OF CUSTOMER SUPPLIED PRODUCT)
Customer supplied products could be just about anything that an organization may need in sup-
porting the contracted product’s realization processes. The presumption that whatever the cus-
tomer may provide in supporting product realization is already a qualified product, because the
customer checked it before releasing it, is as far from the truth as catching a 10 pound bass on dry
land. Of course, not every customer falls under this scenario. The customer’s previously demon-
strated capability should be the yardstick by which we should take any chances in accepting the
supplied product(s). Without controlling customer-supplied products, we are inviting the same
type of problems as accepting unverified products from subcontractors. Just when we are going
through the first production piece verification, we discover the problems. This is another area
where any profit we wanted to make on the job had evaporated. Sometimes I wonder where
customer satisfaction begins, now that I am buying product support from the customer. Anyway,
QOP 004 is giving you the tools in order to control customer supplied products, similarly as you
would buy products from anybody else. It’s a fair deal.

  PURPOSE
  To control customer supplied products in accordance with the quality provisions of the
  Purchase Order and this procedure.
2.0 
  APPLICATION
  Customer supplied product determines the processing schedule to furnish goods within
  delivery requirements of the contract. As such, the quality of the supplied product bears a
  substantial impact to comply with that requirement. The application of this procedure shall
  ensure the expedient identification, verification, documentation and release of the cus-
  tomer supplied product.
3.0 
  PROCEDURE
3.01
Receiving
The Receiver shall:
1. Receive the delivered product. Sign delivery papers as required;
2. Verify that the delivered product is accurately reflected in the customer’s Packing Slip;
3. Record on Form A-015 (Record of Received Materials, pg 470) the product related
information as requested in the form. Ensure accuracy and completeness. Sign and date
it. Put this form on your desk for now;
4. Fill out Form A-027 (several may be required, pg 486), indicating the received pro-
duct’s identification according to the form’s description requirement. Secure Form A-
027 onto the product, according to the quantities, lot/batch, S/N, so that the shipment
can be identified and located as one controlled entity;
5. Place the entire shipment in a safe area in order to prevent unauthorized removal;
6. Take now Form A-015 and all the documents sent by the customer and turn them over
to the Quality Department.
3.02    The Receiving Inspector shall:
1. Accept the documents from the Receiver and schedule the identification, verification
and release requirements of the received product by reviewing Form A-015, the
customer’s PO, and Form A-001(both the PO and Form A-001 are located in the
Inspection Product Folder);
2. Determine the extent of the verification, identification, and release requirements:
a) base the dimensional verification and documentation requirement on the cus-
      tomer’s previously demonstrated product quality history. Accordingly, waive or
      impose dimensional verification and documentation;

                                                                                                    QUALITY OPERATING PROCEDURE 004   349

 OVERVIEW TO QOP 005
(PRODUCT IDENTIFICATION AND TRACEABILITY)
Product identification is much like your birth certificate. It tells you something but not everything
about yourself. Product-related documents do the same thing. This is the way we identify some
very basic earmarks about the product we are putting through the various processes. The part, the
serial, the lot or batch numbers, all serve to identify the product. Sometime, we don’t mark the
product, so we identify it on the document accompanying it. Then, we attach tags or labels to the
product. We also identify the product on the Job Traveler and on the Operation Sheet. The
customer does it on the Purchase Order and on the product specification. Now, we can not only
match the product to its documents, but we can also trace it on the production floor, in the
stockroom or even in the field. This is what product identification is all about. QOP 005 tells you
how to control the process of product identification and traceability.

1.0 
PURPOSE
To maintain control over the process of product identification and traceability through
the requirements of documented procedures.
2.0 
APPLICATION
This procedure shall apply to product identification and traceability for the issuance of
documents and the enforcement of marking.
3.0 
PROCEDURE
Product identification and traceability shall be enforced as stated in the customer’s
Purchase Order for two reasons:
1)   internal document control for product traceability
2) implementation of customer flow-down requirements
3.01 Internal Control
           General
1. The primary controlling method for document and product identification shall be
      the customer’s Purchase Order imposed product part number and its revision level.
      Additional controls, such as individual serial numbering, batch or lot control, shall be
      imposed both in the related documents and on the product itself, as required.
2. Parts serialization, batch or lot control, when imposed, shall begin from the receipt of
product(s), or as otherwise determined by the processing requirement. This shall form
      the basis also for identification later when splitting quantities for multiple processing
      is required.
3. Follow-on marking and documentation when, through processing, the original
      marking has been removed, shall be identically re-marked throughout processing.
4. Process owners accountability for product identification and record keeping for the
parts they have done shall be enforced and tracked by supervision.
5. Identification and documentation of the products and/or services, ordered on internally
issued Purchase Orders, shall conform to the customer’s Purchase Order requirements.
6. Departments issuing product-related documents shall enforce the identification and
documentation requirements according to the customer’s Purchase Order.
7. Quality shall flow down the customer’s specific product marking and traceability
requirements in the Purchase Order Review Sheet, Form A-001.

                                                                                                    QUALITY OPERATING PROCEDURE 005   355

QOP 005 DOCUMENT REQ’D: Forms A-001, A-008
3.01.1 Issuance of Product Related Documents
Contracts, Engineering, Purchasing, Planning, and Manufacturing shall:
1. Record on the applicable documents prior to issuance, the customer’s name, the
product’s part number and revision level, and the serial, batch or lot identifying
numbers. Record other information in addition, as required;
2. Update all the documents affecting the product when customers issue Purchase Order
Amendments as defined in QOP 001, Section Four (pg 307).
3.01.2 Quality Provisions for Ancillary Requirements
The Quality Engineer shall:
1. Ensure that the product-related inspection documents have been identified with the
customer’s name, the product’s part number and revision level, and the serial, batch or
lot identifying numbers, as applicable, including rejected products;
2. Ensure that the NCMR (Non-conforming Material Report) serial number has been
recorded on every product-related document, identifying the individual piece, batch or
lot that has been rejected;
3. Ensure that no customer related product has been staged, stored, or in process within
the confines of controlled areas without identifying document.
4. Ensure that materials, purchased to satisfy a customer based purchase order require-
      ment, have the test pieces identified and documented, and the materials have been
      preserved, protected, and stored in order that traceability to the certified identity of the
      product can be adequately verified. Furthermore, ensure that analysis to validate
      certifications have been planned, controlled and documented, as required. (SAE
      AS9000, par. 4.10.2.4)
3.02     Customer Flow-down Requirement
The Quality Engineer shall:
1. Define product traceability and marking requirements in Form A-001 as required by
the customer’s PO and by internal controls;
2. Enforce flow-down description of product traceability and marking in the Job Traveler
and Operation Sheets, as applicable.
The Process Engineer shall:
1. Define product traceability and marking requirements in the Job Traveler and
      Operation Sheets as required by the customer’s PO and Form A-001;
2. Issue detailed work instruction and sketch as to show where product marking should

                 OVERVIEW TO QOP 006
  (INSPECTION AND TEST CONTROL)
This QOP is the longest of the quality operating procedures and it is by design that way. Instead
of having a dozen or more procedures written separately on the different inspection assignments
needed to support product quality enforcement, I have combined them all under one control.
During my forty years in the field of Quality, I found that the various inspection functions were
documented in such a fragmented, confusing manner that it took longer to find the procedure
covering a specific type of inspection than to do the work itself. This was one reason why I
combined them all under one directory. The second reason was to cut down on the volume of
documents burdening the quality system, and the third was to maintain linkage to one QOP
instead of a dozen. Now, anything you want to find regarding inspections will take you a second
to find under its own index.
This consolidated QOP is the first most important controlling document of the quality manage-
ment system, for it deals with verification, acceptance, documentation and release of products to
the customer. It has seven separate sections, each dedicated to control one or more inspection
function, and it covers the entire processing cycle of a contracted product, including customer and
subcontractor source inspection. Please look up the index, next page, to discover how extensively
we cover the field of inspections.

8.0      Compiling the First Article Inspection Report
Note 1.   The First Article Inspection Report shouldn’t be put together until all the
                            required processing steps have been completed and the product verified,
                            approved, and released from final inspection.
Note 2.   The First Article Inspection Report consists of all those documents that were
                            issued to control the various processing operations including subcontracting,
                            special processes and any MRB activity, proving work results documentation in
                            compliance with requirements.
The Quality Engineer shall:
1. Bring together the Production Folder, First Article Inspection Product Folder, and the
Supplier Product Folder. (These three folders should contain all the First Article
records substantiating the processing and product quality control records);
2. Find the Job Traveler and Form A-001. Review both documents and ensure that all re-
quired operations had been signed off. If omissions have been found, determine the
impact and process an NCMR, as required, and execute it in accordance with QOP
009, Section One and Two. (You may omit this step if forms A-008 and A-001 were
already reviewed under paragraph 6.0 above.) Begin gathering the documents needed
to make up the First Article Inspection Report (FAIR);
3. Start with the Job Traveler. The first operation should be “Material Release” (see parts
list, as required). Find the material’s certification. This document should be your
fourth record in the “FAIR” (First Article Inspection Report) stack. (The first
document is the Customer’s PO. The second one is the Job Traveler. The third one is
Form A-001);
Note 3.   When the customer supplies the material, it usually doesn’t provide the certifica-
                tion with it. The customer’s PO should specify what has been supplied.
4. Go step by step following the Job Traveler, pull together from the folders all those
records substantiating work results documentation, including subcontracting and
special processes. Place the documents in sequential order. Place any NCMR related

  Document Retention
  General
  The First Article documents are not standard production documents due to the nature of
             project specific handling and controls imposed externally by the customer’s Purchase
             Order, or internally for processing qualification requirements. Although the controlling
             documents had been derived from the established quality system’s procedures, the pur-
             pose for which they were applied made them isolated under First Article sectioning.
             Therefore, retention of these documents should not be intermixed with the standard pro-
             duction and quality records. For internal document retention, file the records under “De-
             velopmental Documents.” For external requirement, file the records as agreed with Engi-
             neering.
  The Quality Engineer shall:
1. Interact with Engineering and determine the storage location of the First Article
        documents;
2. Place the Production Folder, the First Article Inspection Product Folder, the Supplier
        Product Folder and the extra copies of the FAIR in a container suitable for storage;
3. Place a label on the container, indicating “FAIR,” the customer’s name and product
        part number, and the container’s contents. Place the container in storage, as required.
  Note 4.   Should the First Article unit be released by the customer for production, the
                 stored documents would facilitate prompt reestablishment of all the past perfor-
                 mance and product quality requirements (for a fixed process control − ESA).

of the QSM (also SAE AS 9000 par. 4.10.2.4) may be binding as determined by
the customer’s PO (refer to QOP 005, paragraph 3.01.2, step 4). Act accordingly;
SPECIAL INSTRUCTION: At this time you may release the product for urgent pro-
duction requirement without any further inspection. Note this action on Form A-015
and skip step 3. Continue with steps 4,5,6,7. When the urgently released product is
found non-conforming during production, recall the product and process it through the
NCMR provisions of QOP 009, Section Two (pg 410).
3. Verify the product as identified by the Receiver on Form A-027. Perform dimensional
       inspection and document the measurement results onto Form A-018, as required.
4.  Mark or serialize the product (the part(s), lot(s)/batch(s)) based on 2b above (also
refer to QOP 005, paragraph 3.01, step 2, pg 354). Record any additional product
marking and/or serialization done on Forms A-015 and on A-001, as required;
a) in case of missing, damaged, or otherwise rejected product, follow the provisions
      of QOP 009, Section Two, par 3.01.4.4 (the NCMR process on RTV, pg 413).
5. Accept the received product. Stamp, or sign and date Form A-015 and A-027 (Material
Identification Tag). Release the product by notifying the Receiver;
6. Make two copies of Form A-015. File one copy together with other related documents
(such as certs.) in the Supplier Product Folder;
7. Send the original of Form A-015 and the Packing Slip to Contracts. Send the second
copy of Form A-015 to Engineering. Form A-027 stays on the released product.

390   QUALITY OPERATING PROCEDURE 007
        OVERVIEW TO QOP 007
(CONTROL OF INSPECTION, MEASURING AND TEST EQUIPMENT)
When we talk about product verification, what we really mean is to check that product
with a measuring device to determine if it meets a determined tolerance limit. How often
do we do this without questioning whether that measuring device we just used is good
enough to do the job? So you see, that measuring device also has a tolerance limit. And
then, when we confirm it to determine its accuracy, the validating equipment also has a
tolerance limit. There must be someone in every shop where measuring equipment is
used, to take care of the gages, or very soon we are out of business, because we can’t
accurately measure what we made. All this, of course, is a reminder that we must always
know, ahead of time, whether our measuring and test equipment were calibrated and that
they are suitable for the type of measurement we want to make. QOP 007 is the
procedure that tells us how to go about controlling measuring and test equipment. This
procedure controls not only company owned equipment, but also personal and customer
owned or loaned measuring and test equipment.

                                                                                        ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES   391

  APPLICATION
  This procedure shall apply to all types of Company and employee owned inspec-
  tion, measuring, and test equipment, as well as to those under loan agreement
  (verbal or documented).
3.0 
  PROCEDURE
  General Requirement
            Record keeping shall be the acceptable means to demonstrate control of inspec-
            tion, measuring and test equipment, including test software, and comparative
            references. The control of measuring and test equipment shall comply with ISO
            10012 -1 and/or ANSI/NCSL Z540-1. Computerized data collection shall be
            allowed to maintain the records of calibration.
The built-in variability (gage maker’s tolerance) of the selected measuring and
            test equipment shall be known in order to be able to assign that equipment to
            confirm a specified requirement (dimension, weight, etc.) to the defined tolerance
            limits. (Match the equipment to the capability requirement.) Any software used in
            measuring applications shall be confirmed prior to its application.
The documented accuracy of the calibration masters shall be traceable to known
            standards (national or international, or even to a homemade standard in excep-
            tional cases) in order to ensure suitability for the intended confirmation require-
            ment. The documented accuracy and repeatability of the calibration masters and
            comparative references shall be certified by independent authority at predeter-
            mined intervals based on the equipment manufacturers’ recommendations or as
            otherwise specified by internal requirement.
The calibration records shall demonstrate the frequency (cycle time) of confirma-
tions of all the identified measuring and test equipment, including process own-
ers’ equipment and test software. Traceable record maintenance shall be a require-
ment as evidence of control. The calibration records shall be made available to
customers or their representatives upon request.  (SAE AS9000, par. 4.11.1.1)

3.01 
Controlling the Identification of Gages
            The Calibration Technician shall:
1. Uniquely identify (label) all inspection, measuring, and test equipment. Do
this either on the instrument itself, or when that’s not possible, on the con-
tainer holding the instrument. Use discretion when metal stamping or other
form of identification is applied so as not to damage the internal mechanism
of the instrument;
2. Uniquely identify the employees owned measuring and test equipment which
they use to verify and accept the Company’s product(s);
3. Control the inventory of the measuring and test equipment which are under
loan agreement or on borrowed basis. Identify them on Form A-020 (Calibra-
tion Status Record) only. Don’t calibrate these as the owners do the schedul-
ing of calibration. Verify their accuracy and repeatability by similarity com-
parison and record the results on Form A-020, under “Status,” as required;
4. Ensure that the ID number assigned to each measuring and test equipment is
always maintained on the specific equipment (calibration sticker) and on all
the calibration related documents even if that equipment is removed from ser-
vice;
5. Don’t reassign the once issued ID number to any other equipment (new or
refurbished) unless the old calibration record clearly states the replacement
requirement and can substantiate the “was” versus the “is” calibration accura-
cy and repeatability status;
6. Identify all the equipment no longer suitable for measuring and test require-
ments as “No Longer in Service.” Stamp, or sign and date the label. Or scrap
the equipment.
3.02   Controlling the Handling, Preservation, and Storage of Gages
  The Calibration Technician shall:
1. Maintain all the measuring and test equipment and comparative reference
      masters separately from the commonly assigned equipment;
2. Maintain the environmental conditions in order to provide a suitable area for
      calibration, preservation, and storage for the measuring and test equipment;
3. Safeguard the measuring and test equipment from tempering and pilferage;
4. Maintain “Sign-in and Return Log” in accordance with house rules;
5. Provide adequate instructions (verbal or documented, in-house or off-site) to
those employees showing lack of skill in the handling and application of the

6. Keep the Training Log, Form A-016 (pg 471), up to date whenever training
instructions to the employees have been given, especially for new employees;
7. Maintain surveillance throughout the processing areas or where the measuring
and test equipment is being used to ensure safe containment and handling of
the equipment. Ensure on spot corrective action through supervision.
3.03   Controlling the Calibration of Gages
  The Calibration Technician shall:
1. Plan the calibration assignment of the measuring and test equipment in line
      with the requirement of production scheduling in order to ensure an uninter-
      rupted processing environment;
2. Review and follow the “Gage Calibration Technique Sheets” according to the
      requirement of the type of measuring and test equipment being calibrated. Do
      the calibration. Record the calibration results onto Form A-020 simultaneous-
      ly, as practical;
3. Calibrate the measuring and test equipment routinely as indicated by the cycle
      time (due date) posted on the Calibration Status Report (A-020); (or on the
      “Employee Gage Calibration Cycle Time” sheet shown under the Training
      Metrics QOP 007, Basic Information, pg 184)
4. Calibrate the measuring and test equipment at other times as follows: when
 It’s new,
 It has been repaired,
 It has been recalled,
 The accuracy is in question,
 Failure occurs (damage, etc.);
5. Ensure, when calibrating the measuring and test equipment, that the previous-
      ly recorded calibration results are reviewed, case by case, in order to assess
                  the progressive deterioration to reclassify the equipment or to determine what
                  is wrong in order to rework/repair it;
6. Lubricate the mechanical equipment as recommended by the manufacturer;
7. Maintain a safe work area and keep the place clean and organized.
3.04   Controlling the Documentation of Gages
The Calibration Technician shall:
1. Maintain for each identified measuring and test equipment accurate documen-
                  tation on Form A-020; (for the employee gages, see the “Employee Gage
                  Calibration Record” shown under the Training Metrics QOP 007, pg 185).

2. Place a stamped, or signed and dated Calibration Sticker on each identified
measuring and test equipment according to the calibration and due date re-
corded on Form A-020. (For the employee gages, refer to the “Employee
Gage Calibration Cycle Time” sheet shown in the Training Metrics QOP 007
under Basic Information, pg 184.) Observe the following:
a) don’t place calibration stickers on individual pin (plug) gages belonging to
      a set. Place the sticker on the box containing the pins. The same thing
      applies to size blocks and other gage sets. The “Calibration Certificate” is
      your “Proof of Record.” Describe it as such on Form A-020, under the
      description “Status.” Attach the “Cert” to the back of the applicable Form
      A-020 and tuck both documents in a “Sheet Protector.” Then, stack these
      “Sheet Protectors” in a binder;
b) Some shops have work reference plug gages and size blocks that are not
      in the calibration system anymore due to downgrading. That’s OK. But
      put a note on the box containing the gages, “For Reference Only – Verify
      Before Use – Not For Product Acceptance”;
c) Some shops have granite surface plates and other equipment (placed in the
most obvious area) that are not exactly to the “Standard” but are perfectly
useable for reference applications. Put the following note on them, “For
Reference Only – Not For Product Acceptance.”
3.05    Controlling the Calibration Records
   The Calibration Technician shall:
1. Group the calibration records into three categories:
a) company owned measuring and test equipment;
b)   employee owned measuring and test equipment;
c)   customer and/or loaned measuring and test equipment.
Note: Subcontractors’ calibration control is regulated and satisfied under the
survey protocol records. (See QOP 003, Sec One, par 3.04 on page 339)
2. Arrange the categorized calibration records in a binder according to your
“paper” organizational skills in order to be able to locate them promptly; (Use
“Sheet Protectors” as appropriate)
3. Maintain document order within your established filing system at all times.
3.06      Inspection, Measuring, and Test Equipment Release
             Release any measuring and test equipment as required by the process owners.

OVERVIEW TO QOP 008
(CONTROL OF INSPECTION AND TEST STATUS)
The control of inspection and test status means a lot more than just keeping track of in-
spection stamps and passwords. The meaning behind it has everything to do with the
authorized use or application of them. The authorized use of this media signifies that a
product has been verified, accepted, and released to go on to the next determined step in
the product’s finishing cycle. Without it, we would not know whether any phase opera-
tion was checked or not. We would be going on and on finishing a product only to find
out at the end that from the first piece on to the last piece everything was rejected. No-
body indicated along the way that any processing step was controlled. What a way to
learn a lesson! So, those who are authorized to release products from operation to opera-
tion bear a very significant responsibility in the application of inspection stamps and
passwords. QOP 008 will define for you how to go about controlling the use of signa-
tures, stamps, and passwords.

PURPOSE
Maintain control over inspection and test status indication, and computer access
codes (passwords).
2.0     APPLICATION
          This procedure shall apply to the application of inspection stamps and electronic
          passwords.(see SAE AS9000, par. 4.12.1)
3.0     PROCEDURE
          General Requirement
Inspection and test status indication shall be applied to product acceptance and
release during the entire processing cycle, including products that are on hold
and/or waiting for disposition. The indication of inspection and test status may be
executed on the product itself, as required, but not without backup documentation
to prove it. All products stored for further processing or shipment to customers
shall have the inspection and test status indicated (on the Job Traveler or A- 013).
Computerized (software based) document and data management for product related
matters shall require access code (password) for all employees whose assignments
affect product quality. Product acceptance and release indication executed through
a software based documentation system shall be limited to designated personnel,
responsible for the acceptance and release of the identified product(s). The issuance
of access codes (passwords) shall be documented and controlled. Periodic monitor-
ing by the issuing authority to ensure proper application of the access codes shall
be enforced and adequately documented, as required.
3.01 The Control of Inspection Stamps
The Quality Engineer shall:
1. Determine the need as to the type(s) of inspection stamps required. Purchase
adequate quantities of inspection stamps to ensure replacement coverage in
case of wear, loss, damage, or application denial;
2. Determine who will be the stamp owners, authorized to use the stamps for
specific applications, according to their assignments to accept and release
products. Issue and distribute to the stamp owners a Quality Directive on the

                                                      QUALITY OPERATING PROCEDURE 008   401

      application of stamps and the associated responsibility. Use Form A-003
      (blank, pg 457) on which to issue this directive, as appropriate;
3. Assign the stamps according to documentation requirement stated on Form
      A-032 (pg 491);
4. Monitor the application of the issued stamps, as required, to prevent improper
use. Record the monitoring results onto Form A-022 (pg 478). When finished,
sign and date this form and hand it over to the Management Representative.
Take corrective action, as required. In severe cases, resort to the NCMR
process (QOP 009) for Corrective Action implementation, as appropriate;
5. Maintain security over the stamp inventory;
6. Manage additional documentation requirement on Form A-032 according to
personnel changes;
7. Retain Forms A-003 (Quality Directive) and A-032 in one file folder. When
issuing stamps, issue the Quality Directive at the same time.
           Standard: The stamp owner’s signature on Form A-032 represents the acceptance
           of responsibility in the proper application of the issued stamp(s). The stamp(s)
           owner may apply his/her signature on processing related documents instead
           of using the authorized stamp(s) in the acceptance and release of product(s).
3.02 The Control of Electronic Passwords
The Communications Manager shall:
1. Determine the need as to methods used in the issuance, limitation, and appli-
cation of electronic access codes (passwords). Accordingly, issue and distribute
a Communication Directive, using Form A-003, as appropriate, informing the
employees about basic requirements and conduct, regarding password owner-
ship, application, and responsibility;
2. Maintain internal registry on Form A-032 on all password owners, including
access limitations. Keep this registry secured. Provide access to it by upper
management in case of your absence or termination;
3. Monitor the application of the issued passwords, as required, to prevent
improper use. Record the monitoring results onto Form A-022. When finished,
sign and date this form and send it (E-mail) over to the Management Represen-
tative. Take corrective action, as required. In severe cases resort to the NCMR
process (QOP 009) for Corrective Action implementation, as appropriate;
4. Manage additional electronic documentation requirements on Form A-032
according to personnel changes.

                   OVERVIEW TO QOP 009
 (CONTROL OF NON-CONFORMING PRODUCTS)
This procedure is about controlling non-conforming products and it is the third longest
procedure by design. Don’t be surprised to learn that in a process-approach quality
management system, the control of non-conforming products also means controlling
deficiencies in documents, processes, and methods. We cannot have an effectively run
business by controlling hardware problems alone when the contributing causes of the
non-conformance originated from deficiencies in documents, processes, and methods.
Controlling deficiency in every process from planning to the delivery of the product is the
quintessential driver in a process-approach system to effect on time continuous improve-
ment to the operating management system. The lack of this type of control in businesses
of all types is the hornet’s nest from which everybody runs away instead of facing it and
eliminating it through effective corrective action. This QOP has been linked to other
QOPs in the quality management system, and the other QOPs in turn have been linked to
this QOP, in order to bring about solving the festering problems in all the core depart-
mental activities, contributing directly or indirectly to the deficiencies in documents, pro-
cesses, and methods. Once a non-conformance has been identified and written up on
Form A-006, MRB is required to call for corrective action in line with the significance of
the problem. The implementation of corrective action cannot be shoved aside, cannot be
ignored, and cannot be turned over to Management Reviews as long as there are docu-
mented procedures in force to cure it. The Management Representative cannot close out
any Form A-006 (Non-conforming Material Report) until he/she has followed up the
effective implementation of corrective/preventive action. Under this system, the Manage-
ment Representative is being independently audited for compliance. This is the signifi-
cance of the stated provisions in QOP 009.

2.0 
APPLICATION
This procedure shall apply to the handling, reporting, and documentation of non-
conforming products, documents, and actions affecting product quality.
3.0     Definitions
1. Deviation – a specific customer authorization issued prior to the manufacture
      of a product to allow departure from a defined design requirement for a speci-
      fic number of units for a specific duration.
2. Product non-conformance – is any condition that violates the requirement of
a specification, process, or procedure.
3. Repair − a non-conforming product which cannot be further processed to meet
a specified requirement without written approval from the customer.
4. Rework – a non-conforming product which can be reprocessed under defined
conditions to meet a specified drawing requirement.
5. Waiver – a written request sent to a customer to disposition a non-conforming
product.
4.0     General Requirements
           Non-conformance in product(s) and documented procedures shall be verified and
           documented in order to be processed as a reported non-conformance. Otherwise, it
           would lack the documented evidence to prove the indication of non-conformance
           (Forms A-018 and A-009).
           Decisions made by the reviewing authority (MRB) shall be unanimous. In case of
           conflict, the management shall make the final decision.
           A minimum of two (2) members of the reviewing authority shall be required to
           make a decision binding. One of the members shall always be a quality represen-
           tative. The customer has final authority over non-reworkable products.

priate action required. Do this by encircling the activity indicator(s) (RWK,
RPR, ACC, RTV, SCR, Waiver) and indicating the affected item(s) (from
section two of A-006). Next, add under “Instruction/Comment,” in line with
the affected item, any relevant information required to be followed by those
who will be implementing your disposition(s);
3. Determine whether any corrective/preventive action is required and enter
this requirement under “C/A.” Then, sign and date as shown, authorizing
enforcement;
4. Describe the “Corrective Action” specifically (in section five of form A-
006) as to who, where, and what to enforce. Then, indicate the “Required
By” date as shown in order to know the implementation time deadline. Sign
and date as shown to authorize the C/A implementation.

3.03          Cause/Corrective Action Request by the Customer (SCAR)
                 The Quality Engineer shall:
1. Review the Cause/Corrective Action Request (SCAR) sent by the cus-
         tomer and determine the course of action to take in complying with it:
a) go to the Inspection Product Folder. Identify the customer’s folder by
the product’s part number and pull it out;
b) review the folder’s contents − Job Traveler (A-008) and the Final
Inspection Report (A-018) − and look for any posted NCMR number.
Review the NCMR also, if there is one, in order to establish relevancy
to the case identified in the SCAR.
2. Answer the SCAR according to what you have found in the records, or if
the records indicate no violation, accept the fact as stated in the SCAR and
respond to it accordingly, or recall the product to substantiate the “purport-
ed” deficiency; or (go to step 3)
Note: Do not respond to any SCAR prematurely. Wait until you have done all
the internal cause/corrective action as required by this QOP 009, Section Two.
3. Determine the necessary corrective action, if required, in line with the
answer you have given to the customer in the SCAR under “Corrective
Action Taken.” Implement meaningful corrective action in accordance
with the established procedures stated in this QOP 009, Section Two,
paragraphs 3.01.5 and 3.01.6 (pg 415). Issue the NCMR, as appropriate;
4. Mail or fax the completed SCAR to the customer, as requested;
5. Maintain control over the documents that relate to this case in accordance
with QOP 002, Section Three, under A-037, par 3.05w on page 333.

                  application of Form A-038 is a self-imposed requirement to document and
                  implement those areas of product concerns that fall outside the established
                  documented system. The purpose of the application of Form A-038 is to
                  ensure ultimate customer satisfaction in product quality beyond those provi-
                  sions stipulated in customers’ Purchase Orders. Failure to define by the cus-
                  tomers the Quality Provisions in their Purchase Orders shall not be construed
                  by the customers as accepting responsibility by the supplier’s organization
                  through the application of Form A-038.
    Form A-038 is a multipurpose document: 1. designed to handle customer com-
                  plaints reported outside of the SCAR provisions of the customer’s Purchase
                  Order. (See paragraph 3.01 above) 2. designed to handle the unsolicited pro-
                  duct evaluation responses that customers may wish to express when they re-
                  ceive a delivered product. (Covered under this paragraph 3.04)
3.04.1       Handling and Controlling Customer Evaluation Reports (A-038)
3.04.1.1    The Final Inspector shall:
1. After product release from final inspection, take a blank form of A-038,
located in the Forms File;
2. Enclose this form with the shipping documents in the “Documents En-
closed” envelop of the deliverable product to the customer.
3.04.1.2     The Management Representative shall:
1. Review each customer responded Evaluation Report (A-038);
2. Determine the product quality impact;
3. Implement corrective action through the provisions of this QOP 009,
Section Two, paragraphs 3.01.5 and 3.01.6 (pg 415), as appropriate;
4. Report the “Customer Satisfaction Measurement” at the next Management
Review, as required;

OVERVIEW TO QOP 010
     (INTERNAL QUALITY AUDIT)
The quality system procedures in this process-approach system don’t resemble the
standard operating procedures (SOP) in conventional quality systems. The quality
procedures in this system have been designed to be user-friendly in all areas as to the
identification of requirement, the definition of responsibility, work assignment, ac-
countability, and process flow. For an auditor to spend more time on compiling the
checklist than on doing the audit itself is absolutely unacceptable in economic terms.
This, of course, is not the auditor’s problem, but how the quality system’s procedures
have been laid out and integrated lend a user-friendly flow process in which what you
need is right in front of you. Since internal audits are mostly done by in-house em-
ployees, it makes a big difference economically whether the auditor spends a few hours
or a few days in accomplishing internal audits. I  paid serious attention to this also when I
planned the layout of my procedures, for I used to do audits at many companies in my
forty years service and could not easily find where and how responsibilities were linked
to work assignments in the conventionally written SOPs. Every quality operating proce-
dure in this process-approach system is also a checklist, not only for the auditor, but also
for the process owner and his supervisor as well. Note also the dramatic shift from con-
ventional methods as to how we maintain continuous improvement in training employees
whenever corrective action requirement points to the operators’ lack of understanding of
their work assignment. The details of the audit process are the subject of this QOP.

  PURPOSE
  Maintain control over the process of carrying out internal quality system audits.
2.0 
  APPLICATION
  The provisions of this operating procedure shall apply to: determining internal
  audit requirements, carrying out internal quality system audits and documentation
  of those activities.
3.0 
  PROCEDURE
3.01  Definition
Audit – a planned, independent review and verification process to determine com-
pliance with the approved procedures of the Quality Management System.
3.02  General Requirement
The manual defines in policy statements the quality system’s requirements and
gives linkage by reference or inclusion to the applicable process instructions,
known as Quality Operating Procedures (QOPs). The manual follows the layout
of ISO 9002/1994 and within these provisions incorporates the requirements of
ISO 9001/2000. It reflects every clause of the Standard according to its numerical
layout, except clauses 4.4 and 4.19. The provisions of AS9000 are complemen-
tary to the basic ISO requirements.
Auditors must first understand the specific paragraph requirement in the manual
and have familiarity with the referenced or included process instructions (QOPs)
before undertaking audits. This is a prerequisite for auditors to enable them to
carry out any planned audit(s) effectively. Auditors shall not impose their own set
of requirements to contradict the provisions of the established and implemented
Quality Management System.
3.03 Performance Requirement
3.03.1 Checklist Guidance
The Auditor shall:
1. Observe: that the Quality Operating Procedures (QOPs) outline the specific
work compliance requirements stated in the Quality Manual: that the QOP
pages have been page plated to give guidance on linkage and document re-
quirement;

                                                                                    QUALITY OPERATING PROCEDURE 010   425

2. Observe: that the process instruction procedures embodied in QOPs guide you
forward to understand the task at hand and at the same time refer you to the
specific forms used by the process owners to record work results; that each
QOP gives indication of linkage to other operating procedures, enabling you
to find the exact enforcement requirement for the identified task;
3. Observe: that each operating procedure is a stand-alone document that may
contain several interrelated work assignments, step by step, requiring work
performance accomplishment and documentation of work results by the
process owners;
Example: QOP 006 (Inspection and Test Control, pg 357) contains seven (7)
interrelated work assignments – first piece inspection; first article inspection;
process control; final inspection; receiving inspection; customer source
inspection; and source inspection at subcontractors. Others follow the same
pattern;
4. Observe: that when auditing is carried out, the QOP sections and the related
paragraphs should be identified and documented in the Audit Plan (Reporting)
Form A-022 (pg 478), to indicate the specific audit effort ( the form is also the
checklist);
5. Observe: that in order to determine conformance or nonconformance to the
specified requirements, the various applicable procedures and forms will have
to be reviewed and understood ahead of time;
6. Observe: that the Management Representative may perform the quality system
audit(s) provided that he/she is not the direct process owner of the work as-
signment(s) being audited;
7. Observe: that when the Management Representative performs a scheduled (A-
021, pg 477) quality system audit, his/her audit performance shall be verified
(audited) by any other independent agent to establish definite audit compli-
ance. (Use the same QOP 010, including Audit Plan, A-022)
3.03.2 Doing the Audit
The Auditor shall:
1. Obtain from the Management Representative the latest (approved and releas-
ed) Quality Manual (pg 267), the Quality Operating Procedures Manual (pg
291), and the Audit Schedule (form A-021). Obtain the Audit Plan
(Reporting) form (A-022) from the Forms File (many will be needed);
2. Take the Audit Schedule (A-021, pg 477) and determine which clause
paragraph is scheduled to be audited for the specified month. Find that clause
paragraph in the Quality Manual;

3. Review all the requirements given under the clause paragraph in the manual.
Then, review the work performance requirement, given either under the clause
paragraph in the manual, or linked to a Quality Operating Procedure. Review
the applicable form(s) assigned either in the manual, or in the Quality Operat-
ing Procedure;
4. Prepare (fill out) the left side of the Audit Plan (Reporting) form (A-022).
Write down in the form what will be audited. Show, step by step, the appli-
cable QOP, the Section in the QOP, and the paragraphs;
5. Carry out the audit in accordance with the process instructions given in the
applicable sections of the Quality Operating Procedure, or the Quality
Manual. Verify, as required, the work result documentation, recorded by the
process owner(s) in the applicable forms. Determine compliance;
6. Record on the right side of the Audit Plan (Reporting) form (A-022), in line
with the identified paragraph, the non-compliance found during your audit. If
none found, report “None.” Report the facts and not what you would like to be
done. Follow the procedure. If the procedure is wrong or misleading, report
that also. You are not allowed to make judgments which would impact pro-
duct quality or the process owners’ job performance;
7. Write down your observations (the facts) and not your recommendations
under “Comments” in the Audit Plan (Reporting) form;
8. Sign and date the Audit Plan form as shown. Turn in the Audit Plan form, the
Quality Manual and the Quality Operating Procedure to the Management
Representative. Put the remainder blanks (A-022) back to the Forms File
under the correct serial number location.
3.03.3 Reviewing the Audit Plan (Reporting) (A-022)
The Management Representative shall:
1. Receive the Audit Plan (Reporting) (one or several) from the Auditor;
2. Review what has been audited and evaluate any non-conformance written
down by the Auditor. Evaluate “Comments” made, as appropriate;
3. Determine any negative impact to product quality, to processes, and to pro-
cedures;
4. Implement corrective action in accordance with the following:
a) if performance has not been carried out and documented as required by
the work instruction, implement corrective action through supervision in
accordance with QOP 006, Sec Three (pg 374), as appropriate, in line
with the identified supervisory responsibility. If NCMR enforcement is
required, do it in accordance with QOP 009, Sec Two (pg 410);

                                                                                    QUALITY OPERATING PROCEDURE 010   427

5. Close out the Audit Schedule (A-021) whenever a scheduled system audit has
been completed. Do this by signing and dating under “AUDIT CLOSEOUT”
in Form A-021;
6. Maintain the system’s audit-related documents in their respective folders as
per QOP 002, Section Three (pg 328).
3.04 Reporting Audit Results to Upper Management
The Management Representative shall:
1. Assess periodically the quality system audit results as to the overall impact
(positive or negative) to product quality, to processes, and to procedures in
respect to internal (organizational) and external (customer satisfaction)
effectiveness;
2. Issue the assessment results on Form A-003 (blank, pg 457) to upper manage-
ment. State the level of effectiveness and efficiency of the Quality Manage-
ment System in respect to overall operations. Do this (quarterly) in line with
the reporting by management to the stakeholders on “the state of business”;
3. Present any significant problems and recommend solutions to upper manage-
ment during “Management Review” to improve the effectiveness and efficien-
cy of the Quality Management System. (see QOP 011 on page 428)

OVERVIEW TO QOP 011
      
      (MANAGEMENT REVIEW)
Management Review in a process-approach system is not the forum to present a
stupendous pile of papers to impress upper management that lots of things were done but
there are still numerous unmanageable problems outstanding, making the operating sys-
tem ineffective. This sort of thing happens when companies implement ISO compliant
systems according to the way they always ran their businesses. They have documented all
their weaknesses and not much has been improved in product quality. They have now
little more to show except a mountain of records and lots of bills, awaiting review. You
see, under a process-approach system, the responsibilities for process-owners are defined
from the beginning to the end in the product’s processing cycle and work assignment
accountability to requirement is demonstrated at every process in the chain of events. The
product is only an object, moving through the cycle, controlled by the process and not by
the problems. Every process owner checks his/her work, because nobody else can build
quality into the product. At the end you are ready to ship that product to the customer.
This is how customer satisfaction is also built into the processes.
Controlling non-conformance in documents, processes, methods, and in products is also
managed as a process. The problems are not pushed aside to be forgotten until they strike
back again. So, management is given all the good news on how problems were solved as
part of process control and not as pending management review to look for improvements
where improvements would do nothing more than fan the wind – too late to add value to
the process. Yet, management reviews are very important to assess successes and through
them set new business plans for growth in an effectively managed production envi-
ronment. In a process-approach system, management makes improvements on the basis
of successes – a very significant change from the ISO philosophy.

APPLICATION
The provisions of this procedure shall apply to the preparation, presentation,

3.0 
PROCEDURE
3.01     General Requirement
            Management Reviews shall be based on the results of effective assessment of the
            internal audits of the Quality Management System. Effectiveness of performance
            shall be measured against targeted limits (threshold) established in line with the
            internal (organizational) and external (customer satisfaction) business interest
            (risk limits) of the Company. Reason: Without being able to demonstrate compli-
            ance versus noncompliance (ratios) against practically established threshold lim-
            its, the goals to accomplish the set objectives of the quality system would miss the
            reason for additional improvements beyond the routine improvements accom-
            plished through the corrective action provisions of QOP 009 (pg 415).
            The Management Representative shall be responsible to establish reasonable
            threshold limits (maximum allowable non-compliance figures) in all the areas
            where this can be objectively implemented in order to know when to trigger (plan,
            do, check, act) corrective measures to remove the causes that negatively impacted
            the goals to achieve the business objectives of the Company. (See par. 3.02, step
            2, below.) When the corrective measures, identified through assessment, cannot
            be implemented through the provisions of QOP 009, Sections Two and Three, the
            Management Representative shall set the agenda for Management Review.
            Management shall not be called to session to review issues for which the answers
            to solve them are given in the documented procedures, for that would be derelic-
            tion (shirking one’s duty). Conversely, when the lack of enforcement on the part
            of the delegated authority (supervision) impacts compliance with the provisions of
            the documented system, management shall be called to session to implement cor-
            rective action.

3.02     Preparation for Management Review
            The Management Representative shall:
1. Review the statistical results of the internal audit assessment. Determine the
levels of noncompliance. Determine whether the causes have been cured
through the C/A provisions of QOP 009, Sec Two (pg 410) and Three (pg
417). If they have not been cured, set the agenda for Management Review to
resolve them. Determine new objectives, recommendations, and solutions;
2. Gather the supporting data to justify Management Review − supporting data
to demonstrate to management both the positive and the negative areas of the
internal audit assessment. Show the effectiveness versus the lack of effective-
ness in respect to the overall performance objectives. Prepare proposal on how
to resolve the lack of effectiveness. Describe these on Form A-003 in order to
support your discussion (persuasion) points during Management Review.
Issue it to all;
3. Select the participants to the Management Review. Ensure that those against
whom corrective action may be issued are present. Management wants to hear
their input for solutions;
4. Compile the supporting data in order of presentation. Make enough copies of
      these documents so that each participant can have a copy ahead of time;
5. Draw up the agenda for the Management Review under step 1 and 2 of Form
A-034 (pg 493). Complete the “Attendees, Place and Date” sections. Distri-
bute Form A-034 to all participants.
6. Prepare the participants so that the management review doesn’t turn into a one
man show, for the whole quality management system is dependent on team-
work to operate effectively. That’s why you gave each participant a copy of
the presentation material under step 4 above;
7. Hold the Management Review as scheduled.
Note: Management Reviews in small business don’t require the elaborate setup
          big companies do. There aren’t enough people to fill every position to carry
          out assignments. One manager may be responsible easily for a half a dozen
          assignments. It often happens that the Management Representative may
          hold the Management Review alone with the General Manager anywhere,
          even standing in the middle of the shop. There is nothing wrong with this
          type of setup for it’s not the setting that counts but the outcome for solu-
          tions and improvements. Nevertheless, the documentation end of the pro-
                      cess still requires the formalities associated with record keeping. That’s
                      why Form A-034 was designed for quick management reviews in small
                      business.

3. Issue Form A-034 to all participants.
3.04     Implementation of Corrective/Preventive Action
The Management Representative shall:
1. Take the blank NCMR (A-006) assigned in paragraph 3.03, step 2, above and
fill out all sections, as appropriate. Observe that this is not a product-related
NCMR but a process related matter. Accordingly, enter the relevant infor-
mation as required. Put “N/A” in the blocks not applicable to Management
Review. After you have described the details in the “Cause,” “MRB Dispo-
sition,” and “Corrective Action” blocks, you and the General Manager sign
and date under each indicator. Distribute the NCMR, as required;
2. Interact with the responsible department head, or the individual, that has to
      implement the corrective action and work out the implementation plan with
      him/her in line with the required date noted on the NCMR, as agreed;
3. Summarize the implementation plan on Form A-003 (blank) and issue it to
      the responsible agent. Maintain a copy of it for follow-up review. Note: cor-
      rective action may involve change to the quality system’s documents, result-
      ing from Management Review. When this happens, carry it out in accordance
      with QOP 002, Sec Two, pg 317 (all paragraphs may apply) to implement it;
4. Maintain control over the retention of documents involved in this process in
      line with QOP 002, Sec Three (pg 328).
3.05     Follow up the Implementation of Corrective Action
            The Management Representative shall:
1. Follow up implementation of corrective action in accordance with QOP 009,
      Sec Two, par 3.01.6 (pg 415).
2. Close out subject NCMR in accordance with QOP 009, Sec Two, par 3.01.7

                                      OVERVIEW TO QOP 012
    (PERFORMANCE STANDARD)
QOP 012 is designed to give you a quick review of linkage as to how a process-approach
system integrates assignments to procedures in handling two types of product categories,
 – conforming and non-conforming products.
Both must be simultaneously dealt with, right through a product’s realization processes.
If we don’t, the conforming product eventually will be shipped, but the non-conforming
product will die on the vine in many cases. At some time it will become a quickly fixed
product, without corrective action. We don’t prevent problems this way. We repeat them.
This is not the continual improvement opportunity ISO 9001/2000 has in mind.
Continuous improvement in a process-approach quality management system primarily
takes place by implementing corrective action through process control, hence preventing
problems from flowing down, process to process. It is for a very good reason then, that
we must also control non-conforming products as we do conforming products.
Section One and Two of this QOP communicate the put through mechanism, first for the
conforming products, second for the non-conforming products. These two procedures
impact directly or indirectly every other Quality Operating Procedure in the quality
system, simply because they effectively handle the two product categories mentioned
above. They are performance standards, for every identified process has a performance
requirement linked to it, which requires work result documentation and end result
measurement to evaluate achievement in both category types.
Section Three is a completely different procedure, dealing with developmental projects to
qualify processing methods and from it, formalizing the project related work instructions
for an ongoing production effort often required with new customer purchase orders.

1.0   PURPOSE
  Standardize work assignments in order to demonstrate the process-approach put
  through system in an actual work environment.
2.0   APPLICATION
  Subject procedure applies to contractually defined products going through the
  phases of planning, processing, verification, release and delivery to the customer.
3.0   PROCEDURE
  General
  A Job Traveler is that controlled document which defines all the required process
  steps that regulate the movement of a product from the beginning of a process to
  the end of a process in a way that process owners can determine from it, step by
  step, the identification of a product and its related documents, the equipment and
  tooling, the work instruction on what to do and what not to do in order to process
  that product to meet the scheduled work process requirement and ultimately, the
  customer’s requirement, without unnecessary interruptions.
  In order for a Job Traveler to become a useful, valid, and an approved process
  control document for all those who are required to follow it, the issuing authority
  (Process Engineer) must interact with Contracts, Production Planning, Purchasing,
  Manufacturing, and Quality to integrate the processing cycle evolution of the pro-
  duct, equipment, people, and methods. This would have to be done in a manner so
  that not one of the members of the operation’s team will have to wait to fulfill its
  responsibilities to carry out his/her work assignment in the  product’s realization
  processes, due to poor planning in the beginning phases of the layout processes.
  After all, the Job Traveler is the road map of the processing cycle, which requires
  continuous input and follow-up by those in charge of it, so that when it is released
  to the traffic (the work realization processes), the people (process owners) will
  not have to be rerouted to take alternate paths to reach their targets (production
  goals), because somebody failed to do his part to make the road map (Job Traveler)
  an accurately reflected schedule-execute-verify-control driven directive (Plan-Do-
  Check-Act).

QOP 012 DOCUMENT REQ’D: Form A-008 (Job Traveler), A-001
   This process-approach quality management system planned the Job Traveler (in-
   cluding Split Travelers) to be  the single most important document to control the
   product’s entire routing requirements in a manner so as to ensure that accurate
   direction is given, in sequential order, to the process owners. This will enable them
   to carry out their work assignments so that the product can be processed through
   the cycle the first time in a controlled manner, ensuring that quality is continuous-
   ly built into the product. Of course, to make this a reality, everybody will have
   to be entrusted to take charge of his/her work assignment in order to help each
   other to work as a team. This brings us then to integrating the work assignments
   within the process approach system so the above can be realized, ensuring along
   the way that each process owner verifies his/her work results and documents it, as
   required, to prevent transferring mistakes, regardless of who made them, from pro-
   cess to process.

1.0 
 PURPOSE
 Integrate the handling and control of non-conformities as part of process control
 during the product’s overall processing cycle.
2.0 
 APPLICATION
 This procedure provides specific instructions on how to handle and control non-
 conformities identified at any point in the processing cycle of the product, in-
 cluding customer complaints and product returns.
3.0 
 PROCEDURE
            General
 Since a non-conforming state could contribute to process deficiencies anywhere
 in the processing cycle of a product, timely resolution of the constraint, created
 by it, must be implemented to ensure effective process continuation. A noncon-
 forming state does not only mean hardware in a process-approach system, but it
 also includes errors in documents, in processes, and in the methods. These may
 eventually affect production and product quality. To stop the transfer of deficien-
 cies creeping from process to process, we have implemented the controls to iso-
 late them and cure them when and where they occur. Not every nonconformity
 leads to hardware deficiency and when it doesn’t, we have implemented other
 methods in this process-approach system to cure them. Carefulness must be exer-
 cised therefore between the two distinct varieties – hardware vs. non-hardware –
 for the cost difference in handling is substantial. Applying the NCMR (MRB)
 process is primarily hardware related. It should also be used when no other docu-
 mented procedure exists to handle corrective action. The four main categories in
which we may discover non-conformities that we must control are:
1. hardware related (handled by the application of the NCMR (MRB)
process);

3.07 Handling customer-related document changes
General Information
Customer-related document changes involve two separately initiated efforts. The
first one is initiated by the customer through the provisions of Purchase Order
Amendments. The second one is initiated internally, due to deficiencies discover-
ed in the customer’s documents. The customer-initiated changes involve extensive
review process due to cost factors, and therefore they are handled much like a
quotation process (RFQ). It is covered under QOP 001, Section Four. The inter-
nally initiated changes involve the application of a “Waiver Request” through the
provisions of QOP 009, Section Two, paragraph 3.01.4.2.1, step 1, under
“Repair.” (pg 412).

SECTION THREE
1.0 
PURPOSE
Maintain control over those activities that involve the product’s processing quali-
fication when no documented procedures exist on how to do it, as with new cus-
tomer Purchase Orders.
2.0 
APPLICATION
            This procedure applies to the planning and implementation of qualification pro-
            cesses on new jobs where the capability as to how to do it have not been previous-
            ly documented and demonstrated.
3.0 
PROCEDURE
General Information
Processing qualification of new products is often regarded by many customers as
nothing more than setting up a new job in an otherwise similar production envi-
ronment. While the equipment, tools, and operator’s skill may be the same, the
processing steps and work methods involved can be completely different. This
type of product cannot be regarded as identical with those products for which the
processing capability has already been demonstrated and documented. Under
uncontrolled conditions, the entire order could become scrap. A process-approach
quality management system must provide the procedural mechanism under which
the processing qualification can be orderly carried out and the product released to
the customer according to his/her PO requirement. Since we have already provid-
ed controlling procedures for First Article Production Approval (ESA) under QOP
006, Section Two, we will be applying certain provisions of the same (text) proce-
dures to implement basic requirements for the processing qualification of new
jobs. The applicable steps are marked with a star “   .”
3.01 
Planning
3.01.1 The Process Engineer does:
Reviews the customer’s PO and product specification in order to determine the
planning and processing layout for developing the procedures on how to imple-
ment the qualification steps on new jobs, which procedures when formalized
would become the standard work instruction for the process owners.
Requirement: QOP 006, Sec Two, par 2.0, steps 1, 2, 4, and 5, (pg 368);

Determines, documents, reviews, approves, and issues the developmental Produc-
tion Folder as stated under:
Requirement: QOP 006, Sec Two, par 5.0, steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6, (pg 369).
3.03   Process Control
3.03.1  The Quality Engineer does:
            Maintains process control, as required, as stated under:
Requirement: QOP 006, Sec Two, par 6.0, steps 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, and 7, (pg 370).
             (Apply these requirements as suitable for the developmental pro-
                                     cessing effort.)
3.03.2  The Quality Engineer does:
Handles developmental non-conforming materials as follows:
1. If the contract (PO) has material (parts) allowance for developmental pur-
poses, no accountability for the non-conformance is required. Correct the non-
conformance as part of processing development. Note that this type of allow-
ance many times is not stated in the contract. What may be stated, however, is
that you are allowed a certain percentage of parts for attrition (scrap). Note
also that physical scrapping may still be controlled under certain contract
provisions (as in the case of AS9000);

velopment should not be controlled as non-conforming material. Document
      it on Form A-006 (NCMR) as part of development and destroy the product, as
      required.
3.04    Closure of Developmental Procedures
3.04.1   The Process Engineer does:
  After the developmental processes are over, you are required to formalize all
              procedures to become a standard operating work instruction issued in Production
              Folders, as stated under:
  Requirement: QOP 006, Section Two, paragraph 5.0, step 7, (pg 370).

              same way as products made under standard operating conditions. The customer’s
              product specification (drawing) is the controlling document. If the development-
              al product meets all the specification requirements, the product can’t be rejected.
              For background information, rely on documents contained in the First Article
              Inspection Product Folder now marked as “Development.” Carry out the final
              inspection, release, and delivery requirements as stated under:
  Requirement: QOP 006, Sec Four, all provisions apply as required, (pg 380).
                                       (Make up a standard Inspection Product Folder at this time in

               BOOK SECTION FOUR
          FORMS MANUAL
                        OVERVIEW TO THE FORMS MANUAL
The forms in this manual represent actual and typical forms used in manufacturing shops to record
work results. Without work results demonstration, there is no way to convince anybody that there
is a controlled quality system in operation. The application of these forms has been linked to the
specific work assignments elaborated in the Quality Operating Procedures. In a sense they are part
of the operating procedures, but for the purpose of maintenance and control, they have been split
off from the operating procedures. The experienced quality practitioner will immediately re-
cognize that a number of these forms are typically used in metal cutting shops and, therefore, need
no additional customizing. Other shops may want to customize them according to their product
lines. Remember though that when you do need to customize a form, the product quality require-
ment, customer satisfaction, continuous improvement objectives, how minimal they are, will not
change. Only the way you want to record the work results to prove accomplishment will change.
Because the forms have a controlled structure insofar as their title, form number, and revision con-
trol are concerned, any change in the body of the forms will not alter this controlled structure. But,
if you add or remove a form, the controlled structure will be impacted. You will have to align any
form addition or removal, first in the Master List, second in the applicable operating procedure and
third in the form itself. Each form has a note on the left bottom of the page, indicating where the
application of it is described. Also, QOP 002, Section Three, gives you details on the application
of forms in addition to retention requirements. The form number is the control number and that is
how each form should be remembered and referenced in communication.
There is a strict retention requirement for most forms because they demonstrate product quality
enforcement and work results documentation. For this reason, clear instruction has been defined in
QOP 002, Section Three, as to where the forms should be filed. This becomes a very important aid
in filing control as you need to refer back to the records when traceability or audit is carried out.
Please refer to the “Guidance” section in front of the book should you need information on how to
carry out changes to the forms.
Remember, ISO 9001/2000 requires a documented procedure to control records (forms). You may
follow the controls I have already implemented.

The Suggestion Path
There are many different ways improvements to an operating quality management system
can be made. We have provided in this book, basically, the documented ways to achieve
them.
In every shop where teamwork and open-mindedness are nurtured and sincerely recog-
nized by management, improvements in just about anything process owners do can be
realized in conjunction with the documented system. In fact, a documented system can be
the biggest prompter for improvements, because of its one-sidedness – the routine struc-
ture. Given freedom to do so, employees, including new employees bringing with them
the innovations from resourceful companies, can turn a “routine structure” into marvelous
simplicity for the better, just for the asking.
Behind this page, I have provided a simple form that can be added to the Production
Folder for the employees to use in challenging the “routine structure” in their work
methods, or in anything else where they see that things can be improved for the better.
Believe me, this would be the best performing “bank account” you have ever opened.

Quality Press.

                                      APPENDIX FOUR
Book Summary
In this process-approach quality management system, I have designed the structural
framework to support all the required processes and procedures that embrace the
documented quality requirements serving contract manufacturing operations. The quality
management system is a throughput system functioning in line with the manufacturing
flow cycle of a contracted product from the Request for Quote phase (RFQ) to the
delivery of a product. This is the shortest distance between input from the customer to the
output from the supplier (organization) and back to the customer in terms of product
quality management. I am managing only the involved processes to ensure product
quality, customer satisfaction and continuous improvement. It is a Total Quality
Management (TQM) system for small business operations in contract manufacturing.
Several quality management techniques have been integrated into the documented system
to achieve operational cohesion and consistent product quality maintenance. These are
listed below:
1. Individual responsibility in respect to work assignments has been identified for all the
processes in the product’s life-cycle in order to recognize accountability and process
ownership to enable the organization to measure performance and output evaluation.
2. The product related quality objectives have been identified and defined in documented
      procedures to ensure the effective control of conforming as well as non-conforming
      products.
3. The throughput quality system is fully documented, integrated, and implemented,
targeting product quality objectives to result in demonstrable and verifiable output
from process owners.
4. The documented procedures include process instructions to enable the monitoring of
performance in order to prevent the migration of discrepancies from process to
process, impacting the end item.
5. For ensuring the achievement of quality objectives, all the documented procedures
have been interactively structured to support “global” quality administration.   
6. The documented quality management system has locked in the controlling features to
ensure corrective/preventive action when and where problems are identified in order
to maintain effective continuous improvement.
7. The periodic Management Review has been restructured to facilitate also on call
participation of management in the decision making processes to enable the
organization timely implementation of corrective action in maintaining continuous
improvement for customer satisfaction.
The process-approach quality management system in this book is based on the continuous
application of the plan-do-check-act cycle in two major areas. First, it is applied to the
documented objectives as a preventive quality tool to weed out variables impacting both
the process and the product. Second, it is applied when non-conformities have been
identified anywhere in the operating system. In the first cycle, the PDCA provisions are
applied to prevent the flow down of errors and mistakes, migrating from process to

504   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
process and impacting throughput and finally the end item. In the second cycle, the
PDCA provisions are applied to correct the deficiencies identified anywhere in the
throughput cycle. This explains why the plan-do-check-act provisions in a process-
approach system are never really ending, for as one product has been delivered, other
products are coming through the production cycle, each with its own Purchase Order
quality requirements within the documented and controlled system. Each requires its own
quality planning, work execution, conformity verification, and the implementation of
task-related follow-ups in line with the specific customer’s quality requirements.
Nowhere else in this book has the application of the above management techniques been explained.
The reason for this should be easily understood from the evolving processes enfolding these manage-
ment techniques through which this process-approach system was implemented. All seven manage-
ment tools listed above were created to build into the quality management system forces that would
impel operational effectiveness in maintaining product quality, cost control, continuous improvement
and customer satisfaction. No quality system will survive long unless it has these objectives
interwoven in the organization’s operational fibers. Without paying careful attention to these objec-
tives in the creation of a quality management system, the uncontrolled variables would erode the finan-
cial resources of the organization resulting in red ink. To prevent this from happening, the seven man-
agement techniques have been designed into the process-approach network of this quality management
system by the application of the most commonly used statistical tools. First, the entire process-
approach structure was laid out in line with cause-and-effect diagramming techniques. The fishhead
was titled: Quality System Variables. The ribs attached to the backbone were labeled as the
contributing core departments. The objective was to show interrelationships to cross-functional work
cells charged with aligning customer requirements in work processes upstream. Each work cell in each
core department was identified as a probable contributor to process variation in the chain of events.
Once this was done, tree diagrams were created separately for each core department showing each
work cell within the department and its workflow relationship within each other as well as to each
cross-functional work cell. The next move was the application of failure mode effect analysis (FMEA)
identifying in each work cell the critical to customer (CTC), critical to quality (CTQ), and critical to
process (CTP) requirements. When this was done, quality function deployment (QFD) procedures were
written for each work cell incorporating process ownership, responsibility, interaction, inter-
relationship, integration, process steps, performance measurement, corrective action alert as was
required by each work cell. This ensured that critical to customer, critical to quality, and critical to
process requirements were orderly flown down from each work cell until each process cycle was
completed in the closed-loop system arrangement. Then, the various forms were designed and
integrated with each work cell’s requirement in order to record performance data as proof of work
results measurement and demonstration of compliance. Finally, the quality manual was written to bring
cohesion, linkage and system integration into focus in line with ISO 9001/2000 requirements. The
quality function deployment (QFD) procedures have been renamed as Quality Objective Procedures
(QOP) to bring about common usage of  “quality objectives” applied throughout in the ISO Standard.
For the same reason “documented procedures” have been renamed as Quality Operating Procedures
(QOP). This process-approach quality management system is comprised of 12 Quality Operating
Procedures and 209 Quality Objective Procedures. These procedures are shown in two separately but
identically laid out matrices: Flowcharts in Book Section One and Text in Book Section Three.
It’s no accident that this book is titled “Process-Approach Quality Management System.”
Let’s break the title down in order to understand what’s involved here.
System
“System” means that I have built into it the management commitments, responsibilities,
and the quality objectives to direct the effective operation and maintenance of the quality
system. To make the management system an interactive organizational network, I have

          
                                          BOOK SUMMARY   505
created the quality objective procedures in order to communicate and implement the
commitments and responsibilities to support the achievement of the network’s quality
objectives. Then, I interlinked them with the quality system’s processes. I did this in
order to flow down customer requirements to the relevant work assignments, focusing the
activities within each work cell in the overall network in one direction, the simultaneous
achievement of product quality, cost control, continuous improvement and customer
satisfaction. First, I have expressed the quality objective requirements for the quality
system in policy statements under the Quality Manual’s processes. Second, I have created
the quality objective procedures to allow the implementation, control, and maintenance of
these objectives. Third, I have designed the forms to enable the employees to record work
results to prove the achievement of these quality objectives. This is the triad within which
all the quality system’s objectives have been planned and documented to ensure customer
satisfaction, internally and externally.
I have done something else that the reader might pass over without recognizing it. Every
requirement identified in the Quality Manual and implemented through the Quality
Objective Procedures has been painstakingly subjected to the plan-do-check-act provi-
sions of TQM to prevent the migration of hidden variables from work cell to work cell.
Every business owner’s goal should be that the objectives of his/her quality manage-
ment system be so implemented that a contracted product could be put through the
manufacturing cycle the first time without problems. That is also the primary goal of this
process-approach system. Since every source of error can be identified as a variance that
could, to a degree, negatively impact every activity, it makes a lot of sense to remove it at
the initial stages of every planning process. Every quality objective procedure in this
book contains provisions to observe and remove variables through monitoring and
corrective action enforcement, hence ensuring continuous improvement.
We should realize as we read the quality objective procedures in this book that I am
controlling the processes of the integrated system not in a here-and-there fashion, but
constructively right from the beginning – the contract phase of a manufacturing business.
This is the area where I have done some very serious initial planning to ensure that
customer requirements are flown down to the responsible work cells. Had I not done it
here, I would have been doomed later, for I would have lost cost control, the discipline to
stay within the quoted figures of the job. It would not have been enough that I put in all
kinds of procedures to maintain control over the defined processes and left out the
requirement to tie them to the allocated cost figures of a project. It was in this area where
the Plan-Do-Check-Act theory played a major role for me. Applying the PDCA theory
ensured the removal of the deficiency contributors from the whole processing cycle that
would otherwise have robbed me blind from being able to realize any profit that I had
calculated making when I quoted the job. All of these requirements that have been
carefully woven into the procedures of this process-approach system may be taken for
granted by the reader at implementation time. Don’t!
Procedures written to enable us to control the quality management system in this book are
not the run-of-the-mill SOPs. The way traditional SOPs are written, they don’t allow us

506   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
to enforce the dynamic nature of an integrated process control system, for they lack the
definition of continuity, process owners’ accountability, system integration, linkage and
flow-down description of requirements. Therefore, I have planned all these into this
process-approach quality management system. This is how the dynamics of the presented
system removes the common and hidden mistakes that plague conventional quality
systems. What we have here are value added, targeted objectives to accomplish a
schedule-based quality delivery system. This is a monitored system that sustains itself
through the continuous and effective work discipline of the organization. How? By the
clearly defined work assignments, process instructions, identified responsibilities, process
ownership, and integrated flow processes. But, the system is also designed so that modi-
fication to it can be rather easily accomplished to suit one’s circumstances without
upsetting the basic document and control structure.
Management
Management in this process-approach quality system, regardless of its executive position,
is also a process owner of all the business and quality objectives that it has established
and documented for its employees to observe in the product’s realization processes. Its
attention, foremost, is focused to ensure that all the stated objectives for the business and
quality are consistently maintained, as documented. Ownership in my case means having
certain responsibilities assigned individually, or shared, or delegated. Whatever the case,
I have identified and stated them in writing. Accountability, according to responsibility,
I’m enforcing through process instructions everywhere. System cohesion plays a major
roll in cementing the continuing processes together and focusing process owner’s
attention on product quality, cost control, and continuous improvement. This is how
internal and external customer requirements have been imbedded in the continuing
processes toward product realization within the documented system. This process-
approach system is communicated within the organization by the observance of the
documented quality objective procedures, tailored to manage core departmental
operations in contract manufacturing environments. The completely integrated system
requires management’s full participation in order to realize its business goals.
Quality
The word ‘Quality’ is not used in this process approach-system in a limited sense –
checking parts. Furthermore, it is not applied as an ‘insert’ to plug up gaps, here-and-
there, created by system deficiencies. ‘Quality’ here is the controlling mechanism of
management policies in a manufacturing environment, encompassing Total Quality
Management (TQM) for directed and targeted objectives for the maintenance of product
quality, cost control, continuous improvement and customer satisfaction. These system
drivers are woven into the fibers of the process approach-system presented in this book.
‘Quality’ here is a definition of clearly defined policy objectives for all the identified
process owners with identified responsibilities and assignments.
In this process-approach quality management system, I have documented the process
control procedures so that the instructions in them unearth the hidden mistakes in a
continuous fashion as the assignments flow from the beginning to the end of a process
within the integrated system. This is where this process-approach system rips apart

          
                                          BOOK SUMMARY   507
conventional systems relying on major system repair procedures to correct here-and-there
the system deficiencies that I am correcting in the whole system through the application
of process controls.
It’s worth observing the totality of the presented process approach mechanism as to how,
as a whole, I have interlinked the targeted core departmental objectives of a contract
manufacturing operation to achieve product quality and continuous improvement through
interactive processes within the framework of the quality management system. The key to
how I have been able to accomplish this was predicated on interactive communication.
Broadening the system to include additional business objectives of the organization
would require similar interaction within the system. This process-approach system
presents an accurate framework to do that.
Today, the application of the word quality is more advertised than it ever has been. It
seems that there is a quality face to everything we do. And that’s perfectly okay. But,
there is a problem. Unless the acceptance boundaries for quality requirements are
defined, we will always be pursuing subjective quality – everybody interprets it his/her
own way. And this is essentially the major problem with conventional quality systems,
where responsibilities to assignments are not clearly identified and defined to indicate
acceptance boundaries of those assignments. It poses a critical problem of how to
measure work performance. It was for this reason that I broke with the past and designed
my Quality Objective Procedures.
So, ‘Quality’ in this process approach system also defines the acceptance boundaries of
all the activities, expressed in the documented management system, whether it is to
control the overall quality system performance or the increments thereof. What I was
very careful of, however, was that I didn’t impose tolerance boundaries without con-
sidering value to the processes I was controlling, for cost overrun would have resulted.
Process-Approach
Don’t let reality escape your attention regarding the meaning and application of process-
approach. Although the compound word ‘process-approach’ is totally new in quality
systems, it has been practiced by some industries for a long time in a limited way without
defining its overall implication. ISO 9001/2000 clearly defines its meaning without
shedding any light on how to interface it within a controlled system. Without calling it
‘process-approach,’ civilizations practiced it ever since man had intelligence. Doing
things correctly, systematically, consistently and in an integrated fashion, requires a
lesson-learned process from each of us. This is the developmental process. After that,
process-approach will become second nature to us as we repeat our actions. We will
recognize from the practice that everything we do has a natural flow to it in the
established order. It does not have to be an organization to prove this out, for every one
of us applies process-approach to accomplish daily routines. But, because we got used to
doing it every day, we forget about the process of doing it. On the other hand, try to teach
your own kid correctly about something you are doing. You would most certainly think
out the step by step plans (the process-approach) as to how to implement the process of
teaching. Wouldn’t this be an easier task for you to achieve, if you already had it on

508   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
paper? Organizations are the same way. The difference is that instead of one individual,
they have many. Therefore, they need to integrate their process-approach to achieve
acceptable results. This is where this book becomes essential.
Process-approach methods can be systematically identified and implemented, yet
dismally ineffective from the lack of system integration and cohesion. I can tell you this
from my own experience. The lack of a fully documented and integrated procedural
quality system is the surest way to introduce hidden mistakes by anybody and at any
point into a product’s flow cycle. I used to detect these hidden mistakes at final
inspection after the product was already completed. Many times, I traced these hidden
defects to either engineering or to contracts, and even to the customers and subcon-
tractors. Without a documented system to put corrective action into effect, I ended up
sorting the product every time the order was repeated. Inadequate planning, human
errors, negligence and disregard for process controls all played into the hand of creating
roadblocks. To overcome these problems, I have integrated an interactive documented
system to completely implement corrective action upstream/downstream in this quality
management system. I have been able to accomplish this through the implementation of a
locked-in corrective/preventive action system.
Many companies to some extent have process-approach resemblance in operation,
because, realistically, that is the shortest distance between the beginning and end points
of a process cycle. The trouble is that it is not practiced shop-wide and integrated with all
the other product-related assignments through documented procedures. It is, therefore,
lacking in organizational cohesion that would otherwise bind commitments to actions to
consistently focus on achieving the many quality objectives of a process-approach
throughput system. The overall interconnected flow process is a primary requirement in
any type of effectively operated process-approach system, for where one process ends the
other must logically follow until the cycle is completed. This was the primary reason
why I have placed so much importance in the orderly layout and integration of the
controlling system, preventing variations in processes by first employing statistical tools.
The benefits of a clearly defined, implemented, and maintained process-approach quality management
system can only be realized when we compare it to what’s lacking in traditional quality systems that rob
dollars from the bottom line. Traditional quality systems are:
• 
Lacking in organizational focus on throughput process controls;
• 
Lacking in process ownership – the responsibility, accountability, and performance measurement;
• 
Lacking in upstream/downstream document control;
• 
Lacking in clearly defined product quality objectives right from the job’s beginning;
• 
Lacking in communicating the overall product quality requirements for the throughput cycle;
• 
Lacking an integrated structure to maintain shop-wide corrective action to cure deficiencies, thus the
continuous improvement tools;
• 
Lacking the documented structural system to maintain cohesion and interaction and integration in line
with customer requirements from the beginning to the end in the product’s flow-cycle.
This list could go on and on, but that’s not what the point is. The point is that we should apply more the
most commonly used statistical tools in the implementation of quality management systems in order to
identify and control the cross-functionally hidden common- and special-cause variables that could
negatively impact the achievement of every quality objective of the management system. In your hand is a
model to follow that does not require six sigma calculations before you can implement it. I already did the
preliminary work for you through the application of the above mentioned statistical tools.

IDENTIFICATION OF NEW REQUIREMENTS
                 ISO 9001/2000
In part one, we find two types of amendments identified and presented, the completely
new and the complementary requirements. All are add-on requirements to ISO 9001/
1994. With the incorporation of these changes, the ’94 edition became obsolete and the
year 2000 edition took effect on December 13th, 2000. A three-year grace period is
allowed by the new standard for the registered companies to change over from the old to
the new standard.
The composition of ISO 9001/2000 is not at all similar to ISO 9001/1994. The new
standard bases its requirements on Total Quality Management (TQM) and the application
of P-D-C-A (Plan-Do-Check-Act) principles within the embodiment of process-approach
quality management. The declarations of requirements are stark and repetitive and can be
easily misunderstood by those lacking quality management experience. Therefore, we can
expect different interpretations and implementations even within the same industry
sector. There are no formal publications available on the market at this time, besides this
book, that will explain and implement a quality management system based on process-
approach quality management.
Quality documents that were designed to implement the ’94 standard will need
considerable conversion to meet the requirements of the new standard. Updating the
quality manual will present very little conversion impediment, for master models can
already be purchased as easily as the military standards were. The measurable objectives
and the interactively integrated quality objective processes to fulfill internal and external
customer requirements of the new standard will necessitate, however, the creation of
quality objective procedures. Patching up the current and traditional Standard Operating
Procedures will not truly accomplish the measurable quality objective criteria of the new
standard. They don’t contain the measurable process objective criteria, the linkage of
interrelated processes and activities, and the organizational integration to allow process-
based continual improvements to be effectively carried out. The reader, this time, has a
choice. Follow the patchwork process already pushed by the consulting world, or follow
the process-approach model presented in this book that ensures effective operation and
control.
I have identified below eleven completely new changes for which there are no equivalent
requirements in ISO 9001/1994 and eighteen complementary requirements. The com-
pletely new changes are italicized. The tabulation of clauses below does not include those
clauses of the new standard where there are no basic changes encountered from the ’94
standard, although the entire text is completely reworded in the year 2000 standard for

510   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
each clause. Each change is not only explained below, but also implemented to indicate
how compliance with the new standard is accomplishable through the use of this book.
Part two of this appendix will list what has been either reduced or contracted from ISO
9001/1994 and not made a requirement in ISO 9001/2000. The user can either operate
his/her quality system with or without them. For the manufacturing industry, I do not
recommend hasty abridgment of previously imposed requirements without examining the
impact first, for it would impede the effective operation of the quality management
system. With these reductions and/or contractions, the new standard went out of its way
to accommodate the service industry at the expense of the manufacturing sector. The
reverse was the case in the ’94 standard.
PART ONE
   
                         NEW REQUIREMENTS
CLAUSE
4.2             DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
4.2.1          GENERAL
Document the quality management system’s processes to
               ensure effective planning, operation and control
                  COMMENTS
       There was no explicit requirement for “effective operation and control”
                   imposed in ISO 9001/94 under clause 4.2.2
                   The effective operation and control of a quality management system means
                   that quality management takes place under a documented procedural system.
                   What we must be foremost concerned with, however, is that when creating a
                   documented system, we don’t stifle efficiency with it. We can be so effective-
                   ly controlling everything through documented means that we short cut effici-
                   ency, thus driving up production cost. The new standard leaves all this out of
                   the picture for the organization to worry about it. And we do. One way to do
                   this is to write Quality Objective Procedures (QOPs) to control the processes
                   (elements) of the quality management system through process instructions,
                   less the work methods associated with it. Leave the work methods to be docu-
                   mented and controlled through the Job Travelers and Operation Sheets.
                    The work methods are dependent on the competency level of the process
                    owners who carry out the tasks under a defined process. While the work
                    methods may change from operator to operator performing the same task, the
                    process instructions will remain the same for everybody. This way, the pro-
                    cess instructions will control the achievement of the identified quality objec-
                    tives’ processes without interfering with the efficiency requirements of pro-
 1

                                                                                                                                                      
                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   511
                    duction. We will also keep the third party auditors at bay from interfering
                    with the methods of operation. Effectiveness would now be demonstrated
                    through process control in line with process instructions for the realization of
                    each quality objective.
What to do:
One way to prove effective operation and control is through measuring the
                    work results of the quality system’s objectives. How to go about it must be
                    defined in the quality manual. Please go to the quality manual now (book
                    page 276) and observe under clauses 4.2.1 and 4.2.2 how this requirement
                    has been integrated into the overall documented system.
4.2.2       QUALITY MANUAL
                 Any exclusion dealing with ISO requirements shall be iden-
                 tified and justified. Define interaction between processes.
                 COMMENTS
                    Clause 4.2.1 of ISO 9001/94 did not have these requirements.
        What we have to remember here is that exclusions are limited only to the
        product realization processes. Clause 7 of ISO 9001/2000 defines what these
        processes are. Conformity to the standard should not be claimed if the exclu-
        sions exceed those that are permitted. See clause 1.2 in the new standard.
        The definition of interaction between processes is nothing less than integ-
        rating the activities of the organization within the quality management sys-
        tem.
      What to do:
       The easiest way to claim exclusions is to justify them in the body of your
       current quality manual where the exclusions would normally apply (see book
       pages 278 and 289). I also made a general remark about it under clause 4.2.1
       in the quality manual (pg 276). To describe the interaction requirement, I
       have used two words ‘process-approach.’ See book page number 270, clause
             1.0 (Scope).

     MANAGEMENT RESPONSIBILITY
5.1            MANAGEMENT COMMITMENT
                 Provide evidence of commitment to the development and
                 improvement of the quality management system:

512   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
a) communicating the importance of meeting customer, regulatory
and statutory requirements
b) establishing the quality policy and
c) quality objectives (measurable)
d) conducting management reviews
e) ensuring resources
      COMMENTS
                    Most of these requirements were covered in ISO 9001/94 under clauses
                    4.1.1; 4.1.2.2; 4.1.3 except: communicating the importance of meeting
                    customer, regulatory and statutory requirements; and establishing quality
                    objectives
      Evidence of Commitment:
       Evidence of commitment will be demonstrated through the effectiveness of
       the implemented system, showing compliance with the imposed require-
       ments through measuring work results and maintaining continual improve-
       ment. For this to take place, the quality objectives of the management system
       must be cohesively interconnected through the mechanics of written commu-
       nication. This way, all employees will have the same understanding of what it
       means to fulfill customer, statutory and regulatory requirements. Interconnec-
       tion means process integration, flow-down of requirements upstream/down-
       stream within the documented system to ensure effective linkage between
       processes. We communicate this through written procedures to enable us to
       realize completion of the quality objectives within a closed-loop process
       arrangement. Communication under ISO 9001/2000 is the means to relay
       information to support the effective operation and control of the quality man-
       agement processes. Commitments are achieved through the enforcement of
       written procedures.
      What to do:
       Amend your current quality manual in line with clause 4.1.1 (Quality policy)
       of ISO 9001/1994 to include the required commitments. Please go to book
       page 273 and read clause 4.1.1 to see how I have enfolded all these commit-
       ments in one paragraph. What we need to remember here is not that we have
       written these commitments down, but that we must live up to them in the
       overall scheme of the documented quality system. (You may want to read one
       more time ‘Evidence of  Commitment,’ above.)
      Quality Objectives:
       In manufacturing the identification, documentation, implementation and
       maintenance of quality objectives are central to the framework of the quality
       management system. The various activities involved in complying with cus-
       tomer, statutory and regulatory requirements should be implemented through
       the quality objective definitions in the work assignments. This should include

                                                                                                                                                      
                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   513
      all those requirements we had in the ’94 standard, plus the new requirements
      imposed by the year 2000 standard, allowing for justified exclusions (see
      clause 4.2.2a).
      We can include all the functions and levels within the organization, or just
      limit the quality objective criteria to the core departmental activities as most
      of us did it under the ’94 standard. The core departmental activities include
      the following departments: Contracts, Engineering, Purchasing, Production
      Planning, Manufacturing, and Quality. (This is also the centerpiece of clause 7
      (Product Realization) of the year 2000 standard.) My recommendation is: first,
      stay with the core departmental responsibilities as this is the backbone of the
      organization. Manage your shop first because this is where most of the quality
      problems are converged. Add other functions later, as needed.
      Identify all those quality objectives that are needed to cover all aspects that
      relate to the core departmental functions and levels. Aim for the maximum
      number of standard quality objectives conventional to your type of industry.
      This way, you will have procedures to cover the requirements of the high-tech
      industry in your field of operation as well. This is exactly what I did also.
     What to do:
      The best way I can help you in determining quality objectives is to ask you to
      read mine. I have identified twelve (12) main quality objectives in this book.
      These are titled: Quality Operating Procedures. To keep paperwork down to a
      minimum, I have combined other similar quality objectives under one Quality
      Operating Procedure (QOP). Please go to book page 357 and see how all the
      inspection related objectives are enfolded and integrated in QOP 006. Other
      QOPs followed the same layout as much as the subject matters allowed.
5.2         CUSTOMER FOCUS
                Top management shall ensure that customer requirements are
                determined and are met to enhance customer satisfaction
                COMMENTS
                   These requirements were covered in ISO 9001/94 under clause 4.3 (Con-
                   tract Review), but without process and quality objective criteria. (See clause
                   5.4.1 and 5.4.2 of ISO 9001/2000.)
                   Note: Customer satisfaction is the main theme in ISO 9001/2000.
       For a business to survive in today’s competitive environment, satisfying cus-
       tomer needs and expectations must be the foremost commitment of top man-
       agement. The year 2000 standard has given us the requirements around which
       to create an integrated process-approach quality management system in order
       to fulfill the customers’ needs and expectations. In order to make this happen,
 4

514   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
       the many processes (elements) of the quality management system dealing
       with this criteria must be interlinked and cohesively integrated to create the
       effective interaction between departmental work assignments and focus them
       in one direction, customer satisfaction. Defining the quality criteria for every
       process and product related work assignment, and identifying the process
       owner of each, will bring about fulfilling customer requirements through
       process instructions. Fulfilling customer satisfaction must hinge on communi-
       cating the necessary information to the internal customers first. Process in-
       structions detailing the steps of the processes for every quality objective will
       do that. In this particular case, the internal customers are those employees
       handling the contract activities, the external customer’s requirements. These
       requirements will impact eventually just about everybody in the chain of
       events, known as the product realization processes. This then is the first
       department where we must establish controls as to how the external custom-
       ers’ needs and expectations are determined and converted into requirements.
      What to do:
       Amend your current quality manual under clause 4.3 (Contract Review) and
       indicate that customer needs and expectations are fulfilled by the implemen-
       tation of applicable Quality Objective Procedures. Give references in the
       manual to the applicable procedures. Please go now to book page 278 and
       observe there how I have handled this add-on requirement. Observe also the
       beginnings of the interactive processes coming to life by the tools of integra-
       tion in Quality Operating Procedure 001, referenced under the same clause.
       Read it in its entirety, all four sections of QOP 001, beginning on book page
       295. For ease of process flow and better understanding of what’s going on
       here, please go to the equivalent diagrammatic procedure located on book
       page 38. This entire QOP sets the stage for integrating work responsibilities
       downstream. Without it, the whole organization would have a tough job un-
       derstanding the external customer requirements as they impact the continuing
       processes in the product realization cycle.
5.3           QUALITY POLICY
                The quality policy must include commitments to meeting
                requirements and to continual improvement (b)
                The quality policy must provide a framework for establishing
                and reviewing quality objectives (c)
                The quality policy is reviewed for continuing suitability (e)
                COMMENTS
                   All requirements of clause 4.1.1 Quality Policy of ISO 9001/94 are retained.

                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   515
                   Plus, these three distinctly separate requirements have been added to clause
                   4.1.1 of the ’94 standard and enfolded with the others under clause 5.3 of the
                   new standard.
      Continual Improvement: (5.3b)
       The new standard implies that continual improvement is a process driven
       objective. How we are doing this strikes at the heart of how we are solving
       problems. Currently, we are backtracking from the end of the line to make
       improvements, instead of front-tracking to identify problems to eliminate
       variables. The backtracking methods indicate lack of process control while
       front-tracking indicates the opposite. The new standard requires process con-
       trol by monitoring the work processes (see clause 4.1e) and thus, maintaining
       continual improvement. Doing continual improvement through monitoring
       the realization processes confronts us with the creation of interactive proce-
       dures. This is not an easy task to consistently fulfill, for enacting continual
       improvement practices when and wherever problems manifest themselves
       involves controlling changes also, while preserving the integrity of opera-
       tions. Neither the backtracking nor the front-tracking methods work alone,
       but in combination. Continual improvement is always easier to implement
       after the problems have been found than before it. We must strive, therefore,
       to create procedures that can regulate the implementation of continual im-
       provements for both the front-tracking as well as the backtracking activities,
       because they impact each other at unknown levels in the product’s life-cycle.
      What to do:
       While the commitment for continual improvement should be stated in your
       current quality manual in line with clause 4.1.1 (Quality Policy) of the ’94
       standard, the implementation of it should take place in combination with
       process control procedures under clauses 4.10.3 (In-process Inspection and
       Testing) and 4.13 (Controlling Non-conforming Product). To illustrate how
       this has been implemented and integrated in a manufacturing environment,
       please go to book page 374 (Process Control, Section Three of QOP 006) and
       read there how corrective action is enforced to maintain continual improve-
       ment in the various realization processes (front-tracking). To maintain full
       documentation of corrective actions for system-wide continual improve-
       ments, please read QOP 009 (Control of Non-conforming Product on book
       page 403), all three sections apply (for both front- and backtracking).
      Framework for Quality Objectives: (5.3c)
       Quality objectives are identified from the various processes (elements) of the
       standard. We convert these to requirements and list them in sequential
       order under the various clauses in our quality manual. This is the first part of
       the framework. The second part is when we create the Quality Objective Pro-
       cedures (QOPs) to enable us to fulfill these requirements. And the third part
       of the framework is when we design the appropriate forms to prove work
       results. This should create an interactive chain of events. When interlinked

516   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
       in a logical order, the elements of the framework should present an orderly
       alignment of the quality system’s processes, which in turn, should identify the
       quality objectives, implemented through the application of the various quality
       operating procedures. By establishing this type of structural framework, not
       only the quality objectives, but also the interrelated process instructions can
       be consistently communicated between the various functions and levels with-
       in the organization. By creating this type of framework, expansion or contrac-
       tion of quality requirements could be accomplished in an orderly manner
       without corrupting the integrity of the quality management system.
      What to do:
       The structural framework of a quality management system depends on how
       the creator of it determined the systematically interactive processes within the
       functions and levels of the organization. I have created mine in line with the
       same scenario given above for shop quality management in manufacturing. In
       order to understand what is involved here, please spend some time in review-
       ing the entire integrated system presented in this book. Start with the quality
       manual, proceed with the operating procedures, and conclude by understand-
       ing the application of the different forms. Guide yourself by observing link-
       age to interactions and controls. They are applied to ensure that each quality
       objective is achieved to satisfy organizational commitments for product quali-
       ty, customer satisfaction, and continual improvement.
       The first step is to generally state the “framework” requirement in the quality
       manual in line with clause 4.1.1 (Quality Policy) of the ’94 standard. No spe-
       cific procedure is required, for this is a declaration as to how the framework
       requirement will be developed later. For practical advice regarding construc-
       tion methods, please go to page 16 in the ‘Guidance Section’ of this book
       and read clauses 2.0 through 9.0. Then go to book page 64 and read Section
       Two of QOP 002 (Training Metrics) to see how it is actually done.
      Continuing Suitability: (5.3e)
       Continuing suitability invokes the first question we should always ask our-
       selves in quality management. Do I have all the controlling procedures in
       place to satisfy product quality, customer satisfaction, and continual improve-
       ment requirements for my established customers. If the answer is “No,” your
       quality system will not meet the ISO 9001/2000 requirements. It will not even
       meet the business goals of your company, regardless of ISO. Continuing
       suitability is to provide adequate quality support by which to enforce every
       quality objective deemed necessary in your type of business, taking into
       consideration that not every customer imposes the same quality requirement.
       In this light, you should have all the standard quality objectives documented
       and integrated into your system so that even the most stringent high-tech re-
       quirement would be covered in your type of business. Continuing suitability
       not only means just to fulfill the minimum product quality requirements, but
       also means that you advance your company’s business aspirations to be able

                                                                                                                                                      
                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   517
       to fulfill the quality requirements of new business in your field of operation.
       As an example, take a good look at what I have included in my Quality Oper-
       ating Procedures to cover just about every circumstance possible in shop-
       quality management, regarding product related quality enforcement. Do I
       need them all at the same time? Of course not. But when I do, I can satisfy
       my customers’ needs and expectations at the moment of asking. I have in this
       book more than 209 quality objectives in documented procedures, both text
       and flowchart format, completely integrated for your immediate implementa-
       tion, study, conversion or just reference. Continuing suitability should always
       be measured with futuristic outlook if you want to beat the competition.
      What to do:
       Likewise, add to your current quality manual under clause 4.1.1 (Quality
       Policy) that “continuing suitability” is a policy requirement. I have provided
       you with enough information to realize how important this requirement is for
       the future of your business. Aim for the maximum quality objectives possible
       in your business and be forward looking. There are no rules on the books
       against it.
5.4
PLANNING
5.4.1 
QUALITY OBJECTIVES
Ensure that quality objectives are established at relevant func-
tions and levels, and are measurable and consistent with the
quality policy, including the need to meet the requirements of
product
                 COMMENTS
                 This is a completely new requirement. It belongs under clause 4.2.3 Quality
                    Planning of 9001/94. The emphasis is on measurable objectives at relevant
                    functions and levels of the organization.
        Identifying Quality Objectives
       Work assignments encompassing the activities of functions and levels within
        the organization are those through which we interactively fulfill the internal
        and external customer requirements. In each of these work assignments the
        possibility of error or mistake is real, and we transfer them from process to
        process during the chain of process realizations. In order to stop this from
        happening, we write procedures with clear process instructions and tell the
        process owners of these assignments that we want them to check their work
        results to ensure that they meet the following … quality requirements. As-
        signments with imposed quality requirements become the quality objectives
        of the management system. In a nutshell, they become quality objectives
 8

518   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
        because there are quality requirements added to them.
        The quality requirements ensure that mistakes are not transferred from
        process to process and further ensure that the work assignment is carried out
        to meet both the process and the quality requirement at the same time. The
        year 2000 standard requires that quality objectives are planned and estab-
        lished at relevant levels and functions within the organization, providing
        measurable results. So, if we integrate all the work assignments process after
        process, we have created an interactive system that should have built-in
        features to link commitments to quality objectives with measurable results
        from the beginning to the end in a product’s life-cycle. This is essentially the
        meaning of this clause.
      What to do:
       Since this is a completely new requirement, add sub-clauses to your current
       quality manual in line with clause 4.2.3 (Quality Planning) of the ’94 stan-
       dard and state your reasoning in a similar fashion as I have discussed it
       above. Better yet, turn to book page 277 and look up how I have satisfied this
       seemingly enigmatic requirement. The implementation of what this clause
       wants us to do cannot be achieved through writing one procedure to take care
       of all its provisions. It requires that all the quality system’s procedures co-
       hesively integrate the intent declared in this clause. This requires serious
       quality planning which we will discuss under the next clause.
5.4.2       QUALITY MANAGEMENT SYSTEM PLANNING
                 Plan, identify, and document the processes and resources
                 needed to achieve the quality objectives in line with clause 4.1
                    COMMENTS
                    Planning, identifying, and documenting to achieve the quality management
                    system’s processes (objectives), including continual improvement, were not
                    an explicit requirement of ISO 9001/94 under clause 4.2.3, but we did it
                    in some measure anyway, since a quality manual without planning to achieve
                    the quality objectives would be a worthless document. This time around, the
                    requirement is clearly stated under four separate clauses. This clause is about
                    general planning, while the other three are tied to specific objectives.
 
7.1 
Plan product realization, product verification and validation processes;
          7.3.1   Plan design and/or development processes;
8.1 
Plan the measurement and monitoring of products, processes, perfor-
          mance and customer satisfaction.
           Regardless how the Standard dished out the planning requirements, Quality
                    Planning should embrace the entire quality management system’s processes,
 9

                                                                                                                                                      
                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   519
                    for these processes must work together within one system. Interconnected
                    they must be for a common purpose, satisfying internal and external cus-
                    tomer requirements. At the end, every quality objective must achieve its
                    purpose in cohesion with other quality objectives to consistently achieve
                    effective operations. This is really the purpose of a process-approach quality
                    management system.
                    Although the year 2000 standard requires planning to be undertaken under
                    four separate clauses, the job still boils down to one comprehensively co-
                    ordinated planning effort to bring about one cohesively integrated and
                    controlled quality system. Each of these different planning clauses deal with
                    different objectives, but when taken together, they have one central purpose:
                    the creation of the necessary controlling documents to ensure the effective
                    operation of the quality management system. These different controlling
                    documents serve as instructional materials to be followed by all the process
                    owners at all functions and levels to ensure the fulfillment of each and every
                    quality objective we have designed into the quality management system’s
                    processes.
Trying to address each of these planning provisions individually, without
                    realizing their interactive nature within the whole quality management
                    system, would give us one hell of a convoluted system without focus. We
                    should remember, these planning declarations mean nothing, unless we can
                    convert and reduce them to the shop floor and apply them sensibly and con-
                    sistently in the product’s realization processes.
What to do:
        Amend and/or add sub-clauses to your current quality manual in line with
        clause 4.2.3 (Quality Planning, ISO 9001/94) to include the ‘Quality
        Planning’ objectives. Make references to the applicable procedures that
        implement and maintain these activities. Please go to book page 277 and
        observe there how I have brought together the planning activities under one
        clause. Then, look up any of the referenced procedures in order to understand
        how I have implemented them in the shop. The equivalent QOPs found
        under ‘Training Metrics’ will flowchart the implementation of every quality
        objective needed to manage shop quality practices in manufacturing.
                    Ensure that change (updating) is done in a controlled manner
                 while the integrity of the quality management system at the
                 same time is maintained
                    COMMENTS
                    The emphasis regarding change (updating) is that it is done in a controlled
                    manner and that the integrity of the quality management system is main-
                    tained during this change. This requirement is a lot more than just document
                    change control under clause 4.5.3 in ISO 9001/94. It applies to change (up-
 10

520   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
                    dating) made anywhere in the quality management system. This is flow-
                    down control of changes upstream/downstream in the quality management
                    system. This requirement embraces the control of customer related docu-
                    ments as well.
       What to do:
        Managing change control in the quality management system’s documents
                    requires special planning and documented procedures, for it could impact
                    every aspect of the product realization processes, including the customer. For
                    this reason, I have consolidated this effort under ‘Document and Data Con-
                    trol,’ clause 4.5 of the ’94 standard and made reference to the controlling
                    documents implementing change requirements. The complexity involved in
                    managing change control cannot be expressed here in a few words. For this
                    reason, I ask you to go directly to book page number 279 and see there what
                    the quality manual says, and then go to the referenced procedures to study
                    the extensive controlling requirements involved with managing changes.
5.5.2       MANAGEMENT REPRESENTATIVE
                Ensure that the management representative promotes the
                awareness of customer requirements throughout the organiza-
                tion
                COMMENTS
                   This requirement has been added to the management representative’s other
                   requirements under clause 4.1.3 of ISO 9001/94 and carried over to the new
                   standard under the subject clause.
       Promoting awareness of customer requirements, first of all, should happen
       through the availability of information at specified work cells, using the
       applicable procedures that we have created to fulfill customer requirements.
       Secondly, it should happen through the general training of new and estab-
       lished employees. Thirdly, it should happen when we implement continuous
       improvements resulting from corrective/preventive actions. Important to
       understand here is that the awareness information is communicated in a con-
       tinuous and purposeful fashion, dependent on the specific and general needs
       to understand requirements, employee by employee. We don’t promote
       awareness of customer requirements on a loud-speaker (intercom), but rather
       from the documented processes of the quality management system. Not every
       employee will have a need to know all the specifics of the whole quality man-
       agement system. But they will have to know first, how they, individually,
       contribute to meeting customer requirements. Second, they will have to know
       the general workings of the quality management system.

                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   521
      What to do:
       Add a statement in your current quality manual under the “Management
       Representative” responsibilities in line with clause 4.1.3 of ISO 9001/94 and
       define there how he/she will undertake promoting the awareness of customer
       requirements. Since this is a policy declaration, no specific documented
       procedure is needed. Please go to book page number 276 and see there how I
       have simplified the inclusion of this responsibility.
5.5.3       INTERNAL COMMUNICATION
                Ensure internal communication and its effectiveness through-
                out the organization regarding the processes of the quality
                management system
                    COMMENTS
                    This new requirement is both oral and written dissemination of information,
                    regarding the entire documented quality management system’s policies,
                    procedures, objectives, data, records, and instructions. It has everything to do
                    with bringing the documented system together in a logical framework so that
                    communication is targeted where needed. This is the integrating mechanism
                    (referencing), the structural network, ensuring that the written stuff is effec-
                    tively linked upstream/downstream within the quality management system
                    and brought to the source where the information is needed by the appropriate
                    personnel assigned to achieve quality objectives.
      What to do:
        Since this is a completely new requirement, add a sub-clause under Quality
        Planning in line with clause 4.2.3 of the ISO 9001/94 standard and state there
        how internal communication will be achieved. A separate documented proce-
        dure is not required by ISO 9001/2000. Please see book page number 278,
        clause 4.2.3k, and observe there how I have inserted this requirement. If you
        wish to become familiar with how to convey relevant data needed to guide
        people to targeted information, please see how I did it. The whole book is
        full of it. And if you like it, don’t hesitate to follow it. This is more of an ex-
        perience driven art than a college course, although both should be pursued to
        be effective in the skills of communication.

       MANAGEMENT REVIEW
5.6.1 
GENERAL
                 Assess the need for changes to the organization’s quality
                 management system, including policy and quality objectives,
                 to ensure its continuing suitability, adequacy and effectiveness

522   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
                 COMMENTS
                    Clause 4.1.3 of ISO 9001/94 did have similar requirements for management
                    reviews, but without the specifics for “Review Input and Review Output.”
                    The evaluation of the quality management system is now focused on the
                    documented and implemented system to determine whether it had achieved
                    product quality requirements, problem prevention, continual improvement,
                    and customer satisfaction (see clause 1.1). Now that the processes of the
                    quality system have been implemented according to the lofty requirements of
                    the new standard, reference to it no longer is made as it was the case under
                    the ’94 standard. (So goes the futuristic interpretation of the new standard.)
                    If we design our quality management system based on the process-approach
                    definition of the year 2000 standard, we will be operating our quality system
                    to the requirements of quality objective procedures. Since quality objectives
                    shall be measurable (see clause 5.4.1), we will have to define in these proce-
                    dures what to measure and record. This brings up a couple of questions. Who
                    will do the measurement? When will the measurement be made? The new
                    standard is mute about these. (Futuristic in its presumption)
                    I can most assuredly say from my experience that a process-approach quality
                    management system has built-in controls to achieve product quality, problem
                    prevention, continual improvement, and customer satisfaction without ma-
                    nagement reviews. Management review under a process-approach quality
                    management system is handled as a quality objective, just like any other ma-
                    nagement meeting, part and parcel of the daily business process. You will
                    discover that I have written my quality objective procedures based on shop
                    reality, proactively and spontaneously responding to make changes to meet
                    the requirements of the product realization processes. The greatest enemy
                    against the periodic management reviews is the customer himself. He cannot
                    wait. The product must move together with the decision making process.
                    Changes resulting from the management review output must be concurrent
                    with the product’s realization processes. This is what experience tells us to
                    do. In this light, management reviews are frequently done.
                    The next clause “Review input” (5.6.2) will add confirming weight to the
                    above discussion as it lists the input requirements to management reviews.
                    The Standard puts forth for the assessment of system performance the most
                    relevant quality objectives that actually embody the attributes of success or
                    failure of the quality management system’s daily operations. This also con-
                    firms that we must write our quality objective procedures to support the
                    achievement of product quality, problem prevention, continual improvement,
                    and customer satisfaction as an ongoing part of the process realization cycle.
      What to do:
        Amend your current quality manual under “Management Review” in line

                                                                                                                                                      
                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   523
        with clause 4.1.3 of the ’94 standard and define there how you will conduct
        management reviews in accordance with the requirements stated in the new
        standard. Although there is no requirement for a documented procedure to
        conduct management reviews, the subject should be treated as a quality ob-
        jective and therefore, the whole review agenda should be formalized in a
        written procedure. Please see book page number 276 and observe there how I
        have stated the management review requirements in the quality manual.
        Then, see my quality objective procedure, QOP 011, book page numbers
        235 or 428, and observe how I have implemented this quality objective.
5.6.2         REVIEW INPUT
                 Review (by assessing) current performance and improvement
                 opportunities based on:
• Results of audits
• Customer feedback
• Process performance and product conformance
• Status of preventive/corrective actions
• Follow-up actions from previous reviews
• Changes impacting the system
• Improvement opportunities
                 COMMENTS
                    There is no equivalent requirement in ISO 9001/94 in clause 4.1.3.
        The review input criteria listed under this clause relates to those quality
        objective procedures through which we control the realization processes to
        meet internal and external customer requirements. If we had implemented a
        process approach quality management system based on the scenario ex-
        plained above under clause 5.6.1, we would be presenting to top manage-
        ment now the results of an effectively operating system. Customer feedback,
        process performance and product conformance, corrective/preventive ac-
        tions, follow-up actions, change controls and others are all objective require-
        ments in a correctly managed process-approach quality system. How to im-
        plement and fulfill these requirements should be defined in the applicable
        quality objective procedures. The internal audit results should provide top
        management not the problems it had found, but the improvements it had
        made in the processes, methods, and the products as a result of internal
        audits.
        The review input in our management review agenda should include an ad-
        ditional requirement to that of the new standard, − fulfillment of manage-
        ment responsibility.

       What to do:
       Please follow the same action as explained under clause 5.6.1 above.
5.6.3        REVIEW OUTPUT
                 The outputs from management reviews shall include actions:
• To improve effectiveness
• To improve customer related requirements
• Resource requirements
                 COMMENTS
                  There is no equivalent requirement in ISO 9001/94 under clause 4.1.3.
         The output results from management reviews are directly proportional to
         input results. The new standard requires that we conclude management
         reviews with action items relating to improving the quality management
         system and its processes, improving product related customer requirements,
         and determining resource needs to implement them. These requirements
         should be everyday achievements woven into the product realization pro-
         cesses and taken care of under process controls for the same reasons as ex-
         plained above under clause 5.6.1.
       What to do:
                          Please follow the same action as explained under clause 5.6.1 above.

       RESOURCE MANAGEMENT
6.2.2        COMPETENCE, AWARENESS AND TRAINING
                  Evaluate the effectiveness of training provided (c). Maintain
                  records (e). Ensure awareness of quality requirements
                  COMMENTS
                      These requirements were not in ISO 9001/94 under clause 4.18. (We must
                      differentiate between general and specific training.)
          Evaluation of the effectiveness of training is meant to test the understanding
          of quality requirements by certain employees engaged in specific work as-
          signments. The competency requirement of these employees should include
          understanding the quality requirements impacting their work assignments to
          maintain product quality. The method of test is optional so long as there is a
          record of the test results on file, case by case, to prove that it was done. The
           awareness requirement is repeated again. This was already discussed under

                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   525
                     clause 5.5.2 above.
       What to do:
        Amend your current quality manual under “Training” in line with clause 4.18
        of the ’94 standard. A documented procedure is not a requirement. Create a
        form suitable to record the test results of the employee evaluated. Please see
        book page number 289 as to how I have inserted the “evaluation” require-
        ment. See also the form on book page number 498 created to maintain record
        of it.
                  Ensure that employees are aware of the relevance and im-
                  portance of their activities and how they contribute to the
                  achievement of the quality objectives
        Comments
         Awareness of quality requirements in work assignments is meant to enact
         the requirements of quality objectives. Therefore, the procedures written for
         achieving quality objectives should include the process instructions in order
         that the employees understand the relevance and importance of the quality
         requirements pertaining to their work assignments. Then, when performance
         results are monitored, it would become evident whether the employee fol-
         lowed the process instructions or not in meeting the relevant quality require-
         ments. The subject of employee awareness is highly dependent on enforcing
         internal communication, which we have already discussed under clause
         5.5.3 above. Next, employee awareness to understand requirements was also
         the topic of discussion under ‘Management Representative,’ clause 5.5.2
         above. Please go back and refresh your mind, now that the new standard
         keeps on reiterating the same requirement under this clause.
       What to do:
        Amend your current quality manual under “Training” in line with clause 4.18
        of the ’94 standard and insert  the “awareness” requirement (see book page
        number 289). A documented procedure is not a requirement. You will be
        amazed as I tell you how seriously I believe in training process owners to
        understand process and product related quality requirements. I have devoted
        approximately 230 pages of flowcharts in this book for that cause.
        (See ‘Training Metrics’ starting on book page number 42.)

WORK ENVIRONMENT
       Determine and manage the work environment needed to
                 achieve conformity of product

526   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
                  COMMENTS
        The emphasis is on “conformity of product.” Any Health and Safety rules
                     are relevant only within the meaning of conformity of the product. This re-
                          quirement is a rephrasing of “suitable working environment” under clause
                      4.9 (b) of ISO 9001/94.
         This clause drives home the fact that the work environment should be a safe
         place to achieve product conformity. OSHA and EPA violations alone may
         not be a cause for noncompliance reporting by ISO third party auditors. But,
         if the violation prevents the achievement of product conformity, there is a
         valid reason for requiring corrective action. Safety related requirements that
         are part of meeting product conformity should be defined in the Job Travel-
         ers and/or Operation Sheets, product by product and process by process, as
         they are applicable to the work assignment.
         For general information, all safety requirements should be posted on bulletin
         boards as well as on equipment. Employee awareness regarding safety rules
         should be top priority during training sessions. Evidence to this effect
         should be recorded and signed by all employees on a ‘Signature Sheet.’
         This, of course, is not a requirement of ISO 9001/2000.
        What to do:
          Amend your current quality manual under the “Process Control” provisions
          in line with clause 4.9b of the ’94 standard. Insert there how you will ensure
          compliance with this requirement. A documented procedure is not a re-
          quirement. Please see book page number 281 and clause 4.9b to observe
          how I have inserted this requirement. Also, turn to book page number 302,
          clause 3.03, item number 2, in order to observe how this requirement has
          been flown down to Process Engineering for implementation into the pro-
          cessing related documents. Then, turn to book page number 375, clause
          3.03 and observe there how process monitoring for this objective is imple-
          mented. (Please note that the complete flow-down of requirements is a
          must in any effectively implemented process-approach quality manage-
          ment system.)

         PRODUCT REALIZATION
7.1          PLANNING OF PRODUCT REALIZATION
                 Plan the processes for realization of product. Determine qua-

      COMMENTS
      This clause is the pinnacle of ISO 9001/ 2000 as to how to plan meeting
                   customer requirements. It should be understood in relation to all other
                   planning clauses given under 5.4.2 (System Planning), 7.3.1 (Design and
                   Development Planning), and 8.1 (General).
                   As we review the clauses of ISO 9001/94 under 4.2.3 (Quality Planning) and
                   4.9 (Process Control), what we find here is a clear consolidation of the same
                   planning requirements and more. This is good, for it will prevent incomplete
                   quality planning that was possible under ISO 9001/94.
       The control of product realization processes is the heart of ISO 9001/2000.
       While the general quality planning requirements were stated under clause
       5.4.2, this clause will present us with specific planning requirements for
       product realization. Complying with these planning requirements, suddenly
       we are faced with the monumental task of integrating responsibilities and
       activities within relevant functions and levels of the organization to manage
       shop related interactions for product realization. Determining the quality
       objectives for the product, project or contract will bring together the totality
       of core departmental controls through the establishment of interactive quality
       objective procedures in order to maintain consistent operation. All in all, this
       will require the identification of the necessary work processes, process own-
       ers’ responsibility and the appropriate documentation to prove work results.
       Most importantly, product acceptance will have to be proven by verification
       and monitoring records. Providing resource needs to meet the conformity of
       the product is no longer a marketing slogan, but rather, specific to product
       realization. The orderly interaction of product related work assignments and
       their fulfillment should demonstrate that the product realization processes are
       cohesively integrated and controlled.
       Auditors will look for: 1) identification of the quality objective requirements
       in the quality manual and the reference to procedures or forms. 2) the quality
       objective procedures which implement the fulfillment processes of the quality
       objectives. 3) the measurable work results documented in the various forms.
       
                What to do:
       Add clarifying statements (enhancement) in your current quality manual
       under  “Process Control” clause 4.9, and “Quality Planning” clause 4.2.3,
       regarding planning activities. Then list the quality objective procedures in
       each sub-clause, as applicable. Please see book page numbers 277, clause
       4.2.3, and 281, clause 4.9, in order to observe how enhancement is made
       possible. Then, look up any of the referenced quality objective procedures to
       understand how planning is linked to everything we do in quality manage-
       ment.
       Although the new standard doesn’t require any documented procedures, it
       would be suicidal not to have them. Don’t throw away any of your current

528   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
       quality plans, documented procedures or flowcharts. Update or rewrite them
       to fall in line with the flow-down and integration scheme of process ap-
       proach. This whole book serves as a model for you. Take advantage of it.
7.2
     CUSTOMER-RELATED PROCESSES
7.2.1 
DETERMINATION OF REQUIREMENTS RELATED TO
               THE PRODUCT
     Determine customer requirements:
• Product requirements stated
• Product requirements not stated but necessary for intended or
specified use
• Statutory and regulatory requirements relate to product
• Additional internal requirements
              COMMENTS
                 ISO 9001/94 did contain similar requirements under clause 4.3 (Contract
                 Review) except for the last three items.
        Item one is the general requirement that we have been accustomed to doing
                 under clause 4.3.2 (Review) of the ’94 standard. What was missing from this
                 clause was item two, three, and four. Item two: what were we supposed to do
                 in cases where the customer sent in a contract and said: “Make it to the draw-
                 ing.” This is a very common event in the manufacturing industry and many
                 times the source of misunderstanding, leading to legal action between parties.
                 The new standard recognizes this omission and stipulates that we must do
                 something about not stated quality requirements. Items three and four are non-
                 specific requirements and should be weighted in relation to the interpretation
                 of the fluctuating product quality requirements in the awarded contracts.
               Meeting customer requirements is the principal objective of ISO 9001/2000.
                 It should also be the same of any quality management system tailored to
                 meet customer satisfaction, irrespective of ISO requirements. Both, the iden-
                 tification of quality requirements and the product realization planning start
                 here, under the various phases of Contract Administration. These should form
                 the basis for all quality objectives, and the establishment of the appropriate
                 procedures in which we flow down requirements that give us the necessary
                 information required in maintaining product conformity to the stated as well
                 as to the not stated quality requirements of a contract. If we miss doing these
                 things at this stage in the product’s flow-cycle, the entire quality management
                 system could become ineffective. We would be backtracking to solve problems
                 from the end of the line only to discover that we could have prevented them, if
                 we had paid serious attention to quality planning requirements at the beginning
                 of the flow cycle. This is the RFQ phase in business transactions. This is where
 20

                                                                                                                                                      
                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   529
                 we put down the final cost figures for all the product realization steps that will
                 determine later how efficiently we must do our work at every stage in the pro-
                 duct realization cycle to stay within the established budget. This is where over-
                 effectiveness in the imposition of  quality requirements could be the straw that
                 broke the camel’s back. This is known as cost overdrive. This could be the
                 single most important quality-planning requirement that the new standard said
                 nothing about. Ensure that you carefully plan the implementation of all quality
                 related requirements, because meeting the effectiveness criteria of  ISO 9001/
                 2000 could, alone, become the hidden factor in cost overdrive.
      What to do:
      Since items two, three and four are entirely new requirements, they should be
                enfolded in the “Contract Review” provisions under the RFQ and /or Purchase
                Order Review sections. They are part of clause 4.3 (Contract Review) of the
                ’94 standard. The quality objective procedures written to cover these require-
                ments should provide process instructions to those doing the RFQ and PO
                reviews as to what is expected of them in light of these new items. Please see
                book page number 278, clause 4.3.2a, in order to observe this addition. Then,
                go to book page number 302, clause 3.02, and observe how the entire quality
                requirements of a contract are flown down by the application of  Form A-001.
                Pay attention to “Note 5” regarding the handling of not stated requirements.
7.2.3    CUSTOMER COMMUNICATION
   Identify and implement measures for communicating with
             customers relating to:
• Product information
• Enquiries, contracts or order handling, including amend-
ments
• Customer complaints and feedback
               COMMENTS
                Item one and two are basic and routine exchange of information between
                   contracting parties. The ’94 standard in clause 4.3 implied this as such,
                   but without identifying the internal and external communication specifics
                   involved daily between the customer and the organization. At last, ISO
                   9001/2000 is making it clear that we should determine and implement effec-
                   tive arrangements to control this part of the business management also.
                   Item three is a completely new requirement, significantly impacting the
                   service sector. The manufacturing sector has, to a degree, in-house methods
                   of handling customer complaints and feedback information, albeit without
                   written procedures in a lot of places. We must recognize here that a lot of
                   manufacturers had procedures to handle customer complaints and feedback
21

530   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
                   information long before ISO 9000 was adopted. Quality system procedures
                   under Mil-Q-9858 took care of it all (see MIL-STD-1535).
                   The new requirement under this clause is to “identify and implement arrange-
                   ments” as to how communication takes place between the customer and the
                   organization. This boils down to a pretty complex integration effort as there
                   are very few things in contract manufacturing that customer requirements
                   don’t impact, either directly or indirectly.
                What to do:
                   This clause imposes a completely new requirement regarding communica-
                   tion with customers. Since this effort involves different functions and levels
                   within the organization, every procedure that includes customer related
                   activities should be changed to bring about directing interactions between the
                   customer and the various members of the organization. First, we should iden-
                   tify the requirement in our ISO ’94 quality manual under “Contract Review”
                   (4.3). Then, flow down and integrate all responsibilities in other quality ob-
                   jective procedures. First, in “Document and Data Control” (4.5 – QOP 002);
                   second, in “Process Control” (4.9 – QOP 006, Sec Three); third, in “Inspec-
                   tion and Testing” (4.10 – QOP 006); and fourth, in “Control of Nonconform-
                   ing Product” (4.13 – QOP 009). We should create similar quality objective
                   procedures that govern these activities in order to bring about a cohesive
                   interaction between the members of the organization and the customer.
                   If you ever wondered how system integration plays into the hand of effective
                   quality management, this will be the moment of truth for you as I will demon-
                   strate in this book. We will be focusing here on contract related matters
                   only. But, please keep in mind that every one of the other clauses listed above
                   has its own quality objective procedure, clearly defining specific activities
                   dealing with customer communication through interactive processes. So, if
                   you wish to fully implement customer communication into your quality man-
                   agement system, the framework on how to do it is already implemented in
                   this book. Just follow the linkages referenced from procedure to procedure
                   and you will find everything you need.
          Contract Review (4.3)
          Please go to book page number 278 (Quality Manual) and read all the sub-
                   clauses (4.3.1, 4.3.2, 4.3.3, and 4.3.4). Note in sub-clause 4.3.1 the identifica-
                   tion of QOP 001. This document is the quality objective procedure for con-
                   tract related activities, which defines all interactions for every member in the
                   organization regarding task specific responsibilities, communication, flow-
                   down requirements, and linkages to other procedures. It has four sections,
                   each dealing with a separate topic, regarding customer purchase order acti-
                   vities. Go to book page 295 and read all sections of QOP 001. After, you
                   may wish to go to the other QOPs from here to convince yourself of the im-
                   portance of how customer requirements should be integrated in just about

     DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT
7.3.1       DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT PLANNING
      Plan and control the review, verification and validation acti-
                vities of each design and development stage. Manage effective
                communication and assignment of responsibilities
      COMMENTS
                    This is a new requirement in addition to what we find in ISO 9001/94 under
                    clause 4.4.2 Design and Development Planning, and in 4.4.3 Organizational
                        and Technical Interfaces. Planning to control the review, verification, vali-
                    dation, communication, and assignment of responsibility impacts only those
                    companies that are engaged in design activities.
        What to do:
                    Amend your current quality manual to include review, verification, valida-
                    tion, communication, and assignment of responsibilities under “Design and
                    Development Planning” in line with clause 4.4.2 of the ’94 standard. Then,
                    either amend or rewrite the applicable quality objective procedures in order
                    to define how you are going to implement and control them.
7.3.7 
CONTROL OF DESIGN AND DEVELOPMENT CHANGES
                 Verify and validate changes before implementation, as ap-
                 propriate. Evaluate the effect of the changes on constituent
                 parts and delivered products. Maintain records.
                COMMENTS
      ISO 9001/94, clause 4.4.9, did not include these requirements. The control of
                       design and/or development changes now include verification and validation
                   requirements before implementation, as appropriate. Inasmuch as this is now
                   the requirement, it does not mean that every change will have to be subjected
                   to it. The phrase “as appropriate” allows the design activity to decide when to
                   enforce it. On the other hand, evaluation of the effect of changes on consti-
                   tuent parts and delivered products must be enforced. The Standard reworded
                   this clause in ISO/FDIS 9001 and as appropriate is no longer inclusive to the
                   last sentence of the paragraph as it was before. Record maintenance applies to
                   all the activities involving changes.

532   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
      What to do:
                Amend your current quality manual to include the control of design and de-
                   velopment changes regarding these new requirements. Emphasize the phrase:
                       as appropriate for the verification and validation part of this clause. Add this
                   revision under “Design Changes” in line with clause 4.4.9 of the ’94 standard.
                   Update your applicable quality objective procedures and state how you are
                   going to implement and control them.
7.4
PURCHASING
7.4.1       PURCHASING PROCESS
      Establish re-evaluation requirements
      COMMENTS
       This requirement can no longer be presumed. It is explicitly stated. ISO
                    9001/94 did not clearly state this requirement under clause 4.6.2.
                 Periodic evaluation is a new requirement added to the others we had under
                    clause 4.6.2 in the ’94 standard. Most of us would call this a “paper change”
                    as we are already doing periodic re-surveys of our suppliers, frequently by
                    mail-in surveys. The intent of the new standard under this clause is to perio-
                    dically determine if the supplier is still capable of meeting the organization’s
                    product quality requirements. Re-survey helps us to detect whether the sup-
                    plier underwent organizational changes impacting his previously approved
                    quality system. The result of re-survey may trigger additional action if it
                    indicates deterioration in the supplier’s quality system. We could easily de-
                    tect this also by reviewing the supplier’s previous inspection records on file,
                    even before we wait for the re-survey results.
         What to do:
           If you don’t already have the re-evaluation included in your quality system,
                    add this requirement in your current quality manual under “Evaluation of
                    Subcontractors” in line with clause 4.6.2 of the ’94 standard. Revise also
                    your quality objective procedures dealing with controlling subcontractors
                    and state there how you are going to implement and control re-surveys.
                    Please turn to book page number 279 (Quality Manual), clause 4.6.2a, to ob-
                    serve how I have inserted subject requirement. Then, look up the quality ob-
                    jective procedure, QOP 003 on book page 342, and read clause 3.02.1 or
                    3. 02.2 in order to observe the implementation process in fulfilling this re-
                    quirement.

CONTROL OF MONITORING AND MEASURING
                 DEVICES
       Software used for measuring and monitoring of specified
                 requirements shall be confirmed prior to use and periodically
       reconfirmed
       COMMENTS
       Confirmation is the new requirement. The rest of the basic calibration re-
                    quirements have been carried over from ISO 9001/94, clause 4.11, to the
                    new standard. This means that we are required to control the approval,
                    release and application of software if we want to use it in measuring, moni-
                    toring and accepting products.
                    Remember, there is a vast difference whether you design and manufacture
                    software or you’re just programming software. In the first one, you should
                    control confirmation through certification from the manufacturer. In the
                    second one, you should either subcontract the confirmation requirement and
                    obtain certification for it, or control it in-house through a quality objective
                    procedure. Changes done to software through reprogramming should be con-
                    trolled in the same manner as you would control document changes. To com-
                    ply with this clause, you have to make sure that your calibration records can
                    prove that confirmation was done prior to the use of the software for product
                    acceptance. If you have software on line during transition to ISO 9001/2000,
                    you can continue using it, but your calibration records must indicate that the
                    software has been accepted through “continual use” verification, known as
                    “grandfather-ing.”
      What to do:
        Amend your current quality manual under “Control of Inspection, Measuring
        and Test Equipment” to include the control of software confirmation require-
        ment in line with clause 4.11 of the ’94 standard. Then, revise, rewrite or es-
        tablish the appropriate procedures to show how software confirmation will
        be implemented and controlled.
        In this book, I’m only covering the control of software programming change.
        Please turn to book page 284 (Quality Manual) and observe clause 4.11.1 as
        to how I have inserted this requirement. Then, go to book page 320 to the
        quality objective procedure QOP 002, Sec Two, clause 3.03.2.3 and observe
        there how I have implemented controlling software changes as part of the
        software confirmation requirement.

    MEASUREMENT, ANALYSIS AND IMPROVEMENT
8.1           GENERAL
      Plan and implement the measurement, monitoring, and analysis
      activities to demonstrate conformity of the product and the
      quality management system to continually improve effectiveness
     COMMENTS
                   There is no corresponding requirement in ISO 9001/94. This is typical pro-
                   cess control for all the defined quality objectives requiring documented work
                   results to demonstrate compliance through measurement. Deficiencies found
                   should start the implementation of continual improvement.
                We have here the fourth occasion involving quality planning. Under this
                   clause, we are faced with measuring performance results in work processes.
                   One of the reasons for doing this is to find process related problems and im-
                   plement improvements. The other is to prevent problems from migrating from
                   process to process. And the third one is to achieve process performance satis-
                   faction that would eventually lead to customer satisfaction at the end of the
                   production line. This is no longer just measuring product dimensions to
                   drawing requirements. This involves being able to measure what the quality
                   objectives are required to achieve through process controls. Methodologies,
                   including statistical techniques, are all part of effective process control. In
                   determining process performance results, the word measurement also means
                   monitoring the processes to evaluate whether we have achieved expected
                   results. Continual improvement is meant to be implemented at all stages in
                   the product realization processes where non-conformity to customer require-
                   ments has been identified. Keep always in mind that customer in the eyes
                   of ISO means both internal (organizational members) and external (buyer)
                   parties. The full meaning of clause 8.1 (General) will not be understood
                   until we relate it to all the other clauses in section  8, especially clauses 8.2.3
                   (Monitoring and Measurement of Processes) and 8.2.4. (Monitoring and
                   Measurement of Product).
                   What to do:
          In order to be able to apply measurement techniques to evaluate work results
                   in all the processes of the quality management system, we need to determine
                   the construction method of our quality objective procedures. These proce-
                   dures must provide the necessary process instructions to enable all process
                   owners to understand what is expected from them, for they will not be able to
                   monitor and record work results. They will not be able to measure them and
                   adjust for errors. What we have to keep in mind here is that we are not only
                   providing quality plans to inspection personnel, but also to other process
                   owners in the organization (including subcontractors) who are expected to
 26

                                                                                                                                                      
                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   535
                   achieve measurable and acceptable work results in other continuing work
                   processes.
                   The layout of these procedures should include the identification of process
                   owners and process requirements. These procedures should provide instruc-
                   tions when to measure and record work results to prove conformity to re-
                   quirements. And should provide linkage information needed to integrate pro-
                   cess continuity requirements in other procedures and forms. Thus making the
                   entire quality system one continuously looped, integrated system, product by
                   product. (Which means that you should have enough quality objective proce-
                   dures in place to satisfy both the minimum “not stated,” clause 7.2.1b, as well
                   as the maximum “specified,” clause 7.2.1a, quality requirements of a con-
                   tract.) The standardization of quality objective procedures should become a
                   reality, consistently providing process instructions to those employees execut-
                   ing customer requirements.
                   This type of procedure construction method is basic to a process-approach
                   quality management system presented in this book and falls in line with ISO
                   9001/2000 requirements to effectively manage the processes of a quality sys-
                   tem. My research concludes that there is nothing like this available on the
                   market today outside of this book. What is available, however, falls far short
                   of quality system integration in the manufacturing sector, for other books
                   merely provide partial repair schemes without global linkage to all the pro-
                   cesses required in manufacturing quality systems.
          What to do:
                   To include this new requirement in the quality manual, we should add the
                   measurement, analysis, and improvement definitions under applicable
                   clauses like “Process Control” (4.9); “Inspection and Testing” (4.10); “Con-
                   trol of Non-conforming Product” (4.13); and under “Internal Audit” (4.17).
                   The quality procedures that govern the quality objectives under these titles
                   should also meet the criteria under this new clause by the very nature of the
                   included information, regarding measurement requirements.
   
          Let’s illustrate integration of these in this book. Please turn to book page
                   number 281, clause 4.9c and 4.9d and observe the inserted information. Then,
                   go to the referenced documents and observe there the implementation pro-
                   cesses. After that, let’s verify how the other quality objective procedures took
                   care of the same requirement. Turn to book page 282, clause 4.10 and read
                   the entire sub-clauses. Then, turn to book page 357 and review from QOP
                   006 the extensive coverage in fulfilling the “measurement” requirements. The
                   sections of this quality objective procedure have been designed to take care of
                   the requirements under this ISO clause. I think it is obvious by now how to
                   handle the other clauses (4.13 and 4.17) mentioned above.

8.2           MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT
8.2.1      CUSTOMER SATISFACTION
                Determine and monitor information on customer requirements
                as one of the measurements of performance of the quality man-
                agement system. Determine the methodologies
                COMMENTS
                   No corresponding clause exists in ISO 9001/94. This clause should be under-
                   stood in line with clauses 7.2.1 (Determination of Requirements Related to
                   the Product); 7.2.2 (Review of Requirements Related to the Product); and
                   7.2.3 (Customer Communication) of the ISO 9001/2000 requirements.
       Measuring customer satisfaction in manufacturing is vastly different from
       that of the service industry. In manufacturing, customer satisfaction is en-
       sured by the very nature of controlling the product realization processes to
       comply with customer requirements imposed by contract. Records serve as
       objective evidence to demonstrate compliance with contractual requirements.
       Before we ship a product, however, we should know first hand the status of
       customer satisfaction. If we don’t, we don’t have an effective quality manage-
       ment system. But there are exceptions.
       Even under the best of intentions to satisfy our customers, something of a
       minor nature could surface that we missed and the customer provided the
       feedback information to us via telephone, circumventing documentation and
       the formal implementation of corrective action. The recurrence of the same
       problem has not been eliminated. To avoid this type of embarrassment, we
       should request feedback information on our own initiative from our custom-
       ers regarding any product we delivered.
       To implement this type of customer feedback, I recommend the use of a
       simple form. The application of such a form, however, should never be taken
       as a substitution for the established procedural system implemented to con-
       trol across-the-board occurring non-conformities. But, it should be comple-
       mentary to the established system.
       Keep in mind, though, that we are required to include customer feedback
       results in our management reviews. (See “Review Input,” clause 5.6.2.)
      What to do:
       Add a sub-clause in your quality manual under “Controlling Non-conforming
       Product” in line with clause 4.13 of the ’94 standard. Title it as ‘Evaluation
       of Customer Feedback.’ It could also be combined with customer complaints
 27

                                                                                                                                                      
                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   537
       and product returns. Then, the title would change to ‘Customer Complaints,
       Product Returns and Customer Satisfaction.’ I have opted to use the latter
       one. The entire undertaking of measuring customer satisfaction should be
       handled under one quality objective, − Controlling Non-conforming Products.
       The procedure written to implement customer feedback should have, then, a
       separate section dealing with ‘Customer Satisfaction Reporting’.
      Let’s check out how the implementation of this clause takes place under a
                   process-approach quality management system, − more precisely, under the
                   ‘Control of Non-conforming Product’ provisions of the ISO 9001/94 stan-
                   dard. Please turn to book page number 286, sub-clause 4.13.3, and observe
                   how this requirement is handled. Then, go to the referenced quality objective
                   procedure QOP 009, Sec Three, clause 3.04, on book page 419. Please read
                   all the sub-clauses of clause 3.04 and observe there how the “feedback” re-
                   porting requirement is made simple in a manufacturing environment.

     ANALYSIS OF DATA
     Collect and analyze data to demonstrate the suitability and effec-
               tiveness of the quality management system.
               Identify improvements. Provide information on:
a)  Customer satisfaction
b)  Product conformance to requirements
c)  Characteristics (status) of processes, products and their
 trends for preventive action opportunities
d)  Suppliers (subcontractors)
               COMMENTS
                  There are no equivalent requirements of this clause under ISO 9001/94. These
                  requirements should be understood in line with ISO 9001/2000, clauses 8.2.3
                  (Monitoring and Measurement of Processes); 8.2.4 (Monitoring and Measure-
                  ment of Product); and 8.3 (Control of Non-conforming Product). This means
                  a complete integration of the quality system processes to accomplish it.
                     Special Note:  Clause 8 is the best example of the
           PLAN-DO-CHECK-ACT cycle in ISO 9001/2000
•      Plan as per clause 8.1
•      Do as per clauses 8.2.3, 8.2.4 and 8.3
•      Check as per clause 8.4 (analysis)
•      Act as per clause 8.5 (corrective action)
       In order to be able to analyze data regarding the four areas listed under this
       clause, we need to go back to clause 8.2.3 (Monitoring and Measurement of
 28

538   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
       Processes) and to clause 8.2.4 ( Monitoring and Measurement of Product). To
       fulfill the requirements under these clauses, we are required to create the
       necessary forms on which the pertinent data could be recorded. This alone
       brings us back to the framework construction of the entire quality manage-
       ment system (see “Quality Policy,” clause 5.3c). Being able to measure work
       results in all the activities involving the processes of the quality management
       system, we have to engineer the data recording forms and filing control re-
       quirements into the quality objective procedures written to control these pro-
       cesses as part of the quality system framework.
       We can accomplish this by combining the various forms with their respective
       quality objective procedures, or keeping them controlled separately in a
       forms manual. In this book, I controlled the quality objective procedures
       separately and also the designed forms separately. The reason for this is very
       important. The year 2000 Standard requires a documented procedure to con-
       trol records (forms), (see clause 4.2.4). Experience proves that when the re-
       cords (forms) are combined with the quality objective procedures, even
       though they belong together, the handling and maintenance of them becomes
       a convoluted process, leading to loss of records and disorganized files.
       To simplify document control all around in the quality system, I have kept the
       various document groups (the quality manual, the quality operating proce-
       dures and the forms) separated from each other. Then, I linked them back by
       referencing in accordance with requirements from the identified processes of
       the quality manual and the quality objective procedures. Now, I can manage
       the three separate groups of documents under their own files independently,
       but in an integrated fashion. This process also has problems such as flow-
       down control when making changes and continual back and forth navigation
       to find the right information. Nevertheless, these can be efficiently and effec-
       tively managed once the routines are established. But, not being able to find
       records is a more serious problem than the two drawbacks combined. The
       lack of records to prove work results is tantamount to lack of control. It was
       for this reason I created a separate filing control for the records of the quality
       management system presented in this book. Having this type of record filing
       control allows immediate gathering of the needed information to support the
       data analysis requirement of this ISO clause.
       What we have to keep in mind regarding this clause on “Analysis of Data” is
       that compliance with it doesn’t happen directly. A brief policy statement in
       the quality manual under the designated process clauses will be adequate to
       acknowledge it, for implementation of the four requirements will take place
       under specific quality objective procedures (See the last paragraph below).
      What to do:
1) Amend your current quality manual under “Purchasing” (4.6, see book
page 279) and enfold there the requirement for data recording and collec-

                                                                                                                                                      
                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   539
tion of records regarding subcontractors (suppliers). This will be a re-
sponse to sub-clause 8.4d of the new standard.
2) Amend your quality manual under “Process Control” (4.9, see book page
281) and enfold there process control requirements. This will be a re-
sponse to sub-clause 8.4c of the new standard.
3) Amend your quality manual under “Inspection and Testing” (4.10, see
book page 282) and enfold there in general terms the analysis of data
requirement for both process and product compliance. This will be a
response to all sub-clauses 8.4a,b,c,d of the new standard.
4) Amend your quality manual under “Control of Non-conforming Product”
(4.13, see book page 285) and enfold there in general terms the imple-
mentation of improvements through corrective action (clause 4.14 on
book page 286) in the entire quality system. This will be a response to
satisfy the intent of clause 8.4 of the new standard.
5) Amend your quality manual under “Internal Quality Audits” (4.17, see
book page 289) and enfold there in general terms how the entire quality
system is audited to ensure compliance with all the requirements of the
documented quality system. This will be a response in combination with
all sub-clauses 8.4a,b,c,d of the new standard.
6) Amend your quality manual under “Statistical Techniques” (4.20, see
book page 289) and enfold there in general terms that statistical tech-
niques are applicable as required to enforce the intent of clause 8.4 of the
new standard.
         To gain the experience necessary to understand how subject clause (8.4) is
                    implemented for maintaining an effectively operated quality system, please
                    go back to each of the above given titles and clauses (1 through 6) and exam-
                    ine the quality objective procedures referenced in the quality manual under
                    the applicable paragraphs. Each quality objective procedure will also refer-
                    ence the applicable Form(s) that are used to record the relevant data required
                    to support the “Analysis of Data” requirement of ISO 9001/2000.

       IMPROVEMENT
8.5.1        CONTINUAL IMPROVEMENT
       Continually improve the effectiveness of the quality manage-
                  ment system by the application of quality policy and objectives,
                  audit results, analysis of data, corrective/preventive actions, and
                  management review
      COMMENTS
       There is no equivalent requirement that exists for this clause in ISO 9001/94.
           Under the ’94 standard, continual improvement was implied under phrases
                    like “…continuing suitability…” (clause 4.1.3 Management Review) and
 29

540   ISO 9001:2000 for SMALL BUSINESSES
                    “…take timely corrective action…” (clause 4.17 Internal Quality Audits). In
                    the new standard, however, continual improvement occupies a central roll as
                    one of the policy objectives of the quality management system (see sub-
                    clause 5.3b). Continual improvement, therefore, is a pervasive undertaking
                    equally applied at any phase during and after the product realization process-
                    es when non-conformities prevent the achievement of internal and external
                    customer satisfaction. It is no longer just relegated to the decision-making
                    results of management reviews, but also implemented as an in-process driven
                    objective, when and where required. A documented procedure to implement
                    it is not a requirement, but when clauses 8.5.2 (Corrective Action) and clause
                    8.5.3 (Preventive Action) are implemented, they are best done by combining
                    all the improvement efforts through one cohesively tailored documented
                    procedure. Please review QOP 009 on book pages 403-420 in order that you
                    fully understand the many areas we need to worry about to have a system-
                    wide improvement undertaking effectively managed.
       We should not underestimate the ‘global’ implication of continual improve-
       ment. In this clause, continual improvement is intended to embrace the entire
       quality management system, because every one of us could make a mistake in
       any of our work processes that could be missed and easily transferred from
       process to process, eventually impacting just about anybody’s work results,
       including product quality.
       The immediate question that we must answer is: How are we going to imple-
       ment an organization-wide quality improvement system. Are we going to set
       up a new department and thereby create a watchdog task force? Absolutely
       not. Since everybody is a contributor to continual improvement, everybody
       should be responsible for his/her own work through monitoring his/her own
       work performance output to meet the quality requirements stated in every
       applicable quality objective procedure.
       Continual improvement should be an ongoing endeavor, set into motion when
       we detect something wrong in what we do. Process owners are the first to
       observe when something is wrong. They are the ones putting quality into the
       product. As a result of this understanding, the quality objective procedures
       must provide the necessary information, either directly or indirectly (by re-
       ference) as to how to handle continual improvement in every process they are
       performing.
       Under the new standard, nonconformity takes on a special meaning which
       could evidence itself in any process people perform. When discovered, it
       should be the alarm sounded for continual improvement. What we have to be
       mindful of is the right moment to step in and correct the nonconformity, for if
       we don’t, we could create bottleneck situations down-stream in the realization
       processes.

                                                                                                                                                      
                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   541
       The reason I’m providing all this information for you is to emphasize that we
       no longer are just handling non-conforming materials (parts, etc.) as we basi-
       cally did under ISO 9001/1994. We are required to control non-conformities
       of all types that impact the identified processes in quality objectives. Since
       the processes in the quality management system are interactive, we must also
       have interactive procedures to implement corrective actions where and when
       needed during process realizations. Every quality objective is made up of
       several continuing processes interlinked to other processes, upstream/down-
       stream in the realization cycle, before it can be called completed. For this
       reason, continual improvement should also be interactive in all processes
       of the quality management system to cure what’s wrong when and where
       problems happen.
      What to do:
       Add a statement in your quality manual under “Corrective and Preventive
       Action” (4.14.1) and describe there the general intent of maintaining con-
       tinual improvement throughout the quality management system. Add also a
       similar statement under “Control of Non-conforming Product” (4.13). Then,
       create the controlling procedure(s) as to how to implement them. Since a
       documented procedure is required for controlling non-conforming product,
       combine the requirements here with other activities, causing continual im-
       provement to result from corrective actions.
       Since corrective action could impact all activities in a quality management
       system, I have also designed the implementation process for it to apply to the
       entire system. Let’s prove it.
       Please turn to book page number 285, sub-clauses 4.13.1 and 4.13.2, and
       observe the evolution of the continual improvement implementation process.
       Turn now to book page 286, sub-clauses 4.14.1, 4.14.2, and 4.14.3, and ob-
       serve there the follow-up interactions, implementing the requirements stated
       in sub-clauses 4.13.1 and 4.13.2. Note that these are just policy declarations
       in the quality manual in response to the requirements of clause 8.5.1 of the
       new standard. To follow up on how implementation takes place, please re-
       view the quality objective procedures referenced under each sub-clause in the
       book, pages 285 and 286.

                             IN REQUIREMENTS
4.2 
      DOCUMENTATION REQUIREMENTS
ISO 9001/2000 requires “documented procedures” in only five areas:
• Document Control
• Control of Quality Records
• Internal Audits
• Control of Nonconformity
• Corrective and Preventive Action
                   Note: ISO 9001/94, clause 4.2.2, stated only that documented procedures be
                            consistent with requirements…then, effectively implement them
                   These five documented procedures (known as SOPs or QOPs) are the mini-
                   mum required under ISO 9001/2000. This reduction was made to accom-
                   modate the Service Industry. Controlling manufacturing operations will re-
                   quire a few more documented procedures to fulfill the many quality objective
                   requirements associated with manufacturing.
         Examples: Contract Review, Inspection and Test, Calibration, Control of
         Purchases, Communications and more…
      ISO 9004/2000 is not a model to implement ISO 9001/2000. It can be used as
                   a guide for improvement beyond those given in ISO 9001/2000.
5.5
      RESPONSIBILITY, AUTHORITY AND
                COMMUNICATION
5.5.1       RESPONSIBILIY AND AUTHORITY
      “organizational freedom” is no longer a requirement as it was under ISO
                   9001/94 in clause 4.1.2.1
       Under the definition of this clause, the new standard implies the creation of
       an interactive process-approach quality management system. Organizational
       freedom has been removed in order to ensure a more effective cohesion bet-
       ween functions and their interrelations within the organization.

                                                                                                                                                      
                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   543
4.2.3       CONTROL OF DOCUMENTS
      “Master List” (ISO 9001/94, clause 4.5.2) is no longer explicitly required in
                    ISO 9001/2000. But, the indication of current revision levels of documents is
                    still a requirement.
        The requirement for a Master List has been removed. Remember, without it,
        we would not be able to show effective revision control of the many proce-
        dures stacked in the Procedures Manual. This is a very important navigation-
        al tool to identify the status at a glance regarding changes done to individual
        procedures. It is also a summary index, indicating what type of procedures
        we have in the quality system. (Look this up on book page 293.) I recom-
        mend that you keep using it.
7.4 
       PURCHASING
7.4.2        PURCHASING INFORMATION
                 “review and approve purchasing documents” (ISO 9001/94, clause 4.6.3) is
                    no longer a requirement. This phrase has been replaced by “ensure the
                    adequacy of specified requirements” in ISO 9001/2000, clause 7.4.2. Thus,
                    the controlling authority may be circumvented.
                    Removing the review and approval requirement of purchasing information is
                    an invitation to disaster in manufacturing. This is a very important quality
                    function to ensure that purchasing information contains the accurate flow-
                    down of all customer quality requirements. Stick to the established proce-
                    dures as sector specific standards will impose this requirement. This removal
                    was made to accommodate the Service Industry.
7.4.3        VERIFICATION OF PURCHASED PRODUCT
        “ensure that incoming product…has been inspected or otherwise verified…”
                     (ISO 9001/94, clause 4.10.2). This phrase has been replaced by “establish
                     and implement the inspection or other activities necessary for ensuring that
                     purchased product meets the specified purchase requirements” under ISO
                     9001/2000, clause 7.4.3.
         Rephrasing the verification of purchased product does not remove the re-
         quirement. It allows doing it in any controlled fashion suitable for the pur-
         pose of the organization. Stay with the already established procedure if it
         works for you.

      PRODUCTION AND SERVICE PROVISION
7.5.4       CUSTOMER PROPERTY
       “establish and maintain documented procedures for the control of verifi-
                    cation, storage, and maintenance of customer-supplied product…” (ISO
                    9001/94, clause 4.7). This phrase has been replaced in ISO 9001/2000,
                    clause 7.5.4, by “identify, verify, protect and safeguard customer pro-
                    perty…” This includes all customer-supplied products not just supplies to be
                    incorporated into the product.
        The requirement for documented procedures is removed. Addition of the
        word “identify” rules out partial listing of customer property that we were
        able to do before. Now we have to control all customer supplied property.
        The best place to do this identification, verification, and recording is at
        Receiving. (Check out form A-015 on book page 470)
7.5.5        PRESERVATION OF PRODUCT
       “…establish and maintain documented procedures for handling, storage,
                    packaging, preservation, and delivery of product.” (ISO 9001/94, clause
                    4.15.1). The individual clause listing has been combined into one sentence
                    under ISO 9001/2000, clause 7.5.5 (…preserve the conformity of product
                    during internal processing and delivery…shall include identification, han-
                    dling, packaging, storage and protection…preservation shall also apply to the
                    constituent parts of a product.).
        The individual clauses found in the ’94 standard have been consolidated
        under one clause. This will not remove any of the previously established
        requirements. Stay with the already established system. It is perceived that
        the Sector Specific Standards will reinstate everything, plus more, of what
        we already did under the ’94 standard.

      MEASUREMENT, ANALYSIS AND IMPROVEMENT
8.2.2 
INTERNAL AUDIT
                   The requirement under clause 4.17 in ISO 9001/1994 that “…personnel inde-
                   pendent of those having direct responsibility for the activity being audited.”
                   has been replaced  by “…ensure objectivity and impartiality of the results of
                       the audit process” Also: No longer required that internal quality audits deter-
                       mine the effectiveness of the quality management system. But, there is a stark
                   reality in place here. Follow-up action is a requirement to verify actions and
                   report verification results. Furthermore, management is under the gun to act

                                                                                                                                                      
                  STANDARDS ALIGNMENT   545
                   without undue delay to eliminate non-conformities and their causes.
       In an integrated quality management system the word “independent” does not
       fit into the organizational structure. Anybody trained to do internal audits can
       do it as long as he/she has not performed what’s being audited. The removal
       of determining “effectiveness” by the audit scope does not remove the re-
       quirement for ensuring the effective operation and control of the quality ma-
       nagement system’s processes, invoked in other clauses in ISO 9001/2000,
       (see clauses 4.1c, 4.2.1d, 5.6.1).
8.2.4       MONITORING AND MEASUREMENT OF PRODUCT
      Receiving, in-process, and final inspections are no longer titled as such under
                   ISO 9001/2000. These have been contracted into one paragraph without men-
                   tioning titles. “The organization shall measure and monitor the characteristics
                   of the product to verify that product requirements have been met. This shall
                   be carried out at appropriate stages of the product realization process….”
       The removal of inspection titles in the new standard does not remove inspec-
       tion requirements as we already practice them in manufacturing. This is an-
       other move by the writers of the new standard to wipe out the long standing
       labeling of the ’94 standard as a manufacturing standard. Stick with the same
       inspection titles we already have whenever writing new procedures to fulfill
       customer and internal requirements.
8.3
      CONTROL OF NONCONFORMING PRODUCT
Review and disposition of non-conforming product (ISO 9001/94, clause
                   4.13) have been removed as a requirement under ISO 9001/2000 clause 8.3.
                   These activities are now shifted over to paragraph 8.5.2 Corrective Action.
                   Removal of the review and disposition criteria in controlling non-conforming
                   products is a self-defeatist proposition on the part of the new standard. We all
                   know that to implement continuous improvement when nonconformance has
                   been identified, cannot be done without reviewing and dispositioning the non-
                   conformance. In order to determine corrective/preventive actions and imple-
                   ment continual improvement in line with the Plan-Do-Check-Act provisions,
                   this is a must to do. The new standard is playing with semantics here because
                   it puts this requirement under clauses 8.5.2 and 8.5.3 − corrective/preventive
                   action − while forgetting that review and disposition is done for implement-
                   ing other actions as well as corrective/preventive actions. It is true that the
                   Service Industry has only selected need for reviewing and dispositioning non-
                   conforming materials. The Manufacturing Industry, on the other hand, cannot
                   do without it, for there would be questionable materials all over the shop.

                   Do not respond to this shifting strategy as the review and disposition of non-
                   conforming products occur prior to the imposition of corrective/preventive
                   actions. Stay with the P-D-C-A rules in managing all non-conformities. It is
                   certain that the Sector Specific Standards will have detailed requirements
                   on how to handle non-conforming materials in the manufacturing industry.
