The radio spectrum is that part of the electromagnetic spectrum used to transmit 
71 
voice, video, and data. It uses frequencies from 3 kilohertz (kHz) to 300 gigahertz 
72 
(GHz). This section considers only that part of the radio spectrum that supports 
73 
wireless data transmission.  
74 
 
75 
There are many different types of wireless data communications. Each has its 
76 
advantages and drawbacks. 
77 
 
78 
I 
IR (infrared): Very high data rates and lower cost, but very short distance 
79 
I 
Narrowband: Low data rates and medium cost, it requires a license, and it 
80 
covers a limited distance 
81 
I 
Spread spectrum: Medium cost and high data rates, and limited to campus 
82 
coverage 
83 
I 
Personal communications service (PCS): Low data rates, medium cost, 
84 
and city-wide coverage  
85

Figure 2: Modulation  
100 
 
101 
 
102 
When a signal is transmitted in a data format, three parameters must be considered: 
103 
[1] 
104 
 
105 
I 
How fast: What data rate can be achieved? 
106 
I 
How far: How far can wireless LAN (WLAN) units be placed apart and 
107 
still get the maximum data rate? 
108 
I 
How many: How many users can exist without slowing the data rate? 
109 
 
110 
These parameters all relate to the ability to receive a good signal as far away as 
111 
possible. Increasing the amount of data requires the use of more frequency spectra 
112 
or a different method of placing the data on the radio frequency (RF) signal. 
113 

Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Module 8: Wireless Technology 
8-7 
 
114 
RF efficiency is affected by these three factors: 
115 
 
116 
I 
Type of modulation used: More complex modulation techniques provide 
117 
greater throughput. 
118 
I 
Distance: The farther the signal must be transmitted, the weaker the signal 
119 
becomes. 
120 
I 
Noise: Electronic noise and barriers negatively affect RF. 
121 
 
122 
Modulation 
123 
Modulation is the process by which the amplitude, frequency, or phase of an RF or 
124 
lightwave is changed in order to transmit data. The characteristics of the carrier 
125 
wave are instantaneously varied by another "modulating" waveform. Modulation 
126 
blends a data signal (text, voice, and so on) into a carrier for transmission over a 
127 
network. 
128 
 
129 
More complex modulation techniques provide greater throughput. The most 
130 
common methods follow (see Figure [2]): 
131 
 
132 
I 
Amplitude modulation (AM): Modulates the height of the carrier wave 
133 
I 
Frequency modulation (FM): Modulates the frequency of the wave 
134 
I 
Phase modulation (PM): Modulates the polarity of the wave 
135 
 
136 
Effects of Distance on a Signal 
137 
The farther the signal must be transmitted, the weaker the signal becomes. As a 
138 
receiver moves farther from a transmitter, the signal gets weaker, and the difference 
139 
between the signal and noise becomes less. At some point, the signal cannot be 
140 
distinguished from the noise, and loss of communication occurs. The amount of 
141 
compression (or modulation scheme) at which the signal is transmitted determines 
142 
the amount of signal needed to be heard through the noise. As transmission, or 
143 
modulation schemes (compression), becomes more complex and data rates increase, 
144 
immunity to noise lessen. Therefore, the distance is reduced. 
145 
 
146 
Effects of Noise 
147 
Electronic noise and barriers negatively affect RF efficiency. An exact transmission 
148 
distance for WLAN products cannot be provided without going to the site and 
149 
actually testing the environment. Walls with internal metal structures, for example, 
150 
greatly limit RF transmission range. 
151 
 
152 
Tip: More complex module schemes allow more data to be transferred using the 
153 
same bandwidth.

8.1.3 Radio Frequency Bands 
163 
Figure 1: Unlicensed Frequency Bands  
164 
 
165 
 
166 
Figure 2: Advantages and Disadvantages of Frequency Bands  
167 
 
168 
 
169 
Most radio frequencies are licensed by government agencies, such as the Federal 
170 
Communications Commission (FCC) in the United States. To broadcast over these 
171 
frequencies, it is necessary to have a license and to pay a fee.  
172 
 
173 
Unlicensed frequency bands are easier to implement and cost less over time because 
174 
they do not require licenses. There are three unlicensed bands: 900 megahertz 
175 
(MHz), 2.4 GHz, and 5 GHz (see Figure [1]). 
176 
 
177 
I 
The 900-MHz band carries cellular phones. 
178 
I 
Cisco Aironet® products use the 2.4-GHz band because it adheres to the 
179 
IEEE 802.11/b standard. 
180 

Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Module 8: Wireless Technology 
8-9 
I 
Recently, the FCC opened up the 5-GHz band for unlicensed use by high-
181 
speed data communications devices. Cisco has acquired 5-GHz technology 
182 
and will use this frequency in new products in the near future. 
183 
 
184 
Note: In order to be received correctly, complex modulation schemes require 
185 
optimal signal-to-noise ratios (more signal with less noise). If there is noise on the 
186 
channel, the line speed will be reduced. Noise, speed, and distance are all 
187 
interrelated. 
188 
 
189 
There is a relationship between the frequency and the amount of data that can be 
190 
sent. It is just like a pipe. The wider the bandwidth, the more frequencies that are 
191 
available. The wider the spectrum, the higher the data rate that can be transmitted. 
192 
The amount of spectrum available determines the data rate. 
193 
 
194 
Each frequency band has advantages and disadvantages (see Figure [2]). 
195 
 
196 
I 
Because the 900-MHz band supports cellular phones and other consumer 
197 
products, the band has become overcrowded. As a result, users often 
198 
experience interference, or they cannot access the network. As a benefit, 
199 
900 MHz offers longer range (for the same gain antennas) than 2.4 GHz. 
200 
The drawback of 900 MHz is that the fastest, most reliable data rate is only 
201 
1 megabit-per-second (Mbps) because of its limited frequency range. 
202 
I 
The 2.4-GHz frequency range is much wider than 900 MHz, allowing 
203 
higher data rates with a reliable range of up to 25 miles. Cisco Aironet 
204 
products can deliver 11-Mbps throughput because they operate in the 2.4-
205 
GHz frequency. 
206 
I 
Cisco has acquired 5-GHz technology and will deliver products for the 5-
207 
GHz frequency range, because its wider bandwidth allows for faster 
208 
throughput of data. It will be possible to achieve data rates of greater than 
209 
20 Mbps in this frequency range. The drawback of the 5-GHz frequency, 
210 
however, is its limited range. The typical range for 5 GHz indoors is about 
211 
50 feet. Outdoors poses a limitation of approximately 2500 feet.

8.1.4 Spread-Spectrum Technology 
223 
Figure 1: Encoding Signals as Electromagnetic Waves  
224 
 
225 
Spread spectrum is a modulation technique designed to be somewhat 
226 
immune to interference, and difficult to detect and intercept. Spread-
227 
spectrum modulation sacrifices bandwidth to gain signal-to-noise 
228 
performance. 
229 
 
230 
In order to use the unlicensed radio bands, you have to use spread-spectrum 
231 
techniques. Frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) and direct sequence spread 
232 
spectrum (DSSS) are two ways of doing spread spectrum. These spread-spectrum 
233 
techniques spread the RF energy over the available band. 
234 
  
235 
Just as the radio in your car has AM and FM bands, other radios use certain bands, 
236 
frequencies, and types of modulation. Spread spectrum (SS) is a modulation 
237 
technique developed in the 1940s that spreads a transmission signal over a broad 
238 
band of radio frequencies. The term spread spectrum describes a modulation 
239 
technique that makes the sacrifice of bandwidth in order to gain signal-to-noise 
240 
performance. This technique is ideal for data communications because it is less 
241 
susceptible to radio noise and creates little interference.  
242 
 
243 
Spread spectrum is a system in which the transmitted signal is spread over a 
244 
frequency much wider than the minimum bandwidth required to send the signal. 
245 
The fundamental premise is that, in channels with narrowband interference, 
246 
increasing the transmitted signal bandwidth results in an increased probability that 
247 
the received information will be correct. 
248 
 
249 
Note: Narrowband interference occurs when two signals are broadcasting at the 
250 
same frequency in the same geographic area. The term “band” refers to a grouping 
251 
of frequencies; narrow band would mean a relatively smaller range of frequencies. 
252 
Narrowband noise might disrupt certain channels or spread spectrum components.   
253 
 
254 
Tip: Spread spectrum works quite well in situations with strong narrowband 
255 
interference signals because the spread-spectrum signal has a unique form of 
256 
frequency diversity. The actual signal spreading may be achieved with one of three 
257 
basic techniques, including direct sequence and frequency hopped. 
258

276 
As modulation techniques, both frequency hopping spread spectrum (FHSS) and 
277 
direct sequence spread spectrum (DSSS) have advantages and limitations. 
278 
 
279 
FHSS [1] 
280 
With FHSS technology, transmissions hop from one frequency to another in random 
281 
patterns. This enables the transmissions to hop around narrowband interference, 
282 
resulting in a clearer signal and higher reliability of the transmission. However, 
283 
FHSS technology is slower, and the receiver must use the same pattern to decode. 
284 
 
285 
 
286 

Copyright  2002, Cisco Systems, Inc. 
Module 8: Wireless Technology 8-13 
 
287 
DSSS 
288 
DSSS technology transmissions are more reliable because each bit (1 or 0) is 
289 
represented by a string of 1s and 0s, called a chipping sequence. So even if up to 40 
290 
percent of the string is lost, the original transmission can be reconstructed. DSSS 
291 
technology also enables high throughput of data and longer-range access. 
292 
 
293 
Choosing FHSS or DSSS [2] 
294 
Just as the 802.3 Ethernet standard allows for data transmission over twisted-pair 
295 
and coaxial cable, the 802.11 WLAN standard allows for transmission over 
296 
different media. Compliant media include infrared light and two types of radio 
297 
transmission within the unlicensed 2.4-GHz frequency band: FHSS and DSSS.  
298 
 
299 
Limited to a 2-Mbps data transfer rate, FHSS is recommended for only very specific 
300 
applications such as for certain types of watercraft. For all other wireless LAN 
301 
applications, DSSS is the better choice. The recently released evolution of the IEEE 
302 
standard, 802.11b, provides for a full Ethernet-like data rate of 11 Mbps over DSSS. 
303 
FHSS does not support data rates greater than 2 Mbps. 
304 
Practice 
305 
1. Which statement does not describe the features of direct sequencing spread 
306 
spectrum (DSSS)? 
307 
 
308 
A. SSS is reliable because each bit is represented by a string of 1s and 0s.  
309 
B. If up to 40% of the string is lost, the original transmission can be 
310 
reconstructed. 
311 
C. DSSS technology has low throughput of data and short-range access. ** 
312 
D. The recently released evolution of the IEEE standard, 802.11b, provides 
313 
for a full Ethernet-like data rate of 11 Mbps over DSSS.

8.1.6 Security in the Wireless Environment 
316 
Figure 1: WEP 
317 
 
318 
 
319 
The first level of security in a wireless LAN consists of protecting the radio 
320 
frequency waveform itself.  
321 
 
322 
Increasing the security means increasing the time spent managing the system. If you 
323 
think someone would expend a lot of money and effort to eavesdrop on your LAN 
324 
radio links, then encryption is the key. The encryption device used on most Cisco 
325 
wireless products is Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP) (see Figures [1]).  
326 
 
327 
WEP encryption security provides data security that is comparable to traditional 
328 
wired LANs. WEP is a security mechanism defined within the 802.11 standard, 
329 
which is designed to make the link integrity of the wireless medium equal to that of 
330 
a cable.  
331 
 
332 
The main goals with WEP follow: 
333 
 
334 
I 
Deny access to the network by unauthorized users who do not possess the 
335 
appropriate WEP key.  
336 
I 
Prevent the decoding of captured WLAN traffic that is WEP encrypted 
337 
without the possession of the WEP key. 
338 
 
339 
Understanding the security requirements of both small business and the enterprise, 
340 
Cisco provides up to 128-bit WEP. WEP is integrated with standard authentication 
341 
features, providing a level of data security equal to traditional wired networks. 
342 
Practice 
343 
1. Which of the following is not a feature of Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)?

traditional wired LANs.

Summary 
353 
This section summarizes the key points you learned in this lesson. 
354 
 
355 
I 
In wireless data communication, the radio spectrum is that part of the 
356 
electromagnetic spectrum used to transmit voice, video, and data.  
357 
I 
Modulation is the process by which the amplitude, frequency, or phase of a 
358 
radio frequency or lightwave is changed in order to transmit data. 
359 
I 
In order to take advantage of unlicensed radio bands, you have to use 
360 
spread-spectrum techniques. Two important modulation technologies are 
361 
frequency hopping spread spectrum (FSSS) and direct sequence spread 
362 
spectrum (DHSS). DHSS offers greater reliability and more throughput than 
363 
FHSS. 
364 
I 
The wireless signal deteriorates with distance. A wireless device will 
365 
connect at a slower speed if it is moved out of optimal range. 
366 
I 
Noise may be caused through structures (walls with metal) or by electrical 
367 
equipment. Both adversely affect the range of wireless communications. 
368 
I 
The first level of security in a wireless LAN consists of protecting the radio 
369 
frequency waveform itself. The encryption device used on most Cisco 
370 
wireless products is Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP).

Wireless LANs (WLANs) are designed to be used in a local, not wide-area, 
401 
network. They are intended for use in campus-wide or in-building systems. Cisco 
402 
WLAN products fit into two main categories: WLANs and wireless bridges (see 
403 
Figures [1] and [2]).  
404 
 
405 
WLANs provide the following features: 
406 
 
407 
I 
Replace the Layer 1 transmission medium of a traditional wired network 
408 
(usually Catagory 5 cable) with radio transmission over the air. 
409 
I 
Plug into a wired network and function as an overlay to traditional or wired 
410 
LANs, or deploy as a standalone LAN where wired networking is not 
411 
feasible. 
412 
I 
Permit the use of portable computers or specialty devices in a system where 
413 
connection to the network is essential. Such systems are typically within a 
414 
building, for distances up to 1000 feet. 
415 
I 
Provide instant access or updates from anywhere in the facility. 
416 
I 
Allow users to roam without losing network connection.

Module 8: Wireless Technology 8-21 
In-building wireless LANs enable employees to stay connected to the organization's 
443 
network all the time. They no longer have to be “plugged into” a wired network to 
444 
gain access to the critical, real-time information systems that are the heartbeat of the 
445 
modern organization (see Figure [1]). 
446 
 
447 
This feature is especially useful to mobile employees and knowledge workers who 
448 
want to access real-time information while they are in conference rooms, reception 
449 
areas, temporary offices, and so forth. 
450 
 
451 
Like any distributed network, in-building wireless LANs start at the Ethernet 
452 
backbone. The backbone is connected to the servers that drive the customer's 
453 
intranet, applications, and access to the Internet (see Figure [2]).  
454 
 
455 
Access points attach directly into a company's Ethernet backbone via a 10/100 
456 
connection. The connection is wired. When on the network, access points function 
457 
like hubs, with shared network access. There are multiple access points, depending 
458 
on the area that requires coverage. 
459 
 
460 
In-building wireless LANs consist of access points and client adapters, usually PC 
461 
cards, working together to communicate data over radio frequencies.  
462 
 
463 
Wired LANs required users to have a dedicated physical connection to the network. 
464 
WLANs are an extension to the wired LAN network (see Figure [3]). WLANs can 
465 
be implemented as:  
466 
 
467 
I 
An overlay to a wired network to create a more complete networking 
468 
solution, so that users can roam the building and still stay connected to the 
469 
network 
470 
I 
A free-standing network in buildings or situations where pulling cable is not 
471 
feasible, such as in historic buildings and temporary structures; free-
472 
standing networks can be installed in one working day, enabling companies 
473 
to build fast, flexible LAN solutions  
474 
 
475 
With WLANs, the portable PC users can: 
476 
 
477 
I 
Move freely around a facility 
478 
I 
Enjoy real-time access to the wired LAN, at wired Ethernet speeds 
479 
I 
Access all the resources of wired LANs 
480 
 
481 
Note: Client adapters connect wireless clients, such as PCs or laptops, to a LAN via 
482 
radio communications with access points.

Access Points attach directly into a company's Ethernet backbone, 
488

At the center of the cell is the access point that receives the transmissions from the 
509 
PC cards. The access point is connected by wire into the LAN backbone. The access 
510 
point controls the transmissions in the cell and traffic flow into the network (see 
511 
Figure [1]).  
512 
 
513 
Remote devices do not communicate directly with each other. A remote device 
514 
communicates to the access point, which in turn transmits back out to other remote 
515 
devices. 
516 
 
517 
The WLAN consists of microcells that are also called the basic service area (BSA). 
518 
To extend the basic service area, you simply add additional access points. You can 
519 
add as many cells as you want to extend the range. A multicell configuration is 
520 
called an extended service area (see Figure [2]). Large in-building wireless 
521 
implementations are created by assembling many cells into multiple extended 
522 
service areas.  
523 
 
524 
Throughput varies, depending on the proximity of the remote device to the access 
525 
point. The closer you are to the access point, the faster the throughput. 
526 
 
527 
As stated earlier, WLAN consists of microcells (basic service area). The user can 
528 
move freely anywhere the radio frequency coverage permits (see Figure [3]). 
529 
Microcellular architecture refers to the ability to seamlessly roam between multiple 
530 
access points in a campus WLAN. This allows users to have constant access to their 
531 
company's intranet so they can run business-critical applications without 
532 
interruption.  
533 
 
534 
Note: Cells have to overlap by 10 to 15 percent, so that remote devices can roam 
535 
without losing their connection to the radio frequency band. This approach provides 
536 
maximum coverage with minimum cost. 
537 
 
538 
A typical WLAN can include PCs, laptop computers, pen-based computers, printers, 
539 
and any other device that is normally found on a typical wired network.

Building-to-building wireless LANs are wireless bridges and antennas that 
561 
communicate data between buildings over radio frequencies.  
562 
 
563 
Building-to-building wireless LANs enable organizations to quickly and cost-
564 
effectively set up networked campuses. Wireless campuses are useful to companies 
565 
that are rapidly expanding and need to keep their organizations connected as they 
566 
evolve. They also benefit operations that are spread across multiple buildings.  
567 
 
568 
Site-to-site wireless networks tie the LANs from one building to another building 
569 
via bridging (see Figure [1]). This setup can give a corporation high-speed 
570 
connectivity between two locations that otherwise might have been impossible. 
571 
Bridging eliminates the need for a T1 line, meaning no installation fee and no 
572 
recurring monthly fees. 
573 
  
574 
Wireless bridges connect into the Ethernet in their respective buildings. The bridges 
575 
use a variety of antennas to transmit a focused beam between buildings. The 
576 
antennas require a direct line of sight, so the radio beams are focused.  
577 
 
578 
Note: Wireless bridges are an alternative to a wired infrastructure. They can be up 
579 
and running with a fraction of the time and monetary investment required for a 
580 
wired alternative. 
581 
 
582 
When Cisco wireless bridges are correctly installed and aligned, they provide 
583 
reliable, high-speed connections, regardless of weather. 
584 
  
585 
Cisco Aironet bridges can be installed in both point-to-point and point-to-multipoint 
586 
configurations (see Figures [2] and [3]). 
587 
 
588 
Cisco Aironet bridges offer excellent connections between buildings. Like any radio 
589 
connection, the throughput declines as the distance between the buildings increases. 
590 
Consequently, multipoint configurations are sometimes required.

Summary 
603 
This section summarizes the key points you learned in this lesson. 
604 
 
605 
I 
Cisco currently offers two types of wireless LAN (WLAN) 
606 
implementations: wireless networking and wireless bridging. 
607 
I 
In-building WLANs use access points that serve as wireless hubs to which 
608 
mobile stations attach using radio frequency as OSI Layer 1.  
609 
I 
As users move from the reception area of one access point, they are 
610 
automatically picked up by another access point. 
611 
I 
The distance limits of an in-building wireless LAN vary, depending on the 
612 
type of construction, the number and type of barriers, and the amount of 
613 
electrical noise in the facility. 
614 
I 
Wireless bridges beam signals from one LAN to another whether they are 
615 
located in different buildings or on different floors of the same building.
