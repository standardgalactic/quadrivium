Foreword
Last summer, Paul Graham invited me to stop by his place in Cambridge, 
Massachusetts, for an intimate dinner. Just him, his wife, and the founders 
of three dozen extremely young startups in the Y Combinator program, a 
boot camp/incubator/angel investment thingy.
“Would you be willing to speak to these founders about, I don’t know, 
maybe pricing?” Paul asked me.
“Sure!” I said, and he whistled loudly to get everyone to quiet down.
I didn’t really have a speech prepared. There was no PowerPoint outline 
I could use as a crutch. The room was jam-packed. All eyes were on me. I 
didn’t know what I was going to say.
I thought I’d try a gambit.
“So . . .” I said. “Any questions?” Ten hands shot up. “Go ahead,” I 
said, pointing to a kid in the front row who, I imagine, had just gotten his 
braces off the week before.
And for almost two hours straight, these poor kids asked me the most 
basic questions imaginable about the business of startups. Pricing. Features. 
Marketing. Invoicing. They had so many questions.
I gave them as good a brain dump as I could on each topic. They sat 
raptly and asked intelligent follow-up questions.
These were smart kids, mind you: usually top computer science grad-
uates and plenty of experienced programmers. But for all their coding 
skills, they didn’t really know the first thing about making a business 
successful.
Which is OK. They’ll learn. It’s not that hard. The hardest part is real-
izing that even though you’re making an Internet company, writing the code 
and getting it to work is only a small part of the effort, and not necessarily the 
most critical one. The business side is just as crucial.

Foreword
xii
There’s a lot you’re going to need to learn to make your startup 
awesome. And this book that you hold in your hands, this very book, is a 
splendid introduction to the topic. Heck, I’ve been running Fog Creek for 
nine years now; I think I know a thing or two about a thing or two, and I 
learned something new on every page.
Every single page.
Yes, even that page with the interview of me.
This book is a fantastic resource for anyone doing a web startup or 
a software startup. Bob Walsh will teach you how to make your startup 
successful. Buy it, read it, put it under your pillow. Then buy copies for 
your cofounders. And go out there and nail it with a killer startup that 
makes the world a better place.

About the Author
My name is Bob Walsh (bob.walsh@47hats.com), 
and I believe that startups and microISVs (one-person 
software companies) represent the future of the 
global software industry and of the billion-person 
Internet to which we are all now connected. I believe 
this so strongly that this is my fifth book on the sub-
ject. My previous books are Micro-ISV: From Vision to 
Reality (Apress, 2006), Clear Blogging (Apress, 2007), MicroISV Sites That 
Sell! (ebook, 2008), and The Twitter Survival Guide, with Kristen Nicole 
(ebook, 2008).
In addition, I do a podcast with cohost Pat Foley (The Startup Success 
Podcast, at http://startuppodcast.wordpress.com) and write a blog (47 Hats, 
at http://47hats.com). I also comoderate Joel Spolsky’s Business of Software 
forum (http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/default.asp?biz).
My day job is consulting with startups and microISVs on how to increase 
their sales by better explaining their software on their web sites. But my 
real job since 2007 has been to recreate myself from a Windows desktop 
developer into a Rails web developer so that I can build and launch a faster 
way for startups to succeed: StartupToDo (http://startuptodo.com).
Before I got into all of the foregoing activities, I was a custom soft-
ware developer for 20-plus years, and before that a reporter. I like what 
I’m doing now a lot more than either of those past careers!

About the 
Technical Reviewer
Thomas Rushton has been programming since he got his first computer, 
a Sinclair ZX80. He has progressed through creating complex workflow 
and document management systems for financial and legal organiza-
tions. He has a BSc in computer science from Durham University and 
spent some research time in the field of software quality before moving 
into the more financially rewarding IT career roles of programmer, DBA, 
and consultant. He will soon be putting some of Bob Walsh's techniques 
into practice by creating his own microISV.
When not slaving away over a hot keyboard, he enjoys spending time 
with his wife, Sarah, their young son, William, and his double bass.

Acknowledgments
Writing a book—especially the way I do it, which is to ask a lot of knowl-
edgeable people a lot of pesky questions—means you have a lot of people 
to thank for making it possible.
First among equals has to be Joel Spolsky, who in 2005 helped open 
the door for me at Apress and who was kind enough to write the Foreword 
to this book and to give me a long interview.
Next I wish to thank Pam Slim, Lou Carbone, Dharmesh Shah, Eric Sink, 
David Allen, and Guy Kawasaki for sharing first with me and now with you 
their time, knowledge, and insight.
But wait, there’s more! For all their help I also offer hearty thanks to

Introduction
All I was doing back in 2005 was looking for a book on Amazon, honest! 
I’d just finished writing MasterList Professional, a Windows personal task 
manager, of which I planned to sell a million copies so that I could retire 
forever from my contract programming job. Only one problem: I couldn’t 
find a book on Amazon that explained how to sell those million copies. 
After 20+ years of dealing with clients and corporations, specs and custom 
apps, I knew zip about marketing, branding, positioning, software down-
loads, credit card processing, small business legalities, and the like. I 
needed that book. I didn’t find it.
So I wrote Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality (Apress, 2006). It did well. I 
started spending more and more time talking with the kind of people I 
liked, comoderating a forum on the business of software, conducting inter-
views for a podcast, and then working for actual money with startups and 
microISVs (self-funded startups). Then I wrote another book (on blog-
ging), followed by two e-books, and then created a new podcast (this time 
my own, The Startup Success Podcast, with the able help of my cohost, 
Pat Foley).
I like startups. Startup founders have a dream, a passion, a desire to 
make something happen, not just to do what others have done. But by 
mid-2007 I had come to realize three things. First, there had to be a better 
way to bootstrap a software business than either to hire someone expen-
sive like myself or to flail at it week after week. From this realization was 
born the idea of StartupToDo.
Second, I realized that to create StartupToDo I’d have to go from being 
a Windows desktop programmer to being a Ruby on Rails developer conver-
sant in JavaScript, Linux server admin, CSS—all the things I’d avoided up 
until then. I thought it would take six months for this—ha! Two years later, 
and with the help of a lot of people, I’m just about to launch.

Third, I realized that MasterList Professional, though a great program, 
was never going to sell those million copies and no longer occupied center 
stage in my life. It was time to move on from it, from Windows, and from 
desktop programming.
Thus I wrote this book. The Web Startup Success Guide is kind of the 
Kill Bill Vol. II of what it takes to create a successful startup. I have written 
it for all those developers who are ready to step up and create more than 
just an alternative to programming for money for someone else. There’s a 
whole other story now to be explored and told, one being written by tens 
of thousands of developers on the Web, on mobile and social platforms, 
even on desktops. Right now it’s a story unfolding in front of a backdrop 
of global economic disruption, which paradoxically makes it a great time 
for startups—disruption creates opportunity, engenders new needs, and 
changes old ideas.
I think this book turned out very well, thanks to the several hundred 
people who were kind enough to answer my questions, correct my assump-
tions, and share their experience. I hope you learn as much reading it as I 
did writing it, and I look forward to hearing about your startup’s successes in 
the days ahead.

Please Insert Chip into Brain
“Welcome to your startup,” the small grey chip intones. “Before insert-
ing this EasyBrain Start-Your-Own-Startup Module in the USB 5.0 or 
greater slot at the base of your skull, the manufacturer has instructed 
me to acquaint you with some of the safety features, key differentiators, 
and software requirements for your new 21st century startup.”
We’re not there yet, but in this chapter I would like to provide you 
with some much-needed Future Shock1 treatment about realities and the 
(mostly online) world your startup is going to face. Understanding and 
exploiting the way things work now instead of getting caught up in how 
things used to work will make a huge difference in whether creating and 
growing your startup turns out to be the dream of your life or a very bad 
nightmare.
When I wrote Micro-ISV: From Vision to Reality in 2005, the big news 
was how to build a one- or two-person self-funded startup selling software 
directly to customers via the Internet. This new economic reality super-
seded the days of shareware and donationware. Google, sites such as 
Download.com, and shareware2 payment processors meant you could sell 
desktop software directly to customers without spending millions of dollars 
1 Throughout this book you’re going to find veiled and unveiled references to futurist Alvin Toffler’s 
books, starting with Future Shock (1970) through Revolutionary Wealth (2006) but especially The 
Third Wave (1980). Why? Because, in my opinion, Toffler has consistently done a better job than 
anyone else publishing at publically predicting what our society is going to look like. The better handle 
you have on the future, the better you’ll be able to live and thrive there.
2 Shareware: Pre-Google 20th century software revenue model for maverick desktop programmers. 
Relied on propagating trial, time-limited/crippled/nagging copies via pre-Web forums called BBSs and, 
later, portal sites such as Tucows.com and Download.com. If you liked the app, you bought it.

What’s Changed Since Micro-iSV: From Vision to Reality
Some of you reading this book may have read my book Micro-ISV: From Vision 
to Reality (Apress 2006) and be wondering what’s changed. It’s not so much 
what’s changed—just about every section and every link in my first book is 
still valid. It’s just that there’s now a whole new layer of opportunity, tools, 
and expectations that have taken off: Call it Web 2.0 (or 3.0). Or call it the 
Online World, as I do.
What’s changed is that web-based software, including web-centric desktop, 
social, and mobile clients, have come into their own. The days of doing it 
Microsoft’s way or the highway are long over; so too are the days you could 
copy David Heinemeier Hansson’s 10-minute Rails demo, slap some Google 
AdWords on it, and sit back and count your money.
The old ways still work—to a lesser degree. But it’s the new ways that startups 
can define, deliver, and market their Internet and community-centric value 
that are the New Big Thing and what this book explores. You don’t believe 
me? Here are a few terms/apps that had not gained the importance they now 
have—or didn’t exist—when I wrote my first book.
As I said, things have changed in the software startup world—and those 
changes are what we’re going to be covering in this book.
Well, CompUSA’s hundreds of computer stores with boxed software 
on shelves are gone; and so too are the days of easy VC money for any four 
people with a business plan with the words Web 2.0 or social media in it.

The New Online Economic Reality 
and Your Startup
Things in the world outside IT have changed as well, to put it mildly, 
as the global economy, currently officially in recession, lurches through 
financial crisis after crisis and the buying habits and attitudes of people 
and companies in the developed world are forced to change.3
We are not going to talk about a lot about the woes and tribulations 
of the Offline Economy in this book. First, as Neil Davidson rightly points 
out later in this chapter, there’s not much you can do about it. Second, 
because if you focus on the things you can do something about, your odds 
improve.
If you’re going to win this game called Build a Successful Startup, you 
are going to need to get deep into it: live it, breathe it, obsess about it, suck 
up every bit of knowledge that can help, Google every question you have.
That means knowing some history about the industry you plan to 
take by storm. I know, not as much fun as the latest Rails Envy4 podcast, 
but this is stuff you need to know.
A Ridiculously Short History of Software Startups
For those of you who haven’t been in the industry since day 1, here’s a very 
short history of software startups, to provide some perspective on how we 
got to where we are. It’s a story of how an industry that got started by accident, 
grew to change the world, and continues to evolve today.
In the beginning (pre-1976), software wasn’t something that was sold. As 
small communities of computer scientists huddled around dumb terminals 
waiting for their punch cards to read and their paper tapes to spool, soft-
ware was just another kind of information to be shared in the academic/
scientific world. Software was sold—but as part of the package of services, 
documentation, and, most of all, hardware from IBM and a few other companies.
3 “A horrific holiday season for retailers. . . . Holiday sales fell from 2% to 4% compared to a year ago, 
according to SpendingPulse, a division of MasterCard Advisors. Excluding gas and car sales, they 
dropped between 5.5% and 8% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, as key categories from luxury to elec-
tronics posted double-digit declines. Sales of electronics and appliances fell almost 27%.”—from 
“Bankruptcy looms for many retail stores” (AP, January 5, 2009). “Meanwhile, online, while sales were 
down for some vendors, 2008 was their best holiday season yet. Amazon lead the way with selling 
6.3 million items in one day that were delivered to 210 countries”—from “Amazon.com’s 14th Holiday 
Season Is Best Ever.”

The 1970s saw computers shrink from the size of rooms to the size of 
refrigerators to something you could put on a desk without breaking the 
desk, as electronic hobbyists (a kind of DIY person) assembled micro-computer 
kits and wrote their own software that they swapped in clubs while the 
established mainframe computer vendors clued into the idea of actually selling 
their software instead of giving it away.
These computer kits could have gone the way of Heathkit FM radio kits, 
except for one thing—with software, they could actually do things like calcu-
late payroll taxes. Where was the software to come from? Although the real 
story is a lot messier, our story comes to a fork in the road. On the high 
road is Richard Stallman and others who believed that software should be 
free—free to modify, free to own, free to do what you want with. Call this 
the road that led to Open Source.
Then there was the other road—the people on the first road would call the 
low road. It started with an open letter from a pissed-off developer who 
discovered his software had been pirated. “Who can afford to do professional 
work for nothing? What hobbyist can put three man-years into programming, 
finding all bugs, documenting his product and distribute for free?” The pissed-off 
developer was 22-year-old Bill Gates, who was struggling to make his startup’s 
Altair BASIC a paying proposition.
Yes, that Bill Gates. While some developers can do little but grind their teeth at 
software pirates, not Bill—his Albuquerque, New Mexico, startup got a better 
name, he moved back to his folks’ house in Redmond, Washington, and, oh 
yes, built the software colossus known as Microsoft, with 90,000 employees 
and global annual revenue of $60.42 billion in 2008.
The 1980s, ’90s, and through to June 27, 2008, when he finally quit his day 
job, was The Age of Bill, during which he took PCs from being hobby kits to 
running the world. It was the age first of DOS, then of Windows, Windows, 
Windows as Developers, Developers, Developers5 created tens of thousands 
of startups selling software in computer stores.
The Age of Bill was also the Age of Steve—Steve Jobs, who built Apple from 
a startup selling 50 personal computer kits to a local store to a 32,000-
employee, $32.48 billion sales corporation, the most admired company in 
2008.6 Steve’s company was always the cooler, hipper, more with it of the 
two, which was okay with Bill, since his company owned more than 90% of 
the market, through to this day. But the ads7 hurt (Figure 1.1).
5 Steve Ballmer, Bill Gates’ friend from Harvard before he dropped out and, more importantly, the 
hard-driving CEO of Microsoft, is famous for his “Developers! Developers! Developers!” chants at various 
Microsoft events. See http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8To-6VIJZRE and http://www.

Figure 1-1. PC and Mac
Since this is a ridiculously short history, I’m leaving out a great deal, such as 
Steve Wozniak, the U.S. Department of Justice antitrust suit against Microsoft, 
various business practices, good and bad, by both companies, and a lot more. 
The main thing is that Bill and Steve built a world of stand-alone micro-
computers that are found on desks throughout most of the world, and if you 
wanted to start your own software company, you were most likely going to 
write a Windows or Mac desktop application.
Then along came the Internet, the World Wide Web, and Marc Andreessen. 
Andreessen cowrote the first popular web browser, Mosaic, in 1993, while 
in college, and then hooked up with a Silicon Valley entrepreneur named Jim 
Clark to found the startup Netscape Communications to popularize the 
World Wide Web created by Tim Berners-Lee in 1989. Over the next six 
years the upstart Netscape battled Microsoft, ultimately losing. During this 
time, the Web went from a tiny plaything you could summarize on one 
Netscape What’s New page to at least 63 billion pages and 1.4 billion people 
7 Apple’s Get a Mac ad campaign was a hit from day 1 in 2006 because the ads captured so well the 
personalities of Windows (suit and tie, unhip) and Mac (casual clothes, laid back).

in 20088 selling and buying hundreds of billions of dollars worth of goods, 
services, and software in the United State alone.9
What Andreessen and Clark started in October 1994 culminated with the 
dot-com boom in the closing days of the last century. It was a time of initial 
public offerings, Internet millionaires racing down Silicon Valley’s Highway 280, 
sock puppets dominating Super Bowl commercials, and dot-com startups 
blasting into the popular culture and onto the mainstream economy’s 
center stage.
While all the media attention was on the Web 1.0 VC-funded Silicon Valley/
Alley/Fen/Forest startups, a whole bunch of the little guys who wrote soft-
ware and sold it themselves in Bill and Steve’s world began to cut out the 
software distributors and retail stores and sell directly to people and companies. 
Shareware and donationware was growing up from its church rummage 
sale–like days of being sold in plastic baggies over electronic bulletin board 
systems. Now, one-person firms, such as Elfring Fonts in Chicago and Nova-
Mind in Queensland, Australia, could connect with a global market online.
Then dot-com boom went bust. You’d come back Thursday to a South-of-
Market San Francisco dot-com startup that Wednesday had had 30 people 
franticly running around, phones ringing everywhere, and walk into an office 
with no people, no power, no phones—just a mass of Herman Miller Aeron 
Chairs against a wall next to a stack of PCs and CRT monitors.
For startups and VCs the game of fund it, flip it, IPO it, and become an Internet 
bazillionaire ended in March 2000. According to one report, the dot-com 
crash wiped out $5 trillion in market value of technology companies between 
March 2000 and October 2002.10 With a few notable exceptions—eBay, 
Amazon, Google—mainstream media wrote the obituary for startups large 
and small.
But as with a lot of newspaper stories—back in the day when newspapers 
weren’t writing their own obituaries—there was more to this story. While 
talking heads on television intoned about The End of It All as the NASDAQ 
tanked, three things were happening: Google—specifically Google AdWords —
was making it easier and easier for software companies to find customers. 
The cost of creating software, of creating a startup, were dropping as distributed 
companies (no big office to lease), virtualization (no huge server farms), and

better and better Open Source tools (no large licensing outlays) chopped 
the cost of doing software online down to well under one-tenth of what it 
had cost a few short years previously.
Third, and most of all, the Web grew and grew. And it continues to grow—
and to change the world—to this day.
These small, self-funded startups finally got a name and a voice when Eric Sink, 
the founder of one such startup wrote Exploring Micro-ISVs back in September 
2004. The reality that made it possible for single developers to create mostly 
desktop, mostly consumer-orientated software began to coalesce into a set 
of business practices and shared knowledge and attitudes. Forums such as 
Joel on Software’s Business of Software, books, and blog posts spread this 
knowledge around the global developer community while the venture capital-
ists were licking their dot-com-bust wounds on Sand Hill Road in Palo Alto.
If there was one single event that signaled the start of the current era of 
software startups, I’d point to the founding of seed-stage funding firm and 
startup factory Y Combinator in 2005. Paul Graham, one of those Internet 
millionaires, convinced that the cost of successfully launching startups had 
dropped to the point that it was now more about ideas and support than 
multimillion-dollar private equity funding, launched Y Combinator—an ongoing 
series of three-month-long boot camps providing access to industry insiders 
and funding in the range of $5000 to $20,000—betting it could transform 
20-something developers into software companies.
Y Combinator graduates were only a small sliver of the wave of startups that 
have shaken up the established order, but they are a representative sampling 
of what the current wave of startups are all about, as opposed to the software 
companies that came before them. They are about doing things online: every-
thing from sharing documents to making payments, to networking with online 
friends, to all sorts of business activities that have to do with online content 
and online concerns.
The three most striking attributes that distinguish startups today—and some-
thing we get to play with for the rest of this book—are the “onlineness” of 
these startups, how little money compared to the past is needed to launch, 
and how many of these startups are focused on problems and opportunities 
that did not exist 24 months or 12 months or 6 months or sometimes only 
1 month ago. For someone interested in building a startup, it’s a great time 
to be doing so.

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
8
So, What’s a Startup? And Why 
Would I Want to Be One?
Let’s begin with what a startup is not: It’s not a business that writes code 
for other companies, whether that’s you as a consultant, a contract pro-
grammer, a freelancer, or a custom programmer. Nor is it a small IT con-
sulting company that has a codebase—proprietary or Open Source—that 
it customizes extensively for each of its clients. Nor is it a department, 
division, or team spun out from a corporation and told to go act like a 
startup and build something cool.
For the purposes of this book, a startup comprises one to about eight 
people, mostly developers, who’ve banded together to create a codebase 
whose benefits they will offer to the world, especially the online world. 
That codebase often can be accessed via the Web, but it can also become 
an executable on a Windows PC or Mac, run when downloaded to a game 
console such as Microsoft Xbox or live in a smartphone such as an Apple 
iPhone.
They may initially be entirely self-funded, but they’re more than likely 
at some point early on to seek funding from either family and friends or 
angel investors or venture capitalists or a progression of all three. The dis-
tinction between startups and microISVs—given as much distinction as 
there is—revolves around funding and size. A sole developer funding the 
building of their software and company? That’s a microISV. Three devel-
opers and a web designer who raise $200,000 to build a web app from fam-
ily, friends, and an angel investor network? That’s definitely a startup.
So why leave the relatively safe harbors of corporate life or consulting 
to venture into the global market and launch a startup? Specific motiva-
tions are as varied as the people who have them—and people in the startup 
world tend to be anything but homogeneous.
A startup can be about making money—and we will be focusing on 
that part of building a successful startup a great deal in this book—but 
not always so. Given how low the costs of web apps have fallen in recent 
years, you may decide that making money is not one of the reasons you 
want to build a startup. You might be motivated by simple love of coding 
and a desire to share something you built with others who may have the 
same problem you’ve solved.

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
9
But if I had to guess your motivation, I’d bet that the chance to make 
some serious, life-changing money was at the top of the list, with a close 
second the keen desire not to be told what to do and how to do by people 
who couldn’t code/design their way out of a paper bag.
Good for you! That’s where I’m coming from and what motivates to a 
lesser or greater degree nearly all of the people in this industry since it 
became an industry. And while some may sniff that money can’t buy you 
happiness, not having money guarantees you unhappiness.
Now comes the first key question in this book: What kind of startup 
makes sense for you?
Startup Flavors—Take Your Pick
Before you decide, here’s a quick rundown of what I see as the five kinds 
of startups that exist today.
Traditional
Directions: This tried-and-true kind of startup has been around since 
Silicon Valley was more orchards than office buildings. Take one serial 
entrepreneur/CEO, a mix of seasoned executives, and a few über-
programmer gurus, sprinkle well with connections to VCs inside and 
out of the Valley, add $8 million in Series A VC funding. Hire a PR 
firm to get you mentioned in TechCrunch, coders (preferably offshore) 
to do most of the actual coding, and a customer-focus consulting 
company to tell you what your customers want. Preferably place 
everything in an office building in Palo Alto, Mountain View, or 
Sunnyvale, and bake. Do not worry about revenue or profit for the 
first few months, sometimes years, after you launch. Change the 
world, get bought, go public, or disappear without a trace in 18 months.
Key ingredients: An entrepreneur CEO who’s done this before 
(hopefully successfully), a team of respected industry executives 
that can actually execute the mad visions of the CEO, and, most 
of all, VC money and lots of it.
Pros: This is more or less how every major player in this game got 
built—eBay, Amazon, PayPal, Google, YouTube, Skype—to name a 
few wildly successful examples.

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
10
Cons: This is also the model that AltaVista, Boo.com,11 Freeinternet.
com, Inktomi, and others used. Where are those companies now? 
Acquired for pennies on the dollar or simply gone.
Bottom line: Worked then, works now—if you’re the right person 
(and if you are, you probably don’t need to read this book). The VC-
centric startup was the only way to go during the 1980s and ’90s. 
Fortunately, we now have alternatives.
MicroISV
Directions: Take one or perhaps two experienced developers tired of 
working for somebody else, an unmet business or more likely consumer 
need, and add nights, weekends, and missed family events as you 
struggle to bootstrap your business while consulting or holding down 
a day job. Don’t add outside funding. Most likely you’ll deploy to 
Windows, Mac, or, now, the iPhone.
Key ingredients: Solid technical expertise with some basic graphic 
skills so that people won’t point and laugh when your web site launches. 
Be prepared to wear many hats in your business—developer, sysadmin, 
marketing VP, blogger, salesman, you name it.
Pros: You can build a microISV that makes, say, three to five times as 
much as you can make programming for someone else. You might 
even be able to sell it or, if you work very, very hard, grow to be a very 
successful software vendor, for example, Joel Spolsky and Michael 
Pryor of Fog Creek Software.12
Cons: Bootstrapping—building your MicroISV while making a living 
doing something else is damned hard—too hard for most sane people. 
If you picked the right idea, if you can execute it, if you can then change 
from Doctor Programmer into Mister Marketer, if you work at your 
marketing day in and day out, if you keep improving your application 
and answer 5,000 e-mails from customers who want to ask you just 
one 500-word question, you may be successful. But the lack of capital, 
11 Boo.com went through $188 million in just six months before going bust in May 2000 attempting 
to build a global online fashion store. That takes style! http://query.nytimes.com/gst/

11
the to-do list that never gets smaller, and, frankly, the loneliness may 
trap you in a situation where you’re putting in 60-hour weeks and 
making about what you did working for somebody else—or less.
Bottom line: I was a microISV, bootstrapping MasterList Professional 
into existence, only to realize that I knew squat about everything 
else I had to do and that I had to write a book to learn all of that non-
developer stuff.13 Late in 2008 I sold my microISV to a sharp devel-
oper who wanted to become a microISV and I launched a web app, 
StartupToDo, that I hope will attract angel funding and the right 
partners to be a full-fledged startup.
If you check the blogs, forums such Joel on Software’s Business of 
Software, and the Association of Shareware Professionals or attend con-
ferences such as the Software Industry Conference in the United States or 
the European Software Conference, you’ll find microISVs that are living 
the dream of successful self-employment. If you look closer, you’ll find 
companies, such as Fog Creek Software, Brisworks, and IDV Solutions, 
who’ve successfully grown out of the microISV stage and now employee 
dozens, sometimes hundreds, of people. It’s not easy, it’s not for every-
one, but it can work.
Side Project
Directions: Start with a small but persistent pain. It could be a gap 
between you and some existing program or web app, a feature no one 
seems to realize is needed, or just a desire to see what you can code. 
Add a programmer with some spare time but not a desire (or at least 
the skill sets needed) to make his or her side project a full-fledged 
startup.
Key ingredients: Build out the tool, library, or site, stick it up on a 
server, let people use it, move on.
Pros: Side projects are great résumé builders, differentiating you 
from other programmers and developers who haven’t something cool 
they can show off. They can also be the starting point for any one of 
the other kinds of startups. Think of it as a proto-startup.
13 Trust me: you don’t write a book unless circumstances or inner demons hold burning coals to the 
soles of your feet.

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
12
Take, for example, Blog Action Day (http://blogactionday.org/), 
started by Australian web designer Collis Ta’eed in 2007 as a way of 
focusing bloggers worldwide on one important topic on a given day. 
On October 15, 2008, 12,800 bloggers—17 of the top 100 blogs—
posted about poverty—with an estimated readership of 13.4 million 
people. “Blog Action Day is organised as a non-profit activity by a 
group of volunteer bloggers and the staff of Envato who donate their 
time and resources. It started as a ‘what would happen if’ question 
and simply took on a life of its own.”
Cons: Not many. The price of a decent VPS—virtual private server—
is heading south day by day, and one such server can host as many 
side projects as you have bandwidth and time for. But is your side 
project truly a side project, or is it a startup missing most of the 
pieces—usually those marketing, branding, nontechnical pieces?
Bottom line: Side projects are a great way to build your program-
ming reputation, make new toys to play with, and get your feet wet in 
all those other things you have to do to put something out that people 
can actually use, besides looking good on the résumé. What’s miss-
ing is both the pain of having to do right all the things you don’t nat-
urally like to do and the reward (money) that comes when you align 
all the pieces so that people are prepared to buy what you’ve created.
Open Source Project
Directions: Start as the last gasp of a software company beaten into 
the ground by a rival, or as a business looking to make money around 
instead of with a core product, or as a part-time contractor working 
for Chicago-based web design house who unlocks the power of an 
obscure Japanese programming language, or as someone who 
has solved a problem and wants to give back to the community 
of programmers who helped his or her: Open Source projects— 
software platforms, languages, applications, and libraries with freely 
available and modifiable source code—have remade the software 
business.
The first three examples just mentioned—Mozilla Foundation and 
Firefox, MySQL AB (later Sun Microsystems and now Oracle) and 
MySQL, and David Heinemeier Hansson and Ruby on Rails—are 
just the beginning of a long list of Open Source projects that have 

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
13
profoundly influenced software development and the values of many 
software developers.
Key ingredients: Rock star programmers, dozens, sometimes hun-
dreds, of other highly skilled programmers with commit rights and, 
most of all, needs not being met adequately by proprietary software.
Pros: Open Source projects in an Online World where costs have 
plummeted to predominantly the development time can make com-
mercial sense. MySQL AB sold to Sun for about $1 billion. And some 
Open Source projects, such as ExtJS (http://extjs.com), can become 
the starting point for successful commercial startups.
Cons: Like side projects, for every Firefox there are 5,000 Open Source 
projects that never ignite the imagination of enough programmers to 
matter much. Although many, if not most, startups use Open Source 
to write their code, run their servers, serve their apps, or all three, an 
Open Source startup is a rare bird in the wild.
Bottom line: New software companies who have at their core an Open 
Source project are rare, but their numbers are growing. The underly-
ing tension between “Software should be Free!” and “We Want to 
Make Money!” is hard to reconcile in the pressure cooker of starting 
a new business as well. The most likely path of success is to build a 
great Open Source project, and the money will come—something 
most funding sources have a hard time buying.
Modern Online Software Startup
Directions: You and one to three people you know, like, and trust 
want to build a profitable software business on the Web. The application 
will most likely be a web app, but it could also be for the Apple iPhone, 
some other mobile device, or even a desktop app. You’ve not done this 
before, and you’ve never (successfully) asked your family or friends to 
put tens of thousands of dollars into one of your ideas, let alone 
hundreds of thousands of dollars from strangers.
Key ingredients: A really good original idea of how to meet a need 
that a lot of people have (whether they know it now is secondary), a 
solid, innovative, easy-to-use application that solves that need attrac-
tively and robustly (notice that I put attractively first), a clear and 
compelling unique selling proposition that you position in the market-
place via social media and standard marketing, a strong willingness 

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
14
and ability to learn the pieces of this particular puzzle that you don’t 
know and may not care about, and a really stupendous amount of 
hard work.
Pros: The cost of software development and deployment have never 
been lower. The same is true for the cost of connecting to and get-
ting sales from your market.
Meanwhile, in the offline economy, buffeted as it is by recession, 
globalization, and change, there has not been so much demand for 
new ideas and new ways of solving problems since the end of World 
War II. And in the online economy, which has in the last few years 
thrown off its dependence on the offline economy, the demand for 
solutions to problems and needs that didn’t exist years or even months 
ago grows at Internet speed.
Cons: The odds are, at best, problematical (although hopefully reading 
this book will move them in your favor!). You could fail—spectacularly—
and everyone from your parents, from whom you borrowed money, to 
your ex-coworkers to the modern-day gossip columnist known as 
ValleyWag14 will let you know that you failed.
Bottom line: You wouldn’t be reading this book if a major part of you 
didn’t want to go for it and build your own startup. It will not be easy, 
but if you work your strengths, understand and compensate for your 
weaknesses, and keep moving toward the day your startup becomes a 
reality, it will become a reality.
When Is the Right Time to Jump?
Finally, here’s one question you might be asking yourself: Is this the right 
time to launch a startup? There’s no simple, binary answer to this. But I 
do think that, at least from 2009 to 2014, the answer to the opposite 
question—Is this the wrong time to launch a startup?—is a resounding no.
Here’s the short version of why: the only sure bet you can make about 
this period is that economic disruption and ever-accelerating change are 
the rule of the day.
For a longer, more detailed answer, I called on two people who know 
a lot about this IT world, Neil Davidson, who runs a hundred-plus-person 
software company in the U.K., and Don Dodge, who seeks out startups for 
Microsoft to acquire to get their opinions.

Neil Davidson, Business of Software Conference
Figure 1-2. Neil Davidson, Co-CEO of Red Gate Software
From starting Cambridge-based Red Gate Software in 1999, Neil Davidson 
(Figure 1-2) and Simon Galbraith have grown it into a 135-person company, 
ranked by The Times of London as 39th of the best 100 companies to work 
for in the entire United Kingdom in 2008. In addition to co-running Red Gate, 
Neil has teamed up with Joel Spolsky of Fog Creek Software to produce the 
annual Business of Software Conference, a gathering of both startups and 
established companies.
We’ll get into the details of the Business of Software Conference in Chapter 4, 
but for now I wanted to tap Neil’s experience and insight as to whether now 
is the right time to launch a startup.
Bob: We all devoutly hope this year is not going to be as bad as the last year. 
What do you see as the future for startups?
Neil: I think the future is pretty good for startups. I’m not sure I’d go as far 
as saying it’s better than ever, however. I don’t think the outlook in 2009 is 
significantly different from the outlook of 2008 or the outlook in 2007.
And the reason I said that is because I’ve looked into this in some detail and 
I’ve talked to quite a few professors about this. That factors that determine 
whether a startup succeeds or fails can broadly be split into two categories. 
They’ve got what they call of the exogenous factors and the endogenous factors, 
which is kind of a posh way of saying factors out of your control.
So, whether the startup succeeds or fails depends in part on the economy 
and depends in part on the industry that you’re in. So, if you pick a dumb 
industry or a really dumb market niche to be in, then it’s going to be hard 
for you to succeed.
But the other stuff, which is really important, is the internal stuff. So, it’s 
things like motivation. So, if you are a microISV, for example, one of the key 
factors to determine the success of the business is how dedicated you are to 
your startup. So, how much time you put into it and how much effort you 
put into it. And if you don’t put in that time, you just can’t do it. I mean there’s 
no way you can build a successful business if you’re doing something else as 
a full-time job.

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
16
It’s something you should put your heart into. It’s something you going to 
work all day. And then you’re going to go home and then you get to work 
another four hours. And then when you sleep, you’re going to think about it 
a lot. And that’s not something that you can do if you’re not into something 
full time.
The other internal factor is do you really care about your product? Are you 
doing this product to get rich, or you’re doing this product because you 
really, really care about what you do? This is a product that you should care 
so much about that you’ll work incredible hours and put incredible energy 
in it to make it a success. Or is it a product that you’re sort of doing because 
you think it’s a cool way to make some money?
And although there are external factors like the economy and the industry 
and you can’t affect those, and that fact is pretty core to them. The internal 
factors are still the same. So, whether you do your startup in 2010 or whether 
you did it in 2009, there’s still a whole bunch of stuff that is really important, 
and that’s not going to change.
Bob: So, really, what you’re saying is the key factors to a startup’s success 
are the internal factors that you can control mainly, your level of dedication, 
commitment, perseverance, and probably, most of all, work.
Neil: Yes.
Bob: And that’s what really matters. The external factors are going to be 
the external factors, but it’s those internal factors that you need to think 
about and do what you can to improve. Hence a good reason to go to places 
like the Business Software Conference.
Neil: [Laughter] Exactly! Of course, the execution is about is about the plan. 
So, if you pick a market that’s crap or you can pick an industry that’s going 
down it’s not going to help. That’s going to be the case whether in 2009 
or 2008.
So, if you pick a product that isn’t going to have a market, that’s probably not 
going to have a market in either year. Obviously you don’t sell a product 
which depends on the banking industry to succeed because that’s just going 
to take a lot of luck.
2009 and on are going to be interesting because there’s a lot of change 
happening, so a lot of things are changing. When stuff changes, then the 
status quo gets disrupted. And when the status quo gets disrupted, then 
there are opportunities to do things.
The other example is: When do you think it’s a better time to start a startup, at 
the peak of a bubble or the trough of the bust? So, if you had started up a 
company in 2000, for example, or at the end of 1999, you pretty much had 
more of a chance of failing, even though that was in the kind of a peak in the 
middle of the bubble. But if you start a company at the trough of the bust, 
you pretty much have more of a chance of succeeding.

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
17
If you were setting up a company in 2000, for example, you’d probably set 
up a company that would do something like deliver coffee beans online, sort 
of do pet food online or deliver books online or whatever and you live on 
hope. So, the whole industry will pop. And all these venture capitalists 
wanted their money back and banks called their loans and it went pop.
So, you’d have a high chance of failure. But if you set up that company in 2009, 
for start you’re not going to do a stupid idea, which has a low chance of 
success in a recession, because you’re just not going to be that stupid. If you’re 
going to be that stupid, then you’re not going to get money for a start. So, if the 
quality of the ideas that you have or the quality of the ideas that are going to fly 
are going to be better in a recession or at the beginning of the recession, they 
are going to be during a boom. That’s what I think, anyway.
Does that make sense or not?
Bob: I think it does. Think of it as evolution in action. If you can survive the 
harsh economic climates that we’re looking at right now, well, everything 
from there goes up.
Neil: Yes.
Bob: Okay, one last question. Any advice that you would give to a devel-
oper who is thinking about getting a couple of his mates together to form a 
startup today?
Neil: I’d say, think about it a lot and plan it and save up the money and then 
just kind of do it, because it’s one of the things you kind of theorize a lot, but 
until you actually do it, you’re never going to know if it works or not.
Don Dodge, Director, Business Development at Microsoft
Figure 1-3. Don Dodge, Director of Business Development for Microsoft’s 
Emerging Business Team

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
18
Don Dodge (Figure 1-3) is a veteran of five startups, including Forte Software, 
AltaVista, Napster, Bowstreet, and Groove Networks. Don is currently 
Director of Business Development for Microsoft’s Emerging Business Team, 
which means his day job consists of finding startups Microsoft should either 
acquire, invest in, or help connect to a VC.
Bob: So, let’s start with maybe just a little bit of bio. How did you end up 
working for Microsoft, and what have you done with your life?
Don: Well, I have been a startup guy. I did five startups. Some of them you’ll 
know and some of them are obscure tools and database companies. But the 
first one was Forte Software. That was back in the late ’80s, early ’90s. And 
the company went public in the early ’90s and was acquired by Sun Micro-
systems soon thereafter. The next one was AltaVista.
Bob: Oh, yeah.
Don: I was the director of engineering at AltaVista, and of course we were 
the first search engine on the Web and I started out doing that. And then 
later I put together a group that developed the first multimedia search, 
searching for pictures and video and music, which seems pretty simple now, 
but 10 or 12 years ago it was impossible. So, it was kind of a new thing. And 
after that, I joined this tiny little startup with six or eight people called Napster, 
which of course everybody knows about now, but at that time it was a tiny 
little company that nobody knew about, and that was to bring music sharing 
and file sharing to the Web.
And after Napster, I did another startup called Bowstreet, which was a web 
services application development company and back when web services was 
a very new thing. So, that is one of the first application servers and tools to 
build web service–based applications.
And the last one was Grove Networks. Grove Networks was a peer-to-peer 
collaboration company, and Ray Ozzie was the founder and leader of that 
company. And since then Microsoft acquired Grove Networks and Ray 
Ozzie took over for Bill Gates. I am working at Microsoft helping startups 
and building partnerships with Microsoft. So, there it is, 20 years.
Bob: There you go. Now, here is a question for you: What’s changed and 
what hasn’t in those 20 years between then and now?
Don: Wow, a lot! For one thing, it is much easier to start a company now 
than it ever has been. The first startup I did, Forte Software, we raised $32 
million, and that was considered a gigantic amount of money to start a company, 
a software company, back then. Going forward from there, I worked at two 
startups that raised $150 million of venture capital to do a software startup. 
So, it was just incredibly expensive to start a company. Today, with web 
services and cloud infrastructure and free development tools, just every-
thing is easier, less expensive, so it is just so much easier to start a company 
now than it ever was before.

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
19
Bob: That’s one that’s a big change. How about something that has stayed 
constant?
Don: Well, the constant I think is that, yes, it is easier to start a company 
today, but it still takes a lot of time and money to scale it to millions and 
millions of customers. So, that has stayed the same, and that is why venture 
capital is still a vital component of building a large company. Yes, you can 
start a company for almost nothing and you can get it out to the market with 
the Web and you can target initial users and get some traction, but if you 
really want to take it to the next level where you have millions and millions 
of users and tens of millions of dollars in revenue, it takes money to do that.
The second thing is, because it is so easy to start a company today, there are 
thousands and thousands of them. And the challenge is to rise above the 
noise and to get noticed. There are a variety of approaches you can take to 
do that. Some of them are free, some of them cost money, but you still have 
to do it.
And in some ways, it is more difficult now to be noticed just because there 
are so many companies out there, where in the past, the hurdle, the amount 
of money needed to rise and the hurdles to starting a business were larger, 
so there were a fewer of them.
Bob: So less money, but more noise.
Don: Exactly.
Bob: Let’s talk about now and, since I am writing a book here rather than a 
blog, now sort of 2009, 2010, 2011: What do you see as the outlook for—
I guess I will ask it two ways, startups and startups getting money from venture 
capital?
Don: Right. As I said earlier, it has never been easier to start a company. 
And in some ways, during a downturn or a recession like we are in now, it 
is almost easier to start a company, for several reasons. First one is, the key 
to starting a successful company is finding great people to work with you. 
And in the boom times, when everything is going great and companies are 
growing and new projects are being built, all the good people are busy. They 
are working on fun projects, and it is very difficult for a startup to lure them 
away from what they are doing to take on a risky startup in the boom times.
In the bad times, people are laid off, exciting new projects are cancelled, 
companies retrench and focus on the core competencies, so some of the 
exciting stuff isn’t getting done. So, in these times it is easier to recruit great 
people to come work on the next big thing. So, that is the advantage of starting 
a company in difficult times. That’s one. Another is that in tough times like 
these, only the good companies get funded. So, in some respects, it is easier 
to get funding because you are not competing with hundreds and hundreds 
of marginal ideas that would have been funded in the good days but that won’t 
get funding in difficult times. So, if you have a really great idea that’s got some 

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
20
initial traction, you are able to get it off the ground and get some initial traction; 
in some ways it is easier to get funding for that type of company today than 
it was four or five years ago.
Bob: Let’s turn to Microsoft for a moment here. Let’s start with, what does 
Microsoft think of all these web-app startups that are flourishing all over the 
place?
Don: Well, Microsoft loves startups. As you know, my job at Microsoft is 
working with startups and helping them get started, making introductions, 
introducing them to angels and venture capitalists, introducing them to people 
at Microsoft, getting them software, that sort of thing. We have a great new 
program called BizSpark.
Bob: I actually know it well, and the reason I know it well is that I am the 
number 1 BizSpark Partner in the world as of about a week ago.
Don: You are right, 47 Hats. I saw a report that said 47 Hats and saw all the 
startups that you signed up, I mean, Wow, who is this guy? You are number 1.
Bob: BizSpark is a very cool program. I mean, it does completely level the 
financial playing field between Microsoft, which is proprietary, and Open 
Source, which isn’t. But that’s a part of the component, that’s a part of the 
equation. It used to be that the plan for a lot of startups was to get bought 
by GYM: Google, Yahoo, Microsoft. Well, that doesn’t seem to be happening as 
much anymore. Does Microsoft still look at startups as sort of their—not to 
be nasty about it—but as sort of their outsourced R&D?
Don: I don’t know if I’d put it that way, but we certainly look at startups as 
a source of innovation and disruptive ideas and leading-edge technology, for 
sure. Microsoft has acquired on average about 20 companies a year, and we 
have been acquiring 20 companies a year for the past five years. Yahoo and 
Google to a lesser extent, but they acquire 10 to 15 companies a year too. 
But, put them all together, Google, Yahoo, and Microsoft are acquiring 
maybe 50 companies a year. So, it never was . . . If you are putting all your 
eggs in that basket, it’s a small basket.
Bob: It is a really small basket.
Don: Yeah. Well, about 5,000 startups start every year. So, out of those 5,000, 
if 50 of them are going to be acquired by Google, Yahoo, or Microsoft, that 
is pretty slim odds. So, I wouldn’t be starting a company in order to flip it to 
one of the big guys. It happens, but I certainly wouldn’t have that as my sole 
exit opportunity.
Bob: Well, it used to be the exit opportunity of choice was the IPO, and 
that sort of went out of style around March 2000 when the dot-com boom 
turned into a bust. And then it was the idea of, well, let’s get acquired by 
GYM or other people. But GYM was always the crown jewels of acquisition. 
So, what is the early exit, or is there an early exit? You may start up a company, 
but you may plan to be there for a while.

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
21
Don: Well, the reality is that M&A has been the exit opportunity of choice 
for the past five years and that there have been thousands of companies 
acquired over the past five years. But they are acquired by some of the lesser-
known names, still very good exits and good business. So, you need to look 
beyond just the high-profile acquisitions that you read about in TechCrunch 
or other places. There are lots of great business opportunities with smaller 
companies and acquisitions in that space. But I think, coupled with the idea 
that it takes a lot less money to start a company today, that also means that 
your exits can be much smaller and still be very, very lucrative. So, in the old 
days, when it cost $30 million or $50 million to start a company, you needed 
an exit of $300 million to $500 million for the VCs to make their money and 
the startup founders to make their money.
But, if today you are starting a company and you can bootstrap it and maybe 
bring in a few friends and family for couple hundred thousand dollars, if you 
have an exit for couple million dollars or $10 million, that’s a tremendous 
exit. You are making really good money. So, it doesn’t have to be a huge 
acquisition by one of the big guys to be a successful story.
Bob: So, it costs less to start and looks a lot less like winning the lottery?
Don: Right.
Bob: Okay.
Don: And I think, again, the point is start a company for as little money as 
possible, bootstrap it if you can, get to revenue as quickly as possible, get to 
cash flow break-even. And as Paul Graham says, once you are on a cash flow 
breakeven basis, you have infinite runway, infinite amounts of money because 
you can go forever. You don’t need to worry about raising the next round of 
cash because you are cash flow positive. And from there, you can just grow 
organically and grow as your cash flow allows and grow a very nice business. 
And at some point, it might make sense to sell it, but you have options, because 
you are cash flow positive.
Bob: That makes sense.
Don: I think that is the key. Get your product or service on the market as 
quickly as possible, start collecting revenue as quickly as possible, keep your 
expenses low, and get the cash flow breakeven, and then you are home free.
Bob: Let’s turn for a second to the private equity world and, if you can, put 
on your—or get in front of your crystal ball here for a bit. What do you think 
is happening, because I keep noticing this term micro-VC popping up. That is 
part 1. And part 2, what are these people looking for, given that we are in a 
global recession?
Don: Well, that’s a big question, lots of things going on there. The first thing 
I’d say is that most venture capitalists are funding the companies that they 
already have. So, they are reserving more money to put into their existing 
investments, whereas when they made their initial investment, they thought 
that they would only have to put in maybe two times their initial investment 
and then be out of it in five to seven years.

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
22
Now they are thinking, they are going to have to put in three or four times 
their initial investment and going to have to carry the company for seven to 
ten years. So, they are focused on making sure that their existing investments 
have enough capital and enough runway to make it. That’s their first priority.
Bob: Okay.
Don: And then if there is money left over, then they are looking at new 
ideas, but the bar for investing in new ideas is pretty high. They aren’t making 
investments in the marginal ideas anymore; it is just the really, really good ones.
Bob: Let’s turn back to Microsoft for a second. You mentioned that one of 
the things you do is you connect VCs and angel investors to startups that 
you work with. Why do you do that? I mean, it seems counterintuitive that 
you would find funding for other software companies.
Don: No, our goal is to encourage startups to build their applications on the 
Microsoft platforms, on Windows or SQL Server or SharePoint or Dynamics or 
Office or any of the many platforms that we have. Because we know that the 
value of our products, our platforms, is enhanced by the number of companies 
building applications on top of them. So, that is job 1. It is to help startups and 
companies build great applications on top of our platforms. So, we do a 
variety of things. We have partner programs and consulting programs and all 
kinds of things to help startups build their applications.
Bob: Which we will be covering in the book in detail. When you say as job 
1, that doesn’t leave much room for equivocation. Does Microsoft really 
want a whole lot of startups competing with it?
Don: Well, we don’t view it as competition. Microsoft is a platform company, 
Windows is a platform, SQL Server, SharePoint, Office, Dynamics, all these 
platforms. And Microsoft, by and large, doesn’t get into building end user 
applications, with rare exceptions. So, we view startups that are building 
applications as partners who are helping to add value to our platform. So we 
don’t view them as competitors; we view them as partners. And we want as 
many of them as possible. So, that’s job 1. Get partners using our develop-
ment tools and our platforms to build their applications, and then provide 
programs for them to help them do that. Now, the other side of it and the 
side where I spend a lot of my time is with venture capitalists and angels. 
And you might ask, well, why do we do that?
Bob: OK. Why do you do that?
Don: Well, because they are the source, the funding source for all these 
great startups. And I get out there and see as many of them as I can. But the 
fact is there are hundreds and hundreds of venture capitalists and angel 
investors out there who are seeing more startups than I am. So, I want to 
help them in any way I can and open a dialog with them, so that they tell me 
about the great startups that they are seeing and that might be adding value 
to Microsoft. So then I can switch into business development mode, go see 
those startups and help them out, form partnerships and help them in any 
way we can. 

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
23
So, it is a symbiotic relationship between Microsoft and the VCs. They tell 
us about the great companies that they have. They tell us about companies 
they think we ought to acquire. Microsoft acquires some of those companies, 
but we also are out there seeing great startups that are looking for funding. 
And VCs want to know about those, so we will tell the VCs about some 
startups that we have seen that are doing interesting things, that we like a 
lot, and refer them to them for funding. So, it works both ways.
Bob: This sounds an awful lot like hard work rather than marketing hype to 
me. And I just want to say that everything I have seen in the years that I have 
known you as we have gone through a couple of books and podcasts and few 
other things, I keep saying over and over again that Microsoft is absolutely 
serious about helping startups succeed. And they really would like to do it 
on their platform, which is understandable from where they are coming 
from. But that is not the only criterion that seems to be in play. It comes 
down to the more startups, the more the industry as a whole succeeds.
Don: Absolutely. Yeah, we are serious about this. When you look at Dan 
Levin’s emerging business team, they are about a dozen of us and all of us 
came from startups. So, we are startup people. That’s our nature. We love 
to work with startups and help them. And it is just important to Microsoft 
to have as many startups as possible out there, pushing the envelope, doing 
disruptive things. We also work with startups, by the way, that compete with us 
and that are doing really disruptive, innovative things, because we need to 
pay attention to those sorts of trends and innovations and make sure that 
we know what is going on, what is going to be hot and make sure that we 
are able to work with them. So, it is a full-time job and we are serious about 
it. And it is not a six-months program or a year program; we are in it for the 
long term.
Recap
As we’ve discussed in this chapter, startups have been around for a good 
40 years. But while what worked for people in the last century may kind 
of work today, the underlying economic realities are different. We will be 
digging into these fundamental differences in detail throughout this 
book, but let me preview for you the five I think are most important.
■Startup costs to get to your first sale are now often self-fundable.
■The roles and strategies of equity funding sources have evolved, and 
you need to know what door to knock on if your startup requires 
major capital.

  Introduction: What Was Is Not What Is
24
■Social media are rewriting the “We push, you listen” marketing 
contract. The new rules are to be remarkable, to talk with, not at,

Value Is the Core 
of Your Startup

Value and Problems, Problems 
and Value
If any chapter in this book is more important than any other for creating 
a successful startup, this is it. Much of this book deals with getting your 
startup where you want to go; this chapter is about deciding what your 
software will do to get you there.
In this chapter we focus on what your startup is going to be about and 
on how to decide what value your startup delivers to your customers so 
that they will give you money, attention, and support.
Beginning at the Beginning 
Is Just a Beginning
Ask most people in this industry how to decide what your startup should 
build, and more than likely you’ll get some variation on “Find a problem 
people will pay to have solved and solve it.”
I asked one of the more intelligent, thoughtful, and experienced people 
I know in the business, Microsoft’s Don Dodge (whom we met in Chapter 1), 
where to find a really great idea. He replied, “I like to say, is your product a

vitamin or a painkiller? Vitamins are nice to have, but pain killers, you got 
to have it, right? So, the nice-to-haves in bad times, the nice-to-haves just 
don’t cut it, because people aren’t going to spend time or money on things 
that are nice to have. They are going to focus on real pain points and just 
spend time and money on things that solve a problem that they have.”
“There is another set of ideas that don’t really solve a problem at all, 
and they are not a vitamin or a pain killer—they are more like a happy pill.”
Happy pills? What’s that got to do with startups?
Don replied, “Happy pills are things like YouTube or Facebook—they 
don’t solve any particular problem, they just make you feel good. Or 
games, online gaming, that kind of stuff—it doesn’t solve a problem, it is 
just fun and entertaining. One of them is solve a pain point and bring a 
service that solves that pain. Another is bring services that save money, 
that can save time or money.
“A third way is what I broadly call entertainment—things that make 
you feel good, social networks, games, online gaming, dating; online dating 
is probably one of the biggest businesses on the Web that is legal, other 
than porn or gambling. So, there are huge opportunities in those areas. 
You just have to do something that’s unique and different, easier, faster, 
cheaper, something.”
Now, these are good answers—and they beat the answer to build a 
startup like the one you read about this morning in TechCrunch. But they 
are just the beginning of getting a clear view of this stuff. “Solve a prob-
lem” doesn’t tell you how big or small that problem should be (AIDS in 
Africa vs. a code library that makes it easy to interface with PayPal from 
Rails). It doesn’t tell you what kinds of problems make sense for you to 
tackle, and it doesn’t give you a theory that let’s you reasonably say, If I 
want to do this, I’ll need to do this and this to succeed. And it does nothing 
to help you define the value that will be the core of your startup.
Value? Value is one of those words with multiple meanings. In this 
context, we’re talking mostly an economic definition: the market worth of 
a commodity, service, asset, or work. Put another way, it’s what makes an 
Apple iPod worth more than a Microsoft Zune, why you’ll pay dearly to live 
in one location rather than another, and why investors will fund and peo-
ple will buy what your startup is providing.
But before we get into how to how this value thing works, we need to 
take a slight detour to see how a theory might simplify the job of finding 
a startup idea. What we need is a highly concrete example, something as 
solid as a rock, of how a theory can make a huge difference in what results 
you and your startup will achieve. And for that we need to talk to Wally.

Wally’s Startup Law
Wally Wallington is a retired carpenter in Lapeer, Michigan, with 35 years’ 
experience building things. Wally is also a guy who, using nothing more 
than wooden tools, figured out how to move a 1-ton concrete block by 
himself, then a wooden barn, and then 2- and 10-ton concrete blocks into 
a replica of Stonehenge (Figure 2-1)—by himself, without wheels, rollers, 
ropes, hoist, or power equipment or anyone else’s manual labor.
Figure 2-1. Superman? Nope. That’s Wally.1
How the hell does a single man move a 10-ton concrete block? He 
starts by knowing a few laws of physics, and he thinks about it for a bit. 
“The simple laws of physics are most helpful in moving large objects, iner-
tia creates stability, momentum keeps things working, and kinetic energy 
slows things down so they can be controlled. By creating conditions, using 
some engineering skills, and math for weight and balance,” said Wally.
NOTE There is nothing more practical than a good theory. Infor-
mation is good; information that gives you a handle on some 
aspect of how the future is going to play out is much, much better. 
Regardless of what kind of startup you’re building, knowing certain theo-
ries that have some empirical evidence going for them, such as Chris 
Anderson’s The Long Tail, Alvin Toffler’s Third Wave, and the cluetrain 
manifesto is a Good Thing.

  Value Is the Core of Your Startup
28
In honor of Wally, over the next few pages we’re going to talk about 
a way of thinking about what value your startup is going to bring to the 
table—not because Wally’s a startup (he’s not) or because building startups 
obeys the laws of physics at the macro level (it doesn’t). But there’s a set 
of rules that make sense at play here. What’s more, understanding those 
rules and relationships is going to give you a big head start to applying 
them to your startup, instead of cargo-culting what others do.2
Let’s start with the components of this Startup Law, the first one 
being the problem (Figure 2-2).
Figure 2-2. Start with a problem.
The Problem
To state the obvious, here are a few things we know about problems.
■They have attributes: these can be anywhere from simple to mind 
numbingly complex, as large as climate change to as small as getting 
the drop shadow right on an image in a blog.
■They have duration: a problem can be as old as history (meeting 
a mate) to as new as last week (protecting Twitter accounts from 
being hacked).
2 In programmer circles, cargo-culting means using code libraries and projects when you haven’t a clue 
as to how they actually work, although they do. “Famous examples of cargo-cult activity include the 
setting up of mock airstrips, airports, offices, and dining rooms as well as the fetishization and attempted 
construction of Western goods, such as radios made of coconuts and straw”—from Wikipedia.
the Problem

  Value Is the Core of Your Startup
29
■For some people—maybe everybody, maybe Japanese teenagers, 
maybe one guy who happens to be in charge of a piece of machinery 
that makes a specific kind of auto upholstery that goes into the side 
door panels of Mini Coopers—this thing is a thorn in their side, a 
rock in their show, an itch that needs scratching.
Hang in there, this is where it starts to get interesting, mainly how 
your startup is going to make money.
Your Startup’s Value
How much your software can solve that problem, fix it, improve it, lessen 
it, or make it go away defines the value of your startup (Figure 2-3). 
Whether the problem is that personal financial record keeping is a pain 
(Mint.com) or that you can’t manage time if you don’t log it (RescueTime.
com), to name a couple of examples from Chapter 7, to the degree these 
startups solve the problem, they create value, and that creates at least 
the opportunity to generate revenue.
Figure 2-3. Your startup’s value
All too often, developers will solve a technical problem so obscure 
that few people really care about it (see the later sidebar “Ten Startup 
Ideas Not to Do, and Why”). Those problems just don’t have enough 
potential customers to make them significant as the basis for a startup.
It’s all about moving that problem. Fine. But how do you solve that 
problem? That’s where the next part of our theory comes in.

Your Resources
You solve a problem with resources (Figure 2-4). For startups, that means 
everything from you and your other founders’ technical expertise, to the 
money people invest in your company, to your knowledge and understanding 
of the problem, to the marketing you do to find and connect to the people 
who care about this particular problem. These are the building blocks of 
your software solution to the problem, that thing you’re going to build so 
that people want to pay you to make the problem go away or at least to 
get smaller.
Figure 2-4. Resources solve the problem.
Connecting your resources to the problem takes time—maybe a 
weekend coding marathon, maybe seven months building a prototype so 
that you can get enough resources to really tackle the problem, maybe 
years and years if you work on your startup in your nonjob time, an hour 
here, a half-day there.
But resources are only half of what it’s going to take to move that 
problem and create something of value. Let’s now introduce the last piece 
of this particular puzzle.
Your Fulcrum
Just as with Wally’s 10-ton concrete blocks, you need a fulcrum to make 
things happen for your startup (Figure 2-5). Joel Spolsky calls it the 
secret sauce. It’s that surprising, remarkable, innovative “something” 
the Problem
Your resources
time
the Your
Startup’s
Value

  Value Is the Core of Your Startup
31
that differentiates your product from all of the other solutions to a given 
problem. Here are a few kinds of the components that build a good fulcrum.
Figure 2-5. Archimedes was right.
■Disruptive technology. The problem? Not enough servers—be it to 
run a growing online business or to host a thousand such businesses. 
Servers and their cost were a big problem for startups and others 
back during the dot-com era. Then along comes virtualization, the 
rules change, and the problem is, if not solved, then taken down a 
few notches.
■Originality/creativity/innovation. Call it what you will, it’s the 
spark of genius that makes the difference between a solution that 
solves the problem the same old, tired way and one that changes 
what people thought was the solution to the problem.
■Deeper understanding of the problem. Just about every programmer 
can code a basic content management system (CMS). But do you 
understand your intended market—be it a vertical market such as 
car repair garages, solo-practice podiatrists, or sports-mad soccer 
fans—so well, so deeply that you know exactly what that market 
wants and yearns for?

■Design. The world is full of ugly software. I know because I’ve written 
my share of it. Awkward workflows, unpleasant screens, and the like 
can be overlooked when there’s no other choice for getting the job 
done; your app could be that choice. This goes deeper than attrac-
tive web design—it gets into building an app that works better to 
solve a given problem than its competitors.
■Disruptive business model. Sometimes the innovation isn’t in the 
software; it’s in the infrastructure around the product. For Apple, 
the secret sauce wasn’t the MP3 player; it was the free iTunes app 
and being able to browse and buy music easily online for a reason-
able price, song by song. For Mint.com (see Chapter 7), the secret 
sauce was the idea of getting credit card companies and the like to 
pay for your online personal finance program.
■Combining unlikely things. Take the accelerometer from your 
car’s airbag system and add it to your game console, and you have 
the Nintendo Wii and a runaway success. Take the power of an online 
application and combine it with the brevity of a Short Message 
Service (SMS) message and you have Twitter. As the world gets 
more complicated, surprising, and sometimes wildly successful, 
solutions can be created by combining unlikely things.
■A new platform. As we saw with the Apple iPhone and then Google 
Android, new platforms create leverage for relatively old ideas. We’ll 
have a lot more to say about this in Chapter 3.
There’s one more element of Wally’s Startup Law: the lever. In the 
preceding figures, I labeled it time: the time it takes to build a product, to 
find and connect and build a market, the time before others come up with 
their own take on the problem.
It can also be thought of as how long you as the founder are prepared 
to make slow and steady progress, how long your angels/VCs are prepared 
to fund you before cutting off your oxygen, how long before the problem 
changes, becomes irrelevant, or dwindles in importance.
Wally’s Startup Law is not a real law: don’t look for a bevy of neat 
equations or well-designed algorithms here. What the last few pages do is 
give you a reasonable theory to explain and predict how this particular 

  Value Is the Core of Your Startup
33
dynamic works and therefore some idea of how things work for actual 
startups.
Implications of Wally’s Startup Law
Let’s look at a few of the implications of this theory we’ve just slogged 
through, especially how those implications work in reality and constrain 
or liberate your startup.
■Big problems need lots of resources; not so much small problems. If 
you’re going to move a big problem, such as letting people talk to 
each other via the Internet (VoIP), you are going to need resources, 
and lots of them. Consider Skype: founded by Niklas Zennström and 
Janus Friis using the proceeds from selling the peer-to-peer file-sharing 
network KaZaA, it went through another $37.4 million of VC money 
as it grew from a few thousand users to a whopping 405 million user 
accounts as of Q4 2008.3 Oh, and along the way (September 2005), 
Niklas and Janus sold Skype to eBay for $2.6 billion.
■Niklas and Janus started with a very large resource base of money in 
the bank and the fulcrum of extremely deep knowledge of how to 
build a peer-to-peer Internet transmission network. Given this nearly 
unique starting point, they could tackle a huge problem experi-
enced by hundreds of millions of people all over the world.
■The bigger, smarter, and better your fulcrum of ideas, the fewer 
resources you will need to move the problem you are tackling. Take 
the case of RescueTime, which we look at in depth in Chapter 7. 
Tony Wright and his two cofounders created a large and powerful 
fulcrum for their time management startup by realizing, even before 
the software was built, that the information RescueTime collected 
for its users and aggregated anonymously provided jaw-dropping 
surprises, surprises that got RescueTime press (TechCrunch, New 
York Times, BBC, BusinessWeek, etc.) other companies would happily 
kill for. RescueTime started as a self-funded startup, soon got $20,000 
as seed money from Y Combinator, and, in September 2008, got 
$900,000 in Series A funding.

■You need a fulcrum. Without some sort of fulcrum advantage—a 
deep understanding of the problem you are trying to solve, a remark-
able approach to the problem, a disruptive technical advantage, or 
all three—it’s going to be hard to move the problem and create value, 
regardless of how much time, effort, and money is committed to the 
other end of the lever. This antipattern (see the later sidebar “Ten 
Startups Not to Do, and Why”) has been repeated time and time 
again, most recently with online video, white-box social networks, 
and micro-blogging platforms. In each of these cases the first startup 
in that space (YouTube, Ning, or Twitter) had a huge fulcrum 
comprising new social needs and disruptive functionality relative to 
what existed up to that point. Their competitors, when compared 
to these “first movers,” don’t enjoy the same kind of leverage or 
customer base.
■The more specific the problem, the fewer resources are needed to 
move it. Consider 37Signals. Begun as a Chicago-based web design 
shop, its first web app grew out of a need for just enough online project 
management to get the job done. That product—Basecamp—in turn 
became a giant fulcrum as the part-time contractor hired to work 
up Basecamp extracted as an Open Source project an elegant and 
robust framework (Ruby on Rails) that has become a major founda-
tion for web application development.
Wally’s Checklist for Your Startup Idea
One good use of a theory such as Wally’s Startup Law is to see how what 
you want to do measures up. Here’s a short checklist of questions to help 
you evaluate ideas around which to build your startup.
1.
Is the problem too big for the resources you can apply to it? If so, 
how are you going to change the equation to be more in your favor? 
Reduce the scope of the problem? Improve your fulcrum of unique/
disruptive/innovative ideas and insights into the problem? Get 
more resources—more time, more partners, more funding?
2.
Is the problem too small, given the resources and insights you 
have? Sometimes you can overkill a small problem while leaving 
it’s larger (and more profitable) relative in the wild.
3.
Is your fulcrum large enough to move the problem and thereby 
create real value? This is another way of asking if your idea is 
remarkable enough to gain the attention you want. Or will bloggers, 

  Value Is the Core of Your Startup
35
investors, and, ultimately, customers find it wanting? Better to 
have this heart-to-heart meeting with yourself or your partners 
than to face it after putting 5,000 hours of work into it.
4.
What components do you have, what are you missing to make 
this proposition work, and how will you secure what you need? 
For some startups, it’s nailing down just how you and your partners 
are going to commit to the time needed to build 1.0; for others it’s 
where to find someone who can sell your enterprise software to For-
tune 500–size companies. Given what the problem is, who has it? 
And how do they decide what to buy? Do you have what you need, 
or can you get it?
5.
Is there going to be enough value in this startup to get the 
resources you’ll need? If you’re going to need equity funding to 
get this idea off the ground, is there enough value to enough cus-
tomers to give your angel investors 3 to 10 times their money back 
in, say, three years, and return 10-to-the-sky’s-the-limit return on 
investment for VCs? The money guys are going to want real evidence 
here. Do you have it?
6.
Is the lever going to work? Here’s a subtle gotcha: You’re all fired 
up to build a startup to take advantages of and sell to the users of 
a brand new platform. So you find funding and spend 18 hours a 
day in hand-to-hand combat with that new platform, only to emerge 
with your beta to discover that the million-unit first-year estimate 
cheerfully predicted by the platform vendor is looking like 30,000, 
most of those returns. Oops! And before you say it could never 
happen to you, I must tell you that it happened to me when Apple 
brought out the incredibly cool, hip, sleek . . . Apple Newton.
Sometimes it pays to look before you leap onto the latest and greatest 
platform.
This is a starter list of questions. Use it to grill—like the popular BBC 
show The Dragon’s Den4—your prospective ideas before they get your 
time and money, let alone anyone one else’s.
4  http://www.bbc.co.uk/dragonsden/—In addition to the UK show, there are now versions of 
the show in Afghanistan, Australia, Canada, Finland, Israel, Japan, the Middle East, the Netherlands, 
New Zealand, Nigeria, and Russia and shows pending in Ireland, Sweden, and the United States (see 
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragons%27_Den). I guess startups are getting pretty popular!

Have a Great Startup Idea? Hmm. Maybe Not.
Paul Tyma is a writer, speaker and serial entrepreneur in the software 
industry. He is a founder of Preemptive Solutions, Inc., a software security 
firm, and is currently founder/CTO of Home-Account, Inc., a web-based 
system out to rethink the mortgage industry. As the saying goes, he’s been 
there, done that and has the tee shirts to prove it. His advice presented here 
is reprinted with his kind permission from his blog Technical Revenue at 
http://paultyma.blogspot.com.
Over the years I’ve started a small handful of Internet/software projects/
companies. Examples include Mailinator, Preemptive Solutions, Inc., and 
Classhat. Actually, I’ve started a large handful but no one knows about most 
of them because they were (in no particular order): dumb ideas, unsuccessful, 
too hard for me to complete. Given that I now rate any new idea I get according 
to a set of rules that helps me filter out good ideas from bad. At least, what-
ever I consider bad. Keep in mind these rules are for the canonical one- or 
two-person pre-startup—if you have 8 million in VC, there’s a lot of other 
magic you can do.
Here they are:
1. If there is no business model, its a hobby, not an idea. I love 
compiler optimizations. I wrote a Java optimizer soon after Java came 
out. I spent months trying to figure out how to turn it into a business. 
But guess what, people don’t pay for optimizers, or compilers, or even 
runtimes. At least not without a strong sales team telling they need 
that. By and large most ideas I get are about things that I’d love to work 
on but have no real business model (my Classhat project took several 
years and is, absolutely, a hobby). There’s nothing wrong with hobbies, 
as long as you know what they are.
2. The best ideas make your customers money. If your idea can say, 
“If a customer uses our product, they will make X% more money” (where 
X is a positive number, even if quite small),” you have won the game. 
Importantly—I did not say the customer will save X% more money. I 
said they’ll make it. That’s a big difference. Saving money is great, but 
you are then faced with the mission of convincing your customer that 
if they spend $100k on your product now, it will pay itself back in 8 
months. It’s way, way, way easier to say, “Use our product and you make 
2% more money (of which we get a cut). Don’t use it, and don’t.” Who 
wouldn’t buy that?

  Value Is the Core of Your Startup
37
3. The best place to be that I know of is B2B2C. That is, you want 
to be a business that serves businesses that serve consumers. If you’re 
B2C, then welcome to some important challenges. One is to get people to 
pay for your stuff, which in this Internet world, we’re not all that happy 
about doing. Secondly, welcome to support hell. Its very hard to provide 
consumer support (and you see many complaints across the net). It 
takes a lot of support people and a lot of money to do it right, which is 
why it rarely is. If your idea plans to charge consumers, I’d definitely 
think twice unless you can ramp up a support system fast. Thirdly, you’ll 
need a powerful infrastructure (apart from support) just to handle 
large numbers of small transactions. Its harder to sell 1,000 $10 widgets 
than 10 $1,000 ones.
On the other hand, if you’re simply B2B, life isn’t so bad. Big ticket sales 
but encompassing the market is harder. Sales cycles are long. Again, you 
might need a faster ramp-up of a sales and marketing infrastructure 
(which you are going to need eventually anyway), but you’re probably 
okay if the idea is generally good.
4. If you’re going B2C, look for revenue models that don’t come 
right from the consumer. Given the last point you’re probably thinking 
I’m crazy, given things like YouTube or MySpace or Facebook or Google. 
I’m not (at least I don’t think I am). All those places dodged the problems 
of providing support and tracking sales by giving away their services for 
free and making money on the backside (whatever that is). Often that’s 
advertising revenue. Often its partnership deals. Simply put there abso-
lutely is an Eyeball Business Model. If you can get the eyeballs, you can 
sell them. Just try to do that instead of charging them directly. They’ll 
be ornery about it and demand support.
5. Revisit every bad idea every once in a while. Why is AJAX hot? 
Because its enabling things technically that weren’t enabled before. Are 
any of these mash-ups really novel ideas? Not usually. Old ideas become 
new again by new technology, faster computers, etc.
When the computer game Doom came out, it included very little novel 
technology. All the 3D math and graphics tech had existed for years. 
The guys at ID were just the first ones to realize that personal computers 
(as opposed to graphics workstations) at the time had finally gotten 
powerful enough to do it all in real time.
Every time bandwidth gets faster or cheaper, previously bad old ideas 
become new and shiny (e.g., video over the Internet). Mobile phones 
seem really ripe. Apps and usability currently sort of sucks. That’s really 
hampering a ton of uses. With every new advancement, however, it’s 
going to open up new doors.

6. Do your best to create a system of recurring revenue. Adver-
tising on web sites and such is easy. But things like packaged software is 
hard. Why does Microsoft change the doc format every time it releases 
a new Microsoft Word. Surely it probably includes new features, but 
why can’t old versions just ignore those and load the file (which is really 
text, right?) anyway? Because they don’t want it to. They want you to 
buy a new version of Word to get all the new features (even if you just 
write letters to your Aunt Edna and would never use them). They want 
recurring revenue.
Doing that with packaged software is harder and often somewhat 
transparently greedy. Heard of “software as a service”? That is of 
course, really, “software that we can just keep charging for.” Bottom 
line is if tires, light bulbs, or razors never wore out, the economics 
of those businesses would be radically different. Getting more money 
from your customers (hopefully while providing value to justify it) is a 
good way to go.
If have an idea that follows #2 above (making your customer money), 
do your best to simply take a small cut. Small cuts add up and the cus-
tomer has no risk in trying your product.
7. Let ideas gestate. Every new idea seems to be the greatest idea I 
ever had. Usually it goes something like:
Time 0: get new idea
1 minute later: (some details)
2 minutes later: start thinking about suit I’ll wear when I get to ring 
closing bell when we IPO
After getting way too excited about way too many ideas, I set myself 
a rule. Think through an idea for three days before I tell a soul. My 
excitement is usually killing me the first day or so, but by the third day 
it’s rather died down. Or, if it isn’t, I get a better sense of whether I’m 
really onto something. Simply put, ideas always look better the fresher 
they are. You’re looking for ones that look good even when not fresh.
8. Consider the size of your market. If you read Guy Kawasaki’s blog 
you’ll see him mention quite often how new companies pitch to him 
about the immense size of their new market. Guy often chides them 
for their optimism, but even he knows you better believe you do have 
a big market (and maybe even puff the number in conversations) or you 
can forget it. Numbers in the hundreds of millions or billions are good—
you’re really only realistically hoping to glean a smidgen of that.

  Value Is the Core of Your Startup

Consumer markets can be drastically immense. If you’re one guy in 
your basement with an idea that will capture you a $40 billion market, 
that’s dandy. Hopefully you have no misconceptions that you’ll just own 
the market yourself (where there’s money, there’s competitors, and 
they’ll steal plenty, if not most of it, before you can penetrate it all); but 
the bigger the market, the easier it is to find customers.
Niche markets like hardware stores, developers, and/or mailmen don’t 
suck—so long as you can effectively penetrate most of it—and fast. 
Simple rule: bigger is better. If big enough (and your idea does actually 
penetrate it), you’ll capture the attention of someone big who will want 
it for themselves. That either means buying you or chasing you—where 
the actual outcome happens in the execution (not the idea).
9. “Building a business around a new developer tool” is wrong 
on so many levels. Some markets are not only niche—they live in the 
land of the free. And I don’t mean the USA—I mean a market where 
people are used to getting everything for free.
The software developer inside me keeps coming up with ideas for 
software development tools. Occupational hazard, I suppose. I under-
stand the domain space and understand how to solve the problem. 
However, development tools are, in general, a really bad place to find 
good business ideas. Consider that things like Netbeans and Eclipse 
that took thousands of person-hours to create are given away FREE. 
Therein lies the rub: developers have created their own culture of 
giving away tools for free. There is certainly nothing wrong with that, 
unless of course you think you’re going to make a business out of it.
Even then there are niches inside dev tools that are worse than others. 
Two dollars and an idea for the greatest Java software dev tool ever will 
buy you a cup of coffee. Java developers are especially used to getting 
tools for free. In contrast, Microsoft has created a nice culture of 
getting .NET and windows developers used to paying for stuff. In other 
words, if you “must” create a developer tool that you intend to sell, 
stick with Microsoft or some other market segment where paying is an 
accepted idea.
10. Ideas really aren’t worth all you think they are. Yes, I know 
you’re smart. Yes, you’re amazingly, super-duper wonderfully creative. 
But in reality, very few ideas are truly novel.
What happens is that two independent technology evolutions (say, the 
Internet and mobile phones) eventually progress to a point where it 
takes a simple idea to act as a bridge and converge the two. And a 
product is born. The farther ahead you see that convergence, the more 
“brilliant” your idea is.

40
But with every passing day, the distance between the two technologies 
lessens and your brilliant idea becomes ever so slightly more obvious. 
In other words, if someone else hasn’t thought of it, they will soon. And 
as more people realize it, the odds of it hitting someone who’s looking 
to start a company increase.
Basically, the winner will be the company that gets things to market fast, 
creates a marketing and sales infrastructure, and actually makes sales. 
Don’t rely solely on an idea to make it all the way. It has to be supported. 
If it isn’t—at a minimum—it will be stolen (at least in a market sense). 
You can definitely create a world-class company on a good idea and a 
great infrastructure. Vice versa is nowhere near as easy.
And, as an aside, once the technology progressions converge by them-
selves (apart from your idea)—your idea will probably be made irrelevant 
(hopefully you cashed out long before then).
11. Competition is good. If you don’t have competition, you don’t have 
an idea. Competition tells you and investors that your idea isn’t wacky. 
If you work three years on a product with no challengers, maybe they 
know something about the day you’re going to release and try to make 
sales that you don’t.
Don’t be afraid to chase an existing idea if you have what you consider 
a subidea that makes a key difference. Both AltaVista and Google did 
search. AltaVista was doing it long before Google started and probably 
laughed when they heard some challenger Google was going to take 
them on. I hate to say it but the concept of “stealing ideas” in business 
is very hard to define. Patents tried to enforce this notion, but it’s so 
broken (although you still need them of course) that it hardly matters.
Every idea you have is already an extension of some existing idea. (Every 
web 2.0 idea “assumes” the Internet “exists.” Every “mash-up” not only 
assumes, but steals functionality from two or more existing web ser-
vices.) How close your new idea is to old ideas defines how many people 
will say you stole it. And there will always be people saying that.
As a concrete example: I created Mailinator in July 2003. It was the first 
disposable e-mail service that allowed incoming e-mails to create an 
inbox as they arrived. There are now a half-dozen copycat sites (some 
even stole my FAQ questions and license!). Does this matter? Could I 
do anything about it if it did? Should I try to squash them?
A better tactic is simply to outmarket them and introduce new fea-
tures. Protecting an idea is nearly impossible; working to continually 
better serve your customers isn’t. (And, by the way, the idea for Maili-
nator wasn’t mine. It was Jack’s.)

Where Do You Find Problems?
For most developers interested in building a startup around solving a 
given problem, that problem is very near at hand. When I talked to Tony 
Wright, the founder of RescueTime, the problem came from his and his 
cofounder’s frustration with how the time management problem had been 
solved up until then.
“It was born out of our personal inability to understand how we spend 
our time,” Tony said. “Every day we had a scrum agile meeting. We’re a 
bunch of software geeks. Everyone’s job was to say what they’d accomplished 
in the last 24 hours and what they were going to do in the next 24. We 
found that people’s ability to articulate what they’d done, literally, just in 
the last work day, was terrible. People would say, well, I felt busy but I can’t 
really articulate what I did.
“We wanted to understand that, but we recognize that despite all 
these time management books that say keep a log of how you spend your 
time, that’s incredibly impractical for a technology worker who’s shifting 
between applications and web sites, sometimes in 10-, 20- second blocks. 
We want something that was totally passive that would answer those ques-
tions for us and for our business without actually requiring data entry, 
which is no fun.”
For two of the four founders of Brisworks (a client of mine)—which 
makes and sells Admin Arsenal, a Windows system administration tool—
the problem was the frustrations they were experiencing as system admin-
istrators: “After years of seeing the bleeding, we decided to make the 
bandage. Upshot: We know from firsthand experience what sysadmins 
need,” said Shawn Anderson. “We knew how expensive and overly complex 
most systems management solutions were. We saw a market for a simple, 
yet powerful solution,” added Shane Corellain.
“I’m more evidence that the best products come from simple need,” 
said Corey Maass. “My main product, dubfiler.com, is still in development, 
but has received a lot of good attention from the right people. Meaning 
the people I made it for—other producers, DJs, and musicians. We all 
share files constantly, but were tired of file-sharing sites. I said, ‘Why not 
make the perfect one?’.”
Sometimes you can spot the problem just by looking at an existing 
situation from a different point of view. “I was outside having a smoke 
break, looked into the offices at the computer screens displaying the 
default Windows logo screensaver, and thought, ‘You’d think they’d have 
their own logo on there,’” added Steve Grundell, whose Any Logo Screen-
saver Creator at http://www.anylogoscreensaver.com brings in a tidy profit 
each and every quarter.

42
Often, defining the problem comes from doing something for some-
one not so technically orientated and thinking there’s got to be a better/
easier/cheaper way for nonprogrammers to do this. “I got the idea last 
year [for his startup, http://www.artists-portfolio-creator.com—see Figure 2-6] 
after years of helping my mum (who is an artist) make presentation CDs 
for when she wanted to make gallery submissions,” Stephen Fewer told me.
“I have been self-employed in an unrelated area of computers for 
nearly two years and have always wanted to run a microISV and hopefully 
get another revenue stream coming in, so I had a ‘light bulb moment’ one 
day that their was a gap in the market and I could write a great piece of 
software to do what I had been manually hacking together previously. I 
thought if I could make it easy to use with great features, every artist who 
exhibits could want it :).

The idea for your startup might walk up to you at your day job, as it 
did for Simon Shutter. “The idea originated when I was hired by an engi-
neering consulting company to review commercial calendar/scheduling 
software. The basic requirement was to be able to see at a glance the cal-
endars of several team members six weeks to two months into the future. 
They liked how they could view multiple calendars in Outlook but didn’t 
like how information in Outlook disappeared into the calendar grid when 
more than a few calendars were displayed.
“At the end of the contract I gave them my opinions on a range of 
commercial products and also presented a concept that was more in line 
with their requirements. They liked the concept the most and so I turned 
it into a microISV app (Schemax Calendar, at http://calendar.schemax.com/
default.aspx).
Or you might get your startup idea when you realize you’re not the 
only person facing a problem. “That was four years ago, while filling out 
my state taxes online. Realized that even a pro couldn’t make a web form 
right,” said Cedric Savarese about his startup, FormAssembly (http://
formassembly.com).
“I find that to have good ideas I need to be working on some problem,” 
said Y Combinator founder Paul Graham in a 2005 blog post. “You can’t 
start with randomness. You have to start with a problem, then let your 
mind wander just far enough for new ideas to form.” Paul is a very smart 
guy who’s put a great deal of thought, time, and energy into what it takes 
for a startup to succeed.
Ten Startups Not to Do, and Why
Just as there are trusted patterns of software design, such as Model-View-
Controller, that have proven themselves to work over time, there are anti-
patterns of startup design that time after time disappointed would-be founders, 
angels, and investors. Now, if your startup fits into one of these antipatterns, 
maybe you’re the exception that’s going to break the rule; but you’d better 
know why you’re the exception. Hope is not a plan.
■The Me-Too! startup. Twitter client startups are being written up 
in TechCrunch and elsewhere as their founders get funding, go to great 
parties, and start eyeing expensive cars. Therefore, we will do a Twitter 
client. For Twitter client, substitute “social media web app,” “crowd-
sourced video site,” “enterprise CMS,” “semantic web,” “iPhone ad 
network,” and so forth. Nothing wrong with these kinds of apps, but 
code monkey-see, code monkey-do works for most primates and 
some VCs—it’s a lousy way to pick a business to be in for the next 
three to five years at least, if you succeed.

  Value Is the Core of Your Startup
44
■The Designed-by-Committee startup. It’s easy to spot this kind of 
startup: it’s got the latest hot social media, crowd-sourced, Long Tail 
features for the early adopters and training wheel wizards for the late 
adopters. It’s the triumph of configuration options because the designers 
didn’t want to say no to anything or anyone. In short, it’s an app—web, 
desktop, mobile—that tries too hard to be all things to all people.
■The Port startup. This is most often seen among desktop startups, 
but it’s also fashionable among iPhone startups. The formula is simple: 
pick a program on one platform that’s successful (it may be your 
company’s or another’s) and port it to a different platform—Mac to 
Windows, Windows to Mac, whatever. Do the port in such a way as 
completely to ignore the sensibilities and expectations of the market 
you are porting to. This is how web apps that mimic, say, Microsoft 
PowerPoint (except they’re slower) come into being.
■The PR-First startup. Every so often a startup bursts on the scene, 
trumpeted by amazing claims that should have the giants in the industry 
quaking in their shoes. Well, no. Some startups are able to generate 
publicity in far greater amounts than their apps warrant. Sometimes 
it’s the “Microsoft Outlook Killer” Chandler Project5 (six years in the 
making, no big deal) (Figure 2-7) and the “Google Killer” Cuil 6 (“Anybody 
who thought [Cuil] was this Google killer can really see now that, no, 
that’s not going to happen today—and the likelihood is that’s not going 
to happen a year from now,” says Danny Sullivan, Internet search guru 
and editor-in-chief of SearchEngineLand).
■The Outsourced startup. This is a startup that outsources not just 
the functions secondary to its core product, such as accounting, PR, 
and tech support, but then outsources the core development and coding 
of their application because either that’s what large corporations do 
or that’s what Angel Investor X or VC guy Z says they’d better do if 
they want funding. First off, while developers and development shops 
in India, eastern Europe, and elsewhere can code every bit as well as 
programmers in the United States and Europe, they (except the ones 
busy launching startups) are set up to implement code, have not come 
up with the vision in your head. Second, if they can somehow turn 
your hand-waving mockup into a real application, why do the money 
guys need you?

■The By-the-Bootstraps startup. Try this experiment: Put on a pair 
of boots and find a stairway heading up. At the foot of the stairs grab 
the back of each boot with a hand; then in that position, jump to the 
first step. If you make it, jump to the next step, still holding your 
bootstraps. It can be done, but it’s very hard, awkward, and prone to 
failure. Bootstrapping—building a startup while working full time—can be 
done: that’s how I built StartupToDo.com7 and how many others have 
built their startups. But it ranks on the Pain scale somewhere between 
getting a tooth pulled and getting your fingernails pulled off one by one.
■The Only-a-Genius-Could-Love-It startup. Take one incredibly 
smart computer science/Zen philosophy graduate who rattles off a 
dozen world-shaking ideas when asked if she wants milk in her coffee 
and go let her play. When you come back, your partner has created a 
software app of incredible complexity using algorithms and logic you 
need to study for three months just to understand how to print. One 
successful example of this is Stephen Wolfram’s Mathematica compu-
tational software program, which is incredibly powerful and robust 
but appeals to a very, very small market.
7 That’s why I built StartupToDo.com too—traditional bootstrapping was too damn hard!

  Value Is the Core of Your Startup
46
■The Only-a-Few-Programmers-Need-It startup. You’re a pro-
grammer with an itch to scratch and a keen desire to make some serious 
money. So you code up a library, a component, a control, a framework. 
While there are successful companies doing just that (Infragistics comes 
to mind), you first have to compete with all the Open Source projects 
doing the same thing and then find enough developers to squeeze out 
a living better than a day job.
■The Built-to-Flip startup. This is a variation of the Me-Too! startup, 
but with a twist. You see that startup X just got acquired by Big 
Company Y, so you reverse-engineer their app and, more importantly, 
their marketing and come out with acquisition bait for Big Company 
Y’s rivals. While there’s nothing wrong with looking for an early exit 
(see Chapter 5 for a translation from VC-speak), building a company 
with that as its sole goal seldom works, for three reasons: There are 
too many startups trying to win that lottery. For example, Microsoft 
acquires about 20 companies a year. And that’s it. Second, if your 
market of companies that might buy you out is exactly one, you’re at 
their mercy—and they will know it. Finally, during recessions, M & A 
activity slows way down as big companies hunker down.
■The We-Can-Do-it-Better-Than-Microsoft startup. Or Google 
or Adobe or whatever large software company you yearn to be better 
than. Specifically, in this antipattern you bring out a word processor, 
spreadsheet, or graphics editing program just as good as and maybe 
a bit better than the Big Guy on their native platform. Assuming you 
get funding (you won’t), you’re going to be locked in a cage with an 
enraged elephant who is going to outspend, outhire, outmarket, out-PR 
you to a very early death. That’s not to say that Microsoft or any other 
company is anointed to always win, but that’s the way to bet. This is 
not the same as finding a way to build a horizontal app tailored to a 
different platform that delivers things that Microsoft can’t or won’t 
(Zoho.com comes to mind) or as building an app that appeals to a 
sliver of the horizontal market, like, say, Scrivener on the Mac (http://
www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.html).
The bottom line for these antipatterns is that they share one overwhelm-
ingly bad commonality: they’re unremarkable. And that’s the kiss of death in 
the Online World.
Recap
There are as many different ideas behind startups as there are stars in the 
sky. But after looking at, reading about, and talking to several hundred 
startups, I see some commonalities emerging.

  Value Is the Core of Your Startup
47
■Most startups don’t go looking for the idea that will (supposedly) 
make them the most money; they go looking for a solution to a 
problem they care passionately about.
■A problem is a starting point, not an end-all. How you see the problem, 
what technical, business and human insights you bring to how to 
state the problem, and your solution make the difference between a 
ho-hum me-too startup and one that can gather attention, funding, 
and customers.
■Resources cost; ideas multiply the effectiveness of resources. Program-
ming takes time, funding costs equity, and marketing takes money. 
How effective these resources will be depend in large part on what I 
call the fulcrum: the approach you take to solving the problem. The 
bigger and more robust that fulcrum can be constructed using the 
sheer brain sweat of your startup’s founders in order to understand 
the problem more fully, to see new ways of solving it, and to under-
stand how the problem is affecting people today, not five or ten 
years ago, the better.
There’s no shortage of problems or things people would want to do if 
they only could, and there’s no magic or secret formula that will work for 
all startups everywhere. But there is a natural relationship between the 
size and shape of a problem you want to solve or an opportunity you want 
to seize, the resources you can ante up, and how you’re going to see, solve, 
and connect to the problem that when done right can create exciting and 
profitable value no matter the size of the problem or the resources you 
have to start with.
Next we’re going to turn to a major development that’s changed dra-
matically how startups succeed from the days when commercial apps ran 
on either PCs or Macs: the rise of the platforms. Web apps, hybrids, Facebook 
apps, SaaS platforms, mobile, and more: Which platform is your startup 
going to call home?

So Many Platforms, 
So Many Options
“Life is the sum of all your choices.”
—Albert Camus (French writer and philosopher)
“Choose your rut carefully; you’ll be in it for the next ten miles.”
—Road sign in upstate New York
Then and Now
It used to be so simple, in the age of Bill and Steve.1 If you wanted to 
develop and sell software, you had a choice of two platforms: Windows 
and Mac. Sure, game developers could write for a given console, or you 
could write an app for a minicomputer such as the IBM AS400, but those 
were the exceptions. Starting with the IBM XT in March 1983 and the Apple 
Macintosh 128k seven months later, if you wanted to write commercial 
desktop software, they and their successors and offspring were the only 
game in town.
How things have changed. Now if you get together with a bunch of 
startups at, say, a Startup 2 Startup event (see Chapter 4), you start by 
talking to a founder working on a micropayment system for Facebook and 
then to a VP for a startup doing cross-platform virtual desktops that fol-
low you from workplace to home like an obedient puppy, and then two 
developers—a Rails guy and .NET/Silverlight guy—will join in. And, of 
course, at least three Apple iPhone developers are within 20 feet of your 
little group.
Today, one of the most important decisions a startup’s founder or 
founders have to make is what platform—or combination of platforms—will

be the world in which they live and, hopefully, sell. Make the right deci-
sion, and funding, attention, and revenue will flow your way; make the 
wrong decision, and you’re left with an app no one wants.
This chapter will introduce you to the buffet of platform choices you 
have as a startup, how you decide what platforms are right for you, and 
understanding the trade-offs and opportunities each provides. Along the 
way we’ll talk with several startups about their choice of platform, what 
they like and dislike about their chosen platform, and their advice to the 
new person on the block: you.
But first, what’s a platform?
Everybody Wants to Be in the 
Platform Business
Here is the short answer to the question of what a platform is: A platform 
is anything on which you can write and sell a software app that will make 
money for you—and for whoever owns the platform. The long answer is 
considerably more complicated, since it’s the story of the messy, some-
times-contradictory, always heady mix of marketing hyperbole and 
genuine breakthroughs of our industry.2
To bring some sanity to this buffet of platforms, I’ve grouped them 
into six categories: SaaS, PaaS, social, mobile, desktop, and hybrid.
■SaaS (pronounced “sass”). This is software as a service, such as an 
app written in ASP.NET, Rails, PHP, or the like, that you run from your 
server and either charge customers to use or monetize via adver-
tising or some other means. Think Web 2.0 and you’re thinking SaaS.
■PaaS (pronounced “pass”). Platform as a service is a different beast: 
you’ve written a web app, but it plays in someone else’s sandbox/
online ecology. What come to mind are Force.com (from SalesForce), 
the Apple iPhone,3 Google AppEngine, Bungee Connect, various 
CMS apps, such as Joomla, and Microsoft SharePoint, among others. 
So do enterprise-level PaaS’s such as NetSuite, Oracle OPN, and 
others. And so too do Amazon’s almost-a-PaaS weave of Web Services, 
Google’s not-quite-an-operating system of tools and services, and 
Microsoft’s we-finally-have-cloud operating system Azure.
2 Yes, our software industry—welcome to your new position!
3 Why do I count iPhone apps as on a PaaS? Because, except for the tiny sliver of jail-broken iPhones, 
if you want to do a commercial iPhone app, you’re going to be paying Apple 30% of your revenue.

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
51
■Social. Social networks such as Facebook, Twitter, MySpace, Bebo, 
Hi5, Orkut, and SecondLife are platforms, but their structure, 
economics, and opportunities set them apart from SaaS and PaaS.
■Mobile. This gets its own category, for the simple reason that it’s 
exploded as a platform: Apple iPhone,4 Google’s Android platform 
(gPhones), RIM BlackBerry, and Windows smartphones, to name 
the major and minor players.
■Hybrid. It’s not a web app, because you launch it from your desktop; 
it’s not a desktop app, because it uses the net and runs on PCs, Mac, 
and Linux boxes; it’s something different. Adobe Flex/AIR and 
Microsoft Silverlight are the two major platforms battling for the 
hearts, minds, and codebases of startups here.
■Open Source CMS. Open Source doesn’t necessarily mean you 
should leave your credit card behind, as major Open Source projects 
such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal demonstrate.
■Desktop. They may not get the respect, press, or funding they once 
did, but desktop apps created by startups for Windows and Macs are 
still very much a part of the platform mix.
There you have it: our roundup of all the usual suspects. Before we 
interrogate them, let’s have a look at our questions for them.
NOTE  Not making a decision is a decision. Now, you may be 
saying to yourself, “I’m an X developer; of course my startup is 
going to build software using X.” That might be true. But picking the 
default without at least understanding what’s going on in those other 
platform worlds is like changing lanes without looking: a bad idea. And 
spending a little time with those other platforms might spark the Killer 
Secret Sauce Idea for your startup.
Evaluating platforms: A checklist
As we get familiar with most of the platforms out there for building a startup, 
here’s a set of questions you and your other founders might find useful in 
selecting which platform(s) and languages to build on.
4 Yes, the iPhone counts twice—once as a PaaS, again under mobile—because entirely different apps 
now make sense on a GPS-enabled, motion-sensitive handheld communication device, and startups are 
jumping into this pool. This has absolutely nothing to do with the iPhone glued to my body, honest.

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
52
1. Appropriateness to your targeted market. That’s right; it’s not 
which language you prefer to program in. What matters here is what 
your targeted market (see Chapter 4) prefers. Consider Mint.com: a 
SaaS aimed at people in their 20s and 30s. Founder Aaron Patzer could 
have written a hybrid, PaaS, mobile, or even desktop app, but instead 
he chose a platform that allowed him to reach the maximum number 
of his targeted market segment.
2. Your (team’s) skill set. Obviously, the skills, languages, and platforms 
you already know and use will heavily influence your platform choice—
but there’s a couple of catches here, which we will come to next. For 
now, preparing yourself and your team for this critical decision includes 
doing a skills inventory—nothing too complex, just who knows what 
and how well, and how long ago they wrote code in each particular 
platform and language.
3. Is the Platform/language evolving, mature, or declining? Keep 
in mind that hooking up with a platform is anything but a one-night 
stand—you will need to support, evolve, and innovate your startup’s 
app for two to five years, given most post-startup scenarios. Where do 
you think the platform will be in that timeframe? Also, if your platform 
is closed source rather than Open Source, you have to factor in as best 
you can what the owners of your platform want. For example, more 
than a few companies in the 1990s brought to market software apps 
based on the Apple HyperCard program, only to see development stall 
and ultimately be abandoned by Apple in 2000 and finally withdrawn 
from the market in 2004. Over in Bill’s world, both Active Server Page 
(ASP) and Visual Basic 6 were left for dead as Microsoft moved to its 
.NET lineup.
4. What’s the health of the ecosystem around the platform/
language? Programmers are a somewhat fickle lot: What’s hot today 
may be crap tomorrow. The larger and more robust the community of 
Open Source projects, freelancers for hire, commercial vendors, book 
authors, blogs, forums, and IRC channels, the better it is for your startup.
5. Is your platform consistent with your post-startup strategy? 
You don’t tug on Superman’s cape, and you don’t sell Ruby on Rails 
startups to Microsoft. Are you hoping for a major player in your industry 
to buy you out? You’d better not develop a .NET app if your three 
potential suitors all are Open Source to the core. Startups are a beginning, 
not an end onto themselves. If your post-startup strategy is all about 
being acquired, you’d better know how compatible your platform is 
with what those other companies are committed to.

6. Love the Platform, love the language, or don’t go there. Most 
professional programmers can write code in a number of languages for 
a set of platforms. That’s good and fine, but if you don’t have a serious 
emotional relationship with your platform to be, you and your team 
will not enjoy spending untold hours, not just coding in and for it, but 
tracking and learning new developments, techniques, “best practices,” 
and all the rest.
If the foregoing list causes you to slow down and not jump quite as quickly 
on the platform and language you had hardly thought about because they were 
the obvious, immediate choice for you—good. Picking a platform is serious 
stuff. It is the most upstream technology choice you will make for your startup 
over much of your life for the next several years. A little consideration 
applied here could make or break your startup.
Software As a Service
Overview
Start with rounded corners, add a black background and warm, fuzzy 
text, and label it Web 2.0. That’s what SaaS is, right? Not exactly. There’s 
a great confabulation of meaning and usage when you pack the terms 
Web 2.0, SaaS, and apps in the sky.
Part of this is historical—we’ve been down this road before and the 
ending wasn’t very happy. Remember Application Service Provider (ASP) 
startups? Those were the brave and brash Internet pioneers during the 
dot-com boom that absorbed billions in VC money before people started 
to notice that it’s a wee bit hard doing computing in the cloud using dialup 
modems. Let’s call software that uses the net anything but ASP.
Before we get to the distinguishing markings of an SaaS app, let’s 
examine two huge differences between the world then and the world now 
as far as startups are concerned. First off, the battle of broadband vs. 
dialup is well and truly over, and we have won. Consider the statistics from 
UK-based research firm Point Topic, Ltd., shown in Figure 3-1.
The stats compiled by Point Topic show dialup fading away and broad-
band becoming ubiquitous, worldwide. This might sound like old news, 
but it’s anything but when you’re building a SaaS startup.
I think the second major development that has contributed to the 
phenomenal growth of SaaS-SMRMs (software as a service startups making 

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
54
real money) is that there’s a whole new generation of e-commerce companies 
geared toward the subscription model. We will be covering several of them 
in detail in Chapter 5, but for now the point is that these e-commerce 
companies further reduce the cost of entry for SaaS startups, and that, 
too, is a good thing.
Figure 3-1. Broadband penetration, by country5
Main Characteristics from a Startup’s Point of View
Legally, you’re not licensing an application; you’re providing a service. This 
puts you in a parallel legal universe from the EULA-centric platforms.
Technically, it’s all about servers (actual, virtual, or elastic), the joys 
of cross-browser HTML/CSS/JavaScript compatibility, and performance. 
In terms of money, subscription-revenue models predominate, especially 
for business-related SaaS apps, with small startups eking out a living via 
Google AdSense, and a few out-of-the-box-thinking startups such as Mint.
com that are tapping noncustomer revenue streams.

Advantages
If you’ve ever sold a desktop app or worked for a company that did, then 
you know that breaking free of the torture wheel of software piracy, soft-
ware installers, endless updates, and configuration issues is a beautiful 
thing. A humble example: Fully 50% of the time I spent supporting my 
first commercial Windows desktop application revolved around operating 
system configuration issues, with another 30% devoted to providing new 
registration keys to users.
Breaking free of the confines of desktop software reality means that a 
huge percentage of your startup’s resources can go into the actual service. It 
also means that you’re out of the tawdry game of forever hounding your 
customers to buy upgrade after upgrade.
Disadvantages
Like every other platform in this chapter, there are trade-offs when basing 
your startup on the SaaS model. First and foremost are the performance 
and functionality constraints to which an application chained to a web 
browser must be reconciled. These constraints, which some would argue 
are a good thing and lead to software elegance and simplicity, are still 
constraints. Bottom line: web apps fall short of the speed, functional 
power, and sheer complexity of which an app running on the desktop is 
capable.
Here’s the next thing that gives SaaS founders sleepless nights: what 
the Web giveth, the Web taketh away. Even the arguably most robust SaaS 
application on the net—Google Gmail—falls down with some regularity 
and goes boom.6 Your mileage will probably be worse. From denial-of-ser-
vice attacks to marauding backhoes, let alone good old developer/
sysadmin errors: all of these can make your startup blink out of existence.
Here’s another issue: you’re one subscription period away from ruin. 
If some other startup’s SaaS app wins the hearts, minds, and attention of 
early adopters, trade press, bloggers, and your customer base, your revenue 
can crater overnight. Brand loyalty is so 20th century, and attempting to

There’s no denying that SaaS is an attractive platform for startups: near-
zero cost of entry thanks to server virtualization combined with the sheer 
power to reach the global market for your application directly is a power-
ful combination.
Saas enterprise reality check: Rick Chapman, Softletter
While consumer-facing SaaS is booming, one nagging question keeps 
businesses—especially enterprise—SaaS startups—awake at night: Will 
they buy? Are large organizations, government agencies, and the like 
prepared to cede control of their mission-critical line of business applica-
tions to some third party that they don’t own and that might—probably 
will!—be working for their competitors? After years of focusing on ways to 
protect corporate data and integrate all enterprise data into data marts, will 
IT departments let their companies adopt SaaS apps?
Everyone has an opinion, but one man has the data. Rick Chapman 
is the managing editor of Softletter (http://www.softletter.com), a twice-
a-month subscription-based newsletter for software developers and publishers. 
Softletter tracks new marketing and distribution tactics, company operations, 
finance, pricing models, product management, and emerging technologies in 
the desktop, enterprise, Open Source, and software as a service (SAAS) 
market segments.
Rick was kind enough to share a few insights on the SaaS world, gleaned 
from his wide-ranging industry surveys, special reports, and seminars. Hope-
fully, Rick’s answers will let a few more SaaS startups reading this book sleep 
a little better tonight—or get hopping! Thanks, Rick!
Bob: Rick, what’s the overall acceptance rate of SaaS software in the various 
market segments you track (small, midsize, enterprise, public)?
Rick: SaaS acceptance is very high in all of these markets. One of the inter-
esting things our research showed us in 20077 was that adoption of SaaS at 
the “enterprise” level was higher than conventional wisdom’s assumptions. 
Then, the median size of a sale for an on premise/client server product was 
$50k; for SaaS, it was $25k, much higher than the $10k to $15k we’d projected. 
7 The 2009 Softletter SaaS Report came out just as I was wrapping this chapter (http://www.
softletter.com/pages/SaaS_report.shtml). The trends Rick describes here continue.

57
That higher number came from corporations buying enough seats to push 
that median to that level. We’re currently running that survey as I write this 
and we think that SaaS median will show continued growth.
Bob: Are these rates plateauing, growing, or shrinking?
Rick: Rapidly growing. While the economy is in a recession, SaaS isn’t. In the 
B2C markets, there are no segments and niches in which SaaS alternatives 
to traditional software are not appearing.
Bob: Is SaaS penetration into small groups within organizations here and 
there, or is it enterprise-wide?
Rick: Within corporations, the scope and type of penetration differs based 
on what you’re selling. Most SaaS applications are not broad horizontals such 
as word processing or spreadsheets. Everyone uses a word processor and 
many people use a spreadsheet.
However, how many people within a company need to use a sales incentive 
and compensation management product? Or a CRM system? Or a document 
manager? Or a marketing automation system? Or a SaaS-based litigation 
support system?
SaaS is much more of a “sell and grow” proposition. In a larger company, the 
typical scenario is that a division or operating unit will test the product (this 
happens rapidly because, in most cases, a test project can be implemented 
without much or any IT involvement). If the group is happy, they sign up, and 
the SaaS system begins to spread through the company as the word gets out. 
However, we are seeing a growing number of cases where the SaaS vendor 
convinces a company to purchase the new system for all units that need it.
Bob: Is there a “sweet spot” in pricing SaaS apps to each of these markets, 
or do they range in price?
Rick: Our 2009 Softletter SaaS Report sliced and diced this question up in 
several different ways.
First, we asked respondents what their primary means of pricing their 
product was. Here are the numbers:
■Concurrent seats (up to X number of users can access the system at 
any one time): 17%
■Named users (only registered individuals can use the system): 29%
■Per transaction or based on usage (for example, a library management 
system that charges based on the number of library books tracked 
and managed): 29%
■Projects: 6%
■Bandwidth used: 1%

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
58
■Storage: 0%
■Other: 18% (when analyzed, most of the others were variants of the 
top three)
When you break named users down by pricing segments, here’s what you get:
■$1 to $25 per month: 39%
■ $26 to $50 per month: 12%
■$51 to $75 per month: 10%
■$76 to $100 per month: 17%
■$101 to $250 per month: 7%
■$251 to $500 per month: 7%
■$501+ per month: 5%
■Other, please specify: 2%
As you can see, there is a pricing range. But if you aggregate the numbers, 
you also see 41% of the respondents are pricing between $26 and $100 per 
month. Of course, competition and the market in which you compete will 
also drive pricing.
One thing we strongly recommend SaaS companies do is look closely at the 
per-transaction model, as this often allows you to align your pricing with a 
customer’s own business processes. I also strongly suggest they purchase 
our SaaS report because, as you can see, we’ve captured a lot of the numbers 
and data points a SaaS company needs to research when building their business.
Bob: What are the top three concerns companies have when dealing with a 
SaaS app? Do these concerns differ by market segment?
Rick: The top three concerns are data security and privacy, data integration, 
and the SaaS vendor’s viability. Privacy/security concern becomes of increasing 
importance as the revenue size of your customers increases and is also deter-
mined by type of company. Financial services firms and banks are particularly 
sensitive to this issue. Don’t even attempt to sell any serious SaaS application 
to, say, Wells Fargo unless you’re SAS 70 certified. JP Morgan will not allow 
their data to be comingled with anyone’s.
One of the weaknesses of SaaS is that it naturally creates data silos; this is 
one of the siren calls of the platform players. Many SaaS firms need to be 
prepared to handle developing web-based services and deploying them to 
facilitate integration.

Vendor viability is tricky in SaaS. With licensed products, if a vendor dies, the 
code doesn’t. And code escrow arrangements have been around for decades in 
the software business. But when a SaaS vendor face-plants, an entire envi-
ronment dies with them. Code escrow is not necessarily of much use. In the 
2009 report, we asked companies if they were offering complete fall-over 
protection; in other words, a third party will maintain and provision the SaaS 
system in the event the SaaS vendor goes out of business. A surprisingly high 
21% of respondents said yes.
Bob: Are companies more likely to be comfortable with a PaaS offering 
from, say, Force.com than standalone SaaS or not?
Rick: We asked SaaS companies if they were developing to platforms such 
as Force in 2007 and 2008. Year to year, only about 13% were doing so. The 
platform developers have a lot of work to do in terms of convincing SaaS 
companies to put their eggs into any particular platform basket.
From the standpoint of IT purchasers, we don’t see huge concerns over 
platform support. Obviously, companies such as Salesforce.com would 
like to change this, but none can claim to be the next Microsoft (yet).
The death of Coghead8 highlights the PaaS and viability issues.
Bob: What do you see from the data you’ve been collecting as the trend for 
SaaS and PaaS?
Rick: SaaS is exploding; PaaS is not. SaaS companies are worried about vendor 
lock-in, vendors going away and leaving them without an underlying infra-
structure, and competition from the platform providers. In 2007 I wrote in 
an article in Softletter that the platform wars of the ’90s, which saw Windows 
triumph over OS/2 and Novell, were breaking out again as platform providers 
fought for SaaS dominance. And don’t forget Microsoft; the .Net Nuke platform 
(CMS) is a fascinating example of how Microsoft technology can be adapted 
to create a compelling SaaS system.
Platform As a Service
Overview
Why not have all the advantages of SaaS without all those nasty head-
aches? That’s the pitch to startups of a growing legion of both large and 
small software companies providing a core of services but who want other 
companies to move in.

At least three different species of PaaS vendors are wooing startups 
out there.
■GYMAZ. This stands for Google, Yahoo, Microsoft, Apple, and Amazon. 
Each, for its own reasons, revenue model, company history, corpo-
rate culture, and internal politics, offers one or more platforms as a 
service. Among the most prominent as of this writing were Amazon 
Web Services, Google App Engine (see the upcoming sidebar “Loving 
Google App Engine”), and the Apple iTunes Store/iPhone/iTouch 
infrastructure.
■Multitenant applications. They provide the plumbing and, some-
times, the customer base for your startup. Salesforce.com’s Force.
com is the most visible of this kind of PaaS (see Figure 3-2), with 
other startups, such as AppJet and Heroku, hoping to make it big.

■Social platforms. Facebook in particular provides PaaS features.

Main Characteristics from a Startup’s Point of View
The good news is you don’t have to get into the scaling business; the bad 
news is you have a landlord—who may be kind, benevolent, and helpful, 
but a landlord nevertheless.
One thing about landlords—they want their rent. Whether it’s Apple’s 
30% off the top of each and every iPhone app sold or the arrangements 
Salesforce.com has with it’s 800+ third-party apps at Force.com’s 
AppExchange or Google App Engine’s billing quota model, you are going 
to be paying that landlord each and every month.
Advantages
First and foremost, PaaS vendors are in the business of removing the startup 
heartbreak of scaling from your startup’s life.
Next, PaaS vendors drastically reduce or altogether eliminate up-
front infrastructure costs. It’s a pay-as-you-make-money proposition, and 
that changes everything from how hard it is to launch a startup that takes 
advantage of one or more PaaS vendors to how much of your startup you’ll 
actually still own in, say, three years.
Disadvantages
There’s a certain suspension of disbelief issue here. What if one fine day 
Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos decides this whole Web Services thing just isn’t 
cutting it? Or Apple decides it really wants 40% of your revenue, not 30%? 
Or what if you’ve tied your fate to a PaaS that just doesn’t make it, such 
as Coghead (see the earlier sidebar “SaaS Enterprise Reality Check”)?
Comments
The bottom line for many startups is the more PaaS, the better. Whether 
it means you don’t need $40 million for a server farm of your very own, or 
it’s the opportunity to sell to customers who want more from the primary 
vendor and you’re in the right place at the right time, PaaS makes sense.
What doesn’t make sense is treating a PaaS like a safe given; it’s not. 
The startups that gain the most—and weather the worst—that PaaS plat-
forms have to offer are the startups prepared to invest significant time, 
effort, and attention building as many human connections with the engi-
neers, marketing people, and executives who run the show.

Loving Google App Engine
Dave Westwood is a cofounder of BuddyPoke (see Figure 3-3), a 3D avatar-
poking app available on a variety OpenSocial networking sites,9 and to say 
he’s head over heels in love with Google App Engine is an understatement. 
Dave made this YouTube video (Buddypoke on Google App Engine) and bent 
my ear when I met him at one of Dave McCure’s Startup 2 Startup dinners 
(see Chapter 4).
Figure 3-3. BuddyPoke

Networks as Platforms.”

When I asked David via e-mail about Google App Engine, here’s what he had 
to say.
Reasons we love App Engine:
1. Scaling that “just works.” Many other web services provide a means to 
scale, but do not handle all of the scaling for you. With App Engine it 
just works, allowing us to concentrate on innovation and features for 
BuddyPoke, rather than the problems of scaling, backing up databases, etc.
2. Scaling quickly. OpenSocial, the iPhone, Android devices, Facebook, etc., 
give developers access to over 800 million users around the world. 
These days, more so than in the past, if an app goes viral, traffic can 
increase by orders of magnitude beyond what you may have hoped for. 
On one day BuddyPoke experienced an eightfold increase in traffic, 
doing 260k new users in a single day. There’s simply no way we could 
have planned for that kind of rapid growth. With App Engine we didn’t 
have to.
3. Quality and global reach of Google’s infrastructure. Ninety-five percent of 
BuddyPoke users live outside of the United States. Google, more than 
any other company, has created an infrastructure that can deliver apps 
to users on a global scale, with minimal latency.
4. Pay-as-we-go model. Many social apps never take off. Many have instant 
overnight success and then fade away. Others have slower growth but 
manage to sustain a high active user count. It’s difficult to predict usage 
for any social apps. So the pay-as-you-go model is perfect for us.
5. Cost-effective. We have a very good idea of what our hosting on App 
Engine will cost us, and it’s very fairly priced. The way I think about it 
is I just hired some of the most talented engineers in the world for 
free, and now I’m just paying them for the bandwidth and CPU usage.
A few years back one of the most popular phrases any startup would say is 
“We’ve solved scalability!” Quite frankly it’s a problem we don’t want to 
have to solve. We’re two guys with a background in 3D. The last thing we 
want to learn is how to scale. We’re in the business of making social apps. 
We’re happy to let Google take care of the scaling for us.
Google has been incredibly helpful in making sure we had enough App Engine 
quota to grow while App Engine was still in preview. And I’ve met many engi-
neers from the Google OpenSocial and App Engine teams at local meetups, 
hackathons, etc. Google is really reaching out to developers even more so 
than in the past, with new developer relations groups, opening up their code 
labs, etc. They’re trying to make themselves accessible for support and help 
developers succeed. For example, we just had a “weekend apps” hackathon 

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
64
at Google two weekends ago. Google hosted the event and had some hands-on 
expertise from the OpenSocial and App Engine teams. So we did receive 
firsthand support, but I think that support is also available to anyone that asks.
I asked Dave my standard “Any advice for startups?” question: “I think my 
response is much like any other startup before us,” Dave replied. “Just never 
give up. We released a product in 2007 and it was a failure. We learned from 
our mistakes, adapted, and tried again. Most entrepreneurs that have succeeded 
have looked failure in the eye at least once. Learn from it.”
Microsoft’s Azure Services and Mesh Platforms
For years, as Google and Amazon defined what cloud platform meant for 
developers, Microsoft’s critics and developers wondered whether the 
desktop giant could in effect compete with itself. After all, it was the dynamic 
duo of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office preinstalled by OEM PC 
vendors that led to the Age of Bill. Could Microsoft offer developers who 
had forsaken the desktop an alternative to itself?
The short answer is yes—if someone is going to unseat Windows as the 
platform of choice for developers, it was going to be Microsoft, no matter 
how much the cash cow side of the business bellowed.
To get an understanding of just what Microsoft cloud platform is offering 
developers, I turned to my partner in podcasting, Patrick Foley (Figure 3-4). 
Pat is a Microsoft ISV evangelist based in Michigan. His job is to convince 
people like you that the Microsoft stack is where you should place your 
startup bet and then to help startups and what Microsoft calls ISVs (independent 
software vendors) get everything they need from the company.
Figure 3-4. Microsoft ISV evangelist Patrick Foley

65
Although Pat bleeds Microsoft red, as the saying goes, he’s not a marketing 
suit. He’s a former startup founder, an accomplished developer, and a guy 
who tells it like it is and won’t blow marketing hype in your ear.
I asked Pat to give us the lowdown on Azure and Mesh and Microsoft’s 
vision of a cloud platform for startups.
Bob: So what does Microsoft Azure and Microsoft Mesh offer startups 
looking for a platform on which to build?
Patrick: Cloud computing in general is a game-changer for startups. It 
allows startups to compete with large, established software companies 
without having to invest in hosting infrastructure.
The magic ingredient is scalability. You can always buy a server and host 
it with a reliable provider, but what happens when you need to handle an 
enormous amount of peak traffic, perhaps for a one-day event that’s three 
weeks away or perhaps in response to the viral success of your application? 
Before the cloud, you’d have to create your own infrastructure to handle 
this peak load, so startups had to either invest heavily or limit themselves to 
solving problems that didn’t require much scale.
Now with the concept of the cloud, or “utility computing,” you can provi-
sion just the capabilities you need for only as long as you need them. The 
capacity that you can provision is enormous and nearly instantaneous. This 
allows for new business models and technical approaches that simply weren’t 
possible before.
For an example, see BrowserMob [http://browsermob.com]; it uses a 
“brute force” approach to load testing by firing up thousands of browsers on 
thousands of VMs [virtual machines]. They have one full-time employee and 
are cash-flow positive and profitable. Their approach wasn’t possible before 
the cloud.
What Windows Azure brings to this space is a consistent development experi-
ence for .NET developers. If you know how to program for the Windows client 
or ASP.NET, it’s going to be pretty seamless to program for Windows Azure. 
That’s a huge advantage. The same high-productivity development experi-
ence works with Windows Azure, traditional Windows Server, Windows 
client, ASP.NET, AJAX, Silverlight, Windows Mobile, embedded, and more.
So now you can focus on building assets that can be hosted in the cloud on 
Windows Azure or on-premise with Windows Server and get a significant 
amount of overlap between the two platforms. According to Steven Martin, 
Senior Director for Developer Platform Product Management, “The innova-
tion in Azure and future versions of Windows Server will be shared, and that 
codebase will continue to cross-pollinate. The corporate data center at some 
point in time will look like a minicloud, partitioned by application workload.”

(http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=
viewArticleBasic&articleId=9129156&intsrc=news_ts_head).
So the reach of our platforms and the choice this provides software compa-
nies and their customers are key benefits of Windows Azure and Mesh. 
Startups need high productivity, reliability, reach, and value—that’s what 
they’re going to get with all of our offerings.
Bob: How do Azure and Mesh compare to the other “in the cloud” platforms 
out there, like AWS and Google App Engine?
Patrick: I was happy to see Ray Ozzie tip his hat to Amazon Web Services 
when Azure was announced. Amazon has a solid production offering, and 
they are currently the leader in the space. Since they now offer Windows 
hosting, they also provide a viable option for Windows developers looking 
to create a solution in the cloud. That said, Azure has some intriguing advan-
tages—to understand them, we have to look at a broader view first.
There are two basic approaches to cloud computing, the virtual machine 
model and the sandbox model. Amazon uses the virtual machine model with 
their EC2 offering. Google and Microsoft are more focused on the sandbox 
model.
There are trade-offs to each approach. The advantage of the virtual machine 
model is that it is familiar to developers and you can generally get legacy 
applications to work on it. The advantage of the sandbox model is that it 
hides even more of the complexity of scaling from the developer and provides 
greater economies of scale for the cloud provider.
In the virtual machine model, the deployable “component” is a virtual machine, 
typically a stateless web stack. It has to be stateless in order to enable the 
scaling magic—if you want to fire up 100 virtual machines interacting to 
solve a problem, they can’t each be responsible for their own state; Amazon 
provides various ways of dealing with that, but developers have to under-
stand scalable system partitioning and be disciplined if they want their apps 
to scale.
By contrast, with Google App Engine [GAE] the deployable component is a 
chunk of Python code, and with Windows Azure it’s a .NET assembly. These 
are much more granular components, and they consume far fewer resources 
than virtual machines when they aren’t being heavily used. That chunk of 
Python or .NET code can’t just be allowed to do anything, though—it has to 
be “sandboxed” to prevent the developer from seeing the underlying cloud 
infrastructure. You don’t get to write straight to the file system, for example; 
instead, you have to use storage services.
There is one enormous advantage to the sandbox model for startups—
a lower entry price point. Running virtual machines consumes precious 
resources, and cloud providers have to charge for them. So it’s going to cost 

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
67
you around $75–$100/month to get started with the minimum infrastruc-
ture needed to host a simple web application 24/7 on Amazon’s EC2, compared 
to $10/month or less for commodity shared hosting. That means a startup 
or MicroISV who is trying to scrape by on a shoestring would have to make 
a choice between betting on a true cloud infrastructure and investing 5–10 
times more per month and starting with commodity hosting and switching 
to AWS once “successful.”
Pricing for Windows Azure hasn’t been announced yet, but Google’s has . . . 
and it’s extremely compelling for startups. Google offers a “free until you’re 
successful” pricing model, and the only reason they can is because of the 
sandbox model. If you love the way Google apps work and you happen to be 
a Python fan, then GAE is obviously a compelling option to consider.
Again, Azure’s pricing hasn’t been announced yet (and I am in fact not privy 
to it), but my hope is that it will allow startups and microISVs to start with 
a true cloud infrastructure at the outset and grow seamlessly as they succeed. 
And because it’s the same great development experience they’re already 
used to, it’s a slam-dunk for .NET developers.
Mesh is in a category all its own. The point of mesh is to allow developers to 
create user experiences that bring together all your devices, from Windows 
and Mac PCs to mobile phones to browsers. It’s still quite early in its evolu-
tion, but the bits that are out there today are already remarkably useful.
I use Mesh to store my most important documents so that they automatically 
sync to each of the PCs I use and so that I can get to them from a browser 
when I need to. I use it to automatically sync shared documents with coworkers 
and family. It works great for this. But the true potential is as an application 
delivery platform—the coolest example is delivering a Silverlight application 
where the application and its data automatically sync across your devices. 
This makes for an incredibly rich implementation of the occasionally connected 
scenario.
It’s worth noting that Mesh is implemented on Windows Azure . . . it 
demonstrates the kind of innovation that can be delivered on Windows 
Azure and the degree to which it can scale.
Bob: It’s still the very early days for Azure/Mesh, but just how serious is 
Microsoft about becoming a “cloud provider”?
Patrick: Incredibly serious. We’re investing heavily to build out data centers 
around the world. Initial feedback is incredibly positive and excited—this is 
what customers want. They also have been clear that they want the flexibility to 
run software in the cloud or on-premise—they want us to make it easy for 
them to choose and to balance on-premise with cloud resources.
Bob: What about the “old Microsoft” of Windows and Office? Doesn’t 
Azure/Mesh in effect threaten the core of Microsoft?

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
68
Patrick: Innovate or die . . . new problems and new realities require new 
solutions.
That said, Windows Server and the Windows desktop obviously aren’t going 
away anytime soon, and we’re continuing to invest heavily in those areas. 
Customers are incredibly excited about Windows 7 and Windows Server 
2008 R2.
You could argue that the proliferation of web applications in the enterprise 
threatened Microsoft 5 or 10 years ago, but we responded by making the 
best web stack out there. Now users expect more richness from those web-
based applications, so we responded with Silverlight, the best RIA [rich Internet 
application] platform out there. If you want the absolute richest user expe-
rience, you’re going to want to build a Windows Presentation Foundation 
[WPF] application that runs on the Windows client. The fact that Silverlight 
delivers so many of the capabilities of WPF with reach to Mac and Linux 
browsers (via Moonlight) just gives customers more choice—maybe we’ll 
lose some Windows applications to Silverlight/Mesh because it’s so good, 
but I think we’ll win some Cocoa and Air developers over as well, so it will 
balance out.
The cloud is the next great frontier in our industry, and I think Windows 
Azure will prove itself to be the best cloud offering out there. It’s still early, 
of course.
Competition is a wonderful thing, because it drives innovation. But there is 
no other company that can deliver the range and quality of platforms we do 
with the consistency and quality of developer experience that we do. This is 
our biggest advantage; when Steve Ballmer shouts that “developers are the 
air we breathe,” I think this is what he is referring to—we provide the best 
overall platform for developers and startups to innovate on, and we must 
continue to do so as our industry evolves.
We haven’t even talked about Office or MOSS or Dynamics today . . . the 
opportunities to innovate on our platform and to partner with Microsoft are 
astounding.
Bob: What kinds of apps could startups do with Azure/Mesh? I know it’s (as 
of May 2009) very early, but speculate.
Patrick: The possibilities are endless. First of all, I think many basic web 
applications that are hosted with commodity shared hosting today will fit 
very well with Azure. Viral applications that might need to scale quickly—
such as Facebook applications—are perfectly suited.
I think we’ll see combination applications emerge where data is stored in the 
cloud but the UI [user interface] is delivered as a WPF client (or Silverlight 
Mesh client).

I think we’ll see utility services spring up by microISVs that were not realistic 
to build when you had to make your own infrastructure. I have one of these 
in mind to build myself, in fact. I think I have a good idea, and it would be 
fairly easy for me to implement. What held me back in the past was the 
possibility of success! If I really am right that it’s a good idea, then it will need 
to scale very quickly. Before Azure, I just didn’t have the bandwidth to 
manage that problem. With Azure, I don’t have to manage the scalability 
problem. Like any other microISV, now I just need to find the time and guts 
to do it!
We’ll see more and more software companies that previously only offered 
on-premise versions of their software offer cloud-based versions as well. 
Customers want the flexibility to choose either on-premise or hosted solu-
tions, and Azure provides the infrastructure to give software companies the 
ability to provide that choice to their customers.
Finally, I think we’ll see some “Why didn’t I think of that?” applications that 
were simply not possible before the cloud existed. It’s a great time to create 
a startup.
Social Networks As Platforms
Overview
In the second half of the first decade of the 21st century, something very 
different started happening, not just in the tiny bubble developers and 
startups inhabit, but to the world at large.
Up until about 2005, if you wanted to get a really big number of peo-
ple talking about the same thing, expressing the same ideas and values, 
and sharing a common experience and view point, you needed to found 
either a religion, a country, or a political ideology. Now we have MySpace, 
Facebook, Bebo, Twitter, and hundreds of other social networks.
Please don’t think this is just a case of TWH—tired writer hyperbole. 
Remember all those “soft” departments you’d walk past as you headed 
toward the Computer Science Department? Their meat and potatoes is 
trying to understand how large groups of people interact—economically, 
socially, psychologically, historically, politically.
As of early 2009, MySpace had 76 million active users, Hi5 60 million, 
Xing 6.5 million, Twitter a mere 4.5 million, and Facebook a staggering 
150 million.10 Incidentally, those numbers match the populations of,

respectively, Egypt, Italy, El Salvador, Ireland, and Russia, give or take a 
few million people.11 And, unlike countries, these social networks and 
thousands of others are growing at Internet speeds; for example, Twitter 
grew by 752% or so in 2008.12
Whether you buy my argument that social networks are akin to 
countries, one thing is for sure—there’s money to be made by startups 
on the social platform.
Main Characteristics from a Startup’s Point of View
Unlike the economies of countries, social networks are nearly only about 
advertising. Next to that Facebook wall or MySpace page you’re going to 
find ads, ads, and more ads. It’s all about eyeballs, as the old dot.com say-
ing used to go, and social platform startups—including the companies 
behind these networks—tend to be all about managing, monetizing, tar-
geting, triangulating, and displaying ads.
But advertising was and is the low-hanging fruit of the social platform. 
The real power, innovation, and excitement are happening around appli-
cations that connect segments of all those users in even deeper ways.
Advantages
The real big advantage of social networks is users—and big, giant, ridicu-
lously large numbers of them. For example, as of this writing, Causes—a 
Facebook app that lets you start and join causes you care about and make 
donations to them—had 25,892,339 monthly active users (Figure 3-5). 
Not bad for a little Berkeley, California, startup.

Disadvantages
Facebook the social network is Facebook the PaaS platform—you play by 
our rules or we cut off your oxygen faster than you can say Scrabulous.13 
And it’s not big, meany Facebook deciding which startups on their platform 
live or die; every social platform’s terms of service jealously guard the 
company’s right to zap you in an instant.
If you want access to our users, the social platform refrain goes, you’d 
better be prepared to play by our rules, including the ones we haven’t 
made up yet.

There’s a lot more to be said about social platforms and startups—like all 
of Chapter 6.
Mobile
Overview
What a difference a single product can make! A few years ago, while cell 
phone growth was blasting ever higher each quarter, smartphones—mobiles 
that could be used as platforms by aspiring startups—were a languishing 
minor part of the overall story. For example, Microsoft had its mobile 
platform’s first offering in 1996, for all that most people in or out of this 
industry cared.
Then along came the Apple iPhone (Figure 3-6). Between June 29, 
2007, when it first went on sale, to September 2008, Apple and its mobile 
service provider partners worldwide sold some 13 million units.14 From 
July 2008 to January 2009, the number of third-party apps available for 
the iPhone went from zero to 15,000 applications downloaded 500 million 
times.15 Then from January 2009 to April 23, 2009, another 500 down-
loads of more than 25,000 apps16 brought the total to a cool 1 billion 
in nine months. Let’s see: 25,000 apps and 1 billion downloads in nine 
months—ka-ching!17

Back in the dot.com days, mainstream media loved profiling “dot.com 
millionaires” with multi-hundred-million-dollar stock options and incredibly 
expensive sports cars. This time around, bloggers and traditional media 
are writing up “iPhone millionaires”18 as startups rack up huge monthly 
sales—except some of these potential iPhone millionaires are too young 
to drive (Figure 3-7).19

Figure 3-7. A 9-year-old works on the Apple iPhone platform
Although Apple has very quickly grabbed a huge market share of the 
mobile platform, Apple’s isn’t the only mobile story. While Apple was 
building a proprietary high-end mobile platform, Google was taking the 
exact opposite approach to untangling the mess of incompatible Linux-
based mobile operating systems and bringing Google Android to the party.
On the one hand Android is a complete mobile stack for cell phone 
providers, with the companies part of Google’s Open Handset Alliance 
being first at the table. On the other hand, it gives developers and startups 
one software development kit (SDK) to absorb. On the third hand 

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
75
(Androids aren’t necessarily limited), Android developers have the advan-
tage of watching what works on the iPhone and what doesn’t. And on the 
fourth hand, 13 million iPhones may sound like a lot until you realize 
there are approximately 3.3 billion cell phones on the planet and that the 
percentage of those phones sold today that are smartphones is about 13% 
and accelerating fast.20
Although right now it’s still the very early days for Android, more and 
more cell phone makers are going Android. And, yes, there’s a Google 
Android app store (Figure 3-8).

Advantages
As Andrey Butov says about his concept of platform arbitrage in the 
upcoming sidebar, mobile means money. Fewer competitors, no estab-
lished market leaders, and a public eager to spend money adding new 
digital bling to their new best friend is a compelling scenario for startups 
and investors alike.
There’s a second level of chewy goodness when it comes to mobile—
a platform beyond the idea of desktop computers, where GPS (Global 
Positioning System) and SMS mean brand new kinds of applications are 
possible.
Disadvantages
Although the feature set of iPhones and Android phones may at first glance 
appear similar, the business environment is anything but. For the iPhone, 
you get to do what Apple says you get to do, period. For Android, there’s 
the danger that cell phone makers and service providers will yet again 
screw up a common Linux standard.
Comments
Recently I was having lunch in a popular eatery in San Francisco’s tony 
Marina district. Out of the 50-odd patrons I counted 3 MacBooks, 1 PC, 
and 13 iPhones in use. I don’t know of a consumer technology that has 
changed the daily habits of so many so fast as the iPhone—and the iPhone 
may prove to be the warm-up act for the Google Android.
Andrey Butov, Antair Corporation
Way back when in 2005, I interviewed Andrey Butov for my first book, just 
after he released his first commercial product as a microISV, a .NET devel-
oper tool. Four years later, Audrey’s no-longer-micro startup sells applica-
tions (http://www.antair.com) and games (http://www.antairgames.
com) for Macs and Windows. And BlackBerries. And iPhones. Here’s how 
Andrey tells the story.
“Platform arbitrage is our approach of applying the same principles as one does 
in selection of the type of product to sell, to presentation of one product across 
multiple select platforms. While there are underdeveloped product niches 
which would work with an introduction of a better/cheaper product option, 
there are also many underdeveloped and underrepresented platforms which 
lack sufficient product choice.

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
77
“A few years ago, this was the Mac desktop. In recent years, it’s the various 
mobile platforms. For Antair, we can leverage much higher yearly revenues 
by leveraging our products against the BlackBerry and iPhone platforms as 
compared with competing on a more common platform. But platform arbi-
trage needs to be approached with the same careful analysis as product 
selection. For example, we will not port any of our current products to the 
Android platform, as it stands, although we have had requests to do so. This 
may change in the future, however.
“I’ve always run Antair as a no-niche software company; preferring to keep 
out product line diverse, both in terms of the type of product sold, as well 
as with regard to platforms on which the product was available. We believe 
that “platform arbitrage,” as I’ve come to think of it, is a wise strategy when 
designing a new product offering with the hopes of exposing it to as wide a 
market as possible.”
Antair’s first iPhone game, Sneezies (Figure 3-9), was a coproduction with 
Gavin Bowman, the founder of V4 Solutions and another microISV I had 
interviewed in 2005. It was something of a leap of faith for both developers. 
Could a cross-Atlantic development effort work?
Figure 3-9. Antair Games
“The idea for Sneezies came from my wife,” Andrey e-mailed me. “She tends 
to play a lot of casual titles that are addictive, easy to get into, and fun to 
play, so we wanted to come up with something along those lines. A game 

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
78
that has lots of polish, offers long-lasting playability, but isn’t complicated to 
get into. We’ve had some experience before with designing proper mobile 
titles (Asteroid Jane for the BlackBerry), so we kind of knew what to expect 
from the technical side, and we were familiar with what would be required 
from our artists.
“We thought the game was fun even in the early stages, but what Gavin 
delivered in the end simply blew everyone away. Sneezies was so polished, 
and was balanced so perfectly, that everyone from our guys at the Antair 
offices, to our publishers, to the players consistently commenting that they 
love the game and can’t put it down. After shipping the game, Gavin put in 
a lot of marketing effort, and, as word of the game spread, Antair was hit 
with an avalanche of positive feedback and reviews from players around 
the world.”
“I still wake up in the mornings and run my day as a self-employed microISV,” 
Gavin told me as I was putting together this chapter. “Antair Games runs for 
the most part as an autonomous, self-sufficient entity. So I have most of the 
same concerns and priorities I had when I was running V4 Solutions, so I 
don’t feel like that chapter is closed.
“The relationship with Antair has allowed me to retire a few of my “hats,” 
as you would say, but I don’t miss any of them, most notably the financials 
and accounting stuff. I always had a partner in V4, so there’s nothing new 
there. But that was a largely silent arrangement; I communicate and confer 
with Andrey constantly. I’m also in constant contact with Craig Sharpe, our 
artist. He deserves as much credit for the work we do at Antair Games 
these days as me. He’s in yet another corner of the world—we’re a well-
distributed team!
“As Andrey mentioned in his e-mail, our relationship is an oddity. It’s very 
difficult to give advice or to recommend anyone follow our example, because 
the role trust has played in the development of that relationship is huge. 
However, it has worked perfectly for us. We’ve been able to focus entirely 
on making good software and getting a lot done from day 1, instead of getting 
bogged down in technicalities.”
One of the things Andrey in New York City and Gavin in Cumbria in the 
“cold, dark north” of the U.K. illustrate is that whatever commonalities 
startups share, it is how they come into existence and who the people are 
that make each a unique solution to the general business problem of bringing 
software to life.

Eric Chu, Google Mobile Platforms Program Manager
Eric Chu has the huge task of making one of the most anticipated mobile phone 
platform releases live up to high expectations. I was able to ask him via e-mail a 
few questions about what Android as a platform offers startups.
Bob: For a startup, what are the big advantages in picking Android as their 
platform?
Eric: Our goal is to create a platform and content distribution system to make 
it easier for developers to create and distribute compelling mobile applications. 
Our decision to build Android from the ground up allowed us to leverage the 
latest technologies available to build a truly modern mobile platform.
Our Open Source model with Android makes it extremely attractive for 
different handset manufacturers and carriers to adopt and deploy Android-
based handsets. We believe this is the best approach to drive up volume. 
Our investment in Android Market provides a simple “one-stop” distribu-
tion mechanism to deliver apps to many Android devices around the world. 
We believe the combination of a powerful platform on many different devices 
from a wide range of device manufacturers, coupled with a global content 
distribution system, makes Android an extremely attractive platform for 
startups to monetize on.
Bob: How would you compare Android as a platform for building a startup 
vs. iPhone or BlackBerry?
Eric: It is extremely hard to compare specific devices with a platform, such 
as Android, that will be available from many different handset makers. The 
Android platform offers developers the opportunity to create innovative 
experiences via features such as multitasking, mobile mashup, and access to 
hardware and system-level functions.
We also believe Android Market’s open model has proven to be attractive 
to developers and users alike. However, it is also important to point out that 
approximately 1 billion handsets are sold every year. It probably makes sense 
for developers to make their products available on more than one platform 
or device.
Bob: Is there an Android developer program, above and beyond http://
code.google.com/android and http://developer.android.com?
Eric: No. However, developers should also sign up with Android Market. 
http://developer.android.com is the new site for developers. We’re 
now updating content on http://code.google.com/android. Developers 
should also visit http://market.android.com/publish/signup and sign 
up to distribute their applications through Android Market.
Bob: What advice would you give a startup mulling their platform choices?

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
80
Eric: Conventional wisdom is to target volume. However, it is even more 
important to target the right “volume.” Developers should pay close atten-
tion to the volume that equates to actual usage. While there might be billions 
of mobile devices out there, for each of the device types and platforms, are 
users really using the data services? In addition, as this market opens up, the 
friction that will prevent users from finding apps will continue to lower. That 
means users will gravitate toward great apps in larger and larger volume. It 
will become increasingly more important for developers to have an 
awesome product to guarantee success rather than distribution advantages.
Hybrid
Overview
Okay, this kind of platform should be called cross-platform, but reading 
about a cross-platform platform gives my copyeditor a headache and lacks 
the coolness, panache, and shininess of hybrid. Think of it: no more quasi-
religious flame post wars over which is the best platform, no more end-
less debates on whether which is “better”—desktop or web.
The two big players in the hybrid platform space are Adobe Flex/AIR 
(Figure 3-10) and Microsoft Silverlight. For Adobe, Flex turns the ubiqui-
tous Flash browser plug-in into the runtime for a user interface layer that 
delivers performance and usability not seen in standard web apps, with the 
very real advantage of being able to live on the Windows and Mac desktops
Microsoft Silverlight—as of this writing and I’ll bet not for much 
longer21—lacks the ability to run as solely a desktop app. But what it does 
have is a pared-down .NET framework that lets programmers develop in 
Microsoft Visual Studio not only in C# and VB, but in dynamic languages 
such as Ruby and PHP. Furthermore, Silverlight is an extension of Microsoft’s 
partner ecology, including a growing number of commercial .NET control 
vendors.
21 Silverlight 3 Beta, released March 18, 2009, added both out-of-browser and offline capabilities.

Figure 3-10. TweetDeck—an Adobe AIR app
While the Flex platform continues to grow and evolve and make head-
way behind the enterprise firewall, according to Adobe technical evangelist 
James Ward, Silverlight got a global-sized win when NBC used it as its 
online platform for the 2008 Summer Olympics and lets .NET developers 
be .NET developers,  says Josh Holmes, Microsoft UX architect evangelist.22
Main Characteristics from a Startup’s Point of View

officially dead and the future belonged to Web 2.0? Ha! Turns out most

people, when given a list of the benefits of web apps and a list of the 
advantages of desktop apps, answer, “Both. Right now.”
Cross-platform apps—especially those that can run disconnected 
from the net—give you as the startup founder the largest possible pool 
of potential customers, and that’s a very nice thing to have.
Advantages
First and foremost, it’s breaking the iron chains of HTML. Since the first 
Common Gateway Interface (CGI) form on a Netscape browser, develop-
ers working on web apps have had to use a text markup language to code. 
Everything at the end of the JavaScript day goes into HTML and has to 
come out of HTML. And don’t even get me started on CSS, browser idio-
syncrasies, or the joys of catering to Internet Explorer 6’s perverse set of 
DOM “features.”
The second big advantage of hybrid platforms accrues to all those 
desktop developers who were left behind to rot, doing maintenance years 
ago, by the Web App Rapture. For desktop programmers locked out of the 
Web 2.0 game, both Flex/AIR and Silverlight are a way to go forward with 
real development platforms, whether the customer uses a Mac or a Windows 
box, HTML be damned.
Disadvantages
Welcome to the cutting edge of technology. (Please don’t bleed on this 
book until you’ve bought it.) Whether it’s Flex or Silverlight, you’re talking 
about software platforms with plenty of open manhole covers—everything 
is fine until you drop through the hole. In both cases platform develop-
ment is out of your hands, and the feature that you absolutely have to 
have to build your startup’s app that was sure to be in the next version 
real soon now may or may not be there.
A cool, snazzy 10-minute demo at a conference or in a book is one 
thing; a platform stable and robust enough to pour thousands of sweat 
equity hours and millions of equity-financed dollars into is something else 
again. As of this writing (May 2009), whereas there are plenty of demo 
apps, enterprise apps, and showoff apps for both Flex and Silverlight, 
there’s only a handful of commercial apps.

Comments
The problem for hybrid-based apps is that startups are businesses first, 
places to play with cool technology second. Apple and Google, each in its 
own way, made sure there were real apps for sale for their respective plat-
forms; Adobe and Microsoft, for their own reasons, haven’t seen the world 
in that particular light, at least not yet.
For what it’s worth, I think the best thing Adobe or Microsoft can do 
for the latest and greatest technologies is pick 25 developers, hand them 
each $25,000 for a nominal 5% equity stake to keep the bean counters 
happy, and get some real startups offering real products out there. Until 
something like that happens, angel investors and VCs will not be lining up 
to fund hybrid startups the way they have iPhone and Android startups.
Jeff Haynie, CEO, Appcelerator
In addition to Adobe and Microsoft, others out there are looking to provide 
a hybrid web/desktop platform for developers. One of the most interesting 
is Jeff Haynie and Appcelerator (http://titaniumapp.com). Building off a 
$4.1 million Series A funding in December 2008, Appcelerator is an early-
stage startup going for the big prize by offering web-skilled JavaScript devel-
opers a way to build products that run on Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
What’s more, Appcelerator and its development tool, Appcelerator Titanium  
(see Figure 3-11), are Open Source—building a tool and a community around 
that tool and tapping the enthusiasm of that community are the first steps in 
Appcelerator’s long-term strategy. Earlier this decade that $4.1 million would be 
burned through in a matter of weeks. Today, Jeff is confident that Appceler-
ator’s financial runway is long enough for him and his 12 employees to achieve 
takeoff.
Bob: What’s it like being a platform startup going up against the likes of 
Adobe and Microsoft?
Jeff: We’re excited! There’s plenty of room in the industry for multiple solu-
tions, and the industry deserves (and desperately needs) a viable open web 
platform that’s developed in an Open Source model. It’s about giving people 
more choice and flexibility, and we believe our platform allows for that.
Bob: What do you see as the future of bringing web technology down to 
the desktop?

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
84
Figure 3-11. Appcelerator’s Titanium developer
Jeff: I believe the convergence of cloud computing combined with the need 
to have access to applications across a variety of mediums (desktop, mobile, 
phone) provides a great opportunity for applications and application plat-
forms to move back to the desktop—but not in a way that we are used to. 
Tomorrow’s desktop applications will be much more web-native while still 
leveraging the capabilities and functionality of the desktop environment.
Bob: What’s Titanium and the Appcelerator SDK’s big advantage? What do 
you tell startups to woo them to you?
Jeff: Titanium is an open architecture, Open Source runtime for building 
cross–operating system, cross-technology applications for the desktop using 
web technologies. Our message is simple: as an application developer you 
can build very compelling applications that leverage your existing web tooling, 
web skill sets, and web infrastructure—today. And you can seamlessly run 
those applications across all major operating systems, completely unchanged.
Bob: Your platform is Open Source. How will you make money? And how 
do your investors expect to make the kind of money they are looking for?
Jeff: Our platform and tools are Open Source and will remain Open Source. 
Our plan is to introduce some additional, complementary cloud-services 
capabilities that add value by helping you reduce cost and burden in your 
application life cycle. However, right now we’re focused on building out the 
best technology platform and working with application developers from 
around the world to deploy those applications—that’s our primary focus.
Bob: Given the depth of technical expertise you have, you certainly could 
have brought to market one or more applications. Why focus on building a 
platform?

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
85
Jeff: We think that our job is to enable many other developers, worldwide, 
to build what they believe is creative, passionate, and interesting to them—
something that scales well. We’re already seeing applications being devel-
oped with our products that we never could have even dreamed of when we 
envisioned the uses of the platform initially. What’s great about being an 
open architecture is that people can build on what we’ve done and extend 
the vision and capabilities to many others. We view Titanium similar to what’s 
happened to Linux—it originally started out as an alternative to Unix but 
now powers everything from desktops and servers to cars and cell phones.
Bob: What’s your advice to startups who are mulling over their platform 
choices?
Jeff: The best platforms are ones that don’t require you to reinvest in new 
skills and new infrastructure and that ultimately give you the power to control 
your own destiny. That’s what we believe makes a good open web platform.
Bob: Any other advice for startups?
Jeff: This is a very exciting and difficult time for startups and entrepreneurs—
particularly given the world economic crisis. I think it can be summed up 
by two quotes: “Longevity is credibility” (Jason Calacanis) and “Sales solves 
everything” (Mark Cuban).
Here are some general startup thoughts I wrote a few months ago that are 
more relevant than ever: http://blog.jeffhaynie.us/the-economic-
downturn-and-your-startup.html.
Peldi Guilizzoni, Balsamiq Studios
Giacomo “Peldi” Guilizzoni is a great example of how a self-funded startup 
can, by doing the right things in the right way, rapidly build momentum, staff, 
and revenue without resorting to equity financing. Peldi, an Italian, came 
over to the United States to work for Macromedia (now part of Adobe) as 
programmer in the Flash group, working on Flash Media Server and Breeze 
(now Adobe Connect). After years of gaining knowledge about and contributing 
to Adobe’s effort to expand Flash to something more than a way to play 
video in web browsers, he returned to Bologna, Italy, focused single-mindedly 
on building Balsamiq Mockups (http://www.balsamiq.com) (Figure 3-12), 
an Adobe AIR tool for programmers, experienced designers, and product 
managers and launched.
Peldi’s strategy was threefold: (1) build a great app that made mocking up 
web and desktop apps extremely easy, (2) get to know IT bloggers and offer 
them licenses and support while using his blog to share his passion and build 
credibility, and (3) tap Twitter as a way of connecting to even more people, 
especially developers checking their social networks for recommendations 
for prototyping, wireframing, and mockup tools.

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
86
Figure 3-12. Balsamiq Mockups
Within eight months, Peldi had brought his wife into the business to help 
with support, hired his first full-time employee, and cleared $300,000 in 
revenue.
I’ve interviewed Peldi before, for the Startup Success Podcast. In an industry 
where egos inflate to blimp size after three paragraphs in TechCrunch, I found 
refreshing his combination of passion for his product, his willingness to help 
other startups, and his down-to-earth, get-the-job-done attitude.
Bob: What’s it like dealing with two very different kinds of users—Mac and 
Windows—plus pure web-centric users?
Peldi: Let’s not forget Linux users as well! :)
Lucky for developers, the recent advent of browser-based web apps has 
lowered everyone’s expectations, with every web app behaving differently 
than the next, and very few of them having the polish of a desktop app. So 
you can get away with more. That said, this is an opportunity to delight your 
users by giving them applications that, while cross-platform and online/offline, 
feel native as much as possible.

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
87
In general, I have learned that people are passionate about these little differ-
ences, so you should respect them and try to fulfill them as much as possible, 
even if you might personally not care as much about them. That’s why we 
use the system’s window chrome instead of drawing our own, or why we 
offer an option to hide the app with Apple+H on the Mac, for instance.
As always, it’s about providing an experience users are familiar with: “Don’t 
make them think” (Steve Krug, http://www.sensible.com), especially 
about how to move, resize, and minimize a window . . . please!
Bob: What do you see as the advantages of developing a platform-
independent app?
Peldi: Having grown up professionally at Macromedia, where cross-platform 
compatibility was considered a competitive advantage, I don’t really see any 
other option. Building an application for a single platform feels so limiting to 
me, especially now that it’s relatively easy to build a cross-platform one. More 
and more people are buying Macs these days, and Ubuntu is user-friendly 
enough to make it a viable consumer-level OS. Plus there’s the web, of course, 
and mobile. I think any modern app should be able to run on all of those plat-
forms, or it will lose out to others that can.
Bob: What about disadvantages?
Peldi: Adobe AIR takes care of most of the hassles for me: they offer APIs 
which abstract out most OS-specific differences nicely, and they provide a 
smooth installation and upgrade experience with virtually no effort on my 
part.
That said, there will always be platform-specific bugs to work around, so you 
have to be fluent in all modern operating systems, a required skill to run a 
microISV anyways.
I run Parallels on my laptop so that I can test features and bugs on OS X, 
Windows XP, and Ubuntu all on the same machine. I have resisted buying a 
Vista license, but I might be forced to since some of my customers are reporting 
a number of issues that only happen on Vista . . . not a great reason to buy 
an OS license is it? ;)
Bob: You’re also part of the XWiki wiki “ecosystem,” which is Open Source, 
with XWiki SAS, the creators of XWiki, selling support for it. How do you 
convince people to pay for a plug-in that works in an Open Source app?
Peldi: It’s not an easy task, and I haven’t been doing a great job at it so far. 
First of all, you have to find an open-source platform which will legally let 
you extend it commercially: XWiki uses LGPL [Lesser General Public License], 
but many others use GPL [General Public License], which forbids commercial 
extensions (or, rather, it’s a gray area that I like to stay out of).
One business model that seems to work is the “free software, paid support” 
one, but it’s not one that I’m a big fan of. Ideally, software should be easy and 
solid enough to require no support, right?

I would suggest looking at http://robertogaloppini.net. Roberto is a 
specialist in commercial Open Source software, consulting on marketing and 
business strategy, and his blog has a host of tips on this subject.
Bob: Balsamiq Mockups is an Adobe Flex/AIR app. What’s that been like to 
develop?
Peldi: It’s been great fun! The Flex framework is powerful, mature, and fast 
enough to build any sort of application that I like to build (simple ones which 
don’t try to boil the ocean but, rather, try solve a small problem really well). 
Like any framework it has a bit of a learning curve. There’s a huge commu-
nity of developers to help you and loads of online resources to get started. 
Once you have a web app built in Flex, adapting it to run on AIR takes liter-
ally a couple of hours. Adobe AIR is a fairly young platform (it’s at version 1.
5 at the time of writing), but it’s already mature, cross-platform from the 
ground up, and has the mighty power of Adobe behind it. Adobe is deeply 
committed to the AIR and offers great support for it to its developers—via 
forums, mailing lists, and a very good prerelease program. They release new 
updates fairly often (perhaps two or three a year), so bugs get squashed 
fairly quickly.
The development environment (Flex Builder) is also good: it’s based on Eclipse, 
and it offers everything a modern IDE [integrated development environment] 
should offer (integrated debugger, profiler, etc.). Development is really fast 
and allows for quick iteration easily.
There’s still a lot that Air could do of course, but so far I’ve been really happy 
with it. I think senior developers out there should try to forget their old 
preconceptions about Flash applications and take a second look at Flex/AIR. It 
really has come a long way.
Bob: If your startup decided today to do another app, would you stick with 
Adobe?
Peldi: I’d say so, yes. For cross-platform applications that run both on 
the Web and offline, in my mind the choice is between either Flex/AIR or 
HTML+JS plus a a browser wrapper. Anything else just doesn’t have the 
market penetration or maturity necessary to be a contender.
The choice between these depends on the nature of the application. HTML+JS 
has better accessibility story (better text handling, focus support, etc.), but, 
IMHO, nothing beats Flash for rich, highly graphical interactive experiences 
(like an image editor, for instance).
People get religious about these things, but I like to take a more pragmatic 
approach. In the end the opinion of the developer matters little relative to 
the overall user experience for the customer.
Bob: You also recently hired your first employee. How did you decide on 
who to hire when?

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
89
Peldi: Yes! His first week just ended yesterday, and already I couldn’t be 
happier. My goal with Balsamiq has been to grow it to a four- to five-person 
company from the start, slowly and organically. When I started up I told 
myself that I would hire someone as soon as I noticed the level of customer 
service I was providing to my customers and prospects starting to be less 
than spectacular. A couple of months ago I started having over 150 new 
customers per week, which I could still manage (barely), but it took all of my 
time, leaving no time for coding new features. I started only coding on the 
weekends for a while, but that’s not sustainable, nor is it really enough for 
what I want to do with the product. Since I already had enough in the bank 
to cover for a programmer’s first year of salary, the decision to hire 
someone became self-evident at the end of a particularly rough day.
As for who to hire, I knew I wanted a generalist as employee #1. Marco fits 
the bill beautifully. He is mostly going to focus on programming at first, but 
he can wear all of the 47 hats (Bob Walsh, http://www.47hats.com) required 
for a microISV. I have interviewed many candidates in my career, and once 
in a blue moon someone comes in that’s clearly a cut above the rest, someone 
who is '“done, and gets things smart” (Steve Yegge, http://steve-yegge.
blogspot.com/2008/06/done-and-gets-things-smart.html). Marco is 
that kind of person, I got really lucky.
Bob: Any advice for startups who want to succeed?
Peldi: Ah, the million-dollar question. I think success is a combination of a 
number of factors: first and foremost, passion and hard, hard work. Solving 
a real problem which saves people money and “makes meaning” (Guy Kawasaki, 
http://blog.guykawasaki.com/2006/01/the_venture_cap.html, and 
see Chapter 9) is the most important thing. I also think company values are 
important (Zappos, http://about.zappos.com/our-unique-culture/
zappos-core-values). We are trying to build a company that’s passionate 
about customer service, provides outstanding user experiences, and is human, 
inclusive, respectful, transparent, generous, socially conscious, and green. 
Wouldn’t you like to do business with a company like that? :)
Open Source/CMS
Overview
Ever since the first days of commercial software, there’s been the phe-
nomenon of startups springing up to complement some larger software 
application. For example, surrounding Microsoft Excel are literally hun-
dreds of specialized commercial add-ins; these add-ins are an important, 
externalized, value that buttresses Excel market dominance.

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
90
That trend continues to this day, although it has morphed into two 
variants: add-ins and supplemental products for proprietary applications 
such as Microsoft SharePoint and Lotus Notes and plug-ins, modules, and 
templates for Open Source projects such as WordPress, Joomla, and Drupal.
Main Characteristics from a Startup’s Point of View
If you’re a [fill in the blank] developer who sees an unmet need people 
will pay good money to fill, creating a microISV to bring that solution to 
market is a natural-enough evolution.
Each of these broadly speaking content management systems is a 
horizontal platform just waiting for vertical solutions for industries, markets, 
and individuals with very specific needs.
Advantages
The good news for developers who want to go down this particular startup 
road is that if you have solid knowledge of the larger system you are plug-
ging into and you execute decently, then your market is going to find you 
more than you need to find them. That’s because they’re desperate.
The common failing of any general software app is that it’s too general; 
and the bigger the pool of users, the more needs around the edges go unmet.
Disadvantages
The bad news for developers of add-ins comes in a choice of flavors: pro-
prietary and Open Source.
For proprietary systems such as Microsoft SharePoint, the main issue 
is that you’re the mouse locked in the same cage as the elephant—you 
can get stepped on in their next release and squished flat. Assuming you 
don’t get squished, there’s another serious issue—the small size of your 
prospective market. The more specialized your add-in, the smaller the 
market and the fewer new potential customers you can sell to each year.
For those aspiring to add value to Open Source projects in a finan-
cially rewarding way, you have two major hurdles: the Open Source legal 
framework (for example, the GPL license), which means your app needs to 
be GPL with source code freely available, and the pitchforks-and-burning-
torches ire most commercialized Open Source ventures get from The 
Community.

Comments
If you get the sense that this is my least recommended startup platform, 
you’re right. On the one hand, as much effort and toil can go into a good 
add-in as into a stand-alone app. On the other, you’re stuck being a very 
small frog in a very small pond that in the course of proprietary software 
evolution can dry up overnight. The cautionary tale of dozens and dozens 
of VB6 control makers comes to mind.
As for commercial startups orbiting Open Source projects, you might 
be happily acquired by a larger company (such as the case of antispam 
comment startup Defensio’s acquisition by publically traded online secu-
rity giant Websense23), if you happen to be one of those fortunate people 
on a first-name basis with Luck.
Mac Desktop and Windows Desktop
Overview
As we wrap up our tour of potential platforms for your startup, we’re back 
to the future: the desktop. It’s easy to forget in this business so dominated 
by all things online just where the vast bulk of applications, companies, and 
revenue is—on the desktop. For example, Gartner, Inc., estimated that 
worldwide 2008 SaaS enterprise revenue had grown 27% to $6.4 billion.24 
Compare that to the worldwide packaged software industry for all platforms, 
estimated by International Data Corp. at $179 billion in 2004, according 
to the Software & Information Industry Association.
Main Characteristics from a Startup’s Point of View
Simply put, its users. For most practical purposes, everyone your startup 
might sell to uses a computer running either Microsoft’s or Apple’s oper-
ating system, with the split being 88.41% Windows, 9.61% Mac and 
Linux, and all the rest the balance as of March 8, 2009, according to 
Market Share.25

Advantages
“Quantity has a quality all its own,” whether you’re referring to tank pro-
duction during World War II or the number of people out there who can 
buy your software. Add to that mature operating systems, robust develop-
ment platforms, well-defined categories, and all the rest, and it adds up 
to still the single biggest game in town for startups.
Also, there’s desktop software and there’s desktop software. How 
many thousands, if not tens of thousands, of software applications out 
there are as functional today as the day 1.0 hit the streets but no longer 
rise to what customers and businesses expect in the Internet Age?
If everything was perfect about desktop computing, we’d still be in 
the Age of Bill and Steve. But it’s not. Desktop software, compared to all 
the other platforms, tends to look quaint, unsexy, and maybe, just maybe, 
one foot in the grave.
Disadvantages
The biggest problem for startups when it comes to desktop platforms is 
their maturity. Most of the big battles over which vendor would dominate 
a given market have been fought and decided years ago. The number of 
startups trying to take on market leaders on their own desktop turf are 
few, far between, and dwindling.
Comments
Online media aside, desktop software is going to be with us for a long, 
long time, and there’s still plenty of money to be made and startups to be 
developed for both Windows and Mac boxes. If your passion takes you 
toward the desktop, more power to you and your customers.
Scott Morrison, Founder, Indev
Scott Morrison’s InDev (http://www.indev.ca) sells two add-in applica-
tions for Apple Mail on the Mac: Mail Act On and Mail Tags. I asked him 
what’s it like being a Mac desktop software company these days.
Bob: What do you see as the current advantages of developing commercial 
applications for the Mac?

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
93
Scott:
1. Fabulous development environment and frameworks. Xcode has really 
matured since OS X 10.0 days, when it was called Project Builder. Now 
it is a free but first-rate programming IDE built upon widely used and 
supported tools such as GCC and GDB. The application framework 
(Cocoa) that is the core of application development has evolved signif-
icantly as well—given programmers a well-designed and documented 
toolbox for creating apps.
Many things that would take a significant effort a short time ago or on 
other platforms, such as UI animation, are given to you so that you 
spend less time worrying about details and reinventing the wheel and 
more time focused on building the solution/application you want. In 
short, it makes it much easier to develop high-quality applications.
2. A high standard of quality. Macs are noted for their high standard of 
quality—and this is not due to just the hardware and the OS. Indeed, 
part of the “quality equation” of the Mac are high-quality applications 
produced by companies other than Apple. This give developers many 
fantastic models for what can be done and what is the expectation of 
quality. However, just because the bar is often set high, it doesn’t mean 
that it is unattainable. In fact, some of the best software available for the 
Mac is done by companies that number under five people, and many great 
apps are by one-person operations. This gives the startup developer a lot 
of encouragement that such quality is reasonably attainable.
3. Very healthy platform. Over the last five years, the Mac has become a 
very healthy platform. Some could say this is part of the iPod halo 
effect. But in reality, if the platform wasn’t solid, there could be no Mac 
consequence of Apple’s having an exploding iPod market. The iPod 
didn’t make the Mac great. The Mac was great and the easy accessibility 
of the iPod to a broad audience brought more exposure to Mac so that 
more people could appreciate the OS X platform more.
Consequently, the Mac is a strong market, and, more importantly, it is 
a market where quality of experience, rather than price, is the main 
selling proposition. And when you are looking at people who purchase 
on the basis of quality, you have a better market: those who will are 
looking for more than “good enough” and are willing to pay a bit more 
to get it. You get a marketplace that is more willing to open its wallet 
when it sees what it likes.

4. Expansion of applications into sectors such as iPhone. With the advent of 
the iPhone, there is a surge of interest in development in one of Apple’s 
core technologies—Objective-C and Cocoa. With these technologies 
on both platforms now, a Mac developer is that much more versatile. 
Toss in 280North work on Objective-J and Cappuccino, and you can 
add web app development into the mix. While these frameworks are not 
100% transferable, they subscribe to a similar philosophy and approach to 
application development, and most skills and understandings can be trans-
ferable. On that vein, last year at WWDC [Worldwide Developers 
Conference] there was a session “iPhone development for Mac devel-
opers.” This year there is a session “Mac development for iPhone 
developers.” It is an exciting time to be a developer looking at Objective C 
and Cocoa because it opens doors to three different and very dynamic 
platforms and markets.
5. A friendly and vibrant developer community. I just returned from 
NSConference 2009 in the UK, and it was perhaps the best conference 
I attended. There is a tremendous amount of collegiality and openness 
among those who are working on the Objective–C/Cocoa platform. It 
is very easy to get assistance and advice from others, who are often in 
(or were recently in) the same position as a developer trying to get 
their first product together. This advice is also not just about coding—
but will cover a wide range of pertinent topics, such as running a microISV 
company, building a store or an interface or a web site, etc.
Bob: How about disadvantages?
Scott: Thinking hard about this question, one has to separate the down-
sides about being a microISV from being a Mac microISV. I think there are 
two that are specific to being a Mac microISV: First, you are not ostensibly 
dealing with as large a market share as Windows. That said, I think this is 
somewhat overestimated, particularly with respect to microISVs. While by 
some reckoning the Windows market is nine time the Mac market, once you 
deal with the number of machines in the hands of individual users or small 
businesses/organization, where purchasing decisions are not made by a CTO, 
there is not as much disproportion in market share.
Large organizations routinely don’t purchase the kinds of software that most 
microISVs make, and there is greater push from those markets toward web-
based solutions. Where microISVs make their bread and butter is with indi-
viduals and small organizations and businesses. It is a more level playing field 
when you consider platforms at this level. Furthermore, it is my experience 
and estimation that Mac users spend more on microISV products than do 
Windows users. In all I think it more or less balances out, and some people 
have said that market share difference is often negligible and that sometimes 
Mac products will sell better than their Windows counterparts, despite 
perceptions of market share.

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
95
The other disadvantage is finding community of developers in specific locals. 
I am based in Montreal and it is tough finding other Cocoa programmers 
here. Different areas have larger communities, but I think here is one area 
where market share has a perceivable impact. Mind you, this will change with 
time, and there are some great opportunities, such as NSConference in the 
UK and C4 in Chicago, where a short flight is all it takes to have two to 
three days of Cocoa discussion bliss and to build those contacts that sustain 
continuing online discussions.
Bob: What would you say to other developers who think, “Desktop apps 
are obsolete”?
Scott: Not at all. Or more specifically, this may be more true for Windows 
applications than for OS X applications. Because of what the OS X applica-
tion experience is, many OS-X users are less satisfied by web apps than 
are Windows users. One example: I have watched Windows users work 
with Windows applications and with web applications—and quite frankly 
the experience is essentially the same: open files by navigating through open 
dialog boxes, copying and pasting text, pictures, etc., dealing with lots of modal 
and semimodal interfaces. When watching Mac users work with desktop 
apps—it is a different experience. People use drag-and-drop, SpotLight, 
QuickLook, Expose, the Dock to a much greater extent. And when they 
start using a web application, they are stymied and have to “downgrade” 
their experience to a less dynamic one.
Mind you, web apps are improving, and there are certain advantages, such as 
ease of sharing of data with others, that web apps will always have over 
desktop apps, for user and developer alike. But I think that there are still 
many applications that, because of the experience, will generally feel better 
on the computer than on the Web. The other thing to reflect on for OS X 
developers is that with the development of tools such as Objective-J and 
Cappuccino, web apps can leverage existing programming experience and 
technologies to a great extent.
Bob: Any advice for those developers who want to create a Mac-centric 
startup?
Scott: Become passionate about programming and the environment first—
find a way to monetize that passion. There was a discussion at the NSCon-
ference where I made an observation that there are a large number of devel-
opers hitting the iPhone SDK because they see a gold rush.
As a result, we sometimes see a race for the bottom—underpricing and 
undervaluing of applications because there isn’t always a bar of quality that is 
being met. The sense is that developers are wanting to cash in on a phenom-
enon and not really grasping the essence of what that phenomenon is about. 
But I also am starting to see a bit of a pushback from passionate developers 
and the push that better apps are ones that demand a little better price because 
they are meeting higher estimations of standards.

Take Tweetie [http://www.atebits.com/tweetie-mac], for example. 
Here is an application that came first to the iPhone, where, at $2.99, it was 
more expensive than many other Twitter clients. But because it was designed 
and developed with a better sense of the user experience, it has succeeded 
more than others. A couple days ago it was released for the Mac—and it is 
a beautifully executed, well-designed application that is a pleasure and fun to 
use. There are dozens of Twitter applications, some cocoa based, others 
based on frameworks such as Air. But Tweetie got my nod. Why? Because 
more than having the right mix of features, the app captured, better than 
others, that passion of what it is to be a Mac application.
To me, this is a company that is passionate about the platform environment 
and the experience and that has developed a product that monetizes this 
passion and that will in the long run be more sustainable than a company that 
is concerned with making a buck.
Gwen Hilyard, Cofounder, Brisworks
Gwen Hilyard is one of four cofounders of Brisworks (http://brisworks.
com), a distributed company that makes and sells a Windows Active Directory–
centric network management application: Admin Arsenal. I asked Gwen 
what’s it like building a desktop software company when seemingly all the 
press and adulation goes elsewhere.
Bob: Admin Arsenal is a Windows system administration tool. What’s it like 
being a Windows app in an age when seemingly everyone touts the Web?
Gwen: There is a certain faddishness to web-based applications. They have 
their place, certainly, but it seems too many applications are shoehorned 
into the space. From a systems administrator perspective, it gets a bit annoying 
when an application requires installation in IIS [Internet Information Services], 
even though it doesn’t really need it (because such installations can be a real 
headache). While many web apps are getting there, we have discovered that 
some system administration tasks just perform better from an installed 
application. We don’t really think very many would look down on a desktop 
application, since there is so much out there that doesn’t go the web route. 
Users will run what works; they don’t really care about the difference.
Bob: You and your three cofounders have a huge amount of sys admin 
experience among you. Why did you decide to do a desktop app?
Gwen: Browser-based applications still lag behind their GUI [graphical user 
interface] counterparts in richness and interactivity. Ajax is closing the gap, 
but it’s still got quite a ways to go. Also, not requiring a server of any kind 
(web server or database server) makes our deployment much simpler. Some 
of Admin Arsenal’s predecessors were web based, but they were internally 
developed applications where we had full control of all server and security 
functionality.

  So Many Platforms, So Many Options
97
Our main reason for going with a desktop app was to get away from server 
infrastructure and all the installation and configuration headaches. A selling 
point of Admin Arsenal is the minimal time it takes from download to usability, 
and a server would get in the way of that.
Bob: What do you see as the best reasons today for doing a Windows 
desktop app?
Gwen: It depends on the application, really. Rich client functionality is drop-
dead simple on the desktop, relative to Ajax, even with powerful frameworks. 
Web-based applications work best with occasional users who may be on 
different operating systems. There’s a trade-off for that kind of ubiquity.
Bob: What do you and your cofounders like the most—and the least—
about being part of the Microsoft world?
Gwen: There is a huge market, great development tools, and a gap in the 
native systems administration functionality.
Bob: What do you see about developing for Windows that recommends 
itself to a new startup?
Gwen: Startups need to base platform decisions on the needs of their apps 
and markets. It’s usually quite clear which way to go, when it comes time to 
decide. You need to be unafraid of going with solid, “unsexy” options if it 
serves your market. To paraphrase an old quote, “It’s the users, stupid.” 
Though we will say that one advantage of Windows, specifically, is Microsoft 
Visual Studio. It gets pooh-poohed out on the Interwebs, but it’s a marvel of 
engineering and a joy to use.
Recap
At the beginning of this chapter we talked again about the Age of Bill 
(Gates) and Steve (Jobs) and bipolar platform choices open to startups 
through the last two decades of the previous century. But that was then 
and this is now, and that means that if you’re going to build a startup, 
perhaps the single most important decision you are going to make is 
what platform or platforms you will build on.
Whether it is SaaS, PaaS, social, mobile, hybrid, Open Source/CMS, 
desktop, or something else, each platform affords certain advantages and 
takes away potential opportunities. There is no one right platform, better 
platform, or best platform for your startup. The only wrong platform choice 
is the one you make without thought as to whether the startup into which 
you want to breathe life can prosper there. Just because you’re a web 
developer or a desktop developer, love all things social networky, or sleep 
with your iPhone does not mean that that particular platform is the auto-
matic right business/technical choice for you as you commit yourself.

Hopefully this drive-by tour of platforms has you thinking about the 
one or more platforms that give the startup you want to create, or the 
startup you have created, the best shot at the big gold ring.
Just as you’re the beneficiary of where the software industry has 
evolved to, you’re also in line to be able to take advantage of a whole slew 
of technologies, services, and tools that will make your life as a startup 
developer easier. Next stop, the startup development zone (cue the Twi-
light Zone theme)!

Tools and Groups 
for Startups
“A successful tool is one that was used to do something 
undreamt of by its author.”
—Stephen C. Johnson (programmer who wrote the Portable C compiler)
“Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful people could 
change the world. Indeed, it’s the only thing that ever has.”
—Margaret Mead (American cultural anthropologist)
Back in the Day . . .
In this chapter we’re going to stock up your startup toolkit with a few 
power tools to get the job done faster and more easily and have a look at 
startup groups, gatherings, and events, online and off.
Now, this is not a book about programming tools—given the number 
of platforms we just covered in Chapter 3; that would be a six-volume set. 
Instead, by tools for startups I mean the services, sites, and programs that 
exist today to make it easier for you to start a small software company. 
Some of these items are on offer from large IT companies who want you to 
build on what they’ve done; some are from startups themselves who are 
solving problems whose solutions you need. A few have been around for 
over a decade, helping developers become founders; several are so new 
(fair warning—including one of my own) that the paint is barely dry.
Open Source libraries and tools are something we as developers use 
in one fashion or another every workday, but the rules change when you 
start talking about incorporating Open Source code in your startup’s 
DNA. We’ll talk with someone who really understands the ins and outs of 
this: Gene Landy, author of IT/Digital Legal Companion, about some of 
the do’s and don’ts of using Open Source code.

Having loaded up with tools and services that help your startup, it’s 
time to get you out from behind your monitors and out mingling, meet-
ing, learning from, and even having fun with people who are facing many 
of the same challenges you are—the Startup Community, both in the ana-
log world and online. I think you’ll be surprised as to just how many 
people share and want to share entrepreneurism and the startup mindset 
with you.
Finally, we’ll swing back to take a look at two big IT evangelism com-
panies that have programs that merit your serious consideration: Microsoft 
BizSpark and Sun Startup Essentials.
One interesting thing about the tools and applications mentioned in 
this chapter is that few of them existed two or three years ago. The tools 
and services and, above all, the social groups of and by startups you’ll find 
here are part of the explosive growth of what I like to call the Startup 
Community. Only a few years ago, being a startup was much more of a 
lonely calling.
Tools for Startups
One of the nice things about doing a startup today as opposed to, say 
three years ago is the number of other startups and small software vendors 
who offer great tools you can buy or subscribe to instead of build. In this 
section, we’ll take a look at 16 of them, starting with three tools for keeping 
your most valuable startup asset—your codebase—safe and secure.

Solid, offsite, robust code version control is a must-have for a startup. 
Whether or not you know and love what version control can do for you, 
this is simply something that needs to be done right.
GitHub
What it is: A combination Git-centric version control system for both 
Open Source and proprietary projects and a growing social network for 
programmers (80,000 as of May 2009).
URL: http://github.com (Figure 4-1)
What it costs: Free to $200/month; the Small ($12/month) and 
Medium ($22/month) plans should fit the needs of most startups in terms 
of private repositories (10 or 20) and private collaborators (5 or 10).

Figure 4-1. GitHub
Special mojo/shiny goodness: Since its launch in July 2008, GitHub 
has rapidly become the preferred repo site for the Ruby on Rails commu-
nity. Git, a distributed version control system written largely by Linux 
creator Linus Torvalds in 2005 because he was dissatisfied with other 
Open Source options such as Subversion and BitKeeper, has been winning 
over developers, especially from the more obtuse Subversion system.
GitHub is now the home of a growing list of major Ruby and non-Ruby 
Open Source projects, including Capistrano, Haml, JUnit, MooTools, 
Prototype, YUI, and Perl.
Why you should know about it: If your startup is using Ruby on Rails 
or Perl, you probably already know about GitHub as a source for Open 
Source code. GitHub makes Open Source’s fork-and-extend legal capability a 
practical reality. Over and over at GitHub you’ll find forks of useful Open 
Source projects that add value while maintaining a clean connection to 
their original project.

The other kind of repositories—private, SSL-secure repositories—are 
something you really want to be using day to day; with GitHub, that’s as 
easy as typing Git push origin master.
But how secure is your private code? After all, your codebase is the 
core of your business. Here’s an illuminating exchange between Chris 
Wanstrath, one of GitHub’s cofounders, and a startup about the startup’s 
concerns: “As a startup, what assurances would we have that hosting our 
code (which is also our IP and represents almost our entire company 
value) as a private repo on GitHub will work for us?” wrote Bradley Wright 
in the GitHub Google Group.1 “Do GitHub employees have access to pri-
vate repos, for example? What kind of security is in place for private 
repos?”
Wanstrath replied, “We only access your repositories to help with sup-
port issues. Both GitHub and Engine Yard are very serious about security. 
It’s something we worry about and constantly try to improve. We even 
have a security expert on retainer who has helped us out with issues in the 
past. I consider this one of the benefits of choosing GitHub over self-host-
ing—is security as high a priority on your internal network?”
Overall, I think the advantages of having a secure, offsite private code 
repository with a company outweigh the benefits of and is more secure 
than diverting time to a DIY system.
Unfuddle
What it is: Subversion and Git repository plus project management.
URL: http://unfuddle.com (Figure 4-2)
What it costs: Free to $99/month, with either the Micro ($9/month) 
or Compact ($24/month) plan looking good for a startup.
Special mojo/shiny goodness: I had originally planned to include 
Unfuddle because it seems to be a good offsite Subversion service for 
developers who still prefer Subversion; then they added Git, making it a 
good alternative for those who don’t want to go with GitHub. But Unfud-
dle is more than an offsite repo—it provides a solid, if basic, set of project 
management tools, including messaging between developers within a 
project, creating bug/feature tickets, setting milestones, and more—all 
nicely arranged/accessible in a project dashboard.
Why you should know about it: If you’re using Subversion (or Git) 
and you also want a core set of software project management functionality, 
Unfuddle is my recommendation.

SourceGear Vault
What it is: Proprietary version control system primarily for Microsoft-
centric codebases.
URL: http://www.sourcegear.com/vault (Figure 4-3)
What it costs: Free for a single developer, $249 per developer, $299 
with product maintenance. If your startup has more than one developer, 
you’ll need a paid-for license for each developer.
Special mojo/shiny goodness: Vault has become the de facto version 
control system for .NET developers. Microsoft’s version control system, 
SourceSafe, wandered off the development field years ago and has not 
been heard from since. Vault integrates into Visual Studio (and Eclipse 
and Dreamweaver too) and has proven rock solid, and SourceGear pro-
vides excellent support for Vault and its other products.

  Tools and Groups for Startups
104
Figure 4-3. SourceGear Vault
Why you should know about it: If you are beginning to wonder 
whether I am obsessed with version control systems and protecting your 
codebase, you’re right. I know of at least three instances—including my 
first microISV product—that either were put out of business or came 
within a hair of that fate because they mismanaged their codebase. If you 
want to be taken seriously as a startup, you need to protect your code.
Customer/Beta Tester Feedback
Our next five tools for startups get at what people online think about 
your product or service. If you wander down the halls of any major com-
pany, you’ll hear terms such as focus group and consumer research and 
customer survey. That’s because these businesses understand how impor-
tant it is to know what their customers and prospective customers are 
thinking about. For startups, it’s not important—it’s vital.
Feedback from your beta testers and, later, your customers is the life-
blood of your startup. Without it, you have no real idea of whether your 
product or service is on target, what your next release should focus on, 
what customers are saying—or want to say—about your app.

  Tools and Groups for Startups
105
In the online marketplace, conversing with your customers is increas-
ingly a necessity rather than an option as company after company wises 
up that markets are conversations, not monologues. Here’s a small selec-
tion of tools to help you reach out and connect to your customers and 
beta testers.
SurveyMonkey.com
What it is: Free to low-cost online survey design, implementation, and 
analysis.
URL: http://www.surveymonkey.com (Figure 4-4)
Figure 4-4. SurveyMonkey.com
What it costs: Free for up to 10 questions in a survey and 100 responses; 
Monthly Pro (19.95/month) plan allows 1,000 responses per month, while 
the Annual Pro ($200/year) is unlimited.
Special mojo/shiny goodness: SurveyMonkey is a well-thought-out, 
well-designed service that guides you though designing a survey—20 
different question types you can drop in any one of 50 themed survey tem-
plates. All you need to do to get the survey to your desired audience is to 
provide them with the custom SurveyMonkey link; or, if you feel you must, 
you can present a survey as a pop-up on your site.
The analytical features do more than get the job done; you can browse 
individual responses, publish results, filter and cross-tab responses, or 
download raw data or nicely arranged PDF summaries.
Why you should know about it: Whether it’s sending a quick survey 
to your beta testers that they will actually complete, asking recent custom-

  Tools and Groups for Startups
106
ers what brought them to your doorstep, or finding out what people really 
think of the customer support you’re providing, SurveyMonkey.com makes 
getting this kind of feedback quick and easy—and therefore something 
your startup is more likely to do.
PollDaddy
What it is: Create quick, targeted polls.
URL: http://www.polldaddy.com (Figure 4-5)
Figure 4-5. A PollDaddy poll in the wild
What it costs: Free, if you don’t mind a built-in link back to PollDaddy; 
$200/year to remove the link.
Special mojo/shiny goodness: Surveys are good when you have an 
existing connection to those being surveyed, who therefore they will take 
the time to answer it. But what if you don’t? Another way to go is to 
embed a quick snap poll—one question, a set of answers for the respon-
dent to pick from—right where you need it in your site or blog. Although 
PollDaddy now offers surveys, it’s these quick embeddable polls I like.
Since PollDaddy is owned by Automattic, the creators of WordPress, 
integration with WordPress-hosted and stand-alone blogs is extremely 
easy. For example, Figure 4-5 shows a poll I created in under 5 minutes for 
the Startup Success Podcast.2 Here’s the entire HTML content of that 
post: [polldaddy poll="1462723"]. Now that’s easy!
2  http://startuppodcast.wordpress.com;on iTunes, just search the iTunes Store for “startup.”

  Tools and Groups for Startups
107
Why you should know about it: Getting feedback from your commu-
nity is not a one-shot deal: the more times and ways you ask them, the 
better, and the better the quality and quantity of information. PollDaddy 
works especially well for communicating with readers of your startup’s blog.
CrazyEgg
What it is: Site analytics that really work.
URL: http://crazyegg.com (Figure 4-6)
Figure 4-6. CrazyEgg’s Confetti view
What it costs: From $9/month to track 10,000 visits to your site and 
10 pages up to $99/month to track 250,000 visits/100 pages. The Standard 
($19/month—25,000 visits on 20 pages) would seem a good fit.
Special mojo/shiny goodness: Unlike, say, Google Analytics, the 
beauty of CrazyEgg is that it shows you visually exactly where people are 
clicking on a given page, by overlaying on the page for you either a heat 

  Tools and Groups for Startups
108
map or aggregated click counts or actual clicks that can each display 
more information. Stats are one thing—and CrazyEgg does that as well—
but, at least for me, being able to see the page and to see where people are 
clicking makes it easier to comprehend what’s working and what’s not.
Why you should know about it: CrazyEgg is a very cool way to find 
out what’s working on your site and what’s not—quickly. You can invest 
untold hours into analyzing your server logs and you won’t get the same 
actionable knowledge that a single glance at a CrazyEgg-monitored page 
will show you.
UserVoice
What it is: In-site customer feedback.
URL: http://uservoice.com (Figure 4-7)
Figure 4-7. UserVoice at work
What it costs: From free for a single site recording up to 500 votes 
(see below) up to $589/month for unlimited sites and 25,000 votes.

  Tools and Groups for Startups
109
Special mojo/shiny goodness: UserVoice is all about giving your 
site’s visitors a dirt easy means to provide you feedback on your site or 
service, and giving you a structured process for marshalling that feedback, 
muffling too-vocal users and focusing that feedback into useful channels.
On a UserVoice-enabled site, such as http://47hats.com, visitors see 
a small tab on the right or left margin. When they click this tab, they see 
a JavaScript widget with the five top vote-receiving ideas at your UserVoice 
Feedback Forum, as shown in Figure 4-7.
The fun begins when they click on one of the ideas or go to Feedback 
Forum, where they can “spend” their 10 votes voting up various ideas. For 
ideas, substitute possible product or service enhancements, features to be 
added to you startup’s iPhone app, or whatever you need structured feed-
back for in the form of votes and comments.
Why you should know about it: UserVoice is by turns instant market 
research tool, future feature prioritizer, bug reporter, and suggestions 
and comments tool. By separating bug reports from voting on ideas for 
your software, you make for a much more manageable flow of information 
from customers. Since each person is limited to 10 votes, you’re less likely 
to have your feature priority list set by “loud” customers and more likely 
to spot ideas for your product or service that have broad appeal. And 
because you can set the status of each idea and each comment on it, you 
can fine-tune your customers’ expectations.
I interviewed Richard White, the founder of UserVoice.com, for the 
Startup Success Podcast. To understand more behind Richard’s extremely 
well-thought-out Web 2.0 approach to feedback, give it a listen.3
Get Satisfaction
What it is: Web 2.0/social network customer support.
URL: http://getsatisfaction.com (Figure 4-8)
What it costs: The free account is good for up to a thousand visitors 
per month; above that the Basic account (ad-free, with support for up to 
10 moderators from your startup) costs $149 a month. They also have a 
Starter Package that makes sense for a startup: 1 moderator and 1,000 
visitors a month.4

Figure 4-8. Get Satisfaction
Special mojo/shiny goodness: Get Satisfaction is all about disrupt-
ing the old approach to customer support that we all know and hate: 
either calling the company and getting connected to someone who can 
provide only scripted answers to stock questions or, worse, being directed 
to an “Advanced Web Forum,” where you are invited to waste the rest of 
your life reading through unanswered posts. “We realized that if you could 
reimagine customer support as a community conversation between users 
and the company,” Lane Becker, one of the founders of Get Satisfaction, 
told Apple,5 “rather than as an overloaded and understaffed call center, all 
sorts of good things will happen.”
Get Satisfaction is crowd-driven support—you can set up a forum about 
a company whether or not that company wants to participate. Given that, 
it makes sense, once you release, to get into this particular conversation 
by claiming your forum and having one or more people in your startup 
moderate it.

Why you should know about it: Nothing is perfect in this world—
including your startup. You are going to need to provide customer sup-
port—and, if done right, it can improve your startup’s online reputation. 
By turning customer support into online conversation you get happier 
customers, better feedback, and crowd-donated technical support.
Looking Good/Going Video
Next we have two graphic-related tools you should know about, because, 
let’s face it, most software developers suck at graphic art and web site 
visual “stuff.”
As developers, we tend to underestimate, even denigrate, how impor-
tant good visual presentation is to most people. Simply put, for most 
people ugly equals avoid. A good logo is the start of your visual presenta-
tion. It shapes the visual architecture, even the culture of your company.
As for video, this is a medium you’ll want to tap as you explain and 
present the value of your software, the kind of experience people are in 
for. Screencasts6 are a very effective way to make your case. But more 
than that, video is now, for some purposes, the best way to communicate 
online.
99designs
What it is: Crowd-sourced logo design.
URL: http://99designs.com (Figure 4-9)
What it costs: This costs $39 for the contest process and then what-
ever amount you set, generally between $100 and $600.
Special mojo/shiny goodness: 99designs works thusly: You describe 
what your logo should be and post it at site—that’s where the $39 goes. 
When you post, you set what you will pay for the winning logo entry. Then 
graphic designers get to work. Lots of graphic designers—over 30,000 
designers are 99designs members, any number of whom can decide to try 
their hand at your logo. For example, one of the most popular design con-
tests at the site today had 365 entries. That’s a lot of custom logos to 
choose from. And all of it is public, so you can get further ideas for your 
branding.
6  You might want to listen to Show #21 (“The Art and Science of Screencasts”) at the Startup Suc-
cess Podcast. Pat Foley and I got a detailed crash course in doing screencasts right from Ian Ozsvald of 
ProCasts (http://startuppodcast.wordpress.com/2009/04/04/show-21-the-art-and-
science-of-screencasts).

  Tools and Groups for Startups
112
Figure 4-9. 99designs
Why you should know about it: You’re not a real startup until you 
have a real logo, something that doesn’t look like it crawled out of Microsoft 
Word’s clip art folder. But good graphic designs can take weeks and 
thousands of dollars. What you need is something good enough, fast, and 
relatively cheap. 99designs fills the bill. And because you pick the winning 
design from dozens of entries, you get a logo you like, or at least one you 
can live with until your Series A funding arrives.

Jing
What it is: Screenshot  and video capture for Windows and Macs.
URL: http://www.jingproject.com/ (Figure 4-10)
Figure 4-10. Jing
What it costs: Free, or for $14.95 a year you can acquire Pro, which 
handles MPEG-4, one-button YouTube upload and brand-free videos.
Special mojo/shiny goodness: Jing makes easy the capturing to 
video of what’s on your screen and sharing it with another developer, a 
customer needing support, or the world. Sometimes a minute-long video 
will calm a customer, explain a programming problem, or entice an inves-
tor when words simply would not get the job done. Although other tools, 
notably Jing’s “big brother,” Camtasia Studio, have editing capabilities 
you’ll need to create more formal videos, such as product screencasts, 
Jing—with its abilities to capture both video and what you have to say, to 

  Tools and Groups for Startups
114
automatically upload it to TechSmith’s Screencast.com, and to stick a 
URL on your clipboard—is a tool you will not want to be without.
Why you should know about it: Jing adds to your problem-solving 
arsenal instant video screen capture with audio. That’s a powerful tool in 
all sorts of situations when you want to communicate with one or many 
other people quickly, informally, and simply. I’ve found Jing to be a far 
better way to provide tech support to users of my various apps than dreary 
multistep instructions. And it’s faster.
Testing Your Site and Your Software
How are you going to test your site, especially if you’re startup is offering 
a web-based service? Are you going to dodge doing this because you are 
afraid that your site will turn to mush in Internet Explorer or crumble 
under the load of a real bunch of customers?
And what about usability—the novel concept that unless people under-
stand your web app they are not going to buy it? Here are three tools 
whose value far outweighs their costs—especially the cost of not doing 
the testing you should be doing in the first place.
Browsershots
What it is: Takes screenshots of how your site renders in different 
browsers—lots of browsers.
URL: http://browsershots.org or http://browsershots.org/
priority (Figure 4-11)
What it costs: Free, if you can handle the ads and the wait; $29.95/
month for ad-free and fast.7
Special mojo/shiny goodness: Sure, your web app might look great 
in the latest Firefox on your dev machine. But how about IE 5.5, Opera 9.
62, Google Chrome 2.0, or Safari 3.2? Feed Browsershots a URL, decide if 
you want it with or without JavaScript, Flash, or other goodies, and pick 
as many browser/versions as you want.
Now, the free version will take its own sweet time rendering and then 
saving in jpeg format what your designated page looks like in each browser. 
But the paid-for version is a fast 30 to 50 screenshots within 2 to 5 minutes, 
and they don’t get publically displayed.
Why you should know about it: This is a classic example of a some-
thing far cheaper to buy than to build, with the added goodness that you 
7  http://browsershots.org/priority

  Tools and Groups for Startups

don’t have to keep track of new browser versions on other platforms (you’ve 
got enough on your plate).
Figure 4-11. Browsershots
BrowserMob
What it is: On-demand, low-cost load testing with real browsers.
URL: http://browsermob.com/load-testing (Figure 4-12)
What it costs: BrowserMob offers two kinds of testing: Simulated 
HTTP traffic for $.20 hour per virtual user, and web traffic generated by 
what BrowserMob calls Real Browser Users for $2 per browser per hour—
actual Firefox browsers running on E2C Amazon Web Services virtual 
servers.
Special mojo/shiny goodness: BrowserMob lets you set up Selenium 
test scripts to record the interactions you want to scale out—and they can 
be as simple or as complex as you wish to make them. Traditional load-
testing tools aren’t up to the task of dealing with a typical Web 2.0 Ajax-
enabled web app without a great deal of work, work that’s hard to modify 
if your site changes and you need to modify your tests.

  Tools and Groups for Startups
116
Figure 4-12. BrowserMob
Why you should know about it: Would you rather find out now that 
your web app can’t handle 3,000 users without crumbling or wait until 
after you launch and have 3,000 users? How about that new build with all 
the new functionality? What happens to your customers when it starts 
seeing significant traffic? BrowserMob is much better than simple http 
traffic testing, and it’s much cheaper than non-AWS-powered testing 
services.

UserTesting.com
What it is: Structured usability testing at dirt-cheap prices.
URL: http://www.usertesting.com (Figure 4-13)
Figure 4-13. UserTesting.com
What it costs: $19 per usability test.
Special mojo/shiny goodness: User testing is the acid test for apps. 
That’s where someone who’s never seen your pride and joy, let alone written 
it, uses your application. Traditional user testing, complete with video 
camera mounted behind one-way mirrors, runs hundreds of dollars per 
test. With UserTesting, you fill in a form with your URL, indicate what 
tasks you want them to perform, such as sign up with your service and cre-
ate a user profile, select how many testers you want, choose what, if any, 
demographic (gender, age, annual household income, computer/web 
expertise), and pay your money, and you’ll get back both a Flash movie 

  Tools and Groups for Startups
118
of exactly what each user did on your site (with commentary) for about a 
15-minute period and a written report.
Why you should know about it: There is simply no substitute for see-
ing how a first-time user of your site or service reacts. You can’t do it 
yourself—you know too much, you’ve already internalized the model of 
reality your software uses. You can get friends, buddies, people off the 
street—but how are you going to record and study their interaction with 
your app? UserTesting’s crowd-sourced approach makes user testing a 
reality for startups.
uTest
What it is: Crowd-sourced functional testing.
URL: http://www.uTest.com (Figure 4-14)
Figure 4-14. uTest.com
What it costs: Variable, but $1,500 or so is a good rough estimate.
Special mojo/shiny goodness: Which would you as a CEO rather do: 
hire a couple of testers who will be idle a good deal of the time and quickly 
become stale from looking at the same screens over and over, or put your 
app in front of over 15,000 testers who will race to find new and clever 
ways to be first to break your build? Hint: the latter.
That’s what uTest is all about: a paid-for-performance online commu-
nity of software testers who make money and have fun scouring your 

  Tools and Groups for Startups
119
software. You have a lot of control over who tests what at uTest—this is 
not offshored functional testing.
Why you should know about it: Structuring functional testing as 
uTest has means lower cost for you per detected bug and a constant new 
mix of people available to test with fresh eyes and speed—you can start a 
test cycle late Friday and have it done by Monday.9
Subscription Startup Communities
Next up are two subscription-based communities expressly for developers 
who want to start their own software companies and are looking for “one-
stop shops” (other than this book) for the knowledge they need. Warning! 
One of these is my startup, StartupToDo.com. Obviously I’m nothing like 
objective about it. On the other hand, a lot of startup founders have used 
it to save countless hours by not having to reinvent the wheels their 
startups need.
The Six Figure Software Micropreneur Academy
What it is: Online training for developers who want to become “Micro-
preneurs”—one-person software companies
URL: http://www.sixfiguresoftware.com
What it costs: $97 a month.
Special mojo/shiny goodness: Rob Walling—the founder of The Six 
Figure Software Micropreneur Academy—is a successful microISV and 
blogger who’s passionate about helping other developers launch their own 
software businesses. Within The Micropreneur Academy, Rob has created a 
set of seven instruction modules (see the upcoming sidebar for a sample) 
that provide highly practical information on creating a solo software 
company.
“I realized there’s a small amount of real information on the subject 
of one-person companies, and even less is focused on things that matter 
to us as software developers/entrepreneurs,” Rob told me. “The problem 
is that nearly every entrepreneurial book or blog is aimed at starting 
either a retail store, a consulting firm, or a high-growth startup. And 
many of the resources that address one-person entrepreneurship (what I 
call Micropreneurship) are heavy on theory and light on practical steps.”

Figure 4-15. The Micropreneur Academy
Why a paid site? “Since the Academy is a membership site, it allows 
for high-quality, detailed information presented in multiple formats, with 
the positive side effect of a private community of committed Micropre-
neurs,” Rob added.
Why you should know about it: Resources for creating a solo soft-
ware company are few and far between; you’ll find more info out there 
about starting a dry cleaner. While I obviously think this book and the 
next tool are very helpful, The Micropreneur Academy is a valuable resource, 
will suit some people better, and adds to your ammo for starting a microISV.
Rob Walling, The Micropreneur Academy
With Rob’s kind permission, I’ve reprinted here one of the topics from 
Module 1: Introduction to Micropreneurship—Changing Your Time Mindset.
Lesson 1.4—Changing Your Time Mindset
It’s a big leap moving from employee to Micropreneur. One of the biggest 
adjustments is accepting that time is your most precious commodity.
Dollarizing
The phrase dollarize is used in sales to describe the approach of showing 
your prospect how your price is less expensive than your competition due 
to the amount of money they will save in the long run.

  Tools and Groups for Startups
121
For example, you can dollarize a screw by showing how your deliveries are 
always on time, your defect rate is half that of your competitors, and your 
screws can withstand an additional 500 lb of stress, each resulting in time 
saved in material handling and warranty calls.
If you take it a step further and you possess the appropriate data, you can 
approximate how much money your screws will save your prospect in a 
given year based on the number of times your competitors deliver late and 
how many defects they will avoid by using your screws.
It’s a powerful technique and a way to turn an otherwise commodity 
purchase into a bottom-line savings.
Dollarizing Your Time
In the same vein, dollarizing your time is the idea of putting a theoretical 
dollar amount on each hour you work. If you value your time at $100 per 
hour, it makes certain decisions, such as outsourcing work to a $6/hour 
virtual assistant, a no-brainer.
Putting a value on your time is a foundational step in becoming a Micropreneur, 
and it’s a step many entrepreneurs never take. Skipping this step can result 
in late nights performing menial tasks you should be outsourcing. It’s one of 
the reasons most MicroISV owners earn less than $25/hour.
It never seems like a good idea to pay someone out of your own pocket for 
something you can do yourself . . . until you realize the economics of the 
situation.
Approaches to Dollarizing Your Time
There are two approaches to dollarizing your time. Choose the one that 
makes the most sense for your situation.
Approach #1: Freelance Rates
If you are a freelance developer or consultant, you probably have an hourly 
rate. This is a good way to begin dollarizing your time. If you bill clients 
$60/hour, then an hour of your time is worth $60.
If you don’t perform freelance work, do a search on Craigslist or Guru for 
freelancers in your local area with similar skills. As a developer with a few 
years of experience you’ll likely see rates in the $40 and up range. Frankly, if 
you have no other information, $50/hour is a good number to start with.
Approach #2: Salary
If you don’t perform freelance work or have difficulty finding comparative 
freelancers online, another approach is to divide your current salary + benefits 
by 2,000 (the approximate number of hours worked in a year), rounded up 
to the nearest $5 increment.
It varies widely, but a typical benefits package, including 401k matching, disability 
insurance, health care, and time off, can range from 20% to 45% of your salary. 
You can come close to determining the real dollar amount using your pay 
stub and a bit of math, but if you just want to take a swing at it use 30%.

122
So if your salary is $60,000 per year, 30% of that is an additional $18,000, 
making your effective salary $78,000. $78,000 divided by 2,000 gives you an 
hourly rate of approximately $39/hour, or $40/hour when rounded.
Be aware that freelance rates are nearly always higher than salaried rates 
because freelancers spend a portion of their time on nonbillable tasks such 
as invoicing, marketing, sales, etc., so they have to increase their billable rate 
to make up for these nonbillable hours.
Ultimately it’s up to you, but I would tend toward using the higher freelance 
rate for your time, especially since it’s closer to what you would receive on 
the open market if you chose to pursue freelance work.
Keep in Mind: Desired Earnings
Realizing your time is worth $50/hour is the first step; the next step is actually 
generating $50 for every hour you work, and the third step is figuring out 
how to make your time worth $75 or $100/hour. If you continue to think 
your time is worth $50/hour, it will to stay at $50/hour.
$100/hour is a good long-term goal to shoot for. If you’ve done your research 
on one-person software companies, the reality for most tends to be closer 
to $25/hour.
If you are making $25/hour as a Micropreneur, you are doing something wrong. 
Improve your marketing, grow your sales, find a new niche, outsource, and 
automate. $25/hour is not, in my opinion, an acceptable dollarized rate for a 
successful Micropreneur.
While you won’t be earning anywhere near $50/hour when you begin building 
your product, once you launch you should aim to hit that number within six 
months. In the early stages your dollarized rate is a mental state, but you 
want to make it a reality as soon as possible and increase it from there.
Realizations
Several realizations stem from dollarizing your time.
Realization #1: Outsourcing Is a Bargain
Once you’ve established you’re worth $50/hour, paying someone $6/hour 
to handle administrative tasks or $15/hour to write code seems like a trip to 
the dollar store.
Outsourcing some aspects of your business is the single most powerful 
approach I’ve seen to increasing your true hourly rate as a Micropreneur. 
If I didn’t outsource my administrative tasks, my true hourly rate would 
plummet.
Instead, outsourcing provides me with 20–60 additional hours each month 
that I can use to market a new product, improve marketing campaigns on 
existing products, or spend with my family.
The first two will bring more revenue in future months; the latter is invalu-
able to my lifestyle.

Realization #2: Keep Work and Play Separate
Wasting time is bad. Boring movies, bad TV, and pointless web surfing are 
expensive propositions. If you aren’t enjoying something, stop doing it.
Last night, in fact, a group of friends came over to watch a movie and about 
30 minutes in I fell asleep. I woke up after a while and, realizing I wasn’t enjoying 
the film, retired to my room and went to sleep. It occurred to me that watching 
the film was less important than being alert and productive the next day.
These are the judgment calls you have to make every time you start a movie, 
book, or TV show.
I need to reiterate here: I’m not saying you should never relax, have fun, 
watch movies, play with your kids, watch TV, or surf the Web. I’m saying 
that you should be deliberate about your work and your free time and get 
the maximum benefit from both. In other words,
Work hard and play hard, but never do both at once.
Numerous times throughout the day I ask myself:
At this very moment am I making progress toward crossing off a to-do, or am I 
relaxing and reenergizing?
If I’m doing neither, I evaluate the situation and change it.
If you aren’t enjoying a movie, walk out.
If you’re playing with your kids and working on your iPhone, you’re not 
really working or playing—you’re doing both poorly. Put the iPhone away 
and focus on your kids; it will shock you how much more fun you have and 
how, after making this choice, you’ll feel energized and ready to dive back 
into work.
The same goes for multitasking work in front of the TV. This used to be my 
standard mode of operation, but about a year ago I realized my productivity 
level is around 50% when I’m trying to do both, and once the evening is done 
I feel as if I worked the whole night (but didn’t get much done).
In other words, I don’t receive the benefit of being productive or feeling 
relaxed. It’s the worst of both worlds and something I’ve curtailed almost 
entirely.
Realization #3: Waiting Is Bad
If your time is worth, say, $75/hour, standing in line at the bank is painful. 
Sitting in traffic is another money waster—every nonproductive, nonleisure 
minute you spend is another $1.25 down the drain.
Since it’s not practical to assume you will never wait in line again, the best 
counterattack I’ve found is having a notebook and pen handy at all times and 
using this time for high-level thinking, something I have a hard time doing in 
front of a computer.

  Tools and Groups for Startups
124
It’s amazing that most of us think we can remember our important thoughts. 
Due to the amount of information and chaos you consume each day, a thought 
stays in your head for a few seconds before it disappears. Perhaps you will 
think of it again, perhaps not. Writing down important ideas is critical to 
building a list of ways to improve your business.
I’ve had some amazing insights while in line at the post office.
For years I’ve carried a notebook everywhere I go, for this exact purpose. I 
use it to capture keyword ideas, product ideas, niche ideas, to-do’s, and any 
other valuable information that surfaces.
The best system I’ve found to manage it is to maintain three discrete lists:
■Personal to-dos
■Long-term work to-dos
■Short-term work to-dos (things to be done this week)
This allows me to think both short- and long-term and to easily capture big-
picture ideas without cluttering my day-to-day to-do list with things I won’t 
be able to implement for six months.
Again, I’m not saying you should be working all the time—if you want to bring a 
magazine to read in line, by all means do it. If your mind needs to rest when 
you’re running errands, then use this as a time to reenergize so you can hit 
your work harder when you return to it.
The real statement here is that you should never find yourself killing time—
this is as close to a sin as it comes for a Micropreneur.
Realization #4: Information Consumption Is Only Good When It 
Produces Something
The following discussion excludes consumption for pleasure (reading a novel, 
watching John Stewart, catching a movie).
Consuming and synthesizing are very different things; it’s easy to consume in 
mass quantity. It’s much more difficult to synthesize information.
Have you ever read through an entire magazine only to realize you can’t 
remember anything specific about what you just read?
As someone who enjoys consuming in large quantities, at some point I real-
ized I was wasting an enormous amount of time. So I put the following into 
place:
When I’m reading blogs or books or listening to podcasts or audio books, I 
take action notes.
Action notes are short- or long-term to-do items that apply directly to my 
businesses.

  Tools and Groups for Startups
125
For example, I listen to several SEO podcasts. If they mention an interesting 
web site, I make a note to check it out the next time I’m able.
As they mention a new SEO technique, I create a specific to-do to try that 
approach on one of my web sites. I make the action note specific so I can act on 
it quickly the next time I have a few spare minutes. If I were to write something 
general like “Google Webmaster Tools,” it doesn’t help me. But if I write 
“Create Google Webmaster Tools Account for DotNetInvoice,” I can act on 
this quickly and cross it off my list without having to do much real thinking.
Action notes have allowed me to quickly determine which resources provide 
real value and which are fluff.
Since implementing action notes I’ve canceled two magazine subscriptions, 
removed 40+ blogs from my RSS reader, and have become choosy about the 
audio books I buy.
This approach provides me with real-time feedback on the value of any consum-
able. A $4.99 audio book is actually a cost if it chews up four hours of your 
time and provides no actionable items.
Your Assignment
1. Using one of the approaches described here, dollarize your time. Write 
that hourly rate on a Post-it, and stick it to your desk as a reminder.
2. Purchase a half-size notebook (Moleskines are pricey but durable) and 
a nice pen. Start your idea notebook the next time you feel like you’re 
killing time.
3. Make a list of day-to-day tasks you should outsource. You may not 
be able to offload everything at once, but start with the tasks that are 
easiest and cheapest to outsource and work your way up the list.
Begin taking action notes when you consume books, magazines, blogs, 
podcasts, and audio books. Start eliminating resources that don’t generate 
actionable items.

Figure 4-16. StartupToDo.com
Here’s a typical scenario. You have three hours right now to work on 
your startup. What are you going to do? Without StartupToDo.com, you’re 
likely to spend those three hours just Googling information, tips, and rec-
ommendations on, for example, how to set up your startup blog, and you 
will probably have nothing to show for your time. With StartupToDo.com, 
you can browse to the “Creating a self-hosted Startup Blog” Project, work 
through the 14 steps already defined (with eight comments from other 
startup founders), and have another part of the puzzle up and running.
Projects come with points, so you can measure your progress week to 
week and against other members, and there’s a quick and easy way to get 
confidential feedback on your site or web app from the StartupToDo.com 
community and other features designed to help you succeed faster.
Why you should know about it: Bootstrapping—building a startup 
while holding down a day job—is quite simply murder. Too much time gets 
wasted figuring out what to do; too little time is left for the actual doing. 
StartupToDo.com saves you huge amounts of time you’d otherwise spend 
figuring out what you need to do and finding information, tips, and recom-
mendations online. Especially for startups with one or a few founders, 
StartupToDo’s point system, peer comments, and groups feature mean 
you get the support, quality information, and metrics that you hunger for.
I hope you won’t mind the foregoing bit of shameless self-promotion: 
I’ve tried to treat my startup just as I have the other tools and services I’ve 
described in this chapter.
As a change of pace before we get into startup organizations, here’s 
an interview with one of the sharpest legal minds in the startup world.

  Tools and Groups for Startups
127
Gene Landy, IT/Digital Legal Companion Author 
and Attorney
Just exactly how can a startup incorporate Open Source into its product legally? 
You can spend the next three hours on the Web and hope that the people 
you read know what they are talking about, or you can read what Gene 
Landy, author of IT/Digital Legal Companion (Syngress, 2008) and respected 
startup attorney, has to say.
Keep in mind that, as with all legal advice, Gene’s answers deal with the general 
case. You should get good legal advice about the specifics of your startup’s 
use of Open Source code. But at least this should give you a solid grounding 
in the subject, and it won’t cost you $450 an hour. Thanks Gene!
Bob: Maybe the place to start is about Open Source and use thereof in startups.
Gene: OK. Well, the key to Open Source is to read the license. There is 
some subtlety in it, but basically there are just two broad varieties of licenses: 
those that allow you to do wherever you want as long as you give attribution.
Bob: For instance, MIT  (Massachusetts Institute of Technology)?
Gene: Yeah, MIT license is a pretty good example of that kind of license. 
BSD (Berkeley Software Distribution) license would be a good example for 
that kind of license. And they are very simple, and they basically say you give 
us copyright attribution and you repeat our licensure, you can do whatever 
you want, up to and including putting the software in your app and running 
the license you want.
Bob: OK.
Gene: Those licenses are pretty mild. They don’t really  interfere with you. 
They do require some disclosure, but otherwise they don’t really crimp 
your style very much. And there is an enormous amount of software that’s 
under that kind of license.
Bob: Now, does that apply to Open Source that you incorporate in a desktop 
commercial product or a web-based commercial product, or it doesn’t 
make a difference?
Gene: Well, it doesn’t make a difference. I mean if you take a product and 
you have a third of the code that is under the MIT license or the BSD license 
and other kind of non-copyleft kind of license, there is no reason why you 
can’t distribute it like any other piece of software. You are required to disclose 
and document the limitation, usually on disk, that these license codes are 
there. But you are not required to license the products, you are not required 
to make copies available, you are not required to disclose the source code. 
It is pretty user-friendly.
Bob: OK. Well, under what circumstance would using  Open Source code 
open your proprietary source code or give people that possibility?
Gene: Well, the places where that happens is where you have what is called 
a copyleft license, and the classic copyleft license is the GNU General Public 
License or the GPL or the LGPL. Those are the ones that have these copy-
left aspects that require you to use license and only that and require you to 
make source code available.

  Tools and Groups for Startups
128
So those licenses create a problem, because if you license that code and then 
you distribute that code inconsistently with that, you don’t have a proper 
license for the code that is in the product. It is not true that, although it is 
common misperception, if you didn’t know that kind of copyleft code and 
you include it in your product and distribute under a normal license, you 
sometimes are automatically required to disclose the source. That’s not really 
the problem. The problem is that you just don’t have a proper license 
because you have the code under a license that you didn’t comply with.
Bob: I see. So it doesn’t necessarily open up your code, but you have a 
problem because you haven’t got a proper license.
Gene: That’s right. You got a perfectly good license,  but it requires you to 
do things that you haven’t done, so therefore you haven’t met the condi-
tions in the license, so you don’t have a valid right to distribute it, so you give 
it to your customer, customer has got unlicensed code. Now, very often, 
quite frankly, most copyright owners in Open Source code don’t generally 
sue, even if their code is improperly distributed. Sometimes they do and 
sometimes they threaten to. It is not very common. So misuse of copyleft-
type code can expose you to enforcement actions by a copyright owner 
because you are distributing code in violation of the copyright and you don’t 
have a good license to do it.
Bob: What type of documentation should a startup keep on where it is 
getting its code? I mean is it just basically a list of the pieces of code with 
licenses?
Gene: Yeah, I mean I think the reality is—I guess that’s one problem that 
startups have is that you basically have to be able to show where every piece 
of your product came from. And you may not have to do that for your 
customers; they might not care, although you will probably sign an agree-
ment that says you have all rights.
And if you haven’t tracked where the software comes from, you may not 
know. But where it really comes into play is when you want to raise money 
and the investor does some due diligence or you want to sell the company 
and the buyer does due diligence as the buyer finds out your code. Then 
they will point and say, you don’t really own your software and I am not 
giving  you any funding.
Startup Organizations and Groups 
Online and Off
It used to be that if you wanted to find another person who was actually 
interested in starting his or her own software company and you didn’t live 
between San Francisco and San Jose, California, you were out of luck. 
The odds were just not in your favor of finding other, like-minded people.

  Tools and Groups for Startups
129
That was then (prior to this century), this is now, and now there are 
literally hundreds of organizations, events, associations, and conferences 
by, for, and of startups, all over the world as well as online. In this section, 
we’re going to take a quick tour of just some of them. No matter how com-
fortable you are working alone, networking professionally and socially 
with people who understand and share your values and passions is a very 
cool thing and well worth getting away from your computer on occasion. 
Moreover, getting connected to—and perhaps funding from—angel inves-
tors and VCs is very much a face-to-face, offline social networking thing: it 
behooves you to get out, get known, make acquaintances, and friends in 
the greater Startup World.
College Entrepreneurial Groups
First off, if you’re still in college (and you don’t want to waste a decade or 
more as some of us have before answering our inner entrepreneurial 
imperative), check out whether your school has something like Stanford 
University’s BASES—Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial 
Students.
BASES (http://bases.stanford.edu/) is one of the largest student-
run entrepreneurship organizations in the United States, with over 5,000 
active/alumni members. It’s all about the entrepreneurial approach to 
business, and, being at Stanford in the heart of Silicon Valley,10 it has a 
strong IT bent.
Besides workshops and seminars sprinkled throughout the school 
year, one of BASES biggest activities is the E-Challenge, where teams cre-
ate and present business plans for both cash prizes ($50,000 is in the pot) 
and face-to-face time with VCs who just might fund them.
I happened to bump into Alvin Tse, the current vice president of 
E-Challenge, at another startup event (see Startup2Startup at http://
Startup2Startup.com) and he clued me in on what this—and similar stu-
dent-led groups at schools such as Wharton and Harvard—are all about 
today. “I think BASES provides them some fundamentals frameworks of 
starting up as BASES organize a lot of panels and workshops throughout 
the year. Also, joining BASES allows you to mix with like-minded entrepre-
neurial students.”
What’s it like to be in BASES? “Being in BASES means different 
things to different people,” Alvin replied. “For general members, being in 
10 Some would say Stanford is the heart of Silicon Valley, given how many companies (notably Google) 
draw their DNA from it.

  Tools and Groups for Startups
130
BASES means signing up on mailing lists, going to the workshops. But for 
us executive members, being in BASES means being leaders in the entre-
preneurial community at Stanford and educating students who have 
interests in doing startups.”
Colleges are all about passing along and exploring ideas—and one 
idea that has caught fire and planted roots is that going startup can be a 
lot more lucrative and fulfilling than going to work for existing companies.
Startup Groups
But what if you’re out of college and still want to mingle with fellow 
would-be founders? Then there’s various startup-centric groups out there 
such as Startup2Startup and Women 2.0.
Each month, Startup2Startup (Figure 4-17) hosts a dinner meeting 
for startups and VCs. Each dinner has a speaker who talks on a subject in 
which startups are interested—for example, in January 2009 when I 
attended, Amy Jo Kim, the cofounder/CEO at ShuffleBrain, a startup 
building games for social networks and an internationally recognized 
expert on online community architecture and game mechanics, spoke on 
how nongame startups can tap these techniques to improve their software 
and get more customers. Interesting stuff indeed!
However, the real action is the interaction between representatives of 
some of the leading VC firms in Silicon Valley and founders looking to 
make that first key contact with the money people. The organizers of 
Startup2Startup—Dave McClure, who’s been by turns developer, startup, 
and angel investor and who now runs a seed-stage investment program for 
Founders Fund, a VC group run by several of the founders of PayPal—and 
Leonard Speiser, entrepreneur-in-residence at the VC firm Trinity Ven-
tures—have the star power in Silicon Valley to ensure that each dinner 
table of eight has at least one VC who is ready, willing, and talking to the 
assembled hopefuls.
Another startup organization that’s building a positive reputation for 
itself is Women 2.0 (Figure 4-18). Their About page explains the mission 
of the group: “As young women with world-changing aspirations, we rec-
ognize entrepreneurship as the means to fulfill our life goals. After attending 
numerous local networking events for entrepreneurs in the Silicon Valley, 
we asked ‘Where are all the women in the Silicon Valley?’”
Women 2.0 puts on an impressive number of events: from Girl Geek 
Dinners to Women 2.0 Startup Competition to workshops with successful 
women executives, VCs, and entrepreneurs.

Shaherose Charania, a founder of Women 2.0 and its general manager, 
shared with me why Women 2.0 is needed and her perspective from inside 
the Startup Culture.
Shaherose Charania, Women 2.0
Working days as product manager at the entertainment startup Talenthouse 
and nights at both Women 2.0–sponsored events and other startup events 
in Silicon Valley, Shaherose is both a Silicon Valley insider and a person striving 
passionately to open up and diversify “the Valley” and the IT industry. For 
more information on Women 2.0’s many activities, check their website at 
http://women2.org.
Bob: What is Women 2.0, and why is it needed?
Shaherose: Women 2.0 is committed to increasing the number of women 
entrepreneurs starting high-growth ventures by providing the resources, 
network, and knowledge for the launch and growth of their company.
Our vision is to be a catalyst for change, mobilizing a global community of 
ambitious women entrepreneurs seeking to advance the world through 
technology.
We host networking events, workshops, VC Roundtables, and an annual 
startup competition to support entrepreneurs in the idea stage as well as 
entrepreneurs in early stage of launch—beta stage.
Why Women 2.0? There are less than 5% of women in technology startups 
at the cofounder or CxO level, and we believe there is no reason for this to 
be so low. With education, role models, and inspiration, women who are 
meant to be entrepreneurs should embrace this life path, and we hope to 
support them in the journey to succeed.
Bob: Does the startup economy offer more or less opportunity for women 
to succeed?
Shaherose: Startups offer a set of opportunities that a corporate environ-
ment or small business does not offer—not just for women, but for anyone 
in the startup economy.
This is an article we wrote about why startups are a great place to work: 
http://www.oreillynet.com/pub/a/womenintech/2007/09/20/
tech-startups-a-safe-bet.html
Bob: Silicon Valley for decades has had its “old boys network” of entrepre-
neurs/VCs and others. Should women seek to become part of that, or should 
they create their own network or something else entirely?
Shaherose: Women 2.0 doesn’t believe in building anything exclusive but, 
rather, adding to the existing entrepreneurial environment. Our events include 
experienced entrepreneurs and investors, male and female. If we build an 
exclusive network, it limits the value that can be shared and created. We 
envision a day when the Silicon Valley network comprises a near-equal number 
of males and females through our networking events, startup competition, 
and educational programs.

133
Bob: Has Silicon Valley and the startup economy (not necessarily the same 
thing) become more diverse/distributed?
Shaherose: Yes—Silicon Valley is no longer the only hub of innovation. 
The following trends contribute to the distribution of the startup economy 
beyond silicon valley:
1. Reverse migration: In 2005, 52% of Silicon Valley startups were immi-
grant founded, but now more and more skilled immigrant workers are 
returning home as immigration to the United States becomes more 
difficult and their home countries offer opportunities to innovate.
2. New startup hubs: We find new hubs for startups, such as Colorado, 
Seattle, Bangalore, Hyderabad, Boston—all offer a pool of technical 
talent, government support, and infrastructure and some access to 
funding.
Bob: As someone who knows a lot of startups, what do you see as the key 
factors for a startup’s success?
Shaherose: The people: What skills do they offer to the venture/idea?
The relationships: Do the founders of the company have an open, trusting, 
synergistic relationship? How the founders work together at the time of 
launch determines future success.
Alignment: Are the founders aligned on their goals and expectations of the 
venture/idea?
Execution: Once the team is in place, can they execute as Planned.
The idea is only half the battle; it’s the people, how they work together, and 
their quality of output that determines success. These factors allow a team 
to face adversity with strength and quickly to adjust course in the face of 
required change.
Bob: Are they’re more, fewer, or about the same number of startups today 
as, say, three years ago? Are more of them successful?
Shaherose: As the economy contracts, the number of startups is decreasing, 
but the quality of the remaining startups is increasing and they are better 
positioned to succeed.

Both Startup2Startup and Women 2.0 are parts of the actual Silicon Val-

Try Meetup and Eventbrite. They are two of those “something huge 
happening on the Internet while no one was watching” things. The ethos 
and values of “startupism” have spread far and wide, thanks to how easy it

is to connect people who share a given interest, not just online but in 
actuality.
For example, recently I went rummaging for entrepreneur events at 
Meetup.com (Figure 4-19). Check out those stats: 271,343 entrepreneur 
Meetup Group members (plus another 47,137 interested people) have 
had 19,209 meetups in 761 cities in 36 countries. You are most definitely 
not alone.

So what kinds of meetups are out there for startups? Here’s a small 
sampling that caught my eye from Atlanta, Georgia, and London, England.
■Atlanta’s Entrepreneurial Think Tank—AETT is a professional 
networking group for strong-minded entrepreneurs who either have 
their own businesses or would like to go into business for themselves.

■AWSome Atlanta (cloud computing user’s group)—Cloud tech-
nology in Atlanta. A technology meetup to discuss Amazon’s new 
cloud offerings, EC2 and S3. However, all cloud technologies are 
fair game for discussion. (180 members)

business models. Swap business cards and watch your personal busi-
ness directory grow! (644 members)
■London Creative Entrepreneurs—Anyone running or setting up a 
creative business who wants to meet other creative entrepreneurs, 
swap ideas, tips, and gossip, get remotivated, have a coffee or a 
drink somewhere stylish, go to art exhibitions, workshops, and

creative talents. (392 members)
■Geektails—After-work drinks in central London each month, for 
those who love Internet startups to meet and share ideas socially.

investors, and just general geeks! (252 members)
Meetup.com is not the only way to find other startup founders offline: 
at Eventbrite (http://www.eventbrite.com/find-events?) I found 76 events 
ranging from startup weekends (see next paragraph) to Lunch 2.0 to Exe-
cuting the Exit workshops.
And meetups and events are not the only way to get in the same room 
with other startup-minded people. Begun in 2007 by Andrew Hyde, each 
Startup Weekend (25 as of March 2009 in the United States and Europe) 
brings together developers, business managers, startup enthusiasts, graphic 
artists, and more for an intense 54-hour experience: build the code and 
business beginnings of a startup.
Here’s how it works: Having signed up in Eventbrite for $40 to cover 
meals, the meeting facility, and a tee-shirt, about 100 people gather at a 
given location Friday night to share and vote on scores of ideas for startups. 
The list gets winnowed down to eight or nine projects and then people get 
to intense work for the rest of the weekend.

The combination of coding and business building like mad, plus drop-
in special guests such as local VCs and angle investors, plus working face 
to face with a team of programmer/business types/graphic artists with a 
shared goal to launch—or at least prototype—a startup by weekend’s end 
is the type of extraordinary experience that gets results (Figure 4-20).
Figure 4-20. Startup Weekend
Now, this approach may not be what you want for your startup, and a 
good many of these efforts end up in the dead pool.11 But like most things, 
practice makes perfect and getting to know other people with the same 
burning ambitions as you have is a great first step to connecting with 
future cofounders.
One more place worth checking if you’re looking for a startup group 
to join: YouNoodle (at http://younoodle.com). YouNoodle is fast becom-
ing a major node in the startup world: you can profile your startup there 
to attract investor and team members, find startup events, browse other 
people looking for startups to join, and find and create entrepreneurial 
groups. YouNoodle also has something called its Startup Predictor: feed it 
data about your startup and it will, based on a database of past startups, 
predict your likelihood of success.
Although I am more than a little skeptical that startup success can be 
reduced to a database filtering exercise, it’s worth a look, and the rest of 
YouNoodle is really valuable.

Online Forums
So where can you go for recommendations on whether you need business 
insurance for your startup, dealing with companies who want you to invoice 
them, finding a code repository, and other questions about running your 
startup business? I’d  recommend the Joel on Software Business of Soft-
ware forum (BOS, see Figure 4-21).12
Figure 4-21. Business of Software Forum
I first wandered into BOS when I was searching for help on how to sell 
my first commercial product, back in 2004. I was amazed to find a spam-
free, troll-free online community of successful and aspiring software ven-
dors who’d share what they found works in their business.
That search lead to my first book,13 and the book led to Joel Spolsky’s 
asking me to join Eric Sink and, as of 2009, Andy Brice and Patrick 
McKenzie in moderating BOS. Several things are unique about BOS that 
aren’t the case at your run-of-the-mill phpBB forum.

■Spam. Since BOS runs on FogBugz’s forum software (see Chapter 8), 
nearly all spam never sees the light of day, and the few spammy posts 
quickly get zapped by one of the moderators.
■Trolls, flame-war baiters, and abusive people check in but fade away 
fast. One problem every online forum contends with is that small 
percentage of humanity who look to pick fights online or for people 
to belittle or who just go into Online Road Rage Mode over the 
slightest disagreement. These types poison the information well for 
everyone else. At BOS, the moderators spray them with a magical 
disinfectant that lets them have the satisfaction of a good abusive 
rant without bothering anyone else -.
■A wide range of software industry participants. Though a lot of BOS 
regulars are microISVs, a range of people regularly contribute from 
many segments of the IT industry from all over the globe.
■Registration. Unlike online forums, such as Slashdot, as of 2009 you 
had to register at least a fictitious name and e-mail address in order 
to post. That means you can have your anonymity and a secure online 
reputation on which other BOS readers can rely.
Here’s another  “Business of Software” online thingy in which you 
should consider participating: the Business of Software Social Network 
(http://network.businessofsoftware.org). Founded by Neil Davidson 
(whom we met in Chapter 1), this Ning-powered social network is 900+ 
members strong as of this writing and growing. It tends to cover more of 
the issues that existing software vendors face, such as e-mail campaigns 
to existing customers, using public webinars as marketing tools, and 
doing a better job as a product manager.
Speaking of Ning (http://www.ning.com)—which we do a bit more of 
in Chapter 6—take a moment and search for “startups” there. You’ll find 
small local groups that might just be in your vicinity and a few large online 
social networks, such as Startup Net and EQ Connect.
When you talk about online social networks, the big gorilla is Face-
book (http://www.facebook.com). You’ll find over 500 results if you search 
Facebook Groups for “startup,” groups such as Web Startups, Canadian 
Startups, LA Startups, StartupAfrica, Toronto Tech Startups, Sydney 
Web Startups, and the megagroup, Web 2.0 (Entrepreneurs).
If Facebook groups aren’t for you, there’s the other big gorilla in the 
social network: LinkedIn (http://www.linkedin.com). A quick search 
there recently yielded 212 “startup” groups. One I’d recommend is Darmish 
Shah’s On Startups.

Annual Conferences
To wrap up this section on getting out more for the benefit of your startup, 
let me introduce you to three annual conferences you should know about.
First off is the European Software Conference, which is in its ninth 
year of providing two days of quality sessions for those building their own 
software businesses. With about 150 to 200 attendees, sessions range 
from web optimization techniques to excellent advice on AdWords to dis-
tributed agile development. I’ve attended twice and found the speakers 
knowledgeable, the vendors interesting, and the beer and camaraderie 
excellent. It is usually held the first weekend in November and costs 140 
to 165. See http://euroconference.org for more information.
Next, on this side of the Atlantic, is the Software Industry Confer-
ence. A little larger than the European Software Conference, it runs two 
tracks of sessions for three days. The sessions are also very good, and they 
tend to cover a larger number of topics. It’s usually held in July and costs 
$229. See http://sic.org for more information.
Both these conferences originated in the desktop shareware days of 
the last century and have their own awards ceremonies and a group of 
already-established small software firms that make up the organizational 
core. But much of the material is relevant to startups regardless of plat-
form, and there’s a lot to be learned from people already successful.
Finally, there’s the three-year-old Business of Software Conference. 
Organized by Joel Spolsky (CEO of Fog Creek Software) and Neil Davidson 
(see Chapter 1), this conference is aimed at the founders and management 
of software companies, both established and new. If you’re interested in the 
insights and wisdom of people such as Paul Graham, Don Norman, and 
Ryan Carson, insights that can galvanize your strategic vision for your 
startup, this is the place to be. In November 2008 it cost $1,495 to $1,995. 
See http://www.businessofsoftware.org for more information.
Large Vendor Programs for Startups
There are a couple more tools for startups you should know about, These 
are programs offered by major IT players designed especially for startups, 
not out of altruism but because startups are a key element in keeping 
these platform vendors healthy long term.

Microsoft BizSpark
Whereas Microsoft has offered startups deals on their development tools 
and server licenses for years via something called the Empower14 program, 
BizSpark (http://www.microsoft.com/BizSpark) goes way beyond that 
(Figure 4-22). If you get into the program, you’ll get Microsoft’s top-of-
the-line development tools (Visual Studio Team Foundation) with all the 
trimmings, development server licenses for everything from SQL Server 
2008 to SitePoint Server, and, most importantly, production licenses for as 
many Windows Servers your startup needs to run for three years15—for free.
Figure 4-22. Microsoft BizSpark
How do you get into the program?
■Be a startup—that is, a business selling software, not doing custom 
or freelance development.
■Be in business less than three years—or be planning to do all the 
legal stuff to be a business in the eyes of the law in your country.

15 There’s a “program termination fee” at the end of the three years of $100. I guess there’s still one 
bean counter somewhere in Microsoft!

  Tools and Groups for Startups
141
■Make less than $1million a year.
■Get sponsored by an organization, group, or individual who is a 
BizSpark Network Partner.
How do you find a BizSpark Network Partner? You’re reading a book 
from one. In fact, at least as of March 2009, I’m the single most active 
BizSpark Network Partner, sponsoring some 152 startups. Just e-mail me 
at bob.walsh@47hats.com, stick BizSpark in the subject, and tell me a bit 
about your startup and its (planned) app, and we’ll get the ball rolling.
Since I don’t get paid to do this, I should explain why I do it: for philo-
sophical and business reasons both I and Microsofties who got the company 
to go for BizSpark want to see more developers, specifically.NET develop-
ers, become startups.
Until BizSpark, the production server licenses for, say, Windows Server 
and SQL Server were way too big an expense for a non-VC-funded startup 
to swallow, realistically meaning that if you and a buddy wanted to launch 
a startup and then attract capital, you’d better be planning to use Linux 
and other Open Source languages, IDEs, and technology.
From my point of view, BizSpark removes a huge roadblock for devel-
opers who happen to live in the .NET world but hunger for the chance to 
escape their cubicle farms and make it to entrepreneurial freedom. (You 
can get more info at http://www.microsoft.com/bizspark/Default.aspx.)
Sun Startup Essentials
Microsoft isn’t the only big platform vendor who’s realized that being 
nice to startups pays off. Sun Microsystems Startup Essentials Program 
(http://www.sun.com/emrkt/startupessentials) offers a tasty buffet of 
benefits for startups including the following:
■Hefty discounts on servers—for example, a well-provisioned Sun 
server with your choice of OS flavor for $750
■Deep discounts on Sun and MySQL software
■Big discounts from Sun partners for web hosting
■Free e-mail technical support from Sun engineers
■Free or discounted training on Sun’s Open Source software and 
development tools

Did that last bullet point catch your attention? It did mine, so I e-mailed 
Joann Yates, the marketing manager for the Sun Startup Essentials program. 
How does the VC funding aspect work? “We are partnering with Plug and 
Play Tech Center to leverage their vast network of investors,” Joann replied. 
“Together with Plug and Play Tech Center [a Silicon Valley service provider 
for startups looking for hosting and funding] we evaluate each submitted 
Executive Summary of a startup’s business, gather more information 
where necessary, and, for higher-potential ventures, attempt to match 
them against investors’ business focus and goals. Investors can then 
review and meet with the startup for possible funding opportunities.”
Since the program started in November 2006, it’s expanded to 
29 countries and thousands of startup companies.
Does Sun feel this program has been successful evangelizing Sun’s 
platform? “Yes, although the primary purpose of the program is to bring 
Sun’s great technologies to startups so that they can get off on a good

footing that will allow them to grow quickly into a successful business,” 
Joann replied. “We want to have the Fortune 100 companies of the future 
as Sun customers, and some of these startups will become just that.”
Recap
One of the really nice things about launching a startup now is the wealth 
of great tools, groups, organizations, business programs, and company 
you find along the way. If anything, one real problem you need to face as 
a startup is that you’re liable to drown in all the information to which you 
have access, at the expense of getting done the work you need to on your 
startup.
In this chapter, I’ve discussed a range of tools useful to your startup. 
Please feel free to ignore them, but if you do, you ignore the problems 
they address, at your startup’s peril.
Besides a codebase, you’re going to have to cover a wide variety of 
business bases. That’s where the tools covered in this chapter can make a 
critical difference to getting to launch in a reasonable timeframe. Just in 
the past few years we’re starting to see tools by startups for startups—
congratulations, you’re now a Market! -
There’s another set of tools—better described as opportunities—for 
startups, and that’s a huge explosion in ways to connect, face-to-face, with 
others seeking to build their own companies. It’s been my observation 
that the more you put into face-to-face networking with other people in 
the Startup World, the more doors open to you for advice, funding, support, 
and opportunity. And, thanks to the Web, the days when you had to relocate 
to Silicon Valley to connect with other software entrepreneurs are well 
and truly over: The Valley is a global state of mind and set of values now, 
and that’s a very, very good thing.
Finally, don’t forget that at least two big companies are putting their 
money where their “we love startups” words are: Definitely check out both 
Microsoft BizSpark and Sun Startup Essentials as means to your ends.
Next up, we’re finally going to get into a subject that should be near 
and dear to you—money—specifically, dissipating the air of mystery around 
exactly how to get friends, family, angel investors, and venture capitalists 
to put their money into your dream.

Follow the Money
Odds are good you flipped to this chapter first, right? You were hoping 
that you’d find my patent-pending, supersecret, highly proprietary magic 
formula that, when cast over angel investors and venture capitalists, causes 
them to swoon and shower you with millions. Sorry to disappoint.
No magic formulas here, nor killer rules for VC presentations, nor 
amazing acts of prestidigitation—just a solid appraisal of the cold, hard 
reality of what it really takes to get funded, some very good advice on the 
legal and financial basics of a startup, and a few recommendations about 
what goes into that space between your customers’ credit cards and your 
startup’s bank account. If you’re dreaming right now that tomorrow 
you’ll see your startup glowingly described in TechCrunch as the latest 
canny investment to the tune of $5 million from a couple of VC outfits 
you’ve never heard of,1 then you’d better wake up and smell the coffee.

If I can accomplish one thing in this chapter it’s disabusing you of the 
mindset that funding is somehow an end in itself, that getting other peo-
ple’s equity money is the pot of gold at the end of your startup rainbow. It 
doesn’t work that way, it has never worked that way, and thinking that way 
hangs a leper’s bell around your neck that you can’t hear but that every 
angel investor and VC can.
If, on the other hand, you want an introduction to the realities of how 
to fund your startup, then this chapter should get you started on the right 
road. Specifically I will focus on what happens after you’ve put your money 
and perhaps the money of family and friends into your startup.
And since we’re playing for real money here, we will also cover how 
you as a startup need to manage your finances, and, by the way, how actually 
to make money. Teaching basic accounting and bookkeeping are beyond 
the scope of this book, but hopefully you’ll finish this chapter with some 
idea of the difference between a profit/loss sheet and a balance sheet. 
Correctly forming your company and putting in place standard business 
practices isn’t the game you want to play. But unless you get this stuff 
right, you won’t even get to suit up.
Making money is what this entire book is about. But in this chapter, 
you’ll get a rundown on five vendors who are in the business of converting 
your customers’ money into your money: payment processors. Plus we’ll 
take a quick look at a company that’s found a way for you to get money 
from people who can’t or won’t buy your software.
Finally, we’ll talk with one of the most knowledgeable people I know 
about something that just about every startup uses to connect to its mar-
ket and make money: Google AdWords.
Raising the Money
In this section we’re going to cover the basics of how, hypothetically, a 
first-time founder goes from “I want to build a startup” to preseed fund-
ing, angel investment, and then Series A funding in multiple tens of mil-
lions of dollars.
I need to make two things crystal clear. First, unlike a lot of the topics 
I talk about in this book, I myself have never raised outside funding. What 
I present here is a synthesis of the best information, advice, suggestions, 
and warnings I’ve accumulated while researching this book, not my per-
sonal experience. Second, I’m assuming we are in the same boat, that is, 
that this is your first startup, not your second or third, where a whole 
different set of rules apply.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
147
Understanding the Funding Ladder
One of the first things you have to understand about getting money for 
your startup is that we’re talking about four very different kinds of money, 
each with its own set of rules, motivations, and realities.
■The 3 F’s: family, friends, and fools (that’s you). This is the initial 
money you need to start, beginning with the first buck you spend on 
your startup. For most startups today that’s something in the range of 
zero to $50,000. This is the money you (as a person) invest in you 
(as a business entity), and your cofounders do likewise.
■As a founder, you’re going to want (and probably need) to structure 
any nonfounder 3F money as debt rather than sell a part of your 
company (equity), for several reasons, the most compelling being 
that potential angel/VC investors want it that way.
■Borrowing from friends and family obviously requires (1) friends 
and family who can afford to risk thousands of dollars on your dream 
and (2) some form of a promissory note detailing (a) the amount 
loaned, (b) the circumstances under which it will be paid back (your 
startup’s hitting revenue targets is far better than a date certain), 
(c) whether you are personally guaranteeing the loan, and (d) the 
interest rate you’ll pay for the use of this money (somewhere between 
the prevailing commercial loan rates and, say, 30%). In addition, at 
this point you should at least be able to state what you are attempting 
to build, why and how it’s going to make money, and the gist of your 
startup in a couple of sentences.
■Keep in mind you’re playing with fire here. If your startup crashes, 
you may kill a friendship or turn some or all of your family against 
you for the rest of your life. Fortunately, bootstrapping, which 
doesn’t involve hitting up your friends and family for money, is a 
realistic way to go.
■Angel round of investment ($50,000 to $5 million). Now you’re 
running with the Big Dogs, specifically with accredited and sophis-
ticated investors.2 Your angel funding (also called seed funding) 
might be because either one person has written you a check for 
$500,000 or you’ve made it to the final round of an arduous struc-
tured screening process.
2  Accredited and sophisticated has specific meanings—you’re entering the world of equity funding, so 
you best start learning what these and many other terms mean.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
148
■You’re going to need a lot of things to win this game: an executive 
summary that rivets attention, a totally credible business plan, a 
knockout presentation with a hundred researched, intelligent backup 
answers, and at least a working prototype if not actual proof of life.3 
But most of all you must be able to tell that angel investor (who was 
probably in your shoes a few years ago) how to turn his or her $200,000 
into a minimum of $2 million in five years or less while enjoying 
living in your world.
■Don’t underestimate that last point. I’ve been told by people who’ve 
secured their angel investment funding that for angels, it’s not just 
the money; it’s the desire to be back in the game. They want to 
contribute to the next (Internet) generation of founders, pay forward 
the help their angel investors and VCs gave them, solve problems, 
open doors, and convert the pain of hard lessons learned into the 
pleasure of helping you. Of course, don’t think for one split second 
that the money isn’t a prime issue here; it’s just not the only issue.
■Out on the Internet you’ll find angel groups that behave more like 
VCs, VCs interested and willing to fund very “early-stage” startups 
with angel-like money, and startup incubators and programs (see 
the later section “Startup Incubators”) that sometimes precede or 
replace angel funding. This is the real world, not the API. One key 
fact that should help you understand the difference between angels 
and VCs is where they get the money they put into startups. Typically, 
angels are investing their own after-tax moolah, whereas VCs have 
raised a pool of funds from universities, pension funds, hedge funds, 
very rich investors, IT companies, and who knows where else. Venture 
capitalists have a very real fiduciary responsibility to return big 
globs of ROI to the people for whom they work; angels are betting 
their own money.
3  No, I don’t mean a picture of you holding today’s newspaper. I mean either customers paying your 
startup money, registered people using your software, big-number page views and unique visitors, or 
some other metric indicating that there’s a market, a big market, out there for what you’re going to 
be selling.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
149
■If you are a first-time founder and you can secure angel funding that 
lets you build a $20 million to $50 million company in five years’ 
time, be happy. You’ve jumped through multiple hoops of fire and 
walked across burning coals unscathed. If your company (it’s no 
longer a startup) needs to climb to the next rung of the funding 
ladder, you’d better have added to your skill set levitation, turning 
lead into gold, a whole team of advisors, executives, and directors, 
and a truly rare chance to create eight- or nine-figure wealth.
■Series A funding ($1 million to around $6 million). You’ve now 
entered the world of VCs—if and only if they think you can turn 
their $3 million into $80 million, $100 million, $300 million within 
three to around seven years. I say around because there’s no such 
thing as hard-and-fast rules at this level of the funding game; different 
VCs invest in different sectors, represent different money pools, and 
have their own strategies for winning big.
■It’s a gross but useful oversimplification that to secure this kind of 
funding in this era following the 2008 economic meltdown, you prob-
ably have done your angel investing round and that your company is 
a going concern that’s producing revenue, has very good connections, 
and, if scaled to 10 times its current size, has a strong chance of 
being the global market leader in a significant market.
■Series B, C funding ($8 million and up). Think of this as Series A, 
part 2, funding and up.
You Are Not Alone
As with any unmet need, there are people out there to help you, the startup 
founder, succeed. One of them is Brandon Zeuner. Brandon is the cofounder 
of Venture51 (http://venture51.com; Figure 5-1), a venture/launch firm 
that helps early-stage tech startups go from idea to launch. Brandon’s 
recent involvement in startups includes newly launched Republic Project 
(http://www.republicproject.com), PeopleJar (http://peoplejar.com), 
and Growth Panel (http://www.growthpanel.com). Before cofounding 
Venture51, he was on the founding executive team at Flypaper. Brandon and 
his team handle Growth Panel’s Internet marketing and social media 
strategy. Brandon established his professional reputation as a software 
marketing and sales guy at SalesLogix and ACT! Software before turning 
in florescent lighting and corporate politics for the startup world and 
helping startups launch.

Figure 5-1. Venture51
Bob: What is Venture51, and what does it do for startups?
Brandon: Venture51 is a venture/launch firm that helps early-stage 
tech startups go from idea to launch. Venture51’s philosophy is grounded 
in launching startups with minimal infusions of capital and includes an 
active involvement in executing the product development and launch 
strategy using emerging sales and marketing channels. As sales and market-
ing technologists, we believe that to improve the batting average of the 
portfolio, you must insulate good products with ongoing emerging sales 
and marketing activity. We help early-stage startups go from idea to launch, 
providing the support they need to be a great company and not simply 
another tech product.
Bob: What parts of the startup puzzle do you provide, and what do 
they cost?
Brandon: Software and Web development, user experience design, 
mentors and advisors, legal, accounting, and administrative help, launch 
and perpetual launch marketing services, perpetual launch strategy, social 
media marketing, search, web and interactive experiences, digital market-
ing, mobile, gaming, and emerging media, affiliate marketing sales and 
business development service, and investment strategy and enablement.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make

There are no set fees for our services. We work with the operators of 
these startups to identify the gaps in either product development or 
go-to-market. Depending on services needed, we then work out a hybrid 
equity/cash deal (with a heavier emphasis on the equity side) to keep 
burn low and runway extended.
Bob: What’s your deal flow like these days?
Brandon: Deal flow has been great. We typically see 20–30 new deals 
per month. These deals are coming in from all over the country, but primarily 
the southwest. Out of the deals we see we intend to work with approxi-
mately 10 new startups per year.
Bob: Do you get involved with finding angel/VC funding for your clients? 
How does that work?
Brandon: Venture51 is not a fund and we are not finders. We work 
with startups to prepare them for varying levels of funding if needed. We 
have relationships with established angels and nontraditional VCs. We 
help to prepare the startup for the discussions but do not participate or 
take any fees in the capital formation process. We also identify whether 
the startup truly needs a cash infusion or if the gaps identified can be 
filled by efforts from our development team or marketing services.
The Basics of the Funding Game
Now that we’ve covered at least a working definition of what Other People’s 
Money looks like to a first-time founder, I’d like to save you a few dozen 
hours Googling this subject by covering the basics of the funding. You 
will want those hours—and several hundred more—for doing the things 
necessary to actually get funded, but at least this section should give you 
a basic orientation to MoneyLand.
The Art of Raising Angel Capital, by Guy Kawasaki
When I interviewed Guy Kawasaki for Chapter 9, he was kind enough to grant 
permission to reprint several posts from his blog, How to Change the World. 
On these three topics—raising angel capital, the top ten lies of entrepreneurs, 
and the art of bootstrapping, I think Guy has written pretty near the final 
word—and words you should take to heart.
Make no mistake about it: There is an art to raising angel capital. Raising 
angel capital is not harder or easier than raising institutional venture capital—it’s 
simply different. Here’s how to do it.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
152
1. Make sure they are “accredited” investors. “Accredited” is 
legalese for “rich enough never to get back a penny.” Just read what 
the SEC says. You can get into a boatload of trouble for selling stock to 
the proverbial “little old lady in Florida,” so don’t do it. And get a good 
corporate finance attorney (as opposed to your aunt, the divorce lawyer) 
to advise you about the process of seeking investments.
2. Make sure they’re sophisticated investors. I’m a masochist for 
hate e-mail, but I’ll tell you anyway: the least desirable angel investor 
is a rich doctor or dentist—unless you’re a life sciences entrepreneur. 
They will drive you crazy because they read how Ram Shriram made 
gazillions of dollars as an early investor in Google, and now, six months 
later, they want to know when you’re going public too. Sophisticated 
angel investors have knowledge and expertise in your industry—they 
will have “been there and done that.” Sure, you want their money, but 
you also want their expertise. Be warned: if you want to raise venture 
capital in later rounds, it’s going to be much harder if you show up with 
a long list of unsophisticated investors.
3. Don’t underestimate them. If I had a nickel for every time an entre-
preneur told me that she was going to raise angel capital because it was 
easier than raising venture capital, I wouldn’t have to run ads in this 
blog. Do everything on the venture capitalist wish list because the days 
of angel investors as “easy marks” are gone forever—if this was ever 
true. You can have an “early stage” company but not a “dumbass” 
company, and angels care as much about liquidity as venture capitalists—
maybe even more since they’re investing their personal, after-tax money. 
Angels do not consider investments to be “charitable contributions”—
well, no angel whose money you’d want, anyway.
4. Understand their motivation. Here’s how angel investors differ 
from venture capitalists. Typically, angel investors have a triple bottom 
line. First, they’ve “made it,” so now they want to “pay back” society by 
helping the next generation of entrepreneurs. Second, they’d like to 
stay current with technology and tinker with interesting products and 
technologies. Finally, they want to make money. Thus, they are often 
willing to invest in less proven, more risky deals to provide entrepre-
neurs with the ability to get to the next stage. I know many nice venture 
capitalists, but I cannot tell you that many of them are motivated by the 
desire to pay back society or seek intellectual stimulation. :-)

5. Enable them to live vicariously. More on angel motivation: One of 
the rewards of angel investing is the ability to live vicariously through an 
entrepreneur’s efforts. That is, angels want to relive the thrills of entre-
preneurship while avoiding the firing line. Thus, you should frequently 
seek their guidance because they enjoy helping you. By contrast, most 
venture capitalists only want to get involved when things are going really 
well or really poorly.
6. Make your story comprehensible to a spouse. The investment 
committee for many venture capitalists works like this: “You vote for 
my deal, and I’ll vote for yours.” That’s not how decisions are made by 
angel investors because the usual membership of an angel’s investment 
committee consists of one person: a spouse. So, if you’ve got a “client-
server Open Source OPML carrier-class enterprise software” product, 
you must make it comprehensible to the angel’s husband when he asks, 
“What are we going to invest $100,000 into?”
7. Sign up people that they’ve heard of. Angel investors are also 
motivated by the social aspect of investing with buddies in startups run 
by bright, young people who are changing the world. Even if the other 
investors are not buddies, investing side by side with well-known angels 
is quite attractive. If you get one of these guys or gals, you’re likely to 
attract a whole flock of angels too.
8. Be nice. More so than venture capitalists, angel investors fall in love 
with entrepreneurs. Often, the entrepreneurs remind them of their 
sons or daughters—or fill the position of the sons or daughters they 
never had. Venture capitalists will often invest in a schmuck if the schmuck 
is a proven money maker. If you’re seeking angel capital, you’re probably 
not proven, so you can’t get away with acting like a schmuck. There-
fore, be nice until you’re proven—although I hope that when you’re 
proven, you’ll also realize that you should be a mensch.

1. What You’re Building, What You Can Achieve, and 
How Valuable It’ll Be
The very first step of a process that will span years of your life is to get 
a rock-solid understanding of what kind of startup you want to build, 
what you can realistically achieve, and what valuation others will see in 
your efforts.
■What kind of startup do you want to create? I assume you’ve read 
Chapter 1, but it’s worth repeating: You (and your cofounders) need 
to decide at the get-go what you are building and why. There is no 
single right answer. Are you building a microISV that you will run 
yourself that yields an annual income—best case—something like 
$500,000 a year?
■Or are you building a software company with some number of 
employees that will have, say, $5 million in sales and, after all is said 
and done, create a sellable asset you might possibly be able to cash 
out one day for $15 million? Or do you honestly and truly believe 
with all your heart and soul that you’ve got an idea, the technical 
expertise, and the market opportunity to create another Google, 
YouTube, or Skype?
■What kind of startup can you build this time around?4 Again, it’s 
time for a dose of brutal self-honesty. What technical, financial, and 
social resources can you bring to bear on creating your startup? If 
you’re an experienced, respected developer with more work offered 
you than you can do, with a good network among other experienced 
developers and six months savings in the bank, that’s one thing. If 
you’re a programmer with only a couple of years in the business who’s 
just been laid off from your first postcollege job, that’s another.
■Again, there’s no right answer here; but the wrong answer is not 
being honest with yourself about what resources you have.
■How valuable will your startup be in the eyes of others? You may 
have hypnotized yourself into thinking that one-tenth of the human 
race will fork over money for your software; others may not be as 
optimistic. Forecast from the bottom up.
4  You may be planning your first startup, but nothing says it will be your last. In fact, a lot of first-time 
founders, regardless of outcome (acquisition, steady state, crash and burn) go on to launch their second, 
third, and nth startup or stay in the game as angel investors.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
155
■To add to the fun, your startup’s valuation is anything but objective, 
static, or well defined. Depending on who’s doing the valuation, 
everything gets thrown into the stewpot, from your financial fore-
casts to your office furniture (assuming you have an office, which 
you probably don’t) to the price tag put on a “comparable” startup 
last week, to your YouNoodle Score.5 Valuation is the basis for equity 
funding. And valuation—and what you can realistically raise from 
equity funding—changes as your startup grows and evolves. For 
more on what valuation means in the startup world, I’d recommend 
Cayenne Consulting’s (http://www.caycon.com) High Tech Startup 
Valuation Estimator at (http://www.caycon.com/resources.php).6
■There’s a fundamental economic reality here. When we’re talking 
about equity funding (as opposed to debt funding), we are talking 
legalized gambling, with the bettors in the game in hopes their 
10–60% of your company turns out to be worth at least 10 times 
what they paid you for it (angel investors), more like 50 times or 
hundreds of times (venture capitalists). If years down the road your 
company is going to be worth, say, a very respectable $50 million, 
the chances are close to zip that a VC will pony up $5 million in 
Series A funding. One of the biggest reasons startups that make it 
through the first VC meeting don’t get a dime is not that they are 
bad people, but they just don’t see how your potential valuation can 
get into the ballpark they need.
■The bottom line on valuation is whether your company is worth what 
the people you’re trying to get funding from say it’s worth. While 
you obviously need to put forward a credible estimate in your busi-
ness plan (see next section), your potential investors are going to be 
far more interested in and accepting of your numbers if you make a 
compelling case and are not just spinning fantasies.
5  We saw YouNoodle back in Chapter 4. YouNoodle’s Startup Valuation Predictor is at http://
younoodle.com/predictor. After completing a fairly detailed questionnaire, the Predictor weighs 
the team, financial factors, concept, and advisors of your startup and gives you its estimate of your 
startup’s value in three years.

2. Deciding and Documenting What You Need
“What do you want the money for?” You can expect to hear that from 
every single person, from your mother-in-law to the steely-eyed VC who 
looks like he’s just dined on a buffet of livers ripped from the bodies of 
would-be founders. Answers to this question differ depending on where 
your startup is at, and they range from expanding your inbound sales 
team to further product development to committing to your share of a 
strategic partnership.
These questions should get answered, in enough detail to be credible, 
in your executive summary and your business plan. There’s an infinitude 
of right answers, but here are two wrong answers and why they’re wrong.
■Pay back the founders. Wrong answer! That’s not how it works. The 
money you and your founders have invested up to this point is not 
going to be returned to you until and unless you sell your company—
and, unless you had good legal/accounting counsel from before you 
took you first dollar, euro, or yen, maybe not even then.
■Buying out a nonperforming partner. Wrong answer! This should 
never have happened, and it’s one of the reasons investors eyeball 
you and your cofounders so carefully before signing over the first 
tranche.7 See the later interview of Gene Landy to learn what he has 
to say about avoiding this leg-breaker.
3. Writing an Executive Summary and a Business Plan
Achieving success in getting funded by an angel investor or getting into a 
startup incubator means preparing the time-tested document that makes 
this process work: the business plan.
There are two separate and distinct kinds of business plans in the 
startup world. One is the business plan that specifies what you are build-
ing, how it will operate, and what decisions you’ve made. We’ll talk about 
these in Chapter 8. The second kind is the business plan and its executive 
summary that serve as your startup’s API—how others will put money into 
your business and get anywhere from 10 to 1,000 times more money back 
in a specified number of years.
7  The equity funding world has as specialized a vocabulary as any you’ll find in IT. If you want their 
money, you’d better learn to speak their language of deal flows, capital structure, accredited investors, 
and, yes, tranche, which is French for “slice.” For the basics (since Google Translate does not yet cover 
this), check out the Venture Capital Glossary at FundingPost (http://www.fundingpost.com/
glossary/venture-glossary.asp) and the Glossary of Private Equity and Venture Capital at VC 
Experts (http://vcexperts.com/vce/library/encyclopedia/glossary.asp).

157
Let’s cover the executive summary first. It is, simply put, the one or 
two pages that sell your startup to the potential investor or that at least 
get your foot in the door. You can think of it as a written and more detailed 
version of the elevator pitch.8 What goes into it? To find out, visit Guy 
Kawasaki’s angel-funding Garage Technology Venture’s web site at http://
www.garage.com, and, under Resources, download “Writing a Compelling 
Executive Summary.”9
As for the business plan, the archetypical10 plan has the following 
sections.
■Executive Summary: This is the capstone of this particular edifice. 
You write it last, and in it, as concisely as possible, you explain what 
your selling and who, why, and how they’re going to buy, how much 
you want from investors, and why they should invest in your startup.
■Market Analysis: Here’s where you define and explain exactly who is 
going to buy from your startup and how you plan to go from zero 
market share to X% in, say, three years. But that’s only the begin-
ning. You’re going to want to dissect your primary market—how it 
works, who makes the buying decision, what the typical price points 
are, what trends or changes are affecting this market—among another 
dozen or so questions that demonstrate you’ve thought through 
who’s going to buy from you and why.
■Company Description: This section tells where you are in terms of 
staffing, state of development, milestones already reached, current 
objectives, and location.
8  Imagine you’re walking on California Street in San Francisco and see VC legend John Doerr (http://
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Doerr) walking past the 200-ton black granite sculpture locals 
call “Banker’s Heart” and into the landmark skyscraper that used to be the Bank of America’s head-
quarters. You follow him into the lobby, where you both get into an elevator. He’s heading to the 
Carnelian Room on the 52nd floor. You finally summon up the nerve to say to him, “Mr. Doerr, can I 
tell you about my startup?” Because he’s been funding startups longer than you’ve been alive and is a 
true gentleman, he responds, “Sure. What’s your pitch?” What you say to him before he exits on the 
52nd floor is your elevator pitch. Good luck!
9  Why don’t I just tell you what Guy has to say? I do in Chapter 9. But Guy, who writes better than I 
do, has written nine books, two of which you’d better own already at this stage: Reality Check (Portfolio 
Hardcover, 2008) and The Art of the Start (Portfolio Hardcover, 2004. He also has a must-read blog: 
How to Change the World (http://blog.guykawasaki.com).

SERV_ESSENTIAL.html.

■Organization and Management: This section details who does what 
in your company and what their background, core competencies, 
and experience are. It tells how your company is structured, who owns 
it and in what proportions, and who sits on your Board of Directors 
and what they bring to the party.
■Marketing and Sales Management: This section describes your 
target market and explain exactly how you’re going to sell to that 
market. It details your overall sales strategy, what channels you are 
using to implement that strategy (for example, whether you are going 
to have a sales force and, if so, how you will recruit, train, and 
compensate them). It specifies your sales funnel (from potential 
prospect through to customer) and how many people make it through 
each level of the process. Finally, it lists your competitors and your 
strategy for wresting market share from them.
■Service or Product Line: This section covers what you are selling. 
In it you describe your app or web service, what it provides to your 
customers, and how this connects to what you’ve identified as what 
the market needs and will pay for. By the way, while you’ll be talking 
about your product or service from a technical perspective (tech-
nology, patents pending, trade secrets), what really matters is how 
what you sell looks from your customers’ point of view.
■Funding Request: This section tells what you want the money for—
not just how much, over what period, and how you propose that 
funding be structured and released to you, but exactly what the 
money will be used for to meet your company’s objectives.
■Financials: This consists of two kinds of data: (1) a financial history 
of your firm to date (income and balance sheets, cash flow state-
ments, profit and loss statements) and (2) your revenue forecasts 
for the next five years and the assumptions, logic, and key metrics 
that make those forecasts believable.
■Appendix: This is a grab bag of everything, from your company’s 
and founders’ credit reports to copies of favorable reviews, key legal 
documents, strategic partnership agreements, and who your attorney 
and accountant are.
Now, there are endless variations of the exact structure of a business 
plan. And depending on whether you start from scratch, use a software-
driven template, or hire a business plan consultant, you are going to be 
investing a lot of time here. Writing a good business plan can make creat-
ing your software look easy.

Of course, the executive summary and business plan are the easy part 
of the funding process. Now the real fun begins.
4. The (Angel) Investment Process
There are two overlapping processes in this phase of the funding game: In 
theory, you’ll do one thing. In reality, an entirely different set of things 
will likely happen. If this sounds a bit like the difference between getting 
a job by applying for one you see on Craigslist or monster.com and slipping 
in before there’s a job opening posted because someone in your extended 
network of friends, buddies, ex-office mates, old girlfriends, old boyfriends, 
and family members gets you in, you’re spot on.
In theory, you’ll start by submitting your executive summary, business 
plan, and whatever else they want to numerous angel investor organiza-
tions such as you’ll find listed in the Directory section of the Angel Capital 
Association (http://www.angelcapitalassociation.org/dir_directory/
directory.aspx) or through Angelsoft (http://angelsoft.net11; see 
Figure 5-2).

These angel groups will take your application and the following 
will happen.
■They will do some sort of initial screening before adding you to their 
deal flow. If you pass that,
■You will get presented to either the angel group at large or a screening 
committee to decide if you should actually meet with or talk to 
them. If you pass that,
■You will talk to one or more angels. If you pass that,
■You will get checked out more intensively on everything from your 
references to your financials (due diligence). If you pass that,
■You will be presented to the one or more angel investors in the 
group (individuals invest, not the group as a whole) who might be 
interested investing, and/or you will come up with a prefunding 
valuation and a term sheet that spells out the particular percentage 
of your company they will buy with their investment.
■That prefunding valuation is essentially the denominator for what-
ever deal you’re offered in the term sheet. That term sheet might 
look something like the form term sheet Band of Angels has on its 
site (http://www.bandangels.com/entrepreneurs/index.php) or 
what the Wilson Sonini Goodrich & Rosati law firm’s Term Sheet 
Generator will produce at http://www.wsgr.com/WSGR/Display.
aspx?SectionName=practice/termsheet.htm or what you’ll find at 
TheFunded (see http://www.thefunded.com/funds/item/2674 for 
details).
■The particulars of what’s in a term sheet I leave for your attorney to 
explain, since he or she gets paid way more than I do.12 In a nutshell, 
the term sheet will spell out the kind and amount of stock in your 
company you are selling to the angel investor(s) and contain a variety 
of conditions, rights, and contingency clauses that may or may not 
come into play. Have you ever used the expression “The devil is in 
the details”? Terms sheets are probably where it comes from.
12 If for some reason you don’t already have an attorney who is savvy in tech/startup businesses, do 
not pass Go, do not sign, and get yourself one, pronto!

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
161
■While your attorney—at a rate of probably over $500 an hour—is 
explaining to you the joys of drag-along rights, reverse vesting, and 
liquidation preferences, the investors will continue the due diligence 
process (think of it as a kind of legal/business colonoscopy).
■Assuming you reach a meeting of the minds on terms and that 
your startup is free of worrisome polyps such as a nonperforming 
cofounder, clouded intellectual property rights, or a few hundred 
other little items, the investor writes a check, probably takes a seat 
on your Board, starts opening doors you didn’t know existed, and 
proffers sage advice, you get back to the business of scaling up your 
company while inspirational background music swells and the clouds 
part to reveal a sunny future.
Wasn’t that a nice story? It’s actually true, somewhat, some of the 
time, for some startups—maybe even yours.
The reality of the angel funding process is considerably different. 
First off, you didn’t send off your executive summary and business plan to 
all and sundry angel groups; you bounced it off the startup founder you 
met a few months ago at an event you both attended and who you were 
able to intro to a really good JavaScript coder you know who was just what 
that startup needed. That founder, who’s been through the angel funding 
mill, pointed out the 19 pieces of hype in your plan that actually were 
showstoppers and suggested that once you fixed the business strategy 
encapsulated in that plan, you talk to one of his investors, whom you actu-
ally know from a conference two years back.
The Top Ten Lies of Entrepreneurs, by Guy Kawasaki
I’ve included this post by Bill Reichert from Guy Kawasaki’s blog because in 
this business there’s a fine line between dreaming big and dreaming on. If you 
find you’re telling one of these ten lies to yourself, that should be a your-
house-is-on-fire wakeup call.
(Since I’ve antagonized the venture capital community with last week’s blog 
[The Top Ten Lies of Venture Capitalists, http://blog.guykawasaki.com/
2006/01/the_top_ten_lie.html], I thought I would complete the picture 
and “out” entrepreneurs to begin this week. The hard part about writing this 
blog was narrowing down these lies to ten. Luckily, my partner, Bill Reichert, 
had already documented this list of the top ten lies of entrepreneurs.)

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
162
We get pitched dozens of times every year, and every pitch contains at least 
three or four of these lies. We provide them not because we believe we can 
increase the level of honesty of entrepreneurs as much as to help entrepre-
neurs come up with new lies. At least new lies indicate a modicum of creativity!
1. “Our projections are conservative.” An entrepreneur’s projec-
tions are never conservative. If they were, they would be $0. I have never 
seen an entrepreneur achieve even her most conservative projections. 
Generally, an entrepreneur has no idea what sales will be, so she guesses: 
“Too little will make my deal uninteresting; too big, and I’ll look hallu-
cinogenic.” The result is that everyone’s projections are $50 million in 
year four. As a rule of thumb, when I see a projection, I add one year 
to delivery time and multiply by .1.
2. “(Big name research firm) says our market will be $50 billion 
in 2010.” Every entrepreneur has a few slides about how the market 
potential for his segment is tens of billions. It doesn’t matter if the 
product is bar mitzvah planning software or 802.11 chip sets. Venture 
capitalists don’t believe this type of forecast because it’s the fifth one of 
this magnitude that they’ve heard that day. Entrepreneurs would do 
themselves a favor by simply removing any reference to market size 
estimates from consulting firms.
3. “(Big name company) is going to sign our purchase order next 
week.” This is the “I heard I have to show traction at a conference” lie 
of entrepreneurs. The funny thing is that next week, the purchase order 
still isn’t signed. Nor the week after. The decision maker gets laid off, 
the CEO gets fired, there’s a natural disaster, whatever. The only way to 
play this card is AFTER the purchase order is signed, because no investor 
whose money you’d want will fall for this one.
4. “Key employees are set to join us as soon as we get funded.” 
More often than not when a venture capitalist calls these key employees 
who are VPs at Microsoft, Oracle, and Sun, he gets the following response: 
“Who said that? I recall meeting him at a Churchill Club meeting, but I 
certainly didn’t say I would leave my cushy $250,000/year job at Adobe 
to join his startup.” If it’s true that key employees are ready to rock and 
roll, have them call the venture capitalist after the meeting and testify 
to this effect.
5. “No one is doing what we’re doing.” This is a bummer of a lie 
because there are only two logical conclusions. First, no one else is 
doing this because there is no market for it. Second, the entrepreneur 
is so clueless that he can’t even use Google to figure out he has com-
petition. Suffice it to say that the lack of a market and cluelessness is 
not conducive to securing an investment. As a rule of thumb, if you 
have a good idea, five companies are doing the same thing. If you have 
a great idea, 15 companies are doing the same thing.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
163
6. “No one can do what we’re doing.” If there’s anything worse than 
the lack of a market and cluelessness, it’s arrogance. No one else can 
do this until the first company does it, and 10 others spring up in the 
next 90 days. Let’s see, no one else ran a sub-four-minute mile after 
Roger Bannister. (It took only a month before John Landy did.) The 
world is a big place. There are lots of smart people in it. Entrepreneurs 
are kidding themselves if they think they have any kind of monopoly on 
knowledge. And, sure as I’m a Macintosh user, on the same day that an 
entrepreneur tells this lie, the venture capitalist will have met with another 
company that’s doing the same thing.
7. “Hurry because several other venture capital firms are inter-
ested.” The good news: There are maybe 100 entrepreneurs in the 
world who can make this claim. The bad news: The fact that you are 
reading a blog about venture capital means you’re not one of them. As 
my mother used to say, “Never play Russian roulette with an Uzi.” For 
the absolute cream of the crop, there is competition for a deal, and an 
entrepreneur can scare other investors to make a decision. For the 
rest of us, don’t think one can create a sense of scarcity when it’s not 
true. Reread the previous blog about the lies of venture capitalists to 
learn how entrepreneurs are hearing “maybe” when venture capitalists 
are saying “no.”
8. “Oracle is too big/dumb/slow to be a threat.” Larry Ellison has 
his own jet. He can keep the San Jose Airport open for his late-night 
landings. His boat is so big that it can barely get under the Golden Gate 
Bridge. Meanwhile, entrepreneurs are flying on Southwest out of 
Oakland and stealing the free peanuts. There’s a reason why Larry is 
where he is and entrepreneurs are where they are, and it’s not that he’s 
big, dumb, and slow. Competing with Oracle, Microsoft, and other 
large companies is a very difficult task. Entrepreneurs who utter this lie 
look at best naive. You think it’s bravado, but venture capitalists think 
it’s stupidity.
9. “We have a proven management team.” Says who? Because the 
founder worked at Morgan Stanley for a summer? Or McKinsey for 
two years? Or he made sure that John Sculley’s Macintosh could power 
on? Truly “proven” in a venture capitalist’s eyes is the founder of a company 
that returned billions to its investors. But if the entrepreneur were that 
proven, then he (a) probably wouldn’t have to ask for money; (b) wouldn’t 
be claiming that he’s proven. (Do you think Wayne Gretzky went around 
saying “I am a good hockey player”?) A better strategy is for the entre-
preneur to state that (a) she has relevant industry experience; (b) she 
is going to do whatever it takes to succeed; (c) she is going to surround 
herself with directors and advisors who are proven; and (d) she’ll step 
aside whenever it becomes necessary. This is good enough for a venture 
capitalist that believes in what the entrepreneur is doing.

164
10. “Patents make our product defensible.” The optimal number of 
times to use the P word in a presentation is one. Just once, say, “We 
have filed patents for what we are doing.” Done. The second time you 
say it, venture capitalists begin to suspect that you are depending too 
much on patents for defensibility. The third time you say it, you are 
holding a sign above your head that says, “I am clueless.” Sure, you 
should patent what you’re doing—if for no other reason than to say it 
once in your presentation. But at the end, the patents are mostly good 
for impressing your parents. You won’t have the time or money to sue 
anyone with a pocket deep enough to be worth suing.
11. “All we have to do is get 1% of the market.” (Here’s a bonus 
since I still have battery power.) This lie is the flip side of “The market 
will be $50 billion.” There are two problems with this lie. First, no 
venture capitalist is interested in a company that is looking to get 1% 
or so of a market. Frankly, we want our companies to face the wrath 
of the antitrust division of the Department of Justice. Second, it’s also 
not that easy to get 1% of any market, so you look silly pretending that 
it is. Generally, it’s much better for entrepreneurs to show a realistic 
appreciation of the difficulty of building a successful company.

Now, this investor—who got a sweet cashout when the startup of which 
he has a piece was gobbled up like one of those tasty little crab puff appe-
tizers served at higher-end launch parties—isn’t really interested in you. 
But he knows this other investor, who’s just going crazy because she knows 
the right startup in your space is going to be another YouTube and she 
wants to be a player.
So the first investor gets you a warm intro to the second investor 
(paying off a favor). And now you and your team are sitting at a tiny table 
in some Starbucks trying to explain why your startup is worth their money. 
Maybe they like you. Maybe they don’t. Let’s say, for the sake of the story 
arc, that they do. Now, maybe this angel investor is a member of an angel 
investor group and talks you up at their next meeting and you jump the 
line in that group’s deal flow, or maybe they tell their attorney to meet 
with your attorney to see if a deal can be made. And, assuming a wheel 
doesn’t fall off the deal, you’ve checked out, they’ve checked out, and it 
all comes together. So now you have a real live angel on your side who not 
only funds your startup but connects you with some really good technical 
talent. The birds didn’t sing, the clouds didn’t part, and the challenges 
won’t stop, but your startup has a real shot at being a contender. Congrat-
ulations are definitely in order.

165
The point I’m trying to make here is that in addition to doing all the 
impersonal business things that are required of a startup seeking angel 
or VC funding, you are going to need to network like crazy face-to-face 
because that’s how this business works, and you’re kidding yourself if you 
think otherwise.
Where do you start? Try one of the organizations described in Chapter 4, 
reach out to some other founders, sign up for some kind of startup event 
in your part of the world. Whatever works—just start.
What Angels and Venture Capitalists Want
OK, enough editorializing. Here’s what three VCs and the founder of a 
prominent angel investor group told me to pass on to you about how get-
ting funded really works. Once you’ve read this section, you might notice 
that these four incredibly sharp and successful people happen to be women. 
This is anything but a representative sampling of the angel/VC space, 
where you’ll find at least four men to every woman in terms of company 
ownership, angels, VCs, you name it.
So what happened here? Well, angel investors and VCs are incredibly 
busy, successful people who by and large have zero bandwidth for snoopy 
authors pestering them for interviews for their upcoming books. That was 
true until I went to a Startup2Startup dinner where someone suggested I 
talk to Shaherose Charania, the managing director of Women 2.0 (see 
Chapter 4), who popped into the dinner for about 10 minutes. She was 
kind enough to answer my questions about Women 2.0 and then to reach 
out to her network to ask them, as a favor to her, to talk to me. Rebecca, 
Jo Anne, and Cindy gave me interviews, and Cindy made a warm intro to 
Stephanie. Beginning to get a sense of how this business works?
Rebecca Lynn, Principal, Morgenthaler Ventures
With over $2.5 billion invested in 300-plus companies over the years, 
Morgenthaler Ventures is one of the oldest VC firms in Silicon Valley, focusing 
on life sciences and IT. Here’s what Rebecca Lynn, who focuses on early-
stage investments in mobile, Internet services, digital media and financial 
services, had to say.
Bob: What do you look for in early-stage venture funding in the areas that 
you follow?
Rebecca: I think it’s pretty core. There are a number of areas, but there are 
two core things. One is a truly disruptive technology or business model. The 
second is they have to address a very large market. Those are really, I think, 
always the two key contributors to what we look for when we’re looking at 
early stage. Team is also a big factor. Market is a big factor and all of that. 

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
166
But the vein that runs through everything are those two issues. Is it truly 
disruptive? And does it address a big market?
Bob: How often do you find what you are looking for in the course of a year?
Rebecca: It’s funny, it goes in clusters. We will look at 100 or so deals where 
nothing is sort of what we were looking for. And then, it’s funny; we will find 
two in a row. It seems to go that way to be honest. It’s really a funny kind of 
business, but you just have to keep hunting and keep looking and be optimistic.
Bob: You’re one of the people who would act as a gatekeeper, I would say. 
If they can’t get past you, the odds that Morgenthaler Ventures, which is a 
40-year-old VC firm, is going to consider them are pretty slim. What do you 
down-check people for?
Rebecca: What do we sort of count against people?
Bob: Yeah. What are the signs that these people are not going to make it 
for you.
Rebecca: There are a few things. One thing is, venture capital funding is not 
for everybody. Oftentimes you’re better off just creating a really profitable 
business without creating the funding. When I say that, the reason is, when 
we look at a business idea, a lot of times we will see some great business 
ideas and we’re like, “Yeah. These people are going to make money doing 
this.” But it is not going to be enough for us to justify a venture investment.
We see so many ideas that we’re like, “Yeah, we could see these people 
making a couple million dollars a year and being profitable,” but we can’t see 
them becoming a $100-million-a-year company.
I think that’s the number one thing that we see. It’s hard to sort good busi-
nesses. For us to back a company there has to be some way that we could 
envision—some low probability, perhaps—that the stars are lining up and it 
could be a billion-dollar company.
We know the likelihood of its being that big is small, but there has to be sort 
of a path that we believe it can get there. And then if it can’t, then that is just 
not something that we can invest in as a VC business.
I tell entrepreneurs that all the time, that VC is not the only path for a lot of 
people. Oftentimes you can bootstrap companies, you can get angel invest-
ment. You could do things like that. But venture capital money is for capital-
intensive businesses.
Bob: A small point that a lot of people seem to forget in this game is that 
really you have to be a startup that needs significant amounts of capital and 
have that possibility of returning a really significant value to the people who 
have the capital.
Rebecca: Yeah, absolutely. Like I said, I see a lot of good businesses day in 
and day out that are solid businesses. They’re going to make somebody a 
pretty decent return. But the problem is, if somebody has a good idea and 
they come in and we write them a check for $3 million or $5 million, and the 
next day Google comes by the office and goes, “Oh, let’s pay you $10 million 
for that,” then the answer is no. I think a lot of entrepreneurs don’t realize 
that they have to basically be in it for the bigger payout.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
167
Bob: Now, if Google were to come by and you’ve written the check for $3 
million, and they say, “We’re prepared to pay $100 million, “then . . .
Rebecca: Oh, it would be done.
Bob: Then it’s break out the champagne.
Rebecca: Yeah, we’d be done. Exactly. We have been around for a very 
long time. I think one of the reasons we have been around for so long is that 
we are known as very friendly to entrepreneurs. We are very collaborative 
with them. We have a lot of entrepreneurs who have come back to us several 
times. And we have those honest conversations with people. We lay that 
out for them. We are like, “OK. If you take this money and there are . . . ” 
We want to make sure our goals are on the same page, and that’s what 
creates our success. I think that’s really important for people.
Bob: Can a startup still get funded if it has no actual revenue but a great 
technology and the potential to reach a market of the size you are looking 
for? Has the bar gone up?
Rebecca: I do think the bar has gone up in a lot of ways. Especially right 
now, since the funding situation is a lot tougher, companies have to have a 
way to support themselves and, if not support themselves, then have a way 
to sort of “make it through the desert,” which is what you have people talk 
about on the low burn right now. Our portfolio companies have been pretty 
successful at doing that. Will a technology-only company still get funded? 
We funded a semiconductor company, believe it or not, in 2004 after the 
crash. It is going to be a while before they’re profitable. But we believe in the 
technology and we think it’s truly disruptive.
So, yes, it’s still possible, but I think the bar is higher on a number of fronts. 
I just think there’s more expected. And I think when you look at true consumer 
software plays, that bar is higher, for a few reasons. And one is, of course, 
the economy and just the tightness overall of credit and things. But the 
second reason is it’s fundamentally cheaper by a lot, significantly cheaper, to 
start a company now, an Internet company especially.
You’ve got the cloud computing resources at Amazon. You don’t have to go 
buy your own servers right now, which was a huge expense for startups in 
the past. You’ve got all kinds of Open Source available to you. Ten years ago, 
when I was with NextCard, everything was from scratch, absolutely every-
thing. And now that’s not as much the case.
There are all kinds of tools, and then you have platforms like the iPhone and 
Facebook that significantly help with marketing distribution, so the payment 
for the initial marketing fund is oftentimes not as great.
So I actually think it takes less money and I think when you look at the online 
space, expecting that somebody is scrappy enough to at least get a product 
and a prototype going is not unrealistic at all.
Bob: So the bar is raised. Are there more or less or maybe the same number 
of companies coming your way? In other words, on one hand the need for 
the type of capital that a firm like Morgenthaler can provide, in general, seems

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
168
 to be less. A lot of platforms have gotten pretty mature. No one’s expecting 
a new Google to happen on Windows. Are you guys finding the opportuni-
ties drying up, or are they actually starting to cascade more than in the past?
Rebecca: No, I actually think it’s been a pretty steady state, to be honest. 
To answer the question, I think we’ve seen a lot of very interesting oppor-
tunities lately. There’s this weird phenomenon happening right now where 
people who have been successful entrepreneurs in the past, maybe checked 
out for a few years. They were kind of “on the beach,” is how we talk about 
it. And now, all of a sudden, they’re coming back. They’re like, “Wow, I can 
hire engineering talent again. I couldn’t hire it in here to save my life a year 
ago.” And now that there’s talent available and they can hire people, and 
their resources have become less expensive. We’re seeing a lot of those 
people resurface. And they are starting to kick around what they want to do 
next. And so that’s been really fun to see how that’s evolved.
Bob: Would you say that perhaps a drop in personal worth might have some-
thing to do with that too?
Rebecca: Yeah, I know, probably, actually. Probably they are saying, they’re 
probably like, “Hmm, maybe I’m not quite as done as I thought I was.”
Bob: Yeah.
Rebecca: And it’s kind of motivated them to come back and sort of try 
another shot at things.
Bob: For those people who are going out there and they’re looking to raise 
their first round of capital —they may not be going to Morgenthaler or they 
may be going to a real early-seed- or angel-type investor—what advice would 
you have for them in general?
Rebecca: In terms of presentation or what?
Bob: Mistakes not to make. Maybe insights that they should really have clear 
in their mind before they go off and look for venture capital or significant 
angel capital.
Rebecca: Yeah, it’s hard to say, because a lot of times different venture 
firms are different, to be honest. And some things that might work well with 
us I wouldn’t suggest people do with other firms. For example, with us it’s a 
good idea to come in really early, have a cup of coffee with us, talk to us about 
it in a casual way, so then we get a chance to know the entrepreneur over 
the next few months and see what they’re delivering and see how they track.
And so I think it’s good for the entrepreneur to come in. One of the recom-
mendations that came from a panel discussion I was on last night was “Don’t 
bring your entire team in.” Really, just the one or two people, the key people in 
the venture, are pretty much all you want to bring in on your first pitch.
I come from a product background and product development background, 
and it amazes me how many times I see a technology and no real market 
assessment as yet. So that, to me, is very important. I want to know that 
they’ve gone out, have talked to the consumer, have the tested the faults to 
see if this is going to be something that people want.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
169
And I think that’s very important for people to do before they come in. And 
other than that, I think people need to be confident and be honest about 
what they’re doing and how they got there. Every entrepreneur is a little 
different, and I think I would encourage . . . It’s hard to give general blanket 
advice in terms of what to do and what not to do when you come in.
The other thing, too, that is a huge mistake is coming in with a 35-page deck. 
They should pretty much be able to say things in 10, maybe 15 slides, tops. 
And be prepared for lots of questions. I’ve sat through pitches before where 
the first half hour was telling me about the market segments. That should 
have taken two to five minutes maybe, tops.
So I think getting right at what’s the need, what’s their value proposition, and 
how they’re the best at it, and let us ask questions.
Jo Anne Miller, Partner, Milk Street Ventures
Jo Anne Miller, a telecommunications/IT industry expert, has been, by turns, 
responsible for Nokia’s portfolio of relationships, CEO of Gluon Networks 
(a startup providing voice/data-switching management systems for local tele-
phone service providers), and now a partner at Milk Street Ventures (a special-
ized VC firm). She’s also an investor in Sand Hill Angels and managing partner of 
Golden Seeds (see the later interview of Stephanie Hanbury-Brown).
Bob: You actually wear more than a few hats in the venture capital/angel 
world. Let’s start with the angel side of things.
Jo Anne: OK.
Bob: One of the parts of that particular puzzle is getting their first chunk of 
outside funding. It seems, more and more, the right people they should be 
talking to for that are angel investors rather than VCs.
Jo Anne: Well, I think it depends on what kind of company and how much 
capital they’re going to require and how far along they’ve been able to get 
themselves without looking for outside capital.
Bob: Let’s say that they’ve got themselves an actual application. They’ve got 
perhaps even the start of a revenue base, and they’re looking for something 
like $500,000, plus or minus $250,000. Would angels be the right place to 
go rather than VCs?
Jo Anne: Well, they would certainly be “a” place to go. If they’re looking for 
half a million and then they think they’re going to need another million in a 
year; if they look at their total capital requirements and they’re probably 
looking at under 3 million, then I think angels are a really great place to start.
I’m only saying that because I think that angels, for a while, have sort of 
substituted for early-stage VC. But I just heard numbers today that said that 
early-stage VCs are actually putting as much money to work as angels.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
170
I think if you are a first-time entrepreneur, I would start with angels. If you 
are a more experienced entrepreneur and you have other companies or 
you’ve been engaged with other companies, I would look at both angels and 
early-stage venture capitalists sort of equally.
Bob: What sort of odds does a first-time founder in our current, sort of 
post–boom times economy have with angels?
Jo Anne: One of the things that angels will do—angels will not be as risk-
averse with a first-time entrepreneur as VCs will. That’s my personal expe-
rience, because most angels are prepared to do a lot of measuring and a lot 
of active engagement with the company in trying to help them, as well as 
provide money. Even though venture capitalists will always want to help their 
companies, there are fewer hours for that measuring process, and there is 
more risk aversion, I think, with a first-time entrepreneur in a venture capi-
talist firm.
So it’s hard to say what the odds are. I know that with an angel you may see 
30, 40 deals a year, and you may fund five. You’re not going to fund more 
than one a month, probably one every two months. So, five, six, I would say, 
would be probably the maximum that would be funded in a year by an angel 
group.
Bob: When founders make presentations to angels, what’s the biggest mistake 
they tend to make over and over?
Jo Anne: Well, I think when entrepreneurs present to anybody, they need 
to understand everybody’s motivation, the people in the audience’s motiva-
tion. With venture capitalists that is “How are you going to help me make 
money?” With angels it’s “How are you going to help me make money, and 
how are you going to make this be an interesting engagement for me?”
Bob: Well, lots of people have lots of good ideas. But how big an idea or 
how big a market potential does an angel investor basically set as the floor? 
In other words, are we talking about 10 times their potential investment? 
Fifty times their initial investment?
Jo Anne: Because angels are investing their own money rather than someone 
else’s money in a fund, they are able to look at flexible rates of return over 
the time frame. Clearly, everybody’s greedy and would like a bigger return. 
But angels don’t have to have as large a market as many venture capitalists 
do, because they don’t have to return to other people. They don’t have to 
have the outsized returns for their limited capital.
Very often, angels will be satisfied with closer to a targeted 10x return, espe-
cially if they can foresee that return’s coming sooner rather than later. If 
you’re talking about bringing an angel into a pharmaceutical company, it’s 
going to be a long way away. You’re going to require a lot of capital, and 
you’re going to get diluted along the way. They’re going to look for the same 
kind of private market and outsized return that a venture capitalist is going 
to look for.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
171
But if you’re talking about a software company that might be able to be exited 
within five years, and you could get a 5x to 10x return within five years, and 
that is going to need 3 million to 5 million total capital in order to get there, 
then you don’t necessarily have to have a huge, billion-dollar market.
Bob: There seems to be a lot more angel investors now than there were, 
let’s say, two or three years ago. Is that correct?
Jo Anne: There are certainly a lot more angel investors than there were 
10 years ago, and there are some more angel investors than there were two 
to three years ago. I saw statistics today, from the Angel Capital Association 
[http://www.angelcapitalassociation.org], that the average size of an 
angel investment in 2008 was $262,000.
Bob: Is Golden Seeds a network of investors or a single organization? I couldn’t 
really figure that out.
Jo Anne: Golden Seeds was founded in New York. But you’ll find Golden 
Seeds no matter where you are. There are four associations of meeting groups, 
one in Boston, one in Philadelphia, one in New York, and now one in San 
Francisco.
Bob: I guess there’s two ways that I could look at this. One is, it’s redressing 
the imbalance of how many women there are who are CEOs of software 
companies. Or is it a case that now that there are so many more women in 
the industry, this is sort of the natural culmination of that growth of women 
in the industry?
Jo Anne: Those who invest in women entrepreneurs are soft spaces. So we 
have women in life science, women in technology, women in consumer 
products, software IT, across all spaces. Our only criterion is that there is a 
woman founder or a woman CEO or a woman in another major team–level 
position.
That criterion is there because we think that women still only receive some-
thing south of 7% of the venture capital investments in the United States today. 
So we’re looking for ways of helping the funding and mentoring to create 
more great women with capital.
Bob: But it’s not altruism. There’s the same . . .
Jo Anne: No, no, no. Believe me, at Golden Seeds, we invest . . .
Bob: I used the A word there, I guess.
Jo Anne: This is no charity. There’s no altruism. This is about investment. 
We’re investment bankers looking at it from the perspective of helping to 
make us money.
Bob: How should founders approach angels? Yes, they can e-mail them out 
of the clear blue sky, but what’s a more intelligent way of doing it than that?
Jo Anne: We get deals three ways. We get introduced to people who know 
what we’re doing and they know a women entrepreneur. They e-mail an 
introduction saying, “Here’s a great entrepreneur. I think you ought to talk 
to them.” We’ll talk to them and find out what stage they’re at, what they’re 
about, and give them advice as to whether or not we think they are an investable 
idea in the place they’re at, and ask them to then go ahead and apply.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
172
We use Angelsoft [http://angelsoft.net] as our deal-training and deal-
management software and ask them to apply through Angelsoft. Startups will 
find out about us and just apply through Angelsoft, or we’ll actually meet 
somebody somewhere along the way, which is sort of a personal introduc-
tion. So, e-mail, Angelsoft, personal introduction.
Bob: Finally, what one or two things can a founder looking for investment 
do to really improve their odds? Is there any one thing that would improve 
their chances more than anything else?
Jo Anne: I think all entrepreneurs need to put themselves, for a few minutes, 
in the investor’s shoes and think, “How is this going to not just save the world, 
but make money for an investor?” So that means, what’s the pricing model 
that is required? What’s my sweat equity? What problem am I solving?
I saw a very interesting situation last week at a training meeting. Beautiful 
stuff, a very interesting person from a team, dynamic perspective, we were 
very impressed. But she never told us what her revenue model was. So we 
had to go back and work with her on understanding how she prices that, what 
the revenue model is. She was all about the product and how the product 
team is great. But how she was going to make money for the company and, 
ultimately, how we were going to make money was lacking.
Bob: So one of the key fundamental things is that the founders have to get 
outside the shell of their startup. They have to understand the motivation of 
the people they’re asking money from.
Jo Anne: Right, exactly. I don’t know anyone who is investing just to have a 
social effect with an entrepreneur. This is not going to help people out of 
poverty. This is an investment decision. This is about making money.
Bob: One thing that’s always kind of puzzled me is when a company comes 
to you and says, with a straight face, “We have no revenue yet, but we project 
the following numbers five years out.” Are those numbers taken at all seriously?
Jo Anne: I think the only part of it ever taken seriously is the process that 
the entrepreneur goes through to create those numbers, because it gives 
you an insight into their mental ability. But the numbers are meaningless, in 
general.
It depends on how close people are to having some revenue. If somebody 
comes in with an idea on paper and says, “I think if I can do this and this, I 
can result in this much revenue.” That’s very different than somebody who 
says, “I’ve got this prototype, and I just signed these agreements to launch 
the prototype, therefore these revenues are anticipated. I can show you 
our P/L.”
That’s one thing. But those are two very different things, and I’ve seen both 
situations.
Bob: Anything else I should ask you?

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
173
Jo Anne: I don’t know. I think that putting yourself in the feet of the investor is 
a very important thing for an entrepreneur to do. The team is very impor-
tant because, frequently, what the product is and what the market is changes 
as things develop. So the team is very important, and market is very impor-
tant—whatever you have done to validate your market and to show that the 
problem that you are solving is a real problem, and being realistic about who 
your competition is and might be. Those are all key criteria.
Cindy Padnos, Managing Director, Illuminate Ventures
Cindy Padnos is the founding managing partner of Illuminate Ventures, a 
startup VC fund focusing on women-led startups. With over 20 years of 
experience as a VC and a CEO of a software company, Cindy shares her 
experience about what gets startup founders venture capital.
Bob: What does a startup need today to be seriously considered for funding?
Cindy: Really today? Or you do mean over the longer period that you’d 
suspect?
Bob: Well, I have to think that the easy money of, let’s say, 2007 and maybe 
part of 2008 and before, that’s kind of gone. Now, maybe I’m wrong in that. 
And please correct me. You know and I don’t.
Cindy: No, I think any category, though, tends to overreact, you know, 
whether that would be consumers overreacting to a downturn in the economy 
or investors overreacting to, you know, the unavailability of an IPOS tech 
market. So people do tend to overreact. And sometimes that will last a little 
bit longer than you expected. But it doesn’t last forever. If it lasted forever, 
we wouldn’t have had the easier years—let’s put it that way—of maybe 
2006–08 for startups to raise capital because investors would still be remem-
bering 2001–03, when it was, you know, nuclear winter and you couldn’t 
find capital for your company. Right?
Bob: So there are seasons in this game, I’d guess you’d say?
Cindy: I would say, like many other industries, it can be a bit cyclical. Yes.
Bob: Well, then I guess that’s the question. Maybe it’s one that’s not just for 
right now, but just in general: What does a startup need to be considered— 
seriously considered—for funding?
Cindy: Well, I think the question depends on what kind of funding we’re 
talking about. So, if we’re going to assume venture funding for a minute, I 
think that you’re talking about a company that has to have identified a large 
underserved target market segment. That segment can be defined by geog-
raphy or by a product need or by the user type or, you know, by a variety 
of different factors. But it needs to be a substantial market opportunity that 
you can build a large business, not just a product, around. I think it has to 
have a credible team.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
174
And credible doesn’t necessarily mean a serial entrepreneur. But it means 
people who are bringing some combination of skills and experience to the 
table that allow that company to demonstrate that they have, you know, as 
an example, either deep market knowledge or deep technical expertise or 
great channel or distribution relationships, some kind of advantage that makes 
it logical for them to be targeted in that sector.
And so the credible team might have worked together before. They might 
have worked in startup environments before. There’s going to have to be 
some combination of those factors. It doesn’t have to be all of them, but 
some combination of those factors that make them a very credible team. So, 
big market, strong team that makes sense, and some demonstrated need in 
the market, I guess it’s really maybe those three needs, those three things.
Bob: It’s kind of interesting to me, being more of a developer-type person, 
that you don’t mention in that list groundbreaking technology or innovative 
application. That seems to be less important?
Cindy: Well, I’m not sure that’s—I think it’s all about how you talk about 
things. So, as an example, I said it’s got to be something people really need. 
And it’s got to be a large market. Well, in order for something to—you 
know, a product and offering, whatever it might be—to be something people 
really need and a large market, the likelihood is that it’s groundbreaking in 
one way or another. It may not be the newest technology. It may be a really 
differentiated business model. It may be a distribution strategy that’s, you 
know, very economically advantaged.
It’s not always purely about technology. But that certainly is a component of 
it. But there are times when there’s just overall shifts in technology, right? 
Like when we went from main frames to client servers, and client server to 
the Internet, and the Internet to, you know—are we now at cloud computing? 
I don’t know.
Bob: Getting there.
Cindy: Yeah, exactly. So my point is that those are kind of, you know, 
paradigm-shifting kind of underlying technologies. Sometimes it’s just the 
same old application built on top of a new platform. I would say, you know, 
Salesforce.com is an interesting example of taking advantage of two things. 
It wasn’t groundbreaking technology. But it was leveraging new technology, 
meaning the whole on-demand software as a service technology, in combi-
nation with a pay-as-you-go pricing mechanism that made the products that 
they built much more economical and accessible to a much broader market.
Bob: If you’re creating a startup and you don’t happen to be part of the 
Silicon Valley culture—in other words, you don’t live somewhere between 
San Francisco and San Jose—what’s the best way to approach venture capi-
talists? I mean, unsolicited e-mail does not seem the best way to do it.
Cindy: Well, I would say there are two answers to your question. One is, a 
venture capitalist is not always the right answer. And I don’t think that’s really 
your question.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
175
Bob: OK.
Cindy: So I’m not going to go too far down that path. But the reality is that 
in the world we live in today, you can frequently bootstrap a company using 
Open Source technologies to get, to build a business in what could be a very 
attractive lucrative business for a small team and might never be an attrac-
tive venture investment.
So the first thing I would do is think really long and hard about whether you 
need venture capital or not, whether it’s really the right way to go. If you’re 
trying to build a big business that’s going to be competitive on a national or 
a worldwide scale, then, sure, you may need capital to do that. And if you’re 
in, you know, Grand Rapids, Michigan, or you’re in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, 
whatever it may be, you know, there are typically business angels in those 
communities to help you get started.
Beyond that, there are frequently nationwide law firms who have practices 
both here in Silicon Valley, and in Boston and New York, which are other 
hubs of venture communities, that can make introductions for you. So use 
your network of who you went to school with, service providers, and national 
account firms with offices in all of these locations. These folks can and will 
make introductions, and that can be very meaningful in terms of getting you 
real access to Silicon Valley or other venture capital firms who may not be 
in your local community.
Bob: So, really, if you don’t have a network, perhaps it’s time to build one. 
That’s what I’m hearing.
Cindy: Absolutely. Unsolicited e-mail is the easiest thing for an investor 
to ignore.
Bob: What does Illuminate Ventures invest in? What’s the story there? I am 
frantically looking for the URL right now, and I’m not finding one.
Cindy: [laughs] You won’t find it. We’re a brand new firm that is just in the 
process of launching, so you won’t find a URL today. I have been an investor 
since 2004 with Outlook Ventures, for which you will find a URL, where you 
will find my bio. But Outlook is not raising a new fund at this point, and I 
actually made the decision to launch a new firm, which is Illuminate Ventures, 
which will have an intentional focus on expanding our deal flow to be more 
inclusive of high-tech companies founded or led by women entrepreneurs.
Bob: So I guess it would be fair to say that you are a startup VC.
Cindy: I’m a startup VC. But I was a founder and CEO myself. I’ve been out 
there raising venture capital. This won’t make me an entrepreneur for the 
first time.
Bob: I can understand the focus that you’re going after. I presume that you 
think there’s a real need for this type of venture capital firm. Are women 
discriminated today against in the VC world?
Cindy: I don’t think that would be a fair representation of it. I think the reality 
is that venture capital is a world in which your network and your relation-
ships make a tremendous amount of difference. It goes back to the question

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
176
you were asking a minute ago. If you don’t have a network, it’s time to build 
one. That is true, but it is not easy to do overnight.
When you look at the dollars that are going into venture capital today, less 
than 3% of that in 2007 went into companies with women CEOs. If you add 
all the companies that had women cofounders—and I’m talking about in high 
tech—that number still goes up to under 10%. I think it’s 6 or 7%. Then if 
you step out and look at what percentage of women are graduating from 
MBA programs, what percentage of women are officers of high-tech compa-
nies that have IPOs or big MNA assets, the number is certainly not 50%, but 
it is significantly higher and growing at a very substantial rate.
And so what I actually see is not an intentional bias or a need for women to 
have a handout or something else. I see an opportunity to frankly convince 
them to support women in a very unique way. By focusing on that market 
sector it will give us an opportunity to see the absolute best companies in 
that category. We’re putting together an amazing advisory group to support 
that effort. It includes very successful women, entrepreneurs, investors, corpo-
rate executives in high-tech, etc. And not only women, but with a focus being 
perhaps stronger by identifying and having those folks participate in this process.
So for us it’s about great deal flow. It’s about great opportunities. It’s not 
about lowering the bar for women.
Bob: From what you’ve said, I would actually think that you see an untapped 
resource, if you will. There is this network of women, and there is this differ-
ence between the venture capital firms that are out there now and what the 
reality is on the ground.
Cindy: That’s exactly right. There are so many different things that you can 
attribute that to. Women have not built the same networks. If you even look 
at just the last 20 years of what percentage of the graduating classes at Stanford 
and Harvard—I got my masters at Carnegie Mellon—were women. I know 
my graduating class was under 15% women. Those numbers have changed 
pretty dramatically today. I think the average MBA program today is 35% 
women. It’s still not 50%, but gaining traction. If you look at things like soft-
ware patent filings, the percentage of women’s names on them has grown 
astronomically over the last 10 years. Now, we are talking about who the 
very people are who have the skills, capabilities, and interest to go out and 
found companies.
Bob: Speaking as a white male, somewhat overweight person, I don’t want 
to sound like I don’t think people like me are good, but it’s just that I think 
there’s a lot to be said for diversity. I think that, from the get-go, this industry 
has taken a long time to grow up.
Cindy: Well, if you think about it, in the end this is a partnership business. 
In any partnership, that can take an extensive amount of time. This is an 
industry where the life cycle of a fund is 10 years on average. It is unlike a 
law partnership, where if someone doesn’t perform or get along with the 
team or whatever it may be, that may change very rapidly. That can’t happen. 

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
177
The contracts and the complications of creating a venture fund are such that 
the transitions happen much more slowly, and there are a lot of dollars 
involved.
Even if you look at it today, there are fewer women partners in venture 
capital firms than there were back in 2000. Part of the reason for that is that 
when all of these firms were forced to downsize the size of their fund . . .
Bob: . . . the newest got cut first.
Cindy: That’s right, because it’s a partnership. There’s nobody to blame for 
it. It’s just a reality. Now we’re just struggling back to where things were 
even 10 years ago.
Bob: One thing really strikes me about what you’ve said. I won’t say it’s the 
most critical factor, but if you are a founder, if you don’t have a trusted network 
and the ability to build a trusted network of people who can connect with 
funding sources, your odds are just not very good. It’s just that simple.
Cindy: Yeah, I agree. It’s much, much harder.
Bob: You’ve sat through a lot of presentations from startups looking for 
funding. What are the really bonehead mistakes you’ve seen over and over 
again?
Cindy: Oh, there’s quite a few that you could pick from.
Bob: Maybe we should ask, what would be the things that make for a really 
impressive presentation to you? There’s always the question, does a busi-
ness plan really make any difference?
Cindy: Well, I guess I could give you both sides of the equation. In terms of 
what can really impress an investor, I think it is how well prepared the team 
is, how consistent they are in their message. There are both sides of the 
equation here. When a team comes in and they’re always contradicting one 
another or talking over the top of each other, you wonder and you worry 
about if this is a team that can work well together and whether they have 
made a decision about what they’re going to focus on, do, and build.
I love to hear entrepreneurs come in and talk about their prospects or 
customers and the information they’ve gathered from them, rather than the 
greatest technology ever that they’ve developed, that they have no customer or 
user feedback on. I think that can be quite significant. The references that an 
individual can share of, not just prior success, but being able to recruit people 
onto the team that they worked with previously are very telling. If you have 
an entrepreneur who is having trouble building her team from the very begin-
ning, that is going to cause some question marks. I look for people who 
surround themselves with other great people.
Bob: Any advice that you would give, other than that we already have covered, 
to founders when they are going to go for that first round of outside invest-
ment, whether they’re talking to angels or VCs?
Cindy: I think there’s several things. One, I think that entrepreneurs should 
be as careful about who they take money from as investors are about whom 
they give money to.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
178
Bob: That makes sense.
Cindy: By that I mean that they should be doing their own reference checks. 
They should be calling the CEOs or founders of companies that these inves-
tors have invested in and talk to them about things like, “Well, Dash, when 
you had your first tough quarter and didn’t make the numbers, how did they 
react?” That includes talking to people where the company did not succeed 
in the end. I think those are really important things for an entrepreneur to do.
Stephanie Hanbury-Brown, Founder and Managing 
Director, Golden Seeds
After 20 years in financial services in Sydney, London, and New York, Stephanie 
Hanbury-Brown founded Golden Seeds (http://www.goldenseeds.com), 
an angel investor group focused on women-led startups. Since its launch in 2004, 
it has grown to monthly angel investor screening meetings and entrepreneurial 
training sessions and other events in San Francisco, Boston, Philadelphia, and 
New York. I talked with Stephanie about Golden Seeds: its mission, and her 
take on the angel investment scene.
Bob: Can you tell me more about what Golden Seeds does?
Stephanie: We’re an angel investor group, of which there are quite a few 
across the country, and we’re fairly typical of the majority of angel groups in 
the country. If you know how angel groups operate, let me know because 
that will save me from saying to you stuff that you already know.
Bob: I know how angels operate but not necessarily angel groups. Is it a 
pooled sharing of risk and capital?
Stephanie: There are a couple of different models. So one model is that the 
angels will put their money into a fund and then review deals and vote on 
which deals the fund will invest in. A more typical model, which is like us, is 
that a group of individuals review, evaluate, invest together, and support the 
companies together, but each is more or less operating as an individual. So, 
investors decide which deal they want to go into, how much they are going 
to put in. They’ll invest directly in the company, and one of them will go on 
the board to represent all of them.
Bob: OK.
Stephanie: That’s how we operate.
Bob: How many investors do you have, and do you make your investment 
numbers public?
Stephanie: Yes, we have 110 members, and we’ve invested just over 
$10 million in the four years that we have been operating. They are public in 
that if you go to angelsoft.net you can see angel groups around the country. 
And there’s quite a lot of data that’s in there that includes how much has 
been invested in the last 12 months, how many applications a group received. If 
you go to angelsoft.net and look on “group finder,” I think that the first 
thing you will see is groups in your location that you could ultimately . . .

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
179
There might be a way. I haven’t tried it, but you could probably say, you 
know, most active groups in the U.S. or something. I’m sure you could sort 
of find that out. We would be one of those.
Bob: What does your group or your investors look for from startups today? 
Has the bar gone up from, let’s say, where it was a year ago?
Stephanie: It depends on which bar you are referring to. The bar that is 
about valuation of the company has gone down.
Bob: OK. So, what companies are worth—estimates kind of dropped like 
property prices.
Stephanie: But I can’t say that the bar has gone up because we were not 
investing in poor-quality companies 12 months ago. But what has gone up is 
the quality of deals that we see. Largely that’s because companies that did 
not think they would need more capital now feel that they do need more 
capital, so raising capital when they might not have otherwise been going to 
do that.
Bob: How much would you say a first-time startup founder is typically likely 
to get from an angel group like Golden Seeds?
Stephanie: You know, it’s typically between $300,000 and $700,000. We’ve 
put as much as $1 million into a first-round, early-stage deal. But it’s more 
normal for us to do somewhere in that range of 300 to 750, let’s say. So it 
depends a lot on what the entrepreneur needs, and it depends a lot on what 
the company is valued at when she is raising money, because if she needs a 
lot of money, then it’s probably better to take it in small chunks so that she 
doesn’t get diluted too much.
Bob: Does Golden Seeds, given its mission, only invest in women-led startups? 
If that’s not the case, maybe, you can tell me what is the case.
Stephanie: We invest in companies that have a woman founder who still 
has a C-level operating position with the company and has significant equity. 
So she might be the CEO. If she was not the founding CEO, then she prob-
ably had been brought in and, therefore, might only have as much as 10% of 
the company. We’d be reluctant to invest if she has less than that, and it’s 
more typical for our founders to have closer to 40% or 50%.
Bob: How would you characterize Golden Seeds when it comes to this 
question of investing in women-led companies? I understand from your site 
the need, the desire, the focus. But is it that you found a way to differentiate 
yourself from other angel investor groups or more that there’s really an 
underrepresentation of women you are trying to address here?
Stephanie: It’s because of the underrepresentation, and it’s created sort of 
a niche investment strategy, which means that you do get to see your best 
field in your niche. So it’s both of those. But the underrepresentation is that 
only between naught and 6% are venture capital dollars in any one year that 
go to women entrepreneurs. Angel money, it could be higher, closer to 13%. 
One of the issues is that not enough women entrepreneurs are out there 
looking for capital, for whatever reason. Maybe they are not interested in 

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
180
growing a company or don’t know about it or don’t have the right connec-
tions. So it is a combination of all of those things. But we feel that we are 
serving an underserved market as a starting point.
Bob: How should a startup go about securing angel capital from a group like 
Golden Seeds? That’s a really large question, I realize. You can take either 
the positive way, the things they should do, or, maybe, the negative way, 
some of the things they shouldn’t do.
Stephanie: Well, we have sort of a screening process. And because we are 
working with an underserved market, we place less emphasis on the need to 
have a warm introduction, because if you talk to a lot of investors they’ll say, 
“Oh, you definitely need to get a warm introduction so that if one of the 
partners in this fund or one of the principals running the group knows you, 
you really want to be sponsored.” We recognize that women don’t neces-
sarily have those connections, as one of the things holding them back, so we 
look at every single application very closely. We will say to them, “It is valu-
able if one of our members already knows your company or might have even 
invested in it.” So do that if you can, but it’s not a prerequisite by any means.
Bob: OK.
Stephanie: And so the thing that is important is to make sure that they’ve 
read our web site, understand the criteria, and know what to put in and 
pitch to investors. It’s fairly easy to find this stuff out, a little bit of research 
and going to a couple of venture capital fairs or forums where you see entre-
preneurs pitch to investors. That bit of homework, I think, is well worth 
doing. Having said that, if they come into us fairly unprepared, we will give them 
feedback and tell them, “You haven’t blown your chances. Here’s your feed-
back. If you can fix some of these things, we’ll definitely have another look.”
Bob: So there’s no mystery. There’s no magic. It’s a matter of homework 
and being ready.
Stephanie: Yes and, well, having a great business.
Bob: That helps.
Stephanie: Those two things—great management team, great business plan—
those are the two things that matter most. I don’t mean a plan in terms of 
the paper. I mean in terms of what they’re doing.
Bob: If it’s not a business plan in terms of paper, do you mean basically their 
business structure in terms of how they are going to make money?
Stephanie: No, I basically mean whatever product they are trying to sell to 
customers, “Is this really, really compelling need that the customer has?” If 
it is, then people are going to buy it, and then they are going to start gener-
ating revenue. Then it’s all going to fall into place very quickly. So that’s really 
the main thing, that they have something really unique and different that they 
are trying to sell.
Bob: OK. Do they need to be selling it already to be considered in today’s 
economic marketplace, or can they be pretty much . . .
Stephanie: Yeah, it makes it easier. It definitely makes it easier, because having 
a couple, even one or two, paying customers lowers the risk for investors and 

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
181
sort of validates that there’s somebody out there who is paying real dollars 
to buy the product. Having said that, there are investors at both ends of the 
spectrum, and plenty of people are willing to make a bet alongside an entre-
preneur with an idea that they have—if they think this is a very compelling 
product and if they think the idea is really good and if they think the entre-
preneur is really able to take it to the next level. It’s not a “must-have.” It 
just increases your chances of getting funding.
Bob: Any final advice for founders who are still trepidacious about seeking 
venture capital?
Stephanie: Speak to other CEOs who have done it. They are going to be 
the best source of information about who was a good investor; how you go 
about finding the money, how long it took, what they had to give in on in 
order to get the capital, what they wished they had done differently. I really 
think that’s the best thing, so, really, getting good input from peers would be 
very valuable.
Bob: Good advice. Thank you, Stephanie.
Startup Incubators
To close out this section about raising capital, it’s time to have a look at 
just a few of the startup incubators out there. As I said in Chapter 1, you 
can definitely make the case that the modern, post-dot-com era of startups 
began in 2005, when Paul Graham, Robert Morris, Trevor Blackwell, and 
Jessica Livingston founded Y Combinator (Figure 5-3).
Figure 5-3. Y Combinator

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
182
Here’s how Y Combinator works: Twice a year—from January through 
March and June through August—some 20 to 30 startup founders, most 
of them in their 20s, who’ve made the cut and cut the deal move to the 
San Francisco Bay Area to work full time on their startups, attend weekly 
dinners with primed investors, startup CEOs, and featured speakers, and 
get the business equivalent of an immersive language course where they 
eat, breathe, and drink “startup” 24/7. The deal part of this, in addition 
to the immersive program, getting these startups properly incorporated, 
and opening doors to prospective angels and VCs, is that Y Combinator 
provides something less than $20,000 funding for each startup in exchange 
for somewhere between 2% and 6% equity. As of May 2009, 118 startups 
had launched through Y Combinator, including RescueTime.com, whose 
cofounder Tony Wright talks about the experience in Chapter 7.13
Nor is Y Combinator the only entity out there to realize that there’s 
money being left on the table by traditional VCs and angels: providing pre-
seed funding of $5,000 or $10,000 in exchange for 5–10% of the founders’ 
stock might be all that’s needed to make some respectable money. Here 
are some of the other incubators out there.
■NextStart (http://www.nextstart.org), based in Greenville, South 
Carolina, offers a summer immersion entrepreneur program providing 
startup founders with 12 weeks of office space, Internet connectivity, 
and professional services.
■Shotput Ventures (http://www.shotputventures.com), in Atlanta, 
Georgia, was, as of May 2009, gearing up to help 8–10 teams of one 
to two persons launch their “capital-light” startups in summer 2009.
■NYC SeedStart (http://www.nycseed.com/seedstart.html) is an 
eight-week summer program in the Big Apple where 10 groups of 
two to four founders will find funding, mentorship, and access to 
New York City–based angels and VCs. NYC SeedStart is an outgrowth 
of NYC Seed, a public–private partnership focused on promoting 
manufacturing and technology companies in New York City.
■LaunchBox Digital (http://www.launchboxdigital.com), in Wash-
ington, D.C., had nine startups in its first summer program, in 2008; 
five of them have gone on to receive angel and VC funding.
13 You might be wondering where the Paul Graham and Jessica Livingston interviews are. Unfortu-
nately, neither Paul nor Jessica was available during the two-month period I’d planned to interview 
them—totally my fault, not theirs.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
183
■Capital Factory (http://www.capitalfactory.com), based in 
Austin, Texas, screened over 250 applicants before picking five 
companies that would kick off its first summer program, in 2009. 
Each company gets—for 5% of their stock—$20,000 in funding, 
$20,000 in professional services, and 10 weeks of intense profes-
sional mentoring, culminating in a Demo Day during which each 
startup will strut its stuff to investors and the press.
■ TechStars (http://www.techstars.org) describes itself as a 
mentorship-driven seed-stage investment fund that each summer 
will invest in about 20 startups (split between Boston and Boulder, 
Colorado), who, in exchange for a 6% equity stake, will get intensive 
help and the chance to pitch to a select group of angel investors 
and VCs.
■iAccelerator (http://iaccelerator.org), proving that startup 
incubators are not uniquely American, is a four-month intensive 
program designed to establish successful Indian tech companies by 
providing guidance, business connections, and funding. It is sponsored 
by the Indian Institute of Management at Ahmedabad’s Incubation 
Center (CIIE).
Here’s a prediction for you: There will be more, a lot more, startup 
incubators. Startup incubators make a great deal of sense for the entre-
preneurial investors who want not only to fund startups but to help them 
succeed. It’s a structured approach to what has in the past been very hit 
and miss: the process of turning developers into founders.
Managing the Money
If this book were an encyclopedia rather than a guided tour to Startupism, 
the accounting and general finance sections would be among the thick-
est and dullest entries. It’s hard to get excited about setting up a chart of 
accounts, keeping Board of Director minutes, and filing annual owner-
ship declarations.
Online resources abound for this kind of information: In the United 
States, the Small Business Administration (http://www.sba.gov) will give 
it to you straight; Business Link (http://www.businesslink.gov.uk) is 
where you start in the U.K.; and in the EU, have a look at the EC’s SME 
Portal at http://ec.europa.eu/enterprise/sme/index_en.htm. In fact, 
it’s a pretty safe bet that wherever you are in the world, a local or national 
government web site is just waiting to help you understand what you’re 
going to need to do business.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
184
Furthermore, between great sites such as StartupNation (http://
www.startupnation.com), the resources put online by business publica-
tions ranging from BusinessWeek to your local newspaper (if it’s still in 
business), the 5,119 books you’ll find at Amazon under “small business 
accounting,” let alone the 130,560 results you will find there for “small 
business,” I can’t help but feel that the mechanics of finance and account-
ing have been well and truly covered.
Instead of putting you into a coma, I called on two people who really 
do have a burning passion for these subjects to talk about some of the 
things you should watch out for. I chose these two individuals not just 
because they’re walking, talking legal/financial startup encyclopedias, 
but because they are perfect examples of the kinds of legal and financial 
advisors you need to seek out and with whom to build a relationship to 
succeed as a startup.
Gene Landy, Attorney and Author of IT/Digital 
Legal Companion
In Chapter 4 we talked with Gene Landy, author of the IT/Digital Legal Companion 
(Syngress, 2008), about the proper care and feeding of Open Source code in 
your startup. But most of Gene’s workload has to do with aligning legal ducks 
in a row for his startup clients at the Boston law firm Ruberto, Israel & Weiner, 
P.C. Here we turn the conversation to some of the things a startup needs to 
know to get funded, to incorporate correctly, to find an attorney, and more. 
Gene’s answers deal with the general case; you’re going to want to consult 
your startup’s attorney on all the issues he raises and more.
Bob: What sort of things should a startup do to make themselves angel-
investor fundable?
Gene: Well, I hate to tell you the most important things aren’t legal. An 
investor will give you some slack to fix legal problems, if you have a dynamite 
application that hundreds of thousands of millions of people are using, right?
Bob: OK.
Gene: I think having legal noncompliance can really mess you up, but having 
perfect legal compliance cannot make you a success.
Bob: OK.
Gene: What makes you really successful is having a marketable product that 
the market really needs. If you sort of think about it, if you had a product 
that was no better than a product that’s commercially available and not much 
cheaper, you would be crazy to deal with a startup because startups are thinly 
capitalized often. They don’t often have a lot of personnel. They’re often 
dependent on a key person, so if somebody dies, they’ll disappear. 

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
185
They might go bankrupt, and so forth and so on. There are a lot of risks in 
dealing with startups. So you normally will deal with a startup, if you’re a 
customer, if the solution is compelling.
Bob: Well, does it make a difference, for purposes of raising capital, whether 
you’re an S Corp or an LLC?
Gene: Yeah, sure does. Usually, the rule, basically, is that, as a practical 
matter, institutional investors don’t want to invest in anything other than a 
C corporation, which is sort of the normal, default kind of company. LLCs 
and S corporations are mostly designed for either small service companies 
or, in some cases, for some private investors. They might have some kind of 
tax-shelter function; that is, they might be able to generate losses that an 
investor can use. But usually a company that’s an investment target that’s 
going to raise venture capital or going to get money from strategic investors 
like customers, they’re going to be a C corporation, and even if they started 
out life as an LLC or an S corporation, they’re probably going to convert.
Bob: So they can start off with a little more lightweight LLC and then convert 
to a C corporation?
Gene: Yeah. Although, it’s not that much lighter-weight. [laughs]
Bob: So maybe they should just bite the bullet and become a full-fledged 
corporation.
Gene: Yeah. That’s right. Because an LLC has some simplicity in terms of 
tax: you’re basically taxed as a partnership. But the LLC agreement itself is 
more complicated than forming a corporation. Corporate law does a lot of 
things for you that you have to do by agreement with an LLC. And there are 
tax issues with LLC. So, certainly, when you start getting investors, you have 
to worry about stock options. And an LLC can earn money. If it’s money 
that stays in the LLC but is not distributed, you’ll be taxed on it anyway. So 
there are issues with LLCs.
Bob: OK.
Gene: You just have to talk to a tax accountant and make sure you know 
what you’re getting into and whether it works for you. Usually, product 
companies want to raise money, and they usually shouldn’t be LLCs. Service 
companies are much more likely to fit into that LLC mode.
Bob: Is a web service a service or a product?
Gene: In my scenario, a web company would be a product company, even 
though . . .
Bob: . . . even though it looks like a service to developers. Right.
Gene: It looks like a service company. What I mean as a service company, I 
mean it’s a company that has a business model that is a professional service 
model, where they don’t have to build a lot of stuff and they can start generating 
money on day one, and they don’t have a lot of, especially, built-up capital or 
investment in their product. They’re basically selling their time, right? Like 
some company that maybe does maintenance, or some company that does 
custom development, and doesn’t have a product base, right? Those compa-
nies can function very well as quasi-partnerships, for tax purposes. But once 

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
186
you’ve started to invest a lot of money and you have capital and you need 
money to build up your infrastructure, that’s when you need money.
So that would be true of a traditional software company. It would also be 
true of a software-as-a-service company that, from an operational point 
of view, they’re a service, but they sure look a lot like a company that’s a 
product company.
Bob: OK. How should a founder of a startup company find an attorney that 
does this? I mean, is there just a few people in the world that do it and they 
stick to them, or should they find somebody that they’ve already dealt with 
legally? What’s the algorithm there, if you will?
Gene: I think there are two kinds of tasks that the attorneys do for you, and 
one is much more commoditized, and the other is much less. The one that’s 
more commoditized is forming your company or doing your first deal with 
a venture capital or angel investor and so forth and so on. Lots and lots 
of companies know how to do that, because I would consider that sort of 
primarily legal.
What’s harder is knowing how, for example, to do an online media distribu-
tion deal or how to do a deal for embedding software in a mobile phone 
product, mobile device, right? With those deals, you really need to have a 
much deeper understanding of both the intellectual property and the tech-
nology. And so there are fewer lawyers that have that skill set, because many 
lawyers have, essentially, a liberal arts education and haven’t spent a lot of 
time really learning how technology works.
So, depending on your business model, you really want to look for some-
body who’s kind of done it before or something similar to what you’ve done 
before, particularly when you get beyond the kind of basics of formation and 
they’re really doing your key deals.
What’s a deal for a company could be very different. If you are a consumer 
product, maybe a deal is just putting your stuff online and I think people pay 
you with a credit card. But for many startup companies, there is a key strategic 
relationship they make that kind of makes or breaks the company: Their deal 
with Verizon, their deal with IBM or whatever, this is where they develop a 
channel and they get them to buy a lot of product and maybe invest some 
money, and then you need somebody who really understands your business.
Bob: So the key thing is somebody who understands your business, who 
understands the particulars of the deal that you are trying to put together?
Gene: That’s right. I mean I don’t want to overgeneralize here, but we find 
that people in cities that don’t have a technology business base often don’t 
have a lot of familiarity with how things work, particularly with regard to 
things other than—a lot of places around the country where people consume 
business software. So in most cities, their lawyers are people who would 
know how to license in or license out a business application. But that’s very 
different than licensing software that will live in semiconductors, where we 
embed it in a system or firmware or something like that. And that’s also very 

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
187
different than somebody who knows how to do media distribution or license 
widgets to be put into an application that would be server based and provide 
the service as well.
It is much more likely that people who know how to do that would be in the 
technology centers, which would be in California, northern California, and 
Boston and Research Triangle and Virginia and in Texas and in Austin, that’s 
where those are.
Bob: Any final advice for startups?
Gene: So one thing that’s very common is that people give away their ideas 
by not getting confidentiality agreements in place before they talk to people. 
I mean they are for protection and they only work if we sue on them, but 
they are certainly a lot better than nothing. And people should always do it, 
and it will scare your investors if you haven’t used them.
Another thing is that technology doesn’t automatically go into companies. 
You have technology that you have developed and you form a company; you 
still own the technology but the company doesn’t own it. Very often what 
happens is a lot of people work together and then somewhere along the line 
after a few months they form a company. The company never grabs all the 
intellectual property they created. So that’s a major issue. And then if they 
go off and get a job at Microsoft or something, you may never be able to get 
it. So you need to really get it early.
Bob: OK.
Gene: You can lose your patent ability on inventions if you disclose them 
too early and you don’t file a patent application. So if it looks like you have 
developed something patentable, you need to talk to patent lawyers early. 
So the technology can end up in the public domain because you didn’t file it 
right.
Bob: OK.
Gene: You need to remember that you can’t use any old trademarks. Before 
you invest in a trademark, you got to register it and make sure you got rights 
to it. A lot of people get themselves cease-and-desist letters right after their 
project launched because they got a trademark problem, and that’s relatively 
easy to avoid.
So the other kind of thing is I think people make mistakes in dealing with 
investors. And I think the most common mistake they make is only looking 
at the money and not looking at the rest of the deal. So the person that gives 
you the most money may be the best investor for you, but they may not be. 
And one thing that companies will have to understand is their investors often 
have the right to displace them. So doing due diligence on investors is very 
important.
Another really common mistake is not understanding vesting. So vesting is a 
concept that . . . for instance, when you found a company and you bring in 
somebody to be the VP of sales and you give him some stock. Well, the best 

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
188
way to do that is to make sure that he only gets the stock if it works out. If 
you give somebody a third of the stock of your company on Monday and you 
don’t have a vesting schedule and then they leave your company on Tuesday, 
they still own the stock and they are no longer a contributor. So you really 
need to . . .
Bob: . . . have a vesting schedule.
Gene: Right. And I guess the final thing is if you came up with the idea in 
your current job and then you quit and form a company, you need to be very 
clear that you actually own the technology and it is not actually owned by 
the place where you used to work and that you can exploit it without violating 
whatever contract you signed with the place that you used to work.
Mairtini Ni Dhomhnaill, Senior Vice President, 
Accretive Solutions
Mairtini Ni Dhomhnaill heads up the startup practice in the San Francisco 
and Silicon Valley offices of the consulting firm Accretive Solutions (http://
www.accretivesolutions.com), which provides accounting, financial, and 
other consulting services to over 500 startups. Put another way, Mairtini 
knows n3 more about what startups need to do when it comes to handling 
their finances than you or I will ever know. For an episode of the Startup 
Success Podcast,14 I asked Mairtini to help us out with some of the financial 
and legal basics a startup founder should know.
Bob: Mairtini, what’s a balance sheet?
Mairtini: A balance sheet is a statement of your company’s holdings at a 
given point in time. So it shows primarily two things. It shows your assets, 
which is what you own, and it shows your liabilities, which is what you owe. 
So it’s a good indication of what the company is worth right now.
Bob: So it’s a snapshot of your worth at that particular moment. Typically 
when a startup actually launches, do they begin with a balance sheet as their 
first sort of laying out the plumbing?
Mairtini: Absolutely. The first thing an investor is going to really want to 
see is a balance sheet, pertaining to the perspective of wanting to see how 
much money—usually the biggest asset on a balance sheet or the only asset 
would be cash in the bank. But the thing they’re more interested in is how 
much you owe.
Bob: Ah, OK.
Mairtini: What liability you have.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
189
Bob: Let’s assume you’ve got a couple of founders sitting around a kitchen 
table. They’re going to go after, let’s say, the relatively or perhaps easier 
funding out there, angel investing, which nowadays typically goes up to about 
$1 million. Let’s ask a couple of nitty-gritty questions here. Should people be 
listing their personal debt here, or should this all be about the company that 
they have created?
Mairtini: Oh, definitely not their personal debt. It should be about the 
company they’ve created. And I guess, on that point, they really should have 
created a legal entity for the company.
Bob: OK, let’s discuss that point for a second. Any preferences out there? I 
started my consulting company as a subchapter S here in California, but that 
was back in 1994, before I became a microISV or anything else. It may be a 
bit old-fashioned, because I hear now more and more about limited liability 
companies, LLCs. What’s been your experience for people who are startups?
Mairtini: In my experience, if you’re a startup that wants to attract outside 
money, like a VC or an angel funding, you’re more than likely going to have 
to be a C corp, a C-corporation. There are times when you might be a limited 
liability corporation, but there are certain tax reasons why you would be 
that. So it really is driven by the investors. But if you’re looking for top-tier 
or even tier-2 or tier-3 VC money, you’re going to have to be a C corp.
Bob: And they should probably get some professional help with that, 
because it sounds . . . You can do an S corp sort of pretty well, with maybe 
a bit of lawyering and a bit of accounting and especially with all of the online 
services now, but a C corp, that’s a little bit more involved, to put it mildly.
Mairtini: It is a little bit more involved. I’m not suggesting that just one guy 
in his garage rushes out and starts a C corp. It might be OK to be an S corp 
or even a sole proprietor for the near term. But once you get to the point 
where you’re going to need that money and bring it into the company, you’ll 
then have to convert to a C corp.
Bob: Is there a good or a bad path to the C corp? In other words, should 
they start out as an LLC and then go to a C corp? Or should they start out 
as S corp, a subchapter S corporation in the in the U.S. tax code, and then 
convert that to a C corp? Is one harder or easier than the other?
Mairtini: No, it really depends on what you do while you’re the S corp or 
the LLC, what kind of activity you have. So I wouldn’t say one is harder or 
easier than the other. It just really does depend on the circumstances in each 
case. I’ve had both types of companies that I’ve rolled up into C corp. It was 
relatively painless as long as they had all of their records and had kept their 
numbers and their books in good shape.
Bob: Let’s talk about records for just a second here. This may sound simple, 
but for a lot of startups today, because the cost has come down so far in 
what they need to put out, I mean they can pretty much launch a web site 
based on 2.0 for the cost of $400, $500 a month for a good host. When 
should they draw the line between their personal money and expenses and 
their company money and expenses?

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
190
Mairtini: Well, I am not quite sure what you mean when you ask, “When 
should they draw the line?” They should always draw a line. Even if you are 
spending your personal money, you should always keep it as a separate cate-
gory as regards the receipts or the record of that money you spent, if it has 
to do with your company. By saying “when,” I don’t know whether you mean 
critical mass that comes to a point?
Bob: I guess I am thinking a bit of a leading question here. But I am under 
the impression that a single person who is going to start a company may not 
be sure yet of how big it is going to get. It’s at the gleam-in-the-eye stage, if 
you will. It seems like that person should start tracking expenses separately 
from the very get-go, from the very first PayPal expense.
Mairtini: Absolutely. From day one, start tracking the expenses separately. 
Yes. Also, they should track their expenses separately from the beginning 
because you are going to need to get that activity into the records of your 
company when and if you do incorporate it or whatever.
Bob: OK.
Mairtini: And the way you would do that would be, say you spend four or 
five months and you haven’t set up a legal entity. You are spending money 
on behalf of this new company you intend to start. You would spend the 
money maybe on your personal credit card or you might write checks; you 
will keep all of the receipts. And when you incorporate your company, whether 
you create an S corp or a C corp, you would do something pretty straight-
forward, like you would create an expense report and have the company 
now reimburse you through all of that spending you did.
Bob: Oh, OK, that makes sense.
Mairtini: But you just don’t want to knock into your personal checking 
account.
Bob: OK.
Mairtini: And so, for example, when you talk about balance sheet, that 
would be something that would be on your balance sheet. When you first 
create your legal entity, if you haven’t got the cash in the new entity to reim-
burse yourself, you would carry that as a liability, so that anyone looking at 
will see, “Oh this company owes the founder $10,000 or $20,000.” But a 
new investor would look and see, “Well if I am going to put a $100,000 into 
the company, the first $10,000 or $20,000 is going straight out the door to 
the founder to reimburse him for prior expenses.”
Bob: But that’s the right way to do it, you are saying?
Mairtini: That is the right way to do it.
Bob: One more thing about balance sheets, and this is more my accounting 
ignorance than anything else. The only thing I sort of know about balance 
sheets is that some people try and put “goodwill” on it as some sort of asset. 
When you’re talking, as a startup, when you’re talking to people who have 
money that may or may not actually go into your company, do you think 
startup as an asset or strategic alliances, or are we talking cold, hard cash?

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
191
Mairtini: It is just cold, hard assets. There are very specific accounting rules, 
and you can have what’s called an “intangible” asset on your balance sheet. 
Certain rules—actually almost all—boil down to if you purchase a company, 
you may be able to purchase a company and have some goodwill on your 
balance sheet, you may purchase a company and have some IP (intellectual 
property) on your balance sheet, but, overall, startups should never have an 
intangible asset on their balance sheet. There would be no reason for that. 
And not only would there be no reason for it, you can’t do it, because it isn’t 
GAAP, it is not generally accepted accounting policies.
Bob: Ah, and if you don’t follow the rules, it doesn’t count?
Mairtini: Pretty much.
Bob: Well, there are a couple of other things that you mentioned here as 
Financial Statements 101. What’s an income statement? Is that basically a 
statement of your income?
Mairtini: An income statement, yeah, it’s the results of the company’s oper-
ations. It is: How did we do? What profits or income did we bring home 
after we sold stuff and spent stuff?
Bob: Is that what is also called a P&L?
Mairtini: Yes, the profit and loss or an income statement, they tend to be 
interchangeable.
Bob: That clarifies that for me. And this is basically showing what you have 
brought in or what you hope to bring in or both?
Mairtini: What you have brought in. It is not what you hope to bring in, it 
is what you have brought in.
Bob: OK.
Mairtini: In a specified period of time, say, from day one to day ten, here is 
what I actually did, here is what I actually sold, here is what I spent.
Bob: So it is a record rather than a projection?
Mairtini: Absolutely.
Bob: So you should keep the sales prediction stuff either on the shelf, along 
with the mysteries and the novels, or in your business plan for VCs and angel 
investors, but that doesn’t go into your income statement?
Mairtini: No, it does not.
Bob: The third thing you mentioned is a cash flow statement. Now, how is 
that different from an income statement?
Mairtini: Well, a cash flow statement is kind of a weird little report, and 
really what it says is: what did I do with the money? So for an investor or an 
outside person looking at this, it basically starts with your profits and then it 
says of this profit, what happened to this cash. So in a lot of instances, a profit 
may not all have been in the cash in the door. So, for example, you may have 
made a profit on paper, but you haven’t collected all of that cash yet. So 
there are some lines that back in and back out; these are what we call noncash 
or accrual items.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
192
But then it kind of talks about, well, of my profits, I spent X amount on fixed 
assets or I spent X amount on purchases and/or I received new cash from an 
investor. So it sort of starts at your profit or loss and it brings you back to 
your cash position, and it talks about what happened in your cash account 
over this period.
Bob: Well, then, what do you do with a cash flow other than trying to keep 
it positive?
Mairtini: From a financing perspective and investors’ perspective, your cash 
flow is a very important document. So I guess I would say the average nonfi-
nancial person would not spend a lot of time looking at the cash flow state-
ment. But you need to have it, because the cash flow statement is a byproduct 
of your balance sheet and P&L. It is a stand-alone entity. It is a result of the 
activity in both of those documents.
Bob: So it is the externally linked spreadsheet, if you will. Once you have got 
those three documents in some good form or another, either you’d pull 
templates off the Web for it or there are various packages out there of 
supposedly the startup documents you need. What else besides those three 
should you as a hopeful founder be doing as far as financial things, just the 
real basics when you get first started?
Mairtini: You’re going to have to keep in mind: What are you doing it for? 
If you intend to attract investments, there’s a certain set of material you’ll be 
asked for in the due diligence process. And the set of financial statements is 
one part of it—and that is, show me how the company has done historically. 
And that’s what your financial statements are. Financial statements are a 
historical record of how the company has performed. Now, in a lot of cases, 
when you’re first going after your first round, it’ll sort of be a lot of expenses. 
There’s nothing to be revenue, because you may not be at revenue generation 
yet. So financial statements are just one piece of the puzzle that investors 
want to look at.
And the other side of that, which you alluded to earlier, is the financial fore-
cast. So here’s what you’ve done. But what do you expect to do? And that 
forecast needs to be in the same format as a P&L, a balance sheet, and a cash 
flow. It needs to be in hard, cold numbers.
So from a financial plan perspective, you need to have a model, an Excel 
spreadsheet, per se, that will run into a profit and loss of income statement, 
a balance sheet, and a cash flow statement.
Bob: OK. Now, I’ve never been part of the VC world or the angel investing 
world, so I’m a little hazy on the actual mechanics. Let’s say that you go to 
an angel investor and you convince them, yeah, put $500,000 into this company 
I’m creating. I don’t have a product yet, I don’t have sales yet. What do they 
do? Do they write you a check, and you stick it in your pocket?

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
193
Mairtini: You know, there are angels out there that will do that, but not all 
of them. Even the angel world is becoming much more institutionalized—
there’s quite a number of angel bands sort of banded together. The reality 
is, you may sell someone just on the idea, and they won’t want to see another 
thing. And I’ve had plans like that, that raised $500,000 to $1 million just on 
the idea.
But then there are people who are probably a little bit more cautious about 
where they put their money. They want to have some sense of the company 
they’re investing in, and they may ask for more information, especially if they 
understand that some activity has already happened in the company—if it’s 
not just an idea, at this point.
If you’ve actually been germinating that idea and working on the idea, they 
may ask to see . . . I’ve already talked about they’ll ask to see the financial 
statements, the activity of what you’ve spent your money on, and, like I 
talked about, the balance sheet that shows how much you owe.
Because, really, a lot of new investors don’t want to give you X amount of 
money and immediately have a portion of that walk out the door to existing 
liabilities. They’re all about investing for the future. They want their money 
to bring you from the point you’re at now to the point you want to get to. 
They don’t want to pay for getting you to the point you’re at now. Because 
to a certain extent, that’s going to be rolled into your evaluation.
Bob: So that’s kind of a sunk cost, as far as they’re concerned.
Mairtini: It’s a more complex conversation, but it is a very important point 
for any new entrepreneur to understand. An investor wants to invest in the 
future of your company, not in the past. So if you’re coming to the table and 
you have bootstrapped the company to this point, if you expect to get paid 
back for that, you need to have it on the balance sheet, and it needs to be a 
point of negotiation.
Bob: OK.
Mairtini: You need to state very clearly that you owed X amount of money, 
and then that’ll become part of the negotiation with the investor of what the 
valuation of the company should be and how much they’re going to give you.
Bob: But from their point of view, they’re looking at that as something that 
you’ve spent to get the company to that point. They want to put their money 
into the future, not into the past.
Mairtini: Absolutely.
Bob: And they look at it and say: OK, so you spent $10,000 or $20,000 
getting here. But, hey, you’re going to own the percentage of the company 
that I don’t own, and that’s how you get paid off on that.
Mairtini: Exactly. There are lots of ways that it could get resolved, and one 
could be that it means the valuation is higher, so you end up owning more 
of the company. Or it could be they say that you can convert that liability 
into preferred stock, if you’re actually doing the stock round, if it’s not an 
off-table for your first angel round. There are some tax ramifications to that, 
so this is not an area you should be advancing into without some legal advice.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
194
Or they might say, “I’m OK with paying you back that money.” It really just 
depends. But if they are paying you back the money, expect to get a lower 
valuation of your firm.
Bob: Let’s talk about that advice for a moment. Let’s take an example. Let’s 
say they’ve got—I’ll make it totally hypothetical here—they’ve got three 
founders, it’s January 1st, 2009. They’ve lined up someone who’s ready to 
put $250K into their company, and that’s the thing that gets them moving to 
where they want to be. They’ve just decided they need that financing to 
make it happen. At what point should they have a lawyer? At what point 
should they have either an accountant or someone who says that he’s a 
CFO—a chief financial officer? When do they need to lawyer up and accoun-
tant up here?
Mairtini: I would say once you’ve created the entity, you should have a 
lawyer on call. A lot of the law firms, they’re willing to set you up initially, 
and then they don’t have any ongoing expense until you have this transaction. So 
you absolutely do need a lawyer when you’re at the point of negotiating the 
term sheet, for sure.
Bob: Ah, OK.
Mairtini: For sure you need the lawyer then. You may have used the lawyer 
to create your entity, or you may have done it yourself, but for sure you 
need a lawyer, at least on call, for when you’re negotiating your term sheet. 
As regards the accountant, it really depends on the situation. If you have 
been spending money, or bootstrapping the company, you do need to have 
had at least a bookkeeper maintaining the numbers so that you can present 
the set of financials.
Unless you’re able to run QuickBooks or a Microsoft product—some 
accounting product, I’m not quite sure what they have at this level. Unless 
you’re able to run an accounting product yourself to come up with a P&L 
and a balance sheet—but you are going to have to produce one.
So I’m not saying that every investor’s going to get hung up on that. It’s certainly 
not about the financials for the company, when an investor comes to invest 
in the company, it’s all about the idea, right? And the founders? It’s just one 
of those things that you don’t want to be the thing that tripped you up.
Bob: By the way, which is better for a software startup—cash-based accounting 
or accrual accounting? Or is it an individual case sort of thing?
Mairtini: It’s really not an individual case. If you really want to be a real 
company, you should be doing accrual accounting.
Mairtini: There’s really no reason to do cash-based accounting, unless you’re 
just a sole proprietorship and you’re never going to look for outside money, 
and you really only want to do a tax return. That’s the driver for your 
accounting. But if you want to be able to tell, how is my company doing? 
What’s my current situation? What’s my true cash position? You really need 
to be doing accrual accounting.

Is There an Alternative?
If Gene’s and Mairtini’s ultracondensed introductions to standard company 
formation and accounting left you longing for a lightweight alternative to 
the whole traditional approach to business, you definitely want to learn 
more about FairSoftware (Figure 5-4).
Figure 5-4. FairSoftware
In a word, FairSoftware (http://fairsoftware.net) is a web app for 
creating monetized startup projects. Instead of forming a company, set-
ting up bank accounts, issuing founder stock, and all the other ceremony, 
you create a FairSoftware project, divvy up on permanent shares (for your 
cofounders) or temporary shares (for freelancers helping you) of PayPal-
powered revenue stream.
The flip side of FairSoftware is that it’s a great way to find startups 
you can be a part of who are looking for specific kinds of help, from CEO 
to web site programmer to GFX designer to Ruby on Rails programmer.
Here’s how Alain Raynaud, CEO and founder, describes FairSoftware.
Bob: What’s the single biggest thing FairSoftware does for a developer 
who wants to create a startup, but doesn’t want to incorporate a business?

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
196
Alain: The value of FairSoftware is that a developer can start a busi-
ness immediately, without incurring any cost whatsoever, and start teaming 
up with other people to start building the product, legally and safely, because 
we crafted our terms very carefully. But saving money, while attractive, is 
not the main motivating factor. What really resonates with our users is 
that they finally have the freedom to associate with whomever they want 
online. Many developers see the 9-to-5 full-time job disappearing, and 
they look forward to a more “agile” form of work collaboration. In a few 
years, it will feel completely natural to be working on several projects in 
parallel, some successful, others not so much.
Bob: About how many active startup projects are now on 
FairSoftware?
Alain: We probably have about 80 really serious projects, plus another 
20 or so web sites or blogs that share ad revenue. There are another 100 
or more projects where I scratch my head and wonder how it could ever 
become a real business. But we don’t intervene. People can start whatever 
they want.
Bob: FairSoftware costs 10% of each sale. Does that include what 
PayPal charges for each transaction?
Alain: FairSoftware takes a commission of 3.9% on sales from the 
projects we host. But we also pass along PayPal’s costs, so in the worst 
case, where a payment crosses multiple continents between the consumer, 
us, and the contributor, the total charge reaches 10%. We have ways to 
lower this number for the United States. We are also introducing different 
pricing plans, where people can trade off commission and fixed hosting 
fees. Our goal is to find a price that works for everyone. It’s very impor-
tant for us to offer an option where creating a project is 100% free. We 
believe that students and people from poorer countries deserve their chance.
Bob: Have any FairSoftware projects “graduated” to the next level: 
become incorporated and raised angel money?
Alain: A handful of projects have “graduated.” What happened typi-
cally is that people found each other through the site, started working 
together, and then partnered in real life. I can think of a few projects 
whose scope was outside our sweet spot. For instance, a nonprofit project 
gathered a lot of interest and FairSoftware helped set up the first few posi-
tions. But it was clear from the beginning that that project wouldn’t remain 
hosted with us for long.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
197
Bob: I know it’s early yet, but have any FairSoftware projects started 
selling their software/SaaS to the public? Who?
Alain: The first projects to make money on FairSoftware were the 
bloggers, as we expected. FairSoftware has also become a meeting place 
for founders looking for their next idea. As you know, going from idea to 
paying customer is a long journey. On the other hand, we were impressed 
by some web projects (software) that took off really quickly. It’s really only 
desktop software that takes forever to ship.
Making Money
Making money in your startup is another one of those jack-in-the-box top-
ics: in a perfect world all you’d have to do is crank the wheel around and 
around and the money would pop out the top of the toy. In the real world, 
this little topic encompasses not just everything else in this book but 
anything at all that has to do with your startup.
So in this last section of the chapter let’s focus on five companies 
that provide e-commerce solutions to startups, a company that’s found a 
unique way for you to get paid by someone other than your customer, and 
a few things you need to know about one of the key infrastructures of 
more than a few startups: Google AdWords.
PayPal
Operating in 190 countries with 73 million accounts and $623 million in 
the last quarter of 2008,15 PayPal in effect has become the Online World’s 
banking system and an extremely popular e-commerce choice for startups 
not looking to join in the traditional credit card/payment authorization 
gateway/merchant account tango.
I have to interrupt myself here. If you thought equity funding was 
complicated, just wait until you have to dive into credit card processing. If 
you plan on making that particular dive and prefer not to smash into the

startup community and to attract worthy online attention to freckle time

(of script.aculo.us fame) started in 2008 (Figure 5-5).

OK, back to PayPal. In brief, PayPal lets people buy your software or 
subscribe to your service and easily and securely pay via either a major 
credit card or their PayPal account tied to a bank account and their credit 
card. Its fees—the slice of each and every money-receiving transaction it 
takes—are extremely competitive compared to traditional credit card 
processing: 1.9–2.9% + $0.30 USD for Premier/Business accounts.
In all the years I’ve been a microISV marketing software, a consultant 
hawking my services, an author selling e-books, and a buyer of way too 
many songs on iTunes (which translates into many hundreds of transac-
tions), I have had no problems of any kind. None. Nada. Zip. If my body 
worked as well as PayPal does, I’d probably live to 250 and still get dates.
But other people will tell you a different tale: Horror stories of frozen 
accounts, uncaring customer support, and worse linger forever on the 
Internet, as they do for any company of this size. Furthermore, it’s been 
my experience and that of dozens of other online sellers I’ve talked to that 
a small (and shrinking) percentage of consumers simply won’t do business 
with PayPal. It’s their money—it’s their prerogative, and, as much as I like 
and recommend PayPal, I also urge you to provide your customers with an 
alternative. In fact, let me be specific: here are four software vendor–
friendly e-commerce solutions I suggest.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
199
Avangate
The first alternative to PayPal I recommend is Avangate (http://www.
avangate.com),16 for two reasons. First, over the years I’ve met and talked 
with a lot of Avangate’s management and staff at all sorts of startup/
microISV conferences and events they sponsor or at which they speak or 
participate. This is a company that well and truly likes and supports startups.
Second, and more tellingly, when people running startups and 
microISVs swap recommendations as to who to use for e-commerce at 
those various conferences or at huge public forums such as Joel on Soft-
ware Business of Software (http://discuss.joelonsoftware.com/
default.asp?biz) or private boards such as that run by the Association of 
Shareware Professionals (http://www.asp-shareware.org), you find noth-
ing but positive recommendations when it comes to Avangate.
Avangate does more than process payments. From fielding a solid 
affiliate program to robust sales and lead analytics, software download, 
and physical fulfillment and registration key delivery, this company can 
make a lot of your startup’s headaches go away. Of course, more service 
means you pay for more than bare-bones credit card processing—depend-
ing on which services you want, you’ll pay somewhere between 4.9% and 
8% per sale.
FastSpring
The second alternative to PayPal I recommend is FastSpring (http://www.
fastspring.com/index.php). Again, this is a company with a good reputa-
tion, founded by people who years ago created and built two software 
e-commerce first movers, RegNow.com and RegSoft.com (now both part 
of Digital River, http://corporate.digitalriver.com). Being a second-
generation e-commerce company in effect gives FastSpring a decided 
advantage over first-generation, some may say legacy, processors.
FastSpring’s prices are straightforward: 5.9% plus $.95 per transac-
tion or a flat rate of 8.9% (minimum fee of $0.75 per transaction).
iPortis
Number 3 on the alternative PayPal hit parade is iPortis.com (http://
www.iportis.com). iPortis is yet another e-commerce provider that’s part 
16 Full-disclosure time: On occasion I’ve written for Avangate’s startup-orientated blog at http://
blog.avangate.com, and I’ve been paid for these posts, where I write about anything but Avangate.

of the community of small software vendors and has a good, solid, positive 
reputation. iPortis is another second-generation e-commerce provider, 
started by two of the founders of Regsoft.com.
For 6.5% + $0.50 per transaction, you’ll get great customer service 
from real people.
Zuora
Of the PayPal alternatives we’ve covered so far, as of this writing (May 
2009) they all share a definite focus on supporting the sale of download-
able desktop software. Zuora (http://zuora.com) focuses 100% on man-
aging subscription billing for SaaS companies.
This well-funded outfit ($21.5 million, including $6.5 million from 
Salesforce CEO Marc Benioff)17 aims to be the billing infrastructure of 
choice for not just web services, but the emerging ecology of social media 
apps, starting with Facebook. This is a different world than $24.95 desk-
top software apps; for example, Zuora supports subscriptions for Facebook 
apps that are billed as little as 25 cents a year. Zuora handles the subscrip-
tion process for a flat 2% before handing off the transaction to a payment 
processor such as authorize.net or PayPal.
TrialPay
No matter how cool and useful your startup’s software, there’s always 
going to be a percentage of potential customers who trial your software 
but can’t or won’t pay. Nothing new with that, right? Well, actually, there 
is something new: TrialPay (http://trialpay.com).
What TrialPay does is give your startup’s potential customers a second 
chance to own your software by completing one offer from one of Trial-
Pay’s partners. Everything from becoming a Netflix customer to subscribing 
to the New York Times gets you paid—and you can get paid more than you 
normally charge for your software.
The magic words that make this possible are Customer Acquisition 
Cost and Customer Lifetime Value. How much it costs you to acquire a 
new customer and how much you’ll make off them while they’re your cus-
tomer are key business metrics. Paying your startup for helping acquire a 
new customer when rendered frictionless through good software makes

perfect sense: the major league brand gets a new customer, you get paid, 
and the customer gets two things he or she wants instead of nothing.
Dave Collins, Founder, Shareware Promotions
In the online advertising world, where all things revolve around Google 
AdWords, Dave Collins is the skilled, proficient, and highly knowledgeable 
force behind Shareware Promotions (http://www.sharewarepromotions.
com; Figure 5-6), which focuses on the arcane arts of AdWords, search 
engine optimization, and web analytics for small software companies like 
yours. I asked Dave to fill me in on the gist of what I—and you—need to 
understand about Google AdWords.
Figure 5-6. Shareware Promotions
Bob: Let’s start with Google AdWords because that’s the gorilla that owns 
this particular cage. When startups start thinking about their Google AdWords 
campaign, when is the right time to begin really considering what they need 
in this area?

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
202
Dave: I think as soon as they’re ready to start selling. That’s the time to start 
using AdWords. It can also be a very useful tool for actual market research. 
But basically, once you’re web site is up and running and your product is avail-
able. There’s absolutely no reason to wait. The sooner the better, really.
Bob: Let’s talk about broad brush strokes here. When a startup is ready to 
go for a Google AdWords campaign and start using that as their main marketing 
tool, what should they know that Google won’t tell them?
Dave: The two-word answer is a lot. There’s a huge amount. I’d say the 
single most important fact, if you like, or point that should be behind every 
decision is that the whole AdWords system is set up for Google. It’s a very 
obvious and very simplistic statement, that every aspect of the system is set 
up and geared heavily toward Google and their priorities.
There’s an obvious overlap of priorities, and, for some matters, what’s good 
for Google is good for you. But there are also a lot of times when you could 
be spending money on, for instance, keywords that aren’t really relevant. 
Google is happy, and you are not.
So the key thing is, go with your eyes open, and understand that the system 
is not set up to be your friend, to be on your side at all.
Bob: That’s a pretty harsh statement. Can you give me a couple of examples?
Dave: Don’t call my bluff. I could probably come up with a list of 50. The two 
classic examples are: When you enter the keywords, these are the keywords 
that are going to trigger your ad to be displayed. By default, Google set these 
at broad match. So without getting bogged down by the technicalities, what 
this means is, you choose a phrase, for instance, “e-mail software for Mac” 
will be your keyword. By default, with broad match, someone searching for 
“Mac software” could see your ad. Someone searching for “software” could 
see your ad. And even, horrifically, someone searching for “e-mail software 
for Windows” could also see your ad, because of how broad matching works.
They have what’s called “expanded matching,” where they add more words 
to the phrase. But, bizarrely, expanded matching also includes taking words 
out of the phrase. So even though your keyword might be “e-mail software 
for Mac,” the system could generate an ad impression and possibly a click 
that you’re going to be charged for—someone searching for “Unix e-mail 
software,” “Windows e-mail software.”
Bob: It’s a very powerful tool, but don’t expect that Google is there to 
make your campaign as cost effective as possible.
Dave: Absolutely. I’m often saying that the absolute beauty, the sheer genius, of 
the AdWords system is that a lot of people think that they’re doing very well 
from their AdWords account, that they’re making a very good ROI. They 
walk away day after day, week after week, happy with the results, when in 
actual fact they’re wasting a lot of money. So the true genius of the system 
is that, even though you’re actually losing a lot of money, you think that 
you’re not. It’s little short of inspired. Your own analogy of a powerful tool 
is perfect. It’s absolutely perfect.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
203
It’s a very, very powerful, but potentially dangerous tool, and it doesn’t 
come with safety guards. It doesn’t have big labels on it saying, “Warning, 
don’t stick your finger here,” and is potentially, very dangerous.
Bob: Let’s start talking about reasonable expectations here. Let’s say that I 
am a software-as-a-service web site. I’m selling a new, interesting app that 
my startup has developed. I put out a campaign to attract people. I don’t go 
with the Google defaults. I work it pretty hard and try and nail down a very 
good list of keywords. I do my various A/B testing against my ads. I’ve also 
got several different dedicated landing pages for those ads, for people who 
click on them. What type of ROI should I be seeing? What should I be aiming 
for here?
Dave: It’s a very commonly asked question. Unfortunately, it’s almost impos-
sible to answer. It’s really like a software company turning around and saying, 
“If business is going well, what sort of profits should I be making, or what 
sort of profit margins should I be making?” The bottom line is, obviously, you 
need to be making a positive return, assuming you’re not throwing money at 
the account purely from the point of view of branding and getting your name 
out there. But assuming the idea is to make money and sell, you obviously 
need to bring in more than you’re spending.
But you can have an AdWords account that is highly, highly, profitable that’s 
not even producing a 10% profit margin. Conversely you could have an 
AdWords account generating three, four, five times the amount that someone’s 
spending that isn’t really achieving anywhere near a fraction of its potential. 
Unfortunately, it’s one of those politician-type answers. It just depends.
Bob: OK. Let’s take the stages of life with the Google AdWords sale. We 
start with an ad that’s shown on a Google search page or a content provider 
page. By the way, do you recommend content provider pages?
Dave: Absolutely. The content network is great, but the key thing is it has 
to be kept separate. There are different rules, very, very different budgets. 
You should be spending a lot less on the content network. As long you have 
to knit separate campaigns, you can track things separately, keep the bits 
down, control the budget. It can work very well. But, as in all things AdWords 
related and all things marketing related, it isn’t for everyone. It really depends on 
what you’re selling. As a general rule of thumb, yes, it can work very, very well.
Bob: The first step of the process is that we have the keywords that Google 
uses to place those ads on pages. Besides the tools that are within Google 
itself, what tools would you recommend to the startup who’s going to put 
some significant money behind their AdWords campaign?
Dave: I’d say the starting point has to be subscribing to one of the keywords 
databases, because that’s really where it all begins. If you get the keywords 
wrong, then everything else you do at that point is, more or less, a waste of 
time. So I would suggest that there are some very good databases, like 
Wordtracker.com and Keyworddiscovery.com. Wordtracker, in particular, 

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
204
offers even monthly subscriptions, if you only want to dip your toes in and 
see how worthwhile it is. It’s very affordable. It’s all about finding out exactly 
what people are searching for. So right from the beginning you know what 
people are actually looking for, as opposed to what you think people are 
probably looking for.
Bob: Let’s talk about that keyword psychology for a moment. What’s the 
big difference between the reality of what people are searching for and the 
ideas that developers and startups may think they are searching for?
Dave: The gap between the two can be incredible. It can be absolutely huge. 
The main point is that most software developers, irrespective of how long 
they’ve been in business or how big their company is, they probably can’t 
even begin to imagine the terms people might be using when they’re looking 
for the product that they’re selling. Whether it’s down to simply the mind 
shift of not understanding exactly the terms, the phrases, the problems people 
might have when they’re looking for a solution. Or even such regional vari-
ations or different cultural, different countries have got different dialects and 
different slang.
There’s an incredible, incredible number of variants, even on one or two 
basic keywords. And really the only way to find out is to use one of these 
databases.
Bob: And to use that as your tool to get within the mind of your potential 
customers.
Dave: Exactly. Because the key thing is, whichever tool you use, it always 
gives you some indication of what other terms are out there and how popular 
these phrases are. So there’s no point in AdSense bidding on a phrase that 
maybe you think is a perfect fit for your product but maybe only one or two 
people a week or so are searching for.
Whereas these databases you can subscribe to, they show you different 
synonyms, different variations. You might find your phrase generates one or 
two impressions a week, but people who are looking for your product are 
using another phrase that could be literally thousands, tens of thousands of 
impressions a week. The only way to tap into that is to use one of these 
tools.
Bob: Let’s take the next link in the chain, which is the ad itself. How much 
of a difference is there between your blah, vague ad versus something more 
snappy or humorous or what have you. In other words, are all ads pretty 
much alike, and this is not the big factor you should be spending your time 
on?
Dave: No, the ad really is vital. This is the classic scenario, if you like, of the 
weakest link in the chain: If you get the keywords wrong, the wrong people 
are going to be seeing your ads. If you get the ads wrong, no one’s going to 
be clicking on it. We generally advise setting up for each keyword group 
around five or six or more ads. Try to have them as different, as varied, as 
possible. The difference can be astronomical.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
205
You might have the lowest-performing ad—once you’ve built up some data, 
you might see the lowest-performing ad get something like 0.1% click-through 
rate. So, quite literally, for every thousand times the ad gets shown, one person 
clicks on it. Whereas other ads . . . we’ve worked with ads we’ve believed 
are in the 40%, 45% click-through rate, meaning that literally half the people 
can click on them. Generally for that sort of a difference, to go from 0.1% to 
45%, the ads are going to be looking very, very different, as you can imagine.
But sometimes, with just a very small change, a really small, one-word change, 
juggling things around, stripping it down a little bit, you could easily make a 
difference. It could turn an ad with a 1% click-through rate to a 5% or 6% 
click-through rate, easily.
Bob: Google’s AdWords has all these analytics built into it, so I guess that’s 
going to be the way you know this. But for how long do you test an ad? 
What’s a decent test period for an ad?
Dave: That will largely depend on how much demand there is for what you’re 
looking for. So if you have a product, for instance, you’re really perhaps only 
seeing 30 or 40 impressions a week. You’re going to be looking, at the very, 
very minimum, a month, a month and a half before you have any sort of decent 
data you can work with. Whereas if you get a higher volume . . . we’re having 
some accounts generate, quite literally, tens of thousands of impressions a 
day. So a week is more than adequate.
I do always recommend going for intervals of seven days, just because there’s a 
seven-day pattern. If you, for instance, put up some new keywords on a Friday, 
then have a look at it on a Monday, you’re really going to be seeing data from 
the weekend, which could be very, very different from the Monday through 
Friday.
Generally we always recommend working in units of seven days. As long as 
you’ve got enough impressions, seven days is enough. Really, I tend not to 
judge an ad until, at the very least; I’ve got a hundred impressions. That’s an 
absolute bare minimum.
Bob: After they click on a startup’s ad, what should happen next?
Dave: There’s a whole process that should be a very smooth journey. The 
person goes to Google or whichever site they’re going to be searching on 
with a phrase or a keyword or a solution and then type that in. There should 
be a very smooth transition from that to the ad. This is what makes the ad 
really get the attention. If the ad speaks to the phrase that they’ve actually 
entered and the solution they’re looking for, they’re more likely to click on it.
Once they click on the ad, it’s the landing page that then carries on the work 
of the ad. So it carries on using the same term, the same language, the same 
tone, pushing the same product benefits. That’s the page that they want to 
be on.

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
206
Sometimes just the regular web site’s home page, sometimes that can work 
quite well. But more often than not it does need a specific landing page or a 
specific product page geared toward the ad. It’s all about continuing the process, 
the keyword to ad to the landing page.
Bob: In the same way that a startup will basically do testing of their ads, 
should they also be doing testing of their landing pages?
Dave: Absolutely. We always say that the amount of data that Google gives 
you in the AdWords account is phenomenal. It’s an incredible amount of 
different information, different reports, different graphs, trends that you can 
see. There are a huge number of columns of numerical data there. But that 
only takes you that far. Once they click on the ad, Google knows what 
happens next, up to a point, but you don’t.
You have to continue the analysis once they get on the landing page. You have 
to see what happens next. At it’s most basic, take an example of a keyword 
that generates a lot of impressions. Your ads are looking really well, they get 
a lot of clicks. Let’s say each of the four ads is generating in the region of 
1,500 to 2,000 clicks a day. Then you have a look at the data on the web site 
to find out that 99.5% of the people who land on that page leave within three 
seconds—you know that something’s wrong. It’s not necessarily the page, 
but chances are it’s something in that whole process between the keyword, 
the ad, the landing page—something isn’t right there.
Bob: Their expectations aren’t being met.
Dave: Exactly. And it could be any number of reasons. It could even be as 
simple as the web page is just horrible. It could be ugly. People look at it, 
they like the idea, whatever you’re selling is perfect. They land there and 
they think, “What on earth is this? This is horrible. It looks . . . ” They think 
it’s amateur. They go on. It could be the fact, when they get there, the first 
thing they see is “Voted by PC World the most powerful Windows system 
tool,” but there is a Mac, but your ad didn’t make that clear.
There’s any number of reasons why it can go wrong, but you have to be 
looking at it most simply, at the very least, you need to know how long 
they’re spending once they arrive.
Bob: Let’s turn around on the other end of things for a moment, which is 
the idea of using Google AdWords or, I guess. actually AdSense as your revenue 
model as a startup. Realistically, how many page views—and we could prob-
ably use the definition of what we mean by page views, just so we’re on the 
same page, pardon the pun—how many page views does a site that expects 
to live off Google ads need per month?
Dave: I risk sounding like a politician: it largely depends on what the site’s 
actually pushing. The different products and markets can have a huge bearing. 
Say, for instance, if you’re setting up, as an example, a software site, you’re 
going to need a lot of traffic to start making some decent money from that. 
If it’s . . .

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
207
Bob: How much is a lot?
Dave: Well, again, it’s—I know exactly how slippery I’m sounding—but it 
depends. The ads have to be positioned well on the web site, and they have 
to be relevant to the web site. So, for instance, I know that legal services will 
generate a very large amount of money for each click. So I could set up a 
web site pushing legal services even though it’s a software site. It’s going to 
get me nowhere. We’ve seen web sites with traffic well in excess of 100,000 
visitors a day that generate reasonable revenue. Nothing spectacular—you 
won’t be upgrading your car or going somewhere fantastic for a vacation.
Bob: OK, so less than single-salary-type money.
Dave: Yeah, exactly. Especially nowadays, since AdSense has spread across 
the Internet. We’re all used to seeing it; lots of people more or less auto-
matically block them out. We don’t need software to block them because 
we’re used to ignoring them in the same way that we’re very often used to 
seeing banner ads and we just don’t even notice or register them. A few years 
ago, it was actually very easy to make some very nice money from AdSense.
Bob: Just because it hadn’t spread so far.
Dave: Exactly. Also, to be completely honest, the rules were a lot more lax 
as well. Google was a lot more relaxed on what you could and couldn’t do 
with the ads. So there are a lot of sites, for instance, who would get users to 
click on ads not realizing they were clicking on ads. By the time they realized 
it, it was too late, and they’ve got that click anyway. Whereas now, Google 
will absolutely stamp on that and will close down AdSense for behavior like that.
Bob: It sounds to me like the easy-money days with AdSense are over. At 
least as far as everybody except Google.
Dave: Yeah, exactly. They’re still doing just fine.
Recap
Let me go back and make this point one more time: If your focus for 
building a startup is securing angel or VC funding, then stop, take your 
hands off the keyboard, and give yourself a hard reboot—you’re not going 
to succeed that way.
The people you’re approaching for money have heard it all before. 
They are not going to be impressed with your command of the latest 
buzzwords and technology, five-year revenue projections that one-half of 
the human race is your conservative market size, or any such nonsense. 
They will show you the door or hang up the phone and toss your business 
plan in the trashcan in a heartbeat. In fact, unless in their eyes your 
company has a good chance to make them really rich, out you go. Nothing 
personal—business is business.
Your business as a founder seeking funding to scale your dream into 
an honest-to-God company is to understand just what game you’re in. It’s 

  Money: Raise, Manage, Make
208
a game where you, your cofounders, your team, and your advisors need to 
do a consummate job of not only writing software but doing all the other 
things expected of you. That’s just the price of admission, and the odds 
are definitely not in your favor.
If that’s the bad news, here’s the good news: If you really do have a 
hot startup idea and put your heart and mind into executing it, and the 
people working with you do the same, and you do the things you need to 
do, someone is going to say yes, and you’re going to cross that chasm from 
bootstrapping to true company building. It won’t matter what the economy 
is like, what other companies are doing, what the latest media pronounce-
ment is. You will get that first yes. And from there, I’ve been told by people 
I deeply respect, it gets a lot easier.
One last point. Remember that getting funded is about as objective 
as falling in love. Sure, you’ve got to be out there and doing the right 
things. But those things just set the stage for the real human drama—the 
stuff that happens person to person and face to face—because you’re 
going to every social interaction you can get invited to or in the door of 
where you might find angels and VCs, entrepreneurs, and startups in the 
flesh.
It’s an overgeneralization but a true one that people who love to code 
tend to be introverts, not extroverts, presidents of their high school math 
clubs, not picked as the most popular student in the school, which is why 
our next chapter is one you really need to read. We’re going to be getting 
hot and social. OK, so it’s online social, not the face-to-face stuff you need 
to get good at to woo investors. But it’s definitely a step in the right direc-
tion. Onward and upward!

Social Media and 
Your Startup
“Tell me to what you pay attention and I will tell you who you are”
—Jose Ortega y Gasset (Spanish philosopher and humanist, 1883–1955)
“The simple act of paying attention can take you a long way.”
—Keanu Reeves (actor)
It’s All About Attention
Over the past few years the economics of attention has fundamentally 
changed—and that change has profound and deep implications for your 
startup. Sure, “building buzz around your startup” has always been high 
on every founder’s to-do list. But what has changed is what works, what 
doesn’t work, and what you need to do.
A decade ago, in the dot-com heyday, you built buzz by hiring a good 
public relations firm (for about $30,000 a month, minimum) that would 
woo and wheedle the computer trade press for a mention, a review, any-
thing. And you could plan to spend a good $50,000 or more (way more) 
doing a launch event. Of course, all of this was just the prelude to a good 
web ad banner campaign chock-full of pop-ups, pop-downs, and pop-overs, 
all designed to scream louder than the other ads at the sucker watching 
the screen.
Back then, there was no Facebook or Twitter, no blogs or social net-
works, no news blogs, no social media. Attention was something you ripped 
out of (and ripped off) “consumers” with advertising and sycophant reviews 
in trade magazines while “harvesting their eyeballs.”
The economics of attention online worked like strip mining: you blow 
up the attention of millions to garner a handful of sales, and who cared—
everyone else did the same thing. You—the advertiser—were in the business 
C H A P T E R

of stealing attention, or at least appropriating it without consent, via the 
tried-and-true process of hammering your message into thick consumer 
skulls.
This same approach is alive and well today—just turn on your televi-
sion—but something else has arisen. It’s why Facebook has as many active 
users as Russia has “active citizens” and why social networks worldwide 
are growing, in terms of the number of participants, the depth of their 
participation, and the effect others in these networks have on opinion, 
values, and buying decisions.
What’s developed is a different approach to attention, to markets, to 
people. And the cluetrain manifesto represents the theory, the instigator, 
and the clearest guide to that shift. What is the cluetrain manifesto? Back 
in 1999, Rick Levine, Christopher Locke, Doc Searls, and David Weinberger 
wrote the cluetrain manifesto (http://cluetrain.com) to nail on the door 
of the Holy Church of Advertising a list of tenets about markets and people in 
the Online World.
The preamble to the manifesto starts with: “We are not seats or eye-
balls or end users or consumers. We are human beings—and our reach 
exceeds your grasp. Deal with it.”
The full list of 95 statements about the Online World reads like a 
social network Declaration of Independence from traditional marketing. 
Here are a few statements that should hit home if you’re the founder of a 
startup.
■Markets are conversations.
■The Internet is enabling conversations among human beings that 
were simply not possible in the era of mass media.
■Corporations do not speak in the same voice as these new networked 
conversations. To their intended online audiences, companies 
sound hollow, flat, literally inhuman.
■To speak with a human voice, companies must share the concerns 
of their communities.
■But first, they must belong to a community.
■Companies that do not belong to a community of discourse will die.
■Markets do not want to talk to flacks and hucksters. They want to 
participate in the conversations going on behind the corporate 
firewall.
■We are immune to advertising. Just forget it.

■You want us to pay? We want you to pay attention.
■We know some people from your company. They’re pretty cool 
online. Do you have any more like that you’re hiding? Can they 
come out and play?
We now have a new economy of attention online. First and foremost, 
are you interesting? If you’re not interesting, you’d better be prepared to 
work hard to bring interesting things to the global conversation to rescue 
your startup from obscurity.
The good news about how social networks have retooled who gets 
attention online is that the new rules favor startups.
The Big Idea
So here’s the big idea we’re going to be unpacking later in this chapter: 
The other critical job in a startup today (besides development) is that of 
community manager. That’s the person or persons who do the work to 
connect your startup to social media so that it gets and continues to get 
that buzz it needs.
Unless you enjoy shoveling money into a wood stove to keep warm, 
social media replaces traditional advertising. Matter of fact, you’d proba-
bly get a better return on your initial investment by burning dollar bills 
than by paying for most online and all offline forms of interruption-based 
advertising. The return was never anything to brag about, and as tradi-
tional media (television, radio, print, newspapers) have declined, it’s now 
abysmal.
So what this chapter is really about is what a community manager 
does, where she1 or he does it, how, how often, and so on.
But before we get there, we need to cover a few things, the two key 
components of social media: blogs and Twitter. And we’ll also dig into the 
one part of traditional marketing—PR—that has value and that is franti-
cally trying to reinvent itself in a social world, talking with some of the 
people who’s words online can make or break your startup.
Since time management is definitely an issue, let’s start with the not-
so-little problem of tracking what needs tracking in the social media world.
1  She? Absolutely. I’d argue that women in developed countries are by and large much better at working 
with people, creating conversations, and being community managers than alpha-male-developer-geek 
types. This is a generalization, but I think it’s true. If you disagree, I suggest you get out more!

Setting Up Your Social Media 
Basic Radar
I’m assuming that as a developer you are familiar with Twitter and Face-
book and some of the other social media out there. But now, as you go 
from being a developer to being a startup founder, you have new needs 
and new concerns about who is saying what about your company and its 
product.
For starters, you need to erect what I call your social media basic 
radar. This is your startup’s early warning system that good or bad things 
are about to rain down on your head or server. There are lots of ways of 
building this radar and lots of nice add-ons you can devise and install once 
you have the basic system working. And, as with all things Internet, what 
does the job today can easily be supplanted tomorrow by something that 
does the job even better.
For this section I’m going to use Mint.com (which we will get to know 
better in Chapter 7) because one of the things their CEO, Aaron Patzer, 
does well is social media. So here’s a list of components from which to 
assemble your radar. Feel free to substitute parts that suit you better.
■iGoogle as your home page (there are alternatives, but this is 
the leader)
■Google Blog Search
■Twitter Search and TweetGrid
■BackType
■FriendFeed
■gReader and PostRank
I’m assuming that, as someone technically with it, you don’t need 
step-by-step instructions here. Instead I’m going to focus on how each of 
these components works.

  Social Media and Your Startup
213
iGoogle
URL: http://www.google.com/ig
What it is: Free widget/RSS multitab home page for any and all 
browsers.
What it does: For our purposes, it’s the canvas onto which all the 
other components deliver their data.
Setup: iGoogle is part of your Google account. You want to set it as 
your start page for whatever browsers/boxes you use in the course of the 
day. Then create or add tabs for at least the following: “Our Startup,” 
“Our Industry,” “Me,” and “Competitors.” These tabs are going to be the 
endpoints for a number of RSS feeds from the other components, all with 
the goal of making it easy to know what people are saying about your startup, 
your competition, and you.
Keep in mind that, in iGoogle Settings, you can choose which tabs 
and tab components you want to share with specific people, such as the 
rest of your startup team. Day by day, Google gets more social. You can 
also import/export tabs, and you can backup your radar.
Google Blog Search
URL: http://blogsearch.google.com
What it is: Google search, but only for blogs and with a very handy 
search by time period.
What it does: It let’s you create ongoing RSS feeds for search terms 
as they appear on blogs.
Setup: Start with your startup’s name, if it was mentioned in the past 
week. Mentions a week or less old are still fresh enough to get into the 
conversation. At some point you’re going to want to add a feed for the last 
day, the last 12 hours, and, when you have your launch or a major release, 
the last hour.
Each search has a unique RSS feed (see your browser’s address bar) 
that when clicked lets you add it to iGoogle (Figure 6-1).
Keep adding Google Blog Search feeds for your name, your competi-
tor’s name, and other keywords that make sense. Once you’re done, it’s 
time to move on to provisioning the next part of your radar.

  Social Media and Your Startup
214
Figure 6-1. Adding a feed from Google Blog Search
Twitter Search and TweetGrid
URL: http://search.twitter.com and http://tweetgrid.com
What it is: Real-time search of Twitter and then, with TweetGrid, a 
way to bundle multiple searches on one page.
What it does: Gives you a powerful communication tool for starting 
Twitter conversations (Figure 6-2). As to why you’d want to do this, see 
the section “Welcome to the Land of Twitter,” later in this chapter.
Now, you could pull a feed from this page onto your iGoogle, but 
unless you are going to sit there and hit Refresh several hundred times a 
day, you’ll lose the real-time-ness of this search engine. Better still, add it 
as another start page for your browser so that you can pay continuous par-
tial attention to it throughout the day.2
Now, TweetGrid lets you pipe in up to 12 real-time searches of Twitter. 
This is perfect if your startup’s product is getting noticed in multiple ways 
in Twitterland; it’s overkill for most people (Figure 6-3).
2  You can add multiple start pages in Firefox as follows: Go to http://www.google.com/ig and 
then to http://search.twitter.com/search?q=mint.com. In IE, go to the page you want to 
add, click the down arrow next to the Home Page icon, choose Add or Change Home Page, and then 
choose Add this webpage to your home page tabs.

BackType
URL: http://backtype.com
What it is: Free search engine for blog comments.
What it does: Comments are the other half of the blog conversation, 
and they are nearly as influential as actual posts. If someone praises or 
rants about your startup as a comment, you are going to want to know it. 
BackType doesn’t cover the entire blogosphere by any means, but their 
list of covered blogs is constantly growing, their interface is clean, and 
their BackType Connect feature lets you see who’s talking about a given 
post or article—very handy.
Setup: Go to BackType, create your searches and feeds, and add them 
to your iGoogle (Figure 6-4). If you’re really nervous about comments, 
BackType can send you e-mail.
Figure 6-4. BackType
FriendFeed
URL: http://friendfeed.com
What it is: Free life-stream/social media tool.
What it does: A lot of social media data ends up in FriendFeed. You 
want to mine that data for bits that are relevant to your startup.

  Social Media and Your Startup
217
Setup: Set up an account, start adding friends, and then begin creat-
ing custom searches and capturing the RSS feeds to iGoogle. I say “add 
friends” because there are two kinds of searches that interest you here: 
searching everyone’s feed of social items and searches of your friends, 
colleagues, and cofounders, who are likely to include higher-quality, more 
relevant items (Figure 6-5).
Figure 6-5. FriendFeed
Google Reader with PostRank
URL: http://www.google.com/reader and http://postrank.com
What it is: RSS reader combined with a popularity filter.
What it does: Finally, besides pinpointing who exactly you should be 
talking to online, you need to step back and get the broader picture. Follow-
ing the right posts for your given market or industry is a great way to do 
that, and RSS makes it easy.
However, it actually makes it too easy. Most people I know are in RSS 
bankruptcy—too many feeds to follow—or have given up on RSS entirely. 
Too much—much too much—information is at your fingertips. Unless 
you live and breathe this stuff—and make a living from doing so—you 
need to throttle this fire hose down to something manageable. That’s 
where PostRank comes in. PostRank will take your feeds in Google Reader 
and other popular RSS readers and add an orange PostRank rating badge 

  Social Media and Your Startup
218
to each item. This rating in turn is determined by how much play a given 
post, comment, or news story gets in the world of social media.
For example, Figure 6-6 shows my Google Reader, equipped with 
PostRank. Now, I could have spent 90 minutes trying to catch up on the 
237 posts from my 32 favorite bloggers, or I could look at a single screen 
utilizing PostRank and pick the best of the best.
Figure 6-6. Google Reader with PostRank
So there you have it: a fairly clean, free way to filter an enormous 
flood of information for the tiny little bits that have to do with your startup. 
And it’s easily accessorized with a feed from Digg and one from, say, Get 
Satisfaction (see Chapter 4) so that you’ll know when you are about to get 
whacked by 10,000 hits or one really angry customer.
The trick here is to make checking your radar a standard workday 
routine without getting sucked into endless hours of surfing the Web. 
Here are a few points concerning what you’re looking for in all this data 
(and definitely check out the next three sections of this chapter).

  Social Media and Your Startup
219
What to Look for on Your Social Media Radar
1.
Any factually incorrect information about your startup’s app, such 
as new comments referring to old bugs that have been fixed, mis-
statements about what your software can do, mistruths (inadvertent 
or not), etc. These kind of information bugs are like single broken 
windows in a skyscraper—soon, no one wants to go in the front door.
2.
Extremely happy, enthusiastic users of your software’s service or 
product. By reaching out to these people and expressing humility 
and offering a little gratitude, you get a positive opinion and a 
mindset of “I must tell others” and build up your legion of online 
influencers.
3.
People with the problems your software solves. These are known as 
customers. Connecting to people on blogs, Twitter, Facebook, and 
other social media in a low-key, nonselling way works wonders. Don’t 
dump a sales message on them and run. Let them know you sell a 
solution, and ask politely if you can help them.
4.
Other ways of offering value to people. As we’ll cover in the later 
section “Your Other Title: Chief Community Officer,” you have 
more value to people than just the software or service your startup 
sells. From a pure dollars-and-cents point of view, it makes sense 
to share that value—expertise, experience, contacts, insight—with 
others who, though not necessarily a prospective customer today, 
may be one tomorrow. Consider it enlightened self-interest—adding 
value to people’s lives, work, and online experience is good business.
The Startup Company Blog
I can go on for quite a while about the what and how of blogging—in fact 
I did just that in my previous Apress book, Clear Blogging: How People 
Are Changing the World and How You Can Join Them (Apress, 2007). In 
this section, however, I’d like to focus on the why—why the founders of 
your startup should blog, and why they should blog instead of or in addi-
tion to using Twitter or Facebook or participating in any number of social 
networks and media: because it works!
When people buy a product or service, they are in a sense buying the 
people who make that offering and brought it into the world. This is true 
for the largest of the large companies—who, you may notice, make a point 
of putting real people in their television commercials—to the smallest, 
newest business entity on the block. That’s you.

  Social Media and Your Startup
220
By blogging, you, as the founder of your startup, can communicate 
and spread the passion, excitement, and expertise that made that startup 
possible. You are on a mission (or should be) to share this exciting new 
thing with as many people as you can.
One thing I need to warn you about: If you think your blog is a place 
where you can get results by just touting your “marketing message,” you 
will be very disappointed in the results you get—like disappointed right 
out of business. Blogging is a person-to-person thing; no smooth, third-
person marketing pronouncements need apply.
There’s no one right way to do a startup blog. A huge amount depends 
on who you and, by extension, your company are, who you’d like to con-
verse with at your blog, and the tone, frequency, and length that feel right 
for that conversation. But there are some basic guidelines, some proven 
rules of thumb, that will help you structure and execute a good startup 
blog, With work, passion, and a bit of luck, it will be a great startup blog.
Here are my recommendations about what makes for a good startup 
blog.
■Let your customer know what’s going on. I don’t mean posting 
about what you’re going to do for them; I mean posting about what 
you’ve done for them to make your software/service easier/better/
more usable/more valuable.
■Definitely use your blog to ask for and listen to feedback from 
prospective and actual customers.
■Provide real value. Long gone are the days when blogs were novel 
and read just because the concept was new. If your market is reading 
blogs—and more and more people in general are doing just that—
they are reading a lot of blogs. You need to provide real substance 
and worth in your posts, about your startup’s software, about the 
problem(s) it addresses, about the lives and livelihoods of the people 
who have those problems.
■Take the high road, not the low. That means do write posts that dig 
deep into topics your customers care about; don’t pick fights with 
straw men or real competitors. Do explain what makes your product 
valuable, meaningful, and worthy of attention, but don’t trash other 
companies in the process. By all means, do explain what it is that 
got you excited enough to take the huge leap of creating a startup, 
but don’t bore your readers with mundane bits of your life.

  Social Media and Your Startup
221
■Use your blog as part of your customer support and product improve-
ment workflows. That’s a fancy way of saying that when you notice 
customers are stumbling over a particular feature or defect, talk 
about it on your blog and how you’re working to resolve it. That can 
be as small and quick as posting a 20-second video on how to do 
something in your app (Jing, at http://www.jingproject.com, works 
really well for this) to asking your readers what they think should be 
the next big feature you add.
■Spend a good one-third of your “blogging” time adding value to 
other blogs by commenting and eventually doing guest posts. Whose 
blogs? The blogs your prospective customers are already likely to be 
reading. Blogging is not doing a monologue. And if you’ve not yet 
launched your startup’s product or service, you should be spending 
half of your blogging time doing this.
■Be emphatic in inviting comments. Comments are hugely impor-
tant in a blog. To be blunt, they are what adds to your Google page 
rank, what ignites more inbound traffic, what prompts other readers 
to comment, what makes the blogging world go around. This means 
that when you’re first starting out, use other social media, such as 
Twitter and Facebook, to inform people you know personally that 
you want comments. If that doesn’t work, don’t be too proud to 
e-mail them. Getting those first few comments is the hardest, so be 
prepared to work for them. Of course, the easiest way to get people 
to comment on your blog is to comment on their blogs first.
■Keep to your focus. At times, you will be tempted to post about all 
sorts of things that happen in the world, good and bad. Think twice, 
maybe three times, before doing so. On occasion I’ve succumbed to 
the temptation to use my blog as a soapbox on which to stand and 
shout; invariably I regretted it later. Remember, you’re not writing 
for yourself; you’re writing for your readers. You deliver what they’re 
interested in, they pay you attention: that’s the deal.
■Avoid the topics of sex, religion, and politics—they have no place in 
a startup blog, unless you sell a product that improves sex, manages 
churches, or keeps politicians out of jail.
Startup Blogs—Three Examples
Just about every startup has a blog—for good reason—so there’s no short-
age of examples out there. I wanted to focus on just three here, because 
they each exemplify something you should know about startup blogs.

  Social Media and Your Startup
222
First up we have the Rising Tide blog, from Tugboat Enterprises. Tug-
boat makes Selkie Software, a line of data-rescue and -migration products 
for business and consumers—not necessarily the most exciting or attention-
getting subject out there (Figure 6-7).
Figure 6-7. Rising Tide
I asked Matthew Bleicher, Tugboat Enterprises online marketing 
manager, about Rising Tide.3
“Your timing on these questions is good,” replied Matthew. “Our blog 
reached a milestone of sorts this past month. It has now passed all of our 
product sites and our corporate site in traffic. A very small percentage of 
our visitors are checking out our product sites from the blog. As our blog 
traffic grows we certainly expect that number to grow.
3  A note of disclosure here: I consulted with Tugboat about how to position their blog, its structure and 
focus.

  Social Media and Your Startup
223
“For the most part we use the blog to post topics not directly related 
to our product. We have done some posting in regards to our product on 
there, but that is not the focus of the site. We would rather pull in a larger 
audience than just those seeking recovery and migration software. What I 
am hoping to see, and honestly expect to see, is that in the coming months 
more and more people will come back to us by way of our product sites to 
purchase the product. I expect this, since it is a rare computer user that 
doesn’t require software like ours.”
The lesson here is twofold: (1) Passion attracts, even when it has little 
to do with your software. And (2) every rule (even the ones I suggest in 
this book) has an exception. If your software isn’t exactly something peo-
ple get excited about, blog about what you and they do get excited about, 
because that shared passion let’s you start a conversation that can move 
on to other, more business-oriented topics.
Next up we have Ian Landsman, founder of UserScape. UserScape 
sells HelpSpot, a help desk system. Way back in 2004, before launching 
HelpSpot, Ian began to blog about its features, tease with revealing 
screenshots, and discuss why things would work in certain ways in his 
startup’s software. He successfully engaged with his market before he had 
a product (Figure 6-8).
“My prelaunch blog made all the difference in the world. It’s why I’m 
still in business today, it’s as simple as that,” Ian replied to my e-mail. “I 
was entering an extremely competitive software niche. Help desk software 
has thousands of competitors, from small startups to billion-dollar public 
companies. My personal blog allowed me to zig while the competitors 
were still zagging. Blogs were just really getting going in business in 2005, 
and few of my competitors had them.
“The blog allowed me to build up a small following which helped evan-
gelize the product, linked to the product, helped my search engine rank, 
and also provided a place for a mental release. Starting a company is very 
stressful, and my readers were great at lightening my mood and listening 
to my ongoing trials and frustrations.”
However, that was then and this is now. What does Ian blog about 
today, and how many people read his blog?
“My blogging has fallen off a lot.  I think there are a few reasons for 
this. Primarily it’s a lack of time. We’ve been very successful, and that’s 
limited the time I have to write more in-depth posts. I also think many 
bloggers go through cycles. It’s hard to always be on top of your game, so 
I think mentally it’s good to get away from it a bit and then return when 
you’re jazzed to post. The rise of Twitter has also had an impact on me. 
Doing a quick Tweet is so much faster and less formal than a full blog 
post, so Twitter has replaced a lot of my smaller blog posts.

  Social Media and Your Startup
224
Figure 6-8. Ian Landsman’s UserScape blog
“As for readership, it’s in the thousands, but honestly I don’t have any 
stats on it. I don’t think the quantity is that important really; too much 
emphasis is placed on it. What you really want is quality. From a business 
perspective, 10 readers, all with their own blogs, all who post about what 
you’re writing and what you’re doing, is far more valuable than 10,000 
readers who just browse your RSS feed (though I still appreciate those 
readers!).”
OK. But having been through the experience, would Ian recommend 
that startups blog prelaunch and about major upcoming releases?
“Yes and no. To the first part of your question, absolutely yes. A pre-
launch blog is critical. It’s perhaps not as unique as a few years ago, but 
it’s still a great way to get the word out, build up a following, and, if you 
do a good job, it will have huge benefits to your business.

  Social Media and Your Startup
225
“To the second part I think you need  to be much more careful. Pre-
launch you have no customers to disappoint, you’re in 100% publicity 
mode. You need to let everyone know what you’re doing and how great it’s 
going to be. Getting new customers is your entire focus, getting people to 
take a chance on you.
“Once you’re established, though, the risk of disappointing custom-
ers should your release plan not work out is huge. I would much rather 
underpromise and overdeliver. Also, in a small startup or MicroISV there’s 
always a good chance you’re not going to get all the features done you 
think you will, or you’ll hit an impasse where you’ll have to delay or remove 
features from a new release. You don’t want to have been blogging about 
those features for six months to not deliver them.”
Again, we get two lessons for the price of one: Ian started blogging 
before releasing and this was critical for his success: he amassed atten-
tion, potential customers, and valuable product feedback prior to launch. 
The second lesson is that over the years, Ian has experimented with I 
think about five blog layouts before arriving at his current, shall we say 
minimalist layout shown in Figure 6-8. Great content trumps web design 
when it comes to blogs—invest your time in the content, not trying to 
look amazingly great.
Finally, let’s turn to another startup’s blog: RescueTime. We’ll go into 
more detail about RescueTime and its CEO, Tony Wright, in Chapter 7, 
but I think RescueTime’s blog is notable, for several reasons.
■It’s not an overt product blog—it’s a developer blog in many ways. 
Posts like the following don’t, on their face, have a lot to do with 
time management: “Extend Rails ActiveRecord and Connection-
Adapter to support dirty reads on MySQL.”
■Certain posts—and I think this is the core of the blog—reveal 
surprising information about how time gets spent. And these posts 
get a sizable number of comments. For example, a few posts past 
the foregoing, which got zero comments, is this post: “Daylight 
Savings Time costs the United States $480,000,000.” It got 
28 comments. This is in line with Tony’s strategy of garnering atten-
tion by using surprising information amassed from RescueTime’s raw 
anonymous data.
■ The blog is not all Tony. RescueTime’s other two founders—Joe 
Hrusha and Brian Floca—as well as Montana Low, Sr. (software 
development engineer) and Mark Wolgemuth (chief architect) 
share some of the burden.

  Social Media and Your Startup
226
■The RescueTime blog is hosted at WordPress.com, which will host 
your blog Google ad-free for $30 a year. You don’t have the creative 
freedom or the attendant time sink of a self-hosted, all the plug-ins 
you can eat, WordPress.org blog, and that’s probably a good thing.
I asked Tony how much of a role RescueTime’s blog has had in its 
success.
“I wouldn’t say too much, though if you add all of our blogs into the 
mix, it might go up a touch,” Tony replied. “For us, it’s a valuable channel 
for announcements. Note that we also use Get Satisfaction, which we love 
for public, two-way conversations.” As for why the blog covers developer 
issues rather than customer issues on occasion: “Mostly because our 
developers want to write about it sometimes. Our customer base is pretty 
developer heavy right now, so interesting tech stuff is a bit of a draw for 
that. Anything link-worthy is good (SEO, etc.).”
How does it work having five bloggers under one URL roof? “It’s 95% me, 
though everyone is welcome to blog. We’ll generally send out e-mail drafts.”
And finally, what’s his take on hosting his blog at WordPress.com? “We 
LOVE wordpress.com. It’s not QUITE as customizable as we’d like, due to 
the hosted nature of it, but it makes up for it by not requiring any effort/
maintenance.”
Andy Wibbels, Six Apart
One of the most thoughtful bloggers on what blogging is all about is Andy 
Wibbels. Andy, now the product manager for blogs.com at Six Apart (the 
makers of TypePad), is the author of Blogwild!: A Guide for Small Business 
(Portfolio, 2006) and a clear and passionate advocate for blogging.
Although I’ve written extensively on blogging, I wanted to get Andy’s take on 
blogging for startups, especially on how blogging and microblogging at sites 
such as Twitter interact.
Bob:  Let’s start with the big picture. What should startups understand about 
the strategic value of doing a blog today?
Andy: I think that the strategic value is how easily you can put stuff online. 
I always think about that with an online business, unless you can put stuff 
online quickly, you don’t have a business. A blog is often the fastest and 
quickest way to simply get stuff online. I think that’s kind of the foundation 
of it: quick publishing, cheap publishing, and just get it up and get it going. 
That is the foundation, for me, about why startups should be looking at blogs.
Another part of the puzzle is that it provides this inside view into a company. 
For a startup, a lot of times with the marketing PR, they want to convey this 
sense that the company or the project or the product is really something 
that’s going to be new and fresh and exciting. It’s coming from people who 
are innovators or have a particular cache of inventors.

  Social Media and Your Startup
227
So I think that is kind of the second part. The first part is getting stuff online 
quickly, the second part is providing this warmth and this depth that a larger 
company can’t replicate easily. That can be a strategic advantage for a 
company.
Bob: One question that comes up nowadays for some people who are, let’s 
say, on Twitter 18 times a day or 1,800 times a day . . .
Andy: Right.
Bob: . . . is do blogs really matter in a world of Twitter?
Andy: Well, I think that these are all part of a larger trend that some folks 
are calling the social web, or social publishing. We had a Facebook, we have 
Twitter. We have all of these different conduits, so we have these different 
media formats that have these little bits of information and pictures and text 
and video. And then we have all the connections between them. So I think 
that blogging is kind of nested inside all of these trends.
With Twitter, it’s going to depend on if your audience, your future 
customers, the journalists that you want to reach, and the people who you 
want to track your company, are those people on Twitter? I think part of it 
is, is your audience even on Twitter yet? I think Twitter can take up a lot of 
your time every day, and I think the value of Twitter is really for networking 
and starting to get to know people who may be useful for your business, for 
future employees, for press coverage, and just gently introducing them to 
who the heck you are.
But I think it can definitely be a time sink for a lot of people, because it 
provides that quick hit of instant publishing that I think blogging grew away 
from, which is why we even have Twitter in the first place. Blogging used to 
be white box: type what you think and click Save. And then we added cate-
gories and rich text editor. And we have to add images and tags and permis-
sions and themes and templates. I think the advantage of tools like Twitter 
and the new blogging platforms Posterous and Tumblr, they’ve really stripped 
blogging down back to a white box you throw stuff into.
Bob: So if Twitter is how we get ourselves out there, assuming that the 
people we want to talk to are on Twitter, is our blog then sort of the back-
bone of our online persona?
Andy: I think it can be. I think a blog is becoming a more useful place to have 
much more thoughtful essays that go beyond 140 characters, that go beyond 
“Oh, I found this cool thing. Here’s a link to it,” which is what blogging sort 
of started off as. A blog can still be an anchor for the rest of your world, 
because with a Twitter profile, you don’t own that profile, Twitter does. 
You don’t own your Facebook profile, Mark Zuckerberg does. You don’t 
own all of these online profiles unless you own -- you don’t have domain 
over those profiles. But if you anchor them all to your online identity on 
a blog or a web site, then you truly own all these different pieces of your 
online life.

  Social Media and Your Startup

I think that’s going to be a big issue coming up, maybe sooner than later. I’m 
not really sure. People get a bit nutty about privacy and who owns their 
profiles. We just had that big bad crash with Facebook, where they said we 
can own your information, even after you’ve deleted your account. The 
users went crazy. So I think there is a privacy backlash brewing as people 
start to realize their exposure and how they don’t own their online identi-
ties when it’s owned by a service like Twitter or Facebook.
So I think a blog can still be the anchor for all these other parts of your 
online persona.
Bob: Let’s talk about just the idea of a blog for your “product” at a startup. 
Should blogs really function in the role as basically places to flog your product?
Andy: They can. It will not be very popular. I think part of a company’s blog 
is focused on “Yes, here’s what we’re working on,” but also “Here are the 
greater trends that we’re seeing.” “Here is information that our customers 
need to know,” whether or not it’s linked to the product. So we all have 
customers that we reach and people that we touch every day. That may or 
may not be fine, boosting our products right then and there. But if we can 
become the authoritative voice, then when a customer or reader has a need 
that we can fill, he’ll think of us and come grab our product or service. I think 
part of it is about cultivating intending.
A blog is not a place to constantly talk about only what you’re working on. But 
it can be a place to say, “Here’s what we’re thinking of working on” or “You 
know, a year ago we had this experience, and, wow, did we learn from that.”
So it’s a way to show the expertise as well as become this authoritative voice 
on your particular segment of the market.
Bob: Do you have any preference as to whether you have “a company blog” 
that a variety of people write for or, let’s say, each founder having his own 
blog? Is there an advantage to one or the other?
Andy: I waffle back and forth on that. Here we sort of have the slogan that 
it’s about the blogger, not the blog. That all this social media stuff is about 
connecting individuals who have individual voices, who may work for compa-
nies. So if you’ve got a company blog, you could have multiple authors, and 
each of them could have a certain space on the blog or a certain archive or 
a certain way to communicate that this is this particular person’s voice. But 
with a startup, if you’ve got a kind of rambunctious leader, and that’s part of 
your marketing edge, that you’re working with an innovator, somebody 
that’s the hot, young innovator, or sort of the old guard coming back, then 
that’s part of that particular story and that particular perspective. So you 
may keep that on a separate blog. And it’s going to depend on if the blogger 
is going to stay totally on topic all the time.
That’s why I have a personal blog and a professional blog, because I like to 
rant about crazy things, and I keep that off of the professional blog because 
it’s just not stuff that businesspeople really want to read unless they think I’m 
worth reading about.

  Social Media and Your Startup
229
Bob: So I guess one of the things you’re talking about is, first off, that you 
have a separation between your company and yourself, which is why we 
have companies, and to carry that division over to the online world.
Andy: Right. And this is part of, I think, the friction between personality and 
company, is if you’re running a startup and are wanting to be seen as this 
on-the-go company that’s creating brand new visions, then you may want 
your blog to be all you all the time, and how dedicated you are toward your 
service or product or company. So it’s going to depend on the goals of the 
particular blog. I go back and forth on if it should be totally separate or 
totally together. I think it depends on the persona of the company that’s 
putting out the blog.
Bob: Where does Six Apart fit in all this, now that we’ve reached a point of 
maturity of what blogs are about.
Andy: We are really seeing blogging, I guess in this overall social publishing, 
social web blanket or cloud, I guess, of trends, that people need to have the 
ability to publish anything to anyone anywhere and have full control over 
how that’s going to appear. That’s one reason why we’ve worked very hard 
on the OpenID standard, because that’s kind of a way that people can continue 
to own their online identity.
We worked with a lot of large media companies; they’re seeing this trend 
and saying, well, how do we build a community around a certain artist or a 
certain movie or a certain piece of entertainment? That dichotomy that we 
have at Six Apart is we have a services team that usually works with pretty 
large companies and pretty large organizations, and then we have been 
working with Moveable Type. The reason we launched a production called 
Motion that brings the idea of a friend and news feed, like the Facebook feed, 
and my microblogging into a product, into a blog that a company can own. 
So like I said, instead of having Facebook own all of your customer data, you can.
So large companies really get excited about that. And then on the flip side, 
toward individual bloggers, we are really retooling what TypePad can do and 
TypePad is. So it can integrate with all these new services and new products 
and new ways of publishing online. They can connect Twitter and Facebook, 
and it can reach out to all these other services that didn’t exist a couple of 
years ago.
We also have launched a media division that is focusing on developing these 
bloggers and these publishers. So we’re able to serve the large companies 
that want to reach out to these bloggers, but also we work on publisher 
development, which is just fancy speak for we help bloggers cultivate their 
audience and their blogs.
And also I guess a footnote is we’re trying to go beyond just servicing people 
on Six Apart platforms. Part of what I ‘m working with is a new service called 
TypePad One, which is going to be growing past training and services just for 
TypePad users, and how we can help people using WordPress or Blogger or 
Tumblr. How can we help all the bloggers out there? So, yes, of course we 

  Social Media and Your Startup
230
would love for them to be in our media program and to use our products. 
But at the base, we remain an advocate for blogging in all of its formats and 
social publishing in all of its formats.
Bob: OK. Any final advice that you would give people who want to go from 
being a developer to being a startup founder when it comes to social media?
Andy: I think it can be a very different mindset. If you’re an engineer, you 
may be very focused on the things that are shiny and cool to you. And some-
times I find myself reflecting on a lot during meetings about our products or 
developments or features, who is this product for? And if you can, keep asking 
yourself who are you really making something for? I know here in the Silicon 
Valley area, I see—I came from Chicago about a year ago, so I feel like there’s 
kind of a disconnect between what Silicon Valley people think users do and 
the rest of the population does online and then what I call real people do 
online. I think there’s a lot of friction between—you have to recognize that 
not everybody lives online all the time, and they don’t see that as something 
that they really want to do.
So I think with software developing and technology development, it’s really 
asking, “Who are you developing for?” Is it the early adopters, is it real people, 
is it people who watch network TV or cable TV, and having a pretty good 
idea of who you’re serving and what their problems are. And how you help 
solve those problems better than anybody else, I think, is pretty valuable.
To sum up our discussion of startup blogs, this is something that 
should be at the very top of your nondevelopment to-do list, from before 
you launch. The key thing is that your blog isn’t about you and your startup; 
it’s about your customers and potential customers who are paying you 
extremely valuable attention. You’ll need to work hard for that attention, 
but, as we’ve seen, the payoffs of doing your startup’s blog right are huge.
Welcome to the Land of Twitter
Unless you’ve been locked in your basement with a pallet of Meals Ready 
to Eat, a chemical toilet, and your codebase for the past few years, you’ve 
heard about Twitter, the microblogging platform without a revenue model.4
If you’ve stoutly resisted—like Joel Spolsky,5 for example—this giant 
timewaster on the grounds that it doesn’t matter to your startup if a few 
4  As of May 17, 2009—but that will change, just as soon as it drives all the mainstream media nuts 
that one of the most popular and newsworthy startups doesn’t have a revenue model!

hundred people know what you had for breakfast, then for a start let me refer 
you to my and Nicole Kristen’s The Twitter Survival Guide e-book, available 
at http://multisocialmedia.com.
For everyone else, let’s get specific about why you want to be on Twitter 
as a startup, why, in fact, you need to be on Twitter. It’s not just that Twitter 
has taken off—adding 6 million users in just January and February 2009 
alone—or that its demographics are shifting past the traditional early 
adopters of social media.6 It’s that Twitter can bring your startup sales. 
But it’s not going to do it in a traditionally measurable way (spend x on 
advertising, get y customers). Social media doesn’t work by herding cattle.
Consider Giacomo “Peldi” Guilizzoni’s experience with Twitter. He’s 
the founder of Balsamiq Studios, LLC, a self-funded startup that sells a 
great mockup/wireframing application that had already become profit-
able enough in its first six months to hire its first employee.
“My use of Twitter has evolved over time (http://www.balsamiq.com/
blog/?p=1025),” Peldi e-mailed back from Italy. “At first I used it mostly as 
a way to announce new features and blog posts . . . microblogging, if you will.
“Then I read your book on Twitter and it opened my eyes. I was doing 
it all wrong! Now I see Twitter as a way to stay close to the community of 
my product’s users and customers. I use it to answer their questions, ask 
them for feedback early in the design process, ask them for recommenda-
tions on products or services to use . . . it’s a wonderful group of people 
sharing my company’s shared interests. I also try to retweet as much as I 
can, to provide value to my followers. Thanks to TwitterSheep [http://
twittersheep.com], I know what their interests are, so I can cater my 
tweets to them.”
Does the time Peldi spends on Twitter translate into sales for his 
startup?
“I don’t really know, but I’m sure it doesn’t hurt. Twitter is definitely 
one of my top referral web sites, and I know people appreciate being able 
to reach me via Twitter when they need to. It’s like IM, but in the open, 
which makes me more accountable. I like that.”
Figure 6-9 illustrates one specific case of how Twitter can improve 
your startup’s reputation: It shows a tweet that Joel Spolsky (highly influ-
ential ex-Twitter hater and one of our wise people interviewed in Chapter 
9) posted about Balsamiq Mockups. This is the kind of positive mention 
you dream about as a founder.

Figure 6-9. You can only wish your startup was this lucky.
The bottom line on Twitter for startups is simply this: Whether or not 
you participate, people are going to be tweeting about your startup and 
its service or product. You have their attention—ignoring them by not 
talking to them is a crazy bad idea for any startup.
The New News Media
Let’s turn our attention to another, older part of what gets people talking 
about a startup: it’s in the news. Maybe it makes CNN or a major newspa-
per or maybe it gets favorable coverage in one of the leading technology 
news blogs that have readerships now surpassing major mainstream media 
news outlets, but getting press attention can make or break your startup.
Having been a full-time reporter for a major news organization 
(United Press International) before succumbing a very long time ago to 
the siren call of technology, and having written over the last few years for 
Lifehacker.org (http://lifehacker.com), Web Worker Daily (http://
webworkerdaily.com), and CNET Webware (http://news.cnet.com/
webware), I’ve seen and continue to see more press releases than I care to 
remember. They suck!
Something like 95% of the time startups get it wrong when trying to 
get media attention. They—or their PR agency—e-mail blast every reporter 

  Social Media and Your Startup
233
on earth with the shattering non-news that they’ve moved from version 3.21 
to 3.22 and that humanity is far better for it. Or those same, mostly brain-
dead PR people whine and beg that you’re life as a news blogger is simply 
not complete without spending at least an hour of a workday engaged in 
valuable virtual face time with the CEO, who will repeat the marketing 
message verbatim to you.
If it sounds like I have some very definite opinions about this, you’re 
right. But my opinions aren’t going to give you what you need in order to 
be in that 5% who win the media attention lottery. For that, if you want to 
know how your startup can get media attention, go ask them. That’s what 
this section is all about: how online and mainstream editors, writers, and 
reporters decide what startups to cover and which to ignore.
First up, I talked to a friend of mine, Mike Gunderloy. Mike is an 
accomplished software developer, news blogger, and book author who up 
until recently was the lead writer for one of the major startup-covering 
news blogs: Web Worker Daily. I’ve known Mike over the years and also 
worked with him for a time as WWD writer; but for every post I’d do, Mike 
would crank out 10 (and they were way better) and still keep his program-
ming contract clients happy and coming back for more. We did this interview 
via IM.7
Bob: When you were lead writer at Web Worker Daily, what was the 
right way to pitch a story to you, and what were the wrong ways? Besides 
always starting with an e-mail, what did you look for in a pitch?
Mike: Had to have some relevance to the readers, of course. Let’s see: 
I threw pitches away for a bunch of reasons: more than one follow-up (if 
I’m not interested, I’m not interested), lack of any evidence that the pr 
person had done any research on us (i.e., getting pitched on stuff we’d 
already covered), didn’t get to the point quickly, expected me to go online 
or call or get to a conference or listen to a briefing before I knew whether 
I was interested.
Bob: All good to know. So if a startup wanted to pitch a story to you, 
they’d better do their research, get to the point, not angle for you to talk 
to their CEO or do a demo before they knew you’re interested and not to 
pester you?
Mike: Yup. Send over the basic facts, and let me decide whether it’s 
worth following up on, and “XYZ signs 478th user” or “Big Company buys 
license for XYZ” is not newsworthy. Too many invented excuses for send-
ing out the release of the week, even though no changes in the product.
7  If you don’t use IM as part of your social media mix, you’re missing out. Check out Adium if you’re 
OS in life is Mac (http://adium.im/) or Pidgin (http://www.pidgin.im) if it’s not.

  Social Media and Your Startup
234
Bob: Gotcha. Were there any PR people you thought got it right?
Mike: Probably, but I don’t remember PR people by name. I probably 
got 90% of my leads from my own research, rather than being pitched, 
even though I was reading 50+ releases per day for a while there.
Bob: How did you/do you do your research? Five hundred RSS feeds?
Mike: Mainly. RSS feeds, a few newsletters, Twitter mentions. Sites 
like MOMB too.
Bob: MOMB?
Mike: Museum of Modern Betas [http://momb.socio-kybernetics.
net].
Bob: Aha—another add for the book!
Mike: Their RSS feed is pretty high quality for web apps. There are a 
few others similar: KillerStartups, Listio, SimpleSpark.
Bob: For startups doing their own PR, should they try to build rela-
tionships with writers or not?
Mike: I’m sure there are some writers that works with. But I’m not 
one of them. I suspect it works better with the sites that are on the “We 
must cover everything first” treadmill.
Bob: Besides your WWD work and other writing, you run a news site 
of sorts, A Fresh Cup, for the Ruby on Rails community. Why, and has it 
opened up any opportunities for you?
Mike: I’m a believer that one way to find clients is to be visible in mul-
tiple places. So I’ve got AFC, an active Twitter account, a professional site, 
all the stuff I do for Rails . . . it all adds up. People know I’m out there, they 
can recommend me.
Plus, for me AFC serves the same purpose as Delicious bookmarks do 
for some people—a long list of stuff I might want to get back to someday. 
Seems to serve the same purpose for some other folks too, which is nice.
Bob: While you’re not doing a startup, you’ve found a solution to the 
problem they have: getting attention in a very noisy world. If a startup has 
solid expertise in a given technology or industry, would you as a writer be 
impressed if they were sharing that online actively?
Mike: Well, I’d be more likely to keep an eye on them if they were writ-
ing stuff about a technology I care about. There is a batch of rails startups—
pivotal, exceptional, etc.—that I end up keeping track of because one of 
their devs is blogging
Bob: Any final advice for startups?
Mikes: You’re better off getting noticed for something useful than for 
stunts—in today’s world, I don’t think stuff like tradeshow giveaways or 
imprinted pens or whatever is as important as having an authentic online 
presence.

Marshall Kirkpatrick, Lead Writer, ReadWriteWeb
Marshall Kirkpatrick broke into the news-blogging business at TechCrunch, 
fast becoming the lead blogger there before moving on to ReadWriteWeb as 
that blog’s lead blogger and VP for content development.
Marshall’s based in Portland, Oregon, far from Silicon Valley, but his virtuoso 
RSS/Web 2.0 research skills let him consistently leave more connected 
newspeople in his dust.
Bob: What’s the right way for startups to approach you who want you to 
write about them? What’s the wrong way?
Marshall: Sending an email to tips@readwriteweb.com at any time is 
appropriate. Sending your company’s blog or news release RSS feed is the 
best way to keep us in the loop. Otherwise, we like to get an e-mail three 
or four days before a news event. Send us info about what you’re doing, 
login access to see it, and contact info to reach out with any questions. If we 
can get the full picture without a briefing (we’re pretty good at looking at 
startups), then that’s great.
We don’t appreciate it when a company expects an hour of our time to ramble 
on the phone in order for us to find out what they are doing.
Bob: Do you prefer hearing from startup founders or PR people working 
for startups?
Marshall: People working for them, especially not salespeople. Talking to 
engineers is ideal. If we must talk to a CEO or salesperson, though, we’ll live.
Bob: How many startups do you hear about in a week? How do you decide 
what to write about?
Marshall: It’s hard to say, probably about 200. We’re looking for a news 
hook and an innovation hook. We’re much more interested in the tech of 
tech than in the business of tech.
Bob: What mistakes do startups make approaching news bloggers and for 
that matter regular trade/general reporters?
Marshall: Don’t send us an e-mail with a link to our competitors’ coverage 
of you—that drives us nuts. Also, tell us honestly what you are doing, 
quickly, and if we say no—accept that and come back later with something 
better suited for us.
Bob: Any advice for startup founders?
Marshall: Please give me really interesting stories about innovation so I can 
make us both look great. Try not to neglect your families, too. That’s just a 
bad thing to do.
Bob: What question should I ask that I haven’t?
Marshall: Q: Do you think this is a wildly disruptive time in technology that 
we’re living through? A: Yes I do, it’s very exciting. The possibilities are mind-
blowing, and the ISV community is really at the forefront of it. Keep up the 
great work out there!

The Editor Is In
Let’s move up the new food chain in our search for getting your startup 
star power attention: Rafe Needleman has been covering startups and 
technology for a good 20 years for InfoWorld, Byte, Red Herring, Busi-
ness 2.0, and, since 2004, CNET. He’s the editor in charge of CNET’s 
Webware blog (http://news.cnet.com/webware) (See Figure 6-10.). Web-
ware is one of the top news blogs, and now that CBS owns CNET, coverage of 
a startup at Webware has a huge reach.
Figure 6-10. CNET Webware
Rafe’s both a writer and the managing editor of Webware: setting the 
tone, managing about a dozen CNET and freelance bloggers, and deciding 
what gets covered.
Bob: What would be your dream day, as far as the startups that you 
would see and how they came to you? In other words, what should a startup 
be doing that’s smart, rather than some of the less intelligent approaches 
that you’ve seen?
Rafe: Well, you know it’s the product that matters. When I hear about 
a new product ahead of anybody else in a way that makes me sit up and 
take notice, that’s good. I love hearing from people who are passionate 

  Social Media and Your Startup
237
about a product, and that’s generally a founder or CEO of a company. 
That’s ideal.
Bob: Is it better if they talk to you directly? What about the various 
PR firms that are out there that get into the mix?
Rafe: I think PR has a lot of value. There are some PR people who I 
really do like to hear from. But, like I said, when I get a personal pitch 
from somebody who’s actually built a product and wants to talk to me 
about it, that means more to me than getting what I know is probably a 
pitch that’s going out to 100 people or more at the same time.
Bob: Should these CEOs of startups introduce themselves before they 
have something really to say? Or should they just knock on your door 
when they’re ready?
Rafe: Well, ready is a relative term. I like talking to companies at all 
stages, and the earlier the better. If we’re going to be reviewing a product, 
then of course the product should be something that’s in a reviewable 
state and something that’s close to availability. But when is the right time 
to talk to me depends on the company, the technology, what they’re try-
ing to do, and what I’m trying to write about.
Bob: What sort of things do you like to hear about? Is there any 
particular type of startups that will really get your attention?
Rafe: Well, if I knew that, I would be building it myself.
Bob: [laughs]
Rafe: I’m always looking to have my eyes opened.
Bob: So it’s sort of the new and novel and different effect that matters? 
Is it harder to generate much excitement over yet another CRM system?
Rafe: Fair to say, yeah. Difficult, but there is innovation in every cat-
egory. It’s possible to knock my socks off with a CRM. It’s also quite likely 
that there is a product that you might think that I would find tedious. 
Then three people who are unaware of each other are announcing similar 
things at the same time, and boom! I’ve got a trend. Now it’s interesting.
Bob: Where do you find new things to write about? Besides the people 
coming to you, where do you go look for them?
Rafe: I have a pretty extensive collection of contacts, entrepreneurs, 
investors, and funders. You’d be surprised how many readers reach out to 
me saying that they’ve seen something. I scour a lot of sources, a lot of 
feeds, and a lot of aggregation sites. I go to events and parties. This stuff 
comes in all the time from everywhere.
Bob: Do you find that Twitter is a useful way for people to contact 
you? Or is that not a good way to try to pitch you on a story idea?
Rafe: No. I don’t like Twitter as a way to try to contact me for a pitch. 
I don’t think it’s very effective for that. I like to control my incoming 
information through e-mail, just because it’s easier to file, keep track of, 

  Social Media and Your Startup
238
and respond to. However, I find Twitter extremely valuable as a way to 
reach out to people en masse. I monitor Twitter all the time. When there’s 
an interesting trend or something that’s very timely, I set up a filter in 
Twitter—a search field—and I watch to see what’s happening there. So I 
find Twitter extremely valuable.
I do get a lot of tips from it, and I do get a lot of feedback from it, 
from readers and things. But I don’t think it’s appropriate to pitch some-
one. Well, it’s not appropriate to pitch me on Twitter. Other people do like it. 
I don’t.
Bob: How about Facebook?
Rafe: Well, you know I’m not very active on Facebook, except through 
Twitter. My Twitter feed goes into Facebook, and I see a lot of replies to it 
on Facebook. But I’m not particularly active on Facebook. People do, occa-
sionally, pitch me on Facebook, which is a really bad idea. I don’t like being 
pitched on Facebook, because it’s not in my e-mail system.
Bob: These are good things to know. A while back, you put together a 
blog, and actually it continues to this day, Pro PR Tips [http://proprtips.
com]. Why do you do this?
Rafe: [laughs] Because it’s fun. Honestly, I like what I do, and I find it 
sometimes amusing, the bonehead moves that PR people make in trying 
to get their story out. I don’t think that PR people are evil. I don’t think 
they’re stupid. But every now and then, somebody makes an interesting 
blunder. I thought it would be both funny and educational to chronicle it 
as it went. I’m going to do more with Pro PR Tips in the future, because I 
think it’s a good way to get the word out and for everybody to learn.
Bob: You’ve been in the journalism business now for a long time. Has 
what PR firms done changed that much in the last few years? Or is it pretty 
much what they’ve been doing all along?
Rafe: The fundamentals of public relations and of any kind of commu-
nications have not changed, which is this: The best way to communicate 
with somebody is to know them and to tell them something that is personally 
relevant to them, either because it’s something that they find personally 
interesting or because it’s related to the work that they do. Everybody 
does different work. So the blanket pitch is generally pretty ineffective, 
except when it’s not. Except when you’re Google or Microsoft, and you 
have a story that you want to tell to everybody at the same time.
The tools and the technologies have made a big difference, as witnessed 
by your questions when you were asking me about people trying to reach 
me on Twitter or Facebook.
The ways to get a hold of people, the number of people who are trying 
to get a hold of people, and the number of people who are there to be got 

  Social Media and Your Startup
239
hold of have all increased dramatically. There is a lot of noise, and there’s 
a lot of information flying around.
The fundamentals are the direct connection. When Joe, the entrepre-
neur, says, “Hey, I’ve got this incredible, cool new product, new web service 
that will automatically make your food taste better at restaurants,” I’m 
going to pay attention. He sends it to me, and he says, “I know that you 
like eating, let me show this to you before anybody else,” I’m going to 
notice. That has not changed.
Bob: So that really comes under the heading of PR firms that know 
what interests journalists.
Rafe: Yeah. I think there’s a big value in PR. I think that some com-
panies overuse it and use PR as their mouthpieces. I don’t always think 
that’s wise. Sometimes it is, but in many cases it’s not. Most companies 
trying to get noticed could use professional PR counsel. That doesn’t mean 
that they should give the PR company the microphone and have them 
speak on their behalf. The demo and the pitch are always more effective 
coming from the person who built the product, the person who started 
the company, or the person who’s passionate about it.
How that person gets in touch with people, how he crafts his mes-
sage, and who he talks to, that is advice that a PR person can give them. 
But, it doesn’t mean that the PR person has to be front and center in the 
communications, in the dialogue.
Bob: So you see more of the value PR people as advisors rather than 
mouthpieces.
Rafe: Yes, although I’m talking about in an ideal world. I realize that 
it isn’t.
Bob: OK, any advice to startups?
Rafe: Yeah. My best advice for startups is to build a good product and 
don’t fall back on PR to make a sucky product good. If the product is good, 
then you need good PR to support it. If the product is not good, no amount 
of PR is going to make it succeed. The journalists will find out. The blog-
gers will find out. People will find out, and the product will die. If the 
product is good, you want it to get out to as many people as possible.
Al Harberg, President, DP Directory, Inc.
Press releases are part and parcel of any company’s effort to be in the public 
eye, and for nearly 25 years Al Harberg has been in the business of creating 
effective press releases. Al’s company, DP Directory, specializes in creating 
and distributing press releases for software/IT companies, so I asked him a 
few questions about the realities and mechanics of doing good press releases.
Bob: How effective are wholesale press releases?

  Social Media and Your Startup
240
Al: Sending well-written press releases to well-targeted editors has been 
a cost-effective publicity tactic for nearly a century. And it continues to be 
effective today.
Millions of software buyers make their software-buying decisions based on 
what they read in magazines and newspapers. And these publications’ editors 
continue to rely upon press releases to learn about the latest computer 
software.
I’m not sure what you mean by “wholesale” press releases, Bob. There are 
some awful services available on the Internet. These services blindly send 
poorly written so-called press releases to magazine writers and columnists, 
regardless of these editors’ “beats” or specialties. They often mass-mail the 
press releases using bcc: or “undisclosed recipient” lists, giving the editors 
the impression that they’ve been spammed. Using such a service is a waste 
of time and money, and it can damage your reputation with the editors.
Make sure the person who writes your press release is an experienced 
marketing professional. If that’s not in your budget, be sure the company 
that e-mails your press releases to the editors is run by an experienced 
marketing professional who will take the time to review your press release 
for you, free. My company, DP Directory, Inc. (http://www.dpdirectory.
com), reviews our customers’ press releases before we send them to the 
editors. We correct our clients’ grammar, usage, and agreement errors, and 
we “Americanize” their writing, free. From the editors’ perspective, they’re 
receiving an individual e-mail from the developer and not a mass-mailed spam.
We offer more than 100 categories of editors for software developers, 
ensuring that each press release is sent to well-targeted publications.
Again, the two keys to success are a well-written press release and a list that 
is targeted to editors in your niche.
Bob: Are press releases as effective today as they were, say, a decade ago?
Al: There have been a lot of changes in the press release business since I 
started full time more than 24 years ago.
The Internet has changed the method of delivery from postal mail to e-mail.
The biggest change, however, has been the economic stress that has been 
placed on magazines and newspapers. For the past two decades, these publi-
cations have been under tremendous pressure from cable news and enter-
tainment and from the Internet. Readership is down for both magazines and 
newspapers as people turn on their TVs and computers for information and 
relaxation.
In general, this is good news for software developers. Editors simply don’t have 
time to do market research, investigative reporting, or any in-depth work to 
uncover the newest software. They rely more and more upon software 
developers’ press releases to learn about new applications.

  Social Media and Your Startup
241
The other big change in the marketplace in recent years has been the addition 
of computer reporters to smaller newspapers. Twenty years ago, computers 
were expensive and complicated. Today, even the smallest business has multiple 
computers, and most homes have more than one machine, too. To respond 
to this proliferation of technology, small-town newspapers and general-interest 
magazines have reporters who cover the computer beat. More dedicated 
computer editors means more opportunities for software developers to use 
press releases to get free publicity.
Bob: Have you expanded your lists to include tech blogs? And are bloggers 
more or less likely to use a press release?
Al: Many computer magazine editors write blogs. Similarly, many newspa-
pers now have tech blogs. I include these bloggers in my press release distri-
bution lists.
There are quite a few bloggers who welcome press releases from distribu-
tion services like mine—services that ensure that only well-written New 
Product Announcements are sent. These bloggers are on my list.
Some bloggers have a narrow focus for their writing, and they don’t enjoy 
receiving press releases that are about software that is not in their particular 
niche. They only want to hear from software developers whose applications 
are a perfect match for their blogs. So the best way for software developers 
to reach these specialized bloggers is to develop a “house list” and contact 
these bloggers individually and personally.
So Is the Reporter
I’ve known Leslie Suzukamo, a St. Paul Pioneer Press reporter on tele-
com, technology, and energy, since we bumped into each other heading 
for UCLA’s Daily Bruin many, many years ago. I got out of journalism, he 
stayed in. That he’s still a reporter in today’s era of shriveling newspapers 
is proof positive he works five times harder than most people. I asked Les 
to spill the beans on exactly how he picks and chooses what to cover.
Bob: What’s the best way for startups to pitch reporters today? 
Formal press release, e-mail you, call?
Les: You know all this anyway, but for what it’s worth . . . We are, for 
better and for worse, tied to our e-mail now, the way reporters a genera-
tion ago were tied to the phone. Formal press release [paper, I assume] is 
too slow for daily work and usually means it’s not urgent. If it can wait and 
you want something thoughtful, there’s still a place for paper. But that 
place is rapidly shrinking because so many newspaper reporters are dou-
bling (or, in my case, tripling) up on beats. Calls are OK, but I usually tell 
them to send me an e-mail anyway. Calls work best after an e-mail, but 
they tell me something that brings it into immediate focus. The newsroom is 

  Social Media and Your Startup
242
an ADHD environment, and if we sound gruff and impatient on the line, 
it’s because we’ve got one of those Indiana Jones–size rocks rolling 
behind us. It’s called deadline. Get to the point, be knowledgeable enough 
to answer a few questions in more detail than you’ve done in the press 
release (I hate it when I get PR people who obviously don’t know anything 
beyond what they’ve already written you—it’s like talking to a parrot), 
and don’t call in the late afternoon or whenever it’s deadline (I say that 
because web operations and TV have their own separate sets of deadlines).
Bob: What do you want to know from companies pitching you? What 
do you not want to hear about?
Les: I want to know about something that would surprise people, 
something I didn’t know (and people in general don’t know), something 
that matters to people, or something that would startle them. I want a 
good story—and that’s where the problem lies. PR folks are looking to tell 
me how wonderful their company is. Most of the time, the average person. 
Just. Doesn’t. Care. Doesn’t mean the company isn’t wonderful, but they 
don’t care. On the other hand, the average person cares mightily about 
something that affects them or their lives directly. So if it involves layoffs 
from their company, they care. If it involves a CEO’s getting a million-dol-
lar bonus while everyone else took a pay cut, they care. They care more 
than ever about companies behaving badly. They care about good compa-
nies taking care of their employees too, but it’s got to be newsworthy, like 
that banker in Florida who cashed out when he retired, and, rather than 
just keeping the money, he spread the wealth among all his bank’s employ-
ees, even the ones who had retired. It’s got to have drama and conflict 
and, hopefully, resolution, but certainly the first two. Companies doing PR 
hate the idea of drama and conflict because it implies trouble. But people 
know that life is trouble. It insults their intelligence to pretend otherwise.
Bob: Are their any PR people you know who do a really good job for 
their clients in your estimation? If so, how?
Les: There are a few that I know and work with regularly. One—they 
don’t waste my time much with stuff that doesn’t matter. They know me, 
know my paper, so they know what we like and what we ignore. They answer 
my calls, even when it’s bad news, especially when it’s bad news. A couple 
have taken the bullet for not just their companies but for their entire 
industries, and their counterparts are laying low and refusing to return 
my calls. I give those bullet-takers respect back when it counts. I some-
times think their companies don’t get that, though. Which is a shame.
Bob: Should a startup contact their local mainstream media newspaper, 
news blog? Does being local count?
Les: Can’t speak about others, but for us, local is the first, second, 
and third reason we do stories about companies. If you’re not local, there’d 

  Social Media and Your Startup
243
better be a good overarching reason for the story, like you represent a service 
that is ubiquitous. My best example of that would be cell phone service. None 
of the majors are local, but everyone has a cell phone, so they’re always 
high-reader-interest stories. Ditto with cable (though I focus on Comcast 
because it is the dominant cable provider for Minnesota) and home phone 
service (Qwest Communications International, of Denver, dominant phone 
provider in the state). For startups, local newspapers or news outlets of 
any kind are a good place to start. News blogs aren’t necessarily local, but 
that’s an emerging forum for publicity, as you well know. Get the right 
blogs behind you, and you can leverage for better positioning with bigger 
blogs, etc. Know who you want to reach too. Too often I get releases that 
are written as a one-size-fits-all and is mainly for the tech press or the 
trades. They’re dense, hard to read, and, for me, anyway, a waste of time. 
If you want to reach a trade audience, go for that and don’t waste my time. 
And vice versa. I imagine that something I’m interested in may not be of 
much use to something like, say, Light Reading, or Heavy Reading, to 
name two trade sites that do a lot on the telecom world.
Bob: How do you find startups to write about?
Les: I look at press releases, I pay attention to the blogs like TechCrunch 
and VentureBeat, I use my powers of mental telepathy, read the tarot, and 
scrutinize chicken entrails. Seriously, this is one of the few areas where PR 
actually helps a lot. Because I can’t read minds and unless someone I 
know tips me off, I’ll have no clue you’re out there. We welcome tips—the 
juicier the better. If you want to really be my friend, tip me off about juicy 
things that maybe don’t involve your company directly but are in your 
sphere of knowledge. Get me interested. Make yourself memorable, and I 
may have more time to spend with you trying to figure out if there’s an 
interesting story to dig out from your company. Many times, I’ve found 
that the most interesting thing an executive says is as I’m getting up to 
leave. Often, he doesn’t know it’s that interesting because it’s around him 
all the time so much that it becomes like wallpaper—you don’t see it any-
more. But for the outsider, like me or the reader, it’s a fascinating glimpse 
into another world.
Bob: Any advice for startups?
Les: See above. And don’t get discouraged. I often don’t write about 
startups right away because I want to see if they make it past the first year. 
It’s a way to reality-check the business. But I save a lot of press releases by 
creating e-mail folders in Outlook so I don’t forget who they are a year 
later if or when they call back to remind me that they’re still alive. That’s 
another reason why e-mail is so important, for me, anyway. It is my elec-
tronic memory. (My IT guys hate me, though, because I’m one of the top 
three users of network space. Can’t say I blame them either, but it’s the 
way I work.)

I ran into Luke when, as a writer for Web Worker Daily, I got his press release 
for BlogTalkRadio. I was so impressed with how he crafted that PR that I 
asked him if he’d share some of his expertise at my blog, 47hats.com and now 
this book. Here’s Luke’s post.
Luke Armour’s Post
So you’ve got a killer app. Now what?
I guess the first thing would be to tell someone, right? Right. But shouting 
out the window and e-mailing every e-mail address you can find on the 
Internet are not likely your best options. What are your best options? First 
I’m going to assume that what you’ve got is worth having. If what you’re shil-
ling isn’t new or newsworthy (to someone other than you), go back to the 
drawing board. I mean it.
As a MicroISV your goal is to get your products into the hands—and minds—
of those who can best use it, best share it with others, or both. To do that, 
you must (1) pitch the story of your product to the (2) right people (3) in 
the proper manner. Your target audience might include a high-profile blogger, 
an online news site, or a tech reporter for a print publication.
Remember, you are competing with hundreds of other people and thousands of 
other messages. And while a great, attractive product will speak for itself, 
getting it into the hands of the proper people will really help spread the 
word. When BlogTalkRadio unveiled Cinch, it was referred to as “the simplest 
podcast API ever.” Word spread quickly, especially when we released some 
additional developments and told a handful of relevant people.
You may only get one shot at cutting through the clutter and reaching the 
eyes of your audience until the next update, product, or service—so do it 
right. Let’s talk about sending a quick pitch e-mail to introduce yourself and 
your product. Since any good outreach begins with understanding your 
target audience, let’s start there.
Tailored/Relevant
Great outreach begins with a relationship, but we don’t always have that 
association to the media or the end users we need to reach. Without that 
connection, you first need to make sure what you’re offering is of interest. 
Every new name in the e-mail inbox is a potential groan-and-delete for the 
media. Save yourself the bridge-burning and e-mail the right people.

  Social Media and Your Startup
245
Doing a little bit of homework on each outlet or reporter is essential. That 
reporter who covers the education beat? Probably not your best bet unless 
you can make the connection. That mommy blogger? Probably not, but that 
social media marketing guy who loves the newest tools might be a good bet. 
Be creative and be energetic, but don’t be unrealistic.
Laziness is probably the biggest culprit here. You’ve compiled a list of e-mail 
addresses. Why not just send the note to them all? Because that’s why we 
don’t open 85% of our postal mail—it’s junk. Only, it’s a lot easier to block 
an e-mail address than to move, so take the time to make sure the outlet is 
suitable. Draw that connection between them and your offering if you have to.
Concise
As Bob Walsh notes in his book MicroISV Sites that Sell! a big mistake with 
many sites is “drowning your visitor with words.” That same principle can 
be said with any pitch letter. Brevity is your friend. Introduce your product 
and call the readers to action. That’s it.
Do not tell them everything there is to know about your product or service; 
your goal is to get them to want more information. At that point you can sell 
it to them in person, by offering more information or by welcoming them to 
the site for a trial. Mark Twain said, “I didn’t have time to write a short letter, 
so I wrote a long one instead.” Writing succinctly is difficult because it takes 
time and energy to write short, tight sentences. Strip out the unnecessary 
and get to the core of your message as quickly as possible.
Keep relevant and concise in mind before you even sit down at the computer.
Now let’s focus on how to craft your message. A good pitch letter should 
do two things: indicate your credibility and provide benefits to your audience.
Credibility
“Who are you, and what reason do I have to believe anything you say?” This 
can be done easily with a few relevant facts or statistics. For BlogTalkRadio, 
I’ve written:
The site was launched in August 2006, redesigned with social-networking 
components in September 2007, and released from Beta in November 2007. 
Today, over 66,000 shows have been streamed from the BlogTalkRadio site. 
January logged 2.4 million listeners across the site, a 40% increase in listeners 
since the site came out of Beta.
That demonstrates that we’ve been around, that hosts and listeners are using 
us, and that we’re growing. I did all that in three sentences.
Think Benefits, Not Features
Remember, end users aren’t interested in how many buttons something has; 
they’re interested in how it makes their lives better. Even if you’re writing 
to the media, always keep your end user in mind. For example:

  Social Media and Your Startup
246
BlogTalkRadio allows anyone—worldwide—to host his or her own talk 
radio show with just a phone and computer. It’s completely web-based, so 
there are no downloads and no recording equipment to buy, which makes it 
a perfect business or personal tool for today’s online enthusiast, like your 
readers. Want to talk politics? Cover your favorite sports beat? Rant and 
rave about today’s headlines or celebrity gossip? Now you can, from the 
comfort of your home—for free.
And then know when to stop (remember concise?). No one knows your 
product like you do, but you’ve got to stick to the core message in this initial 
pitch e-mail. And the core can change with each message, because each 
e-mail is relevant to the receiver of the e-mail.
Call to Action
At the end you must call the reader to action with a simple way to get more 
information and an incentive to do so. From “Drop me a line if you’d like 
more information” to “Contact me today for a free 30-day trial,” you must 
prod them to act. Watch some late-night infomercials for more examples.
Subject Line
All of these tips won’t mean anything unless someone actually opens the 
e-mail. Fortunately, these same guidelines apply to your subject line, which 
itself is a mini-pitch. It should be short, relevant, and catchy. Your subject 
line teases the pitch e-mail, which teases what you really want to say on your 
site or on the phone. Write for the end user.
Conclusion
So do your homework and make it relevant to your audience. Keep it concise 
with your core information, facts, and why this person should care. Finish 
with a call to action, and wrap it in a punchy subject line.
Be creative. Media and end users often don’t even know they want your 
product yet. Follow up a week or so later with a second e-mail that includes 
an additional feature or core message. If they say “not interested,” thank 
them for their time and move on. But don’t count them out for version 2.0 
or that other application you’re tinkering with.
For more information about public relations, Brian Solis has a free eBook 
called PR Tips for Startups that provides a great introduction to approaching 
PR. It’s a must-read.
Good luck and good pitching.
Startup PR the Right Way
So what’s the bottom line takeaway from the five people we’ve just covered 
about how a startup can “generate media buzz”? Here’s what I see.

  Social Media and Your Startup
247
1.
Take the time to get to know the reporter or blogger you’re trying 
to reach. If you don’t, your chances of getting anywhere approxi-
mate zero.
2.
News—something interesting, surprising, worth readers’ attention 
because they’re interested in it, not because you want them to 
be—is a must-have. Don’t waste your time churning out PR about 
moving from 2.31 to 2.32. Instead, find a customer who’s using 
your product in a surprising or moving way, a really new feature or 
feature set, or stats that surprise or at least intrigue.
3.
Get right to the point. Zero fluff. Don’t try to do their job for them—
give them facts with which they can work.
4.
If writing doesn’t come easily to you, accept that, hire a pro, and 
tell that professional what news you want to release.
5.
If you’re funded, it’s worth the outlay to hire a PR agency that focuses 
on building relationships with both the press and bloggers to whom 
your customers pay attention. But if you just hand off PR to them, 
you may see a lot of press releases but not much value.
6.
Be cheerful and upbeat, and have a thick, thick skin. You are going 
to be told no a lot more than yes; your job is to first make sure you 
don’t provoke a “Hell, no!” by angering the reporter or blogger. 
And keep swinging your bat at the ball.
Your Other Title: Chief Community 
Officer
So far we’ve covered blogs, Twitter, and getting in the news, both online 
and off. I haven’t even touched on Facebook, MySpace, Hi5, Ning’s net-
work of over a hundred thousand social networks, all of the specialized 
social networks (such as StartupToDo.com—I couldn’t resist), all of the 
other microblogging startups, such as Posterous and Identica, let alone 
how every major online company from Amazon to Google is adding more 
and more social media features. My poor bleeding fingers! Let’s step back 
and look at where all this is heading and what that means for your startup.
What it all comes down to, as I said at the beginning of this chapter, 
is that you’ll need to fulfill a whole new role if you want your startup to 
succeed: chief community officer (CCO). Just as there was a time when 
there was no such box on a corporate organization chart as chief technology 
officer, because technology wasn’t critical, you are seeing more and more 

  Social Media and Your Startup
248
CCOs, more community managers, popping up at companies that recog-
nize the value and importance of social media.
So what does a community manager or CCO do? Blogs. Twitter. Face-
book. GetSatisfaction.com and UserVoice.com. Podcasts. All that social 
media work that needs to land on someone’s desk if it’s going to get done 
and get done right. Add it all up, and it’s easily a full-time job that’s crit-
ical to a startup from day 1. And that means either you need a partner 
who’s going to make this rock, or you’ve some rocky times ahead.
Speaking of getting it all done right, let’s talk to three of these com-
munity managers in the wild.
Ginevra Whalen, TypePad Community Manager, 
Six Apart
Ginevra Whalen (@miz_ginevra and http://ginevra.typepad.com) is the 
community manager for Six Apart’s flagship product, the TypePad blog-
ging service. I heard about her both from other Six Apart employees and 
on Twitter as the go-to person if you needed help from that company 
(Figure 6-11).
Figure 6-11. Six Apart’s Ginevra Whalen

  Social Media and Your Startup
249
Bob: So what do you do as TypePad’s community manager?
Ginevra: I do a lot of things! Mostly, I invest a lot of time and effort 
into building up a positive community around our products. I do the one-
to-many communication via our Everything TypePad blog and one-to-one 
communication via Twitter, Facebook, Get Satisfaction, and many other 
social media channels.
Bob: What social networks do you monitor, and how?
Ginevra: Facebook, Twitter, Get Satisfaction, Yahoo Answers, and the 
blogosphere. I’ve got a complicated tangle of RSS feeds/searches that I 
run to see who is saying what about who. I usually reach out to customers 
with issues individually, and if the problem is more widespread, then I 
know to address it publically.
Bob: Is being a community manager more than just reacting to the 
negative comments people make about Six Apart online?
Ginevra: Yes, of course it is. Reacting to negative comments isn’t 
even how I’d term it; it’s listening to feedback and turning it into some-
thing useful and actionable. I see community management as the future 
of marketing and customer service. People really want the products they 
care enough to spend money on to have a responsive, personal, person-
able voice to speak with them like humans.
I think this is a result of a lot of innovation in the space, but also a 
reaction to the endless phone-tree runaround frustration people experi-
ence. I have a far better time talking with @comcastcares on Twitter than 
I do simply punching numbers into the phone. The connection is more 
valuable because of the human interaction.
Bob: Do you ever find yourself in the role of customer advocate? 
How’s that worked out?
Ginevra: Yes! I frequently call myself “our most annoying customer.” 
:) I’ve been using TypePad for five years, and I use it daily for our blogs, so 
I really do feel all the same delights and pain points as our customers do.
Bob: Given how much social media has grown in the last few years, 
should a startup seek out someone like you to be their community man-
ager? Where should they look?
Ginevra: I grew my experience and aptitude for this by working in 
restaurants, actually. It’s a very similar personality type! When I was a bar-
tender, I ran into so many people all day long that I was invariably fascinated 
by their stories and how to help them solve problems. Not all bartenders 
are this way, of course. There’s something one of our bloggers wrote that 
was very smart called “the service heart” that I think sums it up: http://
www.happiness-project.com/happiness_project/2007/07/the-
happiness-o.html
Bob: Any social media advice to share with startups?

  Social Media and Your Startup

Ginevra: Be interested. Be genuine. Talk to people how you want to 
be talked to by a company you’re interacting with. Be human.
Matt Johnston, VP of Marketing & Community, 
uTest, Inc.
We took a look at uTest in Chapter 4—crowd-based white-box testing 
at way below traditional cost. For uTest, building and adding to its com-
munity of over 15,000 testers (as of just a year after launching) is a must-
have: no testers, no company. It’s Matt’s job to build that community 
(Figure 6-12).8

community instead of employees and contractors?

Matt: When you’re building a traditional business that fulfills its ser-
vices through employees or contractors, you only have one set of customers: 
your customers. In this traditional type of company, you have direct, con-
tractual control over your employees or contractors. And so, oftentimes, 
companies don’t concern themselves with serving the needs of these 
audiences.
When building a community-driven business, however, you have two 
sets of customers that you must serve: the companies who need work 
done, and the community who supplies the skills and experience. Also, 
when leveraging an online community, the ultimate arbiter of your best 
performers is made by customers who rate members of the community, 
not by an employer who manages and evaluates his/her employees.
Bob: What advice would you give those who want to build their 
startups based on an online community?
Matt: First, you have to understand, appreciate, and model around 
the fact that you have two customer constituencies (see preceding answer). 
Second, it’s important to note that there is a subtle science to effective 
community-building. It’s much more than just acquiring a big group of 
people who share a common interest or skill set. In order to build an effec-
tive community, you need to account for things like structured user profiles, 
reputation systems, carrots and sticks, and community programs to increase 
the level of skill and engagement.
Veronica Jorden, Communications Manager, Blellow
Blellow (http://blellow.com) is a just-launched community for freelanc-
ers and professionals, focusing on helping freelancers, entrepreneurs, 
and professionals build a list of trusted friends who can help you solve 
problems, give feedback when you need it, and even help you find work 
(Figure 6-13).
Bob: Tell me about your job for Blellow. Are you both community 
manager and communications manager?
Veronica: I am by title the communications manager and do spend a 
lot of time in the typical sales and marketing type of role, but we are a 
small team and so we all wear many hats. In a sense our entire core staff 
acts as community managers. We all have different backgrounds and dif-
ferent work experience and so we all contribute to managing the community 
in different ways.
Bob: Blellow’s “product” is its community. How do you get more 
people into a startup’s community?

Figure 6-13. Blellow: building a trusted community
Veronica: That is our daily challenge, giving people a reason to join 
yet another community. During development we worked to identify what 
was missing from some of the other communities out there, what we wanted 
but just weren’t getting out of them. Taking those ideas and building 
them into Blellow has helped us to clearly identify why being a part of our 
community can actually help others in their professional life. We take 
those same ideas and the features that resulted and use them in our mar-
keting messages.
Getting people to sign up for another community has been tough, 
but we one thing we did was to use development as a way to bring folks in. 
We launched a closed beta to a small group of “early adopters” who were 
willing to take a look at our community and give us some feedback. That 
gave us a great base of members to start with. From there we tried to identify 

  Social Media and Your Startup
253
the best way for us to talk to lots of people about what we were doing; for 
us that was the 2009 SxSWi event in Austin, Texas. Beyond that we have 
also embraced a very “grassroots” type of marketing strategy and use 
other networks, like Twitter, Facebook, and Yahoo and Google Groups, to 
reach out and talk to potential new community members.
Bob: Is it all about getting them to join? What else do you have to do 
to keep their attention and participation?
Veronica: Great question! Numbers are great motivating factors, but 
they are by no means the real “meat” of a community. You could have a 
community of 10K members, but if only a third of them are actually par-
ticipating, then the community isn’t as active as the numbers would lead 
you to believe.
Getting people to sign up for something doesn’t necessarily mean 
that they will participate. For us, once we get new members, we work to 
keep them engaged. Because we are a community of collaboration and 
sharing of knowledge, we try to make sure that every person that comes 
into our community is acknowledged and made to feel welcome. We are 
very open about the core team participation within the community and 
offer direct and open lines of communication between our staff and the 
community members.
We spend a lot of our time listening to our members, what features 
they like, what features they wish we would add, and other ideas about 
how to make the community better. What is really great is that we are 
starting to be able to identify the community members who really are 
championing for us both internally and externally.
We try to recognize those people and work with them; their enthusi-
asm is contagious, and it is that kind of positive word-of-mouth 
advertising that helps us to gain new members who actually want to par-
ticipate in the community. We are also working on some other projects, 
things like widgets for posting on other social networks and blogs, contests 
and community projects, guest blog postings to our main blog, and a 
bimonthly newsletter, just to name a few.
Bob: How do you deal with people who are “off message”? I noticed, 
for example, some posts from what looks like typical “Work at home make 
money on the Internet” types. What do you do?
Veronica: For us I honestly think the key to keeping the community 
“on message” is allowing the community to govern itself. In our commu-
nity we have grouping capabilities, and each group has a moderator. We 
are almost finished developing our group management functionality, but 
the plan is to give a group owner/moderator the ability to delete messages 
that are inappropriate, to form rules for group conduct, and, if necessary, 
to boot or ban a member from participating in a group.

  Social Media and Your Startup
254
Beyond that from a total community perspective we will be imple-
menting a process for community members to flag posts and members for 
inappropriate or “off message” posts. Again this goes back to allowing the 
community to set their own rules for conduct. That’s not to say that we 
won’t be involved—ultimately the power to remove messages and members 
lies with us and who we delegate it to—but we want to give our members 
what they want.
If it turns out that our community wants a whole bunch of those work-
from-home type of opportunities, then so be it. On Blellow we also have 
job and project boards, so you question applies to us in that respect as 
well. Currently while still in open beta we are not charging a fee to post 
projects and jobs. Once we have finished building out functionality of 
those features, we will be charging a small fee to help keep the junk and 
scam postings off of those boards as well.
Bob: Any advice for other startups trying to build/amass online 
communities?
Veronica: I think there are really two big lessons I have learned from 
our process so far. One is to clearly identify who your audience is and to 
keep them in mind at all times when building your community. Creating 
new features and functionality is only a good thing if they really benefit 
your members; try to see things from your users’ point of view so you can 
concentrate on the things they most need and want.
And two, don’t be afraid to talk with people about your community. 
It really just takes a few people on your side to help start spreading the 
word, so while I don’t think it is necessarily a good idea to give your sales 
pitch to everyone you meet in every situation, be open to talking to peo-
ple about things they are working on . . . ask for their opinion, ask for 
their ideas, ask for their insight. We have met so many brilliant, creative, 
and helpful people in this process who have given us advice that has helped us 
to both avoid mistakes and create a great community. You honestly never 
know who you are going to meet, and the most random person can some-
times be the key to getting your community to really grow and succeed.
So how do you become a community manager? It’s definitely on-the-
job-training time—it’s so new that the traditional offline economy is barely 
aware of it. Of course, you’re halfway there if you’ve been reading the pdf 
version of this book while keeping one eye on TweetDeck!
Maria Sipka, CEO, Linqia
Now I’d like to introduce you to a friend of mine who lives and breathes 
community and is focused like a laser beam on making a better world by 

  Social Media and Your Startup
255
connecting people online. Maria Sipka is the CEO of a startup called Lin-
qia (http://Linqia.com), about which I think you’ll be hearing more—a 
lot more—in the next few years.
Maria’s story is an interesting one. At 18 Maria set the goal of becom-
ing financially independent in her family’s adopted country of Australia. 
She then proceeded to build four businesses, including a property portfo-
lio with 35 properties and a web design shop. By 28, she’d hit her financial 
goal, decided life wasn’t just about money, and found her calling going to 
work for XING, a European social network platform company.
In short order, as director of community building at XING, she founded 
four of its most successful online communities before moving on to launch 
Linqia.com—a marketplace for and to online communities. And in 
March 2009, Linqia launched Moderator Community—the online commu-
nity for community managers (http://www.themoderatorcommunity.com/).
Maria now makes her home in Barcelona, Spain. I interviewed her for 
this book via Skype (Figure 6-14).
Figure 6-14. The Moderator Community

  Social Media and Your Startup
256
Bob: OK. Let’s talk about the Moderator Community. What is it? Why 
is it, and how is that going? How did you get it started? You know, good 
stuff like that.
Maria: OK. With the Moderator Community it was always part of our 
core vision when we started Linqia [http://www.linqia.com] to provide 
an independent place where we could capture all of the value that we were 
stumbling across, because many people within our company are commu-
nity builders as well, and we have been working with clients all around the 
world, helping them build their communities.
It’s a space that we have spent countless hours researching, so we are 
continually reading blog articles, we are reviewing presentations, listen-
ing to podcasts, we are conversing with experts. You can say that the 
people within Linqia are at the forefront of what’s going on in the com-
munity space.
We’ve listed over 700 resources, probably close to 800 or 900 with 
blogs and podcasts and presentations. Anybody can upload those resources. 
Right now, we are doing 95% of the activity, like, within any community. 
In the first six months, most of the activity is the people who have been 
championing it right from the beginning, and then you reach that tip 
where the community starts to generate the discussions and upload the 
content.
We are also listing all the events that are related to communities and 
social media, but it does have a community edge to it. We are also scout-
ing around what jobs are available. I mean, that’s one of the most popular 
sections. Funny enough we have only been launched for a month and we 
have a look at our Google Analytics. A lot of people are searching for com-
munity management jobs, and, yeah, as I said, it’s just a rich, resource 
bustling place where people can come to and extract a lot of value without 
any expectation in return from us other than just contributing and draw-
ing upon those resources.
Bob: Yeah, the thing that strikes me is that, let’s say two years ago, if 
you asked people who their community manager was, they would go “Huh?” 
Tell me what you think has led to this rise of the community manager role 
within companies.
Maria: Well, I’ve just finished reading Seth Godin’s book The Purple 
Cow, and he talks about marketers and salespeople and how both of those 
roles have now evolved. The days of just pushing out communication mes-
sages via press releases, via newspapers, television, radio, and spending 
bulk amounts of money, those days are gone because people no longer 
have the attention to be receptive to that, no matter how targeted it is.
The bulk of the people that they want to target are spending so much 
time in social networks. The numbers are astounding. We have got 1.4 bil-

  Social Media and Your Startup
257
lion people that are on the Internet, of which 700 million belong to social 
networks, of which over 300 million belong to communities and groups. 
And they’re spending more time in platforms such as Digg, such as Twit-
ter, such as bookmarking via del.icio.us [now Delicious.com]. People are 
really changing their whole way of communicating with each other and 
with brands and companies and absorbing information.
And so, many of these companies come to the realization of “We have 
to join the conversation. This is no longer about just having a blog and 
one person or a number of people within the company who are just pub-
lishing blogs and have a following. It’s a holistic approach. We need to 
have blogs. We need to have communities and groups. We need to have 
Twitter.”
To cut a long story short, the short answer is that companies realize 
they need to start conversing with their key stakeholders. They need to 
establish relationships with them. It’s no longer about pushing their 
company or their products or the benefits of their products. It’s about 
understanding the behaviors of their key stakeholders and fulfilling on 
the needs of their key stakeholders by adding value and sparking the con-
versation that then has them have a loyal following. Because it’s so 
transparent. The days of just having a database and attracting e-mail 
addresses and then pushing messages is no longer there. If somebody 
follows you on Twitter and you’re not interesting, they’re going to imme-
diately disconnect. If they’re following your blog and you’re publishing 
just commercial-angled stories, they’re going to disconnect.
It’s extremely cutthroat. So, that’s why a lot of these companies now 
are employing full-time community managers, Twitter reporters. Like, 
Dunkin’ Donuts is really the best example of people that represent the 
brand, but their intention is not to sell, but rather converse and say, “Hey, 
I’m just like you. How can I reach the small attention span that you’re will-
ing to dedicate towards my brand or business?”
Bob: So, it really is a battle for attention. That’s what it comes down to.
Maria: Spot on. Spot on.
Building Your Pre-Community
Bob: OK. Let’s talk about startups and community here for a moment. 
Let’s say that you were doing a startup, a software startup of some sort. 
What should be your first move in terms of community?
Maria: I’m so glad you asked that question, because we’ve been exper-
imenting a lot in the last month, specifically on “How do you really start 
out?” OK? The trick here is that, depending on what your focus is . . . I 
mean, I’ll share the example of us. In a way, we’re a startup. We haven’t 
done any major push to position ourselves in the marketplace until we’re 

  Social Media and Your Startup
258
confident that we actually are building a product that’s going to be of 
value and we know how we’re going to execute on that. So, we’re at a stage 
of certainty, of we know what we’re doing is going to be valuable.
We’ve pinpointed who our key stakeholders are, and we want to build 
a relationship with these people. We know that these people . . . I’m sorry?
Bob: In other words, you know who you want to talk to.
Maria: We know who we want to talk to. And, Bob, we know that these 
people have limited attention. They are scratching around for minutes. 
OK? The issue becomes how do we position ourselves? How do we get 
credibility? How do we gain their trust? How do we gain their loyalty? How 
do we become a go-to point, specifically that’s going to benefit us and 
benefit them?
We are not going to go and create a group around Linqia and start to 
push our product or the benefits of using our product. Sure, we might 
have a Facebook fan page around Linqia, but that’s . . .
Bob: That’s different, yeah.
Maria: That’s different. That’s more just affiliation. It’s more just 
gathering people that already know who you are to say, “Hey, yep,” on the 
side. It’s on a badge. It’s just wearing a badge on a jacket.
Bob: OK.
Maria: What we want to do is we want to deepen the trust and the loy-
alty with these people. What are the channels to our key stakeholders? 
Where are they living? They’re living on Twitter, they’re living on LinkedIn, 
some of them are on Facebook, and then special-interest blogs and com-
munities that are out there. How do we reach and put our tentacles into 
all of those different spaces and, at the same time, add significant value to 
those people? The Moderator Community is very generic and very broad. 
OK? Those people who are joining our Moderator Community, it’s more 
like a very, very big umbrella. I want to get focused.
So the expertise that’s at the core of what we’re offering is around 
influence in marketing. OK? Because we’re building a channel that will be 
able to offer the connection between what Seth Godin calls these sneezers, 
these highly influential people. And our technology will be able to pin-
point exactly what the members of those communities and groups are 
talking about. But at no point in time are we going to mention our product.
So, I’ve created a group, in LinkedIn, called Influence in Marketing, 
and it’s around that topic. And again, I’m sharing a lot of resources that 
are related to influence in marketing, so I’m uploading reports. I’m upload-
ing blogs, news articles. I’m sparking discussions around the topic so that 
people see this group as a go-to place to, number 1: learn, and number 2: 
also connect with other people that are interested in that topic.

  Social Media and Your Startup
259
It took me two hours to create that community, to think about it, to 
write the short description, long description, find a logo, think about 
“What’s the content? How often am I going to contribute?,” invite the 
people within my network. And overnight, 50 people joined that group. 
And we’re talking very high-profile, key, key, key stakeholders. This is not 
about getting the masses. This is about getting the most important people.
Every day, we have now 5 to 10 people who join that are not even part 
of my network but that have seen, by other member profiles, “Oh, what’s 
this Influence in Marketing?” Or they’ve searched for “influence in 
marketing.”
And we’re getting, again, the most high-profile people that are join-
ing this group. And it’s like honey to the bee. You’ve got this captive, captive 
audience. You’re contributing content and valuable resources into that 
community, and every week these now 70-odd people are “A newsletter 
from LinkedIn. Here are all the discussions that are taking place.”
And then those people are coming back into that group. They’re read-
ing that content. And every single second that they have an interaction 
with Influence in Marketing, they’re going to relate that to me as a person 
as well as to our company. And when the moment is right, you can activate 
that network to say, “Hey, you people are special. We’ve spent the last six 
months together learning about influence in marketing. Here’s a special 
invitation. As a very exclusive group, you get a sneak peak at what it is 
that we’re creating.” You can blend in one of your commercial messages.
Bob: Well, not to be crass about it, but it sounds like the first step is 
to engage in conversation with these people and establish some value with 
them. In other words, before you even talk about your product or your ser-
vice, you’ve got to establish some value.
Maria: Yes. And we’re talking real value. OK? This is not just like 
something on the surface.
Bob: OK.
Maria: It has to be, like, “Wow! I have not read this before” or “Yes. 
I’ve read five of these articles already. Then this group must be . . .” “It’s 
this group’s like me.” That’s the kind of value.
Bob: In terms of a strategy for establishing the value, are we really 
only talking about acting as sort of an Internet editor, where you’re pool-
ing resources that they may not have seen together? Or is it a question of 
your own, original content? Or is it a mix of both?
Maria: Well, not all of us are great writers. Let’s face it. Most compa-
nies, most individuals don’t know how to write. They don’t even know how 
to articulate what it is that they know.
So, it goes back to Malcolm Gladwell’s “Tipping Point.” Are you a 
maven? Are you a connector? Are you a super-spreader? What are you? 

  Social Media and Your Startup
260
What’s the value that you have as a person? If you, as Bob Walsh, have the 
capability to articulate what it is that you know and you can write a blog 
every week, then great. You’re going to be able to add even more value to 
that group.
I can half-write, 50% of your capability. So I will, for example . . .
Bob: You’re too kind.
Maria: [laughs] So I’ll spark discussions. I won’t go and write blog 
articles, because I just don’t know how to research or articulate the mes-
sage. But I know how to ask good questions. So you’ve got to know what 
value either you have or somebody in your company has, and gather those 
people together to say, “Right, this is how you’re going to contribute to 
this particular community here or this particular group.” And then you 
need to do it consistently. OK? So that means being habitual about, if you 
stumble across a resource, the first thing that comes to mind is, “Oh, I 
want to share it with the group!”
So it’s about saying, what value, what gifts do we have, and how can 
we present that and share that with this following of people to gain their 
loyalty and trust?
Bob: OK. So, in terms of the life of a startup, that actually begins 
before they release, before they launch. This is because, to be a little bit 
mercenary about it, they want to have that community in place when 
they’re about to launch because they’re the people who are going to 
launch too.
Maria: Exactly. Yeah. They’re the people that become the early adopters, 
the sneezers.
The Post-Startup Community
Bob: OK. Now, let’s say that you get to that point where you’ve launched. 
You’ve got your core community of people who have found value in what 
you had to say about the things that you’re interested in, which probably 
are about the things that your startup is interested in. Is it just, from there, 
rinse, lather, and repeat? Do you just keep doing what you’re doing, or do 
you need to change focus?
Maria: Yeah, the communities evolve. Because what we’re talking 
about are startups that haven’t launched a product. If you have a look at 
a Twitter that is already launched, well, one of their communities might 
be purely all about educational resources around how do you Twitter. And 
another community may be . . . It’s understanding the different needs of 
your key stakeholders. The second version is, “How do I use this product? 
And how is it really valuable in maximizing the experience?”
Another community might be, for example, the bigger brands, like 
the Procter & Gambles. They’ve created nonprofit communities. So it’s all 

  Social Media and Your Startup
261
about positioning themselves as being the saviors in the world, and it’s 
about gaining the loyalty of these people as “Hey, we don’t only offer you 
education, we don’t only offer you a great product, but we’re doing good 
in the world. And here are some of our initiatives. Come and participate in 
supporting teenage girls in developing countries.”
So community-building has to serve the business needs. There’s no 
illusion about “Hey, let’s just go and do good and invest all of this money 
and time and not be clear on what the business outcomes are.” OK? So 
you’ve got to be able to set a very clear purpose and set up multiple com-
munities that meet different needs and try not to mix them together, 
because otherwise you start to dilute the experience of those key stake-
holders.
Bob: So you might end up with, actually, a couple of different com-
munities, depending on exactly what your focus is. I mean, doing good for 
good’s sake is one thing. Doing good to get attention on the Internet, 
because good things do tend to get attention, is another, and perhaps 
something more that startups should be thinking about.
Maria: Exactly. Procter & Gamble have 2,000 communities.
Bob: What? [laughs] Wait a minute. Huh?
Maria: They have 2,000 communities.
Bob: What are these people talking about? Procter & Gamble, I mean, 
they make soap.
Maria: That’s the point. They have one of the most successful com-
munities that’s ever been launched. It’s called BeingGirl.com, and it’s for 
teenage girls. Procter & Gamble wanted to create a community around 
hygiene. OK? But, hey, are you going to create a community where you’re 
going to sell your tampons and all of these are areas that teenage girls 
like, “Oh my God, I don’t even want to hear that word”? It’s a very, very 
sensitive topic.
But what Procter & Gamble found was that these teenage girls want 
a place where they can talk about “What happens when I first get my 
period? What do I do here?” Because they’re too afraid to talk about it 
either among their friends or to their mother. So this community has 
attracted hundreds of thousands of girls that have found a way to commu-
nicate with one another and to share their stories and ask the questions.
Procter & Gamble has doctors that are in there that are, like, “Ask 
Anne.” And then that doctor has to respond to these messages. And then, 
very subtly, in a signature, it is, “Oh, by the way, use Tampax.” It’s because 
Procter & Gamble know that the lifetime value of one of their customers 
is around about $4,000. So they know that they can afford to spend a cer-
tain percentage, say, per member, to create this community.

  Social Media and Your Startup
262
And this community has become one of the most successful and most 
profitable communities. And you could never achieve the same results if 
you were to go to Stardoll or Piczo or one of the other teenage sites, 
because they’re too generic and broad.
So what they’ve done is . . . Procter & Gamble is one of the largest 
packaged-goods companies in the world. They have hundreds of products. 
So they’ve gone and created either these big, massive, official communities 
like BeingGirl, or what they’ve done is they’ve sponsored smaller groups or 
communities so that they get a positioning in there. And what they do is 
they purely focus on adding value. None of their communities are heavily 
product-focused, unless the customers want product conversations.
The Build-or-Buy Decision
Bob: OK. Well, what’s your recommendation right now for a startup? 
Should they build their own site, or should they go with Ning or one of 
Ning’s competitors? Or does the software for this really matter?
Maria: This is the big misconception about community-building. The 
first question that I often get asked is “What technology should we use?” 
And it’s, like, forget about the technology. Have a look at the purpose, 
have a look at the people, have a look at the whole community experience, 
and then think about the technology that you need. For example, we’ve 
just built our own community. It’s expensive. We’ve even used a free software. 
We’ve used Open Source Drupal. But it cost us around about 30,000 euros 
just to get it to this point. It’s expensive.
We have one full-time resource that’s on the community. We have 
another resource that spends 20% to 50 % of her time on the community. 
I spend 20% of my time on the community. It’s really expensive, because 
once you’ve set up the community, you then have to nurture it, and you 
have to keep iterating, whether it be by features, whether it be by content.
So building your own community, I would only recommend if it’s 
absolutely core to your business, because building your own community 
has its upsides, in that you then get to retain the IP of that community, 
whereas you get to retain the database of that community. If you go and 
set up a community on Ning or Facebook, then they own that database. 
They own the content. It depends on the conditions and the rules. But if 
you have a look at the fine print, most of those community platforms own 
that content.
So once you have gone and identified what your purpose is and really 
identified what value this community is going to add: What are the met-
rics that you are going to sift for success? If your community is going to 
be the place where you can confidently retain all of your key stakeholders 

  Social Media and Your Startup
263
and converse with them on a regular basis, then what are those key stake-
holders worth to you?
Are they potentially worth 100,000 euros per annum because you’re 
spending that sort of money? OK. Then you might invest into building 
your own community and building your own community will cost you any-
where from 10,000 euros to a million Euros. It’s like how long is a piece 
of string?
There are so many solutions out there. There are 120 different white 
label platforms that you can build your community on. That’s really the 
most robust side of community building. But if you realize that you just 
want to build some special-interest groups like what I did with influence 
in marketing, and that’s really for our marketplace. It had nothing to do 
with the Moderator Community.
Then that took me two hours. It was free. I had already built my network 
over the last three years. So it was overnight I activated that community, and 
it’s very straightforward and extremely powerful. So that’s the other end of 
the extreme.
Bob: If I were to summarize your advice, I think what you are getting 
to here is this. We’re talking about business and community, so the first 
question is, what is the lifetime value of one of your customers? You should 
know what that is.
If it’s a small amount, if you are in the consumer space, that by its 
nature leads to one type of approach. If it’s a large amount of money, let’s 
say you’re more the enterprise space, where you are going to have fewer 
conversations and the conversations you are having are, quite frankly, 
worth a lot more to you, then maybe it makes sense to build something 
where you own the IP, where you can absolutely customize it to the con-
versation that you want. Is that a fair summation?
Maria: Exactly. You are spot on it. It’s identifying who your key stake-
holders are, what the value of those key stakeholders is. What’s the purpose 
of building your community? What is it that you have to offer? On a scale 
of 1 to 10, how much of a need is there for your offering? Like “Influence 
in Marketing” is the hot topic, so people are going to bust down the doors 
to get into that group. But if you’ve got something around dental care, 
then maybe it might not be so exciting. Maybe your key stakeholders 
spend very little time on the Internet. So you’ve got to identify the risk of 
what your purpose is. What’s the need for the marketplace, and how receptive 
are they going to be to that? 

  Social Media and Your Startup
264
It’s about building satellites in multiple different platforms where 
you are going to be to attract those people who are interested in your 
topic. So you might have a group on Facebook, a fan page on Facebook, a 
group in LinkedIn, a community on Ning. You might have seven different 
places, a Twitter following. You could have a Flicker group or a YouTube 
group.
There are so many different platforms out there. You have got to choose: 
Where are we going to be? Who’s going to take care of this? What budget 
are we going to set? What metrics are we going to set?
And then you might start off really small. You might just start off with 
something really straightforward like a LinkedIn group and then that 
might grow into a much bigger community where you do invest money to 
build big.
Finding Your Community Manager
Bob: OK, well let me ask you one last question. Let’s say you’re a developer/
founder. In other words, you’re a software geek here. You’ve decided that, 
yes, a core part of what your company needs to do is to be talking to peo-
ple online. You need to build all these conversations. You need basically a 
community manager.
What experience or characteristics should you look for in, let’s say, a 
cofounder whose main role is going to be community manager?
Maria: Community managers are very special people. And not every-
body can do it. Because you need, first and foremost, somebody who’s very 
good with people and can connect and communicate with people. That’s 
something that has to come naturally. You want to find somebody who is 
natural at that. If you find somebody who’s an extrovert who just rubs peo-
ple the wrong way, it can be disastrous. So finding that person is . . . it 
could be internal. It could be, hey, if you can have the CEO or founder of 
the company play that role, wonderful. But then the other thing is that 
that person is going to need to be consistent. Consistency is the second 
biggest key to community, being a community manager.
If you are going to be sending a message to people to say, hey, come 
and hang out with me, then those people are going to want to hang out 
with you; and if you are not in your community for two weeks, then that 
starts to have a detrimental effect on your community.
Then thirdly it’s being a good manager. Because as your community 
starts to grow, you need to juggle a lot of plates. You are going to be need-
ing to welcome people, respond to people’s comments, making sure they 
are posting in the right categories, posting the right type of resources.
You yourself are going need to gather valuable content to bring back 
into your community. So eventually, the bigger the community grows, you 

  Social Media and Your Startup
265
can pretty much almost spend almost full time just managing or moder-
ating your community.
Then the question becomes, well, where do you find those people if 
you don’t have them in-house? The Web works with companies where they 
have been shared by 10 different people within the company. So we have 
identified all the different roles that need to exist for this community, and 
then each of those people has been responsible for contributing a bit into 
that community.
So it’s been shared among many, many people, and it hasn’t been a 
full-time role of any one person. If you are a company that wants to hire 
somebody, my preference would be to just hire one person that has a lot of 
those, who can wear all of those hats.
The best place to find those people is within those communities and 
groups. These people need to already understand social media, understand 
the rules of engagement. They would have built their own community or 
group or participated in at least 8 to 10 groups. They would have spent at 
least one or two hours a day discussing . . . that’s a breeding ground for 
finding these community managers.
Although they might not see themselves as a community manager, if 
they get approached by somebody to say: “Hey, you’re really good at what 
you. I’ve noticed that you belong to a number of groups. You’re posting a 
lot of content. You seem to really understand this topic. We would like to 
hire you.” [laughs]
Bob: OK, so first off they have to be great with people. Second, they 
need to be consistent. They need to be able to work this day in and day 
out. How would you summarize that third point, though?
Maria: Good with people, they need consistency. Third is experience. 
They need to be experienced with social media. They need to know how to 
use the tools and leverage the tools. And join the Moderator Community, 
for example, so that they’re at the forefront of knowing how to maximize 
the value and the experience of the members of that community and group. 
The manager or motivator can make or break a community. If you aren’t 
getting it right, you can say goodbye to that community.
Recap
In this chapter we’ve been exploring the make-or-break question for a 
startup: How do you get attention in an uncaring world? Without that 
attention, nothing happens. Without that attention, no matter how long 
your financial runway, you’re going to crash and burn.
The way to get attention in this business used to be through tradi-
tional news organizations, such as trade magazines and newspapers. Those 

  Social Media and Your Startup
266
still work, but less and less so. Whereas newspapers are falling over like 
porcelain dolls in a 7.5 quake, online news blogs are coming on strong and 
very much want to hear your story.
But they don’t want their time wasted. Clueless PR efforts are worse 
than no PR efforts—you’re going to need to take the time or buy the 
expertise to know who in the news business is interested in what, and what 
they—not you—define as news.
Meanwhile, when hundreds of millions of people start spending their 
attention and time in social networks, social media, social ways online, 
that is something you as a startup founder cannot afford to ignore.
The bad news is that connecting to this new social media thing—this 
arc of change and disruption, from Twitter at one end to blogs, to “social-
ized” major sites, to social sites the size of countries—is a full-time job. 
It’s a lot of work spending the time to scan your social media radar and 
participating in hundreds—thousands—of overlapping conversations. You 
are going to need help. That means either bringing in a partner who’s 
going to do this 24/7 or making your first hire, not another developer and 
certainly not a VP for marketing, but a community manager who gets it.
The good news in this era where attention is dear and markets are 
conversations is that the social media playing field favors tiny companies 
with passionate people on a mission to bring something new into the 
world. That’s you—if you’re willing to jettison the whole marketing men-
tality with which big companies blanket our lives.
Next up, we dig in deep on exactly how to communicate your startup’s 
message. This is a subject that has tripped up many a startup. I don’t want 
your startup to end up on that casualty list.

“Four basic premises of writing: clarity, brevity, simplicity, and humanity.”
—William Zinsser (American author and editor)
If You’re Not Clear, You’re Not Selling
In this chapter, we’re going to dig into a subject almost every startup 
gets wrong the first time around. Some recover, many don’t. The subject 
is how well you present your startup’s software to first-time visitors to 
your site. The goal is to make that case in the right order, with the right 
parts, so that those prospective customers become actual customers.
Describing clearly why someone should give you money for your soft-
ware is a skill that doesn’t come naturally to most developers and startups. 
It makes us somewhat uncomfortable to do so, probably because we’re 
too close to see the benefits of what we’ve created, apart from the flaws. 
But if you’re going to succeed, you need to be able to step back, look with 
the eyes of your prospective customers at what you’re going to be selling, 
and then know how to present your case.
Before we get to two case studies illustrating how to make a case for 
your software, let’s examine a couple of assumptions and a design pattern 
I and others call the Unique Selling Proposition.
First off, I’m assuming you’ve got no desire to inflate, overplay, or 
exaggerate what your software does and no interest in bamboozling, con-
niving, or manipulating though yard-long web pages of screaming headlines, 
coercive text, pop-ups demanding your visitors’ e-mail address, gushing 
testimonials, multiple bonuses, and hidden prices. In other words, you’re 
not interested in the Internet Marketing approach to marketing your soft-
ware: Make! Money! Now! (see Figure 7-1). If you are, then return this book.

Mark Joyner or some lesser practitioner of the Dark Arts. Internet Marketing 
is the evil mutant digital offspring of the first kind of spam—direct mail 
advertising. And though I’d like to tell you that approach doesn’t work, 
someone is nonetheless making money from it and those late-night tele-
vision ads.
Figure 7-1. We are not talking about this kind of approach.
You see, I’m assuming you have an application with some real benefits 
to the right people and that those people would probably be extremely 
interested in your web or desktop app if they were properly introduced. 
The point of this chapter is to help you understand and structure honestly 
the prospective customer’s initial experience with your software—your 
home page—and communicate clearly your value to them.
With that out of the way, let’s take a quick look at something I’ve 
written about elsewhere2 at much greater length: the Unique Selling 
Proposition pattern.

  Clarity Matters
269
The Unique Selling 
Proposition Pattern
Let me put what I’m talking about here into programmer-speak. The 
Unique Selling Proposition (USP) is a robust and powerful marketing 
design pattern that can effectively save you from designing spaghetti-like 
marketing that’s hard to understand, let alone maintain. It’s a pattern 
for connecting what you are selling to the right people in the right way so 
that they are eager to purchase.
What’s more, it’s an extremely efficient, effective, and elegant pattern 
that can be used and reused in a wide variety of circumstances. It’s a pat-
tern that has been employed successfully on literally thousands of projects 
worldwide. Marketing is just another programming language. And the 
USP pattern is one of its most useful and flexible design patterns.
Another way to describe the USP is that it’s the set of expectations 
most people have about what is—and is not—good software from a trust-
worthy vendor worth their attention.
All right, enough chatter. Let’s walk through the components of a 
USP, the timeline of how a typical prospective customer sees—or doesn’t 
see—these components, and what the USP means for your startup web 
site’s home page.
The Hook
When people go to a web site for the first time, there’s logically going to 
be one thing they perceive and comprehend first. They are going to glance 
at the site and make—literally—a split-second decision to stay or go based 
on the first thing they see. Your job as a founder of a startup that wants 
to succeed is to control as much as possible the first thing prospective 
customers see on your web site and to make sure that what they see or 
read connects with them so that they keep reading. It’s a big Internet out 
there, and that new arrival to your wonderful web site cares not one bit 
about it, about you, or about your startup—yet.
The job of the hook is to give potential customers a reason to care (a 
little), to read on (a little), and to think that there might be some value at 
your site that’s worth a few seconds more of their valuable time.
Now, before you mentally complain that your startup is different, that 
your app is so interesting that, of course, prospective customers are going

to analyze your 23 bullet points and decipher your 193 industry-specific 
terms, ask yourself what you did the last time you went looking for some-
thing on the Web. You probably did a Google search, opened a bunch of 
pages, quickly scanned through the lot, with your fingers poised to press 
Ctrl-W, and without a second’s hesitation chopped any page that didn’t 
look right, didn’t tell you that you were on the right page for what you 
wanted, didn’t make unequivocally clear what it was offering. Why would 
your prospective customers act any differently?
Let’s take a closer look at what your prospective customers are look-
ing for in the first couple of seconds.
■They want to know that they haven’t navigated to some weird, 
spammy, amateur, possibly dangerous site.
■They want to know that the site is relevant, that it relates to what 
they want.
■They want to know what you intend to offer them.
Here, then, are the three key elements of the hook: credibility, relevant 
value, and a clear offer. These are also the main components of a compel-
ling Unique Selling Proposition.
The hook needs to be the first words to which the prospective cus-
tomer’s eye is drawn. That’s usually accomplished by making its text three 
times larger than any other headline on the page, with plenty of white 
space around it to set it off. But the right text size isn’t enough. Let’s look 
at each of these elements in turn.
Credibility
Whatever you say in that one- or two-sentence hook should be honest, 
not hyperbole, believable, not bull. Claims such as “Best,” “Revolutionary,” 
“Industry Leader,” “Unique,” and “Easy to Use” immediately trigger most 
people’s MFR—marketing filter response.3 Now, maybe your web app is 
revolutionary, unique, easy to use, and more. Fine. But first you have to 
establish some trust between you and would-be buyers, and then you must 
introduce and back up your claims. Remember, they’ve just opened a 
bunch of web sites via Google, and they’re itching for a reason to close 
your page. Don’t give them one.
3  Did you think it was an accident that all those weird television ads with impossible claims and 
promises are on late-night television?

  Clarity Matters
271
Instead, here are three good ways to establish your credibility via 
your hook.
■Show that you speak their language, that you understand the need 
that brought them to your page, their mindset, their vocabulary for 
describing things in this part of their world.
■Don’t use terms at the beginning of the sales conversation that blow 
your credibility.
■Don’t try the patience of your prospective customer. Get to the point.
I know, I know, you want to mention in your hook all your software’s 
really cool features, because, well, they’re cool. Don’t! Your prospective 
customers need to grasp easily why you matter to them, what in the news 
business is called the “So what?” test.
Relevant Value
Let’s move on to the second component of the hook and, for that matter, 
of you’re entire site: relevant value. Value depends on relevance. Relevance 
can be as simple as “I’m a happy Windows user. What do I care about Mac 
apps?” 4 It’s all about what’s at the top of the pain/I Want list of your cus-
tomers-to-be when they arrive at your web site.
Some of my clients initially want to try to be as relevant as possible to 
anyone and everyone having any need, however tangential, for what they’re 
selling. Doesn’t work—and it costs credibility points. Let’s put it this way: 
What’s the one thing about your web or desktop app that matters most to 
the one or two kinds of people who constitute your collection of market 
segments? That’s the relevant value you want to put upfront and center in 
your hook.
What Are You Trying to Sell Them?
Are you trying to sell a web app, a Windows or Mac app, an Apple iPhone 
or Google Android or Windows Smartphone app? Do you want people to 
buy it, subscribe to it, get consulting on it, or consume it for free? Given 
the number of ways software is being delivered today, people visiting this 
site need to know what platform your startup’s software is for and how 
you intend to charge them for it.
4  Of course, there are no happy Windows users, just some who have a higher pain threshold and can 
endure almost anything before they beg for mercy (joke!).

  Clarity Matters
272
So you should tell them they can choose a free 30-day trial or a free 
account, right? Nope. Those are things in your marketing toolbox, just as 
glossy brochures and info packets were during the last century. Worse, 
including the F-word (free) in the hook, only to have potential customers 
find out that you’re talking about a limited account or a trial version, is 
like sticking a hard drive in a microwave: the results are not pretty.
When you walk into a store, you know you’re going to grab things off 
the shelves, walk to the front of the store, and pay for them. If you go to 
Amazon, you’re going to click a button to put the item into your Amazon 
cart or, if you’re logged in, you’re going to click one of the three orange 
Buy Now buttons to do your business. Your customers need the same kind 
of guidance from you when they are comprehending your hook; they need 
to know you are selling them something and what form that something is 
going to take.
Credibility Markers
OK, enough about the hook. Let’s look at the other parts of the Unique 
Selling Proposition pattern, starting with an expanded view of this whole 
“Should I trust you?” thing: credibility markers. There are two aspects to 
this part of the USP: (1) what you say and how you say it and (2) whether 
you’ve competently included the standard things most online buyers look 
for in order to pass judgment on a site. Let’s deal with the latter first. Here’s 
the short list.
■Do you identify your company by providing its logo, physical/mailing 
address, phone number, and general e-mail? If not, why would you 
expect people to give an anonymous page their credit card info? 
Now, I realize that startups in some parts of the world—eastern Europe 
and Russia come to mind—think their customers in the United 
States will penalize them. Some will, although not as many as you 
think and not if you do the right things.5 But the cost of not having 
this information on your site is far higher.
■Did you include a copyright notice and, if you mention other compa-
nies’ products on the page, a trademark disclaimer? You’re running 
a business; these are the signposts of a business.
5  Such as having a very detailed About page showing who you are and where; making sure your site’s 
text is written in grammatically perfect English; using a blog and other social media so that people can 
get to know you; and having a product that’s loaded with real value.

  Clarity Matters
273
■Is the price of what you are selling shown either on the home page 
or where you expect people to sign up?
■Is it clear and unmistakable what people have to do to buy your app 
or service and, for that matter, to try it?
■When a person goes to buy your app or web service, do you make 
clear what your refund policy is and, if you are using a third-party 
payment processor (see Chapter 5), who that processor is?
■Does the site look professional and businesslike, whatever that 
means in your particular online industry?
■Do you have testimonials praising your product or web app from 
other people who visitors may already trust or with whom they can 
at least associate themselves? Is at least one of those testimonials 
on the home page?
The people looking at your web site expect and understand that they 
are involved in a specific social situation called a sale. This sale situation 
has its own etiquette, its own rhythm, its own do’s and don’ts—ignore 
them at your financial peril.
Famous People Saying Nice Things About You
Testimonials and (positive) reviews are a big part of establishing the over-
all credibility of your offering. The comfort factor goes way up when 
prospective customers see the name of a media organization or a promi-
nent blog or logo on your home page. We covered this in some depth in 
Chapter 6, but in this context the thing to know is that no matter how 
many steps it takes, you want those media/blogger reviews—they really 
matter.
The word famous has a television definition like everything else, but 
don’t forget that famous could mean the head of surgery at a major hospital 
if you are selling surgery-related software or, for that matter, the head 
tree surgeon at a well-known landscaping company if you’re selling soft-
ware to landscaping companies.
It’s all about relevance—and since many of your customers may not 
take what “authorities” say seriously, positive quotes from real people who 
use your software and are willing to say, they use and like your software 
can be just as important. Notice that I didn’t say “purchased your soft-
ware” in that last sentence. The catch-22 of not getting sales because you 
have zero testimonials and having zero testimonials because you have no 
sales is best fixed when you do either your initial or your major release 
public beta.

  Clarity Matters
274
Of course, if you establish your credibility but don’t communicate 
your relevant value, your job’s at best half done.
Relevant Value
Once a visitor is past the hook, relevant value is all about bullet points. 
No, I’m not talking about bullet points that escaped a corporate PowerPoint 
presentation. I’m talking about a modern startup benefit and customer-
centric bullet points.
Let’s look at a good example from the startup freckle time tracking. 
First off, a good modern bullet point isn’t just text, it’s a headline to pre-
view the message and give it a mental peg to hang on to. And it’s small 
visual image to associate with the feature. And it’s ultra-easy to read and 
comprehend block of text that is about you the prospective customer, not 
me the amazing startup (see Figure 7-2).
Figure 7-2. The ammo for your startup: benefit bullet points
The word you appears four times in this one bullet point. Amy Hoy, 
Thomas Fuchs, and the two other founders use the word you or the like 31 
times on freckle’s home page.6 It’s all about the customer, not about your 
product and certainly not about your startup.
Something else you should notice about this benefit bullet point: it’s 
simple—no jargon, no long sentences. The goal is customer comprehen-
sion, not data packing.

275
You’ll have to visit freckle time tracking (http://letsfreckle.com) 
to realize how each of its four bullet points—that’s right, only four—
backs up and buttresses the site’s hook (“freckle time tracking helps you 
do more of what you love, and less of what you don’t.”). If you haven’t 
nailed the customer after that many shots, something is wrong with your 
ammunition.
The Final Piece of the USP Puzzle
Before we get to the Case Studies there’s the last component of the pro-
cess: asking for the sale. You are selling, they’re (maybe) buying, and it’s 
your job to ask nicely for their money.
Should you do this by having an unmissable Buy Now button, or should 
you go for the sale via the indirect route of the free 30-day trial? Do both, 
because you’re dealing with the entire bell curve here, from the earliest 
adopters who will buy anything they consider shiny to the middle-of-the-
road folks who’ve been burned and want to taste your wine before they buy 
a case.7
And what if your startup doesn’t actually sell something, like our first 
case study, Mint.com? You don’t actually have to have to sell, do you? Yes, 
you do. If you don’t ask for the sale, whatever that means for your startup, 
then you leave visitors hanging, wondering what they are supposed to do 
next. So even if you’ve found a cool way to get someone other than your 
customers to pay for your startup, get comfortable asking them to take 
the next step leading where you want them to go; it’s the only way they’ll 
get there.
Case Study: Mint.com

Area: Personal financial management.
Platform(s): Web, Apple iPhone, and SMS text.
Summary: At the time of this writing (mid-January 2009), Mint.com 
had gone from zero users to over 800,000, with a whopping 23,000 people 
signing up the day before my interview with 28-year-old CEO Aaron Patzer. 
The free consumer personal financial manager makes its revenue when its 
patent-pending search algorithm finds a way to save money for a customer 
7  This raises an interesting point I’ll leave up to you to think about: What’s the bell curve of your pri-
mary market segment? Are you going for the early adopters, the online mainstream where the money 
is, or those just now joining the show. It’s a good thing to know in terms of how you construct your USP.

and that customer chooses to accept that offer. Since starting in Novem-
ber 2006, Mint.com has raised a total of $17.45 million in three rounds of 
equity funding.8 Those are impressive numbers.
For purposes of this chapter, let’s have a look at the home page of 
Mint.com (see Figure 7-3).
■Any chance you’ll miss the hook of Mint.com? Nope. And while it’s a 
pretty big claim, notice how it’s buttressed by great major media 
quotes right under it? That deactivates most people’s marketing 
filter response.
■The PC Editor’s Choice award certainly helps, as does the customer 
testimonial that leads to an entire page of both test and video 
customer testimonials.9
■The VeriSign, TRUSTe, and McAfee badges at the bottom help further 
establish the credibility of Mint.com.
■Aaron would agree with you that establishing Mint.com’s credibility 
was the hardest hurdle to jump (see the upcoming interview). If you 
click down to their Privacy and Security page, you won’t get privacy 
boilerplate. Instead, you get a video of Aaron talking about security 
and, page after page, covering exactly why you can trust Mint.com 
with your financial data and bank passwords.
Bank passwords? Danger! Danger! We’ve all been trained by authori-
ties and spammers never, ever, ever to give out that information. Yet people 
are doing just that—in droves. Partly because Mint.com spells out exactly 
what happens to that information, how it is a read-only app (you can’t 
move money around), how while your financial data is in the cloud, your 
identity is never asked for.
Here’s what Aaron had to say about the trust issue, what it took to get 
his initial funding, and why he decided to build Mint.com.
8  http://www.crunchbase.com/company/mint is wrong: First Round Capital’s investment was 
part of the angel round, not separate. So says Aaron, and he should know.

are powerful. Check out 12seconds and, of course, YouTube.

Interview with Aaron Patzer, CEO, Mint.com
Bob: Let’s start with how you decided that Mint.com was something you 
wanted to do.
Aaron: Yes, I had started a couple of businesses back in high school, 
building web sites and doing online marketing. When the Internet was 
quite new, I guess, it was back in sort of the 1996–97 era. And that’s how 
I put myself through college, went to Duke and then to Princeton.

So I was combining doing my personal and business finances and I 
was using Quicken and Microsoft Money to sort of separate out my personal 
and my business finances. I was really religious about getting in there and 
entering all my transactions and balancing all my accounts, categorizing 
everything.
I did that probably every Sunday afternoon, for an hour every Sunday, 
every week for about eight years. Then I got really busy with another job. 
I was working as a software architect for another startup, and I didn’t log 
into Quicken for, like, five months. When I got in there it downloaded 
about 500 transactions from my banks that said, hey, your bank balance 
just doesn’t match your Quicken balance. Will you please reconcile these 
500 transactions.
I thought, man, that’s going to take me all weekend to get back to 
square one. And it just dawned on me that I been putting all this work and 
all this effort into a system that really wasn’t giving me anything back in 
return. Why did I have to balance my checkbook anyway? The electronic 
version of my checkbook can’t just figure it out for me?
I was incredibly frustrated and I realized it was a huge waste of time 
and I didn’t want to do it anymore, and it turned out I wasn’t alone in my 
frustration. Turned out there were a lot of people who really didn’t like 
Quicken and Microsoft Money anymore, half of the people didn’t even get 
through the installation process, because it was so cumbersome to set up.
So the core idea started out in my frustration, and the core idea was 
to make personal finance effortless and simple. You know, get in and out 
in five minutes a week or less and get set up in five to ten minutes to get 
all of your accounts in there.
Bob: OK, well, I’ve used Quicken and I actually used Microsoft Money 
and I don’t do it on Sundays; I do it on Fridays. But I know exactly the frus-
tration you’re talking about. How does Mint.com solve the problem?
Aaron: Yes, it’s a free online application and links to 7,500 banks, 
credit cards, loans, and brokerages. So instead of the setup process you go 
through with, say, Microsoft Money, where you buy the software in the 
store, you install it on your computer that takes 20 minutes, and you go 
through 30 different setup screens, search for your bank, enter your cre-
dentials, what you want to rename and call these bank accounts, how you 
want to rename transactions.
Mint.com basically makes intelligent decisions for you. All you have 
to do is search for your bank and enter your username and password; after 
that point it will update your balances, your transactions, your bill-due 
dates. It will pull it in every single night, whether you logged in or not, 
sends you bill reminders, low-balance alerts, credit alerts. Things that the 
desktop program can’t do because a desktop program is only running

when that application is open. So it’s always up to date and it’s always 
watching your back, 24/7, making sure you don’t have any late fees, mak-
ing sure the bank doesn’t charge you any fee, and it categorizes 
everything for you.
So I spent about three or four months alone in a room working on a 
patent pending categorization program so that it knows that when you go 
to Rose’s Café, that’s a coffee shop, or that the “Superior Court” entry, 
despite its name, is actually a racquetball court and not a traffic ticket or 
something. So there is a tremendous amount of technology behind it. We 
get five patents in what were doing.
Bob: Whoa! Let me ask you about something, from sort of the mar-
keting point of view here. Financial tracking desktop software has been 
around for, well, at least 15 years that I know of.
Aaron: Yup.
Bob: But nobody seemed to have the right mix of message and fea-
tures to convince people to put their financial information on a web site, 
somewhere that we don’t even know where they exist. How do you deal 
with this issue of credibility?
Aaron: Yeah. I mean, every venture capitalist I talked to in the early 
days said that Mint.com would definitely fail because people would never 
trust a startup with their financial information, and certainly they were 
never going to enter their bank username and password. But we need your 
bank username and bank password if were going to sort of essentially get 
your information out.
The banks need to know it’s you that’s authorized it. So there are a 
number of things we did with our messaging. Every reporter asks about 
security, so we spent a lot of time talking about what to do with security 
from an engineering standpoint and then how to brand that.
Mint.com has bank-level security. We have all the same encryption 
and backend protections that a bank would. We have outside security 
auditing, by hacker-safe outfits, and we verify signing outside, late-night 
hackers, they’re called, who try to break into the system, who haven’t 
so far.
We are a read-only system, so you can’t actually move money around. 
So even if somebody breaks in, that person can’t drain your accounts. And 
we’re anonymous, so we made a conscious decision not to request name, 
age, address, phone number, social security number, anything like that; 
we only ask for e-mail and a zip code.
So even if somebody broke in, got into our database, he wouldn’t know 
who you are; he just knows happygirl17@yahoo drinks a lot of Starbucks 
coffee or something.

Bob: So like cutting off the head of the information, who you are 
actually are . . .
Aaron: Exactly, but no personal identifying information. And then 
the other thing is Mint.com helps actually protect you. So we’ve turned 
the security issue 180º into a strength because Mint.com is going out and 
monitoring your four or five different credit cards that you have in your 
wallet, every single night.
And so 90% of all fraud occurs offline, not online. You’re much more 
likely to get your credit card stolen at a restaurant or a gas station or if 
somebody is actually physically handling your card. The alternative is you 
can log into four or five different web sites every day and check for fraud, 
or you link them into Mint.com and Mint.com will just tell you if there’s 
suspicious activity on your card.
Bob: Hence the alerts about these 25-cent charges that started pop-
ping up on various people’s accounts.
Aaron: Yes, and on our database; and we let those users know that 
their accounts may have been compromised, certainly not at Mint.com, 
but somewhere else. Well, I guess they lost 25 cents in it, but they should 
probably have those credit cards reissued by their provider.
Bob: OK, let’s talk more about money. Specifically you’re saying that 
when you talked to VCs, they were of the attitude that this is never going 
to fly because nobody is going to give you any personal financial information.
Aaron: Yes.
Bob: When you got your first round of capital, which according to 
CrunchBase was $325,000, how did you sell that?
Aaron: I found one guy who believed in the vision or was willing to 
take a bet on me and the team that I put together. Here’s the catch of ven-
ture funding. It was in spring of 2006. I went to see Sequoia. And I came 
in and gave them a pitch, and they said, good idea, but no one will trust it 
and, by the way, you have no team and no product, so there’s no way we 
can ever give you money. The catch-22 is they only want to invest in some-
thing they know will work or is starting to work.
Bob: Right.
Aaron: But you need money in order to get it to that point. We won’t 
invest in the company unless they’ve built a product, but you need money 
to build the product. I built Mint.com off my own savings and sat alone in 
a room for seven months and worked 14 hours a day, seven days a week, 
until I basically got a prototype of the system—front end, graphics, func-
tionality, everything.
Then I was able to do a demo in front an investor, Josh Kopelman 
(First Round Capital), who’s the founder of half.com. He said, yes, I think 
this might work, but, to help with the trust aspect, don’t use the domain 

  Clarity Matters
281
mymint.com, which is from before; mint.com is much more valuable. We 
spent three months negotiating for mint.com because that’s a much bet-
ter name and a more trustworthy name.
Bob: Was Josh the person you were referring to that was your first VC 
believer?
Aaron: Yes, he was.
Bob: And just to clarify here, what then was the $325,000 that 
CrunchBase is referring to? Is that the money and time you put into it?
Aaron: That’s how much that First Round Capital themselves put in.
Bob: OK.
Aaron: The $750,000 was $325,000 from First Round Capital and 
$425,000 from other investors.
Bob: Hence don’t always believe what you read on the Web. Let me 
ask you: How about when you went to talk to the banks and the credit 
cards and Visa International and you’re saying, hey, look, we want to put 
all this information online, how about it? How did you convince what is 
basically a whole bunch of conservative people that this was in their interest?
Aaron: Yes, there’s a way around that, in that someone else had already 
solved that problem. In the late 1990s Microsoft and Intuit developed the 
OFX standard, which was the Open Financial Exchange. That lets you sync 
up with bank servers and, if you have credentials, download transactions 
and balances and things like that.
Some banks use that. And the banks that didn’t support that, we part-
nered with a company called Yodlee [http://www.yodlee.com], and they 
do what’s known as screen scrapping, which is essentially logging in as the 
user; they pull down the web pages and pull out the columns of data rep-
resenting your transactions and your balances.
They already had those relationships set up, and they were already 
partnered with Bank of America and some of the large institutions.
Bob: So, bottom line, it wasn’t a problem. It was basically outsourced 
to Yodlee for those people who don’t use the sort of standard industry 
format.
Aaron: That’s right.
Bob: There’s not that many people in their mid-20s who already have 
800,000 users. To what do you attribute your success?
Aaron: Well, first and foremost, solving a real need and a real pain 
point that people have. I mean, every adult in the Free World needs to 
manage his money, and existing tools just made it way too difficult. Then 
bank web sites, well, they only show you your balance for a particular 
credit card or a particular account.
The average American has 11 different accounts where they need 
some way to track all of it. All their loans, all their investments, their

401Ks, their IRAs, their credit cards, their checking and savings accounts. 
We just made it really easy to do that, really easy navigation. We hired a 
designer, a user action designer, who built apple.com, so we took our 
inspiration from Apple and then we focused a lot on the product and the 
usability and the user interface.
We brought actual people in to help with software, like right off the 
street. A woman brought her kid with a stroller in and tested mint.com out 
while the kid was screaming. We brought people who were in their 40s and 
50s and people who were in their 20s, men and women. Got a diverse set 
of people in and saw where they were using the software well and the places 
where things weren’t going well. Just took a really user-centric approach.
Once we launched, I will basically do any and every interview from any 
blogger or any press.
Bob: [laughs] OK, that helps.
Aaron: Yes.
Bob: One more question on that. Did going multiplatform . . . In 
other words, you start as a web app and now you’ve added an iPhone inter-
face. How much did that help?
Aaron: Well, it’s been four weeks, but it’s helped tremendously. We 
are the number 1 finance application in the finance category in the apps 
store, which means we’ve beaten Bank of America, Wells Fargo, PayPal, the 
AT&T mobile banking system. At one point we were ranked as high as 
number 30 on the top 100 free applications overall, and we’re the only 
finance app ever to have done that. We were almost as high as Pandora and 
Facebook at one point.
Bob: Was this part of your strategy way back when, that you wanted to 
diversify across platforms, or was it, Hey, wow, this iPhone is incredibly 
cool. Lots of people are buying them. Let’s go for it.
Aaron: Well, we didn’t launch right when the iPhone launched. What 
we did was we did some user research and found out that 40% of our users 
had iPhones. And of the 60% who didn’t have them, half of them were 
planning to buy one within the next year.
The overlap between Mint.com’s user base and iPhone usage was 
insane, it was phenomenal. It was a highly requested feature, so we put 
some engineers on it and got it out in very short order and launched it. I 
always knew that I wanted Mint.com to be mobile, but originally I thought 
that was going to be text message based.
You can actually—and you’ve been able to do this for four months 
now—you can get text message alerts and little reminders and you can 
query for your balances. You just text shortcode mymint.
Bob: OK.

  Clarity Matters
283
Aaron: And type the word balance or bal. It’ll send you your balances 
back when you’re at a restaurant and you want to figure if you have enough 
money to pick up the tab. Or if you’re in a store and you want to make a 
purchase and you want to see how much you’ve got on your credit card 
bill, it will tell you your balances right then.
Bob: OK. If you’re sitting down with yourself right now and you’re 
going to do another type of startup, another whole new venture, what les-
sons have you learned that you’d want to pass on to avoid some pain?
Aaron: Well, managing, raising capital, and figuring out what value 
the company should be at and when you should raise and when you shouldn’t 
is definitely a big lesson that I didn’t entirely understand until after raising a 
couple of rounds of financing.
The other lesson would be: hiring people is the very most important 
thing that you do at a company, a greater focus on the interview process, 
and training everyone to interview people well and deliberately. A lot of 
times people interview and they get into a room and they’re, like, Well, I 
thought that guy sounded like he knew what he was talking about.
You need well-defined criteria for how you evaluate: who asks what 
questions. Make sure you cover all areas of technical and management 
skills. Ask the same sort of technical questions between two engineering 
candidates so that you can compare them head to head accurately, effi-
ciently. All those things matter, but they’re actually not done all that well 
in most companies.
Bob: Well, there is one more question that I really should ask: Here 
we are in 2009; the offline economy is looking like a train wreck.
Aaron: Yes.
Bob: Do you think it’s a good, or a bad, or a great, or a horrible time 
to create a startup?
Aaron: I think if you’re solving a real problem, it’s always a good time 
to start a company, because if you don’t do it, someone else will.
Case Study: RescueTime
URL: http://www.rescuetime.com/
Disclosure: I did some strategy/positioning consulting with Tony 
Wright in 2008.
Area: Time management—individual, small business, and enterprise.
Platform(s): Web, with GUI-less Windows and Mac clients.
Summary: RescueTime puts a new spin on time management: target 
people who live at their keyboards and require zip effort on their part to 
track how much time they’re spending on which apps and web sites.

Now, it may seem that CEO and founder Tony Wright has built a 
YARTTA—yet another Rails time tracking app. Well, the investors who’ve 
put up $900,000 after the initial Y Combinator seed round of funding beg 
to differ.
Chris Sacca, one of RescueTime’s investors, had this to say about the 
Seattle-based startup to the BBC’s Business Daily podcast.10
I have a little company called RescueTime. It’s free for individuals 
and $4 to $8 a month. It watches and helps you understand where you 
spend your time online. So you’re able to set time goals and targets for 
yourself so you realize, “Wow. I’m spending a lot of time on Twitter; 
maybe I need to focus back on my [business] Gmail account.”
So that actually make employees 9% more efficient in the first month they 
use it. So companies are really excited to pay for it. They pay such a small 
fee for it, so the company does really well, despite being such a small 
company, and all the users are very happy to use it.
RescueTime’s challenge, and why they’re a case study for this chapter, is 
how you communicate clearly your startup’s value to three different audi-
ences, all of which have seen so many time management apps they’ve lost 
count (see Figure 7-4).
■Start with a simple, brief hook, essentially the same for all three 
market segments.
■Next, talk about what matters to each market segment. Effortless 
Time Tracking for individuals and small businesses; Business Intel-
ligence You’ve Never Had Before for enterprise.
■The AS SEEN IN bar has some very heavy media hitters: check out 
the following interview with Tony for how he got these positive 
mentions.
■Make your web site’s layout back up your message. Here, Tony is 
selling effortlessness, and the site could not be easier to understand 
or navigate.
Time management has been around for over a century. But what Tony 
and RescueTime are doing here is addressing the relatively new problem 
of reduced productivity, due primarily to oversurfing the Web, while steer-
ing well clear of evil software that involuntarily tracks employees’ every 
keystroke, glance, and moment.

Here’s what Tony had to say about how he got into Y Combinator, 
what that did for him, how he raised $900,000 after that, and what’s left 
on his to-do list.
Tony Wright, CEO, RescueTime
Bob: Let me ask you about RescueTime. First off, where did you get 
the idea?
Tony: It was born out of our personal inability to understand how we 
spend our time. Every day we had a scrum agile meeting. We’re a bunch of 
software geeks. Everyone’s job would say what they’d accomplished in the 
last 24 hours and what they were going to do in the next 24. We found that 
people’s ability to articulate what they’d done, literally, just in the last 
workday, was terrible. People would say, well, I felt busy but I can’t really 
articulate what I did.
We wanted to understand that, but we recognize that despite all these 
time management books that say keep a log of how you spend your time, 

  Clarity Matters
286
that’s incredibly impractical for a technology worker who’s shifting between 
applications and websites, sometimes in 10-, 20-second blocks.
We wanted something that was totally passive that would answer those 
questions for us and for our business without actually requiring data 
entry, which is no fun.
Bob: So the biggest point was making it, as you say in your first bullet 
here, effortless.
Tony: Well, yeah. From a business perspective, whether you’re a 
freelancer or a business, the idea is that time is precious. It’s really hard 
to do a good job. If you screw up and don’t do a good job for a couple of 
days, that data is irrecoverable. The effort was the thing that we thought 
prevented all knowledge workers from having this data at their finger-
tips—it’s just too much of a pain in the butt.
Bob: Time management has actually been around for over a century 
now in one form or another. How did you break through people’s resis-
tance to, oh, it’s just another time tracking application?
Tony: I’m not entirely sure we’re done breaking through, but we’re 
still trying. I think we’ve done a good job on a couple of fronts. I think one 
of the biggest things for us is that it does have a twist. I don’t know if 
you’ve read the book called Made to Stick,11 but it’s about sticky ideas. 
One of the things that makes an idea sticky is that it’s surprising. What 
we’ve done is put a surprising twist of—everyone’s done time entry at one 
point or another in his or her life, or a lot of people have. Everyone’s famil-
iar with the concept. We’ve basically said this is just going to happen.
We also have some surprising stuff, in the sense of people who use it 
tend to be shocked by what they see. People have a picture in their head of 
what they think they do with their time. What they actually do with their 
time has only a bare relationship to that sometimes.
We get a lot of credibility and a lot of breakthrough, in that people 
talk about this. So they use RescueTime, they may go on Twitter, or they 
go on their blog, or they sit down at a bar somewhere and say, “Dear Lord, 
look what I found out. I had no idea.” And that creates questions in other 
people’s minds.
I think that part of the breakthrough comes from the kind of word-of-
mouth engine; if you hear about something from someone else whom you 
trust, that’s huge. That’s basically them saying, “Yes, I understand that 
time management is something that everyone’s tried and looked at and

House, 2007), http://www.madetostick.com

paid attention to and gotten frustrated with. But look what I did. It worked. 
I learned some things. I’m now smarter about myself.”
The way we talked about is important, but I think the way we created 
something that made other people talk about it was arguably more 
important.
Bob: OK. Well, part of the credibility that really comes across when I 
look at this web site . . . By the way, I am disclosing we’ve done a little 
business together here. I look and I see New York Times, the BBC, PC 
World, Lifehacker, U.S. News, BusinessWeek, TechCrunch. How do you get 
all these major media brands to talk about you? Is there a strategy there, 
or did it happen by chance?
Tony: I would love to pat myself on the back for that or pat someone 
on our team on the back for that. I think, what we did, again, was, if I 
could give one bit of marketing advice for people, I would say get the book 
Made to Stick. It is absolutely awesome. I think we kind of stumbled into 
that. But that’s how I map it—we really, again, created surprising data 
and we have some surprising data in aggregate. This is kind of a web-based 
service. This is in the cloud and has all the advantages web-based e-mail 
has over Outlook, for example.
And what we get as a result of that is the ability to say that the aver-
age person spends X hours in e-mail. Or the average person shifts to an 
instant message window 77 times per day. So, if you use IM, you’re shifting 
to an instant message window 77 times per day on average.
Now there’s obviously a mean. That kind of data, I think, really . . .
Bob: . . . creates headlines.
Tony: If you mention that to a reporter or a blogger and they say, “I 
can build an article around that,” whether it’s an article on how people 
could sort of manage instant message more effectively or just a sort of 
shock piece of, gosh, look how knowledge workers aren’t getting stuff 
done.
Bob: Are these media brands calling you, or are you calling them? Do 
you send out press releases? Walk me through here.
Tony: Yeah, so we’re not doing anything. We don’t have anyone who’s 
dedicated PR. I’m probably the closest thing to that as CEO. There are a 
couple overt things that we did. For example, we took this data that we 
thought was pretty shocking, the aggregate data of the entire user base, 
and made a little spreadsheet of: here are the top 100 applications and 
web sites that people are spending time on. We kind of made a list of that 
and what percentage they work. You could see, like, how much percentage 
time people spent on communication stuff or productivity stuff or word 
processing or what have you, or Google.

  Clarity Matters
288
Then whatever we found, a surprising bit like that with that particular 
list, we sent that to TechCrunch. TechCrunch said, “Oh, we can build an 
article around that.” I believe it was called “Early Adopters Still Sticking 
with Microsoft” or desktop products, or some such.
Showing the idea that, hey, while there is all this wonderful stuff in 
the cloud where you can word process and do spreadsheets and stuff, people 
are still really using the old-style desktop software for this stuff. Outlook is 
more dominant than Gmail. And, you know, we have pretty early-adopter 
audience yet.
So we would do stuff like that. I’ve done a speaking engagement as a 
result of the Y Combinator thing, because we were kind of in the produc-
tivity space. I think we got tapped for that. Someone asked Paul Graham 
if he knew a good startup to be on a panel at the Churchill Club, so I did 
a speaking engagement at the Churchill Club.
Bob: It sounds to me like one of your core strategies was to be 
remarkable.
Tony: Yeah, and, really, the subset of remarkable of the sort of surpris-
ing kind. Obviously, we could be incredibly beautiful. I mean, we try to 
focus a little bit on graphic design, but I don’t think we’re anywhere in the 
top 5% of most stunning web sites out there. But there’s lots of remarkable 
things. We’ve really focused on the sort of surprising, and I think that’s 
the sort of asset we have.
Bob: OK.
Tony: Really, I think that’s one of the lessons that I really learned is 
that you need to have that twist, that hook that makes someone do a dou-
ble take, and whether they say, “Wait a minute. There’s no data entry” or 
“Wait a minute. People spend that much time doing that?” Something 
that basically makes someone give that second look, because of just the 
noise level out there, you need to have something like that.
Bob: You mentioned Y Combinator. Tell me what your experience 
was like.
Tony: It was kind of a forcing function for us. Y Combinator’s basi-
cally a software incubator in the Valley that basically takes you into the 
Valley. You have to be down there for three months. So we relocated from 
Seattle to do this.
Bob: Now, who is “we”—you, or you and your partner?
Tony: Yeah. I had two cofounders. We were getting some traction and 
some exciting interest in our product. We had done a permission-market-
ing kind of campaign. At the very beginning of this, we weren’t sure that 
anybody wanted it. So we put up a little, three-page splash site that said, 
“Hey, here’s some screenshots that are fake of what we’re building, and if 
you’d like to have this, give us your e-mail address and we’ll let you know 
when we launch.”

  Clarity Matters
289
Bob: And how many people responded?
Tony: Well, on the basis of literally that three-page HTML site with no 
code behind it, we got on TechCrunch. And the way we got on TechCrunch 
was, again, very organic. We didn’t pitch them. We posted on a couple of 
forums in various places: “Hey, here’s a site.” And all we really wanted to 
do was measure, for every 100 people who we can get to come to the site, 
what percentage of them will give us their e-mail address? What is their 
sort of take rate for this value proposition and these screenshots that 
we’re pitching?
And we found that about a third of the users who came to the site 
would give us their e-mail address, which was very encouraging. TechCrunch 
will give you 12,000 to 14,000 uniques over a weeklong period. I mean, 
we got about 4,000 from TechCrunch, and then a lot of splash coverage 
from that.
Bob: So you started by saying to the world, “This is what we’re going 
to do. Do you want us to do it?”
Tony: Yeah. [laughs]
Bob: And no code, other than whatever form you had.
Tony: Yep.
Bob: And from there you got press, because TechCrunch picked it up, 
because they decided to pick it up. Did you apply to Y Combinator? Did 
they come to you? How did that happen?
Tony: Y Combinator has an application process. And the Y Combina-
tor thing was kind of my idea to my cofounders to say, “Hey, I want us all 
to jump into this full time.” And we all had full-time jobs. We were fairly 
well compensated for what we did. So Y Combinator was sort of a, “Hey, if 
Y Combinator accepts our application, that will be sort of the thing that 
pushes us out of the nest, so to speak.” [laughs] So we did apply. It’s a 
one-and-a-half-page application, very small. It takes probably a couple 
hours to fill out well. And so the process, they won’t publish how many 
people apply, but it’s in the sort of thousands of people apply for about 
20-ish company slots.
Bob: OK.
Tony: And they will basically call you if they like your application and 
fly out—I think, for us, it was about 50 or 60 people—to go through a 
10-minute interview process. We managed to get 17 minutes, so we were 
fairly encouraged by that. But that is the amount of time that they give to 
you. And that interview process is just riotous in its chaos. It’s pretty 
amazing. So you go in, and you think you have this agenda and this demo 
that you’re going to pitch. And they very strongly emphasize that if you’re 
going to go to Y Combinator for this interview that you’d darn well better 
have a demo.

  Clarity Matters
290
So we had this demo and this flow that we were going to show them 
through the demo. We got about two minutes into the demo, and then we 
start getting peppered with questions. And it goes off on tangents. It’s 
really just total stream of consciousness from Paul Graham and the other 
interviewers, just peppering us with questions.
So the agenda that we had sort of set up and the practice that we did 
was not—I mean, it was valuable, I think, but it had very little resemblance to 
reality.
So if you’re going to practice for that particular interview, I would 
practice—find someone who will pretend to interview you and constantly 
pepper you with questions.
Bob: You mean, like, grill you unmercifully?
Tony: Yeah. [laughs] I would say that’s pretty safe. And they ask very 
good questions. When you get the gist of a demo, it doesn’t make sense to 
get into the sort of details of what the software does, because the software’s 
going to change dramatically.
Bob: OK.
Tony: So the sort of central tenets of Y Combinator are “Build some-
thing people want,” which is seemingly obvious, but so many people build 
things that are neat that no one actually wants, that are technologically 
impressive that no one has an itch for. So “Build something that people 
want” is really the sort of core thing that they’re after. And beyond that, 
[laughs] they don’t have a lot of criteria.
Bob: And what were the top three things or one thing or five things 
that you got out of Y Combinator?
Tony: It’s a pretty long list. Toward the top, a real quick one is obvi-
ously just the credibility. This is a pretty exclusive club that Y Combinator 
has kind of built. So if you’ve made it through there, that immediately 
gets you access to reporters and investors and bloggers and things that 
you wouldn’t otherwise have easy access to. It’s a bit of a leg up, there. 
There’s obviously the huge mentorship that Paul Graham, Trevor Black-
well, and Jessica Livingston all provide. They are very generous on that 
front.
These guys, obviously . . . You think about what most mentors have. 
They have maybe one startup under their belt or maybe two. I think with 
that, oftentimes you don’t necessarily have great pattern recognition. You 
might have seen one way that things succeeded. But you’ve only really 
seen one kind of success.
Paul Graham, having mentored, literally—I think he’s into about 150 
of these companies. I think Paul Graham and all of these guys have a really 
unique perspective. They can see patterns in startups that other people 
can’t see because they don’t have the depth of the variety of startup vision 
that Paul had.

  Clarity Matters
291
Bob: Right. OK.
Tony: I think that’s really powerful. I think one of the hugest lessons 
was: Build something that a small number of people want a lot rather than 
a lot of people want a little. Find a small audience that would literally 
chew off their own leg to have what you are building.
Bob: [laughs] OK.
Tony: The idea there is that once you find a heart of people who are 
madly in love with what you are doing, then to get bigger and more suc-
cessful as a startup, all you need to do is find more people like that or 
move laterally to serve a slightly different type of audience. An example is, 
you might say, “Gosh, we serve a small audience. You’re making a small 
product.” Craigslist launched serving San Francisco. They are a little bit 
bigger than that now. Amazon launched selling books. Gosh, they are 
doing a little bit more than books now.
If you do it the other way, and you make something that everyone 
kind of thinks is neat, then what is the action item for you to get more 
successful? What do you do? You basically have to make them want it 
more. What is the formula for making them want it more? It’s a hard for-
mula to know. You don’t know what’s missing from your product to make 
them love it, because right now they only just like it.
Bob: I see where you’re going with this.
Tony: That was really kind of a neat thing to hear. We focused on our 
core users, the users who are really enjoying it and yelling at us to build 
certain things and add certain things to the product. Yeah, and Paul, the 
other thing that he really focuses on is to listen to your users. If you aren’t 
building something that you yourself are madly in love with . . . Paul built 
Viaweb, which was an e-commerce platform.
Bob: I remember it.
Tony: He wasn’t necessarily a shop owner. He was a software developer 
who saw a need. So when you aren’t building something that you yourself 
are a passionate user for, listen to your users. Be constantly engaged with 
them, and make sure you understand what they need. It’s not always what 
they say they need. That’s an art form in and of itself.
Bob: How much did that $20,000 help?
Tony: Part of the Y Combinator thing is that they do you give you 
money. You notice that I didn’t list that on the valuable assets that we got 
from Y Combinator. For us, Y Combinator attracts a bunch of different 
types of people, ranging from 20 years old to I think the oldest is 40. You 
don’t want to talk about it too much, but some of those guys are going to 
the Y Combinator meetings driving Mercedes SLKs. Especially as Y Com-
binator gets more and more credibility, you get higher- and higher-end 
people applying.

I don’t think the financial motivation is that it’s nice for someone, 
some wunderkind, applying out of college and wanting to live in an apart-
ment and eat Ramen. We live pretty cheaply, but obviously the money 
doesn’t get you far. It gets you three months’ worth of server bills, rent, 
and Ramen. [laughs] That’s how I always put it.
Bob: Were you building RescueTime while you were in the Y Combi-
nator program, or did that come later? In other words, how long before 
you launched 1.0?
Tony: That’s the other thing that Paul emphasizes. I keep saying Paul 
and that’s wrong. It should be Y Combinator.
Bob: OK. We’ll take that as the entire Y Combinator team.
Tony: He is the squeakiest wheel there. One of the other things that 
he emphasizes is to release early. Get something out the door. Because 
before you get it out the door, you are operating on theories. Just like no 
battle plan survives contact with the enemy, no product plan survives con-
tact with the users. Yeah. Basically, the idea with Y Combinator is almost 
everybody . . . He’ll push really hard and at the end of three months, you’d 
better have launched your product. Some people take a little bit longer.
Certain products are more ambitious, obviously, than others. But really, 
finding that barest iota of value that you can create and trimming your 
feature set down so that you can launch it. Start getting that user feed-
back and that market understanding that you are just guessing at now.
Bob: Were you able to launch?
Tony: Yeah, we sure were. We weren’t unique; this is happening more 
and more with Y Combinator. We had a moderately flushed-out alpha 
release even before we interviewed. We had a richer demo than a lot of 
people did. Some people apply literally with just an idea, and then have 
two weeks between their application and their interview to build some 
sort of demo.
That is the other kind of pattern recognition that Y Combinator tries 
to do: trying to understand what the recipe for a successful entrepreneur is.
I think initially they had a stronger bias toward education than they 
do. They used to think, “Oh, Ivy League is a good thing.” I think, at this 
point they think it is a nonsignificant thing. It’s not a bad thing, but it’s 
not a serious determiner of success.
One of the things that they really focus on now is people who can’t 
stop building stuff. If you can build a demo of something even moderately 
interesting in two weeks, that’s encouraging. If you’ve actually got some-
thing out in the world, that’s encouraging. That is a lot of what Y 
Combinator is a test of. Can you build something that people want in two 
weeks or three months?
Bob: OK.

  Clarity Matters
293
Tony: Just about everybody did. I think there is one team that hasn’t 
launched and a couple of teams that launched a little bit afterward.
Bob: Let me ask you a couple of more questions, and I think that will 
wrap it up.
Tony: Sure.
Bob: If you and your partners had not gone down to Silicon Valley and 
made this commitment to jump in to doing this app pretty much full 
time, do you think you would have succeeded?
Tony: I don’t think so. I still think success is not a foregone conclu-
sion. But I don’t think we would have had the shot that we do. One of the 
things—and this is another Paul Graham-ism that I constantly parrot—
the biggest motivator for most people isn’t financial. It isn’t building cool 
stuff. For a lot of people it is fear of public shame.
Bob: [laughs]
Tony: The way you hack this is . . . This is a life hack, right? People do 
this for weight loss and other things—they make a public declaration of 
intent. It means that if your startup fails, you are a failure. And if we 
hadn’t jumped in full time, it would have been a side project. There have 
been times with RescueTime where things looked tough, right? We had 
a hard time.
Bob: Right.
Tony: It wasn’t fun anymore. You push through those walls. But if it’s 
just a side project, you don’t have a ton of incentive to push through those 
walls. Because, gosh, you have this other idea that sounds like a lot of 
fun—your day job.
Bob: There is always another technology to chase.
Tony: Yeah. There is always something else fun to do. Now, if I publicly 
say, “RescueTime and Tony Wright are the exact same thing. When 
RescueTime fails, Tony Wright fails. This is now my livelihood.” It is no 
longer the side project that didn’t work out. It’s the livelihood or core 
thing that is failing in Tony’s life. That is a huge motivator, I think. Could 
we have done that without Y Combinator? Certainly. I think the cash didn’t 
hurt. One of the things that I probably didn’t list on the Y Combinator 
advantages that I could is that, after Y Combinator, about six months 
after Y Combinator ended, we raised a small Series A—very small and 
small on purpose. But nonetheless, it gave us the ability to have actual 
paychecks for the foreseeable future.
Bob: According to CrunchBase, your Series A was $900,000.
Tony: Yeah.
Bob: Let me ask it this way. Did Y Combinator up open doors you 
wouldn’t have known about otherwise?
Tony: Absolutely.

  Clarity Matters
294
Bob: For that’s Series A.
Tony: Yeah, for the fundraising stuff, absolutely. Fundraising is hard. 
If anyone says, “Tell me the bullet points about fundraising that I should 
care about.” For early-stage fundraising, the only bullet point you should 
care about is that there are two things that can allow you to raise early-
stage funding. One is traction: people who are either paying for or using—
whether you are a consumer or a business—either paying for or actively 
using your application and a growth curve that keeps growing. Or a rock 
star team, basically. You have Bill Gates coming out of retirement to help 
you with your product, or what have you.
Bob: How did you get Tim Ferriss, who I assume is the same Tim Ferriss 
we all know and love from “The 4-Hour Workweek”?
Tony: Yeah, that is. [laughs] Tim was interesting. He was introduced 
through another angel. This is really awesome. It’s a great story. Tim actu-
ally was evangelizing RescueTime before we ever said a word to him. We 
saw in a US News and World Report interview with him that he was recom-
mending Rescue Time. I was, like, “Oh my God, Ferriss is recommending us. 
How awesome is that?” I tried to e-mail him a thank you and never got 
anything back. The guy obviously gets as much e-mail as anybody.
Bob: Yeah.
Tony: When we were actually fundraising, one of the guys who did 
express interest in being an angel said, “Do you know who you should talk 
to is Tim Ferriss, and let me make an introduction.” That is another les-
son in fundraising: introductions win big. If you have an introduction from 
someone they trust, that is 90% of the battle.
On Y Combinator demo day, which is the big coming-out party at the 
end of Y Combinator, where you present to 100 to 150 investors. From 
that we maybe landed, ultimately, one or two investors. Every one of the 
other investors that we landed was an introduction chain from those ini-
tial investors.
So (a) introductions win and (b) you have to ask for them. If you have 
someone onboard who is willing to fund you, you say, “Can you give me 
five names of people who you think might be a good fit as an investor, and 
can you make that introduction? That is your first job as an investor.” 
[laughs]
Bob: I think the key thing, to roll this all the way back, is you wouldn’t 
have gotten those introductions—you probably wouldn’t have gotten into 
Y Combinator—if you hadn’t started with something that was remarkable 
and made people double take, based on what you could show them there.
Tony: Right. Absolutely. I think that making something remarkable 
and not underestimating the challenges of an early-stage startup are crit-
ical. If you are going to be funded, I think Y Combinator, TechStars, or 
anything of that sort is so incredibly valuable.

Recap
In this chapter we’ve discussed just how you go about marketing your 
startup’s product with clarity and results. I’ve suggested that the right 
way forward is to understand and craft what I call a Unique Selling Propo-
sition, and to make sure your web site delivers the components of that 
offer in the right way, in the right order.
We’ve talked to two startups who have made the leap from “I want” to 
“I am,” and seen the outlines of how they got there while we’ve examined 
their web sites and how they communicate their USPs.
In the next chapter, we’ll talk to a different kind of startup and argu-
ably one of the foremost leaders in personal productivity, David Allen. 
And, standing on the shoulders of giants, I’ll offer some suggestions on 
how you can and how you must improve your online, developer, and startup 
founder productivity.

Getting It Done
“If you spend too much time thinking about a thing, you’ll never get it done.”
—Bruce Lee (Martial artist/actor.)
“Nothing worthwhile comes easily. Half effort does not produce 
half results, it produces no results. Work, continuous work and 
hard work, is the only way to accomplish results that last.”
—Hamilton Holt (American educator and author)
This Might Hurt
So far in this book, you’ve gotten off easy. Sure, you’ve learned a lot, had 
plenty to ponder, hopefully been somewhat entertained. None of that is 
going to make your startup a reality.
The sharp, hard truth is that building an app worth other people’s 
money and wrapping a successful business venture around it means you 
are going to be working harder, more productively, and longer than you 
ever thought possible. And, yes, I know, you already work longer hours 
than any of your non-IT friends. I’m sorry to be the bearer of bad news, 
but that’s the reality.
Nor will it be enough just to work real hard. Unless you’re already the 
most productive person you know, you’re not where you need to be to 
succeed. Productive here means, not how much information you consume, 
but the quality and quantity of what you produce.

For starters, we’re going to cover some basic rules of productivity 
that, though widespread in the IT and business world, you might never 
have dug into. (If you’re already familiar with David Allen and use his Getting 
Things Done (GTD) system for managing your workload, you can save 
some time by skipping ahead to the interview with David.)
Next, we’re going to dig into this issue of productivity three times: 
first in terms of your online productivity, then in terms of you as a produc-
tive developer, and finally in terms of you as a productive startup founder. 
As we do so, I’m going to ask you to take stock of where you are, suggest 
some specific behaviors to adopt or change, check out a few select tools that 
I’ll argue can make a huge difference in the quality and quantity of what 
you get done, and talk to a few people who have some real insights to 
share.
I think you’ll find this an interesting and useful chapter. But I should 
point out something we both know: unless you actually follow the sugges-
tions and perform the recommended actions that make sense to you, 
you’re not going to get the results.
GTD in Summary
Here’s the background on David Allen and GTD. Over the past decade, 
productivity expert David Allen has become something of the living patron 
saint of the IT world. His methodology—expressed first in Getting Things 
Done—The Art of Stress-Free Productivity (Penguin Books, 2001), then in 
Ready for Anything: 52 Productivity Principles for Work and Life (Penguin 
Books, 2004), and most recently in Making It All Work: Winning at the 
Game of Work and Business of Life (Viking Adult, 2008)—has taken hold 
in the business world, especially in the tech sector.
Although the details, nuances, and practical application of GTD fill 
not just David Allen’s three books but dozens of other books1 and hundreds 
of thoughtful blogs (see http://gtd.alltop.com) and spawned more than 
300 GTD-centric applications, the core of GTD can be expressed in a single 
sentence:
You need to establish and maintain a comprehensive process for 
collecting, processing, organizing, reviewing, and doing all of the tasks 
and commitments in your life if you want to achieve results.
1 If you’re looking for the least amount of documentation to read before you start getting some results, 
I strongly recommend Leo Babauta’s Zen to Done [http://www.47hats.com/?page_id=521] 
e-book ($9.50 USD). Leo has taken GTD and integrated it into the goal-setting and prioritization 
methods that made Steven Covey’s The Seven Habits of Highly Effective People so popular. Think of it 
as a lightweight implementation of the more powerful GTD framework.

  Getting It Done
299
Expanding this sentence touches on everything from striving to have no 
e-mails in your inbox to picking which software systems you’ll put in place to 
manage your startup. We shall cover the core first.
GTD’s Five Core Principles
■Collecting. For GTD to work—for your life to work—you need a 
comprehensive set of physical, digital, and online buckets for all the 
things on which you have to act. These buckets are anything but 
your memory and your mind, where—like a software process run 
amok—they would suck up focus and energy.
■Processing. At least weekly—and in some cases, such as e-mail, much 
more often—you should empty these collection points by systemati-
cally processing their contents. If an item requires action, you either 
do it (if it’s something that can be completed in two minutes), dele-
gate it to someone else, defer it to a specific date and time, add it 
to a new or ongoing project, or file it under Someday/Maybe. If an 
item requires no action, then file it as reference information, delete 
it, or let it stew for possible action later.
■Organizing. Mistaking projects for tasks can make the difference 
between creating a flow of actionable and achievable units of work 
and producing a morass of indigestible and stressful mini-crises ripe 
for procrastination. Some tasks are simple, atomic, binary; anything 
that takes more than one physical action is not a task but a project. 
Every project has at any given time one next action—a physical task 
that should be completed next to move the project toward comple-
tion. At any given time, you might have hundreds of multiple-step 
projects in progress and dozens of items that are waiting for someone 
else to do something. Although every project needs regular oversight 
and perhaps a plan, tracking those “waiting for” items is especially 
useful. So, too, is building your task-organizing system such that 
you can pull out similar tasks from different projects that make 
sense to do in a given context, such as running errands and meeting 
with your cofounders or working in your e-mail program.

  Getting It Done
300
■Reviewing. For GTD to work for you, you need a systematic approach 
to reviewing all tasks and projects at appropriate intervals. The 
reviewing process keeps you and your multitude of projects and 
tasks on course. Actual reviews can be as fleeting as deciding what 
your next action is to a more structured weekly review that ensures 
not only that things are getting done, but that the right things are 
getting the attention needed to advance objectives, goals, and values, 
this week, this month, and this year.
■Doing. Collecting, processing, organizing, and reviewing the things 
you need to do is not a substitute for actually doing them. But 
performing these processes consistently will give you the best chance 
to do what needs doing, with clarity, focus, and perhaps even fun.

David Allen, Author, Speaker
David Allen has been one of my personal heroes since I came across his 2001 
book Getting Things Done—The Art of Stress-Free Productivity. For a long time 
I’ve felt that any startup that hopes to succeed needs to adopt GTD as a way 
of managing the very large load of tasks, open commitments, and responsi-
bilities that go with creating a company.
In this interview, I was fortunate enough to be able focus with David on just 
what startups can and should expect from GTD. I got a lot out of it; I think 
you will too.
Bob: Maybe the place to start is in your new book, where you look at GTD 
from the points of view of control and perspective. What does that really 
mean?
David: Well, they're the two aspects of managing yourself and managing a 
company. If you're starting tabula rasa, you start with perspective. "Hey, I've 
got a vision. I woke up; I've got a fire in my belly. I've got to go do this thing."
Now you've got a vision, but now you just threw yourself into being a potential 
victim of modality because now you're the victim of your own creativity. 
Like what have I done, right?
Bob: The 10,000 things you need to do to get it done.
David: Yes, but the "it" is the starting point. It's just that if you already have 
an entity or it's already got legs of any sort and it's moving, oftentimes people 
need to get it under control. In other words, if your ship is sinking, you don't 
care where it's pointed. But once you plug it up, you'd better point it in the 
right direction or you'll keep hitting stuff that you don't want to hit.
So they're both key aspects of managing anything. It's kind of the simplicity 
on the other side of complexity—those two things. People say, "Look, we 
need to get organized and get focused." That's what you're going to tell 
anybody who's in: "Hey, let's get organized. Let's get focused. Let's try to 
start a company or have a party."
Any and all of that will require those two elements. So what I did in making 
it all work was just define How simple can you get? What does get organized 
mean? What does get focused mean? Actually, as you know, organization is 
only a component of getting control. So control is actually a better word. So 
if I'm trying to get control of it, those are five very distinct kinds of practices, 
behaviors, that require different tools, etc. I couldn't get it any simpler than 
those five.
The six horizons are basically the different conversations that you need to 
have in order to feel comfortable that this thing is in alignment, on track, 
headed in the right direction, and that you make choices about how you allo-
cate your resources.

  Getting It Done
303
Bob: You and your company have worked with literally tens of thousands 
of people, applying GTD. Do entrepreneurs and/or high-tech people have an 
easier or harder time getting GTD right?
David: Yes.
Bob: [laughs] Let's unpack that a little further. I mean, what are the charac-
teristics there?
David: One of my favorite sayings is "The better you get, the better you 
better get." So it's all relative to what you're doing. If you're not playing a big 
enough game, it's easy to stay in control and it's easy to stay focused. If you're 
playing a big enough game, you're going to throw yourself out of control and 
be losing your focus regularly. If you're not, you're stale.
So obviously, people in an entrepreneurial modality are going to be losing 
control probably faster, quicker, and in grander ways than almost anybody 
else, simply because of their nature. They've thrown themselves out into the 
world that doesn't exist. They've got to make things happen. They've got to 
make it up. Mission-critical stuff is showing up by surprise almost with every 
e-mail download.
That's no different than anybody in terms of what they're dealing with. So it's 
almost like the better you get, the more you're willing to take those kinds of 
risks, then the more you throw focus and control, or perspective and control, 
potentially at risk. In other words, it's not an either-or. It's not like, well, 
OK. Those people are better or worse at this. Other people need this more 
than anybody else. It just means that it's in a more intense situation where 
the necessity to do this is—the cycle for applying it—is perhaps a lot quicker 
and perhaps more important.
Bob: Sounds like they need to be—whatever way you'd like to say this—a 
hell of a lot better than people who are dealing with a lower threshold of 
change, of creation, of making things happen. I guess one question that comes to 
mind is, does GTD scale? That's a question that we always ask in the software 
world. Does this or that scale? Take the example of when you built GTD 
Connect [https://secure.davidco.com/connect], where you were basi-
cally a startup. How did that work out?
David: Well, it worked out very well. It was a component of a bigger thing 
that we needed to do, which was to provide ongoing support. I've been pretty 
much market-driven from the very beginning. It wasn't like I went out to 
make something up and then said, "OK, let me go see if anybody wants this.
" It was mostly just paying attention to what seemed to be needed, and if I 
had value to add to that: How could I do that? How do I create or maintain 
some business model so that I don't go broke in the process?
On a very big scale, 50,000 feet, our whole vision is, let's get GTD out there 
to the end of the world, to as many people as want or can use it. So how do 
you do that? How do you decide who it goes to, and how do you put a cash 
register on this process, our intellectual property?

  Getting It Done
304
Essentially, it's just common sense. But it's how it's packaged, how the method-
ology has been defined, and how we can help people deliver and implement that 
that is the value of our company. So this is just another modality. I said, "OK, 
I think we need something like that," so that's where that came from. I don't 
know if that answered your question.
Bob: I think it did. You've been (for lack of a better term) a startup founder. 
Yes, you had DavidCo before that, and it was a thriving business before that, 
but you've been into the hurly-burly of making a software thing happen now, 
an online software thing, at that. In that process, did anything stand out that 
kind of surprised you as far as different ways that you need to apply GTD as 
a startup founder, rather than, let's say, somebody who works at a corpora-
tion?
David: No, it's all the same thing. GTD is really nothing more than asking 
what the best questions are that you need to be asking yourself about anything, 
from a business standpoint. What are we trying to accomplish? How do you 
allocate resources to make it happen?
In a way, that's not rocket science, unless you're a jet propulsion lab, but it's 
essentially those questions we had to ask ourselves. So we are constantly 
having to eat our own dog food. Let's sit down and go, "Wait a minute! 
What's the purpose of that?" We're rethinking it right now, because as we 
move forward, we constantly need to keep ourselves honest and real and 
say, "Wait a minute! Is it fulfilling the purpose that was started? Is that still 
the viable purpose? What other purposes could this fulfill?"
Many times, there is a lot of ready, fire, aim: "Hey, let's put it out there. Let's 
get some feedback. Let's see what happens and iterate this thing." We've got 
our own version of sort of radical programming, which is "Yeah, let's build 
something, put it out there, and then reiterate the model."
So we're constantly doing that. We're constantly rethinking, reworking: Is 
this supposed to be? Is it what it needs to be? Is it what it's supposed to be? 
I think that's the only way you're going to keep anything vital and alive, especially 
in the world of the Internet and the Web and so forth, which is a constantly 
moving, changing event.
So you’d better be clear about what your purpose is. That's why I think GTD 
has been so sustainable, because it's very clear what its purpose is, and it's 
not about any particular system because systems always get out of date. 
Somebody is always going to come up with a sleeker, slicker, sexier way to 
keep a list. [laughs]
Bob: OK.
David: Ultimately, that's still what it's going to be, the very simple idea that 
people just need tools to help them focus. That's no different than it's been 
since dirt. So there's nothing new about the principles that we're trying to 
apply. How you engage with that, with the technology, in a way that makes 
it work best, that's another story.

  Getting It Done
305
Bob: Speaking of lists and tools, one thing that I picked up from Making It All 
Work was that it may not be possible or desirable to have just one GTD 
system, that is, one place where all tasks and projects go to live. Did I get 
that right?
David: Well, you just need reminders where you need reminders. I mean, 
if you pay your bills every Friday afternoon, you don't need to schlep your 
bills around for six and a half days. Just keep them where you pay your bills, 
and Friday afternoon sit down and pay them. So there's a big “duh” factor 
there. No need to carry them, unless you need to carry them. If you need 
to have ubiquity in terms of "At any point and time, I might need to be reminded 
about this," then you need to have that in a tool that you have at any point 
and time.
Bob: OK.
David: If that's true, you just need to make sure your system matches its 
purpose. See, most people never figured out what the purpose of this is; 
that's why productivity porn exists out there—everybody wants what's the 
latest, newest new thing. Is there a better way to get this done? If they 
figured out what the purpose of this was, they could fulfill the purpose with 
whatever they've got.
Bob: Are all those blogs that I guess are purveyors of productivity porn (try 
saying that three times fast), are they missing the point?
David: They might be, I don't know. It depends on what their point is. If all 
they're doing is saying, "Look, I've got my own spin about how to do this, and 
here's a cool way to do it. So I'm going to find all the people that happen to 
like it and do it my way, and I'll make some money off that." God bless them. 
I mean, that's cool. Why not? I mean, how many different kinds of gum can 
you chew? Lots of them. But that's more stylistic, it's not necessarily func-
tional.
Bob: So it doesn't really matter whether they use (to put it in programmer 
terms) a defect-tracking ticketing system for those sort of tasks versus an 
agile scrum system for those other types of tasks. The goal here is not beauty 
and elegance. It's more along the lines of function and functionality.
David: Absolutely. There's an article in the new Wired U.K. magazine, by the 
way, that I highly recommend. I am now writing a column for them, and they 
have some very cool stuff. A new article on the new Paper-Net, for the web-
based paper stuff. In other words, your printer—your aunt is going to send 
you a little thank you note through your printer. So it has nothing to do with 
what the tool is itself; it has to do with the functionality of it.
The truth of it is, a lot of people still like the touch and feel of paper. As a 
matter of fact, it's easier for the brain to integrate multiple horizons of infor-
mation on paper than it is any other way. I love these companies that say, 
"We're going paperless." I go, "Grow up!"
Bob: It's not going to happen, huh?

  Getting It Done
306
David: It might, but only if the function the paper is serving can be better served 
some other way. But then, you have to come back to, what's the function?
Bob: So this is all about function here, not ceremony?
David: Right, function with a "K."
Bob: OK, function with a "K"?
David: Yeah. It's going to be funky and cool, isn't it? You know what I mean?
Bob: Oh, OK.
David: That's all it's about, really, come on! I'm into cool gear as much as 
anybody else. Anything small, black, high-tech, and expensive I just want. 
Later on I'll figure out if it does anything. Unfortunately, I just don't have the 
bandwidth to go test them out, because you truly have to try out all these 
things before you can find out how usable they really are.
Bob: Well, I'm not looking for a product endorsement for Apple, but what 
do you think of the Apple iPhone and all those GTD apps that are now available 
for it?
David: Well, the reason is that Apple basically has productivity as its third 
priority, entertainment first and communication second, and third is produc-
tivity. So productivity sucks on the Apple, because they haven't integrated 
the productivity functions as have Outlook and Lotus Notes.
That's why everybody is doing all of those apps, because Apple didn't give 
you a way to tie iCal to e-mail, to tasks lists; so everybody had to build it in. 
It will be cool when they get it, because they'll probably get it and add an 
elegant and stylistic factor that's really cool. Obviously, the visibility of the 
iPhone was probably a game changer, because that meant you could handle 
a lot more data well without going nuts trying to read it or trying to function 
with it is available through more portable devices. I'd say that's the real 
breakthrough, not the function.
Bob: I read recently that there's something over 300 desktop, web, mobile, 
and software applications that tout their "GTDness." How do you feel about 
that, being the spiritual founder of all that?
David: Yeah, it's cool! It's kind of amusing. It depends on what side of the 
bed I get up, in terms of whether I get up with my small ego or my big ego. 
If I get up with my big ego, I go, "Look, only a million and a half people have 
bought GTD and probably a lot of them haven't read it yet. We've got about 
5.9 billion to go, wake up!" One part of it says, "Who doesn't need this? 
Anybody who's got to keep track of more than one thing at a time needs this 
methodology."
On the other side, I'm sort of amused that anybody catches this, because it's 
so subtle and on the surface looks like every other time management, personal 
organization thing that doesn't work out there. So it's kind of, which day are 
you asking me how I feel about it?

Bob: Well, there are things that are new out there. Since we last talked, there 
is something I would describe as a new kind of “human activity,” online social 
media, such as Twitter, and, more importantly, the much, much larger 
networks, such as Facebook. How do you apply GTD to Twitter?
David: The way you apply GTD to a cocktail party or to your laundromat’s 
bulletin board.
Bob: Well, how would you apply it to a cocktail party? I mean, you sit there 
and make a list, take everybody's input, and put that into your process bag?
David: Yeah, you carry a little David Allan NoteTaker Wallet with you, and 
in the cocktail party if somebody says, "By the way, you should read this book," 
write it down. I mean, what is social media but a global cocktail party, just 
through a different medium? What's the difference between that and a bulletin 
board in the laundromat? Same thing, just different medium. There's no qual-
itatively different thing about what that is.
Bob: I guess I'm hearing two things here. One is that you see online social 
media as something that people have been doing for, you know, 10,000 years, 
but in a new form now. Still, it's the same thing—social interaction. The other 
part of that is that the social interaction is one thing, but the things that become 
actionable out of that social interaction are another, and they should go in 
the hopper with everything else—digital, analog, online, offline.
David: Sure. But what the social media has done—to be a little more practical 
and au courant to what you're really asking—what social media has done is 
the same thing the Web and everything else has done: They've made input 
easy, sexy, cool, fun, a whole lot of potentially meaningful things.
Come on, how many links on Twitter can you see that could be cool, that 
could be worth reading, that could be "Oh my God!"
Bob: [laughs]
David: What that does is force you to read the back part of Making It All 
Work, which is, OK, what horizon am I really focused on right now? What's the 
purpose of my hanging out and allowing myself essentially to graze intuitively?
You can go to the cocktail party to avoid your life, or you can go there to 
find an investor in your new startup. Those are two very different purposes 
for going to the same event. Exactly the same thing with Twitter. Why are 
you doing it?
Bob: This is where we come back to control and perspective, I guess.
David: Sure.
Bob: Basically, if you're involved in an online activity such as Twitter and 
you're not clear about what it is you're doing there, well, you may get some 
good results, but they're going to be more by pure dumb luck than anything 
else.
David: Yes. There's a lot of ready, fire, aim-ness. I think you should just go 
out and do what you feel like doing, and then learn from your experiences. 
Don't make the same mistakes twice. So, yes, throw yourself into it.

I did. I wasn't sure how this was all going to work. My nephew, Scott Allen, 
was a big proponent to begin with. He turned me on to it. I interviewed 
Scott in my GTD Connect forum. Scott was doing a lot of early writing 
about the social media. What's the business application of social media?
I was not even clear myself. So I got onto LinkedIn, because I figured it was 
the most professional of all of those. Still, the jury's out for me about 
whether it is still worth it. Not a whole lot has necessarily come across there.
But I hopped onto Twitter about, I guess, two or three months ago. I had a 
sense intuitively that there was something there. I couldn't put my finger on 
it. But I'm staring now at 398,826 followers I've got. It turned out to be that 
this kind of little haiku format where I could do my little David Allen-isms 
and allow people to stay somewhat intimately involved with my thought 
process. That helps GTD stick a lot when you get around it.
So there's a service factor there just in giving people access to me and a 
sense of familiarity and informality that I think is important to wrap around 
GTD, so people don't get too wrapped up. I can hold that standard out 
there. It makes it a lot easier for people to engage and get access to it.
It's always a great thing to do while I'm standing in an airport security line. I 
just sit down, and pop something out, and just glance at all that. It is truly a 
global cocktail party. I happen to like to hang out. But sometimes I like to 
stand in the corner and just watch. Sometimes I get engaged in conversa-
tions. I think that's the best analogy I can give for it.
Bob: Now, it may be productivity porn, but one of the things that always 
seems to come up in the second or third paragraph when people are talking 
about GTD is information overload, especially online information overload, 
especially online information overload when you're browsing the Web.
I wonder, is there a way, be it a general idea or a specific tool, that you've 
come across for applying GTD to web browsing, to this wonderful idea of 
bookmarks and favorites? At least everyone I know, including me, ends up 
with thousands of these indigestible to-dos that are called Bookmarks.
David: Well, if they're reference, they're not to-dos. If they're to-dos and 
you can grab the to-do, that's a problem. It's kind of like people filing an 
e-mail that they need to respond to over in their reference e-mail. It's like, 
"Whoa! Wrong." You've now mixed up meanings.
Bob: Comingling of purposes there, huh?
David: That's exactly it. That's what disorganization is, where things don’t 
match what they mean to you. So if you have two different things that mean 
two different things in the same place, that's, by definition, disorganized, and 
the brain gets confused. It has to re-sort it every time it looks at it.

  Getting It Done
309
That's why you don't want to open your Favorites list, because you've still 
got actions, you've told yourself subliminally, that are embedded in there and 
that you haven't pulled them off where you want to see reminders of actions 
to do.
But once you've filtered it like I have—look, I have two years of e-mail on 
my laptop here because I can. Why not? It's a library. I'm a serious pack rat. 
I keep all kinds of things. It's a good idea to purge that every once in a while, 
just so that it's not too big a black hole. If you have trouble finding things or 
if you've got a bunch of irrelevant things, then every once in a while it's kind 
of nice to clean the trunk of your car, your tackle box, and stuff like that.
Bob: I’ve noticed that one thing a lot of people get very excited about when 
they get into GTD is when it gets applied to e-mail. They are just liberated 
and energized by the idea of an actual day when they have achieved an empty 
inbox.
Now, we've got all these other types of digital communication, RSS, all the 
online social stuff. Is there any guiding principle there, other than you'd really 
need to be clear whether the place you're looking at is a point of collection 
or a point where it's going to be reference or a list of actual things that fit 
into the projects of your life?
David: Yes, well, that's back to the point that what most people don't do 
with e-mail is, they think a medium is one thing. No, it's a medium through 
which you then have reference material, and you have actionable stuff, and 
you have trash, and you have all kinds of things. You just have to put it through 
the same drill.
To me, it's just bizarre that people . . . I have never heard anybody say, "I get 
too many messages on my answering machine. I get too many voicemails." 
Well, some people say voicemails, but frankly, nobody complains about those. 
What's the difference? There's no difference. Each one of them, you get stuff 
that's just reference stuff, that's just trash, and stuff you need to act on.
What people don't do is leave it there, undecided. But they do about e-mail. 
They also do it by paper. That's why most people are highly voice-addicted, 
and most cultures are voice-addicted. That's why interruptitis is so huge out 
there, because if you have something you consider timely and meaningful 
that somebody needs to know and hear, you've got to deliver it to them by 
some sort of auditory means, because that's the only thing they're 
processing.
Well, I just go, "Duh! Somebody give me the rationale for this." And there is 
none. E-mail wouldn't be a problem if it blew up like your answering machine 
did once you got more than a screen full.

  Getting It Done
310
Bob: [laughs]
David: People go, "Oh, I guess I better empty this," thus allowing them the 
luxury of nondecision. That is not e-mail's fault. That is theirs.
Bob: OK. So it is a case of “Doctor, heal thyself.”
David: Sure, and I understand it is a beast because there is a lot of stuff and 
you better be fast and you better be typing 60 words a minute. You better 
stop using your mouse. You better use speed keys.
I mean there is a little bit of a grow-up factor here. This is going to be a 
significant factor and the keyboard is still going to be the most important 
tool you'll have the rest of your life. So if anybody doesn't get that, then 
wake up.
Bob: A couple more questions. One thing that popped out of Making It All 
Work is that you sort of trashed that there is an idea of a life–work balance. 
You called it a hoax. Isn't that basically like saying Santa Claus doesn't exist?
David: Well, no. I didn't say balance didn't exist. Balance is actually what 
you're after. But you should make life and work two different things. The 
truth is that most people go somewhat dead when they go to work. So I 
suppose it is more of a descriptive term than a prescriptive term. You know?
Yeah, I guess a lot of people just don't consider those the same thing. But 
once you are in your zone, once you really get this, when time disappears, 
you are not making any qualitative distinction internally between “Is this work?” 
or “Is this play?” or “What is this?” You don't care. [laughs]
That is only an issue when there is no balance and then you say, "Well, I 
need to get balance." For some people, balance is 98% of what you'd call 
work. You know they're 24. It is all an adrenaline rush. They get bored when 
they go home because there is nobody there but the cat and they don't even 
like the cat. So they would just as soon stay at work the whole time because 
it is more fun. So when I say it is a hoax, I was just making a point, obviously, 
that the fact that you even set up that dichotomy is very, very unusual in the 
history of the world.
As I say, farmers have never split that. Just What's next? What's next? What's 
next? It's all work. That is why the kind of play on words I've in the title 
Making It All Work. It is all work.
Bob: [laughs]
David: Make your life the work you have to do on the planet, and then . . . 
Look, some of it you get paid for and some of it you don't. Some it you are 
just moving through.
Bob: Any final advice for people who are creating startups on how GTD can 
help them succeed?

  Getting It Done
311
David: I've talked to VCs who have been involved with a lot of startups. 
There are two or three things that will cause a startup to crash. One is if you 
haven't protected your intellectual property.
Bob: OK.
David: So make sure that is handled. The other is lack of funding and resources, 
you know, enough to get it off the ground. And the third is execution. Most 
of the VCs that I've talked to will tell you that number three is the biggest 
issue. They don't get the thing done. They've got the plan. They've got the 
money. They've got the IP protection. But they just don't get the stuff off the 
ground the way they need to.
GTD is the execution methodology. It is how you get stuff done. Define 
what done means and what doing looks like and where it happens, and that is 
a constant, ongoing set of best practices. Most people don't sit down and do 
that kind of thinking until the heat of the situation forces them to.
This is opposed to, I need to train myself to be thinking outcome–action, 
outcome–action, outcome–action on a consistent basis. And constantly, as I 
get new meaningful input, constantly recalibrating all of the mix I've got about all 
my commitments. And then refocusing and point and shoot again.
So that's where, as I say, on the part of the entrepreneur, it isn't a nice-to-
have, it is a must-have as a success factor to make sure these things get done.
Bob: OK. David, thank you very much. I think that when people read this 
interview, it is going to open some eyes, especially among all the startups, 
who basically live in a whirlwind of things to do and who wonder just how 
to execute that whirlwind.
David: Yep. Well, my parting words are just these: Read Making It All Work, 
especially the chapter where I focus on paying attention to what has your 
attention. Because if you don't give appropriate attention to what has your 
attention, it will start to take more of your attention then it deserves.
So as my last tweet says, "When you know what you are doing, efficiency 
and style are your only opportunities."
Bob: There you go. Thanks so much.
David: Most people don't know what they are doing, so [laughs] that's their 
problem.
Bob: There are times when I fit into that category too. But I think that, for 
entrepreneurs, for founders who sometimes feel that they are running on a 
tightrope across the Grand Canyon, the end that they've started at is already 
on fire.
David: Yeah, I know the feeling. I'm a 30-year overnight success. I'm still in it.

  Getting It Done
312
Bob: And I think that one of the things that keeps coming back to me is that 
this isn't something that you do once. You keep coming back to it and you 
keep finding more and more levels of understanding in application to your 
own life. And whether you are building a startup or you are still working in 
a nice structured somebody else's corporation environment, the principles 
apply. And you need to practice the skills that make it possible to apply those 
principles, even if you are under duress and stress of, let's say, massive change 
in your life.
David: Another way to say that, Bob, is that when you are under massive 
stress, it is too late. You are going to be in survival mode, so you just have 
to hope that what you've built in as your default best practices and systemic 
responses are the best. So the trick is, when you are not in crisis mode, what 
part of your process do you need to be working on so that when the next 
surprise hits you'll deal with it with more efficiency and elegance.
Bob: Well, maybe that raises one last question, which is, how do you get 
out of crisis mode? Let's say you've got your startup, you've got your vision, 
but it is not getting executed. How do you get out of this?
David: Back to pay attention to what has your attention, what most would 
relieve the biggest amount of pressure if you made progress on it. And get a 
next action on it and go.
Bob: And that's it.
David: That's it.
GTD Recommended Software
As contrarian as it may sound, the best way of tracking your GTD data 
might be with a paper notepad, index cards, or any kind of notebook you 
fancy. As the sayings go, the devil is in the details, your mileage will differ, 
and no two computers have exactly the same configuration.
There are hundreds of software applications (including one I wrote3) on 
every platform, from the Apple iPhone to Lotus Notes. And, unfortunately, to 
my knowledge no one tool is powerful, flexible, and comprehensive enough 
to work for all people in all circumstances. But whether it’s a Moleskine 
notebook, a hybrid desktop/mobile app, or something else, the more 
effectively it works for you to implement these five principles, the better.
That said, I would like to commend two GTD-friendly apps to your 
attention if you want to get on the GTD train via software: Remember the Milk 
(RTM) and Things. Remember the Milk (http://www.rememberthemilk.com; 
see Figure 8-2) is a simple and elegant online task manager with over 
750,000 users of their free and Pro ($25/year) plans, mobile clients for 
3  MasterList Professional for Windows, now sold by masterlistpro.com at http://masterlistpro.com.

the Apple iPhone and BlackBerry. RTM’s simplicity, its integration with 
Google Maps and Twitter, and its robust functionality make it a good choice.
Figure 8-2. Remember the Milk.
If you use a Mac for your desktop and an iPhone as your mobile 
platform—as I do nowadays—let me recommend Things, from Cultured 
Code (http://culturedcode.com/things) Although there are other very 
good GTD apps for the Mac—notably OmniFocus (http://www.omnigroup.
com/applications/omnifocus) and Midnight Inbox (http://www.
midnightbeep.com), I’ve found Things to be an extremely lightweight 
application, with a fast and reliable iPhone client. Figure 8-3 presents a 
screenshot of my copy of Things, to give you a taste of the application.

After many years and many applications, I’ve come around to the 
position that, at least for me, the best GTD software is the software that 
adds the absolute least amount of overhead to managing a task load, a 
conclusion that may or may not work for you.
For Windows, a large number4 of choices are available, including 
David Allen’s own Getting Things Done Outlook Add-in (https://secure.
davidco.com/store/other.php). Patrick Foley, my cohost at the Startup 
Success Podcast, swears by AbstractSpoon Software’s ToDoList (http://
www.abstractspoon.com).
Having been keenly interested in GTD for many years, I consider the 
major trend to be pairing either a desktop or web-based main application 
with a lightweight app for your mobile device of choice. But, again, it’s all 
about what works for you.

Matt Cornell, Productivity Expert
Matt Cornell (http://matthewcornell.org) is a Massachusetts-based 
consultant who regularly trains teams at NASA and elsewhere on the finer 
points of personal and small-team productivity. If his advice can make rocket 
scientists more productive, it should be just what you need for your startup.
Matt has three big pieces of advice for software developers who are now 
going from established work environments to a situation where they’re building 
not only a specific product but the set of business practices, informal rules, 
and values that define a particular corporate culture.
1. Use micro-experiments to amass actionable, non-emotion-
ally charged information about your own productivity first. 
Most of those who work online have no idea of how fractured our atten-
tion spans have become. “Bad habits are what we’re talking about,” Matt 
said. “Just keep a little timer, an online timer or whatever. And when 
you start a project, like you’re starting coding some module or fixing a 
bug, just start your timer, and then catch yourself, the next time you 
think about switching to e-mail or you actually do switch over and check 
your inbox, right? And look at that number. And I bet you’ll be very 
surprised at how few minutes transpire before you switch.”
2. Build a set of agreements with your fellow founders on how 
and when you’re going to communicate. “You need to start having 
some, I won’t say policies, but some understandings about interruptibility,” 
Matt suggests. “It’s very tempting—and you see this all the time—to 
just shout over the cubicle or do an instant message and say, ‘Hey, got 
a second for this?’ And everybody says yes.
“But for the company, that’s not the best answer, unless it’s urgent. A 
better answer is: ‘I’ll be taking a break at noon. Let’s talk then. Can it 
wait?’ An even better answer is not even having to answer. In other 
words, people know: save up your questions. Use a GTD agenda, for 
example, and save it up till you have a regular meeting.
“I think one of the things we’re talking about here in terms of moving 
from personal productivity to group productivity is that the group has 
to set some boundaries as far as interruptibility. And it’s actually a pretty 
explicit agreement that, ‘OK, from this period to this period a day, at 
noon or whatever, these are the times I can answer those questions, I 
can deal with those interruptions. That’s all I’m doing is that stuff.’”

  Getting It Done
316
3. DRY (don’t repeat yourself) applies to business, not just writing 
software. This is a two-for-one point: certain kinds of information 
work best when housed in an application that is designed for effectively 
processing that information. A prime example is bug defects. “One of 
the most common GTD frequently asked questions is, ‘How do I integrate 
with my sales system, my bug-tracking system, my ticketing system, and 
customer support?’ This comes up all the time.”
4. Instead of moving information from your bug-tracking system, to e-mail, 
to your own GTD system, time-block your work. “Say, ‘OK, in the 
morning I’m going to work strictly from a ticketing system. That’s my 
to-do list. And in the afternoon I’m going to work from the rest of my 
list.’ Because it doesn’t make sense to pull out tickets into a GTD-like 
system. You want to work within the ticketing system or the bug-tracking 
system. Let them be separate islands of tasks or actions or activity is 
my thinking. And then integrate them into your workday as needed, 
whether it’s doing it by blocking by time, or we can brainstorm other 
ways to do that. But, yeah, let them be separate islands of tasks or 
whatever, and then bounce around as you need.”
The second point Matt makes about keeping information DRY in a small 
team is establishing conventions about communicating information that save 
everyone time. “You want to limit how much interaction you have of the 
mundane sort so that you can prioritize the kind of human interaction that 
makes a group function well,” Matt said. “There are certain kinds of things, 
like sharing documents and such, that you don’t want to have to be sending 
an e-mail necessarily, because you need to get together when you’re making 
decisions.”
Online Productivity
Now that we’ve covered basic task management, it’s time to focus on what I 
like to call online productivity. Online productivity is all about focus, taking 
conscious control of how you work and communicate online. Let’s start 
with five simple questions about your current state of online productivity.
■How often do you interrupt your work to check e-mail? (a) Three 
times a day. (b) Three times an hour. (c) Constantly.
■When reading RSS feeds, which do you do? (a) Set a time limit and 
cull out a few select posts that I want to act on. (b) Skim posts for 
interesting items a few times a day. (c) Read everything and anything 
until my brain is mush.

  Getting It Done
317
■When do you check in with your social networks on services such as 
Twitter and Facebook? (a) When I have specific things I want to share 
or am not at work. (b) Regularly to catch up with what everyone I 
know online is doing. (c) They’re always on because it’s more fun 
than working.
■How many e-mails do you have in your inbox right now? (a) Only 
those that I haven’t processed already today. (b) Only those I 
processed this week. (c) So many I don’t even want to think about 
this question.
■When’s the last time you cleaned up your browser’s bookmarks or 
favorites? (a) I do it weekly as part of clearing and processing sites 
into reference information and tasks to act on. (b) I have a system 
for organizing my URLS, but it needs a good cleanup. (c) It’s a 
hopeless mess.
If you answered (a) to all of these questions, then congratulations! If 
you answered (b) to most or all of them, then maybe it’s time to start 
noticing how much of your attention is being consumed by communica-
tion instead of by work. If you answered (c) to most or all of them, then 
it’s time to reinvent how you work online because your present approach 
is not going to serve your startup aspirations.
Online productivity means being in control of how much information 
you consume, when, and for what purpose. Now, maybe you’re an incred-
ibly intelligent person with so much brainpower and focus that you can 
constantly bombard yourself with web-based information and e-mails 
while powering through, with single-minded determination, one task after 
another all day long. But I wouldn’t bet on it. And it’s hard to believe that 
you’re doing your best work with a fire hose of information turned on full 
power and aimed square at your face.
Taming the Info Beast
Unfortunately, this book does not come equipped with a magic wand you 
can use to cast a spell around yourself that changes behavior, protects 
you from the crises of the moment, and neatly orders up the Online World. 
But there are ways you can improve your online productivity by making—
and when necessary remaking—a few simple changes in how you interact 
online. Note: These nine steps are simple, and they will significantly 
improve your online productivity, but it’s not easy breaking old habits.

  Getting It Done

1.
Create a firebreak. If your e-mail inbox has hundreds of unhandled 
messages, your RSS feeds are beyond control, and your bookmarks 
have run amok, you need to create some breathing space for your-
self. Change your online IM status to “unavailable,” Stick your unhan-
dled e-mail into a folder labeled “e-mail bankruptcy,” export your 
current RSS subscribes to an OPML file, and zero out your subscrip-
tions. Yes, this is pretty drastic stuff, but half efforts are inadequate to 
the challenge at hand.
2.
Reset e-mail expectations. First, change your automatic signature 
or add one to every e-mail (all e-mail clients can do this) so that 
it lets the world know what to expect when it communicates with 
you via e-mail. Nothing elaborate—I use “(I check e-mail several 
times during the business day.)”—but something to make clear 
that your days of always-on-e-mail are over.
3.
Reset e-mail usage. How many e-mails do you get that are self-
inflicted time-management wounds? You know what I mean: all 
those subscriber e-mails that over the years you either signed up 
for or passively let happen, from every Web 2.0 site on the planet, 
every online retailer of any size, every single news site. These aren’t 
communications—their info dumps at your expense. 
Here’s the algorithm: For each subscribed e-mail, unsubscribe 
unless it still has real value for you. If it does have value, switch to 
their RSS feed or use Page2RSS (http://page2rss.com), FeedYes 
(http://www.feedyes.com), or a similar tool5 to force a feed out 
them. Repeat until the queue of attention-draining e-mail infomer-
cials is empty.
4.
Repurpose your RSS Reader with PostRank. See Chapter 6 for 
details on how to use PostRank to attach a filtering system to you 
RSS reader of choice.
5.
Set IM/Skype boundaries. Whatever instant messaging client(s) 
you use, set the default status to something that makes clear that 
you’re less than immediately available. This may cut into your social 
life (startups, by the way, don’t have social lives), but it will cut 
down the number of times friends and family interrupt your work-
flow because you’ve given them permission.

Time-box and group your social media interactions. For example, 
morning and night I go on Twitter with Tweetie (Mac: http://www.
atebits.com/tweetie-mac, $19.95), respond to direct messages 
and mentions, lightly scan the timeline for anything worth spend-
ing time to investigate, retweeting, or commenting on, and then 
log off. I limit my Twitter time to my communication periods (see 
item 8), and that’s it, except when I am completing a task such as 
“Tweet finished Chapter 8.”
Again, the idea here is that when you’re communicating, you’re 
not working. You can no more expect to get a day’s work done with 
Twitter—or Facebook or whatever—on continuously than you could 
with your phone to your ear for eight hours.
7.
Set your public telephony to voicemail. I have a business telephone 
number. I don’t answer it—ever! My voicemail message makes clear 
that the best way to reach me is via e-mail—on my terms. Unless 
you’re behind a corporate telephony firewall, landlines in the 
United States are hopelessly pawned to robo-dialing telemarketers. I 
have a mobile phone. Only my family, friends, and the handful of 
people with whom I work day in and day out have that number.
8.
Schedule communication periods. In whatever calendar app you 
use to track appointments, create two to three 45-minute appoint-
ments for each day for the next week during which you will turn on 
e-mail, surfing, IM, Twitter, and all the rest. These are your commu-
nication periods, when—and only when—you process e-mail, chat 
with friends and coworkers, check sites, Twitter for fun, and gener-
ally be a social animal.
By scheduling this behavior, you start to get a handle on it—and 
realistically take it into account when estimating how much work 
you can get done in a day. I need between one and two hours a day for 
communication; you may need more or less than that.
9.
Go to the bank and get $100 in dollar bills. Then stack those nice 
crisp dollars (or pounds or euros) on one side of your desktop or 
notebook computer. Every time you check e-mail impulsively or 
use Google or another search engine to find a site that doesn’t 
have to do with what you are working on, take a dollar and throw it 
in the trashcan under your desk.

Huh? Did he just say throw away money? That’s exactly what I 
said—it’s time to do a little psychological makeover on yourself. 
After all, you’re wasting time and time is money—your money. 
This exercise just makes painfully explicit what you’re really doing, 
and it connects the near-universal socially instilled abhorrence of 
denigrating money with the reality of what you’re doing. Believe 
me, your behavior will change, and right quick.
Tools That Help
Improving your online productivity is not easy, but certain tools are out 
there that can be of help, and you should know about and consider using 
them if you don’t already. Here are four suggestions.
■For Microsoft Outlook users, I strongly recommend Claritude Soft-
ware’s Speedfiler 2.0 Professional (http://www.claritude.com, 
$39.95). Before I switched over to Macs, Speedfiler week in and 
week out saved me about 25% of the total time I’d spend in Outlook 
by making it possible to file e-mail fast. I figured it paid for itself in 
the first two days.
■For Mac Mail users, depending on whether you prefer to file or tag 
your e-mail, get either MailAct-On or MailTags from Indev Software 
(http://www.indev.ca/MailActOn.html, $24.95, or http://www.
indev.ca/MailTags.html, $29.95). In different ways, these two Mail 
add-ons speed up the processing of e-mail—a good thing.6
■David Allen’s GTD Connect (http://gtdconnect.com, $48/month 
or $480/year). If you’ve read the books and the blogs about GTD 
but are still struggling to make it work in your life, I’d recommend 
GTD Connect, David Allen’s online offering. GTD combines a huge 
library of video, audio, and text from Allen and other GTD trainers 
with a 16-module Getting Started course and member forums where 
you can learn from and share with others.
6  Full-disclosure time: Scott Morrison, Indev Software’s founder, became a consulting client of mine 
after I bought Mail Act-On.

■TimeBoxed on the Mac (http://www.macmation.com/TimeBoxed, 
14.99), TimeBox for Windows (http://www.taubler.com/timebox/
newuser.shtml, $9) or TimeBox for Linux (http://www.brothersoft.
com/timebox-for-linux-69058.html, free), Talk Timer for the iPhone 
(http://www.inuse.se/talktimer, free). All of these tools do the 
essentially the same thing—help you focus on a given task or activity 
for a given period of time. Yes, this is simple stuff, but having a 
reminder visible helps you to refocus.
Before we move on to developer productivity, one final point. Since 
you are presumably not an AI, don’t expect your productivity to go in one 
day from where it is to where it could be. You will experience setbacks. You 
will backslide. You will find old, ineffective habits reasserting themselves. 
That doesn’t matter. What matters is that you get up one more time than 
you fall down.
Developer Productivity
The next level of productivity improvement that will aid your startup 
effort is developer productivity. Simply put, programming is one of those 
activities in life where small differences in input can make huge differ-
ences in quality and quantity of output.
Let’s start with a bit of honest self-examination. It’s time to take Joel 
Spolsky’s The Joel Test.7
1.
Do you use source control?
2.
Can you make a build in one step?
3.
Do you make daily builds?
4.
Do you have a bug database?
5.
Do you fix bugs before writing new code?
6.
Do you have an up-to-date schedule?
7  See http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000043.html.

7.
Do you have a spec?
8.
Do your programmers have quiet working conditions?
9.
Do you use the best tools money can buy?
10.
Do you have testers?
11.
Do new candidates write code during their interview?
12.
Do you do hallway usability testing?
With the deferred exception of item 11, you should be answering yes 
to all of these questions. If you’ve ever wondered why Joel Spolsky is so 
popular with his fellow programmers, posts like The Joel Test are why—
they offer great advice that makes a real difference in one’s ability to execute.
Now, you may want to argue with some of the items on the Joel Test, 
but can you honestly say that if you’re going to be a professional developer 
they don’t apply? I don’t think so.
Beating the Google Loop
Joel posted his test to Joel on Software way back in 2000. (You could do a 
lot worse in terms of professional education reading his posts from that 
era on.) Meanwhile, Joel and well-known programmer Jeff Atwood have 
tackled a major inefficiency in how most developers develop. Tell me if 
this sounds familiar: You’re programming away in your language of choice 
and you hit a roadblock, a bug you can’t figure out, a hole in your mental 
database of programming expertise. So you Google it. And before you 
know it, you’re sifting through umpteen blog posts, code snippets, forum 
posts trying to figure out which pages have information that’s valid and 
pertinent today. Guess what? You’ve just spent an hour on this one prob-
lem, because Google shows answers based, not on how correct they are 
today, but on how many hits and links they’ve received cumulatively. You’ve 
just—again—gotten into the Google loop.
Joel’s and Jeff’s—and your—antidote to the Google loop is Stack 
Overflow (http://stackoverflow.com; Figure 8-4). Begun in 2008, Stack 
Overflow is an intelligent way for programmers to ask specific technical 
questions and get them answered in a timely way. Stack Overflow now gets 
over 600,000 page views and 250,000 visitors a day—a substantial portion 
of all programmers.

  Getting It Done
323
Figure 8-4. Stack Overflow
The mechanism behind Stack Overflow is deceptively simple: You post 
a technical question such as “Which table plug-in for jQuery are developers 
using?” or “Can I preemptively do caching in Django?” or “Why is WCF 
throwing an Exceptions.DataSourceNotFoundException in my code?” You 
tag it, and, as with a wiki, others can edit your question to improve it. 
Other developers gain reputation points by offering up answers, which 
range from RTFM to specific code examples, in a matter of minutes, hours, 
or days, and you decide which is the best answer offered. If you’ve been 
answering other people’s questions, then your reputation is higher, other 
developers working in the same area are more likely to respond, and you 
can offer a bounty of reputation points to them.
As of April 2009, how much was a reputation point worth? Zip. But 
it’s easy to see—given the success of the job board at Joel on Software—
how these reputation points and community badges could easily ascend 
into what Alvin Toffler calls a para-currency8 that has real, extrinsic value.

  Getting It Done
324
If you’re not using Stack Overflow to reduce the number of Google 
loops in your development process, you are shortchanging yourself in a 
major way—it’s that useful, that good, that comprehensive.
How Do You Learn?
Besides finding specific bits of information about the programming lan-
guages with which you are working in your startup, a larger, deeper prob-
lem is at work here: the half-life of technical information has plummeted 
this century. Back in the 20th century, entire years would go by when the 
definition of a programming language and what the best ways of using that 
language were would remain virtually unchanged. This gave programmers 
a chance to learn a language and gain some proficiency in it before having 
to retool to the next major version.
Now, regardless of what language or platform we are talking about, 
you’re lucky if you can go three months without a major change in what’s 
on offer. For example, during the 18 months I went from total Rails newbie to 
moderately competent midlevel proficiency, no less than five significant 
new versions were released.
Making matters worse from a productivity perspective, the number of 
specific languages and frameworks in which you need to be competent in 
order to build a monetizeable codebase has grown. For example, for a web 
app, in addition to your main programming language, at a bare minimum 
you’ll probably need JavaScript, a JavaScript framework such as jQuery, 
and CSS.
So how do you cope with rapid technical change? You could opt out: 
work with what you know, ignore new stuff, and get done. That will work 
(if getting to 1.0 is a matter of months, not years), but that new stuff can 
sometimes save you 10 to 50 times its weight in development time, avoid 
your getting caught in a bug bottle that was fixed in a later version, and 
open new functionalities your app could use. In sum, not a great choice.

Or you could just try to swot up whatever you need to improvise as 
you go along. That works, so long as you’re honest with yourself that you’re 
building in a variable amount of overhead to every programming task you 
tackle and that the overhead on any given day might explode in your face.
Or you can block out some percentage of your week just for keeping 
an active watch on the core languages and frameworks in which you’re 
working, running a quick scan of a core group of developer blogs that 
report new and relevant software developments, and playing with new 
code samples.
For example, I try to spend somewhere between one and two hours 
each week doing the following:
■Listening to the Rails Envy Podcast (http://www.railsenvy.com) 
and watching every single Railscast by Ryan Bates (http://
railscasts.com)
■Reading through Mike Gunderloy’s A Fresh Cup (http://
afreshcup.com)
■Doing a quick PostRank-powered scan of the feeds from RubyInside 
(http://www.rubyinside.com), ajaxian (http://ajaxian.com), 
nettuts+ (http://net.tutsplus.com), and a few other rails bloggers 
I follow9
■ Eyeballing what’s new and popular at GitHub for Ruby (http://
github.com/languages/Ruby) and JavaScript (http://github.com/
languages/JavaScript)
The more consistently I work through the foregoing as a specific task, 
the less of a nagging feeling I have that I’m missing some important tech-
nical development or time-saving Open Source project.
Now, which online technical sources make sense for you to follow will 
in all likelihood be different. But I think taking a systematic, timeboxable, 
scheduled approach to keeping up technically has a lot to offer.

Into the Heart of Darkness: 
Startup Developer Methodologies
So far in this section we’ve been talking about effective ways of gaining 
useful technical information in a systematic way—good stuff, useful, not 
particularly controversial. Here’s where that changes.
Ask five developers whether one specific developer methodology is 
better than others and you’ll get 10 opinions, ranging from passionate 
paeans to vehement denouncements of any and all. Now, I’m not here to 
pick a fight with you—after all, you were nice enough to buy this book—
but let me offer for your consideration the following.
■The methodology (or none) you use at your day job, be it as corpo-
rate code monkey or independent custom developer, serves the 
interests of the person who signs your check. However, for a small 
startup development team it may be exactly the wrong approach.
■You—and your cofounders if you have any—get to decide the soft-
ware methodology. And not deciding is a decision in itself.
■The appropriate software methodology for a given project can make 
the difference between success and failure.
All that said, I’d strongly recommend that you consider adopting an 
Agile development approach to your startup. I’m not saying that Waterfall, V-
Model, RUP, or Cleanroom are bad methodologies. But I do believe that a 
methodology that adheres to principles contained in the Agile Manifesto10 is 
more likely to fit what a startup needs and that Scrum in particular makes 
a great fit for startup software development.
Here’s the Wikipedia summary of Scrum:
“During each ‘sprint,’ typically a two- to four-week period (with the 
length being decided by the team), the team creates an increment of usable 
software. The set of features that go into a sprint come from the product 
‘backlog,’ which is a prioritized set of high-level requirements of work to 
be done. Which backlog items go into the sprint is determined during the 
sprint planning meeting. During this meeting, the product owner informs 
the team of the items in the product backlog that he wants completed. The 
team then determines how much of this they can commit to complete during 
the next sprint. During a sprint, no one is allowed to change the sprint backlog, 
which means that the requirements are frozen for that sprint. After a sprint 
is completed, the team demonstrates the use of the software.”11
10 See http://agilemanifesto.org/ and, of course, Wikipedia.

Detailing Agile development in theory and Scrum in particular has 
been done already by many other, more skillful programmers than I. In 
fact, there’s a mere 88 Scrum project management books currently listed 
at Amazon.com. Let me recommend exactly one to you, since you’re reading 
this book: Dan Pilone’s and Russ Miles’ Head First Software Development 
(O’Reilly, 2008). Now, Head First books aren’t everyone’s favorite approach, 
and you barely find mention of Agile in it. But that’s what this book con-
vincingly lays out.
Another good source to check out is Tim Haughton’s The Agile Micro 
ISV Blog at http://www.agilemicroisv.com. Up until just recently, Tim 
made his living helping British companies adopt and implement Agile 
software development methodologies.
For this book I asked Tim two questions: First, if you’re creating a 
startup with, say, up to three developers, why should you adopt an Agile 
methodology from the start?
“When any project is led by the developers, as is usually the case with 
small software startups, there is always the temptation to start coding way 
too early.” Tim replied. “One of the core aims of any creative project, soft-
ware or otherwise, is so obvious it is often overlooked: Build the Right 
Thing! By following an Agile method, you will be forced to have an under-
standing of your whole product, know what the high-value bits are, what 
the high-risk bits are, and have prioritized accordingly.
“By breaking the application’s functionality down into more finely 
grained ‘stories,’ you will again be hammering home the core message of 
“Build the Right Thing.” The stories will direct a developer’s hour-by-hour 
activities. One of a startup’s strengths is focus. Using an Agile method will 
turn the focus dial up to 10; not a moment will be wasted on frivolous, 
unfocused development activities.
“Other Agile techniques, such as Test Driven Development, ensure 
you do the next important thing: Build the Right Thing Right!
Second I asked Tim, in his knowledgeable opinion, which Agile meth-
odology offers the most bang to a startup?
“Ideally, any startup wanting to use an Agile method would under-
stand the key methods like eXtreme Programming and Scrum. But it’s 
more important to understand the synergies between the different prac-
tices within the methods; understanding how they play off each other. By 
embracing continuous improvement and tweaking the process as they go, 
the startup will end up at the right method for them.”

Once you’ve absorbed the basics of Agile and perhaps Scrum, I rec-
ommend two web apps to provide support for your startup: Acunote and 
scrum’d. Acunote (http://www.acunote.com, from free to $99 a month) is 
designed specifically to support Scrum, provides motivating burn-down 
charts, integrates with other tools you’re likely to use (Subversion, Trac, 
FogBugz, for example), and offers a generous free plan.
I used Acunote to plan and track StartupToDo’s development and 
found it a very lightweight and productive tool. Figure 8-5 presents a 
screenshot from one Acunote sprint.
Figure 8-5. Acunote
In 2009, a new tool came out that was a worthy competitor to Acunote: 
scrum’d (http://scrumd.com, from $6 to $79 a month, depending on the 
number of projects). Whereas Acunote focuses on sprints, tasks, and 
burn-down rates, scrum’d adds a level above this by supporting easy creation 
of user stories, assigning user stories to sprints, and employing user story 
points to estimate amounts of work (Figure 8-6).

Your Least Favorite Subject
There’s one final component of developer productivity we should discuss: 
tracking defects and providing tech support to your customers. Simply 
put, this is the yin to software development methodology yang, the other 
indispensable system you need in place before you launch. The more pro-
ficiently you and the rest of your startup team uses whatever system for 
collecting and processing bug reports, customer requests, and other inquir-
ies, the less friction involved in delivering better software, creating hap-
pier customers, and exploiting new opportunities.
Somehow you are going to have to track, prioritize, process, and close 
each and every reported bug. Somehow, each time a customer contacts 
your company, you need to understand what they want, treat them well, 
and ensure not only that the issue they brought to the table is resolved, 
but that their irritation, anger, and sometimes outright rage are replaced 
to the degree possible with passion, enthusiasm, and maybe a bit of grat-
itude. These are big “somehows.”

  Getting It Done
330
Unfortunately, many bug-tracking/customer-ticketing systems out 
there seem expressly designed to treat your customer like something you 
want to scrape off the bottom of your shoe. While large companies can get 
away with treating their customers like crap—for a while—your startup 
absolutely cannot. In the next chapter, we'll talk more about customer 
experience with one of the masters of the field, Lou Carbone. But for now, 
trust me, you do not want to be treating the people who pay you money 
like speeders caught and ticketed.
Depending on your customer base, there are two approaches I’d rec-
ommend. The first emphasizes developing happier customers through 
building and maintaining better software while creating an online envi-
ronment that supports converting complaining customers into your 
startup’s supporters. The second puts much less emphasis on the produc-
tivity of your developers and more functionality and effort into managing 
and improving each customer relationship that your startup has. Both 
approaches work; they are both better than competing and Open Source 
solutions. The key is what you sell and which approach is a better fit for 
your customers, not for you.
Fog Creek’s FogBugz
Since its first release in November 2000, FogBugz (http://www.fogcreek.
com/FogBugz, either $25 per month per SaaS user or $199 per year per 
user if you host12) has become a finely tuned tool for capturing and pro-
cessing defect reports, feature requests, and inquiries in the most devel-
oper-effective way possible (Figure 8-7).
The core of FogBugz is bug tracking. Bug reports—from your customers 
via e-mail, from your application, from within your startup—are collected and 
put through a process that ensures that whoever reported the bug has final 
say-so on whether it has been corrected. This one design point ensures 
that with FogBugz you don’t just file bug reports, you solve them.
Much of the depth of this product is its very careful design to make 
a team of people more effective at enhancing and developing a software 
application: from near-autonomous evidence-based work scheduling and 
estimation, to spam-proof customer e-mail, discussion group, and wiki 
functionality.
12 And you can convert your hosted trial FogBugz account into a Student and Startup Edition supporting 
two active users for free.

I’ve used FogBugz over the years—as a microISV supporting a Win-
dows desktop application and now as a startup improving and maintaining 
a web-based app and as a moderator at the large and popular Joel on Software 
Business of Software forum. When I say spam-free, results-oriented, low 
overhead, that’s exactly what I’ve seen.
That said, there are functionality decisions built into FogBugz that 
may not work for you. Some people want their system to provide more 
functionality directly to customers, such as a knowledgebase or a more 
traditional forum functionality. If that’s the case, UserScape’s HelpSpot 
(http://www.userscape.com, $199 or less per user) is a help-desk system 
you should definitely look into (Figure 8-8). With it’s customizable cus-
tomer portals, support for mobile devices such as the Apple iPhone, rules-
based workflow logic, and robust case management functionality, I think 
HelpSpot is a serious competitor of FogBugz’s and will fit people and star-
tups that FogBugz does not.

Now, both of these applications are well supplemented by one or more 
of the Startup Tools we covered in Chapter 4, specifically UserVoice and 
Get Satisfaction or both. I hope to see application programming inter-
faces (APIs) from both of these tools by the time you read this book so 
that both Fog Creek Software and UserScape can extend their software to 
connect to them.

I consider improving developer productivity a major leverage point: small 
amounts of effort can have a positive effect on a multitude of projects 
and areas of your startup. You can improve the quality and quantity of 
your LOC (lines of code) by producing a yes on each of the questions in 
The Joel Test and by actively participating in Stack Overflow, not by 10 or 
20% but by 300 or 400% percent.
Having a systematic approach to monitoring new developments and 
practices in the community surrounding the software languages, frame-
works, and tools you’re using daily to build your startup can let you deliver 
more useful functionality with less code and in less time than trying to 
shut out new developments.

333
Though no development methodology is going to build your app for you, 
picking an inappropriate methodology—or defaulting to no methodology—
lengthens the odds against your startup. If Scrum or Agile in general is not 
the approach for you, find something else that works. And adopting, using, 
and mastering a comprehensive bug-tracking system that synchs with the 
kind of customers your startup hopes to have comes under the heading of 
critical startup infrastructure, not an afterthought to development.
OK, enough said about developer productivity. It’s time to get back in 
the elevator and move to the next floor: how to be a productive startup 
founder.
Startup Founder Productivity
So you’ve got a GTD system in place that works for you, you no longer 
check e-mail 50 times a day like a crazed chimpanzee, and you under-
stand what you need to know—and just as much as you need to know—
about new stuff going on in your software language(s)/framework(s). 
Now what?
We got into this a bit in Chapter 5, but now that you are running a 
company (even if it’s a company of one or you’ve yet to make your first 
sale), you need to compartmentalize your usual work perspective and add 
to your repertoire a few new, CEO-like ways of doing things. No, I don’t 
mean you should turn into your last boss, but I do mean it’s time to start 
thinking like a founder of a software company, not as developer and certainly 
not as an employee or a contractor. If you’re going to build a successful 
startup, you must learn how to do some things that will run against your 
developer sensibilities.
Let’s start by making explicit five traits or practices about which you 
should be thinking hard and long. These new ways of thinking and acting 
are at the core of fulfilling your role in your startup.
■Focus on more than your app. As a developer, the right and proper 
thing to do is to focus, sometimes to the point of obsession, on the 
software you are creating. But if you focus solely on your app instead 
of on the overall business and the business you are in, odds are your 
startup is going to crash and burn. Creating and maintaining the 
software can only be one of several core things on which you need to 
focus. Just as important are communicating and sharing the value 
of your company’s product or service, improving and deepening the 
relationship between your company and your customers, and creating 
and maintaining a good work environment and healthy relationships 
within that environment.

■Analog beats digital. This is one point with which we coders tend to 
have a lot of trouble. We live in a professional world where, from the 
simplest routine to the largest system, every part of it is determinant. 
There is no ambiguity. In the business world, in the larger world in 
which you’ve chosen to participate, damn few things are black or 
white, 100% or zero percent. You’re going to have to get comfortable 
with large amounts of ambiguity, from what your customers see in 
your product or service that makes them open their wallets to herding 
like cats all the trade-offs you’ll have to make when allocating your 
and other people’s time, effort, and money.
■Get used to—and seek out—not being the smartest person in the 
room. Admit it: You harbor more than a little smugness and pride 
that you know how software and information technology work whereas 
nongeeks don’t. You’re just a little bit (hell, a lot) smarter than all 
those nonsoftware types—at least up until the moment you happen 
to talk to someone running a hundred-million-dollar company. Then 
you realize (a) you’re not at the top of the food chain and (b) you’d 
better start spending as much time as you can with your peers and 
above if you’re going to get the insights, mentorship, and wisdom 
you need to succeed.
■You’re going to need to be tough in general, sometimes down-
right ruthless. If you move past the microISV stage and hire people, 
you can bet that at some point you’ll need to fire people—even if 
they’re someone you’ve known for years. Even if you are your only 
employee, you’re going to have to be as ultrahard on yourself at 
times, owning up to mistakes you’ve made and opportunities you’ve 
missed, and getting the work done that needs doing, whether you 
like it or not. Startups aren’t for sissies.
■ You will be discovering new levels of obsession and work. Back in 
your day job, you might have moaned and whined about how many 
hours you worked. As founder of a startup, that level of effort and 
focus is the warm-up act. Of the scores of successful founders I’ve 
talked to, read about,13 and listened to, exactly none of them got 
there without working brain-exploding amounts of time and obsessing 
totally over their startups. Not one.

(Apress, 2008).

■You’re the leader, so lead. As founder, you no longer have the 
luxury and comfort of having a manager tell you what to do. You—
and your cofounders—are it. That sudden heaviness you feel on your 
shoulders is called responsibility and the sure and certain knowl-
edge that you’re going to make some bad decisions along the way. 
You might as well get used to it, because it’s part and parcel of 
running a business.
■You’re going to have to be confident to just this side of arrogant. 
Don’t expect customers to buy, investors to put up their money, 
partners to execute, or contractors to perform unless you exude 
confidence from every pore. If you don’t believe totally that you’re 
going to succeed, how can you expect others to? Two further pieces 
of advice regarding confidence: First, if you’re not 100% confident 
in your software idea and its execution, then fake it. Seriously. Act 
the part and you will become the part. Second, there are two occu-
pational health hazards to starting a company—heart attacks 
brought on by high stress, junk food, and no exercise and ego infla-
tion until you look like and act like a giant balloon in a parade. We 
can all name names here—just don’t make the mistake that arro-
gance causes success.
Tools for Founder Productivity
I have three tools to suggest for improving your founder productivity, 
and, yes, one of them is mine (I did, after all, write the preceding section!). 
The first tool is a notebook. It can be a real, live physical notebook 
(check out Moleskines at http://www.moleskines.com), or it can be 
digital, such as Circus Ponies Software’s Notebook for the Mac (http://
www.circusponies.com, $49.95), which I use.
This particular notebook is going to have (at least) three main sec-
tions: Your Business Plan, Weekly Progress Reports, and an Assumptions 
and Decisions section. Let’s examine each of those a bit more closely.
Your Business Plan. No, this is not the raising capital-type business 
plan we discussed in Chapter 5; this is your real business plan. Specifi-
cally, it’s a structured, constantly updated document that records your 
business planning, not something you create with which to impress the 
money people. It’s not polished, it’s not professionally formatted, and it 
doesn’t have to be neat or clean any more than the working drawings of an 
architect once the house is under construction.

  Getting It Done

Since this document is not for anyone but you and your cofounders, 
it’s entirely up to you how it’s structured. That said, the purpose of this 
tool is find the answers—and to keep finding the answers—to a set of very 
fundamental questions.
■Why are we building this company?
■What exactly are we selling?
■Who will buy what we are selling and why?
■How are we going connect what we are selling to the people who we 
think will buy?
■How do we measure success?
Answering these questions will lead to all sorts of other questions.
■What parts of doing this business do we really care about and 
consider core company functions, and which parts should we 
outsource one way or another?
■What are the characteristics, traits, attitudes, buying habits, and 
expectations of a typical person in our primary market?
■What makes this startup different from all the other software 
companies out there?
■What are the strengths and weaknesses of myself and my cofounders? 
How and when will we add the services of others to augment those 
strengths and compensate for those weaknesses?
■What’s our competition?
■What needs and desires of our target market does our software 
address? And how well does it address them as of launch, at the first 
major upgrade, and further down the road?
You see, a business plan is all about asking—and answering—the 
questions you know you need to ask. It’s an iterative process: the ques-
tions don’t stop coming, and the answers change over time.
Weekly Progress Reports. If you can’t or won’t measure what you are 
doing, then you’re not building a startup, your enjoying a hobby. That means 
holding yourself accountable for whether you execute. And that means 
defining on a regular basis—weekly works for most people—what you as a 
founder are going to accomplish in the next seven days and what you as 
a founder did accomplish in the past seven days.

  Getting It Done
337
Note the “you as a founder” construction. This is more—a lot more—
than how many lines of code you write; it needs to cover the gamut of 
roles you undertake in your company.
A good format for your weekly progress report is a set of your top six 
(no more) planned accomplishments for the week ahead, in enough spec-
ificity so that you will be able to measure what you’ve accomplished. Here’s 
a sampling of what I mean.
Progress Report for the Week of June 1, 2009
1.
As developer, I will complete the beta build sprint of StartupToDo.
com, with all tests passing, and deploy it to the VPS.
2.
As community manager, I invite the first 10 beta testers to log into 
StartupToDo and to get their initial feedback either by speaking 
with them via Skype or by discussing via e-mail.
3.
As blogger, I will post a description of what the problem is with asking 
others for feedback on your startup or microISV site at a public forum 
and how StartupToDo provides a more powerful and functional 
environment for transactions such as this to occur.
4.
As content developer, I will complete and proof another five 
StartupToDo Public Projects and add them to the production build.
5.
As system admin, I will review the New Relic RPM Lite data to identify 
the three slowest controller queries and improve their performance.
(Not shown, but important: Leave space to answer each objective: 
done, or not done and why not done. The “why not done” can be as impor-
tant as the objective itself.)
Assumptions and Decisions. Here’s something curious I’ve noticed 
that’s true for most startups: The initial assumptions about what your 
market really wants, which features they’ll especially like, how long it will 
take to build the app, and so forth tend to be dead wrong. That’s OK, so 
long as you know what your assumptions are, review them on a periodic 
basis and in light of empirical evidence, and adjust as needed.
Reviewing and “tuning” your assumptions gets a lot easier when 
you’ve externalized them—and that means writing them down in a some-
what structured way (Date, Area, and Assumption works for me and will 
probably work for you) and reviewing them at least once a month. These 
are, after all, the facts on which you are building your business.
Decisions go hand-in-hand with assumptions—sometimes right off a 
cliff. By definition, your job as founder is to make decisions—hopefully 
more good, accurate, useful, effective decisions than bad, unrealistic, 
ineffective, unproductive decisions. But you won’t know if they are good 

  Getting It Done
338
or bad if you don’t keep score. It’s like estimating how long it will take to 
write a given chunk of functionality. Until and unless you start measuring 
your estimates against your reality, you are in the Land of Make-Believe. 
What’s more, the more feedback you get, the better your estimating—or 
your decision making—gets.
Again, this notebook is highly proprietary information. You should 
not share its existence, let alone its contents, with anyone except perhaps 
your partners. But used correctly it will close the loop between what you 
plan and what actually happens. And closing this loop helps you improve 
your business planning, objective setting, and decision making—all things at 
the top of your founder job description.
He’s at It Again!
Okay, one more plug for StartupToDo.com (http://startuptodo.com). 
Hopefully by now you’ve checked it out and joined (thank you!). But if 
you haven’t or you hated it, I think the reasoning behind it stands on its 
own as your second startup founder productivity tool.
■If your startup is going to succeed, you have to build momentum. 
You’re going nowhere but in circles if you work on your startup 
fitfully, taking weeks off from it. That won’t work before launch, 
and it certainly won’t work after. The StartupToDo point system 
builds momentum by giving you an easy way to compare what 
you’ve accomplished this week to what you accomplished last week, 
to your friends in the StartupToDo community and to other startups 
like you.
■You need to separate research/analysis from execution. Building a 
startup involves hundreds of specific, multiple-task projects of huge 
variety; for each project, you need to know what you are going to do 
before you do it. The research/discovery/Google-it-to-death phase, if 
not managed, will eat all of your implementation/execution time, 
especially if you’re bootstrapping your startup. StartupToDo’s 
core goodness is its hundreds of projects containing specific steps, 
recommendations, and URLs to content on the Web written by myself 
and other fellow startup founders. Since things change fast in this 
business, these projects get updated by members as they work on 
them via comments, whereas only people you explicitly allow (your 
partners) can see the details of your projects.

  Getting It Done
339
■There are no absolute answers in this business. There is no one 
right way to picking a company name, creating a deployment check-
list, working with a graphic designer, communicating your startup’s 
core message. Your job as a startup founder is to sift, weigh, and 
judge and jiggle multiple approaches and then to execute what you 
think is the right approach for your startup. That’s why you’ll find at 
StartupToDo multiple projects written by many different people in 
the community, often taking different approaches to the same desired 
outcome—and why we’re all looking forward to your contributed 
Public Projects.
■You need honest feedback. You definitely need honest feedback 
on your app, on your site, on your value proposition, on your market. 
That’s why StartupToDo has Review Requests and makes its dirt 
easy to get constructive criticism from your peers in a trusted envi-
ronment instead of a public, search-engine-indexed forum.
■Startups can be lonely. A lot of the people you know probably don’t 
understand what you’re attempting to do or why. Hanging out with 
other entrepreneurs and being able to get and give advice, technical 
pointers, ideas, and support is a huge help. That’s why the social 
side of StartupToDo—Groups, where you can share online discus-
sions, specific resources and finds, Friends, with whom you can (in 
a friendly way) compete and cooperate, and Partners (others who 
are actually working with you on your startup)—is so important.
Okay, enough about Startuptodo. There’s one last “tool” to increase 
your startup founder productivity I strongly recommend—other startup 
founders. Go back to Chapter 4 as one place to begin. But make a commit-
ment to start spending some time, in person, with other startup founders, 
entrepreneurs, and people who run their own companies. Make the effort 
to get physically involved in groups and organizations of other people who 
share your passion for self-determination. While I’m a big believer in all 
things online, face-to-face beats it cold when it comes to this.
Recap
In some ways, building a startup is the reverse of nuclear fission. Instead 
of converting some tiny amount of matter into an explosive amount of 
energy, you’re going to convert a huge amount of your personal energy 
into an actual thing.

  Getting It Done
340
Each and every way you can be more efficient with that energy—be it 
your time, your attention, or your intelligence—means a faster and better 
conversion process. Improving your productivity—in general, online, as a 
developer, as a founder—is the gift that keeps on giving.
In this chapter we started with the basics one step above getting out 
of bed in the morning: how you collect, manage, and process tasks. As a 
lightweight, agnostic methodology for that, David Allen’s Getting Things 
Done is the best we’ve got, and it’s something you should get into as well.
In this business, online productivity is not a nice-to-have, it is a must-
have. Taming your e-mail, RSS feeds, and online social interactions is a 
key milestone to reclaiming enough time and attention to build your startup.
Developer productivity—seeking out and adopting activities that 
other developers use to be productive and opting out of the Google loop 
via Stack Overflow—goes to the heart of what you do and what you offer. 
Two of the most important of those adoptions are a development method-
ology and a-bug tracking system that fits your startup.
Finally, becoming a founder of a company of whatever initial size means 
you need to plan, to lead, to assess, to act in new and perhaps uncomfort-
able ways. You grow into this new role in life by adopting practices and 
tools that help you act like a founder and by seeking out other founders 
and executives.
All right, I think you’ve heard quite enough from me. In the next 
chapter we sit down with—and I get out of the way of—six very successful 
people from whom we can learn a lot. Grab your highlighter, refill that 
caffeine container: next up, Six Wise People.

Some People You Ought to Listen To
How do people accomplish big things like building a company? There’s 
no one formula, but there are common ingredients—perseverance, large 
amounts of hard work, listening keenly to others who’ve succeeded.
That last bit is what we get into in this chapter, in the form of six 
interviews with people from whom I think you’ll learn valuable lessons, 
cheaply. I say cheaply because each of these people has already paid the 
price to learn what he or she is most generously sharing with you here.
So what can four successful software company founders, a highly 
respected Fortune 500 consultant, and a writer and blogger on how to 
break free of other people’s companies teach you? Quite a bit actually. 
Time to get out the highlighter or to turn it on in your pdf reader and get

Dharmesh Shah, Founder, Chief Software Architect, HubSpot
Let’s start with a number: $17.5 million. That’s how much Dharmesh Shah 
(Figure 9-1) has raised for his third startup, HubSpot, an inbound-marketing 
system designed to help businesses get found on the net by prospective 
customers and to turn those prospective customers into actual customers.
Figure 9-1. Dharmesh Shaw
Like most “instant successes,” Dharmesh is anything but. Back in 1992, he 
was a typical programmer working for a large enterprise. By 1994, at age 24, 
he’d become bored with his programming job and launched his first startup, 
Pyramid Digital Solutions, with $10,000 of his own money. Pyramid took off, 
winning awards and customers by creating and selling a web-based retire-
ment plan industry application. In October 2005 Dharmesh sold Pyramid to 
SunGard Business Systems, a large IT services firm (and the same company 
he had worked for 11 years earlier).
I first got to know Dharmesh in 2006 when he contacted me for his master’s 
thesis on startup companies, on his way to an M.S. in innovation and global 
leadership in the MIT Sloan Fellows Program.
In 2006, besides working on his M.S. and launching HubSpot (http://www.
hubspot.com), Dharmesh launched his blog OnStartups (http://
onstartups.com) as both a place to share his entrepreneurial insights and 
experience and a forum to challenge some of the conventional wisdom 
about what founders needed to do to be successful.

A Nagging Feeling
Bob: So, Dharmesh, you’ve started three startups. You’ve created 10 
commercial applications. You’ve now raised over $17 million in funding. 
How’s life going?
Dharmesh: Life is going well. It keeps me busy, but I have the same genetic 
flaw that I think a lot of your readers have, which is that we’re just gluttons 
for punishment. So we continue to do the startup thing over and over again. 
It’s hard to stop at just one.
Bob: How did you decide to get into your first startup?
Dharmesh: I did my first startup right out of computer science undergrad 
work. There was no big idea for that first startup. I was working with, obvi-
ously, a bunch of programmers. I was a software developer myself, and I was 
working in a big multibillion-dollar company. Although the company itself 
was doing well and the environment was good, I just didn’t see that it was 
really leveraging all of the kinds of talents and skills of the other program-
mers. I’m like, “It doesn’t seem like we’re as productive as we could be. It 
doesn’t seem like we’re solving the problems as efficiently as we would like 
them to be.”
So the original startup was really around “Can we take some smart people 
and solve interesting problems? We’ll make money along the way, someway, 
somehow.” The idea that the company then formed around came after the 
company formation.
Bob: It wasn’t a case of “I have this burning passion to create a particular 
solution.” It was more a desire to build something plus using underutilized 
resources?
Dharmesh: Yes, it’s not so much underutilized. You have to be a 
programmer, which you are. But it’s that when you write code and you’re in 
team environments and you’re working for a company, you have this nagging 
feeling that there’s a better way to produce highly profitable software. The 
genesis of a lot of software developers is, if you want to do things well, 
you’re, like, “OK, I’m not sure of the approach that we’re taking, whether 
it’s product management or whatever it is. It’s like we’re just not doing 
things as well as we could be.”
The concept wasn’t a product idea. It was “Can we create an environment 
for really smart developers?” We were all in our early 20s, ready “to go off 
and solve big problems for big companies,” but to do it in ways that we 
thought were much more productive, essentially. That wasn’t really possible 
in a big company.
So we’re solving more for the culture than we were for any given product 
idea in that first startup.

  Six Wise People

Bob: In that first startup, did you self-fund, or did you go looking for money?
Dharmesh: Self-funded it. So we started with $10,000 in capital. I was rela-
tively new to the country at the time. I honestly did not know what venture 
capital was. The term had never entered my vocabulary. I had never read 
about it, never heard about it, never talked to anyone about it. So the sheer 
notion that you’d go off and raise capital to fund something just hadn’t been 
part of my mindset at all. I didn’t know of any other way than saying, “I’ve 
got this much cash. I put it in. I’ve got to go off and find customers in order 
to be able to really do anything.” It was bootstrapped simply because I didn’t 
know any other way.
To Raise or Not to Raise—That Is the Question
Bob: What was the first startup that you actually went out and got some 
outside funding for? Was that HubSpot?
Dharmesh: HubSpot’s the first company I raised outside capital for, which 
was my third startup.
Bob: How did you do it?
Dharmesh: In terms of raising capital, it’s interesting. The first decision is 
around deciding you actually want to do it. It sounds glamorous. It’s like, 
“Oh, you go off and raise venture capital.” It’s great to get really smart people 
involved. Obviously the money’s nice, too. You can go off and do all these 
wonderful things with the money. But there’s actually a decision process 
around whether you do or don’t want to raise capital. Lots of trade-offs. 
The big one is really around deciding what it is you’re trying to build and 
what success looks like. For instance, there are two broadly defined outcomes. 
You can say, “I’m going to do,” which is what I did for my first and second 
startups. “I’m going to do a bootstrap company with a modest outcome,” 
which I’ll define, let’s say, as between $10 million and $50 million outcome.
It’s OK by me. I’m going to own most of that pie. I’m not going to become 
famous, but I can make some cash, get an exit, and get some money, even if 
it’s a small part of something really, really, really big, and that’s fine too. I 
think what entrepreneurs fail to do sometimes is think through, “Do they 
really want to raise capital or not?”
Once you decide that “I want to swing really big, really hard, and go after 
something really big, then it’s a matter of finding an idea, essentially, that has 
that large-magnitude opportunity, and then demonstrating a passion around 
it. I don’t know how deep you want to go into that. We can talk for hours 
about raising venture capital.
Bob: Let’s talk a little further because there is this air of mystery, I would 
describe it, around the process of successfully getting that first initial round 
of somebody else’s money to put into your idea. I’m hearing two things here. 
One is that it’s got to be an idea that has a huge payout potential, if you’re

  Six Wise People
345
going to attract any type of investment, especially insofar as that’s a very 
risky investment by anybody’s standards. The other thing I’m hearing is that 
you didn’t do this the first time around or the second. This was on your 
third startup.
Dharmesh: Yes, and I almost didn’t do it on the third one as well. I did the 
seed-round funding for my third startup and then did an angel-round funding, 
just by networking. It was $1.5 million of capital later that we actually 
decided to bring a VC into the mix. Even then, I was not 100% certain that I 
even wanted to raise venture capital for my third one, because the trade-offs 
are significant.
Bob: Of equity for that funding?
Dharmesh: Not just a matter of equity. Obviously, you’re going to give up 
some portion of your company in terms of just shares and percentage, but 
the dynamics of the business do change. Now you have different parties at 
the table in terms of having institutional investors. For the most part, your 
goals are aligned. You both want to create a really big, successful company. 
But there is a certain dynamic to remembering that venture capitalists have 
a portfolio of startups that they’re investing in. So they’ll have 10, 20, 50 
startup companies that they’re invested in, where you have only one.
This goes to how you actually raise capital. You have to understand this 
dynamic, which is VCs saying, “We’re going to go off and invest, say, 20 
different startup opportunities.” Their expectation is that each of those 20 
startup opportunities has a chance, however small, of being really, really big, 
of being the next Google, of being the next YouTube or something like that, 
in the hopes that if one or two of them actually pulls that off, it carries the 
rest of the portfolio.
What VCs are not doing is, “Oh, I’m going to invest in these 20 startups, all 
of which have a decent chance of a modest outcome.” Because what ends up 
happening is the risk is so high that most of them, even though they have a 
decent chance, are going to fail to pull off even that modest outcome. The 
ones that are successful are not successful enough to really create the return 
that’s necessary for them to demonstrate to their investors.
Bob: So they’re hoping for the grand slam, but they’re taking the approach 
that there’s going to be a whole lot of outs as well.
Dharmesh: Absolutely. You have to demonstrate that your opportunity, 
your idea, has the potential to be big enough to carry, essentially, close 
to the rest of the portfolio, that you have to be that one. You’re going to 
passionately work at being that one. The VCs recognize that they’re not going 
to be able to get several of these big outcomes, but they’re expecting some small 
percentage of their portfolio is going to actually pull it off. It’s very rare that 
anyone pulls it off, if no one’s actually swinging hard and trying. It doesn’t happen, 
for the most part, accidentally.

  Six Wise People
346
What About Angel Investors?
Bob: Are angel investors like VCs, only smaller? Or are they fundamentally 
different? Is there something that startups need to know?
Dharmesh: The thing that startups need to know is that this particular 
dynamic is very different. Other than just the magnitude of capital that they’ll 
invest, angels are different. I’m an angel investor as well. I’ve got an invest-
ment in, I think, nine startups now. The way the angels look at it is that, for 
the most part, they’re entrepreneurs themselves that have made some money 
along the way. They’re living vicariously through the entrepreneurs again. 
That’s essentially what I do. That’s what a lot of angels do.
It’s not their job. They’re not saying, “OK, it’s 2009, I’ve got this much money 
to deploy. That means I can make three investments this year, and I’m out 
there looking, actively seeking. I have to ‘deploy’ this capital efficiently into 
opportunities.”
Angels are much more opportunistic. They invest in startups because they 
really love the people. They really love the idea. They’re just jumping in because 
they really want to be involved in some small way.
It’s a very different dynamic. Angels don’t really have to demonstrate in order 
for them to kind of maintain being who they are, like a VC does. They don’t 
have to demonstrate that big outcome. They’re not necessarily looking for 
that grand slam.
Even a series of modest outcomes is actually often sufficient. Often, they’re 
not even necessarily looking for pure financial returns. There’s something 
beyond that. VCs, at the end of the day, are measured completely based on 
the returns that they’re generating for their limited partners. Angels, not so 
much. There’s a variety of things that can matter to an angel investor.
Bob: Let’s talk, for a moment; to you in your angel investor hat. Two questions: 
One, if I’m a startup looking for an angel, should I come knock on your door? 
Two, the flip side of that: What got you interested in the nine startups that 
you presently are invested in?
Dharmesh: Actually, I don’t actively seek. I have enough in the network right 
now, people that I’ll come across. Because it’s more me looking at ideas and 
finding people that I’m interested in, versus the other way around. That’s the 
candid response. Although people are welcome to send me an e-mail, my 
take rate is actually very, very low because I don’t do that many deals. I’ll do 
probably one or two a year. That’s the first thing.
What I am generally looking for are passionate entrepreneurs that just need 
a little bit of capital to pull something off. They’ve made it a little bit of the 
way there. I invest exclusively in software companies or tech companies, 
mostly web-based or Internet-based, because they’re capital efficient.
What attracts me to a particular opportunity is when I see this glimmer of 
what could be a really big idea, so there’s that little bit of VC in me. I want 
that big outcome, but there’s something really practical about the entrepreneur.

  Six Wise People
347
There are some entrepreneurs that you meet with or have a conversation 
with and there’s something about them that signals, “I’m going to find a way 
to make this successful, and successful to me even means just having a 
modest outcome.”
There are certain entrepreneurs that will end up making money. It may not 
be the idea that you’re talking about right now, but they will handle their 
path through the woods and somehow emerge.
I’ve seen this over 15 or 20 years of being in the software business. Of all the 
people that you would expect, here’s a woman that’s just going to make 
money. I like that gene. I have a tendency to invest in pragmatic entrepre-
neurs, essentially.
It’s Not the Concept
Bob: So it’s more than just the concept. It’s the person behind the concept 
or the people behind the concept. That’s what you’re investing in.
Dharmesh: Very much so. So the concept itself, although interesting and it 
can be appealing, changes so often. If you are a student of the startup game, 
most of these successful startups that you encounter, that are even big 
names, if you dig a little bit deeper, they didn’t start with that idea. They 
evolved into it or fell into it or came across it as a result of something else 
that they were doing. I think that’s typical. So investing in just a specific idea, 
I don’t think is particularly effective. What I like to do is what the idea is 
representative of the entrepreneur often. Here’s a class of problem this 
entrepreneur is interested in solving. Is that particular class of problem 
something worthwhile or something that I could get excited about?
Bob: This ability to make money as a founder, in other words, not the idea, 
but this character trait. What does that look like when it’s at home? Is that 
perseverance, determination, flexibility, obsession? How would you describe 
that to people?
Dharmesh: If I had to describe it, I would describe it in two ways. One 
would be objectivity, in terms of being objective about the world around you 
and saying, “The world really doesn’t owe me anything. I have this idea, 
which I think is decent.” But they can see all the flaws and all the hardships 
that are ahead. They’re basically realists. They’re not living this distorted reality. 
They’re not reading all these articles about multibillion-dollar software 
startups and thinking they’re going to pull it off. They’re realists and objec-
tive about how hard it’s going to be. That’s part one.
Part two is that they’re just optimistic enough to actually do what most 
people would consider to be semicrazy things. So if you’re in it just to make 
money, if you could have been a great entrepreneur—I’m talking specifically 
about software entrepreneurs—you could have made money just working 
for other people the rest of your life. Probably, in the whole grand scheme 
of things, you probably would have made more money.

  Six Wise People
348
Software entrepreneurs don’t get into it for the money. They get into it because 
there’s something else. You have to have this naive optimism about you, 
coupled with this objective to see the world as it is, and react accordingly. 
It’s that mix that I think really pulls off that pragmatic entrepreneur.
Finding Founders and First Hires
Bob: Let’s turn, for a moment, to HubSpot. How do you build a team around, 
or in, a startup? You’ve started with a couple of other founders. How did you 
end up picking those people to build HubSpot?
Dharmesh: There are two founders in the company. My cofounder and I 
actually met in grad school at MIT. So we had to be thrown together. We 
had similar, overlapping passions around the software industry and small 
business, which was the market we were going after. But we were both very 
different. He has a sales and distribution background. I have a software 
development and technology background. It comes back to the same kinds 
of traits I look for if I’m looking for an investment. They’re the kinds of people 
I think do really well joining an early startup team. If you look at both my 
cofounder and then the management team that we’ve built out, they’ve all 
that entrepreneurial kind of mindset.
In the early days of most startups, if you have to choose between hiring gener-
alists and specialists, my leaning in the early days is always to hire generalists, 
people who wear several hats, whether it’s doing finance stuff or accounting, 
selling or marketing, or writing code, whatever it happens to be.
Most startups can’t afford to hire a person that’s really, really good at just 
one thing. That’s all they really want to do. Because there’s just not enough 
resources to really do that.
Just find those practical people that have a passion for building something 
and pull them in. They already have a genetic flaw, because that’s what makes 
them entrepreneurs. You just have to figure out how to detect it and then 
tap into that and give them something fun to work on. Tap the passion.
Bob: I’m not sure if it’s a flaw or an evolutionary advantage, but I get the 
feeling that you’re really talking about a certain type of person. That’s what 
attracts you, whether they are going to be your cofounder or whether they’re 
going to be somebody that works in your company or whether you think 
they’re worth putting your money into as an investor.
Dharmesh: That’s exactly it.
Getting Them to Come to You
Bob: I’ve noticed that you’re doing a variety of things at HubSpot that don’t 
seem to have a lot to do, necessarily, with the idea of inbound marketing for 
small and middle-sized companies. There’s the Website Grader (http://
website.grader.com). There’s the Twitter Grader (http://twitter.
grader.com). Are these just tactics to pull eyeballs, and are they working?

Dharmesh: If you look at the greater family of free tools that we have, the 
original genesis of Website Grader is where it all started. The idea originally 
was related to the business around marketing, because what we were doing 
is spending a lot of time looking at small business web sites, trying to figure 
out how effective those web sites were from a marketing perspective. This was 
in the early days of HubSpot. Primarily to get an assessment of “Is there a good 
fit here? Can we help? How far along in the evolutionary process, as far as 
inbound marketing, is this particular small business?”
What we found ourselves doing is the same kind of repetitive lookup. “Let’s 
look at their Alexa traffic ranking. Let’s look at their SEO. Let’s look at the 
HTML code and all these things.”
It wouldn’t be that hard to automate some of this stuff. It was done originally 
to basically save me time, since we’re talking to all these prospective customers.  
Around the same time that this was happening, I was looking at a lot of these 
things, and so I hoped that it wouldn’t be that hard to automate some of this 
stuff. It was done originally just to save me time. We’re talking to all these 
prospective customers, and it’s interesting that, around the same time that 
this was happening, I was looking at a lot of potential angel investments.
I was doing the same kinds of things to look at as if I was going to put money 
into a web startup, “OK, where are they on the overall inbound marketing 
spectrum? Are they really, really sophisticated? Do they have really high search 
engine rankings? How’s the company doing?” So I wrote a script, essentially 
a small tool just to automate the things I was doing, primarily for my own use.
It was about a week or so later, and I’m like, “This is kind of semiuseful. 
Maybe other people will find it useful too and we can just put it out there on 
the Web.” It’s interesting, in the early days of Website Grader, it didn’t even 
ask for an e-mail address, there was no lead generation. I had no concept as 
to what I wanted to do with it; it was just a tool that I have found useful that 
I thought others might as well.
Fast-forward a little bit: at this point now we’ve graded, or Website Grader 
has graded, 800,000 web sites and is the single largest lead generation source 
for HubSpot. We generate a lot of leads, because we’ve got 1,200 customers, 
20 inside salespeople. It’s been a phenomenal success for us.
Bob: There’s Website Grader, but then there’s Twitter Grader.
Dharmesh: There is.
Bob: What’s the genesis of that? That gets us into the whole social media 
question.
Dharmesh: Sure, so a couple of things, if you go back through history, you’ve 
got this Website Grader tool that made us a bunch of money in terms of 
being able to drive lots of qualified leads to HubSpot and help us find customers. 
What I was looking to do was to say, “OK. How can we repeat that pattern? 
What is it about Website Grader that people liked? We were looking basically

for another hit, that says, “Well, can we create other grading tools, and what 
is it about that particular tool that people are finding interesting?” So we 
essentially said, “OK.” I was just getting into Twitter at the time. I’m like, 
“Oh well, maybe we could do something. Instead of grading a web site, we 
could grade someone’s Twitter profile.” It sounded kind of silly at the time. 
Right now, I guess, it still sounds a little bit silly, and I get lots of controversy 
around it. But that was the original idea.
I was like, “OK, well let’s just look at someone’s you know. What kind of 
attributes of a Twitter profile would we look at?” In terms of number of 
followers, what kind of followers? How often are they Tweeting? How often 
are they being reTweeted? Let’s check out all of those things and attach a 
score to that (Figure 9-2).
Figure 9-2. HubSpot’s Twitter Grader
Twitter Grader has really, really taken off. It actually generates more traffic, 
in terms of just raw eyeballs, than Website Grader does. It gets over 1 million 
page views and 30,000 uses a day, for just Twitter grader.
Bob: Wow!
Dharmesh: So it’s been a phenomenal success in terms of just raw activity. 
Now it’s on the top 10 sources of lead generation for HubSpot as well. It’s 
not quite a moneymaking machine, as Website Grader was, but still profitable in 
terms of how easy it was to develop and how much traffic and leads it was 
generating.
Bob: Well, let me ask you this: Among the things you’re doing at HubSpot 
is trying to help small, medium businesses with their marketing. Is traditional 
marketing dead, given social networking? Should companies use Twitter and 
Facebook and all the other social tools, instead of traditional marketing and 
advertising? Do you buy into that, or do you see it differently?

  Six Wise People
351
Dharmesh: I do buy in to that. I don’t think it’s dead, but I think it’s becoming 
increasingly less effective. So just look at our own individual behaviors. What 
we have now is all of these outbound messages, people targeting us and sending 
us junk mail or telemarketers calling us or e-mail spam. All of those kinds of
 things are becoming increasingly less effective simply because we, as consumers, 
are now very, very good at blocking those messages out. We have spam 
protection, we don’t go through our junk mail anymore, we’ve got caller ID 
on our phones. So it’s much harder to get to us as consumers now through 
those classic outbound channels. What I think the world is kind of moving 
toward is where the consumer has much more control and says, “OK, I’m 
actually looking for something; and when I’m looking for it, then I’m much more 
likely to respond to marketing information and to actually buy something.”
So we think this is actually a very good thing for small businesses and startups. 
The reason is that outbound marketing historically was always defined by 
how big of a marketing budget you had. Could you afford to advertise? 
Could you afford to hire a bank of telemarketers just to cold-call people? 
How successful you were in terms of getting market share and then customers 
was the definition of what we like to call “the width of your wallet.”
Which is, basically, if you have a big budget, you had a chance. If you didn’t 
have a big budget, it was really hard to kind of get any attention. With inbound 
marketing now, it’s becoming much more about your creativity and your 
openness and the degree to which you can actually engage people and estab-
lish some trust and authority on the Web.
We think that’s a much more effective way these days, instead of spending 
all this money trying to have your message broadcast to people far and wide 
in a hope that some small percentage of them who care will actually call you 
or buy from you. We think it’s just much more fruitful to say, “OK, we’ll set 
up your web site correctly, put yourself out there in the social media web 
site. So those that are already looking for you or what you have to offer will 
actually find it.”
Bob: That kind of brings us around to your blog on startups. I know from 
my own experience how much time and effort it takes to do a good blog. 
That’s got to be eating a good chunk of your total time. You obviously have 
other things to do. Why do you keep working that since you surely don’t 
need it anymore? Or do you?
Dharmesh: I don’t. OnStartups was actually originally begun as part of my 
MIT graduate thesis. It wasn’t really business related. It’s interesting how 
that evolved. Ultimately OnStartups and the lessons from the blog itself 
were some of the original genesis for the HubSpot idea. We’re, like, “OK. 
Well, this blog is actually able to attract traffic,” and I was seeing it attract 
more traffic in some cases than some of the venture-backed startups that I 
knew had relatively large budgets. What we were trying to do is bottle up

  Six Wise People
352
the lessons from blogging on startups and figure out how we can help small 
businesses do that. In terms of why I still do it today, because I just have it 
in me. I’ve got this propensity to try and say semiuseful things as fun. Even 
from a raw business perspective, for me personally, it is still profitable. All of 
the deals that I do generally will originate on Startups.com; that’s where I 
find entrepreneurs that are interesting.
We still get leads for HubSpot through that and it’s still a productive use of 
time. Even if it wasn’t, I probably would do it anyway. As it turns out, it is.
Final Advice
Bob: Let’s go on, at this point, to just what lessons you’ve learned that you 
would like to pass on to other startups who are at that point where you 
began as a startup.
Dharmesh: Sure. A couple of things. Number one is don’t waste time writing 
a business plan. If you have the need to write and say things, write a blog 
instead. The short, mid-, and long term, however you slice it, a blog is going 
to be much more helpful for startups than the business plan is. No one reads 
business plans; someone might actually read your blog. That’s number one. 
Number two is to try to be on the constant lookout for other, like-minded 
people that are practical, that share your passions, and that you would want 
to build something with, whether you do a startup this year with them or 
you do it two or five years from now.
Odds are, If you’re going to do a startup at all, you will likely not do just one. 
You will have a series of startups over your professional career. It’s helpful 
to start thinking about that stuff long term. So if you are a young entrepreneur, 
you’re still in school, start having conversations with other entrepreneurial folks 
that are in your class, start to get to know them. It’s a great environment.
Anytime you have an opportunity to be in and around other entrepreneurs, 
A, you’ll have much better times with those people anyway because they 
have shared interests. But, B, those are the people you’ll likely start companies 
with or be involved in projects of some sort.
Third would be, don’t automatically jump to the conclusion that you need to 
raise capital to do a startup. Especially for software startups, it doesn’t take 
that much money. Most people overestimate the value of raising venture 
capital, and you can always do that later if things are successful. Don’t waste 
your time raising capital too early. You’re better off solving the customer’s 
problem than the investor’s problem.
Work on the actual product, toil away at it, get something semiworking, get 
it—and I’ll close with this—get something out there into real people’s hands 
as early as possible. If by the time you launch your software product as a startup, 
if you’re not completely embarrassed by it, you waited too long. The winners 
tend to release it very, very early and then iterate it very, very quickly.

Eric Sink, Founder/Ceo, SourceGear
In some ways, Eric Sink’s to blame for the microISV arc of my life over 
the years since I read his “Exploring Micro-ISVs” post in September 2004 
(http://www.ericsink.com/bos/Micro_ISV.html). He coined the term, 
and he breathed life into the idea that a single-person, self-funded software 
company was something doable.
Although Eric’s microISV experiment, Winnable Solitaire, was a bust, it was 
probably because he was putting too much time into his “day job” as founder 
and CEO of SourceGear, a software company filling a need left unfulfilled by 
Microsoft (Figure 9-3).
Figure 9-3. SourceGear
Back in the late 1990s, working with Microsoft’s version control software, 
SourceSafe, was a major exercise in frustration. SourceGear’s first product 
was SourceOffSite, which for the first time gave offsite developers access to 
SourceSafe via the Internet.

  Six Wise People
354
Year after year, Microsoft’s myopia continued when it came to the critical 
need of version control software, and SourceGear grew: improving 
SourceOffSite, then taking on the near-senile SourceSafe with Vault, source 
control done right for Windows, and then adding Fortress, a cross-platform 
application lifecycle management solution for small and medium-size developer 
teams. Along the way, Eric collected his essays and blog posts into Eric Sink 
on the Business of Software (Apress, 2006), a book you most definitely should buy.
Eric and SourceGear also are the case that disproves the dictum that you 
absolutely, positively have to live in Silicon Valley if you’re going to succeed: 
Eric went to college at the University of Illinois, Urbana-Champaign, where 
he headed up the team that created what was to become Microsoft’s 
Internet Explorer. SourceGear’s offices are located nearby.
Going Against Microsoft—and Winning
Bob: Maybe we should start with where SourceGear is these days in terms 
of size and number of employees, that sort of thing.
Eric: Sure. I think our employee count is 26 or 27. It bounces around a little 
bit.
Bob: OK. And SourceGear started how many years ago?
Eric: 12.
Bob: That is pretty impressive, for anybody in this business to be able to get 
that big in that period of time. Maybe the question to ask overall here is how 
you did it. Because SourceGear got its start with going against the largest 
software company in the world, Microsoft. How did you manage to make 
this happen?
Eric: Well, to be fair, I should point out that we did a fair amount of consulting 
work in our early days to keep the bills paid. And we gave that up right around 
2000, I believe it was. There was a bit of a recession or at least a tech pull-
back in 2000 and 2001. We stopped the consulting at that point and focused 
just on our products. But for probably the first four years we were doing a 
lot of rent-a-brain type of work just to keep the cash flow going.
And then as far as SourceOffSite, we’ve been shipping that product for over 
10 years now. In fact, we’re preparing another release even now. That’s just 
a story of plugging a hole that a big player didn’t fill. We thought that product 
was probably dead the day we shipped it. And there is still, to this day, no 
product at SourceGear has made more aggregate revenue than SourceOffSite.
Bob: So it was a gamble.
Eric: Yes.
Bob: Because, at anytime, Microsoft could just have added the feature you 
have in SourceOffSite to their offering, and that would have been that.
Eric: That’s right.
Bob: How do you live with that type of uncertainty?

  Six Wise People
355
Eric: There were a lot of times we didn’t. We didn’t live with it well. We 
learned a lesson here along the way that I think is very important. When we 
first shipped, like I said, we thought we had a two-year window right off the 
bat. And over time that window just kept looking longer and longer. And 
now what’s happened is that Microsoft has added those features to SourceSafe 
and they’ve discontinued SourceSafe, and we still sell the thing.
I think one of the things that we’ve learned is that a product has a certain life 
cycle to it. If it’s a successful product, it’s going to run for quite a few years. 
The way I think I’m starting to explain it these days is that a lot of the revenue 
potential of your product is going to start happening right about the time the 
developers lose interest in it. [laughter]
Bob: Oh, that’s cruel.
Eric: Well, it’s true. It’s the latter half of a product’s life that makes so much 
money.
Bob: And maybe that’s what startups need to be thinking about: It’s not just 
about getting to 1.0 and getting it out the door. That’s only the beginning of 
the story.
Eric: That’s right.
What Comes After 1.0?
Bob: If that’s the beginning of the story, what would you say is the continu-
ation of that? In other words, once you got SourceOffSite out the door and 
you thought you had a two-year window, you started generating revenue. 
What was the next priority? Was it the product or building the team or finding 
new ways of selling it? What were the things you went for after you started 
up business?
Eric: Once we got SourceOffSite out the door and we thought it was going 
to die soon after we released it, I spent probably my time from 1998 until 
2002—about four years there—trying to figure out what our next product 
was. I tried several things. I can think of three or four products I created there 
that never made it to market. We finally ended up trying to choose something 
that was a bit more of a follow-on to SourceOffSite, something that was a 
bit more evolutionary than revolutionary. But, yeah, that was what we did: 
what’s our next product? To go on and try to figure that out.
Bob: Why do you think that was? Was it that it wasn’t obvious, or the thing 
that you wanted to do didn’t really have that much potential commercially?
Eric: I think a lot of it was just me being a bonehead. [laughter]
The fact is, figuring out products is hard enough. And then what happens is 
you start getting advice from all sorts of people whose situation is different 
than yours. The recipes for failure in a software startup far outnumber the 
recipes for success. And a lot of the recipes for failure looked exactly like 
really great ideas. For example, say your recipe is “Do what PayPal did.” Well, 
that’s only going to work once. Or suppose your recipe is “Whatever Microsoft 
is doing these days, I’m going to follow them and do something very similar.”

  Six Wise People
356
Well, the fact is you’re different, your situation is different. A lot of business 
advice actually flying around these days is “Hey, here’s what I learned at IBM; 
you can apply this to your startup.” But the fact is you can’t; it doesn’t apply.
Bob: Is it more a case of the lessons from large corporations don’t apply 
when you get down to a small software company? Or is it that plus things 
have changed since, let’s say, the mid-1990s to now in terms of what works 
or doesn’t work?
Eric: I think there’s some of both. Certainly things have changed. A lot of 
money these days can be made using web applications, which in 1992 didn’t 
exist. So obviously things have changed. But at the same time—and this is a 
piece of good faith that I happen to think is true, regardless of whether we’re 
talking about software or restaurants—if you look at the very large players 
and do what they do, you’re likely to fail in a startup. In fact, your best recipe 
is to look at the very large players and do the opposite of what they do.
Bob: Just because you’re not them, and by imitating them you are setting 
yourself up to fail?
Eric: That’s right.
Being the Guy Who Signs the Checks
Bob: Let’s turn to management for a second, because while you may have 
been a project manager in a large corporation, now you’re the guy writing 
the paychecks. What does that feel like, and how is that different?
Eric: Well, it’s been very different. I think what helps me quite a bit is that I 
don’t think I was a very good project manager in a large corporation. 
[laughs] I was just a lot more suited to being an entrepreneur. I didn’t know 
that until I tried it. But when I sort of got on my own, I realized I’m a little 
bit of a jack-of-all-trades. I like to tell people sometimes that I’m a little bit 
good at everything and not really, really good at anything. And that’s just the 
way I’m wired, and it makes me a pretty decent entrepreneur.
But I don’t think a lot of people that worked with me as a project manager 
in my prior life would say that I was the best project manager they ever had.
Bob: Well, how about the CEO now of SourceGear? In other words, what 
sort of lessons have you learned as the executive, as the guy in charge, that 
you just didn’t even suspect existed when you started this out?
Eric: I would say the number one lesson I’ve learned, or the number one 
thing that has prevented me from destroying my own company, is that you 
have to be self-aware about your limitations. You’ve got to know what you’re 
not good at and make sure that there are people around you who are good 
at those things so that they can get them done. A lot of CEOs that I see are 
such control freaks that they can’t allow somebody who complements them, 
who basically helps with their weaknesses, they can’t allow that person to 
grow and gain influence in the company because they feel threatened by it. 
That’s the guaranteed way to make sure your company never grows and, in 
fact, probably shrinks. You’ve got to make sure things get done well, even if 
you can’t do them.

Bob: We’re talking about very common human failings or insecurities or 
whatever. How do you get over that fear? How did you get over that fear?
Eric: That’s a really good question. I think by the time I went out on my own 
I had lost it. If I had gone out earlier, I might have self-destructed in that way. 
This is a fear that you probably get over by learning from a mentor. I’ll say it 
that way. That’s one of the biggest problems with entrepreneurship, that 
you lost your mentor. You don’t have anybody any more.
Bob: Class adjourned?
Eric: Well, kind of. I mean, I spent five years at Spyglass working with a manager 
who taught me so much. I can’t imagine that I would have succeeded without 
those lessons.
Bob: So there is a place in the career path of a startup for doing the corpo-
rate thing.
Eric: Oh, yeah. I don’t know if it’s the corporate thing. The way I think of it 
is like this. I live and work here in Champaign, Illinois, where the University 
of Illinois is nearby. A lot of the students these days are going straight out on 
their own, starting a company right out of college. I did the five or six years 
working for somebody else first. And when I look at those students, I think, 
they’re going to screw something up. Because I did, I just happened to screw 
stuff up as an employee instead of as a boss.
I have a strange path as an entrepreneur: I’ve never run a company that’s 
gone out of business, because I’ve only run one.
Bob: OK.
Eric: I mean, most serial entrepreneurs fail three times before they succeed. 
I don’t know Jim Clark’s background. He’s a legend in Silicon Valley for his 
successes, but I bet you there are three failures back there somewhere. And 
these students that are starting right out of college? They’re going to fail, 
they’re going to screw something up. I would have if I’d started out of college. 
You’ve got to learn this stuff. But what I wonder about these kids is, will they 
learn better lessons than I did by failing on their own? Or would they be 
better off working for a great mentor for five years and then going out? I 
don’t know. It’s a tough call.
Who Do You Hire?
Bob: Probably one of those case-by-case ones. But let me ask you about 
part of that. One is, what do you look for from your new hires? And two, 
being in Champaign, Illinois—which is not exactly Silicon Valley—how do 
you attract people out to the flyover country there?
Eric: [laughs] Flyover country, that’s great. OK, the first question, what do 
I look for in new hires? Hiring developers, to me, is getting simpler and simpler 
all the time. I don’t know why. I care about a lot of things, looking at a résumé. 
But one of the things that I care about most is, I think almost every coder 
that we ever hired that did well was somebody who at some point in his life 
has written code as a hobby. It’s one of the first things I look at.
Bob: Really? That’s sort of counterintuitive. What’s the angle there?

  Six Wise People
358
Eric: The angle is that people who are good at writing code love doing it, so 
much so that they do it whether they get paid or not. Everyone wants to talk 
about the internship they did at Intel between their sophomore and junior 
years. I’m like, fine, that’s impressive. But at the same time, when I see a résumé 
that has all that kind of stuff, but they never wrote a game during college, 
they never worked on an Open Source project, all they did is they went to 
classes, they did their machine problems, and then they got an internship. 
That kind of spooks me. Not a lot of really great developers follow that path.
Bob: So they really have to love coding. They really have to love the activity 
of designing software.
Eric: I don’t know if I’d phrase it as they have to, but I’ll just say it this way: 
I look at those two résumés as very, very different. There’s always excep-
tions, but most of the time the résumé of the guy who loves coding so much 
that he or she does it on their own, that résumé attracts me more.
Bob: OK. How about noncoders? I presume out of 27 employees you’ve 
got now, there’s probably some salespeople.
Eric: Yep.
Bob: Does this mean you’re looking for the same attribute in them, or is it 
a different set of attributes when you’re talking about nonprogrammers?
Eric: Oh, it’s all different. This is another lesson I’ve learned, that hiring 
noncoders is very different from hiring coders. I came out of my previous 
work experience with pretty decent skills at hiring coders, but not such 
good skills at hiring and working with noncoders. I’ve had to learn that along 
the way. I don’t know, I suppose my staff could tell you if you if I’ve ever 
learned anything at all, but I think I’ve gotten better at this over the years. 
But, yeah, it’s very different. And if you approach it the same way you do as 
when you’re hiring geeks, things go bad.
Bob: OK. Any suggestions when hiring noncoders?
Eric: The main suggestion would be, first of all, your noncoders will not 
succeed unless all the geeks in the company respect what they do, including 
you. It’s real easy for a software company, especially a company that was 
founded by a geek like me, it’s really easy for that to turn into a developer-
centric company. And that’s not a bad thing. But if that takes the next step, 
and now it’s so developer-centric and anybody who’s not a developer can’t 
be recognized for making valuable contributions to the company, then that’s 
a really bad thing. That’s the first thing you’ve got to get past if you’re going 
to hire, especially, sales and marketing workers. Most developers think most 
sales and marketing people are idiots. That doesn’t work.
Bob: One of the things that traditional business management obsesses 
about is leadership, with a capital “L.”
Eric: Right.

  Six Wise People
359
Bob: How do you lead your company? How do you get people to do things 
when you tell them to do them? Is it the way you tell them? Is it just that they 
know that they’re supposed to do it, you’ve picked someone that works that 
way? That’s like the day-to-day level. But then way above that is how do you 
lead your company when you’re the guy that’s got to be thinking about “Where 
do we go in three years?”
Eric: First of all, I’m going to quibble a little bit with you, because that’s part 
of my answer. You asked, “How do you lead?” And then you said, “How you 
get people to do things?” And I think getting people to do things is the opposite 
of leadership. [laughter] I think that’s management.
Bob: OK. Explain that. I don’t get that.
Eric: I’m quibbling a little bit. I think of it this way: Somebody very early on 
taught me that the only true test of leadership is to look behind you and see 
if anybody is following. That’s it. There really isn’t anything else to leadership. 
Management is about keeping an eye on what people are doing and making 
sure they’re doing the right things and things like that. I’ve never really believed 
that I’m a good manager; I’m probably not. But when it comes to leadership, 
leadership is relatively simple. You said, “How do I make sure that people 
are going the right place over three years?” I go there first. And if I’m going 
the right place, people follow me. That’s leadership.
Bob: OK, so one thing I should learn and other people who want to be startups 
need to learn is that there is a difference between management and leader-
ship. And your model for leadership is: you go there first, other people follow 
if you are doing the right thing. How about management? I guess I’m used 
to the typical hierarchies you see in large companies, which probably most 
developers are used to. It all flows up to the top and flows down from the 
top and it’s hierarchical. How do you manage, then, a small group of people like 
those involved in a startup?
Eric: Well, I’m not saying there is no management. I mean there has got to 
be a certain amount of structure but, in many companies, far less structure 
than you think. So, I mean my approach to running a company would never 
work if SourceGear got to 250 people or, more to the point, if and when 
SourceGear gets to 250 people, I’ll have been fired and that’s fine. [laughs] 
I’m OK with that. But at 25 people, managing a company is great. What you 
do is you start with the assumption that most people will make the right 
decisions if they have all the information they need. So you give people lots 
of freedom, you give people lots of information, and all the right things happen.
Along the way, what you will find is that you picked up some people from big 
companies who don’t like working that way. They want more structure. They 
want the comfort of knowing that nobody is going to step on their job descrip-
tion. And they have a little fence around their area and they don’t go outside 
it and they don’t want anybody coming inside it. And you just get rid of all 
those people.

And Who Do You Fire?
Bob: [laughs] OK, we solve the problem by shooting the people with the 
problem. Hey, that works.
Eric: It’s callous, but there is a certain truth to that.
Bob: Let me ask you about callous for a second. I mean, OK, you’ve got 
27 people right now. You must have fired at least some people during your 
career. First off, how hard is it? Second, do you get over it? Because you’ve 
just shown somebody the door, and, having been shown the door enough 
times, I know it’s not a pleasant experience.
Eric: [laughs] Certainly, for me, parting ways with an employee under 
almost any circumstances is one of the worst parts of the job. I speak sort 
of jokingly about it, but the fact is, when it’s happening, I’m nowhere near as 
heartless as I like to joke about. It’s really hard and there have been very few 
cases that weren’t, but every case is unique. I’m actually not sure that I have 
ever fired somebody for the joke I just made, because we tend to filter out 
those people before they ever get hired. But at the same time, yeah, a 
company that’s 12 years old has had to let some people go.
And you asked: Do I ever get over it? Well, yeah, mostly. But I know some 
guys that can be a little colder and more methodical about this kind of thing, 
and I’ve always sort of envied them for that. But at the same time, it is who 
I am, so I don’t want to change that.
Lessons Learned
Bob: OK. Let’s wrap up here with the big lessons learned that you would 
like to pass on to other people who are founding startups. Let’s start with 
product development. People get very, very focused on getting that 1.0 out 
the door. What would you advise them in general about the development of 
their product?
Eric: About the development of their products?
Bob: Past 1.0.
Eric: I would actually have to start with pre-1.0 because the biggest thing 
determining the success of your product is, first of all, to make sure you are 
building the right thing. There is a lot I can say about that, but you said we 
are wrapping up so I will just say this.
Bob: No, go ahead, please.
Eric: Well, people get so hung up on competition pre-1.0. When they decide 
what product to build, most entrepreneurs go about the competition discus-
sion all wrong. What you need to do is, you have to find something that has 
competition, which is exactly what entrepreneurs tend to avoid. They think, 
“Oh, I can’t do that, there is a competitor.” You have to find something where 
you will have competition, and you have to find something where you have 
the right size of competition. So, I mean a classic mistake here is going after 
this huge market, but I know one entrepreneur who will not go after any

  Six Wise People
361
market above a certain size. And I think that’s incredibly smart. He targets 
niche markets that are too small for the big players to go after and more 
than big enough to buy himself a Ferrari. So it’s a wonderful approach to 
competition, and I think most entrepreneurs don’t do that.
And then you said post-1.0: Once the product is shipping, the number one 
mistake is not sticking with it, because the fact is if you pick the right market 
and you build your product and you ship your 1.0, it is almost certainly going 
to disappoint you in sales. 1.0 products don’t sell very well. You’ve got to 
stick with it.
And unless you get new information, once you’ve picked your product and 
you know it is right, stick with it until 3.0 before you start thinking about 
bailing out on that. I have made that mistake too.
Bob: How about lessons learned in terms of people. Just working with and 
having people work for you and just the people aspect of the startup process?
Eric: Oh, man, everything I know about managing people won’t take very 
real long I guess. Lessons learned from people: I think that working with people 
is one of the toughest parts of the whole game, because I think people natu-
rally tend to have conflict, different people handle conflict in different ways, 
some people avoid it by nature, some people thrive on it. All I can say, I 
suppose, is that this is an area that requires a ton of attention, and I think it’s 
one of the easiest ways to fail. I actually am a big believer in taking the time 
to understand how to work in relationships just as well as you understand 
how to work on code.
So if for you that means getting some consulting, that means—it is radical to 
suggest it—but maybe it means that you and your business partner need to 
see a therapist together so that you can communicate together. I don’t know. 
But these things are just of critical importance. And, whatever it means for 
you, figure out how to work with the people around you effectively and that 
will pay off some pretty big dividends.
Bob: OK. Any final advice for an experienced developer who is thinking 
about going out there and making a startup?
Eric: Final advice for an experienced developer thinking about a startup? I 
have said this before, so it may be repetition, but ask yourself lots of ques-
tions about whether you are the right kind of person to be an entrepreneur. 
Being an experienced developer is probably not enough, and I don’t want to 
tell anybody don’t go after your dreams, it’s not my place. But at the same 
time, I don’t want to see anybody fail either. So ask yourself and ask the 
people around you to what extent am I sort of a jack-of-all-trades, because 
I really do think that’s one of the critical things for startup success. When 
you go out on your own, you are going to be wearing—well, Bob, I think you 
even say this—you are going to be wearing, what, 47 hats?
Bob: There you go.

  Six Wise People

Eric: And you’re going to be doing so many different things. You may look 
at it and think—Wow! I’m a coder, I can do this. But you’ve got 46 other 
things you are going to be doing besides being a software developer. And 
those things and your ability to do them competently, if not well, are really 
going to be the things that determine your success. So make sure that you 
go into that with your eyes open.
Joel Spolsky, CEO and Cofounder, Fog Creek Software
What do you say about Joel Spolsky (Figure 9-4), a guy who’s, on one hand, 
the founder of a very successful software company and, on the other, prob-
ably the most read programmer on the net today. Simple: he’s smart—really 
smart.
He’s smart enough, as a Microsoft program manager, to write the spec for 
Excel’s Visual Basic for Applications, he’s smart enough to build a developer-
centric company that continues to grow market share against far larger 
competitors, and he’s smart enough to write about 1,100 articles for his blog, 
Joel on Software (http://www.joelonsoftware.com), that are so awesomely 
good they’ve become four excellent books you should read, and to speak at 
numerous tech conferences and cohost the Business of Software Conference 
(http://www.businessofsoftware.org).
Figure 9-4. Joel Spolsky
First and foremost, Joel’s a developer who believes very strongly that developing 
great software is what a software company like Fog Creek Software (http://
fogcreek.com) is all about and what a startup like yours should be about.

The CEO Mindset
Bob: I’m interested in the distance between being a really good developer 
and being the founder of a “going, actually making money” type of startup 
and in what happens after that. Maybe the place to start is the “CEO mindset” 
for a small software company. What do you think that mindset should be?
Joel: Oh, that’s a good question, the “‘CEO mindset.” There are so many 
things. First of all, you need to have an entrepreneurial, businesslike approach to 
things. You know what I mean? And by that I mean that at some point the goal 
has to be to make money, if only to survive.
And no matter how much you’ve told yourself that you’re going to be a cool, 
enlightened company and you’re going to be Open Source, and you’ve got 
this long list of Not Evil plans that you plan to do—if ultimately you’re not 
concentrating on the goal of making as much money as possible, then the 
business is not really going to be viable for very long.
Bob: OK. So one is keeping an eye on the bottom line?
Joel: Yeah, and that’s actually hard for developers, because a lot of times 
developers launch a startup because they were sick and tired of the bean-
counter accountants at their previous company, who were always doing 
things that appeared evil from a developer perspective, like rushing out 
buggy software or promising customers things that didn’t exist or whatever 
evil things they may have done.
And maybe they’ve gone out as a reaction against that and they say, “We’re 
not going to do that. We’re going to be cool. We’re going to be honest. We’re 
going to be ethical. We’re going to be blah, blah, blah. And we’re going to have 
the finest-quality code without regard to how much it costs to get there, or 
whatever.” And that’s a great place to start from. On the other hand, if your 
mindset is not one of making money and paying attention to the bottom line, 
then you’re not really going to be successful. You can’t be successful.
Bob: So if job #1 is paying attention to the bottom line because you’re the 
CEO, was job #2 the people that you hire?
Joel: Yeah—well, that’s another thing. They’re all job #1, aren’t they? It 
depends on where you’re at. If you’re just starting with a couple of friends, 
hiring people is probably not yet a concern. You probably don’t have that 
concern until you’ve gotten to the point at which you can pay people.
Most people start with a couple of friends. Unless you’ve actually either 
raised venture capital or have gotten to $30,000 to $40,000 in revenue a 
month, you’re probably not hiring people yet; that’s probably not your issue. 
But when you do get to that point, then your number one concern does 
become, of course, hiring people and creating talent and creating the team 
that’s going to be able to create the great software.

Rock-Star Hires
Bob: Well, when you hire that first person, what should a startup be looking 
for in terms of programming talent? I think there is a difference between 
programmers and nonprogrammers. But just on the programmer side, what 
should you be looking for?
Joel: You’re looking for the programmers that are 10 times as productive as 
the average programmer. You’re looking for very, very high productivity. 
The only cost-efficient way to hire programmers as a startup is to get the 
ones that really accomplish massive amounts of stuff.
And there are, obviously, some other issues. Many of the people reading this 
will say: “Oh, well, you just want them to rush and write bad code? You know, 
the kind that just spews out fast and sloppy code.” I never said that. I said 
there are programmers who create good-quality, debugged code at 10 times 
the rate of other programmers. In fact, the fast ones usually do better code 
than the slow ones and usually produce better code. So I’m not saying that.
Another thing, I sometimes use the expression rock-star developers to refer 
to these very, very special, highly talented developers who work so far above 
and beyond the average.
Bob: Sure.
Joel: They’re just so much better than the run-of-the-mill developer that 
they seem like rock stars. And I often get the criticism: “You don’t want 
rock stars because they’re egotistical, self-centered, non-team players.” And 
I’ve never said any of that.
Bob: I would have said “expensive” as the first comment.
Joel: No. I haven’t found that you pay extra—a little bit, but not much—maybe 
20% more expensive. But you’re getting 10 times as much code out of them. So 
it’s really the only economical way to hire programmers, if you ask me.
Bob: OK. How about that first nonprogrammer hire?
Joel: It depends. Our first nonprogrammer hire at Fog Creek was somebody 
who did customer service. And we carved out a position for this person as 
everything from customer service to sales to tech support. And we even said 
system administration, office management, why don’t you do all kinds of fun 
stuff? And it turned out the person we hired was more inclined to customer 
service and inside sales, and so that’s what he did, and a little bit of coding 
actually.
I guess it depends on who you start with, but we started with two devel-
opers. To me, the choice was: I’m a pretty good developer, and Michael’s a 
really good developer, and we can write great code. And to find someone 
with our skills is a lot harder than finding somebody who can take all the 
nonprogramming tasks off our plate so that we have more time to program.
Bob: So really, when you’re starting as two developers who are the founders, 
what you’re looking for is somebody to complement that in nonprogram-
ming areas.

  Six Wise People
365
Joel: Yeah.
Bob: Hiring another developer isn’t what you necessarily need at that point.
Joel: Right. And once we had all of the nondevelopment tasks basically taken 
care of, then we started hiring additional developers. Now, not every company 
is going to be in the same position. You might have a company that’s in the 
position where it was created by salespeople and they’ve somehow outsourced 
the creation of the first version of the software. I’ve actually seen a lot of 
that, where a startup is a couple of business guys that have no idea and don’t 
know anything about technology.
They just have an idea. They put it up on one of these web sites where you 
get people to bid on it, and they’ve got some first version of the code that 
they’re now selling. They’re pretty good at the sales cycle, but they need a 
second version, and they need to develop their own in-house development 
team or they’re not going anywhere. And so, at that point, they start looking 
for the more senior developers; maybe that would be a good first hire for 
that kind of company.
Course Adjustments and Major Releases
Bob: OK. Let’s talk a minute about product development, and I guess product 
outcomes are part of that. Fog Creek’s first product was CityDesk.
Joel: Yes.
Bob: And it met with some success, but not anything like what FogBugz has 
met with, which is really your flagship product.
Joel: Right.
Bob: I guess there are two questions here: One, is it just something that 
founders should expect to happen, that their first product is not going to be 
the one that makes the company?
Joel: Technically speaking, we did launch FogBugz first, although CityDesk 
came shortly thereafter. But we really did expect CityDesk to be the main 
product. I can give you a good analysis about why certain things failed and 
certain things succeeded in the market. But the truth is that you can’t know 
in advance exactly which products are going to be successful and which prod-
ucts are going to fail. You could try to predict that, but sometimes you just 
get surprised. And so I think that you have to go in with the assumption you’re 
going to tweak and adjust course a couple of times.
Bob: OK.
Joel: A lot of the biggest successful companies became successful with their 
second or third product. Sometimes they never even managed to launch the 
first product. Blogger was the product of Evan Williams and his friends at a 
company called Pyra Labs. They were doing some kind of project manage-
ment thing—I don’t know what it was they were trying to build. Blogger was 
an internal tool that they built for—I don’t know what. Then they suddenly 
made that available, and that obviously became the gigantic hit that Blogger was.
Bob: How do you direct the growth of the product? FogBugz is now on 
version 6.0.

  Six Wise People
366
Joel: Yep.
Bob: How do you decide, “OK, we’re going to work on this for this next 
major release, then we’re going to hold on that until maybe two releases 
down.” Or do you think that way?
Joel: When we’re ready to start a new release, we first come up with sort 
of a vision for the release that describes what we want to be able to demo 
when we go out to visit our customers to demo the new version and explain 
what they’re going to get.
The idea for a vision may vary from release to release. So in previous releases, 
one of our visions was to use AJAX to make the interface faster. That turned 
out to be useful but did not increase our sales, because I guess it was not a 
differentiating factor in the sales process. But anyway that was the FogBugz 5.0 
vision. FogBugz 6.0 had a whole list of things.
FogBugz 7.0, for example, which is coming up [as of April 2009] also has a 
vision that states the kinds of things that we want to be in there and explicitly 
the kind of things that won’t be in there, that won’t be in that release. Once 
you have that vision, which can be something fairly simple, it can be just a list.
I remember at Microsoft, the Windows 95 vision was a list of five things that 
Windows 95 was going to have, that Windows 3.x did not have. It was long 
file names, it was the ability to put files on the desktop, they were really just 
plug-and-play. There was just a list of about five specific things.
When you look at it, that’s really all that it was in Windows 95, and yet it 
was a gigantic upgrade. Once you have that vision statement, then you go 
through the list of everything everybody has ever imagined that they wanted 
to do and you decide whether it’s in or out. And you get your initial list and 
you go through and prioritize and you decide what the highest-priority features 
are that you’re going to do, that you can get done within a reasonable amount 
of time.
Bob: What’s the process for seeing this vision? Do you go off by yourself, 
or do you have a company retreat? How does collaborative versus, I guess 
you call it, leadership works for you? What’s the style there?
Joel: It strikes me as kind of a weird question, because we’re talking about 
this in the abstract. In the abstract, I can give you a good abstract answer. 
For anybody that is actually product managing a product, meaning they have 
a product in the marketplace, they’re responsible for figuring out how the 
product has to change to make more money in the marketplace.
I call them a product manager, and for anybody who is shepherding a product in 
the marketplace that way it is almost inconceivable that he wouldn’t already 
have a pretty clear consensus in the head about what they really need to do 
next. It’s those things that everybody raises their hands in those demos and 
says, “Can you do this?” And you have to say, “No.”

  Six Wise People
367
You know what those things are, and everybody does for their product, 
everybody knows. It would be very surprising if there was somebody that 
was responsible for products that didn’t have a clear idea as to what was 
causing you to lose sales. I’ve always known what those things are.
I’m sure that when you have a very mature product, like, let’s say, the Microsoft 
Office team at Microsoft. There is nothing; they already have every possible 
feature. I’m sure that they have a lot of trouble figuring out whether they’re 
going to put in the dancing paper clip or take out the dancing paper clip or 
rearrange all the toolbars to have different-sized tools or what they’re going 
to do today. They’ve just got to make stuff up. I don’t know what they should 
do. Maybe they should stop spending so much money on developing a product 
that already has 100% market share.
The other possibility is that the product is so immature or so nonexistent 
and has so few customers that you can’t even decide what to build. That’s 
an earlier-stage problem. But as to the problem of to how to get the product 
from version n.0 to version n.1 or n + 1, the answer is something that will 
be obvious to you when you’ve had 10 conversations with customers. There 
will be two things that came up with every single one of those customers who 
decided not to buy your product. You’ll implement those two things, and then 
you’ll discover another 10 things that you keep hearing from customers.
Bob: So is the person in charge of the startup supposed to be, more than 
anything else, the person who listens to the customers, or is that something 
that everybody is doing?
Joel: Everybody can do that; it depends on the size of the company. Here at 
Fog Creek it’s the program manager’s job to do that. There’s a particular 
title of the person who is responsible for actually doing that. It’s OK on a 
larger team for there to be a bunch of developers.
If you have a developer who’s a really good coder and does not particularly 
care to talk to customer service and is perfectly happy to do what he’s told, 
then it’s OK to let him be a heads-down coder and let other people be in 
charge of making sure that what the coder is doing is appropriate to what 
the customer’s needs are.
But they do have to be a bunch of people that have a pretty clear awareness, and 
it may be customer service people, it may be salespeople, it may be manage-
ment, pretty much anybody that has outside customer contact. It’s kind of 
odd to me, if you were to go right now and do a Twitter search for the keyword 
“FogBugz” and look at the cases where people are actually complaining or 
they’re saying, “I don’t want FogBugz because . . .” you’ll discover that the 
things that are most repeated in that search, the things that come up the 
most frequently, are going to be in FogBugz 7.

Speaking of Twitter
Bob: Speaking of Twitter, I can remember not so long ago when you were 
pretty dismissive about the whole idea of Twitter, because it’s a time waster, 
people talking about what they had for breakfast. Yet now you’ve got 
8,000 followers. What happened there, Joel?
Joel: I’m perfectly willing to try things out; I don’t have to be closed-minded. 
I understand the value of Twitter as a customer service tool, for example. 
I’m actually kind of tempted to go take that FogBugz search that I talked 
about and put it up on a big 50-inch plasma screen TV in the middle of the 
office so that everybody can see what people are saying about FogBugz. Not 
that they couldn’t see it on their desk, anyway, but just to show that what 
people are saying about FogBugz is important to management and therefore 
we put up on the big screen so that you can walk by and see it.
That said, despite the usefulness of Twitter as a technique for listening to 
and reaching customers, I think the medium in general is a version of CB 
radio without conversations. It’s like CB radio that’s broadcast only. It drives 
me crazy. I can’t stand it. [laughter]
Bob: Bottom line is you use it but you can’t stand it.
Joel: I use it to a limited extent. Obviously lots of people use Twitter in 
different ways. But such a large part of it is this strange feeling that we are 
getting closer and closer to a world . . . we’re asymptotically approaching a 
world in which people are continually expressing their opinions and their 
judgments about everything they see, do, eat, smell, and excrete—continu-
ally, all day long—and nobody has to listen.
It’s a write-only medium, where everybody is just blathering about “I saw 
this movie and I liked it. I saw this movie and I didn’t like it. I had a waiter 
and he was an idiot. I had a waiter and he was bad. I had this waiter and he 
was good. I had this experience.” You’re just in a constant state of being in 
judgment on the world around you and the sort of sense of self. Because 
you’ve got to squeeze everything into 140 characters, you’re not allowed to 
justify any of these opinions.
Because you’re allowed to talk to people that you’re not listening to, you’re 
in this funny state of just kind of spewing these not-backed-up opinions. I 
recognize that other things happen on Twitter besides this, but the general 
feel of just hanging out on Twitter and listening and broadcasting for a while 
is—at some point it feels to me like an atomizing, socially destructive service.
Bob: Well, OK. Since you don’t have much of an opinion about Twitter . . . 
[laughter] Let me ask you what you think of the rest of the social media out 
there? I’m just going to lump them together. There’s everything from Friend-
Feed to Facebook to Ning Networks to all that.
Joel: Yeah.

  Six Wise People
369
Bob: Some people look at this stuff and say, “This is the new way that markets 
get found and talk to and conversed with.” Do you buy into that, or do you 
not think that’s what actually works, when you look at your sales numbers?
Joel: Are people on FriendFeed discussing products that they wish they could 
buy, and then suddenly a new product erupts? I don’t get it. It actually strikes 
me that very few of the people on social networks are consumers. They’re not 
using them to consume more stuff. Right? They’re not on Twitter because they 
want to buy something or have something sold to them or sell something to 
other people. And if they are on Twitter because they’re trying to sell some-
thing to other people, they’re going to be . . .
Bob: . . . shot very fast.
Joel: Not very successful. Twitter is used for people to express their opinion 
about everything, endlessly, continually, and perpetually, without any kind of 
feedback. It happens to be a fairly useful way to find customers who have 
issues that you can fix, so there’s a specific customer service role you can do.
Bob: OK.
Joel: And it’s not a terrible way to find out about what features people want. 
But that whole 140-character limitation, to me . . .
Do you remember that short story? I wish I could remember who wrote it 
. . . was it Ray Bradbury? It wasn’t Ray Bradbury. It’s a science fiction story 
about a future world in which everybody is handicapped to the point of 
equality that the people who happen to be good at athletics have weights put 
on their legs so that they can’t compete, and the people who are particularly 
smart or good at math have to wear these headphones that play loud noises 
that distract them from concentrating. It’s Harrison Bergeron, by Kurt Vonnegut.
How Fog Creek Markets
Bob: How does Fog Creek sell—or maybe market is actually the word—
FogBugz? What does the driving there? If it’s not social media, what works 
for you guys?
Joel: Right. There’s a bunch of stuff that works. We obviously started through 
my own blog, Joel on Software, and a part of that was establishing credibility 
among our exact target audience. My own personal authority is being some-
body who writes things that make sense about the software development 
process, which made people think: “You know, it is worth checking out 
FogBugz, at least because Joel has the authority that it’s worth seeing if, maybe, 
that is a valid . . . if the product that he’s come up with in this space can solve 
our problems.” And, indeed, since the product is good, we can then sell to 
them. So the first part, I would say, is almost the appeal to authority, whereas 
the authority was established completely innocently, and independently, 
through Joel on Software.

  Six Wise People
370
Once we had that initial base of audience, there’s always natural growth, as 
the companies that buy FogBugz get larger and the people on teams that use 
FogBugz move around to a new job. And if they ever get to a job that’s not 
using FogBugz—it’s using some other, lesser bug tracker or no bug tracker 
at all—they tend to be our evangelists. And therefore there’s a certain amount 
of spreading, throughout the history of our product, as people move from 
job to job.
And the other marketing thing that we’ve done that was extremely successful 
was that world tour. We actually went to 30 different cities and gave a demo 
of the new version, FogBugz 6.0, which we did a couple of years ago. That 
was unbelievably cost effective. It was absolutely remarkable, the number of 
sales that that generated for a given cost—very, very, worth doing, some-
thing we’ll do again. I think that making the world tour work is predicated 
on having something that people are going to want to come hear. You can’t 
just go to 30 cities and expect people to show up. But they did, since I 
promoted the world tour through my blog, through Joel on Software, and 
to existing FogBugz customers.
Bob: OK.
Joel: So we had enough people come to that that made it pay off.
Bob: So was it a situation where you evangelize to your existing customer 
base and they actually started bringing other people that weren’t customers?
Joel: Yeah. That’s always going to happen, there’s always a lot of that.
But part of it, really, is that we were—I don’t want to say we were really 
lucky, but it wasn’t really by design. But the fact that the web site, Joel on 
Software, had a very large audience meant that we had somebody to sell to 
and somebody that would check out our products.
Now, I’m always very hesitant to give this as advice to other people launching 
startups, in whatever area, because the number of people that are able to 
establish a large audience through blogging, as large an audience as I did, is 
very limited. For every blog the size of Joel on Software, there are a million 
blogs that don’t achieve anything like that kind of critical mass.
Bob: You mentioned earlier the idea of establishing your authority, separate 
from the product. That could be a blog. But that could also be—maybe you 
become the go-to person for a part of the technology that’s related to your 
product, but not directly your product.
Joel: Yeah, and there’s certainly examples of that. But I don’t think it’s the 
most common way in which a company successfully achieves mind share.
It definitely worked for us at Fog Creek, there’s no question. On the other 
hand, I don’t know if I recommend it, because I’ve seen a lot of people try to 
do it and just never really build up a big enough audience or enough authority in 
their field to do it, except maybe in very, very narrow niches.
I guess you have the Gary Vaynerchuk model or something.
Bob: Sure.

  Six Wise People

Joel: And then there’s even the authority translating in a funny way. So you’ve 
got the Donald Trump model, where you’re Donald Trump and you become 
this big celebrity business dude, and you’ve got a big enough audience that 
you can sell them expensive, overpriced condos on the Upper West Side, 
even though that’s unrelated, in a sense.
Bob: Well, you’re trading on the name, if nothing else.
Joel: Right, right. But that’s a very limited approach.
If you look at the successful startups, a lot of them succeed because they 
create something—I don’t know if you’d call it successful yet—but Facebook 
or Twitter or something like that. Create an incredibly viral product that 
happens to hit it out of the park. Sometimes it’s just providing a service that 
is so useful, and so easy to communicate as to why it’s useful, that it’s going 
to take off almost no matter what happens.
And then there are companies that go in there with a product that just needs to 
be forcefully marketed in traditional ways: lots of advertising and about a 
million sales calls.
Bob: So you’re basically of the mind that traditional marketing works today, 
and sometimes that’s what the company should be doing?
Joel: It doesn’t work as much as having a good product that meets needs in 
the marketplace. [laughs] But look Jet Blue, for example. They didn’t have a 
blog. They didn’t have a hot air balloon that everybody talked about. They 
had a service that was a little bit unique, so there was a little bit of conver-
sation around them as a better kind of airline. They had a better product, 
which got people to talk about it. And I think that’s a great shortcut to tradi-
tional marketing. But they also ran advertisements all over the place.
Developers and Methodologies
Bob: All right. Let’s talk about how you get that great product. If you’ve got 
two or three developers today, what should be their guiding software develop-
ment practices to get the job done well? I mean, there are so many different 
methodologies out there and many, many people talk about Agile in many 
different ways, for example. But for a startup, what makes the most sense in 
terms of software development?
Joel: Doing what works. When you say that there all those methodologies 
out there, up to and including the most extreme of the Agile Scrum-like 
methodologies, all of them are designed to get a team of random assorted 
bad programmers up to a minimum level of not-horrible incompetence. 
That’s what methodologies are designed to work with. For the most part 
they are designed as a way of getting consistent performance, albeit horrid 
performance, out of a large group of people. So it is sort of the same way as 
Starbucks is designed to get at least a consistently bad cup of coffee, which 
is not ever horrible but is never good. That is what these methodologies are 
designed to do: take a whole bunch of political science majors that have 
gone into computer programming because it’s the hot thing to do.

  Six Wise People
372
Bob: Hey, I was a political science major! [laughs] But seriously . . . OK, I get 
that. But . . .
Joel: A methodology for a startup is just to be avoided. If you have devel-
opers who can’t figure out for themselves what the right thing to do is or do 
the right thing without being told “We must follow the following method-
ology, and we must have meetings in which we stand, and we must have new 
code released to customers every week,” or every two weeks or every month, 
whatever the methodology dictates that you do instead of just doing what 
makes sense, then you’re already in trouble. You really need very bright, 
self-driven developers who can figure out what to do.
Sometimes the methodology may inspire them to try some techniques that 
may be effective. But to slavishly follow a particular methodology or to even 
think “Hey, we are an extreme programming shop” just means you are making 
decisions about how to do things. You are outsourcing the making of deci-
sions to somebody who has written a book in order to sell consulting gigs 
about programming methodologies.
Bob: So the bottom line is not the quality of the methodology at all, it’s the 
quality of the programmers. The better the programmers are—and they’d 
better be good programmers—the less you need to be told how to do what 
you are doing. Does that make sense?
Joel: Right, right.
Stack Overflow
Bob: In a way, you have just launched, a little while ago, another startup. 
And that’s Stack Overflow (http://stackoverflow.com). Two questions: 
(a) Why did you do it? And (b) what did you learn from doing it?
Joel: Well, I haven’t learned anything yet. [laughs]
Bob: OK.
Joel: I did Stack Overflow because my philosophy for launching a business is 
that when you see an obvious need in the marketplace—something that you 
need and would pay money for—and the need is not being met, then you 
should launch it. That’s a great business opportunity. Thus one reason why 
it’s good to do a startup and be in business is that you discover these needs 
that are not being met in the marketplace.
In the case of Stack Overflow, it was just bizarre to me that you could type 
programming questions into Google, which is otherwise such a great search 
engine, and find such terrible results. It was obvious to me that there was a 
better way of doing this. Maybe there was a certain amount of hubris there, 
but I think we’ve proven it to be the case that there is a better way to do 
this. So that was the motivation in starting it, just knowing there is some-
thing out there that I would pay for. It doesn’t exist. It turns out you don’t 
even have to pay for it. So it’s even better.

  Six Wise People
373
Bob: Well, first off, as far as I know, Stack Overflow is advertising 
supported.
Joel: Yeah.
Bob: Is it making money?
Joel: Yeah. It’s in what I would call the first-stepping-stone path toward 
revenue. That is sort of basic advertising that goes on there. We have a long-
term plan for something that hasn’t launched yet, which we think will also 
bring in more revenue in a way. That is . . . well, it is hard for me to say since 
we are not announcing what it is.
Bob: How many programmers are using Stack Overflow on a day-to-day 
basis now?
Joel: I think we are at about 600,000 page views a day, 250,000 visitors a 
day, on a daily basis.
Bob: OK. That’s pretty substantial. It’s working. That’s the bottom line.
Joel: Yeah, it’s somewhere like 2 million unique visitors a month. And that 
is a very substantial percentage of the working programmers in the world. 
Somewhere I remember a statistic that there are about 4 million working 
programmers in the world. I don’t remember where I heard that. But I feel 
like we are pretty close to getting that kind of thing—it’s only a matter of 
time. The growth rate is ridiculous. It’s doubling every four months.
So we’re only a year off from being something that literally every working 
developer who uses the Internet will at some point encounter, just because 
we come up in searches. It is not because they know about Stack Overflow.
Final Advice?
Bob: OK. I guess the final question would be: What advice would you give 
to a couple of developers who want to start up a company today?
Joel: Boy, I’ve got so many things. I guess my number one piece of advice 
right now—well, I’ve got a lot of things. I can talk about this endlessly. First 
of all, charge more; make your prices higher. People are always afraid to 
charge enough, and this is a problem because they don’t make as much money 
as they could. They always underestimate how much businesses are willing 
to pay for things. If you have been a consumer, it’s easy to understand what 
consumers would pay for things because those are the decisions you’ve 
been making all your life when you decide whether to buy things.
But if you ever start selling to businesses, which is actually where the money 
is, businesses have a very different opinion about what is a reasonable amount 
of money to spend on things.
Bob: OK.

  Six Wise People
374
Joel: So that’s probably my number one advice: You are probably not charging 
enough. I think equally important is to focus on making the product better at 
all times. Don’t waste time with weird marketing deals trying to make some 
kind of affiliate-link programming thing with coupon codes and direct mail, 
trying to figure out basically tricks to try to goose a little bit more revenue 
out of your product. This is not nearly as valuable and not nearly as good a 
use of time as just writing more code to make your product better and to 
make it meet the needs of more people. We’ve always found that the best 
use of our time here is releasing new versions of FogBugz that have more 
features and are more capable.
So far we’ve been talking with software developers who’ve gone down 
the road toward startup-dom, the same road you want to travel. But there 
are other, less obvious challenges on the Underground Railroad that leads 
past your manager’s office and on to freedom. The next interview intro-
duces a non–software developer with important advice to offer you about 
launching your startup.

Why Leave Your Cozy Cubicle?
Bob: Why should people leave the warm, cozy cubicle they’ve been living in 
their entire professional career to launch a startup?
Pamela Slim: In my experience working with a lot of clients, it has to be a 
place where there really is a significant defining moment and a really strong 
feeling that it truly is the right move for them, because of who they are. It 
sounds a little bit “the big picture“ or philosophical, but it’s really true that 
a lot of people do want to do a lot more with their life. They have dreams. 
They have aspirations. You probably find a lot of people you run across in 
your daily life, as I do, people who have just kind of fallen into jobs. They do 
work, and they do a decent job at it, and get a salary, and so forth. But they 
don’t necessarily feel like they’re doing something that really has meaning. 
They don’t enjoy it while they are doing it. They might enjoy the outcome, 
like getting a nice paycheck. There’s nothing at all wrong with that, feeling 
good about earning a living and taking care of yourself or your family.

  Six Wise People
376
But I find that for people who actually make that choice to leave, they have 
some kind of defining moment. For some, it’s a health issue, where they 
realize that they are pushing themselves so hard, to stay in a life that’s really 
not meant for them, that their body just rebels. They get really, really sick, 
and they realize they have to make a change.
For other people, they see the benefit of a future life that’s really different. 
Maybe they meet a friend. Maybe they meet somebody. Maybe they read a 
book. All of a sudden, they get motivated, thinking, “You know what? I think 
I could actually accomplish that.”
The reason, to me, why it needs to be a defining moment is that it is really a 
lot of hard work and effort and energy. All of that. It’s not something you can 
just casually fall into.
That said, that idea of having a safe job in a cube these days is one that’s a bit 
of an oxymoron. Because jobs that all of us thought were a bit untouchable, 
in companies that were untouchable, it’s just been amazing to see what has 
happened.
So I think people have been shaken into a new level of awareness that if 
nothing is safe, then how could they maybe realign their work, maybe in 
steps, to eventually be something that really feels good while they’re doing 
it and also gives them a sense of purpose and meaning.
Bob: Well, a couple of things strike me. First off, yes, life is more than a 
paycheck, or at least it ought to be. There’s a difference between living and 
existing. I think you’re striking at the point that, for some people, creating a 
startup means that they can go, in their own personal development, from 
the existing plane to the living plane, if you will.
Pamela: That’s right, and that’s why, for some people, it really does come 
in many forms. It’s interesting, to me, always to note what that moment is, 
but some people really do get that flash of it. Maybe a friend of theirs that’s 
at a similar age passes away. Or a parent passes away, or, again, it can be a 
whole different variety of things that have that moment happen. It sounds so 
cliché, but it is true that there really is only one life. And when you’re sitting 
every day and spending all of your energy doing something that you truly 
don’t care about, that takes a lot of life energy just to keep you going, just to 
force yourself to stay motivated and keep a smile on your face. Boy, I think 
there’s a lot more to life than that.
Bob: This may sound trite, but as I’ve gotten older I’ve noticed that my 
regrets are stronger about the things that I’ve not done than any memory or 
concern over the things that I have tried at which I didn’t succeed. You have 
to go out there and do more than just occupy space.

  Six Wise People
377
Pamela: I think so. I think an interesting flip side of that, though, is that some 
people might actually be perfectly happy and content with what they’re doing, 
and yet they might feel that they should be doing something else. So they 
think they should explore it. That’s the case where they might try something 
and have it not work out. Then they gain new appreciation for what it is that 
they had.
I think that can be an interesting outcome. It’s not for everybody, the entre-
preneurial lifestyle. Startup life, starting a company, is not for everybody, and 
that’s totally OK. It’s more about finding a work situation that really works 
for you.
To Be or Not to Be . . . an Entrepreneur
Bob: Let’s talk about that for a moment, maybe discerning whether or not 
you should launch a startup. What’s the litmus test that you think exists out 
there to decide whether or not someone is able to handle being an entre-
preneur?
Pamela: I wish there were that test, Bob, and I wish I administered it, because 
I would be a rich woman. [laughter]
It’s everybody’s question. It’s totally valid. People look at profiles of successful 
entrepreneurs and characteristics. I would say, in terms of what can have 
more probability of having somebody be successful, certainly a strong sense 
of being very self-directed.
Confidence, I would say. Sometimes entrepreneurs can be very unconfident 
and have all kinds of fears, but the key with them is that they actually do push 
through that fear. They do things anyway, even if it doesn’t always feel good 
or, as you said, even if they fail.
In terms of the actual testing of the viability of an idea, I believe so much in 
having the experience of really testing and trying things out to make sure 
that there is a real market, that you have real people who are purchasing, 
before you actually make any decision to leap.
That probably is the distinguishing factor. Somebody on paper could have all 
of the right characteristics. Their personality profile could be perfect, if they’re 
sitting back and planning for three years, versus somebody who might not 
look perfect on paper but who actually tests and tries and gets things going.
I’ve seen all kinds of different personality profiles succeed. Usually those 
who do are those who recognize their limitations and surround themselves 
with complementary skill sets.
Bob: Let me put that in a somewhat different way, because I think you’re 
hitting an important point there. If you’re going to be a startup, you have to 
be a son of a bitch. I mean this in a positive way. I don’t mean that you’re a 
nasty person or that you torture animals or anything like that.

  Six Wise People
378
I mean that you’re the type of person who, when you set your mind to doing 
something, you’re going to put everything into making that thing happen. 
You’re not easily dissuaded by what other people think. You’re not going to 
take failure as a judgment, from whomever, that you’re unworthy of ever 
trying this and that it’s time to crawl back to your cube.
You really have to push to be able to be an entrepreneur. I’ve yet to find any 
entrepreneur or startup who’s managed to have really noticeable success 
without first meeting failure along the way.
Pamela: It is a totally crucial part. I completely agree with you. It is not an 
easy thing, and I really have had to look at myself in the mirror many, many 
times and really ask myself, “What are you made of? How much do you want 
it? What is the meaning behind what you’re doing?” It goes to our earlier 
conversation, that if you do not feel strongly that there is a purpose and a 
meaning for what you’re doing. I usually get a visual in my mind of somebody 
who is sitting in that cube who might be really miserable, whose health is 
failing, who doesn’t feel like she has any joy in her life.
When I run into a brick wall, when I create a program that nobody buys, or 
a whole myriad of different things that can happen as I’m pushing along in my 
business, I step back and I just try to look at that person, and say, “How 
much do I care about this? How much do I care about moving forward?”
The more that I can be human, allow myself sometimes to feel a little crappy 
for having failed, but then pick up, take the learning from it, and move on, 
and not let myself be defined by that—that really is the key difference. Because 
it is not easy and there definitely will be failures. Because when you’re testing 
and trying something totally new, it’s impossible that it’s always going to 
work out the way that you think it is. Life doesn’t work that way.
Packing for Your Escape
Bob: What sorts of things should you pack before you start out from your 
corporate home, assuming that you’re still in it?
Pamela: Meaning Post-It notes and pencils? [laughs]
Bob: Raid the office supplies. That’s always a good one.
Pamela: Not very ethical. No, I’m teasing you. In terms of what you should 
really have in line, before you decide to make the leap?
Bob: Everyone obviously gets the idea of having some savings put aside, 
because there’s inevitably costs to building a startup, even today. What other 
things would be good to have for the journey, maybe emotional and social 
and psychological things?
Pamela: I think there are a number of things. It definitely makes sense to 
have your finances in order, even for people who might not be naturally 
inclined to look at their finances in detail, because everybody’s different 
about that. I think this is a case where you might need to get a little bit of 
help, just to really get a clear sense about where you are. You need to know 
what’s coming in, what’s going out.

  Six Wise People
379
Trim as much as you can so that you have as much of a cushion as possible. 
The finance experts that I talked to when I did my book would say anything 
from six months to a year of having money set aside, as a cushion.
This is not just savings that you have. But it really is money that will be there 
specifically in order to help fund you if your plans don’t go as you think they 
will. Or if you’re still in the development phase, it will give you the necessary 
money in order to develop your business idea.
I think that’s a really critical piece. It’s really important to have a circle of 
people around you, where you already have begun to build up. Just given the 
way the world works today, it could be a virtual circle of a lot of people who 
might be in your corner, who are peers and mentors and friends, who can 
really be encouraging of your moving in your new direction.
For a lot of corporate employees, who have always grown up around other 
employees, it can feel very lonely to take this path. People that you talk to 
might think you are totally crazy, because they don’t know anybody who’s 
actually done it before, successfully.
So before you even begin to step out on your own, I encourage you to do 
things like join the Business of Software forum, so that you can begin to build 
up a network. Through a broad network like that, you’re really going to find 
the people who you relate to.
I always like to have people in my circle who are what I call my peer mentors, 
who push me. I know that we have similar background and experience, but 
they’re the kind of people who are really going to go that extra mile. That 
makes me think, “You know what? I have to hustle. I see what Bob’s doing. 
He’s on his third book. I just made it through one. I better really be moving 
forward.” You want to have that in place, as well.
The other thing is that you definitely want to have as clear a picture as you 
can about the nature and framework of your business. You want to have a 
good understanding of how marketing works in your arena.
You should have already begun to build up your list—the people that you 
want to serve, your target customers. It has some kind of regular, predict-
able way in which you are beginning to build relationships with people, on 
the marketing side. Because, as you know, people buy from people they 
know, like, and trust, which, on the marketing side, can take a year, 18 months, 
two years. It’s not that everybody who’s just going to stumble across your 
site is going to buy immediately.
But somebody who’s been enjoying you and getting great feedback and infor-
mation from you over time, in different social environments, is going to feel, 
like, “Wow, if Bob is going to sell something, I really want to buy it.”
Bob: It sounds like one of the ways of doing that would be through a blog.

  Six Wise People
380
Pamela: It’s been great for me, definitely. I’ve realized that I have had so 
much personal success with my blog in terms of pleasure, for one. But also 
on the marketing side and also in how it’s brought me clients and a book deal 
and many more things. I, definitely, am biased that way. I realize that not every-
body is a writer, not everybody is going to have that as the chosen form of 
their core marketing activity.
But there are so many benefits to it, that where all things are pretty much 
equal, I just see so many benefits to writing a blog. Because it can be the 
source of your core intellectual property, about what you know, about your 
field of expertise, whether it be a service business or a product.
The information that you’re sharing can become a repurposable source of so 
much great stuff. You can create an e-book, an audio program, a workshop. 
Use it for your marketing materials. Use it for an actual, physical book.
So I’m a huge fan. If you don’t have a total aversion to writing, if you can be 
clear, and if you learn how to write, keeping your audience in mind and 
providing useful information to them, that’s definitely a great start.
From Layoff to Bootstrap
Bob: What about the situation where you’ve been pushed? In other words, 
you’ve just been laid off from your job. Maybe you saw it coming, maybe you 
didn’t. How do you, first, cope with the bereavement of your work situation 
and then be able to go off and launch a startup?
Pamela: That’s a really good term with which to talk about it, bereavement, 
because it can be a very traumatic thing. I find, even if people are expecting 
it, that it really does put you in a whole state of grief. You need to allow 
yourself to go through it and not feel crazy for being very sad or sometimes 
being very angry or going through all the traditional stages of grief. If they 
can, I really encourage people to just take the time in order to work through 
it and get the kind of support that they need, because it is not an easy thing 
to go through.
That said, I’ve actually talked to a lot of people recently who have been in 
that situation, not surprisingly. This is one distinction, one way that might be 
helpful to think about how you actually get back on your feet and get working 
again. And that is when you’re talking about building something that is a full-
fledged startup, a company that would be your sole source of income where 
you could make the equivalent amount that you made as an employee.
If you have not already, then do a lot of work on the side to make that actu-
ally happen so that when you get laid off all of a sudden, you can just step 
into that company full time and basically just do more of what you have been 
already doing, which is selling products or services, and make it full time.
For a lot of people, they actually could be so much earlier in the process, 
where for some they don’t even really know what kind of business they want 
to start. Or, they had not put anything in place. They haven’t tested anything, 
they have no product or any kind of service defined.

  Six Wise People
381
So in this case I would recommend having more of an interim strategy. And 
that can be looking at making a very clear assessment of your own skills and 
competencies that are salable. So if you’ve written code before, if you’ve been a 
project manager or software developer, whatever it is, you can make an 
assessment of all the different skills that you have, inside of work and outside.
Maybe you’re a great landscaper. Maybe you know how to organize garages. 
Really take nothing off the table at all. Just think about all the different ways 
in which you can generate income. Think about a shorter-term strategy 
where you can just begin to monetize some of the stuff that you know really 
well in order to bring in some income.
And don’t be shy about that. And I hope that people feel really good about 
doing that, because it’s very, very hard to be thinking about the long-term, 
bigger picture when you’re totally worried and you have no plan for how 
you’re going to bring in money.
Bob: So you have to deal with the fear first. I guess you have to deal with 
the fear and the worry and the grief and the hurt. And maybe there needs 
to be a transition stage between yesterday’s pink slip and tomorrow’s master of 
the universe?
Pamela: I think so, because, yes, when you are afraid . . . Fear actually is a 
great teacher. You can really think about what are you afraid of, if you’re 
totally panicked because you don’t know where your next source of income’s 
going to come from, and that’s because you do not have anything defined. 
You have no idea how you will make money. Then that’s probably why you 
have that fear. It’s a different kind of fear than, as I said, if you have been 
working very specifically on a side project for a long time and you have some 
normal anxiety and fear about getting customers and so forth. That could 
mean pointing you in a different direction where maybe you really do need 
to beef up on your sales and marketing skills.
But pay attention to what that fear is saying. We can often have a really strong 
reaction that’s very extreme. I call it the lizard fear. It’s related to that fight-
or-flight mentality that we have, which nowadays is fueled by the news about 
everybody’s being worried that there’s not enough, there’s not enough—
even though there are some great opportunities for those who can feel strong 
and move forward. So when you feel that, I think the first thing, as you said, 
is to listen to the fear, figure out what is it trying to tell you.
And then, yes, don’t be shy about getting some interim things in place, which 
for some people could be getting another job in order then to be able to go 
further down the road and work on the longer-term plans.
One of my clients actually did exactly that thing, and he found that when he 
was trying to work on the long term or worried about the short-term cash 
flow, it just didn’t work at all. And he got another job, and now he’s feeling 
so much better. Now he’s aware, and his eyes are open that he’s not going 
to sit back and not do the work like he did before—you know, when he was

  Six Wise People
382
employed and he kept putting off creating his plans—because now he knows 
that nothing is stable, since he got laid off before. But the difference is that 
he realized for himself that he needed to have more of a predictable income 
coming in, in order to work on the longer term.
Bob: That makes sense. What lessons would you’d like to point out from 
your new book for startups that’s just coming out?
Pamela: One of the biggest lines that I tried to walk in the book is to be 
very encouraging to people who were sitting back feeling like they were 
crazy for not being happy in their corporate job and encouraging them to 
really take some time to figure out what it is that they do want to do. There 
are a lot of wonderful opportunities, today more than ever, to do things a 
different way and potentially either to make some income on the side or to 
work fully for yourself.
That said, the second main point in the book is that it’s not always a fairy 
tale. And I caution people against thinking that it’s going to be easy. One of 
the themes from the book that seems to be resonating with a lot of people 
is that hating your job intensely is not a business plan. A lot of people feel 
that the biggest decision is “Oh, I hate my job. I’m going to do it: I’m going 
to quit.” And then they really are just quitting and jumping into a big pit of 
nothingness because they really haven’t done the work to plan and prepare.
So I try to lay out a very specific, what I hope is realistic, process of what 
actually are the things that you need to have in place. And it’s not just having 
your finances in order or then defining ideas in a business plan, but it’s also 
getting things straight on the home front: really working out a very good 
open communication with your spouse and your family members so that 
you’re all in alignment in terms of the new direction in which you’re going.
It’s also important to really focus on building up this extended network of 
people who can be friends and peers and mentors, even the High Council of 
Jedi Knights, which is the term I use for people who you truly, truly admire, 
who you really want to aspire to be like and also really follow and learn from, as 
mentors.
So there are a lot of things, I think, on that path, where the key is not to be 
overwhelmed but to really break it down in stages and give each stage the 
time that it needs.
So if you are really early in the process and you have no idea what you’re 
actually passionate about and what you want to do, don’t put pressure on 
yourself to have to get a whole business up and running quickly. You might 
be much better served to just do things that actually engage your creative 
self. Take a tango class and cook and wander through a new neighborhood. 
Do things that are really going to wake you up so that you get a sense of 
what you really care about.

Once you get through that place, that’s where, then, all of the sudden it’s like 
the fog clears and you can see what the next step is. I think people just want 
to jump in and get everything done at the same time, and that’s really what 
feels overwhelming.
Bob: Let me recap what we’ve got here. First off, there are things that you 
have to do to make something real. And one of the biggest things is to see 
the steps involved that actually need to be done. You have to get it down to 
what David Allen would call the action level, where you actually are doing 
physical things about it.
The other part that I see here if you’re going to succeed is that you need to 
do things that have absolutely nothing to do with technology, especially if 
you’re coming from “corporate land,” where you’ve been living in a way that 
has a whole set of rules and you’ve internalized all those rules because you’ve 
been a good corporate team player. And now you have to go through the 
process of picking and choosing which of those values will still serve you in 
this wholly different role that you’re going to take on.
As you mentioned a moment ago, you’ve also got to get your house in order. 
Part of that is financial, but by house I mean more like your home, the people 
or persons in it, and your extended family and friends. You’re going to need 
their support. You may ask them for money. You want their buy-in and their 
encouragement. And you need all these things before you just go flail at the 
idea of being a startup.
Pamela: Right.
Lou Carbone, Founder and Chief Experience Officer, 
Experience Engineering
Now I’d like to introduce you to fellow ex-UPI reporter Lou Carbone 
(Figure 9-6). Lou has both made a name for himself and built a thriving consulting 
firm focusing his talents on the art and science of experience management. 
What’s that? That’s the next business idea after branding. It’s the kind of 
experience a company—such as your startup—creates for its customers. Is 
it going to be a living hell of endless voicemail trees, the whiff of smug arro-
gance, and a base of customers desperately seeking an alternative that most 
“real” companies now pass off as serving their customers? Or is it going to 
be the sleek, above expectation, respectful with-it-ness of, say, Apple? And 
how do you as founder control this outcome?

Figure 9-6. Lou Carbone
It’s not the size or nature of the company that determines customer expe-
rience. Both small and large companies can get it wrong. But for startups, the 
results of ignoring the kind of experience you’re creating for your customers 
can stop your company dead.
Lou’s book Clued In: How to Keep Customers Coming Back Again and Again 
(Financial Times Prentice Hall, 2004) lays out a framework for understanding 
what customers need and desire and how to manage those needs and desires.
In this interview, Lou helps me—and you, I hope—understand what goes 
into what a customer experiences, starting with the Edsel1 of operating systems, 
brought forth by a company that prided itself on understanding the customer: 
Microsoft Vista.
1  “The Edsel was a marque of the Ford Motor Company during the 1958, 1959, and 1960 model 
years. The brand is known best as one of the biggest commercial failures in the history of American 
business.”—from http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edsel

Customer Experience, Vista, and the iPhone
Bob: What is customer experience?
Lou: I think one of the critical factors, and especially in IT applications, is to 
begin to think of the effect that software has on individuals, on their lives, 
and how they feel about themselves using the software, versus the function-
ality. And I think that when you begin to look at some of the experiences 
that we’ve had, what is amazing to me is, at what point do you reach the law 
of, I guess, diminishing returns, in terms of effect on a customer? And I think 
some of the greatest examples of those particular applications are certainly 
Microsoft, in terms of all of the functionality that I’m not even aware of that 
exists in my PowerPoint program.
And I think what happened with Vista is the interesting piece of what’s there: 
You not only had difficulty doing what you always did with it, but you didn’t 
understand what the effect was. Why did they do what they did? It didn’t 
make me feel any different. It was just rearranging some things.
Bob: So, if I wanted to put in sort of IT shorthand: to get an idea of what 
happens when customer experience goes wrong, look at Vista.
Lou: Exactly! Exactly! Look at Vista. And also, ultimately, when we begin to 
look at cloud computing, if you will, what’s so beautiful about that is the 
feeling, the effect that it has on people and that people will be willing to give 
up certain functionality for its effect on their lives and how it causes them to 
feel, versus dealing with software that has all of this hidden resource that 
you almost feel like you’ve paid for but don’t get to use. So when we look at 
the percent of what I’m using in Microsoft Word, there’s part of me that feels 
very enabled and very powerful. I’m able to write a book that I would have 
never been able to write with a typewriter, perhaps.
Bob: OK.
Lou: Yet there’s a whole aspect, unconsciously in Word, that deals with 
margins and all of these other aspects that . . .
Bob: Ad infinitum.
Lou: Yeah, that I don’t have the time to invest. So, consequently, I feel some-
what inadequate, not fully vested in the power that the software can bring to 
me. And when you look at it, where was the saturation point when they 
reached the law of diminishing returns on what was there? And then I begin 
to look at cloud computing and some of that, at the feeling of efficiency, the 
feeling of what’s there and what it does in my life.
If we look at the iPhone and the power of what it puts at my fingertips, from 
a functionality perspective, it has all of these things that I can master and use. 
I think it’s brilliant, the way that they provide you with a basic framework on 
the iPhone, and then you can begin to customize it and make it as complex 
or as simple as you want. Being an early adapter, I overloaded my iPhone 
with every possible piece of software . . .

  Six Wise People
386
Bob: [laughs] Yeah.
Lou: . . . determine compass directions, wind, et cetera, et cetera. And conse-
quently, I’m now feeling, boy, maybe what I need to do is really understand 
what I need, rather than being overwhelmed thumbing through all of these 
icons and so on. I think it would have been great if there was a way for the 
software store to think about itself, in a sense, in respond mode, versus make 
and sell, where I would tell a piece of software or tell the store if you will, 
“This is what I need. I need time management. I need what’s important to 
me—a to-do list.”
Bob: It sounds like you’d like to see concierge shopping at the iTunes Store.
Lou: Exactly. That would have been more powerful for me. And then, if it 
recommended, maybe you might want to leave one spot open that you put 
stuff in and out of to test, almost a sample area. But then they’re thinking 
about its effect on me as an experience, versus putting software in a store 
and selling it as product. So then I would have seen the iStore, the Apple 
Store, where you get the software, as a partner in my life, which I see the 
phone as to a great degree. But have they really fully leveraged what that 
feeling is like? And, to me, the iPhone has been one of the most unbelievable 
experiences.
Why Care About What Your Customers Feel?
Bob: Let’s back up a moment here. It sounds like I should care, as a startup 
company, about how my users feel? All I want is their money. Why do I care 
about what they feel?
Lou: Because what they feel is what will shape their attitude. Unconsciously, 
how we feel about ourselves in an experience really begins to affect our 
framing of the attitude that we have toward that. Take a relationship with 
the cell phone companies, for example.
Bob: Yeah, I know how I feel about my cell phone company. So let’s take 
that.
Lou: Yeah. And what they don’t understand is that they could have all of 
these great products. They could have extraordinary coverage. But every 
time I’ve been through my carrier, I realize that they could give a crap about 
how I feel and how their whole experience causes me to feel.
I think the greatest example of that was when the iPhone 3G actually came 
out and I went to the iStore. I had a first-generation iPhone and the 3G comes 
out. I go to the store. They said, “Well, you can’t walk out of the store like 
you did last year and activate it on your own. It has to be activated here in 
the store.” So we go to activate it, and for some reason I was on a discount 
plan. And on that particular discount plan, AT&T wouldn’t offer the promo-
tional price, which was actually $299, and the phone was going to cost me 
$499. And that’s because of AT&T.

  Six Wise People
387
And so I had this huge, four-person conversation, four different levels, at the 
AT&T call center. And they said, “Nope, these are the rules. This is the way 
it’s been done. This is what we’ve created.” And I was very, very disappointed 
and a little upset, because I had waited in line at the Apple Store for God 
knows how long.
Bob: It sounds like this customer experience stuck in your mind.
Lou: It was horrible, absolutely. It left a lasting impression that reinforced 
my feeling about AT&T.
Bob: And that typically happens with customer experiences.
Lou: Exactly. So it lived up to its reputation. And what does the person do 
at the Apple Store? He calls his manager over and explains what happened. 
The manager apologizes and says, “You know, I’m really sorry, but AT&T 
and what they’re doing is out of our control. But why don’t I just give you a 
$200 gift card to put toward the phone, and that will bring it down to the 
price that you should be getting it for.”
Bob: And how do you feel about Apple?
Lou: Fantastic! One treated me with incredible respect, incredible under-
standing of how I felt and how I would feel leaving. I felt unimportant. I felt 
insignificant. I felt unappreciated, after being with AT&T for 13 or 14 years. 
And when I left the Apple Store with what they did, I felt special. I felt closer 
to them. I felt empowered. I felt stronger. I felt much more confident in the 
decision that I made.
Bob: I had a similar experience with the same two companies when I bought 
my 3G. I went to an AT&T Store to buy it, because that’s who my carrier 
was. They treated me like dirt. And I literally just said, “Forget it,” and walked 
out. I just didn’t want to be near those people. I stood in line for three hours 
at an Apple Store, and I haven’t stood in that long a line for a long time. But 
when I got in there, they couldn’t have been nicer. They moved me right 
through, they did what I needed to do, and I was out the door in 10 minutes.
Lou: Yeah.
Bob: And I felt so good, because here is this person helping me do what I 
want to do. I can still remember that I had also planned to buy a new mouse 
for my MacBook Pro, because I had literally worn out the other one. And 
they said, “Oh, you’ve got an extended warranty. Here you go.” And he just 
hands me a new mouse. I’m going, “Oh!” I didn’t have to fill out a form to 
get this. I didn’t have to jump through hoops.
I think it’s something that a lot of people underestimate—well, let me ask it 
this way. Is it true, do you think, that most people come up with reasons to 
do things, in terms of rationalizations, based on their feelings rather than on, 
necessarily, the facts of the matter?
Lou: Absolutely, without a doubt. I mean, we see this over and over, in terms 
of human behavior, that we will create an intellectual alibi and create rational 
reasons for the emotional feelings and decisions that are in our unconscious 
thoughts.

  Six Wise People

Engineering Customer Experience
Bob: Well, then, let me ask it this way. To take a pun off of your company 
name, how do you engineer experience?
Lou: It’s a set of clues and signals that we send in experiences that we have. 
And it’s a careful orchestration of the experience, according to a plan, so that 
they don’t happen at random. Now, the plan is built on sensing and responding. 
And it’s not a product plan, the way that we would build a product, because 
experiences are considerably more dynamic. Again, let’s cite Apple. I think 
that the thing that’s interesting is that I hear everyone, from design folks to 
whomever, all citing Apple in terms of what the magic of Apple is.
And over the years—I’ll probably date myself a little bit—we heard the very 
same thing about Disney, for years and years and years. What I can’t believe 
is that, rather than looking for next practices and understanding what is 
embedded in these experiences that bond people in a certain way, we tend 
to search for best practices. And in searching for best practices, we become 
very superficial and never understand the infrastructure underneath the 
experience.
So let’s look at Apple a little deeper than most people do. Let’s look at the 
experience of the Genius Bar.
Bob: OK. For our Windows readers, that’s where you walk up, after having 
made an appointment prior to that, with your laptop and you say, “I’ve got 
this problem, and I want you to help me.”
Lou: Exactly. And let’s take an example, again, a real, live example. And I’m 
going to contrast this to the Geek Squad at Best Buy.
Bob: OK.
Lou: I go to the Apple Store. I have my Sony computer, which is a Windows 
PC. And I walk in, and I have a problem with the iTunes software.
Bob: OK.
Lou: Now, the first question that one would normally have is “Are they 
going to tell me it’s a software problem [laughs] and, therefore, we have 
nothing to do with it?” And no. I come in, and they put my computer on the 
workbench. They look at it. They spend almost an hour and a half with me, 
reload the software, do this, do that. And all of a sudden, my music is syncing 
up again on my iPhone. And I’m expecting to pay something. And by the way, 
I was able to make an appointment online, show up, and within five minutes 
of the time I was supposed to be waited on, I was waited on. And at the end, 
I’m, like, “OK,” and they said, “No charge.” And I was like, “You’re kidding 
me.” They said, “No.” They said, “No, no charge. We really got it taken care 
of, and that’s all that matters.”
Now, I have been there probably seven or eight times and have had only 
three incidents where we’ve paid something. There was a little thing that 
happened with my daughter in replacing a hard drive recently on an Apple 
computer. The Genius Bar looked at it and said, “Oh, my gosh.” And she 
was almost three weeks out of warranty. And they said, “You know what? 

  Six Wise People
389
It needs a new hard drive. The hard drive is gone. This happens. And let us 
order one. They’re usually 200 and some-odd dollars. But what we’ll do is 
take $100 off for you.”
So there’s this tremendous sense of reciprocity that’s built, that they do 
something for me, I owe them something. And it really invoked this spirit of 
generosity. And my understanding is it’s like a slot machine. Sometimes they 
charge, sometimes they don’t, depending upon how busy they are, and it’s at 
the discretion of the individual.
Now, Robert Stephens, the founder of the Geek Squad, sold it to . . .
Bob: . . . Best Buy.
Lou: Best Buy. Best Buy has taken that concept and, prior to Best Buy’s 
taking the company and the concept, you would be able to go in and get 
advice, and these geeks were phenomenal. You really trusted them.
Bob: They were actual geeks.
Lou: They were real geeks, and there was real passion. And all of a sudden, 
Best Buy takes the company and starts instituting some elements of its culture 
into the company. Suddenly, it’s almost like greed and avarice in terms of 
who’s in charge. So I bring to the Geek Squad a computer that’s still under 
warranty.
Bob: OK.
Lou: A Sony VAIO. They look at the computer. And the first thing they hit 
me with is, “There is no diagnostic charge because it’s under warranty. But 
we would recommend that you back everything up, and that’s going to cost 
$120.”
Bob: [laughs] Yeah.
Lou: “Let’s proceed.” Then they take it and they look at it, and it’s going to 
have to be there for a week and a half. And I get a phone call, after about 
four days, asking me for my code number or my password. I give them the 
password. Another week passes. They call and they say, “We can’t really 
recreate the problem you’re having and think it’s a software problem.” And 
I said, “It’s saying that it doesn’t see that the device,” which is a phone device 
on the phone. It’s like a cellular link.
It’s showing that there’s no device. And I said, “The device is either not working 
or there’s something wrong. And I’ve got this warranty that I’ve paid for, an 
additional $300 on top of the cost of the computer. I expect you to figure 
out what’s wrong.” So they look at it, and they say, “Well, we just recommend 
reinstalling everything . . . ”
Bob: Oh, yeah. I’ve heard that one before, too.
Lou: “And we’ll start all over again.” And they send it to Geek City, down 
in Memphis or wherever, and it’s there for however long. And it comes back, 
and they couldn’t get it fixed, and they said it was a software problem.
Bob: [laughs] Yeah. That’s been the type of experience that I think every-
body in this business has had. And as I’m listening to you . . .

  Six Wise People

Lou: How does one cause me to feel, versus how the other one causes me 
to feel?
Bob: Yeah. One makes you feel great. The other makes you feel like some-
thing you should wipe off the bottom of your shoe.
Lou: Exactly. They made me feel like crap, like I was like gum. They wanted 
to get rid of me. They wanted to make money off of me. And I know that 
Robert Stephens, the founder of the company; these are not the founding 
principles that he started the company on. But I know that it’s basically 
corporate stuff that causes, “Oh, my God! We can get bigger margins! Look 
at what it’s costing us to do this and that!” Because they are looking at the 
experience in parts rather than looking at it holistically, whereas what you 
have at Apple is a holistic view of the customer experience.
Customer Experience, Step by Step
Bob: Walk me through the steps. I realize that this may be a case of describing 
music to someone who can’t hear, but walk me through the steps of how a 
startup CEO should look at their offering and try and understand what people 
feel about it.
Lou: I think that it comes down to a very simple premise, which is really 
listening for what is buried in conversation. And often, when we do market 
research or usability studies, we tend to look for customers’ opinions. And 
opinions are the intellectual alibis and rationalizations and justifications that 
we create for deeper feelings that we have. So what we end up doing is 
committing one of two mistakes. We either take everything at face value, or 
we have a set of prescribed questions that we want to ask because we think 
that they’re important questions.
And what I would encourage someone to do that’s starting a company is to 
have someone experience their experience and then just ask them, “Well, 
how does the experience feel to you?” And you listen for the next hour to 
hour and a half, just pressing down, asking, and following them where they 
go in the storytelling, where they go in the discussion, and asking them why. 
It’s almost like conducting a psychological . . . [laughs] I don’t like the color 
red. “Oh, really? That’s interesting. Tell me more about that.” Well, red 
represents . . .
Bob: . . . makes me angry. [laughs]
Lou: Yeah, makes me angry and makes me see flames. “Well, tell me more 
about flames. What do flames do?” Oh, flames destroy things. Flames release 
energy. “Tell me more about releasing energy.” [laughs]
Bob: Just to follow up on that metaphor for a moment: If you’re doing 
research, one of the things you want to try and do is get some sort of consensus 
on what people think. That stuff seems pretty touchy-feely, pretty hard to 
quantify. If you do that with one person, that person may hate red. If you do 
it with another person, that individual may love red. How do you deal with 
that issue of human nature?

  Six Wise People
391
Lou: You actually transcribe all of the interviews. And then you begin to look 
for patterns and doing phrase searches. There’s actually a technique that we’ve 
used quite a bit, called ZMET, which is examining metaphors that appear in 
the language that people use to understand how they frame their thoughts 
and feelings. So I think that as we’ve evolved into a whole new world, the 
need to look at different ways of creating value than we have in the past, and 
especially in the development of software, we need to go beyond looking at 
usability and functionality, to the effect that it has on people. That’s where 
the ultimate value is created, in the effect that it has on us. That resides deep 
in our unconscious thoughts, shapes our attitudes, and drives our behaviors.
Let’s look at Intuit, for example. And I used Intuit many, many years ago and kind 
of outgrew Intuit over the years. And I don’t know what Intuit does any longer. 
I lost interest, because what it represented to me was a move beyond . . . I think 
the first PC I had was the most expensive check register I ever owned.
Bob: Yeah.
Lou: And I’d moved from that to Intuit, which moved me to a new place. 
And then somehow they lost me. And I think that the reason that they lost 
me was they really didn’t understand the bigger picture. They understood 
the functionality of what I had to do but not the emotional pressure that’s 
created around when I need to sit down and do bills. It’s the motivation to 
sit down and do them, and get it out of the way, and how I feel after it’s out 
of the way, versus how easy it is. Ease and functionality are important. But 
they never relieved my largest pressure. So suddenly, my online banking 
sends me a reminder and actually gives me my balance. And I’m like, “Oh, 
gosh. I’ve got x amount in there. I should sit down and do bills tonight.”
Bob: It’s interesting, because one of the startups that I interviewed for this 
book is the guy who started mint.com, which is an online alternative to Intuit’s 
basic consumer offerings. And he talked a lot about exactly what you’re talking 
about and how he decided that he was just going to create something that 
didn’t make people feel that way anymore.
Lou: Exactly. That I have a feeling of inadequacy that Intuit doesn’t help me 
with. And it’s the inadequacy built around the discipline of sitting down, because 
I don’t like parting with cash. [laughs] No one does.
Being Your Customer’s Protector
Bob: Any final advice for startups?
Lou: Someone has to be the vanguard and protector of alignment around 
the experience that we want to create. So we need to determine (a) what it 
is that the customer desires feeling and (b) our commitment to creating that 
feeling and then the alignment of every element of the experience, to rein-
force that feeling. And, to me, that’s what Steve Jobs does. That’s why, so 
often, companies like that, they’re companies that are referred to in a book 
called Firms of Endearment, which are companies that, if they went away 
tomorrow, we as customers would mourn their loss.

  Six Wise People
392
And what he has done is really managed to be that protector, that guardian. 
Now, in the absence of a Steve Jobs, you need to set up a system that creates 
that discipline. And that’s what we talk about when we talk about experi-
ence engineering. It’s an experience management system in the absence of 
or to augment a very, very visionary, very demanding leader, which Steve Jobs is 
and Walt Disney was.
But it’s that thread that I studied in my initial work, many, many years ago in 
looking at Disney. And I see huge parallels at Apple, and it’s why people are 
worried about Steve Jobs’ health. And I would say that for any person who 
is gifted in this regard or a person who tries to create a system that is in the 
startup company, the big thing is to create a system that does that—whether 
it’s through a strong leader, whether it’s through an experienced management 
system that’s built, that operates even in the absence of the strong leader, 
which is what happened at Disney, where that legacy that he created went 
on for many, many, many, many years, because the system he built was so 
strong. It wasn’t driven by a person.
And what that system is built around is understanding the deep emotional 
needs of customers, committing to meeting those deep, emotional needs, 
and then aligning everything with that. And that, to me, is the ultimate in 
terms of winning customers’ hearts and souls. How they feel about themselves 
and that experience, they then associate with the brand, which drives loyalty.
Bob: OK, I think that’s going to do it.

fast becoming a major Internet destination.
Bob: How has Alltop been able to go from 200,000 unique visits a month to 
500,000 unique visits in just 14 month?
Guy: Well, first of all, you could make the case that 14 months is a long 
time. [laughing] It’s not a short time! To answer your question, really what I 
did is I just used Twitter. I used Twitter to get ideas for Alltop, which topics, 
what feeds to put into Alltop, and then to promote Alltop. So I don’t know 
how I would have done it without Twitter, frankly.

  Six Wise People

Bob: That’s one hell of a recommendation for a startup that doesn’t yet 
have a revenue model. Would it have been possible to start Alltop before 
Twitter or without Twitter?
Guy: Started? Yes. Make it successful? Probably not! [laughs] Let’s just say it 
was very fortunate timing that Twitter existed, because prior to Twitter— 
let’s say if I did an Alltop, the best case would be I would just have to keep 
trying to get bloggers to write about it. Bloggers need some kind of reason 
to write about something, not that you simply exist. That may be the first 
story, but never again. So Alltop is a very unusual service, in the sense that 
we have 600 topics and we release more every day. So we have a constant 
flow of announcements.
Whereas, if you’re writing a spreadsheet, you announce version 1 and then 
a year later you announce version 2. So you had two press announcements, 
big press conference, big press release, big press event, et cetera, et cetera.
But Alltop is unlike any other thing. In that 14 months we could have had 
600 press kits for 600 different topics, and obviously that wouldn’t have worked. 
So how else could I have got the news out about 600 mini-introductions 
other than Twitter?
Bob: Has Twitter changed the game as far as startups?
Guy: Yeah, absolutely. Now, obviously if you’re a life sciences company and 
you’re making a new kind of stent or if you have a cure for cancer, you’re 
not going to do the marketing on Twitter. But if you have most kinds of 
consumer-facing products, whether it’s a gadget or software or a service, I 
think you can market it on Twitter. Twitter is basically fast, free, and ubiqui-
tous. What’s wrong with this picture? Nothing is wrong with this picture!
Bob: How about the rest of the social media networks out there like Face-
book, private networks, and all the other tools. Are they . . . ?
Guy: The only reason I don’t mention those things is because I don’t know 
how to use Facebook well. Facebook is sort of focused on more of—it’s 
more of bringing friends to you, whereas Twitter is purely broadcasting and 
pushing. So it’s a different perspective.
Bob: Do you use Twitter to listen to prospective people talking about Alltop?
Guy: Yes. I have 160,000 followers, so I can’t just watch the public timeline 
of my followers. What I do is I have dedicated searches for my name and 
Alltop. That’s the only thing I watch.
Bob: And I take it that would be one of the things you would recommend 
to a startup as well.
Guy: Yes, absolutely. Yes.
Bob: By the way, what do you think of microISVs, one-person software 
companies that are self-funded?
Guy: There’s nothing wrong with that. We’re pretty close to that!
Bob: Well, let me ask you another general question about startups. How do 
you pick a partner for your startup? How many partners should you think 
about having?

  Six Wise People
395
Guy: Well, I think the ideal number is three. Basically you need someone 
who can create the thing, someone who can market the thing, and someone 
who can be the adult and pay the bills and make sure you’re not going nuts 
with expenses and that kind of thing and collect the money.
What’s Changed?
Bob: That makes sense as a combination. Let me move on to some of the 
other aspects of what you do. You have written extensively about what 
founders need to do to get funding, especially in Reality Check, your latest 
book. Has anything changed, given the global recession we’re in right now, 
forecasted for the next couple of years here?
Guy: Yeah. As a matter of fact, I think a lot has changed. Not just because 
of the recession, but because of Open Source also. I think before, people 
had to raise millions of dollars in order to get to version 1. I no longer think 
that is true. I think because of the relative cheapness of everything in the 
recession plus Open Source, the expectation is that you show up with a 
working prototype.
Bob: So that’s the first raising of the bar: They have to have more than just 
an idea or a team. They need a prototype.
Guy: Yes.
Bob: How about revenue?
Guy: You mean for seeking first funding?
Bob: Yeah. Has the bar gone up that high?
Guy: Well, of course it would be nice to be showing revenue already. But 
probably as important, maybe even more important, is to show that the dogs 
are eating the food.
Bob: By that you mean . . . ?
Guy: That people are using it, that people are registering, that people are 
showing up.
Bob: Besides Open Source, besides global recession, what other big changes 
do you see here?
Guy: That’s it. Isn’t that enough?
Bob: It probably is. As a founder, when is the right time to sell your startup? 
And as an investor, when is it the right time to sell? You’ve been both, first 
with Truemors and now with Alltop.
Guy: That’s a very hard question to answer. I think most people, they sell 
too late. You of course hear the story that Twitter has been offered X hundreds 
of millions of dollars, but they’re holding out. I think when you come to a 
point where you’re about to make more money than you ever dreamed, you 
should just sell rather than just try to take every penny off the table.
Bob: Greed is not a good idea?
Guy: I don’t know if it’s greed. It is maximization.
Bob: OK. About getting that funding: When you’re out there as a first-time 
founder, you have not done this before and you don’t have the track record, 
how important is it to build a network with angel investors and VCs? In 
other words, is that a must-do, a nice-to-have, or somewhere in between?

  Six Wise People
396
Guy: Well, only if you need money. [laughs]
Bob: OK. So I guess that’s a yes, it’s something you have to do.
Guy: Yeah.
Bob: How do you go about getting the interest of angel investors such as 
yourself?
Guy: First of all, it’s just man-on-man networking. It’s also targeting angel 
investors that make sense. If someone made all of his money in semiconductors, 
he’s probably not going to invest in the next online music site, and vice versa. 
So some of that is just targeting. And a lot of it is just appealing to the angel 
investor as a fun person, maybe even a daughter or son substitute. None of 
that comes into play with venture capital.
I think a lot of angels have the perspective of wanting to pay back society by 
helping the next generation. And that certainly doesn’t exist in the venture 
capital business!
Bob: So there really is a big difference between angels and even very small 
investments in VC money.
Guy: Yes. There is a huge difference. Now, it’s not always easier, because 
the angel is also investing his or her after-tax money, whereas a venture 
capitalist is investing some pension fund’s money. It’s not really his money, 
right?
Bob: But the motivations are different, I think, per se.
Guy: Yes. And having said that, I don’t think you should think of an angel 
investor as an easy mark that you can fool and get money from faster and 
cheaper, et cetera. You should have the same standard of presentation to a 
VC as to an angel.
Bob: What other mistakes do first-time founders make when it comes to 
angels?
Guy: Isn’t that enough? [laughs]
Bob: It probably is, but I’m curious: Is there a magic formula for a startup to 
get angel investment?
Guy: Only what we just discussed already.
Recap
So what have we learned in this chapter? And I say we because these peo-
ple have been kind enough to mentor me a bit in my startup efforts as 
well as sharing with you here.

  Six Wise People

■From Dharmesh Shah we learned two things: First, we had a crash 
course in what VCs and angel investors want, in case you skipped 
Chapter 5. Second, and more important, whether you’re talking 
about finding a cofounder or making your first hire, “Just find those 
practical people that have a passion for building something and pull 
them in.”
■From Eric Sink we learned, besides that most of the revenue of 
a product comes after the developers have lost interest, that “the 
number one lesson I’ve learned or the number one thing that has 
prevented me from destroying my own company is that you have to 
be self-aware about your limitations.” You are not going to be able 
to do everything. And in terms of your own maturity you need to 
be at a point in your life when you’ve learned this, when you aren’t 
threatened into inaction by people who can outdo or outthink you 
in a given area.
■Two things that Joel Spolsky shared with us are especially worth 
mulling over, besides his withering opinion of Twitter. The single 
most important thing you must focus on is how to make your soft-
ware great. All other considerations are side issues. One way to get 
there is to be the kind of programmer who makes the rest of us look 
lame and to hire programmers of that same high caliber. Because soft-
ware development is still more art than science, one programmer can 
be—and should aspire to be—10 times better than average.
■Pamela Slim brought into focus three things. First, if escaping 
working for someone else isn’t a life-changing, life-improving dream 
in your heart, maybe it’s not the right thing for you at this point in 
your life. Second, the time to begin creating your startup is before, 
not after, you get laid off or quit your corporate job. And finally, 
getting your emotional, financial, and human relational house in 
order is pretty much a prerequisite for the kind of whole-life change 
that starting a company entails.
■Lou Carbone reminded us that the software business, like all busi-
nesses, is about people. Your job, as the leader of your company, 
is to think long and hard about the effect your product and your 
company has on people. Done right, you build something people 
care about deeply. Done wrong, and your company will win the 
contempt and scorn of your customers, not their hearts and minds.

■Guy Kawasaki pointed out this is a business that changes constantly. 
Twitter has gone from online oddity to startup necessity in months, 
not years; by the time you read this book, something else might 
have already taken it’s place as the latest disruptive technology or 
at least be waiting in the wings to do so. Your job as a founder is to 
track, know about, and take advantage of these shifts. And, as Guy 
pointed out, it’s up to you to get out there and do some “man-on-
man networking.” You’ve got to get out from behind your computer 
if your startup is going to succeed.
Now that we’ve heard from six really smart people, you’re nearing the 
finish line, at least as far as this book is concerned. Next up, a few last bits 
of advice before you roll up your sleeves and build your startup.

What’s Next?
Intro to the Outro
Writing a conclusion for a book like this is both artifice and necessity. It’s 
artifice in that you are the one who’s going to write the ending of this 
particular effort; your hard work from here on out will determine the 
success of your startup. Writing this concluding chapter is a necessity 
because it’s good to finish things. It lets you reflect on what’s just happened, 
what’s next, and whether you are still on course.
Let me summarize what I think this book’s big takeaways are for startup 
founders. Then I shall wish you good luck in your startup endeavors before 
I give you a healthy push out of the nest.
There Have Never Been More 
Opportunities for a Startup to 
Succeed
I won’t bore you with stories of the bad old days of, say, two years ago, but 
the fact remains: This is the most favorable period for a startup since this 
industry began some 40-odd years ago. Some of the reasons are obvious, 
others less so.
■The cost barrier to entering the global software market is now a 
speed bump. Between cloud platforms, virtualized servers, and instant 
access to a global market and a world of people who now look to the 
Internet first for solutions and answers, your startup’s cost structure is 
very different than what necessity demanded even a few years ago.

■Silicon Valley has spread out. Gone are the days when would-be 
startups packed their bags and headed to Silicon Valley like hopeful 
starlets on their way to Hollywood. You don’t need to come to Silicon 
Valley to be discovered; if you’ve got something good, the world will 
come to you. Nor do you need to be in the Valley to find talented 
programmers and designers; they, too, are a click away.
■Startups are a market too, and that’s a very good thing. The growth 
of startups from the dark days of the dot-com bust at the beginning 
of this century has, among other things, created a market, and other 
startups and companies are happily making money selling to that 
market the tools and services that startups require. Need another 
dozen servers? Amazon E2C is a click away. Want to use social 
networking to get the word out? Take your pick from hundreds of 
consultants who know their stuff. Need to staff up? Take your pick 
of Web 2.0 apps designed to make it easy for a startup to do just that.
■Small is trustworthy. The thrashing that the global economy has 
taken has also proven to be a trashing of the reputations of big insti-
tutions. Big is about as fashionable now as a Hummer 3 bought via 
a credit card backed by a home equity loan. Part of this is the next 
phase of moving from an industrial world of big to a postindustrial 
world of small; part of it is a series of economic events that have 
shown over and over that large isn’t necessarily smart. SaaS and 
mobile startups in particular have benefited from this change in 
attitude on the part of the buying business and consumer public.
■Crisis is opportunity, scary as hell opportunity, but opportunity 
nonetheless. Stability may make it easier to sleep at night, but it 
makes for few opportunities for entrepreneurs. Between the still-
accelerating rate of change and a global economic system that’s 
anything but stable, there are huge classes of new problems, needs, 
and wants looking for startups to address.
The Quality of the Idea Behind 
Your Startup’s Product or Service 
Is Paramount
One theme you’ve heard over and over in this book—from startups up the 
road from you to industry veterans to the money guys—it all ignites with 
a really good idea. You can go through all the motions of creating a startup, 

  What’s Next?
401
but if a really good idea is not at its core, you’re not going to get the 
attention, effort, or money it takes to succeed.
The days of (relatively) easy money for “me too!” startups ended in 
the fourth quarter of 2008. The core proposition of your startup has to 
got to have real intrinsic value, whether it’s SaaS enterprise software or a 
new fitness iPhone app. Doing what everyone else has done isn’t enough 
in a world where everyone knows the available solutions to a problem—or 
can within a few minutes via Google.
You don’t have to discover antigravity—although that would be nice—
but you do have to envision and then execute the delivery of real value to 
real people, not hypothetical “everyone who uses a PC” markets, which 
brings us to our next point.
Your Idea Has to Hold Real Appeal to 
at Least One Specific Market Segment
If you look at the startups in this book, you’ll notice that one of the 
things they have in common is a crystal-clear idea of exactly who their 
market is: none of this “everyone with a mobile phone,” “all Mac users,” 
“small, medium, and enterprise businesses” stuff.
More often than not, the startups that succeed are the ones that 
obsess over who their customers are and what those customers want. 
Whether it’s Aaron Patzer of mint.com understanding that people are 
tired of acting like bookkeepers or Adam Wiggins of Heroku focusing on 
Rails developers tired of acting like system administrators, these people 
base their coding and business decisions on what their intended custom-
ers want, and everything else is secondary.
And it’s not enough to “be in the mobile game space” or to “address 
the CMS market”; that’s double-talk. The market segment you need to do 
the work and spend the time to find—ideally before you write your first 
line of code—is going to be defined by a combination of who they are, how 
they see the world, what problems they face, and what they struggle with 
when they get up and go to work each day. They are going to represent a 
tiny sliver of a market or industry that is really going to love your new app.
I think Tony Wright of RescueTime put it best: “The idea there is that 
once you find the heart of people who are madly in love with what you are 
doing, to get bigger and more successful as a startup, all you need to do is 
find more people like that or move laterally to serve a slightly different 
type of audience.” That’s doable. Making something that a lot of people 
are only mildly interested in is a dead end.

402
Serious Value + Great Customer 
Experience Means You Get Taken 
Seriously
So you find your starter market segment. What’s next? Next you deliver 
some serious value. That means you create a tool, a service, or an app 
that has some significant worth to that market segment. The more value 
you deliver to your customers, be it the quality of the ideas and design 
that go into the product or how well your startup executes the entire cus-
tomer experience, the more your startup is going to be worth.
Note that proviso—having a great product with lousy customer support 
means you’ve missed the point. As Lou Carbone talked about in Chapter 9, 
delivering a great product is the start of the process; as the founder of 
your company, you (even if you are the company) need to be thinking 
about what your customers are experiencing from the moment they step 
through your online door.
If You Play by Everyone Else’s Rules, 
You Lose
Let’s step back a minute. What advantage do you have over all the estab-
lished companies who are after the same customers you want? Besides 
looks, charm, and obvious keen intellect (you bought this book, after 
all), as a startup you have the decided advantage that you can pick the 
platform or combination of platforms on which to build your startup, and 
your established competitors can’t.
Disruption is the name of the game you want to play, because then 
you get to write the rules, and the rules say you win and they lose. Let me 
pick on Aaron Patzer and mint.com one last time, because they’re a shin-
ing example of how to rewrite the rules of the game.
It’s no secret that Intuit has owned the consumer financial software 
market for the past decade. Despite Microsoft’s best efforts—including 
even trying to buy Intuit outright—Intuit has maintained a huge market 
share. For example, QuickBooks small business accounting application 
had an overwhelming 74% market share at retail and 3 million customers 
as of 2005.1 Now, Aaron could have gone toe to toe on Intuit’s home 
platform—the desktop—and joined countless other startups who’ve tried

tc20050825_8432_tc024.htm?chan=sb

  What’s Next?
403
that and failed. Instead, he went after a new generation of young Internet-
centric users, a market and a platform Intuit does not dominate.
Has this strategy paid off? Well, in February 2009, “Intuit . . . can’t 
believe how well its competitor Mint is doing. In fact, they were so bewil-
dered by Mint’s claims of gaining 3,000 new users a day and jumping from 
600,000 to 850,000 users in a matter of months that they decided to send 
a threatening letter demanding an explanation for this apparently incon-
ceivable feat” (TechCrunch, “Quicken Online Can’t Believe Mint Is Doing 
So Well; Sends Threatening Letter”). Does that sound like a disconcerted 
competitor to you? It does to me.
A whole generation of client-server, barely webified vertical market 
applications are out there—literally tens of thousands—that are going to 
be equally disconcerted, as today’s crop of startups offer SaaS, PaaS, mobile, 
cross-platform solutions that run rings around formerly successful soft-
ware. Taking the time and doing the hard mental work of understanding 
what platform or platforms you’re going to use in your startup is a key 
step to rearranging the rules in your favor.
Social Networks Are Key to 
Your Success
Now, for some of you this is so “Duh!” that you might wonder why I’m 
stressing it in these final pages. It’s because not everybody’s gotten the 
message. Again, you see people in this business taking one side or the 
other: “Twitter and Facebook and the rest are just noise factories” vs. 
“We’ve got 3,000 followers on Twitter—woot!”
In Chapter 6 we covered how this idea of groups of people actually 
interacting with each other electronically went from geek plaything to 
groups of people the size of countries all connecting and conversing, but 
let me rehash just a few stats here:
■Of all U.S. broadband users (105 million), 76% are active contributors 
to the web via social media (including uploading photos, blogging, 
rating products, and other Web 2.0 activities).2
■Moreover, approximately 29%, or 40 million broadband users, are 
regular contributors to the Web specifically through social networking 
sites and are spending increasing amounts of their online time 
communicating with each other, both one-to-one and one-to-many.3

  What’s Next?
404
■Facebook in early 2009 had 150 million users, about half of whom 
use Facebook every day.
■Hi5 has 60 million users.
■MySpace has 76 million users.4
Let’s leave aside that social network attention is like oxygen to startups, 
or how buzz on Twitter about a startup, magnified via the online trade 
press, opens funding doors undreamed of. Let’s just talk numbers here. 
Social networks have become too big for any sane company, especially a 
startup, to ignore. For startups in particular, finding the right ways, ven-
ues, and approach to being part of the online conversation is now as 
important as developing the solution, and this is edging out/replacing/
morphing “marketing.”
So what’s your social network plan? Are you or one of your partners 
wearing the hat of community manager? These are key questions to ask—
and answer—if you’re going to succeed.
Have a Plan to Get Through the 
Bootstrap Valley of Death
Speaking of plans, if you’re creating your first startup while you’re con-
sulting on the side or working for a living, you’d better have a plan for 
making it through what I call the Bootstrap Valley of Death. We touched 
on this in Chapter 5 and especially in Chapter 8, but it bares repeating as 
we wrap up: You need a plan to bootstrap successfully.
Again, this is not the traditional “business plan” for drumming up VC 
funding; it’s how on earth you are going to manage you to get out the 
smallest acceptable selling app or service in a survivable length of time. 
Yes, you need to think about money. But money is not the only resource 
you have to manage and plan; everyone has a limit to how long he or she 
can push to turn a vision into reality. Upfront planning means you’re 
going to be dead serious about how to get this job done. Not planning 
means your fate is at best in the lap of the gods.

Research: Social Computing.

Money Is the Lifeblood of Startups—
Manage It Well
OK, so you’ve mapped out your startup plan, and you know you’re going 
to have to spend or offset X amount to get to a prototype, Y to get to your 
first sale, and Z to grow like crazy. How do you get that money? As covered 
in Chapter 5, you’ll need to start with the person you see every day in 
the mirror.
As we learned from the angel investors and venture capitalists in 
Chapter 5 and elsewhere, gone are the days when “give us money and we’ll 
build the next Google” worked. If you’re going to pry money from people 
other than family, friends, and fools, you’re going to have to demonstrate 
at the least a hell of a good prototype with all those nasty technical issues 
solved.
Moreover, if you would still like to have some control over the fate of 
your startup after you go for equity funding, you’d better be well read in, 
not just the coverage given that world in this book, but how the game is 
being played and by whom as of right now. It’s more than knowing what a 
term sheet is; it’s doing the research, reaching out to other startups who’ve 
played the game, finding mentors, and knowing exactly what the stakes are.
Good startups will attract and find investors, in even the toughest of 
economic times. But you’d better know the rules of the game, today, and 
those rules get made by the people with the money.
One Final Bit of Advice
So here we are. If I’ve done my job right, you should now have a much 
better idea of what it takes to go from being a developer to being a founder. 
Here, then, is one last bit of advice from me—and, I’d like to believe, from 
just about every other developer who has taken the road you want to walk.
It’s fine to change your product, adjust your market position, restate 
your message, adapt to what your market tells you—odds are good you’ll 
do all those things and more as you work you’re butt off finding the right 
combination of moving parts that, like a superconductor magnet, attract 
attention, money, and value to your startup. Flexibility is the middle name 
of every successful startup in this business. Just as long as you never, 
never, never, never give up. If you don’t give up, you’re going to succeed. 
It’s just that simple.
