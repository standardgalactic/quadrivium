Prerequisites
Before beginning to use Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 Classroom in a Book, make sure 
your system is set up correctly and that you’ve installed the required software and 
hardware. You can view updated system requirements by visiting www.adobe.com/
products/premiere/tech-specs.html.
You should have a working knowledge of your computer and operating system. You 
should know how to use the mouse and standard menus and commands and also 
how to open, save, and close files. If you need to review these techniques, see the 
printed or online documentation included with your Windows or Mac OS system.
Installing adobe Premiere Pro Cs6
You must purchase the Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 software separately from this 
book. It can be purchased as a stand-alone product or included in the Creative 
Suite or Creative Cloud families. Install Adobe Premiere Pro from the software 
DVD onto your hard disk; you cannot run the program from the DVD. If you pur-
chased a downloadable version, follow the instructions included with the download 
for launching the installation process.
adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 trial
Adobe offers a 30-day trial of Adobe Premiere Pro CS6. You can download this trial 
from the Adobe product website. After 30 days, the software will stop functioning. 
If you decide to purchase Adobe Premiere Pro, you can enter your purchased serial 
number into the trial version you have installed to convert it to a full version of 
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6.
optimizing performance
Editing video is memory- and processor-intensive work for a computer. A fast 
processor and a lot of memory will make your editing experience much faster and 
more efficient; 4 GB of memory is the minimum, and 8 GB or more is better for 
high-definition (HD) media. Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 takes advantage of multicore 
processors on Windows and Macintosh systems.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 3
A dedicated 7200 RPM or faster hard drive is recommended for high-definition 
video (HD) media. A RAID 0 striped disk array or SCSI disk subsystem is strongly 
recommended for HD. Performance will be significantly affected if you attempt to 
store media files and program files on the same hard drive. Be sure to keep your 
media files on a second disk if at all possible.
The Mercury Playback Engine in Adobe Premiere Pro can operate in software-
only mode or GPU acceleration mode. The GPU acceleration mode provides 
significant performance improvement. The GPU acceleration is possible with 
select video cards. You can find a list of these video cards on the Adobe website 
at www.adobe.com/products/premiere/tech-specs.html.
Copying the lesson files
The lessons in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 Classroom in a Book use specific source 
files, such as video clips, audio files, and image files created in Adobe Photoshop 
CS6 and Adobe Illustrator CS6. To complete the lessons in this book, you must 
copy all the files from the Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 Classroom in a Book DVD 
(inside the back cover of this book) to your hard drive. You will need about 4 GB of 
storage space in addition to the 4 GB you need to install Adobe Premiere Pro CS6.
Although each lesson stands alone, some lessons use files from other lessons, so 
you’ll need to keep the entire collection of lesson assets on your hard drive as you 
work through the book. Here’s how to copy those assets from the DVD to your 
hard drive:
1 Open the Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 Classroom in a Book DVD in My Computer 
or Windows Explorer (Windows) or in Finder (Mac OS).
2 Right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac OS; if you’re using a super mouse 
or pen, you can right-click) the folder called Lessons, and choose Copy.
3 Navigate to the location you set to store your Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 projects.
The default location is My Documents\Adobe\Premiere Pro\6.0 (Windows) or 
Documents/Adobe/Premiere Pro/6.0 (Mac OS).
4 Right-click (Windows) or Control+click (Mac OS) inside the 6.0 folder, and 
choose Paste.
Following these steps will copy all the lesson assets to your local folder. This 
process may take a few minutes to complete, depending on the speed of your 
hardware.

relinking the lesson files
It is possible that the file path to the lesson files may need to be updated. If you 
open an Adobe Premiere Pro project and it cannot find a media file, a dialog may 
open and ask you “Where is the File MEDIA.mov’?” If this happens, you will need 
to navigate to one of the offline files in order to reconnect. Once you’ve recon-
nected one file in the project, the rest should reconnect.
• You can navigate to the same location where you copied the files you copied 
from the DVD. The path will be Premiere Pro CS6 CIB > Lessons > Assets. 
You may need to look in some of the included folders to find the media file 
(especially if it involves tapeless media).
• You can use the search field in the OS dialog box to search for the file by name.
When you locate a file, just select it and click the Open button.
how to use these lessons
Each lesson in this book provides step-by-step instructions for creating one or 
more specific elements of a real-world project. The lessons stand alone, but most of 
them build on previous lessons in terms of concepts and skills. So, the best way to 
learn from this book is to proceed through the lessons in sequential order.
The organization of the lessons is workflow-oriented rather than feature-oriented, 
and the book uses a real-world approach. The lessons follow the typical sequential 
steps video editors use to complete a project, starting with acquiring video, laying 
down a cuts-only sequence, adding effects, sweetening the audio track, and ulti-
mately exporting the project to the Web, a portable device, a DVD, a Blu-ray Disc, 
or Flash.

Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 is a video-editing system 
that supports the latest technology and cameras with 
powerful tools that are easy to use and that integrate 
perfectly with almost every video acquisition source.

10 
lesson 1 touring Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6
Getting started
Today we’re seeing an increasing demand for high-quality video content as well as 
an ever-changing landscape of old and new technologies. Despite all of this rapid 
change, however, the goal of video editing is the same: You want to take your  footage 
and shape it using your original vision so that you can effectively communicate with 
your audience (or even the world).
In Adobe Premiere Pro, you’ll find a video-editing system that supports the latest 
technology and cameras with powerful tools that are easy to use and that integrate 
perfectly with almost every video acquisition source, as well as a wide range of plug-
ins and other post-production tools.
You’ll begin by reviewing the essential workflow that most editors follow. Next you’ll 
see how Premiere Pro fits into Adobe CS6 Production Premium. Finally, you’ll learn 
about the main components in the Adobe Premiere Pro interface and how to create 
your own custom workspaces.
nonlinear editing in adobe Premiere Pro
Premiere Pro is a nonlinear editor (NLE). Like a word processor, Premiere Pro lets 
you place, replace, and move footage anywhere you want in your final edited video. 
You can also adjust any parts of the video clips you use at any time. You don’t need 
to perform edits in a particular order, and you can make changes to any part of your 
video project at any time.
You’ll combine multiple clips to create a sequence that you can edit simply by click-
ing and dragging with your mouse. You can edit any part of your sequence, in any 
order, and then change the contents, move clips so that they play earlier or later in 
the video, blend layers of video together, add special effects, and more.
You can work on any part of your sequence, in any order, and even combine mul-
tiple sequences. You can jump to any moment in a video clip without needing to 
fast-forward or rewind. It’s as easy to organize clips as it is to organize files on your 
computer.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 11
Adobe Premiere Pro supports both tape and tapeless media formats,  including 
XDCAM EX, XDCAMHD 422, AVCCAM, DPX, Panasonic P2, AVCHD, AVC-Intra, 
and DSLR video. It also supports the latest in raw video formats with enhanced 
RED camera support and the addition of ARRI Alexa. Bringing footage into your 
project is fast and easy, and it is usually unnecessary to convert your video files before 
using them.
Presenting the standard digital video workflow
As you gain editing experience, you’ll develop your own preference for the order in 
which to work on the different aspects of your project. Each stage requires a par-
ticular kind of attention and different tools. Also, some projects call for more time 
spent on one stage than another.
Whether you skip through some stages with a quick mental check or spend hours 
(even days!) dedicated to perfecting an aspect of your project, you’ll work through 
the following steps:
1 Acquire the video. This can mean recording original footage or gathering assets 
for a project.
2 Capture (transfer or ingest) the video to your hard drive. With tape-based 
formats, Adobe Premiere Pro (with the appropriate hardware) can convert the 
video into digital files. With tapeless media, Adobe Premiere Pro can read the 
media directly—there’s no need for conversion. If working with tapeless media, 
be sure to back up your files to a second location.
3 Organize your clips. These days, there can be quite a lot of video shots to choose 
from in your project. Spend the time to organize clips together into special 
folders (called bins) in your project. You can also add color labels and other 
metadata (additional information about the clips) to help keep things organized.
4 Build your edited sequence by selecting the parts of the video and audio clips 
you want and adding them to the Timeline.
5 Place special transition effects between clips, add video effects, and create 
combined visual effects by placing clips on multiple layers (tracks).
6 Create titles or graphics, and add them to your sequence in the same way you 
would add video clips.
7 Mix your audio tracks to get the combined level just right, and use transitions 
and special effects on your audio clips to improve the sound.
8 Export your finished project to videotape, to a file for a computer or for Internet 
playback, to a mobile device, or to a DVD or Blu-ray Disc.
Adobe Premiere Pro supports each of these steps with industry-leading tools.

lesson 1 touring Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6
enhancing the workflow with adobe Premiere Pro
Adobe Premiere Pro has easy-to-use tools for standard video editing. It also pro-
vides advanced tools for manipulating, adjusting, and fine-tuning your projects.
You may not incorporate all of the following features in your first few video projects. 
However, as your experience and understanding of nonlinear editing grows, you’ll 
want to expand your capabilities.
The following topics will be covered in this book:
• Advanced audio editing: Adobe Premiere Pro provides audio effects and editing 
unequaled by any other nonlinear editor. Create and place 5.1 surround-sound 
audio channels, make sample-level edits, apply multiple audio effects to audio 
clips or tracks, and use the included state-of-the-art plug-ins as well as third-
party Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plug-ins.
• Color correction: Correct and enhance the look of your footage with advanced 
color-correction filters. You can also make secondary color-correction 
selections that allow you to adjust isolated colors and adjust parts of an image 
to improve the composition.
• Keyframe controls: Premiere Pro gives you the precise control you need to 
fine-tune visual and motion effects without exporting to a compositing or 
motion graphics application. Keyframes use a standard interface design, so learn 
how to use them once, and you’ll know how to use them in all Adobe Creative 
Suite products.
• Broad hardware support: Choose from a wide range of dedicated capture cards 
and other hardware to assemble a system that best fits your needs and budget. 
Adobe Premiere Pro system specifications extend from low-cost computers 
for digital video (DV) and compressed HDV editing up to high-performance 
workstations capturing full HD and 3D stereoscopic video.
• Mercury Playback Engine graphics card acceleration: The Mercury Playback 
Engine operates in two modes: software-only and GPU acceleration. The GPU 
acceleration mode requires a compatible graphics card in your workstation. 
See www.adobe.com/products/premiere/tech-specs.html for a list of compatible 
graphics cards.
• Multicam editing: You can easily and quickly edit productions shot with 
multiple cameras. Adobe Premiere Pro displays multiple camera sources 
in a split-view monitor, and you can choose a camera view by clicking the 
appropriate screen or using shortcut keys.
• Project Manager: Manage your media through a single dialog box. View, delete, 
move, search for, and reorganize clips and bins. Consolidate your projects by 
moving just the media actually used in a project and copying that media to a 
single location. Then reclaim drive space by deleting unused media.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 13
• Metadata: Adobe Premiere Pro supports Adobe XMP, which stores additional 
information about media as metadata that can be accessed by multiple 
applications. This information can be used to locate clips or communicate 
valuable information such as preferred takes.
• Creative titles: Create titles and graphics using the Premiere Pro Title Designer. 
You can also use graphics created in almost any suitable software, plus Adobe 
Photoshop documents can be used as automatically flattened images or as 
separate layers you can incorporate, combine, and animate selectively.
• Advanced trimming: Use special trimming tools to adjust each clip and cut 
point in a sequence. Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 includes significant improvements 
to its trimming tools, allowing you to make complex trimming adjustments to 
multiple clips.
• Media encoding: Export your sequence to create a video and audio file that is 
perfect for your needs. Use the advanced features of Adobe Media Encoder to 
create multiple copies of your finished sequence in several different formats.
expanding the workflow
While it is possible to work with Premiere Pro as a stand-alone application, it 
is really meant to be a team player. Chances are high that you’re using Adobe 
Premiere Pro as part of Creative Suite 6, which means you have access to other 
specialized tools. Even if you are using the stand-alone version, it comes bundled 
with Adobe Encore (for authoring DVD and Blu-ray Discs) and Adobe Media 
Encoder (for creating digital video files). Knowing how the software components 
work together will improve your efficiency and expand your capabilities.
Incorporating other Cs6 components 
into the editing workflow
Adobe Premiere Pro is a versatile video and audio post-production tool, but it is just 
one component of Adobe CS6, Adobe’s complete post-production environment that 
includes software for the following:
• High-end 3D motion effects creation
• Complex text animation generation
• Layered graphics production
• Vector artwork creation
• Audio production

14 
lesson 1 touring Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6
To incorporate one or more of these features into a production, you can use other 
components of Adobe Creative Suite 6 Production Premium. The software set has 
everything you need to produce advanced, professionally finished videos.
Here’s a brief description of the other components:
• Adobe After Effects CS6: The tool of choice for motion graphics and visual 
effects artists.
• Adobe Photoshop CS6 Extended: The industry-standard image-editing and 
graphic-creation product. You can work with photos, video, and 3D objects to 
prepare them for your project.
• Adobe Audition CS6: A powerful tool for audio editing, audio cleanup, audio 
sweetening, music creation, and automatic speech alignment.
• Adobe Encore CS6: A high-quality DVD-authoring software designed to work 
closely with Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects, and Photoshop CS6. Encore 
produces DVDs, Blu-ray Discs, and interactive SWF files. Encore CS6 is included 
with Premiere Pro.
• Adobe Illustrator CS6: Professional vector graphics creation software for print, 
video production, and the Web.
• Adobe Dynamic Link: A cross-product connection that allows you to work 
in real time with media, compositions, and sequences shared natively between 
After Effects, Premiere Pro, and Encore CS6, without rendering, exporting, or 
importing.
• Adobe Bridge CS6: A visual file browser that provides centralized access 
to your Creative Suite project files, applications, and settings. Bridge CS6 is 
included with Adobe Premiere Pro CS6.
• Adobe Flash Professional CS6: The industry standard for creating rich, 
interactive web content.
• Adobe SpeedGrade CS6: Professional, sophisticated color grading/finishing 
with support for high-end and 3D (visual stereo) video formats.
• Adobe Prelude CS6: Ingest and add metadata, markers, and tags to file-based 
footage to speed up your post-production workflow.
• Adobe Media Encoder CS6: Batch-process files to produce content for any 
screen from Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects CS6. Adobe Media Encoder 
CS6 is included with Adobe Premiere Pro CS6.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 15
adobe Creative suite 6 Production Premium workflow
Your Premiere Pro/Creative Suite 6 Production Premium workflow will vary 
depending on your production needs. Here are a few scenarios:
• Use Photoshop CS6 to touch up and apply effects to still images from a digital 
camera, a scanner, or a video clip. Then use them in Premiere Pro.
• Create a layered graphic in Photoshop CS6, and then open it in Premiere Pro. 
You can opt to work with each layer independently, allowing you to apply effects 
and animation to selected layers.
• Import large numbers of media files with Adobe Prelude CS6, adding valuable 
metadata, temporal comments, and tags. Create sequences from subclips in 
Adobe Prelude and send them to Premiere Pro to continue editing them.
• Send a clip straight from the Premiere Pro timeline to Adobe Audition for 
professional audio cleanup and sweetening.
• Send your Premiere Pro sequence to Adobe Audition to complete a professional 
audio mix. Premiere Pro can create an Adobe Audition session based on your 
sequence, with mixed-down video so you can compose based on the action.
• Using Dynamic Link, open Premiere Pro video clips in After Effects CS6. Apply 
special effects and animation, and then view the results in Premiere Pro. You 
can play After Effects compositions in Premiere Pro without waiting to render 
them and also benefit from After Effects CS6 Global Cache, which saves RAM 
previews for later use.
• Use After Effects CS6 to create and animate text in ways far beyond the 
capabilities of Premiere Pro. Use those compositions in Premiere Pro with 
Dynamic Link. Adjustments made in After Effects appear inside Premiere Pro 
immediately.
• Send video projects created in Premiere Pro into Encore CS6 using Dynamic 
Link, without rendering or saving an intermediate file. Use Encore to create a 
DVD, Blu-ray Disc, or interactive Flash application.
Most of this book will focus on a standard workflow involving only Premiere Pro. 
However, several lessons and sidebars will demonstrate how you can use Adobe 
Creative Suite 6 Production Premium components as part of your workflow for 
powerful effects work and fine finishing.

lesson 1 touring Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6
touring the adobe Premiere Pro interface
It’s helpful to begin by getting a little familiarity with the editing interface so you 
can recognize the tools as you work with them in the following lessons. To make it 
easier to configure the user interface, Premiere Pro offers workspaces. Workspaces 
quickly configure the various panels and tools on-screen in ways that are helpful for 
particular activities, such as editing, special effects work, or audio mixing.
To begin with, you’ll take a brief tour of the Editing workspace. In this exercise, 
you’ll use an Adobe Premiere Pro project from this book’s companion DVD. Be 
sure to copy the lesson files from the DVD to your computer’s hard drive for best 
performance.
1 Make sure you’ve copied all the lesson folders and contents from the DVD to 
your hard drive. The suggested directory is My Documents/Adobe/Premiere 
Pro/6.0/Lessons (Windows) or Documents/Adobe/Premiere Pro/6.0/Lessons 
(Mac OS).
2 Launch Premiere Pro.
3 Click Open Project.
4 In the Open Project window, navigate 
to the Lesson 01 folder in the Lessons 
folder, and then double-click the 
Lesson 01.prproj project file to open 
the first lesson in the Premiere Pro 
workspace.
P Note: All Adobe Premiere Pro project files have 
a .prproj extension.
P Note: It’s best to 
copy all the lesson 
assets from the DVD 
to your hard drive and 
leave them there until 
you complete this book; 
some lessons refer to 
assets from previous 
lessons.
On the welcome screen 
of Premiere Pro, you can 
start a new project or 
open a saved one.
P Note: You may be 
prompted with a dialog 
box asking where a 
particular file is. This 
will happen when the 
original files are saved 
on a hard drive (or hard 
drive letter) different 
from the one you’re 
using. You’ll need to 
tell Premiere Pro where 
the file is. In this case, 
navigate to the Lessons/
Assets folder, and select 
the file that the dialog 
box is prompting you to 
open. Premiere Pro will 
remember this location 
for the rest of the files.

the workspace layout
Before you begin, make sure you are looking at the default workspace. Choose 
Window > Workspace > Editing. Then, to reset the Editing workspace, choose 
Window > Workspace > Reset Current Workspace. Click Yes in the confirmation 
dialog.
If you’re new to nonlinear editing, the default workspace might look like an awful 
lot of buttons. Don’t worry. Things become much simpler when you know what the 
buttons are for. The interface is designed to make video editing easy. The principal 
elements are shown here.

Each workspace item appears in its own panel, and multiple panels can be com-
bined into a single frame. Some items with common industry terms stand alone, 
such as Timeline, Audio Mixer, and Program Monitor. The main user interface 
elements are as follows:
• Timeline panel: This is where you’ll do most of your actual editing. You view 
and work on sequences (the term for edited video segments or entire projects) in 
the Timeline panel. One strength of sequences is that you can nest them (place 
sequences inside other sequences). In this way, you can break up a production 
into manageable chunks or create unique special effects.

18 
lesson 1 touring Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6
• Tracks: You can layer—or composite—video clips, images, graphics, and titles 
on an unlimited number of tracks. Video clips on upper video tracks cover 
whatever is directly below them on the Timeline. Therefore, you need to give 
clips on higher tracks some kind of transparency or reduce their size if you want 
clips on lower tracks to show through.
• Monitor panels: You use the Source Monitor (on the left) to view and trim 
raw clips (your original footage). To view a clip in the Source Monitor, double-
click it in the Project panel. The Program Monitor (on the right) is for viewing 
your sequence. Some editors prefer working with only one monitor screen. 
The lessons throughout this book reflect a two-monitor configuration. You can 
change to a single-monitor view if you choose. Click the Close button on the 
Source tab to close that monitor. In the main menu, choose Window > Source 
Monitor to open it again.
• Project panel: This is where you place links to your project’s media files: video 
clips, audio files, graphics, still images, and sequences. You can use bins—similar 
to folders—to organize your assets.
• Media Browser: This panel helps you browse your hard drive to find footage. 
It’s especially useful for file-based camera media.
• Effects panel: This panel contains all the clip effects you will use in your sequences, 
including video filters, audio effects, and transitions (docked, by default, with the 
Project panel). Effects are grouped by type to make them easier to find.
• Audio Mixer: This panel (docked, by default, with the Source and Effect 
Controls panels) is based on audio production studio hardware, with volume 
sliders and panning knobs. There is one set of controls for each audio track on 
the Timeline, plus a master track.

• Effect Controls panel:  
This panel (docked, by 
default, with the Source 
and Audio Mixer 
panels, or accessible via 
the Window menu) 
displays the controls for 
any effects applied to a 
clip you select in a 
sequence. Motion, 
Opacity, and Time 
Remapping controls are 
always available for 
visual clips. Most effect 
parameters are adjustable over time.
• Tools panel: Each icon in this panel represents a tool that per-
forms a specific function, typically a type of edit in a sequence. The 
Selection tool is context-sensitive, which means it changes 
appearance to indicate the function that matches the circum-
stances. If you find your cursor doesn’t work as you expect it, it 
might be because you have the wrong tool.
• Info panel: The Info panel (docked, by default, with the Project 
panel and Media Browser, or accessible via the Window menu) 
presents information about any asset you select in the Project 
panel or any clip or transition selected in a sequence.
• History panel: This panel (docked, by default, with the Effects and 
Info panels) tracks the steps you take and lets you back up easily. 
It’s a kind of visual Undo list. When you select a previous step, all 
steps that came after it are also undone.
Customizing your workspace
In addition to customizing the default workspaces (based on tasks), you can 
adjust the position and location of panels to create a workspace that works best 
for you. You can then store a workspace or even create multiple workspaces for 
different tasks.
• As you change the size of a frame, other frames change size to compensate.
• All panels within frames are accessible via tabs.
• All panels are dockable—you can drag a panel from one frame to another.
• You can drag a panel out of a frame to become a separate floating panel.

In this exercise, you’ll try all these functions and save a customized workspace.
1 Click the Source Monitor panel (selecting its tab if necessary), and then position 
your pointer on the vertical divider between the Source panel and the Program 
panel. Then, click and drag left and right to change the sizes of those frames. 
You can choose to have different sizes for your video displays.
2 Place the pointer on the horizontal divider between the Source panel and the 
Timeline. Drag up and down to change the sizes of these frames.
3 Click the gripper area in the upper-left corner of the tab for the Effects panel (to 
the left of the name), and drag it to the middle of the Source panel to dock the 
Effects panel in that frame.
The drop zone is displayed as a center highlight.
When many panels are combined in a single frame, you may not be able to see 
all the tabs. A navigation slider appears above the tabs to navigate between 
P Note: All panels are 
adjustable in the same 
way, even the Tools and 
Audio meters.
P Note: As you move 
a panel, Premiere Pro 
displays a drop zone. If 
the panel is a rectangle, 
it will go into the 
selected frame as an 
additional tab. If it’s a 
trapezoid, it will go into 
its own frame.

them. Slide it left or right to reveal hidden tabs. You can also display a panel by 
choosing it in the Window menu.
4 Click and drag the Effects drag handle to a point near the right of the Project 
panel to place it in its own frame.
The drop zone is displayed as a trapezoid.
You may need to resize your panels to see the 
controls you want.
The drop zone is a trapezoid that covers the right portion of the Project panel. 
Release the mouse button, and your workspace should look something like the 
example on the right.
You can also pull panels out into their own floating panel.
5 Click the Source Monitor’s drag handle, and hold down the Control (Windows) or 
Command (Mac OS) key while dragging it out of its frame. Its drop zone image is 
much more distinct, indicating that you are about to create a floating panel.

6 Drop the Source Monitor anywhere, creating a floating panel. Resize it by 
dragging from a corner or a side like any other panel.
7 As you gain experience, you might want to create and save the layout of your 
panels as a customized workspace. To do so, choose Window > Workspace > 
New Workspace. Type a name, and click OK.
8 If you want to return a workspace to its default layout, choose Window > 
Workspace > Reset Current Workspace. To return to a recognizable starting 
point, choose the preset Editing workspace and reset it.
Introducing preferences
The more you edit video, the more you’ll want to customize Premiere Pro to match 
your specific needs. There are several types of preferences, all grouped into one 
panel for easy access. Preferences will be covered in depth as they relate to the indi-
vidual lessons in this book. Let’s look at a simple one:
1 Choose Edit > Preferences > Appearance (Windows) or Premiere Pro > 
Preferences > Appearance (Mac OS).
2 Drag the Brightness slider to the left or right to suit your needs. When done, 
click OK, or click cancel to return to the default setting.
The default brightness is a neutral gray to help you see 
colors correctly.
E Tip: Notice as 
you approach the 
darkest setting, the 
text switches to white 
on gray. This is to 
accommodate those 
editors who work 
in editing bays in 
darkened rooms.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn about the following:
• Choosing project settings
• Choosing video rendering and playback settings
• Choosing video and audio display settings
• Choosing capture format settings
• Creating scratch disks
• Using sequence presets
• Customizing sequence settings
This lesson will take approximately 45 minutes.
Before you begin editing, you need to create a new project and choose 
some settings for your first sequence. If you’re not familiar with video 
and audio technology, all the options might be a little overwhelming. 
Luckily, Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 gives you easy shortcuts. Plus, the 
principles of video and sound reproduction are the same no matter 
what you’re creating.
It’s just a question of knowing what you want to do. To help you plan 
and manage your projects, this chapter contains quite a lot of informa-
tion about formats and video technology. You may decide to revisit 
this chapter later, as your familiarity with Adobe Premiere Pro grows.
In practice, you are likely to make very few changes to the default set-
tings, but it’s good to know what all the options mean.

In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create a new 
project and choose sequence settings that tell 
Adobe Premiere Pro how to play your clips.

26 
lesson 2 
setting Up a Project
Getting started
An Adobe Premiere Pro project file stores links to all the video and sound files—aka 
clips—used in your Adobe Premiere Pro project. A project file also has at least one 
sequence—that is, a series of clips that play, one after another, with special effects, 
titles, and sound, to form your completed creative work. You’ll choose which parts 
of your clips to use and in which order they’ll play. The beauty of editing with Adobe 
Premiere Pro is that you can change your mind about almost anything.
Remember that Adobe Premiere Pro project files have the file extension .prproj.
Video and audio clips in a sequence play in order as a completed edit.
Most often, starting a new Adobe Premiere Pro project is simple. You create a new 
project, choose a sequence preset, and get on with editing.
When you create a new project, Adobe Premiere Pro invites you 
to create a sequence. It’s important to understand how sequence 
settings change the way Adobe Premiere Pro plays your video 
and audio clips. You can change the settings selected by a preset 
if it is almost, but not exactly, what you want.
You need to know the kind of video and audio your camera 
records because your sequence settings will usually be based on your original source 
clips. To make it easier for you to choose the right settings, Adobe Premiere Pro 
sequence presets are named after different camera recording formats, so if you 
know the video format that your camera records, you’ll know what to choose.
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to create a new  project 
and choose sequence settings that tell Adobe Premiere 
Pro how to play your clips. You’ll also learn about dif-
ferent kinds of audio tracks, what preview files are, and 
how to open projects created in Apple Final Cut Pro 7 
and Avid Media Composer.
P Note: Many of the 
terms used in Adobe 
Premiere Pro come 
from film editing, 
including the term 
clip. In traditional film 
editing, film editors cut 
a piece of celluloid with 
a clipper and then put 
the piece aside for use 
in the edit.
P Note: Presets 
preselect several 
settings, saving you 
time. You can use an 
existing sequence 
preset or create a new 
one for use next time.

setting up a project
Let’s begin by creating a new project.
1 Launch Adobe Premiere Pro. The Welcome screen appears.
Recent Projects is a list of previously opened projects. If this is your first time 
launching Adobe Premiere Pro, it will be blank.
There are four buttons in this window:
• New Project: Opens the New Project dialog.
• Open Project: Lets you browse to an existing project file and open it to 
continue working on it.
• Help: Opens the online Help system. You’ll need to be connected to the 
Internet to access online Adobe Premiere Pro Help.
• Exit: Exits Adobe Premiere Pro.

lesson 2 
setting Up a Project
2 Click New Project to open the New Project dialog.
This dialog has two tabs: General and Scratch Disks. All of the settings in this dia-
log can be changed later. In most cases, you’ll want to leave them as they are. Let’s 
take a look at what they mean.
Video rendering and playback settings
While working creatively with video clips in your sequences, it’s likely you’ll apply 
some visual effects. Some special effects can be played immediately, combining 
your original video with the effect and displaying the results as soon as you click 
Play. When this happens, it’s called real-time playback.
Real-time playback is desirable because it means you can watch the results of 
your creative choices right away. Many special effects in Adobe Premiere Pro are 
designed to be in real time.
If you use lots of effects or if you use effects that are not designed to be played in 
real time, your computer may not be able to display the results at the full frame rate. 
That is, Adobe Premiere Pro will attempt to display your video clips, combined with 
the special effects, but it will not show every single frame each second. When this 
happens, it is described as dropping frames.
P Note: You’ll notice 
that tabbed panels and 
dialogs appear a lot in 
Adobe Premiere Pro. 
They are a useful way of 
packing extra options 
into a smaller space.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 29
What do rendering and 
real time actually mean?
Think of rendering as an artist’s rendering, where something is visualized, taking up 
paper and taking time. Imagine you have a piece of video that is too dark. You add 
a special effect to make it brighter, but your video-editing system is unable to both 
play the original video and make it brighter. In this situation, you’d have your system 
render the effect. When this happens, a new video file is created that looks like your 
original video combined with the special effect to make it brighter.
When the part of your sequence is played that contains the clip with the rendered 
effect, your system invisibly, and seamlessly, switches to playing the newly rendered 
video file instead. That file plays back like any other regular file. Although it looks 
like your original video with an effect on it, it’s actually just a simple video clip that 
plays back normally.
When the part of your sequence with the brightened clip is finished, your system 
invisibly, and seamlessly, switches back to playing your other original video files.
The downside with rendering is that it takes up extra space on your hard drive, and 
it takes time. It also means you are viewing a new video file, based on your original 
media, and that might introduce some loss of quality. The upside with rendering is 
that you can be confident your system will be able to play the results of your effect 
at full quality, with all the frames per second.
Real-time is...instant! When using a real-time special effect, your system plays the 
original video clip combined with the special effect right away, without waiting for 
it to render. The only downside with real-time performance is that the amount you 
can do without rendering depends on how powerful your system is. In the case 
of Adobe Premiere Pro, you can dramatically improve real-time performance by 
using the right graphics card (see “The Mercury Playback Engine GPU Acceleration 
[CUDA]” on the next page). Plus, you’ll need to use effects that are designed for real-
time playback—and not all effects are.
Adobe Premiere Pro displays colored lines along the top of the Timeline panel to tell 
you when extra work is required to play back your video.
Not seeing every frame when you play your sequence is OK! It won’t affect the final 
results. When you’re done editing and you output your finished sequence (more on 
that in Chapter 18, “Exporting Frames, Clips, and Sequences”), it’ll be full quality, 
with all the frames. However, it can make a difference to your editing experience 

30 
lesson 2 
setting Up a Project
and your ability to preview the effects you apply with confidence. There is a simple 
solution: rendering.
When you choose to render, Adobe Premiere Pro produces a new video file that 
looks exactly like the part of your sequence you have selected—known as the work 
area—with all the special effects applied. Every time that part of your sequence 
is played, Adobe Premiere Pro automatically, and invisibly, switches to the new 
video file and plays that instead. When that part of your sequence finishes, Adobe 
Premiere Pro invisibly switches back to playing the next clips in your sequence.
This means Adobe Premiere Pro can play back the results of your special effects at 
full quality, and at full frame rate, without your computer having to do any more 
work than playing a regular video file.
In practice, telling Adobe Premiere 
Pro to render is as simple as pressing 
a single key on your keyboard (the 
Enter key) or choosing an option in a menu.
If the Renderer menu is available, it means you have the right graphics hardware for 
GPU Acceleration in your computer and it is installed correctly.
You’ll see two options:
• Mercury Playback Engine GPU Acceleration (CUDA): If you choose this 
option, Adobe Premiere Pro will send many playback tasks to the graphics 
hardware on your computer, giving you lots of real-time effects and easy 
playback of mixed formats in your sequences.
• Mercury Playback Engine Software Only: This is still a major advancement 
on non-real-time playback, giving you excellent performance that uses all of the 
available power in your computer. If you don’t have the right graphics hardware 
on your computer, only this option is available, and you won’t be able to click 
this menu.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 31
You can achieve much better performance by choosing GPU Acceleration, if you 
have a compatible graphics card. It allows Adobe Premiere Pro to give some of the 
work of playing back video and applying visual effects to the GPU.
You will almost certainly want to choose the GPU option and benefit from the 
additional performance if you can.
Do so now, if the option is available.
the mercury Playback engine
With Adobe Premiere Pro CS5, Adobe introduced a playback engine called Mercury. 
The Mercury Playback Engine dramatically improved playback performance, making 
it faster and easier than ever to work with multiple video formats, multiple special 
effects, and multiple layers of video (for effects such as picture-in-picture).
The Mercury Playback Engine was enhanced with version CS5.5 and again with ver-
sion CS6. It has three main features:
• 
Playback performance: The way Adobe Premiere Pro plays back video files 
was improved, especially for some of the types of video that are really difficult 
to play back. If you’re filming with a DSLR camera, for example, chances are 
your media is recorded using the H.264 codec, which is particularly hard to play 
back. With the new Mercury Playback Engine, you’ll find these files play back 
with ease.
• 
64-bit and multithreading: Adobe Premiere Pro is a 64-bit application, which 
simply means it can use all of the random access memory (RAM) on your 
computer. This is particularly useful when you’re working with very high-
resolution video. The Mercury Playback Engine is also multithreaded, which 
means it uses all of the CPU cores in your computer. The more powerful your 
computer is, the more performance you get in Adobe Premiere Pro.
• 
CUDA and Open CL support: If you have the right graphics card or an Apple 
MacBook Pro laptop with the right graphics hardware, Adobe Premiere Pro can 
delegate some of the work for playing back video to the graphics card, rather 
than putting the entire processing burden on the CPU in your computer. The 
result is even better performance and responsiveness when working with your 
sequences and lots of special effects that will play in real time.
For a list of supported graphics cards, see www.adobe.com/products/premiere/ 
tech-specs.html.

32 
lesson 2 
setting Up a Project
Video/audio Display format settings
The next two options tell Adobe Premiere Pro how to measure time for your video 
and audio clips.
In most cases, you’ll choose the default options: Timecode for video and Samples 
for Audio. These settings don’t change the way Adobe Premiere Pro plays video or 
audio clips, only the way time is measured.
about seconds and frames
When a camera records video, it captures a series of still images of the action. If 
there are enough images captured each second, it looks like moving video when 
played back. Each picture is called a frame, and the number of frames each second is 
usually called frames per second (fps).
The fps will vary depending on your camera format and settings. It could be 23.976, 
24, 25, 29.97, 50, or 59.94fps. Some cameras allow you to choose between more 
than one frame rate, with different options for accompanying frame sizes.
Adobe Premiere Pro will play back video at all common frame rates.
Video Display format
There are four options for Video Display Format. The correct choice for a given 
project largely depends on whether you are working with video or film as your 
source material.
The choices are as follows:
• Timecode: This is the 
default option. Timecode 
is a universal standard for 
counting hours, minutes, 
seconds, and individual frames for video files or tape. The same system is used by 
cameras, professional video recorders, and nonlinear editing systems all around 
the world.
• Feet + Frames 16mm or Feet + Frames 35mm: If your source files are 
captured from film and you intend to give your editing decisions to a lab so they 
can cut the original negative to produce a finished film, you may want to use 
this standard method of measuring time. Rather than measuring time, it’s the 
number of feet plus the number of frames since the last foot. It’s a bit like feet 
and inches but with frames rather than inches. Because 16mm film and 35mm 
film have different-sized frames (and so different numbers of frames per foot), 
there is an option for each.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 33
• Frames: This option simply counts the number of frames of video, starting at 0. 
This is sometimes used for animation projects and is another way that labs like 
to receive information about edits for a film-based project.
For this exercise, leave Video Display Format set to Timecode.
audio display format
When playing audio files, time can be displayed as samples or milliseconds.
• Audio Samples: When 
digital audio is recorded, 
a sound sample is taken, 
as captured by the 
microphone, thousands 
of times a second. In the case of most professional video cameras, this happens 
48,000 times per second. In Audio Samples mode, Adobe Premiere Pro will 
display time in your sequences as hours, minutes, seconds, and samples. The 
number of samples per second will depend on your sequence settings.
• Milliseconds: With this mode selected, Adobe Premiere Pro will display time in 
your sequences as hours, minutes, seconds, and thousandths of a second.
By default, Premiere Pro lets you zoom in to your sequences to view individual 
frames. However, you can easily switch to displaying your audio display format. This 
powerful feature lets you make the tiniest adjustments to your sound.
For this project, leave the Audio Display Format option set to Audio Samples.
Capture format settings
The Capture Format settings menu tells Adobe Premiere Pro what format to use 
when recording video to your hard drive from videotape.
DV and hDV capture
Without additional third-party hardware, Adobe Premiere Pro can record from DV 
and HDV cameras using the FireWire connection on your computer, if it has one. 
FireWire is also known as IEEE 1394 and i.Link.
FireWire is a convenient connection for tape-based media because it uses just one 
cable to transmit video and sound information, device control (so your computer 
can tell the video deck to play, fast-forward, pause, and so on), and timecode.

34 
lesson 2 
setting Up a Project
third-party hardware capture
Not all video decks use a FireWire connection, so you may need additional third-
party hardware installed to be able to connect your video deck for capture.
If you have additional hardware, you should follow the directions provided by the 
manufacturer to install it. Most likely you’ll install software supplied with your 
hardware, and this will discover Adobe Premiere Pro is installed on your computer, 
automatically adding extra options to this menu (and others).
Follow the directions provided with your third-party equipment to configure new 
Adobe Premiere Pro projects.
For more information about video capture hardware and video formats supported 
by Adobe Premiere Pro, visit www.adobe.com/products/premiere/extend.html.
Ignore this setting for now because we will not be capturing from a tape deck in 
this exercise, and the setting can be changed at any time.
scratch Disks settings
Whenever Adobe Premiere Pro captures (records) from tapes or renders your spe-
cial effects, new media files are created on your hard drive.
Scratch disks are the places 
these new files are stored. 
They can be separate disks, 
as the name suggests, or any 
file storage locations. Scratch 
disks can be created all in 
the same place or in separate locations, depending on your hardware and workflow 
requirements. If you’re working with really large media files, you may get a perfor-
mance boost by putting all of your scratch disks on different hard drives.
There are generally two approaches to storage for video editing:
• Project-based setup: All associated media files are stored with the project file 
in the same folder.
• System-based setup: Media files associated with multiple projects are saved to 
one central location, and the project file is saved to another.
using a project-based setup
By default, Adobe Premiere Pro keeps any newly created media together with the 
project file (this is the Same as Project option). Keeping everything together this 
way makes finding associated files simple. You can stay even more organized by 
moving any media files you intend to import into your project into the same folder 
before you import them. When you’re finished with your project, you can remove 
everything from your system by deleting the folder your project file is stored in.

Playback Engine can

video capture cards

to Adobe Mercury 
Transmit—a new 
feature in CS6.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 35
using a system-based setup
Some editors prefer to have all of their media stored in a single location. Others 
choose to store their capture folders and preview folders in a different location 
from their project. This is a common choice in editing facilities where multiple 
editors share multiple editing systems, all connected to the same storage drives. It’s 
also common among editors who have one very fast hard drive for video media and 
a slower hard drive for everything else.
typical drive setup and 
network-based storage
Although all file types can coexist on a single hard drive, a typical editing system will 
have two hard drives: drive 1, dedicated to the operating system and programs, and 
drive 2 (often a faster drive), dedicated to footage items, including captured video 
and audio, video and audio previews, still images, and exported media.
Some storage systems use local computer networks to share storage between mul-
tiple systems. If this is the case for your Adobe Premiere Pro setup, check with your 
system administrators to make sure you have the right settings.
For this project, we recommend you leave your scratch disks all set to the default 
option: Same as Project.
1 Click in the Name: box and give your new project the name Lesson 02-01.
2 Click the Browse button; then choose a preferred location on your computer 
hard drive for these lessons.
3 If your project is set up correctly, the General and Scratch Disks tabs in your 
New Project window should look identical to the screen shown here. If the 
settings match, click OK to create the project file.
P Note: When 
choosing a location for 
your project file, you 
might be able to choose 
a recently used location 
from the drop-down 
menu.

lesson 2 
setting Up a Project
setting up a sequence
Immediately after you create your project, you’ll see another dialog box prompting 
you to set parameters for your first sequence. Adobe Premiere Pro always assumes 
you want at least one sequence, so you are prompted to create one when starting a 
new project. Adobe Premiere Pro adapts video and audio clips that you put into a 
sequence so they match the settings for that sequence. Each sequence in your proj-
ect can have different settings, and you’ll want to choose settings that match your 
original media as precisely as possible. Doing so reduces the work your system must 
do to play back your clips, improves real-time performance, and maximizes quality.
The New Sequence dialog has three tabs: Sequence Presets, Settings, and Tracks. 
We’ll start with Sequence Presets.
sequence Presets tab
The Sequence Presets tab makes setting up a new sequence much easier. When you 
choose a preset, Adobe Premiere Pro chooses settings for your sequence that closely 
match a particular video and audio format. After choosing a preset, you can tweak 
these settings on the Settings tab.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 37
You’ll find a wide range of preset configuration options for the most commonly 
used and supported media types. These settings are organized based on camera 
formats (with specific settings inside a folder named after the recording format).
Click the disclosure triangle to see specific settings in a group. These settings are 
typically designed around frame rates and frame sizes. Let’s look at an example.
1 Click the disclosure triangle next to the group DVCPROHD.
You can now see three subfolders, based on frame sizes 
and interlacing methods. Remember, video cameras can 
often shoot video using different-sized flavors of HD, as 
well as frame rates and recording methods. The media 
used for the next exercise will be DVCPRO HD at 720p 
and a frame rate of 24fps.
2 Click the disclosure triangle next to the 720p 
subgroup.
3 To best match the footage we’ll be using, 
choose the DVCPROHD 720p24 preset by 
clicking its name.
Choosing the correct preset
When starting out in video editing, you may find the number of formats available 
a little overwhelming. Adobe Premiere Pro can play back and work with a very wide 
range of video and audio formats and will often play back mismatched formats 
smoothly.
However, when Adobe Premiere Pro has to adjust video for playback because of 
mismatched sequence settings, your editing system must expend extra effort to 
play the video, and this will impact real-time performance. It’s worthwhile to take 
the time before you start editing to make sure you have sequence settings that 
closely match your original media files. You’ll notice that all of the presets are based 
on types of camera to make it easier to select the right one.
The essential factors are always the same: the number of frames per second, the 
frame size (the number of pixels in the picture), and the codec. If you were to turn 
your sequence into a file, then the frame rate, audio format, frame size, and so on, 
would all match the settings you choose here.
When you output to a file, you can choose any export format you like (for more on 
exporting, see Chapter 18, “Exporting Frames, Clips, and Sequences”).
P Note: The Preset 
Description area of the 
Sequence Presets tab 
often describes the 
kind of camera used to 
capture media in this 
format.
E Tip: If your system 
has additional third-
party hardware for 
capture and playback, 
you may find you have 
additional sequence 
presets available.

setting Up a Project
settings tab
Once you’ve selected the sequence preset that most closely matches your source 
video, you may want to adjust the settings to suit the specifics of your sequence.
To begin making adjustments, you would click the Settings tab and choose any 
options that better suit the way you would like Adobe Premiere Pro to conform 
your video and audio files for playback. Remember, Adobe Premiere Pro will 
automatically adapt footage you add to your Timeline so that it matches your 
sequence settings, giving you a standard frame rate and frame size, regardless of 
the original format.
You will notice some settings cannot be changed when you use a preset. This is 
because they are optimized for the media type you selected on the Preset tab. To 
have complete flexibility, change the Editing Mode menu to Custom, and you will 
be able to change all of the available options.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 39
The Settings tab allows you to customize the individual settings of a preset. If 
your media matches one of the presets, it’s not necessary to make changes on the 
Settings tab. In fact, it’s recommended that you do not.
For now, leave the settings alone, but examine how the preset is going to configure 
the new sequence. Look at each setting from top to bottom on the tab to get familiar 
with all of the choices required to properly configure a video-editing sequence.
maximum bit depth and 
maximum render quality
If you enable Maximum Bit Depth, Adobe Premiere Pro can render special effects 
at the maximum quality possible. For many effects, this means 32-bit floating-point 
color, which allows for trillions of color combinations. This is the best possible 
quality for your effects but requires more work for your computer, so expect less 
real-time performance if you enable it.
If you enable Maximum Render Quality or if you have GPU acceleration, Adobe 
Premiere Pro uses a more advanced system for scaling images smaller. Without this 
option, you might see artifacts or noise in the picture when making images smaller. 
Without GPU acceleration, this option will impact performance.
Both of these options can be turned off or on at any time, so you can edit without 
them and then turn them on when you output your finished work. Even with both 
options on, you can use real-time effects and get good performance from Adobe 
Premiere Pro.
Custom presets
While the standard presets usually fit, you may need to create a custom setting. 
To do so, first choose a sequence preset that matches your media closely and then 
make custom selections in the Settings tab. You can save your custom preset by 
clicking the Save Preset button near the bottom of the Settings tab. Give your cus-
tomized project settings preset a name in the Save Settings dialog, add notes if you 
want, and click OK. The preset will appear in the Custom folder under Available 
Presets.
If you use an Apple Macintosh and have the Apple ProRes codec installed, you 
can use this as your preview file codec. Choose a custom editing mode, and then 
choose QuickTime as your preview file format and Apple ProRes as your codec.

40 
lesson 2 
setting Up a Project
formats and codecs
Video file types like Apple QuickTime and Microsoft AVI are containers that can 
carry many different video and audio codecs. The file is referred to as the wrapper, 
and the codec is referred to as the essence.
Codec is a shortening of compressor/decompressor. It is the way video and audio 
information is stored.
If you output your finished sequence to a file, you’ll choose both a file type and 
a codec.
tracks tab
When you add a video or audio clip to a sequence, you’ll put it on a track. Tracks are 
horizontal areas in the sequence that hold clips in a specific position in time. If you 
have more than one video track, any video placed on an upper track will be in front 
of clips on a lower track (if they occupy the same moment in time). So, if you have 
text or a graphic on your second video track and video on your first video track, 
you’ll see a composite of both.
All your audio tracks are played at the same time. This makes it easy to create an 
audio mix. You simply position your audio clips on different tracks, lined up in 
time. Narration, sound bites, sound effects, and music can be organized by putting 
them on dedicated tracks, making it easier to find your way around your sequence.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 41
Adobe Premiere Pro lets you specify how many video and audio tracks will be added 
when the sequence is created. You can add and remove audio or video tracks later, 
but you can’t change your Audio Master setting.
You can choose from several audio track types. Each track type is designed for you 
to add specific types of audio file. When you choose a particular track type, Adobe 
Premiere Pro gives you the right controls to make adjustments to the sound.
When you add a clip to a sequence that has both video and audio, Adobe Premiere 
Pro makes sure the audio part goes to the right kind of track. You can’t accidentally 
put an audio clip on the wrong track; Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically create 
the right kind of track if one doesn’t exist.
Let’s take a quick overview of each type (we’ll explore audio more in Chapter 11, 
“Editing and Mixing Audio”).
P Note: After a 
sequence is created, 
you can’t change 
the Audio Master 
setting. This setting is 
for choosing mono, 
stereo, 5.1-, or multi-
channel output. For 
the purposes of these 
lessons, we’ll choose 
Stereo. If you are new to 
video editing, it’s likely 
you’ll want to choose 
Stereo for the majority 
of your projects. The 
other options are 
used for advanced 
professional workflows 
such as surround-sound 
mixing for feature films.

42 
lesson 2 
setting Up a Project
audio tracks
Audio tracks are the horizontal areas where you’ll put your audio clips. The types of 
audio tracks available in Adobe Premiere Pro are as follows:
• Standard: These tracks can take both mono and stereo 
audio clips.
• 5.1: These tracks can take only audio clips with 5.1 audio 
(the kind used for surround sound).
• Adaptive: This track type is new in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6. Adaptive tracks 
will take both mono and stereo audio.
• Mono: This track type will take only mono audio clips.
submixes
Submixes are a special feature of the audio finishing tools in Adobe Premiere Pro 
CS6. You can send the output from a track in your sequence to a submix, rather than 
directly to the master output. If you do this, you can then use the submix to apply 
special audio effects and make changes to the volume. This may not seem so useful 
for a single track, but you can send as many regular audio tracks as you like to a 
single submix. That means you could have, for example, ten audio tracks controlled 
by a single submix. Put simply, this means far less clicking and much more action.
Your submix options are as follows:
• Stereo Submix: For submixing stereo tracks
• 5.1 Submix: For submixing 5.1 tracks
• Adaptive Submix: For submixing mono or stereo tracks
• Mono Submix: For submixing mono tracks
For this first sequence, we’ll use the default settings. Be sure to take a moment, 
though, to click the available options to familiarize yourself with the available 
choices.
1 For now, click into the Sequence Name box and call your sequence First 
Sequence.
2 Click OK to create the sequence.
3 Choose File > Save. Congratulations! You have made a new project and sequence 
with Adobe Premiere Pro.
If you have not already copied the media and project files to your computer, 
please do so now (you’ll find instructions in the introduction to this book).

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 43
Importing final Cut Pro projects
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 can import and export sequences and links to media files 
using Final Cut Pro 7 XML. XML files store information about editing decisions in a 
way that can be understood by both Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere Pro.
This makes it ideal for sharing creative work between both applications.
exporting an xmL file from final Cut Pro 7
You’ll need to open the Final Cut Pro project file in Final Cut Pro to create an XML 
file. When you import the XML file to Adobe Premiere Pro, you’ll need the media files 
used by Final Cut Pro. Adobe Premiere Pro can share the same files.
1 
Open the existing project in Final Cut Pro.
2 
Either choose nothing in the project, in which case you’ll export the whole 
project, or select some specific items, in which case only those will be included.
3 
Choose File > Export > XML.
In the XML dialog you’ll see a report of how many bins, clips, and sequences 
are selected.
4 
Choose the Apple XML Interchange Format, version 4 option for maximum 
compatibility with Adobe Premiere Pro.
5 
Save the XML file in an easy-to-find location (such as with your project).
Importing a final Cut Pro 7 xmL file
You import a Final Cut Pro 7 XML file into Adobe Premiere Pro just like any other 
kind of file (for more detail, see Chapter 3, “Importing Media”). When you import 
an XML file, Adobe Premiere Pro guides you through connecting the sequence and 
clip information to the original media files used by Final Cut Pro. There is a limit to 
the amount of information Final Cut Pro will include in an XML file, so you will find 
proprietary effects (such as color correction) will not make it to Adobe Premiere Pro. 
Test this workflow before you depend upon it.
media best practice
If you intend to work with both Final Cut Pro and Adobe Premiere Pro, you’ll want to 
use a media format that both editing systems can work with easily. Adobe Premiere 
Pro has wide-ranging support for media formats and can easily work with Final Cut 
Pro ProRes media files.
For this reason, it’s best to use Final Cut Pro to import your media and capture video 
from tapes. You can set up your project using ProRes media in Final Cut Pro and then 
easily exchange projects with Adobe Premiere Pro.
See www.adobe.com/products/premiere/extend.html for more information about 
sharing projects with Final Cut Pro.

lesson 2 
setting Up a Project
Importing avid media Composer projects
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 can import and export sequences and links to media files using AAF files 
exported from Avid Media Composer. AAF files store information about editing decisions in a way that 
can be understood by both Avid and Adobe Premiere Pro.
This makes it ideal for sharing creative work between both applications.
exporting an aaf file from avid media Composer
You’ll need to open the Avid project file in Avid Media Composer to create an AAF file. When 
you import the AAF file to Adobe Premiere Pro, you’ll need the media files used by Avid Media 
Composer—Adobe Premiere Pro can share the same files.
1 
Open an existing project in Media Composer.
2 
Choose the sequence you’d like to transfer.
3 
Choose File > Export. Click the Options button.
In the standard Avid Export dialog, there’s a menu at the bottom that contains templates. The 
Options button at the bottom allows customization.
4 
From the Export Settings dialog, choose the following:
• 
Select AAF Edit Protocol.
• 
Include all video tracks in the sequence.
• 
Include all audio tracks in the sequence.
• 
On the Video Details tab for Export Method, choose Link to (Don’t Export) Media.
• 
On the Audio Details tab for Export Method, choose Link to (Don’t Export) Media.
• 
On the Audio Details tab, select Include Rendered Audio Effects.
• 
(Optional.) Include marks—export only between In/Out points.
• 
(Optional.) Use enabled tracks.
5 
Save the AAF file in an easy-to-find location.
Importing an avid aaf file
You import an Avid AAF file like any other kind of file (see Chapter 3). When you import an AAF file, 
Adobe Premiere Pro guides you through connecting the sequence and clip information to the original 
media files used by Avid. There is a limit to the amount of information Avid will include in an AAF file, 
so you will find that proprietary effects (such as color correction) will not make it to Adobe Premiere 
Pro. Test this workflow before you rely upon it.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 45
Creating a sequence that automatically 
matches your source
If you’re not sure what sequence preset you should choose, don’t worry. Adobe 
Premiere Pro has a special shortcut to create a sequence based on your original 
media.
At the bottom of the Project panel, there is a New Item menu button 
. You can 
use this menu to create new items such as sequences and titles.
To automatically create a sequence that matches your media, drag and drop any 
clip in the Project panel onto this New Item menu button.
Adobe Premiere Pro creates a new sequence with the same name as the clip and a 
matching frame size and frame rate. Now you’re ready to start editing, and you can 
be confident your sequence settings will work.
E Tip: If the first clip 
you add to a sequence 
does not match the 
playback settings of 
your sequence, Adobe 
Premiere Pro asks if you 
would like to change 
the sequence settings 
automatically to fit.
Importing avid media Composer projects (continued)
media best practice
Avid Media Composer uses a media management system that’s completely different from the Adobe 
Premiere Pro system. However, since version 3.5 of Media Composer, a new system called AMA has 
permitted linking to media outside of Avid’s own media organizational system. Media files imported 
to Avid Media Composer using AMA tend to relink better when an AAF file is imported into Adobe 
Premiere Pro. Media in an Avid Media Composer AMA folder can be anything that Apple QuickTime 
can play, including P2, XDCAM, and even RED. You’ll need to have the appropriate codec available on 
your Adobe Premiere Pro editing system.
You will usually achieve the best results if you use Avid Media Composer’s AMA system to link to origi-
nal media with P2 or XDCAM media.
See www.adobe.com/products/premiere/extend.html for more information about sharing projects with 
Avid Media Composer.

1 What is the purpose of the Settings tab in the New Sequence dialog?
2 How should you choose a sequence preset?
3 What is timecode?
4 How do you create a custom sequence preset?
5 What capture settings are available inside Adobe Premiere Pro with no additional 
hardware?
review answers
1 The Settings tab is used to customize an existing preset or to create a new custom 
preset. If you’re using a standard media type, a sequence preset is all you should need 
to select.
2 It’s generally best to choose a preset that matches your original footage. Adobe 
Premiere Pro makes this easy by describing the presets in terms of camera systems.
3 Timecode is a universal professional system for measuring time in hours, minutes, 
seconds, and frames. The number of frames per second varies depending on the 
recording format.
4 When you’ve selected the settings you want for your custom preset, click the Save 
Preset button, give a name and a description, and click OK.
5 Adobe Premiere Pro records DV and HDV files if you have a FireWire connection on 
your computer. If you have additional connections via installed hardware, consult the 
documentation for that hardware for the best settings.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn about the following:
• Using the Media Browser to load video files
• Using the Import command to load graphic files
• Choosing where to place cache files
• Capturing from tape
This lesson will take approximately 75 minutes.

49
To edit your video assets, you need to first get the 
sources into your project. Because Adobe Premiere 
Pro can work with so many types of assets, there are 
multiple methods for browsing and importing media.

50 
lesson 3 
importing media
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll learn to import media assets into Adobe Premiere Pro CS6. 
For most files, you will use the Adobe Media Browser—a robust asset browser that 
works with all the media types you may need to import into Adobe Premiere Pro. 
You’ll also learn about special cases such as importing graphics or capturing from 
videotape.
For this lesson, you’ll use the project file you set up in Lesson 2.
1 Continue to work with the project file from the previous lesson, or open it 
from your hard drive.
2 Choose File > Save As.
3 Rename the file to Lesson 03.prproj.
4 Choose a preferred location on your hard drive, and click Save to save 
the project.
If you do not have the previous lesson file, you can open the file Lesson 
03.prproj from the Lesson 03 folder.
Importing assets
When you import items into an Adobe Premiere Pro project, you are creating a 
link from the original media to a pointer that lives inside your project. This means 
you are not actually modifying the original files; you’re just manipulating them in 
a nondestructive manner. For example, if you choose to edit only part of a clip into 
your sequence, you’re not throwing away the unused media.
You’ll import media into Adobe Premiere Pro in two principal ways:
• Standard importing by choosing File > Import
• By using the Media Browser panel
Let’s explore the benefits of each.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 51
When to use the Import command
Using the Import command is straightforward (and may match what you’re used to 
from other applications). To import any file, just choose File > Import. You can also 
use the keyboard shortcuts, Control+I (Windows) or Command+I (Mac OS), to 
open the standard Import dialog.
This method works best for self-contained assets such as graphics and audio, 
especially if you know exactly where those assets are on your drive and you want 
to quickly navigate to them. This importing method is not ideal for camera format 
files, which often use complex folder structures with separate files for audio and 
video. For camera-originated media, you’ll instead rely on the Media Browser.
E Tip: Another way to 
open the Import dialog 
box is to simply double-
click an empty area of 
the Project panel.

52 
lesson 3 
importing media
When to use the media Browser
The Media Browser is a robust tool for reviewing your media assets and then 
importing them into Adobe Premiere Pro. The Media Browser is designed to 
properly show you media formats acquired by modern digital video cameras and 
can convert the complex camera folder structures into easy-to-browse icons and 
metadata. Being able to see this metadata (which contains important information 
such as duration, date, and file type) makes it far easier to select the correct clip 
from long lists of files or shots.
By default, you’ll find the Media Browser in the lower-left corner of your Adobe 
Premiere Pro workspace (if your workspace is set to Editing). It’s docked in the 
same frame as the Project panel. You can also quickly access the Media Browser by 
pressing Shift+8.
You can position the Media Browser elsewhere on-screen by dragging it, or you can 
undock it and make it a floating panel by clicking the submenu in the corner of the 
panel and choosing Undock Panel.
You’ll find that working in the Media Browser is not significantly different from 
browsing using your computer’s operating system. There are a series of navigation 
folders on the left side and standard up, down, left, and right arrows in the upper-
right corner to change levels of browsing. You can use the up and down arrows to 
select items within a list and the left- and right-arrow keys to move further along a 
file directory path (such as stepping into a folder to examine its contents).

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 53
Importing from adobe Prelude
A component of Adobe Creative Suite CS6 is Adobe Prelude, which you can use to organize footage 
in a simple, streamlined interface. The use of Adobe Prelude is beyond the scope of this book, but you 
will find extensive coverage in the component’s documentation on how to use it and best practices 
for organizing clips. Adobe Prelude is designed so producers or assistants can quickly ingest, log, and 
even transcode media for tapeless workflows.
If you have an Adobe Prelude project, here’s how to send it to Adobe Premiere Pro:
1 
Launch Adobe Prelude.
2 
Open the project you want to transfer.
3 
Switch to Adobe Premiere Pro and make sure the project you want to receive the media is open.
4 
Switch back to Adobe Prelude and click the 
Project panel.
5 
Select the individual clips you want to 
send by Control+clicking (Windows) or 
Command+clicking (Mac OS), or select all clips.
6 
Choose File > Send to Adobe Premiere Pro.
7 
Switch to Adobe Premiere Pro. The files should 
appear in the Project panel.
You can now quit Adobe Prelude and close the 
project.

54 
lesson 3 
importing media
The major benefits of the Media Browser include the following:
• Narrowing the display to a specific file type, such as JPEG, Photoshop, XML, 
AAF, and more.
• Autosensing camera data—AVCHD, Canon XF, P2, RED, ARRIRAW, Sony 
HDV, and XDCAM (EX and HD).
• Viewing and customizing the display of metadata associated with your clips.
• Correctly displaying media that has spanned clips across multiple camera 
media cards. This is common in professional cameras, and Adobe Premiere Pro 
will import the files as a single clip, even if two cards were used to record the 
longer file.
Working with the media Browser
The Media Browser in Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to easily browse for files on 
your computer. It can also stay open all the time, giving you immediate access to 
the media files on your hard drive. It’s fast and convenient and highly optimized for 
locating and importing footage.
P Note: To complete this lesson, you will be importing files from your computer. Be sure you have 
copied the entire DVD included with this book to your computer. For more details, see the “Getting 
Started” section in the front of the book.
using a tapeless workflow
A tapeless workflow (also known as a file-based workflow) is simply the process 
of importing video from a tapeless camera, editing it, and exporting it. Adobe 
Premiere Pro makes this especially easy because, unlike many competing nonlin-
ear editing systems, Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 does not require the media from 
these tapeless formats to be converted before editing. Adobe Premiere Pro can edit 
tapeless formats (such as P2, XDCAM, AVCHD, and even DSLRs that shoot video) 
natively with no conversions.
For best results when working with your own camera media, follow these 
guidelines:
1 Create a new folder for each project.
2 Copy the camera media to your editing hard drive (being sure to keep the 
existing folder structure intact). Be sure to transfer the complete data folder 
directly from the root directory of the card. You can also use a transfer 
E Tip: If you need to 
use assets from another 
Adobe Premiere Pro 
project, you can import 
that project into your 
current one. Just use 
the Media Browser to 
locate it; then drag 
it into your current 
project.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 55
application that is often included by the camera manufacturer to move your 
video clips for best results. Be sure to visually inspect it to ensure that all media 
files have been copied and that the card and new folder sizes match.
3 Clearly label the folder of the media with the camera information including card 
number and date of shoot.
4 Create a second copy of the cards on a second drive.
5 Ideally, create a long-term archive using another backup method such as Blu-ray 
Disc, LTO tape, and so on.
supported video file types
It’s not unusual to work on a project and end up with video clips from different 
cameras using different file formats. This is no problem for Adobe Premiere Pro 
because you can mix clips of different frame sizes on the same Timeline. The Media 
Browser can see just about any file format. It is particularly well suited for native 
support for tapeless formats.
The major tapeless formats supported by Adobe Premiere Pro include the 
following:
• Any DSLR camera that shoots H.264 directly as a .mov or .mp4 file
• Panasonic P2 (DV, DVCPRO, DVCPRO 50, DVCPRO HD, AVC-Intra)
• RED ONE, RED EPIC, and the RED Mysterium X
• ARRIRAW
• XDCAM SD, XDCAM EX, XDCAM HD, and HD422
• Sony HDV (when shot on removable tapeless media)
• AVCHD cameras
• Canon XF

Lesson 3 
Importing Media
Finding assets with the Media Browser
The good news is that the Media Browser is pretty self-explanatory. In many 
ways, it’s like a web browser (it has forward and back buttons to go through your 
recent navigation). It also has a list of shortcuts on the side. Finding materials is 
pretty easy.
1 Work with the Lesson 03.prproj file from earlier. This project should have no 
assets imported yet.
2 Let’s reset the workspace to the default; choose Window > Workspace > Editing. 
Then choose Window > Workspace > Reset Current Workspace and click Yes.
3 Click the Media Browser (it should be docked with the Project panel by default). 
Make it larger by dragging its right edge to the right.
4 Using the Media Browser, navigate to the Lessons/Assets/Double Identity/
P2 MEDIA folder. You can open each folder by double-clicking.
5 Let’s make the Media Browser easier to see. Place your mouse pointer over the 
panel; then press the ` (grave) key. It is often in the upper-left corner of your 
keyboard.
The Media Browser panel should now fill the screen.
E Tip: Filter the assets 
you’re looking for by 
using the Files of Type 
menu in the Media 
Browser.
P Note: The Media 
Browser filters out 
nonmedia files, making 
it easier to browse for 
video or audio assets.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 57
6 Drag the resize slider in the lower-left corner of the Media Browser to enlarge 
the thumbnails of the clips. You can use any size you like.
7 Single-click the first clip in the bin to select it.
You can now preview the clip using keyboard shortcuts.
8 Press the L key to preview a clip forward.
9 To stop playback, press the K key.
10 Rewind the clip by pressing the J key.

58 
lesson 3 
importing media
11 Experiment with playing back other clips. If the volume of your computer is 
turned up, you should be able to hear the audio playback clearly.
You can also press the J or L key multiple times to increase the playback rate for 
fast previews. Use the K key or the spacebar to pause.
12 Let’s import all of these clips into our project. Press Control+A (Windows) or 
Command+A (Mac OS) to select all of the clips.
13 Right-click one of the selected clips and choose Import.
Alternately, you can drag all of the selected clips onto the Project panel’s tab and 
then down into the empty area to import the clips.
14 Switch back to the Project panel.
Importing images
Graphics have become an integral part of the modern video edit. People expect 
graphics to both convey information and add to the visual style of a final edit. 
Fortunately, Adobe Premiere Pro can import just about any image and graphic file 
type. Support is especially excellent when you use the native file formats created by 
Adobe’s leading graphic tools, Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Illustrator.
Importing flattened adobe Photoshop files
Anyone who works with print graphics or does photo retouching has probably 
used Adobe Photoshop. It is the workhorse of the graphic design industry. Adobe 
Photoshop is a powerful tool with great depth and versatility, and it is becoming 
an increasingly important part of the video production world. Let’s explore how to 
properly import two files from Adobe Photoshop.
To start, let’s import a basic Adobe Photoshop graphic:
1 Click the Project panel to select it.
2 Choose File > Import or press Control+I (Windows) or Command+I (Mac OS).

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 59
3 Navigate to Lessons/Lesson 03.
4 Select the file DoubleIdentity.psd, and click Import.
The graphic is a simple logo file and imports into the Adobe Premiere Pro 
project.
Importing layered adobe Photoshop files
Adobe Photoshop can also create graphics using multiple layers. Layers are similar 
to tracks in your Timeline and allow for separation between elements. These layers 
can be imported into Adobe Premiere Pro to allow for isolation or animation.
1 Double-click an empty area of the Project panel to open the Import dialog box.
2 Navigate to Lessons/Lesson 03.
3 Select the file Title_wLayers.psd, and click Import.
4 A new dialog opens, giving you 
a choice of how to interpret the 
layered file. There are four ways 
to import the file, controlled by 
a pop-up menu in the Import 
Layered File dialog box:
• Merge All Layers: Merges all 
layers, importing the file into 
Adobe Premiere Pro as a single, flattened clip.
• Merged Layers: Merges only the layers you select into Adobe Premiere Pro 
as a single, flattened clip.
• Individual Layers: Imports only the layers you select from the list into a 
bin, making one clip for each source layer.
• Sequence: Imports only the layers you select, each as a single clip. Adobe 
Premiere Pro also then creates a new sequence (with its frame size based 
on the imported document) containing each layer on a separate track (that 
matches the original stacking order).
Choosing Sequence or Individual  
Layers allows you to select one 
of the following options from 
the Footage Dimensions menu:
• Document Size: Brings the 
selected layer in at the size of the original Photoshop document.
• Layer Size: Matches the frame size of the clips to the frame size of their 
content in the original Photoshop file. Layers that do not fill the entire 
canvas may be cropped smaller as transparent areas are removed.

60 
lesson 3 
importing media
5 For this exercise, choose Sequence and use the Document Size option. Click OK.
6 Looking in the Project panel, locate the new bin Title_wLayers. Double-click to 
open it and to reveal its contents.
7 Double-click the sequence Title_wLayers to load it.
8 Examine the sequence in the Timeline panel. Try turning the visibility icons off 
and on for each track to see how the layers are isolated.
Image tips for adobe Photoshop files
Here are a few tips for importing images from Adobe Photoshop:
• 
You can import images up to 16 megapixels in size (4096 x 4096). Remember 
that when you import a layered Photoshop document as a sequence, the frame 
size will be the pixel dimensions of the document.
• 
If you don’t plan to zoom or pan, try to create files with a frame size at least as 
large as the frame size of the project. Otherwise, you have to scale up the image, 
and it will lose some of its sharpness.
• 
Importing overly large files uses more memory and can slow down your project.
• 
If you plan to zoom or pan, create images such that the zoomed or panned area 
has a frame size at least as large as the frame size of the project. For example, 
if you were working in 1080p and you wanted to do a 2X zoom, you’d need 
3840 x 2160 pixels.

Importing Adobe Illustrator files
Another graphics component in Adobe Creative Suite is Adobe Illustrator. Unlike 
Adobe Photoshop, which is primarily designed to work with pixel-based (or raster) 
graphics, Adobe Illustrator is a vector application. This means it is typically used 
for things such as technical illustrations, line art, and complex graphics that can be 
scaled infinitely inside Adobe Illustrator.
Let’s import a vector graphic.
1 Double-click an empty area of the Project panel to open the Import dialog box.
2 Navigate to Lessons/Lesson 03.
3 Select the file Lower_Third.ai, and click Import.
This file type is Adobe Illustrator Artwork. Here’s how Adobe Premiere Pro 
deals with Adobe Illustrator files:
• Like the Photoshop CS6 file you imported in the previous exercise, this is 
a layered graphic file. However, Adobe Premiere Pro doesn’t give you the 
option to import Adobe Illustrator files in separate layers. It merges them.
• It also uses a process called rasterization to convert the vector (path-based) 
Adobe Illustrator art into the pixel-based (raster) image format used by 
Adobe Premiere Pro. This conversion happens during the import stage, so 
be sure your graphics are large enough in Illustrator before importing into 
Adobe Premiere Pro.
• Adobe Premiere Pro automatically anti-aliases, or smoothes the edges of, 
the Adobe Illustrator art.
• Adobe Premiere Pro converts all empty areas into a transparent alpha 
channel so that clips below those areas on the Timeline can show through.
P Note: If you right-click Lower_Third.ai in the Project panel, you’ll note that one option is Edit 
Original. If you have Illustrator installed on your computer, selecting Edit Original will open this 
graphic in Illustrator, ready to be edited. So, even though the layers are merged in Adobe Premiere 
Pro, you can return to Adobe Illustrator, edit the original layered file, and save it, and the changes 
will immediately show up in Adobe Premiere Pro.

recording a scratch narration track
Many times, you may be working with a video project that has a narration track. While most choose 
to eventually get these recorded by professionals (or at least in a location quieter than their desks), 
you can still record a temporary track right into Adobe Premiere Pro. This can be helpful if you need 
something to edit your video to.
Here’s how to go about recording a scratch audio track:
1 
If you’re not using a built-in microphone, make sure your external microphone is properly 
connected to your computer. You may need to see the documentation for your computer or 
sound card.
2 
Choose Edit > Preferences > Audio Hardware (Windows) or Premiere Pro > Preferences > Audio 
Hardware (Mac OS) to properly configure your microphone so Adobe Premiere Pro can use it. Use 
one of the choices from the Default Device pop-up menu, such as System Default Input/Output or 
Built-in Microphone/Built-in Output, and click OK.
3 
Turn down the speakers on your computer to prevent feedback or echo.
4 
Open a sequence, and select an empty track in the Timeline.
5 
Choose the Audio Mixer (which is likely to be docked in the same frame as your Source Monitor).
6 
In the Audio Mixer, click the Enable Track For  
Recording icon (R) for the track you want to use 
for your audio device.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 63
recording a scratch narration track (continued)
7 
Choose the recording input channel from the Track Input Channel menu.
8 
Click the Record button at the bottom of the  
Audio Mixer to enter Record mode.
9 
Click the Play button to start recording.
10 If the levels are too loud or quiet, you can adjust the track volume slider up (louder) or down 
(quieter) as you record. If you see red indicators at the top of the VU meters light up, you likely 
have distortion. A good target to aim for is loud audio registering near 0 dB and quiet audio 
registering around −18 dB.
11 Click the Stop icon to stop recording.
12 Locate both instances of the recorded audio. The newly recorded audio appears both on the audio 
track in the Timeline and as a clip in the Project panel. You can select the clip in the Project panel 
and rename or delete it from your project.

64 
lesson 3 
importing media
the media cache
When you import certain video and audio formats, Adobe Premiere Pro may need to 
process and cache a version. This is particularly true for highly compressed formats. 
Imported audio files are conformed to a new .cfa file. Most MPEG files are indexed 
to a new .mpgindex file. You’ll know that the cache is being built if you see a small 
progress indicator in the lower-right corner of the screen when importing media.
The benefit of the media cache is that it greatly improves performance for previews. 
It does this by lessening the load on a computer’s CPU. You can fully customize the 
cache to further improve responsiveness. This media cache database is shared with 
Adobe Media Encoder, Adobe After Effects, Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe Encore, 
and Adobe Audition, so each of these applications can each read from and write to 
the same set of cached media files.
To access controls for the cache, choose Edit > Preferences > Media (Windows) or 
Premiere Pro > Preferences > Media (Mac OS). Here are the relevant options to 
consider:
• To move the media cache or the media cache database to a new disk, click the 
respective Browse button, select the desired location, and click OK. In most 
cases, you should not move the media cache database after you start to edit. 
However, on a regular basis, it should be cleaned.
• To clean the cache to remove conformed and indexed files, click the Clean 
button. Any connected drives will have their cache files removed. It’s a good 

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 65
idea to do this after you wrap up projects because it removes unneeded 
previews.
• Choose “Save Media Cache files next to originals when possible” in order to 
keep cache files stored on the same drive as the media. This will distribute the 
media cache files to the same drive as the media, which is generally desirable. If 
you want to keep everything in one central folder, leave this box unchecked.
an introduction to Dynamic Link
One way to work with Adobe Premiere Pro is with a suite of tools. You may be using 
a version of Adobe Creative Suite that includes other components for the related 
tasks for video editing. To make things easier, you’ll find several options for speeding 
up post-production workflow.
The options for Dynamic Link exist between several applications but behave a little 
differently depending upon the pair being used. The principal goal with Dynamic 
Link is to minimize time lost from rendering or exporting. Dynamic Link is sup-
ported by Adobe Premiere Pro, Adobe After Effects, and Adobe Encore.
We’ll explore the Dynamic Link workflow throughout this book, but this is a good 
time to point out an example that will help you understand how Adobe software 
components can work together. Using Dynamic Link, you can import Adobe After 
Effects compositions to an Adobe Premiere Pro project. Once added, the Adobe 
After Effects compositions will look and behave like any other clip in your project. If 
you make changes in Adobe After Effects, they’ll automatically update in the Adobe 
Premiere Pro project. This sort of time savings is useful as you begin to set up your 
projects.

lesson 3 
importing media
Capturing from videotape
While tapeless media has become the most common video format, there are still 
plenty of video cameras around that record to tape. Fortunately, tape is still a rel-
evant source and fully supported by Adobe Premiere Pro. To bring footage into an 
Adobe Premiere Pro project, you can capture it.
You capture digital video from a tape to the hard disk before using it in a project. 
Adobe Premiere Pro captures video through a digital port, such as a FireWire or 
Serial Digital Interface (SDI) port installed on your computer. Adobe Premiere Pro 
saves captured footage to disk as files and imports the files into projects as clips.
Adobe Premiere Pro features tools that take some of the manual labor out of the 
capturing process. There are three basic approaches:
• You can capture your entire videotape as one long clip.
• You can log each clip’s In and Out points for automated batch capturing.
• You can use the scene detection feature in Adobe Premiere Pro to automatically 
create separate clips based on every time you pressed the Pause/Record button 
on your camcorder.
P Note: To do these exercises, you will need a DV or HDV camera or deck. You may also need a 
FireWire port and appropriate cable. If you don’t have the hardware available, you can still read 
the exercises to explore the process. If you don’t plan on using tape, you can skip to Chapter 4, 
“Organizing media.”
Capturing other formats with 
third-party hardware
By default, you can use DV and HDV sources with Adobe Premiere Pro if your 
computer has a FireWire port. If you’d like to capture other higher-end professional 
formats, you’ll need to add a third-party capture device. They come in several 
form factors including internal cards as well as breakout boxes that connect via 
FireWire, USB 3.0, and Thunderbolt ports. Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 helps unify 
support for third-party hardware, which can now often take advantage of Mercury 
Engine Playback features for previewing effects and video to a connected pro-
fessional monitor. You can find a detailed list of supported hardware by visiting 
www.adobe.com/products/premiere/extend.html.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 67
Capturing an entire tape
Because hard drive space is relatively cheap, many choose to capture entire tapes 
at once. After editing your project, you can choose to manually remove the unused 
portions using media management options in Adobe Premiere Pro.
Here’s how to capture an entire tape:
1 Make sure to quit Adobe Premiere Pro before connecting any hardware. This is 
necessary so the hardware can be detected when the application launches.
2 Connect the camera or tape deck to your computer with the appropriate cable.
3 Turn on your camera or tape deck, and set it to playback mode: VTR or VCR. 
Do not set it to camera mode.
4 Depending on your operating system, additional dialog boxes may open:
• In Windows, an AutoPlay dialog may pop up. Click “View more AutoPlay 
options in Control Panel.” Set the option to “Take no action.” (The next time 
you fire up your camcorder, you should not see this connection query.)
• In Mac OS X, if iMovie or another application starts up, simply quit it. You 
can then use Adobe Premiere Pro to capture.
5 Start Adobe Premiere Pro, click Open Project, and navigate to the Lesson 03 file 
you’ve been working with. Create a new bin called Captured Footage.
6 Choose File > Capture to open the Capture panel.
P Note: If you get 
a No Device Control 
or Capture Device 
Offline message, you’ll 
need to do some 
troubleshooting. 
The most obvious fix 
is to make sure the 
camcorder is turned 
on and the cables are 
connected. For more 
troubleshooting tips, 
refer to the Adobe 
Community Help 
website.

68 
lesson 3 
importing media
7 Look above the Capture panel preview pane to make sure your camcorder is 
connected properly.
8 Insert a tape into your camera or deck. Adobe Premiere Pro prompts you to give 
the tape a name.
9 Type a name for your tape in the textbox. Be sure not to give two tapes the same 
name; Adobe Premiere Pro remembers clip in/out data based on tape names.
10 Use the VCR-style device controls in the Capture panel to play, fast-forward, 
rewind, pause, and stop your tape. If you’ve never used a computer to control 
a camcorder, this may seem pretty cool.

quickly—depending on how far you move the slider off-center—forward 
or backward through your tape.
• Single-frame Jog control (below the Shuttle slider).
• Step Forward and Step Back, one frame at a time.
• Slow Reverse and Slow Play.
12 Rewind the tape to its beginning or to wherever you want to start recording.
13 In the Setup area of the Logging tab, note  
that Audio and Video is the default 
setting. If you want to capture only audio 
or only video, change that setting.
E Tip: To help you 
identify these buttons, 
move the pointer over 
them to see tool tips.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 69
14 Click the Tape button in the Capture area of the Logging tab or the Record 
button in the Capture panel to start recording.
You’ll see (and hear) the video in the Capture panel and on your camcorder. 
Since there is a slight delay during capture, you’ll hear what sounds like an echo. 
Feel free to turn down the speaker on either your camcorder or your computer.
15 Press the Escape key when you want to stop recording.
The Save Captured Clip dialog appears.
16 Give your clip a name (add descriptive information if you want), and click OK.
Adobe Premiere Pro stores all the clips in the same folder as your project file. 
You can change the default location by choosing Project > Project Settings > 
Scratch Disks.
using batch capture
Adobe Premiere Pro offers a feature called batch capture. This allows you to log 
a tape and set In and Out points to describe a number of clips. Use the logging 
process to critically view your raw footage. You want to look for useful video, the 
best interview sound bites, and any natural sound that will enhance your produc-
tion. Adobe Premiere Pro can then automatically transfer the logged clips to your 
computer. This method is beneficial because it lets you log in faster than real time 
and then walk away and let the clips capture.
When you log each clip, you must assign it a unique name. Think through how 
you’re going to name your clips. You might end up with dozens of clips from each 
tape, and if you don’t give them descriptive names, it’ll slow down editing.
Here are the steps to follow:
1 In the Capture panel, click the Logging tab.
2 Change the Handles setting (at the bottom 
of the Logging tab) to 30 frames.
This adds one second to the start and 
finish of each captured clip for NTSC 
29.97, which will give you enough head and tail frames to add transitions 
without covering up important elements of the clip. If you’re working in PAL, 
set this to 25 frames.
3 In the Clip Data area of the Logging tab, give your tape a unique name.
4 Log your tape by rewinding and then playing it.
P Note: You may 
not see the preview 
window update when 
capturing HDV footage 
on your computer. Be 
sure to directly attach 
a monitor to your tape 
deck or camera so you 
can monitor the video 
signal.
P Note: Handles are 
extra frames at the 
beginning and end 
of a clip. For example, 
adding 30 frames as 
handles would add one 
second of video to the 
start and end of your 
clips if you’re working in 
NTSC 29.97. This can be 
useful for transitions.

70 
lesson 3 
importing media
5 When you see the start of a segment you want to transfer to your computer, 
stop the tape, rewind to that spot, and click the Set In button in the Timecode 
area of the Logging tab.
6 When you get to the end of that segment (you can use Fast Forward or simply 
Play to get there), click Set Out. The in/out times and the clip length will appear.
7 Click Log Clip to open the Log Clip dialog.
8 Change the clip name, if needed, and add appropriate notes if you want; then 
click OK.
That adds this clip’s name with its in/out times and tape name information to 
the Project panel (with “Offline” next to it). You’ll go there later to do the actual 
capture.
9 Log clips for the rest of your tape using the same method.
Each time you click Log Clip, Adobe Premiere Pro automatically adds a 
number to the end of your previous clip’s name. You can accept or override this 
automated naming feature.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 71
10 When you’ve finished logging your clips, close the Capture panel.
All your logged clips will be in the Project panel, with the offline icon next 
to each.
11 In the Project panel, select all the clips you want to capture.
12 Choose File > Batch Capture.
A Batch Capture dialog opens, allowing you to override the camcorder settings 
or add more handle frames.
13 Leave the Batch Capture options unselected, and click OK.
The Capture panel opens, as does another little dialog telling you to insert the 
proper tape (in this case, it’s probably still in the camcorder).

72 
lesson 3 
importing media
14 Insert the tape, and click OK.
Adobe Premiere Pro now takes control of your camcorder, cues up the tape to 
the first clip, and transfers that clip and all other clips to your hard drive.
15 When the process is complete, take a look at your Project panel to see the 
results. The offline icon is now a movie icon, and your footage is ready to 
be edited.
using scene detection
Instead of manually logging In and Out points, you might want to use the scene 
detection feature. Scene detection analyzes your tape’s time/date stamp, looking for 
breaks such as those caused when you press the camcorder’s Pause/Record button 
while recording.
When scene detection is on and you perform a capture, Adobe Premiere Pro 
automatically captures a separate file at each scene break it detects. Scene detection 
works whether you are capturing an entire tape or just a section between specific 
In and Out points.
To turn on scene detection, do either of the 
following:
• Click the Scene Detect button (below the 
Record button in the Capture panel).
• Select the Scene Detect option in the 
Capture area of the Logging tab.
Then you can either set In and Out points and click Record or cue your tape to 
wherever you want to start capturing and click Record. In the latter case, click Stop 
when done.
Your clips will show up in the Project panel. You don’t need to batch capture 
them—Adobe Premiere Pro captures each clip on the fly. Adobe Premiere Pro then 
names the first captured clip by putting a “01” after the name you put in the Clip 
Name box and increments the number in each new clip name by one.

1 Does Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 need to convert P2, XDCAM, or AVCHD footage when 
it is imported?
2 What is one advantage of using the Media Browser to import tapeless media over the 
File > Import method?
3 What should you check if you see “Capture Device Offline” at the top of the 
Capture panel?
4 What does scene detection do when selected?
5 During the capture process, how do you add extra frames to ensure you have enough 
footage for transitions?
6 Is the actual media captured to your hard disk during the logging stage of a batch 
capture?
review answers
1 No. Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 can edit P2, XDCAM, and AVCHD natively.
2 The Media Browser understands the P2 and XDCAM folder structures and shows you 
the clips in a visually friendly way.
3 Check that your camcorder or deck is connected to the computer and that it is turned 
on and in VCR mode.
4 Enabling scene detection causes clips to be automatically logged at each point where 
the camcorder was stopped or paused.
5 Type a number of frames in the Handles option in the Capture area of the Logging tab.
6 Only information about the clip, such as the tape name and In and Out points, is 
captured when creating the batch list. The clip will be displayed as “Offline” in the 
Project panel. The media is captured when you go to the Project panel and perform 
the batch capture of offline files.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn about the following:
• Using the Project panel
• Staying organized with bins
• Adding metadata to your clips
• Using essential playback controls
• Interpreting footage
• Making changes to your clips
This lesson will take approximately 50 minutes.

75
Once you have some video and sound assets in your 
project, you’ll want to get on with looking through 
your footage and adding clips to a sequence. Before 
you do, it’s well worth spending a little time organiz-
ing the assets you have. Doing so can save you hours 
of hunting for things later.

76 
Lesson 4 
organizing Media
Getting started
When you have lots of clips in your project, imported from several different media 
types, it can be a challenge to stay on top of everything and always find that magic 
shot when you need it.
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to organize your clips using the Project panel, which 
is the heart of your project. You’ll create special folders, called bins, to divide your 
clips into categories. You’ll also learn about adding important metadata and labels to 
your clips.
You’ll begin by getting to know the Project panel and organizing your clips.
Before you begin, make sure you are using the default Editing workspace.
1 Click Window > Workspace > Editing.
2 Click Window > Workspace > Reset Current Workspace.
3 Click Yes in the Reset Workspace dialog.
For this lesson, you’ll use the project file you used in Lesson 3.
4 Continue to work with the project file from the previous lesson, or open it from 
your hard drive.
5 Choose File > Save As.
6 Rename the file to Lesson 04.prproj.
7 Choose a preferred location on your hard drive, and click Save to save the 
project.
If you do not have the previous lesson file, you can open the file Lesson 
04.prproj from the Lesson 04 folder.
The Project panel
Anything you import into your Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 project will appear in 
the Project panel. As well as giving you excellent tools for browsing your clips and 
working with their metadata, the Project panel has special folders, called bins, you 
can use to organize everything.
No matter how you import your clips, everything that appears in a sequence must 
appear in the Project panel. If you delete a clip in the Project panel that is already 
used in a sequence, the clip will automatically be removed from the sequence. Don’t 
worry, though, because Adobe Premiere Pro will warn you if you do this.

As well as acting as the repository for all of your clips, the Project panel gives you 
important options for interpreting media. All of your footage will have a frame rate 
and pixel aspect ratio, for example, and you may want to change these settings for 
creative reasons. You could, for example, interpret 30fps video as 24fps to achieve 
a subtle slow-motion effect. You might also receive a video file that has the wrong 
pixel aspect ratio setting.
Adobe Premiere Pro uses metadata associated with footage to know how to play it 
back. If you want to change the metadata, you can use the Project panel to do so.
It’s all too easy to leave things with names like “untitled” 
or “new.” Although this might work out fine with only 
two or three clips, how would you find anything with two 
or three hundred?
Even if your clips have individual names, as in the case of 
our current project, they may not be super clear or easy 
to identify.
Let’s look at some ways to get organized.

78 
Lesson 4 
organizing Media
Customizing the Project panel
It’s quite likely that you will want to resize the Project panel from time to time. 
You’ll be alternating between looking at your clips as a list or as thumbnails, and 
sometimes it’s quicker to resize the panel than scroll over to see more information.
The default Editing workspace is designed to keep the interface as clean as possible 
so you can focus on your creative work rather than the buttons. Part of the Project 
panel that’s hidden from view, called the Preview Area, gives additional informa-
tion about your clips.
Let’s take a look at it:
1 Click the panel menu for the Project panel.
2 Choose Preview Area.
The Preview Area 
shows you several 
kinds of useful 
information about a 
clip when you select 
it in the Project panel, 
including the frame 
size, pixel aspect ratio, 
and duration. 
Frame size
Audio type
Duration and 
frame rate
Play/Stop
Clip type
Clip name
Poster frame
If it is not already selected, click the List View button 
 at the bottom-left 
corner of the Project panel. In this view, a lot of information is available about 
each clip in the Project panel, but you need to scroll horizontally to see it.
The Preview Area gives you a mix of information about clips when you need it.
3 Click the panel menu for the Project panel.
4 Choose Preview Area to hide it.
E Tip: There’s a very 
quick way to toggle 
between seeing the 
Project panel in a frame 
and seeing it full-screen. 
Just press the ` (grave) 
key. You can do this 
with any panel in 
Adobe Premiere Pro.
P Note: Be sure to 
follow the instructions 
in the “Getting Started” 
section that begins this 
lesson.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 79
finding assets in the Project panel
Working with clips is a little like working with pieces of paper at your desk. If you 
have just one or two clips, it’s easy. Once you have one or two hundred, you need a 
system!
One way you can help make things smoother during the edit is to take a little time 
to organize your clips at the very beginning. If you can name your clips during 
capture or after importing them, it can help enormously. Even if you don’t give each 
individual clip its own name during capture from tape, you can give a name to each 
type of shot and let Adobe Premiere Pro add 01, 02, 03, and so on (see Chapter 3, 
“Importing Metadata”).
E Tip: You can scroll the Project panel view up and down using the mouse wheel.
1 Click the name heading at the top of the Project panel. The items in the Project 
panel are displayed in alphabetical order or reverse alphabetical order when you 
click the name heading.
2 Scroll to the right until you can see the Media Duration heading in the Project 
panel. This shows the total duration of each clip’s media file.
3 Click the Media Duration heading. Adobe Premiere Pro displays the clips in 
order of media duration. Notice the direction arrow on the Media Duration 
heading. When you click the heading, the direction arrow toggles between 
showing clips in duration order or reverse duration order.
P Note: You may need to click and drag to expand the width of a column to see its arrow.
If you’re looking for lots of clips with particular features—such as a duration or 
a frame size—it can be helpful to change the order in which the headings are 
displayed.
4 Click and drag the Media Duration heading to the left, until you see a blue 
divider between the Label heading and the Name heading. When you release the 
mouse button, the Media Duration heading will be repositioned right next to the 
Name heading.
The blue divider shows where you will drop the heading.
P Note: When you 
scroll to the right in 
the Project panel, 
Adobe Premiere Pro 
always maintains the 
clip names on the left 
so you know which 
clips you’re seeing 
information about.
P Note: Graphic 
and photo files like

lesson 4 
organizing media
filter bin content
Adobe Premiere Pro has built-in search tools to help you find your media. Even if 
you are using the rather nondescriptive original clip names taken from a file-based 
camera, you can search for things like a frame size or a file type.
At the top of the Project panel, you can type in 
the Filter Bin Content box to display only clips 
that match the text you enter. This is a very 
quick and easy way of locating a clip if you remember what it is called. Clips that 
don’t match the text you enter are hidden and clips that do are revealed, even if they 
are inside a bin.
1 Click into the Filter Bin Content box, and type the letters ser.
Adobe Premiere Pro displays only the clips with the letters ser in the name. 
Notice the name of the project is displayed above the text entry box, along with 
“(filtered).”
2 Click the X on the right of the Filter Bin Content box to clear your filter.
3 Type the letters psd in the box.
Adobe Premiere Pro displays only clips that have the letters psd in their name, along 
with all the project bins. In this case, it’s just one clip that was imported earlier. Using 
the Filter Bin Content box in this way, you can look for particular types of files.
To the left of the text entry box you should see a button menu that displays a list of 
recent entries, along with the number of clips that match the search criteria.
To the right of the Filter Bin Content box, there’s 
an In menu where you can specify whether Adobe 
Premiere Pro should search for clips based on all of 
the available metadata, just the metadata displayed 
currently (see “Working with bins” later in this chap-
ter), or words taken from scripts (see “Organizing media with content analysis” later 
in this chapter).
Usually, it isn’t necessary to choose anything in this menu because the filtering 
works when using the All option if you type selections carefully. Be sure to click 
the X on the right of the Filter Bin Content box to clear your filter.
P Note: The folders 
you create inside the 
Project panel are called 
bins. This is a term taken 
from film editing. The 
Project panel itself is 
effectively a bin, since 
you can contain clips 
inside it. It functions 
exactly like any other 
bin and is referred to 
as one.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 81
find
Adobe Premiere Pro also has an advanced Find option. To learn about it, let’s 
import a couple of extra clips.
1 Using any of the methods described in Lesson 3, import Seattle_Skyline.mov 
and Vegas_Night.mov from the Assets folder, included with these lessons.
2 At the bottom of the Project panel, click the Find button 
. Adobe Premiere 
Pro displays the Find panel, which has more advanced options for locating 
your clips.
There are two sets of searches you can perform at the same time with the Adobe 
Premiere Pro Find panel. You can choose to display clips that match both search 
criteria or either search criteria. For example, you could do either of the following:
• Search for a clip with the words dog AND boat in its name.
• Search for a clip with the word dog OR boat in its name.
Then choose from the following options:
• Column: Selects from the available headings in the Project panel. When you 
click Find, Adobe Premiere Pro will search using only the heading you select.
• Operator: Gives you a set of standard search options. Use this menu to choose 
whether you want to find a clip that contains, matches exactly, begins with, or 
ends with whatever you search for.
• Match: Choose All to find a clip with both your first and second search text. 
Choose Any to find a clip with either your first or your second search text.
• Case Sensitive: Tells Adobe Premiere Pro whether you want your search to 
exactly match the upper- and lowercase letters you enter.
• Find What: Type your search text here. You can add up to two sets of 
search text.
When you click Find, Adobe Premiere Pro highlights a clip that matches your search 
criteria. Click Find again, and Adobe Premiere Pro highlights the next clip that 
matches your search criteria. Click Done to exit the Find dialog box.

lesson 4 
organizing media
Working with bins
Bins have the same icon as a folder on your hard drive and work in almost exactly 
the same way. They allow you to store your clips in a more organized way, by divid-
ing them into different groups.
Just like folders on your hard drive, you can have multiple bins inside other bins, 
creating a folder structure as comprehensive as your project requires.
There’s one very important difference between bins and folders on your hard drive: 
Bins exist only inside your Adobe Premiere Pro project file. You won’t see individual 
project bins anywhere on your hard drive.
Creating bins
Let’s create a bin.
1 Click the New Bin button at the bottom of the Project panel.
Adobe Premiere Pro creates a new bin and automatically 
highlights the name, ready for you to rename it. It’s a good idea 
to get into the habit of naming bins when you create them.
2 We have some clips from a film, so let’s give them a bin. Name the bin Double 
Identity.
3 You can also create a bin using the File menu. Choose File > New > Bin.
4 Name this bin PSD files.
5 You can also make a new bin by right-clicking a blank area in the Project panel 
and choosing New Bin. Try this now.
6 Name the new bin Illustrator files.
One of the quickest and easiest ways to create a new bin for clips you already 
have in your project is to drag and drop the clips onto the New Bin button at the 
bottom of the Project panel.
7 Drag and drop the clip Vegas_Night.mov onto the New Bin button.
8 Name the bin City Views.
P Note: It can be quite 
difficult to find a blank 
part of the Project panel 
to click when it is full of 
clips. Try clicking just 
to the left of the icons, 
inside the panel.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 83
9 Press the keyboard shortcut Control+/ (Windows) or Command+/ (Mac) to 
make a new bin.
10 Name the bin Sequences.
If your Project panel is set to List View, bins  
are displayed in name order among the clips.
managing media in bins
Now that we have some bins, let’s put them to use. As you move clips into bins, use 
the disclosure triangles to hide their contents and tidy up the view.
1 Drag the clip Lower_Third.ai into the Illustrator files bin.
2 Drag DoubleIdentity.psd into the PSD files bin.
3 Drag the Title_wLayers bin (created automatically when you imported the 
layered PSD file) into the PSD files bin. Bins inside bins work just like folders 
inside folders.
4 Drag the clip Seattle_Skyline.mov into the City Views bin. You might need to 
resize the panel or switch it to full-screen to see both the clip and the bin.
5 Drag the sequence First Sequence into the Sequences bin.
6 Put all of the remaining clips inside the Double 
Identity bin.
You should now have a nicely organized Project 
panel, with each kind of clip in its own bin.
Notice that you can also copy and paste clips to make 
extra copies if this suits your organizational system. 
You have a Photoshop document that might be useful 
for the Double Identity content. Let’s make an extra copy.
P Note: When you 
import an Adobe 
Photoshop file with 
multiple layers and 
choose to import 
as a sequence, 
Adobe Premiere Pro 
automatically creates 
a bin for the individual 
layers and their 
sequence.
E Tip: You can 
make Shift+click 
and Control+click 
(Windows) or 
Command+click 
(Mac) selections in the 
Project panel, just as 
you can with files in 
your hard drive.

84 
lesson 4 
organizing media
7 Click the disclosure triangle for the PSD files bin to display the contents.
8 Right-click the DoubleIdentity.psd clip, and choose Copy.
9 Click the disclosure triangle for the Double Identity bin to display the contents.
10 Right-click the Double Identity bin, and choose Paste.
Adobe Premiere Pro places a copy of the clip in the Double Identity bin.
finding your media
If you’re not sure where your media is on your hard drive, right-click the clip in the 
Project panel and choose Reveal in Explorer (Windows) or Reveal in Finder (Mac).
Adobe Premiere Pro will open the folder on your hard drive that contains the media 
file and highlight it. This can be very useful if you are working with media files stored 
on multiple hard drives or if you have renamed your clips in Adobe Premiere Pro.
Changing bin views
Though there is a distinction between the Project panel and bins, they have the 
same controls and viewing options. For all intents and purposes, you can treat the 
Project panel as a bin.
Bins have two views. You choose between them by clicking the List View or Icon 
View button at the bottom left of the Project panel.
• List View: Displays your clips and bins as a list, with a significant amount of 
metadata you can scroll through.
• Icon View: Displays your clips and bins as thumbnails you can rearrange and 
play back.
The Project panel has a Zoom control, which 
changes the size of the clip icons or thumbnails.
1 Double-click the Double Identity bin to open it in its own panel.
2 Click the Icon View button on the Double Identity bin to display thumbnails for 
your clips.
3 Try adjusting the Zoom control.
Adobe Premiere Pro can display very large thumbnails to make browsing and 
selecting your clips easy.
4 Switch the view to List View.
P Note: When you 
make copies of clips, 
you are not making 
copies of the media 
files they are linked to. 
You can make as many 
copies as you like of a 
clip inside your Adobe 
Premiere Pro project. 
Those copies will all link 
to the same original 
media file.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 85
5 Try adjusting the Zoom control for the bin.
When in List View, it doesn’t make that much sense to zoom, unless you turn on 
the display of thumbnails in this view.
6 Click the Panel menu, and choose Thumbnails.
Adobe Premiere Pro now displays thumbnails in List View, as well as in Icon View.
7 Try adjusting the Zoom control.
The clip thumbnails show the first frame of the 
media. In some cases, this is not particularly 
useful. Look at the clip 16B_SER4, for example. The 
thumbnail shows an empty armchair, but it would 
be useful to see who will be sitting in it.
8 Click the Panel menu, and choose Preview Area.
9 Select the clip 16B_SER4 so that information about it is displayed in the 
Preview Area.
10 The Thumbnail Viewer in the Preview Area allows you to play your clip, 
drag through it, and set a new poster frame. Drag through the clip using the 
Thumbnail Viewer until you see the actress sitting in the chair.

86 
lesson 4 
organizing media
11 Click the Poster Frame button on the Thumbnail  
Viewer.
Adobe Premiere Pro shows your newly selected frame 
as the thumbnail for this clip.
12 Use the panel menu to turn off thumbnails in List 
View and to hide the Preview Area.
assigning labels
Every item in the Project panel has a label color. In List View, the Label heading 
shows the label color for every clip. When you add your clips to a sequence, they 
will appear in the Timeline panel with this color.
Let’s change the color for the title so that it matches the other clips in this bin.
1 Right-click DoubleIdentity.psd and choose Label > Iris.
2 Make sure the DoubleIdentity bin is active by clicking once somewhere inside 
the panel.
3 Press Control+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac) to select every clip in 
the bin.
4 Right-click any of the clips in the bin, and 
choose Label > Forest.
Changing the available label colors
Eight available colors can be assigned as labels to items in your project. There are 
also eight types of item that label colors can be assigned to, and this means there 
aren’t any spare label colors.
If you choose Edit > Preferences > Label Colors (Windows) or Premiere Pro > 
Preferences > Label Colors (Mac), you can see the list of colors, each with a color 
swatch you can click to change the color to something else.
If you select Label Defaults in the preferences, you can choose different default 
labels for each kind of item in your project.
P Note: You can 
change the label color 
for multiple clips by 
choosing them first.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 87
Changing names
Because clips in your project are separate from the media files they link to, you can 
rename items inside Adobe Premiere Pro, and the names of your original media files 
on the hard drive are left untouched. This makes renaming clips safe to do!
1 Right-click the clip DoubleIdentity.psd, and choose Rename.
2 Change the name to DI Title BW.
3 Right-click the newly renamed clip, DI Title BW, and choose Reveal in Explorer 
(Windows) or Reveal in Finder (Mac).
Notice the original filename has not changed. It’s helpful to be clear about the 
difference between your original media files and the clips inside Adobe Premiere 
Pro because it explains much of the way Adobe Premiere Pro works.
Customizing bins
Adobe Premiere Pro displays certain types of information in the Project panel by 
default. You can easily add or remove headings. Depending on the clips you have 
and the types of metadata you are working with, you might want to display or hide 
different kinds of information.
1 If it’s not open already, open the Double Identity bin.
2 Click the Panel menu, and choose Metadata Display.
The Metadata Display panel allows you to choose any kind of metadata to use as 
a heading in the List View of the Project panel (and any bins). All you have to do 
is select the checkbox for the kind of information you would like to be included.
3 Click the disclosure triangle for Adobe Premiere Pro Project Metadata to show 
those options.
4 Select the Media Type checkbox.
5 Click OK.
P Note: When you 
change the name of a 
clip in Adobe Premiere 
Pro, the new name is 
stored in the project file. 
Two project files could 
easily have different 
names for the same clip.

88 
lesson 4 
organizing media
You’ll notice that Media Type is now added as a heading for the Double Identity bin 
but not for any other bins. To make this kind of change to every bin in one step, use 
the Panel menu on the Project panel, rather than on an individual bin.
Some of the headings are for information only, while others can be edited directly. 
The Scene heading, for example, allows you to add a scene number for each clip.
Notice that if you enter a number for a scene and then press the Enter key, Adobe 
Premiere Pro activates the next scene box. This way, you can use the keyboard to 
quickly enter information about each clip, jumping from one box to the next.
The Scene heading is a special one. It gives you information about what the scene 
clips are intended for; it also gives Adobe Premiere Pro information about which 
scene from an original script should be used for automatic analysis of the audio (see 
“Organizing media with content analysis” later in this chapter).
adobe story
Adobe Story is a script-writing application that automates the process of cor-
rectly formatting scripts and integrates into your editing workflow with Adobe 
Premiere Pro.
As well as giving you tools for script writing, Story supports collaboration with other 
writers, automatic versioning, and tagging scripts with metadata for preproduction 
planning, and it can generate script reports and schedules to help you prepare for 
production.
having multiple bins open at once
When you double-click a bin, by default, Adobe Premiere Pro opens the bin in a 
floating panel. Every bin panel behaves in the same way, with the same options, but-
tons, and settings.
If you have room on your computer monitor, you can have as many bins open as 
you like.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 89
Bins are like any other kind of panel in that you can drag them to any part of the 
interface, resize them, combine them with other panels, and toggle them between 
full-screen and frame display using the ` (grave) key.
Bins open in their own panel when you double-click them because of the default 
preferences, which you can change to suit your editing style.
Choose Edit > Preferences > General (Windows) or Premiere Pro > Preferences > 
General (Mac) to change the options.
Each of the options lets you choose what will happen when you double-click, 
double-click with the Control (Windows) or Command (Mac) key, or double-click 
with the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac) key.
organizing media with content analysis
Increasingly, metadata is used to help you stay organized and share information 
about your clips. The challenge with metadata is in finding efficient ways to create 
it and add it to your clips.
To make this process much easier, Adobe Premiere Pro can analyze your media and 
automatically create metadata based on the content. The words that are spoken can 
be added as time-based text, and clips with faces can be marked as such to make it 
easier to identify useful shots.
attaching a script or transcript
Adobe Premiere Pro has a Speech to Text function that listens to the words spoken 
in your footage and creates text associated with your clips. The text is linked in time 
to when the words are spoken, so you can easily locate the part of a clip you want.
The accuracy of the analysis depends on several factors. You can help Adobe 
Premiere Pro correctly identify the words that are spoken by associating a script or 
transcript with your clips.

90 
Lesson 4 
organizing Media
Speech analysis
To initiate the Speech to Text function, do the following:
1 Import the video file CU MAGE STT.mp4 from the Assets/Speech to text folder.
2 Scroll along in the Project panel until you can see the Scene heading. Add the 
scene number 1 for the CU MAGE STT.mp4 clip.
3 Double-click the CU MAGE STT.mp4 clip. If the Double Identity bin obscures 
the Source Monitor, you can close the bin by clicking on the X on the bin's 
panel tab.
Adobe Premiere Pro displays it in the Source Monitor.
4 Click the tab for the Metadata panel to display it. In the default Editing 
workspace, you’ll find the Metadata panel sharing a frame with the Program 
Monitor. If it isn’t there, click the Window menu, and choose Metadata.
The Metadata panel shows you many different kinds of metadata about clips in 
your project.
5 Click the Analyze button 
at the bottom right of the 
Metadata panel.
The Analyze Content panel 
gives you options for how 
the automatic analysis will 
take place. You simply need 
to decide whether you want 
Adobe Premiere Pro to 
detect faces and/or identify 
speech and then choose the 
language and the quality 
settings.
To help the speech detection 
improve accuracy, we’re 
going to attach a script file.
6 Click the Reference Script 
menu, and choose Add.
P Note: There’s a zip 
file in that folder with 
an original copy of the 
video clip, so you can 
try this again if you’d 
like. Once you use the 
Adobe Premiere Pro 
Speech to Text feature, 
the original file has the 
additional metadata 
added, which will be 
available whenever you 
import it.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 91
7 Browse to the Assets/Speech to text folder, and open Paladin_Script_Final.astx. 
Adobe Premiere Pro displays the Import Script dialog so you can confirm you 
have chosen the right script. Notice there’s a checkbox to confirm the script text 
exactly matches the recorded dialogue. This forces Adobe Premiere Pro to use 
only the words in the original script (useful for interview transcriptions). Click 
OK, without selecting the check box.
8 Select the Identify Speakers checkbox in the Analyze Content panel.
This tells Adobe Premiere Pro to separate dialogue from different voices.
9 Leave all of the other settings at their defaults, and click OK.
Adobe Premiere Pro starts the Adobe Media Encoder, which conducts the 
analysis in the background. This allows you to carry on working in your project 
while the analysis happens. When the analysis is complete, a text description of 
the words spoken is displayed for the clip in the Metadata panel.
Adobe Media Encoder starts the analysis automatically and plays a completion 
sound when it has finished. You can set off multiple clips for analysis, and Adobe 
Media Encoder will automatically add them to a queue. You can quit Adobe 
Media Encoder when it has completed its tasks.
face detection
With so many clips in larger projects, anything that makes finding the right shot 
easier helps. Turning on face detection when analyzing your clips adds an extra way 
of searching for content.
Now that you have analyzed the CU MAGE STT.mp4 clip, try clicking the Recent 
Searches button for the Filter Bin Content box in the Project panel and choosing Find 
Faces. The CU MAGE STT.mp4 shot will be displayed, even if you put it into a bin. 
Be sure to click the X on the right of the Filter Bin Content box to clear your filter.
monitoring footage
The greater part of video editing is invested in watching clips and making creative 
choices about them. It’s important to feel really comfortable browsing media.
Adobe Premiere Pro has multiple ways of performing common tasks such as play-
ing video clips. You can use the keyboard, click buttons with your mouse, or use an 
external device like a jog/shuttle control.
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 has a new browsing feature called hover scrub that allows 
you to view the contents of your clips quickly and easily right in the bin.
1 Double-click the Double Identity bin to open it.
2 Click the Icon View button at the bottom-left corner of the bin.
E Tip: Adding a scene 
number for your clips 
helps Adobe Premiere 
Pro identify the part of 
the script the dialogue 
relates to.

92 
lesson 4 
organizing media
3 Drag your mouse, without clicking, across any of the images in the bin.
Adobe Premiere Pro displays the contents of the clip as you drag. The left edge of 
the thumbnail represents the beginning of the clip, and the right edge represents 
the end. In this way, the width of the thumbnail represents the whole clip.
4 Select a clip by clicking it once. Hover scrubbing is now turned off, and a mini 
scrollbar appears at the bottom of the thumbnail. Try dragging through the clip 
using the scrollbar.
Adobe Premiere Pro uses the J, K, and L keys on your keyboard to perform 
playback too, just like the Media Browser.
• J: Play backward
• K: Pause
• L: Play forward
5 Select a clip, and use the JKL keys to play the thumbnail. Be sure to click the clip 
only once. If you double-click, it will open in the Source Monitor.
When you double-click a clip, not only is it  
displayed in the Source Monitor, it’s also added 
to a list of recent clips.
E Tip: If you press the 
J or L key multiple times, 
Adobe Premiere Pro will 
play the video clips at 
multiple speeds.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 93
6 Double-click to open four or five clips from the Double Identity bin.
7 Click the Recent Items menu, on the tab at the top of the Source Monitor, to 
browse between your recent clips.
E Tip: Notice that you have the option to close a single clip or close all clips, clearing the menu and 
the monitor. Some editors like to clear the menu and then open several clips that are part of a scene 
by selecting them all in the bin and dragging them into the Source Monitor together. They can then 
use the recent items menu to browse only the clips from this short list.
8 Click the Zoom menu at the bottom of the Source Monitor.  
By default, this is set to Fit, which means Adobe Premiere Pro 
will display the whole frame, regardless of the original size. 
Change the setting to 100%.
These Double Identity clips are high-resolution, and they are probably much 
bigger than your Source Monitor. You are likely to have scrollbars at the bottom 
and on the right of your Source Monitor now, so you can view different parts of 
the image.
The benefit of viewing with Zoom set to 100% is that you see every pixel of the 
original video, which is useful for checking the quality.
9 Set the Zoom back to Fit.
Playback resolution
If you have an older or slower processor, your computer may 
struggle to play back very high-quality video clips. To work 
with a wide variety of computer hardware configurations, from 
powerful desktop workstations to lightweight portable laptops, Adobe Premiere 
Pro can lower the playback resolution to make playback smoother. You can switch 
the playback resolution as often as you like, using the Select Playback Resolution 
menu on the Source (and Program) Monitor.
timecode information
At the bottom left of the Source Monitor, a timecode display shows the current 
position of the playhead in hours, minutes, seconds, and frames (00:00:00;00).
At the bottom right of the Source Monitor, a timecode display shows the total 
selected duration for your clip. Later, you’ll be adding special marks to make a par-
tial selection. For now, it shows the complete duration.

safe margins
Old-style CRT monitors crop the edges of the picture to achieve a clean edge. If 
you are producing video for a CRT monitor, click the Settings (spanner icon) but-
ton at the bottom of the Source Monitor and choose Safe Margins. Adobe Premiere 
Pro displays white outlines over the image.
The outer box is the Safe Action zone. Aim to keep important action inside this box 
so that when the picture is displayed, cropping does not hide what is going on.
The inner box is the Title Safe zone. Keep titles and graphics inside this box so that 
even on a badly calibrated display, your audience will be able to read the words.
Click back into the Settings button at the bottom of the Source Monitor and 
choose Safe Margins to turn them off.

keyboard.
6 Use the J, K, and L keys to play your clip.
Customizing the monitors
To customize your monitors, click the Settings button 
on the Source Monitor.
This menu gives you several different display options for your Source Monitor (the 
Program Monitor has a similar menu). You can choose to view waveforms and vec-
tor scopes to analyze your video.
For now, we just want to know how to get regular video on-screen. Make sure 
Composite Video is selected in this menu.
You can add or remove buttons at the bottom of the Source Monitor.
1 Click the Button Editor button at the bottom right of the Source Monitor.
A special set of buttons appears.
2 Drag the Loop button 
from the floating panel to the right of the Play button 
on the Source Monitor, and click OK.
3 Double-click the di05c_compv_02 clip in the Double Identity bin to open it in 
the Source Monitor.
4 Click the Loop button to enable it, and then play the video using the spacebar or 
the Play button on the Source Monitor. Stop the playback when you have seen 
enough.
With Loop turned on, Adobe Premiere Pro continuously repeats playback.

lesson 4 
organizing media
modifying clips
Adobe Premiere Pro uses metadata associated with clips to know how to play them 
back. Occasionally, this metadata will be wrong, and you’ll need to tell Adobe 
Premiere Pro how to interpret a clip.
You can change the interpretation of clips for one file or multiple files in a single 
step. To do so, just select the clips you want to change.
adjusting audio channels
Adobe Premiere Pro has advanced audio management features. You can create 
complex sound mixes and selectively target output audio channels with original 
clip audio. You can produce Mono, Stereo, 5.1, and even 16-channel sequences with 
precise control over which audio goes where.
If you’re just starting out, you’ll probably want to produce stereo sequences and 
might well be working with stereo source material. In this case, the default settings 
are most likely exactly what you need.
When recording audio with a professional camera, it’s common to have one micro-
phone record onto one audio channel and a different microphone record onto 
another audio channel. Though these are the same audio channels that would be 
used for regular stereo audio, they now contain completely separate sound.
Your camera adds metadata to the video that is recorded to tell Adobe Premiere Pro 
whether the sound is meant to be mono (separate audio channels) or stereo (chan-
nel 1 audio and channel 2 audio combine to produce the complete stereo sound).
You can tell Adobe Premiere Pro how to interpret audio channels when new media 
files are imported by going to Edit > Preferences > Audio > Channels (Windows) or 
Premiere Pro > Preferences > Audio > Channels (Mac).
If the setting was wrong when you imported your clips, it’s easy to tell Adobe 
Premiere Pro how to correctly interpret the audio channels.
1 Right-click the CU MAGE STT.mp4 clip in the Project panel, and choose 
Modify > Audio Channels.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 97
2 Right now, this clip is set to use the file’s metadata to identify the channel 
format for the audio. Click the Preset menu, and change it to Mono.
Adobe Premiere Pro switches the Channel Format menu to mono. You’ll see the 
Left and Right Source Channels are now linked to track Audio 1 and Audio 2. 
This means that when you add the clip to a sequence, each audio channel will go 
on a separate track, allowing you to work on them independently.
3 Click OK.
Interpreting footage
For Adobe Premiere Pro to interpret a clip correctly, it needs to know the frame rate 
for the video, the pixel aspect ratio (the shape of the pixels), and the order to display 
the fields, if your clip has them. Adobe Premiere Pro can find out this information 
from the file’s metadata, but you can change the interpretation easily.
1 Import RED Video.R3D from the Lesson 04 folder. Double-click it to open it in 
the Source Monitor. It’s full anamorphic widescreen, which is a little too wide 
for our project.
2 Right-click the clip in the bin, and choose Modify > Interpret Footage.
3 Right now, the clip is set to use the Pixel Aspect Ratio setting from the file: 
Anamorphic 2:1. This means the pixels are twice as wide as they are tall.
4 Change the Pixel Aspect Ratio setting to Conform to:, and select DVCPRO HD 
(1.5). Then click OK.
From now on, Adobe Premiere Pro will interpret the clip as having pixels that are 
1.5 times wider than they are tall. This reshapes the picture to make it standard 
16:9 wide screen. This won’t always work—in fact, it usually introduces unwanted 
distortion—but it can provide a quick fix for mismatched media (a common 
problem for news editors).
Working with reD files
Adobe Premiere Pro has special settings for R3D files created by RED cameras. 
R3D files are very similar to the camera raw format used by professional DSLR still 
cameras. Raw files always have a layer of interpretation applied to them in order to 
view them. You can change the interpretation at any time without impacting play-
back performance in Adobe Premiere Pro. This means you can make changes, for 
example, to the colors in a shot without requiring any extra processing power. You 
could achieve a similar result using a special effect, but your computer would have 
to do more work to play the clip.

98 
lesson 4 
organizing media
The added benefit is that the changes made using RED source settings apply to 
the original media files, so you can update the way colors are interpreted at a later 
stage in your edit and see the results in clips that are already in a sequence.
1 Right-click the RED Video.R3D clip in the Project panel, and choose Source 
Settings.
The RED R3D Source Settings dialog appears, giving you access to all of the 
original interpretation controls for the clip you select. In many ways, this is a 
powerful color correction tool, with automatic white balance and individual 
adjustment of the red, green, and blue values.
2 On the right, there is a series of individual controls for adjusting the picture. 
Scroll down to the very end of the list, where you’ll find Gain Settings. Since this 
is a RED clip, let’s increase the Red gain to about 1.5. You can drag the slider 
control, click and drag the orange number, or click and type over the number.
3 Click OK, and take another look at the clip in the Source Monitor.
The picture has updated. If you had already edited this clip into a sequence, it 
would update inside the sequence, too.

review answers
1 Click the Panel menu for the Project panel, and choose Metadata Display. Select the 
checkbox for any heading you would like to appear.
2 Click into the Filter Bin Content box, and start typing the name of the clip you are 
looking for. Adobe Premiere Pro hides any clips that don’t match and displays those 
that do.
3 Click the New Bin button at the bottom of the Project panel. Or, go to the File menu 
and choose New > Bin. Or, right-click a blank area in the Project panel and choose 
New Bin. Or, press Ctrl+/ (Windows) or Command+/ (Mac). You can also drag and 
drop clips onto the New Bin button on the Project panel.
4 No, you can duplicate, rename, or delete clips in your Project panel, and nothing will 
happen to your original media files. Adobe Premiere Pro is a nondestructive editor and 
will not modify your original files.
5 The Spacebar plays and stops. J, K, and L can be used like a shuttle controller to play 
backward and forward, and the arrow keys can be used to move one frame backward 
or one frame forward.
6 Right-click the clip you want to change, and choose Modify > Audio Channels. Choose 
the correct option (usually by selecting a preset), and click OK.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn about the following:
• Working with clips in the Source monitor
• Creating sequences
• Using essential editing commands
• Understanding tracks
This lesson will take approximately 45 minutes.
This lesson will teach you the core editing skills you will use again and 
again when creating sequences with Adobe Premiere Pro CS6.

101
Editing is much more than choosing shots. You time 
your cuts precisely, placing clips in sequences at 
exactly the right point in time and on the track you 
want (to create layered effects), adding new clips to 
existing sequences, and removing old ones.

102 
lesson 5 
essentials of Video editing
Getting started
No matter how you like to approach video editing, there are some very simple tech-
niques you will employ time and again. Essentially, you’ll be making partial selec-
tions of your clips and selectively placing them in your sequence. There are several 
ways of doing this in Adobe Premiere Pro.
Before you begin, make sure you are using the default Editing workspace.
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Editing.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Current Workspace.
3 Click Yes in the Reset Workspace dialog.
For this lesson, you’ll use the project file you used in Lesson 4.
4 Continue to work with the project file from the previous lesson, or open it from 
your hard drive.
5 Choose File > Save As.
6 Rename the file to Lesson 05.prproj.
7 Choose a preferred location on your hard drive, and click Save to save the 
project.
If you do not have the previous lesson file, you can open the Lesson 04.prproj file 
from the Lesson 04 folder.
You’ll begin by learning more about the Source monitor and how to premark your 
clips to get them ready to be added to a sequence. Then you’ll learn about the 
Timeline panel, where you’ll work on your sequences, and you’ll learn how to put 
everything together.
using the source monitor
The Source Monitor is the main place you’ll go when you want to check your assets 
before including them in a sequence.
When you view video clips in the Source Monitor, you watch them in their origi-
nal format. They will play back with their frame rate, frame size, field order, audio 
sample rate, and audio bit depth exactly as they were recorded.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 103
When you add a clip to a sequence, Adobe Premiere Pro conforms it to match the 
sequence settings. This means the frame rate, frame size, and audio type might all be 
adjusted so that everything plays back the same way.
As well as being a viewer for multiple file types, the Source Monitor provides impor-
tant additional functions. You can use two special kinds of markers, called In and 
Out points, to select just part of the clip for inclusion in your sequence. You can also 
add comments to other kinds of markers to refer to later or remind yourself about 
important facts relating to a clip. You might include a note about part of a shot you 
don’t have permission to use, for example.
Loading a clip
To load a clip do the following:
1 Browse to the Double Identity bin. With the default preferences, you can 
double-click the bin in the Project panel while holding the Control (Windows) 
or Command (Mac) key. The bin will open in the existing frame. To navigate 
back to the Project panel contents, click the Navigate Up button 
.
2 Double-click a video clip, or drag and drop a clip into the Source Monitor.
Either way, the result is the same: Adobe Premiere Pro displays the clip in the 
Source Monitor, ready for you to watch it and add markers.
3 Position your mouse pointer so that it is over the Source Monitor, and press the ` 
(grave) key. Press the ` (grave) key again, to restore the Source Monitor to its 
original size.
E Tip: Notice that 
the active frame has 
an orange outline. It’s 
important to know 
which frame is active 
because menus 
sometimes update to 
reflect your current 
selection. If you press 
Shift+` (grave), the 
currently selected 
frame will toggle to 
full-screen, rather than 
the frame your mouse 
is over.

104 
lesson 5 
essentials of Video editing
Viewing video on a second monitor
If you have a second monitor connected to your computer, Adobe Premiere Pro can 
use it to display full-screen video.
Choose Edit > Preferences > Playback (Windows) or Premiere Pro > Preferences > 
Playback (Mac), and select the checkbox for the monitor you would like to use for 
full-screen playback.
You also have the option of playing video via a DV device if you have one 
connected.
Loading multiple clips
Next you’ll create a selection of clips to work with in the Source Monitor.
1 Click the recent items menu at the top left of the Source Monitor, and choose 
Close All.
2 Click the List View button on the Double Identity bin, and make sure the clips 
are displayed in alphabetical order by clicking the Name heading.
3 Select the first clip, 3_4, and then hold down the Shift key and click the clip 
16_6B.
This makes a selection of multiple clips in the bin.
4 Drag the clips from the bin to the Source Monitor.
Now just the clips selected will be displayed in the Source Monitor Recent Items 
menu. You can use the menu to choose which clip to view.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 105
source monitor controls
As well as playback controls, there are some important additional buttons in the 
Source Monitor.
Add Marker
Go to Out
Go to In
Mark In
Mark Out
Insert
Overwrite
• Add Marker: Adds a marker to the clip at the current time of the playhead. 
Markers can provide a simple visual reference or store comments.
• Mark In: Marks the beginning of the part of the clip you intend to use in a 
sequence. You can have only one In point. A new In point will automatically 
replace the existing one.
• Mark Out: Marks the end of the part of the clip you intend to use in a sequence. 
You can only ever have one Out point. A new Out point will automatically 
replace the existing one.
• Go to In: Moves the playhead to the clip In point.
• Go to Out: Moves the playhead to the clip Out point.
• Insert: Adds the clip to the sequence currently displayed in the Timeline 
panel using the insert edit method (see “Essential editing commands” later in 
this chapter).
• Overwrite: Adds the clip to the sequence currently displayed in the Timeline 
panel using the overwrite edit method (see “Essential editing commands” later 
in this chapter).
selecting a range in a clip
Sometimes you want to select only a specific range within a clip.
1 Use the recent items menu to select the clip 3D_SER1. It’s a shot of a lady 
looking nervous as she walks.
2 Play the clip to get an idea of the action.
There’s a moment, about a third of the way through the clip, where the director 
tells the actress to turn her head. She does, and she looks nervous. It’s a nice 
dramatic moment.
E Tip: To help you find your way around your footage, Adobe Premiere Pro can display timecode 
numbers on the time ruler. Toggle this option on and off by clicking the Settings button 
 and 
choosing Time Ruler Numbers.

106 
lesson 5 
essentials of Video editing
3 Position the playhead a couple of seconds before the actress turns her head, 
while she’s still looking forward. Something around 00:00:07:00 is about right.
4 Click the Mark In button. You can also press the I key on your keyboard.
Adobe Premiere Pro highlights the section of the clip that is selected. You have 
excluded the first part of the clip, but you’ll be able to reclaim this part later if 
you need to do so—that’s the wonderful freedom of nonlinear editing.
5 Position the playhead just after she leaves the shot. Around 00:00:13:00 is 
perfect.
6 Press the O key on your keyboard to add an Out point.
In and Out points added to clips are persistent. That is, they will still be 
present if you close and open the clip again. Let’s add In and Out points for the 
following two clips as well.
7 For 3E_SER3, add an In point about ten frames from the start of the shot, just 
before the stalker flicks the knife (00:00:00:10).
E Tip: If your keyboard 
has a separate 
numerical keypad, 
you can use it to enter 
timecode directly. For 
example, if you type 
700, Adobe Premiere 
Pro will position the 
playhead at 00:00:07:00. 
There’s no need to 
enter the leading zeros. 
Also, be sure to use 
the numerical keypad 
and not the numbers 
along the top of your 
keyboard.
E Tip: The tooltip 
that pops up if you 
hover your mouse over 
a button tells you the 
keyboard shortcut key 
in brackets after the 
name of the button.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 107
8 Add an Out point around 1 second and 20 frames from the start of the shot, just 
after the stalker flicks the knife (00:00:01:20).
9 For 3B_SER4, add an In point around eight seconds from the start of the shot, as 
the lady runs past the camera (00:00:08:00).
10 Add an Out point around 16 seconds from the start of the shot, when the car 
has nearly left the screen (00:00:16:00).
As you gain experience as an editor, you may find you prefer to go through all of 
your available clips, adding In and Out points as required, before building your 
sequences. Some editors prefer to add In and Out points only as they use each clip.

108 
lesson 5 
essentials of Video editing
Creating subclips
If you have a very long clip—perhaps even the entire contents of a video tape—
there might be several parts you would like to use in your sequence, and it would 
be useful to have a way of preseparating the parts so they could be organized prior 
to building your sequence.
This is exactly the situation subclips were created for. Subclips are partial copies of 
clips. They are commonly used when working with very long clips, especially when 
there are several parts of the same original clip that might be used in a sequence.
• They can be organized in bins, just like regular clips (they have a different  
icon 
).
• They have a limited duration—based on the In and Out points used to create 
them (this makes it easier to view their contents when compared with viewing 
potentially much longer original clips).
• They share the same media files as the original clips they are based on.
Let’s make a subclip:
1 While viewing the contents of the Double Identity bin, click the New Bin button 
at the bottom of the panel to create a new bin. The new bin will appear inside 
the existing Double Identity bin.
2 Name the bin DI Subclips, and open it to see the contents; consider holding the 
Control (Windows) or Command (Mac) key while double-clicking the bin to 
have it open in the same frame, rather than floating as an independent frame.
3 In the recent items menu at the top of the Source panel, choose the clip 3C_2-2. 
It’s a shot of the stalker’s feet walking. He’s walking in the wrong direction, but 
we’ll be able to fix that easily later with a special effect.
4 Place an In point around six seconds from the start of the clip.
5 Place an Out point around eight seconds from the start of the clip.
6 To create a subclip from the partial selection, between your In and Out point, 
do one of the following:
• Right-click inside the picture 
display of the Source monitor, 
and choose Make Subclip. Give 
the subclip the name Footsteps, 
and click OK.
• Click the Clip menu, and choose 
Make Subclip. Name the subclip 
Footsteps, and click OK. The new 
subclip is added to the DI Subclips bin.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 109
using a keyboard shortcut 
to make subclips
By default, Adobe Premiere Pro does not have a keyboard shortcut assigned for 
making subclips. If you expect to make lots of subclips, it makes sense to use 
the keyboard for this purpose; keyboard shortcuts are often faster than using 
the mouse.
1 
Click the Edit menu and choose Keyboard Shortcut (Windows) or click the 
Adobe Premiere Pro menu and choose Keyboard Shortcuts (Mac).
2 
In the Keyboard Shortcuts dialog, expand the Clip category of shortcuts, and 
double-click the Make Subclip entry.
3 
Press the keyboard shortcut you would like. Adobe Premiere Pro will warn you if 
you use an existing shortcut. Shift+Alt+S is available by default.
4 
Click OK.
navigating the timeline
If the Project panel is the heart of your project, then the Timeline panel is the 
canvas. The Timeline is where you will add clips to your sequences, make editorial 
changes to them, add visual and audio special effects, mix soundtracks, and add 
titles and graphics.

lesson 5 
essentials of Video editing
Here are a few facts about the Timeline panel:
• You view and edit sequences in the Timeline panel.
• You can open multiple sequences at the same time, and each will be displayed in 
its own Timeline panel.
• The names Sequence and Timeline are often used interchangeably as “in the 
Sequence” or “on the Timeline.”
• You can have up to 99 video tracks and upper video tracks play “in front” of 
lower ones.
• You can have up to 99 audio tracks that all play at the same time 
to create an audio mix (audio tracks can be mono, stereo, 5.1, or 
adaptive—with up to 16 channels).
• Each track has a set of controls that change the way it functions.
• Time is displayed on the Timeline, always moving from left to right.
• The Program Monitor shows you the contents of the currently 
displayed sequence.
• For most operations on the Timeline, you will use a standard 
selection tool. However, there are a series of other tools for dedicated 
purposes. If in doubt, press the V key. This is the keyboard shortcut 
for the selection tool.
What is a sequence?
A sequence is a container for a series of clips that play, one after another, sometimes 
with multiple blended layers, and often with special effects, titles, and audio, to 
produce a completed film.
You can have as many sequences as you like in a project.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 111
Conforming
Sequences have a frame rate, frame size, and audio mastering format (mono or ste-
reo, for example). They conform, or adjust, any clips you add to match these settings.
You can choose whether clips should be scaled visually to match your sequence 
frame size or not. For example, if you have a sequence with a frame size of 720 x 480 
(standard-definition NTSC-DV) and a video clip that is 1920 x 1080 (high definition), 
you might decide to automatically scale the high-resolution clip down to match 
your sequence resolution or leave it as it is, viewing only part of the picture in the 
reduced “window” of the sequence.
When clips are scaled, the vertical and horizontal sizes are scaled equally to keep 
the original aspect ratio. This means if a clip has a different aspect ratio than your 
sequence, it may not completely fill the frame of your sequence when it is scaled. 
For example, if your clip had a 4 x 3 aspect ratio and you added it, scaled, to a 16 x 9 
sequence, you’d see gaps at the sides.
Using Motion controls (see Chapter 9, “Putting Clips in Motion”), you can animate 
which part of the picture you see, creating a dynamic pan-and-scan effect.
Let’s make a new sequence for our Double Identity drama:
1 In the Double Identity bin, drag the clip 3D_SER1 onto the New Item button at 
the bottom of the panel.
This is a shortcut to make a sequence that perfectly matches your media. Adobe 
Premiere Pro creates a new sequence that shares the name of the clip you 
selected.
P Note: You may need to click the Navigate Up button to see the Double Identity bin.
2. The sequence is highlighted in the bin, and it would be a good idea to rename 
it right away. Right-click the sequence in the bin, and choose Rename. Call the 
sequence Double Identity.
The sequence is automatically open, and it contains the clip you used to create it. 
This works for our purposes, but if you had used a random clip to perform this 
shortcut, you could always just select it in the sequence and delete it now (with the 
Delete key).
Close the sequence by clicking the x on its name tab in the Timeline panel.

112 
lesson 5 
essentials of Video editing
opening a sequence in a timeline panel
To open a sequence in the Timeline panel, do one of the following:
• Double-click the sequence in a bin.
• Right-click the sequence in a bin, and choose Open in Timeline.
Open the Double Identity sequence now, and take a look at it in the Timeline panel.
understanding tracks
Much in the way that railway tracks keep trains in line, sequences have video and 
audio tracks that constrain the positions of clips you add to them. The simplest 
form of sequence would have just one video track and perhaps one audio track. You 
add clips to tracks, one after another, from left to right, and they play in the order 
you position them.
Sequences can have additional video and audio tracks. These become layers of video 
and additional audio channels. Since the higher video tracks appear in front of lower 
ones, you can use them to creatively produce layered compositions.
You might use an upper video track to add titles to a sequence or to blend multiple 
layers of video using special effects.
Title
Picture-in-picture
Video
You might use multiple audio tracks to create a complete audio composition for 
your sequence, with original source dialogue, music, spot audio effects like gun-
shots or fireworks, atmospheric sound, and voice-over.
E Tip: You can also 
open a sequence into 
the Source Monitor to 
use it as if it were a clip. 
Be careful not to drag 
a sequence into the 
Timeline panel to open 
it. You’ll add it to your 
current sequence as a 
clip instead.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 113
targeting tracks
Track headers are more than name plates. They also act as enable/disable buttons 
for the tracks when editing new clips into a sequence. By turning off a track, you 
can prevent a clip, or part of a clip, from being placed on it when applying an edit 
with keyboard shortcuts or on-screen buttons. If you drag and drop clips into a 
sequence, the track headers are ignored.
To the left of the track headers, you’ll see an extra set of buttons that represent the 
available tracks for the clip currently displayed in the Source Monitor. These are the 
source track indicators.
Just as with the track headers, if you drag and drop a clip into a sequence, the source 
track indicators are ignored. However, when you use the keyboard or the buttons 
on the Source Monitor to add a clip to a sequence, source track indicators are very 
important.
In the previous example, the position of the source track indicators means a clip 
would be added to the Video 1, Audio 1, and Audio 2 tracks on the Timeline.
In the following example, the source track indicators have been moved, by dragging 
and dropping. In this example, the clip would be added to the Video 2, Audio 3, 
and Audio 4 tracks on the Timeline.
The source track indicators enable or disable the video and audio channels of your 
source clips, while the track headers enable or disable targeting for your sequence 
tracks. You can make more advanced edits by carefully positioning the source track 
indicators and selecting which tracks you have on or off.

114 
lesson 5 
essentials of Video editing
In and out points
The In and Out points used in the Source Monitor define the part of a clip you 
would like to add to a sequence. The points you use on the Timeline have two pri-
mary purposes:
• Use them to tell Adobe Premiere Pro where a clip should be positioned when it 
is added to a sequence.
• Use them to select parts of a sequence you would like to remove. In 
combination with the track headers, you can make very precise selections to 
remove whole clips, or parts of clips, from multiple tracks.
The light blue highlight indicates the selected part of the sequence.
setting In and out points
Adding In and Out points on the Timeline is almost the same as adding them in 
the Source Monitor. One key difference is that, unlike the controls in the Source 
Monitor, the controls on the Program Monitor also apply to the Timeline.
To add an In point to the Timeline, make sure the Timeline panel is active, and press 
the I key, or click the Mark In button on the Program Monitor.
To add an Out point to the Timeline, make sure the Timeline panel is active, and 
press the O key, or, click the Mark Out button on the Program Monitor.
E Tip: There’s also a shortcut to adding In and Out points to your Timeline based on the duration 
of a clip in your sequence. Try it now: Position the Timeline playhead so that it is over an existing clip 
segment in your sequence, and press Shift + /.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 115
Clearing In and out points
If you open a clip that has In and Out points already that you would like to remove 
or In and Out points on the Timeline that are cluttering up your view, it’s easy to 
remove them. You use the same techniques to remove In and Out points on the 
Timeline, in the Program Monitor, and in the Source Monitor.
Let’s try it:
1 Open the clip 3C_2-2, in the Double Identity bin.
This clip already has marks because we added them when we created a subclip 
from it.
2 Right-click the time ruler at the bottom of the 
Source Monitor, and take a look at the menu.
3 Select the option you need in this menu, or use 
one of the following keyboard shortcuts:
• Alt+I: Remove In Point
• Alt+O: Remove Out Point
• Alt+X: Remove In Point and Out Point
That last option, Alt+X, is particularly useful. It’s easy to remember and quickly 
removes both points.
using time rulers
The time rulers at the bottom of the Source Monitor and the top of the Timeline 
all serve the same purpose. They allow you to navigate through your clips or your 
sequences in time. Time always goes from left to right, and the location of the play-
head gives you a visual reference in relation to your clips.
Click the Timeline time ruler now, and drag left and right. The playhead moves to 
follow your mouse. As you drag across the 3D_SER1 clip, you see the contents of 
the clip in the Program Monitor. Dragging through your content in this way is called 
scrubbing.
Notice that the Source Monitor, Program Monitor, and Timeline all have zoom bars 
at the bottom of the panel. You can zoom the time ruler and navigate through the 
duration of the clip using these bars.
The zoom bar on the Program Monitor

lesson 5 
essentials of Video editing
understanding the Work area
The Work Area is an important part of the Timeline. It allows you to identify sec-
tions of your sequence you would like to render when working with special effects 
or export when creating a new video and/or audio file based on your sequence.
The functions of the Work Area can be performed by In and Out points on the 
Timeline if you prefer. To turn off the Work Area, click the Panel menu for the 
Timeline and choose Work Area bar to disable it (and again, to turn it back on).
The Work Area bar automatically extends as you add new clips to your sequence.
essential editing commands
Adobe Premiere Pro gives you two ways of editing clips into a sequence. Whether 
you use the mouse to drag and drop a clip into a sequence, use a button on the 
Source Monitor, or use a keyboard shortcut, you’ll be using an insert edit or an 
overwrite edit.
When you add a clip to a sequence that has existing clips where you want to posi-
tion the new clip, these two choices—Insert or Overwrite—will have markedly 
different effects.
Insert edit
To perform an insert edit in the Adobe Premiere Pro Timeline, do the following:
1 Drag the Timeline playhead so that it is positioned over the 3D_SER1 clip just 
after the lady turns her head (around 00:00:02:10).
When you make an edit using a shortcut key or using the buttons on the Source 
monitor, Adobe Premiere Pro uses the location of the Timeline playhead as the 
In point for the new clip in the sequence.
2 Open clip 3E_SER3 in the Source Monitor. You already added In and Out marks 
for this clip, so it’s ready to edit into the sequence.
P Note: If you add 
an In point or an Out 
point to the Timeline, 
Adobe Premiere Pro 
will use it in preference 
to the location of the 
playhead.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 117
3 Check that your Timeline has the Source track indicators lined up as in the 
following example.
Note that the clips are green because you changed them from the default label color.
4 Click the Insert button 
 on the Source Monitor.
Congratulations! You have completed an insert edit. The clip 3D_SER1 already 
in the sequence has been split, with the part after the playhead moved later to 
accommodate the new clip 3E_SER3.

118 
lesson 5 
essentials of Video editing
5 Position the playhead at the beginning of the sequence, and play through your 
edit. You can use the Home key on your keyboard to jump to the beginning, drag 
the playhead with the mouse, or press the up arrow key to jump the playhead 
between edits (the down arrow key jumps to later edits).
6 Open the clip 3B_SER4 in the Source Monitor. Once again, this clip already has 
In and Out points.
7 Position the Timeline playhead at the end of the sequence—on the end of the 
3D_SER1 clip.
8 Click either the Insert or Overwrite button on the Source Monitor. Since the 
Timeline playhead is at the end of the sequence, there are no clips in the way, 
and it makes no difference which kind of edit you perform.
Let’s insert one more.
9 Position the Timeline playhead just before the last shot in the sequence, 
between 3D_SER1 and 3B_SER4.
10 Open the clip 3A_3 in the Source Monitor, and, using In and Out points, choose 
a part you think would go well between those last two shots in the sequence.
11 Edit the clip into the sequence using an insert edit.
The timing of the edit may not be perfect, but that’s OK. The beauty of working with 
a nonlinear editing system like Adobe Premiere Pro is that you can change your 
mind about the timing later. The important thing, to begin with, is to get the order 
of the clips right.
E Tip: Hold the Shift 
key while you scrub to 
have the playhead snap 
to edits on the Timeline.
P Note: When you use 
an insert edit, it makes 
your sequence longer. 
More specifically, it 
makes the contents 
of the selected track 
longer.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 119
overwrite edit
Let’s use an overwrite edit to add a shot of our hero as the lady gets into the car.
1 Open the shot di05c_comp_v02 in the Source Monitor.
2 You’ll need to set up the Timeline carefully for this edit. Position the Timeline 
playhead just after the car door opens in the last sequence clip. There’s a 
moment when the lady is looking back at the stalker, and we want the playhead 
just before that, around 00:00:16:00.
3 Though the new clip has an audio track, it’s actually silent. We’ll keep the audio 
on the Timeline. Click the Timeline header buttons for Audio 1 and Audio 2 to 
turn them off. The difference is subtle, but they turn a darker gray when they’re 
switched off.
4 Click the Overwrite button on the Source Monitor.
The clip is added to the Timeline, but only on the Video 1 track. Once again, the 
timing might not be perfect, but you’re building a nice dramatic scene!
P Note: Notice that the sequence does not get longer when you perform an overwrite edit.
By default, when you drag and drop a clip into a sequence using the mouse, you 
perform an overwrite edit. You can change it to an insert edit by holding down the 
Control (Windows) or Command (Mac) key.
P Note: The names 
shot and clip are often 
used interchangeably.

lesson 5 
essentials of Video editing
three-point editing
To perform an edit, Adobe Premiere Pro needs to know the duration you’ll work 
with in both the Source Monitor and the Timeline. The duration of one can be 
worked out from the other, so you need only three points, not four. For example, if 
you choose four seconds of a clip in the Source Monitor, Adobe Premiere Pro auto-
matically knows it will take four seconds of time in your sequence.
In your last edit, you didn’t add an In or Out point, so Adobe Premiere Pro used the 
entire duration of the clip. You also didn’t add an In point to the Timeline, so Adobe 
Premiere Pro used the Timeline playhead as an In point.
When you made the edit, Adobe Premiere Pro aligned the presumed In point from 
the clip (the start of the clip) with the presumed In point on the Timeline (the 
playhead).
The result is that you are still performing a three-point edit, with the duration calcu-
lated from the Source Monitor clip.
What happens if you use four points?
You can use four points to make an edit. If the clip duration you select matches  
the sequence duration, the edit will take place as usual. If they are different, Adobe 
Premiere Pro will invite you to choose what you would like to happen. You can 
stretch or compress the playback speed or selectively ignore one of your In  
or Out points.
If you add an In point to the Timeline, Adobe Premiere Pro ignores the position 
of the playhead (though the visible frame in the Program panel will still reflect the 
position of the playhead and won’t visually indicate the edit In point).
You can achieve a similar result by adding just an Out point to the Timeline. In this 
case, Adobe Premiere Pro will align the Out point of the clip with the Out point on 
the Timeline when you perform the edit. You might choose to do this if you have a 
piece of timed action like a door closing at the end of a clip in the sequence and your 
new clip needs to line up in time with it.
P Note: You might apply an edit where some of your track headers are turned on without having 
source video or audio targeting them. In this case, the edit will still be applied to those tracks, but 
blank space will be added to the Timeline on those tracks.

storyboard editing
The term storyboard usually describes a series of drawings that show the intended 
camera angles and action for a film. Storyboards are often quite similar to comic 
strips, though they usually include more technical information such as intended 
camera moves, lines of dialogue, and sound effects.
You can use clip thumbnails in a bin as storyboard images. Arrange the thumbnails 
by dragging and dropping them in the order you would like the clips to appear in 
your sequence, from left to right and from top to bottom. Then drag and drop them 
into your sequence or use a special automated edit feature to add them to your 
sequence with transition effects.

122 
Lesson 5 
essentials of Video editing
Using a storyboard to build an assembly edit
An assembly edit is a sequence where the order of the clips is correct but the tim-
ing has yet to be worked out. It is common to build sequences as an assembly first, 
just to make sure the structure works, and then adjust the timing later.
You can use storyboard editing to quickly get your clips in the right order.
1 Save the current project.
2 Open Sunset Sequence.prproj in the Chapter 05 folder.
This project has a Sunset Montage sequence that already has music. We’ll add some 
shots of beautiful sunsets to the sequence.
Arranging your storyboard
Double-click the Sunset Images bin to open it. There are a series of JPEG images 
in this bin. The interpretation of the pixel aspect ratio has already been changed so 
that the images more closely match the aspect ratio of the sequence.
1 Click the Icon View button 
 on the bin to see thumbnails for the clips.
2 Drag and drop the thumbnails in the bin to position them in the order you 
would like them to appear in the sequence.
Setting the duration for still images
Since these are still images, it’s not too important to add In or Out points to them. 
If they were video clips, you could add In and Out points before creating the story-
board edit. These In and Out points are used automatically when adding the clips to 
your sequence.
Graphics and photos have any duration when you add them to the Timeline. 
However, they have a default duration that is set as you import them. The default 
duration can be changed in the Adobe Premiere Pro preferences.
Choose Edit > Preferences > General (Windows) or Adobe Premiere Pro > 
Preferences > General (Mac), and change the duration in the Still Image Default 
Duration box.
3 Make sure the Sunset Images bin is selected. Select all of the clips in the bin by 
pressing Control+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac).

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 123
4 Drag and drop the clips into the sequence, positioning them on the Video 1 track 
right at the beginning of the Timeline, above the music clip.
5 Play through your sequence to see the result.
automating your storyboard to a sequence
As well as dragging and dropping your storyboard edit into the Timeline, you can 
use the special Automate to Sequence option.
1 Undo your edit by pressing Control+Z (Windows) or Command+Z (Mac), and 
position your Timeline playhead at the very beginning of the Timeline.
2 In the bin, with your clips still selected, click the Automate to Sequence button.
Automate to Sequence, as the name suggests, automatically adds your clips to 
the currently displayed sequence. Here are the options:
• Ordering: This positions clips in your sequence in the order they appear in 
the bin or in the order you click them to select them.
• Placement: By default, the clips will be added one after another. If you have 
markers on the Timeline (perhaps in time with the beat of your music), clips 
can be added wherever there is a marker.
• Method: Choose between Insert edit and Overlay (an overwrite).
• Clip Overlap: Automatically overlaps the clips to allow for a special-effect 
transition.
• Transitions: Choose to have a video or audio transition automatically added 
between each clip.
• Ignore Options: Choose to exclude the video or audio parts of your clips.

124

essentials of Video editing
3 Set up the Automate to Sequence dialog so that the settings match the figure, 
and click OK.
This time, the clips are overlapping with a special-effect dissolve. Note that the 
overlap decreases the total duration for the sequence.

1 What do In and Out points do?
2 How do subclips help you stay organized?

4 When would you use the Work Area?
5 What is the difference between an overwrite edit and an insert edit?
6 How much of your source clip will be added to a sequence if you don’t use an 
In or Out point?
review answers
1 In the Source Monitor, In and Out points define the part of a clip you would like to 
use in a sequence. On the Timeline, In and Out points are used to define parts of 
your sequence you would like to remove. They can also be used to define parts  
of your sequence you would like to render when working with effects and parts of  
your Timeline you would like to export to create a new video file.
2 Though subclips make little difference to the way Adobe Premiere Pro plays back video 
and sound, they make it easier for you to divide up your footage into different bins. 
For larger projects with lots of longer clips, it can make a big difference to be able to 
divide up content this way.
3 Upper video tracks are always in front of lower ones.
4 You would not generally use the Work Area during normal editing. Instead, you’ll use 
it to define parts of your sequence you would like to render when working with effects 
or parts of your sequence you would like to export to make a file you can share.
5 Clips added to a sequence using an overwrite edit replace any content already in 
the sequence where they are placed. Clips added to a sequence using an insert edit 
displace existing clips, pushing them later (to the right).
6 If you don’t add In or Out points to your source clip, Adobe Premiere Pro will use the 
entire clip when you add it to a sequence. Just using one of the two marks will limit 
the part used.

Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 makes it easy to fine-tune 
your edits with markers and advanced tools for sync-
ing and locking tracks when you’re editing clips in 
your video sequence.

128 
lesson 6 Working with Clips and markers
Once you have some clips in a sequence, you’re ready for the next stage of fine-tun-
ing. You’ll move clips around inside your edit and remove the parts you don’t want. 
You can also use special markers to add helpful information to clips and sequences, 
which can be useful during your edit or when you send your sequence to other 
components in the Adobe Creative Suite CS6 family, such as Adobe After Effects 
or Adobe Encore.
Getting started
The art and craft of video editing is perhaps best demonstrated during the phase 
after your assembly edit. Once you’ve chosen your shots and put them in approxi-
mately the right order, the process of carefully adjusting the timing of your edits 
begins.
In this lesson, you’ll learn about additional controls in the Program Monitor and 
discover how markers help you stay organized during your edit.
You’ll also learn about working with clips that are already on the Timeline—the 
“nonlinear” part of nonlinear editing with Adobe Premiere Pro.
Before you begin, make sure you are using the default Editing workspace.
1 Choose Window > Workspace > Editing.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Workspace.
The Reset Current Workspace dialog opens.
3 Click Yes.
Program monitor controls
The Program Monitor is almost identical to the Source Monitor, so you should feel 
in familiar territory already, and you could be forgiven for thinking it does exactly 
the same thing. However, there are a small number of very important differences.
Let’s take a look. For this lesson, open Lesson 06.prproj.

the Program monitor vs. 
the source monitor
The key differences between the Program Monitor and the Source Monitor are as 
follows:
• 
While the Source Monitor shows the contents of a clip, the Program Monitor 
shows the contents of whichever sequence is currently displayed in the Timeline 
panel.
• 
The Source Monitor has Insert and Overwrite buttons for adding clips (or parts 
of clips) to sequences. The Program Monitor has equivalent Extract and Lift 
buttons for removing clips (or parts of clips) from sequences.
• 
While both monitors have a time ruler, the playhead on the Program Monitor 
is the playhead in the sequence you’re currently working on (the sequence is 
identified in the top left of the Program panel by name). As one moves, so does 
the other, allowing you to use either panel to change the currently displayed 
frame.
• 
When you work with special effects in Adobe Premiere Pro, you’ll preview them 
(and see the results) in the Program Monitor.
• 
The Mark In and Mark Out buttons on the Program Monitor work in the same 
way as the ones on the Source Monitor. However, In and Out marks are added to 
the currently displayed sequence when you add them to the Program Monitor.

130 
lesson 6 Working with Clips and markers
The Program Monitor displays the contents of your sequence. The sequence in the 
Timeline panel shows the clip segments and tracks, while the Program Monitor 
shows the resulting video output. The Program Monitor time ruler is a miniature 
version of the Timeline.
adding clips to the timeline with the Program monitor
You’ve already learned how to make a partial clip selection with the Source 
Monitor and then add the clip to a sequence by pressing a key, clicking a button, or 
dragging and dropping.
In fact, you can also drag and drop a clip directly into the Program Monitor to add 
it to the Timeline.
1 In the Sequences bin, open the Double Identity sequence. This is the scene you 
have already been editing.
2 Position the Timeline playhead at the end of the sequence, just after the last 
frame of clip 3B_SER4. You can hold the Shift key to snap the playhead to edits, 
or you can press the up-arrow and down-arrow keys to navigate between edits.
3 Open the clip 3A_3 from the Double Identity bin in the Source Monitor. This is 
a clip that has already been used in the sequence, but we want a different part.
4 Add an In point to the clip around 00:00:22:15, just before the car leaves the 
shot, and add an Out point around 00:00:28:00, when the man is still watching 
it offscreen.
5 Drag the clip from the Source Monitor directly into the Program Monitor.
A large Overwrite icon appears in the middle of the Program Monitor. When 
you release the mouse button, Adobe Premiere Pro adds the clip at the end of 
the sequence, and your edit is complete.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 131
Insert editing with the Program monitor
Let’s try an insert edit using the same technique.
1 Position the Timeline playhead at around 00:00:01:00, about halfway through 
the clip.
2 Open the clip 3C_2-2 from the Double Identity bin in the Source Monitor.
3 Add a new In point and an Out point to the clip, selecting about two seconds in 
total. You can see the selected duration at the bottom-right corner of the Source 
Monitor (
), displayed in white numbers.
4 While you hold down the Control (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key, drag 
the clip from the Source Monitor into the Program Monitor. When you release 
the mouse button, the clip is inserted into your sequence.
Choosing content
You may have noticed that the clip you just added, 3C_2-2, has a continuity 
problem. The man is walking in the opposite direction compared to the other shots. 
This is easy to fix using the Horizontal Flip special effect (see Lesson 13, “Adding 
Video Effects,” to learn about adding effects).
This shot is an example of the kind of problem that can be easy to fix in post. 
The only way to know for sure is to try the effect and see whether everything fits 
together.
P Note: The track patching controls are ignored when dragging clips into the Timeline panel with 
the mouse. They apply only when using a keyboard shortcut or the Insert/Overwrite buttons on the 
Source Monitor or when dragging directly into the Program Monitor.
P Note: By default, 
when you drag a clip 
into your sequence 
using the mouse, Adobe 
Premiere Pro adds 
both the video and 
audio parts of the clip. 
Also note that, in both 
cases, your clips are 
added to the sequence 
based on your track 
patching—the position 
of the source channel 
selection buttons in 
relation to the Timeline 
track headers.

132 
lesson 6 Working with Clips and markers
If you prefer to use the mouse for editing in this way, rather than the keyboard 
shortcuts or the Insert/Overwrite buttons on the Source Monitor, there is a way to 
bring in just the video or audio part of a clip.
Let’s try a combination of techniques. You’ll set up your Timeline track headers and 
then drag and drop into the Program Monitor:
1 Position the Timeline playhead at around 00:00:08:00, just before the lady leaves 
the shot.
2 Turn off Timeline track Video 1, and make sure track Video 2 is turned on. 
For the technique you’re about to use, the lowest track that is turned on 
receives the clip.
Your Timeline track headers should look like this.
3 Look at the clip 3C_2-2 in the Source Monitor. About 12 seconds in, the man 
leaves the shot. Mark an In point there, at 00:00:12:00.
4 Add an Out point at about 00:00:14:00. Only the man’s shadow remains 
on-screen at this point—a pretty dramatic end to the shot.
At the bottom of the Source Monitor, you’ll see the Drag Video Only and Drag 
Audio Only icons (
).
These icons serve two purposes:
• They tell you whether your clip has video and/or audio. If there is no video, 
for example, the filmstrip icon is dimmed. If there is no audio, the waveform 
is dimmed.
• You can drag them with the mouse to selectively edit video or audio into 
your sequence.
5 Drag the filmstrip icon from the bottom of the Source Monitor into the 
Program Monitor. You’ll see a familiar Overwrite icon in the Program Monitor. 
When you release the mouse button, just the video part of the clip is added to 
the Video 2 track on the Timeline.
6 Play your sequence from the beginning.
P Note: When using 
this technique, the track 
patching is ignored.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 133
The timing needs a little work, but there’s a nice dramatic tension. The clip you just 
added plays in front of the 3D_SER1 clip, and the start of the 3A_3 clip, changing 
the timing. Because Adobe Premiere Pro is a nonlinear editing system, it’s fine if 
the timing needs adjusting later. You’ll learn how to do this in Lesson 8, “Advanced 
Editing Techniques.”
Why are there so many ways to 
edit clips into a sequence?
This method may seem like yet another way to achieve the same thing, so what’s 
the benefit? It’s simple: As screen resolution increases and buttons get smaller, it’s 
an increasingly delicate maneuver to aim and click in the right place.
If you prefer to use the mouse to edit (rather than the keyboard), the Program 
Monitor represents a conveniently large drop zone for you to add clips to the 
Timeline. It gives you accurate placement of clips, using the track header controls 
and the position of the playhead (or your In and Out marks), while still flowing 
naturally as a mouse operation.
Controlling resolution
The powerful Mercury Playback Engine enables Adobe Premiere Pro to play mul-
tiple media types, special effects, and more in real time. Mercury uses the power of 
your computer hardware to boost performance. This means the speed of your CPU, 
the amount of RAM you have, and the speed of your hard drives are all factors that 
impact playback performance.
If your system has difficulty playing back every frame of video in your sequence 
(in the Program Monitor) or in your clip (in the Source Monitor), Adobe Premiere 
Pro can lower the playback resolution to make it easier. When you see your video 
playback stuttering, stopping, and starting, it usually indicates that your system is 
unable to play the file because of CPU speed or hard drive speed.
Though reducing the resolution means you won’t see every pixel in your pictures, it 
can dramatically improve performance, making creative work much easier. Also, it’s 
common for video to have a much higher resolution than is being displayed, simply 
because your Source and Program Monitors are smaller. This means you may not 
actually see a difference in the display when you lower the playback resolution.

134 
lesson 6 Working with Clips and markers
Playback resolution
Let’s try this:
1 Open the clip 16_6B from the Double Identity bin. By default, the clip should be 
displayed at full quality in the Source Monitor.
At the bottom right of the Source Monitor and Program 
Monitor, you’ll see the Select Playback Resolution menu.
2 Play the clip a little to get a sense of the quality when set to full resolution.
3 Change the resolution to 1/2, and play it again to compare.
Now let’s try this with something bigger.
4 Import the file RED Video.R3D from the Lesson 04 folder. This clip has a much 
higher picture resolution than the Double Identity media.
5 Open the RED Video.R3D clip in the Source Monitor, set the playback 
resolution to Full, and try to play it.
There is a good chance that your computer will not be able to play the clip 
without dropping frames. This is partly because files of this kind need a much 
faster hard drive than most computers have.
6 Try dropping the playback resolution to 1/8, and play the clip again.
There’s a good chance the clip will play just fine this time. You might find 1/4 
resolution works fine too.
Paused resolution
You can also change the playback resolution using the Panel menu for the Source 
and Program Monitors.
If you look in that menu, you’ll find a second 
option related to display resolution: Paused 
Resolution.
P Note: There are 
some resolutions you 
cannot select in some 
sequence settings. 
These are reserved for 
very high-resolution 
media like 4K video.
P Note: The playback 
resolution controls are 
exactly the same on the 
Source Monitor and the 
Program Monitor.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 135
This menu works in the same way as the playback resolution, but as you might have 
guessed, it changes the resolution you see only when the video is paused.
Most editors choose to leave Paused Resolution set to Full. This way, during play-
back you may see lower-resolution video, but when you pause, Adobe Premiere Pro 
reverts to showing you full resolution.
If you work with third-party special effects, it is possible you’ll find they do not 
make use of your system hardware as efficiently as Adobe Premiere Pro does. As a 
consequence, it might take take a long time to update the picture when you make 
changes to the effect settings. You can speed things up by lowering the paused 
resolution.
using markers
Sometimes it can be difficult to remember where you saw that useful shot or what 
you intended to do with it. Wouldn’t it be useful if you could mark clips with com-
ments and flag areas of interest for later?
What you need are markers.
Markers allow you to identify specific times in clips and sequences and add com-
ments to them. These temporal (time-based) markers are a fantastic aid to help you 
stay organized and share your intentions with co-editors.
You can use markers for personal reference or for collaboration. They can be based 
on clips or on the Timeline.
When you add a marker to a clip, it is included in the metadata for the original 
media file. This means you can open the clip in another Adobe Premiere Pro proj-
ect and see the same markers.
Open the sequence Double Identity 02 in the Sequences bin.

136 
lesson 6 Working with Clips and markers
types of markers
More than one type of marker is 
available:
• Marker: A general marker you 
can assign a name, duration, and 
comments.
• Encore chapter marker: A special 
kind of marker that Adobe Encore can 
convert into a regular chapter marker 
when making a DVD or Blu-ray disc.
• Web link: A special kind of marker 
that supported video formats such as 
QuickTime can use to automatically 
open a web page while the video 
plays. When you export your 
sequence to create a supported 
format, web link markers are included 
in the file.
• Flash cue point: A marker used by Adobe Flash. By adding these cue points 
to the Timeline in Adobe Premiere Pro, you can begin to prepare your Flash 
project while still editing your sequence.
sequence markers
Let’s add some markers.
1 Open the sequence Double Identity 02 in the Sequences bin.
Around four seconds into the sequence, you can hear the director tell the 
actress to “turn back.” Let’s leave a marker as a reminder to remove that audio.
2 Set the Timeline playhead to the moment where the director speaks, around 
00:00:03:22.
3 Click the Add Marker button on the Timeline, or right-click the Timeline time 
ruler and choose Add Marker.
A green marker is added to the Timeline, just above 
the playhead. You can use this as a simple visual 
reminder or go into the settings and change it into 
a different kind of marker.
You’ll do that in a moment, but first let’s look at this marker in the 
Markers panel.
P Note: You can right-
click and choose to add 
a marker on the time 
ruler for the Timeline, 
Source Monitor, or 
Program Monitor.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 137
4 Open the Markers panel. By default, this is grouped with the Project panel. If 
you don’t see it there, go to the Window menu and choose Markers.
The Markers panel shows you a list of markers, displayed in time order. The same 
panel shows you markers for a sequence or for a clip, depending on whether the 
Timeline panel or the Source Monitor is active.

5 Double-click the thumbnail for the marker in the Markers panel. This displays 
the Marker panel.
6 Click the Duration and type 400. Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically add 
punctuation, turning this into 00:00:04:00 (4 seconds).
7 Click into the Comments box and type a comment, such as Check the sound. 
Then click OK.
Notice that the marker now has a 
duration on the Timeline, and if 
you zoom in a little, you can see the 
comment you added. It’s also displayed in the Markers panel.
E Tip: You may need 
to click the Timeline 
panel to make it active 
before your current 
Timeline markers are 
shown in the Markers 
panel.
E Tip: Notice that the 
entries in the Marker 
menu all have keyboard 
shortcuts. Working 
with markers using the 
keyboard is generally 
much faster than using 
the mouse.

138 
lesson 6 Working with Clips and markers
Clip markers
Let’s look at markers on a clip.
1 Open the clip Seattle_Skyline.mov from the Further Media bin in the Source 
Monitor.
2 Play the clip, and while it plays, press the M key several times to add markers.
3 Look in the Markers panel. Every marker you added is listed. When clips with 
markers are added to a sequence, they retain their markers.
E Tip: You can use markers to quickly navigate your clips and sequences. If you double-click a 
marker, you’ll access the options for that marker. If you single-click it instead, Adobe Premiere Pro 
will take the playhead to the location of the marker—a fast way to find your way around.
4 Make sure the Source Monitor is active by  
clicking it. Go to the Adobe Premiere Pro 
Marker menu and choose Clear All Markers. 
Adobe Premiere Pro removes all the markers from the clip in the Source panel.
Interactive markers
Adding an interactive marker is as easy as adding a regular marker:
1 Position the playhead anywhere you would like a marker on the Timeline and click 
the Add Marker button or press M. Adobe Premiere Pro adds a regular marker.
2 Double-click the marker you have added, either on the Timeline or in the 
Markers panel.
3 Change the marker type to Flash Cue Point and add the Name and Value details 
you need by clicking the + button at the bottom of the Marker panel.
adding markers  
with adobe Prelude
Adobe Prelude is a logging and ingest application included with Creative Suite 
Production Premium. Prelude provides excellent tools for managing enormous 
quantities of footage and can add markers to clips that are fully compatible with 
Adobe Premiere Pro.
Markers are added to clips in the form of metadata, and like the markers you add in 
Adobe Premiere Pro, they will travel with your media into other applications.
If you add markers to your footage using Adobe Prelude, those markers will auto-
matically appear in Adobe Premiere Pro when you view the clips. No conversion is 
necessary because the markers Adobe Prelude adds are designed to be compatible 
with Adobe Premiere Pro.
In fact, you can even copy and paste a clip from Adobe Prelude into your Adobe 
Premiere Pro project, and the markers will automatically come too.
P Note: Markers 
can be added using a 
button or a keyboard 
shortcut. If you use the 
keyboard shortcut, it’s 
easy to add markers 
that match the beat of 
your music, because 
you can add them 
during playback.
E Tip: You can get 
to the same option to 
remove all markers—or 
a current marker—by 
right-clicking in the 
Source Monitor or 
on the Timeline and 
choosing Clear All 
Markers.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 139
automated editing to markers
In the previous lesson, you learned how to automate editing clips into a sequence 
from a bin. One of the options in that workflow is to automatically add clips to 
a sequence where you have markers. Let’s take a look at that.
1 Open the sequence Sunset Montage in the Sequences bin.
This is the sequence you worked on earlier, with music already on the Timeline 
but no clips added yet.
2 Set the Timeline playhead at the beginning and play the sequence; then press 
the M key to add an initial marker.
3 Play the sequence, and as it plays, press the M key to the music. You should 
be adding markers about two seconds apart.
4 Set your Timeline playhead to the start of the sequence. Then click into the 
Sunset Images bin and select all of the clips.
5 Click the Automate To Sequence button at the bottom of the bin. Choose 
settings to match this example, and click OK.
The clips are added to the sequence, with the first frame of each clip lined up 
to a marker, starting with the position of the playhead.
This is a very fast way of building a montage if you have music or sound effects 
you’d like to synchronize with your pictures.

140 
lesson 6 Working with Clips and markers
using sync Lock and track Lock
There are two very distinct ways to lock tracks on the Timeline:
• You can lock clips in sync, so when you use an insert edit to add a clip, 
everything stays together in time.
• You can lock a track so that no changes can be made to it.
Toggle

using sync Locks
Sync is not just for speech! It’s helpful to think of sync as any two things that are 
meant to happen at the same time. You might have a musical event that happens at 
the same time as some climatic action or something as simple as a lower-third title 
that identifies a speaker. If it happens at the same time, it’s synchronized.
Open your original Double Identity sequence in the Sequences bin.
We could use a little more of the footsteps in this sequence. Right now, we just get the 
end of the shot, and it might make more sense if we saw a little more walking first.
1 Open the shot 3C_2-2 in the Source Monitor. Add an In point around 
00:00:06:00, and add an Out point around 00:00:08:00.
2 You want to add the clip to the sequence just after the lady turns her head back, 
at 00:00:06:22. Position the Timeline playhead at that time.
3 Switch off the Sync Lock for the Video 2 
track, and turn the track off. Check that 
your Timeline is configured as in the 
following example.
Note that Video 1 is turned on, while the 
other video tracks are turned off.
4 Notice the position of the cutaway clip 
on the Video 2 track. It’s just over the cut 
between the clips 3D_SER1 and 3A_3. 
Insert the source clip into the sequence, 
and take another look at the location of the 3C_2-2 clip.
The clip 3C_2-2 stays where it is, while the other clips move to the right to 
accommodate the new clip. This is a problem, because the cutaway is now out of 
position with the clips to which it relates.
P Note: You may need 
to zoom out to see 
the other clips in the 
sequence.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 141
5 Undo by pressing Control+Z (Windows) or Command+Z (Mac OS), and let’s 
try that again with Sync Lock turned on.
6 Turn on Sync Lock for the track Video 2, and perform the insert edit again.
This time, the cutaway moves along with the other clips on the Timeline, even 
though nothing is being edited onto the Video 2 track. This is the power of sync 
locks—they keep you in sync!
If your Video 2 track had been turned on, you would not have needed its Sync 
Lock. They help you when you forget.
using track Locks
Track locks prevent you from making changes to a track. They are an excellent way 
to avoid making any kind of accidental changes to your sequence or a way of fixing 
specific tracks while you work creatively.
For example, you could lock your music track while you insert different video clips. 
By locking the music track, you can simply forget about it while editing, because no 
changes can be made to it.
Lock and unlock tracks by clicking the Toggle Track Lock button.
Clips on a locked track are highlighted with diagonal lines.
finding gaps in the timeline
Until now, you have been adding clips to a sequence. Part of the power of nonlinear 
editing is in being able to move clips around and remove the parts you don’t want.
Let’s learn a little more about working with clips on the Timeline. You’ll continue 
working with the Double Identity sequence.
selecting clips
Selection is an important part of working with Adobe Premiere Pro. Depending on 
the panel you have selected, different menu options will be available. You’ll want to 
select clips in your sequences carefully before applying any adjustments to them.
When working with clips that have video and audio, you’ll have two or more seg-
ments for each clip. You’ll have one video segment and at least one audio segment.
P Note: Overwrite 
edits do not change 
the duration of your 
sequence, so they are 
not affected by Sync 
Locks.

142 
lesson 6 Working with Clips and markers
When the video and audio clip segments come from the same original camera 
recording, they are automatically linked. Click one, and the other is automatically 
selected.
When selecting clips on the Timeline, it’s useful to think in terms of two 
approaches:
• Making selections in time using In and Out points
• Making selections by choosing clip segments
selecting a clip or range of clips
The simplest way to select a clip in a sequence is to click it. Be careful not to double-
click, because this will open the clip in the Source Monitor, ready for you to adjust 
the In or Out points.
When making selections, you’ll want to use the default Timeline tool—the 
Selection tool (
). This tool has the keyboard shortcut V.
If you hold the Shift key while you click, you can select, or deselect, additional clips.
You can also lasso to select multiple clips. Begin by clicking an empty part of the 
Timeline and then drag to create a selection box. Any clip you drag over with the 
selection box will be selected.
selecting all the clips on a track
If you want to select every clip on a track, there’s a handy tool to do just that: the 
Track Select tool (
), which has the keyboard shortcut A.
Try it now. Choose the Track Select tool and click any clip on the Video 1 track.
Every clip on that track from the one you select until the end of the sequence is 
selected. Notice that the audio for those clips is also selected because they are 
linked.
If you hold the Shift key while using the Track Select tool, you’ll select clips on 
every track from the one you select until the end of the sequence, which is useful if 
you want to add a gap to your sequence to make space for more clips.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 143
selecting audio or video only
It is common to add a clip to a sequence and later realize you don’t need the audio 
or video part of the clip. You’ll want to remove one or the other, and there is an 
easy way to make the correct selection.
Try clicking some clip segments on the Timeline by using the Selection tool 
while holding the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key. When using the Alt 
(Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, the link between video and audio parts of your 
clips is ignored. You can even lasso in this way.
splitting a clip
It is also common to add a clip to a sequence and then realize you need it in two 
parts. Perhaps you want to take just a section of a clip and use it as a cutaway, or 
maybe you want to separate the beginning and the end to make space for new clips.
You can split clips in three ways:
• Use the Razor tool (
), with the keyboard shortcut C. If you hold the Shift key 
while clicking with the Razor tool, you’ll add an edit to clips on every track.
• Go to the Sequence menu and choose Add Edit. An edit is added at the location 
of your playhead to clips on any tracks that are turned on. If you choose Add 
Edit to All Tracks, an edit is added to clips on all tracks, regardless of whether 
they are turned on.
• Use the Add Edit keyboard shortcuts. Press Control+K (Windows) 
or Command+K (Mac OS) to add an edit to selected tracks, or press 
Shift+Control+K (Windows) or Shift+Command+K (Mac OS) to add an edit to 
all tracks.
Try it with this sequence now, but be sure to undo to remove the new cuts.
Linking and unlinking clips
The link between connected video and audio segments 
can be switched off and on very easily. Just select the clip 
or clips you want to change, right-click one of them, and 
choose Unlink. You can also use the Clip menu.
You can link a clip with its audio again by selecting both, 
right-clicking one of the segments, and choosing Link. There’s no harm in linking or 
unlinking clips—it won’t change the way Adobe Premiere Pro plays your sequence. 
It’s just a question of giving you the flexibility to work with clips the way you want.

144 
lesson 6 Working with Clips and markers
moving clips
Insert edits and overwrite edits add new clips to sequences in dramatically different 
ways. Insert edits push existing clips out of the way, while overwrite edits simply 
replace them. This theme of having two ways of working with clips extends to the 
techniques you’ll employ to move clips around the Timeline and to remove clips 
from the Timeline.
When moving clips using the Insert mode, you may want to ensure you have the 
sync locks on for your tracks to avoid any possible loss of sync.
Let’s try a few techniques.
Dragging clips
At the top left of the Timeline panel, you’ll see the Snap (
) button. When this is 
on, clip segments will snap automatically to the edges of each other. This simple but 
tremendously useful feature will help you accurately position clip segments.
1 Click the last clip on the Timeline, 3A_3, and drag and drop it a little to the 
right.
Because there are no clips after this one, you simply introduce a gap before the 
clip. No other clips are affected.
2 Drag the clip back to its original position. If you move the mouse slowly and 
if Snap mode is on, you’ll notice the clip segment slightly jumps into position. 
When this happens, you can be confident it is perfectly positioned.
3 Drag the clip to the left so it’s positioned earlier in the Timeline. Slowly drag 
the clip until it snaps to the beginning of the clip before. When you release the 
mouse button, the clip simply replaces the earlier clip.
When you drag and drop clips, the default mode is Overwrite.
4 Undo to restore the clip to its original position.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 145
rearranging clips in a sequence
If you hold the Control (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key while you drag clips 
on the Timeline, Adobe Premiere Pro uses Insert mode.
The third clip in our sequence shows the lady reacting and turning around, fol-
lowed by a shot of the man flicking his knife. It might be more dramatic if these two 
clips swapped places. Let’s try it:
1 Drag and drop the fourth clip on the Timeline, 3E_SER3, to the left of the third 
clip, 3D_SER1. Once you have begun dragging, hold the Control key (Windows) 
or Command key (Mac OS), releasing the key after you have dropped the clip.
2 Play through the result. This creates the edit you want, but it introduces a gap 
where the clip 3E_SER3 used to be.
Let’s try that again with an additional modifier key.
3 Undo to restore the clips to their original positions.
4 Holding Control+Alt (Windows) or Command+Alt (Mac OS), drag and drop 
the fourth clip on the Timeline, 3E_SER3, before the third clip, 3D_SER1.
This time, no gap is left in the sequence. Play through the edit to see the result.
E Tip: You may need 
to zoom in to the 
Timeline to see the clips 
clearly and move them 
easily.
E Tip: Be careful when 
dropping the clip into 
position. The ends of 
clips snap to edges just 
as the beginnings do.

146 
lesson 6 Working with Clips and markers
using the clipboard
You can copy and paste clip segments on the Timeline just as you might copy and 
paste text in a word processor.
1 Select any clip segment (or segments) you want to copy and then simply press 
Control+C (Windows) or Command+C (Mac OS) to add them to the clipboard.
2 Position your playhead where you would like to paste the clips you copied, and 
press Control+V (Windows) or Command+V (Mac OS).
Adobe Premiere Pro adds copies of the clips to your sequence based on the tracks 
you enable. The lowest enabled track receives the clip (or clips).
extracting and deleting segments
Now that you know how to add clips to a sequence and how to move them around, 
you just need to learn how to remove them. Once again, you’ll be operating in 
Insert or Overwrite mode.
There are two ways of selecting parts of a sequence you want to remove. You can use 
In and Out points, combined with track selections, or you can select clip segments.
Lift
Open the sequence Double Identity 03 in the Sequences bin.
This sequence has some unwanted extra clips. Earlier, you changed the label colors 
for the Double Identity clips from the default, Iris, to Forest. These clips have been 
restored to the default so they are easier to see on the Timeline.
A lift edit will remove the selected part of a sequence, leaving blank space. It’s a 
similar kind of edit to an overwrite edit but in reverse.
You’ll need to set In and Out points on the Timeline to select the part that will be 
removed. You can do this by positioning the playhead and pressing I or O. You can 
also use a handy shortcut.
1 Position the playhead so that it is over the clip 16B_6B.
2 Make sure the Video 1 track header is turned on, and press Shift+/.
Adobe Premiere Pro automatically adds an In point and an Out point that 
matches the beginning and end of the clip. You should see a blue highlight that 
shows the selected part of the sequence.
All of the tracks are already selected, so there’s no need to do anything else to 
prepare for the lift edit.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 147
3 Click the Lift button (
) at the bottom of the Program Monitor, or press 
the ; key.
Adobe Premiere Pro removes the part of the sequence you selected, leaving a gap 
behind. This might be fine on another occasion, but we don’t want the gap. You 
could right-click inside the gap and choose Ripple Delete, but let’s use Extract 
instead, try using an extract edit.
extract
An extract edit removes the selected part of your sequence and does not leave 
a gap. It’s similar to an insert edit, but in reverse.
1 Undo the last edit.
2 Click the Extract button (
) at the bottom of the Program Monitor, or 
press the ' key.
This time, Adobe Premiere Pro removes the selected part of the sequence and 
doesn’t leave a gap.
Delete and ripple Delete
There are also two ways of removing clips by selecting segments: Delete and Ripple 
Delete.
Click the second unwanted clip, di01b_ser1_comp, and try these two options:
• Pressing the Delete key removes the selected clip (or clips), leaving a gap 
behind. This is the same as a lift edit.
• Pressing Shift+Delete removes the selected clip (or clips) without leaving a 
gap behind. This is the same as an extract edit. If you’re using a Mac keyboard 
without a dedicated Delete key, use the Function key to convert the Backspace 
key into a Delete key.

148 
lesson 6 Working with Clips and markers
Disabling a clip
Just as you can turn a track output off or on, you can also turn off and on individual 
clips. Clips that you disable are still in your sequence, but they cannot be seen or 
heard.
This is a useful feature for selectively hiding parts of a complex, multilayered 
sequence when you want to see background layers.
Try this on the cutaway shot of the man’s shadow.
1 Right-click the clip 3C_2-2 on the Video 2 track, and 
choose Enable.
This disables the clip by deselecting the Enable option. 
Play through that part of the sequence, and you’ll notice 
that the clip is present but you can no longer see it.
2 Right-click the clip again, and choose Enable. This 
reenables the clip.

review questions
1 When dragging clips into the Program Monitor, what modifier key (Control/Control, 
Shift, or Alt) do you use to make an insert edit rather than an overwrite edit?
2 How do you drag and drop just the video or audio part of a clip into a sequence?
3
How do you reduce the playback resolution in the Source or Program Monitor?
4
How do you add a marker to a clip or sequence?
5
What is the difference between an extract edit and a lift edit?
6
What is the difference between the Delete and Ripple Delete functions?
review answers
1 Hold the Control (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key when dragging a clip into the 
Program Monitor to make an insert edit rather than an overwrite edit.
2 Rather than grabbing the picture in the Source Monitor, drag and drop the filmstrip 
icon or the audio waveform icon to select only the video or audio part of the clip.
3 Use the Select Playback Resolution menu at the bottom of the monitor to change the 
playback resolution.
4 To add a marker, click the Add Marker button at the bottom of the monitor or on the 
Timeline or press the M key or use the Marker menu.
5 When you extract a section of your sequence using In and Out points, no gap is left 
behind. When you lift, a gap remains.
6 When you delete a clip, a gap is left behind. When you ripple delete a clip, no gap 
is left.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn about the following:
• Understanding transitions
• Understanding edit points and handles
• Adding video transitions
• Modifying transitions
• Fine-tuning transitions
• Applying transitions to multiple clips at once
• Using audio transitions
This lesson will take approximately 60 minutes.

Transitions can help create a seamless transition 
between two video or audio clips. Video transi-
tions are often used to signify a transition in time or 
location. Audio transitions are a useful way to avoid 
abrupt edits that jar the listener.

152 
lesson 7 
Adding transitions
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll learn to use transitions between video and audio clips. 
Transitions are a common practice when editing video because they can be used to 
help the overall project flow more smoothly. You’ll learn best practices for choosing 
transitions selectively.
For this lesson, you’ll use a new project file.
1 Start Adobe Premiere Pro CS6, and open the project Lesson 07.prproj.
The sequence 01 Transitions should already be open.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Effects.
This changes the workspace to the preset that the Adobe Premiere Pro 
development team created to make it easier to work with transitions and effects.
3 If necessary, click the Effects panel to make it active.
What are transitions?
Adobe Premiere Pro offers several  
special effects and animations to 
help you bridge neighboring clips 
in the Timeline. These transi-
tions—such as dissolves, page 
wipes, spinning screens, and the 
like—provide a nice way to ease 
viewers from one scene to the 
next. Occasionally, a transition 
can also be used to grab the 
viewer’s attention to help them 
notice a major jump in the story.
Adding transitions to your proj-
ect is an art, though. Applying 
them starts simply enough; it’s a 
mere drag-and-drop process. The 
skill comes in their placement, 
length, and parameters, such as 
direction, motion, and start/end 
locations.
Most transition work takes place 
in the Effect Controls panel. In 
addition to the various options 

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 153
unique to each transition, that panel displays an A/B timeline. This feature makes it 
easy to move transitions relative to the edit point, change the transition duration, 
and apply transitions to clips that don’t have sufficient head or tail frames. With 
Adobe Premiere Pro, you can also apply a transition to a group of clips.
When to use transitions
Transitions are most effective when you need to remove a distracting edit that 
makes your sequence appear jarring when viewed. For example, you may switch 
from indoors to outdoors in a video, or you may jump forward in time by several 
hours. An animated transition or a dissolve helps the viewer understand that there 
has been a passing of time or a notable change in location.
Transitions have become part of the standard narrative used in video editing. For 
many years, viewers have gotten used to seeing transitions applied in standard 
ways, such as the changing of one section to another in a video or the slow fade to 
black at the end of a scene. The key with transitions is to use restraint.
Best practices with transitions
Many users have a tendency to overuse transitions. Some come to rely on them as a 
crutch and think that they add visual interest. Once you discover the many options 
Adobe Premiere Pro offers, you may be tempted to use them for every edit. Don’t!
Transitions should be thought of as seasoning or spice. When added in small 
amounts and at the right time, they can make a meal tastier and more enjoyable. 
When overdone, they can quickly ruin that meal. It is highly recommended that 
you exercise restraint with transitions.

154 
lesson 7 
Adding transitions
Watch some TV news stories. Most use cuts-only edits. It’s unlikely you’ll see any 
transitions. Why? Time is a factor, but most stations these days have ready access to 
nonlinear editors (NLEs) such as Adobe Premiere Pro, and it takes almost no time 
to add a transition when using an NLE.
P Note: Transitions are fun and interesting to add to your project. However, overusing them is 
the giveaway of an amateur video. When choosing a transition, make sure it adds meaning to your 
project rather than showing off how many editing tricks you know. Watch your favorite movies and 
TV shows to learn how the pros use transitions.
The principal reason for the lack of transitions is that they can be distracting. If a 
TV news editor uses one, it’s for a purpose. Their most frequent use in newsroom 
editing bays is to take what would have been a jarring or abrupt edit—often called a 
jump cut—and make it more palatable.
That’s not to say transitions don’t have their place in carefully planned stories. 
Consider the Star Wars movies with all their highly stylized transitions, such 
as obvious, slow wipes. Each of those transitions has a purpose. George Lucas 
purposely created a look reminiscent of old serialized movies and TV shows. 
Specifically, they send a clear message to the audience: “Pay attention. We’re transi-
tioning across space and time.”
edit points and handles
Two crucial concepts to understand with transitions are edit points and handles. 
An edit point is the point in your Timeline where one clip ends and the next begins. 
These are easy to see because Adobe Premiere Pro draws vertical lines to show 
where one clip ends and another begins (much like two bricks next to each other).
A handle is the trickier item to understand. During the process of editing, you’ll 
end up with portions of clips that you won’t use in your project. When you first 
edited a clip into your Timeline, you set In and Out points to define each shot. The 
handle between a clip’s Media Start time and In point is called the head material, 
and the handle between a clip’s Out point and Media End time is called the tail
material.
If you see a little triangle in the upper-right or upper-left corner of a clip, it means 
you’ve reached the end of that clip. There are no additional frames past the begin-
ning or the end of the clip. For transitions to work smoothly, you need handles. 
When your clip has handles, there are no triangles displayed in the upper corners 
of the clip.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 155
A video clip with handles. The ghosted area in the Timeline simulates the handle area and would not 
be visible normally.
Portions of a clip that are not normally visible will be used when you apply a transi-
tion. Essentially, the outgoing clip is overlapped with the incoming clip to create 
an area for transitions to occur. For example, if you apply a two-second, Cross 
Dissolve transition centered between two video clips, you’d need a two-second 
handle on both clips (one additional second that would normally be invisible in the 
Timeline panel).
adding video transitions
Adobe Premiere Pro contains several video transitions (plus three audio transi-
tions). You’ll find two types of video transitions inside Adobe Premiere Pro. The 
most commonly used transitions are those in the Video Transitions group. These 
are organized into six categories based on style. You’ll also find additional transi-
tions in the Video Effects group in the Effects panel. These are meant to be applied 
to an entire clip and can be used to reveal the footage (typically between its In and 
Out points). This second category works well for superimposing text or graphics.
A. Media start
B. Handle
C. In point
D. Out point
E. Handle
F. Media end
P Note: If you need 
more transitions, check 
the Adobe website. 
Just visit www.adobe.
com/products/premiere/
extend.html and click 
the Plug-in tab. There, 
you’ll find several third-
party effects to explore.

156 
lesson 7 
Adding transitions
applying a single-sided transition
The easiest transition to understand is one that applies to only a single clip. This 
could be the first or last clip in a sequence that you want to apply a dissolve to 
(creating a fade from or to black). You might also use a single-sided transition when 
you fade on a superimposed graphic such as a lower-third or title.
Let’s give it a try.
1 Use the opened sequence named 01 Transitions.
This sequence has four video clips inserted. The clips have adequate handles for 
transitions.
2 The Effects panel should be docked with the Project panel. In the Effects panel, 
open the Video Transitions > Dissolve bin. Find the Cross Dissolve effect.
You can use the Search field to locate it by name or open folders of presets.
3 Drag the effect onto the start of the first  
video clip. You can set the effect only to 
Start At Cut for the first clip.
The Start at Cut icon is displayed to 
indicate that this is a single-sided 
transition. 
4 Drag the Cross Dissolve effect onto the  
end of the last video clip. You can set 
the effect to End At Cut for only the 
last clip.
The End at Cut icon clearly shows that 
the effect will start before the end of the 
clip and complete by the time it reaches 
the clip’s end. In this case, it clearly 
shows that the Cross Dissolve transition will fade out the clip without extending 
the duration of the last clip.
5 Review the transitions by playing the sequence back a few times.
You should see a simple fade-up at the start of the sequence and a fade to black 
at the end. This is a common way to start and end a video segment.
P Note: You can copy a transition from one part of a sequence to another. Just select the transition 
using your mouse and choose Edit > Copy. Then move the playhead to another edit point where you 
want the transition, and choose Edit > Paste.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 157
applying a transition between two clips
Applying a transition between two clips starts with a simple drag-and-drop pro-
cess. Let’s try creating an animation between several clips. For purposes of explora-
tion, we’ll break the rules and try a few different options.
1 Continue working with the previous sequence named 01 Transitions.
To make the transition you are about to apply easier to see, you need to zoom in 
closer to the Timeline.
2 Put the playhead at the edit point  
between clip 1 and clip 2 on the 
Timeline, and then press the equal (=) 
sign three times to zoom in fairly close.
3 Drag the Dip to White transition from  
the Dissolve category onto the edit 
point between clip 1 and clip 2.
Let’s continue exploring available 
effects.
4 Drag the Push transition from the Slide category onto the edit point between 
clip 2 and clip 3, making sure the transition is selected.
In the Effect Controls panel, change the direction of the clip from West to East.
5 Drag the Flip Over transition from the  
3D Motion category onto the edit 
point between clip 3 and clip 4.
6 Review the sequence by playing it back 
from beginning to end a few times.
Now do you understand the suggestion 
to use transitions with restraint? Let’s try replacing an existing effect.
7 Drag the Split transition from the Slide category onto the existing effect between 
clip 2 and clip 3.

158 
lesson 7 
Adding transitions
8 In the Effect Controls panel,  
set Border Width to 7 and 
Anti-aliasing Quality to 
Medium to create a thin 
black border that accompa-
nies the edge of the wipe.
The anti-aliasing method reduces any potential flicker when the line animates.
9 Watch the sequence play back to see the change in the transition.
Each transition has a 30-frame duration by default. In the case of this sequence, 
this was slightly problematic. The material being edited is a 24p sequence, so a 
30-frame transition is 1.25 seconds long. The default can be changed to match 
your sequence settings by opening the General tab of the Preferences and 
entering a new default value.
10 Choose Edit > Preferences > General (Windows) or Premiere Pro > 
Preferences > General (Mac OS).
11 If you want your transitions to default to one second, enter a value of 24 frames 
for Video Transition Default Duration and click OK.
The existing transitions already applied stay the same, but any future ones you 
add will be the new duration. Be sure to update this value to match your specific 
needs if you’re using 25, 30, or 60 fps sequence settings, keeping in mind that 
few transitions employed by professional editors are actually a full second in 
duration. You’ll learn how to customize transitions more later in the lesson.
P Note: When you 
drag a new video or 
audio transition from 
the Effects panel on top 
of an existing transition, 
it will replace the 
existing effect. It also 
preserves the alignment 
and duration of the 
previous transition. This 
is an easy way to swap 
out transitions and 
experiment.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 159
applying transitions to multiple clips at once
So far, you’ve been applying transitions to video clips. However, you can also apply 
transitions to still images, graphics, color mattes, and even audio, as you will see in 
the next section of this lesson.
A common project that editors encounter is the photo montage. Often these mon-
tages look nice with transitions between photos. Applying transitions one at a time 
for 100 images would not be fun. Adobe Premiere Pro makes it easy to automate 
this process by allowing the default transition (that you define) to be added to any 
group of contiguous or noncontiguous clips:
1 In the Project panel, double-click to load the sequence 02 Slideshow.
This sequence has several images edited sequentially.
2 Play the Timeline by pressing the spacebar.
You’ll notice that there is a cut between each clip.
3 Press the backslash (\) key to zoom out the Timeline to make the whole 
sequence visible.
4 With the Selection tool, draw a marquee around all the clips to select them.
5 Choose Sequence > Apply Default Transitions to Selection.
This will apply the default transition between all of the clips currently selected. 
The standard transition is a one-second Cross Dissolve effect. However, you can 
change the default transition by right-clicking an effect in the Effects panel and 
choosing Set Selected as Default Transition.

160 
lesson 7 
Adding transitions
sequence display changes
When you add a transition to a sequence, a short red horizontal line may appear above that transition. 
The red line means that this portion of the sequence must be rendered before you can record it to 
tape or create a file of your finished project.
Rendering happens automatically when you export your project, but you can choose to render 
selected portions of your sequence to make those sections display more smoothly on slower comput-
ers. To do that, slide the handles of the Work Area bar (shown here) to the ends of the red render-
ing line (they will snap to those points). You can also use the Sequence > Apply Video Transition or 
Sequence > Apply Audio Transition command.
Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to start the render.
Adobe Premiere Pro will create a video clip of that segment (tucked away in the Preview Files folder) 
and will change the line from red to green.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 161
6 Add a Cross Dissolve effect to the start and end of the sequence.
7 Play the Timeline, and notice the difference a Cross Dissolve transition makes 
between images in a photo montage.
using a/B mode to fine-tune a transition
The Effect Controls panel’s A/B editing mode splits a single video track into two 
subtracks. What would normally be two consecutive and contiguous clips on a 
single track are now displayed as individual clips on separate subtracks, giving you 
the option to apply a transition between them, to manipulate their head and tail 
frames (or handles), and to change other transition elements.
Changing parameters in the effect Controls panel
All transitions in Adobe Premiere Pro can be customized. Some effects have very 
few customizable properties (such as duration or starting point). Other effects offer 
more options for direction, color, border, and so on. The major benefit of the Effect 
Controls panel is that you can see the outgoing and incoming footage. This makes it 
easy to adjust the positioning of an effect or even to trim sources.
Let’s modify a transition.
1 Switch back to the sequence 01 Transitions.
2 Double-click the Dip to White transition you added between clips 1 and 2.
The Effect Controls panel opens with the transition loaded.
3 If necessary, select the Show Actual Sources option to view frames from the 
actual clips.
P Note: If you’re 
working with clips 
that have audio and 
video linked, you can 
select just the video or 
audio portions. Simply 
Alt+drag (Windows) or 
Option+drag (Mac OS) 
with the Selection tool 
to select just the audio 
or video clips that you 
want to affect. Then 
choose Sequence > 
Apply Default 
Transitions to Selection. 
The command works 
only with double-sided 
transitions, however.

lesson 7 
Adding transitions
It’s now easier to judge changes you make to the transition’s source clips.
4 Click the alignment menu and switch the effect to Start at Cut.
The transitions icon switches to show the new position.
5 Click the Play the Transition button to play back the transition in the panel.
6 Click the duration field and enter 1:12 for a 1.5-second duration effect.
Play back the transition to see the changes. Let’s customize the next effect.
7 Click the transition between clip 2 and clip 3 in the Timeline.
8 In the Effect Controls panel, hover the pointer over the edit line at the center of 
the transition rectangle.
That’s the edit point between the two clips, and the pointer that appears there is 
the Rolling Edit tool. This tool lets you reposition the effect.
9 Drag the Rolling Edit tool left and right, and note how the changing Out 
point of the left clip and the changing In point of the right clip show up in 
the Program Monitor. This is also called trimming, and you’ll explore it more in 
Chapter 8, “Advanced Editing Techniques.”
P Note: You might 
need to expand the 
width of the Effect 
Controls panel to make 
the Show/Hide Timeline 
View button available. 
Also, the Effect Controls 
Timeline may already 
be visible. Clicking the 
Show/Hide Timeline 
View button in the 
Effect Controls panel 
toggles it on and off.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 163
10 Move the pointer slightly to the left or right of the edit line, and notice that it 
changes to the Slide tool.
Using the Slide tool changes the start and end points of the transition without 
changing its overall length (the default duration is one second). The new start 
and end points show up in the Program Monitor, but unlike using the Rolling 
Edit tool, moving the transition rectangle by using the Slide tool does not 
change the edit point between the two clips.
11 Use the Slide tool to drag the transition rectangle left and right.
12 Continue to experiment with the controls for the remaining effects.
Dealing with inadequate (or nonexistent) 
head or tail handles
If you try to extend a transition for a clip that doesn’t have enough frames as 
handle, the transition appears but has diagonal warning bars through it. This means 
Adobe Premiere Pro is using a freeze frame to extend the duration of the clip, 
which is usually undesirable.
You can adjust the duration and position of the transition to resolve the issue.
1 In the Project panel, double-click the sequence 03 Handles.
2 Locate the first edit in the sequence.
Notice that the two clips on the Timeline have no “heads or tails.” You can 
tell this because of the little triangles in the corners of the clips; the triangles 
indicate the very ends of the clips.

164 
lesson 7 
Adding transitions
3 Using the Ripple Edit tool, drag the right edge of the first clip to the left. Drag 
approximately 2:00 to shorten the first clip and then release.
The clip after the edit point ripples to close the gap. Notice that the little 
triangle at the end of that clip is no longer visible.
4 Drag a Cross Dissolve effect onto the edit point between the two clips.
You can only drag the transition to start at the edit point because the handle 
is insufficient to create a dissolve into the incoming clip without using freeze 
frames.
5 With the standard Selection tool, click the transition to load it in the Effect 
Controls panel. You may need to zoom in to make it easier to select a transition.
6 Set the duration of the effect to 2:00.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 165
7 Change the alignment of the transition to Center at Cut.
In the Effect Controls panel, note that the transition rectangle has parallel 
diagonal lines running through it, indicating the lack of head frames.
8 Drag the playhead slowly through the entire transition, and watch how it works:
• For the first half of the transition (up to the edit point), the B clip is a freeze 
frame, while the A clip continues to play.
• At the edit point, the A clip and the B clip start to play.
9 You have several ways to fix the issue:
• You can change the duration or alignment of the effect.
• You can use the Rolling edit tool to reposition the transition.
• You can use the Ripple edit tool to shorten a clip.
You’ll learn more about the Ripple Edit and Rolling Edit tools in the next lesson.
P Note: Using the 
Rolling Edit tool lets you 
move the left or right 
but does not change 
the overall length of the 
sequence.

166 
lesson 7 
Adding transitions
adding audio transitions
The use of audio transitions can improve a sequence’s soundtrack by removing 
unwanted audio pops or abrupt edits. The use of a crossfade transition at the end 
of (or between) audio clips is a fast way to add a fade-in, fade-out, or fade between 
your audio clips.
Creating a crossfade
Because all audio is different, you’ll find three styles of crossfades to choose from. 
The subtle differences between the types are important to understand if you want 
to achieve a professional mix.
• Constant Gain: The Constant Gain crossfade (as its name implies) transitions 
audio by using a constant audio gain (volume) between the clips. Some find 
this transition type useful. It can, however, create a very sudden transition in 
the audio as the sound of the outgoing clip fades out and the incoming clip 
then fades in at an equal gain. The Constant Gain crossfade is most useful in 
situations where you do not want much blending between two clips but rather 
more of a dip out and in between the clips.
• Constant Power: The default audio transition in Adobe Premiere Pro creates 
a smooth, gradual transition between two audio clips. The Constant Power 
crossfade is very similar to how a video dissolve works. When applied, the 
outgoing clip at first slowly fades out and then fades out at a faster rate toward 
the end of the clip. On the incoming clip, the opposite occurs. The audio level 
increases quickly at the start of the incoming clip and slower toward the end 
of the transition. This crossfade is useful in most situations where you want a 
blending between clips.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 167
• Exponential Fade: This effect is similar to the Constant Power crossfade. 
The Exponential Fade transition is a fairly smooth fade between clips. It uses 
a logarithmic curve to fade out and fade up audio. This results in very good 
natural blending between audio clips. Some prefer the Exponential Fade 
transition when performing a single-sided transition (such as fading in a clip 
from silence at the start or end of a program).
applying audio transitions
There are several ways to apply an audio crossfade to a sequence. You can, of 
course, drag and drop a transition, but there are also useful shortcuts for speeding 
up the process. Let’s take a look at the three available methods.
1 Double-click to load the sequence 04 Audio.
The sequence has several different audio clips in a Timeline.
2 In the Audio Transitions bin in the Effects panel, open the Crossfade bin.
3 Drag the Exponential Fade transition to the start of the first audio clip.
4 Move to the end of the sequence.
5 Right-click the final edit point in the Timeline and choose Apply Default 
Transitions.

168 
lesson 7 
Adding transitions
Adobe Premiere Pro adds a new video and audio transition. To add only an 
audio transition, hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key when 
right-clicking.
The Constant Power transition is added to the end audio clip as a transition to 
create a smooth blend as the audio ends.
6 Drag the length of the audio transition to be longer or shorter, and listen to the 
effect when you play the Timeline.
7 To polish the project, add a Video Cross Dissolve transition to the beginning 
and end of the sequence by moving the playhead near the beginning and 
pressing Control+D (Windows) or Command+D (Mac OS) to add the default 
video transition.
Repeat this for the end of the clip. This will create a fade from black at the 
beginning and a fade to black at the end. Now let’s add a series of short audio 
dissolves to smooth out the background sound.
8 With the Selection tool, hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key 
and lasso all of the audio clips on track Audio 1. The Alt (Windows) or Option 
(Mac OS) key lets you temporarily unlink the audio clips from the video clips to 
isolate the transitions.
9 Choose Sequence > Apply Default Transitions to Selection.
10 Play back the Timeline and evaluate the changes you made.
E Tip: Shift+Command+D (Mac OS) or Shift+Ctrl+D (Windows) is the keyboard shortcut for adding 
the default audio transition to the edit point near the playhead on the selected audio track—a very 
fast way to add a fade-in or fade-out to an audio track.
P Note: Another way 
to change the duration 
of the transition is 
to drag the edge of 
the transition on the 
Timeline. Drag the right 
edge of the transition 
left and right with the 
standard Selection tool 
to adjust its length.
P Note: The selection 
of clips does not have 
to be contiguous. You 
can Shift+click clips to 
select only a portion 
of the clips on the 
Timeline.

The basic editing commands in Adobe Premiere Pro 
CS6 are relatively easy to master. Several advanced 
techniques, though, take time to learn. These tech-
niques truly accelerate editing and provide a level of 
professional refinement that makes the extra effort to 
learn them truly worth it.

172 
lesson 8 
Advanced editing techniques
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll use several short sequences to explore advanced editing 
concepts in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6. The goal here is to get hands-on with the 
techniques you’ll need for advanced editing. To do this, we’ll use several short 
sequences to illustrate the concepts.
For this lesson, you’ll use a new project file.
1 Start Adobe Premiere Pro, and open the project Lesson 08.prproj.
The sequence 01 Four Point should already be open, but if it’s not, open it now.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Editing.
This changes the workspace to the preset that the Adobe Premiere Pro 
development team created to make it easier to work with transitions and effects.
four-point editing
In previous lessons, you used the standard technique of three-point editing. You 
used three In and Out points (split between the Source Monitor panel as well as 
the Program Monitor or Timeline panel) to describe the source, duration, and loca-
tion of an edit.
But what happens when you have four points defined?
The short answer is that you have a discrepancy that must be resolved. Most likely, 
the duration you’ve set in the Program Monitor differs from the duration you’ve 
chosen in the Program Monitor or Timeline panel. At this point, Adobe Premiere 
Pro alerts you to the discrepancy and asks you to make an important decision.
editing options for four-point edits
If you’ve defined a four-point edit, Adobe Premiere Pro opens the Fit Clip dialog 
to alert you to the problem. You’ll need to choose from five options to resolve the 
conflict. You can ignore one of the four points or change the speed of the clip.
• Change Clip Speed (Fit to Fill): The first choice assumes that you set four 
points deliberately. Adobe Premiere Pro preserves the source clip’s In and Out 
points but adjusts its speed to match the duration you set in the Timeline or 
Program Monitor panel.
• Ignore Source In Point: If you choose this option, the source clip’s In point 
is ignored and dynamically determined by Adobe Premiere Pro, effectively 
converting your edit back to a three-point edit. The new duration matches 
E Tip: A four-point 
edit is often a mistake, 
one caused by setting 
too many points. The 
reason to use one is 
when you want to 
define which parts of a 
source clip should be 
used as well as define a 
different duration that 
you need the footage 
to fill in the Timeline. In 
this case, you will use 
the Change Clip Speed 
option (also called 
Fit to Fill).

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 173
what’s set in the Timeline or Program Monitor panel. This option is available 
only if the source clip is longer than the range set in the sequence.
• Ignore Source Out Point: When you select this option, the source clip’s Out 
point is ignored and dynamically determined by Adobe Premiere Pro, changing 
to a three-point edit. The new duration matches what’s set in the Timeline or 
Program Monitor panel. This option is also available only if the source clip is 
longer than the targeted duration.
• Ignore Sequence In Point: This choice tells Adobe Premiere Pro to ignore the 
In point you’ve set in the sequence and perform a three-point edit using only 
the sequence Out point. If the clip is shorter than the duration defined, you 
can end up with unwanted video left behind inside your original In point in the 
sequence from the shot you were trying to cover.
• Ignore Sequence Out Point: This option is similar to the previous one, 
in that it will ignore the Out point in the sequence you set and perform a 
three-point edit.
making a four-point edit
Let’s specifically make a four-point edit. The goal in this exercise is to change the 
duration of the clip to match the duration set in the targeted sequence.
1 If it’s not loaded already, locate 01 Four Point in the Project panel and load the 
sequence.
This sequence contains a rough edit that we want to cut a new shot into. The 
clip we’ll use is a different duration than what’s needed for the cutaway angle.
2 Scroll through the sequence and locate the section with In and Out marks 
already set. You should see a highlighted range in the Timeline panel.
3 Locate the bin Clips to Load, and load the clip multicam_02.mov into the 
Source Monitor panel.
A range should already be set in the clip.

174 
lesson 8 
Advanced editing techniques
4 Click the headers of the tracks in the Timeline panel. Make sure that the video 
and audio are patched to track V1.
5 Click the Overwrite button to make the edit.
The Fit Clip dialog appears.
6 In the Fit Clip dialog, choose the  
Change Clip Speed (Fit to Fill) 
option. Click OK.
The edit is made in the Timeline. 
You’ll see numbers in the edited 
clip that indicate the speed change.
7 Watch the sequence to see the 
effects of your edit and the speed 
change.
retiming clips
In the previous exercise, you used one of the methods Adobe Premiere Pro offers 
for changing the speed of a clip. There are many reasons to change the speed of 
a clip, including technical necessity and artistic impact. Slow motion is one of 
the most often used effects in video production. It can be an effective way to add 
drama or to give the viewer more time to study or savor a moment. In this lesson, 
you will review static speed changes, the time-remapping feature, and some other 
tools that let you make time changes to clips.
Changing the speed/duration of a clip
Although slow motion is the most commonly used time change, speeding up clips 
is a useful effect as well. The Speed/Duration command can change the timing for 
a clip in two very different ways. You can precisely change the duration of a clip to 
reach a certain time. Alternately, you can change the percentage of playback (such 
as 50 percent to slow down a clip).

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 175
Let’s explore the technique.
1 In the Project panel, load the sequence 02 Speed/Duration.
2 Right-click the Medieval_Hero_01 clip, and choose Speed/Duration from the 
context menu. Alternatively, you can select the clip in the Timeline panel and 
choose Clip > Speed/Duration.
3 You now have several options to control how 
the clips play back. Consider these choices:
•
Leave Duration and Speed ganged together 
(a chain icon between them). You can then 
enter a new duration or speed. Entering data 
in one field impacts the other.
•
Click the Gang button so that it shows a 
broken link. You can then enter a new speed 
for the clip without changing its duration (if 
the clip isn’t long enough, empty frames are inserted).
•
Once the clips are unganged, you can also change duration without changing 
speed. Shortening a clip will leave a gap in the Timeline. If the clip has 
another immediately after it in the Timeline, making the clip longer has no 
effect, because the clip cannot ripple by default. In this case, select the Ripple 
Edit, Shift Trailing Clips option.
•
To play a clip backward, select the Reverse Speed option. You’ll see a 
negative symbol next to the speed value in the Timeline panel.
•
If your clip has audio, consider selecting the Maintain Audio Pitch checkbox. 
This will attempt to maintain the clip’s current pitch while the speed or 
duration changes. Without this option enabled, you will get a speed-up or 
slow-motion audio effect. It will still allow you to change the speed of the 
clip, but it will apply a proportionate amount of pitch correction to make the 
overall pitch match as closely as possible to the original source. This option 
is effective only for slight speed changes; dramatic resampling will produce 
unnatural results.
4 Change Speed to 50%, and click OK.
Play the clip in the Timeline. Render the clip by pressing Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS) to see smooth playback. Notice that the clip is now 12 seconds 
long. This is because you slowed the clip to 50 percent, making it twice its 
original length.
5 Choose Edit > Undo or press Control+Z (Windows) or Command+Z (Mac OS).
6 With the clip selected, press Control+R (Windows) or Command+R (Mac OS) to 
open the Clip Speed/Duration dialog.

176 
lesson 8 
Advanced editing techniques
7 Click the link icon, which indicates that Speed  
and Duration are linked, so that the icon shows 
the settings unlinked (shown here). Then 
change Speed to 50%.
Notice that with Speed and Duration unlinked, 
the duration remains six seconds.
8 Click OK; then play the clip.
Notice that the clip plays at 50 percent speed, 
but the last six seconds have automatically been 
trimmed to keep the clip at its original duration.
Occasionally you will need to reverse time. You can do this in the same Clip 
Speed/Duration dialog.
9 Open the Clip Speed/Duration dialog.
10 Leave Speed at 50%, but this time also select the Reverse Speed option; then 
click OK.
11 Play the clip. Notice it plays in reverse at 50 percent slow motion.
Changing speed and duration with the rate stretch tool
Sometimes you’ll need to find a clip that’s just the right length to fill a gap in your 
Timeline. You might be able to find the perfect clip, one that’s exactly the right 
length, but most times you will find a clip you want to use that is just a little too 
short or a little too long. This is where the Rate Stretch tool comes in handy.
1 In the Project panel, load the sequence 03 Rate Stretch.
The situation in this exercise is fairly common. The Timeline is synchronized 
to music, and the clips contain the content you want, but the clips are just too 
short. You can guess and try to insert just the right Speed percentage in the Clip 
Speed/Duration dialog, or you can use the Rate Stretch tool to drag the clip to 
the needed length.
2 Select the Rate Stretch tool in the Tools panel.
P Note: The Clip 
Speed/Duration dialog 
shows a Maintain Audio 
Pitch option if the clip 
has audio. Selecting 
this option keeps 
audio at the original 
pitch regardless of 
the speed at which 
the clip is running. 
This can be helpful 
when making small 
speed adjustments to 
clips when you want 
to maintain pitch in 
the audio or keep a 
character’s voice at 
its normal pitch, even 
as it slows down or 
speeds up.
E Tip: Adobe Premiere 
Pro has the ability to 
change the speed of 
multiple clips at the 
same time. Simply 
select multiple clips and 
choose Clip > Speed/
Duration. When you 
change the speed of 
multiple clips, be sure 
to pay attention to the 
Ripple Edit, Shifting 
Trailing Clips option. 
This will automatically 
close or expand gaps to 
all of the selected clips 
after the speed change.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 177
3 Move the Rate Stretch tool  
over the right edge of the 
first clip, and drag it until 
it meets the second clip.
Notice that the speed of 
the first clip changes to 
fill the space into which 
you stretched it.
4 Move the Rate Stretch tool over the right edge of the second clip, and drag it 
until it meets the third clip.
5 Move the Rate Stretch tool over the right edge of the third clip, and drag it until 
it matches the end of the audio.
6 Play the Timeline to view the speed change made using the Rate Stretch tool.
Changing speed and duration with time remapping
Time remapping lets you vary the speed of a clip by using keyframes. This means one 
portion of the same clip could be in slow motion while another portion of the clip is 
in fast motion. In addition to giving you this flexibility, variable-speed time remap-
ping enables you to smoothly transition from one speed to another, whether from fast 
to slow or from forward motion to reverse motion. Hang on—this is really fun.
1 In the Project panel, load the sequence 04 Remapping.
The sequence has a single shot that you will modify. As you add time 
adjustments to the clip, it will change length.
2 Adjust the height of the Video 1 track by positioning the Selection tool over the 
split between audio and video tracks. Drag down to make more room to see the 
video tracks.
Increasing the track height makes adjusting keyframes on the clip right in the 
Timeline panel much easier.
E Tip: If you change 
your mind about the 
Rate Stretch tool, you 
can always use it to 
stretch a clip back. 
Alternatively, you can 
use the Speed/Duration 
command and enter 
a Speed of 100% to 
restore natural motion.

178 
lesson 8 
Advanced editing techniques
3 Right-click the clip, and choose Show Clip Keyframes > Time Remapping > 
Speed in the clip’s menu.
With this option selected, the yellow line across the clip represents the speed.
4 Drag the playhead on the Timeline to the point where the villain turns and 
starts walking across the room (about 00:00:01:00).
5 Press and hold the Control (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key.
The pointer changes to a small cross.
6 Click the yellow line to create the keyframe that will be visible at the top of 
the clip.
You are not yet changing the speed; you’re just adding control keyframes.
7 Using the same technique, add another speed keyframe at about 00:00:06:00, 
just as the villain points to the wall.
Notice that by adding two speed keyframes, the clip has been divided into three 
“speed sections.” You will now set different speeds between keyframes.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 179
8 Leave the first section, between the beginning of the clip and the first keyframe, 
set as is (the Speed setting is 100%).
9 Position the Selection tool over the yellow line between the first and second 
keyframes, and drag it down to approximately 30%.
Notice the clip has stretched in length to accommodate the speed change in this 
section.
10 Choose Sequence > Render Effects in Work Area to render the clip for the 
smoothest playback.
11 Play the clip. Notice the speed changes from 100 percent to 30 percent and back 
to 100 percent at the end.
Setting variable speed changes on a clip can be a very dramatic effect. In the 
previous section, you changed from one speed to another instantly. To create a 
more subtle speed change, it is possible to transition from one speed to another 
smoothly by using speed keyframe transitions.
12 Drag the right half of the first speed keyframe to the right to create a speed 
transition.
Notice the yellow line now ramps down, rather than making a sudden change 
from 100 percent to 30 percent.
P Note: If you have 
problems setting the 
speed keyframes, open 
the 04 Remapping 
Complete sequence 
to see the completed 
process.
P Note: You may 
need to adjust the 
height of the Video 1 
track by positioning 
the Selection tool 
over the Video 1 label 
and dragging the 
edge of the track up. 
This gives you more 
visible controls for the 
keyframes.

180 
lesson 8 
Advanced editing techniques
13 Drag the left half of the second speed keyframe to create a transition there 
as well.
14 Render and play the clip to see the effect.
P Note: To remove a time-remapping effect, you’ll need to select the clip and then view the 
Effect Controls panel. Click the disclosure triangle next to Time Remapping effect to open it. Click 
the “Toggle animation” button (stopwatch) next to the word Speed. This sets it to the off position. 
A warning dialog opens. Click OK to entirely remove the effect.
recognizing the downstream 
effects of changing time
You may decide to change the speed at the beginning of the Timeline after 
assembling many clips in your project. It’s important to understand how chang-
ing the speed of a clip affects the rest of the clips “downstream.”
Several issues could be caused by speed changes:
•
Unwanted gaps caused by clips growing shorter because of increased 
playback speed
•
Unwanted duration changes to the overall sequence because of the 
Ripple Edit option
•
Potential audio problems created by changes in speed
When making speed or duration changes, always be careful to view the overall 
impact on the total sequence. You may want the zoom level of the Timeline panel 
to view the entire sequence or segment at once. Another option is to edit the clip 
into a new sequence and adjust it there. You can then copy and paste the clip to 
return it to the original sequence.
replacing clips and footage
During the editing process, you’ll frequently want to swap one clip for another. 
It might be a global replacement, such as replacing one version of an animated 
logo with a newer file. You may also want to swap out one clip in your Timeline 
for another in a bin. Depending on the task at hand, you can use a few methods to 
swap shots or media.
Dragging in a replacement clip
One method for replacing a clip is to simply drag the new shot onto the existing 
footage you’d like to replace. Let’s start with the Replace Clip feature.
1 In the Project panel, load the sequence 05 Replace Clip.
E Tip: You can drag 
the blue Bezier handles 
to improve the ramping 
to further smooth out 
the transition.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 181
2 Play back the Timeline.
Notice that the same clip is played twice as a picture-in-picture (PIP). The clip 
has some motion effects that cause it to spin onto the screen and then spin off. 
You will learn how to create these effects in the next lesson.
You want to replace the first PIP clip (bike low shot.mov) in the Video 2 
track with a new clip called multicam_03.mov. But you don’t want to have 
to re-create all the effects and timing. This is a great scenario for using the 
Replace Clip feature.
3 In the bin Clips to Load, locate the multicam_03.mov clip, and drag it on top of 
the first bike low shot.mov clip.
Don’t drop it yet. Notice that it is longer than the clip on the Timeline.
4 Press Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS).
Notice that the replacement clip now becomes the exact length of the clip it is 
replacing. Release the mouse button to complete the Replace Clip function.
5 Play the Timeline. Notice the first PIP clip has the same effects but is using the 
new footage. The second PIP clip remains unchanged.
making a replace edit
If you’d like to have more control over how a replacement occurs, you can use the 
Replace Edit command. This allows you to precisely choose where to sample from 
the replacement clip.
1 In the Project panel, load the sequence 06 Replace Edit.
This sequence is a show bumper. One of the shots is a little boring, so you’ll 
swap it out. However, in this case, you’ll take more control over which part of 
the shot is used when replacing the clip. This process is called a replace edit.
2 Place the playhead in the sequence at approximately 00;00;05;00 to provide a 
sync point for the edit.
E Tip: If you want to 
adjust what portion of 
the clip is used for the 
first PIP, you could use 
the Slip tool to slide its 
contents. You’ll learn 
how to use this tool 
later in the lesson.

3 Click the clip multicam_01.mov in the Timeline to target it for replacement.
4 From the Clips to Load bin, load the replacement clip called bike rides into 
frame.mov into the Source Monitor panel.
5 Drag the playhead to choose a good piece of action for the replacement.
Use some of the more active bike-riding shots at approximately 00;00;02;25.
6 Make sure the Timeline panel is active, and then choose Clip > Replace With 
Clip > From Source Monitor, Match Frame.
The clip is replaced.

7 Watch the newly edited sequence to check the edit.
You should see that the frames positioned on the playhead in both the Source 
and Program Monitor panels were synchronized, determining which part of 
the replacement clip was used for the replace edit, while the original clip length 
served to set the duration.
using the replace footage feature
The Replace Footage feature in Adobe Premiere Pro replaces footage in the Project 
panel. This can be a huge benefit when you need to replace a clip that occurs sev-
eral times in a sequence or multiple sequences. When you use Replace Footage, all 
instances of the clip you replace are changed anywhere the original clip was used in 
any sequence in the project.
1 In the Project panel, load the sequence 07 Replace Footage.
2 Watch the sequence play back carefully.
In this case, let’s replace a graphic that contains a date error. There is no reason 
to keep the previous graphic. In fact, removing it from the project can prevent 
accidentally using it and making an embarrassing or costly mistake.
3 In the Clips to Load bin, select the clip Graphic.tif in the Project panel.

throughout the sequence and project.
P Note: The Replace 
Footage command 
cannot be undone. 
If you want to switch 
back to the original 
clip, choose Clip > 
Replace Footage again 
to navigate and relink to 
the original file.

nesting sequences
A nested sequence is a sequence within another sequence. You can break up 
your project into more manageable chunks by creating a project segment in one 
sequence and dragging that sequence—with all its clips, graphics, layers, multiple 
audio/video tracks, and effects—into another sequence. There it will look and 
behave like a single audio/video clip.
Nested sequences have many potential uses:
• They simplify editing by creating complex sequences separately. This helps you 
avoid running into conflicts and inadvertently shifting clips on a track that is far 
from your current Work Area.
• They allow you to apply a motion effect to a group of clips (you’ll learn more in 
the next lesson).
• They let you reuse sequences as a source in multiple sequences.
• They organize your work in the same way you might create subfolders in the 
Project panel.
• They allow you to transition to a composited group of clips as a single item.
adding a nested sequence
One reason to use a nest is to reuse an already edited sequence. In this case, let’s 
add an edited opening title into an already edited sequence.
1 In the Project panel, load the sequence 08 Bike Race.
This sequence contains an edited bike race that was cut using multicamera 
editing techniques that you’ll learn in Lesson 10.
2 Set an In point at the start of the sequence.
3 Make sure that track V1 is targeted in the sequence loaded in the Timeline 
panel.
4 In the Project panel, locate the sequence 08A Race Open.
5 Click the sequence once to select it (do not open it).
6 Drag the sequence 08A Race Open over the Program Monitor.
A tool tip appears prompting you to choose the type of edit you want to make.
E Tip: A quick way 
to create a nested 
sequence is to drag 
a sequence from the 
Project panel into the 
appropriate track or 
tracks of the active 
sequence. You can also 
load a sequence as a 
source in the Program 
Monitor and use the 
standard Insert and 
Overwrite commands.

7 Hold down the Control (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key.
8 Release the key to perform an insert edit and add the graphic open to your 
sequence.
9 Play back sequence 08 Bike Race.
You’ll notice that the 08A Race Open sequence is added as a single clip, even 
though it uses multiple video tracks and audio clips within.
P Note: You cannot 
nest a sequence within 
itself. Rather, you’ll be 
prompted to give the 
nested portion a new 
name.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 187
nesting clips already in a sequence
In the previous exercise, you nested an entire sequence in another sequence. It’s 
also possible to select a group of clips already in a sequence and nest them into a 
new sequence that takes their place in the Timeline. It does not have to be all the 
clips in the sequence. This can be useful for collapsing a complex set of clips into a 
single nested sequence.
1 In the Project panel, load the sequence 09 Collapse.
Let’s create a Cube Spin transition at the edit point of the Medieval_wide_01 
and Medieval_villain_02 clips. Since there are two other clips composited over 
the Medieval_wide_01 clip, inserting a Cube Spin transition that correctly 
impacts the first three clips is difficult—but not if you collapse the first segment 
to a single nested clip.
2 Shift+click the three clips that make up the first segment—movie_logo.psd, 
Title 01, and Medieval_wide_01—to select them.
3 Right-click the selected clips, and choose Nest.
The three clips are collapsed to a single nested clip. Play the clip to see that the 
nest contains the three clips.
4 In the Effects panel, click the Video Transitions folder to open it. Then open the 
3D Motion subfolder.
5 Drag the Cube Spin transition to the edit point between the two clips.
6 Play back the sequence to see the impact of your work.
If necessary, render the Work Area for smoother playback.
E Tip: If you need 
to make a change to 
a nested sequence, 
simply double-click a 
nested sequence clip to 
open the sequence.

lesson 8 
Advanced editing techniques
regular trimming
You can adjust the length of a clip in several ways. This process is generally called 
trimming. When you trim, you can make an edit either shorter or longer. Some 
trimming types affect only a single clip, while others adjust the relationship 
between two adjacent clips.
trim in source monitor
The easiest way to trim a clip is to use the Source Monitor. If you take a clip that 
is in your sequence and load it into the Source Monitor from a sequence, you can 
easily adjust its In and Out points. With a clip loaded into the Source Monitor from 
a sequence, you can trim a clip in two basic ways:
• Marking new In and Out points: If you want to trim a clip, you can simply 
update its In or Out point. Double-click a clip in the Timeline to load it. With 
the clip loaded, just press the I or O key for In or Out. Alternately, you can use 
the Mark In and Mark Out buttons at the bottom left of the Source Monitor. If 
the clip has media adjacent to it in the Timeline, you can only make the selected 
clip shorter. You will end up with gaps on the side after making a trim.
• Dragging In and Out points: Instead of marking new points for a loaded 
clip, you can change the In and Out points by dragging. Simply place your 
cursor over an In or Out point in the mini Timeline in the Source Monitor. The 
cursor changes into a red-and-black icon indicating that a ripple edit can be 
performed. You can drag left or right to change the In or Out point. The same 
limitations apply for adjacent media in regards to gaps or extending an edit. If 
you hold down the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, you can drag the 
video or audio only for the clip.
trim in a sequence
Another way that you can trim media is directly in the Timeline panel. As you edit 
a sequence, you’ll likely find shots that you’ll want to adjust. Making a single clip 
shorter or longer is fairly easy (and is called a regular trim).
1 In the Project panel, load the sequence 10 Regular Trim.
2 Play the sequence.
The second actor’s dialogue is cut off, and the shot needs to be extended.
3 Choose the Selection tool (V).
P Note: A regular 
trim is also referred 
to as a single-sided or 
overwrite trim in other 
editing applications.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 189
4 Place the pointer over the Out point of the last clip in the sequence.
The pointer changes into the Trim In tool (head side) or Trim Out tool (tail 
side) with directional arrows. Mousing over the edge of the clip changes it 
between trimming the Out point (open to the left) or In point (open to the 
right) of a clip.
5 Click and drag an edge to trim the Out point of the clip in the sequence.
A timecode tool tip appears to show you how much you’ve trimmed the clip. 
Drag an edge an additional 9:00.
6 Release the mouse to make the edit.
advanced trimming
The trimming methods you’ve learned so far have their limitations. They can leave 
unwanted gaps in the Timeline caused by shortening a clip. They also can prevent 
you from lengthening a shot if it is surrounded by an adjacent clip. Fortunately, 
Adobe Premiere Pro offers several more choices for trimming.
ripple edit
A way to avoid creating gaps when trimming is to use the Ripple Edit tool. It’s one 
of the many tools in the Tools panel. Use the Ripple Edit tool to trim a clip in the 
same way you used the Selection tool in Trim mode. The two differences are that 
the Ripple Edit tool does not leave a gap on the sequence and that the display in the 
Program Monitor gives a clearer representation of how the edit will work.
When you use the Ripple Edit tool to lengthen or shorten a clip, your action ripples 
through the sequence. That is, all clips after that edit slide to the left to fill the gap 
or slide to the right to accommodate a longer clip.
P Note: If you make 
a clip shorter, it will 
leave a gap between 
the adjacent clips. You’ll 
learn to use the Ripple 
Edit tool later in this 
lesson to automatically 
remove any gaps or 
move later clips to avoid 
overwriting them.

lesson 8 
Advanced editing techniques
In this figure, the green clip is shortened by two seconds. A ripple edit changes the overall length of 
the project.
1 In the Project panel, load the sequence 11 Ripple Edit.
2 Click the Ripple Edit tool (or press B on your keyboard).
3 Hover the Ripple Edit tool over  
the left edge of the third clip 
(Medieval_wide_01.mpeg) until 
it turns into a large, right-facing 
square bracket.
There is too much of the 
cutaway. Let’s remove some.
4 Drag to the right until the  
timecode reads +00:00:02:15.
Notice that when you’re 
using the Ripple Edit tool, the 
Program Monitor displays the 
last frame of the first clip on the 
left and the first frame of the 
second clip on the right. Watch 
the moving edit position on the left half of the Program Monitor.
5 Release the mouse button to complete the edit.
The remaining part of the clip moves left to fill the gap, and the clips to its right 
slide along with it. Play that portion of the sequence to see whether the edit 
works smoothly. Let’s continue to trim to make the clip exactly one second long.
6 Use the Ripple Edit tool to grab the right side of the clip, and drag it to the left 
until the timecode removed reads -00:00:03:00.
Notice how the clips to the right (downstream) ripple to close the gap when you 
release the mouse button.
P Note: When 
performing a ripple 
edit, you can knock 
items on other tracks 
out of sync. Be sure to 
pay attention to the use 
of sync locks for any 
sequence where you’re 
using a ripple edit.
E Tip: If you’re using 
the standard Selection 
tool, just hold down the 
Command (Mac OS) or 
Control (Windows) key 
to temporarily switch to 
the Ripple Edit tool.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 191
rolling edit
When you used the Ripple Edit tool, it made changes to the overall length of the 
project. This is because one clip got longer or shorter while the rest of the sequence 
adjusted to close the gap (or move out of the way). There is another way, though, to 
change the location of an edit.
With a rolling edit, the overall length of the project does not change. Instead, a roll-
ing edit takes place at an edit point between two clips, shortening one and length-
ening the other proportionately. It edits two adjacent clips at the same time. A roll 
edit trims adjacent In and Out points and simultaneously adjusts them by the same 
number of frames.
A rolling edit is applied between the first and second shots. The outgoing shot is shortened by two 
seconds while the incoming shot is lengthened by two seconds. No change to the overall duration 
of the sequence occurs.
1 In the Project panel, load the sequence 12 Trimming Edits.
Three clips already appear on the Timeline, with enough head and tail frames to 
allow the edits you’re about to make.
2 Select the Rolling Edit Tool (N) in the Tools panel.
P Note: A ripple 
trim is also referred 
to as a double roller 
trim in other editing 
applications.

192 
lesson 8 
Advanced editing techniques
3 Drag the edit point between Clip A and Clip B (the  
first two clips on the Timeline), using the Program 
Monitor split screen to find a better matching edit.
Try rolling the edit point to the right to 00;20 (20 
frames). You can use the Program Monitor timecode 
or the pop-up timecode in the Timeline (both 
shown here) to find that edit.
sliding edits
The slide edit is a special kind of trim. It is not used often but can be a timesaving 
edit. The Slide Edit tool works by leaving the duration of the clip you’re sliding the 
same. What changes is that the Out point of the clip to the left and the In point 
of the clip to the right are modified an equal number of frames. Essentially you 
slide the clip forward or back in the Timeline and change the content of the shots 
adjacent to it. The clip’s In and Out points remain unchanged. The length of the 
sequence does not change.
A slide edit changes the In and Out points of adjacent clips while retaining the original clip’s edit 
points. The middle shot does not change duration or which frames are displayed, but it does move 
earlier or later in the sequence.
1
Continue working with the sequence 12 Trimming Edits.
2
Select the Slide Tool (U).
3
Position the Slide tool over the middle clip.
4
Drag the second clip left or right.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 193
5 Take a look at the Program Monitor as you perform the slide edit.
The two top images are the In point and Out point of Clip B. They do not 
change. The two larger images are the Out point and In point of the adjacent 
clips—Clip A and Clip C, respectively. These edit points change as you slide the 
selected clip over those adjacent clips.
Clip A Out point
Clip B In point (unchanged)
Clip C In point
Clip B Out point (unchanged)
The Slide tool moves a clip over two adjacent clips.

194 
lesson 8 
Advanced editing techniques
slip edits
The slip edit is a bit hard to grasp, but think of it this way: slipping in place. When 
you slip an edit, you change what portion of the shot is seen. A slip edit changes a 
clip’s In and Out points forward or backward by the same number of frames. Using 
the Slip tool lets you change a clip’s starting and ending frames without changing 
its duration or affecting adjacent clips. This changes what part of the shot is visible. 
The length of the sequence does not change.
A slip edit changes the In and Out points of the selected clip while retaining the adjacent clip’s edit 
points. The frames displayed for the clip are changed.
1 Continue working with the sequence 12 Trimming Edits.
2 Select the Slip tool (Y).
3 Drag Clip B left and right (the middle clip—bike low shot.mov).

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 195
4 Take a look at the Program Monitor as you perform the slip edit.
The two top images are the Out point and In point of Clips A and C, respec-
tively. They do not change. The two larger images are the In point and Out point 
of Clip B. These edit points change as you slip Clip B under Clips A and C.
Clip B In point
Clip A Out point (unchanged)
Clip B Out point
Clip C In point (unchanged)
The Slip tool moves a clip under two adjacent clips.

lesson 8 
Advanced editing techniques
trimming in the Program monitor panel
If you’d like to trim with a great deal of visual feedback, then you should use the 
Trim mode of the Program Monitor panel. This approach allows you to see both 
the outgoing and incoming frames of the trim you’re working on.
You can perform three types of trims in the Program Monitor panel. You learned 
about each of these earlier in this lesson:
• Regular trim: This basic type of trim moves the edge of the selected clip. This 
type of trim trims only one side of the edit point. It moves the selected edit 
point either forward or backward in the Timeline, but it doesn’t shift any of the 
other clips.
• Roll trim: The roll trim will move the tail of one clip and the head of the 
adjacent clip. It lets you shift an edit point (provided there are handles). There 
is no gap created, and the sequence duration doesn’t change.
• Ripple trim: If you need to extend or shorten just one side of an edit, use a 
ripple trim. This will move the selected edge of the edit point either forward 
or backward in time. The clips that follow the edit point will shift.
P Note: You’ll still find the Trim Monitor panel that shipped with earlier versions of Adobe 
Premiere Pro (Window > Trim Monitor). This is a legacy feature that doesn’t utilize the ability to 
precisely select edits. This feature has been replaced by the new Trim mode, which is available 
in the Program Monitor.
using trim mode in the Program monitor
When using Trim mode, the Program Monitor switches some of its buttons and 
controls to improve your ability for several trimming functions. To use the Trim 
mode, you first need to activate it. This is done by selecting an edit point between 
two clips. There are three ways to do this:
• With a selection or trimming tool, double-click an edit point in your Timeline.
• Press the T key to move to the closest edit point and open it in Trim mode in 
the Program Monitor panel.
• Using the Ripple or Roll tool, you can click and drag to create a marquee 
selection. Drag around one or more edit points to select them and open the 
Program Monitor to Trim mode.
When invoked, Trim mode shows you two video clips. The first box shows the 
outgoing clip (also called A side). The second display shows the incoming clip (also 
called B side) frames. Below the frames are five buttons and two indicators.

A Out Shift counter: Shows how many frames the Out point for the A side has 
changed.
B Trim Backward Many: When clicked, this will perform the selected trim and 
move it multiple frames to the left. The number moved depends on the Large 
Trim Offset option specified on the Trim Preferences tab of Preferences. The 
keyboard shortcut is Alt+Shift+left arrow (Windows) or Option+Shift+left 
arrow (Mac OS).
C Trim Backward: This performs the selected trim type one frame at a time and 
moves it to the left. The keyboard shortcut is Alt+left arrow (Windows) or 
Option+left arrow (Mac OS).
D Apply Default Transitions to Selection: This applies the default transition 
(generally a dissolve) to the video and audio tracks that have their edit points 
selected.
E Trim Forward: This is just like Trim Backward except it moves the selected 
edit point forward (to the right). The keyboard shortcut is Alt+right arrow 
(Windows) or Option+right arrow (Mac OS).
F Trim Forward Many: This closely matches Trim Backward Many except it 
moves multiple frames forward. The keyboard shortcut is Alt+Shift+right arrow 
(Windows) or Option+Shift+right arrow (Mac OS).
G In Shift counter: This shows how many frames the In point for the B side has 
changed.

Advanced editing techniques
Choosing a trimming method in the Program monitor
You’ve already learned about the three types of trims that you can perform (regular, 
roll, and ripple). You also tried each in the Timeline panel. Using Trim mode makes 
the process easier for most because it provides richer visual feedback.
1 In the Project panel, load the sequence 13 Trim Mode.
2 With the Selection tool, double-click the edit point between clip 3 and clip 4 in 
the Timeline panel (there is a marker to help you find it).
3 In the Program monitor, drag the cursor slowly across the A and B clips.
As you drag from left to right, you’ll see the tool update from a Trim Out (left 
side), Roll (center), or Trim In (right).
4 Drag in between both clips to perform a roll edit.
The time display on the right should read 00:00:09:16.
5 Press the down-arrow key to go to the next edit.
P Note: Clicking the 
A or B side will switch 
which side is being 
trimmed. Clicking in 
the center will switch 
to a roll.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 199
6 Change your trimming method to a ripple edit.
The easiest way to change the trimming method is to press the shortcut 
Control+T (Windows) or Command+T (Mac OS) to cycle Trim modes. There 
are five options to cycle through. Tap the key combo once to cycle to the next 
shortcut. The five choices loop. You’ve selected a ripple edit when the Trim tool 
shows a yellow roller.
7 Drag four frames to the right for the incoming clip and make the edit shorter.
The time display should read 00:00:21:05. The rest of the clips ripple to close the 
gap. The shots are now back in sync.
P Note: The type of trim that’s used by default may seem random, but it’s not. The initial setting is 
chosen by the type of tool that was used to select the edit point. If you click with the Selection tool, 
Adobe Premiere Pro chooses a regular Trim In or Trim Out. If you click with the Ripple tool, then the 
Ripple In or Ripple Out tool is chosen. In both cases, cycling the roller will result in a rolling trim. Use 
the horizontal blue highlight to determine what type of trim is in use.
E Tip: You can also 
right-click an edit point 
to choose the trim type 
from a pop-up menu.

Lesson 8 
Advanced editing Techniques
Modifier keys
There are multiple modifier keys that can be used to refine a trimming selection.
•
Hold down Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) when clicking to temporarily 
unlink audio and video. This makes it easier to select just the audio or video 
portion of a clip.
•
Hold down the Shift key to select multiple edit points. You can trim multiple 
tracks or even multiple clips at the same time.
•
Combine the two shortcuts to make very advanced selections for trimming.
Dynamic trimming
Because trimming often involves finding the proper rhythm for an edit, it’s easier 
to accomplish while the sequence is playing back live. Adobe Premiere Pro lets you 
update a trim using keyboard shortcuts or buttons while the sequence plays back in 
real time.
1 Continue working with the sequence 13 Trim Mode.
2 Press the Down Arrow key twice to move to the next video edit point. Set 
the trim type to be a roll. You can use the shortcut Control+T (Windows) or 
Control+T (Mac) to cycle Trim modes.
You can stay in Trim mode while switching between edit points. Conversely, the 
Up Arrow key would switch you to the previous edit.
3 Press the spacebar to loop playback.
The sequence starts to play back. You’ll see a few seconds loop with the shot 
before and after playing back. This helps you get a feel for the content of the edit.
P Note: To control the preroll and postroll times, open Preferences and select the Playback 
category. You can set the duration in seconds. Most editors find a duration of two to five seconds 
most useful.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 201
4 Try adjusting the trim using the methods you’ve already learned.
The Trim Forward and Backward buttons at the bottom of Trim mode view 
work well and can adjust the edit while the clip plays back. While these work 
well, let’s try using the keyboard for more dynamic control. The same J-K-L 
playback keys you use to control playback can also control trimming.
5 Press Stop to stop the playback loop.
6 Press the L key to shuttle the trim to the right.
Pressing once trims in real time. You can tap it multiple times to trim faster.
7 Press the K key to stop trimming.
Let’s refine and trim back a little earlier.
8 Hold down the K key and press the J key to shuttle left in slow motion.
9 Release both keys to stop the trim.
10 To exit Trim mode, click a button in the transport control area (play/rewind 
buttons) of the Program Monitor or scrub in the Timeline panel.
P Note: To review the 
shortcut, press the J key 
to activate Shuttle Left 
(moving the trim point 
earlier). Press the L key 
to activate Shuttle Right 
(a later point). To stop 
the dynamic trim, press 
K to activate Shuttle

review questions
1 Changing the Speed parameter of a clip to 50% has what effect on the length of 
the clip?
2 What tool is useful in stretching a clip in time to fill a gap?
3 Can you make time-remapping changes directly on the Timeline?
4 How do you create a smooth ramp-up from slow motion to normal speed?
5 What’s the basic difference between a slide edit and a slip edit?
6 What is the difference between the Replace Clip feature and the Replace Footage 
feature?
review answers
1 Reducing a clip’s speed causes the clip to become longer, unless the Speed and 
Duration parameters have been unlinked in the Clip Speed/Duration dialog or the 
clip is bound by another clip.
2 The Rate Stretch tool is useful for the common situation of needing to fill a small 
amount of time.
3 Time remapping is best done on the Timeline; because it affects time, it is best (and 
most easily) used and seen within the Timeline sequence.
4 Add a speed keyframe, and split it by dragging away half of the keyframe to create 
a transition between speeds.
5 You slide a clip over adjacent clips, retaining the selected clip’s original In and Out 
points. You slip a clip under adjacent clips, changing the selected clip’s In and Out 
points.
6 Replace Clip replaces a single targeted clip on the Timeline with a new clip from the 
Project panel. Replace Footage replaces a clip in the Project panel with a new source 
clip. Any instance of the clip in any sequence in the project is replaced. In both cases, 
the effects of the replaced clip are maintained.

The Motion fixed effect adds motion to an entire clip. 
This can be useful for animating a graphic or for sizing 
and repositioning a video clip within the frame. You 
can also animate an object’s position using keyframes 
and enhance that animation by controlling their 
interpolation between values.

A common visual treatment you’ll see in frequent use is to put elements into 
motion. Perhaps you’ll see multiple video clips streaming past on-screen in floating 
boxes, or you’ll see a video clip shrunk down and placed next to an on-camera host. 
You can create those effects (and more) in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 by using the 
Motion fixed effect or several clip-based effects with Motion settings.
You use the Motion effect to position, rotate, or scale a clip within the video frame. 
You can make those adjustments directly in the Program Monitor by dragging to 
change its position, or you can drag or rotate its handles to change its size, shape, 
or orientation.
You can also adjust Motion parameters in the Effect Controls panel and animate 
clips by using keyframes and Bezier controls. Keyframes simply define where an 
object is at a particular point in time. If you use two (or more) keyframes, then it’s 
possible to introduce animation between the frames.
adjusting the motion effect
Every time you add a clip into an Adobe Premiere Pro Timeline, the Motion effect 
is automatically applied as a fixed effect. To control the effect, you’ll use the Effect 
Controls panel. Within you’ll find the Motion effect properties (just click the tri-
angle next to the Motion effect name).
With the Motion effect you can adjust the position, scale, or rotation of a clip. This 
opens up several possibilities for adjusting the frames on-screen. Let’s explore how 
this effect has been used to reposition a clip.
1 Open Lesson-09.prproj in the Lesson 09 folder.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Effects to switch to the Effects workspace.
3 Locate the sequence 01 Floating. It should already be loaded; if not, double-click 
to load the sequence.
Let’s ensure the Program Monitor is sized so you can see all of the action.
4 Open the Select Zoom Level menu in the Program  
Monitor, and make sure the zoom level is set to Fit.
This helps you see and work with the Motion 
effect’s bounding box.
5 Play the clip in the Timeline.
This particular clip has had its Position, Scale, and 
Rotation properties modified. Keyframes have 
been used as well as interpolation.

understanding motion settings
While the Motion effect is automatically applied, a clip does not animate by default. 
Rather, it will appear at 100 percent of its original size in the center of the Program 
Monitor. You can choose, however, to adjust the following properties:
• Position: This sets where the clip is positioned along the x- and y-axes (based 
on its anchor point). Coordinates are calculated based on pixel position from 
the upper-left corner.
• Scale (Scale Height, when Uniform Scale is deselected): Clips are set to 
their full size by default (100 percent). To shrink a clip, reduce the number to 0 
percent. While you can scale up to 600 percent in size, the image will become 
pixelated and soft.
• Scale Width: You must deselect Uniform Scale to make Scale Width available. 
Doing so lets you change the clip’s width and height independently.
• Rotation: You can rotate an image along the z-axis. This produces a flat-spin (as 
if viewing a spinning turntable or carousel from above). You can input degrees 
or number of rotations—for example, 450° or 1 x 90. A positive number denotes 
clockwise rotation, and a negative number represents counterclockwise. The 
maximum number of rotations allowed in either direction is 90, meaning you 
can apply up to 180 full rotations to a clip by using the full range between the 
maximum negative and positive rotations.
• Anchor Point: By default, this is the center of a clip. This can be changed, 
however, to define any point around which an object is set to scale or rotate. 

208 
lesson 9 
Putting Clips in motion
You can set the clip to rotate around any point on the screen, including one of 
the clip’s corners, or around a point outside the clip like a ball at the end of a 
rope. As you move the anchor point, you may have to reposition your clip to 
compensate for the offset.
• Anti-flicker Filter: This feature is useful for images that contain high-frequency 
detail, such as fine lines, hard edges, parallel lines (moiré problems), or rotation. 
Those characteristics can cause flickering during motion. The default setting 
(0.00) adds no blurring and has no effect on flicker. To add some blurring and 
eliminate flicker, use 1.00.
Let’s look closer at the animated clip.
1 Continue using the sequence 01 Floating.
2 Click the only clip in the Timeline to make sure it is selected.
3 In the same frame with the Source Monitor, look for the tab for the Effect 
Controls panel and click it so it is visible.
4 Click the Motion disclosure triangle in the Effect Controls panel to display its 
parameters.
5 Click the Show/Hide Timeline View button to show or hide the keyframes in use.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 209
6 Click the Go to Previous Keyframe or Go to Next Keyframe arrow to jump 
between the existing keyframes applied to the clip.
Now that you know how to view an animation, let’s reset a clip. You’ll animate 
from scratch later in this lesson.
7 Click the “Toggle animation” stopwatch button for the Position property to turn 
off its keyframes.
8 Click OK when prompted that all keyframes will be deleted if you apply 
the action.
9 Repeat steps 7 and 8 for the Scale and Rotation properties.
10 Click the Reset button (to the right of Motion  
in the Effect Controls panel).
These actions return Motion to its default 
settings.
examining motion properties
The Position, Scale, and Rotation properties are spatial in nature, meaning that any 
changes you make are easily visible, because the object will change in size and posi-
tion. These properties can be adjusted by entering numerical values, scrubbable 
text, or using the Transform controls.
To examine some Motion settings, follow these steps:
1 Double-click the sequence 02 Motion in the Project panel to load it.
2 Open the Select Zoom Level menu in the Program Monitor, and make sure the 
zoom level is set to 25% (or a zoom amount that allows you to see space around 
the frame).
This will make it easier to see the bounding box as you drag a clip around.
3 Drag the playhead anywhere in the clip so you can see the video in the Program 
Monitor.
P Note: It is very 
difficult to select a 
keyframe precisely with 
the mouse. Using the 
previous/next keyframe 
buttons helps prevent 
adding unwanted 
keyframes.

lesson 9 
Putting Clips in motion
4 Click the clip in the Timeline so it is selected and visible in the Effect Controls 
panel.
If necessary, click the triangle to open the Motion properties.
5 Click the Transform button (next to Motion) in the Effect Controls panel.
A bounding box with a crosshair and handles appears around the clip in the 
Program panel.
6 Click anywhere in the clip bounding box in the Program Monitor and drag this 
clip around.
Note how the Position values in the Effect Controls panel change.
7 Drag the clip so that its center is directly over the upper-left corner of the 
screen, and note that the Position values in the Effect Controls panel are 0, 0 (or 
close to that, depending on where you placed the center of the clip).
P Note: The Transform 
button is available in 
several effects and 
can be used for direct 
manipulation. Be sure 
to explore Corner Pin, 
Crop, Garbage Matte, 
Mirror, Transform, and 
Twirl.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 211
The lower-right corner of the screen is 1280, 720—the frame size of the 720p 
sequence setting used for this project.
8 Click the Reset button to restore the clip to its default position.
9 Click and drag the golden text for the Rotation property. Drag left or right to 
rotate the object.
10 Click the Reset button to restore the clip to its default position.
P Note: Adobe Premiere Pro uses an upside-down x, y coordinate system for screen location. That 
coordinate system is based on a methodology used in Windows. The upper-left corner of the screen 
is 0, 0. All x and y values, respectively, to the left of and above that point are negative. All x and y 
values, respectively, to the right of and below that point are positive.
Changing clip position, size, and rotation
Simply sliding a clip around only begins to exploit the possibilities of the Motion 
effect. What makes the Motion effect so useful is the ability to shrink or expand the 
clip as well as rotate it. In this example, we’re going to build a simple bumper seg-
ment for the behind-the-scenes features of a DVD.
Changing Position
Let’s begin using keyframes to animate the position of a layer. For this exercise, the 
first thing we’ll do is adjust the clip position. The picture is going to start offscreen 
and move across from right to left.
1 Double-click the sequence 03 Montage in the Project panel to load it.
The sequence contains several tracks, some of which are currently disabled and 
will be used later in the lesson.
2 Move the playhead to the start of the sequence.
3 Open the Select Zoom Level menu in the Program Monitor, and make sure the 
zoom level is set to Fit.

212 
lesson 9 
Putting Clips in motion
4 Select the first video clip on track Video 3.
The clip’s controls load into the Effect Controls panel.
5 In the Effect Controls panel, click Position’s “Toggle animation” button to 
activate keyframing for the Position property.
6 Enter a value of −640 into the x-axis as a starting position.
The clip moves offscreen to the left.
7 Drag the playhead to the end of the clip (00:00:4:23). You can do this in the 
Timeline panel or Effect Controls panel.
8 Enter a new position value for the x-axis. Use 1920 to push the clip off the right 
edge of the screen.
9 Play back the sequence to see the clip move.
It should float from offscreen left to offscreen right. You will see a clip on a 
lower track pop up suddenly. You’ll animate this layer and others next.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 213
reusing motion settings
Because you’ve applied keyframes and effects to one clip, you can save time by 
reusing them on other shots. It is as easy as copying and pasting to reuse effects 
from one clip to one or more other clips. In this example, you can apply the same 
left-to-right floating animation to other clips in the project.
There are several methods for reusing effects. Let’s try one now.
1 In the Timeline panel, select the clip you just animated. It should be the first clip 
on Video 3.
2 Choose Edit > Copy.
The properties for the clip are now on your computer’s clipboard.
3 With the Selection tool (V), drag from right to left to activate the five other clips 
located on the Video 2 and Video 3 tracks.
4 Choose Edit > Paste Attributes to the effect and keyframes stored on your 
computer’s clipboard.
5 Play back your sequence to see your work so far.
P Note: As an 
alternative to selecting 
a clip in the Timeline, 
you can always select 
one or more effects 
in the Effect Controls 
panel. Just select the 
first effect you want to 
copy. Then hold down 
the Shift key and click to 
select multiple effects.

214 
lesson 9 
Putting Clips in motion
adding rotation and changing the anchor point
While moving items around the screen is useful, you can animate items even 
more by taking control of two different properties. The Rotation property revolves 
an item on the z-axis. By default it will rotate around the center of an object, its 
anchor point. You can, however, move this point to create new effects.
Now let’s add some rotation to the clip.
1 Turn on the visibility icon for Video 6, which contains a title called Behind 
the Scenes.
2 Move the playhead to the start of the title (00:00:01:13).
3 Select the title in the Timeline.
Its controls should appear in the Effect Controls panel.
4 Click the triangle next to the Motion property if its controls aren’t visible. Also 
click the Transform button to see the anchor point and bounding box controls.
Now, let’s adjust the Rotation property only to see its effect.
5 Enter a value of 90.0˚ into the Rotation field.
The title rotates in the center of the screen.
6 Choose Edit > Undo so the animation can be refined.
7 Using the scrubbable text, adjust the anchor point so the crosshair sits on top of 
the letter B in the first word.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 215
The text will also appear to move on the screen. Values of approximately 155.0 
and 170.0 should work well.
8 In the Program Monitor, click the title and drag it into the correct position 
to center it on-screen. You can use the bounding box as a guide to help you 
position the item.
Using the same values of 155.0 and 170.0 should center the object.
9 Click the stopwatch button for the Rotation property to toggle animation.
10 At the start of the clip, add a keyframe for 90.0˚.
11 Move the playhead forward to 6:00 and add a second keyframe.
12 Set the rotation to 0.0˚.
13 Play back the sequence to see your animation.

216 
lesson 9 
Putting Clips in motion
Changing size
You’ll find a few different methods for changing the size of items in an Adobe 
Premiere Pro sequence. The default is that any item added to your sequence comes 
in at 100 percent of its original size. However, you can choose to manually adjust 
the size or let Adobe Premiere Pro do it for you.
Here are the three methods to choose from:
• Use the Scale property of the Motion effect in the Effect Controls panel.
• Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) an item and choose Scale To 
Frame Size (if the clip is a different frame size than your sequence).
• Scale automatically with the global preference. Choose Edit > Preferences > 
General (Windows) or Premiere Pro > Preferences > General (Mac OS). You can 
then select the Default Scale To Frame Size option and click OK.
For maximum flexibility, use only the first method so you can scale as needed with-
out discarding quality. Let’s give it a try.
1 Select the Behind The Scenes clip in the Timeline and move the playhead to the 
start of the clip.
2 Click the stopwatch button for the Scale property to toggle animation.
3 Enter a value of 0% so the item starts very small.
4 Click the Go to Next Keyframe arrow for the Rotation property.
This will move the playhead accurately so you can synchronize the animation.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 217
5 Enter a value of 100% for the Scale property.
Adobe Premiere Pro automatically adds a new keyframe because the “Toggle 
animation” property is enabled.
6 Turn on the Video 4 track.
This is an adjustment layer for applying a global effect to all the footage. In this 
case, the Black and White effect is applied to remove the saturation from each 
shot. You’ll learn more about adjustment layers in Lesson 13, “Adding Video 
Effects.”
7 Turn on the Video 5 track.
This is a colored texture layer that is set to the Overlay blending mode. Blending 
modes let you mix the content of multiple layers together. You’ll learn more 
about modes in Lesson 15, “Exploring Compositing Techniques.”
8 Play back the sequence to see your animation.

lesson 9 
Putting Clips in motion
Working with keyframe interpolation
Throughout this lesson you’ve been using keyframes to define your animation. The 
term keyframe originates from traditional animation where the lead artist would 
draw the key frames (or major poses) and then assistant animators would animate 
the frames in between (a process often called tweening). When animating in Adobe 
Premiere Pro, you’re the master animator, and the computer does the rest of the 
work as it interpolates values in between the keyframes you set.
keyframe interpolation methods
While you’ve already used keyframes to animate, you’ve only touched on their 
power. One of the most useful yet least utilized features of keyframes is their 
interpolation method. This is just a fancy way of saying how to get from point A to 
point B. Think of it as describing the sharp ramp-up as a runner takes off from the 
starting line and the gradual slowdown after she’s crossed the finish line.
temporal vs. spatial interpolation
Some properties and effects offer a choice of temporal and spatial interpolation 
methods for transitioning between keyframes. You’ll find that all properties have 
temporal controls (which relate to time). Some properties also offer spatial interpo-
lation (which refers to space or movement). Here are the essentials of each method:
•
Temporal interpolation: Temporal interpolation deals with changes in time. 
It’s an effective way to determine the speed at which an object moves across 
a motion path. For example, you can add acceleration and deceleration to a 
motion path with Ease or Bezier keyframes.
•
Spatial interpolation: The spatial method commonly deals with changes in 
an object’s shape. It’s an effective way to control the shape of the motion path. 
For example, does an object create hard angular ricochets as it moves from 
keyframe to keyframe, or does the object have a more sloping movement with 
round corners?

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 219
Adobe Premiere Pro has five interpolation methods that control the interpolation 
process. Changing the method used can create a very different animation. You can 
easily access the available interpolation methods by right-clicking a keyframe. You 
can then see all five options listed (some effects offer both spatial and temporal 
categories).
Keyframes can be identified by their shape (from left to right): Linear,  
Bezier, Auto Bezier, Continuous Bezier, and Hold interpolation.
• Linear interpolation: The default method of keyframe interpolation is Linear. 
This method creates a uniform rate of change between keyframes. It often looks 
a bit mechanical because the software calculates in-between values or each 
keyframe pair while the other keyframes in use in the Timeline are ignored. 
When using linear keyframes, changes begin instantly at the first keyframe and 
continue to the next keyframe at a constant speed. At the second keyframe, the 
rate of change switches instantly to the rate between it and the third keyframe.
• Bezier interpolation: If you want the most control over keyframe interpolation, 
choose the Bezier interpolation method. This option provides manual controls 
so you can adjust the shape of the value graph or motion path segments on both 
sides of the keyframe. If you use Bezier interpolation for all keyframes in a layer, 
you’ll have a smooth transition between keyframes.
• Auto Bezier interpolation: The Auto Bezier option attempts to create a 
smooth rate of change through a keyframe and will automatically update as you 
change values. This option works best for spatial keyframes that define position 
but can be used for other values as well.
• Continuous Bezier interpolation: This option is similar to the Auto Bezier 
option, but it provides some manual controls. The motion or value path will 
have smooth transitions, but you can adjust the shape of the Bezier curve on 
both sides of the keyframe with a control handle.
• Hold interpolation: The Hold style is an additional interpolation method that 
is available only for temporal (time-based) properties. This style of keyframe 
allows a keyframe to hold its value across time without a gradual transition. 
This is useful if you want to create staccato-type movements or make an object 
suddenly disappear. When used, the value of the first keyframe will hold until 
the next hold keyframe is encountered, and then the value will instantly change.

lesson 9 
Putting Clips in motion
adding ease to motion
A quick way to add a feeling of inertia to clip motion is to use one of the Ease pre-
sets. For example, you can create a ramp-up effect for speed. By simply right-click-
ing a keyframe, you can choose the Ease In or Ease Out option. Ease In is used for 
approaching a keyframe, while Ease Out is used when leaving a keyframe position.
1 Continue working with the previous sequence or double-click to load 04 
Montage Complete in the Project panel.
2 Select the clip Behind The Scenes on track Video 6.
3 In the Effect Controls panel, locate the Rotation and Scale properties.
4 Click the disclosure triangle next to the Scale and Rotation properties to reveal 
the control handles and velocity graphs.
These make it easier to view the effects of keyframe interpolation. A straight 
line means essentially no change in speed or acceleration.
5 Right-click the first Scale keyframe and choose Ease Out since you are leaving 
the keyframe to begin the animation.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 221
6 Repeat for the Rotation property’s first keyframe. Use the Ease Out method.
7 Look closely at the velocity graphs and see the changes in ramping.
8 For the next two keyframes, right-click and choose the Ease In method for both 
Scale and Rotation.

222 
lesson 9 
Putting Clips in motion
9 Play back the sequence to see your animation.
10 Experiment by dragging the Bezier handles in the Effect Controls panel to see 
their effects on speed and ramping.
The steeper the curve you create, the sharper the animation’s movement or 
speed increases. After experimenting, you can choose Edit > Undo if you don’t 
like the changes.
using other motion-related effects
Adobe Premiere Pro offers a handful of other effects for controlling motion. While 
the Motion effect is the most intuitive, you may find yourself wanting to enhance 
the effect. In this case, the use of a beveled edge or a drop shadow may come in 
handy. Additionally, the Transform and Basic 3D effects are useful for more control 
over an object (including 3D rotation).
adding a drop shadow
A drop shadow creates perspective by adding a small shadow behind an object. 
This is often used to help create a sense of separation between elements. To add a 
drop shadow, follow these steps:
1 Continue working with the previous sequence or double-click to load 05 
Enhance in the Project panel.
2 Open the Select Zoom Level menu in the Program Monitor, and change the 
zoom level to Fit.
3 Select the Behind The Scenes clip on track Video 6.
E Tip: If you want to 
create inertia (such as 
a rocket lifting off), try 
using Ease. Right-click 
a keyframe, and choose 
Ease In or Ease Out 
(for approaching and 
leaving a keyframe, 
respectively).

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 223
4 In the Effects panel, choose Video Effects > Perspective to drag a Drop Shadow 
effect onto the top clip.
5 Click the triangle next to the Motion effect in the Effect Controls panel to make 
it easier to see the Drop Shadow options.
6 Experiment with the Drop Shadow parameters in the Effect Controls panel 
as follows:
•
Increase Distance to 15 so the shadow is further offset from the clip.
•
Drag the Direction value to about 320° to see the shadow’s angle change.
•
Darken the shadow by changing Opacity to 85%.
•
Set Softness to 25 to soften the edges of the shadow. Generally, the greater 
the Distance parameter, the more softness you should apply.
7 Play back the sequence to see your animation.
P Note: You want the 
shadow to fall away 
from any perceived 
light source. In this 
exercise, you set the 
light direction for bevel 
edges to about 320°. To 
make shadows fall away 
from a light source, 
add or subtract 180° 
from the light source 
direction to get the 
correct direction for the 
shadow to fall.

224 
lesson 9 
Putting Clips in motion
adding a bevel
Another way to enhance the edges of a clip is to add a bevel. This type of effect 
is useful on a picture-in-picture effect or on text. Adobe Premiere Pro offers two 
bevels to choose from. The Bevel Edges effect is useful when the object is simply a 
standard video clip. The Bevel Alpha works better for text or logos, because it will 
detect the complex transparent areas within before applying the beveled edge.
Let’s further enhance the type.
1 Continue working with the previous sequence 05 Enhance.
2 Select the Behind The Scenes clip on track Video 6.
3 Choose Video Effects > Perspective to drag a Bevel Alpha effect onto the top 
clip.
The edges of the text should appear slightly beveled.
4 Increase Edge Thickness to 10 to make the edge more pronounced.
5 Increase Light Intensity to 0.8 to see a brighter edge effect.
The effect is looking pretty useful but is currently applied to both the text and 
the drop shadow. This is because the effect is below the drop shadow in the 
Effect Controls panel (stacking order matters).
6 Drag the effect above the Drop Shadow effect to change the rendering order.
P Note: The Bevel 
Edges effect produces 
slightly harder edges 
than the Bevel Alpha 
effect. Both effects work 
well on rectangular 
clips, but the Bevel 
Alpha is better suited 
for text or logos.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 225
7 Reduce the Edge Thickness amount to 8.
8 Examine the subtle differences in the bevel.
9 Play back the sequence to see your animation.
transform
An alternative effect to the Motion operation is Transform. These two effects offer 
similar controls. There are three key differences between Transform and Motion. 
The Transform effect will process any changes to a clip’s Anchor Point, Position, 
Scale, or Opacity settings before other Standard effects are rendered. This means 
that things like drop shadows and bevels will behave differently. The Transform 
effect also adds the skew and skew axis properties to create a visual angular trans-
formation to clips. Lastly, the Transform effect is not a Mercury Engine acceler-
ated effect, so it will take longer to process and does not offer as much real-time 
performance.
Let’s compare the two effects by examining a prebuilt sequence.
1 In the Project panel, locate the sequence 06 Motion and Transform, and double-
click to load it.
P Note: When 
applying multiple 
effects to a clip, if you’re 
not getting the look 
you want, drag the 
order around and see 
whether that produces 
the desired result.

226 
lesson 9 
Putting Clips in motion
2 Play the sequence back and watch it a few times.
In both cases, a picture-in-picture is rotating twice over the background clip, 
while moving from left to right. Look carefully at the relationship of the shadow 
to each pair of clips.
•
In the clips on the left, the shadow follows the bottom edge of the PIP and 
therefore appears on all four sides of the clip as it rotates, which obviously 
isn’t realistic because the light source produces the shadow and it isn’t 
moving.
•
In the set on the right, the shadow stays on the lower right of the PIP, which 
is realistic.
3 Click the top clip of the set on the left, and view the effects applied in the Effect 
Controls panel: the Motion fixed effect and Drop Shadow effect.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 227
4 Now do the same for the pair on the right; you’ll see that the Transform effect 
is producing the motion, with the Drop Shadow effect again producing the 
shadow.
In the screen comparison shown here, you can see that the Transform effect 
has many of the same capabilities as the Motion fixed effect but also adds Skew, 
Skew Axis, and Shutter Angle. As you just saw, the Transform effect also works 
more realistically with the Drop Shadow effect than the Motion fixed effects.
5 Observe the render bar above both sets of clips. If you have a Mercury Engine–
compatible graphics card in your system, you’ll note that the render bar is 
yellow on the left and red on the right.
This tells you that the Motion effect is GPU-accelerated, which makes 
previewing and rendering more efficient, while the Transform effect isn’t.
Basic 3D
Another option for creating movement is the Basic 3D effect, which can be used 
to manipulate a clip in 3D space. Essentially, you can rotate the image around 
horizontal and vertical axes as well as move it toward or away from you. You’ll also 
find an option to enable a specular highlight, which creates the appearance of light 
reflecting off a rotated surface.
Let’s explore the effect by using a prebuilt sequence.
1 In the Project panel, locate the sequence 07 Basic 3D, and double-click to load it.
2 Drag the playhead over the sequence to quickly view the content.

228 
lesson 9 
Putting Clips in motion
The light that follows the motion, called a specular highlight, always comes from 
above, behind, and to the left of the viewer. Since the light comes from above, 
you won’t see the effect until the image is tilted backward to catch the reflection. 
Specular highlights can be used to enhance the realism of the 3D effect.
Four major properties are available to enhance the Basic 3D effect:
•
Swivel: This controls the rotation around the vertical y-axis. If you rotate 
past 90°, the back side of the image is rendered, which is a mirror image of 
the front.
•
Tilt: This controls the rotation around a horizontal x-axis. If you rotate 
beyond 90˚, the back side will also be visible.
•
Distance To Image: This moves the image along the z-axis and can simulate 
depth. As the distance value gets larger, the image moves further into the 
distance.
•
Specular Highlight: This adds a glint of light that reflects off the surface of 
the rotated image, as though an overhead light were shining on the surface. 
This option is either on or off.
3 Experiment with the available options for the effect and modify any of the 
keyframes to see the impact of change.
P Note: Not only does 
Basic 3D provide GPU 
acceleration, but it can 
also swivel and tilt in 
both directions.

review questions
1 Which Motion parameter will move a clip in the frame?
2 You want a clip to appear full-screen for a few seconds and then spin away. How do 
you make the Motion effect’s Rotation feature start within a clip rather than at the 
beginning?
3 How can you start an object rotating gradually and have it stop rotating slowly?
4 If you want to add a drop shadow to a clip, why do you need to use some other 
motion-related effect besides the Motion fixed effect?
review answers
1 The Motion parameter lets you set a new position for a clip. If keyframes are used, the 
effect can be animated.
2 Position the playhead where you want the rotation to begin, and click the Add/Remove 
Keyframe button. Then move to where you want the spinning to end, and change the 
Rotation parameter; another keyframe will appear.
3 Use the Ease Out and Ease In parameters to change the keyframe interpolation to be 
gradual rather than sudden.
4 The Motion fixed effect is the last effect applied to a clip. Motion takes whatever 
effects you apply before it (including Drop Shadow) and spins the entire assemblage 
as a single unit. To create a realistic drop shadow on a spinning object, use Transform 
or Basic 3D, and then place a Drop Shadow below one of those effects in the Effect 
Controls panel.

231
The process of multicamera editing begins with 
synchronizing multiple camera angles. You can do this 
using timecode or a common sync point (such as the 
closing of a clapboard or clapping of hands). Once 
your clips are synced, you can seamlessly cut between 
multiple angles in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6.

232 
lesson 10 
multicamera editing
Getting started
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to edit multiple angles of footage together that were 
shot simultaneously. Because the clips were shot at the same time, Adobe Premiere 
Pro CS6 makes it possible to cut seamlessly from one angle to another. The Adobe 
Premiere Pro multicamera editing feature is a tremendous timesaver when you’re 
editing footage from a shoot or event captured with multiple cameras.
For this lesson, you’ll use a new project that has already been started.
1 Start Adobe Premiere Pro, and open the project Lesson 10.prproj. If Adobe 
Premiere Pro can’t locate the lesson file, refer to “Relink the lesson files” in the 
Getting Started section at the start of this book for two ways to search for and 
relink the file.
This project has an empty sequence and four camera angles of a bike race.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Editing.
This changes the workspace to the preset that the Adobe Premiere Pro 
development team created to make it easier to edit footage.
3 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Current Workspace to make sure the 
user interface is configured to the default settings. Click Yes to apply the change.
Who uses multicamera editing?
The use of multicamera editing has grown immensely in popularity as prices for 
high-quality cameras have continued to fall. There are many potential uses for a 
multicamera shoot and edit.
•
Visual and special effects: Because of the expense associated with many 
special-effects shots, it is common practice to cover the shot with multiple 
angles. This means less cost associated with the staging of the shot and allows 
for greater flexibility during editing.
•
Action scenes: For scenes that involve a lot of action, producers often use 
multiple cameras. Doing so can reduce the number of times that stunts or 
dangerous action needs to be performed.
•
Once-in-a-lifetime events: Events such as weddings and sporting competitions 
rely heavily on multiple angles of coverage to ensure that the shooters capture 
all the critical elements of the event.
•
Musical and theatrical performances: If you’ve watched a concert film, you’re 
used to multiple camera angles being used to show the performance. The same 
style of editing can improve the pacing for theatrical performances as well.
•
Talk show formats: Interview-driven segments will often cut between the 
interviewer and subject as well as a wide shot to show both subjects at the same 
time. Not only does this maintain visual interest, but it makes it easier to edit an 
interview to a shorter run time.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 233
the multicamera process
The multicamera editing process has a very standardized workflow. It is essential 
that you follow the steps in order because of the complicated nature of the process. 
Once you have your footage loaded into Adobe Premiere Pro, there are really only 
six stages to complete.
1 Load your footage: To edit your footage, you need to load it into Adobe 
Premiere Pro. Ideally, the cameras will be closely matched in frame rate and 
frame size, but you can mix and match if needed.
2 Determine your sync points: The goal is to keep the multiple angles running 
in sync with each other so you can seamlessly switch between them. You will 
need to identify a point in time that exists in all angles to synchronize or use 
matching timecode.
3 Create a multicamera source sequence: The angles must be added to a 
specialized sequence type called a multicamera source sequence. This is 
essentially a specialized clip that contains multiple video angles.
4 Create the multicamera target sequence: The multicamera source sequence 
is added to a new sequence for editing. This new sequence is the multicamera 
target sequence.
5 Record the multicamera edits: A special panel, the Multi-Camera Monitor lets 
you switch between camera angles.
6 Adjust and refine edits: Once the edit is roughed out, you can refine the 
sequence with standard editing and trim commands.

234 
lesson 10 
multicamera editing
Creating a multicamera sequence
While Adobe Premiere Pro has supported multicamera editing for years, the 
feature got some big improvements in CS6. Previously, editors could use only four 
camera angles; Adobe has removed this limitation in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6. It 
is now possible to use many more angles; the only limiting factor is the computing 
power required to play back your selected clips. If your computer and hard drives 
are fast enough, then you should be able to play back several streams in real time.
Determining the sync points
To synchronize multiple angles of footage, you’ll need to determine how you want 
to build the multicamera sequence. You can select from four methods to use for the 
sync references. The method you choose is a matter of personal choice as well as 
how the footage was shot.
• Timecode: Many professional cameras allow the timecode to be synchronized 
across multiple cameras. This can be performed by connecting multiple 
cameras to a common sync source or by carefully configuring the cameras and 
syncing the recording process. In many cases, the Hours number is offset to 
identify the camera number. For example, camera 1 would start at 1:00:00:00, 
and camera 2 would start at 2:00:00:00. You can choose to ignore the Hours 
number when syncing with timecode.
• In points: If you have a common starting point, you can set an In point on all 
clips you want to use. This method is effective as long as all cameras are rolling 
before the critical action starts.
• Out points: This method is similar to syncing with an In point but instead uses 
a common Out point. Out-point syncing is ideal when all cameras capture the 
ending of critical action (such as crossing the finish line) but the cameras were 
started at different times.
• Clip markers: In and Out points can be accidentally removed from a clip. 
If you’d like to mark a clip in a more robust fashion, you can use a marker 
to identify a common sync point. Markers are more difficult to accidentally 
remove from a clip.
Say you have four clips that recorded the same bike race from four different camera 
angles, but the four cameras started recording at different times. Your first task is 
to find the same point in time for all four clips so they will be in sync.
1 In the Project panel, click the triangle next to the bin Multicam Media to open it.
2 Double-click the clip MULTICAM_01.mov to load it into the Source Monitor 
panel.
P Note: For this 
lesson, we’ll stick with 
four camera angles 
because of the limited 
space available on the 
book’s DVD-ROM and 
downloadable files.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 235
3 Move the Source Monitor playhead to where the first woman claps her hands 
together (about 00:00:01:03).
These clips do not have audio, so use the visual clap as a reference.
4 Right-click in the Source Monitor, and choose Add Marker.
This adds a little small marker at the Source Monitor playhead.
5 Repeat the process and add a marker for the remaining three clips in a similar 
manner.
You can also press the M key to add a marker or click the Add Marker button.
P Note: All four 
multicamera clips were 
recorded at the same 
time, so using the hand 
clap near the start of 
the clips is a good way 
to sync them all up. 
Because they are at 
four different angles, 
you might have to look 
closely at some clips 
to see the exact frame 
where the hands touch.

236 
lesson 10 
multicamera editing
add clips to a multicamera source sequence
Once you have identified the clips you want to use as well as their common sync 
points, you can create a multicamera source sequence. This is a specialized type of 
sequence that is designed for multicamera editing. If you’ve used earlier versions of 
Premiere Pro, the process has changed a great deal and is much easier to create.
1 Select all of the master clips in the Multicam Media bin.
E Tip: The clip you click first in the bin when selecting angles will become the audio track that is 
used for the multicamera source sequence (even when changing angles). Another approach is to 
just place a dedicated audio recording on another track and sync it. A third option, Audio Follows 
Video, can be chosen from the Multi-Camera Monitor submenu (upper-right corner of panel) to sync 
the audio changes to the video.
2 Right-click one of the clips to open the context menu and choose “Create multi-
camera source sequence.”
You can also choose Clip > Create multi-camera source sequence. A new dialog 
opens asking how you want to create the multicamera source sequence.
3 Choose the Clip Marker method.
Since there is only one marker in each clip, you can use the default choice, 
which is Unnamed Marker 1.
4 Name the sequence Synced  
Clips for Race.
5 Click OK.
Adobe Premiere Pro adds 
a new multicamera source 
sequence to the bin.
6 Double-click the multicamera 
source sequence to load it into 
the Source Monitor panel.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 237
7 Drag the playhead through the clip to view the multiple angles.
Some angles start in black because the cameras began recording at different 
times. The clips are displayed in a grid to show you all of the angles at once.
Create the multicamera target sequence
Once you’ve made the multicamera source sequence, you’ll need to place it into 
another sequence. Essentially it will behave like a clip in your sequence. However, 
this clip has multiple angles of footage to choose from as you edit.
There are two ways to create a sequence that is ready to edit. The first method is to 
right-click the multicamera source sequence and choose New Sequence from Clip. 
The second method is to autoconform an existing sequence.
1 Locate the sequence Multi-camera Edit.
It should already be open. If not, double-click to open it in the Timeline panel.
2 Drag the newly created multicamera source sequence onto the Timeline.
P Note: Adobe 
Premiere Pro auto-
matically adjusts the 
multicamera grid to 
accommodate the num-
ber of angles in use. For 
example, if you have up 
to 4 clips, you would see 
a 2x2 grid. If you used 
between 5 and 9 clips, 
you’d see a 3x3 grid; if 
you used 16 angles, the 
grid will be 4x4; and 
so on.

238 
lesson 10 
multicamera editing
A new dialog opens to warn you about the clip mismatching the sequence 
settings. This dialog opens by default when you drag the first clip into a new 
sequence and the two do not have a matching frame size or rate.
3 Click the “Change sequence  
settings” button to make 
the two items match.
You now have a ready-to-
use multicamera target 
sequence.
using track targeting
When dragging clips from the Source Monitor to the Timeline, you target the 
track by dragging the clip to it. If you’re adding clips to the Timeline by using the 
Source Monitor’s Insert or Overlay button, you need to target your selected tracks 
or tell Adobe Premiere Pro which track or tracks you want the clip to go to.
You must do two things to target the track or tracks you want to be the destination. 
First, highlight (by selecting) the track or tracks you want to be the destination; then, 
target the track by dragging the source track indicator to the desired track. This may 
sound like a lot to do to target a single video or audio track, but this combination 
of tools can be very useful, such as when you have clips with multiple audio tracks 
attached.
switching multiple cameras
Once you’ve properly built the multicamera source sequence and added it to a 
multicamera target sequence, you’re ready to edit. This task is handled in real time 
using the Multi-Camera Monitor. You can switch between the different angles by 
clicking or by using a keyboard shortcut.
enable recording
The editing of multiple camera angles is actually referred to as recording. In the 
Multi-Camera Monitor, your footage plays back in real time. As you choose the 
desired edits, the results are captured into your computer’s memory. When you 
stop playback, the edits are applied to the open sequence.
1 Choose Window > Multi-Camera Monitor to open the Multi-Camera Monitor.
2 Make the window easier to see by maximizing its size. You can drag a corner of 
the panel to resize it or click the maximize button along the top edge.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 239
3 Play back the footage once to get familiar with it. Press the spacebar to see all 
four angles play in real time.
4 When finished, press the up-arrow key to go to the start of the clip.
5 Familiarize yourself with the available keyboard shortcuts.
Press the 1 key to select Camera 1, press the 2 key to select Camera 2, and so on. 
The first nine angles are assigned to the keys 1–9 by default.
6 When you’re ready to record, click the red Record button to start recording. You 
can also press the 0 key as a shortcut.
7 Press the spacebar to start the clip playing back.
8 Switch between the multiple camera angles based on your personal preference. 
Use the keyboard shortcuts 1–4 that correspond to the camera angle you want 
to switch to while recording.
9 When you reach the end of the recording, the light will turn off automatically.
Alternatively, you can click Stop at any time and then press 0 (zero) to toggle 
recording off. When you stop, the recorded edits are applied to the multicamera 
target sequence. The sequence now has multiple cut edits. Each clip’s label 
starts with [MC#]. The number represents the video track used for that edit.
10 Click the Maximize button to return the Trim Monitor panel to normal size.
Move it so you can see your Timeline.
11 Play back the sequence and review your edit.
P Note: After making 
your edits, you can 
always change them 
in the Multi-Camera 
Monitor or on the 
Timeline.

240 
lesson 10 
multicamera editing
re-record multicamera edits
The first time you record a multicamera edit, you’ll likely miss a few edits. Perhaps 
you cut too late (or too early) to an angle. You also may decide that you like one 
angle better than another.
1 Move the playhead to the start of the Timeline panel.
2. Press the Play button in the Multi-Camera Monitor to start playback.
The angles in the Multi-Camera Monitor switch to match the existing edits in 
your Timeline.
3 When the playhead reaches the spot you want to change, switch the active 
camera.
You can press one of the keyboard shortcut keys (in this case 1–4) or click the 
desired camera’s preview in the Multi-Camera Monitor.
4 When you’re done editing, stop playback by pressing the spacebar.
The Multi-Camera Monitor automatically stops recording.
finalizing multicamera editing
Once you’ve performed a multicamera edit in the Multi-Camera Monitor, you can 
refine it and then finalize. The resulting sequence is like any other sequence you’ve 
built, so you can use any of the editing or trimming techniques you’ve learned so 
far. There are a few other specialized options available, however.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 241
switching an angle in the multi-Camera monitor
If you’re happy with the timing of an edit but not the angle chosen, you can always 
swap the angle for another. One way to do this is to change an edit in the Multi-
Camera Monitor.
1 If closed, open the Multi-Camera Monitor by choosing Window > Multi-
Camera Monitor.
2 Click the Go To Previous (or Next) Edit Point button or use the Page Up or Page 
Down key to navigate between edit points.
The playhead will not move in the Timeline panel.
3 Click a different camera to change the corresponding edit.
4 When finished, close the Multi-Camera Monitor.
Changing an angle in the timeline
If you’re familiar with your camera angles, you can switch between them without 
ever opening the Multi-Camera Monitor. To change a multicamera edit in the 
Timeline, follow these steps:
1
Move the playhead over the clip you want to change to view it.
2
Right-click the clip in the Timeline panel that you want to change.
3
Choose Multi-Camera from the context menu, and choose the camera angle you 
want to use.

lesson 10 
multicamera editing
additional multicamera editing tips
The skills of editing multicamera sources take time to build. You may find that this 
is a complex style of editing (especially as the number of angles increases). Here are 
a few additional helpful tips on multicamera editing in Adobe Premiere Pro:
• You can use any of the Timeline editing tools to change the edit points of 
a multicam sequence.
• You can replay the multicam sequence with the Multi-Camera Monitor from 
any point to reedit the project.
• If you don’t have a good visual clue in the video to sync multiple clips, look for 
a clap or loud noise in the audio track. It’s often easier to sync video by looking 
for a common spike in the audio waveform.
• Audio is taken by multicamera angle 1 by default. This is the first clip that you 
select in the bin; you can then Control+click (Windows) or Command-click 
(Mac OS) to select additional angles. You can change this by going to the 
Multi-camera submenu (in the upper-right corner of the panel) and choosing 
Audio Follows Video. Now the audio will change with each camera angle chosen.
Working with multiple audio tracks
If you need audio to switch with each camera angle, follow these steps:
1
Double-click the multicamera source sequence in the Project panel to open it.
2
Click the visibility icon next to all of the audio tracks that you want active.
3
Close the multicamera source sequence.
4
Edit the multicamera source sequence into a sequence or select one that’s 
already in use.
5
Select just the audio track by Alt-clicking (Windows) or Option-clicking (Mac) in 
the Timeline panel.
6
Choose Clip > Multi-Camera > Enable.
7
Open the Multi-Camera Monitor panel.
8
Click the submenu button in the upper-right corner of the Multi-Camera 
Monitor panel and choose the Audio Follows Video option.
9
Edit using the techniques you’ve learned in this chapter.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn about the following:
• Working in the Audio workspace
• Understanding audio characteristics
• Adjusting clip audio volume
• Adjusting audio levels in a sequence
• Using the Audio Mixer
This lesson will take approximately 50 minutes.

245
Until now, our focus has been primarily on working 
with visuals. No doubt about it, the pictures count, 
but professional editors generally agree that sound is 
at least as important as the images on the screen—
sometimes more important!

246 
lesson 11 
editing and mixing Audio
In this lesson, you’ll learn some audio mixing fundamentals, using the power-
ful tools provided by Adobe Premiere Pro CS6. Believe it or not, good sound can 
sometimes make the pictures look better.
Getting started
It’s rare to have audio recorded on-camera that is perfect for your final output. 
There are several things you might want to do with sound in Adobe Premiere Pro:
• Tell Adobe Premiere Pro how to interpret recorded audio channels differently 
from the way they were recorded in-camera. For example, audio recorded as 
stereo can be interpreted as separate mono tracks.
• Clean up background sound. Whether it is system hum or the sound of an air-
conditioning unit, there are tools for adjusting and tuning your audio.
• Adjust the volume of different audio frequencies in your clips (different tones) 
using EQ effects.
• Adjust the volume level on clips in the bin and on segments in your sequence. 
The adjustments you make on the Timeline can vary over time, creating a 
complete sound mix.
• Add music.
• Add spot effects, such as explosions, door slams, or atmospheric environmental 
sound.
Consider the difference it makes if you turn the sound off when watching a horror 
movie. Scenes that were scary a moment ago can look like comedy without an 
ominous soundtrack.
Music works around many of our intellectual critical faculties and directly influ-
ences our emotions. In fact, your body reacts to sound whether you want it to or 
not. For example, it’s normal for your heart rate to be influenced by the beat of the 
music. Fast music will tend to raise your heart rate, and slow music will tend to 
lower your heart rate. Powerful stuff!
In this lesson, you’ll begin by learning how to use the audio tools in Adobe 
Premiere Pro and then make adjustments to clips and a sequence. You’ll also use 
the Audio Mixer to make changes to your sequence track volumes “on the fly,” while 
your sequence plays.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 247
setting up the interface to work with audio
Adobe Premiere Pro gives access to most aspects of the interface via the Window 
menu. You could open each of the tools used for working with audio one by one by 
going to the menu and selecting them. But there’s a quicker way.
1 Open Lesson 11.prproj. If Adobe Premiere Pro can’t locate the lesson file, refer 
to “Relink the lesson files” in the Getting Started section at the start of this book 
for two ways to search for and relink the file.
2
Choose Window > Workspace > Audio.
3
Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Current Workspace.
4
Click Yes in the Reset Workspace dialog.
the audio workspace
You’ll recognize most of the components of the Audio workspace. One obvious 
difference is that the Audio Mixer is displayed in place of the Source Monitor. The 
Source Monitor is still in the frame; it’s just hidden, grouped in the frame with the 
Audio Mixer.
You’ll notice the audio meters have gone too. This is because the Audio Mixer has 
its own audio meter.
The Audio Mixer is a special part of the Adobe Premiere Pro interface. While the 
effects and controls you have used so far relate to clip segments in a sequence, the 
Audio Mixer makes changes to whole tracks. You can combine adjustments made 
using the Effect Controls panel and the Audio Mixer.
The other difference in the Audio workspace is simply a repositioning of the exist-
ing panels to allow you to focus on your sound.

248 
lesson 11 
editing and mixing Audio
master track output
When you create a sequence, you define the number of audio channels it produces 
by choosing an audio Master setting. If your sequence were a media file, this is how 
many audio channels it would have:
• Stereo: Outputs two audio channels: Left and Right.
• 5.1: Outputs six audio channels: Middle, Front-Left, Front-Right, Rear-Left, 
Rear-Right, and Low Frequency Effects (LFE).
• Multichannel: Outputs between 1 channel and 16 audio channels—you can 
choose.
• Mono: Outputs one audio channel.
Once you have created a sequence, you cannot change the audio Master setting. 
This means, with the exception of multichannel sequences, you cannot change the 
number of channels your sequence will output.
You can add or remove audio tracks at any time, but the audio Master setting is 
fixed. If you need to change your audio Master setting, you can easily copy and paste 
clips from a sequence with one setting to a new sequence with a different setting.
What is an audio channel?
You could be forgiven for thinking that Left and Right audio channels were in some 
way identifiably different. In fact, they are both simply mono audio channels des-
ignated as Left or Right. When recording sound, it is the standard configuration to 
have Audio Channel 1 Left and Audio Channel 2 Right.
We know Audio Channel 1 is Left because of the following:
•
It is recorded from a microphone pointing left.
•
It is interpreted as Left in Adobe Premiere Pro.
•
It is output to a speaker positioned on the left.
None of these factors changes the fact that it is still a single mono channel.
If you do the same for audio recorded from a microphone pointing right (but 
with Audio Channel 2), then you have stereo audio. It’s really just two mono audio 
channels.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 249
audio meters
To use audio meters, do the following:
1 Choose Window > Audio Meters.
In the default Audio workspace, the audio meters are quite small. 
You’ll need to make them bigger so you can work with them.
2 Drag the left edge of the panel a little to make them wider so you 
can see the buttons at the bottom of the panel. You’ll keep them 
on-screen while going through this lesson.
The primary function of the audio meters is to give you an overall 
mix output volume for your sequence. As your sequence plays, you’ll 
see the level meter dynamically change to reflect the volume.
about audio level
The scale on the audio meters is decibels, denoted by dB. The decibel scale is a 
little unusual in that the highest volume is designated as 0. Lower volumes become 
larger and larger negative numbers until they reach negative infinity.
If a recorded sound is too quiet, it might get lost in the background noise. 
Background noise might be environmental, such as an air-conditioning system mak-
ing a hum. It also might be system noise, such as the quiet hiss you hear from your 
speakers when no sound is playing.
When you increase the overall volume of your audio in Adobe Premiere Pro, back-
ground noise gets louder too. When you decrease the overall volume, background 
noise gets quieter. This means it is often better to record audio at a higher level 
than you need and then reduce the volume later to remove (or almost remove) the 
background noise.
Depending on your audio hardware, you may have a different signal-to-noise ratio, 
that is, a bigger or smaller difference between the sound you want to hear (the sig-
nal) and the sound you don’t want to hear (the system noise). Signal-to-noise ratio is 
often shown as SNR, measured in dB.
If you right-click the audio meters, you can choose a different  
display scale. The default is a range from 0dB to −60dB.
You can also choose between static and dynamic peaks: 
When you get a loud “spike” in audio levels that makes you 
glance at the meters, the sound is gone by the time you look. 
With static peaks, the highest peak is marked and main-
tained in the meters so you can see what the loudest level 
was in that playback segment up to that point. You can click 
the audio meters to reset the peak. With dynamic peaks, the 
peak level will continually update.

lesson 11 
editing and mixing Audio
Viewing samples
Let’s look at a sample.
1 In the Music bin in the Source Monitor, open the music clip 11 Rue The Whirl.aif.
Right away, Adobe Premiere Pro displays the waveforms for the two audio 
channels in this music file.
At the bottom of the Source Monitor and Program Monitor, a time ruler shows 
the total duration of the clip.
2 Click the Source Monitor panel menu, and choose Time Ruler Numbers to 
enable them.
The time ruler shows timecode indicators on the time ruler. Try zooming 
in to the time ruler using the navigator. The maximum zoom shows you an 
individual frame.
3 Click the Source Monitor panel menu again, and choose Show Audio Time Units.
This time, you’ll see individual samples counted on the time ruler. Try zooming 
in a little more—now you can zoom in to an individual audio sample, in this 
case, one 44,100th of a second.
4 The Timeline panel has the same option to view audio samples in the panel 
menu. For now, switch off the Time Ruler Numbers option in the Source 
Monitor using the panel menu.
showing audio waveforms
When you open a clip that has only audio (no video) in the Source  
Monitor, Adobe Premiere Pro automatically switches the display to 
show audio waveforms.
When you use the waveform display option in the Source or 
Program Monitor, you’ll see an extra navigator zoom control for 
each channel. These controls work in a way that’s very similar to the 
navigator zoom control at the bottom of the panel. You can resize 
the vertical navigator to see the waveforms larger or smaller, which 
is useful if your audio is quiet.
P Note: The audio 
sampling rate is the 
number of times per 
second the recorded 
sound source is 
sampled. It’s common 
for professional audio 
to take a sample 48,000 
times per second.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 251
You can choose to display audio waveforms for any clip that has audio, using 
the panel Settings menu. The same option exists for the Source Monitor and the 
Program Monitor.
1 Open the clip 16_6B from the Double Identity bin in the Source panel.
2 Click the Settings menu button (
) and choose Audio Waveform.
3 Switch back to viewing the visuals by clicking the Settings menu button again 
and choosing Composite Video.
You can also turn off and on the display of waveforms for clip segments on the 
Timeline.
4 Click the Expand-Collapse Track triangle to toggle the display of waveforms on 
the Timeline.
standard audio tracks
Adobe Premiere Pro brings with it a new kind of audio track. In previous versions, 
it was necessary to use mono tracks for clips that had mono audio and stereo tracks 
for clips that had stereo audio, and you can still work this way if you prefer.
The new Standard audio track type can accommodate both mono audio clips and
stereo clips. The controls in the Effect Controls panel and on the Audio Mixer will 
work with both kinds of media.
If you’re working with a mixture of mono and stereo clips, you’ll find it more con-
venient to use the new Standard track type than the traditional separate mono and 
stereo track types.
This Standard audio track displays the stereo waveform for a music clip and a mono waveform for 
some dialogue.
P Note: This option is 
great if you are trying 
to locate some specific 
dialogue and you are 
not so concerned about 
the visuals.

monitoring audio
You can choose which audio channels you hear when monitoring audio in the 
Source panel or in your sequence.
First, let’s take a look at monitoring different audio channels in the Source Monitor.
1 Open the music clip 11 Rue The Whirl.aif in the Source Monitor.
2 Play the clip, and while you do, try clicking each of the Solo  
buttons at the bottom of the audio meters.
Each Solo button allows you to hear only the channel you select. This is particularly 
useful if you are working with audio where the sound from different microphones 
is recorded onto different tracks. This is common with professionally recorded 
location sound.
The Solo buttons on the audio meters work for sequences too. You  
can use the audio meters to solo an output audio channel or use 
the Toggle Track Output button on each track.
Try these controls with the Double Identity sequence and then 
with the Sunset Montage sequence. You’ll notice turning off one 
track on the Double Identity sequence makes very little differ-
ence. This is because all of the clips have been interpreted (in the bin) as having 
dual mono audio, effectively creating two mono “copies” of the audio. See Lesson 4, 
“Organizing Media,” for more information about interpreting clips.
examining audio characteristics
When you open a clip in the Source Monitor and view the waveform, you’re see-
ing each channel displayed. The taller the waveform, the louder the audio for that 
channel.
There are just three factors that change the way audio sounds to your ears. Let’s 
consider them in terms of a television speaker.
• Frequency: How fast the speaker moves. The number of times the surface of 
a speaker beats the air per second is measured as Hertz (Hz). Human hearing 
ranges from approximately 20Hz to 20,000Hz. Many factors, including age, can 
change the frequency range you can hear.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 253
• Amplitude: How far the speaker moves. The bigger the movement, the louder 
the sound, because this produces a higher-pressure wave, which carries more 
energy to your ears.
• Phase: The precise timing with which the surface of the speaker moves outward 
and inward. If two speakers move outward and inward in sync, they are 
considered “in phase.” If they move out of sync, they become “out of phase,” and 
this can produce problems with sound reproduction. One speaker reduces the 
air pressure in exactly the moment the other speaker is attempting to increase 
it. The result is that you may not hear parts of the sound.
We’re using the surface of a speaker as a simple example of the way sound is gener-
ated, but, of course, the same rules apply to all sound sources.
What are audio characteristics?
Imagine the surface of a speaker moving as it beats the air. As it moves, it creates a 
high- and low-pressure wave that moves through the air until it arrives at your ear in 
much the way that ripples move across the surface of a pond.
As the pressure wave hits your ear, it makes a tiny part of it move, and that move-
ment is converted into electrical energy that is passed to your brain and interpreted 
as sound. This happens with extraordinary precision, and since you have two ears, 
your brain does an incredible job of balancing the two sets of sound information to 
produce an overall sense of what you can hear.
Much of the way we hear is active, not passive. That is, your brain is constantly filter-
ing out sounds it decides are irrelevant so you can focus your attention on things 
that matter. For example, you have probably had the experience of being at a party 
where the general hubbub of conversation sounds like a wall of noise until some-
one across the room mentions your name. You perhaps didn’t realize your brain was 
listening to the conversation the whole time, because you were concentrating on 
listening to the person standing next to you.
There is a body of research on this subject that broadly falls under the title psycho-
acoustics. For these lessons, we’ll be focusing on the mechanics of sound more than 
the psychology, though it is a fascinating subject worthy of further study.
Electronic recording equipment makes no such discrimination, which is part of 
the reason why it is so important to listen to location sound with headphones and 
to take care to get the best possible recorded sound. It’s common practice to try 
to record location sound with no background noise at all. The background noise 
is added in post-production at precisely the right level to add atmosphere to the 
scene but not to drown out the dialogue.

lesson 11 
editing and mixing Audio
adjusting audio volume
There are several ways to adjust the volume of clips with Adobe Premiere Pro, and 
they are all nondestructive—that is, nothing will ever be changed in your original 
media file.
adjusting audio in the effect Controls panel
You have used the Effect Controls panel to make adjustments to the scale and 
position of clips in a sequence. You can also use the Effect Controls panel to 
adjust volume.
1 Open the Armchair sequence from the Sequences bin.
This is a very simple sequence with just one clip in it. However, the clip has 
been added to the sequence twice. One version has been set (in the bin) as 
Stereo, and the other has been set as Mono.
2 Select the first clip, and go to the Effect Controls panel (you must select a clip to 
see its controls in the Effect Controls panel).
3 Expand the Volume, Channel Volume,  
and Panner controls in the Effect 
Controls panel.
This is what the controls do:
•
Volume: Adjusts the combined 
volume of all the audio channels in 
the selected clip.
•
Channel Volume: Allows you to 
adjust the audio level for individual 
channels in the selected clip.
•
Panner: Gives you overall stereo 
left/right balance control for the 
selected clip.
Notice the stopwatch icon automatically is on for all of the controls. This means 
every change you make is automatically going to add a keyframe.
However, if you add only one keyframe to the audio level, it automatically 
adjusts the overall level for the clip.
P Note: The volume 
adjustments for 
individual channels are 
cumulative with the 
overall volume level 
adjustment. This means 
you can add a boost 
or cause unintentional 
audio distortion by 
combining them.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 255
4 Try lowering the Volume level for this clip. As you do, watch the yellow rubber 
band on the clip as it appears on the Timeline.
Adobe Premiere Pro adds a keyframe, and the rubber band moves down to 
show the reduced volume.
5 Position the Timeline playhead where you would like the keyframe to be 
added (it doesn’t make too much difference if you intend to make only one 
adjustment).
6 Click and drag the orange numbers that set the volume level in the Effect 
Controls panel.
Before
After
7 Now select the second version of the Double Identity clip in the sequence.
You’ll notice you have similar controls available in the Effect Controls panel, 
but now there is no Channel Volume option. This is because each channel is 
its own clip segment, so the Volume control for each channel is already an 
individual one.

256 
lesson 11 
editing and mixing Audio
adjusting audio gain
Most music is created with the loudest possible signal to maximize the difference 
between the signal and the background noise. This is much too loud to use in most 
video sequences. To address this issue, you need to adjust the clip’s audio gain.
1 Open the clip 11 Rue The Whirl.aif from the Music bin in the Source Monitor.
2 Right-click the clip in the bin, and choose Audio Gain.
P Note: None of the changes you make to the volume of your clips will change the original media 
files. You can make a change to the overall gain here, in the bin, or on the Timeline, in addition to 
any changes you make using the Effect Controls panel, and your original media files will remain 
unmodified.
There are two options in the Audio Gain panel that we’re interested in for now:
•
Set Gain to: Use this option to specify a particular volume adjustment for 
your clip.
•
Adjust Gain by: Use this option to specify an incremental volume 
adjustment for your clip. For example, if you apply −3 dB, this will adjust the 
“Set Gain to” amount to −3 dB. If you go into this menu a second time and 
apply another −3 dB adjustment, the “Set Gain to” amount will change to −6 
dB, and so on.
3 Set the gain to −20 dB, and click OK.
Right away, you’ll see the waveform change in the Source Monitor.
Changes like this, where you are adjusting the audio gain in the bin, will not ret-
roactively update clips already in a sequence. However, you can right-click one or 
more clips in a sequence and make the same kind of adjustment there.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 257
Gain and volume— 
what’s the difference?
Different applications sometimes use these words in different ways. Here’s how to 
think of them when working with Adobe Premiere Pro.
Gain: Gain is an early-stage adjustment to your audio level. This is made before 
fine-tuning or keyframing audio adjustments that change over time. Gain is a 
logarithmic scale, adjusting audio in a way that is similar to the way a “Levels” visual 
effect adjusts brightness. Louder parts of the audio are adjusted differently than 
quieter parts.
Volume: Volume adjustments apply equally to louder and quieter parts. It’s more 
like the brightness adjustment for visuals.
normalizing audio
Normalizing audio is very similar to adjusting gain. In fact, the result of normaliza-
tion is an adjustment to the clip gain. The difference is that normalization is based 
on an automatic process of analysis, rather than your subjective judgment.
When you normalize a clip, Adobe Premiere Pro analyzes the audio to identify 
the single highest peak—the loudest part of the audio. The gain for the clip is then 
adjusted automatically so that the highest peak matches a level you specify.
Using normalization, you can have Adobe Premiere Pro adjust the volume for mul-
tiple clips so that they match any perceived volume you like.
Imagine working with multiple clips of a voice-over, recorded over several days. 
Perhaps because of different recording setups or working with different micro-
phones, several clips have different volumes. You can select all of the clips and, in 
a single step, have Adobe Premiere Pro automatically set their volumes to match. 
This saves significant time you would have spent manually going through each clip, 
one by one, to make an adjustment.

258 
lesson 11 
editing and mixing Audio
Try this now:
1 Open the Double Identity sequence.
2 Play a little of the sequence and watch the level on the audio meters.
The footsteps at the beginning of the sequence are pretty loud, especially if you 
compare them with the engine noise later.
3 Lasso to select all of the early walking clips. The last one is 3D_SER1. We don’t 
need the 3C_2-2 cutaway clip because it had no audio.
4 Right-click any of the selected clips and choose Audio Gain.
5 Set Normalize Max Peak to −8 dB, click OK, and have another listen.
Adobe Premiere Pro adjusts every clip so that the loudest peak is at −8 dB. This 
sounds a little more natural. The footsteps are still nicely audible, but there’s a 
real intensity when the car arrives.
If you choose Normalize All Peaks, rather than Normalize Max Peak, Adobe 
Premiere Pro will make an adjustment over time that keeps the louder parts of the 
audio at the level you set. This is very useful if you have audio with one really loud 
part and you want it to generally have an even level.

E Tip: You can apply 
normalization in the bin 
too. Just select all the 
clips you would like to 
automatically adjust, go 
to the Clip menu, and 
choose Audio Options >

sending audio to  
adobe audition Cs6
While Adobe Premiere Pro has advanced tools to help you achieve most audio-
editing tasks, it can’t compete with Adobe Audition, which is a dedicated audio 
post-production application.
Audition is a component of Creative Suite 6 Production Premium and Creative 
Suite 6 Master Collection. It integrates neatly into your workflow when editing with 
Adobe Premiere Pro.
You can send your current sequence to Adobe Audition automatically, bringing all 
of your clips and a video file based on your sequence to produce an audio mix that 
follows along with the pictures.
To send your sequence to Adobe Audition, follow these steps:
1
Open the sequence you would like to send to Adobe Audition.
2
Go to the Edit menu, and choose Edit > Edit in Adobe Audition > Sequence.
3
You’ll be creating new files to work with inside Adobe Audition to keep your 
original media unchanged, so choose a name and browse for a location, then 
choose the remaining options as you prefer, and finally click OK.
Adobe Audition CS6 has fantastic tools for working with sound. It has a special spec-
tral display that helps you remove unwanted noises, a high-performance multitrack 
editor, and advanced audio effects and controls. For more information about Adobe 
Audition, go to www.adobe.com/products/audition.html.
Creating a split edit
Split edits are a simple, classic effect that offsets the cut point for audio and video. 
The audio from one clip is played with the visuals from another, carrying the feeling 
of one scene into another. Let’s try this with the Double Identity clips.
Open the sequence Double Identity Extended.
adding a j-cut
A J-cut gets its name from the shape of the edit. Picture the letter J over an edit. 
The lower part (the audio cut) is to the left of the upper part (the video cut).
1 Play the last part of the sequence. While the dangerous-looking man is watching 
the car leave, the sequence cuts to an office scene, where a man is dialing a 
number on an old-style telephone.
2 Select the Rolling Edit tool (
).

260 
lesson 11 
editing and mixing Audio
3 While holding the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key, click the video 
segment edit (not the audio), and drag a little to the right. Congratulations! You 
have created a J-cut!
4 Play through the edit.
You’d perhaps want to adjust the duration of the audio transition to smooth the 
join, but for its practical purpose the J-cut works.
adding an L-cut
An L-cut works in the same way as a J-cut but  
in reverse. Repeat the steps in the previous 
exercise, but try using the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key as you drag the video 
segment edit a little to the left. Play through 
the edit and see what you think.
adjusting audio levels in a sequence
As well as adjusting clip gain, you can use the rubber-band controls to change the 
volume of clips in a sequence. You can also change the volume for tracks, and the 
two volume adjustments will combine to produce an overall output level.
If anything, using rubber bands to adjust volume is more convenient than adjusting 
gain because you can make incremental adjustments at any time, with immediate 
visual feedback.
The result of adjusting the rubber bands is the same as adjusting the volume using 
the Effect Controls panel.
adjusting overall clip levels
To adjust overall clip levels, do the following:
1 Open the Sunset Montage sequence in the Sequences bin.
The music for this sequence already has an audio gain adjustment of −20 dB, 
but you can make some further adjustments using the rubber band on the clip.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 261
A fade-up and a fade-down have already been applied to the music volume, at 
the beginning and end. Let’s boost the volume between the fades a little.
2 Use the Selection tool to click and drag down at the bottom of the Audio 1 track 
header to make the track taller. This will make it easier to apply fine adjustments 
to the volume.
3 Click the middle part of the rubber band on the 11 Rue The Whirl.aif music clip 
in the sequence, and drag up a little.
As you drag, a small tool tip appears, displaying the amount of adjustment you 
are making.
Because you’re clicking and dragging a segment of the “rubber band” as opposed 
to a keyframe, you’re adjusting the overall level for the segment between the two 
existing keyframes. If the clip had no keyframes to begin with, you’d be adjusting 
the overall level for the entire length of the clip.
keyframing volume changes
If you click and drag an existing keyframe, you’ll adjust it. This is the same as mak-
ing adjustments to visual effects using keyframes.
The Pen tool (
) adds keyframes to rubber bands. You can also use it to adjust 
existing keyframes or lasso lots of keyframes to adjust them.
You don’t need to use the Pen tool, though. If you want to add a keyframe where 
there is none, you just need to add the Control (Windows) or Command (Mac) key 
when you click the rubber band. Then you can adjust the keyframe as required.
The result of adding and adjusting the position of keyframes up or down on audio 
clip segments is that the rubber band is reshaped. Just as before, the higher the rub-
ber band, the louder the sound.
Add a few keyframes to the music and listen to the results.
E Tip: If you adjust the 
audio gain, the effect 
is combined with the 
keyframe adjustments 
dynamically. You can 
change either at any 
time.

262 
lesson 11 
editing and mixing Audio
smoothing volume between keyframes
Those adjustments are pretty dramatic. You might want to smooth the adjustments 
over time, and this is easy to do.
Right-click any of your keyframes.
You’ll see a range of standard options, including Ease In, 
Ease Out, and Delete. If you use the Pen tool, you can 
lasso multiple keyframes and then right-click any one of 
them to apply a change to them all.
The best way to learn about the different kinds of key-
frame is to select each kind, make some adjustments, 
and see the results. In the following example, all of the 
keyframes have been set to Continuous Bezier, which maintains the same curved 
line into the keyframe and out.
track vs. clip keyframes
Until now, all of your adjustments have been made to clip segments. Adobe 
Premiere Pro has similar controls available for whole tracks. The track-based 
keyframes work in the same way as the clip-based ones. Of course, the difference is 
that they don’t move with the clips.
This means you can set up keyframes for your audio level using track controls and 
then try different music tracks. Each time you put new music into your sequence, 
you’ll hear it through the adjustments you have made to your track.
To switch to working with track keyframes rather than clip keyframes, do the 
following:
1 Select the Sunset Montage sequence in the Sequences bin, right-click it, and 
choose Duplicate. It’s a good idea to try new things on a copy of your sequence, 
rather than risking making unwanted changes to the original.
2 Rename the copy to Music Experiment.
P Note: Adjustments 
you make to your clips 
are applied before 
adjustments you make 
to your tracks.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 263
3 Open the new sequence, Music Experiment.
4 With the Selection tool, select the music clip 11 Rue The Whirl.aif, and delete it.
5 Use the Audio 1 Show Keyframes button menu to choose Show Track Volume. 
You don’t need Show Track Keyframes, because you’re working with just 
volume (rather than lots of effects).
6 Lower the overall volume for the track by dragging the track rubber band down, 
and then add a series of keyframes so you can hear the results when you add 
some music. In practice, you would set keyframes so that the music dips under 
voice-over or live-action speech.
7 Drag the 11 Rue The Whirl.aif clip straight from the Music bin to the Audio 1 
track. Position the clip at the start of the sequence. Play your sequence. You’ll 
hear the results of the music, combined with the track keyframes.
8 Undo to remove the music, and add the clip 06 Departure From Cairo.aif from 
the Cairo Music bin instead. Play the sequence, and once again, you can hear 
the results of your keyframes.
This powerful approach to using keyframes on the Timeline might take a little 
planning to make the most of it, but it’s worth the effort! It allows you to try lots of 
different music tracks before you settle on the one you want.
E Tip: Be sure to 
switch back to clip 
keyframes to continue 
working on your 
sequence. While view-
ing track keyframes, you 
can’t select your clips.

264 
lesson 11 
editing and mixing Audio
Working with the audio mixer
While the Effect Controls panel gives you control over clip segments in sequences, 
the Audio Mixer provides control over tracks. The keyframes you have just added 
to your Music Experiment sequence are the kind the Audio Mixer adds and can 
respond to.
overview of the audio mixer
The Audio Mixer is broadly divided into three parts.
Effects and sends
Pan
Volume faders
• Effects and sends: You can use drop-down menus here to add special effects 
to a whole track or send the audio from the track to a submix.
• Pan: This is just like the Pan control in the Effect Controls panel. However, the 
adjustments you make here apply to the whole track.
• Volume faders: These are industry-standard controls, based on real-world 
audio mixing desks. You move the fader up to increase the volume and move 
it down to decrease the volume. You can also use the volume faders to add 
keyframes to your track audio rubber band while you play the sequence 
(see “Understanding automation modes” later in this chapter).

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 265
What is a submix?
Submixes act as conduits for audio tracks. Audio tracks usually send their audio 
to the Master output directly.
You can, instead, configure multiple audio tracks to send their audio to a submix. 
This allows you to use one set of controls (the submix) to adjust things like volume 
and pan, or to apply one special effect, for multiple tracks.
The submix sends its audio to the Master output, just as a regular track does. The 
main difference is that you can’t put any audio clips into a submix track; they exist 
only to combine the outputs from multiple tracks.
For example, imagine you have recorded audio for five people in a darkened room, 
and you want it to sound like a cavern, with a strong reverb. Each original audio 
source is on its own track in the sequence.
One option would be to put the reverb special effect on each track. This would work, 
but it would be a lot of work for your system to play back, and it would require a lot 
of clicks if you wanted to change the effect—you’d have to make each adjustment 
five times.
If, instead, you send the output from each of the five tracks to a single submix, you 
can apply the reverb effect to that submix. You’ll hear the five tracks via the submix, 
so you need to adjust only one effect, and your system will need to calculate only 
one effect, instead of five.
understanding automation modes
Using the Audio Mixer, you can add new keyframes to your audio tracks while 
your sequence plays. This way, you can create an audio mix “live.” Simply play your 
sequence and adjust the volumes for tracks using the Audio Mixer.
Adobe Premiere Pro needs to know how you would like the Audio Mixer fader con-
trol to interact with existing keyframes. You just need to choose the right automa-
tion mode before you begin.
Here’s what each mode means:
• Off: In this mode, the fader will ignore any keyframes and remain 
exactly where it is. You can make any changes you like to the 
fader, and it will affect the playback volume for the whole track.
• Read: In this mode, the fader follows existing keyframes, 
dynamically changing the playback volume for the track. You cannot add 
keyframes using the fader in this mode.
• Latch: In this mode, the fader will follow existing keyframes, but if you grab 
the fader and make adjustments, new keyframes will be applied to the track, 
replacing existing ones. When you release the fader, it stays where you put it, 

266 
lesson 11 
editing and mixing Audio
so if the sequence keeps playing, a new “flat” level adjustment is made to the 
track, continuing to replace existing keyframes until you stop playback.
• Touch: In this mode, the fader will follow existing keyframes, but if you grab 
the fade and make adjustments, new keyframes will be applied to the track, 
replacing existing ones. When you release the fader, it returns to following 
existing keyframes.
• Write: In this mode, the fader does not follow existing keyframes at all. As you 
play the sequence, new keyframes are created based on the position of the fader, 
replacing existing ones. When you release the fader, as in Latch mode, it will 
stay where you leave it, adding a flat level adjustment until you stop playback.
Try this for yourself:
1 Use the Music Experiment sequence you created earlier. Make sure the Audio 1 
track is set to display track keyframes or track volume. Either is fine because the 
default keyframe type is Audio volume.
2 Position the Timeline playhead at the beginning of the sequence.
3 Using the Audio Mixer, set the automation mode for the Audio 1 to Touch.
4 Play the sequence and, while it plays, make some adjustments to the Audio 1 
fader. When you stop playback, you’ll see the new keyframes that you added.
5 Try each of the other automation modes to compare the results.
You can adjust keyframes you create this way just as you would adjust keyframes 
created using the Selection tool or the Pen tool.
E Tip: You can adjust Pan in the same way as you would adjust volume using the Audio Mixer. 
Simply play your sequence and make adjustments using the Audio Mixer’s Pan control.
Producing a 5.1 mix with  
adobe audition
The advanced audio features in Adobe Premiere Pro include support for 5.1 audio. 
You can even work with 5.1 audio clips and master to 5.1 audio. However, Adobe 
Audition has a dedicated surround sound mixer that makes 5.1 mixes amazingly fast 
and easy.
If you plan to use surround sound in your sequence, consider completing your video 
edit in Adobe Premiere Pro and switching to Adobe Audition for your mix.
P Note: You will not 
see new keyframes until 
you stop playback.

6
Does the Audio Mixer add keyframes to clip segments or tracks?
review answers
1 Use the Solo buttons at the bottom of the audio meters to selectively hear an audio 
channel for clips in the Source Monitor.
2 Stereo audio has two audio channels, and mono audio has one. It is the universal 
standard to record audio from a Left microphone as channel 1 and audio from a Right 
microphone as channel 2 when recording stereo sound.
3 Use the Settings button menu on the Source Monitor to choose Audio Waveform. You 
can do the same with the Program Monitor, but you probably won’t need to; clips can 
display waveforms on the Timeline.
4 Normalization automatically adjusts the gain setting for a clip based on the original 
volume. You can use the Gain setting to make manual adjustments.
5 The sound for the next clip begins before the visuals when using a J-cut. With L-cuts, 
the sound from the previous clip remains until after the visuals begin.
6 The Audio Mixer works exclusively with tracks, never clips. When you add keyframes 
using the Audio Mixer, you will not be able to see them (though they will still have an 
effect) unless you set your audio track to Show Track Keyframes.

lesson 12 
sweetening sound
Getting started
You’ll find more than 30 audio effects in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6. These effects can 
be used to change pitch, create echoes, add reverb, and remove tape hiss. All of the 
effects can have keyframes set as well as have their parameters adjusted over time.
Additionally, you can use the Audio Mixer to blend and adjust the sounds from all 
the audio tracks in your project. You can also combine multiple audio tracks into 
a single submix and apply effects, panning, or volume changes to those groups as 
well as to individual tracks.
For this lesson, you’ll use a new project file.
1 Start Adobe Premiere Pro, and open the project Lesson 12.prproj.
The sequence 01 Effects should already be open.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Audio.
This changes the workspace to the preset that the Adobe Premiere Pro 
development team created to make it easier to work with audio editing.
3 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Current Workspace, and click Yes in the 
dialog that opens.

sweetening sound with audio effects
Ideally, your audio will come in perfectly. Unfortunately, video production is rarely 
a process filled with ideals. At some point, you’ll need to turn to audio effects to 
fix problems. In this lesson, you’ll try a few of the most useful effects in Adobe 
Premiere Pro.
These can be used for a variety of tasks including the following:
• DeNoiser: This audio effect can detect and remove hiss or noise automatically.
• Reverb: This can increase the “presence” in the recording with reverb. Use it to 
simulate the sound of a larger room.
• Delay: This effect can add a slight (or pronounced) echo to your audio track.
• Bass: This effect can increase the low-end frequencies of an audio clip. It works 
well on narration clips, particularly for male voices.
• Treble: This adjusts the higher-range frequencies in an audio clip.
adjusting bass
Adjusting the amplitude of the lower frequencies can improve the overall sound for 
a male voice. In this example, let’s modify an announcer’s voice.

Open the Audio Effects folder in the Effects panel.
4
Drag the Bass effect to the  
Ad Cliches Mono.wav clip.
5 Open the Effect Controls panel.
6 Increase the Boost property to 
add more bass.
Experiment using different values to increase or decrease the presence of bass 
until you hear a sound you like. Be sure to pay attention to your overall audio 
levels because adjustments can change the volume of the clip. You may need to 
use the Audio Mixer panel to maintain proper levels.
P Note: Be sure 
to expand your 
knowledge about 
audio effects in Adobe 
Premiere Pro. You are 
wise to experiment 
with different effects, 
because they are 
nondestructive. This 
means they do not 
change the original 
audio clip. You can add 
any number of effects 
to a single clip, change 
parameters, and then 
delete those effects and 
start over.

adding a delay
The use of a delay is a stylized effect. It can be used on an announcer’s voice to add 
drama or used to create a feeling of space using stylized echoes.
1 In the Audio Effects folder in the Effects panel, locate the Delay effect.
2 Drag the Delay effect onto the Ad Cliches Mono.wav clip.
3 Play the clip back to hear the Delay effect. Currently, there is an echo that is 
offset by one second.
4 Experiment by adjusting these three parameters:
• Delay: This refers to the time before the echo plays (zero to two seconds).
• Feedback: This is the percentage of echo added back to audio to create 
echoes of echoes.
• Mix: This is the relative loudness of echo.
5 Play the clip to hear the impact of each adjustment.
6 Enter the following values to get a classic 
stadium announcer effect.
• Delay: .250 seconds
• Feedback: 20%
• Mix: 10%
7 Play the clip, and move the sliders to experiment with the effect.
Lower values are more palatable, even with this over-the-top audio clip. 
Remember that less is more. Generally speaking, a subtle effect is more 
pleasant to the listener.
adjusting pitch
Another adjustment you can make is pitch. This is a useful way to change the over-
all degree of a tone for a sound produced by the voice. By modifying pitch, you can 
change the energy level, apparent age, or even species of a speaker.
1 In the Audio Effects folder in the Effects panel, locate the PitchShifter effect.
2 Drag the PitchShifter effect onto the Ad Cliches Mono.wav clip.
3 In the Effect Controls panel, click the disclosure triangle for the Custom Setup 
properties to show the parameters for the effect.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 273
This panel includes three items: knobs, presets, and a Reset button. You can tell 
an audio effect has presets by the tiny triangle next to what would normally be 
the Reset button and the addition of a rectangular Reset button (as shown here).
4 Try some of the presets, and note their values below the knobs in the Effect 
Controls panel.
5 Use the Individual Parameters sliders to tweak the sound. Experiment by using 
wildly different pitch settings from –12 to +12 semitone steps, and switching 
Formant Preserve on and off.
adjusting treble
Earlier you applied and adjusted the Bass effect to modify the lower frequencies 
of an audio track. If you’d like to modify the opposite range, use the Treble effect. 
Treble is not simply the Bass effect in reverse. Treble increases or decreases higher 
frequencies (4,000 Hz and greater), while the Bass effect changes low frequen-
cies (200 Hz and less). The human-audible frequency range is roughly 20 Hz to 
20,000 Hz.
1 Drag the playhead so it is over the second clip in the Timeline panel (Music 
Mono).
2 Play the second clip to get familiar with its sound.
3 In the Audio Effects folder in the Effects panel, locate the Treble effect.

274 
lesson 12 
sweetening sound
4 Drag the Treble effect onto the Music Mono clip.
5 Increase the Boost property to add more treble.
Experiment using different values to increase or decrease the presence of treble 
until you hear a sound you like.
adding reverb
Reverb is similar to the Delay effect but is better suited to musical tracks, and it 
can simulate how a sound would be perceived in different types of rooms. It works 
particularly well for pieces that feature strong guitar but can be used on just about 
any clip that you like. It is a powerful effect that can give some real life to audio 
recorded in an acoustically flat room—a room such as a recording studio with 
minimal reflective surfaces.
1
In the Audio Effects folder in the Effects panel, locate the Reverb effect.
2
Drag the Reverb effect onto the Music Mono clip.
3
In the Effect Controls panel, open Reverb’s Custom Setup.
4
If necessary, click the Show/Hide Timeline View button to make more room for 
the graphic interface.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 275
5 Click the Presets button, and try some of the presets.
Note their values below the knobs in the Effect Controls panel.
6 Experiment with the seven control knobs.
•
Pre Delay: This is the apparent distance the sound travels to the reflecting 
walls and back.
•
Absorption: This assesses how much of the sound is absorbed (not 
reflected).
•
Size: This refers to the apparent relative size of the room.
•
Density: This is the density of the reverb “tail.” The greater the Size value, the 
greater the Density range (from 0% to 100%).
•
Lo Damp: This dampens low frequencies to prevent the reverb from 
rumbling or sounding muddy.
•
Hi Damp: This dampens high frequencies. A lesser Hi Damp setting makes 
the reverb sound softer.
•
Mix: This is the amount of reverb.
E Tip: The Reverb effect is a Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plug-in. These are custom-designed 
audio effects that adhere to a standard set by Steinberg audio. Invariably, those who create VST 
audio effect plug-ins want them to have a unique look and offer some very specialized audio effects. 
Many VST plug-ins are available on the Internet.
EQ
If you have a good amplifier or car stereo, it probably features a graphic equal-
izer. The EQ controls go beyond simple Bass and Treble knobs and add multiple 
sliders (often called bands) for greater control over the sound. There are two kinds 
of equalization effects in Adobe Premiere Pro: an EQ effect (with five bands) 
and the Parametric EQ effect, which offers a single band (but can be combined 
multiple times).

276 
lesson 12 
sweetening sound
EQ
The EQ effect in Adobe Premiere Pro is similar to a traditional three-way 
EQ (which controls lows, mids, and highs). This effect, however, offers three 
midfrequency controls for even greater accuracy. This is a useful effect to 
smooth out a sound and emphasize (or deemphasize) part of a track.
1 In the Project panel, locate the sequence 02 EQ and open it.
This sequence contains one musical track.
2 Locate the EQ effect in the Effects panel (try using the search field at the top of 
the window), and drag it onto the clip.
3 In the Effect Controls panel, click the triangle next to the Custom Setup section 
of the EQ effect.
You may need to adjust the size of the window or scroll to see all the controls 
at once.
4 Play the clip to get familiar with its sound.
5 Select the check box to activate the Low frequency filter.
6 Set the Low frequency to 70 Hz to change the affected area, and lower the gain 
to −10.0 dB. This decreases the intensity of the Bass area.
7 Play the sequence to hear the changes.
Let’s refine the vocals.
8 Select the check box to activate the Mid1 frequency filter.
P Note: In the next 
exercise, use the 
suggested numbers for 
guidance. Feel free to 
experiment with values, 
however, because your 
taste and speakers 
may vary.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 277
9 Set its gain to −20.0 dB and adjust the Q factor to 1.0 for more transition on the 
EQ adjustment.
10 Play back the sequence to hear the changes.
11 Select the check box to activate the Mid2 frequency filter.
12 Set its frequency to 1500 Hz and its gain to 6.0 dB. Adjust the Q factor to 3.0 for 
more transition on the EQ adjustment.
13 Play back the sequence to hear the changes.

278 
lesson 12 
sweetening sound
14 Select the check box to activate the  
High frequency filter, and set its gain 
to −8.0 dB to lower the highest 
frequencies.
The overall volume is too high, and the 
audio meters show that the level for 
your file is too loud.
15 Lower the Output slider for the effect 
to approximately −3.0 dB.
16 Play the sequence to hear the changes.
EQ
If you want the ability to go beyond five frequency ranges, then the Parametric EQ 
may meet your needs. Although you can select only one frequency range with the 
Parametric EQ, you can use it multiple times and select multiple frequencies. This 
lets you build as complex an equalizer as you need within the Effect Controls panel.
1 In the Project panel, locate the sequence 03 Parametric EQ and open it.
This sequence contains one musical track and already has the Parametric EQ 
effect applied seven times. Each effect is currently disabled by the use of the 
Bypass check box.
P Note: Avoid setting 
the volume too high 
(the VU meter line will 
turn red). That leads to 
distortion.
E Tip: Another way 
to use the Parametric 
EQ effect is to target 
a specific frequency 
and either boost it or 
cut it. You can use this 
effect to cut a particular 
frequency, like a high-
frequency noise or a 
low hum.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 279
2 Play the clip to get familiar with its sound.
There are seven effects applied that affect the audio. They are arranged from low 
frequencies (top of list) to high frequencies (bottom of list).
3 Deselect the first Bypass check box.
4 Play the sequence to hear the changes.
5 Continue deselecting the Bypass check boxes one at a time, and listen to the 
change in the audio track after each deselection.
applying effects in the audio mixer
When you work with audio tracks, you may become overwhelmed. Every clip on 
every track will play together at the same time. In the previous lesson, you learned 
how to use the Audio Mixer panel to start mixing the volume of your tracks so 
they played in a unified and intelligible manner. You also may recall learning about 
submixes.
P Note: Listing all the attributes of all the audio effects is beyond the scope of this book. To learn 
more about audio effect parameters, search Adobe Premiere Pro Help.

280 
lesson 12 
sweetening sound
Creating an initial mix
A submix essentially lets you control the volume and other characteristics for 
multiple audio tracks at once. While you can adjust volume levels by using each 
clip’s volume graph in the Timeline or Volume effect in the Effect Controls panel, 
it’s much easier to use the Audio Mixer to adjust volume levels and other character-
istics for your initial mix.
Using a panel that looks a lot like a production studio’s mixing hardware, you move 
track sliders to change volume, turn knobs to set left/right panning, add effects to 
entire tracks, and create submixes. Submixes let you direct multiple audio tracks to 
a single track so you can apply the same effects, volume, and panning to a group of 
tracks without having to change each of the tracks individually.
In this exercise, you will mix a song recorded by a choir in a studio:
1 Double-click Music Sonoma Stereo Mix (in the Media Bin), and play it in the 
Source Monitor. This is how your final mix should sound.
2 In the Project panel, locate the sequence 04 Submixes, and double-click to load it.
3 Play the 04 Submixes sequence, and note that the instruments are way too loud 
compared to the choir.
4 Select and adjust the Audio Mixer panel so you can see all five tracks plus the 
master track. You’ll want to leave extra room for two more tracks. You can resize 
a panel by dragging on the bar in between the panels or the corner handle.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 281
5 Change the track names along the bottom row of the Audio Mixer by selecting 
each one in turn and typing a new name: Left, Right, Clarinet, Flute, and Bass
(as shown here).
Those name changes also appear in the audio track headers in the sequence.
6 Play the sequence, and adjust the sliders in the Audio Mixer to create a mix that 
you think works well.
A good place to start is setting Left to +4, setting Right to +2, and dropping the 
Clarinet, Flute, and Bass to –12, –10, and –12, respectively.
7 Watch the master track VU (volume unit) meter as you make your adjustments.
Little hash marks that float above the volume meters indicate the loudest 
passages. When you’ve set the audio meters to Dynamic Peaks (the default 
setting), they remain for a couple of seconds and then move as the music 
volume changes. These hash marks provide a good way to see how balanced 
your left and right channels are. You want them to approximately line up most 
of the time. If you want to change to Static Peaks, right-click the audio meters 
and choose this option. Now peaks will hold for the entire duration of playback.

282 
lesson 12 
sweetening sound
8 Adjust each channel’s Left/Right Pan by using the knobs at the top of each track 
(when completed, your parameters should match those shown here):
•
Left: All the way left (−100)
•
Right: All the way right (+100)
•
Clarinet: Left-center (−20)
•
Flute: Right-center (+20)
•
Bass: Centered (0)
Creating a submix
As you place your audio clips into audio tracks on the Timeline, you can choose to 
apply effects and set volume and panning on a clip-by-clip basis. As you did earlier, 
you can also use the Audio Mixer to apply volume, panning, and effects to entire 
tracks. In either case, by default Adobe Premiere Pro sends audio from those clips 
and tracks to the master track.
But sometimes you might want to route tracks to submix tracks before sending 
them onto the master track. The purpose of submix tracks is to save you steps and 
ensure some consistency in how you apply effects, volume, and panning. In the 
case of the Sonoma recording, you can apply Reverb with one set of parameters 
to the two choir tracks, and you can apply Reverb with different parameters to the 
three instruments. The submix can then send the processed signal to the master 
track, or it can route the signal to another submix.
1 Continue working with the sequence 04 Submixes from the previous exercise.
2 Right-click an audio track header in the Timeline, and using the figure shown 
here as a guide, choose Add Tracks.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 283
3 Set the Add values for Video Tracks and Audio Tracks to 0, set the Add value 
for Audio Submix Tracks to 2, and set Track Type for Audio Submix Tracks to 
Stereo; then click OK.
That adds two submix tracks to the Timeline and two tracks to the Audio Mixer 
(they have a darker hue), and it adds those submix track names (Submix 1 and 
Submix 2) to the pop-up menus at the bottom of the Audio Mixer.
4 Adjust the size of the Audio Mixer panel (if needed) to see all of its controls.
5 Click the Left track’s Track Output Assignment pop-up menu (at the bottom of 
the Audio Mixer), and select Submix 1.
6 Do the same for the Right track.
Now both the Left and Right tracks have been sent to Submix 1. Their 
individual characteristics—panning and volume—will not change.

284

7 Send the three instrument tracks to Submix 2.
applying effects to a submix
Now that the tracks are properly patched, you can adjust them using the two sub-
mixes. Let’s use the Reverb effect you explored earlier in this lesson.
1 If necessary, click the Show/Hide Effects and Sends disclosure triangle at the top 
of the Audio Mixer panel.
2 Click the Solo button for the Submix 1 Track.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 285
3 Click the Effect Selection button for the Submix 1 track (the little drop-down 
list to the right of the panel), and choose Reverb from the pop-up menu.
4 Adjust the Reverb parameters to make it sound like the choir is singing in a 
large auditorium. Click the menu at the bottom (currently labeled PreDelay). 
Switch to Size, and set it to about 60. This is a good place to start.
5 Apply Reverb to the Submix 2 track.
6 Click the Solo Track button for Submix 2, and disable the Solo switch for 
Submix 1.
7 Apply a Reverb effect to Submix 2, and adjust to your personal taste. Try to set 
its parameters to create a sound a bit less dramatic than the voices.
8 Click the Solo button on Submix 2 to disable it.
9 Play the track, and listen to these two submixes as a single mix to hear how 
they sound.
10 Feel free to tweak the Volume and Reverb settings.
11 Play your sequence to review your overall mix.
E Tip: After working 
in the Audio Mixer 
for a while and then 
returning to the 
Timeline, you might not 
hear anything. Audio 
Mixer Mute and Solo 
settings do not show 
up in the Timeline 
but are still in effect 
when you play a clip 
in the Timeline, even 
if the Audio Mixer is 
closed. So, check those 
Mute and Solo settings 
before shutting down 
the Audio Mixer.

Cleaning up noisy audio
Of course, it’s always best to record perfect audio at the source. However, some-
times you cannot control the origin of the audio and it’s impossible to re-record 
it, so you are stuck needing to repair a bad audio clip. You’ll find versatile tools in 
Adobe Premiere Pro for fixing common audio problems.
highpass and Lowpass effects
The Highpass and Lowpass effects often work to improve a clip, used together or 
independently. The Highpass effect is used to remove all frequencies that fall below 
a certain frequency (think of it as letting all things higher than the threshold pass 
through). The Lowpass filter is the direct opposite. It eliminates all frequencies 
above the specified Cutoff frequency. The Highpass and Lowpass effects are avail-
able for 5.1, stereo, or mono clips.
1 In the Project panel, locate the sequence 05 Noisy Reduction, and double-click 
to load it.
2
Play back the sequence to get familiar with the sound quality.
3
In the Effects panel, locate the Highpass effect, and drag it onto the clip.
4
Play your sequence.
It probably sounds overly processed because the threshold is set too high.
5 In the Effect Controls panel, adjust the Cutoff slider to a lower value.
You can play back the clip and make adjustments at the same time to hear the 
adjustment being applied in real time. Adjust the value to minimize some of the 
lower-frequency noise in the background. A value near 200.0 Hz works well.
6 In the Effects panel, locate the Lowpass effect, and drag it onto the clip.
7 Adjust the Cutoff slider for the Lowpass effect.
Experiment with different values to familiarize yourself with how the two 
effects interplay. It is possible to remove all noise by setting the two effects to 

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 287
overlapping values. Pull down some of the higher frequencies that are making 
the recording sound “tinny.”
notch effect
The Notch effect is useful for removing all frequencies that are near a specified 
value. The effect essentially targets a frequency range and then eliminates those 
sounds. The effect works well for removing power-line hum and other electri-
cal interference. In this clip, you can hear the sounds of fluorescent light bulbs 
buzzing overhead.
1 Continue working with the sequence 05 Noisy Reduction.
2 Click the Bypass option for both the Highpass and Lowpass effects to 
temporarily disable them.
3 Play back the sequence and listen for the electrical hum. You may need to turn 
up your speakers.
4 In the Effects panel, locate the Notch Effect and apply it to your clip. Drag the 
filter to the top of the stack so it is applied first.
5 Adjust the Center slider to target the frequency to be removed.
Power-line hum tends to be either 50 Hz or 60 Hz.
6 Adjust the Q slider to affect the range being processed by the effect.
A low setting creates a narrow band; a high setting creates a wide band.
While this is helping a bit, let’s take a more aggressive approach to the repair.
P Note: A 60 Hz 
or 50 Hz hum can 
be caused by many 
electrical problems, 
cable problems, or 
equipment noise. 
The frequency varies 
because of the different 
electrical systems used 
around the world.

288 
lesson 12 
sweetening sound
Dynamics
Another audio effect that is easy to use is the Dynamics effect. It provides a robust 
set of controls for multiple properties that can be combined or used independently 
to adjust audio. You will likely find that the graphical controls in the Custom Setup 
view are easiest to use, but you can adjust values in the Individual Parameters view.
You can use the following properties to adjust audio with the Dynamics effect:
• AutoGate: This cuts off a signal when its level falls below the specified 
threshold. This is a very useful way to remove unwanted sounds (such as 
background noise behind an interview or narrator).
• Compressor: This option is used to balance the dynamic range and create a 
consistent audio level throughout the duration of the clip.
• Expander: This option is used to reduce all signals below the specified 
threshold. It is similar to using the AutoGate controls but can be more subtle in 
its adjustments. Be sure to adjust both the threshold and the ratio while playing 
back the clip to find the right settings that sound natural while still removing 
the unwanted noise.
• Limiter: Use the Limiter option to reduce clipping in audio clips that peak too 
high. You can set a threshold between –60 dB and 0 dB. Adobe Premiere Pro 
reduces all signals that exceed the threshold to the same level as the threshold.
1
Continue working with the sequence 05 Noisy Reduction.
2
Remove all other effects from the Effect Controls panel for the selected clip.
3
In the Effects panel, locate the Dynamics effect, and apply it to your clip.
4
In the Effect Controls panel, expand the Custom Setup controls for the effect, 
and scroll the window to view all controls.
5 Enable the AutoGate option only, and listen to the clip.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 289
The background noise should be dramatically reduced. Adjust the Threshold 
dial to taste.
6 Make sure the Compressor option is active, and adjust its settings to taste to 
make the sound a bit fuller. Play back the clip, and adjust as needed.
7 Disable the AutoGate option and enable the Expander to try to remove the 
background noise in a different manner.
8 Play the clip, and adjust the Threshold and Ratio for the Expander option 
to taste.
9 Enable the Limiter option, and set it to −12.00 dB, which is a level commonly 
used in audio mastering.
10 Play the clip, and look at the audio meters (if not visible, you can enable them 
under the Window menu).

removing background noise  
with adobe audition
Adobe Audition is a companion application to Adobe Premiere Pro found in both the Creative Suite 
and Creative Cloud families that feature Adobe Premiere Pro. This dedicated audio application does 
a great job offering advanced mixing and effects to improve your overall sound. If you have Adobe 
Audition installed, you can try the following:
1
In Adobe Premiere Pro, open the sequence 06 Send to Audition from the Project panel.
2
Select the clip Noisy Audio.aif in the Timeline.

Right-click the clip and choose Edit Clip in Adobe 
Audition. A new version of the audio clip is 
extracted and added to your project.
Adobe Audition opens, along with the new clip.
4
Switch to Adobe Audition.
5
The stereo track should be visible in the Editor panel.
Adobe Audition presents you with a large waveform for the clip. You now need to select the part 
of the clip that’s just the noise to define it; then you can reduce that noise through the whole clip.

4 Name three ways to remove background noise from a clip.
review answers
1 The PitchShifter effect can modify the apparent pitch or energy level for a clip while 
still maintaining sync with a video clip.
2 Delay creates a distinct, single echo that can repeat and gradually fade. Reverb creates 
a mix of echoes to simulate a room. It has multiple parameters that take the hard edge 
off the echo you hear in the Delay effect.
3 The easiest way to create a submix track is to assign those three tracks to that submix 
track and apply the effect to the submix.
4 You can use a Notch or Dynamics effect within Adobe Premiere Pro or send the clip to 
Adobe Audition to use its advanced noise reduction controls.

295
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 features more than 100 video 
effects. Most effects come with an array of parame-
ters, all of which you can animate—have them change 
over time—by using precise keyframe controls.

296 
lesson 13 
Adding Video effects
Getting started
Video effects can be used for many reasons. They can solve problems with image 
quality (such as exposure or color balance). They can create complex images 
through compositing using techniques such as chromakeying. They can also be 
used to solve a variety of production problems such as camera vibration and rolling 
shutter. Effects can also be used for stylistic purposes. You can alter the color or 
distort footage. You can animate the size and position of a clip within the frame.
Working with effects
Adobe Premiere Pro makes working with effects easy. You can drag an effect to a 
clip, or you can select the clip and double-click the effect in the Effects Browser. 
You can combine as many effects as you want on a single clip, which can produce 
surprising results. Moreover, you can use an adjustment layer to add the same 
effects to a collection of clips.
When it comes to choosing which video effects to use, the choices in Adobe 
Premiere Pro can be a bit overwhelming. The application has more than 100 built-
in effects. Several effects are also available from third-party manufacturers for sale 
or free download. It’s important to understand how effects are treated in Adobe 
Premiere Pro.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 297
fixed effects
Once you add a clip to a sequence, it will automatically have a few effects applied. 
These effects are called fixed effects, and they can be thought of as controls for the 
standard geometric, opacity, and audio properties that every clip should have. All 
fixed effects can be modified using the Effect Controls panel.
1
Start Adobe Premiere Pro, and open Lesson 13.prproj.
2
Double-click to open the sequence 01 Fixed Effects.
3
Click to select the first clip in the Timeline.
4
Switch to the Effects workspace by choosing Window > Workspace > Effects.
If your workspace doesn’t look similar to what you see here, choose Window > 
Workspace > Reset Current Workspace.
5 Select the Effect Controls panel (it should be docked with the Source Monitor).
6 Examine the fixed effects applied.
By default, fixed effects are automatically applied to every clip in a sequence, 
but they do not change the clip until they are manipulated.

7 Click the disclosure triangle next to each to show their properties.
•
Motion: The Motion effect allows you to animate, rotate, and scale a clip. 
You can also use advanced antiflicker controls to decrease shimmering 
edges for an animated object. This comes in handy when you scale a high-
resolution source and Adobe Premiere Pro must resample the digital image.
•
Opacity: The Opacity effect lets you control how opaque or transparent a 
clip is. Additionally, you can access multipurpose blending modes to create 
special effects and real-time composites. You’ll explore this more in Lesson 
15, “Exploring Compositing Techniques.”
•
Time Remapping: This property lets you slow down, speed up, or reverse 
playback, or even freeze a frame. We explored its uses in Lesson 8, 
“Advanced Editing Techniques.”
•
Volume: If an edited clip has audio, the Volume effect is automatically 
applied. You can use the effect to control the volume for the individual clip.
8 Click to select the second clip in the Timeline. Look closely at the Effect 
Controls panel.

These effects have keyframes, meaning that their values have been changed 
over time. In this case, a small scale and pan were applied to the clip to create 
a digital zoom and recompose the shot. We’ll explore keyframes more later in 
this chapter.
9 Press Play to watch the current sequence back a few times and compare the 
two shots.
the effects Browser
Besides the fixed effects you’ve already explored, Adobe Premiere Pro has standard 
effects. You’ll use standard effects to affect a clip’s image quality and appearance. 
Because you’ll have more than 100 effects to choose from, Adobe Premiere Pro 
attempts to simplify the process by organizing them. You’ll find 16 standard catego-
ries (third-party effects may add more choices). These categories group effects into 
logical tasks such as Distort, Keying, and Time. This makes it easier to choose the 
correct effect that you want to apply.

Adding Video effects
6 Click the New Custom Bin icon at the bottom  
of the panel.
The New Custom bin/folder appears in the 
Effects panel below Video Transitions. Let’s 
rename the bin.
7 Click once to select the bin. 
8 Click once more directly on the 
bin’s name (Custom Bin 01) to 
highlight it and change it.
9 Change its name to something like 
Favorite Effects. 
10 Open any Video Effects folders, and drag a few effects into your custom bin. 
For now, just choose ones that sound interesting to you. You can add or remove 
effects from the Favorite Effects bin at any time.
P Note: With so many Video Effects subfolders, it’s sometimes tricky to locate the effect you want. 
If you know part or all of an effect’s name, start typing it in the search box at the top of the Effects 
tab. Adobe Premiere Pro immediately displays all effects and transitions that contain that letter 
combination, narrowing the search as you type.
As you browse the many effects, you’ll notice several icons next to many of the 
effects names. Knowing what these icons represent may influence which effects you 
choose to use in a project.
Accelerated effects 32-bit color 
YUV effects
P Note: The effects 
remain in their original 
folder and also appear 
in yours. You can use 
custom folders to build 
effect categories that 
match your work style.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 301
accelerated effects
The first icon (which has an accelerated playback triangle) indicates that the effect 
is accelerated by your graphics processing unit (GPU). Remember that the GPU 
(typically called a video card) can greatly enhance the performance of Adobe 
Premiere Pro. If at all possible, try to use a card that is supported by the Mercury 
Playback Engine; with a supported card installed, these effects often offer acceler-
ated or even real-time performance and need rendering only on final export. You’ll 
find a list of supported cards on the Adobe Premiere Pro product page.
GPU acceleration offers the following benefits:
• You can stack multiple effects onto multiple video layers and play them back 
without rendering, often in real time.
• The 32-bit floating-point pipeline supports all the 32-bit effects available in 
Adobe Premiere Pro.
32-bit color (high-bit-depth) effects
You’ll find that some effects have an icon next to them with the number 32. This 
indicates that the effects support processing in a 32-bits-per-channel mode, which 
is also called high bit depth or float processing.
You should use high-bit-depth effects when either of the following is true:
• You’re working with video shot with 10- or 12-bits-per-channel codecs (such as 
RED or ARRI).
• You want to maintain greater image fidelity when multiple effects are applied to 
any footage.
Additionally, 16-bit photos or Adobe After Effects files rendered in 16- or 32-bits-
per-channel color space can take advantage of high-bit-depth effects.
To take advantage of high-bit-depth effects, make sure your sequence has the 
Maximum Bit Depth video-rendering option selected. You’ll find this choice in the 
New Sequence or Sequence Settings dialog.
YuV effects
If you need to use effects that process the color in an image, it’s likely that they have 
been optimized to work in YUV. Effects without the YUV label in Adobe Premiere 
Pro process in the computer’s native RGB space, which can make adjusting expo-
sure and color less accurate.
The YUV effects break down the video into a Y channel (or luminance channel) and 
two channels for color info (without brightness). This is how most video footage 
is structured natively. These filters make it easy to adjust contrast and exposure 
without shifting color.
P Note: When using 
any 32-bit effects, 
try to use only 32-bit 
effects in the chain for 
maximum quality. If you 
mix and match effects, 
the effects will have 
to switch back to 8-bit 
space to process, which 
will reduce the overall 
precision and accuracy 
of the image.
P Note: You’ll see 
many Video Effects 
categories. Some 
effects are difficult 
to categorize and 
could reside in 
multiple categories 
or in categories by 
themselves, but this 
taxonomy works 
reasonably well.

302 
lesson 13 
Adding Video effects
applying effects
Virtually all the video effect parameters are accessible within the Effect Controls 
panel, making it easy to set the behaviors and the intensity of those effects. You can 
add keyframes independently to every attribute listed in the Effect Controls panel 
to make those behaviors change over time. In addition, you can use Bezier curves 
to adjust the velocity and acceleration of those changes.
1 Continue working with the sequence 02 Browse.
2 If necessary, click the Effects tab next to the Project panel to make it visible.
3 Type black into the Effects Browser search field to narrow the results. Locate 
the Black & White video effect.
4 Drag the Black & White video effect on the clip Cowboy in the Timeline.
Applying this effect immediately converts your full-color footage to black 
and white—or, more accurately, grayscale. It also puts that effect in the Effect 
Controls panel.
5 Make sure the clip Cowboy is selected in the Timeline panel.
6 If necessary, click the Effect Controls tab to open it.
7 Toggle the Black & White effect off and on 
by clicking the “fx” button next to the effect 
name in the Effect Controls panel. Be sure the 
current-time indicator is on this footage clip 
to view the effect.
Toggling an effect on and off is a good way to see how it works with other 
effects. This toggle switch is the only parameter available with the Black 
& White effect. The effect is either on or off.
P Note: You can 
reorder standard effects 
by dragging them up 
or down in the list, but 
you can’t reorder fixed 
effects. This can cause 
problems because 
effects might be scaled 
after another effect 
is applied.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 303
8 Check that the clip is selected so that its parameters are displayed in the Effect 
Controls panel, click Black & White to select it, and then press the Delete key.
9 Type direction into the Effects Browser search field to narrow the results. 
Locate the Directional Blur video effect.
10 In the Effects Browser, double-click the effect to apply it.
11 In the Effect Controls panel, expand the Directional Blur effect’s filter, and note 
that there are options the Black & White effect did not have: Direction, Blur 
Length, and a stopwatch next to each option (the stopwatch icon is to activate 
keyframing, which we will cover later in this lesson).
12 Set Direction to 90.0 degrees and Blur Length to 4 to simulate the scene being 
filmed with a slow shutter speed.
13 Expand the Blur Length option, and move the slider in the Effect Controls 
panel.
As you change that setting, it shows up in real time in the Program Monitor.
14 Open the Effect Controls panel menu, and choose Remove Effects.
15 Click OK in the dialog that pops up asking which effects you want to remove. 
You want to remove them all.
This is an easy way to start fresh.
E Tip: Fixed effects in Adobe Premiere Pro have to process in a specific order, which can lead 
to unwanted scaling or resizing. While you can’t reorder fixed effects, you can bypass them and 
use other effects, which are similar. For example, you can use the Transform effect instead of the 
Motion effect or the Alpha Adjust effect instead of the Opacity effect. Although these effects are not 
identical, they are a very close match and behave similarly. You may choose to use them when you 
need to reorder effects that perform these actions.

304 
lesson 13 
Adding Video effects
other ways to apply effects
To make working with effects more flexible, there are three ways to reuse an effect.
•
You can select an effect from the Effect Controls panel, choose Edit > Copy, 
select the Effects Controls panel of a destination clip, and choose Edit > Paste.
•
To copy all the effects from one clip so you can paste them to another clip, 
select the clip in the Timeline and choose Edit > Copy, select the destination clip, 
and choose Edit > Paste Attributes.
•
You can create an effects preset to store a particular effect with settings for 
reuse later. We’ll cover this technique later in this lesson.
using adjustment layers
Sometimes you’ll want to apply an effect to multiple clips. Adobe Premiere Pro 
CS6 offers an easy way to do this called an adjustment layer. The concept is simple: 
Create a new layer that can hold effects and sit above other video tracks. Everything 
beneath the adjustment layer will be processed by the effect. You can adjust the 
trim handles and opacity of the adjustment layer to further control the effect. It 
also makes it much easier to adjust a single effect, rather than multiple instances 
applied to several clips.
Let’s create a global effect for a sequence that’s already been edited.
1 Click the Project panel.
2 Double-click to open the sequence 03 Multiple Effects.
3 At the bottom of the Project panel, click the New Item button and choose 
Adjustment Layer. Click OK to create the adjustment layer to match the 
dimensions of the current sequence.
A new adjustment layer is added to the Project panel.
P Note: This sequence 
has been simplified to 
reduce space on the 
disk. This sequence 
originally used multiple 
audio tracks.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 305
4 Drag the adjustment layer to track Video 2 in the current Timeline.
5 Drag the right edge of the adjustment layer so it extends to the end of the 
sequence.
The adjustment layer should look like this.
Let’s create a film-look effect by using filters and modifying the opacity of the 
adjustment layer.
6 In the Effects Browser, search for and locate the Fast Blur effect.
7 Drag the effect onto the adjustment layer.
8 Move the playhead position to 27:00 to have a good close-up shot to use when 
designing the effect.

306 
lesson 13 
Adding Video effects
9 In the Effect Controls panel, set Blurriness to a heavy value like 25.0 pixels. Be 
sure to select the Repeat Edge Pixels checkbox to apply the effect evenly.
Let’s blend the effect using a blending mode to create the film look. Blending 
modes let you mix two layers together based on their brightness and color 
values. You’ll learn more about them in Lesson 15.
10 Click the disclosure triangle next to the Opacity property in the Effect Controls 
panel.
11 Change the blending mode to Soft Light to create a gentle blend.

Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 ClASSroom in A book 307
12 Set Opacity to 75% to fade the effect.
You can click the visibility icon of the adjustment layer (the eyeball next to 
Video 2) in the Timeline panel to see the before and after states of the effect.

Adding Video effects
sending a clip to adobe after effects
If you’re working with a computer that also has Adobe After Effects installed, you can easily send 
clips back and forth between Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects. Thanks to the close relationship 
between Adobe Premiere Pro and After Effects, you can seamlessly integrate the two tools much more 
easily than any other editing platform. This is a useful way to significantly extend the effects capabili-
ties of your editing workflow.
The process you’ll use to move clips is called Dynamic Link. Dynamic Link is revolutionary and will 
totally change how you approach working with media throughout the post-production process. With 
Dynamic Link you can seamlessly exchange clips with no unnecessary rendering.
1
In an open sequence, select the clips you want in an After Effects composition. For this exercise, 
you can use the sequence 04 Dynamic Link.
2
Right-click any of the selected clips.
3
Choose Replace With After Effects Composition.
4
If it’s not running already, After Effects launches. If the After Effects Save As dialog appears, enter a 
name and location for the After Effects project, and click Save. Name the project Lesson 13-01.aep
and save it to the Lessons folder. A new composition is created and inherits the sequence settings 
from Adobe Premiere Pro. The new composition is named based on the Adobe Premiere Pro 
project name, followed by “Linked Comp.”
5
In the After Effects project panel, double-click to load the Lesson 13-01 Linked Comp 02.
There are lots of ways to apply effects with After Effects. To keep things simple, let’s work with 
animation presets. For more on effects workflow, see the Adobe After Effects CS6 Classroom in a Book.
6
Locate the Effects & Presets panel, click its submenu in the upper-right corner, and choose Browse 
Presets.

Adobe Bridge launches to let you visually browse the presets.
You can navigate through folders to see icons for each preset. Click an icon to see a preview of the 
effect.
8
Double-click the Image-Creative folder to browse presets.
9
You can single-click a preset to see an animated preview.
10 Double-click the Colorize - sepia.ffx preset; when you switch back to After Effects, the preset will

13 Twirl down the disclosure next to the Tint and Fill effects to see their controls.
14 Click the swatches for each color to adjust which colors are used for the Tint effect. Move the sepia 
tone into slightly cooler tones.
15 Click the RAM Preview button to preview the effect. After the frames are cached, the file will play 
back in real time.
16 Choose File > Save to capture your changes.
17 Switch back to Adobe Premiere Pro. The frames will process in the background and be handed off 
from Adobe After Effects to Adobe Premiere Pro. You can also select the clip in the Timeline and 
choose Sequence > Render Effects in Work Area.
You can browse and download several presets from the Adobe website by visiting www.adobe.com/
go/learn_ae_cs3additionalanimationpresets. Most of the posted presets are free. This is also an excel-
lent way to explore the larger After Effects community.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 311
keyframing effects
The concept of keyframes dates back to traditional animation. The lead animator 
would draw the keyframes (or major poses), and then assistant animators would 
animate the frames in between (a process often called tweening). These days, you’re 
the master who sets the major keyframes, and the computer does the rest of the 
work as it interpolates values in between the keyframes you set.
adding keyframes
You can change almost all parameters for all video effects over time through the use 
of keyframes. For example, you can have an effect gradually change out of focus, 
change color, or lengthen its shadow.
1 Click the Project panel.
2 Double-click to open the sequence 05 Keyframes.
3 Watch the clip back a few times to get familiar with the footage.
4 In the Effects Browser, locate the Lens Flare effect. Apply it to the video layer.
5 Twirl down the disclosure triangle next to the Lens Flare effect, and adjust the 
Lens Flare effect so it is positioned like the following figure.
P Note: If you don’t 
move the playhead to 
the clip you’re applying 
an effect to, you won’t 
see that clip or its effect 
in the Program Monitor. 
Selecting a clip does 
not move the playhead 
to that clip.

312 
lesson 13 
Adding Video effects
6 Expand the display of the Effect Controls panel until its view is wide enough. 
You can drag in between panels to resize them. If needed, click the Show/Hide 
Timeline View button.
7 Put the playhead at the start of the sequence.
8 Click the stopwatch icons to toggle animation for the Flare Center and Flare 
Brightness properties.
9 Move the playhead to the end of the clip.
You can drag the playhead directly in the Effect Controls panel. Make sure you 
see the last frame of video and not black.
10 Adjust Flare Center and Flare Brightness so the flare drifts across the sky with 
the camera pan and gets brighter. Use the following figure for guidance.
11 Play back the sequence to watch the effect animate over time.
E Tip: Be sure to use the Next and Previous Keyframe buttons to move between keyframes 
efficiently. This will discourage Adobe Premiere Pro from adding unwanted keyframes.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 313
adding keyframe interpolation and velocity
Keyframe interpolation changes the behavior of an effect parameter as it moves 
toward or away from a keyframe. The default behavior you’ve seen so far is linear; 
in other words, you have a constant velocity between keyframes. What generally 
works better is something that mirrors your experience or exaggerates it, such as 
a gradual acceleration or deceleration.
Adobe Premiere Pro offers a way to control those changes: keyframe interpolation 
and the Velocity graph. Keyframe interpolation is the easiest (basically two clicks), 
while tweaking the Velocity graph can become challenging. Getting a handle on 
this feature will take some time and practice on your part.
For this lesson, you can use the previous sequence or open 06 Interpolation.
1 Make sure you can see the Effect Controls panel’s Timeline (click the Show/Hide 
Timeline View button near the top of the panel if needed).
2 Position the current-time indicator at the beginning of the clip.
The Lens Flare effect is currently animated before the camera movement, so it 
can be tweaked for more natural movement.
3 Right-click (Windows) or Control-click (Mac OS) the first keyframe for the 
Flare Center property.
4 Choose the Temporal Interpolation > Ease Out method to create a gentle 
transition into the move from the keyframe.
P Note: When working with position-related parameters, the context menu for a keyframe will 
offer two types of interpolation options: spatial interpolation (related to location) and temporal 
interpolation (related to time). You can make spatial adjustments in the Program Monitor as well as 
in the Effect Controls panel. You can make temporal adjustments on the clip in the Timeline and in 
the Effect Controls panel. These motion-related topics are covered in Lesson 9.

314 
lesson 13 
Adding Video effects
5 Right-click the second keyframe for the Flare Center property. Choose the 
Temporal Interpolation > Ease In method to create a gentle transition from the 
stationary position of the last keyframe.
Let’s modify the Flare Brightness property.
6 Click the first keyframe for Flare Brightness and then hold down the Shift key 
and click the second keyframe so both are active.
7 Right-click either Flare Brightness keyframe and choose Auto Bezier to create 
a gentle animation between the two properties.
8 Play back the animation to watch the changes you’ve made.
Let’s further refine the keyframes with the Velocity graph.
9 Place the mouse cursor over the Effect Controls panel and then press the 
` (grave) key to maximize the panel full-screen. This will let you better see 
the keyframe controls.
10 Twirl down the disclosure triangles next to the Flare Center and Flare 
Brightness properties.
The Velocity graph shows the velocity between keyframes. The sudden drops or 
jumps represent sudden changes in acceleration—jerks, in physics parlance. The 
farther the point or line is from the center, the greater the velocity.
11 Try adjusting the handles of the keyframes to change how steep or gentle the 
velocity curve is.
12 Press the ` key to restore the default window arrangement.
13 Play back your sequence to see the impact of your changes. Continue to 
experiment until you have the hang of keyframes and interpolation.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 315
understanding interpolation methods
Here’s a rundown of the keyframe interpolation methods of Adobe Premiere Pro.
•
Linear: This method is the default behavior, which creates a uniform rate of 
change between keyframes.
•
Bezier: This method lets you manually adjust the shape of the graph on either 
side of a keyframe. Beziers allow for sudden acceleration changes into or out of 
a keyframe.
•
Continuous Bezier: This method creates a smooth rate of change through a 
keyframe. Unlike with Bezier, if you adjust one handle, the handle on the other 
side of the keyframe moves in a complementary fashion to ensure a smooth 
transition through the keyframe.
•
Auto Bezier: This method creates a smooth rate of change through a keyframe 
even if you change the keyframe parameter value. If you choose to manually 
adjust the keyframe’s handles, it changes to a Continuous Bezier point, retaining 
the smooth transition through the keyframe. The Auto Bezier option can 
occasionally produce unwanted motion, so try one of the other options first.
•
Hold: This method changes a property value without a gradual transition 
(sudden effect change). The graph following a keyframe with the Hold 
interpolation applied appears as a horizontal straight line.
•
Ease In: This method slows down the value changes entering a keyframe.
•
Ease Out: This method gradually accelerates the value changes leaving 
a keyframe.
effects presets
To save time on repeated tasks, Adobe Premiere Pro supports effect presets. You’ll 
find that there are several presets included for specific tasks already, but the true 
power lies in creating your own presets to solve repetitive tasks. When you create 
an effect preset, it can even store keyframes for animation.
using built-in presets
You can use one of the effects presets included with Adobe Premiere Pro. These are 
useful for tasks such as beveling, picture-in-picture effects, and stylized transitions.
1 Click the Project panel.
2 Double-click to open the sequence 07 Presets.
This sequence has two clips, a video shot and a logo superimposed. Let’s 
animate a reveal of the logo using an animation preset.
P Note: Effects are 
great ways to animate 
or move a graphic 
or some text over a 
video clip.

316 
lesson 13 
Adding Video effects
3 In the Effects panel, expand the Presets bin and expand the Mosaics bin. If you 
don’t see it, clear the search field.
4 Drag the Mosaic In preset onto the paladin-logo.psd clip on Video 2.
5 Play back the sequence to watch the logo animate onto the screen.
6 Click the paladin-logo.psd clip on Video 2, and view its controls in the Effect 
Controls panel.
7 Experiment with adjusting the position of the keyframes in the Effect Controls 
panel to customize the effect.
saving effects presets
Although there are several effect presets to choose from, creating your own is a 
really good idea. This process is easy and creates a preset file that you can  easily 
move between computers. The process comes down to selecting exactly what 
you want.
1 Click the Project panel.
2 Double-click to open the sequence 08 Creating Presets.
This Timeline has two clips and two instances of a show logo.
3 Play back the sequence to watch the initial animation.
4 Select the first instance of paladin_logo.psd.
5 Select the Effect Controls panel, and choose Edit > Select All to choose all of the 
effects applied to the clip.
You can also select individual properties if you want only part of the effects 
stored. Control+click (Windows) or Command+click (Mac OS) multiple effects 
in the Effect Controls panel. In this case, however, use all.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 317
6 In the Effect Controls panel, click the submenu and choose Save Preset.
7 In the Save Preset dialog, name the effect Logo Animation.
8 Choose one of the following preset types to specify 
how Adobe Premiere Pro should handle keyframes 
in a preset:
•
Scale: Proportionally scales the source keyframes 
to the length of the target clip. Any existing 
keyframes on the original clip are deleted.
•
Anchor to In Point: Preserves the position of 
the first keyframe as well as the relationship of other keyframes in a clip. 
Other keyframes are added to the clip relative to its In point. Use this option 
for this exercise.
•
Anchor to Out Point: Preserves the position of the last keyframe as well as 
the relationship of other keyframes in a clip. Other keyframes are added to 
the clip relative to its Out point.
9
Click OK to store the affected clip and keyframes as a new preset.
10 In the Effects panel, locate the Presets folder.
11 Locate the newly created Logo Animation preset.
12 Drag the Logo Animation preset onto the second instance of the 
paladin_logo.psd file in the Timeline.
13 Watch the sequence play back to see the newly applied title animation.

lesson 13 
Adding Video effects
frequently used effects
Throughout this lesson you’ve explored several effects. Although it’s beyond the 
scope of this book to explore all of the effects, we’ll cover three additional effects 
that are very useful in many editing situations. By looking at the possibilities, you’ll 
have a better appreciation for the options that lie ahead.
Image stabilization and rolling shutter reduction
The Warp Stabilizer effect is a new addition to Adobe Premiere Pro CS6. It can 
remove jitter caused by camera movement (which is more and more common with 
today’s lighter-weight cameras). The effect is useful because it can remove unstable 
parallax-type movements (where images appear to shift on planes). Additionally, 
the effect can repair a visual artifact that is common with CMOS-type sensors 
(such as those on DSLR cameras) and has the ability to compensate for rolling shut-
ter. This makes the images appear to have an optical bending of material that has 
strong vertical lines.
Let’s explore the effect.
1 Click the Project panel.
2
Double-click to open the sequence 09 Warp Stabilizer.
3
Play back the sequence to evaluate the wobbly shot.
4
Select the clip in the Timeline panel.
5
In the Effects Browser, locate the Warp Stabilizer effect. Double-click it to apply 
it to the selected shot.
The Warp Stabilizer effect is applied to the layer. The footage is immediately 
analyzed between its In and Out points.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 319
The analysis process takes two steps, and you’ll see a banner across the footage 
as it’s being analyzed. You can also see a progress update in the Effect Controls 
panel. While the analysis is in progress, you can keep working in the sequence.
6 You can enhance the effect with several useful Stabilization method options, 
including these three:
•
Result: You can choose Smooth Motion to retain the general camera 
movement (albeit stabilized), or you can choose No Motion to attempt to 
remove all camera movement. For this exercise, choose Smooth Motion.
•
Smoothness: This option specifies how much of the original camera 
movement should be retained for Smooth Motion. Use a higher value to 
smooth out the shot the most. Experiment with this shot until you’re happy 
with its stability.
•
Method: You can use the four methods available. The two most powerful, 
because they warp and process the image more heavily, are Perspective and 
Subspace Warp. If either method creates too much distortion, you can try 
switching to Position, Scale, and Rotation, or just Position.
7 Play back the sequence.
E Tip: If you notice that some of the details in the shot appear to wobble, you may be able to 
improve the overall effect. In the Advanced section, choose the Detailed Analysis option. This 
makes the Analysis phase do extra work to find elements to track. You can also use the Enhanced 
Reduction option from the Rolling Shutter Ripple option under the Advanced category. These 
options are much slower but produce superior results.

lesson 13 
Adding Video effects
timecode burn-in
If you need to send a review copy of a sequence to a client or colleague, the 
Timecode effect is very useful. You can apply the effect to an adjustment layer and 
have it generate a visible timecode for the entire sequence. This is helpful because 
it allows others to make specific feedback based on a unique point in time. You can 
control the display of Position, Size, Opacity, the timecode display, and its format 
and source.
1 Click the Project panel.
2 Double-click to open the sequence 10 Timecode Burn-In.
3 In the Project panel, click the New Item list, and choose Adjustment Layer. 
Click OK.
A new adjustment layer is added to the Project panel.
4 Drag the adjustment layer to track Video 2 in the current Timeline.
5 Drag the right edge of the adjustment layer so it extends to the end of the 
sequence.
6 In the Effects Browser, locate the Timecode effect. Drag it onto the adjustment 
layer to apply it.
7 Set Time Display to 24 to match the frame rate of the sequence.
8 Choose a timecode source. In this case, use the Generate option and set the 
Starting Timecode option to 01;00;00;00 to match the sequence.
9 Adjust the Position and Size options for the effect.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 321
It’s a good idea to move the timecode window so it’s not blocking critical action 
in the scene or obscuring any graphics. If you plan to post the video to the Web

Lighting is one of the most intense effects in Adobe Premiere Pro. You can add up 
to five virtual lights to creatively adjust the effect. You can modify a light effect’s 
property including the lighting type, direction, intensity, color, lighting center, and 
lighting spread. This exercise combines hands-on, step-by-step tasks with experi-
mentation. The purpose is to introduce you to a couple more advanced lighting 
effects and to encourage you to explore further.
1 Choose Help > Adobe Premiere Pro Help.
2 Search Adobe Premiere Pro Help for Lighting effects.
This gives you an explanation of each parameter—25 in all—in the Lighting 
effects. Every Adobe Premiere Pro video and audio effect has such a listing 
in Adobe Premiere Pro Help. This also illustrates how complete and useful 
Adobe Premiere Pro Help is. Quickly read the article to familiarize yourself 
with the effect.
3 Quit Help to return to Adobe Premiere Pro.
4 Load the sequence 11 Lighting Effects.
5 Choose Video Effects > Adjust, select Lighting Effects, and drag it to the clip in 
the Video 1 track.
P Note: If you want 
to show the timecode 
for the original clip, 
you’ll need to apply the 
timecode effect directly 
to every clip in the 
sequence.

review answers
1 Drag the effect to the clip, or select the clip and double-click the effect in the Effects 
panel.
2 Move the current-time indicator in the Effect Controls panel to where you want a 
keyframe, and activate keyframing by clicking the “Toggle animation” button; move 
the current-time indicator, and click the Add/Remove Keyframe button; and with 
keyframing activated, move the current-time indicator to a position, and change a 
parameter.
3 You need to move the Timeline current-time indicator to the selected clip to see it in 
the Program Monitor. Simply selecting a clip does not move the current-time indicator 
to that clip.
4 Add an adjustment layer above the clips you want to affect. You can then apply an 
effect that will modify all the clips below the layer.
5 You can click the Effect Controls panel and choose Edit > Select All. You can also 
Control+click (Windows) or Command+click (Mac OS) multiple effects in the 
Effect Controls panel. Once selected, choose the Save Preset command from the 
menu that appears.

Lesson overview
In this lesson, you’ll learn about the following:
• Working in the Color Correction workspace
• Using vectorscopes and waveforms
• Using color correction effects
• Fixing exposure and color balance problems
• Working with special effects
• Creating a look
This lesson will take approximately 60 minutes.
In this lesson, you’ll learn some key techniques for improving the look 
of your clips. Industry professionals use these techniques every day to 
give television programs and films the “pop” and atmosphere that set 
them apart.

Editing your clips together is just the first part of the 
creative process. Now it’s time to work with color.

lesson 14 
Color Correction and Grading
Getting started
It’s time to switch gears again. Until now you’ve been organizing your clips, build-
ing sequences, and applying special effects. All of these skills come together when 
working with color correction.
To get the most from the Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 color correction tools, you’ll 
need to think in terms of color composition: Consider the way your eyes register 
color and light; the way cameras record it; and the way your computer screen, a 
television screen, a video projector, or a cinema screen displays it.
Adobe Premiere Pro has multiple color correction tools and makes it easy to create 
your own presets. In this lesson, you’ll begin by learning some fundamental color 
correction skills and then meet some of the most popular color correction special 
effects, before using them to deal with some common color correction challenges.
1 Open Lesson 14.prproj in the Lesson 14 folder.  If Adobe Premiere Pro can’t 
locate the lesson file, refer to “Relink the lesson files” in the Getting Started 
section at the start of this book for two ways to search for and relink the file.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Color Correction to switch to the Color 
Correction workspace.
3 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Current Workspace.
4 Click Yes in the Reset Workspace dialog.
Color-oriented workflow
Now that you’ve switched to a new workspace, it’s a good time to switch to a dif-
ferent brain—or at least, a different kind of thinking. With your clips in place, it’s 
time to look at them less in terms of the action and more in terms of whether they 
fit together—whether they look like they were shot at the same time, in the same 
place, and with the same camera.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 329
There are two main phases to working with color:
1 Make sure your clips have matching colors, brightness, and contrast.
2 Give everything a look—a particular tonality or color tint.
You’ll use the same tools to achieve both of these goals, but it’s common to 
approach them in this order, separately. If two clips from the same scene don’t 
have matching colors, it creates a jarring continuity problem.
the Color Correction workspace
Like the other specialized workspaces, the Color Correction workspace mainly 
just repositions and resizes multiple panels to make a convenient layout for the 
task at hand.
There are a couple of noteworthy changes:
• There’s a new Reference Monitor (covered shortly).
• The Effect Controls panel takes a large part of the screen.
You’ll notice the Timeline panel shrinks to accommodate the new Reference 
Monitor and the larger Effect Controls panel. This is fine because, by the time you 
get to working on color correction, you won’t be editing your clips and should not 
need to see lots of clips at once.

lesson 14 
Color Correction and Grading
Video scope essentials
You might have wondered  
why the Adobe Premiere 
Pro interface is so gray. 
There’s a very good reason: 
Vision is highly subjective. 
In fact, it’s also highly 
relative. If you see two 
colors next to each other, 
the way you see one is 
changed by the presence 
of the other. To prevent 
the Adobe Premiere Pro 
interface from influencing 
the way you perceive colors in your sequence, Adobe has made the interface almost 
entirely gray. If you’ve ever seen a professional color grading suite—where artists 
provide the finishing touches films and television programs—you’ve probably 
noticed the entire room is gray! Grading artists sometimes have a large gray piece 
of card, or a section of a wall, that they can look at for a few moments to “reset” 
their vision before checking a shot.
The combination of your subjective vision and the variation that can occur in the 
way computer monitors and television monitors display color and brightness create 
a need for an objective measurement.
Video scopes provide just that. And they’re used throughout the media industry; 
learn them once, and you’ll be able to use them everywhere.
1 If it’s not open already, open the Double Identity sequence from the 
sequences bin.
2 Position the Timeline playhead so that it is over the first clip in the sequence, 
3D_SER1.
You should see the lady walking in the street, in your Program Monitor, along 
with a second display of the same clip in the Reference Monitor.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 331
the reference monitor
The Reference Monitor looks and behaves very much like the Source and Program 
Monitors. It displays the contents of the current sequence in much the same way 
that the Program Monitor does. The main difference is that there are no editing 
controls.
You can’t add an In point or an Out point, for example. Instead, there are Timeline 
navigation controls and a Gang to Program Monitor button.
Gang to   
Program Monitor
Previous 
Edit
Step 
Back
Step 
Forward
Next 
Edit
When the Gang to Program Monitor button is selected, the Reference Monitor 
moves in sync with the Timeline and Program Monitor. When the button is off, you 
can move the Reference Monitor playhead independently.
The Gang to Program Monitor option is very useful, because the Reference 
Monitor can display the vectorscope or various waveforms in the same way that the 
Source and Program Monitors can. When you group the Reference Monitor and 
use one of the scopes, you get dynamically updated objective information about 
the clips in your sequence at the same time as watching regular playback in the 
Program Monitor.
Because you can turn off ganging, you can also use the Reference Monitor to com-
pare shots in a sequence, and you can always use the Source Monitor to compare 
with shots in the bin, of course.

lesson 14 
Color Correction and Grading
YC waveform
To work with color in Adobe Premiere Pro, you’ll also need to get familiar with the 
YC waveform. Click the Settings button menu in the Reference Monitor and set it 
to YC Waveform.
As you play your sequence or scrub the time ruler by clicking and dragging with 
the mouse, the YC waveform updates to show analysis of the current frame.
If you’re new to waveforms, they can look a little strange, but they’re actually very 
simple. They show you the brightness and color intensity of your images.
Every pixel in the current frame is displayed in the waveform. The brighter the 
pixel, the higher it appears. The pixels have their correct horizontal position—that 
is, a pixel halfway across the screen will be displayed halfway across the wave-
form—but the vertical position is not based on the image.
Instead, the vertical position indicates brightness or color intensity; both the bright-
ness and color intensity waveforms are displayed together, using different colors.
• 0, at the bottom of the scale, represents no luminance at all and/or no color 
intensity.
• 100, at the top of the scale, represents a pixel that is fully bright. On the RGB 
(red, green, and blue) scale, this value would be 255.
• If you’re working on an NTSC sequence, the waveform will automatically 
use the IRE scale. If you’re working on a PAL sequence, the waveform will 
automatically use the Millivolts scale, where 0 is actually 0.3 volts.
This all might sound rather technical, but in practice it’s pretty straightforward. 
There’s a visible baseline that represents “no brightness” and a top level that rep-
resents “fully bright.” The numbers on the edge of the graph might change, but the 
use is essentially the same.
YC stands for luminance (brightness) and chrominance (color).
The letter C, for chrominance, makes simple sense, but the letter y, for luminance, 
might take a little explaining. It comes from a way of measuring color informa-
tion that uses an x-, y-, and z-axis, where y represents the luminance. The idea was 
originally to create a simple system for recording color, and the use of y to repre-
sent brightness, or luminance, stuck.
It’s not too important which letter you use, as long as you know what it is for!

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 333
The controls along the top of the YC waveform display give you some easy choices:
• Intensity: This simply changes the brightness of the display in the waveform.
• Setup (7.5 IRE): This applies only to some cases of analog, standard-definition 
(SD) video, where the 0 point is actually 7.5, instead of 0. Selecting this 
checkbox has no significant effect on the way the waveform display works. It 
simply moves the 0 point up to 7.5.
• Chroma: This control turns off and on the display of color information in the 
waveform display.
We’re not working with analog SD video, so turn off the Setup (7.5 IRE) option. 
We’re also just going to work with the luminance for now, so turn off the Chroma 
option too.
Now you should see a simpler display that looks like the one shown here.

334 
lesson 14 
Color Correction and Grading
You should be able to see the parts of the picture where the smoky background of 
the image is displayed, toward the left and right (with some ridges where there is a 
pattern in the background). You should also be able to see a darker section, in the 
middle, where the lady is. If you play the sequence, you’ll see the waveform display 
update.
The waveform display is extremely useful for showing how much contrast you have 
in your images and for checking whether you are working on video that has “legal” 
levels—that is, the minimum and a maximum brightness or color saturation per-
mitted by a broadcaster. Broadcasters adopt their own standards for legal levels, so 
you will need to find out for each case where your work will be broadcast.
You can see right away that we do not have great contrast in this shot. There are 
some strong shadows but very few highlights—pixels in the upper part of the wave-
form display.
Vectorscope
While the YC waveform display shows luminance in terms of the vertical posi-
tion of pixels displayed, with brighter pixels displayed at the top and darker pixels 
displayed at the bottom, the vectorscope shows only color.
E Tip: It can 
sometimes seem as if 
the waveform display 
is showing an image. 
Remember, the vertical 
position of the pixels in 
your images is not used 
in a waveform display.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 335
Click the Reference Monitor Settings button menu, and choose Vectorscope. 
Open the sequence Vegas Night in the Sequences bin. There’s just one clip in this 
sequence.
Pixels in the image are displayed in the vectorscope. If a pixel appears in the center 
of the circle, it has no color saturation. The closer to the edge of the circle, the more 
color a pixel has.
If you look closely at the vectorscope, you’ll see a series of markings indicating 
primary and secondary colors.
•
R = Red
•
G = Green
•
B = Blue
•
YL = Yellow
•
CY = Cyan
•
MG = Magenta
about primary and  
secondary colors
Red, green, and blue are primary colors. It is common for display systems, includ-
ing television screens and your computer monitor, to combine these three colors in 
varying relative amounts to produce all of the colors you see.
There is a beautiful symmetry to the way a standard color wheel works, and a color 
wheel is essentially what the vectorscope displays.
Any two primary colors will combine to produce a secondary color. Secondary 
colors are the opposite of the remaining primary color.
For example, red and green combine to produce yellow, which is the opposite 
of blue.
The closer a pixel is to one of these colors, the more of that color it has. While the 
waveform display gives an indication of where a pixel is in the picture, thanks to the 
horizontal position, there is no position information in the vectorscope.

336 
lesson 14 
Color Correction and Grading
It’s clear enough to see by eye what is happening in this shot of Las Vegas. There’s 
a lot of yellowy red and some vivid green. Notice there is also some cyan at the top 
left of the image. This is indicated by the streak of peaks reaching out toward the 
CY marking.
The vectorscope is helpful because it gives you objective information about the col-
ors in your sequence. If there is a color cast, perhaps because the camera was not 
calibrated properly, it’s often obvious in the vectorscope display. You can simply use 
one of the Adobe Premiere Pro color correction effects to reduce the amount of the 
unwanted color or add more of the opposite color.
Some of the controls for color correction special effects, such as Fast Color 
Corrector, have the same color wheel design as the vectorscope, so it’s easy to see 
what you need to do.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 337
additive and subtractive color
Computer screens and televisions use additive color, which means the colors  
are created by generating light in different colors and combining them to pro-
duce a precise mix. You produce white by combining equal amounts of red, green, 
and blue.
When you draw with color on paper, it is usually white paper, so it begins with a 
full spectrum of colors. You subtract from the white of the paper by adding pig-
ment. The pigment prevents parts of the light reflecting on the paper. This is called 
subtractive color.
When using additive color, primary colors are used. When using subtractive color, 
secondary colors are used. In a sense, they are flip sides of the same color theory.
rGB Parade
Use the Reference Monitor’s Settings button menu to switch to the RGB parade.
The RGB parade provides a waveform-style display, the same as the YC waveform. 
The difference is that the red, green, and blue levels are displayed separately. To fit 
all three colors in, each image is squeezed horizontally to one third of the width of 
the display.
You’ll notice the three parts of the RGB parade have similar patterns in them, par-
ticularly where there are white or gray pixels, because these parts will have equal 
amounts of red, green, and blue. The RGB parade is one of the most frequently 
used tools in color correction because it clearly shows the relationship between the 
primary color channels.

338 
lesson 14 
Color Correction and Grading
Y'CbCr Parade
Use the Reference Monitor’s Settings button menu to switch to the Y'CbCr parade.
Though computer monitors use a “color additive” system, using RGB to indicate 
color levels, most cameras actually record using a “color difference” system, often 
expressed as Y'CbCr (for digital signals), signifying the following:
•
Y': Luminance
•
Cb: Chroma-blue
•
Cr: Chroma-red
The Y' information forms a stand-alone black-and-white image, with Cb and Cr 
determining the hue and saturation color information for each pixel. The hue and 
saturation are defined by values along two lines—referred to as vectors—across the 
standard color wheel, which you’ll find marked on your vectorscope.
The vertical vector is labeled as “R-Y” (the analog version of the digital Cr), and the 
horizontal vector is labeled “B-Y” (the analog equivalent to Cb).
Every color available can be expressed by using these two vectors. You can see how 
coordinates can be generated through this sort of “longitude and latitude.”
Though the challenges associated with transmitting video have changed with the 
advent of digital video, the color difference system persists, partly because it is a 
more efficient way to compress, store, and transmit video signals.
The Y'CbCr parade displays three types of information, in much the way that the 
RGB parade does, by compressing the images horizontally to show all three at once. 
In this case, the first waveform is the luminance (the same as the regular waveform 
display), the second waveform corresponds to the vectorscope’s B-Y axis; and the 
third waveform corresponds to the vectorscope’s R-Y axis.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 339
Combination views
There are also two combination views that give you several of the display modes 
at once. These are particularly useful if you have plenty of space on your computer 
screen to enlarge the Reference Monitor.
They allow you to see lots of views at once.
• Vect/YC Wave/YCbCr Parade: Shows a combination view of the vectorscope, 
YC waveform, and YCbCr parade
• Vect/YC Wave/RGB Parade: Shows a combination view of the vectorscope, YC 
waveform, and RGB parade

lesson 14 
Color Correction and Grading
an overview of color-oriented effects
The color correction special effects are added, modified, and removed in the same 
way as all of the other effects in Adobe Premiere Pro. Just as with the other effects, 
you can use keyframes to modify the color correction effect settings over time.
There are many ways to work with color and light in Adobe Premiere Pro. Here are 
a few effects you may want to try first.
Coloring effects
There are several effects to adjust existing colors. The following two are for creating 
a black-and-white image and applying a tint and for simply turning a color clip into 
a black-and-white one.
tint
Use the eyedroppers or color pickers to reduce any image to just two colors. 
Whatever you map to black-and-white replaces any other colors in the image.
Black-and-White
Convert any image to simple black-and-white. This is useful when combined with 
other effects that can add color.
E Tip: You can always 
find an effect using the 
search box at the top of 
the Effects panel. Often, 
the best way to learn 
how to use an effect 
is to apply it to a clip 
with a good range of 
colors, highlights, and 
shadows and then to 
adjust all the settings 
and watch the result.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 341
Color removal or replacement
These effects allow you to make changes to colors selectively, rather than modifying 
the entire image.
Leave Color
Use the eyedropper or  
color pickers to select a 
color you would like to 
keep. Adjust the Amount to 
Decolor setting to turn the 
saturation down on every 
other color.
Use the Tolerance and Edge 
Software controls to pro-
duce a more subtle effect.
Change to Color
Use the eyedroppers or  
color pickers to select a 
color you want to change 
and the color you’d like it 
to become.
Use the Change menu to 
select the method you’d like 
the effect to use to apply the 
adjustment.
Change Color
Similar to the Change to  
Color effect, this effect gives 
subtle controls to adjust one 
color to another. Rather 
than matching another 
color, you change the hue 
and finesse the selection 
using the Tolerance and 
Softness controls.

342 
lesson 14 
Color Correction and Grading
Color Correction
These effects include a range of controls to adjust the overall look of your video or 
to make precise selections to adjust individual colors or color ranges.
fast Color Corrector
As the name suggests, Fast Color Corrector 
is a quick and easy-to-use effect for adjusting 
the colors and luminance levels in your clips. 
You’ll be using this effect to adjust the white 
balance for a shot later in this lesson.
three-Way Color Corrector
Very similar to Fast Color Corrector, this 
effect has separate controls for adjust-
ing color for the shadows, midtones, and 
highlights of your clips. This effect also has 
powerful secondary color correction controls 
that allow you to selectively color-correct 
pixels that have a specific color, brightness, or 
amount of color saturation.
You’ll use this effect to work on a clip later in 
this lesson.
rGB Curves
The RGB Curves effect is a simple graph con-
trol that gives natural-looking, subtle results. 
The horizontal axis of each graph represents 
the original clip, with shadows on the left and 
highlights on the right. The vertical axis repre-
sents the output from the effect, with shadows 
at the bottom and highlights at the top.
A straight line from the bottom-left corner to 
the top-right corner means no change. Drag 
the line to reshape it, changing the relation-
ship between the original clip levels and the 
resulting output levels.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 343
We’ll be using another form of curve effect to work on exposure problems with 
clips later.
rGB Color Corrector
This color correction effect provides  
precise controls for adjusting an image. 
You can make changes to the overall 
image or make selective adjustments to 
the red, green, and blue parts of the 
image.
• Gamma: Adjusts the midtones.
• Pedestal: Adjusts the black point. 
Raising the pedestal makes the 
shadows appear brighter, making the 
image seem a bit “foggy” and lacking definition; lowering the pedestal makes 
the shadows darker and can be adjusted to the point of the loss of detail in the 
shadows altogether, or “crushing” the blacks.
• Gain: Adjusts the highlights, or white point.
You can achieve interesting results by lowering the pedestal and increasing the gain, 
giving you strong shadows and bright highlights, and thus increasing the contrast.
technical color effects
As well as creative effects, the color correction repertoire in Adobe Premiere Pro 
includes effects used for professional video production.
Video Limiter
Video Limiter gives you precise control  
over the maximum and minimum levels 
for your video. It is designed to give 
natural results. For example, rather than 
simply chopping off parts of the image 
that are too bright, the image is com-
pressed to bring it into the legal range. Be 
sure to examine the parameters of the 
Video Limiter effect and determine which 
combination of settings work with any 
given shot.

344 
lesson 14 
Color Correction and Grading
Broadcast Colors
The Broadcast Colors  
effect gives you a 
simpler interface for 
ensuring your levels are 
legal. Once you know 
your accepted maximum signal, do the following:
1 Choose between NTSC and PAL video.
2 Choose whether you’d like the effect to reduce luminance or reduce saturation 
for pixels that go beyond the limit you set.
3 Specify a maximum signal amplitude, using the IRE scale.
The Broadcast Colors effect will adjust all pixels that fall outside the maximum you 
set. You can use the Key Out Safe and Key Out Unsafe options to display which 
pixels will be affected by the Broadcast Colors effect.
fixing exposure problems
Let’s look at three clips that have exposure issues and use some of the Color 
Correction effects to address them.
1 Open the sequence Exposure in the Sequences bin. This sequence has three 
clips.
2 Set the Reference Monitor to show the YC waveform. Make sure Chroma and 
Setup (7.5 IRE) are deselected.
The first clip is the lady walking. The environment is smoky. If you position the 
Timeline playhead over the first clip, and look at the waveform, you can see 
there’s not much contrast in the shot.
100 IRE means fully exposed, and 0 IRE means not exposed at all. None of the 
image comes close to these levels. Your eye quickly adjusts to the image, and it’ll 
soon look fine. Let’s see whether we can bring it to life a little.
3 Add the Luma Curve effect to the clip.
4 Click the Luma Waveform control in the Effect  
Controls panel to create a control point and 
reshape the line to make a subtle S shape. Use 
the following example as a guide. You’ll get the 
best perceived results if you have a frame from 
a later part of the clip on-screen. Around 
00:00:06:20 there’s a section of sharp focus.
E Tip: If you increase 
the size of Effect 
Controls panel, the 
Luma Waveform control 
will get bigger, making 
it easier to apply subtle 
adjustments.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 345
5 Your eye is likely to adjust very quickly to the new image. Try toggling the Luma 
Curve effect off and on to compare the image before and after.
The subtle adjustment you made adds more depth to the image, giving it stronger 
highlights and shadows. As you toggle the effect off and on, you’ll see the waveform 
monitor changing. We still don’t have bright highlights in the image, but that’s fine 
because its natural colors are mainly midtones.
underexposed images
Move the Timeline playhead to the second clip in the sequence, Cowboy Dark. 
When you first look at this clip, it might look OK. There’s a shadowy area to the 
left, but there’s a reasonable amount of detail in the lighter area to the right.
Now take a look at the waveform.  
The bottom of the waveform is 
crushed to 0. Any pixels below 0 are 
effectively lost. There is no detail or 
texture in that area because all the 
pixels are completely black.
The problem with crushed blacks 
like this is that increasing the bright-
ness will simply change the strong 
shadows into gray, and no detail will 
emerge.
1 Add the Brightness & Contrast effect to the clip.
2 Use the Brightness control in the Effect Controls panel to increase the 
brightness. Rather than clicking the number and typing a new number, click and 
drag to the right so you can see the change happening incrementally.
As you drag, notice that the whole waveform moves up. This is fine for bringing 
out the highlights in the image, but the shadows remain a flat line. You’re simply 
changing the black shadows to gray. If you drag the Brightness control all the 
way to 100, you’ll see just how flat the image still is.
3 Remove the Brightness & Contrast effect.
4 Try to make an adjustment using the Luma  
Curve effect or the RGB Curves effect. Here’s 
an example of a Luma Curve effect that would 
improve the image.
E Tip: You can remove a control point from the curve control 
by dragging it completely out of the graph.

346 
lesson 14 
Color Correction and Grading
overexposed images
Move the Timeline playhead to the third clip in the sequence. This is the same shot, 
but this time it is overexposed. Notice, later in the shot, the rim of the hat is burned 
out. Just as with the crushed blacks in the previous example, there is no detail in 
burned-out whites. This means lowering the brightness will simply change the rim 
of the hat from white to gray, and no detail will emerge.
Notice the shadows don’t reach 0 in this shot. The lack of properly dark shadows 
has a flattening effect on the image.
Try using one of the curves effects to improve the contrast range. Here’s an 
example that might work.
When is color correction right?
Making adjustments to images is a highly subjective approach. Though there 
are precise standards for image formats and broadcast technologies, whether an 
image should be light, dark, blue tinted, or green is ultimately a subjective choice. 
The reference tools, such as the waveform display, are a helpful guide, but only you 
can decide when the picture looks right.
If you’re producing video for display on televisions, it is vital that you have a 
television screen connected to your Adobe Premiere Pro editing system to view 
your content. Television screens display color in dramatically different ways to 
computer monitors.
The difference is quite similar to the difference between looking at colors in photos 
on your computer monitor and then seeing the colors as they are produced by 
your printer.

fixing color balance
Your eyes adjust to compensate for changes in the color of light around you auto-
matically. It’s an extraordinary ability that allows you to see white as white, even if 
objectively it’s orange, for example, because it’s lit by tungsten light.
Camera operators can automatically adjust their white balance to compensate for 
different lighting in the way that your eyes do. With the right calibration, white 
objects look white, whether you are recording indoors, under more orange tung-
sten light, or outdoors in more blue daylight.
Sometimes automatic white balance is a little bit hit or miss, so professional shoot-
ers often prefer to manually set the white balance. If the white balance is set wrong, 
you can end up with some interesting results. The most common reason for a color 
balance problem in a clip is that the camera was not calibrated properly.
Basic white balance (fast Color Corrector)
Open the sequence Color in the Sequences  
bin. If you set the Timeline playhead over 
the first shot in this sequence, you can see 
someone using a clever technique to find out what was written on a pad of paper. 
Something is not quite right, though—that paper isn’t white, and it should be.
Apply the Fast Color Corrector effect to the clip. This effect shares many controls 
with another effect, Three-Way Color Corrector. We’ll look over the controls for 
that effect next. In the meantime, let’s find out why this effect is described as Fast.
1 Make sure the paper clip is selected in the sequence so the Effect Controls panel 
will display the Fast Color Corrector effect controls.
2 Select the White Balance eyedropper in the Effect Controls panel.
3 Click a part of the paper pad that should be white. Be careful to avoid the gray 
area with the pencil marks or the colored lines.
The White Balance control tells the Fast Color Corrector effect what should be 
white. By default, you’ll notice the color swatch is pure white. When you select 
a different color with the eyedropper, the Fast Color Corrector effect adjusts 
all colors in the image by the difference between pure white and the color you 
selected.

348 
lesson 14 
Color Correction and Grading
In this example, you selected a creamy orange color—the result of the lighting on 
the scene. The Fast Color Corrector adjusts all colors in the scene toward blue.
You can see exactly what the effect is doing by looking at the color wheel, located 
just below the White Balance control. Like the vectorscope, the color wheel rep-
resents colors with increasing intensity toward the edge of the circle. Rather than 
measuring color, the color wheel in the Fast Color Corrector applies an adjustment. 
The more the small circle at the center of the wheel is moved toward the edge, the 
more adjustment is applied.
You can see, in this example, that Adobe Premiere Pro has applied a small adjust-
ment toward cyan blue. In this way, using the White Balance control and the color 
wheel can help you to learn about color correction and the adjustments needed to 
balance whites.
Primary color correction
The words primary and secondary have more than one meaning. Historically, the 
place where “color timing” was applied was during the film transfer process at the 
telecine. A primary correction involved adjusting the relationship between the 
primary colors (red, green, and blue) in the printer lights. A secondary correction
involved focusing on certain color ranges within an image, often through adding 
adjustments of secondary colors. So, while primary and secondary define types of 
colors on a color wheel, you can also use these terms to describe stages in the color 
correction workflow.
Broadly speaking, primary color correction still involves overall color correction 
adjustments to the whole image. These days, you can also employ adjustments 
through secondary colors and still consider it “primary” because the entire image is 
affected, and it’s typically most effective to make these adjustments first.
Because secondary color correction (so designated because it is typically done after 
primary adjustments) usually involves more subtle fine-tuning, the name has come 
to mean applying adjustments to selected pixels within an image.
E Tip: The difference 
made with color 
correction can be quite 
subtle. Toggle the effect 
off and on in the Effect 
Controls panel to see 
a before-and-after 
comparison.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 349
Let’s look at primary color correction first. The Three-Way Color Corrector effect 
works in a very similar way to the Fast Color Corrector effect, but with more 
advanced controls. The effect was updated for Adobe Premiere Pro CS6. It is a 
very powerful color correction tool that, combined with the Reference Monitor 
and the new Adjustment Layer feature, helps you achieve professional color 
correction results.
Before we start working on a clip, let’s run  
through the main controls:
• Output: Use this menu to view your clip in 
color or black-and-white. Viewing in black-
and-white is useful for identifying contrast.
• Show Split View: Turn on Show Split View 
to see a “before” and “after” version of your 
clip, with one half changed by the effect and 
the other half unaffected. You can choose a 
horizontal or vertical layout and change the 
percentage of the split.
• Shadows Balance, Midtones Balance, 
Highlights Balance: Each color wheel 
allows you to make subtle adjustments to 
the colors in your clip. If you select the 
Master checkbox, adjustments you make 
will apply to the whole clip, not just the 
shadows, midtones, or highlights. Note 
that the adjustments you make with the Master mode on are independent of 
adjustments you make to the individual parts of the clip.
• Input Levels: Use the slider controls to change the Shadow, Midtone, and 
Highlight levels for this clip.
• Output Levels: Use the slider controls to adjust the minimum brightness and 
maximum brightness for the clip. The Input Levels relate directly to this control, 
so, for example, if you set your Input Shadow level to 20, and your Output 
Shadow level to 0, anything in your clip that has a pixel brightness of 20 or less 
will be lowered to 0.

350 
lesson 14 
Color Correction and Grading
about levels
Eight-bit video—which describes all SD broadcast video—is measured on a 
brightness scale from 0 to 255. When you adjust Input Levels or Output Levels, you 
change the relationship between the displayed levels and the original clip levels.
For example, if you set the Output white to 255, Adobe Premiere Pro will use the 
maximum brightness range for the video. If you set the Input white to 200, Adobe 
Premiere Pro will stretch the original clip brightness so that 200 becomes 255. The 
result is that your highlights will get brighter, and pixel values originally greater than 
200 will clip, or become flat white, losing any detail.
The Input levels have three controls: Shadows, Midtones, and Highlights. By chang-
ing these levels, you change the relationship between the original clip levels and 
the way those levels are displayed during playback.
• Tonal Range Definition: Use the sliders to define the range of pixels affected 
by the Shadows, Midtones, and Highlights controls. For example, if you drag 
the highlight slider left, you’ll increase the amount of pixels adjusted when 
using Highlights controls. The triangle-shaped slider allows you to define the 
extent of a softening between the levels you are adjusting. Click the Tonal Range 
Definition disclosure triangle to get access to individual controls and the Show 
Tonal Range checkbox. If you check the box, Adobe Premiere Pro displays your 
image in just three gray tones, so you can identify which parts of your picture 
will be affected when you make adjustments. Black pixels are shadows, gray 
pixels are midtones, and white pixels are highlights.
• Saturation: Use this to adjust the amount of color in the clip. You have a Master 
control that will adjust the overall clip and separate controls for the Shadows, 
Midtones, and Highlights.
• Secondary Color Correction: This advanced color correction feature allows 
you to define specific pixels you would like to adjust, based on their color or 
brightness. The Show Mask option shows you which pixels you have selected 
to apply the color correction adjustment to. Using this feature, you could, for 
example, selectively adjust pixels with a particular shade of green.
• Auto Levels: Use this feature to automatically adjust the Input levels. You can 
click the Auto buttons or use eyedroppers. To use the eyedroppers, select one 
(Black, Gray, or White), and then click a reciprocal part of the picture. For 
example, select the White Level eyedropper, and then click the brightest part 
of the picture. Adobe Premiere Pro updates the Levels controls based on the 
selections you make.
• Shadows, Midtones, Highlights, Master: These controls allow you to make 
the same adjustments as the Shadows, Midtones, Highlights, and Master color 

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 351
balance controls, but with more precision. When you change one, the other 
updates automatically.
• Master Levels: These controls allow you to make the same adjustments as the 
Input Levels and Output Levels controls, but with more precision. When you 
change one, the other updates automatically.
The second clip in the Color sequence shows a scene in an office. This clip has a 
range of shadows, midtones, and highlights. It also has a range of colors. It looks 
pretty flat and seems to have a color cast. Taking a look in the vectorscope confirms 
it: There’s a blue tint.
1 To begin, apply the Three-Way Color Corrector effect to the clip and switch to 
the Effect Controls panel.
Now let’s fix the shot.
2 Expand the Auto Levels controls.
3 Click the Auto Black Level, Auto Contrast, and Auto White Level buttons in 
turn. Notice the Input Levels controls adjust to reflect the new levels.
Adobe Premiere Pro has identified the darkest pixels for the Black level and the 
brightest pixels for the White Level and has balanced them for the Gray level.
4 Use the eyedropper controls for the Shadows, Midtones, and Highlights Color 
Balance controls to select black, gray, and white items in the shot. This will 
correct the color cast.
5 Take a look at the vectorscope. If it looks like the shot still has an overall color 
cast, switch on the Master mode for the Color Balance controls, and drag any of 
the wheels away from the color cast shown in the vectorscope.
Once you have applied Color Balance adjustments, you make want to tweak the 
Input levels to fine-tune the result.
The Three-Way Color Corrector effect gives you very precise control over your 
clips. If you prefer to make broader adjustments, you can always use the Fast Color 
Corrector.
secondary color correction
As described earlier, secondary color correction involves applying color correction 
adjustments to selected pixels, rather than the whole image. The adjustments you 
make are the same as those you might make with the Fast Color Corrector effect or 
Three-Way Color Corrector effect; the only difference is the limited selection.
E Tip: If you’d like to 
try using the eyedrop-
per controls instead, 
you might find it help-
ful to change the zoom 
setting for the Program 
Monitor to 100%, mak-
ing it easier to click the 
pixels you want.

352 
lesson 14 
Color Correction and Grading
Let’s try this with the office shot. In the background, there’s a window showing a 
green neon sign outside. Let’s warm up that part of the shot.
1 Continue to work with the second shot in the Color sequence. Apply another 
instance of the Three-Way Color Corrector effect to the clip.
2 It can get fairly confusing working with the same effect twice. Click the 
disclosure triangle (
) for the first instance of the Three-Way Color 
Corrector effect in the Effect Controls panel to collapse the settings and hide 
them from view.
3 Expand the Secondary Color Correction controls for the new instance of 
the Three-Way Color Corrector effect. Click the first of the three center 
eyedroppers to select it.
4 Use the eyedropper to select the green in  
the window.
5 Turn on the Show Mask option. In this view, Adobe Premiere Pro shows 
selected pixels in white and unselected pixels in black. Clearly, we need to pick 
a broader selection.
6 Use the second center eyedropper to select another part of the window. This 
eyedropper adds to the selection, while the third eyedropper removes from the 
selection. As soon as you select an eyedropper, the image returns to its original 
state for you to make your selection.
7 Continue using the eyedroppers to make selections until the Mask view gives 
a pretty clean white area where the window is in the picture.
8 While clicking with the eyedroppers, you’ve been applying Hue, Saturation, and 
Luma selections. Expand these controls now. You can see manual controls to set 
these levels, including Start and End Softness, which blend between the selected 
and unselected pixels. Try adjusting these a little to smooth the edges of the 
mark. When you’re happy with the result, turn off the Show Mask option.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 353
9 You have now selected only a portion of the image to be adjusted. At the top of 
the Three-Way Color Corrector controls, turn on the Master option. Now use 
the outer edge of the Color Balance wheels as a hue control. Drag any of the 
wheel edges around to transform the green color. See whether you can turn it 
into a warmer color.
Using secondary color correction, only the green colors found in the window are changed.
special color effects
Several special effects give you great creative control over the colors in your clips. 
Others have important functional controls to make sure your content meets the 
stringent requirements for broadcast television.
Here are a few effects of note.
the Leave Color effect
Use this effect to select one color you would like to remain in color, while every 
other color is removed.
Use the Color to Leave eyedropper to choose the color you want to leave unaf-
fected. Use the Amount to Decolor control to specify how much color to remove. 
The Tolerance and Edge Softness controls finesse your selection, while the Match 
E Tip: It is quite likely 
that your selection 
includes part of the 
desk lamp, because 
the colors are the same 
as the portion of the 
image you’re fixing. This 
is something that you 
can avoid by using a 
second copy of the clip 
and a Garbage Matte 
effect. For more infor-
mation about garbage 
mattes, see Lesson 15,

Colors menu lets you choose to select the color based on the Hue setting or the 
RGB levels.
the Change to Color effect
Use this effect to select one color you would like to change and a second color you 
would like it to match.
Use the From eyedropper to select a color you would like to change in the scene; 
then use either the To eyedropper or the To color picker to select the color you 
would like it to become.
Here is a before-and-after example of this effect.

Broadcast legalization
When video is broadcast, there are specific limits that are permitted for maximum 
luminance, minimum luminance, and color saturation. Although it’s possible to 
confine your video levels to the limits permitted using manual controls, it’s easy to 
mix parts of your sequence that need adjustment.
The Video Limiter effect automatically limits the levels of clips to ensure they meet 
the standards you set.
You’ll need to check the limits applied by your broadcaster before setting the Signal 
Min and Signal Max controls with this effect. Then it’s simply a question of choos-
ing the Reduction Axis option—do you want to just limit the luminance, chromi-
nance, or both, or set an overall “smart” limit?
The Reduction Method menu allows you to choose the parts of your video signal 
you would like to adjust. You’ll usually choose Compress All.
E Tip: While it is common to apply the Video Limiter effect to individual clips, you might also 
choose to apply it to the whole sequence by nesting it in another sequence. For more information 
about nesting sequences, see Lesson 8, “Advanced Editing Techniques.”
Creating a look
Once you’ve spent a little time with the color correction effects available in Adobe 
Premiere Pro, you should get a feel for the kinds of changes you can make and the 
impact those changes have on the overall look and feel of your footage.
You can use regular effect presets to create a look for your clips. You can also apply 
an effect to an adjustment layer to give your sequence an overall look.
In the most common color correction scenario, you would do the following:
• Adjust each shot so that it matches the other shots in the same scene. This way, 
there is color continuity.
• Next, apply an overall look to your production.
You can try this now with the Double Identity sequence.
1 Open the Double Identity sequence in the Sequences bin.
2 In the Project panel, click the New Item button menu and choose Adjustment 
Layer. The settings should automatically match the sequence, so just click OK.
3 Drag and drop the new adjustment layer onto the Video 3 track in the sequence.
The default duration for adjustment layers is the same as the duration of still 
images. It’s too short for this sequence.

356 
lesson 14 
Color Correction and Grading
4 Trim the adjustment layer until it stretches from the beginning to the end of the 
sequence.
5 Apply any color correction effect to the adjustment layer, and make any changes 
you would like. Your changes will apply to every clip in the sequence.
P Note: If you use adjustment layers in this way on a sequence that has graphics and titles, you 
may want to ensure the adjustment layer is on a track between the graphics/titles and the video. 
Otherwise, you will adjust the appearance of your titles too.
sending clips to adobe speedGrade
Adobe SpeedGrade is a powerful color correction application included with  
Creative Suite 6 Production Premium and Creative Suite 6 Master Collection.
Adobe Premiere Pro has powerful color correction tools but is primarily an editing 
system. Adobe SpeedGrade is completely devoted to the task of color correction, 
and it provides superior tools for the purpose.
You can share your Adobe Premiere Pro sequence with Adobe SpeedGrade in one 
of two ways.
•
Export your sequence as an EDL that you can import into Adobe SpeedGrade 
by choosing File > Export > EDL.
•
Choose File > Send To Adobe SpeedGrade. Adobe Premiere Pro will create  
an .irpc file, readable by Adobe SpeedGrade, and export your sequence in the 
high-quality DPX format to go with it.

review answers
1 The Reference Monitor shows the contents of the current sequence, just as the 
Program Monitor does. By ganging them together, you can be sure the Reference 
Monitor is displaying the same content, even when you are looking at the vectorscope 
or waveform display.
2 Click the Settings button menu and choose the display type you would like.
3 Uncheck the Chroma box at the top of the YC waveform display.
4 The way we perceive color is highly subjective and relative. Depending on the colors 
you have just seen, you will see new colors differently. The vectorscope display gives 
you an objective reference.
5 You can use effect presets to apply the same color correction adjustments to multiple 
clips or add an adjustment layer and apply the adjustment to that. Any clips on lower 
tracks covered by the adjustment layer will be affected.
6 If your sequence is intended for broadcast television, you will need to ensure you meet 
the stringent requirements for maximum and minimum levels. The broadcaster you 
are working with will be able to tell you their required levels.

Compositing comprises blending, combining, layer-
ing, keying, masking, and cropping, in any number of 
combinations. Anything that combines two images is 
compositing.

360 
lesson 15 
exploring Compositing techniques
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 has powerful tools that enable you to create professional 
combined layers of video in your sequences.
In this lesson, you’ll learn about the key technologies that make compositing work 
and approaches to preparing for compositing, adjusting the opacity of clips, and 
keying greenscreen shots with chromakey and mattes.
Getting started
Until now, you have been mainly working with single, whole-frame images. You 
have created edits where you have transitioned between one image and another or 
edited clips onto upper video tracks to have them appear in front of clips on lower 
video tracks.
In this lesson, you’ll learn about ways to combine those layers of video. You’ll still 
use clips on upper and lower tracks, but now they will become foreground and 
background elements in one blended image.
The blend might come from cropping part of the foreground image or from 
keying—selecting specific colors to become transparent—but, whatever the 
method, the way you edit clips onto a sequence is the same as ever.
You’ll begin by learning about an important concept that explains the way pixels 
are displayed and then try several techniques.

What is an alpha channel?
Visible
Transparent
Partially transparent glow
This title…
…combines with this video.
To produce this composite image, everything begins with cameras selectively 
recording the red, green, and blue parts of the light spectrum as separate color 
channels. Because each channel is monochrome (just one of the three colors), they 
are commonly described as grayscale.
Adobe Premiere Pro uses these three grayscale channels to produce the correspond-
ing primary color channels. They are combined using primary additive color to cre-
ate a complete RGB image. You see the three channels combined as full-color video.
This is not the end of the story! There is a fourth grayscale channel: alpha.
The fourth channel defines no colors at all. Instead, it defines opacity—how visible 
the pixel is. Several different words are used in the world of post-production to 
describe this fourth channel, including visibility, transparency, mixer, and opacity. 
The name is not particularly important. What matters is that you understand that 
you can adjust the opacity of each pixel independently of its color.
Just as you might use color correction to adjust the amount of red in a clip, you can 
use Opacity controls to adjust the amount of alpha transparency.

362 
lesson 15 
exploring Compositing techniques
By default, the alpha channel, or Opacity, of a typical camera footage clip, is at 100 
percent, or fully visible. On the 8-bit video scale, of 0 to 255, this means it will be at 
255. Clips that are animations or text or logo graphics will often have alpha chan-
nels that control what parts of an image are opaque and transparent.
using compositing in your projects
The use of compositing special effects and controls can take your post-production 
work to a whole new level. Compositing means creating new image compositions 
from existing ones. Once you begin working with the compositing effects available 
in Adobe Premiere Pro, you’ll find yourself discovering new ways of filming and 
new ways of structuring your edit to make it easier to blend images together.
It’s the combination of filming techniques and dedicated effects that produces 
the most impactful results when compositing. You can combine simple images of 
environments with complex, interesting patterns to produce extraordinary textured 
moods. Or, you can cut out parts of an image that don’t fit and replace them with 
something else.
Compositing is one of the most creative parts of nonlinear editing with Adobe 
Premiere Pro.
shooting videos with compositing in mind
Much of the most effective compositing work begins when you are planning your 
production. Right at the start, you can begin to think about how you can help 
Adobe Premiere Pro to identify the parts of the image you’d like to be transparent. 
Adobe Premiere Pro has a limited number of ways of identifying which pixels you’d 
like to make transparent. Consider chromakey, for example, the standard special 
effect used to allow weather reporters to appear in front of a map.
The weather reporter is actually standing in front of a greenscreen. Special-effects 
technology uses the green color to identify which pixels should be transparent. 
The video image of the weather reporter is used as the foreground of a composi-
tion, with some visible pixels (the reporter) and some transparent pixels (the green 
background).
Next, it’s just a question of putting the foreground video image in front of another 
background image. In a weather report, it’s a map, but it could just as easily be any 
other video or graphic image.
Planning ahead can make a big difference to the quality of your compositing. For 
that blue or greenscreen to work well, it needs to be a consistent color. It also needs 
to be a color that does not appear anywhere on your subject. Green-colored jew-
elry, for example, might turn transparent when the key effect is applied.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 363
…becomes this.
This…
…combined with this…
If you’re shooting greenscreen footage, the way you film can make a big difference to 
the finished result. Be sure to capture the background with soft light and try to avoid 
spill, where light reflected from the screen bounces onto your subject. If this hap-
pens, you’ll be in danger of keying out, or making transparent, parts of your subject.
essential terminology
For the purposes of this lesson, we’ll be using some terms that might be new to you. 
Let’s run through some important ones:
• Alpha/alpha channel: The fourth channel of information for each pixel. An 
alpha channel defines transparency for an image. It’s a separate grayscale 
channel, and it can be created entirely independently of the content of the image.
• Key/keying: The process of selectively making pixels transparent based on their 
color or brightness. The Chromakey effect uses color to generate transparency 
(that is, to modify the alpha channel), while the LumaKey effect uses brightness.
• Opacity: The word used to describe the overall alpha channel value for clips in 
a sequence in Adobe Premiere Pro. You can adjust the opacity for a clip over 
time using keyframes.
• Blending mode: A technology originally seen in Adobe Photoshop. Rather than 
simply placing foreground images in front of background images, you can select 
one of several different blending modes that cause the foreground to interact 
with the background. You might, for example, choose to view only pixels that 
are brighter than the background or to apply only the color information from 

364 
lesson 15 
exploring Compositing techniques
the foreground clip to the background. Experimentation is often the best way to 
learn about blending modes.
• Greenscreen: The common term that describes the overall process of filming 
a subject in front of a greenscreen and then using a special effect to selectively 
turn green pixels transparent by creating an alpha matte based on the color 
background. The clip is then composited over a background image in a similar 
fashion to a “screen” key that would use basic image luma information—which is 
why it’s called greenscreen. A weather report is a good example of greenscreen.
• Matte: An image, shape, or video clip used to identify a region of your foreground 
image that should be transparent or semitransparent. Adobe Premiere Pro allows 
multiple types of mattes, and you will be working with them in this lesson.
Working with the opacity effect
You can adjust the overall opacity of a clip using keyframes on the Timeline or in 
the Effect Controls panel.
1 Open the sequence Evening Jacket in the Sequences bin. This sequence has a 
foreground image of a man in a jacket, with a background image of a sunset.
2 Make sure the Video 2 track is  
expanded so you can see the 
keyframe rubber band for the 
Jacket foreground clip.
3 Adobe Premiere Pro allows you to use the rubber band to adjust the settings 
and keyframe any effect you apply to a clip. Since the fixed effects include 
Opacity, this option is automatically available. In fact, it is the default option, 
which means the rubber band already represents clip opacity. Try dragging the 
rubber band up and down using the Selection tool.
When you use the Selection tool in this way, the rubber band is moved without 
additional keyframes being added.
In this example, the foreground is set to 50 percent opacity.
E Tip: When adjusting 
the rubber band, 
you can hold the 
Control (Windows) or 
Command (Mac OS) key 
for fine control.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 365
keyframing opacity
Keyframing opacity on the Timeline is almost exactly the same as keyframing vol-
ume. You use the same tools and keyboard shortcuts, and the results are likely to be 
exactly what you expect; the higher the rubber band, the more visible a clip will be.
1 Open the sequence Race in the Sequences bin. This sequence has a title in the 
foreground. It’s common to need to fade titles up and down at different times 
and with different durations. You can do so using a transition effect, just as you 
would add a transition to a video clip. For more control, you can use keyframes 
to adjust the opacity.
2 Make sure the Video 2 track is expanded so you can see the rubber band for the 
foreground title.
3 Hold the Control (Windows) or Command (Mac OS) key, and click the rubber 
band for the title graphic to add four keyframes, two near the beginning and 
two near the end.
4 Adjust the keyframes so they represent a fade-up and a fade-down in the same 
way that you would adjust audio keyframes to adjust volume. Play the sequence 
and watch the results of your keyframing.
You can use the Effect Controls panel to add keyframes to the opacity for a clip. 
Like the audio volume keyframes, the Opacity setting has keyframing turned on by 
default in the Effect Controls panel. This means that if you would like to make a flat 
level adjustment to the overall opacity of a clip, it’s sometimes quicker to do it on 
the Timeline, rather than in the Effect Controls panel.
Combine layers based on a blending mode
Blending modes are special ways for foreground pixels to combine with back-
ground pixels. Each blending mode applies a different calculation to combine the 
foreground RGBA—red, green, blue, and alpha—values with those of the back-
ground. Each pixel is calculated individually in combination with the pixel directly 
behind it.
The default blending mode for all clips is Normal. In this mode, the foreground 
image has a uniform alpha channel value across the entire image. The more opacity 
the foreground image has, the more strongly you will see those pixels in front of the 
pixels in the background.
E Tip: It’s often easier 
to add the keyframe 
markers to the rubber 
band first and then 
drag them to adjust 
them.
E Tip: Once you’ve 
added a keyframe with 
the Control (Windows) 
or Command (Mac OS) 
key, you can release the 
key and start dragging 
with the mouse to set 
the keyframe position.

lesson 15 
exploring Compositing techniques
The best way to find out how blending modes work is to try them.
1 Open the Double Identity sequence in the Sequences bin. This sequence already 
has a title at the end of the edited intro.
2 Select the top-level part of the title, called Title Text, and take a look at the 
Effect Controls panel.
3 In the Effect controls panel, expand the Opacity controls and take a look at the 
Blend Mode option.
4 Right now, the blending mode is set to Normal. Try a few different ones to 
see the results. Each blending mode calculates the relationship between the 
foreground layer pixels and the background pixels differently. See the Adobe 
Premiere Pro Help for a description of the blending modes.
In this example, the foreground has the Lighten blending mode. Only the pixels in the fore-
ground that are lighter than the pixels in the background are visible.
Working with alpha-channel transparencies
Many types of media already will have varying alpha channel levels for pixels. A 
title is an obvious example: Where text exists, pixels have 100 percent opacity, and 
where there is no text, pixels usually have 0 percent opacity. Elements such as drop 
shadows behind text typically have a value somewhere in between. Keeping some 
transparency in a drop shadow helps it look a bit more realistic.
Adobe Premiere Pro sees pixels with higher values in the alpha channel as being 
more visible. This is the most common way to interpret alpha channels, but 
occasionally you might come across media that is configured in the opposite way. 

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 367
You will immediately recognize the problem because your foreground image will 
become a cut-out in an otherwise black image. This is easy to address because just 
as Adobe Premiere Pro can interpret the audio channels on a clip, it is also possible 
to choose the correct interpretation of existing alpha channel information.
You can see the results very easily using the title in the Double Identity sequence.
1 Set the Timeline playhead so you can see the title in the Program Monitor.
2 Select the foreground title text and use the Effect Controls panel to set the 
blending mode to Normal.
3 Locate the Title Text clip in the Graphics bin. Right-click the clip and choose 
Modify > Interpret Footage. At the bottom of the panel, you’ll find the Alpha 
Channel interpretation options.
4 Try each of the options, and observe the results in the Program Monitor. You 
will need to click OK before the display will update.
The options are as follows:
• Ignore Alpha Channel: Treats all pixels as having 100 percent alpha. This can 
be useful if you do not intend to use a background layer in your sequence.
• Invert Alpha Channel: Reverses the alpha channel for every pixel in the clip. 
This means pixels that were fully opaque will become fully transparent, and 
pixels that were transparent will become opaque.

lesson 15 
exploring Compositing techniques
Color keying a greenscreen shot
When you change the opacity level of a clip using the rubber band or the Effect 
Controls panel, you adjust the alpha for every pixel in the image by the same 
amount. There are also ways to selectively adjust the alpha for pixels, based on their 
position on the screen, their brightness, or their color.
Chromakey effects adjust the opacity for a range of pixels based on their specific 
luminance, hue, and saturation values. The principle is quite simple: You select a 
color, or range of colors, and the more similar a pixel is to the color selection, the 
more transparent it becomes. The more closely a pixel color matches the selection, 
the more its alpha channel value is lowered, until it becomes fully transparent.
Open the sequence Keying Double Identity in the Sequences bin.
This is similar to the other Double Identity sequence, but the shot where the lady 
gets into the car has been replaced by a greenscreen version. This is a better version 
because it has audio, but the green parts of the image need to be removed.
The foreground video is on the Video 2 track. On the Video 1 track there’s a still 
image background that has already been loosely keyframed to follow the camera 
movements of the foreground image.
All that remains is to remove the green pixels.
Preprocessing the footage
In a perfect world, every greenscreen clip you work with would have a flawless 
green background and nice, clean edges on your foreground elements. In reality, 
there are lots of reasons why you might be faced with less than perfect material.
Of course, there’s always the potential problems caused by poor lighting when the 
video is created. However, there’s a further problem caused by the way many video 
cameras store image information.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 369
Because your eyes do not register color with as much acuity as they do brightness 
information, it is common for cameras to reduce the amount of color information 
stored. For DVCPro 25 video, for example, color information is only recorded for 
every fourth pixel.
Camera systems achieve reductions in file size using this system of reduced color 
capture, and the approach varies from system to system. Sometimes color informa-
tion is stored for every other pixel; other times it might be recorded for every other 
pixel on every second line. Whatever the system, it’s going to make keying more 
difficult because there simply isn’t as much color detail as you’d like.
If you find your footage is not keying well, try the following:
• Consider applying a light blur effect before keying. This blends pixel detail, 
softening the edges and often giving a smoother-looking key. If the amount of 
blur is very light, it should not dramatically reduce the quality of your image. 
You can simply apply a blur effect to the clip, adjust the settings, and then apply 
a Chromakey effect on top. The Chromakey effect will work on the clip as it 
appears after being blurred.
• Consider color correcting your shot before you key it. If your shot lacks good 
contrast between your foreground and background, you can sometimes help 
the key by adjusting the picture first with an effect like the Three-Way Color 
Corrector or Fast Color Corrector.
using the ultra key effect
Adobe Premiere Pro has a powerful, fast, and intuitive Chromakey effect called 
Ultra Key. The workflow is very simple: Choose a color you would like to become 
transparent, and then adjust settings to suit. The Ultra Key effect, like every 
greenscreen keyer, dynamically generates a matte, based on the color selection. The 
matte is adjustable using the detailed settings of the Ultra Key effect.
Let’s try it.
1 Apply the Ultra Key effect to the KeyCar  
clip in the Keying Double Identity 
sequence.
2 In the Effect Controls panel, select the Key 
Color eyedropper. Use the eyedropper 
to click a green area in the KeyCar shot, 
visible through the windows of the car. This 
clip has a consistent green visible in the background, so it is not too important 
where you click. With other footage, you may need to experiment to find the 
right spot.
E Tip: If you hold the 
Control key (Windows) 
or Command (Mac OS) 
key when you click 
with the eyedropper, 
Adobe Premiere Pro 
takes a 5x5 pixel sample 
average, rather than a 
single pixel selection. 
This often captures a 
better color for keying.

370 
lesson 15 
exploring Compositing techniques
The Ultra Key effect identifies all pixels that have the green you selected and 
sets their alpha to 0%.
3 In the Effect Controls panel, change the Output menu for the Ultra Key effect 
to Alpha Channel. In this mode, the Ultra Key effect displays the alpha channel 
as a grayscale image, where dark pixels will be transparent and light pixels will 
be opaque.
It’s clear that what appeared to be a clean key is far from it: Those windows are 
far too gray.
4 Change the Setting menu to Aggressive, and scrub through the shot to see 
whether it has nice, clean black areas and white areas. If you see gray pixels in 
this view where there should not be, the result will be partially transparent parts 
in the picture.
5 Switch the Output menu back to Composite to see the result.
The Aggressive mode works much better for this clip. The Default, Relaxed, 
and Aggressive modes modify the Matte Generation, Matte Cleanup, and Spill 
Suppression settings. You can also modify them yourself to get a better key with 
more challenging footage.
Each group of settings has a different purpose. Here’s an overview:
• Matte Generation: Once you’ve chosen your key color, the Matte Generation 
controls adjust the way it is interpreted. You will often get positive results with 
more challenging footage by adjusting these settings.
• Matte Cleanup: Once your matte is defined, you can use these controls to 
adjust it. Choke shrinks the matte, which is helpful if your key selection misses 
some edges. Be careful not to choke the matte too much because you’ll begin 
to lose edge detail in the foreground image, often supplying a “digital haircut” 
in the vernacular of the visual-effects industry. Soften applies a blur to the 
matte, which often improves the apparent “blending” of the foreground and 
background image for a more convincing composite. Contrast increases the 
contrast of the alpha channel, making that black-and-white image a stronger 

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 371
black and white and thereby more clearly defining the key. You will often get 
much cleaner keys by increasing the contrast.
• Spill Suppression: Spill Suppression compensates for color that bounces from 
the green background onto the subject. When this happens, the combination of 
the green background and the subject’s own colors are usually different enough 
that it does not cause parts of the subject to be keyed transparent. However, it 
does not look good when the edges of your subject are green! Spill suppression 
automatically compensates by adding color to the foreground element edges 
that is positioned opposite, on a color wheel, to the key color. For example, 
magenta is added when greenscreen keying, or yellow is added when bluescreen 
keying. This neutralizes the color “spill.”
For more information about each of these controls, see the Adobe Premiere 
Pro Help.
The Color Correction controls give you a quick and easy way to adjust the appear-
ance of your foreground video to help it blend in with your background. Often, 
these three controls are enough to make a more natural match. Note that these 
adjustments are applied after the key, so you won’t cause problems for your key by 
adjusting the colors with these controls.
using mattes
The Ultra Key effect generates a matte dynamically, based on the colors in your 
shot. You can also create your own custom matte or use another clip as the basis 
for a matte.
When you create your own matte, you are defining a shape that will act as a cut-out 
for your video. Let’s try this with a common scenario when using greenscreen clips.
1 Open the Reporter sequence in the Sequences bin.
This sequence has a reporter standing in front of a greenscreen, but the green 
does not reach the edge of the screen.
P Note: In this 
example, we’re using 
footage with a green 
background. It is also 
possible you’ll have 
footage with a blue 
background for keying. 
The workflow is exactly 
the same.

372 
lesson 15 
exploring Compositing techniques
2 Apply the Four-Point Garbage Matte effect to the Reporter.mov clip. A garbage 
matte is a completely user-definable area that you want to define as visible or 
transparent.
3 Select the Four-Point Garbage Matte effect in the Effect Controls panel. You 
need to click the name of the effect on the list of effects to select it.
When you select the effect, Adobe Premiere Pro displays special handles in the 
Program Monitor.
4 Drag the garbage matte handles so the selection excludes the black curtain.
Immediately, you can see the background layer of this sequence. The Four-Point 
Garbage Matte effect is already defining some pixels that should be transparent.
5 Apply the Ultra Key effect to the foreground Reporter clip in the sequence and 
use the techniques you used previously to key the shot.
The result is a clean key, with no curtain. You used the Four-Point Garbage Matte 
effect because this was a relatively simple clip to fix. There are also Eight-Point 
and Sixteen-Point versions of this effect for more complex shots, plus the posi-
tions of the points can all be keyframed using the standard controls in the Effect 
Controls panel.
P Note: The matte in 
the example extends 
beyond the edge of the 
image. This is fine—the 
main goal is to choose 
what you will exclude. 
In this case, the curtain 
is successfully excluded.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 373
using mattes that use graphics or other clips
The Garbage Matte effects are user-defined regions that should be visible or trans-
parent. Adobe Premiere Pro can also use another clip as the basis for a matte.
Using the Track Matte Key effect, Adobe Premiere Pro borrows the luminance 
information or alpha channel information from one clip to define a matte for 
another clip. This simple effect can produce very powerful results, with a little plan-
ning and preparation.
using track matte key
Let’s use the Track Matte Key effect to create a layered background for future titles.
1 Open the Clouds sequence in the Sequences bin. This sequence has three layers:
•
Video 3: Some clouds. This clip has a 
Luma Curve effect applied to increase the 
contrast.
•
Video 2: A sunset photo with rich colors.
•
Video 1: A sunset photo with paler 
colors.
2
Apply the Track Matte Key effect to the Sunset clip on Video 2.
3
In the Effect Controls panel, set the Track Matte Key Matte menu to Video 3.
4
Set the Composite Using menu to Matte Luma.
Scrub through the sequence to see the result. The top clip is no longer visible. 
It is being used as a guide to define the visible and transparent regions of the clip 
on Video 2.
The effect is quite subtle, because the clouds move slowly. Nonetheless, the result is 
the appearance of pink clouds layered on the background layer.

374 
lesson 15 
exploring Compositing techniques
Creating a custom matte with the title tool
The Track Matte Key effect can use any other clip to define which pixels should 
be visible or transparent. It’s common to use the Adobe Premiere Pro Title tool to 
generate simple shapes for use with the Track Matte Key effect.
Let’s create a soft-edged circle we can use to highlight a region in a shot.
1 Open the sequence Mountain Race in the Sequences bin.
This sequence has a clip with two bikers racing and an adjustment layer. We 
want to draw attention to one of the cyclists. We’ll do this by combining the 
adjustment layer with a graphic created using the Adobe Premiere Pro Titler.
P Note: When you create a new title, Adobe Premiere Pro uses your current sequence as the 
default dimensions. It makes life easier if you open the sequence you need the title for before 
you begin.
2 Go to the Title menu, and choose New Title > Default Still.
The New Title dialog appears. You could change the settings if you needed, but 
they should be correct based on the current sequence.
3 Give the new title the name Highlight, and click OK.
4 There are several panels in the Titler. The panel at the top left has a series of 
tools for creating text and shapes. Select the Ellipse tool (
).
5 The center part of the Titler shows the current Timeline frame as a background 
for the title you are creating. Click into this area with the Ellipse tool and 
drag to create a circle. Hold the Shift key as you drag to confine the shape to a 
perfect circle, rather than an ellipse.
P Note: For more 
information about the 
Titler, see Chapter 16, 
“Creating Effective 
Titles.”

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 375
6 Switch to the Titler Selection tool. Click the circle you just created to select it. 
Once the circle is selected, the Title Properties panel displays options relating 
to the circle.
7 Change the Fill Type from Solid to Radial  
Gradient. This displays a color selector 
with two color stops—color pickers that 
blend together to create a gradient.
8 Click to select the second color stop; then reduce Color Stop Opacity to 0%.
Color Stop 1
Color Stop 2
P Note: You may 
need to widen the right 
column to see which 
property is Color Stop 
Opacity.

376 
lesson 15 
exploring Compositing techniques
9 This is almost perfect, but the gradient is not strong enough. Drag the second 
Color Stop to the left, to increase the gradient, until the circle has soft edges.
10 Close the Titler. Your new title is automatically added to the Project panel.
making a traveling matte
Once you have a graphic in the shape you’d like to use with the Track Matte Key 
effect, you can use the Motion controls in the Effect Controls panel to reposition 
and animate it.
1 Edit the soft edge circle title you just created onto Video 3. Adjust the position 
and duration so that it exactly matches the other clips on the Timeline. If 
you don’t have a title to use, you can use the Highlight Example clip in the 
Graphics bin.
P Note: It’s generally 
better to make graphics 
larger than you need 
and use the Scale 
control to reduce the 
size than to begin with 
the graphic too small 
and scale up. Scaling 
up might introduce 
hard edges because the 
pixels expand when you 
scale up.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 377
Initially, the graphic will sit rather obviously in the center of the screen.
2 Apply the Track Matte Key effect to the adjustment layer. In the Effect Controls 
panel, set the Track Matte Key Matte menu to Video 3.
Initially, you won’t see any effect, because no changes have been made with the 
adjustment layer.
3 In the Effect Controls panel, turn on the Fast Color Corrector effect.
This effect was already applied and set up for the adjustment layer in order to 
make the image brighter.
4 Select the Highlight title on the Timeline. Use the Motion controls in the 
Effect Controls panel to reposition the title so that it highlights the winning 
rider. Use keyframes to have the circle scale and move across the screen to 
follow the rider.
E Tip: If you select 
the Motion effect 
heading in the Effect 
Controls panel, the 
Program Monitor 
becomes a direct 
manipulation panel, 
where you can click and 
drag the clip to a new 
position and size.

lesson 15 
exploring Compositing techniques
using the after effects roto Brush tool
Adobe Premiere Pro has up to 16-point garbage mattes to manually mask image regions in clips. This 
is pretty powerful but not as powerful as Adobe After Effects, which can apply precisely positioned, 
keyframed, Bezier-curved, multipoint mattes. The process of very precisely selecting a foreground 
asset with a mask is called rotoscoping.
Adobe After Effects has a special Roto Brush tool that dramatically reduces the amount of work 
required to rotoscope a foreground image.
To send a clip to After Effects and use the Roto Brush, follow these steps:
1
Right-click the clip you would like to send to After Effects, and choose Replace With After Effects 
Composition.
Adobe Premiere Pro passes the clip to After Effects, where an After Effects composition will 
automatically be created.
2
You will need to give the new After Effects project a name and location. Consider saving the 
project in a subfolder with your Adobe Premiere Pro project.
3
The clip has already been added to a composition in After Effects. Double-click it inside the 
Timeline panel to open it, ready for editing.
4
Like Adobe Premiere Pro, After Effects has a series of tools for different tasks. In the case of After 
Effects, they are positioned at the top of the screen by default. Select the Roto Brush tool.
5
Using the Roto Brush tool, draw over the foreground subject. There’s no need to carefully draw 
close to the edges. The Roto Brush tool will automatically seek and snap to the edges of your 
subject.
6
Click repeatedly with the Roto Brush tool to add to your selection. Hold the Alt (Windows) or 
Option (Mac OS) key and click to remove things from your selection.
7
Just below the time ruler in the layer panel, there is a range selection for the Roto Brush tool. Be 
sure to drag the end of the range to select the total duration you would like the Roto Brush tool to 
work on.
8
Press the spacebar. The Roto Brush tool will automatically track the edges you selected, creating a 
mask that sets pixels outside of the selection as transparent and the pixels inside the selection as 
visible.
If the Roto Brush tool loses the edge of the selection, press the spacebar to stop the analysis, use 
the Roto Brush tool to adjust the selection, and press the spacebar again to continue.
9
When the Roto Brush tool has finished analyzing the clip, you can simply save the After Effects 
project and return to Adobe Premiere Pro. The clip will now have transparent pixels outside of the 
selected area, and you can use it as a foreground element in a composition.
The Roto Brush tool has effect controls, and you can access them in the Adobe After Effects Effect 
Controls panel that appears automatically when you begin working with the Roto Brush tool.
Be sure to save the Adobe After Effects project when you have finished, because Adobe Premiere Pro 
will need it to display the results of your mask.

review answers
1 All of the channels use the same scale. The difference is that the RGB channels describe 
color information, while the alpha channel describes opacity.
2 Blending modes are under the Opacity category in the Effect Controls panel.
3 You adjust clip opacity in the same way that you would adjust clip volume. Make sure 
you’re viewing the rubber band for the clip you want to adjust, and then click and drag 
with the Selection tool. You can also use the Pen tool to make subtle adjustments.
4 Right-click the file and choose Modify > Interpret Footage. The Alpha Channel options 
are at the bottom of the panel.
5 A key is usually a special effect where the color of pixels is used to define which part of 
the image should be transparent and which part should be visible.
6 No, you can use just about anything to create your key with the Track Matte Key effect. 
In fact, you can even apply special effects to the reference clip, and the results of those 
effects will be reflected in the matte.

You can use the Tilter in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 to 
create text and shapes. These objects can then be 
placed above video or used as stand-alone clips to 
convey information to an audience. You can create 
both static and dynamic titles.

382 
lesson 16 
Creating titles
Getting started
While you will rely upon audio and video sources as the primary ingredients for 
building a sequence, you will often need to incorporate text into your project. Text 
is very effective when you need to convey information quickly to your audience. For 
example, you can identify a speaker in your video by superimposing her name and 
title during the interview (often called a lower-third or simply an ID). You may also 
use text to identify sections of a long video (often called bumpers) or to acknowl-
edge the cast and crew (with credits).
The proper use of text allows you to succinctly deliver information. It is clearer 
than the use of a narrator and allows for information to be presented in the middle 
of dialogue segments. Additionally, text can be used as a reinforcement of key 
information to the end viewer.
With Adobe Premiere Pro CS6, you will find a versatile Title tool. It offers you a 
range of text- and shape-creation tools that can be used to design effective titles. 
You can use the fonts loaded on your computer as well as control opacity and 
color. You can also insert graphic elements or logos that were created using other 
Adobe applications such as Adobe Photoshop or Adobe Illustrator. The Titler is an 
engaging and powerful tool. Its customizability makes it possible for you to create 
compelling titles to use in your productions.
an overview of the titler window
In this lesson, let’s start with some preformatted text and modify its parameters. 
This approach is a good way to get a quick overview of the powerful features of the 
Adobe Premiere Pro Titler. Later in this lesson, you’ll build titles from scratch.
1 Start Adobe Premiere Pro, and open the project Lesson 16.prproj.
The sequence 01 Seattle should already be open.
2 Double-click Title Start in the Project panel.
The Titler window opens with a title already loaded over a video frame. The 
textbox should be selected by default; if not, click once to choose it.

• Title Tools panel: These tools define text boundaries, set text paths, and select 
geometric shapes.
• Title Designer panel: This is where you build and view text and graphics.
• Title Properties panel: Here you’ll find text and graphic options such as font 
characteristics and effects.
• Title Actions panel: You’ll use these to align, center, or distribute text and 
groups of objects.
• Title Styles panel: Here you’ll find preset text styles. You can choose from 
several libraries of styles.
P Note: You may have 
to expand the window 
to see all the Title

384 
lesson 16 
Creating titles
3 Click several different thumbnails in the Title Styles panel to acquaint yourself 
with the styles available.
Each time you click a new style, Adobe Premiere Pro instantly changes the 
active or selected text to that style. When you’re finished checking out some of 
the styles, choose the style Adobe Garamond White 90 (shown here). This style 
works with the mood of the scene in the video.
4 Click the Font Browser menu in the Titler. Note that the current font is Adobe 
Garamond Pro.
5 Scroll through the fonts, and note that as you select a new font, you see 
immediately how it will work with your text.
The specific fonts loaded on each system will vary. Just choose one that looks 
close to those used in this lesson.
6 Click the Font Family menu in the Title Properties panel on the right of the 
Titler. This is another way to change fonts in the Titler. Experiment with 
changing the font through this panel. You can also experiment with the Font 
Style menu.
7 After you’re done experimenting, choose Adobe Caslon Pro from the Font 
Family menu. Choose Bold from the Font Style menu to make the text easier 
to read.
P Note: With all the 
clicking and testing, you 
might have deselected 
the text. If there is no 
bounding box with 
handles around the 
text, select the text by 
clicking the Selection 
tool (in the upper-left 
corner of the Titler) and 
clicking anywhere in 
the text.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 385
8 Change the font size to 140 by typing the new value into the Font Size field or by 
dragging the Size number until it reaches 140. The text may become hidden; if 
so, resize the textbox by dragging the top handle of the bounding box with the 
Selection Tool.
9 In the Title Designer panel, click the Center 
button to center the text.
10 Change Tracking to 3.0. Tracking changes the 
amount of space between all of the characters in 
the text block.
Let’s make the drop shadow more pronounced and easier to read.
11 In the Title Properties panel, change Shadow Distance to 10, Shadow Size to 15, 
and Shadow Spread to 45. You can enter numbers into each field or click and 
drag the numbers to scrub their values.
12 In the Title Actions panel, click the Horizontal Center and Vertical Center 
buttons to align the text to the absolute center of the screen.

Creating titles
Your screen should look like the one shown here.
13 Drag the Titler floating window to the right—far enough to be able to see the 
Project panel.
14 In the Project panel, double-click Title Finished to load it in the Titler.
15 Toggle between the two titles by using the drop-down menu in the Titler 
main panel.
Your text should look similar to the Title Finished text.
16 Close the Titler by clicking the little x in the upper-right corner (Windows) or 
the Close button (Mac OS).
17 Drag Title Start from the Project panel to the Video 2 track on the Timeline, 
trim it so it fits above the video clip, and drag the current-time indicator 
through it to see how it looks over that video clip.
P Note: Adobe 
Premiere Pro auto-
matically saves your 
updated title in the 
project file. It does not 
show up as a separate 
file on your hard drive.
P Note: You can apply 
transitions to titles 
to fade them up or 
move them on or off 
the screen.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 387
using titles in other projects
You’re likely to create common titles for location names and identification of inter-
viewee names that you can use in multiple projects. However, Adobe Premiere Pro 
does not automatically save titles as separate files. To make a title available for use in 
another project, select the title in the Project panel, choose File > Export > Title, give 
your title a name, choose a location, and click Save. Later, you can simply import 
that title file the same way you would import any other asset.
Video typography essentials
When you design text for video, it is essential that you follow acceptable typog-
raphy conventions. Because the text is often being composited over a moving 
background with multiple colors, you must attempt to achieve clarity in design. You 
must find a proper balance of legibility and style, all the while fitting enough infor-
mation on the screen but not crowding it. Otherwise, the text will quickly become 
difficult to read and frustrating for the viewer.
font choice
Your computer likely has hundreds (if not thousands) of fonts. This makes choos-
ing a good font much more difficult. To simplify the selection process, try using a 
triage mentality and consider a few guiding questions:
• Readability: Is the font easy to read at the point size you are using? Are all the 
characters in the line of text readable? If you look at it quickly and then close 
your eyes, what do you remember about the text block?
• Style: How would you describe the font you’ve chosen using adjectives only? 
Does the font convey the right emotion for your video? Type is like a wardrobe; 
picking the right font is essential to the success of the design.
• Flexibility: Does the font mix well with others? Does it come in various weights 
(such as bold, italic, and semibold) that make it easier to convey significance 
when using that font? Can you create a hierarchy of information that conveys 
different kinds of information, such as a name and title for a speaker’s lower-
third graphic?
The answers to these guiding principles should help steer you toward better-
designed titles. You may need to experiment to find the best font. Fortunately, you 
can easily modify an existing title or duplicate it and change the copy.

typography, consider

Sheep & Find Out How 
Type Works (Adobe 
Press, 2002) by Erik 
Spiekermann and

lesson 16 
Creating titles
Color choice
While you have a near infinite number of possible color combinations, choosing 
the right colors to use in a design can be surprisingly tricky. This is because only 
a few colors work well for text and remain clear to the viewer. This task becomes 
even more difficult if your video is for broadcast or if your design must stylistically 
match the branding for a series or product. The text must also work once it’s placed 
over a busy moving background (this issue is typically called type on pattern).
The white text in the image on the left has the most readability over the dark background. The blue text in the image on the right 
is more difficult to read because it is similar in color and tone to the sky.
While you may think you’re being conservative, the most common color for text in 
video is white. Not surprisingly, the second most popular color is black. When col-
ors are used, they tend to be very light or very dark shades. Lighter colors that work 
well include light yellow, blue, gray, and tan. Darker colors that can work include 
navy and forest green. The color you choose must provide suitable contrast from 
the background the text is being placed over.
P Note: When creating text for use in a video, you will often find yourself placing it over a 
background that has many colors present. This will make it difficult to achieve proper contrast 
(which is essential to preserving legibility). To help in this case, you may need to add a stroke, outer 
glow, or drop shadow to get a contrasting edge.

kerning
As you build titles, you may decide that you want to modify the space between 
individual pairs of letters. This is typically done to improve the appearance of text 
and is a process called kerning. Taking the time to manually adjust text becomes 
more important the larger the font gets (because it just makes improper kerning 
that much more visible). The goal is to improve the appearance and readability of 
your text, while creating optical flow.
E Tip: A common place to start kerning is to adjust between an initial capital letter and the 
succeeding lowercase letters, particularly in the case of a letter with very little “base” like a T, which 
creates the illusion of excessive space along the baseline.
The original kerning is a bit loose in spots (left). After you adjust it by hand, the overall readability improves (right). Kerning is best 
learned by studying professionally designed materials like posters and magazines.
In Adobe Premiere Pro (and other Adobe applications), kerning is easy to adjust.
1 Click to place your cursor or move it using the arrow keys.
2 When the blinking I-bar is between the two letters you want to kern, hold down 
the Alt (Windows) or Option (Mac OS) key.
3 Press the left-arrow key to pull the letters closer or the right-arrow key to push 
them farther apart.
4 Move to the next letter pair and adjust as needed.

Creating titles
tracking
Another text property (which is similar to kerning) is tracking. This is the overall 
space between all letters in a line of text. Tracking can be used to globally condense 
or expand a line of text so it better fits on-screen. It is often employed in the follow-
ing scenarios:
• Tighter tracking: If a line of text is too long (such as a length title for a 
speaker’s lower-third), you may tighten it slightly to fit. This will keep the 
vertical height the same but fit more text into the available space.
• Looser tracking: A looser track can be useful when using all uppercase letters 
or if you need to apply an outside stroke to the text. It is used often for large 
titles or when text is used as a design or motion graphics element.
Tracking is combined with the use of the Small Caps option to create a stylized title that is still 
easy to read.
Tracking is typically done in the Title Properties panel in Adobe Premiere Pro (or 
the Character panel in other Adobe applications). Tracking, like kerning, is subjec-
tive, and you can learn best how to do it by studying professional examples and 
looking for inspiration and guidance.
Loose tracking
Tight tracking

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 391
Leading
Just as there is a need to control the space between characters horizontally, you’ll 
also want to control the vertical space between lines of text. This process is called 
leading, and it is pronounced lead-ing as in the metal, not lead-ing as in sheep. The 
name is derived from the time when strips of lead were used on a printing press to 
create space between lines of text.
The original leading causes the two lines of text to become difficult to read (left). Changing the leading value from 5 to 24 in the 
Title Properties panel increases the space between lines and improves readability (right).
In most cases, you should use the default setting of Auto for leading your text. 
However, you can change leading as needed to fit text into a design template or to 
get more information on the screen at once. To fit more text on the screen, you’ll 
tighten the leading to produce less space between lines of text (you can also loosen 
it to spread text apart).
Don’t set the leading too tight; otherwise, descenders from the top line (like the 
downward lines on j, p, q, and z) will cross ascenders from the lower line (like the 
upward lines on b, d, k, and l). This collision will likely have a negative impact on 
the readability of your text.
alignment
While you may be used to seeing text left-justified for things like a newspaper, there 
are no hard-and-fast rules for aligning video text. In a general sense, the text used 
for a lower-third title tends to be left- or right-justified.
On the other hand, you will often center text used 
in a title sequence or segment bumper. In the 
Titler (or Paragraph panel for other Adobe appli-
cations), you’ll find buttons for aligning your text. 
These can be used to align text left, right, or centered.
P Note: When setting text in an Adobe application, you often don’t just want to click and type 
(called point text). Instead, you can click and drag using the Type tool to define the paragraph area 
first. This is called paragraph text and offers greater control over alignment and layout.

392 
lesson 16 
Creating titles
safe title margin
When you’re designing in the Titler, you’ll see a series of two nested boxes. The first 
box shows you 90 percent of the viewable area, which is considered the action-safe 
margin. Things that fall outside of this box may get cut off when the video signal is 
viewed on a television set. Be sure to place all critical elements that are meant to be 
seen (like a logo) in this region.
The text on the left is too close to the edge (and outside the safe title margin). The image on the right shows the text properly 
repositioned within the title-safe margin, which improves readability for video text.
The second box, which is 80 percent of the viewable area, is called the title-safe zone. 
Just as this book you’re reading has margins to keep the text from getting too close 
to the edge, it’s a good idea to keep text inside the innermost or title-safe zone. This 
will make it easier for your audience to read the information.
P Note: You can turn off the title-safe margins or action-safe margins by opening the Titler 
panel menu (or choosing Title > View) and then choosing Safe Title Margin or Safe Action Margin, 
respectively.
Creating titles
When you create a title, you will need to make some choices as to how the text is 
organized on the screen. The Titler panel offers three approaches to creating text, 
each offering both horizontal and vertical text-direction options:
Vertical Type tool
Vertical Area Type tool
Vertical Path Type tool
Horizontal Type tool
Area Type tool
Path Type tool
• Point text: This approach builds a text bounding box as you type. The text runs 
on one line until you press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) or until you 

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 393
choose Title > Word Wrap. Changing the shape and size of the box changes the 
shape and size of the text.
• Paragraph (area) text: You set the size and shape of the textbox before entering 
text. Changing the box size later displays more or less text but does not change 
the shape or size of the text.
• Text on a path: You build a path for the text to follow by clicking points in the 
text screen to create curves and then adjusting the shape and direction of those 
curves using the handles.
In the Title Tools panel, you can select a tool from the left or right side. This will 
determine whether the text will orient horizontally or vertically.
adding point text
Now that you have a basic understanding of how to modify and design a title, you 
can build one from scratch. Let’s work with a new project. You’ll be creating a title 
that will be used to promote a conference in Las Vegas.
1 Open the sequence 02 Vegas from the Project panel.
2 To open the New Title dialog, choose File > New > Title, or press Control+T 
(Windows) or Command+T (Mac OS).
3 Type Las Vegas in the Name box, and click OK.
4 Drag the timecode (directly to the right of the Show Background Video button) 
to change the video frame displayed on the text screen.
Show Background Video
Timecode
E Tip: Dragging the timecode with the text screen displayed is a useful way to position text 
relative to the video contents. You can also use it to evaluate how the text looks over your video and 
make adjustments to improve readability. The video frame displayed behind the title is not saved 
with the title. It is there only as a reference for positioning and styling your title.
P Note: Adobe 
Premiere Pro will 
automatically match 
a new title’s settings 
to the open sequence. 
This means you may 
see different video 
attributes when you 
create a new title for 
frame sizes and aspect 
ratios. It’s a good idea 
to have the sequence 
for which you want to 
design open and to use 
the default settings that 
Adobe Premiere Pro 
loads to match.

394 
lesson 16 
Creating titles
5 Click the Show Background Video button to hide the video clip.
The background now shows a grayscale checkerboard, which signifies 
transparency. This means that when the title is placed above a video track 
in your Timeline, the transparent areas would let the video show through. If 
you reduce the opacity of the text, you will see some of the background show 
through. Remember, an opacity of 100 percent means 0 percent transparency 
(while an opacity of 30 percent means 70 percent transparency).
6 Click the Myriad Pro White 25 style (shown here).
Let your cursor hover above a style for a few seconds to see its name.
7 Click the Type tool (shortcut T), and click anywhere in the Titler panel.
The Type tool creates point text.
8 Type LAS VEGAS to match the figure here.
P Note: If you were to continue typing a long title, you’d 
notice that point text does not wrap automatically. This 
will cause your text to run off the screen to the right. 
To make text wrap automatically when it reaches the 
title-safe margin, choose Title > Word Wrap. If you want 
to force a new line to start, press Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS).
9 Click the Selection tool (the arrow in the upper-left corner of the Title Tools 
panel). Handles appear on the text bounding box.
You won’t be able to use a keyboard shortcut because you are typing into a text 
bounding box.
10 Drag the corners and edges of the text bounding box, and note how the text 
changes size and shape accordingly. Hold down the Shift key to constrain the 
text so it scales uniformly.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 395
11 Hover the pointer just outside a corner of the text bounding box until a curved 
line pointer appears. Then drag to rotate the bounding box off its horizontal 
orientation.
12 After making sure the Selection tool is still active, click anywhere within the 
bounding box, and drag the angled text and its bounding box somewhere else 
on the Titler panel.
Try to approximately match this look. Adjust the size, rotation, and position of 
the text using the techniques you’ve learned so far.
adding paragraph text
While point text is very flexible, you can take better control over layout with para-
graph text. This option will automatically wrap the text as it reaches the edge of the 
paragraph textbox.
Continue working with the same title you have open from the previous exercise.
1 Click the Area Type tool in the Title Tools panel.
2 Drag a text bounding box into the Titler panel that fills the upper-right corner of 
the title-safe area.
The Area Type tool creates paragraph text.
E Tip: Instead of 
dragging bounding 
box handles, you can 
change values in the 
Transform settings in 
the Title Properties 
panel. Either type new 
values or position your 
pointer on a value 
and drag left or right. 
Your changes show 
up immediately in the 
bounding box (as long 
as it is selected).

lesson 16 
Creating titles
3 Start typing. Start entering names of participants who will be attending the 
event in Las Vegas. You can use the names here or add your own.
This time, type enough characters to go beyond the end of the bounding box. 
Reduce the font size if needed so you can see a few lines of text at once. Unlike 
point text, area text remains within the confines of the bounding box you 
defined. It wraps at the bounding box borders.
4 Press Enter (Windows) or Return (Mac OS) to go down a line.
5 Click the Selection tool, and change the size and shape of the bounding box.
The original text is too large to fit on one line (left). Resizing the text bounding box allows more text to fit 
on one line (right).
The text does not change size. Instead, it adjusts its position on the bounding 
box baselines. If you make the box too small to fit all your text, the extra 
text scrolls below the bottom edge of the bounding box. In that case, a small 
plus  (+) sign appears near the lower-right corner outside the bounding box.
6 Close the current title you have open.
Because Adobe Premiere Pro automatically saves text to the project file, you 
can switch to a new or different title and not lose whatever you’ve created in 
the current title.
The text in this screen 
is too large to fit on one 
line, so it automatically 
wraps to the next. By 
reducing the font size 
in the Title Properties 
panel, you can fit more 
text on one line.
E Tip: A good way to 
avoid spelling mistakes 
is to copy and paste 
text from an approved 
script or e-mail that has 
been reviewed by your 
client or producer.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 397
stylizing text
Earlier you experimented with title styles, which quickly apply formatting to a 
selected text block. While title styles are fast and easy, they are only the beginning. 
You can use the Title Properties panel to take precise control over the appearance 
of your text.
Changing a title’s appearance
In the Title Properties panel, you will find several options for modifying the 
appearance of your text. When they’re used correctly (and with restraint), you can 
use them to improve the readability of your type and its overall appearance or style. 
However, it’s possible to overdo it and add too many effects, which will produce 
amateurish results and impact readability.
E Tip: Instead of using the Color Picker to change the Color Stop Color, you can use the 
Eyedropper tool (located next to the color swatch) to select a color from your video. Click the Show 
Video button at the top of the Titler panel, move to a frame you want to use by scrubbing the 
timecode numbers left or right, move the Eyedropper tool into your video scene, and click a color 
that suits your needs.
Here are some of the most useful tools for modern typographic design. You’ll find 
these in the Typographic Properties panel:

398 
lesson 16 
Creating titles
• Fill Type: You have several choices of fill type. The most popular ones are Solid 
and Linear Gradient, but you will also find additional gradient, bevel, and 
ghosting options.
• Color: Set the color for your text. You can click the swatch or enter numerical 
values in the Color Picker or use the Eyedropper tool to sample from your 
video clip.
• Sheen: A gentle highlight can add depth to your title. Be sure to adjust the size 
and opacity so the effect is subtle.
• Stroke: You can click to add inner and outer strokes. Strokes can be solid or 
gradient and add a thin edge to the outside of the text. Adjust the opacity of a 
gradient to create a gentle glow or soft edge. A stroke is commonly used to help 
keep text legible over a video or complex background.
• Shadow: The use of a drop shadow is a common addition to video text because 
it makes the text easier to read. Be sure to adjust the softness of the shadow. 
Also, be sure to keep the angle of shadows identical for all titles in a project for 
design consistency.
1 In the Project panel, double-click the Las Vegas title.
2 Modify the Las Vegas text block using the properties described in this section.
3 Continue designing until you have a look that is visually pleasing to you.
P Note: If you see 
an exclamation point 
next to the color you’ve 
chosen, Adobe Premiere 
Pro is warning you that 
a color is not broadcast-
safe. This means it can 
cause problems when 
the video signal is 
put into a broadcast 
environment (and can 
be problematic when 
burned to a DVD or 
Blu-ray as well). Be sure 
to click the exclamation 
point to choose the 
closest color that is still 
broadcast-safe.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 399
saving custom styles
If you create a look you like, you can save time by storing it as a style. A style 
describes the color and font characteristics for a block of type. You can easily reuse 
a style to reformat the appearance of text with one click. All of the properties of the 
text update to match the preset.
Let’s create a style from the text you’ve been modifying in the previous section.
1 Select a text block or object that has the properties applied that you want 
to save.
Use the text you formatted in the previous exercise.
2 In the Title Styles panel menu, click the submenu and choose New Style.
3 Enter a descriptive name, and click OK. The style is added to the Title Styles 
panel.
4 To view styles more easily, you can click the Title Styles submenu and choose to 
view the presets as Text Only, Small Thumbnails, or Large Thumbnails.
5 To manage a style, right-click its thumbnail. You can choose to duplicate a style 
to modify a copy, rename a style so it’s easier to find, or delete a style if you want 
to remove it.

Creating an adobe Photoshop graphic or title
Another choice for creating titles or graphics for Adobe Premiere Pro is Adobe Photoshop. While it is 
known as the premier tool for modifying photos, Adobe Photoshop also has a great deal of capabili-
ties for creating elegant titles or logo treatments. Adobe Photoshop offers several advanced options 
including anti-aliasing (for smoother text), advanced formatting such as scientific notation, flexible 
layer styles, and even a spelling checker.
To create a new Adobe Photoshop document from within Adobe Premiere Pro, do the following:
1
In Adobe Premiere Pro, select the Project panel, and choose File > New > Photoshop File.
2
Examine the New Photoshop File window. The video settings should be correctly set for your 
project.
3
Click OK.
4
Choose a location to store your PSD file, name it, and click Save.
5
Adobe Photoshop or Photoshop Extended opens, allowing you to edit the title.
The new Adobe Photoshop document you created will automatically match the current Adobe 
Premiere Pro Timeline in use (or the preset you chose). Now that you have a Photoshop document 
open, let’s take a quick look at some of the functionality in Adobe Photoshop.
6
Select the Text tool by pressing T.
7
Draw a text  block and, by clicking and dragging, draw from the left edge of the title-safe area to 
the right edge. This creates a paragraph textbox to hold the text. As in Adobe Premiere Pro, the 
use of a paragraph textbox in Adobe Photoshop allows you to precisely control the layout of text.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 401

8
Enter the text you’d like to use.
9
Adjust the font, color, and point size to taste using the controls in the Options bar across the top of 
the screen to adjust the font and text options.
10 Click the check mark in the Options bar to commit the text layer.
11 If you need transparency, be sure to disable the Background 
layer by clicking the visibility icon next to it in the Layers 
panel. You’ll see a checkerboard pattern indicating 
transparency. 
When you’re finished in Adobe Photoshop, you can close and 
save the title. It will be automatically updated in the Adobe 
Premiere Pro project. If you’d like to return to Adobe Photoshop, 
just select a title in the Project panel or Timeline and choose 
Edit > Edit in Adobe Photoshop.

Creating titles
Working with shapes and logos
When building titles for your program, you’ll likely need more than just words to 
build a complete graphic. Fortunately, Adobe Premiere Pro also offers the ability 
to generate vector shapes that can be filled and stylized to create graphic elements. 
You can also import completed graphics (like a logo) to enhance your Adobe 
Premiere Pro title.
Creating shapes
If you’ve created shapes in graphics-editing software such as Adobe Photoshop 
or Adobe Illustrator, you’ll find creating geometric objects in Adobe Premiere Pro 
quite similar. Simply select from the various shapes in the Title Tools panel, drag 
and draw the outline, and release the mouse button.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 403
Follow these steps to draw shapes in Adobe Premiere Pro. This exercise is just for 
practice.
1
Press Control+T (Windows) or Command+T (Mac OS) to open a new title.
2
Type Shapes Practice in the Name box in the New Title dialog, and click OK.
3
Click the Show Background Video button to hide the video preview.
4
Select the Rectangle tool (R), and drag in the Titler panel to create a rectangle.
5 Click different title styles while the rectangle is still selected.
You’ll notice that title styles affect shapes as well as text. Experiment with 
different styles or create your own.
6 Shift+drag in another location to create a square.
7 Select the Rounded Corner Rectangle tool, and Alt+drag (Windows) or 
Option+drag (Mac OS) to draw from the center of the shape.
The center remains in the spot where you first clicked, and the figure changes 
shape and size around that point as you drag.

404 
lesson 16 
Creating titles
8 Select the Clipped Corner Rectangle tool, and Shift+Alt+drag (Windows) or 
Shift+Option+drag (Mac OS) to constrain the aspect ratio and draw from 
the center.
You’ll also find additional tools for creating lines and free-form paths.
9 Press Control+A (Windows) or Command+A (Mac OS) and then press Delete 
to make another clean slate.
10 Select the Line tool (L), and drag to create a single line.
11 Select the Pen tool, and click in a blank area of the title canvas to create an 
anchor point (don’t drag to create handles).
12 Click the Titler panel again where you want the segment to end (or Shift+click 
to constrain the segment’s angle to a multiple of 45 degrees). This creates 
another anchor point.
13 Continue clicking with the Pen tool to create additional straight segments. The 
last anchor point you add appears as a large square, indicating it is selected.
14 Complete the path by doing one of the following:
•
To close the path, move the Pen tool to the initial anchor point. When it is 
directly over the initial anchor point, a little circle appears underneath the 
Pen pointer. Click to make the connection.
•
To leave the path open, Command+click (Mac OS) or Control+click 
(Windows) anywhere away from all objects, or select a different tool in the 
Title Tools panel.
Experiment with the different shape options. Try overlapping them and using dif-
ferent styles. The possibilities are endless.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 405
adding a logo
The use of a logo allows you to integrate a graphic file into your title design. You 
can insert common file formats including vectors (.ai, .eps) or still images (.psd, 
.png, .jpeg).
1 In the Project panel, double-click the file Lower-Third Start to open the title in 
the Titler panel.
2
Choose Title > Logo > Insert Logo.
3
Select the file logo.ai from the Lesson 16 folder, and click Open.
4
With the Selection tool, drag the logo to position it where you want it in the title.
If necessary, adjust the size, opacity, rotation, or scale of the logo. Hold down 
the Shift key to constrain proportions when you scale to prevent unwanted 
distortion.
 5 When finished, close the title.
If you need to restore a logo to its default size, just select it and choose Title > 
Logo > Restore Logo Size. If you accidentally distorted the logo, select the logo 
and choose Title > Logo > Restore Logo Aspect Ratio.
P Note: If you place 
a vector graphic into a 
title, Adobe Premiere 
Pro converts it into a 
bitmap graphic. The 
image will appear at 
its original size. You 
can scale it smaller; if 
you make it larger, the 
image may become 
pixelated.

lesson 16 
Creating titles
aligning shapes and logos
As you design titles, you will often want to keep the design uniform and neat. The 
Adobe Premiere Pro Titler offers the ability to align and distribute elements with 
a title. Align lets an object’s position match, such as the bottom edges or centers 
of two or more objects. You can also take three or more objects and evenly space 
them in relation to each other with a justify command.
1 In the Project panel, double-click the file Align Start to open the title in the 
Titler panel.
This title contains three shapes that are randomly positioned on the screen.
2 Select all three squares by Shift+clicking each one.
Notice that when more than one object is selected, the Align tools become 
active.
3 Click the Align Vertical Bottom button to align the bottom edges 
of the three objects.
The three objects are now aligned based on the bottommost 
object.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 407
4 Click the Horizontal Center Distribute button to equally space the three objects 
from one another.
The objects are now evenly spaced and aligned with one another. Now, let’s 
space them in relation to the canvas.
5 Click both the Horizontal Center and Vertical Center tools.
You should have three perfectly aligned squares centered in the title area.

lesson 16 
Creating titles
making text roll and crawl
Using the Titler, you can make rolling text for opening and closing credits and 
crawling text for items such as headline bulletins.
1
From the Adobe Premiere Pro menu bar, choose Title > New Title > Default Roll.
2
Name your title Rolling Credits, and click OK.
3
Select the Type tool, and then type some text with the Caslon Pro 68 style.
Create placeholder credits as shown here, pressing Enter (Windows) or 
Return (Mac OS) after each line. Type enough text to more than fill the 
screen vertically. Use the Title Properties panel to format your text as desired.
4 Click the Roll/Crawl Options button.
Roll/Crawl Options
You have the following options:
•
Still: This changes the credits to a still title.
•
Roll (scroll text vertically): This should be selected already, because this title 
was created to scroll vertically, as often seen in movie credits.
•
Crawl Left, Crawl Right: These indicate the crawl direction (rolling text 
always moves up the screen).
•
Start Off Screen: This controls whether the credits start completely off 
the screen and roll on or whether they begin at the location as typed in 
the Titler.
P Note: With rolling 
text selected, the Titler 
automatically adds a 
scrollbar along the right 
side that enables you 
to view your text as it 
runs off the bottom 
of the screen (shown 
here). If you select one 
of the crawl options, 
that scrollbar will 
appear at the bottom to 
enable you to view text 
running off the right or 
left edge of the screen.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 409
•
End Off Screen: This indicates whether the credits roll completely off 
the screen.
•
Preroll: This specifies the number of frames before the first words appear 
on-screen.
•
Ease-In: This specifies the number of frames at the beginning to gradually 
increase the speed of the roll or crawl from zero to its full speed.
•
Ease-Out: This specifies the number of frames to slow down the roll or 
crawl at its end.
•
Postroll: This specifies the number of frames that play after the roll or 
crawl ends.
5 Select Start Off Screen and End Off Screen, and type 5 for Ease-In and 5 for 
Ease-Out. Click OK.
6 Close the Titler.
7 Drag your newly created Rolling Credits title to the Video 2 track of the 
Timeline above the video clip (if another title is there, drag this one directly 
on top of it to do an overlay edit).
8 With the Edit tool, grab the right edge of the Rolling Credits clip, and drag it to 
be the same length as the video clip in track 1.
9 With the sequence selected, press the spacebar to view your rolling credits.
E Tip: It’s often easier to set your credits in a word processing application or text document. You 
can then copy and paste rather than type them into a title.
P Note: Dragging a 
rolling title to increase 
its length will cause it 
to roll slower. Dragging 
the rolling title to 
decrease its length will 
cause it to roll faster.

lesson 16 
Creating titles
animated text with adobe after effects
If you’d like to create animated titles for use in Adobe Premiere Pro, you’ll find excellent options avail-
able in Adobe After Effects. You’ll find a very deep animation engine with 17 animation properties 
ranging from Scale and Position to Blur and Skew.
1
To create a new Adobe After Effects composition from within Adobe Premiere Pro, choose File > 
Adobe Dynamic Link > New After Effects Composition.
2
The New After Effects Comp window is automatically filled in with settings that match your 
project settings. Click OK. A new Adobe After Effects composition is added to both your Timeline 
and Project panels.
3
You are automatically switched to Adobe After Effects. Name the project, and click Save.
Store the project with your Adobe Premiere Pro project file so that your media path structure 
is easy to preserve. Any additional clips sent to Adobe After Effects from your current Adobe 
Premiere Pro project will automatically join this linked Adobe After Effects project.
4
Select the Text tool, and click in the After Effects Composition panel to enter text.
You can click the buttons beneath the composition window to turn on a title-safe overlay. If you 
are unsure of what a button does, just hover your cursor over it to see a tool tip.
5
Adjust the text properties with the Character panel to improve its style and legibility.
6 
An easy way to animate the layer is with presets. Select the text layer in the Timeline panel. 
Position the current-time indicator (playhead) at the start of the timeline.

7
Select the Effects & Presets panel (if it’s not visible, you can choose it in the Window menu). Click 
the submenu in the upper-right corner of the Effects & Presets panel and choose Browse Presets. 
Adobe Bridge launches with the default presets shown.
8
Select the folder named Text, and double-click to open it. Double-click other subfolders to 
examine other animation presets. You can click an .ffx file to see a preview movie in the Preview 
pane. Use the navigation path at the top of the window to switch to a different folder.

9
Select a preset effect and double-click to apply it to your selected text layer. For this exercise, 
choose Animate In > Raining Characters In.ffx. Adobe Bridge is minimized, and Adobe After Effects 
becomes the active application.
10 In the Preview panel, click the RAM Preview button to preview 
the text animation. In this animation, the timing might be 
different than you’d like, but you can easily modify it.
11 With the layer in Adobe After Effects selected, press U to see all 
your user-added keyframes. You can drag the keyframes to new 
positions in the Timeline to adjust the start and end time of the 
animation.
12 You can adjust the individual parameters of the text effects. Click the disclosure triangle next to 
the Range Selector to close it; then click it again to open it and show all the animation properties. 
Click the triangle next to Advanced to see all those properties as well.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 413
animated text with adobe after effects (continued)
13 Experiment with the different Advanced properties to see the results. In particular, experiment 
with the following properties, and click RAM Preview occasionally to view the changes:
•   Randomize Order: Randomizes the order in which the property is applied to the characters 
affected by the Range Selector.
•   Random Seed: Affects the method used to calculate randomness. Try inputting a different value 
to produce a varied animation.
•   Shape: Affects the shape used to select characters between the start and end of the range. 
Choosing different options will result in subtle but significant changes. You can choose Square, 
Ramp Up, Ramp Down, Triangle, Round, or Smooth.
14 If you’re happy with the animation as is, save your Adobe After Effects project and return to Adobe 
Premiere Pro. You can now edit the new Adobe After Effects composition into your Timeline just as 
you would any other title.

review questions
1
What are the differences between point text and paragraph (or area) text?
2
Why display the title-safe zone?
3
Why might the Align tools be dimmed?
4
How do you use the Rectangle tool to make a perfect square?
5
How do you apply a stroke or drop shadow?
review answers
1 You create point text with the Type tool. Its bounding box expands as you type. 
Changing the box shape changes the text size and shape accordingly. When you use 
the Area Type tool, you define a bounding box, and the characters remain within its 
confines. Changing the box’s shape displays more or fewer characters.
2 Some TV sets cut off the edges of the TV signal. The amount lost varies from set to 
set. Keeping your text within the title-safe margin ensures that viewers will see all 
your title. This is less of a problem with newer digital TVs, but it is still a good idea 
to use the title-safe zone to frame your titles.
3 The Align tools become active if more than one object is selected in the Titler. 
The Distribute tools also become active when more than two objects are selected.
4 To create a perfect square, hold down the Shift key as you draw using the 
Rectangle tool.
5 To apply a stroke or drop shadow, select the text or object to edit, and click its Stroke 
(Outer or Inner) or Shadow box to add a stroke or a drop shadow. Then start adjusting 
parameters, and they will show up on the object.

Stay on top of your media and projects with a few 
simple steps.

lesson 17 
managing Your Projects
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to stay organized when working with multiple 
Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 projects. The best kind of organizational system is one 
you already have when you need it—not when you’re caught up in the creative pro-
cess. This lesson will help you to be more creative with a little bit of planning.
Getting started
When you start creating projects with Adobe Premiere Pro, you may not feel the 
need to invest time in staying organized. Perhaps you’re just working on your first 
project now, and if that’s the case, it’s going to be nice and easy to find it on your 
hard drive.
Once you start working on multiple projects, staying organized gets a little more 
complicated. You’ll be using multiple media assets taken from multiple places. 
You’ll have multiple sequences, each with its own particular layout, and you’ll be 
generating multiple titles. You may also have multiple effect presets and title tem-
plates. All in all, you’ll need quite a filing system to keep all these project elements 
organized.
The solution is to create an organizational system for your projects and to have a 
plan in place for archiving those projects you might want to work on again.
The thing about systems for organization is that they’re usually easier to use if they 
exist before you need them. Look at this idea from the other direction: If you don’t 
have an organizational system in the moment you need it—when you have a new 
video clip to put somewhere, for example—you might be too busy to think about 
things like names and file locations. Consequently, it’s common for projects to end 
up with the same name, stored in the same place, with a mix of files that don’t go 
together.
The solution is simple: Make your organizational system in advance. Map it out 
with pen and paper if it helps, and work out the journey you’ll take, starting from 
getting your source media files, moving through your edit, and finishing with out-
put, archiving, and beyond.
In this lesson, you’ll begin by learning about features that help you stay in control, 
without losing focus on what matters most—your creative work.
Then you’ll learn about some positive approaches to collaboration.
1 To begin, open Lesson 17.prproj in the Lesson 17 folder.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Editing to switch to the Editing workspace.
3 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset Current Workspace.
The Reset Workspace dialog opens.
4 Click Yes in the Reset Workspace dialog.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 419
the Project menu
Though most of your creative work can be performed  
using buttons in the interface or keyboard shortcuts, 
some important options are available only in the 
menus. The Project menu gives you access to the 
Project Manager, a tool that automates the process of 
streamlining your project. It also includes options to 
make clips offline, disconnecting the media file from 
the clip.
Project menu commands
The options available under Project Settings are the ones you used to create your 
project. Note that the only thing you can’t change here is the location of the project 
file, though you could easily do that by exiting the project and moving the file using 
Windows Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac OS).
You’ll find some duplication of functionality in the Project menu. Link Media and 
Make Offline are also in the Project panel, when you right-click a clip.
So is Automate to Sequence, a feature you learned about in Lesson 5, “Essentials of 
Video Editing.”
Batch lists are for capturing; see Lesson 3, “Importing Media.”
The Project Manager automates the process of backing up your project and dis-
carding unused media files. We’ll look at the Project Manager in a moment.
The Remove Unused command automatically removes clips from your proj-
ect that are not used in any sequences. This is useful if you’re looking to tidy up 
your project.
making a clip offline
The words offline and online have different meanings in different post-production 
workflows, depending on the context. In the language of Adobe Premiere Pro, they 
refer to the relationship between clips and the media files they link to:
• Online: The clip is linked to a media file.
• Offline: The clip is not linked to a media file.

420 
lesson 17 
managing Your Projects
When a clip is offline, you can still edit it into a sequence, and even apply effects 
to it, but you won’t be able to see any video. Instead, you’ll see the Media Offline 
warning.
In almost all operations, Adobe Premiere Pro is completely nondestructive. This 
means no matter what you do with your clips in your project, nothing will happen 
to the original media files. Making a clip offline is a rare exception to this rule.
If you right-click a clip in the Project panel or go to the Project menu and choose 
Make Offline, you’ll have two options:
• Media Files Remain on Disk: This simply  
unlinks the clip from the media file and 
leaves the media file in place and 
unchanged.
• Media Files Are Deleted: This deletes 
the media file. The effect of deleting the media file is that the clip goes offline, 
because there is no media file to link to anymore.
The benefit of making clips offline is that they can be reconnected with new media. 
If you’ve been working with low-resolution media, this means you can recapture 
tape-based media, or reimport file-based media, at a higher quality.
Working with low-resolution media is sometimes desirable if you have limited disk 
storage or a large number of clips. When your editing work is complete and you’re 
ready for fine-finishing, you can replace your low-resolution, small file-size media 
with selected high-resolution, large file-size media.
Do be careful with the Make Offline option, though! Once your media file is 
deleted, it’s gone. Use the option to delete the actual media file very cautiously.
E Tip: You can make 
multiple clips offline in 
a single step. Just select 
any clips you would like 
to make offline before 
you choose the menu 
option.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 421
using the Project manager
Let’s take a look at the Project Manager. To open it, go to the Project menu and 
choose it.
The Project Manager  
provides several options 
that automate the process 
of streamlining your 
project, or gathering 
together any media files 
you’ve used in your 
project.
It is very useful if you 
intend to archive your 
project or if you want to 
share your project. By 
using the Project Manager 
to gather all of your media 
files, you can be confident 
nothing will be missing—
or offline—when you hand 
the project over to your 
creative colleagues.
The result of using the 
Project Manager is a new, separate project file. Because the new file is independent 
of your current project, it’s safe to try using the Project Manager and double-check 
that everything is fine before you delete anything.
Here’s an overview of the options:
• Source: Select one or all of the sequences in your project. The Project Manager 
will choose clips and media files based on the sequences you select.
• Resulting Project: Create a new project with new media files based only on the 
trimmed parts of clips you have included in your sequence(s), or create a new 
project that has full copies of the clips you have included in your sequence(s).
• Exclude Unused Clips: With this option selected, the new project will not 
include clips you have not used in your selected sequence(s).
• Make Offline: When you choose this option, Adobe Premiere Pro will 
automatically unlink clips captured from tape, so they are ready to be 
recaptured using Batch Capture. This is useful if you originally captured your 
media at low resolution and now want to recapture only the parts you used at 
high quality. This option has no effect on media imported from files.
P Note: Some 
video formats, such 
as XDCAM, cannot 
be trimmed. When 
you create a trimmed 
project that includes 
these formats, full 
copies of media files 
are included.

422 
lesson 17 
managing Your Projects
• Include Handles: This adds the number of frames you specify to the new 
trimmed versions of the clips in your sequence(s). The extra content gives you 
the flexibility to trim and adjust the timing of your edits.
• Include Preview Files: If you have already rendered your effects, you can 
include the preview files with your new project so you won’t need to render the 
effects again.
• Include Audio Conform Files: This includes the audio conform files with 
your project, so Adobe Premiere Pro won’t need to conduct analysis of your 
audio again.
• Rename Media Files to Match Clip Names: As the name implies, this option 
renames your media files to match the clip names in your project. Consider 
carefully if you would like to use this option, because it can make it difficult to 
identify the original source media for your clips.
• Project Destination: Choose a location for your new project.
Working with a trimmed project
To create a new trimmed project file that includes only the parts of the clips you 
have used in your selected sequence(s), do the following:
1 Go to the Project menu and choose Project Manager.
2 Select the sequence(s) you want to be included in your new project.
3 Select Create New Trimmed Project.
4 Choose Exclude Unused Clips, unless you want to be able to recapture or 
reimport files that will now be offline.
5 Select Make Offline if you intend to recapture all tape-based clips. In most 
cases, you will not want to choose this option.
6 Add some handles. The default is one second on each end of the clips used in 
your sequences. Consider adding more if you’d like to have more flexibility to 
trim and adjust your edits in the new project.
7 Decide whether you want to rename your media files. Generally, it’s better to 
leave your media files with the original names. However, if you are producing a 
trimmed project to share it with another editor, it might be helpful for them to 
identify the media files if they are renamed.
8 Click Browse and choose a location for your new project file.
9 Click Calculate to have Adobe Premiere Pro estimate the total new size of your 
project, based on your selections. Then click OK.
The benefit of creating a trimmed project is that you no longer have unwanted 
media files cluttering up your hard drive. It’s a convenient way of transferring your 
P Note: Choosing to 
add 5 or 10 seconds of 
media at each end of 
the clip will do no harm; 
it will just mean your 
media files are a little 
larger.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 423
project to a new location using the absolute minimum amount of storage space, 
and it’s great for archiving.
The danger with this option is that once your unused media files are deleted, 
they’re gone! Be sure that you have a backup of your unused media or that you defi-
nitely do not want to use the media before you create a trimmed project.
When you create your trimmed project, Adobe Premiere Pro will not delete your 
original files. Just in case you selected the wrong items, you can always go back and 
check before manually deleting the files on your hard drive.
Collecting files and copying them to a new location
To collect all of the files used in your selected sequences to a new single location, 
follow these steps:
1 Go to the Project menu and choose Project Manager.
2 Select the sequences you want to be included in your new project.
3 Select Collect Files and Copy to New Location.
4 Choose Exclude Unused Clips. If you want to include every clip in your bins, 
regardless of whether they are used in a sequence, deselect this option. Deselect 
this option if you are creating a new project to organize your media files a 
little better—perhaps because you have imported them from lots of different 
locations. When the new project is created, every media file linked to the 
project will be copied to the new project location.
5 Decide whether you would like to include existing preview files to save you from 
having to rerender your effects in the new project.
6 Decide whether you would like to include Audio Conform Files to save Adobe 
Premiere Pro from having to analyze the audio files again.
7 Decide whether you want to rename your media files. Generally, it’s better to 
leave your media files with the original names. However, if you’re producing a 
project to share it with another editor, it might be helpful for them to identify 
the media files if they are renamed.
8 Click Browse and choose a location for your new project file.
9 Click Calculate to have Adobe Premiere Pro estimate the total new size of your 
project, based on your selections. Then click OK.
Collecting all of your media files this way is very helpful if your media files are 
located in lots of different places and it’s hard to find them. Adobe Premiere Pro 
will make copies of the original files in a single location.
If you intend to create an archive of your entire original project, this is the way 
to do it.

424 
lesson 17 
managing Your Projects
final project management steps
If your goal is to give yourself maximum flexibility to reedit your sequences based 
on the new project, consider using the Remove Unused option, available under the 
Project menu, before you use the Project Manager.
Remove Unused will leave you with only those clips currently used in sequences. 
However, unlike the option to create a trimmed project file, when you use the 
Project Manager to collect your files to a new location, the entire original media file 
will be copied. This is perhaps the best of both worlds, balancing hard drive space 
with creative flexibility when working on the newly created project.
Importing projects or sequences
As well as importing many kinds of media files, Adobe Premiere Pro can import 
sequences from existing projects, along with all of the clips used to create them.
You can try it now:
1 Use any method you prefer to import a new media file. If you double-click a 
black area in the Project panel, the Import dialog will appear.
2 Select the file Sunset.prproj in the Lesson 17 folder, and click Import.
The Import Project dialog appears, with just  
two options:
•
Import Entire Project: This imports every 
sequence in the project you are importing and 
every clip already imported into a bin.
•
Import Selected Sequences: This allows you 
to select the specific sequence you would like 
to import. Only clips used in that sequence will be imported.
3 The project you’re importing has only one sequence, so leave Import Entire 
Project selected, and click OK.
Adobe Premiere Pro adds a new bin to the project, containing the sequence that 
has been imported, and further bins containing the clips used in the sequence.
This is a nice way to work because Adobe Premiere Pro has automatically organized 
the new clips for you, based on the project you imported.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 425
managing collaboration
Being able to import other projects unlocks novel workflows and opportunities for 
collaboration. You could, for example, share work on different parts of a program 
between different editors, all using the same media assets. Then, one editor could 
import all of the other projects to combine them into a completed sequence.
Project files are small—usually small enough to email. This allows editors to email 
each other updated project files, open them and compare, or import them to do a 
side-by-side comparison in the project, provided that each editor has a copy of the 
same media files.
Remember, you can also add markers with comments to a Timeline, so when 
updating a sequence, consider adding a marker to highlight changes for your 
collaborators.
Be warned: Adobe Premiere Pro does not lock project files when they are in use. 
This means two people can access the same project file at the same time. This 
could be creatively dangerous! As one person saves the file, it updates. As the next 
person saves the file, it updates again. Whoever saves the project file last defines 
the file. If you intend to collaborate, it would be better to work on separate project 
files and import.
There are several dedicated media servers made by third parties that help you to 
collaborate using shared media files. These allow you to store and manage your 
media in a way that is accessible by multiple editors at the same time.
Keep these key questions in mind:
• Who has the latest version of the edited sequence?
• Where are the media files stored?
As long as you have simple answers to these questions, you should be able to col-
laborate and share creative work using Adobe Premiere Pro.
managing your hard drives
Once you’ve used the Project Manager to create a new copy of your project or 
you have completed your project and finished with its media, you’ll want to clean 
up your drives. Video files are big. Even with very large storage drives, you’ll quickly 
need to think about which media files you want to keep and which you want 
to discard.
To make it easier to remove unwanted media when you have finished a project, 
consider importing all media files via your project folder or via a specific location 
on your media drive for your project. This means putting copies of your media 

426 
lesson 17 
managing Your Projects
into a single location before importing because, when you import media, Adobe 
Premiere Pro creates a link to it wherever it is on your computer.
By organizing media files before you import them, you’ll find it much easier to 
remove unwanted content at the end of the creative workflow, because everything 
is conveniently located in one place.
Remember that deleting clips in a project, or even deleting the project file itself, 
will not delete any media files.
additional files
The media cache uses storage space as you import new media files to your projects. 
Also, each time you render effects, Adobe Premiere Pro creates preview files.
To remove these files and reclaim extra space on your hard drive, do the following:
• Choose Edit > Preferences > Media (Windows) or Premiere Pro > Preferences > 
Media (Mac OS), and click Clean in the Media Cache Database section.
• Delete render files associated with your current project by choosing Sequence > 
Delete Render Files. Alternatively, locate your Preview Files folder by checking 
under Project > Project Settings > Scratch Disks. Then delete the folder and its 
contents using Windows Explorer (Windows) or Finder (Mac OS).
Consider carefully when choosing the location of the media cache and your project 
preview files. The total size of these files can be significant.
media management  
with Dynamic Link
Dynamic Link allows Adobe Premiere Pro to use After Effects compositions 
as imported media while they are still editable in After Effects. To do this, 
Adobe Premiere Pro must have access to the After Effects project file that con-
tains the composition, and After Effects must have access to the media files used 
in the composition.
While working on a single computer with both applications installed and your 
media assets located on internal storage, this is achieved automatically.
If you use the Project Manager to collect files for a new Adobe Premiere Pro project, 
it will not bring copies of Dynamic Link files. Instead, you will need to make copies 
of the files yourself, in Windows or Mac OS. If you have created your Dynamic Link 
projects in a single unified location, this is very easy to do; just copy the folder and 
include it with the assets collected already.

review questions
1 Why would you choose to make a clip offline?
2 Why would you choose to include handles when creating a trimmed project with the 
Project Manager?
3 Why would you choose the Project Manager option called Collect Files and Copy to a 
New Location?
4 What does the Remove Unused option in the Project menu achieve?
5 How can you import a sequence from another Adobe Premiere Pro project?
6 Will the Project Manager collect Dynamic Link assets, such as After Effects 
compositions, when creating a new project?
review answers
1 If you’re working with low-resolution copies of your media files, you’ll want to make 
your clips offline so you can recapture them or reimport them.
2 Trimmed projects include only the parts of your clips used in sequences. To give 
yourself some flexibility, you’d add handles; 24 frame handles would actually add 48 
frames to the total duration of each clip, because one handle is added at the beginning 
and end of each clip.
3 If you have imported media files from lots of different locations on your computer, it 
can be difficult to find everything and stay organized. By using the Project Manager 
to collect all of the media files into one location, you’ll make it easier to manage your 
project media files.
4 When you choose Remove Unused, Adobe Premiere Pro removes any clips from your 
project that are not used in a sequence. Remember, no media files are deleted.
5 To import a sequence from another Adobe Premiere Pro project, import the project 
file as you would import any media file. Adobe Premiere Pro will invite you to import 
the entire project or selected sequences.
6 The Project Manager does not collect Dynamic Link assets when creating a new 
project. For this reason, it’s a good idea to create any new Dynamic Link projects in the 
same location as your project folder or in a dedicated folder for your project. This way, 
it is easier to locate and copy the assets for the new project.

Exporting your project is the final step in the video

QuickTime, and MPEG formats. Within those formats 
you have dozens of options and can also export 
in batches.

lesson 18 
exporting Frames, Clips, and sequences
Getting started
One of the best things about editing video is the feeling you have when you can 
finally share it with your audience. Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 offers a wide range of 
export options—methods of recording your projects to tape or converting them to 
additional digital files.
Increasingly, the primary form of distribution is the use of digital files. To create 
these files, you can use Adobe Media Encoder. Adobe Media Encoder is a stand-
alone application that handles exports in batches, so you can export in several 
formats simultaneously and process in the background while you work in other 
applications, including Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe After Effects.
P Note: Adobe Premiere Pro can export clips selected in the Project panel, as well as sequences 
or Work Areas within sequences. The content that’s selected when you choose File > Export is what 
Adobe Premiere Pro will export. Be sure to exercise care and make sure that the item you want to 
export is selected so you do not waste precious time rendering content from the Project panel 
rather than your sequence.
overview of export options
Whether you’ve completed a project (or just want to share an in-progress review), 
you have a number of export options:
• You can select a whole sequence as a single file to post to the Web or burn to 
a disc.
• You can export a single frame or a series of frames to post to the Web or attach 
to an e-mail.
• You can choose audio-only, video-only, or full audio/video output.
• You can export directly to videotape.
Beyond the actual export formats, you can set several other parameters as well:
• You can choose to create files at the same visual quality and data rate as your 
original media, or you can compress them.
• You may need to specify the frame size, frame rate, data rate, or audio and video 
compression techniques if a particular preset doesn’t fit your needs precisely.
You can use exported files for further editing, in presentations, as streaming media 
for Internet and other networks, or as sequences of images to create animations.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 431
exporting single frames
While an edit is in progress, you may want to quickly export a still frame to 
send to a team member or client to review. Additionally, you could choose to 
export a specific thumbnail image to use as the thumbnail of your video file when 
you post it to the Web. Adobe Premiere Pro offers a simplified workflow for still-
image export. 
Let’s look at the Export Frame function. To select a frame, simply place the play-
head over the frame you want to use. You can use the Export Frame function in 
two ways:
• You can load a clip from the Project panel into the Source Monitor. When using 
the Export Frame function from the Source panel, Adobe Premiere Pro will 
create a still image that matches the resolution of the source video file.
• You can move the playhead in the Timeline or Program Monitor to choose 
a frame. When using the Export Frame function from the Timeline, Adobe 
Premiere Pro will create a still image that matches the resolution of the selected 
video sequence.
Let’s give it a try.
1 Start Adobe Premiere Pro, and open Lesson 18_01.prproj.
2 Click somewhere in the Review Copy Timeline to select the sequence.

3 In the Program Monitor, click the Export Frame button on the lower right.
If you don’t see the button, it may be because you’ve customized the panel’s 
buttons. You can press Shift+E to manually invoke the command.
4 In the Export Frame dialog, enter the desired filename.
5 Using the pop-up menu, choose the correct still-image format for your needs. 
•
JPEG, PNG, BMP, and GIF work well for compressed graphic workflows (like 
web delivery).
•
TIFF and Targa are suitable for print and animation workflows. 
•
DPX is often used for digital cinema or color-grading workflows.
6 Click the Browse button to open the Browse for Folder dialog. Create a new 
folder on the desktop and select it.
7 Click OK to export the frame.
P Note: In Windows, you can export to the BMP, DPX, GIF, JPEG, PNG, TGA, and TIFF formats. On the 
Mac, you can export to the DPX, JPEG, PNG, TGA, and TIFF formats.

exporting a master copy
Creating a master copy allows you to make a pristine digital copy of your edited 
project that can be archived for future use. A master copy is a self-contained digital 
file that contains all of the content of your sequence at its highest resolution and 
best quality. Once created, you can then use that file to produce other compressed 
output formats.
matching sequence settings
Ideally, your master file will closely match the settings (frame size, frame rate, and 
codec) as the primary material in your sequence. Adobe Premiere Pro makes this 
fairly easy, because you can choose to match sequence settings, which makes it 
simple to create a file that matches your edit. There is no guesswork, provided you 
chose the right sequence preset (or let your sequence autoconform). Let’s give it a try.
1 Continue working with Review Copy in Lesson 18_01.prproj.
2 With the sequence selected (in either the Project or Timeline panel), choose 
File > Export > Media.
The Export Settings dialog opens. We’ll explore this interface in-depth later in 
this lesson.
3 In the Export Settings dialog, select 
Match Sequence Settings.
P Note: In some cases, 
the Match Settings 
option cannot write 
an exact match of the 
original camera media. 
For example, XDCAM EX 
will write to a generic 
MPEG2 file. In most 
cases, the file written 
will have an identical 
format and closely 
match the data rate of 
the original sources.

4 Click the gold hypertext for the Output Name option to choose a target.
5 Choose a target (such as the Lesson 18 folder), and name the sequence 
Review Copy 01.mxf. 
6 Click Save.
7 Examine the text in the Summary area to confirm that the output format 
matches the sequence settings. In this case, you should be using DVCPRO HD 
media (as MXF files) at 23.976fps.
8 Click the Export button to write a single file, which is a digital clone of the 
sequence.
E Tip: If your sequence to export has a lot of items that are scaled (such as photos or mixed-
resolution video), you can use the Maximum Render Quality option. This is much slower but 
produces excellent results.
Choosing another codec
When you export a project as a self-contained movie, you can change the codec 
that is used. Some camera formats (such as DSLR and HDV) are heavily com-
pressed. Using a higher-quality mastering codec can improve the quality of the 
master file you created.
Many popular third-party codecs such as ProRes, Avid DNXHD, and Cineform 
can be installed and used. These codecs may require a purchase, can come bundled 
with third-party hardware, or in some cases can be downloaded for free.
1 Use the same project as the previous exercise.
2 Choose File > Export > Media or press Control+M (Windows) or Command+M 
(Mac OS).
3 In the Export Settings dialog, click the Format pop-up menu and choose 
QuickTime as the format.
4 Click the output name (the gold text), and give the file a new name, 
Review Copy 02.mov. Save it to the same destination as the previous exercise.
5 Click the Video tab near the bottom of the window.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 435
6 Choose a mastering codec that you have installed. 
One option that should be installed on your system is the Animation codec. 
This file produces a very high-quality (but large) file. Check the frame size and 
frame rate to match your source settings. You may need to scroll the window or 
resize the panel to make it easier to see. Use the settings you see here.
7 Click the Audio tab and choose Uncompressed for the audio codec. In the Basic 
Audio Settings section, choose 48000 Hz as the sample rate, Stereo for Channels, 
and 16 bit for Sample Size. 
8 Click the Export button at the bottom of the dialog to export the sequence and 
transcode it to the specified file format. 
Working with adobe media encoder
Adobe Media Encoder is a stand-alone application that can run independently or 
can be launched from Adobe Premiere Pro. One advantage to using Adobe Media 
Encoder is that you can submit a job directly from Adobe Premiere Pro and then 
continue working as the encoding is processed.
P Note: The JPEG 2000 
option is another good 
cross-platform choice 
to create high-quality 
files for archiving. On a 
Windows machine, you 
can also explore some 
of the high-quality AVI 
presets.
P Note: The 
Animation codec is very 
high-quality but cannot 
be viewed in real time 
without an extremely 
fast disk array.

436 
lesson 18 
exporting Frames, Clips, and sequences
Choosing a file format for export
Adobe Premiere Pro and Adobe Media 
Encoder can export in a number of for-
mats; let’s run through them quickly to 
identify when you should use them.
• AAC Audio: The Advanced Audio 
Coding format is the audio-only 
format that is often used with most 
H.264 encoding.
• Audio Interchange File Format: This 
is an audio-only file format popular on 
the Mac.
• DPX: DPX stands for Digital 
Picture Exchange and is a high-end 
image sequence format for digital 
intermediate and special-effects work.
• F4V: This is a newer version of the Flash video format, which is a popular way to 
distribute video online. F4V files use the H.264 video codec/AAC audio codec.
• FLV: This is the more compatible Flash video format for use with older 
computers. FLV files use the VP6 video codec/MP3 audio codec.
• H.264: This is the most flexible and widely used format today, with options for 
devices such as the iPod and Apple TV, TiVo Series3 SD and HD, and services 
such as YouTube and Vimeo. H.264 files produced via this option can also be 
transmitted to smartphones, such as Android, Blackberry, and iPhone devices, 
or used as high-quality, high-bit-rate intermediate files for working in other 
video editors. 
• H.264 Blu-ray: This option produces H.264 files specifically for Blu-ray Discs.
• JPEG: This setting will create a sequential series of images at the target 
destination.
• MP3: This compressed audio format is very popular on the Internet.
• MPEG2: This older file format is primarily used for DVD and Blu-ray Discs. 
Presets in this group allow you to produce files that can be distributed for 
playback on your own or other computers. Some broadcasters also use MPEG2 
as a format for digital delivery.
• MPEG2 Blu-ray: This will create a Blu-ray-compliant MPEG2 video and audio 
file from your HD material.
• MPEG2-DVD: Use this preset to create standard-definition DVDs.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 437
• MPEG4: Selecting this codec produces lower-quality H.263 3GP files for 
distribution to older cell phones.
• MXF OP1a: These presets let you create files compatible with Sony’s IMX and 
XDCAM (other than EX) systems.
• P2 Movie: This output option is used for rendering sequences back to P2 cards.
• PNG: This is a lossless but efficient still-image format for Internet use or for 
image sequences that contain transparency.
• QuickTime: This container format can store files using multiple codecs. 
All QuickTime files use the .mov extension, and it is the preferred format for 
use on Macintosh computers.
• Targa: This is a rarely used uncompressed still-image file format.
• TIFF: This popular high-quality still-image format offers both lossy and lossless 
compression options.
• Waveform Audio: This uncompressed audio file format is popular on Windows 
computers using the .wav formats.
The following formats are available only on Windows: 
• Microsoft AVI: This “container format,” available only in the Windows version 
of Adobe Premiere Pro, can store files using multiple compression technologies, 
or codecs. While not officially supported by Microsoft for a number of years, it is 
still in widespread use in Windows systems primarily for large intermediate files 
within an editing project, such as renders transferred between applications in a 
Window-only environment. It is rarely, if ever, used for distribution of video files 
to the public.
• Windows Bitmap: This is an uncompressed, rarely used still-image format with 
a .bmp extension. It’s available only on the Windows version of Adobe Premiere 
Pro.
• Animated GIF and GIF: These compressed still-image and animated formats 
are used primarily on the Web. They’re available only on the Windows version 
of Adobe Premiere Pro.
• Uncompressed Microsoft AVI: This is a very high-bit-rate intermediate format 
that is not widely used and is available only on the Windows version of Adobe 
Premiere Pro.
• Windows Media: This option produces WMV files for playback using the 
Windows Media Player and is used in some playout server applications and is 
ideal for Microsoft Silverlight applications (Windows only).
That’s only a brief overview of the formats, but it should provide some useful direc-
tion when it’s time to produce your videos.

438 
lesson 18 
exporting Frames, Clips, and sequences
using the formats
Adobe Media Encoder supports many formats. Knowing which setting to use can seem a little over-
whelming. Let’s take a look at some common scenarios and review which formats are typically used. 
While there are few absolutes, these should get you close to the correct output. Be sure to always test 
your output with a short file first before going live with it.
•
Uploading to a website for Flash deployment: When you choose the FLV|F4V format, choose 
an FLV preset for producing the file with the older On2 VP6 codec, and choose F4V for the newer, 
higher-quality H.264 format. If you don’t know which format to use, go with F4V. In terms of 
resolution, the 720p Source, Half Size presets in both F4V and FLV formats encode your video at 
740 x 360 (for HD source), which is a conservative resolution that should look quite good. Check 
with your web administrator for the format, resolution, data rate, and other details.
•
Encoding for DVD/Blu-ray: Generally, you’ll use MPEG2 for both—namely, MPEG2-DVD for DVD 
and MPEG2 Blu-ray for Blu-ray Discs. MPEG2 looks indistinguishable from H.264 in these high-
bit-rate applications and will encode much, much faster. However, the H.264 format can let you 
fit more content in a smaller space. Better yet, input your sequence without rendering in Encore 
(choose File > Adobe Dynamic Link > Import Adobe Premiere Pro Sequence).
•
Encoding for devices: Use the H.264 format for current devices (Apple iPod/iPhone, Apple TV, 
and TiVo), as well as some generic 3GPP presets; use MPEG4 for older MPEG4-based devices. Be 
sure to check the manufacturer’s specifications on their website, and make sure the files that you 
produce don’t exceed these specs. 
•
Encoding for uploading to user-generated video sites: H.264 has presets for YouTube and 
Vimeo in widescreen, SD, and HD. Use these presets as a starting point for your service, being 
careful to observe resolution, file size, and duration limits.
•
Windows Media or Silverlight deployment: The Windows Media format is your safest option, 
though more recent versions of Silverlight can play H.264 files. If producing H.264 for Silverlight, 
follow the Flash rules provided earlier, since Silverlight should play any file produced for Flash.
In general, the Adobe Premiere Pro presets are proven and will work for your intended purpose. Don’t 
adjust parameters when encoding for devices or optical discs, because changes that seem subtle can 
render the files unplayable. Even with other presets, resist the urge to tinker unless you know what 
you’re doing from an encoding perspective. Most Adobe Premiere Pro presets are conservative and 
will deliver very good quality using the default values, so you probably won’t improve the output by 
tinkering, and you could even degrade it considerably.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 439
Configuring the export
To export from Adobe Premiere Pro with Adobe Media Encoder, you’ll need to 
queue the project. The first step of this involves using the Export Settings dialog to 
make initial choices about the file you’re going to export.
1 If necessary, open Lesson 18_01.prproj.
2 Choose File > Export > Media.
It’s best to work through the Export Settings dialog from the top down, first 
choosing your format and presets, then picking the output, and finally deciding 
whether you’d like to export audio, video, or both.
3 Choose the H.264 format from the Format preset. This format is a popular 
choice for creating files for uploading to video-sharing websites. Choose the 
YouTube HD 720p 23.976 preset.
This correctly loads the settings that match the frame size and frame rate 
of the source footage. It also adjusts the codec and data rate to match the 
requirements of the YouTube website.
4 Click the output name (the gold text), and give the file a new name, 
Review Copy 03.mov. Save it to the same destination as the previous exercise.
5 Examine the Summary below the preset lists to see the effects of choices so far. 
Note that the tabs presented on the bottom right of the Export Settings dialog 
will vary by format. Most of the critical options are contained on the Format, 
Video, and Audio tabs, and the options here will vary by format as well. Here’s 
an overview of the various tabs:
•
Filters: The filter available for encoded output is Gaussian Blur. Enabling 
this filter reduces the video noise introduced by slightly blurring the video. 
Export the project without this filter to see whether noise is a problem. If 
it is, increase noise reduction in small amounts. Increasing noise reduction 

440 
lesson 18 
exporting Frames, Clips, and sequences
too much will make the video blurry. Judicious use of Gaussian Blur is often 
a very good way to reduce a file’s bit rate (particularly with very detailed 
high-resolution material that is scaled down considerably for distribution). 
It can remove some of the excessive fine detail that can result in “ringing” or 
“shimmering.” 
•
Video: The Video tab allows you to adjust the frame size, frame rate, field 
order, and profile. The default values are based on the preset you chose. 
•
Audio: The Audio tab allows you to adjust the bit rate of the audio and, for 
some formats, the codec. The default values are based on the preset you chose.
•
Multiplexer: These controls let you determine whether the encoding 
method is optimized for compatibility with a specific device (like an iPod or 
PlayStation Portable).
•
FTP: This tab primarily allows you to specify an FTP server for uploading 
the exported video when it is finished encoding. Fill in the appropriate FTP 
values supplied by your FTP host if you want to enable this feature.
source and output panels
Moving to the left side of the Export Settings dialog, look over the Source Range 
drop-down list, where you can choose to export the Work Area bar selected in 
the sequence, a range you selected by placing an In point and an Out point on your 
sequence, a region selected using the handles directly above the drop-down list, or 
the entire sequence. This is useful when you want to export selected regions on the 
Timeline rather than the entire sequence.
Also on the left, note the Source/Output tabs, the latter of which shows a preview 
of the video to be encoded. It’s useful to view the video on the Output tab to catch 
errors such as unwanted letterboxing or distortion caused by the irregularly shaped 
pixels used in some video formats.
queuing the export
When you’re ready to export your 
sequence or selected range, you’ll 
need to look over a few last items 
that will determine important 
details about your exported file. 
Be sure to closely analyze the impact of each of these settings on your export.
• Use Maximum Render Quality: Consider enabling this setting whenever 
scaling from larger to smaller formats during rendering, but note that this option 
requires more RAM than normal rendering and can slow rendering by a factor 
of four or five. This option is not often needed except in situations that involve 
scaling and where the highest-quality output is needed.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 441
• Use Previews: This option uses previews created while producing your project 
as the starting point for the final rendered file, rather than rendering all video 
and effects from scratch. This can shorten encoding time but can also degrade 
quality when rendering to a format different from your sequence preset. Use 
this option when you need only draft-quality output and you’re in a big rush.
• Use Frame Blending: Enable this option to smooth motion whenever you 
change the speed of a source clip in your project or render to a different frame 
rate than your sequence setting.
• Metadata: Click this button to open the Metadata Export panel. You can 
specify a wide range of settings including information about copyright, creator, 
and rights management. You can even embed useful information such as 
markers, script, and speech transcription for advanced delivery options like 
Flash authoring.
• Queue: Click the Queue button to send the file to Adobe Media Encoder, which 
should open automatically.
• Export: Select this option to export directly from the Export Settings dialog 
rather than rendering via Adobe Media Encoder. This is a simpler workflow, but 
you won’t be able to edit in Adobe Premiere Pro until the rendering is complete.
Click the Queue button to launch Adobe Media Encoder and submit the file.
P Note: On the Video 
tab you’ll also find a 
Render at Maximum 
Depth check box. This 
can improve the visual 
quality of your output 
by using a wider gamut 
to generate colors when 
rendering. However, 
choosing this option 
can add significantly to 
the render time.

442 
lesson 18 
exporting Frames, Clips, and sequences
additional options in adobe media encoder
Working with Adobe Media Encoder has several additional benefits. While it 
involves a few extra steps over just clicking the Export button in the Export Settings 
panel of Adobe Premiere Pro, the extra options are worth it.
Here are some of the most useful features you’ll find in Adobe Media Encoder:
• Add additional stand-alone files: You can add stand-alone files to Adobe Media 
Encoder by choosing File > Add Source.
• Import Adobe Premiere Pro projects directly: You can choose File > Add 
Premiere Pro Sequence to select an Adobe Premiere Pro project file and choose 
sequences (without ever launching Adobe Premiere Pro).
• Render After Effects Projects: You can import and encode compositions from 
Adobe After Effects by choosing File > Add After Effects Composition. This 
method is similar to the previous in that you don’t need to open Adobe After 
Effects.
• Use a Watch Folder: If you’d like to automate some encoding tasks, you can 
create watch folders by choosing File > Add Watch Folder and then assigning 
a preset to that watch folder. Source files dragged into the folder later will be 
automatically encoded to the format specified in the preset.
• Modify an item: You can add, duplicate, or remove any tasks by using the 
like-named buttons and drag any tasks that haven’t yet started encoding to 
any place in the queue. If you haven’t set the queue to start automatically, click 
the Start Queue button to start encoding. Adobe Media Encoder encodes files 
serially, rather than in parallel, and if you add any files to the queue after starting 
encoding, they’ll be encoded as well.
P Note: Adobe Media 
Encoder does not have 
to be used from Adobe 
Premiere Pro. You can 
start Adobe Media 
Encoder from your list 
of Adobe programs 
and add files to it that 
already exist on your 
file system. 

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 443
• Modify presets: You can choose a format/preset separately with each approach. 
Once the encoding tasks are loaded into Adobe Media Encoder, administration 
is straightforward. To change any encoding setting, click the target task and then 
the Settings button on the right.
exchanging with other editing applications
The need for collaboration is often essential in video post-production. Fortunately, 
Adobe Premiere Pro can both read and write project files that are compatible with 
many of the top editing and color-grading tools on the market. 
exporting a final Cut Pro xmL file
The use of Final Cut Pro XML allows you to exchange an Adobe Premiere Pro proj-
ect with many applications. You can bring your project directly into Final Cut Pro 7 
and 6 or convert it to Final Cut Pro X using 7toX for Final Cut Pro from Assisted 
Editing. You can also export your project to other applications such as Davinci 
Resolve and Grass Valley Edius. At a high level, exporting from Adobe Premiere 
Pro to Final Cut Pro—and importing the XML file into Final Cut Pro—is simple.
1 To begin, in Adobe Premiere Pro, choose File > Export > Final Cut Pro XML. 
Click Yes to save your project.
2 In the Final Cut Pro XML - Save Converted Project As dialog, name the file, 
choose a location, and click Save. Adobe Premiere Pro will let you know 
whether there were any issues exporting the XML.
This file can now be imported into another application. You will likely need to 
import or capture the media into the other application and relink it.
OMF
The Open Media Framework 
(OMF) has become a standard way 
of exchanging audio information 
between systems (typically for 
audio mixing). When you export 
an OMF file, the typical method 
is to create a single file with all 
your audio tracks inside. When the 
OMF file is open by a compatible 
application, it will show all of the tracks.

444 
lesson 18 
exporting Frames, Clips, and sequences
Here’s how to create an OMF file:
1 With a sequence selected, choose File > Export > OMF. 
2 Enter a name for the file in the OMF Title field.
3 Check that the Sample Rate and Bits per Sample settings match your footage; 
48000 Hz and 16 bits are the most common settings.
4 From the Files menu, choose one of the following:
•
Encapsulate: This option exports an OMF file that contains the project 
metadata and all the audio for the selected sequence. Encapsulated OMF 
files typically are large.
•
Separate Audio: This option exports individual mono AIFF files into an 
omfiMediaFiles folder.
5 If using the Separate Audio option, choose between the AIFF and Eave formats. 
Both are high-quality, but check with the system you need to exchange with. 
AIFF files tend to be the most compatible.
6 Using the Render menu, choose either to use Copy Complete Audio Files or to 
use the Trim Audio Files to reduce the file size. You can specify to add handles 
(extra frames) to give you some flexibility when modifying the clips.
7 Click OK to generate the OMF file.
8 Choose a destination, and click Save. You can target your lesson folder for now.
AAF
Another way to exchange files is the Advanced Authoring 
Format (AAF). This method is typically used to exchange 
both project information and source media with Avid 
Media Composer.
1 Choose File > Export > AAF.
2 In the AAF - Save Converted Project As dialog box, choose a location and 
click Save.
3 In the AAF Export Settings dialog box, you have two additional choices.
•
Save as legacy AAF: This makes a file more compatible but doesn’t support 
as many features.
•
Embed audio: This option attempts to embed audio into the file to reduce 
the need for relinking. 
4 Click OK in order to save the sequence to an AAF file at the specified location. 
The AAF Export Log dialog box opens to report any issues.

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 445
Working with edit decision lists
An edit decision list (EDL) harkens back to the days 
when small hard drives limited the size of your video 
files and slower processors meant you could not play 
full-resolution video. To remedy this, editors used 
low-resolution files in a nonlinear editor like Adobe 
Premiere Pro, edited their project, exported that to 
an EDL, and then took that text file and their original 
tapes down to a production studio. There they would 
use expensive switching hardware to create the fin-
ished, full-resolution product.
These days, there isn’t much call for that kind of offline 
work, but filmmakers still use EDLs because of the size 
of the files and other complexities associated with going from film to video and back to film.
If you plan to use an EDL, you need to keep your project within some narrow guidelines:
•
EDLs work best with projects that contain no more than one video track, two stereo (or four 
mono) audio tracks, and no nested sequences.
•
Most standard transitions, freeze frames, and clip-speed changes work well in EDLs.
•
Adobe Premiere Pro supports a key track for titles or other content. That track has to be 
immediately above the video track selected for export.
•
You must capture and log all the source material with accurate timecode information.
•
The capture card must have a device control that uses a timecode.
•
Videotapes must each have a unique reel number and be formatted with the timecode before you 
shoot the video to ensure there are no breaks in the timecode.
To view the EDL options of Adobe Premiere Pro, choose File > Export > EDL, which opens the EDL 
Export Settings dialog.
Your options are as follows:
•
EDL Title: This specifies a title to appear in the first line of the EDL file. The title can be different 
from the filename. After clicking OK in the EDL Export Settings dialog, you will have the 
opportunity to enter a filename.
•
Start Timecode: Here you set the starting timecode value for the first edit in the sequence.
•
Include Video Levels: This includes video opacity-level comments in the EDL.
•
Include Audio Levels: This includes audio-level comments in the EDL.
•
Audio Processing: Here you specify when audio processing should occur. Options are Audio 
Follows Video, Audio Separately, and Audio At End.
•
Tracks To Export: This specifies which tracks to export. The video track directly above the video 
track selected for export is designated as the key track.

446 
lesson 18 
exporting Frames, Clips, and sequences
send to adobe speedGrade
Adobe offers its own robust color-grading utility called SpeedGrade that is 
included with the Creative Suite Production Premium software families. It offers 
a comprehensive tool set for manipulating and improving color. You should send 
files to Adobe SpeedGrade only when you’re near the very end of a project and 
you have “picture lock” and merely want to improve your program. You should not 
use SpeedGrade when you still intend to make edits to the content or duration of 
your project.
1
Choose File > Save to capture any changes in your sequence.
2
Choose File > Send to Adobe SpeedGrade.
3
In the new dialog box, choose a destination to save the new file.
4
Click Save when ready.
A new project file is generated, and an image sequence (using the DPX file 
format) is created for each clip in your project. 
recording to tape
While tape is becoming less and less common, there still are industries and parts 
of the world where it is the preferred output method. For example, many broad-
casters require master tapes on formats like HDCAM SR or DVCPRO HD. If you 
shot on a format like DV or HDV, going back out to tape is a popular choice to 
back up the project.
If you own a tape deck or camera, you can use the project Lesson 18_02.prproj. 
This contains both a DV and HDV sequence that can be output.
Preparing a project for tape output
To play a project out to tape, you need to be able to play back the sequence per-
fectly. This means no dropped frames or untendered effects. You’ll need to ensure 
that you have fast enough hard drives and a well-tuned machine. Here are a few 
other details to check:
• Device Control settings: Make sure Adobe Premiere Pro can see your 
recording deck. Open Adobe Premiere Pro Preferences and choose Device 
Control. In the Devices menu, choose the appropriate type of device control for 
your deck. Click the Options button and attempt to match your device as close 

Adobe Premiere Pro Cs6 ClAssroom in A book 447
as possible. If you’re using a professional deck or capture card, you may need to 
install additional drivers.
• Audio channel assignments: You should check that your audio channels in 
the sequence are assigned to the correct output. Some decks like DV allow 
for only two channels of audio, while other formats can support 4, 8, or even 
16 channels. Using the Audio Mixer, you can assign each audio track in your 
sequence to a specific output.
Preparing a tape for output
To record to tape, you need to prepare the tape first. Typically, this is called striping
or blacking a tape. This process sets the timecode on the tape and ensures that it is 
ready to record to.
This process varies greatly from deck to deck, so be sure to see the owner’s manual 
of your hardware. It is common to start a tape at 00:58:00:00 to accommodate bars, 
tone, slate information, and a countdown. The primary video will typically start at 
exactly 1:00:00:00.

448 
lesson 18

recording to a DV or hDV deck
Out of the box, Adobe Premiere Pro has the ability to connect to a DV or HDV 
deck. If you captured your original video from DV or HDV tape, you may want to 
write the finished project back to tape for safekeeping. If so, follow the steps listed 
here:
1 Connect your DV or HDV camcorder to your computer, just as you did when 
you captured the video.
2 Turn it on, and set it to VCR or VTR (not to Camera, as you might expect).
3
Cue the tape to where you want to start recording.
4
Select the sequence you want to record.

Choose File > Export > Tape.
If you’re working with a DV camcorder, you’ll 
see the Export to Tape dialog shown here.
Here’s a rundown of the options:
•
Activate Recording Device: When you 
select this option, Adobe Premiere Pro 
will control your DV device. Deselect it if 
you want to record to a device that you’ll 
control manually.
•
Assemble at timecode: Select this option 
to pick an In point on the tape where you 
want recording to begin. When this option 
is not selected, recording will begin at the current tape location.
•
Delay movie start by x frames: This is for the few DV recording devices 
that need a brief period of time between receiving the video signal and 
recording it. Check your device’s manual to see what the manufacturer 
recommends.
•
Preroll x frames: Most decks need little or no time to get to the proper 
tape-recording speed. To be on the safe side, select 150 frames (5 seconds), 
or add black video to the start of your project.
The remaining options are self-explanatory.
6 Click Record (or Cancel if you don’t want to make a recording).
If you haven’t rendered your project (by pressing Enter [Windows] or Return 
[Mac OS] for playback instead of the spacebar), Adobe Premiere Pro does that 
now. When rendering is complete, Adobe Premiere Pro starts your camcorder 
and records your project to it.

using third-party hardware
Video Input/Output devices are available from several companies such as AJA, 
Blackmagic Design, Bluefish444, and Matrox. These cards let you connect profes-
sional-quality video decks to your computer. 
The following features are useful when working with professional decks:
• SD/HD-SDI: Serial Digital Interface (SDI) carries standard-definition or high-
definition video and up to 16 channels of digital audio. Over a single cable, you 
can output your video to a deck, as well as all of the audio that you might need. 
• Component video: Some decks still rely on other connection types. You 
can use component video for both analog (Y’PrPb) and digital (Y’CbCr) 
connections. Component connections can carry only a video signal, not audio. 
• AES and XLR audio: If you’re not relying on an embedded SDI audio signal, 
then many decks also offer dedicated audio connections. The two most 
common are AES (either XLR OR BNC types) or analog XLR audio. 
• RS-422 deck control: Professional decks employ a type of device control 
known as RS-422. This serial connection is used for frame-accurate control 
of the deck.

review questions
1 What are the main formats for exporting digital video if you want to be able to edit the 
files in the future?
2 What Internet-ready media options are available in Adobe Media Encoder?
3 What encoding format should you use when exporting to most mobile devices?
4 Must you wait for Adobe Media Encoder to finish processing its queue before working 
on a new project?
5 When you click Record in the Export to Tape dialog, your camcorder remains paused. 
What’s going on?
review answers
1 The primary options for SD are Microsoft DV AVI and QuickTime MOV in DV 
format. For HD files, try producing a file using the Match Sequence Settings option, 
or use a third-party codec.
2 This varies by platform. Both operating systems include Flash (FLV|F4V), H.264, and 
QuickTime, with the Windows version including Windows Media as well.
3 H.264 is the encoding format used when exporting to most mobile devices.
4 No. Adobe Media Encoder is a stand-alone application. You can work in other 
applications or even start a new Adobe Premiere Pro project while it’s processing its 
render queue.
5 Before Adobe Premiere Pro can start recording a project to tape, it has to render it. You 
can do that in advance by opening a sequence and pressing Return or Enter. Otherwise, 
when you click the Record button, you’ll have to wait a while for Adobe Premiere Pro to 
process any unrendered portions of your sequence.

Lesson 19 
Authoring DVDs with Adobe encore
In this lesson, you’ll learn how to navigate the Adobe Encore CS6 interface and use 
a sequence created in Adobe Premiere Pro CS6 to produce a DVD, Blu-ray Disc, or 
web DVD.
getting started
The use of file-based video delivery is definitely growing, but there remains huge 
demand for DVDs and Blu-ray Discs. Adobe Encore is a powerful but user-friendly 
DVD and Blu-ray Disc authoring application and is included with Adobe Premiere 
Pro. Adobe Encore can share media assets with Adobe Premiere Pro, thanks to 
Dynamic Link, in the same way that Adobe Premiere Pro can share compositions 
with Adobe After Effects. This allows you to start work on your DVD or Blu-ray 
project before you have even finished editing your sequence.
In this lesson, you’ll begin by learning the DVD and Blu-ray Disc authoring work-
flow and then create your own project.
1 Open Encore Lesson 19-01.ncor in the Lesson 19 folder.
Switch to the Timeline Editing workspace.
2 Choose Window > Workspace > Timeline Editing.
3 Choose Window > Workspace > Reset “Timeline Editing.”
The Reset Workspace dialog opens.
4 Click Yes.
Many free library assets, including prebuilt menus, button designs, and styles are 
included with Adobe Encore. Follow the installation documentation included with 
Adobe Encore to ensure these assets are available. If you see several items in the 
Library panel, you have installed the application and assets successfully.

• Project panel: Import and organize your assets, much as you would using the 
Project panel in Adobe Premiere Pro.
• Monitor panel: View your Timeline contents.
• Menu Viewer panel: View and edit your menus.
• Properties panel: View and change properties for each media asset, Timeline, 
menu, or menu button in your project.
• Timeline Viewer: View a Timeline in this panel, in the same way that you would 
view a sequence in the Timeline panel in Adobe Premiere Pro.
• Timelines: A list of Timelines in your project. Timelines are the Adobe Encore 
equivalent of Adobe Premiere Pro sequences.
• Library: A large collection of template menus, buttons, and layer styles.

Lesson 19 
Authoring DVDs with Adobe encore
overview of DVD authoring in Adobe encore
You can create a new Adobe Encore project by simply choosing a name and a loca-
tion for the project file. The format requirements for DVD and Blu-ray projects 
are very strict to allow them to play back on all standard set-top box players. Only 
MPEG2 video will play on a DVD set-top box. Blu-ray players will play MPEG2 
or H.264 files. Adobe Encore can transcode your video to the correct format 
automatically.
The difference between a DVD and a Blu-ray Disc is primarily in the image quality. 
Blu-ray Discs can store substantially more information than a DVD, which allows 
for much higher-resolution video files: It’s the difference between high-definition 
and standard-definition.
You’ll use Adobe Encore to connect your assets, making an interactive menu sys-
tem, with chapter marks you can link to and submenus that might include ani-
mated backgrounds, transitions, and music.
Here’s the workflow:
• Create a completed sequence in Adobe Premiere Pro, or prepare another video 
file for import into Adobe Encore. This will be your main video in the Adobe 
Encore project. You could easily have multiple videos—several episodes from a 
series, for example.
• Prepare any other assets you plan to use in your Adobe Encore project. This 
might include extra videos to use as moving backgrounds for your menus, 
menu designs, buttons, background music clips, still images to use as a slide 
show, or additional videos associated with your project such as a “making of” 
documentary.
• Import your assets.

ADobe Premiere Pro Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 7
• Link your assets together, perhaps by using one of the many included template 
menus.
• Transcode your assets to the correct format, and render your motion menu, 
which is a menu with moving pictures. You can transcode your media at any 
time, and once the process begins, it’ll go on in the background while you work 
with Adobe Encore. If you leave transcoding to the end, Adobe Encore can 
automatically calculate the best way to encode your media.
• Burn your disc.
About video files for DVD  
and blu-ray Discs
DVD and Blu-ray Discs use a video codec that consists of different kinds of frames. 
Some of the frames, called i frames, are a complete image. Other frames are con-
structed from a mixture of their own picture information and picture information 
taken from other frames. This reduces the file size, because many frames contain 
only the picture information that is different from other, similar frames.
Imagine a video of a someone speaking on stage at a conference, standing in front 
of a static background and recorded with a static camera. The speaker moves, but 
the background behind could easily be a photograph. There’s no need to record 
new picture information for the whole of every new frame, because some parts 
won’t change from one frame to the next. Not recording unnecessary picture infor-
mation in this way is part of a series of compression technologies called temporal 
compression—compression over time.
Picture information is spread across multiple frames according to predetermined 
rules to ensure compatibility with all set-top DVD and Blu-ray players. A number of 
frames are grouped together, referred to as a group of pictures (GOP). Because many 
frames are used in a GOP, this kind of video compression is referred to as long GOP.
Adding Adobe encore chapter 
markers to the timeline
Just like chapters in a book, DVD and Blu-ray chapters act as a way of navigating 
through video. You can use them to skip from one part of a video to the next, or 
you can link directly to them using a menu button.
Markers in Adobe Encore are added to the time ruler.

8 
Lesson 19 
Authoring DVDs with Adobe encore
You can add chapter markers in Adobe Encore in the same way that you add regu-
lar markers in Adobe Premiere Pro. Let’s try it.
1 If it is not already open, double-click Main Timeline in the Project panel.
This project has a simple Timeline with a short video in it. Notice that Timelines 
in Adobe Encore look and behave in a similar way to Timelines in Adobe 
Premiere Pro.
2 Position the Timeline playhead about five seconds from the beginning of the 
Timeline and click the Add Chapter (
) button at the bottom of the Monitor 
panel.
Adobe Encore adds a chapter mark to the Timeline. Notice that this mark has 
the number 2. The first chapter mark is already automatically added at the very 
beginning of the Timeline.
3 Add some more marks to this Timeline by repositioning the playhead and 
clicking the Add Chapter button or by pressing the keyboard shortcut *.
E Tip: You can add Adobe Encore chapter markers to the Timeline in Adobe Premiere Pro too. If 
you import your sequence to Adobe Encore or send it to Adobe Encore from Adobe Premiere Pro, 
the markers you added in Adobe Premiere Pro will automatically appear as chapter marks in the 
Adobe Encore Timeline panel.
Adobe Encore menu buttons can be linked to a Timeline or to an individual chap-
ter mark. This allows for advanced interactivity without adding multiple copies of 
your video.

ADobe Premiere Pro Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 9
Adding chapter marks  
before transcoding
There is a particular limitation in the way all DVD and Blu-ray Discs use chapter 
marks: A chapter mark must be located on an i frame, one of the complete frames of 
picture information.
If you add chapter marks before transcoding, Adobe Encore will automatically 
ensure that an i frame exists wherever there is a chapter mark. This means you can 
place chapter marks exactly where you want them.
If you transcode your video to MPEG2 or H.264 video before adding your chapter 
marks, you’ll find they jump to the nearest i frame when you finally set them. This 
could be several frames from your preferred time.
creating an Autoplay DVD
An autoplay DVD plays video as soon as you put the disc into your set-top box. 
There is no menu, and it’s common to set the video to loop playback indefi-
nitely. These kinds of discs are perfect for a display screen giving information at a 
museum or conference.
Let’s produce one now.
1 Choose File > Close Project, and save the project.
Adobe Encore displays the welcome screen, which you will see each time you 
load Adobe Encore.
The Adobe Encore welcome screen has the same options as the Adobe  
Premiere Pro welcome screen.

10 
Lesson 19 
Authoring DVDs with Adobe encore
2 Click New Project. Name the project Encore Lesson 19-02. Browse to the Lesson 
19 folder, and choose the New Encore Projects folder.
3 Make sure Authoring Mode is set to DVD and the Television Standard is set to 
NTSC.
Choosing the correct authoring mode tells Adobe Encore the frame size it 
should use for menus. Click OK.
4 When you import new assets into an Adobe Encore project, you can choose 
to import them as a new menu, a Timeline, or other functional asset. You can 
always set them later, but it saves a couple of clicks to predefine them as you 
import. Right-click in the empty space inside the Project panel, and choose 
Import As > Timeline.
5 In the Import as Timeline dialog, browse to the Lesson 19 folder and open 
Double Identity.mov.
E Tip: You can always 
create a new Timeline 
from an existing 
imported asset by right-
clicking it and choosing 
New > Timeline.

ADobe Premiere Pro Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 11
what is the First Play item?
Just as Adobe Premiere Pro produces sequences, Adobe Encore produces Timelines. 
In fact, it is Timelines that play when you produce a DVD or Blu-ray Disc, not assets.
The first Timeline or menu you create will automatically be marked as the First Play 
item. As the name suggests, the First Play item is the first thing that will be played 
when the disk is put into the set-top box.
The tiny black triangle in a circle is the First Play mark, and it has already been added 
to the Double Identity Timeline that was created when you imported the Double 
Identity.mov video file. You can change the First Play item by right-clicking the item 
you would like and choosing Set as First Play.
In terms of producing an autoplay DVD, that’s it—your disc is ready to burn! 
Let’s set it to loop playback first.
6 Click to select the Double Identity Timeline in the Project panel. Be careful not 
to click the Double Identity.mov asset.
The Properties panel now shows options that relate to this Timeline.

12 
Lesson 19 
Authoring DVDs with Adobe encore
7 Click the End Action menu in the Properties panel, and choose Link Back to 
Here. This tells Adobe Encore to return to the beginning of the video when it 
finishes playing.
Now let’s choose the options we need to burn a DVD.
8 Go to the Window menu, and choose Build.
9 Choose the following settings:
•
Format: DVD. You would use this menu to choose Blu-ray if that was your 
intended output.
•
Output: DVD Disc. Adobe Encore can also produce the files used for mass 
duplication; you’d choose the option you need with this menu.
•
Source: Current Project. If you have created files previously, you could 
choose them here, instead of your current project.
•
Destination: Choose your output. If your system has no DVD burner, you 
will not be able to create discs with Adobe Encore. However, you can still 
create files that can be used to create a DVD disc later. A common workflow 
is to choose DVD Image in this menu, which creates an ISO file that can be 
used by any disc-burning application to create a copy of the finished DVD.
•
Size: Choose the size of disc you have put into your burner, and choose 
whether it is single-sided or dual-sided. If you tell Adobe Encore your 
writable disc is double-sided, the application will automatically manage the 
data between the sides.
If you click Build, Adobe Encore will automatically transcode the video files used 
in your project based on the available space on the disc and then burn the disc. 
Congratulations! You made a new autoplay DVD!
P Note: Writable DVD 
discs are available with 
varying storage sizes, 
including a dual-layer 
system that almost 
doubles the amount of 
data the disc can store 
on each side.

ADobe Premiere Pro Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 13
creating a menu DVD
Much of the really creative work in Adobe Encore is in the creation and configu-
ration of interactive menus. Let’s build a DVD project using an interactive menu 
taken from the library of free templates included with Adobe Encore.
We’ll also use Dynamic Link to take a sequence from Adobe Premiere Pro.
1 To begin, quit Adobe Encore; we’ll have Adobe Premiere Pro start the process 
for us.
2 Browse to the Lesson 19 folder, and open Lesson 19-01.prproj. This project 
contains the Double Identity sequence you worked on earlier.
3 Open the Double Identity sequence.
4 Go to the File menu, and choose Adobe Dynamic Link > Send to Encore.
Adobe Premiere Pro starts Adobe Encore, and the New Project dialog appears.
5 Give the project the name Lesson 19-03, and browse to store it in the  
Lesson 19/New Encore Projects folder. Check that the project settings are  
right for an NTSC DVD, and click OK.
Adobe Encore now has the sequence from Adobe Premiere Pro, dynamically 
linked to the Adobe Premiere Pro project and already added to a Timeline. The 
Timeline already has chapter marks, because they were added previously in 
Adobe Premiere Pro.
The Timeline is also already the First Place item, so you could open the Build 
panel and burn this disc right away if you wanted—making an autoplay DVD.
Let’s add a menu.
6 Go to the Window menu, and choose Workspace > Menu Design. This 
workspace focuses on the creative process of designing and linking together 
menus and buttons. Be sure to reset the workspace if you have explored it 
already.
E Tip: If you have 
already created an 
Adobe Encore project, 
you can simply drag 
and drop a sequence 
from the Adobe 
Premiere Pro Project 
panel to the Adobe 
Encore Project panel 
to create a dynamically 
linked asset.

Lesson 19 
Authoring DVDs with Adobe encore
7 Select the Library panel, which is docked with the Styles panel by default.
The Library panel has several sets of free assets, categorized by style.
Below the preview, you’ll see a series of buttons you can use to filter the list of 
available assets. You can show only menus, buttons, backgrounds, and so on.

ADobe Premiere Pro Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 15
8 Choose the General set, and look for Radiant Menu Wide on the list. Double-
click the menu, and Adobe Encore will add it to your project, displaying it in the 
Menu Viewer.
The Template menus have buttons in place, ready to link to assets in your 
project. If there are too many buttons, it’s easy to delete the ones you don’t need.
9 Select the Text Tool (
) and click the title at the top, where it currently reads 
“standard alliance.” Select all of the text and replace it with the words Double 
Identity.
10 Select the Direct Select tool (
), and select the words video productions at the 
top of the menu. Press the Delete to remove that text.
11 Choose the Selection tool (
), and then select and delete the menu buttons 
Chapter 3 and Chapter 6. We need only four buttons, because our Timeline has 
only four chapters altogether.
E Tip: There are 
two selection tools: 
The Selection Tool is 
primarily for menu 
buttons, while the 
Direct Select tool is 
for text or graphic 
elements, including 
those incorporated into 
menu buttons.

16 
Lesson 19 
Authoring DVDs with Adobe encore
12 Still using the Selection tool, select the Chapter 1 button. Then, look for the Link 
option in the Properties menu. This tells Adobe Encore what should happen 
when a user selects this button. To the left of the menu is a curly icon (
) called 
the pick whip. Click this button, and drag right across the screen to the Double 
Identity Timeline in the Project panel. This is a convenient shortcut for setting 
the contents of the menu.
13 Do the same for the remaining three buttons, but this time drag the pick whip 
for each button directly to the chapter marks on the Timeline. You’ll be linking 
the buttons to these chapters. Link the Chapter 2 button to the 2nd Chapter 
Mark, the Chapter 3 button to the 3rd Chapter Mark, and the Chapter 4 button 
to the 4th Chapter Mark.
14 Lasso around all of the buttons in the menu to select them. Now, in the 
Properties panel, select the checkbox for Set Name from Link.
All of the names update to match the chapters the buttons are linked to.
15 Select the Double Identity Timeline in the Project panel. Now, in the Properties 
panel, use the End Action menu pick whip to select the NTSC_Radiant Menu 
WIDE menu in the Project panel.
16 Finally, select the Chapter 1 button, and use the Name box in the Properties 
panel to change the name to PLAY.

ADobe Premiere Pro Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 17
Modifying a menu with  
Adobe Photoshop
Menus in Adobe Encore are actually Adobe Photoshop files. The various elements 
of the menus, such as buttons, or the highlights for buttons, are identified by special 
layer names. This means you can build a menu yourself in Adobe Photoshop if 
you want.
Adobe Encore has a convenient way of allowing you to edit menus in Adobe 
Photoshop, if you have it installed. Simply open the menu in Adobe Encore, and 
then click the Edit Menu in Photoshop (
) button.
Adobe Photoshop loads, and the menu opens, ready for you to make changes. You 
can use almost any Adobe Photoshop features to make changes to your menu. Save, 
and return to Adobe Encore to see the results of your edits. There’s no need to close 
the menu in Photoshop. If you prefer, you can keep it open and switch back and forth 
between Adobe Photoshop and Adobe Encore to check the results of your changes.
Previewing the DVD
Let’s preview our interactive DVD.
1 To begin, go to the File menu and choose Preview.
Adobe Encore displays the Project Preview panel. This behaves like a DVD 
set-top box, with the same controls you would find on your remote control. You 
can use this panel to check that your DVD interactivity behaves as you would 
expect. It’s important to be sure that everything connects together as it should.

18 
Lesson 19 
Authoring DVDs with Adobe encore
There’s one problem: The Double Identity sequence is still the First Play item, 
so the menu does not appear until the video finishes. This kind of minor issue 
comes up a lot when authoring DVDs, so it’s a really good idea to use the 
Preview panel to check everything connects together correctly before you burn 
the disc.
2 Press Escape to close the Preview panel, or click the Exit Here button.
3 Right-click the NTSC_Radiant Menu WIDE menu in the Project panel, and 
choose Set as First Play.
4 Preview the DVD again, and try the buttons on the menu. Now everything 
is perfect!
creating a blu-ray Disc
Creating a Blu-ray Disc with Adobe Encore is almost the same as creating a regular 
DVD. There are two main differences:
• You will want to use high-definition video assets to produce a Blu-ray Disc, 
rather than the standard-definition assets used for a regular DVD. The main 
benefit of Blu-ray Discs over regular DVDs is the high-resolution image it 
supports.
• When you use the Build panel to burn your disc, you’ll set the Format menu to 
Blu-ray, rather than DVD. The other options are all as you would expect. You’ll 
still need to choose whether you want to output to a disc or produce a file for 
duplication. You’ll also still need to choose a disc size.
On the Build panel, you’ll notice there’s a Check Project button. As well as preview-
ing your project, you can click this button to have Adobe Encore search for any 
potential problems with the design of your project, such as buttons that don’t link 
to anything or Timelines that have no End Action set.

ADobe Premiere Pro Cs6 CLAssroom in A book 19
exporting DVD projects for the web
Everything you put into the design of your Adobe Encore project can be converted 
into an interactive Flash video that will play on almost any computer. It’s like con-
verting your DVD into a web page.
In fact, when you create a web DVD, Adobe Encore creates a standard HTML web 
page that contains your DVD project in the form of an Adobe Flash .swf file. You 
can view the results on any standard web browser and, if you have a website, add it 
for viewing by the world by uploading it. There’s no conversion required because 
the files created are already in the correct format for web delivery.

20 
Lesson 19 
Authoring DVDs with Adobe encore
To produce a web DVD, follow these steps:
1 Create your Adobe Encore project just as you would normally. The higher the 
quality of your original video, the better the quality of the Flash video files that 
can be made from it. This means working with high-definition video in a Blu-
ray project is a great way to go.
2 When you’ve finished designing your project, go to the Build panel, and set 
Format to Flash.
3 Choose a name and destination for your new Flash files.
4 Choose between F4V or FLV for your video format. F4V is based on the newer 
H.264 codec and will generally yield better picture quality. However, if someone 
watches your video using an older version of the Flash Player software, they may 
not be able to view it. Flash Player is free, and upgrading is quick and easy, but 
users don’t always have permission to upgrade.
5
Choose a preset image size and quality.
6
Choose a template for the web page, if you’d like one.
7
Click Build.
Adobe Encore creates all of the files you need, including an Index.html web page. 
Open the page, and you can view your project.
The file is called Index.html because this is the first page a web server looks for 
when someone views inside a folder. So, all you need to do to share your project 
with the world is to put the contents of the folder you created onto a server and 
share the address.

review answers
1 They are almost the same thing. But Adobe Encore usually has one Timeline for each 
video you want to include in your finished disc, while Adobe Premiere Pro combines 
lots of clips to produce a sequence.
2 Blu-ray Discs can store substantially more information than a DVD. The extra storage 
space allows for much higher-resolution video. In a nutshell, it’s the difference between 
standard-definition and high-definition video.
3 You can drag and drop a sequence from the Adobe Premiere Pro Project panel right 
into the Adobe Encore Project panel. Alternatively, open the sequence in Adobe 
Premiere Pro, and choose File > Adobe Dynamic Link > Send to Encore.
4 There is no need! Adobe Encore will automatically encode your videos based on the 
Format menu setting in the Build panel.
5 Pick whips are a convenient way to choose menu options. Drag the pick whip onto the 
item you want, and the menu is set to link to it.
6 Open the menu to view it, and click the Edit Menu in Photoshop button. Remember to 
save the file in Photoshop before checking back in Adobe Encore.
