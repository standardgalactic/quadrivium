Preface
Global Mobile Satellite Communications (GMSC) structures are speciﬁc to mobile
satellite communication discipline and technique for maritime, land, and aeronautical
applications that enable connections between Mobile Earth Stations (MES). These
include ships, land vehicles and aircraft on the one hand and ground telecommuni-
cations subscribers on the other, through the medium of space segment (satellite
constellation), Land Earth Stations (LES), and Terrestrial Telecommunications
Network (TTN) or other landline providers.
This book is very important for modern shipping, land (road and rail) and
aeronautical concerns, because GMSC are providing more effective business, trade,
and prosperity in the new millennium, in the ﬁrst place for transport safety and
security matters and second, for commercial communications. The most consider-
able marketing and technical point of this book is great deﬁciency of suitable
manuals on the international book market, which completely describe GMSC
fundamentals, space segments, ground segments (MES and LES), and Global
Mobile Personal Satellite Communications (GMPSC).
The book discusses hot topics in GMSC techniques and technology, which will
be useful for technical staff onboard vessels, land vehicles and aircraft, on offshore
constructions, and for those possessing satellite handset phones. This includes sea,
land, and air transport sets with many other requirements for more effective trade,
which need development, design, utility, implementation, and knowledge of
Communication, Navigation and Surveillance (CNS) for safety and commercial
applications. Otherwise, GMSC solutions are very important to all modern trans-
portation companies, dispatchers, agencies, brokers, and the successful manage-
ment, commerce, carriage tracking, and logistics of their ﬂeet.
In general, this book may become the manual for a broad range of readers with
different levels of technical education and knowledge, for professional staff
involved in GMSC and their technical managers, engineers, professors, students,
instructors, and participants in GMDSS courses, consultants and supervisors of
MES and for military ofﬁcers and cadets. This book could ﬁnd an important place in
libraries, universities, and institutions as well.

Mobile satellite systems today have become very important topics for students in
many maritime, transportation and aviation universities, faculties in telecommuni-
cation and electrical engineering, for all modern transportation companies, GMSC
manufacturers, providers, operators, and their management staff. Everyone involved
in GMSC systems has to know something about these technology and transmission
systems. Thus, in writing this book the author has used the expertise, prospects,
literature, and manuals of numerous experts, specialists, institutions, and references
mentioned at the end of this handbook as well as information from the Internet.
The author has been a professional expert in maritime radiocommunications
since 1969, as a radio ofﬁcer on board ocean-going cargo ships using Morse MF/HF
radiotelegraphy and MF/HF/VHF radiotelephony and later as master mariner and
Electronics/GMDSS Operator with Inmarsat Ship Earth Stations (SES). In addition,
for over 15 years he has managed the Former-IS Marine Radio Company and newly
established CNS Systems for research, service, installation, and engineering of
GMSC and Global Navigation Satellite Systems (GNSS) systems and equipment
onboard ships and integration with modern IT systems. The author has also used his
doctoral dissertation, master’s theses, technical manuscripts, papers, and practical
experience with radiocommunications, navigation, and GMSC systems.
For basic and principal technical information he has drawn heavily mostly on the
following sources:

techniques, and technology in satellite communications. The material has been
systematized in such a way to cover satellite development, systematization, deﬁ-
nition of all nomenclature, synonyms of mobile satellite communications systems
and services, new kinds of launcher systems and the presentation of all types of
satellite orbit constellations and spacecrafts. The newest concepts of transmission
models and accesses including IP networking, a complete introduction to mobile

Introduction
The two volumes of this book were written in order to form a bridge between
potential readers and current GMSC trends, system concepts, and network archi-
tecture by using a very simple style with easily comprehensible technical infor-
mation, characteristics, graphicons, ﬁgures, illustrations, and mathematic equations.
The special part of GMSC for maritime, land, and aeronautical CNS applications
is new techniques for modern transportation concerns and their ﬂeets at sea, on
land, and in the air for the enhancement of commercial and distress communications
and tracking solutions. The modern GMSC infrastructures are greatly important for
all transportation companies, their successful commerce, carriage and management
of vessels, land vehicles and aircraft. Finally, modern, innovative techniques and
technology in GMSC are needed for newly developed mobile broadband and
multimedia communications and for IT, CNS, and Global Navigation Satellite
Systems (GNSS).
The Volume 1 of this book, nominated as “Theory,” consists of seven chapters
on the following particular subjects:
Chapter 1: Introduction gives a short background to the development of Radio
and MSC, overview, concept, and applications of GMSC for maritime, land, and
aeronautical applications, including international organizations, operators, and new
GMPSC systems.
Chapter 2: Space Segment discusses the fundamentals of space platforms and
orbital parameters, laws of satellite motions, new types of launching systems,
satellite orbits and geometric relations, spacecraft conﬁguration, payload structure,
and satellite link design.
Chapter 3: Transmission Techniques introduces an essential basic knowledge of
modulation and demodulation, coding and error corrections, multiple access,
mobile Internet and broadband protocols, and forthcoming mobile DVB-CNS
solutions.

Introduction
The safety of navigation through all past ages has been a primary preoccupation for
all seamen and shipping owners. Distress and disasters at sea caused by the blind
forces of Mother Nature or by human factors have occurred during the course of
many centuries on ships and in the life of seafarers. For many centuries, seafarers
sailed without incoming information about trip, navigation, and weather conditions
at sea. At that time, only audio and visual transfers of information from point to
point were used.
On the other hand, the safety of ﬂying in history has been a primary preoccu-
pation for all airmen and airways owners. Disasters of aircraft caused by different or
somehow by human factors have occurred during the course of the last century in
the life of avionics. At the beginning, avionics ﬂied without incoming information
about some air environment and weather conditions. At that time, only audio and
visual transfers of information from point to point were used.
However, no earlier than the end of the nineteenth century were developed new
disciplines, such as the transmission of news and information via wire initially, then
by radio (wireless), and latterly via modern satellite and stratospheric platform
communications systems.
The facts about road vehicles and trains are well determined and clear because
these transport mediums have more reliable environments and routes than ships and
aircraft. After a disaster of train, truck, or bus, it is much easier to ﬁnd out their
positions and to provide alert, search, and assistance.
With the exception of safety demands, an important question is the utilization
and development of new mobile radio and satellite communications and navigation
systems for commercial and social utilization at sea, on land and in the air.

Abstract
Communication satellites provide the bridges for a number of new, specialized
markets in commercial and private telecommunications and make closer ties between
nations. Thus, in the course of more than 50 years, satellite communications have
obtained global links in the public and private terrestrial telecommunication network
(TTN). In the next stage, military satellite systems for communication and navigation
came to serve navy, ground, and air forces worldwide, and because of economic
reasons, soon after they also provided commercial Mobile Satellite Communications
(MSC) and Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS).
For about 40 years, MSC was used, particularly because ocean-going vessels
have become dependent for their commercial and safety communications on Mobile
Satellite Systems (MSS). Although aircraft and land vehicles started before ships,
due to many unsuccessful experiments and projects they have had to follow the
evident lead of Inmarsat maritime MSC engineering. The modiﬁed ship’s mobile
Earth stations (MES) are today installed on land (road or railway) vehicles and
aircraft for all civil and military applications, including remote or rural locations
and industrial onshore and offshore installations.
The GPS, DGPS, GLONASS, and other new satellite navigation and determi-
nation systems provide precise positioning data for vessels and aircraft and also
serve land navigation and ﬂeet vehicle management. Because of the need for new,
enhanced services, these systems will be augmented with satellite communications
and ground surveillance facilities. At the end of this race, a new mobile satellite
revolution is coming, whereby anyone can carry a personal handheld telephone
using simultaneously satellite or cellular/dual systems at sea, in the car, in the air,
on the street, in rural areas, and in the desert, that is to say everywhere and in all
positions.
These integrated systems will be soon implemented with modern Global Mobile

Stratospheric Platform Systems (SPS), and very modern transportation discipline
known as communication, navigation and surveillance (CNS) designed to provide
enhanced radio and satellite trafﬁc control and management (TCM) including safety
and security (SAS).

History of Radio
The word communications is derived from the Latin phrase “communication,”
which stands for the social process of information exchange and covers the human
need for direct contact and mutual understanding. The word “telecommunications”
means to convey and exchange information at a distance (tele) by the medium of
electrical signals.

Introduction

In general, telecommunications are the conveyance of intelligence in some form
of signal, sign, sound, or electronic means from one point to a distant second point.
In ancient times, that intelligence was communicated with the aid of audible call-
ings, ﬁre and visible vapor or smokes, and image signals. We have come a long way
since the ﬁrst human audio and visual communications, in case you had forgotten,
used during many millennia. In the meantime, primitive kinds of communications
between individuals or groups of people were invented. Hence, as impressive as this
achievement was, the development of more reliable communications and so, wire
and radio, had to wait a couple of centuries more.
The invention of the telegraph in 1844 and the telephone in 1876 harnessed the
forces of electricity to allow the voice to be heard beyond shouting distance for the
ﬁrst time. The British physicist M. Faraday and the Russian academic E. H. Lenz
made experiments with electric and magnetic phenomena and formulized a theory
of electromagnetic (EM) induction at the same time. The British physicist James C.
Maxwell published in 1873 his classical theory of electromagnetic radiation,
proving mathematically that electromagnetic waves travel through space with a
speed precisely equal to that of light.
The famous German physicist Heinrich Rudolf Hertz during 1886 experimen-
tally proved Maxwell’s theoretical equations. Thus, during Hertz’s studies in 1879,
his mentor, physicist Hermann von Helmholtz, suggested that Hertz’s doctoral
dissertation has been on testing Maxwell’s theory of electromagnetism, published in
1865, which predicted the existence of electromagnetic waves moving at the speed
of light and predicted that light itself was just such a wave.
During his research and studies, Hertz demonstrated that high-frequency
(HF) oscillations produce a resonant effect at a very small distance away from the
source and that this phenomenon was the result of electromagnetic waves.
Practically, Hertz used the damped oscillating currents in a dipole antenna, trig-
gered by a high-voltage electrical capacitive spark discharge, as his transmitter
(Tx) source of radio waves (RW).
His detector in some experiments was another dipole antenna connected to a
narrow spark gap as receiver (Rx). A small spark in this gap signiﬁed detection of
the radio waves. When he added cylindrical reﬂectors behind his dipole antennas,
Hertz could detect radio waves about 20 m from the Tx in his laboratory. In
Fig. 1.1 (Left) is illustrated the electronic diagram of spark generator as a main
component of his radio Tx (Ruhmkorff coil with linear vibrator). In fact, the wave
character of the spark generator discharge is creating short-lived electromagnetic
waves. The waves thus produced were received by a resonator located a short
distance away from the generator’s aerial, whose radio Rx is illustrated in Fig. 1.1
(Right). At the moment when the resonator picked up the waves, hardly perceptible
sparks were produced in the resonator gap that could be detected using a magni-
fying glass. Therefore, it is after Hertz that the new discipline of radio technology is
sourced and after whom the frequency and its measuring unit hertz (Hz) are named.
An English physician, Sir Oliver J. Lodge using the ideas of others, realized that
the EM resonator was very insensitive, and because of this phenomenon, he
invented a “coherer.” A much better coherer was built and devised by a Parisian
1.2

professor, Edouard Branly, in 1890. He put metal ﬁlings (shut in a glass tubule)
between two electrodes, and so a great number of ﬁne contacts were created. This
coherer suffered from one disadvantage, and it needed to be “shaken before use.”
Owing to imperceptible electric discharges, it always got “baked” and blocked.
In early 1889, the Russian professor of physics Aleksandar Stepanovich Popov
conducted experiments along the lines of Hertz’s research and successfully realized
the ﬁrst practical experiments with EM waves for the transmission of radio signals.
Soon after, Professor Popov attended a meeting of the Russian Physical-Chemical
Society at which the St. Petersburg Professor N. G. Yegorov reproduced Hertz’s
experiments, but in a manner that Popov felt to be insufﬁciently graphic. It took him
only a few months to build a more compact and effective device to demonstrate
Hertz’s experiments, which he then gradually improved on, so that by 1894 he had
constructed a working transmitter that generated electromagnetic waves based on
Hertz’s vibrator and using a Ruhmkorff coil.
This was the ﬁrst transmission and reception system for remittent electronic
waves suitable for the reliable communication of information in the history of
telecommunications. The method of Popov invention became the prototype for the
subsequent ﬁrst generation of radio communication systems. At that time, pioneer
of radio equipment Popov built his ﬁrst radio receiver (Rx) with improved version
of coherer designed by both Sir Lodge and Branly, so using new inventions, he
practically realized the ﬁrst experiments ever in the world with EM waves for the
transmission of radio signals.
As Hertz’s early experiments, hardly had Lodge’s paper been published in the
journal Electrician in July 1894 than his experiments with the coherer were repeated
by physicists around the world, but only Popov was able to obtain a practical result.
In 1895, he created a system in which the device was mounted on a wooden base
and placed in a metal cage to screen it from electrical interference. The aerial used
was either a vertical length of wire or an asymmetrical vibrator with a parabolic
mirror. The circuit proposed by Popov was also used for thunderstorm detectors and
telegraph transmission.

Introduction

In 1895, Popov upgraded the coherer’s sensitivity and invented a special
mechanism to automatically reset the device. In fact, he improved Branly’s radio
Rx by the insertion of choke coils on each side of the relay to protect the coherer
and also by replacing the spark gap with a vertical antenna insulated at its upper end
and connected to the ground through the coherer. He then mounted a small bell in
serial connection with the coherer’s relay anchor, whose ringing effected its auto-
matic destabilization and successive unblocked function of the receiver system. On
May 7, 1895, he demonstrated his new apparatus to the members of the Russian
Physical-Chemical Society: a lightning conductor as an antenna, a metal ﬁlings
coherer, and detector element with telegraph relay and a bell. The relay was used to
activate the bell, which announces the occurrence of transmitting signals and in this
way it serves as a decoherer (tapper) to prepare the receiver to detect the next
signals. This was the ﬁrst telegraph station in the world, which could work without
any wires.
Popov succeeded in making a reliable generator of EM waves, when the
detecting systems in common use still were not at all satisfactory. So his system
was extended to function as a wireless telegraph with a Morse telegraph key
attached to the transmitter (Ruhmkorff coil and blocking capacitor), shown in
Fig. 1.2 (Left). In May of the same year, instead of a bell he contrived to use a clock
mechanism to realize direct, fast destabilization of metal ﬁlings in the coherer upon
receipt of the signals. In the same year, he succeeded in making a more reliable
generator of EM waves, when the receiving (detecting) systems in common use still
were not at all satisfactory. Thus, using the inventions of his predecessors and on
the basis of his proper experiments, Popov elaborated the construction of the
world’s ﬁrst radio receiver (coherer, ampliﬁer, electric bell, aerial) with a
wire-shaped antenna system in the air attached to a balloon, whose sample is shown
in Fig. 1.1 (Right).
In December 1895, he ofﬁcially announced the success of a regular radio con-
nection and on March 21, 1896, at the St. Petersburg University, and he demon-
strated it in the public. Finally, on May 24, 1896, Popov installed a pencil instead of
the bell and sent the ﬁrst wireless message in the world at the distance of 250 m

between two buildings, conveying the name “GENRICH GERZ” (the name of
Hertz in Russian) by Morse code using his homemade transmitter and receiver.
In March 1897, Popov equipped a coastal radio station at Kronstadt and the
Russian Navy cruiser Africa with his wireless apparatus, and in summer 1897,
Popov started to make experiments at sea, using radios on board ships before the
entire world. In 1898, he succeeded in relaying information at a distance of 9 km
and in 1899, at a distance of 45 km between the island of Gogland and the city of
Kotka in Finland. With all his inventions, Popov made advances on the discoveries
of Hertz and Branly and created the groundwork for the development of maritime
radio.
In 1895, a few months later following the work of Popov, a young Italian
experimenter, Guglielmo Marconi, started to use radio and was the ﬁrst to put EM
theory into business application. A detailed report on the Marconi’s experiments
was presented by chief of UK engineer telegraph agency V. Pris (1834–1913), who
refused to assist him in the works in England (Forum—Yakimenko S). This report
shows that the transmitter of G. Marconi was designed by his Italian teacher A. Rigi
and that he used the receiver of Professor Popov. Apparently, V. Pris in his report
about the invention of G. Marconi was forced to point out that it has been said
previously: “G. Marconi did not do anything new.” In conclusion, it was stated that
unlike Popov, Marconi was not inventor of radio, but good businessman able to
compose something already done, and was able to turn his research into a ﬁnancial
and manufacturing empire.
By the next year, he had sent Morse code messages at a distance of 2 miles.
Moving to England to obtain patents on his equipment, he demonstrated radio
reception over 8 miles (see photograph of Marconi with his ﬁrst radio Tx and Rx
equipment in Fig. 1.3). In 1897, he exhibited the use of radio between ship and

shore and according to Western literature practically started the use of maritime
radio. In the same year, Marconi succeeded in getting his wireless telegraphy
transmissions ofﬁcially patented for the ﬁrst time in the world. The owners of the
Dublin Daily Express in Ireland invited Marconi to conduct wireless reports of the
Kingston Regatta of July 1898 from the steamer Flying Huntress, the ﬁrst ship
equipped with a commercial wireless system. Using an antenna hung from a kite to
increase the effective height of his masts and a LF of 313 kHz at 10 kW of power,
on 12 December 1901 Marconi crackled out the ﬁrst wireless message to span an
ocean in the form of Morse code; three dots forming the letter “s”. This telegraph
signal was sent from Newfoundland in Canada and received in Cornwall on the
west coast of England.
In 1897, Marconi registered the company Wireless Telegraph and Signal
Company, which then in 1900 was renamed Marconi’s Wireless Telegraph
Company, Ltd (MWCT). This company started to design and manufacture radio
telegraphs transmitting and receiving equipment including antenna, other acces-
sories, and devices for transmitting distress messages for shipping industries and
later for commercial ship to shore and vice versa direction at the turn of the
twentieth century. In Fig. 1.4 (Left) is shown Marconi of America QMS 1/2 KW

In 1900, R. Fessenden made the ﬁrst transmission of voice via radio in the USA,
Fleming in 1904 discovered the diode valve, while their countryman and pioneer
Lee de Forest developed and used a triode valve, which made it possible to use
radio not only for radiotelegraphy but also for voice communications. As early as
1907, he installed a triode valve mobile radio on a ferryboat operating on the
Hudson River near New York City.

1.2.1
Development of Mobile Radiocommunications
The very impressive development of mobile radio for maritime use at ﬁrst and later
on for aero applications initiated mobile distress and safety radio. Once the prin-
ciples of radio were understood, mobile radio has been a matter of the steady
development of technology to extend communications accessibility, coverage, and
reliability by reducing the size, cost, and power consumption of equipment and
improve efﬁciency. With further innovations, an age-old barrier between ships and
shore was eliminated and possibility to communicate with mobile radios inde-
pendent of space and time was created. These early radio devices were primitive by
today’s standards, incorporating spark transmitters, which blasted their signals
across almost the entire radio spectrum. It is supposed that the ﬁrst vessel to have a
ship radio station (SRS) was the American liner St. Paul, equipped in 1899. The
next one, early in the following year, was the German vessel s/s Kaiser Wilhelm der
Grosse.
Thereafter, mobile radio spread rapidly throughout the shipping and safety
business. By 1899, however, A. S. Popov had been the ﬁrst in the world who
successfully carried out demonstrations of mobile wireless telegraphy communi-
cations at a distance of 20 miles between warships of the Black Sea ﬂeet. The ﬁrst
recorded use of radio for saving life at sea occurred early in March 1899. The
lightship on the Goodwin Sands near Dover on the south coast of England was
ﬁtted with one of the ﬁrst seaborne Marconi SRS and used it to report to the coastal
radio station (CRS) that the German steamer Elbe had run aground.
The ﬁrst distress signal was CQD (come quick distress), used from 1904 only on
British ships equipped with Marconi devices. After the collision of two passenger
ships, the British s/s Republic and the Italian s/s Florida, running in thick fog in the
early hours of January 23, 1909, the radio ofﬁcer on board the s/s Republic sent for
the ﬁrst time in history the distress signal: “CQD MKC (call sign of s/s Republic),
CQD MKC, CQD MKC” and text: “Republic rammed by unknown steamship, 26
miles southwest of Nantucket, badly in need of assistance.”
After the catastrophe of the White Star liner s/s Titanic in the early hours of 15
April 1912, the UK proposal for a distress signal was the already established CQD,
the USA proposed the NC of International signal codex and Germany preferred
SOE. In Fig. 1.5 (Left) is shown Marconi’s ship radio station used onboard s/s
Titanic. Two men as radio ofﬁcers employed by the Marconi Company worked in
this small windowless room near the bridge. Their main job was to receive and send
messages by radio waves using Morse code. Little did they know they would soon
be tapping out one of the ﬁrst SOS signals from a ship in distress and that will
happen disaster of their ship Titanic.
However, after the disaster of Titanic, new radio regulation and recommenda-
tions required more effective communication equipment and unique distress signals
and rescue procedure, so in Fig. 1.5 (Right) is illustrated the prototype of more
reliable ship’s radio stations used since 1940.

Introduction

By 1912, there were 327 established CRS and 1924 SRS available for public,
commercial, and safety use. The use of radio at sea became very attractive and
indispensable, creating an immediate need for enforcement of the rules and regu-
lations under international radio coordination. Because of this, the ﬁrst Preliminary
Radio Conference was held in Berlin in 1903, where some of the basic principles
for the use of radiotelegraphy at sea were established. In the subsequent Berlin
Conference of 1906, two radio frequencies, 500 and 1000 kHz, were earmarked for
correspondence. This conference also established a standard for international dis-
tress signals in radiotelegraphy, SOS.
The radiotelephony distress signal MAYDAY was adopted in 1927 at Hanover.
The name of this signal derives from the French phrase “M’aidez,” which means
“Help me.” The ﬁrst international SOLAS (Safety of Life at Sea) Convention was
adopted during 1914 in London, partly as a result of the Titanic disaster. It stipulated
Morse telegraphy radio on 500 kHz and auxiliary battery-operated backup radio
transceiver unit on 500 kHz as well. In addition, ships carrying more than 50 pas-
sengers were required to carry radio devices with a range of at least 100 Nm, and larger
ships had to maintain continuous radio watch with a minimum of 3 radio ofﬁcers.
At the conference in Washington in 1927, the regulations were established as a
supplement to bring into force three safety calls in radiotelegraphy for distress,
urgency, and security, SOS, XXX, and TTT, respectively. These three signals were
obligatory only on 500 kHz, with a silence period of 3 min after every 15th and
45th minute. At that time was also introduced the use of radiotelephony at sea, and
soon after that, the ﬁrst radiotelephone communications between s/s America and
coastal radio station Deal Beach, New Jersey, in the USA was realized.
Then, at the Radio Conference in Madrid, radio stations’ call signs and fre-
quencies were determined, and the International Telecommunications Union
(ITU) was established and Radio Regulations (RR) adopted. At the conference in
Atlantic City in 1947, a supplementary ITU RR was adopted and a new
radiotelephony distress frequency on 2182 kHz accepted, instead of the old one on
1650 kHz, with silence periods of 3 min after every 00th and 30th minute. Three
telephone safety calls were previously used for distress, urgency, and security such
as MAYDAY, PANPAN, and SECURITE, respectively, on 2182 kHz and, more
recently, on 156.8 MHz (16 VHF channel).

Finally, the new era of transistors commenced, and later on, the period of rev-
olutionary integrated circuits started after 1957. In the meantime, was the change to
frequency instead amplitude modulation with a new ARQ system for use in mar-
itime radio telex services.
On the other hand, airmen started to follow success in the use of radio at sea, so
in 1928 was developed ﬁrst aircraft radio Tx, shown in Fig. 1.6 (Left). This was the
ﬁrst lightweight radio transmitter built for use on aircraft. It featured a loop antenna,
which could be turned to ﬁnd the signal direction. It supplanted traditional visual
dead reckoning navigation methods. Designed and built by Hugo Leuteritz of Pan
American, the transmitter enabled aircraft to navigate accurately along Pan Am’s
ﬁrst route, between Key West, Florida, and Havana, Cuba, in 1928. Leuteritz
designed other electronic devices as well that allowed Pan American aircraft to
navigate safely throughout the Caribbean and across the Paciﬁc and Atlantic. The
ﬁrst aircraft radio Rx was designed by the Aircraft Radio Corporation in 1929,
whose ARC Model D is shown in Fig. 1.6 (Right).
The Bendix Radio manufacturing company of airborne radio equipment enjoyed
a very close association with the US Navy as early as the mid-1930s. At the
beginning, this company designed Bendix TA-12C HF AM Aircraft Transmitter
four channels HF Tx ﬁrst produced in the 1940s and ﬁtted to USAAF B-17 Flying
Fortress and RAF Coastal Command B-24 Liberator aircraft in WWII.
The Bendix TA-12C Tx, as shown in Fig. 1.7 (Left), operates in four wavebands
from 300 to 600 Kc/s, 3 to 4.8 Mc/s, 4.8 to 7.68 Kc/s, and 7.68 Kc/s to 12 Mc/s. Each
band has a separate oscillator and tuning arrangement so that four channels can be
preset. Channel selection is made using a motorized changeover, switched from
remote control unit MT-51B ﬁtted at the wireless operator’s and pilot’s positions.
On order from the British Air Ministry (AM), Marconi Wireless Telegraph
Company in 1939 started the development of a transmitter/receiver system, the
T1154/R1155, based on the AD77/AD6872 that was used in passenger aircraft. By
that time, Marconi Company was the leading manufacturer of aircraft radio in

England and perhaps in the world. Thus, the system was initially intended for use in
heavier military aircraft, so in the beginning of 1940, the Ministry of Aircraft
Production (MAP) accepts the design and the ﬁrst production set is installed and
tested in June of the same year, whose Rx type R1155 is shown in Fig. 1.7 (Right).
The R1155 is a single super with one HF stage and oscillator/mixer, a total of three
tuned circuits, and two IF stages. With detector, BFO, and AF stages, there are a
total of 6 valves plus a magic eye as tuning indicator. There are facilities for using
this Rx as direction ﬁnding and homing, and the D/F part has 3 valves. Although
rather simple, the receiver has a remarkably good performance for short- and
medium-wave world radio listening.

Evolution of Satellite Communications
The ﬁrst known annotation about devices resembling rockets is said to have been
used by Archytas of Tarentum, who invented in 426 B.C. a steam-driven reaction
jet rocket engine that ﬂew a wooden pigeon around his room. Apparently, the ﬁrst
rockets owe their origin to the invention of gunpowder in China around the tenth
century. Devices similar to rockets were also used in China during the year 1232,
during the siege of Beijing (according to another source: town of Kai-fung-fu) by
the Mongols; the city’s defenders ﬁred missiles. It is believed that around the
thirteenth century, knowledge of rocketry reached Italy and France.
All through the thirteenth to the ﬁfteenth centuries, there were reports of many
rocket experiments. In England, a monk named Roger Bacon worked on improved
forms of gunpowder that greatly increased the range of rockets. In France, Jean
Froissart found that more accurate ﬂights could be achieved by launching rockets
through tubes. Froissart’s idea was the forerunner of the modern bazooka. Joanes de
Fontana of Italy designed a surface-running rocket-powered torpedo for setting
enemy ships on ﬁre.

In the meantime, human space travel had to wait almost a millennium, until Sir
Isaac Newton’s time, when we understood gravity and how a projectile launched at
the right speed could go into Earth orbit. By the sixteenth century, rockets fell into a
time of disuse as weapons of war, though they were still used for ﬁreworks dis-
plays, and a German ﬁreworks maker, Johann Schmidlap, invented the “step
rocket,” a multistage vehicle for lifting ﬁreworks to higher altitudes. The use of
rockets near the Russian (today Ukrainian) city of Belgorod is recorded in 1516,
and the ﬁrst appearance of rockets in the Russian city of Usury dates around 1675.
Following the development and use of military missiles in Europe, the “Rocket
Enterprise” was founded in Moscow around 1680 to provide the similar experi-
ments. A signaling rocket developed in Russia in 1717 could reportedly reach an
altitude of several hundred meters.
In 1815, Russian artillery engineer Alexander Zasyadko started the development
of 3 size types of battleﬁeld missiles for the Russian army with range up to 2700 m.
In 1849, another artillery engineer Konstantin Konstantinov developed rockets
reaching a range of 4–5 km. Rocket experimenters in Germany and Russia began
working with rockets with a mass of more than 45 kg. Some of these rockets were
so powerful that their escaping exhaust ﬂames bored deep holes in the ground even
before liftoff.
Finally, the twentieth century came with its great progress and the historical age
of
space
communications
began
to
unfold.
Russian
scientist
Konstantin
Tsiolkovskiy (1857–1935) published a scientiﬁc book on virtually every aspect of
space rocketing. He propounded the theoretical basis of liquid-propelled rockets,
put forward ideas for multistage launchers and manned space vehicles, space walks
by astronauts and a large platform system that could be assembled in space for
normal human habitation. Although the Russian scientiﬁc elite was primarily
concentrated in centers such as Moscow and St. Petersburg, far from two capitals, a
modest physics teacher conceived some of the most remarkable ideas about the
future of the human race. Almost unknown to its contemporaries, Tsiolkovskiy’s
work decades later was universally accepted as a theoretical foundation of modern
astronautics.
In 1917, the Bolshevik revolution spurred profound changes in Russia. The new
leaders of Soviet Russia conducted a ruthless policy of turning an agrarian peasant
society into an industrial power. At the same time, the Soviet government spared no
effort, in equipping the Red Army with new weapons. In line with this strategy, on
March 1, 1921, the Soviet authorities created Gas Dynamic Laboratory (GDL) for
research in rocketry, to be led by Nikolai Tikhomirov. Tikhomirov had started
studying problems of solid- and liquid-fueled rockets as early as 1894, and in 1915,
he patented “self-propelled aerial and water-surface mines.” Soviet researchers at
GDL worked tirelessly on perfecting military missiles and developing new types of
solid rocket fuel, which would allow the new weapons to compete with artillery.
In early 1924, two new Soviet (Russian) rocket programs were founded. They
were the Central Bureau for the study of the problems of rockets (TsBIRP) and the
All-Union Society for the Study of Interplanetary Flight (OIMS). The main leader
12
1
Introduction

of these early Russian rocket efforts was Fridrikh Tsander, who developed
liquid-propelled rockets in the 1920s and 1930s.
A little later, the American Robert H. Goddard launched in 1926 the ﬁrst
liquid-propelled engine rocket. The rocket 1.22 m high named “Nell,” the world’s
ﬁrst liquid-fueled rocket got an altitude of 12 m, a speed of 60 miles per hour, and a
distance of 46 m. The German society for space travel or VfR was founded in June
of 1927, and it soon had around ﬁve hundred members and the ﬁrst its journal
“The Rocket.”
At the beginning of the 1930s, the Soviet government sanctioned the creation of
several research groups, which united rocket enthusiasts in organizations known as
GIRD (Group for Investigation of Reactive Movement) established in Moscow,
Leningrad, and other Soviet cities. In Moscow, thanks to the efforts of Sergei
Korolev
and
Fridrikh
Tsander,
the
government-sponsored
society
for
the
Advancement of Defense, Aviation and Chemical Technology, Osoaviakhim,
agreed to fund GIRD. However, after Stalin took over the Soviet country, these
rocket programs became Len-GRID and Mos-GRID, or “Group for the study of
reactive motion” based in Leningrad and Moscow, respectively. These two centers,
in turn, soon became the State Reaction Scientiﬁc Research Institute.
In January 1933, Tsander began development of the GIRD-X missile. It was
originally to use a metallic propellant, but after various metals had been tested
without success, it was powered by the Project 10 engine, which was ﬁrst
bench-tested at the beginning of March 1933. This design involves burning of
liquid oxygen and gasoline and was one of the ﬁrst engines to be regeneratively
cooled by the liquid oxygen, which ﬂowed around the inner wall of the combustion
chamber before entering it. However, problems with burn-through during testing
prompted a switch from gasoline to less energetic alcohol.
Tsander died unexpectedly from an illness on March 28, 1933, and his engineer,
Leonid Konstantinpvich Korneev, became the new leader of his research Brigade.
According to the proposal of Stalin, the Revolutionary Military Board established
on September 21, 1933, a brand new institution RNII—Peaктивный нayчнo-
иccлeдoвaтeльcкий инcтитyт (PHИИ). The activities of the new institute began on
October 31 by merging of GDL and GIRD. In the beginning, the works on a rocket
glider were not a part of RNII activities, also the development of rocket engines
using a liquid propellant was also not in the focus of activities, and in fact, the main
activities were focused on military rockets, using solid fuel.
The ﬁrst ofﬁcial Soviet rocket launch was the GIRD-9, on August 17, 1933,
which reached the modest altitude of 400 m. Then, on November 25, 1933,
GIRD-X (ГИPД-X) became the ﬁrst Soviet liquid-propelled rocket launched,
shown in Fig. 1.8 (Left). The ﬁnal missile was 2.2 m long by 140 mm in diameter
and had a mass of 30 kg, and it was anticipated that it could carry a 2-kg payload to
an altitude of 5.5 km. On the other hand, Soviet rocket scientists brought closest to
the development of an unmanned cruise missile; thus, on June 16, 1936, Korolev
presented project of the “Object 218” powered by liquid-fueled rocket engine and
intended for stratospheric ﬂights. On January 29, 1939, a small winged rocket took
to the sky at a test range near Moscow code named as Vehicle 212, shown in
1.2
History of Radio
13

Fig. 1.8 (Right). Vehicle 212 sported many elements of its future successors, such
as a three-axis gyroscopic autopilot.
The development of this rocket was also a backdrop for crucial debates among
Soviet rocket pioneers, and the missile’s arrival on the launchpad coincided with the
most horriﬁc events in the Soviet history and in the life of Korolev, the founder of
the Soviet space program. He was the main designer responsible for the rocket and
who would later go on to mastermind all the early Soviet space triumphs, including
wing rockets RP-318, RP-318-1, SK-9, Project 05 used the ORM-50 engine
developed and rocket R-7, later Soyuz rocket, Sputnik, Yuri Gagarin’s Vostok, and
many more. His team attempted to modify Vehicle 212 into an aircraft-launched
missile, capable of hitting “primarily” aerial targets as well as those on the ground.
As Tsiolkovskiy was the ﬁrst to discover that the reaction principle could reach
space, it would make sense that the Russians would provide very signiﬁcant
developments in rockets. He published a scientiﬁc book on virtually every aspect of
space rocketing. He propounded the theoretical basis of liquid-propelled rockets,
put forward ideas for multistage launchers and manned space vehicles, space walks
by astronauts and a large platform system that could be assembled in space for
normal human habitation.
Between the two world wars, Russian and former USSR scientists and con-
structors used the great experience of Tsiolkovskiy to design many models of
rockets and in 1939 to build the ﬁrst reactive weapon rockets ever, the so-called
Katyusha, which Soviet Red Army used against German troops at the beginning of
the Great Patriotic War (Second World War).
Thus, toward the end of the Second World War, many military constructors in
Germany started with experiments to use their series V1, similar to Soviet wing
rockets, and V2, similar to already developed Russian rockets to attack targets in
England. Among the people working at these projects was Wernher von Braun as a
main constructor, who after Second World War was to work for the US Space
Program.
In 1947, Sergey Korolev created one of the most innovative management
mechanisms in the early Soviet missile program known as the Council of Chief
Designers shown in Fig. 1.9. This photograph, a still from a rare ﬁlm from the
postwar years, shows the members of the council at a meeting: from the left, Boris

Introduction

Chertok, Vladimir Barmin, Mikhail Ryazanskiy, Korolev, Viktor Kuznetsov,
Valentin Glushko, and Nikolay Pilyugin (standing), all Russian brains who put for
the ﬁrst time in the history of human being a ballistic rocket in the space.
After that, in October 1945, the British radar expert and writer of science-ﬁctional
books Arthur C. Clarke proposed that only three communications satellites in
geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) could provide global coverage for TV broadcasting.
The work on rocket techniques in Russia and the former USSR was much
extended after the Great Patriotic War, thanks to enthusiastic and productive work
of the Russian great rocket constructor and spacecraft designer Sergei Korolev. In
1951, Soviet Union realized the ﬁrst launch of the “geophysical” rocket carrying
live animals onboard.
The satellite era began when the Soviet Union shocked the globe with the launch
of the ﬁrst in the world artiﬁcial satellite, Sputnik 1, on October 4, 1957, shown in
Fig. 1.10 (Left). Sputnik contained two radio transmitters, which sent back the
“beep–beep–beep” signals heard round the world, and in such a way, it provided the
ﬁrst satellite communication link with the control center on the ground. Then a
month later only, on November 3, 1957, an even larger and heavier satellite,
Sputnik 2, carried the dog Laika into orbit. This launch marked the beginning of the
use of artiﬁcial satellites to extend and enhance the horizon for communications,
navigation, weather monitoring, observation, and remote sensing.
This event signiﬁed the announcement of the space race and the development of
satellite communications and navigation. That was followed on January 31, 1958,
by the launch of US satellite Explorer 1, presented in Fig. 1.10 (Right). Explorer
contained a cosmic ray detector, radio transmitter, and temperature and microme-
teoroid sensors. Therefore, the development of launchers and satellite systems for
future cosmic explorations started, and the space race began.

On January 1–2, 1959, is launched Luna 1 as the ﬁrst artiﬁcial spacecraft to
escape Earth orbit. On September 12, 1959, is launched Luna 2 the ﬁrst man-made
object to impact the Moon, and on 3 October of the same year Luna 3 photographs
far side of the Moon. On August 19, 1960, two dogs, Belka and Strelka, landed
onboard the prototype of the spacecraft Sputnik 5, becoming ﬁrst animals returning
from orbit.
The most signiﬁcant progress in space technology and engineering was on April
12, 1961, when Yuri Gagarin, ofﬁcer of the former Soviet Union Air Forces, lifted
off aboard the Vostok-1 spaceship from Baikonur Cosmodrome and made the ﬁrst
historical manned orbital ﬂight in space (Fig. 1.11).
In Fig. 1.6 (Left) is illustrated ﬁrst man ﬂying in the Cosmos Soviet pilot
Gagarin and in the same ﬁgure (Right) is the picture of the chief designer of Soviet
missile and space systems and the founder of modern cosmonautics Sergey
Korolev. The twentieth century came with its great progress, and the historical age
of space rocketry and satellite communications began to unfold.
1.2.3
Experiments with Active Communications Satellites
After the launch of Sputnik-1, a sustained effort by the USA to catch up with the
USSR was started. This was reﬂected in the ﬁrst active communications satellite
named SCORE launched on December 18, 1958, by the US Air Force. The second
satellite, Courier, was launched on October 4, 1960, in high-inclined elliptical orbit
(HEO) with its perigee at about 900 km and its apogee at about 1350 km using
solar cells and a frequency of 2 GHz.

Introduction

The maximum emission length was between 10 and 15 min for every successive
passage. The third such satellite was Telstar-1 designed by Bell Telephone
Laboratories experts and launched by NASA on the July 10, 1962, in HEO con-
ﬁguration with its perigee at about 100 km and apogee at about 6000 km (see
Fig. 1.12 (Left)). The plane of the orbit was inclined at about 45º to the equator, and
the duration of the orbit was about 2.5 h. Because of the rotation of the Earth, the
track of the satellite as seen from the Earth stations appeared to be different on every
successive orbit. Thus, over the next two years, Telstar-1 was joined by Relay-1,
Telstar-2, and Relay-2. All of these satellites had the same problem and were visible
to widely separated Ground Earth Station (GES) for only a few short daily periods,
so numbers of GES were needed to provide full-time service.

On the other hand, GEO satellites can be seen 24 h a day from approximately 40 %
of the Earth’s surface, providing direct and continuous links between large numbers of
widely separated locations. The world’s ﬁrst GEO satellite Syncom-1 was launched
by NASA on February 14, 1963, which presented a prerequisite for the development
of MSC systems. This satellite failed during launch, but Syncom-2 and -3 were
successfully placed in orbit on July 26, 1963, and July 19, 1964, respectively.
Both satellites used the military band of 7.360 GHz for the uplink and
1.815 GHz for the downlink. Using frequency modulation (FM) or phase shift
keying (PSK) mode, the transponder could support two carriers at a time for
full-duplex operation. Syncom-2 was used for direct TV transmission of the Tokyo
Olympic Games in August 1964. These spacecraft continued successfully in service
until some time after 1965 and they marked the end of the experimental period.
Technically, all these satellites were being used primarily for ﬁxed satellite
service (FSS) experimental communications, which were used only to relay signals
from ﬁxed Earth stations (FES) at several locations around the world. Hence, one
FES was actually located aboard large transport vessel, the USNS Kingsport,
home-ported in Honolulu, Hawaii. The ship had been modiﬁed by the US Navy to
carry a 9.1 m parabolic antenna for tracking the Syncom satellites. The antenna dish
was protected, like present mobile antennas, from the marine environment by an
inﬂatable Dacron radome, requiring access to the 3-axis antenna through an air lock
within the ship. Otherwise, the Kingsport ship terminal was the world’s ﬁrst true
MES and could be considered the ﬁrst Ship Earth Station (SES). The ITU autho-
rized special frequencies for Syncom communication experiments at around
1.8 GHz for the downlink (space to Earth) and around 7.3 GHz for the uplink
(Earth to space). This project and trial was an unqualiﬁed success proving only
practically the GEO system for satellite communications, but because of the large
size of the Kingsport SES antenna, some experts in the 1960s concluded that MSC
at sea would never really be practical. However, it was clear that the potential to
provide a high-quality line-of-sight path from a ship to the land and vice versa via
the satellite transponder existed at this time.
Intelsat was founded in August 1964 as a global FSS operator. The ﬁrst com-
mercial GEO satellite was Early Bird (renamed as Intelsat-1) developed by Comsat
for Intelsat (see Fig. 1.12 (Right)). It was launched on April 6, 1965, and remained
active until 1969. Routing operations between the USA and Europe began on June
28, 1965, a date that should be recognized as the birthday of commercial FSS. The
satellite had 2 × 25 MHz width transponder bands, the ﬁrst with 2 Rx uplinks
(centered at 6.301 GHz for Europe and 6.390 GHz for the USA) and the second 2
Tx downlinks (centered at 4.081 GHz for Europe and 4.161 GHz for the USA),
with maximum transmission power of 10 W for each Tx. This GEO system used
several GES located within the USA and Europe, and so, the modern era of satellite
communications had begun.
In the meantime, considerable progress in satellite communications had been
made by the former USSR, the ﬁrst of which the Molniya-1 (Lightning) satellite
was launched at the same time as Intelsat-1 on April 25, 1965. These satellites were
put into an HEO, very different to those used by the early experiments, and were
18
1
Introduction

used for voice, fax, and video transmission from central FES near Moscow to a
large number of relatively small receive-only stations.
In other words, that time became the era of development of the international and
regional FSS with the launch of many communications spacecraft in the USSR,
USA, UK, France, Italy, China, Japan, Canada, and other countries. At ﬁrst, all
satellites were put in GEO, but later HEO and polar Earth orbits (PEO) were
proposed, because such orbits would be particularly suitable for use with MES at
high latitudes. The next step was the development of MSC for maritime and later
for land and aeronautical applications. The last step has to be the development of
the non-GEO systems of Little and Big low Earth orbits (LEO), HEO, and other
GEO constellations for new MSS for personal and other applications.
1.2.4
Early Progress in Mobile Satellite Communications
and Navigation
The ﬁrst successful experiments were carried out in aeronautical MSC. The Pan Am
airlines and NASA program in 1964 succeeded in achieving aeronautical satellite
links using the Syncom-3 GEO spacecraft. The frequencies used for experiments
were the VHF band (117.9–136 MHz), which had been allocated for aeronautical
MSC (AMSC).
The ﬁrst satellite navigation system, called Transit, was developed by the US
Navy and became operational in 1964. The great majority of the satellite navigation
receivers has worked with this system since 1967 and has already attracted about
100,000 mobile and ﬁxed users worldwide. The former USSR equivalent of the
Transit was the Cicada system developed almost at the same time.
Following the ﬁrst AMSC experiments, the Radiocommunications Subcommittee
of the Intergovernmental Maritime Consultative Organization (IMCO), as early as
1966, discussed the applicability of a maritime MSC (MMSC) to improve ship
communications. This led to further discussions at the 1967 ITU WARC for the
where it was recommended that detailed plan and study be undertaken of the
operational requirements and technical aspects of Maritime Mobile Satellite System
(MMSS) by the IMCO and CCIR administrations.
A little bit later, the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) performed
a similar role to that of IMCO (described earlier) by the fostering of interest in
Aeronautical
Mobile
Satellite
System
(AMSS)
for
air
trafﬁc
control
(ATC) purposes. The majority of early work was carried out by the Applications of
Space Technology to the Requirement of Aviation (Astra) technical panel. In the
proper manner, this panel considered the operational requirements for and the
design of suitable systems and much time was spent considering the choice of
frequency band. At the 1971 WARC, 2 × 14 MHz of spectrum, contiguous with
the MMSC spectrum, was allocated at L-band for safety use.
Hence, the work of the Astra panel led to the deﬁnition of the Aerosat project,
which aimed to provide an independent and near-global AMSC, navigation and
1.2
History of Radio
19

surveillance system for ATC, and airline operational control (AOC) purposes. The
Aerosat project unfortunately failed because, whereas both the ICAO authority and
world airlines of the International Air Transport Association (IATA) agreed on the
operational beneﬁts to be provided by such a system, there was total disagreement
concerning the scale, the form, and potential cost to the airlines. Finally, around
1969, the project failed for economic reasons.
The ﬁrst experiment with land MSC (LMSC) started in 1970 with the MUSAT
regional satellite program in Canada for the North American continent. However, in
the meantime, it appeared that the costs would be too high for individual countries
and that some sort of international cooperation was necessary to make MSS
globally available.
In 1971, the ICAO recommended an international program of research, devel-
opment, and system evaluation. Before all, the L-band was allocated for distress and
safety satellite communications and 2 × 4 MHz of frequency spectrum for MMSS
and AMSS needs, by the WARC held in 1971. According to the recommendations,
Canada, FAA of the USA, and ESA signed a memorandum of understanding in
1974 to develop the Aerosat system, which would be operated in the VHF and
L-bands. Although Aerosat was scheduled to be launched in 1979, the program was
canceled in 1982 because of ﬁnancial problems.
The ﬁrst GEP global MSC system was begun with the launch of the three
Marisat satellites in 1976 by Comsat General. Marisat spacecraft had a hybrid
payload: one transponder for US Navy ship operating on an UHF-band and another
one for commercial merchant ﬂeets utilizing newly allocated MMSC-bands. The
ﬁrst ofﬁcial mobile satellite telephone call in the world was established between
vessel oil platform “Deep Sea Explorer” operating close to the coast of Madagascar
and the Phillips Petroleum Company in Bartlesville, Oklahoma, USA, on July 9,
1976, using AOR CES and GEO of the Marisat system.
The IMCO convened an international conference in 1973 to consider the
establishment of an international organization to operate the MMSC system. The
International Conference met in London two years later to set up the structure of the
International Maritime Satellite (Inmarsat) organization. The Inmarsat Convention
and operating agreements were ﬁnalized in 1976 and opened for signature by states
wishing to participate. On July 16, 1979, these agreements entered into force and
were signed by 29 countries. The Inmarsat ofﬁcially went into operation on
February 1, 1982, with worldwide maritime services in the Paciﬁc, Atlantic, and
Indian Ocean regions, using only Inmarsat-A SES at ﬁrst. Moreover, the Marecs-1
B2A satellite was developed by nine European states in 1984 and launched for the
experimental MCS system Prodat, serving all the mobile applications.
In 1985, the COSPAS–SARSAT satellite search and rescue (SAR) mobile
system was declared operational. Three years later, the International COSPAS–
SARSAT Program Agreement was signed by Canada, France, USA, and the former
USSR. In 1992, the Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (GMDSS),
developed by the International Maritime Organization (IMO), before IMCO, began
its operational phase. Hence, in February 1999, the GMDSS became fully
20
1
Introduction

operational as an integration of Radio MF/HF/VHF (DSC), Inmarsat and
COSPAS–SARSAT LEOSAR, GEOSAR, and new developed MEOSAR systems.
The Transit system was switched off in 1996–2000 after more than 30 years of
reliable service. By then, the US Defense Department was fully converted to the new
Global Positioning System (GPS). However, the GPS could not have the market to
itself, and the ex-Soviet Union developed a similar system called Global Navigation
Satellite System (GLONASS) in 1988 and ceased the previous Cicada system. While
both, the Transit or Cicada system provides intermittent two-dimensional (latitude
and longitude when altitude is known) position ﬁxes every 90 min on average and
was best suited to marine navigation, the GPS or GLONASS system provides
continuous position and speed in all three dimensions, equally effective for navi-
gation and tracking at sea, on land and in the air. In the meantime, China started
development of own satellite navigation system known as Compass (BeiDou). It
consists of two separate satellite constellations that have been operating since 2000
and a full-scale global system that is currently under construction.
While both, the Transit or Cicada system provides intermittent two-dimensional
(latitude and longitude when altitude is known) position ﬁxes every 90 min on
average and was best suited to marine and aeronautical navigation, the GPS or
GLONASS system provides continuous position and speed in all three dimensions,
equally effective for navigation and tracking at sea, on land and in the air.
The US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) is reasonably encouraging
toward private development of the Radio Determination Satellite System (RDSS),
which would combine positioning ﬁxing with short messaging. Thus, in 1985,
Inmarsat developed the standard-C system and later examined the feasibility of adding
navigational capability by integrating GPS or GLONASS receiver in the mobile unit.
However, the ESA satellite navigation concept, called Navsat, dates back to the
1980s. Moreover, the proposed new project has received relatively little attention
and even less ﬁnancial support from investors. Since 1988, the US-based Company
Qualcomm for satellite communications and determination has established the
OmniTRACS service for mobile messaging and tracking. Soon after, Eutelsat
promoted a very similar system named EuroTRACS integrated with GPS and the
Emsat communications system.
At the beginning of this millennium, two-satellite augmentation systems were
developed for aeronautical communication, navigation, and surveillance (CNS): the
American WAAS, European EGNOS, Japanese MTSAT, Russian SDCM,
Chinese SNAS, and Indian GAGAN. The next similar project is ASAS network for
Africa and Middle East regions, as ﬁrst real venture into global satellite navigation
systems for Southern Hemisphere.
Hence, it will augment the two military satellite navigation systems now oper-
ating, the US GPS and the Russian GLONASS, and make them suitable for safety
critical applications such as ﬂying aircraft or navigating ships through narrow
channels and port approaches. This system is a joint project of the ESA, the
European Commission (EC), and Eurocontrol (the European Organization for the
Safety of Air Navigation) and will become fully operational for commercial usage
in 2004. The European Union contribution is the Global Navigation Satellite
1.2
History of Radio
21

System (GNSS) as a precursor to a new system known as Galileo. This full GNSS,
under development in Europe, is a joint initiative of the EC and the ESA in order to
reduce dependency on the GPS service. The target of new Galileo project is to start
with operations by 2005 and still is not clear when it will be fully operational.
In the meantime, several very interesting projects are developed in Europe,
Japan, and the USA for new mobile and ﬁxed multimedia stratospheric platform
communications systems powered by fuel or the Sun’s energy and manned or
unmanned aircraft or airships equipped with transponders and antenna systems at an
altitude of about 20–25 km.
1.3
Development of Global Mobile Satellite
Systems (GMSS)
Once the principles of radio systems were understood, mobile radiocommunications
have been a matter of steadily developing and perfecting the radio technologies and
innovations, extending accessibility and the possibility of radio networks,
enhancing range, extending coverage and reliability, reducing the size, cost, and
power consumption of radio devices, and improving efﬁciency.
However, with further MSC innovations, an age-long barrier was eliminated
between vessels and shore, vehicles (road and rails) and dispatch centers, and
aircraft and airports, and thus, facilities were created to provide mobile ofﬁces in
ships, land vehicles, and aircraft and to communicate with land Earth stations
(LES) independently of space, place, and time.
So, the world is going to reduce communications barriers and move people
across borders for business, social, safety, economic, technical, and prosperity
purposes. Therefore, the new mobile satellite industry must ensure that mobile
communications and navigation services will be responsive to these extraordinary
changes and globalization trends.
The MSC systems and technology also offer other beneﬁts and perspectives. In
many developing countries, telephone density is still at a low level in urban and
non-urban areas, because the cost of upgrading such facilities through wireless or
TTN means is prohibitive for much of the world areas. Remote, rural, and mobile
service sectors in many regions are outside the reach of communications facilities,
so the new MSS technology, with its instant ubiquitous coverage, may provide
cost-effective solutions for developing countries.
1.3.1
Deﬁnition of Global Mobile Satellite Communications
(GMSC)
The GMSC are GEO or non-GEO satellite systems, which refers to all communi-
cations solutions that provide global MSC service directly to end users from a
22
1
Introduction

satellite segment, ground satellite network and TTN landline and/or radio infras-
tructures. The term “GMSC” means not only global coverage but also includes
local or regional MSS solutions as an integral part of the worldwide telecommu-
nications village. Namely, some of the regional or local MSS can be afterward
integrated to establish a global MSC network. Table 1.1 gives an overview of
telecommunication systems showing the respective satellite ﬁt.
The GMSC solution is a modern mobile communication structure system, which
began providing communication links to vessels initially in the 1970s and later to
aircraft and all kinds of land vehicles. It must be noted that GMSC providing global
and regional coverage represents a new technology era in which wire terrestrial and
wireless cellular voice, image, video, and data systems are combined with MSC
applications to provide services available anytime and anywhere. Additionally, new
satellite
technologies,
such
as
current
Global
Mobile
Personal
Satellite
Communication (GMPSC) system and new very small aperture terminals (VSAT),
have also allowed global personal and commercial mobility for both satellite
communication and determination.
On the other hand, some of the new GEO or non-GEO GMPSC systems have
entered the ﬁeld of MSC solutions, which for the past 20 years has been occupied
predominately by intergovernmental satellite organizations. In recent years, a
growing number of private entities have been prepared to develop satellite tech-
nology, such as Iridium, Globalstar, and Orbcomm. Recently, the modern
DVB-RCS solutions are implemented more than a decade ago and are serving ﬁxed
and mobile applications.
At the same time, satellite technology and applications continue to advance; so
satellite mobile terminals have become smaller, better, and cheaper. Some GMSC
systems now being developed are the initiative of the private sector or consortiums.

This implies that there should be changes in policy, particularly in countries that do
not foresee sufﬁcient private participation in the telecommunication sectors to allow
these systems to thrive and to realize their potential.
As mentioned, GMSC systems can provide global or regional coverage. This
capability has raised questions about national sovereignty, integrity, and security of
a country covered by a particular GMSC network. Generally speaking, communi-
cation networks in the concerned country must always comply with national reg-
ulations that govern integrity and assistance to law enforcement and security
agencies. These typically have requirements for national routing, location deter-
mination, call monitoring, and legal interception. Therefore, seven categories of
players in the GMSC community can be identiﬁed:
1. National Regulatory Authorities—The international community has to rec-
ognize the sovereign right of each country to adopt its telecommunication
regulations and that the authority acts in the name of and on behalf of a certain
state. It is the responsibility of the National Regulatory Authorities, according to
their national laws, regulations, and policies, to grant the appropriate autho-
rization to allow GMSC services in a country.
2. GMSC System Operators—These are the owners or operators of the space
segment, who have assumed all the ﬁnancial, technical, and commercial risks of
developing a GMSC system applications and seek the harmonization of pro-
cedures governing the provision of GMSC services to avoid a proliferation of
administrative impediments liable to constrain the development of the market.
3. GMSC Gateway/LES Operators—Gateways are land Earth stations (LES) or
GES links between the space segment and TTN, from which, as main sources,
GMSC terminal trafﬁc is drawn. The LES in some cases, depending on the
business structure of the GMSC system, can be considered as a part of the space
segment and can be managed by the GMSC satellite network operator.
4. PSTN Operators—The traditional PSTN operators provide most telecommu-
nication services and networks, both wired and wireless, in a certain country.
Furthermore, they are indispensable business partners and responsible for
interconnection with terrestrial landline telecommunication networks.
5. Local and/or Regional Service Providers—Local service providers are
responsible for the local or regional provision of GMSC services, distributing
GMSC terminals and billing GMSC customers. Otherwise, GMSC system or
gateway operators could also be local or regional service providers.
6. GMSC Terminal Manufacturers—These are companies that manufacture
MSC and semi-ﬁxed terminals for mobiles, including GEO and non-GEO
satellite networks.
7. GMSC Terminal Users—These are the customers whom all the other players
are called upon to serve. They should receive good-quality service at the best
possible price, within the strict conﬁnes of the laws and regulations of the host
countries.

Introduction

1.3.2
Deﬁnition of Global Navigation Satellite Systems
(GNSS)
The ﬁrst GNSS generation offers augmentation systems in addition to the basic GPS
and GLONASS constellations in order to achieve the level of performance suitable
for enhanced maritime routing applications worldwide, especially in narrow pas-
sages, coastal navigation, and approaching ports, for augmented civil aviation
applications in oceanic and approaching ﬂight, for land vehicles, and also for
ground positioning and surveying.
The GPS as a ﬁrst generation of GNSS network is a satellite all-weather,
full-jam-resistant, continuous operation radio navigation system, which utilizes
precise range measurements from the GPS satellites to determine exact position and
time anywhere in the world. This system provides military, civilian and commercial
maritime, land, aeronautical, and ground users with highly accurate worldwide
three-dimensional, common-grid, position, and location data, as well as velocity
and precision timing to accuracies that have not previously been easily attainable.
The GPS service is based on the concept of triangulation from known points similar
to the technique of “resection” used with a map and compass, except that it is done
with radio signals transmitted by satellites. The GPS receiver must determine when
a signal is sent from selected GPS satellites and the time it is received. Nothing
except a GPS receiver is needed to use the system, which does not transmit any
signals; therefore, they are not electronically detectable. Because they only receive
RF satellite signals, there is no limit to the number of simultaneous GPS users.
The GPS satellite constellation is also providing facilities for new augmentation
system known as Global Satellite Augmentation System (GSAS). Today are
developed three Regional Satellite Augmentation Systems (RSAS) such as the US
Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), the Japanese MTSAT Satellite-based
Augmentation System (MSAS), and the European Geostationary Navigation
Overlay Service (EGNOS). Recently, were projected or are in development stage
other four RSAS such as the Russian System of Differential Correction and
Monitoring (SDCM), the Chinese Satellite Navigation Augmentation System
(SNAS), Indian GPS/GLONASS and GEOS Augmented Navigation (GAGAN),
and African Satellite Augmentation System (ASAS) designed by the author.
The Russian Federation (former USSR) provides the GLONASS service from
space for accurate determination of position, velocity, and time for mobile or ﬁxed
users worldwide and in all weather conditions anywhere. Therefore, three-
dimensional position and velocity determinations are based upon the measurement
of transit time and Doppler shift of RF signals transmitted by GLONASS satellites.
The GLONASS satellite constellation as a ﬁrst generation of GNSS will also
provide signals for all RSAS infrastructures.
At this point, the GPS and GLONASS are parts of the ﬁrst generation of GNSS
known as GNSS-1, and there are in development phase other two GNSS of second
generation known as GNSS-2 systems, such as the European Galileo and Chinese
Compass.

Development of Global Mobile Satellite Systems (GMSS)
25

The GNSS consists of many players with similar GMSC systems and three
major segments:
(1) The space segment has 24 satellites (21 functioning satellites and 3 on-orbit
spares) and is controlled by a proprietary satellite operator or service provider.
(2) The control segment is operated by master control and monitor stations.
(3) The user segment is represented by the military and civilian authorities for
maritime, land, and aeronautical users located worldwide. This segment offers
standard positioning service (SPS) and precise positioning service (PPS),
available to all users around the world. Access to the SPS does not require
approval by a certain service provider, but PPS is only available to authorized
users via the service provider administration.
1.3.3
Network Architecture of GMSC
The increased availability of MSS and GNSS solutions means that many mobiles
and individuals will have radio connections and determinations at their disposal
whenever and wherever they are traveling, including worldwide shipping,
long-distance road and railway haulage, transcontinental ﬂights, and universal
personal handheld terminals. The new MSC technology is very attractive to mar-
iners, drivers, and aviators alike. As discussed, the MSS began in the 1970s for
vessels and ocean rigs; land vehicles have been served at a modest level since the
late 1980s, but a stage of rapid development began in the mid-1990s; service to
aircraft has started to grow faster than that for land vehicles since 1992. The MSC
system consists of space and ground segments, represented by communications
satellites, and the ground segment comprises different types of MES and networks.
1.3.3.1
Space Segment and Conﬁguration of MCS Links
The space segment provides the connection between the subscribers onshore and
mobile users via LES or gateways. It consists of one or more operational or spare
spacecraft in a corresponding constellation. The satellite constellation can be
formed by a particular type of orbit, such as GEO, non-GEO (LEO, PEO, and
HEO), or combinations of these orbits. The satellites can be independent or con-
nected with each other through intersatellite link (ISL) or interorbit link (IOL). The
space segment can be shared among different radio networks in different areas in
both time and space. There are also special constellations of multipurpose satellites,
whose platform can serve more than two payloads, such as a combination of
communication, meteorological, and navigational payloads.
An MSC link is an RF connection between an LES or gateway stations and MES
via GEO or non-GEO satellites. The part of the MSC link between LES and satellite
is called feeder link, while the link between the MES and the satellite is called the
26
1
Introduction

service link. Both feeder and service links consist of an uplink from the ground
toward a satellite and a downlink in the opposite direction, and both fall under the
category of MSS. The feeder link of the LES is categorized as a ﬁxed utilization in
MSS and not at all as a part of FSS as is stated in the MSS Handbook published by
ITU, page no. 78. Therefore, the location of LES in MSS is ﬁxed and is not a part of
FSS, although some LES in MSS can also provide FSS.
1.3.3.2
Ground Segment and Networks
The ground segment consists of two major network elements: user mobile or
portable terminals and ground support stations. The user network comprises four
main categories whose characteristics are highly related to its applications and
operational environments:
1. Mobile Earth Stations (MES)—The MES group of terminals are designed for
group usage and installation on board collective transport systems such as Ship
Earth Stations (SES) mounted on ships and other ﬂoating objects at sea, on
lakes, and on rivers; Vehicle Earth Stations (VES) mounted on road or railway
vehicles; and Aircraft Earth Stations (AES) mounted on airplanes, helicopters,
and other ﬂying objects. Otherwise, the MES terminals are composed of
in-mobile and out-of-mobile and outdoor equipment such as above deck
equipment (ADE) and below deck equipment (BDE) for ships; above haul
device (AHD) and below haul device (BHD) for land vehicles; and above
cockpit unit (ACU) and below cockpit unit (BCU) for aircraft.
2. Personal Earth Stations (PES)—The PES often refer to handheld or palmtop
devices for personal utility and carriage in hand, pocket, or bag. The transceiver
and antenna are integrated into one unit together with an additional antenna for
cellular roaming. Other PES categories include those situated on board a mobile
platform, such as small ships, cars, and airplanes, or they can be transformed as
a public payphones in rural areas, ships, oil rigs, and airplanes or can be
installed as a ﬁxed ofﬁce unit with outdoor antenna.
3. Transportable Earth Stations (TES)—The TES terminals are typically similar
in dimensions to those of a briefcase or laptop computer. As the name implies,
these terminals can be transported from one remote or rural site to another;
however, operation while mobile will not normally be supported. Every TES
contains the transceiver modem and antenna units and can also serve as indoor
equipment.
4. Fixed Earth Stations (FES)—The FES terminals are similar to public urban
payphones or ﬁxed ofﬁce units in both urban and suburban rural areas. These
units with antenna can be mounted in some rural areas for public service, while
ofﬁce units can be mounted like remote household or business sites.
The ground network consists of six main network elements, which support,
maintain, and control the space segment and user network as follows:
1.3
Development of Global Mobile Satellite Systems (GMSS)
27

1. Land Earth Stations (LES)—The LES infrastructure is actually a gateway
station for MSC service and provides an interface to the satellite access network
and existing TTN, such as PSTN/PLMN/ISDN via local exchanges. A single
LES can be associated with a particular spot beam or global beam or can access
the FSS network. Similarly, LES could provide access to more than one spot or
global beam in cases where the coverage of beams overlaps. The main structure
of LES can be an external antenna system and the internal sets of RF/IF com-
ponents, trafﬁc channel equipment (TCE), and gateway subsystems. The syn-
onym LES is usually used for Inmarsat MSS in general, for all types of gateways.
The Coast Earth Stations (CES) are for Inmarsat maritime and land applications,
while Ground Earth Stations (GES) are for aeronautical applications only.
2. Network Control Centers (NCC)—The NCC, also known as the Network
Management Station (NMS), is connected to the Customer Information
Management System (CIMS) to coordinate access to the satellite resource and
perform the logical functions associated with network management (NMF) and
control function (NCF) facilities. In fact, the NMF can include the following:
development of call trafﬁc proﬁles; congestion control; system resource man-
agement and network synchronization solutions; provision of support in user
terminal commissioning; operation and maintenance (OAM) functions; and the
management of interstation signaling links.
The NCF service includes common channel signaling functions, deﬁnition of
gateway conﬁgurations, and gateway selection for any mobile station origina-
tion. The CIMS is responsible for maintaining gateway conﬁguration data,
performing system billing and accounting, and processing call detail records.
Thus, the third element of the entire GMSC network can be the control segment,
consisting of NCC, SCC, and CIMS.
3. Satellite Control Centers (SCC)—The SCC monitors the current performance
of a certain space segment and controls the satellite’s position in orbit. The
spacecraft control functions include the following elements: generation and
distribution of satellite ephemera; generation and transmission of commands for
inclined orbit operations, payload, and bus; reception and processing of
telemetry; transmission of beam-pointing commands; and performance of range
calibration. The call control function is associated with SCC, which includes the
provision of real-time switching for mobile-to-mobile calls.
4. Network Coordination Stations (NCS)—One NCS serves one ocean region to
monitor and control communication trafﬁc within four Inmarsat ocean regions:
AORW, AORE, IOR, and POR. Each NCS communicates with LES in its own
ocean region using special interstation signaling links, with other NCS sites and
with NCC located in Inmarsat headquarters, making possible the transfer of
information throughout the system. The NCS is involved in setting up calls to
and from MES and in assessing the channel to which both the MES and LES are
to tune for the call. For these functions to be performed, each MES Rx must
initially be synchronized to the NCS common channel and logged into the NCS
for its ocean region.
28

Introduction

5. Local User Terminal (LUT)—The LUT is a special ground Rx station that
receives alert data from COSPAS–SARSAT satellites of old LEOSAT and
GEOSAT including new MEOSAT constellations, derives the position of the
satellite beacons (EPIRB, PLB, and ELT), retrieves/checks coded information,
and forwards the resultant information to the convenient MCC.
6. Mission Control Center (MCC)—The MCC is a ground main infrastructure of
the COSPAS–SARSAT system which receives alert data from its LUT ground
receiving stations and distributes that information to afﬁliate SAR points of
contact or forwards it to other MCC, or vice versa.
7. Rescue Coordination Centers (RCC)—The RCC operates a system respon-
sible for promoting the efﬁcient organization of SAR service under the
LEOLUT, GEOLUT, and MEOLUT COSPAS–SARSAT system and for
coordinating the conduct of distress and SAR operations with other MES within
a certain on-scene region. All MES have to be equipped with adequate satellite
beacons on board ships (EPIRB), vehicles (PLB), and aircraft (ELT).
8. Terrestrial Telecommunications Network (TTN)—The TTN element is a
local ground exchange service, which provides an interface between subscribers
ashore and gateways, i.e., mobile users.
1.4
GMSC Applications
The present GMSC systems are in use for maritime, land, and aeronautical appli-
cations. Recently, several personal mobile multipurpose applications using GEO
and non-GEO satellites have been developed and introduced. The lately developed
regional networks using stratospheric aircraft and airship platforms will be intro-
duced as very low orbital satellite systems.
1.4.1
Maritime Mobile Satellite Communications (MMSC)
The commercial MMSC systems are designated for very large and medium
oceangoing vessels, passenger cruisers, small coastal and river ships, ﬁshing boats,
pleasure yachts, and rescue boats. These systems are also available for navy vessels,
offshore rigs, and platforms, including any kind of off/onshore infrastructures.
The MMSC system is a successor to the conventional maritime radiocommu-
nications system, which for almost a century was very successful on the commercial
and distress scene at sea. In fact, the biggest MSS operator for MMSC is Inmarsat,
while other global, regional, or local GEO or non-GEO systems providing MMSC
are Iridium, Globalstar, Optus, Emsat, Thuraya, MSAT, AMSC, N-Star, Orbcomm,
Leo One, and others who have introduced their own MMSS.
1.3
Development of Global Mobile Satellite Systems (GMSS)
29

1.4.1.1
Maritime Transportation Augmentation System (MTAS)
The development of the MTAS was to identify the possible applications for
enhancement of global DCS MF/HF/VHF radio and satellite communication,
navigation, surveillance, and safety systems including transport security and control
of vessels and freight at sea, on lakes, and on rivers, and the security of passengers
on board cruisers and hovercrafts. These enhancements include many applications
for the better management and operation of vessels and they are needed more than
ever because of world merchant ﬂeet expansion. Just the top 20 world ship registers
have about 40,000 units under their national ﬂags. Above all, the biggest problem
today is that merchant ships and their crews are targets of the types of crime
traditionally associated with the maritime industries, such as piracy, robbery, and
recently, a target for terrorist attacks. Thus, IMO and ﬂag states will have a vital
role in developing International Ship and Port Security (ISPS). The best way to
implement ISPS is to design a port control system by special code augmentation
satellite tracking, monitoring, and surveillance of all vehicle circulation in and out
of the port area. The establishment of MTAS will meet most of these requirements
and will complement the services already provided by marine radio beacons.
1.4.1.2
Service for MMSC Users
The ﬁrst-class two-way MMSC will be essential for mariners to contact and con-
stantly exchange information between vessels, owners, agents, shippers, port
authorities, families, and friends, to deal with emergencies, distress, and rescue
situations at sea. Navy ships can use these facilities for ﬂeet defense, tactical,
emergency, and information purposes. Therefore, shippers will be nearer to their
ﬂeet units, using not only commercial MSC but also reliable distress and intership
communications, and will also have important 24-hour maritime safety information
(MSI), such as weather (WX) and navigation warning (NX).
1.4.2
Land Mobile Satellite Communications (LMSC)
The development of LMSC application for vehicles ﬁrst started with the unsuc-
cessful Canadian MUSAT regional program in 1970. The earliest experiment was
carried out in the USA, where it was realized that the cellular system could not
economically provide coverage of vast rural areas, as could MSC. After the cellular
system was allocated the spectrum of 810–960 MHz, the ITU WARC-97 allocated
sections of this band to the LMSS in regions 2 and 3 only. This allocation stim-
ulated much research in North America with the initiation of Canadian MSAT and
NASA/JPL MSAT-X projects. The MSAT LMSS would be operated by TMI
(Telesat Mobile Inc.), a joint venture between Telesat, Canadian Paciﬁc, and C Itoh.
30

Introduction

In the meantime, the US-based Marisat network was developed and the next
ESA Prosat program, which started in 1982 with the initial phase, involved a
number of propagation experiments via the Marecs AOR spacecraft. Furthermore,
the American Mobile Satellite Consortium (AMSC) in the USA and TMI in
Canada, were both inaugurated in 1988 and started to collaborate on a low-bit-rate
messages of MSC system in 1991, in the same way as Inmarsat-C, by leasing
Marisat and Inmarsat transponders. The ﬁrst AMSC and MSAT spacecraft were
launched in 1995 and 1996, respectively. Both establish the interim use of
Inmarsat-C for LMSS.
However, this is perhaps one of the major reasons why Inmarsat has decided to
reconﬁgure AOR into two regions, AORE and AORW, in order to improve cov-
erage of the North American land mass.
In Europe, a less ambitious scheme has been initiated such as the unsuccessful
Swedish Trucksat project. The geographic nature of Europe is very attractive for
LMSS because of the predominant high-mountain localities and many small
countries, which are not at all convenient for cellular roaming. Therefore, the ESA
has been considering, together with Eutelsat, the possibility of including an L-band
transponder on the Eutelsat II spacecraft to provide a space segment for a new MSC
solution known as the European Land Mobile Satellite System (ELMSS). The
discussions about this project were unsuccessful, and ESA is now considering the
use of Italsat as a host satellite.
In addition, Australia has become a new domestic MSS provider via the
Australian MSC operator Optus (former Aussat), who decided to include an L-band
transponder on their second-generation B1-series spacecraft and to allow the pro-
vision of LMSS service in rural areas. They introduced the new MSS Optus in
1992, compatible with both AMSC and MSAT systems, launched for the com-
mercial Australian market in 1994 and provided the AMSC service as well.
Similarly,
Japan
commenced
with
MSS
implementation
within
the
large
Experimental Mobile Satellite System (EMSS) program funded by the Japanese
Ministry of Post and Telecommunications. In effect, this project has included the
launch of the ETS-V satellite, the development, experiments, and trial of various
speech and data-only LMSC terminals.
Inmarsat also started in 1988 with LMSC service, proposing its second standard
Inmarsat-C two-way data-only system. This standard was initially developed for
ships but was later adapted for land and air services. For such reasons, several trials
were carried out by ESA throughout Europe to establish its performances. After
some time, the MOBSAT Group carried out comparative trials of Inmarsat-C and
the ESA Prodat and concluded in early 1989 that while Prodat provides a higher
throughput under realistic operating conditions, the Inmarsat-C was preferable due
to its more ﬂexible network conﬁguration. Soon after, Inmarsat proposed a low-cost
MSC telephony system, known as Inmarsat-M, compatible with the service pro-
posed by AMSC, MSAT, and Optus.
The next standard suitable for LMSC network is Inmarsat Mini-M, designed to
exploit the spot beam power of the old generation of Inmarsat-3 and new Inmarsat-4
1.4
GMSC Applications
31

and -5 satellites, as the smallest, lightest, and most cost-effective MSC unit ever
made.
All systems discussed above have been developed to use L-band frequency
spectrum
via
the
ITU
WARK
MOB-97.
The
new
initiative,
Qualcomm
OmniTRACS system has been developed to use the secondary LMSC location at
Ku-band (11/14 GH). This US-based project started in 1986, and trials were carried
out two years later. The OmniTRACS system has also been trialed in Europe, using
Eutelsat I-F1 spacecraft during the summer of 1989. However, soon after, Eutelsat
announced the intention to launch their own service known as EutelTRACS, based
on the OmniTRACS CDMA system.
1.4.2.1
Land Transportation Augmentation System (LTAS)
The LTAS network has been set up to identify the possible applications for global
radio and satellite communication system, navigation, tracking, determination,
safety systems, transport security and control of all vehicles and freight on roads
and railways, including the security of passengers in buses and trains.
Namely, these enhancements will comprehend the local and regional road and
railway transportation, including a drastic density of vehicles on the roads and
railways, which in the future will need some regulation and control using aug-
mentation satellite communication, and positioning and tracking solutions.
Therefore, this potential beneﬁt will assist vehicle tracking and control to cope with
increased trafﬁc and to improve the safety and control of track lines and signaling.
1.4.2.2
Service for LMSC Users
On a worldwide scale, millions of medium to large trucks, buses, cars, trains, and
other types of land vehicles lack any form of in-cab communications with their
dispatch bases, owners, agents, families, and friends, or the capability to deal with
emergencies such as damage to cargo, engine breakdowns, collisions, and rescue
situations on the roads. Now, transport companies can locate their vehicle ﬂeet and
stay in touch with them, no matter where and when they roam. In the same spirit,
bus and railway companies can always be in contact with their rolling stock and
coach and train personnel and passengers will have the possibility to make private
phone calls. The best LMSC solutions on board road and railway vehicles will be
the utilization of MSC service by two-way low-bit-rate data and message facilities
in combination with voice-only services such as Inmarsat-C and Inmarsat Mini-M
standards, respectively. Besides, there are similar solutions such as Iridium,
Globalstar, Optus, AMSC, MSAT, OmniTRACS, and other systems also suited for
Army ground forces.

Introduction

1.4.3
Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Communications
(AMSC)
Commercial AMSS is being implemented for aircraft and helicopters, though the
different service varies widely depending upon the group or aircraft concerned. The
general aviation communities with large aircraft ﬂying worldwide are potential
users of AMSS, while light airplanes ﬂying short routes are not now considered to
be the potential users of MSS for economic reasons. The Army ground forces are
also potential users of AMSC terminals.
1.4.3.1
Development of AMSC
As discussed, the MUSAT system was the ﬁrst LMSS in the VHF 200–400 MHz
band, developed by Canadian specialists and started in 1970, also providing AMSC
experiments, mainly for military applications, using the ATS-6 spacecraft. This
program was changed to the new MSAT for all three applications in 1980 because
the 800 MHz band was allocated to MSS by the WARC-79. The next program was
designed by Japanese experts to develop an AMSC and MMSC and started with
exploitation in 1975.
The ESA started with the Prosat system in 1982 to contribute to the Inmarsat
system. The ICAO embarked on a study into the Future Air Navigation System
(FANS) and new concept of ADSS using the MSC system in 1985. The ADSS was
developed and ﬁnally accepted as the future prime means of aircraft surveillance
and control over oceanic and remote regions.
The Oasis study carried out and completed a research project in 1982 by
Stanford Research Laboratories, which conﬁrmed the beneﬁts of MSS in terms of
improving ATC in ocean areas and recommended that “satellites of opportunity” be
considered as a way of easing the ﬁnancial burden of introducing such a system.
Thus, the Inmarsat organization noted this recommendation and commissioned
the Oasis study to investigate the applicability of the Inmarsat system to the AMSS.
This study was started by Racal Decca and conﬁrmed that a 200 b/s data service
could be provided to aircraft using 0 dBi antennas and the existing Inmarsat space
constellation, which was considered for ATC and AOC, including the provision of
data service to passengers. The Oasis study was practically validated by Racal at the
1984 Farnborough International Air Show using aircraft-to-ground data links via
Inmarsat AOR satellite and British BT Goonhilly GES.
Following the successful events at this air show, the Skyphone consortium was
formed by Racal, BT, and British Airways (BA) to design and develop a system
capable of supporting preoperational trials of a public telephony service for pas-
sengers on a few BA long-haul airplanes.
A similar experiment was performed by Comsat Labs, in conjunction with Mitre,
Collins, and Ball Aerospace, in 1985. Simultaneously, ESA was working on the
Prosat program that at ﬁrst included propagation measurements of the aeronautical
1.4
GMSC Applications
33

channels. Furthermore, in the second phase, the ESA program will be renamed
Prodat in consideration of the design and prolonged demonstration of the two-way
low-rate data transmission system for all GMSC applications.
The USA-based program, developed by the ARINC organization, commenced in
1985. This project proposed the AvSat system to provide integrated voice and data
AMSS between air and ground services throughout the world. AvSat developed a
system in 1986 based on six satellites with the advanced TDMA scheme. However,
this program collapsed because of the excessive costs of deploying a six-satellite
constellation, leaving Inmarsat as the only provider of L-band links, so in 1986,
Inmarsat conﬁrmed its intention to set up a versatile AMSS and invitations were
issued to tender for the development of the avionics.
The world’s ﬁrst aeronautical telephone call from a commercial jetliner over
transoceanic ﬂight routes was successfully carried out from a Japan Air Lines
(JAL) aircraft Boeing 747 in October 1987 using the Inmarsat space and ground
satellite segments. Otherwise, this experiment was jointly carried out by KDD,
JAL, and CRL of the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications in Japan. It was
based on ETS-V/EMSS research and development program of CRL, which was
reorganized from AMES in 1984.
The other signiﬁcant AMSS voice trials were conducted by the Inmarsat, British
Telecom (BT), BA, and Racal Decca companies and conducted a Skyphone service
in May 1988, using a fully avionics-compliant package located in the bay of BA
Boeing 747 aircraft, not in the passenger cabin.
The AMSS L-band frequencies, which had been exclusively allocated for ATC
and ACC, were opened to APC at WARC-87. With these trends, L-band became
the most suitable spectrum for integrated GMSC, which provides worldwide service
to ships, land vehicles, and aircraft. Since 1990 Inmarsat has carried out a program
of AMSC tests, demonstrations and trials later started to lead an AMSC service.
Accordingly, large airways companies worldwide can now use Inmarsat for reliable
corporate, social, and safety AMSC service.
The Inmarsat system is not ideal for AMSC, in particular because some
scheduled ﬂights are using lines far over the North Pole, beyond the coverage of
GEO. Meanwhile, this problem can be solved similarly to MMSC, by using inte-
grated Radio and Satellite Mobile Communications under GMDSS and establishing
a Global Aeronautical Distress and Safety System (GADSS). On the other hand, by
using a combination of GEO and PEO or HEO constellations, the coverage problem
for both polar zones will be solved.
1.4.3.2
Present Status of Aeronautical Communications
Business or corporate airlines have for several decades used HF communication for
long-range voice and Tlx communications during intercontinental ﬂights. For short
distances, nearby airports during approach or departures, all aircraft have used the
well-known VHF/UHF radio. Data communications are since recently also in use,
primarily for ﬂight plan and worldwide weather (WX) reporting in a form similar to
34
1
Introduction

the VHF/UHF Airborne Flight Information Service (AFIS) system. Apart from data
service for the aircraft cockpit and cabin crew, cabin voice solutions and passenger
telephony have also been developed. On the other hand, some airlines servicing
major transcontinental routes have provided free telephone services to passengers as
marketing ploys, whereas others want the service to generate additional revenue.
The airline data service requirements are divided into two main areas: AAC-AOC
(Airline Administrative and Airline Operational Control) and ATC services. Efﬁcient
operation of modern aircraft requires that automatic engine airframe health monitoring
and control is available wherever the aircraft is ﬂying. Worldwide access to remote
databases while in ﬂight is required for optimum ﬂight proﬁle planning. Therefore, the
ARINC (Aeronautical Radio Inc.) program named ARINC Communication and
Reporting
System
(ACARS)
and
the
SITA
(Societé
Internationale
de
Télécomommunications Aeronautique) system known as AIRCOM still provide these
facilities via VHF radio,althoughthey have started to use AMSC to makethese services
available worldwide and more effectively.
The success of Inmarsat MMSC and LMSC systems together with the rapid
growth of VHF air-to-ground radiocommunications has encouraged the develop-
ment of the AMSC system. Avionics companies have the best solution to organize
MSC links and within their own ﬂeets and also to enable reliable voice, fax, video,
image, data, and Internet service for their passengers, crew members, and corporate
purposes. At present, Inmarsat is the only global operator providing the AMSC
service, while other GEO and non-GEO operators also provide AMSC, such as
Globalstar, Iridium, Optus, AMSC, and MSAT.
As with Inmarsat’s MMSC system, the AMSC service is provided to users via
the Inmarsat signatories, who are predominantly national PTT or telecommunica-
tions organizations. In the meantime, several competing service provider agree-
ments have been announced with US-based Arinc, Japanese Avicom, Satellite
Aircom Consortium of France Telecom, SITA, Teleglobe Canada and Telstra
Australia, Skyphone Consortium of `BT, Singapore’s SingTel and Telenor and the
Multinational Skyways Alliance led by Comsat.
1.4.3.3
Aeronautical Transportation Augmentation System (ATAS)
The ATAS has been set up to identify the possible applications for global radio and
satellite communication, navigation, surveillance, and safety systems including
security and control of aircraft, freight and passengers, and SAR service in
accordance with ICAO regulations and recommendations. The world’s commercial
airline ﬂeet is expected to double in the next 20 years, which will result in crowded
routes, leading to fuel wastage and delays, which could cost millions of dollars
annually. In this sense, the new augmentation system for aeronautical satellite
CNS/ATM is designed to assist navigation both en route and during landing and in
airports. In fact, the potential beneﬁts will assist ATC to cope with increased air
trafﬁc as well as improving safety and reducing the infrastructure needed on the
ground.

When planning aircraft routes and landing schedules at busy airports, it is
essential to ensure that aircraft are always a safe distance from each other. The
trouble is that it is not always possible to know where the planes are. Thus, it is
necessary to leave a very large safety margin, but when it is possible to know
precisely where the planes are, it will be easy to reduce the margins safely and
increase the numbers of planes in each corridor. At any rate, the new WAAS,
EGNOS, MTSAT, and forthcoming Galileo GNSS will provide a guaranteed ser-
vice with sufﬁcient accuracy to allow airlines and pilots to know their current
position and safety margins reliably and precisely enough to make substantial
efﬁciency savings.
The GNSS can also help pilots to land planes safely, especially in poor weather
and dense fog, in which only with DGPS or the augmented satellite CNS system is
reliable. Unfortunately, small airports are unlikely to invest in this system, but they
can use local augmented system, or when Galileo becomes operational, the need for
a differential antenna will reduce costs. Galileo’s guaranteed service and use of dual
frequencies will increase accuracy and reliability to such an extent that planes will
be able to use its navigational signals for guidance with their onboard technology
alone.
1.4.3.4
Service for AMSC Users
New aeronautical services will provide mile-high opportunities to bring AMSC to
general aviation planes, commercial airlines, helicopters, their crew members, and
passengers. They can use air-to-ground AMSC facilities to optimize commercial
and safety communications, fuel, maintenance, and revenue demands. All the
communication features found in the ofﬁce are made available in the airborne
environment, with direct dialing and continuous global coverage. The AMSC
service allows passengers, pilots, and crew to communicate critical business deci-
sions or social, private, and conﬁdential cockpit and seat phone calls.
The airborne equipment enables direct-dial phone calls, data and messaging
services, HSD, Internet, e-mail, e-commerce, videoconferencing, databases, and
aeronautical information services (AIS), such as news highlights, WX reports, and
stock market information. The GMSC system beneﬁts long-, medium-, and
short-haul airline customers by facilitating accurate positional information for better
aircraft utilization, more productivity, and good air trafﬁc management and they are
very important for increasing airline revenues. In this way, except for crew and
passenger service, Aircraft Operation Management, ATC, and HSD/ISDN services
through the Swift64 Inmarsat system integrated with GNSS solutions will offer two
very important services:
1. Aircraft Security Control—All planes can be provided with the service of
aeronautical safety information (ASI) via satellites, such as turbulence warnings,
weather (WX), and ace reports to assure safe ﬂights. Antihijacking actions are
important for the safety of lives and property on board aircraft, as hijacking is
36

Introduction

usually violent, causing injury or death among crew and passengers or the loss
of valuable cargo. All airports have security control of passengers on all gates,
but it will also be important to ﬁnd out how the AMSC system can provide
automatic surveillance and monitoring of aircraft and cargo before departure.
2. Remote Troubleshooting System (RTS)—For almost one year, Dassault
Aviation has been using the Inmarsat-ISDN solution for a new remote analysis
and technical assistance system called Telemaque. It enables the technical
support specialists at Dassault Aviation to carry out all diagnoses or repair
operations in real time with customer sites located anywhere in the world.
Using an audio and video system connected to an Inmarsat-ISDN transmitting
(Tx) antenna, the aircraft sends images in real time to the technical support team
at Dassault, enabling them to identify the fault precisely. Besides, secure soft-
ware for application sharing and ﬁle transfer enables the two teams to connect
up and work on the same documents, such as databases and plans of the aircraft
located at the Dassault ofﬁce. Dassault Aviation started with Global Telemaque
Service (GTS) to all its customers in 2001, which offered video camera, a digital
camera, an Inmarsat antenna, a PC, an earpiece, and remote maintenance
software.
1.4.4
Global Mobile Personal Satellite Communications
(GMPSC)
At the beginning of the 1990s, several private US ﬁrms proposed new concepts for
MSC known as GMPSC, using a group of LEO or MEO spacecraft. Typical sys-
tems were Iridium, Globalstar, and Odyssey. In 1991, Inmarsat also proposed the
new Project 21, named Inmarsat-P, which would provide GMSC for personal
applications using non-GEO systems. After feasibility studies, Project 21 is now
going to use the ICO, which is the same as MEO and belongs to ICO Global
Communications. With regard to this, in 1992, WARC-92 responded to these
activities and allocated the L-band (1626.5–631.5 MHz) and S-band (2483.5–
2500 MHz) for MMS using LEO or MEO satellites.
Those people living and working far from the reach of cellular wireless net-
works, for example, roaming construction engineers, exploration workers, medical
staff, journalists, rangers, farmers, ﬁshing boat or yacht crew members, and small
planes or helicopters, can also have access to the GMSC network. Namely, every
customer can choose to use satellite and/or a convenient cellular network when they
are in urban roaming areas, because mobile phones will be dual-mode and
triple-mode handsets. Therefore, it is possible to produce dual-mode satellite/GSM
handheld phones (the waterproof boat kit solution is optional) and triple-mode
satellite/cellular models for D-AMPS/AMPS or for CDMA/AMPS systems.
The GMPSC handsets are lightweight, easy to carry, simple to use, and, similar
to current mobile phones, are able to provide a GMSC service with both satellite
1.4
GMSC Applications
37

and cellular network accesses. These phones can offer voice, fax, data, SMS, and
voice mail. The dimensions of unit are about 54 × 26 × 145 mm and about 240 g
in weight. The graphic display is with ﬁxed icons, and keypad consists of 6
menu-driven soft keys. This unit can support European Community, East European,
Chinese, English, and other languages. The delivery features include voice, data,
and fax messaging in both satellite and cellular modes. The handset has manual or
automatic satellite/GSM mode selection, using a small extending antenna.
The special, rugged GMPSC equipment with external antenna can be ﬁtted on
board ships, land vehicles, or aircraft similar to the shipborne, vehicleborne, and
airborne Inmarsat solutions. Otherwise, similar equipment is designed for use in
rural and remote (R&R) environments as well. Three billion people living in remote
villages and households have no access to a cellular or landline network using
semi-ﬁxed installations, but providing this telephone service to remote rural areas is
often very slow, complex, and quite an expensive project. The GMPSC system can
extend the existing telephone utilization to any location in the world, with more
products and solutions and with much cheaper equipment and usage charges,
providing the following services:
1. Rural Villages and Remote Communities—The GMPSC model of rural
payphone will offer the ability to communicate with any location in the world
using voice facilities and emergency numbers for access to medical, ﬁre-
ﬁghting, or security services.
The terminal will be similar to a typical city payphone operated by phone
cards, ruggedly constructed to withstand vandalism, simple to use, and able to
indicate the amount of money remaining on the card and will be powered
using mains network supply or solar panels and batteries. Additional services
include remote fault diagnosis and local support to ensure rapid repair and
high availability. This payphone can be used in remote suburban and village
environments, in desert and forest areas, on cruise ships, onboard aircraft, sea
platforms, and oil rigs. They are easy and cost-effective to install and operate,
using prepaid chip cards. Local authorities can use payphones for emergency
calls, using a special access card.
2. Phones for Remote Households—The GMPSC model of an indoor phone
offers every remote household connection to TTN via a standard phone set
connected to an interface box and external outdoor antenna mounted on the
roof. This box can be linked to standard tel/fax or ISDN/Internet lines, using
mains power, 12 V battery, or solar cell energy.
3. Remote Business Sites—The GMPSC system is giving an advantage to every
business based in suburban and R&R areas, providing the developing and
developed world the following services:
(a) Basic GMPSC remote service is suitable for companies requiring voice, fax,
LSD, and SMS facilities via a compact system, which includes a small
interface box and a compact rod antenna. The system will utilize existing TTN
devices easily attached to a company’s tel, fax, or PC and is ideal for remote
38
1
Introduction

post ofﬁces, credit card companies, administrative authorities, small private
companies, and companies requiring telemetry and SCADA.
(b) Advanced remote service is speciﬁed for companies requiring full telecom-
munication services such as voice, fax, HSD, and efﬁcient data transmissions
and SMS facilities, using a GMPSC interface box and an A4-sized antenna.
The interface box can easily be ﬁxed to tel, PABX, fax, or PC, while outdoor
antenna can be mounted onto an appropriate on-site building. This GMPSC
service is ideal for geological, mining, agriculture, manufacturing, construc-
tion, energy and gas exploration companies, local government administration,
and other organizations requiring high volumes of computer data service.
(c) Portable GMPSC remote service has been determined for the early stage of
exploration and survey work, or for journalists using a portable laptop-sized
terminal, which can easily be connected to a telephone handset or PC con-
ﬁguration. This service is ideal for the immediate transmission of data from a
remote site to a headquarters or research location, for transmitting urgent
copies of visual images or photographs, and for any customer requiring
advanced telecommunications with easy installation in remote locations.
4. SCADA (Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition)—The Inmarsat-D+, -
C, GAN, OmniTRACS or Orbcomm and other SCADA (M2M) equipment or
systems may be used in the point-to-multipoint broadcast of Automatic Remote
Monitoring and Messaging Data (ARMMD), whose installations are ﬁtted with
automatic sensors that regularly report back to a control center via satellite.
With its greatly reduced power consumption and by being remotely controlled,
this device is a very effective way of remotely collecting basic environmental
and industrial data via messages of up to 2000 bits, together with one of four
alert signals, which may be sent as a single message. Therefore, the setting up
of these M2M systems and devices are all remote industrial and manufacturing
installations, oil and gas pipeline pumping stations, offshore platforms, mete-
orological observatories, water treatment and energy stations, maritime light-
houses and buoys signaling and other remote systems to run unattended fairly
easy. Keeping this equipment working efﬁciently, gathering management data
and guarding against remote catastrophic failure, all without overspending on
expensive technical labor and travel, is a tougher challenge.
5. Government Services—The GMPSC system network will also provide
possibilities to organizations involved in fast-moving emergencies and inter-
ventions such as disaster relief agencies and SAR organizations, military and
international peace-keeping forces, police squads, medical teams, and civil
authorities. This service offers assured communications by PC data, voice, fax,
SMS, and encrypted messages. For personal use, it will offer dual-mode-
function portable handsets for both satellite and cellular connections. On the
other hand, for group use, the system will offer mobile handset terminals for
ﬁtting to ships, vehicles, aircraft, and temporary accommodation at camps or
bases. Therefore, Inmarsat, Iridium, Globalstar, and other current GMSC
systems have developed both common and special military mobiles and
portable satellite tactical and defense communications equipment.

International Coordination Organizations
and Regulatory Procedures
International coordination in MSC has been carried out by the International
Coordination Organizations, which include ITU, IMO, ICAO, IHO, WMO, and
MSUA.
1.5.1
International Telecommunications Union
(ITU) and Radio Regulations
The ITU organization of the UN with all member governments has carried out the
entire international coordination and regulation of mobile radio and satellite com-
munications by the ITU RR. The ITU was inaugurated in 1932 and reorganized in
1992, with head ofﬁce, all committees, and departments located in Geneva,
Switzerland. Numerous provisions of the telecommunication services applicable or
useful to all stations have been deﬁned and introduced by the general RR articles
and manual on mobile radio service and in a special manual for use by the Maritime
Mobile and Maritime Mobile Satellite Services.
For instance, the ITU also publishes many additional lists of recommendations
concerning RR, systems, radiocommunications, and other technical publications.
The administrative structures established by the ITU Convention comprise a
Secretariat headed by the Secretary General, an Administrative Council, Registration
Board for RF, and Consultative Committees for radio and telecommunications.
The entire terminology, deﬁnition of radio and satellite services, technical stan-
dards, and frequency allocations are deﬁned in the RR and drafted by the World
Administrative Radio Conference (WARC) of the ITU. In effect, the WARC was
reorganized in 1992 as a World Radio Conference (WRC) of the ITU. The basic
concept of the present RR relevant to satellite communications was proposed by the
WARC-ST (WARC satellite) in 1971 and by all other conferences held during later
years. The WARC-92 covers the spectrum needs of numerous telecommunications
services, from HF/VHF broadcasting to personal satellite communications networks.
Thus, the requirements for MSC systems below 1 GHz, above 1 GHz, and in the
20/30 GHz bands have dominated the agenda of the conference. After Spain, the
USA heads off to the WRC-93 in November armed with a clear mandate to seek
more spectrums for MSS. Thus, the USA position for the conference, to be held
from 15 to 19 November in Geneva, is to establish MSS on the agenda for the 1995
and 1997 WRC.
The task of the International Radio Consultative Committee (CCIR) is to form
study groups to consider and report on the operational and technical issues relating
to the use of radio and satellite communications. Hence, the International
Telecommunications Consultative Committee (CCIT) offers the same telecommu-
nication services.
40
1
Introduction

The study groups produce new recommendations on all aspects of radiocom-
munications, which are considered by the Plenary Assembly of the CCIR, and if
accepted become incorporated into the RR and published separately. Besides,
another subgroup of the ITU is the International Frequency Registration Board
(IFRB), which considers operating frequencies, transmitter sites, and the location of
satellites in orbit. Consequently, satellite communication systems have been
internationally authorized by the IFRB and the present ITU-R (ITU-Radio).
The administration of a country that intends to establish satellite communication
systems, operated in GEO, HEO, or LEO conﬁguration, must send to the ITU-R, not
earlier than ﬁve years before the date of introducing the system, information on each
satellite network of the planned service, information such as the frequency bands to
be used, the modulation type of signals, and the radiation characteristics of antennas,
satellite constellations, and Earth stations. The ITU-R publishes the information in a
weekly circular distributed to all relevant administrators around the world. If any
administration is of the opinion that interference will be caused to its existing or
planned space radiocommunication services, it can, within four months after the
publication of the relevant weekly circular, send its comments to the administration
concerned. If no such comments are received from anyone within the period men-
tioned above, it might safely be assumed that no administration has any objections to
the planned satellite network, for the system in question, on which details have been
published. Accordingly, an organization has been set up to receive comments about
registration endeavors to resolve any difﬁculties that may arise and therefore pro-
vides any additional information necessary. Soon after completing all coordinations,
the planned satellite system will be internationally authorized by recording it in the
Master International Frequency Register (MIFR) of frequency assignments.
1.5.2
International Maritime Organization
(IMO) and Regulations
The service and regulations reaching development, studies, and agreements of the
Maritime Safety Committee regarding distress and safety at sea are provided by the
IMO. It consists of an assembly, a council, and 4 main committees: maritime safety;
marine environment protection; and legal and technical cooperation. There is also
the Facilitation Committee and a number of subcommittees, which support the
work of the main technical committees. Since its establishment in 1959, IMO and
all its member governments have striven to enhance the International Convention
for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS—1974). In 1972, IMO, with the assistance of
CCIR, commenced a study of satellite communications systems, which resulted in
the establishment, in 1979, of the Inmarsat Organization. With the continuing
support of CCIR, ITU, WMO, IHO, COSPAS–SARSAT and Inmarsat, IMO has
developed the GMDSS system, which entered very late into force in early 1999,
following almost 30 years of careful preparation.
1.5
International Coordination Organizations and Regulatory Procedures
41

Shipping is perhaps the most international of all the world’s great industries and
one of the most dangerous. It has always been recognized that the best way of
improving safety at sea is by developing international regulations that are followed
by all shipping nations and from the mid-nineteenth century onward, a number of
such treaties were adopted. In 1948, an international conference in Geneva adopted
an Intergovernmental Convention, formally establishing a new international orga-
nization named IMCO (the original name of this organization was changed in 1982
to IMO). The IMO Convention entered into force in 1958, and the new organization
met for the ﬁrst time the following year.
The purposes of the organization are to provide the machinery for cooperation
among governments in the ﬁeld of governmental regulation and practices relating to
technical matters of all kinds affecting shipping engaged in international trade, to
encourage and facilitate the general adoption of the highest practicable standards
and rules in matters concerning maritime safety; efﬁciency of navigation; and
prevention and control of marine pollution from ships.
The ﬁrst IMO task was to adopt a new version of the SOLAS International
Convention, the most important of all treaties dealing with maritime safety. This
was achieved in 1960, and the IMO then turned its attention to such matters. In
1974, the International Convention for the SOLAS adopted the SOLAS 74
Convention based on the requirement that certain classes of ships, when at sea, keep
continuous radio watch on the international distress frequencies assigned in
accordance with the ITU RR and carry corresponding radio equipment capable of
transmitting over a minimum speciﬁed range. Shipping, like all of modern life, has
seen many technological innovations and changes. Some of these have presented
challenges for the organization, and others have presented opportunities. The
enormous strides and efforts made in new radiocommunications technology, for
example, have made it possible for the IMO to introduce major improvements to the
maritime distress and safety system. In this sense, in the 1970s, a global SAR
system was initiated worldwide.
The 1970s also saw the establishment of the Inmarsat at London, which has
greatly improved the provision of commercial and distress radio and other messages
to ships. A further advance was made in 1992, when the GMDSS began to be
phased in. In February 1999, the GMDSS became fully operational, so that now any
ship in distress anywhere in the world can be virtually guaranteed assistance
because even if the crew does not have time, the message will be sent automatically.
Other measures introduced by the IMO have concerned the safety of container
units, bulk cargoes, gas tankers, and other ship types. Special attention has been paid
to crew standards and adoption of a special convention on standards of training,
certiﬁcation, and sea watch keeping. The challenge also facing the IMO and its 162
member states is how to maintain this success at a time when shipping is changing
more rapidly than ever before. The revised technical annex of the SAR Convention
clariﬁes the responsibility of all governments and puts greater emphasis on the
regional or local approach and coordination between maritime and aeronautical SAR
operations. In fact, both parties are also required to ensure the closest practicable
coordination between mutual services. Each RCC and Rescue Sub-Center
42
1
Introduction

(RSC) should have up-to-date information on the SAR facilities and communications
in the area and should have detailed plans for the conduct of SAR operations.
In addition, concurrently with the revision of the SAR Convention, the IMO and
ICAO technical experts jointly developed the International Aeronautical and
Maritime Search and Rescue Manual (IAMSAR), published in three separate vol-
umes covering Organization and Management, Mission Coordination, and Mobile
Facilities. Therefore, the IAMSAR Manual revises and replaces both the IMO
Merchant Ship Search and Rescue Manual (MERSAR), ﬁrst published in 1971, and
the IMO Search and Rescue Manual (IMOSAR), ﬁrst published in 1978.
The MERSAR Manual was the ﬁrst step toward developing the 1979 SAR
Convention and it provided guidance for those who, during emergencies at sea, may
require assistance from others or who may be able to provide assistance themselves.
In particular, it was designed to aid the master of any vessel who might be called
upon to conduct SAR operations at sea for persons in distress.
The second IMOSAR Manual was adopted in 1978. It was designed to help
governments to implement the SAR Convention and provide guidelines rather than
requirements for a common maritime search and rescue policy, encouraging all
coastal states to develop their organizations on similar lines and enabling adjacent
states to cooperate and obtain mutual assistance. It was also updated in 1992, with
the amendments entering into force in 1993. This manual was aligned as closely as
possible with the ICAO Search and Rescue Manual to ensure a common policy and
to facilitate consultation of the two manuals for administrative or operational rea-
sons. In such a way, MERSAR was also aligned, where appropriate, with IMOSAR.
1.5.3
International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO)
and Regulations
The consequence of the studies initiated by the USA and subsequent consultations
between the major allies was that the US government extended an invitation to 55
member states to attend, in November 1944, an International Civil Aviation
Conference in Chicago. In fact, 54 states attended this conference, at the end of
which a Convention on International Civil Aviation was signed by 32 states, setting
up the permanent ICAO policy and task as a means to secure international coop-
eration and the highest possible degree of uniformity in regulations and standards,
procedures, and organization regarding civil aviation matters.
One of the primary objectives of the ICAO with its corresponding expert com-
mittees and departments is to promote the safety and security of civil aviation
worldwide. With 188 contracting states and its active involvement in global aviation
safety issues, the ICAO is well positioned to assume a coordinating role for safety
initiatives for the reduction of aviation accidents. Recognizing this, in 1997, the Air
Navigation Commission proposed an ICAO Global Aviation Safety Plan (GASP) to
the ICAO Council. The GASP serves to focus the safety-related activities within
ICAO on those safety initiatives, either planned or in progress, that offer the best safety
1.5
International Coordination Organizations and Regulatory Procedures
43

dividend in terms of reducing accident numbers and rates worldwide. For that reason
is necessary to develop new GADSS similar to GMDSS.
The main objective of ICAO’s technical aviation security program is to assure
the safety of passengers, aircraft crew, ground personnel, and other members of the
general public by ﬁrst attempting to deny offenders access to aircraft. In accordance
with the Chicago Convention (Annex 17), the ICAO Council adopts Standards and
Recommended Practices (SARP) for safeguarding of international civil aviation
security. The Security Manual for Safeguarding Civil Aviation Against Acts of
Unlawful Interference contains guidance material on the interpretation and imple-
mentation of the SARP of Annex 17. This Manual and Annex 17 are kept under
constant review and amended in light of the new trends and recent technical
developments which have a bearing on the effectiveness of preventive measures
against acts of unlawful interference. In order to assist any state to implement the
aviation security standards contained in Annex 17, the ICAO has developed the
Training Program for Aviation Security, currently comprising seven important
Aviation Security Training Packages (ASTP). Through its global network of ten
Aviation Security Training Centers, ICAO promotes regional cooperation with
regard to AVSEC training, the main objectives being to improve the quality of
training of aviation security personnel worldwide and to assist technically and
ﬁnancially every active member state with their own national AVSEC training
programs. The major objectives of the ICAO GASP are to:
(1) Reduce the number of accidents and fatalities irrespective of the volume of air
trafﬁc, achieving a signiﬁcant decrease in worldwide accident rates, placing
emphasis on regions;
(2) Urge all contracting state members worldwide to provide the needed support
of the ICAO GASP;
(3) Endorse the concept of concentrating the security and safety-related activities
of ICAO on those initiatives, planned or currently under way, that offer the
best safety and safety dividend in terms of reducing the accident rate;
(4) Instruct the council and secretary general to participate in efforts by states to
improve existing safety/security database systems and the exchange of
safety-related information and to participate in activities aimed at the devel-
opment of a comprehensive data analysis and information dissemination
network, taking into account the need to adequately protect privileged infor-
mation and its sources;
(5) Encourage the free communication of security and safety-related information
among users of the aviation system, including the reporting of accident and
incident data by states to the ICAO accident/incident data reporting (ADREP)
system.
(6) Commence a study of MSC systems to enhance air trafﬁc control, to improve
the ﬂow of management data, meteorological, security, and safety information
and to participate in the development of the Global Satellite Augmentation
System for Aeronautical CNS.

Introduction

The ICAO and IMO have jointly collaborated to study, research, and develop an
important IAMSAR Manual. With the revision of the SAR Convention and pre-
vious manuals, they published the IAMSAR Manual, which covers all particulars
about SAR programs and procedures for maritime and aeronautical SAR applica-
tions. This manual was aligned as closely as possible with the previous ICAO
Aeronautical Search and Rescue Manual.
1.5.4
International Hydrographic Organization (IHO)
The IHO is an international intergovernmental consultative and technical organi-
zation that was established in 1921 to support safety in navigation and the pro-
tection of the marine environment. The main IHO activity is standardization of
nautical charts and documents, bathymetry and ocean mapping and related publi-
cations, and technical assistance and training. The special activity of IHO related to
MSS is radio navigational warnings implemented by the GMDSS as an integrated
radio and satellite communication system of Inmarsat and COSPAS–SARSAT
systems. The GMDSS system has improved the dissemination of maritime safety
information (MSI), taking advantage of modern communications technology.
The far offshore navigation warnings are broadcasted via Inmarsat-C Enhanced
Group Call (EGC) SafetyNET Service, while polar area warnings are covered by
DCS HF radio services and coastal area warnings are transmitted via DCS MF/VHF
radio and NAVTEX on a single-frequency, time-shared, and automatic broadcast.
The NAVTEX and Digital Selective Call (DSC) VHF and HF radio services are
already in operation in most parts of the world in the framework of the GMDSS
mission.
The advent of digital data transmission, computers, and video display systems is
having a considerable impact on hydrographic and navigation technology. This has
made possible the development of ECDIS (Electronic Chart Display and Information
Systems), which has become a major focus of activity. Several working groups have
been established by the IHO to coordinate these new developments and ensure the
standardization of systems and speciﬁcations. In 1992, the IHO adopted standards
for the formatting of ECDIS data so that it can be readily exchanged between
hydrographic ofﬁces. At this point, the Committee on ECDIS (COE) examines both
the database requirements and the standardization and overall parameters of such
systems.
1.5.5
World Meteorological Organization (WMO)
The WMO coordinates all global scientiﬁc activity to allow prompt and accurate
weather information, WX, and tropical storm forecasting and other services for
public, private, and commercial use, including the international shipping and airline
1.5
International Coordination Organizations and Regulatory Procedures
45

industries, sent by GMSC media. More exactly, the major part of WMO’s activities
contributes to the safety of life and property, the socioeconomic development of
nations, and the protection of the entire Earth environment, including the Global
Ozone Observing System.
The World Meteorological Convention, by which body the WMO was created
and adopted at the 12th Conference of Directors of the International Meteorological
Organization, met in the US capital Washington in 1947. Although the Convention
itself came into force in 1950, the WMO commenced operations as its successor in
1951 and, later that year, was established as an UN’s specialized agency by
agreement between the UN and the WMO.
The purposes of the WMO are to facilitate international cooperation in the
establishment of networks of stations for making meteorological, hydrological, and
other observations and to promote the rapid exchange of meteorological informa-
tion by means of meteorological radio or satellite communications, the standard-
ization of meteorological observations, and the uniform publication of observations
and statistics. The WMO also furthers the speciﬁc application of meteorology to
maritime, aviation, agriculture and other human activities, climatology, atmospheric
sciences, hydrology, and instruments with important methods of observation. Each
of them meets every four years, in an effort to promote operational hydrology and to
encourage research and training in meteorology.
The main WMO task is to organize, control, collect, and offer up-to-the-minute
worldwide meteorological observations and weather information through many
member-operated observation systems and telecommunication links with four PEO
and ﬁve GEO satellites, about 10,000 land observation stations, 7000 ship stations,
and 300 moored and drifting buoys carrying automatic weather stations. Namely,
each day, high-speed links transmit over 15 million data characters and 2000
weather charts through 3 world, 35 regional, and 183 national meteorological
centers cooperating with each other in preparing weather analyses and forecasts in
an elaborately engineered fashion. Thus, transoceanic ships and airplanes, research
scientists on sea/air pollution or global climate change, the media, and the general
public are given a constant supply of timely data, which are very important for safe
navigation and ﬂight. Moreover, it is through the WMO that the complex agree-
ments on standards, codes, measurements, and communications are internationally
established.
Data from all over the world are needed to provide weather (WX) forecasts and
warnings. In other words, an aircraft does not take off, nor does a ship leave a port,
without a WX received via agent or by means of radio and/or satellite communi-
cation systems for safety utilization. Combining facilities and services provided by
all members, the program’s primary purpose of the system is to make available
meteorological and related geophysical and environmental information enabling
countries to maintain efﬁcient meteorological services. Facilities in regions outside
any national territory (outer space, wide ocean areas, and Antarctica) are maintained
by members on a voluntary basis. The World Weather Watch System comprises the

Introduction

The Hydrology and Water Resources Program promotes worldwide cooperation
in the evaluation of water resources and the development of hydrological networks
and services, including data collection and processing, hydrological forecasting,
and weather warnings.
1.5.6
Mobile Satellite Users Association (MSUA)
The MSUA was established in 1992 as a non-proﬁt association to promote the
interests of users of MSS worldwide. It fosters effective communication among
MSS users, suppliers of equipment and services, operators of the satellite systems,
and the various governmental entities that may affect the future of the entire
industry. Membership is not limited to American entities; it is open to organizations
worldwide engaged in any of these activities. The MSUA has created a Web site
that is the premier source of MSS information. Namely, the association maintains a
Web site on the World Wide Web—(www.msua.org). The Web site will publicize
MSUA activities and provide, to members only, information and analyses that
enhance their business opportunities. It is possible to ﬁnd a description of the
association, a great list of links (service providers, manufacturers, consultants, etc.),
as well as links to all the major operational systems such as Inmarsat, Iridium,
Globalstar, Leo One, Orbcomm, and many others. Three classes of membership are
open to applicants: corporate, associate, and personal. In pursuing its mission, the
MSUA media informs its membership on issues that affect them and conveys all
members’ views on such issues to appropriate authorities, and speciﬁcally, the
association reviews, reports, and analyzes the activities of all members and MSS
providers and reports on those executive and legislative activities of governments
that affect MSS and navigation services, etc.

Satellite Communications Organizations
and Operators
Government and intergovernmental satellite communications organizations and
operators are divided into international, offering almost global service, and regional,
usually covering few countries or entire continents and domestic, for local service
only.
The GMSC system operators are the only entity responsible for the operation of
the GMSC space and ground network conﬁgurations providing global, regional, or
domestic coverage. However, the GMSC service providers are any entity com-
missioned by a GMSC system operator to provide GMSC services to the public
within a region or country which may require an authorization to do so under the
applicable legislation of the country concerned.

International Coordination Organizations and Regulatory Procedures

1.6.1
International Satellite Communications Organizations
International satellite communications organizations and operators are Intelsat,
Inmarsat, Intersputnik, Eutelsat, ESA, and other global, multinational, or inter-
governmental operators serving outside domestic and regional boundaries.
1.6.1.1
Intelsat
The FSS were the ﬁrst to develop, and there was rapid recognition that these new
global possibilities necessitated the creation of some kind of international organi-
zation. Thus, this led to the creation of the Intelsat international organization based
in Washington. On August 20, 1964, 11 countries signed a charter agreement
creating the Intelsat, the ﬁrst open worldwide satellite communications network,
and appointed the Comsat Corporation as its ﬁrst manager. However, Comsat
placed a contract for a GEO and the Intelsat ﬁxed system started to offer transat-
lantic satellite services in 1965 after the successful deployment of Intelsat I (for-
merly Early Bird), the world’s ﬁrst GEO spacecraft.
Today, more than a ﬁfth generation of Intelsat birds provides international and
domestic satellite communication service on behalf of over 112 member nations.
Since 1973, Intelsat has operated with an organizational structure that has only four
tiers: the Assembly of Parties, the Meeting of Signatories, the Board of Governors,
and the Executive Organ.
During the 1990s, users were served by the following satellite constellations:
Intelsat K and the Intelsat V to VIII series of spacecraft. The ﬁrst Intelsat VIII was
launched in 1996 on board an Ariane 4 booster. Moreover, the ﬁrst satellite in the
Intelsat IX series, Intelsat 901, was scheduled to be launched in 2000 to the 60oE
GEO location. The next series of Intelsat GEO spacecraft 902, 903, and 904 were
scheduled in the period between 2000 and 2002.
The Intelsat provided as well as MSS using payloads carried by its GEO
spacecraft Intelsat V MCS series: A (F5), B (G6), C (F7) and D (F8). The Inmarsat
organization leased capacity on Intelsat V MCS ﬂights F5 through F8 for MMSS,
shown in Fig. 1.13. These four satellites used portions of the L-band (from 0.5 to
1.7 GHz) and C-band assigned for such purposes by the ITU. The Intelsat V MCS
A (F5) was launched on September 28, 1982, over IOR in orbital location at 63oE;
the Intelsat V MCS B (F6) was launched on May 19, 1983, over AOR in orbital
location at 18.5˚W. The Intelsat V MCS C (F7) was launched on October 19, 1983,
as a spare spacecraft over IOR in orbital location at 66˚E, and the Intelsat MCS V D
(F8) spacecraft was launched on March 3, 1984, over POR in orbital location at
53˚E longitude and at the end of 1985 was relocated to the assignment of 179/180˚.
Thus, MCS uses radio frequencies in the top C-band transponder and an additional
L-band spectrum to link CES with ships as part of the Inmarsat network. Because of
the additional power requirements by the MCS packages on Intelsat V F5–F8
satellites, the Ku-band operations on these four spacecraft must be limited or
48
1
Introduction

curtailed when they are activated for Inmarsat use. However, when the L-band
signal ampliﬁer is operating in the high-power mode, the 11 GHz Ku-band capacity
of these spacecraft is switched off. These satellites after many years of service are
deployed and not used by the Inmarsat system any more.
1.6.1.2
Inmarsat
The Inmarsat organization is the only international and nonmilitary MSC provider
in the world. The Inmarsat MSC network provides tel; Tlx; fax; slow-, medium-,
and high-speed data transfer; image and video; videoconferencing; videophone;
new mobile MPDS and ISDN; LAN and IP service; and in the framework of the
GMDSS system, enables distress and safety service for maritime, land and aero-
nautical MES, including government, rural, military and offshore infrastructures.
In the early 1970s, the IMO, then known as the IMCO, began to consider the
possibility of using MSS to improve maritime communications, not least for safety
purposes. Toward the end of 1973, IMCO convened a conference to decide on the
principle of establishing an international maritime safety system and to conclude the
necessary agreements. The work of this conference culminated in September 1976
in the adoption of what became the Inmarsat Convention and its complementary
operating agreement, requiring always acts exclusively for peaceful purposes.
Inmarsat was established on July 16, 1979, by the major maritime nations to ﬁnance
this project, which is to investigate using satellites to form links with vessels and

offshore oil rigs at sea. Inmarsat also owes much of its success to the foresight and
commitment of the IMO, which played a crucial role in its creation.
On February 1, 1982, Inmarsat ofﬁcially took control of satellites previously
operated by three Marisat spacecraft (series F1, F2, and F3), a joint venture among
nations begun in the early 1970s through the efforts of the Comsat General.
Inmarsat has since expanded its space segment by leasing additional capacity from
Intelsat and ESA, Intelsat V MCS series of four spacecraft, and two Marecs
spacecraft (B and B2A), respectively. However, today an additional Inmarsat
second, third, and forthcoming fourth generation of GEO, Inmarsat-2, Inmarsat-3,
and Inmarsat-4 spacecraft, respectively, are being exploited.
In many ways, the Inmarsat organization is patterned after the Intelsat system
and almost all countries comprise the Inmarsat Assembly as members, each country
casting one vote. The assembly meets once every two years to formulate general
policy, long-term strategy, and objectives. Besides, each government selects a
representative signatory to the Inmarsat Operating Agreement from the public or
private sector. The assembly has also primarily to establish ﬁnancial, technical, and
operational standards. The Inmarsat Council, similar to a corporate board of
directors, meets three times a year to implement all policy decisions of the
assembly. The Director General of Inmarsat oversees the day-to-day management
of the organization, with an executive staff headquartered in London.
Inmarsat is ﬁnanced in two ways: Signatories must pay fees based on their use of
the network, or can purchase investment shares in Inmarsat that reduce the user fees
in proportion to the investment, and signatories earn a return of 14 % per annum on
their investment in Inmarsat. During 1987, the largest numbers of investment shares
were held by the USA, UK, Norway, and Japan.
1.6.1.3
Intersputnik
The Russian Federation, that is to say, the former the Soviet Union, is not a member
of Intelsat. Instead, in 1971, it created a similar multinational organization named
Intersputnik, which provides FSS for its 14 member states and a number of other
associated countries. This system uses the various families of former Soviet com-
munications satellites, such as Molniya, Raduga, and Gorizont, using GEO, HEO,
and PEO satellite coverage.
The Russian satellite system conceivable can beam radio broadcasting, TV
programs, voice, and data trafﬁc to almost any location on Earth, and only Intelsat
can supply more global FSS links than Intersputnik. This organization is an open
international intergovernmental that any sovereign state can join. The fundamental
structure of Intersputnik was determined by the Cooperative Agreement on the
Establishment of the Organization. A representative for each member nation serves
on the Board of Members, which is the main governing body of Intersputnik
organization. Besides, this board selects a director general to chair the Intersputnik
Directorate based in Moscow.

Introduction

The organization also provides three MSS for all three applications, using
payloads carried by its GEO spacecraft Gorizont (Horizon), Raduga (Rainbow), and
Morya (Seamen):
1 The Volna (Wave) Network—The Volna MSC system served to connect
maritime and aeronautical MES terminals via space segment constellation to
LES and ground-based telecommunication facilities for former USSR ships and
aircraft. This MSS consists of communications payloads carried by the space-
craft Gorizont and Raduga. The Volna Network provided radio and TV service
for mobile stations on UHF frequency bands between 335 and 399 and 240 and
328 MHz.
On
the
other
hand,
the
Volna
Network
provided
service
uplink/downlink on L-band between 1636 and 1644 and 1535 and 1542 MHz
for MMSS and also on L-band 1645–1660/1543/158 MHz for AMSS applica-
tions, while feeder link used 6/3 GHz uplink/downlink bands for both MSS
applications.
2 The Morya Network—In 1989, the former Soviet Union expanded its MMSS
with the Morya MSC Network, using existing Soviet satellites series Morya for
carrying the MSC payload. Namely, the Morya Network provided MMSS on
two
2.5 MHz
wide
frequency
uplink/downlink
bands
centered
on
1637.25/1535.75 MHz (service link) and 6084.0/3758.3 MHz (feeder link).
3 The Gals Network—Piggybacked on the former Soviet Union’s Raduga
spacecraft, named Gals (Tack), a special telecommunications payload serves as
satellite links for the former USSR (today Russia) military forces. Thus, this
network will operate using the X-band spectrum for uplinking (7.9–8.4 GHz)
and downlinking (7.25–7.75 GHz), for defense maritime, land, and aeronautical
applications.
1.6.1.4
ESA
The idea of creating an independent space organization in Europe goes back to the
early 1960s when six European countries, Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, the
Netherlands, and the UK, are associated with Australia, to develop and build a
heavy launcher called Europa. In 1975, a convention was endorsed at the political
intergovernmental level to set up the European Space Agency (ESA). Finally, the
convention entered into force on October 31, 1980. Since then, the founding ESA
members have been joined by 4 new members from Europe, while some other
European countries have expressed their interest to join ESA. In addition, the
cooperation agreements have also been signed to allow Canada to participate in
certain ESA programs and to sit on the ESA Council.
This makes the dreams of Europe’s space scientists come true, by creating and
operating new scientiﬁc spacecraft for the ESA. The project management interacts
with the aerospace and instrument industry in the 15 member states and oversees
the construction, launch, and operation of the spacecraft. There is in close liaison
with ESA’s European Space Operations Center (ESOC) in Darmstadt, Germany,
1.6
Satellite Communications Organizations and Operators
51

with Arianespace and other cooperative agencies providing launchers and with the
GES needed for communication with the spacecraft.
The ESA Research and Scientiﬁc Support Department was restructured in
2000/2001 into divisions. In such a way, each division is the home of the project
scientists for the study, project development, and operation of the missions and
serves the space scientists of Europe, under the supervision of the Science Program
Committee, on which all member states are represented. Any scientist or group
within the member states can propose a space science mission. Before a ﬁnal
selection, some rival proposals are selected for detailed study of their scientiﬁc,
technological, and budgetary implications. Under a science communications ini-
tiative, ESA is intensifying its efforts to keep the press, public, and schoolteachers
well informed about the science program and the progress of its various missions.
Apart from construction, launch, and operation of the spacecraft, ESA has
developed Artemis MSS, derived from former Prodat MSS for all three applica-
tions. At present, ESA members are developing GSNS named Galileo and satellite
augmentation systems EGNOS for maritime, land, and aeronautical satellite CNS.
1.6.1.5
Eutelsat
The European Telecommunications Satellite (Eutelsat) Organization was provi-
sionally founded in 1977 by representatives of 17 members of the European
Conference of PTT and telecommunication administrations, with headquarters
based in Paris. Its major mandate was to establish and run the European satellite
communications system as a regional operator, but because it is currently offering
global FSS service on an international basis, it can be classiﬁed into the group of
global and international satellite organizations.
The constitution and ﬁnancing of Eutelsat are modeled on those of Intelsat.
Although it did not formally come into existence until 1984, Eutelsat started work
in 1977 with ESA on the exploitation of the Orbital Test Satellite (OTS)
experimental communication birds and on the design of the operational European
Communications Satellite (ECS) series. Finally, the latter were in due course taken
over and operated by Eutelsat, which is now procuring its second generation of
satellites.
At this point, Eutelsat passed from an interim organizational structure to
deﬁnitive operational status on September 1, 1985, and all shares were divided at
that time among about 25 member nations. During the early stages of planning,
Eutelsat designers thought their spacecraft primarily would carry voice and
high-speed data service. Although Eutelsat was set up to handle long-distance
trafﬁc, a signiﬁcant part of its revenue now comes from the relaying of satellite TV
programs for distribution through the terrestrial telecommunications network or into
the cable system. Throughout its 25 years of experience, Eutelsat has placed
innovation at the center of its development. The company has distinguished itself,
notably by being the ﬁrst in Europe to distribute satellite TV and pioneering the use
52
1
Introduction

of the Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB) standard for the transmission of digital
TV channels and data.
Eutelsat is one of the world’s leading operators of multipurpose satellite
infrastructures. It provides capacity on 23 satellites that offer a broad portfolio of
services, which include direct TV and radio broadcasting for the consumer public,
professional video broadcasts, corporate networks, Internet services, and MSC
systems. Therefore, Eutelsat is providing regional MSS for all three applications
with the current Emsat MSC system for maritime and land applications and the
EutelTRACS system for mobile tracking and messaging. The latter system is
developed by technical cooperation with Qualcomm, a US-based company, to
establish communication network and equipment infrastructures.
1.6.2
Former International MSS Operators
Former international and regional MSS organizations and operators were Marisat,
developed by the US-based Comsat Company Marecs, which was formed by
European nations, and Prodat was a project of ESA.
1.6.2.1
Marisat MSS
The world’s ﬁrst maritime MSC system as a new application of the GEO system
was unveiled in 1976 with only three satellites and ocean networks that are pro-
viding MMSC services in the Atlantic, Paciﬁc, and Indian Oceans. The Hughes
Aircraft Company, known today as Boeing Satellite Systems Inc, under contract to
Comsat General Corp, built three multifrequency communications spacecraft called
Marisat (Maritime Satellite), for the space segment of the world’s ﬁrst MMSC
operator. The Comsat General was developed a Marisat system for MSS at ﬁrst for
only maritime applications. In 1971, frequency bands around 1.6 GHz were allo-
cated for satellite communications connections with ships and aircraft. The Marisat
satellites were designed initially for US Navy vessels and they had a UHF
transponder on board in a band from 240 to 400 MHz. Because there was sufﬁcient
margin for additional payload, L- and C-band transponders were installed on the
Marisat satellite to provide commercial MSC trafﬁc for maritime applications.
These satellites had a dual role at that time to provide space segment facilities
that were leased to the US Navy for military communications with naval ships, and
it also enabled the use of transponders for Comsat General itself to operate MSS for
trafﬁc with merchant ships, virtually worldwide. All three Marisat satellites were
launched with the same type of USA rocket “McDonnell Douglas 2914 Delta”
during 1976, on 19 February, 9 June, and 14 October, for the needs of the company
Comsat General. Marisat F1, F2, and F3 satellites were placed in GEO planes at 15°
W, 72.5°E, and 176.5°E longitude, respectively.
1.6

53

All satellites have been leased from Comsat, in effect; Marisat F1 spacecraft
served as an in-orbit spare for the Marecs A spacecraft in the Marisat AOR region at
a position 15°W. Then, this satellite was leased as a spare in Inmarsat AORE region
and removed to 106°W.
Marisat F2 spacecraft served as a spare in IOR region at a position 73˚E and
lately for the Inmarsat space segment. The Marisat F3 spacecraft served at a
position 176.5˚E in the POR region and afterward reprogrammed as a spare for the
Marecs B2 satellite. This satellite was ﬁnally relocated as in-orbit spare to 182.5˚E.
The service at that time was welcomed by merchant shipping, and by 1982, around
one thousand vessels were equipped to use the Marisat system. All three Marisat
satellites also served as an emergency backup, one in each of the three ocean
regions: AOR, IOR, and POR. Accordingly, after many years, these satellites are no
longer in exploitation either by the Comsat or by the Inmarsat systems.
The Navy ﬂeet used P-band frequencies (Tx = 248–260 MHz/Rx = 1300–
312 MHz) for the MMSS link, while the merchant-shipping element of the Marisat
payload used the newly allocated L-band frequencies (Tx = 1537–1541 MHz/Rx =
1638.5–1642.5 MHz)
for
its
MMSS
links
and
C-band
(Tx = 6174.5–
6424 MHz/Rx = 3945.5–4199 MHz) for feeder links. Fixed CES for mobile ser-
vice were located at Santa Paola for POR, at Southbury for AOR, and at Fucino and
Yamaguchi for IOR (see Fig. 1.14). The system provided access to the satellites,
linking ships at sea through the PSTN with the TTN subscribers ashore for tel, Tlx,
fax, data, and HSD transmissions. The Marisat system was controlled by network
control center (NCC) located at Washington. Satellite Tracking, Telemetry and
Command (TT&C) are also conducted over C-band frequencies.
However, the governments of many other countries were not quite content for
control of MSC with their ships to rest with a foreign commercial corporation. Owing
to this problem, in 1976, under the aegis of IMCO, an agreement was drawn up for the
establishment of an Inmarsat organization, initially for maritime service only.

Introduction

1.6.2.2
Marecs MSS
The ESA organization’s Maritime European Communications Satellite (ECS) or
Marecs project covered the study, development, launch, and in-orbit operations of
communication spacecraft to be integrated in a global MMSC. Development began
in 1973 with funding from Belgium, France, Italy, UK, Spain, and Germany and
then later joined by the Netherlands, Norway, and Sweden. In effect, the program
started at ﬁrst as the experimental Maritime Orbital Test Satellite (Marots) but was
subsequently changed to an operational system resulting in a name change, satellite
redesign, and delayed development.
The Marecs satellite was part of the GMSC system conﬁgured to provide high–
quality, full-duplex, reliable, real-time voice, fax, Tlx, and data services between
SES and CES with automatic connection to the TTN. The Marecs satellites operated
by ESA were members of Inmarsat ﬁrst-generation MMSC network. The Marecs-1
B2A spacecraft was successfully launched via an Ariane rocket from Kourou,
French Guiana, on November 9, 1984, at AOR region location 26˚W. It was later
relocated to the assignment of AORW at 55.5°W as an operational satellite of the
Inmarsat network. The next Marecs A satellite was successfully launched via an
Ariane rocket from Kourou, French Guiana, on December 20, 1981, on a POR
assignment at a position of 177.5°E and was later relocated to POR at 178.5°E, as a
spare satellite leased by Inmarsat. The Marecs satellite consists of two modules: a
service module, which is a derivative of the ECS bus and a payload module. The
spacecraft has a design life of 7 years, a 3-axis altitude control, and TT&C that uses
VHF spectrum during transfer orbit and C-band through the communications
subsystems on station. The payload is capable of operating without continuous
ground control, and it consists of a C- to L-band forward transponder and an L- to
C-band return transponder, incorporating SAR channels.
The Marecs spacecraft was based on the British Aerospace ECS 3-axis stabilized
platform, with two sun-tracking solar arrays providing 955 W (BOL) with 2 NiCd
batteries for eclipse power supply. Payload had three repeaters: shore to ship with
5 MHz bandwidth, ship to shore with 6 MHz bandwidth, and shore to shore with
0.5 MHz bandwidth. These provide 35 two-way voice channels plus search and
rescue capabilities. Hence, one 2-m-diameter L-band antenna and 2 horns (one
transmit, one receive) for 4/6 GHz channels provide almost 1/3 of the Earth coverage.
1.6.2.3
Prodat MSS
The ESA organization promoted a special Prosat program, which included propa-
gation measurements of the aeronautical channels. The second phase of the
Prosat MSS project primarily consisted of the design, development, and prolonged
demonstration of a two-way low-rate data system. The latter service is referred to as
Promar, while the low-cost digital data-only MSC service included in the conﬁg-
uration is known as Prodat, to be available for maritime, land, and aeronautical
1.6
Satellite Communications Organizations and Operators
55

mobile operations, on 1.6 GHz band to the satellite, which in turn relays the signals
to ground using a 6 GHz carrier.
The Prodat program conducted successful ﬁeld trials with low data terminals
using the Marecs satellite. In parallel, two L-band MSC payloads are being procured
by ESA to promote European MSS: the European Mobile System (EMS) payload on
the Italsat 1-F2 satellite and the L-band land mobile (LLM) payload on the Artemis
satellite. The EMS allows voice and data communications with a capacity of 300
channels. The available capacities are partially being used to demonstrate and
evaluate the emerging MSC system. The European MSS operational phase started
with the EMS payload in orbit during 1996 and is continuing with the LLM payload,
which was planned to be launched in 1997.
The Prodat MSS was operated through ESA ground stations and Inmarsat
communications satellites and provided a low-speed, low-power, and narrow-
bandwidth service between the terrestrial public data network (PDN) and a popu-
lation of maritime, land, and aeronautical mobile terminals.
1.7
Frequency Designations and Classiﬁcation of Services
The assignment of a radio frequency, band, or channels is performed by an
authorized administration for radiocommunications via platform, satellite, or space
stations to use a radio frequency (RF) spectrum or frequency channels under
speciﬁed conditions. In this sense, the allotment of a RF or frequency channel
comprises the entry of a designed frequency channel in an agreed plan, adopted by
a competent conference for use by one or more administrations for a terrestrial or
space radiocommunications service in one or more identiﬁed countries or geo-
graphic areas and under speciﬁed conditions.
The allocation of a RF band makes possible its entry in the table of frequency
allocations of a given RF band for the purpose of its use by one or more terrestrial
or space radiocommunications service or the radio astronomy service under des-
ignated and speciﬁed conditions.
At this point, in satellite communication ﬁelds, the frequency bands are often
denoted with alphabetical symbols such as L- to Ka-bands. Frequency band
numbers and names are deﬁned by the ITU RR, ITU Tables of Frequency
Allocations in general or for a particular band and the mentioned alphabetic sym-
bols by the IEEE Standard Radar Deﬁnitions.
The radio spectrum shall be subdivided into nine RF bands and designated by
progressive whole numbers, in accordance with Table 1.2. At any rate, in satellite
communication ﬁelds, the radio frequency bands are often denoted with alphabet-
ical symbols such as L- to Ka-bands.
In a more general sense, frequency designations for MSS are used by a number
of different administrations for their national or international MSS networks and can
be systematized into two main categories:
56
1
Introduction

1. Frequency Allocations for Service Links—The frequency allocation for ser-
vice links in current commercial use is in L-band at 1.5 GHz (downlinks) and at
1.6 GHz (uplinks). In addition to the L-band designations, there are other MSS
frequency band allocations for service links between MES and spacecraft,
shown in Table 1.3. New frequency bands below 3 GHz were allocated for
MSS at WARC-92 and WRC-95. The new allocations below band of 1 GHz are
very narrowly designated for only LEO conﬁgurations, while GEO satellites are
excluded from most of the terms. Very soon, it will be clear which of the new
bands above 1 GHz should be used for MSS via GEO satellites and the rest will
be available for Big LEO systems and satellites in other non-GEO constella-
tions. Moreover, there are also LMSS frequency allocations for land vehicles at
14.0–14.5 GHz.
2. Frequency Allocations for Feeder Links—The feeder links between LES and
satellites are illustrated for most MSS in Table 1.4. In such a manner, all radio
frequency allocations can be designated for global and regional satellite cover-
age. The subcategories of frequency allocation are divided into three regions and
among three mobile applications. All frequencies used between satellite and
MES are part of MSS and can be classiﬁed into three main allocations: MMSS for
ships, LMSS for land vehicles, and AMSS for aircraft. Some allocations differ-
entiate among the MMSS, the LMSS, and the AMSS scheme and are somewhat

complex in detail. Thus, the regional frequency allocations for corresponding
countries are systemized into regions 1, 2, and 3, respectively. In addition, there
are also allocations for other services within these frequency bands in some
countries, but most of these shared allocations are of secondary status.
Finally, new Ka-band allocations are being studied by NASA for commercial
MSS and may present a feasible opportunity. The ITU has deﬁned many com-
munication services within its RR that can be carried out by satellite systems and
has developed many rules for worldwide RR of the services in order to maximize
the peaceful use of outer space. In this instance, depending on the speciﬁc purpose
and services, satellite communications can be classiﬁed into several services, as
explained later. In effect, many of these services have been provided under the
auspices of special satellite operational organizations set up to develop, operate, and
market the service.
As already mentioned, classiﬁcation of an MSC service can be achieved by
considering the role played by the geographic extent of network coverage on
international, regional, and local bases. All these organizations set up to handle

Introduction

these classes of satellite systems having a similar structure, only speciﬁc service
spans national boundaries. Otherwise, the main classiﬁcation of the satellite service
in connection with types of users has been realized on ﬁxed and mobile units.
1.7.1
Fixed Satellite Service (FSS)
The FSC system enables a radiocommunications link between two or more FES or
GES terminals at given positions, when one or more satellites are used, illustrated in
Fig. 1.15. In this sense, the given position may be a speciﬁed position or any ﬁxed
point within a particular area. In some cases, this particular service includes
satellite-to-satellite links, which may also be operated in certain intersatellite ser-
vices. Moreover, the FSS solutions may also include feeder links for other space
communication services, including MSS, or MSS GES can provide service for FES
as well.

The FSS signals are relayed between many FES, which are relatively large,
complex, and expensive systems. The FES terminals are connected to the con-
ventional TTN, and the service is intended for long-distance voice, video, and data
communications. According to the WARC-85/88 principle plan, the FSS shares
frequency bands with terrestrial networks in the 4/6, 12/14 and 20/30 GHz, which
guarantees every country has equal access to the GEO space constellations.
A typical example of FSS is the Intelsat, one of the pioneers in satellite com-
munications. The ﬁrst generation of Intelsat system operated in the C-band
(4/6 GHz). At present, many global systems, such as Intersputnik, Telesat, Eutelsat,
PanAmSat, and others, and regional systems, such as Optus in Australia and JCSAT
in Japan, operate in the Ku-band (30/14 GHz), which provide coverage throughout
most of Europe and Japan, respectively. This service may include satellite voice,
fax, voice, data and video (VDV), low/medium- and high-speed data, Tlx, and
video only via VSAT of DVB-RCS networks.
1.7.1.1
Satellite Voice Network
Voice service is inherently interactive communication in nature providing global
telephone infrastructures, which represents two-way wire or wireless communica-
tions on distance. Voice channels are useful for relatively low-rate data applications
such as fax, e-mail, and low-speed Internet access on less than 64 Kb/s. The digital
standard for PSTN access at the subscriber level is ISDN, which provides 144 Kb/s
of active data subdivided into two 64 Kb/s circuit-switched bearer channels plus

Introduction

one data channel (2B+D). The FSS voice network uses GEO satellites and a
bandwidth per channel from 8 to 64 Kb/s with FDMA and TDMA transmissions.
The system enables the international telephone trunks to extend the global coverage
and thin route and to improve rural services in developing regions.
1.7.1.2
VSAT Network
The
VSAT
(very
small
aperture
terminals)
devices are
quite
similar
to
Inmarsat MES. This equipment is Small Earth Stations capable of receiving only
from and transmitting and receiving (transceivers) to or from spacecraft. Therefore,
VSAT devices are classiﬁed as a communications media with either one-way or
two-way facilities. In the broadest sense, the term one-way VSAT includes the data
terminals designed for the reception only of DSB transmission and conventional
TVRO, using PAL and similar TV system. This device can also receive data using
modulated subcarriers. Two-way VSAT can transmit and receive signals at rates at
approximately 64 Kb/s. The low directivity of VSAT antennas limits the power and
hence the boresight EIRP, which may be transmitted. The transceivers are usually
completely solid state and can be highly integrated.
This equipment represents an important addition to the telecommunications
world, because they can provide a service directly to their customers at virtually any
geographic location covered by suitable satellite beam. They do not require any
support from a local TTN and can even be run from portable or alternative power
supply. This system is useful for private data network within countries and regions
to promote business needs. Examples of such networks are Equatorial, Intelnet,
Intelsat, and other systems. The VSAT system main applications are serving for
data and document distributions, rural communities, and business utilizations and
for disaster area communications. Data distribution can be in two-way between
central HUB stations for archive and data processing and all VSAT users. Thus,
documents distribution by VSAT can be only one-way satellite transmission from
Hub library stations to all users. The users can be in touch with HUB via TTN.
Rural application of VSAT devices is very important for improving capability to
transmit and receive much information from rural areas to central locations and vice
versa. Rural communities would also like to provide speech service via VSAT
systems, because of very limited telephone line facilities, if they are available at all.
Voice VSAT system operating at 4.8 Kb/s is already in use. High-quality speech
can be carried on satellite channels with a data rate of 9.6 Kb/s using modern voice
encodes and modems capable of operating at low C/N values, something like
Inmarsat aeronautical voice system. A voice circuits set up between two VSAT
devices include a double hop and accordingly a delay of about 0.5 s. A HUB
located in a city can provide both voice and data services to many villages.
Thus, disaster areas and in generally for emergency situation needs deployment
of VSAT devices for alert and security communications, usually regarding the
terrain, locations and safety of life. The reason is similar that many ships, vehicles,
and aircraft now carry satellite distress beacons.

Business VSAT applications are of an essential interest because of their large
potential to provide persons and companies with the competitive edge. In general,
business wants to establish private networks to link their all locations and move
their information in a safe manner and for the lowest possible cost. The service can
be numerous like airlines and bus reservations, car rental conference facilities,
insurance, and newsgathering. Although the term VSAT equipment is generally
used in connection with very small and ﬁxed location terminals for business use,
there are comparable developments in related ﬁelds that should be considered. For
example, TVRO of very low cost, which can receive MAC signals from high-power
satellites, could offer VSAT type service in higher data rates and less cost.
The VSAT technology brings all of the features and beneﬁts of unit or bidi-
rectional FSS down to an extremely economical and usable for business data
transmission. The system can provide also very efﬁcient bypass with TTN for voice,
data, and video services using sophisticated digital technology and advanced
communication network protocols.
The VSAT system enables the use of one or more 56 Kb/s data channels, each of
which can be subdivided or applied directly. Voice communication is also possible
using 16 or 32 Kb/s, depending on the compression algorithm. The VSAT network
uses GEO conﬁguration, a channel bandwidth from 64 to 512 Kb/s with FDMA
and TDMA transmissions.
In Fig. 1.16 (Left) is shown GT&T Faraway SES100 VSAT cost-effective,
state-of-the-art satellite solution for companies having high communication ﬂow to
their clients, agents, or branch ofﬁces located abroad or for remote and rural areas
where communication services are unavailable, unreliable, or too expensive. This
equipment is using V-sat communication network with African C-band and
European, African, and Middle East Ku-band coverage. The system is providing
on-demand high-quality voice up to 8 telephone lines, group III fax, data transfer
compatible via external Hayes-compatible modem with rate from 4.8 up to 64 or
128 Kb/s, IP/X25/X400, Internet (e-mail and Web sites), videoconference, and
broadcasting (TV and Radio) services. The main unit with high-capacity chassis
allows several telephones (up to 8 interfaces), fax, and PCs to be connected
simultaneously via parabolic antenna. The antenna is available with a diameter of
65-, 98-, 120-, 180-, and 240-cm dishes depending on position in coverage area and
distance from subsatellite point. This conﬁguration employs a full-mesh, DAMA,
and PAMA network architecture that maximizes the use of available space and
ground-based resources.
Mobile satellite users can also be included in this category of satellite com-
munications. Most probably in the near future, VSAT system will offer full MSS
similar to Inmarsat-C or Mini-M systems. With an additional mobile antenna,
VSAT can offer MSS for maritime, land, and aeronautical applications.
Another very last VSAT model is GT&T IPsky2 of V-Sat two-way transceiver
system together with Internet modem, and router launched in January 2002 can be
easily adapted in mobile unit with slight transformation of antenna system only (see
Fig. 1.16 (Right)).

Ethernet LAN can be connected to the IPsky2 modem/router through a proxy
server, public IP network, private FTP, VPN, etc.
1.7.2
Mobile Satellite Service (MSS)
The MSS consists of three types of GMSC services: maritime, land, and aero-
nautical and may include the space segment, Mobile and Land Earth Stations (MES
and LES) with all applications (SES, VES, AES, TES, PES), coordination and
control stations and centers (NCC, SCC, NCS, RCC, LUT), and TTN interface with
subscribers (see Fig. 1.17).
The MSS enables satellite linkage between MES and one or more space stations
or between space stations used for this service, or between two or more MES by
means of one or more space stations. This service may also include service and
feeder links necessary for its operations, and in such a way, MES can be connected
via service link to the satellite and from the satellite via feeder link to the LES.
The LES in MSS network can be Coast Earth Station (CES) for both maritime
and land mobile applications and Ground Earth Station (GES) for aeronautical
mobile application only. In a more general sense, this modern classiﬁcation can be a

63

provisional proposal but for the moment gives the reasonable ideas for future
establishment some practical universal nomenclature of GMSC’s terms.
The LES or GES are special Earth stations in MSC located at a speciﬁed ﬁxed
point or within a speciﬁed area on land, to provide a feeder link for MSS. The Base
Earth Station (BES) or gateway is an Earth station in mobile or ﬁxed satellite
service located at a speciﬁed ﬁxed point, or within a speciﬁed area on land, to
provide a feeder link for the MSS, especially for non-GEO systems.
Satellite radio beacon for indicating distress emergency position is a special
mobile or personal Earth station in the MSS, the emissions of which are intended to
facilitate SAR operation for distress in maritime, land, and aeronautical applica-
tions, such as EPIRB, PLB, and ELT, respectively.
The service link is a connection between MES and satellite, while the feeder link
means duplex connection between CES or GES in the given location and spacecraft
of the various MSC services operate in frequency bands allocated to the FSS. Thus,
the given location of MSS may be at a speciﬁed ﬁxed point or at any point within
speciﬁed areas. Therefore, a satellite link comprises one uplink and one downlink
performing radio linkage between a transmitting and a receiving Earth station.
1.7.2.1
Maritime Mobile Satellite Service (MMSS)
The MMSS is a service in which MES is located on board merchant or military
ships, other ﬂoating objects, rigs or offshore constructions, hovercrafts, and/or

Introduction

survival craft stations providing commercial, determination, logistic, tactical,
defense, and safety communications. In addition, the special maritime emergency
position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB) terminal, either portable or ﬁxed stations
on board oceangoing ships, may also participate in this service. The EPIRB is a
special Earth station in the MMSS, the emission of which is intended to facilitate
urgent SAR operation for vessels in distress for maritime applications. The EPIRB
unit can be also used as personal devices of passengers or crew members.
The MMSS service enables mobile satellite links between CES and Ship Earth
Station (SES), between two or more SES and/or between associated ships and other
satellite communications stations in all positions at sea or in ports. The SES is a
mobile Earth station in the MMSS capable of surface movement at sea within the
geographic limits of a country or continent.
In distinction from conventional maritime communications, a ship ﬁtted with
SES in or near a port may operate with CES or other SES in cases of distress and
commercial operations. The CES is a maritime Earth station located at a speciﬁed
ﬁxed point on the coast to provide a feeder link for MMSS. The SES is a maritime
Earth station ﬁxed on board ships or other ﬂoating objects, which can provide
communications links with subscribers onshore via CES and communications
spacecraft.
The ship on scene radiocommunications and alert service performs a distress and
safety service in the MMSS between one or more SES and CES, or between two or
more nearby SES, or between SES and RCC, or between portable or ﬂoating
EPIRB and LUT stations in which alert messages are useful to those concerned with
the movement and position of ships and of ships in distress.
1.7.2.2
Land Mobile Satellite Service (LMSS)
The LMSS is a service in which MES is located on different types of cars, trucks,
buses, trains, and other civil or military vehicles, providing logistics and business
communications, or it can be a transportable Earth station (TES). Besides, the land
emergency personal locator beacon (PLB) terminal may also participate in this
service as a special Earth station in the LMSS, the emissions of which are intended
to facilitate SAR operation of vehicles and/or personal distress and emergency on
the ground for land applications. This unit is very suitable for military applications,
for use in polar expeditions and for desert, remote, and rural environments.
The LMSS enables mobile satellite links between CES and Vehicle Earth Station
(VES), between two or more VES, and/or between associated MSC stations.
The VES is a mobile Earth station in the LMSS capable of surface movement on
dry roads or railways on land within the geographic limits of a certain country or
continent. The CES is a maritime Earth station also used for LMSS located at a
speciﬁed ﬁxed point on the coast to provide a feeder link for MMSS. The VES is a
land mobile Earth station ﬁxed on board road or rail or land vehicles, providing
communications links with terrestrial subscribers via CES and communications
spacecraft.

The land vehicle or persons on scene radiocommunications and alert service
perform a distress and safety service in the LMSS between one or more VES and
CES, between two or more nearby MES, between VES and RCC, or between PLB
and LUT stations in which messages are useful to those concerned with the position
of vehicles or persons in distress.
1.7.2.3
Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Service (AMSS)
The AMSS is a service in which MES is located on different types of airplanes,
helicopters, and other civil or military aircraft providing logistics, ﬂight regulations,
air trafﬁc control, safety, business, and private communications, primarily along
national or international civil air routes. This service is also intended for all kinds of
satellite communications, including those relating to ﬂight margin coordination in
corridors and air trafﬁc control, primarily outside national and international civil
aeronautical routes. The special emergency locator transmitter (ELT) terminal either
portable or ﬁxed on board aircraft stations may also participate in this service as a
special Earth station in the AMSS, the emission of which is intended to facilitate the
SAR operations for aircraft in distress and emergencies at sea, on the ground, and for
aeronautical applications.
The AMSS enables mobile satellite links between GES and Aircraft Earth Station
(AES), between two or more AES, and/or between associated airplanes/aircraft and
other satellite communications stations. The AES is a mobile Earth station in the
AMSS capable of ﬂying and maneuvering in the air over the geographic limits of a
country or continent. The GES is an aeronautical Earth station located at a speciﬁed
ﬁxed point on land to provide a feeder link for AMSS. The AES is an aeronautical
Earth station ﬁxed on board aircraft, which can provide communications links with
subscribers on land via GES and spacecraft.
The aircraft on scene radiocommunications and alert service performs a distress
and safety service in the AMSS between one or more AES and GES, between two
or more nearby MES, between AES and RCC, or between ELT and LUT stations in
which messages are useful to those concerned with the movements, ﬂight locations,
and/or positions of aircraft on land, in distress.
1.7.3
Personal Mobile Satellite Service (PMSS)
The PMSS is a service in which MES is handled by individuals and serving
everyone in wherever position possessing handset satellite phones. The system can
serve for both their GMSC and Global Mobile Personal Satellite Communications
(GMPSC). The land mobile emergency PLB terminal may also participate in this
service or actually may need some coordination with regard to the COSPAS–
SARSAT system. This service enables mobile satellite links between BES (gate-
ways) and personal Earth station (PES), between two or more PES, and/or between
66

Introduction

other satellite communication stations using the same satellite providers or fre-
quency spectrum. The PES is a mobile Earth station in the PMSS carried handheld
by individuals for personal and/or business facilities or capable of surface move-
ment at sea, on land, and in the air for professional utilization. As is evident, this
new system can also provide three types of GMSC services: maritime, land, and
aeronautical.
The BES or gateway is an Earth station located at a speciﬁed ﬁxed point to
provide a feeder link for PMSS. The PES is a personal Earth station or handheld
terminal carried by individuals or ﬁxed on board ships, vehicles, or aircraft, which
can provide two-way communications links with subscribers anywhere on Earth via
satellites and gateways.
The PES or persons on scene radiocommunications and alert service perform a
distress and safety service in the PMSS between one or more PES and BES,
between two or more nearby MES or PES, between PES and RCC, or between PLB
and LUT stations in which messages are useful to those concerned the position of
mobiles or persons in distress.
1.7.4
Radio Navigation Satellite Service (RNSS)
The RNSS can be used for the purposes of safety navigation and secure sailing or
ﬂight, including obstruction warnings. The RNSS is a one-directional system, in
which only mobile stations can know its own position, and others cannot. This
service may include the following:
1. Maritime Radio Navigation Satellite Service (MRNSS)—This is a special
service in which Earth station or navigation equipment is located on board ships.
2. Land Radio Navigation Satellite Service (LRNSS)—This is a special service
in which Earth stations or satellite air navigation equipment is located on board
land vehicle.
3. Aeronautical Radio Navigation Satellite Service (ARNSS)—This is a special
service in which Earth stations or satellite navigation equipment is located on
board aircraft.
1.7.5
Radio Determination Satellite Service (RDSS)
The RDSS is a special service for the purpose of radio determination involving the
use of one or more space stations and may include feeder links necessary for its
own operations.
This service provides the satellite radio determination of the position, velocity,
and/or other characteristics for each moving object and all mobile applications, to
1.7

67

obtain information relating to these parameters by means of the propagation
properties of radio waves.
A typical RDSS is Iridium, which provides two-way voice communications and
positioning services in a self-consistent manner. Using this system, a mobile station
has the possibility to determinate its own position, when other user stations can also
know that position, for example, handheld, ﬁxed and other Earth stations or a
station installed in an ofﬁce or onboard vehicle. In distinction from a radio navi-
gation one-directional system, the RDSS system is a bidirectional system
(Fig. 1.18).
1.7.6
Mobile Broadcast Satellite Service (MBSS)
The MBSS is one-way or two-ways satellite solution in which signals transmitted
by Earth stations or retransmitted by space stations are intended for direct reception
by the general public via satellite receivers and suitable antennas. Direct
Broadcasting Satellite (DBS) are one-way signals transmitted from ﬁxed positions
on the ground to the satellite and then back to all MES terminals, community
distribution by cable network, or direct individual receivers. This service requires
the generation of high RF power from the satellite to permit reception by small
antennas or onboard mobiles or on ground, shown in Figure 1.18.
Developments in digital audio/video broadcasting are, of course, not solely
limited to the terrestrial domain of the home market. Digital services offered by
satellite are now making signiﬁcant inroads into the mobile entertainment market,
which especially are maritime and aeronautical. New digital broadcasting service of

Introduction

CD-quality music programs and DVD-quality video transmissions via satellites to
many customers in mobiles has recently been attracting the attention of many
people in transportation industries.
The term “direct reception” in the MBSS shall encompass both individual ﬁxed
or mobile reception and community reception. Individual reception is any reception
of the emissions from space stations in the MBSS by simple domestic installations
at home or on board mobiles and in particular those processing small antenna,
intended for private or common use on board mobiles. Community reception is any
reception of the emissions from a space station in the MBSS by professional
receiving equipment, which in some cases may be complex and can have antenna
larger than those used for individual reception. This service is intended to be used
by a group of the general public at one ﬁxed or mobile location or through a
distribution system covering a limited area.
The present MBSS operates at 12 GHz band and is designed for community
reception, equipped with ﬁxed satellite terminals and large antennas. Besides, if a
satellite has enough power to transmit signals to be received by small antennas
suitable for individual reception equipped with satellite very small aperture termi-
nals (VSAT), or very small aperture antennas, the system is called a DBS system.
Although the present system is designed for ﬁxed service and terminals, new
systems are also serving all three mobile applications equipped with auto tracking
antennas. Some transportation means such as large oceangoing ships, cruisers,
airplanes ﬂying on intercontinental airlines, trains, and buses traveling on interna-
tional or interregional routes can install equipment to receive TV programs from
direct video broadcasting (DVB) and direct audio broadcasting (DAB) stations.
These mobile stations can be equipped with special tracking receive-only antenna
systems as a separate unit or in combination with two-way communications satellite
antennas. Therefore, this service may include audio (sound), video (television), and
data transmission.
1. Audio Broadcasting—Audio broadcasting is a special radio emission via
satellite for MSBS, in which signals transmitted by Earth stations or retrans-
mitted by space stations are intended for direct reception of audio signals by the
general public or mobile units via satellite receivers and corresponding antennas.
In Europe, USA, and Japan, the satellite DAB systems in the frequency L- and
S-bands have been investigated to allow the direct transmission of high-quality
programs, comparable to CD, to be developed. Usually, road vehicles are
equipped with such equipment.
2. Video Broadcasting—Video broadcasting is a special TV emission via satellite
for MSBS, in which signals transmitted by Earth stations or retransmitted by
space stations are intended for direct reception of DVB video and audio signals
by the general public or mobile units via satellite TV receivers and corre-
sponding antennas. All mobile units at sea, on land, and in the air can be
equipped with suitable video and tracking antenna equipment. The Inmarsat
system also provides audio and videoconferencing via HSD MPDS or mobile
ISDN interface using Fleet F77 service for ships and Swift64 for aircraft.

3. Data Broadcasting—Data broadcasting, using a different speed rate, is a spe-
cial data transmission via satellite for MBSS, in which signals transmitted by
Earth stations or retransmitted by space stations are intended for direct reception
of data signals by the general public or MES terminal via special HSD satellite
data receivers and corresponding omnidirectional or tracking antennas.
1.7.7
Mobile Satellite Broadband Service (MSBS)
The MSBS is a multimedia one- or two-way radiocommunication service in which
signals transmitted by mobile or ﬁxed Earth stations or retransmitted by space
stations are intended for direct reception by the general public or mobile units
through satellite receivers and corresponding antennas. This new system, similar to
the optical ﬁber terrestrial network, will provide various advanced interactive
multimedia services operating at higher bit rates, such as voice (audio), video,
different
speeds
of
data,
teletext,
videoconferencing,
distance
learning,
high-resolution graphics, HiFi audio, high-deﬁnition TV, color fax and imaging,
mobile Internet, and PC communications. Such advanced networks will soon cover
urban, ﬁxed, and mobile environments and most populations living in rural/remote
areas, which cannot be covered by landline and optical ﬁber or wireless TTN.
These signals are transmitted from LES to the satellite and then back to all
mobile or ﬁxed applications via optical ﬁber cable TTN. This service requires the
generation of high RF power from the satellite to permit reception by receivers and
small antennas on the ground. The MSBS has been developed by broadband MSC
operators and will start to offer a multimedia service for personal and all three
mobile applications, which allows any person or mobile to communicate anytime
and anyplace.
Thus, it will provide two categories of high-speed wireless access communi-
cations. The ﬁrst will be serviced both outdoors and indoors, which can enable a
high-speed rate up to 30 Mb/s, and the second will provide ultrahigh-speed indoors
only, which can transmit high-speed signals up to 600 Mb/s. The second system
cannot provide wide coverage areas or services in mobile environments, so the
main application is limited to a “hot spot” of indoor premises.
The next example of MSBS is DVB-RCS for ﬁxed and mobile solutions. This
system ties terrestrial networks (broadband, broadcasting, Internet, UMTS/GPRS
cellular, private, and public) via satellite HUB (LES) with antenna and C-, Ku-, or
Ka-band satellites, with satellite router terminals for remote Internet, VoIP,
videoconference, all e-services, interactive TV/radio, broadband LAN/WAN,
multicasting, intranet/VPN, etc.
The newly designed Intelligent Satellite Transport System (ISTS) will be also
part of the MBSS infrastructure, which comprises an advanced information and
telecommunications network for users, roads, and vehicles. The ISTS is expected to
greatly contribute to solving problems such as trafﬁc accidents and congestion. Not

only it solves such problems, but it ISTS will also provide multimedia services for
vehicle drivers and passengers. Otherwise, the ISTS consists of several develop-
ment areas, including technical advances in MSC and navigation systems, control
and tracking system, electronic toll collection system, and assistance for safe
driving, which is appreciated as one of the most promising mobile satellite multi-
media businesses.
Digital networks used to operate 64 Kb/s channels with the switching (trans-
mission) are based on the so-called synchronous transfer mode (STM). This mode
was developed mainly for transmission; thus, switching functions are difﬁcult to
handle at different bit rates. At this point, in the interest of more ﬂexible broadband
switching, therefore, a new asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) has been developed
that can handle trafﬁc relating to services that require widely differing bit rates.
In ATM, basically the information is put in ﬁxed-length cells that are switched and
transported to the broadband network and at the point of destination reconstituted in
its original synchronous form. Typical new services requiring broadband switching
equipment operating at higher speeds (bit rates) include desktop publishing, mul-
timedia service, videoconferencing, color fax, and HiFi music/HDTV.
1.8
Mobile Satellite Meteorological Service (MSMS)
The MSMS is a special infrastructure for obtaining meteorological data transmis-
sion via satellite, in which data signals transmitted by Earth stations or retransmitted
by space stations are intended for direct reception by the meteorological centers. In
fact, this service is used for one-way transmission of meteorological data only from
meteorological centers through the MSC system, including hydrological, observa-
tions, and exploration particular to ships, oil rigs, and aircraft mobile stations. In
such a way, this meteorological information, bulletins, and weather warnings are
very useful for the safe navigation and ﬂight of ships and aircraft, respectively.
The current need for quick and easy access to marine and aeronautical WX data
and forecast information has become increasingly important. The growing demand
of new sources of energy has led the offshore oil exploration into more remote and
hostile seas. Environmental constraints have narrowed the maneuvering margins of
many at-sea operations, so there is a need for an operational WX/forecast system,
which can quickly disseminate maritime and aeronautical WX to the users.

which can quickly disseminate maritime and aeronautical WX to the users.
Much of this information is transmitted from WX satellites via direct readout to
receiving ground stations where it can be displayed, analyzed, and prepared for
customers. These direct readout service (DRS) was developed and operated by
1.7
Frequency Designations and Classiﬁcation of Services
71

US NOAA, Russian (CIS), the ESA, Japan, China, India, etc. The most popular of
these WX services are WEFAX transmitted by the US Geostationary Operational
Environmental Satellites (GOES), and the Automatic Picture Transmission
(APT) from PEO NOAA satellites.
The GOES-8, -9, and -10 spacecraft series are carrying as well payloads with
GEOSAR transponders of GMSC COSPAS–SARSAT system. Therefore, remotely
sensed meteorological data are transmitted directly from GEO or PEO satellites in
“real time” to many ground forecasting center (GFC) and GES within signal range
of the WX satellite. The WX satellite images are designed with a format so that they
could be received, processed, and reproduced by relatively expensive GES equip-
ment and retransmitted free of charge to anyone with the appropriate satellite
receiving and display equipment.
The former USSR has been attempting for decades to develop an effective GEO
program for WX applications. Namely, due in part to the very high latitude of their
launch sites, it has been difﬁcult for Russia to design, build, and launch a
dependable GEO WX satellite system. After all, Russia had launched in 1994 a
Geostationary Operational Meteorological Satellite (GOMS) called Elektro-1 that is
placed in GEO at 76°E. During 1996 and 1997, the GOMS WEFAX service has
been operating erratically, and there have been problems with the imaging sensors.
An
Elektro-2
satellite

scheduled
for
launch
in
2000
to
improve
GOMAS WEFAX service. This satellite is also projected to be part of COSPAS–
SARSAT system, because is currying as well as GEOSAR transponder.
The European agency ESA organization also operates a series of GEO WX
satellites called meteorological satellite (Meteosat), which provide low-resolution
DRS similar to GOES WEFAX and called secondary users data station (SUDS).
Thus, the Meteosat-6 was replaced by Meteosat-7 in 1988, and new series of MSG
satellites were scheduled to be launched in 2001 (Fig. 1.19).
Japan has launched a series of geostationary meteorological satellites (GMS).
The last one GMS-5 was launched in 1994 at a position of 140°E, which transmits
both a primary data stream and WEFAX transmission on 1691 MHz. A new,

Introduction

advanced series of GEO MTSAT satellites for WX and aeronautical augmentation
services will start with operation in 2003 and replace GMS-5 spacecraft, which is
described in the same book of Volume 2.
The Indian INSAT-2A, -2B, and -3 multipurpose satellites have several pay-
loads; among the rest, they carry both WX and GEOSAR (COSPAS–SARSAT)
transponder. The Chinese GEO WEFAX program began with the launch of the
FY-2 (Feng Yun) satellite in 1997.
The basic footprint for the current operational GEO satellites transmitting
WEFAX data is presented in Figure 1.19. There are many other MLMSC obtaining
WX for mariners like AWT and others, and also for avionics such as METAR.
1.8.1
WEFAX System
The WEFAX (WX Fax) satellite images are designed with the format for the DRS
provided by the US GOES system. Otherwise, similar services are transmitted from
the European Meteosat, Russian GOMS, Japanese GMS and satellites from other
countries. The WEFAX system retransmits data consists of processed images
produced by the primary imager on the GOES above mentioned GEO as well as
other meteorological data and images relayed from PEO satellites. This System was
ﬁrst incorporated into the GOES satellites in 1975. The format of the WEFAX
signal was designed to be received and reproduced by low-cost GES. This satellite
delivered WEFAX signal should not be confused with the HF WX radio fax
transmission from coastal radio station (CRS), which some of service is still using.
Namely, the WEFAX system is a line-of-sight satellite transmission, with different
contents, and it uses speciﬁc receiving equipment. The GOES WEFAX data are
transmitted as an analog signal at 1691 MHz and 240 lines per minute. A large
amount and variety of data can than be obtained.
In the current WEFAX schedule, over 100 images can be received in a 24 h
period. These consist of scheduled data transmissions of quadrants of the full Earth
disk and equatorial regions in visible and infrared spectra, composite images from
PEO, WX and ice charts, and operational messages. The WEFAX image is initially
formatted by the special ground control station (GCS), using high-resolution GOES
image data polar orbiter mosaics and weather charts, and rebroadcasted through the
GOES satellite back to DRS of GES. In fact, it is a delayed DRS product or near
real time. The basic structure of the GOES network of Tx (transmitted) from
weather data collection platforms (WDCP) and Rx (received) weather information
by mobiles is shown in Fig. 1.20.
In order to receive the WEFAX transmissions, most stations use a parabolic or dish
antenna with stabilized and tracking platform for large ship MES. Thus, continuous
tracking of the antenna is not required for a ﬁxed GES. Namely, once properly aligned
to the satellite downlink signal, the antenna is locked into permanent position and
rarely requires any further adjustment. Except the antenna, a basic WEFAX RDS
station is typically comprised of the following electronic components: preampliﬁer,
1.8
Mobile Satellite Meteorological Service (MSMS)
73

receiver, demodulator card to decode the satellite signals, PC to display the satellite
imagery, a storage system (hard disk, CD writer, or ZIP drive) to memorize and
archive the satellite imagery, and computer software applications to manipulate the
imagery (image processing and enhancement). The basic WEFAX receiving con-
ﬁguration system can be purchased for about 800/1500 US$ without PC conﬁgura-
tion. The commercial DRS now available has been designed for a variety of computers
such as IBM-compatible, Apple Macintosh, and even some UNIX systems. While
most of the details in the preceding article have emphasized the US NOAA GOES
satellites and their WEFAX system, it is important to keep in mind that the WEFAX
service is global in nature. The WEFAX transmission of the Russian, Japanese, and
European GEO is nearly identical in their technical characteristics. The small dif-
ferences between these systems are normally easily resolved in the computer software
that comes with a commercial purchased receiving system, which will be usable even
if moved to different locations.
1.8.2
Automatic Picture Transmission (APT)
The APT is using DRS from PEO satellites to provide WX imagery for world
customers. The ﬁrst APT was pioneered on TIROS-VIII satellite launched in
December 1963. Today, US TIROS PEO satellites continue to transmit images of
the Earth by APT. These have been joined by Russian Meteor and the Chinese Feng
Yun spacecraft, providing similar transmissions. Because of that, an international
transmission standard has been agreed upon, so a GES capable of receiving data

Introduction

from the US PEO can receive images from satellites of other countries as well. On
the latest TIROS-N (ATN) series of PEO birds, the APT images are produced by a
special instrument called the advanced very high resolution radiometer (AVHRR).
This instrument is designed to detect ﬁve channels of energy reﬂection from the
Earth ranging from the visible spectrum and the near-infrared and infrared spectra.
The analog APT signal is derived from the original ﬁve-channel digital data and
multiplexed so that only two of the original channels appear in the APT format.
These two images are selected from GCS, and during daylight passes, they
usually consist of the visual channel and one of the infrared channels. At night, two
infrared images are usually found in the APT. The APT imagery consists of two
pictures, side by side, representing the same view of the Earth in two different
special bands. The Russian Meteor is transmitting daylight visible pictures only.
The APT signal is transmitted continuously from the PEO satellites to the GES
terminals. The result is image strip as long as the data transmission is received at the
GES and as wide as the scanning instrument is designed to operate at a particular
altitude. Radio reception of the APT signals is limited to line of sight from GES and
can only be received when the PEO satellite is above the horizon, namely when it is in
view with GES. This is determined by both the altitude of the satellite and its particular
path during the orbit across the GES reception range. At present, the US, Russian, and
Chinese PEO operate at an altitude between 810 and 1200 km. In such a manner, at
these altitudes, the maximum time of signal reception during an overhead pass is about
16 min. During this time, a GES terminal can receive a picture strip equivalent to
about 5800 km along the satellite path under the best reception conditions.
In order to obtain APT video data using direct reception, accurate information
concerning locations, movements, and times that the satellite can be received must
be available. This is necessary because signal reception is possible only while the
satellites are above that GES horizon. Although all PEO satellites have basic orbital
characteristics in common, each spacecraft is unique in its orbital parameters and
needs to be tracked individually. The data necessary to locate and track the WX
satellites are generally not difﬁcult to obtain. At any rate, the generation of future
orbits of a given satellite can be easily calculated, and if a directional antenna is
used, determining the azimuth and elevation of the satellite as it passes over the
GES is not difﬁcult after the basic orbital patterns are understood.
The last generation of US ATN satellites represents the current PEO spacecraft
available for receiving DRS data. The basic operational concept of this series is
only to maintain two satellites in a polar orbit at all time. One will maintain an orbit
so that it will pass over the GES, traveling from north to south during the morning,
having a southbound Equator crossing at about 0830 local solar time, while the next
satellite will pass from south to north during the afternoon, having a northbound
Equator crossing at about 1430 local solar time. In fact, each of these satellites will
also pass over the GES circa 12 h later traveling in the opposite direction. During
winter 1997/98 of North Hemisphere, the USA is operating NOAA-12 as a morning
spacecraft and NOAA-14 as the afternoon spacecraft.
With a two-satellite constellation such as the NOAA-12 and NOAA-14, one of
which will pass over the observing/receiving station about every six hours. Most
1.8
Mobile Satellite Meteorological Service (MSMS)
75

stations can receive two consecutive passes (about 100 min apart) from each
satellite, day and night. Being able to receive imagery about every six hours is more
than adequate to track the development and movement of large weather system
within an 800 to 1000 km radius of the station.
Technological advances in microelectronics and computer software applications
over the past two decades have made it rather simple to assemble and use a basic
DRS GES suitable for APT. However, a basic DRS station consists of the same
components except is additional a method to predict when the PEO satellite has to
be in view of the GES. This is because PEO satellites are not stationary like GEO
over the adequate positions on the Earth.
The APT direct transmission service from PEO satellites is more suitable for
smaller ships. The antenna is small and omnidirectional and therefore does not need
to be aimed at the satellite direction. Several different types of antennas may be
used for APT reception of slow-speed data. One can be directional and requires
tracking of the moving satellite, and the second type is omnidirectional. It has the
advantage of being less expensive and not requiring tracking system, but will give a
slightly reduced reception range. A turnstile reﬂector type of omnidirectional
antenna is one of the simplest and least expensive antennas to use for APT.
The next quadriﬁlar helix (QFH) antenna is a special type of omnidirectional
antenna that provides a much better radiation pattern compared to previous and
does not suffer from the loss of signal strength exhibited in simple turnstile antenna.
The APT signals from PEO satellites are transmitted on radio frequency between
137 and 138 MHz FM. Two US TIROS PEO satellites transmit APT on 137.5 and
137.62 MHz, and Russian Meteor has been using 137.85 MHz. Beginning in the
early 2003, the European Organization for the Exploration of Meteorological
Satellites (EUMETSAT) will launch their ﬁrst PEO meteorological satellite
Metop-1. It will carry a suite of advanced sensors and DRS transmission system.
Otherwise, of special note to the DRS user community is that the current APT
service will be replaced by low-rate picture transmission (LRPT) by Metop-1
spacecraft. The LRPT service will be digital rather than analog, requiring same
adequate modiﬁcation to present installed receiving stations.
1.8.3
Applied Weather Technology (AWT)
The AWT focus is on providing high-quality maritime global weather routing data
service through Inmarsat-A, -B, and -M SES equipment. This includes providing
the shipmaster with initial routing recommendation, continuous en route weather
forecast advisories (WX), and postvoyage analyses. The AWT is PC-aided weather
routing system and is committed to research and development in worldwide
weather information system. Thus, a number of fully operational software packages
76
1
Introduction

are under continuous development in order to provide up-to-date technology
solution to maritime and other clients:
1. Voyage Simulation Engine—Is PC-based computer software for dead reck-
oning vessel position commensurate with prospective WX and adjusted by true
position reported by vessel. An integrated database engine enables instant access
to ship’s actual and potential performance en route using MSS.
2. Bonvoyage System (BVS)—Is actually network compatible shore-based com-
pany ﬂeet management and monitoring system or can be onboard ship graphical
marine WX data brieﬁng system. Color-enhanced WX maps on PC screen
overlaying with vessels routing information not only provides up-to-the-minute
ﬂeet status at sea or in port, but also allows visual recognition of en route WX
conditions. On the other hand, the master of vessel is routinely facing real-time
WX report, not only bearing the paramount burden of safety of his ship, cargo,
and crew, but also struggling for the most cost-effective management and
economical operations and voyages.
For example, the forecast of an imminent storm system ahead of vessel track is in
reality a very difﬁcult task and huge responsibility of ship captain. However, it is
impossible for the traditional text-based WX routing to explain fully the detailed shape
of the storm system, dangerous wave-generating area, and detail grid information and
to ﬁnd out the best solution for safe and economical ship’s routes. To explore the BVS
is necessary to supply a modern PC conﬁguration running Windows, minimum 8 Mb
RAM and 10 Mb free disk space, Super VGA video card with at least 1 Mb RAM, and
popular asynchronous 9600 baud modem or faster would be recommended. The BVS
can be easily tailored for pleasure boat and yacht operators.
The AWT system is actively conducting research and development in the area of
ocean wave modeling, oceanographic data compression, optimum ship routing,
high-speed shipboard data transmission, and so on. These future developments, when
available, will become an integral part of the overall weather information service.
1.8.4
Global Meteorological Technologies (GMT)
The GMT system has been in operation for approximately 8 years as a manufac-
turer and service provider of software supplying WX data. Such data are provided
to ships or land-based operations through the Internet, Inmarsat, HF/VHF radio, or
PSTRN/PSDN networks. This system utilizes the backup network used by NOAA
and Environment Canada for their WX service communication. The GMT
WeatherWise software is a more economical and superior alternative to Weatherfax
as a means of receiving WX charts. Thus, charts are as near to real-time WX
conditions as can be technically be achieved and are available within the hour of
1.8
Mobile Satellite Meteorological Service (MSMS)
77

their measurement. Charts are presented in full color using NOAA and WMO
standard formats and codes and are available 24 h per day. Users have to supply
corresponding PC conﬁguration and peripherals. At all events, the faster the PC is,
the sooner the analyses can be calculated. Otherwise, all action of the mentioned
software can be activated by a mouse, trackball, joystick, or touch screen-equipped
PC. A keyboard is not required to use GMT WeatherWise, other than to reconﬁgure
active map and WX databases.
Data WeatherWise services are broadcast via Inmarsat-C or VHF radio and are
available on GMT bulletin board via HF radio and Internet network. However, any
GMDSS type-approved Inmarsat-C SES can be used to receive Inmarsat FleetNET
broadcast. A Hayes-compatible 2400-baud, or higher, modem is required to log onto
GMT service via Internet. Thus, the GMT WeatherWise is available in six modular
regions: the North Paciﬁc, North Atlantic, Eurasia, Far East, Good Hope, and Horn.
1.8.5
Maritime Noble Denton Weather Services (NDWS)
The NDWS system is private initiative to provide special marine WX forecasting
services to the international offshore and marine industry. Global meteorological
data are gathered and processed from NDWS center in London within 24 h to
enable the production of site- or route-speciﬁc forecasts for any location worldwide.
The WX forecasts are updated once or twice daily by fax, Tlx, or e-mail. Weather
routing for ocean towages can also be provided by Noble Denton in-house master
mariners.
1.8.6
Global Sea State Information via Internet (GSSII)
The ERS satellites operated by the ESA measure signiﬁcant sea wave heights and
period, 10 m wind speeds, and direction that beneﬁts the satellites 24 h. These data
are continuously received by UK Company Satellite Observing Systems where they
are routinely processed and corrected before necessary calibration factors are
applied. Results in the form of image maps and text summaries are generally
available within 2 to 3 h of data acquisition for direct delivery over the Internet or
retrieval on a daily subscription service via the World Wide Web (WWW).
However, a sea state alarm system also operates to give immediate WX warning by
e-mail messages of regional conditions in any part of the world in excess of 10 m
signiﬁcant wave height or 30 m/sec wind speed or 6 m minimum swell.

Aeronautical Weather Applications
The most popular WX service for aircraft is provided by SITA and ARINC
meteorological systems for aircraft in ﬂight or in the airport as follows:
1. SITA Aircom Weather System—This WX system offers several alternatives
via radio, Inmarsat Aero terminals, Internet, and on-site or hosted solutions such
as graphical WX charts created with country boundaries, airports, and various
other aeronautical features, thus providing maximum information within one
viewable image; graphical representation of WX data, mapped over airline
routes, facilitates alternative route selection based on wind patterns and other
critical WX information; each instance of wind within user’s environment can
be programmed to receive a unique set of charts; Aircom surface WX with all
meteorological parameters and NOTAM information important for safety ﬂight;
and different WX charts adapted to pilot needs such as surface WX, visibility,
satellite imaginary, radar imaginary, and lighting. The Aircom WX chart service
includes, but is not limited, the following types of weather information: sig-
niﬁcant weather, upper air weather (wind speed and direction), temperatures,
icing, turbulence, and precipitation.
2. ARINC Value-Added Service (VAS)—Except other corporate and safety
contribution, the VAS system provides similar media as SITA to transfer all
meteorological parameters and information to civil aircraft including meteoro-
logical
aviation
reports
(METAR)
and
terminal
area
forecast
(TAF).
The ARINC network organize as well as meteorological data collection and
reporting system (MDCRS), which collects information, organizes and dis-
seminates real-time automated position and WX reports from participating air-
lines, and forwards them to the National Weather Service (NWS) for input to
their forecast models. Weather products include radar precipitation images,
lighting, temperatures, icing, and turbulence and accurate forecast of wind aloft
is used to deﬁne areas of severe WX and contributes to ﬂight planning efﬁ-
ciencies and aviation safety. Otherwise, this service is similar to GOES
meteorological satellite system for WX data collection from aircraft, ships, or
other mobile or stationary platforms and transfers them via satellite to
NOAA/NESDIS stations, as is shown in Fig. 1.15. On the other hand, Terminal
Weather Information for Pilots (TWIP) provides valuable situational awareness
of weather conditions within 15 Nm of the airport. On the other hand, the TWIP
service collects information from airport sensors and transmits severe WX
warnings such as wind shear microbursts, gust fronts, heavy-to-moderate pre-
cipitation to aircraft, and ground operations computers.
3. Aeronautical Weather Reports—There are two types of weather reports
known as a METAR and the aviation Selected Special Weather Report (SPECI).
The METAR is observed hourly between 45 min after the hour till the hour and
transmitted between 50 min after the hour till the hour. It will be encoded as a
METAR even if it meets SPECI criteria.

1.8.7.1
Aviation Routine Weather Report (METAR)
The METAR format was introduced January 1, 1968, internationally and has been
modiﬁed a number of times since. However, North American countries continued to
use a surface aviation observation (SAO) for current weather conditions until June
1, 1996, when this report was replaced with an approved variant of the METAR
agreed
upon
in
a
1989
Geneva
agreement.
The
WMO
publication
No. 782 “Aerodrome Reports and Forecasts” contains the base METAR code as
adopted by the WMO member countries.
The name METAR is commonly believed to have its origins in the French
phrase: “message d’observation météorologique pour l’aviation regulars” or in
English: “Aviation Routine Weather Observation Message” or simply “report” and
would
therefore
be
a
contraction of
MÉTéorologique
Aviation Régulière
(METAR).
In general, METAR reports typically come from airports or permanent weather
observation stations. Reports are typically generated once an hour; if conditions
change signiﬁcantly, however, they can be updated in special reports called SPECI.
Some reports are encoded by automated airport weather stations located at airports,
military bases, and other sites. Some locations still use augmented observations,
which are recorded by digital sensors, encoded via software, and then reviewed by
certiﬁed weather observers or forecasters prior to being transmitted. However,
observations may also be taken by trained observers or forecasters who manually
observe and encode their observations prior to transmission.
A typical METAR report contains data for the temperature, dew point, wind
speed and direction, precipitation, cloud cover and heights, visibility, and baro-
metric pressure. A METAR report may also contain information on precipitation
amounts, lightning, and other information that would be of interest to pilots or
meteorologists such as a pilot report or PIREP, color states, and runway visual
range (RVR).
Although the METAR code is adopted worldwide, each country is allowed to
make modiﬁcations or exceptions to the code for use in their particular country,
e.g., the USA will continue to use statute miles for visibility, feet for RVR values,
knots for wind speed, and inches of mercury for altimetry. However, temperature
and dew point will be reported in degrees Celsius.
The USA will continue reporting prevailing visibility rather than lowest sector
visibility. Most of the current US observing procedures and policies will continue
after the METAR conversion date, with the information disseminated in the
METAR code and format. The elements in the body of a METAR report are
separated with a space. The only exceptions are RVR, temperature, and dew point,
which are separated with a solidus (/). When an element does not occur, or cannot
be observed, the preceding space and that element are omitted from that particular
report.
A METAR report contains the following elements: (1) type of report, (2) ICAO
station identiﬁer, (3) date and time of report, (4) modiﬁer (as required), (5) wind,
(6) visibility, (7) runway visual range (RVR) (as required), (8) weather phenomena,

(12) remarks (RMK) (as required).
1.8.7.2
Aeronautical Weather Forecast
1. Pilot Weather Reports (PIREP)—No observation is more timely than the one
made from the ﬂight deck. In fact, aircraft in ﬂight is the only means of
observing icing and turbulence. Other pilots welcome PIREP as well as do the
briefers and forecasters. A PIREP always helps someone and becomes part of
aviation weather. Pilots should report any observation that may be of concern to
other pilots. Also, if conditions were forecasted but were not encountered, a
pilot should also provide a PIREP. This will help the WX to verify forecast
products and create accurate products for the aviation community. Pilots should
help themselves, the aviation public, and the aviation weather forecasters by
providing PIREP. Required elements for all PIREP are type of report, location,
time, ﬂight level, aircraft type, and at least one weather element encountered. All
altitude references are mean sea level (MSL) unless otherwise noted, distance in
nautical miles, and time in Universal Coordinated Time (UTC). A PIREP is
transmitted in a prescribed format as follows: type of report (UUA/UA), location
(OV), time (TM), altitude/ﬂight level (FL), aircraft type (TP), sky cover (SK),
ﬂight visibility and weather (WX), temperature (TA), wind (WV), turbulence
(TB), icing (IC), and remarks (RM).
2. Radar Weather Report—General areas of precipitation, including rain, snow,
fog, clouds, and thunderstorm, can be observed by radar. Otherwise, on the
radar screen cannot be visible anything during very bad weather conditions and
in situation when deep clouds are spreading to the Earth surface.
3. Satellite Weather Pictures—Prior to weather satellites, WX observations were
made only at distinct points within the atmosphere and supplemented by PIREP
observation.
4. Radiosonde Additional Data (RADAT)—These data are obtained from the
radiosonde observations that are conducted twice a day at 00 and 12Z, such as
freezing level and the relative humidity associated with the freezing level.
5. Aviation Weather Forecasts—Good ﬂight planning involves considering the
following available weather information and weather forecasts: (1) Terminal
Aviation Forecast (TAF), (2) Aviation Area Forecast (FA), (3) Inﬂight Aviation
Weather Advisories, (4) Alaska, Gulf of Mexico, and International Area
Forecasts (FA), (5) Transcribed Weather Broadcasts (TWEB) Text Products,

Introduction

DCP can be installed in offshore or onshore locations and onboard ships, whose
main task is to collect local meteorological data and send via GEO satellite to some
direct readout station. Each DCP station is specialized for the following tasks:
1. Hydrological measurement data are essential for the prediction and solution of
ﬂood, water pollution, drought, and erosion problems. Some areas have plenty
of water, while other areas, afﬂicted by drought, go wanting.
2. Coastal weather stations produce meteorological data for sea weather forecasts
and to warn ships and offshore operators about severe weather conditions. The
same data are also used in regional and global computer models to help predict
atmospheric changes and monitor ocean climate and the state of the oceans.
3. Agrometeorological automatic weather station (AWS) systems measure in-site
weather conditions in parallel with local forecasts. The objective is to produce
weather data that enable optimal timing and control of all ﬁeld operations. The
data are gathered, stored, viewed, and analyzed to enable more proﬁtable
decisions with less risk in farm management.
4. Weather can create signiﬁcant disruptions in urban areas. Heavy rains can cause
severe ﬂooding, snow and freezing rain can disrupt transportation systems, and
major storms with accompanying lightning, hail, and high winds can cause
power failures.
The main variables of hydrological measurements in AWS are precipitation;
water level (rivers, lakes, reservoirs, wells); water temperature; snow depth; water
ﬂow; evaporation; soil moisture; and ambient water quality. The sensors used in
Vaisala AWS fulﬁll WMO recommendation for accuracy.

Chapter 2
Space Segment
This chapter describes orbital mechanics and their signiﬁcance with regard to
satellite use for Mobile Satellite Communications (MSC). The space segment of an
artiﬁcial satellite system is one of its three major operational components, the others
being the ground and user segments. It comprises the different satellite constellations
and the satellite uplink and downlink. Namely, here are introduced the fundamental
laws governing satellite orbits and the principal parameters that describe the motion
of the Earth’s artiﬁcial satellites. The types of satellite orbits are also classiﬁed,
presented, and compared from the MSC system viewpoint in terms of coverage and
link performances. The satellite bus and payloads for communications, broadcasting,
and navigation (GNSS) are discussed. The chapter concludes with a brief overview
of satellite launch vehicles and orbit insertion. Types of satellite orbits and pertur-
bations are also classiﬁed and compared from the communication and navigation
systems viewpoint in terms of coverage and link performances.
During the last four decades, military and commercial MSC networks have
utilized GEO extensively to the point where orbital portions have become quite
crowded and coordination between satellites is becoming constrained and could
never solve the problem of polar coverage. On the other hand, non-GEO MSC
solutions have recently grown in importance because of their orbit characteristics
and coverage capabilities in high latitudes and polar regions.

Platforms and Orbital Mechanics
The platform is an artiﬁcial object located in orbit around the Earth at a minimum
altitude of about 20 km in the stratosphere and a maximum distance of about
36,000 km in the Space. The artiﬁcial platforms can have a different shape and
designation but usually they have the form of aircraft, airship, or spacecraft. In
addition, there are special space stations and space ships, which are serving on more

distant locations from the Earth’s surface for scientiﬁc exploration and research and
for cosmic expeditions.
Orbital mechanics is a speciﬁc discipline describing planetary and satellite
motion in the solar system, which can solve the problems of calculating and
determining the position, speed, path, perturbation, and other orbital parameters of
planets and satellites. In fact, a space platform is deﬁned as an unattended object
revolving about a larger one. Although it was used to denote a planet’s Moon, since
1957 it also means a man-made object put into orbit around a large body (planet),
when the former USSR launched its ﬁrst spacecraft Sputnik-1. Accordingly,
man-made satellites are sometimes called artiﬁcial satellites.
Orbital mechanics support a communications satellites project in the phases of
orbital design and operations. The orbital design is based on a generic survey of
orbits and at an early stage in the MSC project is tasked to identify the most suitable
orbit for the objective MSC service. The orbital operation is based on rather
short-term knowledge of the orbital motion of the satellite and starts with TT&C
maintenances after the satellite is located in orbit. In effect, only a few types of
satellite orbits are well suited for MSC and navigation systems.
2.1.1
Space Environment
The satellite service begins when a spacecraft is located as a space platform in the
desired orbital position in a space environment around the Earth. This space
environment is a very speciﬁc part of the Universe, where many factors and
determined elements affect the planet and satellite motions. The Earth is surrounded
by a thick layer of many different gasses and parts known as the atmosphere, whose
density decreases as the altitude increases. Hence, there is no air and the atmosphere
disappears at about 180 km above the Earth, where the Cosmos begins. The endless
environment in space is not very friendly and is extremely destructive, mainly
because there is no atmosphere, the cosmic radiation is very powerful, the vacuum
creates very high pressure on spacecraft or other bodies, and there is the negative
inﬂuence of very low temperatures.
The Earth’s gravity keeps everything on its surface. All the heavenly bodies such
as the Sun, Moon, planets, and stars have gravity and reciprocal reactions. Any
object ﬂying in the atmosphere continues to travel until it meets forces due to the
Earth’s gravity or until it has enough speed to surpass gravity and to hover in the
stratosphere. However, to send an object into space, it ﬁrst has to overcome gravity
and then travel at least at a particular minimum speed to stay in space. In this case,
an object traveling at about 5 miles/s can circle around the Earth and become an
artiﬁcial spacecraft.
An enormous amount of energy is necessary to put a satellite into orbit and this
is realized by using a powerful rockets or launchers, which are deﬁned as an
apparatus consisting of a case containing a propellant (fuel) and reagents by the
combustion of which it is projected into the space. As the payload is carried on the
86

Space Segment

top, the rocket is usually separated and drops each stage after burnout and brings a
payload up to the required velocity and leaves it in orbit. A rocket is also known as
a booster, as a rocket starts with a low velocity and attains some required height,
where air drag decreases and it attains a higher velocity.
2.1.2
Laws of Satellite Motion
A satellite is an artiﬁcial object located by rocket in space orbit following the same
laws in its motion as the planets rotating around the Sun. Thus, Johannes Kepler, a
German mathematician, has contributed a great deal to the ﬁeld of astronomy and
astrology. The Laws of Planetary Motion formulated by Kepler proves that the
orbits of the planets are ellipses and not circles, as believed by many. The ellipse is
a geometrical shape that has two foci, such that the sum of the distance from the
focus to any point on the surface of the ellipse is constant. The orbits of planets
have small eccentricities (ﬂattening of ellipse), and so, they appear as circles. Based
on the properties of ellipses, Johannes Kepler devised three laws that explain the
motion of planets around the Sun.
A satellite is an artiﬁcial object launched and located by rocket in orbit follows
the same laws in its motion as the planets rotating around the Sun. Thus, three
important laws for planetary motion were derived by Johannes Kepler, as follows:
1. First Law—The ﬁrst law is also known as The Law of Orbits. As stated, an
ellipse has two foci. While studying the motion of planets around the Sun, Kepler
explained that the path followed was elliptical, with the Sun as one of the two foci.
In simple terms, the law is stated as: The orbit of each planet follows an elliptical
path or all planets move in elliptical orbits, with the Sun at one focus, shown in
Fig. 2.1a. This indicates that the Sun is one focus, while the other focus is known as
the vacant or empty focus.
As shown in the diagram, the Sun and the empty focus lie on the major axis of
the ellipse, and the planet lies on the surface of the ellipse. As the planet is
continuously moving around the Sun, and as the Sun is not at the center of the
ellipse, the Planet–Sun distance will always keep on changing. The Law of Orbits
proofs that planet motion lies in the plane around the Sun (1602).

87

2. Second Law—The second law is also known as The Law of Equal Areas,
shown in Fig. 2.1b. As the Sun is one of the foci, it is clear that the Planet–Sun
distance will be changing. But, the planet covers up for the increase in the distance
by moving faster when it is closer to the Sun. This indicates that planets do not
move at a uniform speed. This law states that: The line from the Sun to orbital
planet or radius vector (r) sweeps out equal areas in equal intervals of time (t) as the
planet travels around the ellipse. The point at which the speed of the planet is fastest
is known as Perihelion or Perigee indicated with F (Fastest motion), while the
distance with slowest speed is known as Aphelion (Apogee) indicated by S
(Slowest motion). The distance measured from the Perihelion to the position of the
Sun is known as Perihelion distance, while the distance from the Sun to the
Aphelion is known as the Aphelion distance. The law says that while moving in an
elliptical path, the planet moves faster when it is closer to the Sun. This way, the
radius sweeps equal areas in equal amount of time. If the planet is observed at
successive times (P1, P2, P3, P4), it draws the radius vector during the ﬁrst second
observations, showing that the two radius vectors having the same area. So, the area
swept during the time (t) by the planet to move from P1 to P2 is the same as the area
swept while moving from P3 to P4. This is the Law of Equal Areas (1605).
3. Third Law—The third law of planetary motion in ellipse with Perigee (P) and
Apogee (A) is alternatively known as The Law of Periods and Harmonic Law, see
Fig. 2.1c. This law relates the time required by a planet to make a complete trip
around the Sun to its mean distance from the Sun. It can be simply stated as: The
square of the planet orbital period is directly proportional to the cube of the
semi-major axis of its orbit. The square of the planet’s orbital period around the Sun
(T) is proportional to the cube of the semi-major axis (a = distance from the Sun) of
the ellipse for all planets in the Solar system (1618).
Kepler’s laws only describe the planetary motion if the mass of central body
insofar as it is considered to be concentrated in its center and when its orbits are not
affected by other systems. However, these conditions are not completely fulﬁlled in
the case of Earth’s motion and its artiﬁcial satellites. Namely, the Earth does not have
an ideal spherical shape and the different layers of mass are not equally concentrated
inside of the Earth’s body. Because of this, the satellite motions are not ideally
synchronized and stable, and the motions are namely slower or faster at particular
orbital sectors, which present certain exceptions to the rule of Kepler’s laws.
Furthermore, in distinction from natural satellites, whose orbits are almost ellip-
tical, the artiﬁcial satellites can also have circular orbits, for which the basic relation
can be obtained by the equalizing the centrifugal and centripetal Earth forces.

Kepler’s laws were based on observational records and only described the
planetary motion without attempting an additional theoretical or mathematical
explanation of why the motion takes place in that manner.
In 1687, the English physicist British Sir Isaac Newton published his break-
through work “Principia Mathematica” with own syntheses, known as the Three
Laws of Motion, such as follows:
1. Law I—Every body continues in its state of rest or uniform motion in a straight
line, unless it is compelled to change that state by forces impressed on it.
2. Law II—The change of momentum per unit time of a body is proportional to
the force impressed on it and is in the same direction as that force.
3. Law III—To every action, there is always an equal and opposite reaction.
On the basis of Law II, Newton also formulated the Law of Universal
Gravitation, which states that any two bodies attract one another with a force
proportional to the products of their masses and inversely proportional to the square
of the distance between them. This law may be expressed mathematically for a
circular orbit with the relations:
F ¼ mð2p=tÞ2 R þ h
ð
Þ ¼ G M  m= R þ h
ð
Þ2
h
i
ð2:1Þ
where parameter m = mass of the satellite body; t = time of satellite orbit;
R = equatorial radius of the Earth (6.37816 × 106 m); h = altitude of satellite
above the Earth’s surface; G = Universal gravitational constant (6.67 × 10−11
N m2/kg−2); M = Mass of the Earth body (5.976032 × 1024 kg) and ﬁnally,
F = force of mass (m) due to mass (M). Force of mass can be also presented by the
following relation:
F ¼ ma ¼ dv=dt
ð2:2Þ
where a = acceleration and v = velocity of satellite orbit.
The force of attraction between two distant point masses m1 and m2 separated by
a distance r is giving the following relation:
F ¼ Gm1m2=r2
ð2:3Þ
where G = Newtonian (or universal) gravitation constant.
Consider the simple circular orbit and assuming that the Earth is a sphere, it is
possible that can be treated a point mass. The centripetal force Fc required to keep
the satellite in a circular orbit = mv2/r, where ν = orbital velocity of the satellite.
The force of gravity that supplies this centripetal force is GMm/r2, where
M = mass of the Earth, and m is the mass of the satellite. Equating the two forces
gives relation:
2.1
Platforms and Orbital Mechanics
89

Fc ¼ mv2=r ¼ GMm=r2
ð2:4Þ
Division by m eliminates the mass of the satellite from the equation, which
means that the orbit of a satellite is independent of its mass. Thus, the period of the
satellite is the orbit circumference divided by the velocity: T = 2πr/v. Substituting
in Eq. 3.3 gives the following relation:
T2 ¼ ð4p2=GMÞr3
ð2:5Þ
The ﬁrst-generation NOAA meteorological satellites orbit at approximately
850 km above the Earth’s surface. Since the equatorial radius of the Earth is about
6378 km, the orbit radius is about 7228 km. Substituting in Eq. 3.4 shows that the
NOAA satellites have a period of about 102 min.
However, radius required for a satellite in GEO has the same angular velocity as
the Earth, so the angular velocity mean motion constant of a satellite shows the
following:
n ¼ 2p=T
ð2:6Þ
Substituting Eq. 2.6 in Eq. 2.5 is giving the following formula:
r3 ¼ GM=n2
ð2:7Þ
Inserting the angular velocity of the Earth, the required radius for a GEO is
42,164 km or about 35,786 km above the Earth’s surface.
2.1.2.1
Geometry of Elliptical Orbit
The satellite in circular orbit undergoes its revolution at a ﬁxed altitude and with
ﬁxed velocity, while a satellite in an elliptical orbit can drastically vary its altitude
and velocity during one revolution. The elliptical orbit is also subjected to Kepler’s
Three Laws of satellite motion.
Therefore, the characteristics of elliptical orbit can be determined from elements
of the ellipse of the satellite plane with the perigee (Π) and apogee (A) and its
position in relation to the Earth, see Fig. 2.2 (Left). The parameters of elliptical
orbit are presented as follows:

where e = eccentricity, which determines the type of conical section; a = large
semi-major axis of elliptical orbit; b = small semi-major axis of elliptical orbit;
90

c = axis between center of the Earth and center of ellipse, and p = focal parameter.
The equation of ellipse derived from polar coordinates can be presented with the
resulting trajectory equation as follows:
r ¼ p=1 þ e cos h½m
ð2:9Þ
where r = distance of the satellites from the center of the Earth (r = R + h) or
radius of path; ⊖= true anomaly and E = eccentric anomaly. In this case, the
position of the satellite will be determined by the angle called “the true anomaly,”
which can be counted positively in the direction of movement of the satellite from
0° to 360°, between the direction of the perigee and the direction of the satellite (S).
The position of the satellite can also be deﬁned by eccentric anomaly, which is
the argument of the image in the mapping, which transforms the elliptical trajectory
into its principal circle, an angle counted positively in the direction of movement of
the satellite from 0 to 360°, between the direction of the perigee and the direction of
the satellite. The relations for both mentioned anomalies are given by the following
equations:
cos h ¼ cos Ee=1e cos E
cos E ¼ cos h þ e=1 þ e cos h
ð2:10Þ
The total mechanical energy of a satellite in elliptical orbit is constant, although
there is an interchange between the potential and the kinetic energies. As a result, a
satellite slows down when it moves up and gains speed as it loses height. Thus,
considering
the

(Kepler’s

Therefore, the last equation is the calculated period of sidereal day for the elliptical
orbit of Russian-based satellite Molniya with apogee = 40,000 km, perigee =
500 km, revolution time = 719 min and a = 0.5 (40,000 + 500 + 2 × 6378.16)
= 26628.15 km.
2.1.2.2
Geometry of Circular Orbit
The circular orbit is a special case of elliptical orbit, which is formed from the
relations a = b = r and e = 0, see Fig. 2.2 (Right). According to Kepler’s Third

Law, the solar time (τ) in relation to the right ascension of an ascending node angle
(Ω), the sidereal time (t) with the consideration that μ = GM, and satellite altitude
(h), for a satellite in circular orbit, will have the following relations:

6:37816  106½m
ð2:13Þ
The time is measured with reference to the Sun by solar and sidereal day. Thus, a
solar day is deﬁned as the time between the successive passages of the Sun over a
local meridian. In fact, a solar day is a little bit longer than a sidereal day, because
the Earth revolves by more than 360° for successive passages of the Sun over a
point 0.986° further. On the other hand, a sidereal day is the time required for the
Earth to rotate one circle of 360° around its axis: tE = 23 h 56 min 4.09 s.
Therefore, a geostationary satellite must have an orbital period of one sidereal day
in order to appear stationary to an observer on Earth. During rotation, the duration
of sidereal day t = 85,164,091 (s) and is considered in such a way for synchronous
orbit that h = 35786.04 × 103 (m). The speed is conversely proportional to the
radius of the path (R + h) and for the satellite in circular orbit, it can be calculated
from the following relation:
v ¼ p MG=R þ h

Þ ¼ p l=r

Þ ¼ 1:996502  107=pr ¼ 631:65pr m=s

From Eq. (2.8) and using the duration of sidereal day (tE) gives the relation for
the radius of synchronous or geostationary orbits:

The satellite trajectory can have any angle of orbital planes in relation to the
equatorial plane: in the range from PEO up to GEO plane. Namely, if the satellite is
rotating in the same direction of Earth’s motion, where (tE) is the period of the
Earth’s orbit, the apparent orbiting time (ta) is calculated by the following relation:
ta ¼ tE  t=tEt
ð2:16Þ
This means, inasmuch as t = tE the satellite is geostationary (ta = ∞or τ = 0). In
Table 2.1, several values for times different from synchronous orbital time are
presented.
According to Table 2.1 and Eq. (2.9), it is evident that a satellite does not depend
so much on its mass but decreases with higher altitude. In addition, satellites in
circular orbits with altitudes of a 1700, 10,400 and 36,000 km will have t/ τ values
2/2,18, 6/8, and 24/zero, respectively. In this case, it is evident that only a satellite
constellation at altitudes of about 36,000 km can be synchronous or geostationary.
2.1.3
Horizon and Geographic Satellite Coordinates
The horizon system is a type of orbital coordinate parameters that can be used to
locate the position of objects in the space. In a satellite, orbits usually use local
geographic coordinates, which rotate with the Earth. The horizon and geographical
coordinates are very important to ﬁnd out many satellite parameters and equations
for better understanding the problems of orbital plane, satellite distance, visibility of
the satellite, coverage areas, etc. The coverage areas of a satellite are illustrated in
Fig. 2.3a with the following geometrical parameters: actual altitude (h), radius of
Earth (R), angle of elevation (ε), angle of azimuth (A), distance between satellite
and the Earth’s surface (d), and central angle (Ψ) or subsatellite angle, which is
similar to the angle of antenna radiation (δ).
The geographical and horizon coordinates of a satellite are presented in Fig. 2.3b
with the following, not yet mentioned, main parameters: angular speed of the
Earth’s rotation (ν), argument of the perigee (ω), moment of satellite pass across
any point on the orbit (to), which can be perigee (Π), projection of the perigee point

Observer or Mobile (M), latitudes of observer and satellite (φM and φS), longitudes
of observer and satellite (λM and λS), inclination angle (i) of the orbital plane
measured between the equatorial and orbital plane, and the right ascension of an
ascending node angle in the moment of to (Ωo).
Otherwise, the right ascension of an ascending node angle (Ω) is the angle in the
equatorial plane measured counterclockwise from the direction of the vernal
equinox to that of the ascending node, while the argument of the perigee (ω) is the
angle between the direction of the ascending node and the direction of the perigee.
2.1.3.1
Satellite Distance and Coverage Area
The area coverage or angle of view for each type of satellite depends on orbital
parameters, its position in relation to the Land Earth Station (LES), and geographic
coordinates. This relation is very simple in the case where the subsatellite point is in
the center of coverage, while all other samples are more complicated. Thus, the angle
of a GEO satellite inside its range has the following regular reciprocal relation:
d þ e þ W ¼ 90o
ð2:17Þ
The circular sector radius can be determined by the following relation:
Rs ¼ R sin W
ð2:18Þ
When the altitude of orbit h is the distance between satellite and subsatellite
point (SP), the relation for the altitude of the circular sector can be written as:

From a satellite communications point of view, there are three key parameters
associated with an orbiting satellite, such as (1) Coverage area or the portion of the
Earth’s surface that can receive the satellite’s transmissions with an elevation angle
larger than a prescribed minimum angle; (2) The slant range (actual LOS distance
from a ﬁxed point on the Earth to the satellite), and (3) The length of time a satellite
is visible with a prescribed elevation angle.
Elevation angle is an important parameter, since communications can be sig-
niﬁcantly impaired if the satellite has to be viewed at a low-elevation angle, that is,
an angle too close to the horizon line. In this case, a satellite close to synchronous
orbit covers about 40 % of the Earth’s surface. Thus, from the diagram in Fig. 2.3a
a covered area expressed with central angle (2δ or 2Ψ) or with arc (MP ≈RΨ) as a
part of Earth’s surface can be derived with the following relation:

elevation angle can be deﬁned in this way:

This determines the direct propagation length between LES, (h) and (ε) and will
also ﬁnd the total propagation power loss from LES to satellite. In addition,

To propagate over a path of length (z) km, it takes about 100 ms to transmit to
GEO. If the location of the satellite is uncertain ± 40 km, a time delay of about
±133 μsec is always present in the Earth-to-satellite propagation path. When the
satellite is in orbit at altitude (h), it will pass over a point on Earth with an elevation
angle (ε) for a time period:

Therefore, all MES and LES with a position above Ψ = 81° will be not covered
by GEO satellites. Since the Earth’s square area is 510,100,933.5 km2 and the
extent of the equator is 40,076.6 km, only with three GEO mutually moved apart in
the orbit by 120° it is possible to cover a great area of the Earth’s surface, see
Fig. 2.4a, which shows AOR (Atlantic), IOR (Indian), and POR (Paciﬁc) satellite
coverages. The zero angles of elevation have to be avoided, even to get maximum
coverage, because this increases the noise temperature of the receiving antenna.
Owing to this problem, an equation for the central angle with minimum angle of
view between 5° and 30° will be calculated with:

The view angle under which a GEO satellite can see LES/MES is called the
“subsatellite angle.” More distant points in the coverage area for GEO satellites are
limited around φ = 70° of North and South geographical latitudes and around
λ = 70° of East and West geographical longitudes, viewed from the subsatellite
point. Theoretically, all Earth stations around these positions are able to see
satellites by a minimum angle of elevation of ε = 5°. Such access is very easy to
calculate, using simple trigonometry relations:
de¼0 ¼ arc sin k9o
ð2:30Þ
At any rate, the angle (Ψ) is in correlation with angle (δ), which can determine
the aperture radiation beam. For example, the aperture radiation beam of satellite
antenna for global coverage has a radiation beam of 2δ = 17.3°. According to
Fig. 2.3a, it will be easy to ﬁnd out relations for GEO satellites as follows:

ð2:31Þ
ds ¼ 90  Ws ¼ 8420  1:8200
Differently to say, the width of the beam aperture (2δs) is providing the maxi-
mum possible coverage for synchronous circular orbit. The distance of LES and
MES with regard to the satellite can be calculated using Fig. 2.3a and Eqs. (2.13)
and (2.22) by:
d ¼ R sin W= sin d ¼ r sin = cos e
ð2:32Þ
The parameter (d) is quite important for transmitter power regulation of LES,

Accordingly, when the position of any MES is near the equator in subsatellite
point (P) or right under the GEO satellite, its distance is equal to the satellite altitude
and takes out value for d = H of 35,786 km. Thus, every MES will have a further

2.1.3.2
Satellite Look Angles (Elevation and Azimuth)
The horizon coordinates are considered to determine satellite position in correlation
with an Earth observer, LES, and MES terminals. These speciﬁc and important
horizon coordinates are angles of satellite elevation and azimuth, illustrated in
Figs. 2.3a, b and 2.4b, respectively.
The satellite elevation (ε) is the angle composed upward from the horizon to the
vertical satellite direction on the vertical plane at the observer point. From point
(M) shown in Fig. 2.3a, the look angle of ε value can be calculated by the following
relation:
tg e ¼ cos Wk= sin W
ð2:34Þ
Figure 2.5a illustrates the Mercator chart of the First-Generation Inmarsat space
segment, using three-ocean coverage areas with the projection of elevation angles
and with one example of a plotted position of a hypothetical ship (may also be
aircraft or any mobile). Thus, it can be concluded that Mobile Earth Station
(MES) at designated position (ε = 25° for IOR and ε = 16° for AOR) has the
possibility to use either GEO satellites over IOR or AOR to communicate with any
LES inside the coverage areas of both satellites.
The satellite azimuth (A) is the angle measured eastward from the geographical
North line to the projection of the satellite path on the horizontal plane at the
observer point. This angle varies between 0 and 360° as a function of the relative
positions of the satellite and the point is considered. The azimuth value of the
satellite and subsatellite point looking from the point (M) or the hypothetical
position of MES can be calculated as follows:
tg A0 ¼ tg D kMk= sin W
ð2:35Þ
Otherwise, the azimuth value, looking from subsatellite point (P), can be cal-
culated as:
tg A ¼ sin D k=tg u or sin A ¼ cos u sin D kcosecW
ð2:36Þ
Figure 2.5b illustrates the Mercator chart of First-Generation Inmarsat 3-satellite
or ocean coverage areas with the projection of azimuth angles, with one example for
the plotted position of a hypothetical ship (ε = 47° for IOR and ε = 303° for AOR).

Any mobile inside of both satellites’ coverage can establish a radio link to the
subscribers onshore via any LES.
However, parameter (A’) is the angle between the meridian plane of point
(M) and the plane of a big circle crossing this point and subsatellite point (P), while
the parameter (A) is the angle between a big circle and the meridian plane of point
(P). Thus, the elevation and azimuth are, respectively, vertical or horizontal look
angles, or angles of view, in which range the satellite can be seen.
Figure 2.6a presents a correlation of the look angle for three basic parameters (δ,
Ψ, d) in relation to the altitude of the satellite. Inasmuch as the altitude of the
satellite is increasing as the values of central angle (Ψ), distance between satellite
and the Earth’s surface (d) and duration of communication (tc) or time length of
signals are increasing, while the value of subsatellite angle (δ) is indirectly pro-
portional. An important increase of look angle and duration of communication can

Platforms and Orbital Mechanics
99

be realized by increasing the altitude to 30 or 35,000 km, while an increase in look
angle is unimportant for altitudes of more than 50,000 km. The duration of com-
munication is affected by the direction’s displacement from the center of look angle,
which will have maximum value in the case when the direction is passing across the
zenith of the LES. The single angle of the satellite in circular orbit depends on the
t/2 value, which in area of satellite look angle, can be found in the duration of the
time and is determined as:
tc ¼ W t=p
ð2:37Þ
Practical determination of the geometric parameters of a satellite is possible by
using many kinds of plans, graphs, and tables. It is possible to use tables for
positions of MES (φ, λ), by the aid of which longitudinal differences can be
determined between MES and satellite for four feasible ship’s positions: N/W, S/W,
N/E, and S/E in relation to GEO.
One of the most important practical pieces of information about a communi-
cations satellite is whether it can be seen from a particular location on the Earth’s
surface. In Fig. 2.6b, a graphic design is shown which can approximately determine
limited zones of satellite visibility from the Earth (MES) by using elevation and
azimuth angles under the condition that δ = 0. This graphic contains two groups of
crossing curves, which are used to compare (φ) and (Δλ,) coordinates of mobile
positions. Thus, the ﬁrst group of parallel concentric curves shows the geometric
positions where elevation has the constant value (ε = 0), while the second group of
fan-shaped curves starting from the center shows the geometric positions where the
difference in azimuth has the constant value (a = 0). This diagram can be used in
accordance with Fig. 2.3b in the following order:

(1) First, it is necessary to note the longitude values of satellite (λS) and mobile
(λM) and the latitude of the mobile (φM), then calculate the difference in
longitude (Δλ), and plot the point into the graphic with both coordinates (φM &
Δλ).
(2) The value of elevation angle (ε) can then be determined by a plotted point
from the group of parallel concentric curves.
(3) The difference value of azimuth (a) can be determined by a plotted point from
the group of fan-shaped curves starting from the center.
(4) Finally, depending on the mobile position, the value of azimuth (A) can be
determined on the basis of the relations presented in Table 2.2.
Inasmuch as the position of Ship Earth Station (SES) or any MES is of sig-
niﬁcant or greater height above sea level (if the bridge or ship’s antenna is in a very
high position) or according to the ﬂight altitude of Aircraft Earth Station (AES), the
elevation angle will be compensated by the following parameter:
x ¼ arccos 1H=R
ð
Þ
ð2:38Þ
where H = height above sea level of observer or MES. Let us say, if the position of
LES is a height of H = 1000 m above sea level, the value of x ≈1°. This example
can be used for the determination of AES compensation parameters, depending on
actual aircraft altitude. In such a way, the estimated value of elevation angle has to
be subtracted for the value of the compensation parameter (x).
2.1.3.3
Satellite Track and Geometry (Longitude and Latitude)
The satellite track on the Earth’s surface and the presentation of a satellite’s position
in correlation with the MES results from a spherical coordinate system, whose
center is the middle of Earth, is illustrated in Fig. 2.3b. In this way, the satellite
position in any time can be decided by the geographic coordinates, subsatellite
point, and range of radius. Thus, the subsatellite point is a determined position on
the Earth’s surface; above, it is the satellite at its zenith.
The longitude and latitude are geographic coordinates of the subsatellite point,
which can be calculated from the spherical triangle (B’ГP), using the following
relations:

ð2:39Þ
With the presented equation in previous relation, it is possible to calculate the
satellite path or trajectory of subsatellite points on the Earth’s surface. The GEO
track breaks out at the point of coordinates φ = 0 and λ = const.
Furthermore, considering geographic latitude (φM) and longitude (λM) of the
point (M) on the Earth’s surface presented in Fig. 2.3b, what can be the position of
the MES, taking into consideration the arc (MP) of the angle illustrated in Fig. 2.3a,
the central angle can be calculated by the following relations:
cos W ¼ cos uS cos D k cos uM þ sin uS sin uM or
cos W ¼ cos arc MP ¼ cos uM cos D k
ð2:40Þ
The transition calculations from geographic to spherical coordinates and vice
versa can be computed with the following equations:
cos W ¼ cos u cos D k and tg A ¼ sin D= ktg u; respectively
sin u ¼ sin W cos A and tg D k ¼ tg W sin A
ð2:41Þ
These relations are useful for any point or area of coverage on the Earth’s
surface, then for a center of the area if it exists, as well as for spot beam and global
area coverage for MSC systems. The optimum number of GEO satellites for global
coverage can be determined by:
n ¼ 180o=W
ð2:42Þ
For instance, if δ = 0 and Ψ = 81°, it will be necessary to put into orbit only 3
GEO, and to get a global coverage from 75° N to 75° S geographic latitude. Hence,
in a similar way the number of satellites can be calculated for other types of satellite
orbits.
The trajectory of radio waves on a link between an MES and a satellite at
distance (d) and the velocity of light (c = 3 × 108 m/s) requires a propagation time
equal to:
T ¼ d=c ðsÞ
ð2:43Þ
The phenomenon of apparent change in frequency of signal waves at the receiver
when the signal source moves with respect to the receivers (Earth) was explained
and quantiﬁed by Johann Doppler (1803–53). The frequency of the satellite
transmission received on the ground increases as the satellite is approaching the
ground observer and reduces as the satellite is moving away. This change in fre-
quency is called Doppler effect or shift, which occurs on both the uplink and the
downlink. This effect is quite pronounced for LEO and compensating for it requires
102

frequency tracking in a narrowband receiver, while its effects are negligible for
GEO satellites. The Doppler shift at a transmitting frequency (f) and radial velocity
(vr) between the ground observer and the transmitter can be calculated by the
following relation:
DfD ¼ f vr=c where vr ¼ dR=dt
ð2:44Þ
For an elliptical orbit, assuming that R = r, the radial velocity is given by:
vr ¼ dr=dt ¼ ðdr=hÞðdh=dtÞ
ð2:45Þ
The sign of the Doppler shift is positive when the satellite is approaching the
observer and vice versa. Doppler effect can also be used to estimate the position of
an observer provided that the orbital parameters of the satellite are precisely known.
This is very important for the development of Doppler satellite tracking and
determination systems.
2.2
Spacecraft Launching and Station-Keeping
Techniques
The launch of the satellite and the controlling support services are a very critical
point in the creation of space communications and the most expensive phase of the
total system cost. At the same time, the need to make a satellite body capable of
surviving the stresses of the launch stages is a major element in their design phase.
Satellites are also designed to be compatible with more than one model of launch
vehicle and launching type.
In a more determined sense, there are multistage expendable and, manned or
unmanned, reusable launchers. Owing to location and type of site, there are
land-based and sea-based launch systems. Additional rocket motors, such as perigee
and apogee kick propulsion systems, may also be required.
The process of launching a satellite is based mostly on launching into an
equatorial circular orbit and after in GEO, but similar processes or phases are used
for all types of orbits. The processes involved in the launching technique depend on
the type of satellite launcher, the geographical position of the launching site, and
constraints associated with the payload. In order to successfully put the satellite into
the transfer and drift orbit, the launcher must operate with great precision with
regard to the magnitude and orientation of the velocity vector. On the other hand,
launching operations necessitate either TT&T facilities at the launching base or at
the stations distributed along the trajectory.
2.1
Platforms and Orbital Mechanics

2.2.1
Satellite Installation and Launching Operations
Satellites are usually designed to be compatible with more than one prototype of
launchers. Launching, putting, and controlling satellites into orbit are very expen-
sive operations, so the expenses of launcher and support services can exceed the
cost of the satellites themselves. The basic principle of any launch vehicle is that the
rocket is propelled by reaction to the momentum of hot gas ejected through exhaust
nozzles.
Thus, for a spacecraft to achieve synchronous orbit, it must be accelerated to a
velocity of 3070 m/s in a zero-inclination orbit and raised a distance of 42,242 km
from the center of the Earth. Most rocket engines use the oxygen in the atmosphere
to burn their fuel but solid or liquid propellant for a launcher in space must com-
prise both a fuel and an oxygen agent. There are two techniques for launching a
satellite, namely by direct ascent and by Hohmann transfer ellipse.
2.2.1.1
Direct Ascent Launching
A satellite may be launched into a circular orbit by using the direct ascent method,
shown in Fig. 2.7a. The thrust of the launch vehicle is used to place the satellite in a
trajectory, the turning point of which is marginally above the altitude of the desired
orbit. The initial sequence of the ascent trajectory is the boost phase, which is
powered by the various stages of the launch vehicle. This is followed by a coasting
phase along the ballistic trajectory, the spacecraft at this point consisting of the last
launcher stage and the satellite. As the velocity required to sustain an orbit will not
have been attained at this point, the spacecraft falls back from the highest point of
the ballistic trajectory.
When the satellite and ﬁnal stage have fallen to the desired injection altitude,
having in the meantime converted some of their potential energy into kinetic
energy, the ﬁnal stage of the launcher, called the Apogee Kick Motor (AKM), is
Fig. 2.7 Satellite installation in circular and synchronous orbit—Courtesy of Book: by Pascall
104

Space Segment

activated to provide the necessary velocity increase for injection into the chosen
circular orbit. In effect, the AKM is often incorporated into the satellite itself, where
other thrusters are also installed for adjusting the orbit or the altitude of the satellite
throughout its operating lifetime in space. The typical launch vehicles for direct
ascent satellite launching are US-based Titan IV, Russian-based Proton, and
Ukrainian-based Zenit.
2.2.1.2
Indirect Ascent Launching
A satellite may be launched into an elliptical or synchronous orbit by using the
successive or indirect ascent sequences, known as the Hohmann transfer ellipse
method, illustrated in Fig. 2.7b. The Hohmann transfer ellipse method enables a
satellite to be placed in an orbit at the desired altitude using the trajectory that
requires the least energy. At the ﬁrst sequence, the launch vehicle propels the
satellite into a low parking orbit by the direct ascent method. The satellite is then
injected into an elliptical transfer orbit, the apogee of which is the altitude of the
desired circular synchronous orbit. At the apogee, additional thrust is applied by an
AKM to provide the velocity increment necessary for the attainment of the required
synchronous orbit. In practice, it is usual for the direct ascent method to be used to
inject a satellite into a LEO and for the Hohmann transfer ellipse to be used for
higher types of satellite orbits.
2.2.2
Satellite Launchers and Launching Systems
Two major types of launch vehicles can be used to put a satellite into LEO, HEO,
and GEO constellation: Expendable and Reusable Vehicles. There are also two
principal locations or site-based types of launching centers: Land-based and
Sea-based launch systems.
2.2.2.1
Expendable Launching Vehicles
The great majority of communications satellites have been launched by expendable
vehicles and this is likely to continue to be the case for many years to come. There
are two types of these vehicles: expendable three-stage vehicles and expendable
direct-injection vehicles.
1. Expendable Three-Stage Vehicles—Typical series of three-stage vehicles
are Delta and Atlas (USA), Ariane (Europe), Long March (China), and H-II (Japan).
In addition, a new generation of launchers has already been developed with two
stages such as Delta III and Ariane 5. Both stages are propellant systems using
cryogenic liquid fuel, while the ﬁrst stage is assisted by nine strap-on solid-fuel
motors.
2.2
Spacecraft Launching and Station-Keeping Techniques
105

The ﬁrst and second stages of three-stage expandable launch vehicles are usually
designed to lift it clear of the Earth’s atmosphere, to accelerate horizontally to a
velocity of about 8000 m/s and enter a parking orbit at a height of about 200 km.
The plane of the parking orbit will be inclined to the equator at an angle not less than
the latitude of the launch site. The most efﬁcient way of getting from the parking
orbit to a circular equatorial orbit is to convert the parking orbit into an elliptical orbit
in the same plane, with the perigee at the height of the parking orbit and the apogee at
about 36,000 km and then to convert the transfer ellipse to the GEO.
Thus, the third stage is ﬁred as the satellite crosses the equator, which ensures
that the apogee of the Geostationary Transfer Orbit (GTO) is in the equatorial plane.
When the satellite is placed in the GTO, the third stage has completed its mission
and is jettisoned. The ﬁnal phase of the Hohmann transfer three-stage launch
sequence is carried out by means of AKM built into the satellite. The propulsion of
this motor is required to provide at the apogee of the GTO a velocity increment of
such a magnitude and in such a direction as to reduce the orbit to zero and make the
orbit circular. Once the satellite is in the GEO trajectory, the attitude is corrected,
the antennas and solar panels are deployed and the satellite is drifted to the correct
longitude (apogee position) for operation.
2. Expendable Direct-Injection Vehicles—Typical models of direct-injection
launchers are the USA-based Titan IV and the Russian-based Proton, illustrated in
Fig. 2.8 (a—Left) and (a—Right), respectively, and also Zenit (Ukraine).
Otherwise, these types of vehicles do not need an AKM because direct-injection

launchers have a fourth stage, which converts directly from GTO to GEO con-
stellation. The Proton rocket is one of the most capable and reliable heavy lift
launch vehicles in operation today. Proton D-1 and D-1-E launcher variants have
three and four stages, respectively. At liftoff, the total weight of Proton is about 688
tons and this vehicle has the capability of placing a maximum of 4,500 and
2,600 kg into GTO and GEO, respectively.
2.2.2.2
Reusable Launch Vehicles
Reusable launch vehicles have already been developed in the USA (Space Shuttle)
and former USSR (Energia/Buran), which have as their aim the development of
vehicles that could journey into space and return, all or much of their structure
being reusable, and thus, the satellite launching will cost less. Moreover, in using
these launchers there will be less burnt-out upper stages than with expendable
vehicles. What remains in space, the small pieces in transfer orbits for many years
and much small debris, remains in LEO for a long time, adding to the growing
space junk hazard for operational satellites and future space operations. There are
other projects for the development of similar vehicles such as a small manned
reusable Space Shuttle called Hermes (Europe) and Hope (Japan), unmanned space
plane Hotol in UK is proposed, while in Germany and the USA two similar vehicles
are projected: TAV (Trans Atmospheric Vehicle) and Sanger Space plane,
respectively. Thus, in the development of these small vehicles, it is important to
realize whether any of them could carry sufﬁcient weight and be able to put
communications satellites into the desired orbits.
1. Space Shuttle—The US-based NASA developed a ﬂeet of manned reusable
vehicles of Space Transportation System (STS) called Space Shuttle, which are
capable of lifting a satellite of up to 29.5 tons into a parking orbit, inclined at 28.5°,
with an altitude of up to 431 km, shown in Fig. 2.8 (b—Left). A Shuttle has three
main elements: (1) the orbiter for carrying the satellite and crew; (2) a very large
external tank containing propellant for the main engine of the orbiter; and (3) two
solid-propellant boosters. The reusable Space Shuttle plane is 37.2 m long, the
fuselage is 4.5 m in diameter, the wingspan is 23.8 m, and the mass is about 84.8
tons. This STS is designed to accommodate in total 7 crewmembers and passengers
on board plane. The system came into service in 1981 and made over twenty
successful operational ﬂights until January 1986, when the Shuttle Challenger was
destroyed by a fault in the solid-propellant booster and all the crew were killed in a
tragic accident. Following this disaster, NASA redesigned the booster but decided
to use STS only for regular launch program of government and scientiﬁc vehicles.
2. Energia/Buran Space plane—The launcher Energia is the most powerful
operational reusable vehicle in the world, capable of carrying about 100 tons into
space, whose four ﬁrst-stage booster units are recoverable for reuse. In particular, it
can launch the Buran space plane, enabling it to acquire a LEO and to land with the
aid of its own rocket engine, shown in Fig. 2.8 (b—Right). The main purpose for
which those very heavy lift vehicles were developed was to ferry personnel and
2.2
Spacecraft Launching and Station-Keeping Techniques
107

supplies for the Russian space station Mir and also to retrieve or repair satellites
already in orbit.
The Energia vehicle can also carry into space a side-mounted canister containing
an upper stage and a payload compartment suitable, for example, for a large heavy
spacecraft or group of communications satellites to be placed in orbit. Energia ﬂew
for the ﬁrst time on May 15, 1987, carrying a spacecraft mock-up and later on
November 18, 1988, carrying an unmanned version of Buran space plane. The
reusable Buran space plane is 36.3 m long, the fuselage is 5.6 m in diameter, the
wingspan is 24 m, and the mass is about 100 tons. It can be ﬂown in automatic
conﬁguration or under the control of a pilot to place satellites in LEO or to retrieve
them and come back to base for the next use. Up to ten people, crew and pas-
sengers, can be accommodated and it can carry in the cargo bay up to 30 tons into
an orbit of 200 km altitude and 51.6° inclination. In fact, this plane enables large
satellites to be put into orbit and construction of space stations to be considered for
both for telecommunication purposes and for scientiﬁc missions.
The Energia Launch Vehicle was also the successor to the N-1 Moon Rockets,
except that Buran was also used to launch Polyus from Baikonur Cosmodrome in
Kazakhstan (former Soviet Union). Energia was 60 m high and 18 m in diameter,
consisting of a central core and four strap-on boosters, while the core was 58.1 m high
and 7.7 m diameter. It used 4 RD-0120 rocket engines. The propellants were liquid
hydrogen and oxygen. The strap-on boosters were then 38.3 m high and 3.9 m in
diameter, with a single four-chamber RD-170 kerosene/liquid oxygen rocket engine.
In 1992, the Russian Space Agency (Roscosmos) decided to terminate the
Energia/Buran Program due to Russia’s economic difﬁculties after disintegration of
former Soviet Union. At that stage, the second Orbiter had been assembled and
assembly of the third Orbiter with improved performance was nearing completion.
Although the Energia project has been abandoned, it may return to service if a
market is found, or adequate partners. Consideration is being given in Russia to the
development of a more compact winged space plane designed to ferry personnel
and their luggage into space, such as new developed space plane Kliper by NPO
Energia, see Fig. 2.9. This compact shuttlecraft could be placed atop of a Proton,
Soyuz, Angara or any other launchers.
2.2.2.3
Land-Based Launching Systems
Most satellite launches have taken place from the following launch facilities:
1. US-Based Launch Centers—The USA launches satellites from two main
locations, in Florida Cape Canaveral, suitable for direct equatorial orbit, and the
Vandenberg Air Force Base in California, suitable for polar orbit missions.
2. Russian Launch Centers—Russian satellites are launched from two main
launch centers named Baikonur and Northern Cosmodrome. Baikonur lies north
of Tyuratam in Kazakhstan, with the all launching support infrastructure for
launching Proton and Energia heavy launchers. The Northern Cosmodrome is
108

Space Segment

located near Plesetsk, south of the town Archangelsk, suitable for launching
satellites for all purposes in high-inclination orbits. This Cosmodrome is the
world’s busiest launch site.
3. European Launch Centers—The main European launch Cosmodrome is the
Guiana Space Center in French Guiana, using Ariane vehicles. The position of
this Cosmodrome enables the best advantage to be taken of the Earth’s rotation
for direct equatorial orbit.
4. Chinese Launch Centers—The principal launch sites in China are Jiuquan and
Xi Chang, for launching Long March vehicles. In the meantime, the Xi Chang
launch center has also become most used for launches into the GEO for the
international market.
5. Japanese Launch Centers—The Japan’s Tanegashima Space Center is situated
in the prefecture of Kagashima. The facilities include the Takesaki Range for
small rockets and the Osaki Range was used for the launch of H-I vehicles until
the termination of program in 1992. After renovation, the Osaki Range will be
used as the launching for the next generation of J-I Japanese vehicles. The new
Yoshinobu launch complex has been constructed next to the Osaki center to
satisfy the requirements of the new H-II launcher.
2.2.2.4
Sea-Based Launch Systems
The Sea Launch Multinational Organization was developed in March 1996 to
overcome the cost of land-based launch infrastructure duplication around the world.
The newly formed Sea Launch system is owned by the Sea Launch Partnership

system. Each partner is also a supplier to the venture, capitalizing on the strengths
of these industry leaders. The system consists of two main modules: Assembly
(Command and Control Ship) and Launch Platform, both illustrated in Fig. 2.10a,
b, respectively. However, transit for the ACV and the LP from Home Port in Long
Beach to the launch site on the equator takes 10–12 days, based on a speed of 10.1
knots.
The Sea Launch Home Port complex is located in Long Beach, California. The
Home Port site provides the facilities, equipment, supplies, personnel, and other
procedures necessary to receive, transport, process, test, and integrate the spacecraft
and its associated support equipment with the Sea Launch system. The Home Port
also serves as the marine base of operations for both of the Sea Launch vessels. The
personnel providing the day-to-day support and service during prelaunch process-
ing and launch conduct to Sea Launch and its customers are located at the Home
Port. The ACV performs four important functions for Sea Launch operations: (1) It
serves as the facility for assembly, processing, and checkout of the launch vehicle;
(2) it houses the Launch Control Center (LCC), which monitors and controls all
operations at the launch site; (3) it acts as the base for tracking the initial ascent of
the launch vehicle; and (4) it provides accommodation for the marine and launch
crews during transit to and from the launch site. Therefore, the ACV is designed
and constructed speciﬁcally to suit the unique requirements of Sea Launch. The
ship’s overall dimensions are nearly 200 m in length, 32 m in beam, and a dis-
placement of 34,000 tons.
Major features of the ACV include: a rocket assembly compartment; the LCC
with viewing room; helicopter capability; customer work areas; spacecraft con-
tractor; and customer accommodation. The rocket assembly compartment, which is
located on the main deck of the ACV, hosts the ﬁnal assembly and processing of the
launch vehicle. This activity is conducted while the vessels are at the Home Port
and typically in parallel with spacecraft processing. The bow of the main deck is
dedicated to processing and fueling the Block DM-SL of the Zenit launch vehicle.
After the completion of spacecraft processing and encapsulation, the encapsulated
payload is transferred into the rocket assembly compartment, where it is integrated
with the Zenit-2S and Block DM. The launchers and the satellite are assembled
horizontally in the ACV before sailing from the port of Long Beach to the desig-
nated launch site. A launcher with a payload will then be transferred in the hori-
zontal position to the launch pad on LP and raised to a vertical position for fueling
and launching.
During the launch sequence, the crew of the LP will be transferred to the ACV,
which will initiate and control the launch from a position about 3 miles away from
the LP pad. The LP is an extremely stable sea platform from which to conduct the
launch, control, and other operations. The LP rides catamaran-style on a pair of
large pontoons and is self-propelled by a four-screw propulsion system (two in each
lower hull, aft), which is powered by four direct-current double armature-type
motors, each of which are rated at 3000 hp. The LP in navigation has normal draft
at sea water level but once at the launch location, the pontoons are submerged to a
depth of 22.5 m to achieve a very stable launch position, level to within
2.2
Spacecraft Launching and Station-Keeping Techniques
111

approximately 1°. The ballast tanks are located in the pontoons and in the lower part
of the columns. Six ballast pumps, three in each pontoon, serve them. The LP has
an overall length of approximately 133 m at the pontoons and the launch deck is 78
by 66.8 m. The Zenit-3SL launcher is a two-stage liquid propellant launch vehicle
solution capable of transporting a spacecraft to a variety of orbits.
The original two-stage Zenit was designed by KB Yuzhnoye quickly to recon-
stitute former Soviet military satellite constellations. The design emphasizes robust-
ness, ease of operation, and fast reaction times. The result is a highly automated launch
capability using a minimum complement of launch personnel. The launcher as an
integrated part of the Sea Launch system is designed to place spacecraft into a variety
of orbits and is capable of putting 5250 kg of payload into GEO.
The Sea Launch mission provides a number of technical support systems that are
available for the customer’s use in support of the launch process, including most
importantly the following:
1. Communications—Internal communication systems are distributed between
the ACV and LP. This system includes CCTV, telephones, intercom, video tele-
conferencing, public address, and vessel-to-vessel radiocommunications, known as
the line-of-sight (LOS) direct system.
This system links with the external communication system and provides a
worldwide network that interconnects the various segments of the Sea Launch
program. The external communication system includes Intelsat and two ground
stations. The LES are located in Brewster, Washington, and Eik, Norway, and
provide the primary distribution gateways to the other communication nodes.
Customers can connect to the Sea Launch communication network through the
convenient Brewster site. The Intelsat system ties in with the ACV and launch
platform PABX systems to provide telephone connectivity. Additionally, critical
Voice, Fax, Tlx, or data capability can be ensured by the Inmarsat satellite SES
service.
2. Tracking and Data-Relay Satellite System (TDRSS)—The Sea Launch
system uses a unique dual telemetry stream with the TDRSS. Telemetry is simul-
taneously received from the Zenit stages, the Block DM upper stage, and the
payload unit during certain portions of the ﬂight. The Block DM upper stage and
payload unit data are combined but the Zenit data are sent to a separate TDRSS
receiver. Zenit data are received shortly after liftoff at approximately 9 s and
continue until Zenit Stage 2/Block DM separation, at around 9 min. These data are
routed from the NASA White Sands LES to the Sea Launch Brewster LES and to
the ACV. Otherwise, the data are also recorded at White Sands and Brewster for
later playback to the KB Yuzhnoye design center.
When the payload fairing separates, the payload unit transmitter shifts from
sending high-rate payload accommodation data by LOS to sending combined
payload unit/Block DM by TDRSS. The combined data are again routed from
White Sands to Brewster, where it is separated into Block DM and payload unit
data and then sent on to the ACV. The data are received on board the ship through
the Intelsat communications terminal and are routed to Room 15 for upper-stage
data and Room 94 for PLU data. Simultaneously, Brewster routes Block DM data
112
2
Space Segment

to the Energia Moscow control center station. However, the TDRSS coverage
continues until after playback of the recorded Block DM data.
3. Telemetry System—Sea Launch uses LOS telemetry systems for the initial
ﬂight phase, as well as the TDRSS for later phases. The LOS system, which
includes the Proton antenna and the S-band system, is located on the ACV. Other
telemetry assets include Russian ground tracking stations and the Energia Moscow
control center. The following subsections apply to launch vehicle and payload unit
telemetry reception and routing.
4. Weather (WX) Data System and Forecast—The ACV unit has a
self-contained WX station, which includes a motion-stabilized C-band Doppler
radar equipment, surface wind instruments, wave radar, upper-atmospheric balloon
release station, ambient condition sensors, and access to satellite imagery and
information from an on-site buoy.
2.3
Types of Orbits for Mobile and Other Satellite
Systems
An orbit is the circular or elliptical path that the satellite traverses through space.
This path appears in the chosen orbital plane in the same or different angle to the
equatorial plane. All communications satellites always remain near the Earth and
keep going around the same orbit, directed by centrifugal and centripetal forces.
Each orbit has certain advantages in terms of launching (getting satellite into
position), station keeping (keeping the satellite in place), roaming (providing ade-
quate coverage), and maintaining necessary quality of communication services,
such as continuous availability, reliability, power requirements, time delay, prop-
agation loss, and network stability.
There is a large range of satellite orbits but not all of them are useful for ﬁxed
and Mobile Satellite Communications systems. In general, the one of most com-
monly used orbits for satellite communications is GEO constellations, after which
HEO and latterly GIO, PEO, LEO, and MEO, shown in Fig. 2.11a.
Otherwise, it is essential to consider that satellites can serve all communication,
navigation, meteorological, and observation systems for which they cannot have an
attribute such as ﬁxed or mobile satellites and the only common difference is which
type of payload or transponder they carry on board. For example, its name can be
satellite-speciﬁed for ﬁxed communications but in effect it can carry major
transponders for ﬁxed communications and others for mobile or other purposes and
vice versa.
After many years of research and experiments spent on ﬁnding the global
standardization for spatial communications, satellites remained the only means of
providing near-global coverage, even in those parts which other communications
systems are not able to reach. There is always doubt about the best orbital
2.2

constellation that can realize an appropriate global coverage and a reliable com-
munications solution.
Unfortunately, there is no perfect system today; all systems have some advan-
tages or disadvantages. The best conclusion is to abridge the story and to say brieﬂy
that today the GEO system is the best solution and has only congestion as a more
serious problem. The extensive use of GEO shows that it provides something good.
Inmarsat is the biggest GEO operator whose service and revenue conﬁrm this point
of view. The advantages of Inmarsat MSC solutions can be realized if someone uses
them such as operators on board mobiles and ﬁnds out how powerful they are. Most
of other regional GEO worldwide networks, such as ACeS, Optus and Thuraya, are
also more successful than other non-GEO constellations.
In particular, Big LEO and ICO systems or hybrid constellations such as Ellipso
have had several years of serious economical and concept difﬁculties. It is sufﬁcient
to see Table 2.3 to understand that the major reasons for LEO problems are more
satellite cost, complex network, and short satellite visibility and lifetime. The
LEO/PEO constellations are the same or similar and because of differences in
inclination angle of orbital plane and type of coverage, they will be considered
separately.
The track of the satellite varies from 0 to 360°, see Fig. 2.11b. The track of the
GEO satellite is at a point in the center of the coordinate system; two tracks are

apparent movements of the GIO satellite with respect to the ascending node of both
30° and 60° inclination angles and the last is the track of the PEO satellite with an
inclined orbit plane to the equator of 90°. The tracks of HEO Molniya (part of the
track) and Tundra (complete track) orbits are shown in Fig. 2.11 (c-1/c-2),
respectively. These two tracks pass over the African Continent and almost all of
Europe.
This is very important for MSC systems that the orbit used can provide satellite
view during 24 h with less handovers and network difﬁculties. However, for other
types of broadcasting a communications satellite must be visible from the region
concerned during the periods when it is desired to provide a communication ser-
vice, which can vary from a few hours to 24 h a day. When the service is not
continuous, it is desirable that the intervals during which the service is available
repeat each day at the same time.
2.3.1
Low Earth Orbits (LEO)
The LEO systems are either elliptical or more usually circular satellite orbits
between 500 and 2000 km above the surface of the Earth and below the Inner Van
Allen Belt. The orbit period at these altitudes varies between ninety minutes and

two hours. The radius of the footprint of a communications satellite in LEO varies
from 3000 to 4000 km.
Therefore, the maximum time during which a satellite in LEO orbit is above the
local horizon for an observer on the Earth is up to 20 min. Earth is up to 20
minutes, which is shown in Fig. 2.11a. In this case, the trafﬁc to a LEO satellite has
to be handed over much more frequently than all other types of orbit. At this point,
when a satellite, which is serving a particular user, moves below the local horizon,
it needs to be able to quickly handover the service to a succeeding one in the same
or adjacent orbit.
Due to the relatively large movement of a satellite in LEO constellation with
respect to an observer on the Earth, satellite systems using this type of orbit need to
be able to cope with large Doppler shifts. In fact, satellites in LEO are not affected
at all by radiation damage but are affected by atmospheric drag, which causes the
orbit to gradually deteriorate. Satellites in LEO and MEO constellations are sub-
jected to orbital perturbation. For very LEO satellites, the aerodynamic drag is
likely to be signiﬁcant and in general, some of the other perturbations, such as
precession of the argument of the perigee, resolve to zero in the orbit is circular or
polar. On the other hand, a perturbation is unlikely to have a serious effect on the
operation of a multisatellite constellation since it will usually affect all satellites of
the conﬁguration in equal measure.
The major advantages of LEO are as follows:
(a) The LEO system may become important in the ﬁeld of MSC using handheld
terminals with global roaming and to be exceedingly useful in areas not
covered by cellular systems. The LEO constellations cover almost the entire
Earth’s surface and some of them provide polar coverage and show promise in
the ﬁelds of mobile data and Internet and FSS networks for broadband data
transmission and communications.
(b) High Doppler shift allows the LEO system to be used for satellite positioning,
tracking, and determination.
(c) The relatively small distance between LES and LEO results in much lower
power and smaller user terminals. Furthermore, the one-way speed-of-light
propagation delay of at least 0.25 s using GEO is obviated with LEO, in which
effect can be annoying in two-way voice transmission. For example, for
two-way voice via a satellite at an altitude of about 1000 km, the delay is only
13 ms in total for uplink and downlink.
(d) Satellite path diversity eliminates signal interruption due to path obstruction.
In Fig. 2.12, handover from satellite A to satellite B is demonstrated, as well
as path diversity between satellites B and C. This ﬁgure illustrates the
LEO MSS space and ground architecture with utilization of handheld personal
terminals (PES). On the other hand, the Satellite Access Node (SAN) is the
LES providing a link between PES terminals through satellites and ground
telecommunications infrastructures.
116

Space Segment

The disadvantages of LEO are as follows:
(a) The orbit period at about 1000 km altitude is in the order of approximately
100 min and the visibility at a point on the Earth is only some 10 min,
requiring 40–80 satellites in six to seven planes for global coverage. Thus, in
reality a GMSC system using this type of orbit requires a large number of
satellites, in a number of different inclined orbits, which increases the total cost
of the network.
(b) Frequently handover is necessary for uninterrupted communications. Satellite
visibility for MES could be improved by using more satellites. In such a way,
the optimum number of satellites of about 48 inclined in the constellation in a
carefully optimized pattern of orbit planes will provide continuous visibility of
one or other of the satellites at any location on Earth surface.
(c) During times of the year that the orbital plane is in the direction of the Sun, a
satellite in LEO is eclipsed for almost one-third of the orbit period.
Consequently, there is a signiﬁcant demand on battery power, with up to 5000
charge/discharge cycles per year, which, with existing NiCd types of batteries,
reduces satellite lifetimes to 3–7 years.
(d) The launch cost is low, with direct injection into the orbit of several satellites,
but the total cost is very high, with a minimum of 40 satellites being produced.
The ﬁrst-generation LEO satellites were used for military communications
because single GEO could be an easy target for an opponent. The large number of
LEO satellites will reduce enormously the risk of vulnerability if someone wishes to
destroy only one satellite.

Types of Orbits for Mobile and Other Satellite Systems
117

Because this orbit conﬁguration is in the initial phase of its exploitation, it is still
free of congestion problems. There are two types of LEO constellations known as
Little LEO, useful for messaging and satellite tracking systems and Big LEO,
suitable for voice, video, and data communications.
2.3.1.1
Little LEO
The Little LEO mobile satellite systems are a category of LEO solutions that utilize
birds of small size and low mass for low-bit-rate transmission under 1 Kb/s. Thus,
the Little LEO systems are the constellations of very small non-GEO satellites,
which operate in LEO orbits, providing mainly mobile data messaging and tracking
services for vehicles and ships and other FSS and broadcasting services. The FCC
has allocated a frequency band of 137–138 MHz for the downlink and 148–
149.9 MHz for the uplink to Little LEO systems.
The Little LEO satellite frequency spectrum is a heavily utilized for different
private and government services worldwide, such as Orbcomm, Falsat, VITASat,
Starnet, and other systems. The mass of satellites in these solutions ranges from
40 kg in Orbcomm to 150 kg in the Starnet system. These systems prefer a spec-
trum below 1 GHz, because it enables the use of cost-effective equipment for
non-voice two-way messaging and positioning satellite transceiver, which would be
equipped with an alphanumerical display.
2.3.1.2
Big LEO
The Big LEO is a larger non-GEO satellite system, which operates in LEO con-
stellations and provides mainly mobile telephony, Fax, data, and RDSS services.
Compared to the Little LEO systems, satellites in Big LEO systems are expected to
be bigger in body and to have more power and bandwidth to provide a different
service to their subscribers. This system will use the underutilized spectrum
available in the L-band because of the commercial failure of proposed RDSS
service. Currently, the frequency spectrum of 1610–1626.5 MHz for uplinks and
2483.5–2500 MHz for downlinks is assigned to these MSC systems. It is inter-
esting to note that although the names of these systems include LEO, their fre-
quencies are the ones usually utilized in MEO and GEO satellite systems. For this
reason, a new ICO system is systematized in the category of Big LEO constellations
together with real Big LEO systems, such as Iridium and Globalstar, which are
located at a lower altitude than ICO, at about 700–1500 km from the Earth’s
surface. Thus, all of the new proposed Big LEO systems would offer global
handheld telephone service by means of satellites on lower altitudes moving very
fast, instead of ﬁxed GEO relays. The bigger size of the satellites enables them to
carry a transponder on board with more complex data processing facilities than the
simple store-and-forward feature of the Little LEO satellite conﬁguration. Hence, an
118
2
Space Segment

important fact is that these systems are networking with cellular and spreading their
roaming and billing capabilities in real global coverage.
2.3.2
Circular Orbits
The GEO satellite constellation has great advantages for MSS communication
applications where polar coverage is not required but there are solutions for pro-
viding polar roaming. Satellite orbits in 63.4° inclined high-apogee HEO have some
advantages from GEO also providing polar coverage. The most popular circular
equatorial orbit with zero inclination is the GEO satellite constellation. The period
of rotation is equal to that of the Earth and has the same direction. However, both of
these satellite orbits exhibit high LOS loss and long transmission times and delays.
Using new technology, these problems can be solved, or as an alternative to these
orbits there are LEO and MEO constellations with their good and bad character-
istics. The choice of orbit depends on the nature of the MSC mission, the acceptable
interference in an adequate environment and the performance of the launchers.
2.3.2.1
Medium Earth Orbits (MEO)
The MEO satellite constellations, known also as Intermediate Circular Orbits (ICO),
are circular orbits located at an altitude of around 10,000–20,0000 km between the
Van Allen Belts. The MEO satellites are operated in a similar way to Big LEO systems
providing global coverage, which orbit is shown in Fig. 2.11a.
However, compared to a LEO system a MEO constellation can only be in
circular orbit; Doppler effect and handover is less frequent; propagation delay is
about 70 ms and free-space loss is greater; satellites are affected by radiation
damages from the Inner Van Allen Belt only during the launching period; fewer
eclipse cycles means that battery lifetime will be more than 7 years; cosmic radi-
ation is lower, with subsequently longer life expectancy for the complete MEO
conﬁguration; higher average elevation angle from users to satellite minimizes
probability of LOS blockage and higher RF output power required for both indoor
and handheld terminals.
A LEO constellation for MSS global coverage requires around 10 satellites in
two or three orbital planes, each plane inclining 45° to the equator. Their orbit
period measures about 6–8 h, providing slightly over 1 h local visibility above the
horizon for an observer on the Earth and handover from one to the next satellite is
every 6 h minimum.
There is in exploitation a special model of MEO constellation known in practice
as Highly Inclined Orbit. This particular orbit is of interest because it has been
chosen for existing and proposed GNSS systems such as Navstar (GPS), Navsat,
GLONASS, and the newly developed Galileo. In all, complete implementation of
this orbit conﬁguration would have 24 satellites in 3 orbital planes equidistant from
2.3
Types of Orbits for Mobile and Other Satellite Systems
119

each other, at an altitude of 20,000 km and at an inclination of 55°. In comparison
with existing GNSS, the new Galileo system will have 30 satellites in high MEO of
about 28,000 km and at a similar inclination of 56°. At this point, its interest to
polar MSC would be the eventual prospect of satellite sharing with navigation
services, in a similar fashion to a high PEO with minimum of 3 satellites in the
same orbital plane.
2.3.2.2
Geostationary Earth Orbits (GEO)
A GEO has a circular orbit in the equatorial plane, with an orbital period equal to
the rotation of the Earth of 1 sidereal day, which is achieved with an orbital radius
of 66,107 (Equatorial) Earth Radii, or an orbital height of 35,786 km. Otherwise, a
satellite in a GEO will appear ﬁxed above the surface of the Earth and remain in a
stationary position relative to the Earth itself. Theoretically, this orbit is with zero
inclination and track as a point but in practice, the orbit has small nonzero values
for inclination and eccentricity, causing the satellite to trace out a small ﬁgure eight
in the sky, which is shown in Fig. 2.11a.
The footprint or service area of a GEO satellite covers almost one-third of the
Earth’s surface or 120° in longitude direction and up to 75°–78° latitude North and
South of the Equator but cannot cover the polar regions. In this way, near-global
coverage can be achieved with a minimum of three satellites in orbit moved apart
by 120°, although the best solution is to employ four GEO satellites for better
overlapping. This type of orbit is essentially used for commercial communication
services for both FSS and MSS with the following advantages:
(a) The satellite remains stationary with respect to one point on the Earth’s surface
and so the LES antennas can be beamed exactly toward the focus of the GEO
satellite without periodical tracking. Only mobile high-gain antennas need
auto-tracking systems, while low-gain omnidirectional antennas are free of
tracking systems.
(b) The new Inmarsat GEO space constellation consisting of four satellites can
cover all three-ocean regions with four overlapping longitudes, except for the
polar regions beyond latitudes of 75° North and South. Otherwise, the polar
regions can be covered for maritime and aeronautical MSS applications with
current HF radio systems or in combination with PEO or HEO satellite
constellations.
(c) The Doppler shift, affecting synchronous digital systems caused by satellites to
drift in orbit (affected by the gravitation of the Moon and to a lesser extent of
the Sun), is small for all LES and MES within satellite coverage.
The disadvantages of GEO compared with LEO and MEO operation are as
follows:
(a) The long signal delay is due to the large distance of about 35,800 km if the
satellite is in zenith for MES and about 41,000 km at the minimum elevation
120
2
Space Segment

angle of about 5°. For the EM waves traveling at the speed of light, this causes
a round-trip signal delay of 240–270 ms and full duplex delay of 480–540 ms.
Thus, the voice used via satellite can experience some disturbance but echo
cancelation devices developed in the 1980s can reduce the problem. Besides,
for data transmission equipment, especially when using error-correction pro-
tocols that require retransmission of blocks with detected errors, complex
circuitry with special high-capacity buffer devices is required to overcome
delay problems. In addition, practical experience has shown that given good
control of the echo, a telephone connection which includes one hop in each
direction via a GEO satellite is acceptable to public users.
(b) The required higher RF output power and the use of directional antennas
aggravate GEO operation slightly for use with handheld terminals, although it
is not critical, because some GEO operators provide this service, such as
Thuraya and ACeS.
(c) The launch procedure to put a satellite in GEO is expensive but the total cost
of 4 satellites is less than the cost of a minimum of 12 or 40 for MEO and
LEO, respectively.
As stated earlier, the major disadvantage of a GEO satellite in a voice trans-
mission is the round-trip delay between satellite and LES of approximately 2.5 s,
which can be successfully solved with current and newly advertised echo cance-
lation circuits. Because of the enormous use of the GEO constellation for many
space applications, some parts of the GEO are becoming congested, owing to only
one radius and latitude. This orbit is geostationary and so its track is one point
called the subsatellite point and obviously, handover and Doppler effect does not
apply to GEO. A GEO satellite is at essentially ﬁxed latitude and longitude, so even
a narrow-beam Earth antenna can remain ﬁxed. Satellites in GEO can use high- and
recently low-gain antennas, which helps to overcome the great distances in
achieving the required Effective Radiated Isotropic Power (EIRP) at ground level.
On the other hand, using satellite spot beam antennas, coverage can be conﬁned to
smaller spot areas, bigger power and higher speed of transmission, such as new
generation of Inmarsat-3 spacecraft. Furthermore, a variety of perturbing forces
causes the GEO satellite to drift out of its path and assigned position toward
so-called inclined orbit (GIO). By far the most important perturbations are the lunar
and at a lesser degree the solar gravitational forces, which cause the satellite to drift
in latitude or North–South direction. The longitudinal drift in East–West direction is
caused by ﬂuctuations in the gravitational forces from the Earth, due to its
non-spherical shape and by ﬂuctuations in solar radiation pressure. To counteract
these perturbations, the spacecraft needs station-keeping devices. The GEO satel-
lites pass through both Van Allen Belts only on launch, so their effect is
insigniﬁcant. After reaching the end of operational life, a satellite has to be removed
from its orbital slots into a graveyard orbit some 200 km above the GEO plane.
Thus, the GEO satellite constellation seems likely to continue to dominate in the
satellite communications world, especially in MSS, providing near-global coverage
with low- and high-power transmission. In particular attractive is the reliable and
2.3

economical use of the Inmarsat standard-C low-power transceiver and low-gain
omnidirectional antenna for maritime, land vehicles and aeronautical two-way
data/messaging and telex and one-way e-mail service.
The major existing GEO mobile systems in the world are Inmarsat and GEOSAT
of the COSPAS–SARSAT system as global solutions and ACeS, AMSC, MSAT,
Artemis, Emsat, Optus, N-Star, Solidaridad, and Thuraya as regional networks.
Some of these systems, such as ACeS and Thuraya, also provide a service for
handheld and mini indoor terminals, which makes it obvious that some authors
made the mistake of assuming that for GEO it is very difﬁcult to provide a handheld
service and that Inmarsat mini-M is the smallest terminal for GEO, as is mentioned

Early in 1995, Pasiﬁk Satelit Nusantara of Indonesia along with Philippine Long
Distance Telephone and Jasmine International Public Co Ltd of Thailand came
together and formed a joint venture for MSS today known as Asia Cellular System
(ACeS). The ACeS handheld dual mode (GSM/ACeS) terminal is manufactured by
Ericsson.
Thuraya is Private Joint Stock Company registered on April 26, 1997, in UAE
under Federal Law No. 8 of 1984 as a Regional GEO Mobile Satellite
Communication System Operator providing voice, low-bit-rate data and facsimile
services. The two prototypes of Thuraya handheld terminals are being manufac-
tured by Hughes Network Systems (USA) and ASCOM (Switzerland).
2.3.2.3
Geosynchronous Inclined Orbits (GIO)
This system would consist in four satellites at six-hour intervals around the Earth
orbit at an inclination of 45° to the equatorial plane, which is shown in Fig. 2.11a.
The satellites provide polar coverage for six hours either side of their most northerly
and southerly movement. Special LES with full-tracking antennas are needed;
therefore, this system in general must be considered complex and expensive for a
polar communication system.
Otherwise, a GIO satellite has a period of orbit equal to or very little different
from a sidereal day (23 h 56 min and 4.1 s), which is time for one complete
revolution of the Earth. The satellite movement speed has only very little difference
from the angular velocity of the Earth, so this movement also has constant angular
velocity. Otherwise, the projection of this movement on the equatorial plane is not
at a constant velocity. There is an apparent movement of the satellite with respect to
the reference meridian on the surface of the Earth and that of the satellite on passing
through the nodes. The orbit may be inclined at any angle, which produces a
repeating ground track. Figure 2.11b presents tracks of 30° and 60° inclined orbits.
The coupled N–S and E–W motion of GIO satellites is shown as a ﬁgure eight
pattern, while the patterns could also be distorted circles. Depending on the incli-
nation angle, the GIO satellite shows points on the equator at various longitudes.

A satellite may operate in this orbit for several reasons. First, it is often desirable
to save the inclination control fuel required for GEO circle. Sometimes there is no
need to control inclination because tracking LES antennas are required for other
reasons, while mobiles such as ships and aircraft require tracking antennas.
Some GEO satellites may last beyond their planned lifetime if run low on fuel and
cease inclination control. In effect, the GIO constellation with nonzero inclination
can be chosen because of easy launching and placing of the satellite into orbit. This
satellite must move with an angular velocity equal to the Earth and be in a prograde
orbit, that is, revolving eastward in the same direction as the Earth rotates.
Otherwise, the only requirements for a GIO constellation are the right period and
direction of rotation.
2.3.3
Highly Elliptical Orbits (HEO)
Using inclined HEO conﬁguration, both polar areas can be effectively covered with
four satellites; two in each polar orbit. The elevation angle to the HEO satellites
remains high for most of the 12-h period of visibility, which is especially required
for continuous Euro-Asian regional coverage providing land MSC service. At this
point, blocking of the beam due to occlusion of the satellite by buildings, moun-
tains, hills, and trees is minimized. Beside, multiple trajectories caused by suc-
cessive reﬂection of various obstacles are also reduced in comparison with systems
operating with low-elevation angles, such as GEO.
The apogee altitude combines polar coverages with nearly synchronous
advantages. Thus, minimum two special LES in both northern and southern polar
regions are required to serve MES terminals. The LES tracking can be reached by a
fairly directive ﬁxed antenna while the satellite is in its slow apogee sector, the
HEO space constellation is namely designed to cover the area under the apogee.
Tracking of the satellite is facilitated on account of the small apparent movement
and the long visibility duration. Otherwise, it is even possible to use antennas
whose 3 dB bandwidth is a few tens of degrees, with ﬁxed pointing toward the
zenith, which permits the complexity and cost of the terminal to be reduced while
retaining a high gain. A satellite in HEO constellation near the apogee can also use
a high-gain antenna to overcome the great distances in achieving the required EIRP
values. The noise captured by the LES antenna, from the ground or due to inter-
ference from other radio systems and atmosphere, is also minimized due to the
high-elevation angles. At any rate, these advantages have led the former USSR to
use these orbits for a long time in order to provide coverage of high-latitude
territories for mobile systems.
The HEO satellite two-way voice transmission has a similar delay as a GEO at
the apogee of about 0.25 s. Therefore, free-space loss and propagation delay for
HEO is comparable to that of the GEO constellation. Compared with GEO, the
launch and satellite cost of the HEO constellation is reasonably low; this constel-
lation is free of congestion because of only a few current and projected new HEO

systems and provides high-elevation angles for LES, which reduces atmospheric
losses. Due to the relatively large movement of a satellite in HEO with respect to an
observer on Earth, satellite systems using this model of orbit need to be able to cope
with large Doppler shifts, 14 kHz for Molniya and 6 kHz for Tundra orbits in
L-band 1.6 GHz. However, as the former USSR’s experience has shown, satellites
in this orbit tend to have rather a short lifetime due to the repetitive crossing of both
Van Allen Belts. The rest of the disadvantages are the necessity of constant satellite
tracking at the MES, compensation of signal loss variation, long eclipse periods,
and complex control system of MES and spacecraft.
The HEO satellite typically has a perigee at about 500 km above the Earth’s
surface and an apogee as high as 50,000 km. The orbits are inclined at 63.4° in
order to provide services to locations at high northern latitudes. The particular
inclination value is selected in order to avoid rotation of the apses, i.e., the inter-
section of a line from the Earth’s center to the apogee, and the Earth’s surface will
always occur at latitude of 63.4°N. Orbit period varies from eight to 24 h. Owing to
the high eccentricity of the orbit, a satellite will spend about two-thirds of the orbital
period near apogee and during that time it appears to be almost stationary for an
observer on Earth (this is referred to as apogee dwell). After this period, a
switchover needs to occur to another satellite in the same orbit in order to avoid loss
of communications. There have to be at least three HEO satellites in orbit, with
trafﬁc being handed over from one to the next every eight hours at a minimum.
When there is an orbit in HEO plane of nonzero inclination, the satellite passes
over the region situated on each side of the equator and will possibly cover the polar
regions if the inclination of the orbit is close to 90°. By orienting the apsidal line,
namely the line between perigee and apogee, in the vicinity of the perpendicular to
the line of nodes (when ω is close to 90° or 270°), the HEO satellite at the apogee
systematically returns above the regions of a given hemisphere. In this way, it is
possible to establish satellite links with LES or MES located at high latitudes.
Although the satellite remains for several hours in the vicinity of the apogee, it does
move with respect to the Earth and after a time dependent on the position of the
MES, the satellite disappears over the horizon as seen from the mobiles. However,
to establish permanent links it is necessary to provide several suitably phased
satellites in similar orbits, which are spaced around the Earth (with different right
ascensions of the ascending node and regularly distributed between 0 and 2π) in
such a way that the satellite moving away from the apogee is replaced (handover)
by another satellite in the same area of the sky as seen from the MES. However, the
problems of satellite acquisition and tracking by the MES are simpliﬁed. Finally,
there only remains the problem of handover and switching the links from one
satellite to other, so the RF link frequencies of the various satellites can be different
in order to avoid interference.
Examples of HEO systems are Molniya, Tundra, Loopus, Borealis of Ellipso
system and Archimedes, which obits are shown in Fig. 2.11a. The ESA proposed
Archimedes system employs a so-called “M-HEO” 8-hour orbit. This produces
three apogees spaced at 120°. Each apogee corresponds to a service area, which
124

could cover a major population centre, for example the whole European continent,
the Far East and North America.
2.3.3.1
Molniya Orbit
The ﬁrst prototype HEO Molniya satellite was launched in 1964 and to date more
than 150 have been deployed, primarily produced by the Applied Mechanics NPO
in Krasnoyarsk, former USSR. The HEO Molniya satellites weigh approximately
1.6 metric tons at launch and stand 4.4 m tall, with a base diameter of 1.4 m.
Electrical energy is provided by 6 windmill-type solar panels, producing up to
1 kW of power. A liquid propellant attitude control and orbital correction conﬁg-
uration maintains satellite stability and performs orbital maneuvers, although the
latter usage is rarely needed. Sun and Earth sensors are used to determine proper
spacecraft attitude and antenna pointing. The ﬁrst Molniya 3 spacecraft appeared in
1974, primarily to support civil communications (domestic and international), with
a slightly enhanced electrical power system and a communications payload of three
6/4 GHz transponders with power outputs of 40/80 W.
The second stratum of the Russian space-based communications system consists
of 16 HEO Molniya-class spacecraft in highly inclined 63° semi-synchronous orbit
planes, which initial perigees between 450 and 600 km ﬁxed deep in the Southern
Hemisphere and apogees near 40,000 km in the Northern Hemisphere. In fact,
Molniya satellites are synchronized with the Earth’s rotation, making two complete
revolutions each day with orbital period of 718 min. The laws of orbital mechanics
dictate that the spacecraft orbital velocity is greatly reduced near apogee, allowing
broad visibility of the Northern Hemisphere for periods up to eight hours at a time.
Thus, by carefully spacing 3 or 4 Molniya spacecraft, continuous communications
can be maintained. This type of orbit was pioneered by the USSR and is particularly
suited to high-latitude regions, which are difﬁcult or impossible to service with
GEO satellites.
The 16 operational Molniya satellites are divided into two types and four distinct
groups. Namely, eight Molniya 1 satellites were divided into two constellations of
four vehicles each. Both constellations consist of four orbital planes spaced 90°
apart, but the ascending node of one constellation is shifted 90° from the other; that
is, the Eastern Hemisphere ascending nodes are approximately 65° and 155°E,
respectively. Although the system was designed to support the Russian Orbita TV
network, a principal function was to service government and military communi-
cations trafﬁc via a single 40 W 1.0/0.8 GHz satellite transponder.
The hypothetical Russian Molniya network can employ minimum 3 HEO satellites
in three 12-h orbits separated by 120° around the Earth, with apogee distance at
39,354 km and perigee at 1000 km. This orbit takes the name from the communi-
cation system installed by the former USSR, whose territories are situated in the
Northern Hemisphere at high latitudes. The orbital period (t) is equal to (tE /2), or
about 12 h. The characteristics of an example Molniya orbit are given in Table 2.4.
2.3
Types of Orbits for Mobile and Other Satellite Systems
125

The only one-track cycles of a total of two satellite tracks on the surface of the
Earth is shown in Fig. 2.11 (c-1) for a perigee argument equal to 270°. The shape of
this track is cycles of one orbit only near Greenwich Meridian, so the center of the
next identical track is around 180° westward. Therefore, the satellite at apogee
passes successively on each orbit above two points separated by 180° in longitude.
The apogee is situated above regions of 63° latitude (the altitude of the vertex is
equal to the value of the inclination and the apogee coincides with the vertex of the
track when the argument of the perigee is equal to 270°). The large ellipticity of the
orbit results in a transit time for the period of the orbit situated in the Northern
Hemisphere greater than that in the Southern Hemisphere. The value of inclination,
which makes the drift of the argument of the perigee equal to zero, is 63.45°.
A value different from this leads to a drift, which is nonzero but remains small for
value of inclination, which does not deviate too greatly from the nominal value. By
the way of example, for an inclination i = 65°, that is variation of 1.55°, the drift of
argument of the perigee has a value of around 6.5° per annum.
It
is
evident
that
the
Molniya
HEO
satellite
has
the
advantage
of
high-elevation-angle coverage of the Northern Hemisphere because of a need to
completely cover a great part of the Russian territory. Three satellites in this orbit and
phasing are chosen so that at least one satellite is available at any time over the horizon.
Thus, with three satellites, each satellite is used (or handover is) 8 h per day, while
with four satellites handover is every 6 h. The LES must use tracking antenna systems,
so a terminal with only one antenna will have an outage during handover (switching)
from one satellite to another.
The disadvantages of the Molniya orbit include the need for multiple satellites
(which the system does not need), the poor, virtually useless coverage of the
Southern Hemisphere and the need for tracking antennas at each LES. Since the
distance from terminal to satellite is continually changing, the received power and
frequency vary (Doppler effect). The former may require automatic uplink power
control and scheduling is needed to allow LES to switch satellites simultaneously.
As the satellite altitude varies, the beam also coverage changes, so the satellite
carries a tracking antenna that must be kept continuously pointed at operating LES.

Tundra Orbit
The Russian Tundra HEO system employs 2 satellites in two 24-h orbits separated
by 180° around the Earth, with apogee distance at 53,622 km and perigee at
17,951 km,
which

with
high-elevation angles. The Tundra orbit can be useful for regional coverage for both
FSS and MSS applications. Similar to the Molniya orbit, this orbit is particularly
useful for LMSS, where the masking effects caused by surrounding obstacles and
multiple path are pronounced at low-elevation angles, (>30°).
The period (t) of the orbit is equal to tE, which is around 24 h. The characteristics
of an example orbit of this type are given in Table 2.4. This orbit has only one track
on the Earth’s surface, as shown in Fig. 2.11 (c-2), for a perigee argument equal to
270°, inclination i = 63.4° and eccentricity e = 0.35. The latter parameter can have
three values of eccentricity e = 15, e = 25, and e = 45.
According to the value of orbital eccentricity, the loop above the Northern
Hemisphere is accentuated to a greater or lesser extent. For eccentricity equal to
zero, the track has a form of Fig. 8, with loops of the same size and symmetrical
with respect to the equator. When the eccentricity increases, the upper loop
decreases, while the lower loop increases and the crossover point of the track is
displaced toward the North. This loop disappears for a value of eccentricity of the
order of e = 0.37 and the lower loop becomes its maximum size. The transit time of
the loop represents a substantial part of the orbital period and varies with the
eccentricity. The position of the loop can be displaced toward the East or West, with
respect to the point of maximum latitude, by changing the value of argument of the
perigee (ω) and the eccentricity.
2.3.3.3
Loopus Orbit
The proposed Loopus system, which employs 3 satellites in three 8-h orbits sep-
arated by 120° around the Earth, has an apogee distance at 39,117 km and perigee
at 1238 km. This orbit has similar advantages and disadvantages as for the Molniya
orbit. One of the problems encountered by the LES is that of repointing the antenna
during the handover (changeover) from one satellite to another. With orbits whose
track contains a loop, it is possible to use only the loop as the useful part of the track
in the trajectory. Handover between two satellites is performed at the crossover
point of the track. At this instant, the two satellites are seen from the LES in exactly
the same direction and it is not necessary to repoint the antenna. To achieve
continuous coverage of the region situated under the loop, the transmit time of the
loop must be a submultiple of the orbit period and the number of satellites. Hence,
the coverage can be extended to one part of the hemisphere by increasing the
number of satellites in orbit regularly spaced about the globe.

2.3.4
Polar Earth Orbits (PEO)
The PEO constellation is today a synonym for providing coverage of both polar
regions for different types of meteorological observation and satellite determination
services. Namely, a satellite in this orbit travels its course over the geographical North
and South Poles and will effectively follow a line of longitude. Certainly, this orbit
may be virtually circular or elliptical depending upon requirements of the program
and is inclined at about 90° to the equatorial plane, covering both poles. The orbit is
ﬁxed in space while the Earth rotates underneath and consequently, the satellite, over
a number of orbits determined by its speciﬁc orbit line, will pass over any given point
on the Earth’s surface. Therefore, a single satellite in a PEO provides in principle
coverage to the entire globe, although there are long periods during which the satellite
is out of view of a particular ground station. Accessibility can of course be improved
by deploying more than one satellite in different orbital planes. If two PEO satellite
orbits are spaced at 90° to each other, the time between satellites passes over any
given point will be halved, which orbit is shown in Fig. 2.11 (A).
The PEO system is rarely used for communication purposes because the satellite
is in view of a speciﬁc point on the Earth’s surface for only a short period of time.
Any complex steerable antenna systems would also need to follow the satellite as it
passes overhead. At any rate, this satellite orbit may well be acceptable for a
processing store-and-forward type of communications system and for satellite
determination and navigation.
There are four primary requirements for PEO systems as follows:
(1) To provide total global satellite visibility for worldwide LEOSAR COSPAS–
SARSAT distress and safety satellite beacons EPIRB, PLB, and ELT
applications;
(2) To provide global continuous coverage for current or newly developed and
forthcoming satellite navigation systems;
(3) To provide at L-band or any convenient spectrum the communication
requirements of ships and aircraft in the polar regions not covered by the
Inmarsat system; and
(4) To provide global coverage for meteorological and synoptic observation
stations.
The Inmarsat team has studied two broad ranges of orbit altitude of PEO for both
distress and communication purposes: ﬁrst, low altitudes up to 1400 km and second,
high altitudes above 11,000 km. In reality, these two orbit ranges are separated by the
Inner Van Allen radiation belt. In the regions of the radiation belt, the radiation level
increases roughly exponentially with height at around 1000 km, reaching a peak at
about 5000 km altitude. Therefore, a critical requirement to reduce high-energy
proton damage to the solar cell arrays of the satellite system constrains the PEO to low
and high altitudes. As is evident, another Outer Van Allen Belt has no negative
inﬂuence on these two PEO constellations because it lies far a way between MEO and
GEO satellite planes.
128

Space Segment

These two speciﬁc systems studied by Inmarsat are COSPAS–SARSAT low
PEO at 1000 km altitude and high PEO at 12,000 km altitude, similar to that
studied by ERNO, named SERES (Search and Rescue Satellite) system. Thus, it is
considered that these two systems demonstrate clearly the solution tradeoff and
constraints on a joint PEO distress, SAR, and communication mission. Other
possible orbits for polar coverage can be an inclined HEO Molniya constellation of
four satellites; GIO 45° inclined orbit of four satellites and 55° inclined circular
MEO at 20,000 km altitude for GPS and GLONASS satellite navigation systems.
In the meantime, the COSPAS–SARSAT system has developed a special GEOSAR
system using three GEO satellites for global distress communications satellite
beacons in combination with already-developed LEOSAR systems using four PEO
satellites.
For both the low and high PEO systems, the number of operational satellites
required to provide adequate Earth coverage needs to be minimized in order to
achieve minimum system costs. An IMO and ICAO requirement for the
GMDSS/COSPAS–SARSATmission is that there should be no time delay in dis-
tress alerting anywhere in the globe.
2.3.4.1
Low PEO
The low PEO satellite constellation similar to the LEO satellite constellation mostly
employs both polar and near-polar orbits for communications and navigation util-
ities. Thus, a particular example of a system that uses this type of orbit is the
COSPAS–SARSAT SAR system for maritime, land, and aeronautical applications.
This system uses 8 satellites in 4 near-polar orbits: four US-based SARSAT satellite
constellations
at
860 km
orbits,
inclined
at
99°,
which
makes
them
Sun-synchronous and four COSPAS satellite conﬁgurations at 1000 km orbits,
inclined at 82°. However, this orbit was also suitable for the ﬁrst satellite navigation
systems Transit and Cicada, developed by the USA and the former USSR,
respectively.
Otherwise, with a limited number of low-altitude PEO satellites, it is impossible
to provide continuous coverage to polar region, because the view of individual
spacecraft is relatively small and their transit time is short. However, because the
time for a single orbit is low, less than two hours, and a different section of the polar
region is covered at each orbit due to Earth rotation, this drawback is somewhat
offset. For a given number of satellites, preferably about eight, it is possible to
optimize the constellation that maximizes total system coverage, to improve han-
dover and minimize waiting time between transits. This problem can be solved with
additional GES terminals over pole area.
Figure 2.13 illustrates the Earth track of ten successive orbits of satellite in low
PEO with an altitude of 1000 km. The MES in shaded area A (4200 km in
diameter) would see the satellite, in the absence of environmental screening, at an
angle of elevation not less than 10°, while the satellite was passing through the
equatorial plane. The coverage area has the same size and shape wherever the
2.3
Types of Orbits for Mobile and Other Satellite Systems
129

satellite is in the orbit but its apparent size and shape would change with latitude,
being distorted by the map projection used in the ﬁgure. Thus, the South Pole
coverage area at a single pass of the satellite is shown in ﬁgure by shaded area B.
The same ﬁgure shows that a single PEO satellite in a polar orbit will have a
brief sighting of every part of the Earth’s surface everyday. There will be 2 or 3 of
these glimpses per day near the equator, the number increasing as the poles
approach.
The period of visibility was seen from the MES range from about 10 min, the
satellite passing overhead, down to a few seconds when the satellite appears brieﬂy
above the horizon. If the orbital plane of the satellite is given an angle of inclination
differing from 90° of the PEO, a similar Earth track is obtained but the geographical
distribution of the satellite visibility changes. One LEO satellite with an orbital
inclination of 50° would have better visibility between 60° N and 60° S latitude
than a PEO satellite but it would have no visibility at all of the polar regions.
The low PEO conﬁguration is attractive for mobile distress communications for
two reasons. First, the transmission path loss is relatively low, allowing reliable
communication with a low-powered satellite beacon and PEO spacecraft. An alti-
tude of about 1000 km is the upper limit for good reception of signals at
243/406 MHz sent from emergency distress beacons. Secondly, the Doppler shift is
high, approximately 30 kHz at 1.6 GHz, allowing accurate location of the distress
transmitter. On the other hand, there are several signiﬁcant disadvantages.
However, as mentioned earlier, PEO coverage is not continuous unless there is
simultaneous communication between a distress buoy and a ground terminal
because of the small footprint of each individual satellite. Accordingly, storage and
retransmission of distress messages onboard processing would be necessarily
adding to the distress alert delay time and also to satellite mass and complexity.
The short visibility period during a transit and the uneconomic need for large
numbers of satellites for continuous coverage makes a low PEO unattractive for
communications considerations. If this orbit conﬁgured well as an economic
solution for distress coverage in polar regions to be used for communications
purposes, users would have to operate with the following restrictions: (1) only burst
mode, non-simultaneous data communication would be possible; (2) transmission
time and/or bit rate would be limited by satellite message storage capability;

(3) replies to the message would require an interrogation or polling system from the
MES expecting a reply; and (4) depending on the PEO constellation and MES
position, a reply could take some hours.
However, many of these PEO communication limitations would be removed if a
system of intersatellite links, possibly in addition to inter-GEO infrastructure, were
used to provide a near-continuous, simultaneous two-way communication system.
The complexity and likely cost of such system would almost certainly not be
justiﬁed by the expected low level of polar communication trafﬁc. Thus, in con-
sidering the possible integration of PEO and GEO for communication purposes, it is
necessary to determine the additional requirements and constraints arising from
polar operation. In this context, for reliable communications the number of addi-
tional LES required for operation to PEO is a signiﬁcant element of the overall
system. For example, a constellation of eight low PEO would require about six LES
worldwide for polar coverage assuming message storing and forwarding tech-
niques, where a high PEO would require a minimum of two LES located in North
and South polar latitudes for continuous polar coverage with simultaneous two-way
communications. In addition, it would be necessary to obtain reliable terrestrial
links between the LES of each system, as well as intersatellite links between the
PEO and the GEO satellites.
In any case, by using the store and transmit method, a low PEO system could
effectively be served for the relay of mobile distress, safety, and urgency messages,
for maritime, land, and aeronautical applications via satellite beacons to
receive-only terminals onshore.
2.3.4.2
High PEO
The high PEO constellation would consist of three satellites separated by 120° in
the same circular orbit of 12,000 km altitude, geometrically similar to the GEO and
as orbit similar to MEO conﬁguration. This orbit can provide continuous coverage
to both polar regions above 59° latitude. In such a way, six satellites (in two orbital
planes of three satellites each) would provide continuous and real global coverage if
that was required, which GEO constellation alone cannot obtain.
By comparison with low PEO systems transmission path losses are higher at an
altitude of 12,000 km but not to the extent that a distress beacon need be especially
high powered to transmit successfully to a high PEO satellite. Reception of the
COSPAS–SARSAT existing two very low-powered distress frequencies will be
interfered, but not impossible. The Doppler shift is lower (about 10 kHz at
1.6 GHz), not allowing very accurate area location of the distress transmitters.
Single high-latitude LES in both Arctic and Antarctic polar regions allows reception
with no delay of all distress messages transmitted from above 59° latitude.
Furthermore, using these two LES positioned at high latitude with continuous
visibility of at least one of the three satellites and collocated or linked with an
Inmarsat LES, can offer a full range of near continuous communication services to
the polar regions.

2.3.5
Hybrid Satellite Orbits (HSO)
The hybrid satellite constellation can be conﬁgured by several types of combina-
tions between existing orbital solutions today. Namely, any of these combinations
can provide better global coverage for both hemispheres, including both polar
regions. In this context will be introduced shortly ﬁve hybrid constellation systems,
which are currently using or developing MSC and navigation systems as follows:
1. Combination of GEO and HEO Constellations—The development of a
MSS that would provide reliable communications with MES terminals, such as
oceangoing vessels, land mobiles (road vehicles and trains) and aircraft, rural areas
and remote terminals, illustrated in Fig. 2.14. This MSC system, called Marathon,
includes ﬁve GEO Arcos-type satellites and four Mayak-type satellites in a HEO, as
well as a ground segment that is composed of base stations and terminals installed
at ﬁxed or mobile users premises.
This MSC system, called Marathon, includes ﬁve GEO Arcos-type satellites and
four Mayak-type satellites in a HEO, as well as a ground segment that is composed
of base stations and terminals installed at ﬁxed or mobile users premises. Therefore,
the combination of GEO and non-GEO satellite constellations makes it possible to
render GMSC services, including those at high latitudes and in the both polar areas;
this is especially important for Russia, with its vast northern Eurasian territories and
to provide the most reliable satellite communication between the territories of the
Western and Eastern Hemispheres.
This hybrid constellation can be useful for the Alaska, Greenland, and northern
territory of Canada as well. The similar hybrid constellation with 2 HEO satellites
can be conﬁgured for complete coverage of Southern Hemisphere with apogees on
opposite side as shown in the same ﬁgure. This HSO conﬁguration is the best
solution for providing complete global coverage for aeronautical applications.
2. Combination of GEO and PEO Constellations—This current combination
of orbits has been developed by the efforts of the COSPAS–SARSAT organization,
with the assistance of IMO, Inmarsat, and other international and regional con-
tributors. At the other words, the COSPAS–SARSAT space segment is a combi-
nation of three GEO operational satellites of the subsystem called GEOSAR and
four PEO operational satellites of the subsystem called LEOSAR, with spare

INSAT-2A and two GOES-type GOES-E and GOES-W, while the LEOSAR
conﬁguration provides two COSPAS and two SARSAT spacecrafts. Otherwise, the
GEOSAR project in the future has to include the European MSC and two Russian
Luch-M spacecraft. This system is responsible for providing distress alert via
special radio beacons (EPIRB, PLB and ELT) and to help SAR forces on-scene
determination for maritime, land, and aeronautical applications, in which constel-
lation is shown in Fig. 2.15 (Left).
3. Combination of GEO and LEO Constellations—Celestri is the Motorola
trademark name for a proposed GEO and LEO satellite hybrid communication
network, shown in Fig. 2.15 (Right). The network will combine 9 GEO and 63
LEO satellites in 7 planes with Earth-based control equipment and provide inter-
faces to existing telecommunication infrastructures, the Internet, and corporate and
personal networks. The system will offer a 64 Kb/s voice circuit from anywhere in
the world. The architecture is not limited to ﬁxed-sized channels but permits
dynamic bandwidth assignment based on application demand. Business users will
beneﬁt by Celestri’s to provide remote access to LAN infrastructures.
4. Combination of MEO and HEO Constellations—The newly proposed MSS
Ellipso is developing in combination with an initial complement of seven
Concordia satellites deployed in a circular equatorial MEO at an altitude of
8050 km and ten Borealis satellites in two HEO planes inclined at 116.6°. They
have apogees of 7605 km and perigees of 633 km and a three-hour orbital period.
This combination of two constellations, shown in Fig. 2.16 (Left), would pro-
vide coverage of the entire Northern Hemisphere including North Pole areas and
part of the Southern Hemisphere up to 50° latitude South. The HEO satellites can
spend a greater proportion of their orbital periods over the northern latitudes and,
together with the MEO constellation, the Ellipso hybrid system will provide voice,
data, and Fax communication and navigation RDSS services to areas with large
landmasses, enormous populations with a large density of users and potentially
widespread markets. This system is also planned to cooperate with the terrestrial
PSTN and other services.
5. Combination of MEO and LEO Constellations—The Kompomash con-
sortium for space systems in Russia have prepared the Gostelesat satellite system

satellite constellation. Thus, this satellite project is provided for future global MSC
and navigation applications with possibility to cover both polar regions.

Spacecraft Subsystems
A communications satellite essentially consists of two major functional units:
payload and bus. The primary function of the payload is to provide communication
between LES and MES, while the bus provides all the necessary electrical and
mechanical support to the payload and all satellite missions illustrated in Fig. 2.17
The payload is made up of the multipurpose repeaters and antenna systems. The
repeater performs the required processing of the signal, and the antenna system is
used to receive signals from LES and to transmit signals to MES in the coverage
area and vice versa.

2.4.1
Satellite Repeaters for Mobile Satellite
Communications
The function of a satellite repeater is to receive the uplink RF signals from either
ground segment service or feeder links, then to convert these signals to the
appropriate downlink frequency and power, and to retransmit them toward the
service or feeder links ground segment. Two main types of repeaters are possible
for onboard utilization: Transparent and regenerative transponders, however, are
developed many other types for different satellite applications.
2.4.1.1
Transparent or Bent-Pipe Transponder
The basic function of the satellite transponder is to isolate individual carriers or
groups of carriers of signals and to boost their power level before they are
retransmitted to the ground stations. The carrier frequencies are also altered as the
carriers pass through the satellite. Satellite repeaters that process the carrier in this
way are typically referred to as transparent or bent-pipe satellite transponders,
illustrated in Fig. 2.18. Only the basic RF characteristics of the carrier (amplitude
and frequency) are altered by the satellite. The detailed signal carrier format, such
as the modulation characteristics and the spectral shape, remains completely
unchanged.
Transmission via a transparent satellite transponder is often likened to a
bent-pipe because the satellite simply channels the information back to the ground
stations. A bent-pipe is a commonly used satellite link when the satellite
transponder simply converts the uplink RF into a downlink RF, with its power

ampliﬁcation. Initially, the received uplink signals from LES or MES by Rx
antenna are ﬁltered in an Input Bandpass Filter (IBF) prior to ampliﬁcation in a
low-noise ampliﬁer (LNA).
In addition, the output of the LNA is then fed into a local oscillator (LO), which
performs the required frequency shift from uplink to downlink RF and the bandpass
channel ﬁlter after the mixer removes unwanted image frequencies resulting in the
downconversion, prior to undergoing two ampliﬁcation stages of signals in the
channel and high-power ampliﬁer (HPA). Finally, the output signal of the HPA is
then ﬁltered in the output bandpass ﬁlter (OBF) prior to transmission through Tx
antenna to the ground. The IFB is a bandpass ﬁlter which blocks out all other RF
used in satellite communications. After that, the receiver converts the incoming
signal into a lower frequency, using an LO which is controlled to provide a very
stable frequency source. This is needed to reduce all noises to facilitate processing
of the incoming signal and to enable the downlink frequencies to be established.
The channel ﬁlter isolates the various communications channels contained in the
waveband allowed through by the input ﬁlter. Filtering often leads to large power
losses, creating a need for extra ampliﬁcation, usually followed by a main ampliﬁer.
In order to attain the required gain of HPA, this segment may employ either a
solid-state power ampliﬁer (SSPA) or a traveling wave tube ampliﬁer (TWTA). In a
more complex transponder design, in order to achieve higher RF power, it may be
possible to combine the output of several ampliﬁers.
Therefore, to do this the incoming signal must be divided in such a way so as to
provide separate identical input to each ampliﬁer, see 6 TWTA presented in
Fig. 2.19. A power combiner then recombines the RF signals from the ampliﬁers to
produce a single RF output. The output ﬁlter removes all unwanted signals from the
transmitted downlink returning to the Earth stations. High reliability throughout the
lifetime of the satellite is achieved by duplicating critical units in the receiver, such
as TWTA.
2.4.1.2
Regenerative Transponder
Other satellite system designs go through a more complex onboard process to
manipulate the carrier’s formats, by using onboard processing architecture. This
payload architecture offers advantages over the transparent alternative, including
improved transmission quality and the prospect of compact and inexpensive MES
and handheld user terminals. A typical onboard processing system will implement
some or all of the functions that are performed by the ground-based transmitter
and/or receiver in a transparent satellite system.
Therefore, these functions may include recovery of the original information on
board the satellite and the processing of this information into a different carrier
format for transmission to the ground stations. In fact, any satellite transponder that
recreates the signals carrier in this way is usually referred to as a regenerative
transponder, illustrated in Fig. 2.18. This type of satellite transponder provides
demodulation
and modulation capacity
completely on board
the
satellite.
136

Space Segment

The received uplink signal goes along the downconverter segment prior to coming
into the onboard demodulator, where it is demodulated and processed in the base
band processor.
This technology provides ﬂexible functions, such as switching and routings. The
downlink signal generated by an onboard modulator passes along the upconverter
segment and is transmitted via the antenna. For this type of system link design can
be separately conducted for the uplink and downlink because link degradation
factors are decoupled between the uplink and the downlink by the onboard
demodulator and modulator, supported by the base band processor.
A regenerative transponder with base band processing permits reformatting of
data without limitation to MES Rx, while the bent-pipe system requires a satellite
link design for the entire link, involving both uplink and downlink, but the forward
link burst rate is limited by the MES G/T and demodulation performance.
Advanced MSS include intersatellite links to establish a direct connection between

satellite transponders and in this way to enlarge system coverage and help the
reception of signals from other GEO satellite coverage not visible for particular
LES and MES terminals. Moreover, an intersatellite link can help to solve the
problems associated with some TTN infrastructures or to reduce landline charges.
In the same way, intersatellite links can also provide a connection from a satellite to
neighboring satellites in a constellation of non-GEO space segment and so, they are
beneﬁcialinreducingthenumberofsatellitehopswhenEarthcoverageofeachsatellite
is limited. Intersatellite links are usually implemented with regenerative satellite
transponder systems, mainly due to the ﬂexible connection to intersatellite links.
2.4.1.3
Satellite Transponders for Inmarsat-2 MSC
A transponder as the nucleus of the Inmarsat network receives information from
LES in a directed beam of energy at 6 GHz in the C-band and converted infor-
mation broadcasts at 1.5 GHz in the L-band. The link from MES follows the
reciprocal path. The Inmarsat-2 payload consists of two transparent transponders:
the C/L-band, illustrated in Fig. 2.19, and the L/C-band, shown in Fig. 2.19.
1. Inmarsat-2 C/L-band Transponder—This transponder receives uplink
signals in the C-band of 6.4 GHz from LES and retransmits downlink signals in the
L-band of 1.5 GHz to MES, after frequency conversion and signal ampliﬁcation by
a HPA. The signals received by a C-band antenna are fed via IBF and LNA to a
downconverter section. A signal channel is followed by an automatic level control
(ALC) device, which limits the level of the signal to the ampliﬁer. The HPA
consists of six TWTA and their associated power supplies. In front of each TWTA
is a driver/linearizer, predisposed to compensate the nonlinear RF properties of the
TWTA. The signal driver supplies an equal drive signal to each of the four TWTAs
that are active at any given time and the other two can be activated for backup if the
operating TWTA malfunctions. For this reason, the signal driver is preceded by an
amplitude equalizer. However, the active TWTA are selected by 2/3 and 3/2
switches and their output powers are combined by a power combiner. The total
power is fed to an L-band transmission antenna via OBF.
2. Inmarsat-2 L/C-band Transponder—This transponder receives uplink
signals in the L-band of 1.6 GHz from MES and retransmits downlink signals in the
C-band of 3.6 GHz to LES, after frequency conversion and signal ampliﬁcation by
the HPA. The signals received by an L-band antenna are fed to a downconverter via
IBF and LNA. At the down-converter, signals are converted into 60 MHz IF by
LO. A ﬁlter assembly then provides the required characteristics divided into four
channels. Following upconversion, the signal passes to an ALC unit and the power
for four channels is combined and signals are upconverted from 60 to 3.8 GHz by
activated TWTA. The ampliﬁed signal in HPA then goes through bandpass and
harmonic ﬁlters in OBF before being distributed among the 7 cup-dipole elements
of the C-band transmit antenna for radiation to the Earth’s surface.

Satellite Repeaters for COSPAS–SARSAT System
The COSPAS–SARSAT organization initially developed the ﬁrst generation of
LEO Search and Rescue (LEOSAR) systems, such as COSPAS and SARSAT LEO
spacecraft. COSPAS–SARSAT is also employing four GEO satellites for its new
GEO Search and Rescue (GEOSAR) 406.05 MHz mission, such as the Russian
Luch-M, the US Geostationary Operational Environmental Satellite (GOES), Indian
National Satellite System (INSAT), and the European Meteosat Second Generation
(MSG). In the following context will be introduced Luch-M and GOES
transponders of the GEOSAR subsystem including COSPAS transponder and
SARSAT Rx/Tx conﬁgurations of the LEOSAR subsystem.
2.4.2.1
COSPAS GEOSAR Luch-M Transponder
The Luch-M spacecraft is developed by Russia and is serving for COSPAS–
SARSAT and also for communication applications. The COSPAS GEO Luch-M
East bird is at 95°E covering Indian Ocean and Luch-M West at 16°W is covering
Paciﬁc Ocean.
A functional diagram of the Luch-M GEOSAR transponder is shown in
Fig. 2.20. The repeater is redundantly conﬁgured and is comprised of the following
subsystems:
(a) The UHF 406 MHz receive antenna, LNA, and IF1 Ampliﬁer as main com-
ponents of SAR 406 MHz Receiver (Rx);
(b) The IF1 Ampliﬁer, Power Ampliﬁer (PA), and SHF 11,381 MHz transmit
antenna as main parts of SAR 11,381 MHz Transmitter (Tx); and
(c) The intermediate components of Rx and Tx are local oscillator and
synthesizer.

The 406.05 MHz signals from COSPAS–SARSAT distress beacons are received
by the Luch-M UHF antenna. The signal is downconverted twice to an Intermediate
Frequency (IF) of 18.55 MHz after which it is ﬁltered. The 3 dB beamwidth of this
ﬁlter is 600 kHz. This IF signal (S1(t)) is upconverted and then combined with
signals from other instruments onboard the satellite (S2(t)). This composite signal is
ampliﬁed, upconverted to 11381.05 MHz and ampliﬁed to a power of 3.75 W. The
composite ampliﬁed signal is then ﬁltered before being transmitted via the satellite
.6 M parabolic antenna.
2.4.2.2
SARSAT GEOSAR GOES Transponder
The GOES spacecraft is developed by the USA and is serving for COSPAS–
SARSAT and also for meteorological applications. The SARSAT GEO GOES East
bird is at 75˚W covering Atlantic Ocean and GOES West at 135˚W is covering
almost entire Paciﬁc Ocean.
A functional diagram of the GOES SAR repeater is illustrated in Fig. 2.21. The
repeater is redundantly conﬁgured and consists of the following units:
(a) One UHF 406 MHz receive antenna, Switch (SW) dividing two 406 MHz
LNA shared with another satellite subsystem and two dual-conversion
406 MHz receivers;
(b) Two 3 W (watt) phase-modulated L-band transmitters synchronously swit-
ched and one SHF 1544.5 MHz transmit antenna; and
(c) Telemetry and Command (T&C) points interfaced with the spacecraft
Command and Telemetry subsystem.

The 406 MHz SAR signals from COSPAS–SARSAT distress beacons are
received on the UHF antenna and fed through the antenna diplexer and switch to an
LNA module in one of the redundant pairs of Data Collection Platform Repeaters
(DCPR). The DCPR LNA modules are used as a part of the SAR implementation to
accommodate circuit efﬁciency on the spacecraft.
The LNA module outputs are connected to the redundant pair of SAR receivers.
The signal applied to the selected receiver is downconverted for bandpass ﬁltering
in accordance with one of two commandable bandwidth modes; a narrow band
mode of 20 kHz or a wide band mode of 80 kHz. The ﬁltered output signal is
further downconverted to near baseband and fed through ampliﬁers to the SAR
transmitter.
However,
the
overall
gain
of
the
SAR
receiver
can
be
command-selected into a ﬁxed gain or ALC mode.
The outputs of the receivers are provided to the redundant pair of SAR trans-
mitters. The selected SAR transmitter phase modulates the signal, multiplies the
signal to 1544.5 MHz, and ampliﬁes the modulated carrier to 3 W. The
phase-modulated signal has the nominal modulation index set such that the carrier
suppression is 3 dB with the receiver in the ALC mode or with the receiver in the
ﬁxed gain mode operating with two nominal beacon signals plus the noise.
A baseband limiter restricts the modulation index from exceeding 2 radians. The
transmitter output is applied through a 4 MHz bandwidth ﬁlter to the helical
antenna and radiated with an EIRP of +15.0 dBW.
The GOES repeater has redundant LNA modules, receivers, and transmitters that
can be selected to deﬁne a complete repeater conﬁguration. At this point, a speciﬁc
repeater conﬁguration can be operated in the modes described in Table 2.5.
ALC mode is concerning two equal test tones each at 7 dB above the receiver
noise applied to the receiver input will not produce intermodulation products within
the transponder bandwidth greater than 30 dB below the test tone output level.
The GOES SAR Receiver and Transmitter parameters are shown in Table 2.6.
Note 1 in Table of Rx Parameters is nominal input level at antenna from 5 W
beacons located at 45± Elevation angle to the satellite, which includes 4.1 dB
polarization losses.
Note 2 in Table of Tx Parameters is concerning Fixed Gain Mode, which is
presenting two equal test tones each at 2 dB above the Rx noise applied to the
repeater receiver input will not produce intermodulation products within the
transponder bandwidth greater than 20 dB below the test tone output level.

COSPAS LEOSAR Transponder
The COSPAS LEOSAR payload system functional diagram is illustrated in

The uplink signal from SARP and SARR receive antenna (SPA) is entering via
ﬁlter and RF switch in one of two receivers. From each Rx, the 75 kHz signal by
speed of 2.4 Kb/s is passing formatters, T&C, and entering in one of two Tx units.
The downlink signal from the SAR L-band transmit antenna (SLA) can be detected
by any COSPAS–SARSAT ground Local User Terminal (LUT) in the LEOSAR
satellite system known as LEOLUT.

The COSPAS LEOSAR payload of the COSPAS–SARSAT system is composed
of:
(a) SAR Repeater (SARR) is getting SAR distress signals from ground beacons
and without processing is retransmitting them to the LUT land infrastructures;
(b) SAR processor (SARP) is processing receiving SAR signals and retransmit
them to the ﬁrst-available LUT station; and
(c) Uplink UHF 406.05 MHz and downlink SHF 1544.5 MHz antennas.
The SARR provides local mode coverage for the 406 MHz band without pro-
cessing distress and SAR signals. The SARP provides both local mode and global
mode coverage for the UHF 406 MHz band via COSPAS satellites, which have an
improved SARP with memory known as SARP-2, shown in Fig. 2.20 as Rx SARP
A and B processors. Processed data are transmitted to the ground stations via the
downlink transmitter. In addition, this transponder is also providing routine
Telecommand (TC) from spacecraft and Telemetry (TM) to spacecraft for better
control and management of spacecraft.
2.4.2.4
SARSAT LEOSAR Spacecraft Receiver and Transmitter
The LEOSAR receiver is an integrated component of SARR without processing
elements and can be also integrated in SARP conﬁguration with processing and
formatting modes. As shown in Fig. 2.23, the two 406 MHz receivers are getting
RF signal from beacons via antenna and via mixers is transforming it in IF signal.
Each receiver contains automatic gain control (AGC) and provides two outputs to
drive the two transmitters, while via mixers they share the same oscillator and are
coherent in a ratio of 1:2.
As illustrated in Fig. 2.23, each one of the transmitters has four inputs in
Baseband Summer: one for each of the two 406 MHz receivers, one for the
Processed Data Stream (PDS) channel, and one spare port. The signals are then
entering in Phase Modulator where the receiver input is illuminated by a sinusoidal

signal from oscillator at the maximum frequency and level of IF. The IF signal is
passing multiplier and ﬁltering process and as RF is transmitted at 1554.5 MHz via
antenna to Local User Terminal (LUT) on the ground.
2.4.3
Satellite Repeaters for New Generation of GEO
and non-GEO MSC
The new generations of GEO and non-GEO satellites for MSC are developed by
Inmarsat GEO satellite operator, while non-GEO satellites, such as Big LEO
satellite constellations, are developed by Iridium and Globalstar, and Little LEO
satellite constellation is developed by Orbcomm.
2.4.3.1
Inmarsat-3 GEO Satellite Communication Repeater
The Inmarsat-3 development was not paced by a lifetime limit of Inmarsat-2, but by
its capacity limitation. The number of ships using Inmarsat increases every year,
both by choice and gradually because of requirements that ships be equipped for
MSC. In addition, since 1990, Inmarsat has provided service to airplanes as well as
ships. Besides requiring increased satellite capacity, the airplanes also require more
of the satellite power because of their smaller antennas.
Planning of the Inmarsat-3 series began about 1988. Proposals were received
early in 1990; that summer, negotiations with a contractor began in parallel with a
Fig. 2.23 Diagram of Inmarsat-3 transponders—Courtesy of Book: by Martin

Space Segment

5-month technology validation program. Thus, the technology program concentrated
on the L-band multibeam antennas and the L-band transmitter power ampliﬁer.
The ﬁnal contract was signed early in 1991; it included four satellites and
options for more. In March 1994, one option was changed to an order for a ﬁfth
satellite. The capacity increase relative to the foregoing Inmarsat satellites is
achieved by the use of spot beams at the L-band transmit-and-receive frequencies
used between the satellites and the mobile terminals. The main requirements on the
Inmarsat-3 payload illustrated in Fig. 2.24 are as follows:
1. Reconﬁgurable spot beams so that each satellite can provide the desired cov-
erage from any of the ﬁve operating locations;
2. Flexible allocation of the total L-band power among the spot beams and the
global beam to adapt to changing trafﬁc loading; and
3. Channelization matching the international L-band allocations and switchable to
adapt to Inmarsat needs and to ensure compatibility with other L-band satellites.
The Inmarsat-3 payload consists of ﬁve sections. The C-band-to-L-band forward
channel is for MSC from ﬁxed terminals to mobiles and is matched to the
L-band-to-C-band return channel for communications in the opposite direction.
These two channels are the main part of the payload. There is also a
C-band-to-C-band channel for administrative trafﬁc between mobile terminals in
limited circumstances such as during search and rescue efforts. The ﬁnal section of
the payload is a navigation channel that augments the US GPS and the
Russian GLONASS system for new communication, navigation, and surveillance
(CNS) service known as Global Satellite Augmentation System (GSAS). When
Inmarsat-3 was developed, the L-band-to-L-band and navigation capabilities were
new features in MSS.

Inmarsat-3 spot beams in coverage area are quite small to allow frequency reuse
and large enough to moderate the payload complex, which grows with the number
of coverage areas. Many of these coverage areas have the same geometry at more
than one location, or differ only by a rotation of the coverage areas about the
subsatellite point. As a result, the Inmarsat-3 design has seven spot beams for the
L-band transmission, each generated by four- or six-element subarrays of the
22-element feed array, while global coverage beams are used at C-band. The feed
array can be rotated 21° about its axis to change the coverage geometry at the time
of satellite relocation. Adjacent beams overlap, but some separated beam combi-
nations have sufﬁcient isolation to allow frequency reuse, namely to use of the same
frequencies in two different beams.
The limited L-band spectrum available for use with mobile terminals is reused
twice in the Inmarsat-3 design. When Inmarsat-3 was developed, the L-band
allocation was subdivided for Maritime, Land, Aeronautical, and general mobile
applications. To match this, the Inmarsat-3 frequency plan has 10 bands with 1–
4.5 MHz bandwidths. All except the narrowest band have switchable Surface
Acoustic Wave (SAW) ﬁlters that can divide the band into two or three sub-bands
separated by 200 kHz guard bands for use in different antenna beams, or combine
the sub-bands with the intervening guard bands for use in the same beam. The
frequencies of the guard bands are different in the two reuses of the spectrum in
order to maximize the ability to adjust spectrum usage. More recently, most of the
allocations have been generalized to allow any application. Nevertheless, the
Inmarsat-3 channelization is still good for efﬁcient spectrum utilization.
The combination of many frequency bands and multiple satellite antenna beams
would typically imply a very complex switching network on the satellite to provide
ﬂexible interconnections; this has been avoided by using a multiport ampliﬁer. This
ampliﬁer is composed of a beam-forming matrix followed by an output ﬁltering and
routing network. The beam-forming matrix has eight inputs, corresponding to seven
spot beams plus one global beam. The output network has 22 output ports, cor-
responding to the 22 antenna feeds. The combination of the matrix and the network
allows the power of all 22 ampliﬁers to be routed to any one beam or to be
distributed among many beams, both spot and global. The distribution of power is
controlled by the signal phasing set in the beam-forming matrix. All the ampliﬁers
operate at high efﬁciency regardless of the distribution of signals among the spot
and global beams. Even if the total power is routed to one beam, it is spread over
the four or six feeds that generate that beam, thereby avoiding excessive power at
any one feed. Two global channels, and the L-band-to-L-band channel (when used),
are always transmitted through global beams; all other channels in the L-band
frequency plan may be routed to either spot or global beams.
2.4.3.2
Inmarsat-4 GEO Satellite Communication Repeater
The next question Inmarsat faced was whether to use a bent-pipe (transparent)
transponder as on Inmarsat-3 before or to design a new regenerative payload on the
146
2
Space Segment

last generation of the Inmarsat-4 payloads. In the end, notwithstanding the better
characteristics offered by a regenerative solution, Inmarsat decided to also imple-
ment its fourth-generation navigation payload as a bent-pipe repeater.
The company has negotiated European spacecraft manufacturer Astrium a 700
million US $ contract to build three Inmarsat I-4 satellites. The contract was
awarded in May 2000 with a planned service start sometimes in 2004. However,
satellite development difﬁculties and slower than expected demand delayed the start
of service to 2005. Astrium includes the former Matra Marconi Space, which built
the Inmarsat-2 satellites and the payload for the Inmarsat-3s. Two Inmarsat-4
satellites were placed in two of Inmarsat’s existing IOR and AOR-W orbits in 2005.
The third Inmarsat-4 satellite was launched later to extend the coverage area so as to
make it global, based on business and operational considerations. The satellite
locations are subjected to review and may change.
The focus for the Inmarsat 4 satellite transponders is what Inmarsat calls the
Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) with communication speeds to 432 Kb/s
for Internet access and multimedia transmissions, as well as traditional voice and
data services. As a prelude, Inmarsat started Regional BGAN at the end of 2002
with transponder capacity leased from Thuraya (described below). This service has
data rates to 144 Kb/s and is available in the coverage area of Thuraya spacecraft.
The communication payload requires a powerful satellite platform, capable of
providing the required DC power (10–12 kW) and other resources. Inmarsat 4, like
prior Inmarsat generations, uses L-band for links between the satellite and large,
ﬁxed gateway stations. The satellite has a 9-m diameter L-band reﬂector used for
both transmission and reception. This antenna consists of 120-element feed on the
adjacent face of the satellite body, to form up to 228 spot beams that cover Earth. In
addition, for compatibility with Inmarsat 3 satellites there is a global coverage beam
and a 19-beam array of wide spots that cover Earth, both in L-band. The satellite
also has a dual-polarization Earth coverage C-band antenna beam. Each satellite has
the capacity of 630 channels each with a data rate up to 432 Kb/s. Onboard pro-
cessing can dynamically reassign channels among the beams to satisfy user
requests.
Inmarsat 4 has a two-channel navigation payload, each with wider bandwidth
than the single channel on Inmarsat 3. Navigation data are transmitted to the
satellite at C-band and transmitted from it on two frequencies. These signals aug-
ment GPS and other navigation satellite systems by transmitting integrity and
correction data that can improve the accuracy of users’ position determination.
Other information about Inmarsat 4 is as follows.

Projected Inmarsat-5 GEO Satellite Communication Repeater
Inmarsat’s ﬁrst wholly owned satellites, the Inmarsat-2, were launched in the early
1990 s, and the Inmarsat-3 as the ﬁrst generation to use spot beam technology
followed later in the decade, both of these spacecrafts are spare or still operational.
The new constellation of the Inmarsat-4 set a new benchmark for MSC in terms of

their power, capacity, and ﬂexibility. In fact, one Inmarsat-4 satellite is 60 times
more powerful than an Inmarsat-3 and its constellation series is expected to con-
tinue in commercial operation until about 2020.
In the meantime, Inmarsat has entered into agreement with ESA to become the
commercial operator of a new satellite called Alphasat. The satellite is part of an
ESA initiative to develop a new spacecraft platform capable of carrying onboard a
large communications payload. Accordingly, Alphasat is scheduled for completion
in 2012 and to supplement the existing I-4 satellites. It will provide service over
Europe, the Middle East, and Africa.
On the other side, in 2010 Inmarsat satellite organization has contracted the US
aerospace manufacturer Boeing to build a new constellation of Inmarsat-5 satellites
as a part of a new 1.2 billion US $ worldwide wireless broadband network called
Inmarsat Global Xpress™. Boeing will construct three Inmarsat-5 (I-5) satellites
based on its 702HP spacecraft platform. The ﬁrst is scheduled for completion in
2013, with full global coverage expected by the end of 2014.
The spacecraft will break new ground by transmitting in a portion of the radio
spectrum never before utilized by the commercial operator of a global satellite
system and with the extremely high-frequency Ka-band transponder for the ﬁrst
time. Accordingly, each ﬁfth generation of Inmarsat-5 will carry a payload of 89
Ka-band beams capable of ﬂexing capacity across the globe and enabling Inmarsat
to adapt to shifting subscriber usage patterns over their projected lifetime of
15 years.
2.4.3.4
Globalstar Big LEO Satellite Communication Repeater
The Globalstar satellite uses a simple transparent repeater rather than a digital
onboard processor such as that being ﬂown on Iridium. Figure 2.25 shows a block
diagram of the Globalstar communication payload and a phased array antenna with
16 spot beams, which provides gain and a degree of frequency reuse. This space-
craft is a 3-axis stabilized platform with the Earth-facing panel always parallel to the
orbit tangent. All transmissions are relayed at C-band (7/5 GHz) through GES
terminals that track the satellites as they pass near by in LOS. However, this
condition places a constraint that a given LEO satellite must simultaneously see
both the mobile user at L/S-bands and the GES at C-band.
Through a relationship with Qualcomm, Inc., Globalstar provides service using
of the CDMA cellular standard. A GPS onboard receiver is used to accurately
determine the orbit parameters and also to supply accurate time and frequency to
the satellite systems. The attitude control system uses small, one Newton, thrusters
for onboard attitude control. At this point, yaw steering is employed to provide
sufﬁcient solar array power during all phases of mission. Solar panel and a large
nickel–hydrogen battery provide power for all phases of the mission. However
battery recharge takes place where satellite is moving over the oceans, there is less
trafﬁc with mobile users.

2.4.3.5
Iridium Big LEO Satellite Communication Repeater
Iridium, such as Globalstar, as Big LEO satellite system, provides too much useless
coverage of the ocean regions, resulting in less effective capacity over land areas
than can be obtained with either a MEO or a GEO strategy. Without intersatellite
links, LEO satellite cannot serve users out on the oceans since an operating GES
must simultaneously be in view. Globalstar has not this facility, but this is in
contrast to Iridium’s ability to serve users no matter where on or above the planet
they may be located by employing intersatellite links.
The Iridium satellite bus presented in Fig. 2.26 is adapted on the satellite’s Earth
face, which integrates communication and other types of antennas, crosslink arrays,
secondary payload, and other parts. The secondary payload envelope reserved is
300 × 400 × 700 mm, the two larger dimensions being aligned with the Earth
face, the single largest dimension being aligned with the y-axis. While traveling on
its orbit, the satellite keeps its z-axis pointed toward the center of the Earth and its
velocity vector is aligned with the x-axis. The ﬁeld of view of the secondary
payload is a 75° half-cone opening at its top and center, and pointing toward the
nadir (+Z). It is clear of any obstruction.
2.4.3.6
Diagram of VSAT GEO Satellite Communication Repeater
As stated earlier, a transparent payload makes no distinction between uplink carrier
and uplink noise, and both signals are forwarded to the downlink. Therefore, at the
Fig. 2.25 Diagram of Globalstar spacecraft transponders—Courtesy of Paper: by Dietrich
2.4
Spacecraft SubSystems
149

Earth station receiver, one gets the downlink noise together with the uplink-
retransmitted noise.
However, a regenerative payload entails onboard demodulation to process of the
uplink carriers. Onboard regeneration is most conveniently performed on digital
carriers. The bit stream obtained from demodulation of a given uplink carrier is then
used to modulate a new carrier at downlink frequency. This carrier is noise-free;
hence, a regenerative payload does not retransmit the uplink noise on the downlink.
The overall link quality is therefore improved.
Moreover, intermodulation noise can be avoided, as the satellite Channel
Ampliﬁer (CA) is no longer requested to operate in a multicarrier mode. Indeed,
several bit streams at the output of various demodulators can be combined into a
Time Division Multiplex (TDM), which modulates a single high-rate downlink
carrier. However, this carrier is ampliﬁed by the CA section, which can be operated
at saturation without generating intermodulation noise, as the carrier it ampliﬁes is
unique. This concept of VSAT Satellite transponder is illustrated in Fig. 2.27.
It should be emphasized that today’s commercial satellites that can be used for
VSAT services are not equipped with regenerative payloads but only with trans-
parent ones. Only a few experimental satellites such as NASA’s Advanced
Communications Technology Satellite (ACTS) and the Italian ITALSAT satellite
have incorporated a regenerative payload, but they are no longer in operation. Some
satellites of the EUTELSAT ﬂeet are equipped with a regenerative payload
(Skyplex) but can be used only by Earth stations operating according to the DVB-S
standard.

Satellite Navigation Repeaters for GNSS
The new generations of modern GEO satellites can augment the performance of the
US GPS and Russia GLONASS by providing a separate ranging channel to transmit
integrity and correction data. In fact, this concept dates back to the late eighties and
has evolved to its current form known as Regional Satellite Augmentation System
(RSAS).
In this book, the use of the ICAO known nomination Satellite-based Augmentation
System (SBAS), which appear in the world classiﬁcation of the acronyms, will be
replaced by the Regional Satellite Augmentation System (RSAS) as more convenient
nomenclature.
The RSAS complementary information processed in any Master station is dif-
fused by GEO satellite by means of a pseudo-GPS or GLONASS signals and covers
a wide regional or geographical area integrated in Global Satellite Augmentation
System (GSAS). The RSAS data will allow satellite navigation to meet the stringent
reliability and other requirements set by authorities for Air Trafﬁc Control
(ATC) and Maritime Trafﬁc Control (MTC). Land users, such as road and railways,
will also be able to take advantage of the improvements in positioning accuracy.
However, augmented GNSS-1 solutions of RSAS were recently developed to
improve the mentioned deﬁciencies of current GPS and GLONASS military

and to

the

civilian
requirements for
high-operating integrity, continuity, accuracy, and availability (ICAA).
The three current RSAS networks, the US Wide Area Augmentation System
(WAAS), the European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS), and
the Japanese MTSAT Satellite-based Augmentation System (MSAS) are using
Inmarsat, Artemis, and MTSAT GEO constellations, respectively. The GSAS
network worldwide will require additional GEO spacecraft to provide the necessary
coverage, availability, and improved continuity of service. In response to this need,
Inmarsat has already embarked the new navigation transponder to support RSAS
functions on its current generation of GEO Inmarsat-4 satellite shown in Fig. 2.28,
which is a modern development to provide new broadband services.
In additional, WAAS is leasing transponders on two GEO spacecraft, such as the
Canadian Telsat Anik F1R and PanAmSat Galaxy XV, EGNOS is using Inmarsat-4
and Artemis constellation and MSAT system is employing own GEO spacecraft of
MTSAT series.
2.4.4.1
Inmarsat-4 Navigation Payload
The ﬁrst GNSS transponder was installed in the payload of Inmarsat-3 spacecraft
providing RSAS service until 2005.
The current EGNOS space constellation is composed of two leased transponder
hosts of the Inmarsat-4 AORE and IOR, and one ESA Artemis GEO spacecraft. The
Inmarsat-4 hosts a navigation payload capable of transmitting RSAS information on
both the GPS L1 and the L5 frequencies via GES to the mobile users. Therefore,
this payload will transmit satellite navigation signals and allow the real-time relay
from a single-ground-monitoring network of integrity and accuracy augmentation
data for orbiting GNSS. A functional diagram of the Inmarsat-4 satellite is shown in
Fig. 2.28 Diagram of Inmarsat-4 Navigation (GNSS) transponder—Courtesy of Article: by

Space Segment

Fig. 2.26. This payload is a dual-channel bent-pipe transponder that converts two
C-band (C1 and C5) uplink signals from one GES to two downlink signals in two
separate bands with the following characteristics:
1. Bandwidth Limitations—A 4.0 MHz-wide C1 band uplink channel will be
relayed in the L1 downlink channel and allow the transmission of the RSAS L1
signal. A 20.0 MHz-wide C5 band uplink channel will be relayed in the L5
downlink channel and allow the transmission of the newly deﬁned L5 RSAS signal.
The system has not allocated 24 MHz of bandwidth at both frequencies, but the
design included extra spectrum necessary to uplink the newly deﬁned signal at L5
and that left only 4 MHz available at L1, still more than what was provided by
Inmarsat-3.
2. Transponders—The Inmarsat-4 communication and navigation transponders
share both the C-band broadband receiver and the Frequency Generator Unit, while
the two channels (C1-L1 and C5-L5) share hardware until after ﬁltering at IF. The
uplink channels are frequency-translated, using coherent translation oscillators
(derived from a common master oscillator), to the corresponding L1 and L5
downlink channels. The navigation uplink signals are downconverted with the same
local oscillator (LO7) to a suitable IF and then split into two signal paths where the
appropriate channel bandwidths are applied. The two signals are then upconverted
into the ﬁnal output frequency (L1 and L5) and fed to the L-band HPA unit before
transmission to the dedicated navigation antenna providing global coverage. Both
channels have independent telecommandable gain adjustment. All signal paths
through the navigation transponder are cold redundant.
3. Broadcast Power—The payload broadcast power will be 28.1 dBW at L1
and 26.2 dBW at L5 in a global coverage antenna beam. The output power at the L1
frequency has been designed to assure the payload would be capable of delivering
the necessary power as required by the ICAO Standards and Recommended
Practices (SARP) for an RSAS signal. The EIRP output of 26.2 dBW at L5 will
permit the user and receiver to receive the same level of radiated power it receives
at L1, taking into consideration the smaller free-space loss at L5 frequency. The
transponder is expected to accommodate only one signal per channel, which means
that the speciﬁed broadcast powers are saturated values.
4. Navigation Performance—The overall ranging and navigation performance
of the RSAS signal through a bent-pipe repeater is inﬂuenced not only by the
satellite repeater characteristics, but also by the supporting ground signal generator
and timing system. Unlike GPS satellites, Inmarsat navigation payloads do not
generate the signal. Rather, their “clock” is on the ground and the signal is gen-
erated there. Hence, a closed-loop control system is necessary in order to make the
ranging signal appear as if it is originated on board the GEO satellite by com-
pensating for the uplink delay contribution due to the ionosphere, Doppler shift and
the frequency offset induced by the GEO transponder itself.
In other words, the ﬁnal aim was to have the signal broadcast by the transponder
resemble a GPS signal. In particular, the closed-loop control system must be cap-
able of maintaining signal code/carrier coherence; that is, the code-chipping rate
(1.023 MHz of GPS C/A code) and carrier frequency (L1) must be kept in the
2.4
Spacecraft SubSystems
153

constant ratio of 1:1540 as it happens in the GPS signals. This requirement allows
GPS receivers to improve the accuracy of their ranging measurements and ICAO
has included it in the SBAS signal speciﬁcation.
5. Transponder Control—In the past, Inmarsat sponsored the development of
signal generators and receivers to demonstrate achievable performance and to
perform validation testing of the Inmarsat-3 payloads, both prior to and after
launch. Inmarsat-4 navigation signals, like those for Inmarsat-3 satellite, will
require a proper control of the signal code and carrier: This time the challenge will
be to maintain a proper code/carrier coherence on both L1 and L5 signals. The
navigation satellite transponder control will be realized through the Ground Uplink
System (GUS) at a GNSS GES terminal. Inmarsat plans to design and develop
prototype onboard equipment for proper navigation signal generation and control
that will be used for the ground and in-orbit test campaign in order to conduct
end-to-end system tests.
2.4.4.2
Artemis Navigation Payload
The aim of the Artemis payload illustrated in Fig. 2.29 was the same as GNSS
payload of Artemis spacecraft, namely to provide an overlay function with sup-
plementary services to the current operating GPS and GLONASS constellation.
This kind of services uses existing GEO communications satellite to transmit
overlay signals to provide improvement of accuracy, system’s integrity data, and
wide area differential corrections.
The Artemis Navigation (GNSS) satellite payload is caring transparent
transponder capable to receive a signal from a European coverage and to translate it
onto two separate downlink carriers, the ﬁrst operating at L-band (L1) and the
second one at Ku-band (channel F2), which is illustrated in Fig. 2.30.

Space Segment

The signal transmitted from the ground is a single 500 b/s carrier modulated with
timing, integrity, ranging, and other information and spread with a PN code, a type
compatible to those used for GPS. The code orthogonality properties assure the
possibility to transmit the GNSS signal on the same nominal carrier frequency of
the GPS and GLONASS.
The uplink signal is received at 13.875 GHz by a Ku-band antenna and ﬁltered
by the input multiplexer, which separates the incoming communication signal from
the NOS signal and to reduce interference. This ﬁlter is mounted directly on the
spacecraft top ﬂoor. The input signal is divided into two paths and translated;
therefore, the heart of the payload performing this function is the CA module. At
this point, the low-noise ampliﬁcation mode is mainly performed by the Ku-band
receiver (KRx), which provides a noise ﬁgure of 2.3 dB and a gain of about 53 dB.
The signal is then fed into the Ku-band channel ﬁlter. Realized using high Q
waveguide dielectric resonator, it gives only 10 nSec of group delay variation into
the useful bandwidth of 4 MHz. The signal feeds the CA element at the output of
the channel ﬁlter. The unit splits the signal into two paths: One feed the Ku-band
transmit section without RF conversion while the other is downconverted to the
GPS frequency. The two CA output signals are ampliﬁed by two SSPA components
providing 16 watts end of life. All the RF units use latest technologies (hybrids,
MMIC, MCM) both for the RF portion and for the control and interface functions.
1. Ku-band Rx—The KRx unit provides low-noise ampliﬁcation and down-
conversion of signals at RF of 13.855-13.895 GHz down to 12.728-12.768 GHz,
by means of a net subtraction of an externally generated LO frequency. The
equipment is provided with an internal power supply and a command and telemetry
interface. The signal is then ampliﬁed in a linear ampliﬁer. Thus, group delay,

phase, AM/PM conversion, and gain are speciﬁed as required by GNSS payload
performances analysis. The unit is internally redundant and includes a redundant
DC/DC converter to derive the required secondary voltages from the satellite main
bus. The input interface is WR75 standard, and the LO input and the RF output
interfaces are SMA 50 O. The key technologies characterizing the units are: MMIC
to achieve reduction of dimensions and mass and a high level of reproducibility; RF
hybrid technique to house both MW and low frequency analog/digital integrated
circuits; and application-speciﬁc integrated circuit (ASIC) for control and TM/TC
interface functions.
A IF bandpass ﬁlter provides suppression of out-of-band mixing products. The
rest of the IF section is composed of a cascade of different MMIC circuits which
provide the required gain and gain control dynamic. The ﬁrst gain stage is an
MMIC LNA as the one above described: The large passband of the MMIC allows
use on the IF section as well, in order for it to have negligible contribution to the
overall noise ﬁgure. The MESFET process has been used for the MMIC units
following in the IF chain. The Flatness Corrector (FC) circuit gives the possibility
to control the gain slope variation consequent to the complete system assembling
and possible slope variations over temperature. The gain control block is the
variable gain ampliﬁer (VGA), which is composed of three self-biased stages of
ampliﬁcation with an embedded analog attenuator, allowing compensation of gain
drift over temperature of the complete assembly. The analog attenuator design was
based on a broadband-extended T conﬁguration using cold FET units. This
approach was chosen because of its minimal VSWR variation and ﬂat gain response
over the attenuation range. A medium power ampliﬁer (MPA) is used as the output
stage in order to have higher output level and better linearity. The circuit design is
single-ended and consists of a two-stage ampliﬁer. Output FET gate periphery was
selected to achieve a 32 dBm third-order intercept point while keeping the channel
temperature below 110 °C when in maximum environmental temperature.
2. Channel Ampliﬁer (CA)—This unit is used to amplify the signal to a level
suitable to drive the power ampliﬁer. It can be set into two operational modes: a)
Nominal operation of ampliﬁer level control (ALC) mode is settable by means of
ground command to different levels. In fact, the ALC loop maintains the output
power level within the speciﬁed limits recovering uplink variations and input signal
dynamic; and ﬁxed gain mode, when ALC is off, is the ampliﬁer provides a ﬁxed
gain set by ground command.
The CA unit is in general redundant and equipped with internal DC/DC con-
verter and provides two different outputs: L1 at a frequency of 1575.42 MHz,
generated by means an external local oscillator, and F2 at a frequency of
12748 MHz (no conversion is required). As in the Ku-band RX, also in CA hybrid
circuits are used to realize the RF channels and the digital control circuits. The
following modules compose the unit: two complete Ku-band CA modules (main
and redundant); two Ku/L-band RF downconverter including CA module func-
tionality (main and redundant); redundant DC/DC converter; and couplers for
redundancy and channels splitting.

Space Segment

3. Solid-State Ampliﬁer (SSA)—The SSA module is used for high-power
ampliﬁcation of L-band downlink signal. This unit, manufactured by the UK MMS
company, now Astrium UK), consists of: an ampliﬁer module in which high-power
RF ampliﬁcation and power generation occur; an electronic power conditioner
(EPC) which accepts primary bus from the spacecraft and generates the required
secondary stabilized voltages.
4. RF Generator (RFG)—This unit generates two frequencies at L- and
X-bands using a 10.0 MHz reference signal coming from the external USO. In the
Artemis implementation, the onboard USO has been used. The unit consisting of
the navigation RFG plus the 10 MHz reference has been speciﬁed as a whole, in
terms of performance; however, the RFG and the 10 MHz USO are mechanically
separated in order to maintain the qualiﬁcation of the assembly achieved on Artemis
for the RFG, on SICRAL, and on UHF spacecraft update programs for the 10 MHz
ultra-stable oscillator (USO). The RFG output frequencies are 1127 MHz and
11172.58 MHz. Direct synthesis approach is used: Multiplication is obtained using
active stages and step recovery diodes. At this point, quartz and helical ﬁlters are
used to reduce spurs and phase noise to levels within the speciﬁcation.
2.4.4.3
MTSAT Navigation Payload
The Japanese GNSS payload is integrated together with meteorological payload
onboard series of GEO Multifunctional Transport Satellite (MTSAT). The MTSAT
GNSS payload is the forerunner of a family of GNSS payloads able to fulﬁll
augmentation system for Japan and surrounded areas allowing interoperability
among the different systems.
The MTSAT-1R spacecraft launched in February 2005 replaced unsuccessful
MTSAT-1, which was destroyed in a launch failure in 1999. Air trafﬁc commu-
nications will use the L-band and the AMSS protocol, which is speciﬁc to mobile
satellite communications. Links between the Earth segment and satellite segment
will use the Ku- and Ka-band.
This advanced GEO satellite has rideshare payloads that play a critical role in the
next generation of the Japanese satellite-enhanced air trafﬁc management systems and
weather forecasting. The aeronautical payload is a natural improvement on the pre-
viously designed MTSAT-1 payload. A new state-of-the-art digital processor facili-
tates communication link frequency adjustments that may be required by international
coordination agreements after MTSAT-1R is put into service. It also facilitates efﬁ-
cient use of the allocated frequency spectrum and improves transponder performance.
2.4.5
Repeaters for Stratospheric Platform Systems (SPS)
The SPS or high-altitude platform (HPA) transponder shown in Fig. 2.31 illustrates
a block diagram of a typical onboard architecture, which together with its associated
2.4
Spacecraft SubSystems
157

antenna subsystem would make a complete communications payload. In this case,
SPS transponder has a bandwidth of 500 MHz using Code Division Multiple
Access (CDMA) scheme. This transponder can accommodate up to 50 antenna
beams with eight wideband carriers (assuming a carrier bandwidth of 1.25 MHz
each). For the uplink, the carriers are received by the platform antenna subsystem
and ampliﬁed by a LNA.
The bandwidth of these carriers is limited to only 10 MHz using passband ﬁlters,
and multiplexed using Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM). Before these
multiplexed signals are transmitted to the ground station, they are ampliﬁed further
by a HPA stage, ﬁltered and multiplexed. For the downlink, the process is similar
but in the reverse direction, and instead of a multiplexer, a demultiplexer is used
[ITU-F1500, 00].
Other transponder components play a very important role in the system per-
formance, and their design and selection should not be underestimated. Thus, the
LNA element having low-noise temperature and sufﬁcient gain, ensure that noise
contributions from the succeeding stages are kept small. Frequency converters serve
as frequency-change devices (also known as mixers), which either upconvert or
downconvert the signals in the SCP to differentiate between uplink and downlink.
Noise performance is also important for these frequency converters, although not as
critical as the noise ﬁgure for the LNA, since this is the ﬁrst element in the frontend
and therefore, is the one that contributes most to the overall noise. IF processors
have the main functions of providing most of transponder gain, deﬁning a fre-
quency
response
of
each
channel
and,
whenever
required,
performing
beam-to-beam routing functions. Filters are in charge of limiting adjacent spurious
signals as well as noise that can be generated by the payload itself. Their design is
crucial for the performance of the communications payload. Transmitters are in
charge of amplifying the signals to the level required for downlink transmissions.
Examples of well-known transmitters used for satellite communications are the
TWT and power transistors, the latter used for speciﬁc applications in lower

frequency bands. Payload system performance or performance parameters of
individual equipments need to be speciﬁed so that the required SCP payload per-
formance is achieved by the following important parameters:
1. Antenna Coverage Area—Since antenna gain and SCP coverage are related to
antenna dimensions, antenna electrical efﬁciency and antenna feeder losses;
2. Figure of Merit G/T—Since this parameter as ratio of the receive antenna gain

5. Isolation Between Channels—It reduces potential adjacent channel interfer-
ence issues;
6. Spurious Outputs—Reduce interference levels to other contiguous wireless
systems;
7. Ampliﬁer Linearity—Since nonlinearities produce intermodulation products
that can leak into the passband of other equipment, causing interference; and
8. Group Delay Variation—Is the time delay experienced by the modulation
waveform in passing through the equipment, causing signal dispersion and
performance degradation.
2.4.6
Satellite Antenna System for MSC
The antenna array system of Inmarsat-2 satellite for MSC is shown in Fig. 2.32
(Left). The antenna system mounted on the spacecraft structure, similar to the
transponders, is composed of two main integrated elements: the C/L-band and the
L/C-band antenna.
1. Inmarsat-2 C/L-band Arrays—This uplink is actually the feeder link, which
operates in the 6 GHz RF range. The signals sent by LES are detected by a C-band
receiving array, comprising seven cup-dipole elements in the smallest circle. On the
other hand, the L-band transmit antenna is the biggest segment of the whole system,
consisting of 43 individual dipole elements, arranged in three rings around a single
central element. Thus, this antenna is providing near-global coverage service
downlink for MES in the 1.5 GHz RF spectrums.
2. Inmarsat-2 L/C-band Arrays—These arrays are actually the service uplink
and operates in the 1.6 GHz RF range. The signals sent by MES in adjacent global
coverage region are detected by L-band receiving array, comprising nine cup-dipole
elements arranged in a circle. Finally, the C-band transmit antenna consists of seven
cup-dipoles for radiation of the feeder downlink to LES in the 3.6 GHz RF
spectrum.

2.4.6.1
Characteristics of Satellite Antennas
Both transmit antenna array systems are providing a global (wide) footprint on the
Earth’s surface. However, narrow circular beams from GEO or non-GEO can be
used to provide spot beam coverage. For instance, from GEO the Earth subtends an
angle of 17.4°. Antenna beams 5.8° wide can reuse three frequency bands twice in
providing Earth disk coverage. The directional properties of antenna arrays can be
exploited to permit RF reuse in space communications, which is similar to several
radio stations using the same RF being geographically far apart.
Earth coverage by seven spot beams (six spots are set out around one spot in the
center) can be arranged by three pairs of beams: 1 and 4, 2 and 5, and 3 and 6,
operating on frequencies f2, f3, and f4, respectively. Mutual interference within pairs
is avoided by pointing one beam as far away from the other as possible. Satellite
antenna coverage of the center of the disk is provided by a single-beam operating on
frequency f1. Thus, the main advantage with this satellite spot footprint that is
speciﬁc Earth areas can be covered more accurately than with wide beams.
Furthermore, a greater power density per unit area for a given input power can be
achieved very well, when compared with that produced by a global circular beam,
leading to the use of much smaller receiving MES antennas. The equation that
determines received power (PR) is proportional to the power transmitted (PT)
separated by a distance (R), with gain of transmit antenna (GT) and effective area of
receiving antenna (AR) and inversely proportional to 4π and square of distance. The
relations for PR and GT are represented as follows:
PR ¼ PTGTAR=4pR2
GT ¼ 4p AT=k2
ð2:46Þ

where GT = effective area of transmit antenna and λ = wavelength. The product of
PT and GT is gain, generally as an increase in signal power, known as an
EIRP. Signal or carrier power received in a link is proportional to the gain of the

is the ﬁgure of merit and K = Boltzmann’s Constant (1.38 × 10−23 J/K or its
alternatively value is –228.6 dBW/K/Hz).
At any rate, PR has a minimum allowable value compared with system noise
power (N); that is, the Carrier and Noise (C/N) or Signal and Noise (S/N) ratio must
exceed a certain value. This may be achieved by a trade-off between EIRP (PT GT)
and received antenna gain (GR). If the receive antenna on the satellite is very
efﬁcient, the demands on the LES/MES are minimized. Similarly, on the
satellite-to-Earth link, the higher the gain of the satellite transmit antenna, the
greater the EIRP for a given transmitter power. Satellites often have parabolic dish
antennas, though there are also other types, such as phased arrays. The principal
property of a parabolic reﬂector is its ability to turn light from a point source placed
at its focus into a parallel beam, mostly as illustrated in Fig. 2.32 (Right). In
practice the beam can never be truly parallel, because rays can also be fan-shaped;
i.e., a car headlamp is a typical example. In a microwave antenna, the light source is
replaced by the antenna feed, which directs waves toward the reﬂector. The length
of all paths from feed to aperture plane via the reﬂector is constant, irrespective of
their angle of parabolic axis. The phase of the wave in the aperture plane is con-
stant, resulting in maximum efﬁciency and gain. The gain of an aperture (Ga) and
parabolic (Gp) type of antennas are as follows:
Ga ¼ g 4p A=k2



Gyps ¼ g pD
ð
Þ2=k2
ð2:49Þ
where η = efﬁciency factor, A = projected aperture area of antenna, AE = ηA is the
effective collecting area, and D = parabolic antenna diameter. Thus, owing to
correlation between frequency and wavelength, f = c/λ is given in the following
relations:
Gp ¼ gðp D f=cÞ2 ¼ 60; 7ðD fÞ2
ð2:50Þ
2.4

where the second relation comes from considering that η ≈0.55 of numerical
value. If this value is presented in decibels, then the gain of antenna will be
calculated as follows:
GT ¼ 10 log Gp
ð2:51Þ
For example, a parabolic antenna of 2 m in diameter has a gain of 36 dB for a
frequency at 4 GHz and a gain of 38 dB for a frequency at 6 GHz. Parabolic
antennas can have aperture planes that are circular, elliptical, or rectangular in
shape. Thus, antenna with circular shape and homogeneous illumination of aperture
with a gain of –3 dB has about 47.5 % of effective radiation, and the rest of the
power is lost. To ﬁnd out the ideal characteristics, it is necessary to determine the
function diagram of radiation in the following way:
F do
ð
Þ ¼ s do
ð
Þ=s do ¼ 0
ð
Þ
ð2:52Þ
where parameter s (δo) = ﬂow density of radiation in the hypothetical satellite angle
(δo) and s (δo = 0) = ﬂow density in the middle of the coverage area. Looking the
geometrical relations in Fig. 2.2a follows the relation:
F do
ð
Þ ¼ do=h ¼ cos dp k2 sin2 do



ð2:53Þ
where, as mentioned, k = R/(R + h) = sin δ and if δo = δ, the relation is deﬁned by
the following equation:
F d
ð Þ ¼ k cos d
ð2:54Þ
For GEO satellite, the value of ΔL is given as a function of angle δ, which is the
distance from the center of the coverage area, where the function diagram of the
radiation is as follows:
F d
ð Þ ¼ DL ¼ 20 log ¼ 20 log R= R þ h
ð
Þ cos d ¼ 10 log R= 1 þ 2R=h
ð


ð2:55Þ
Therefore, in the case of GEO satellites the losses of antenna propagation are
greater around the periphery than in the center of the coverage area for about
1.32 dB. The free-space propagation loss (LP) and the input level of received
signals (LK) are given by the equations:
LP ¼ 4p d=k
ð
Þ2
PR=S ¼ PTGT=4pd2LK
ð2:56Þ
The free-space propagation loss is caused by geometrical attenuation during
propagation from the transmitter to the receiver.

Link Performance with Monobeam and Multibeam Antenna
Coverage
As stated earlier, the most important parameter of spacecraft transponder and the
overall RF link quality depends on the gain of the satellite antenna. From
Eq. (2.47), it can be seen that the satellite antenna gain is constrained by its
beamwidth, whatever the frequency at which the link is operated. So the antenna
gain is imposed by the angular width of the antenna beam covering the zone to be
served. If the service zone is covered using a single-antenna beam, this is referred to
as single or monobeam beam coverage, which displays one of these characteristics:
• The satellite may provide coverage of the whole region of the Earth, which is
visible from the satellite as a global coverage and thus permits long-distance
links to be established, for example from one continent to another with 20 dB
bandwidth. In this case, the gain of the satellite antenna is limited by its
beamwidth as imposed by the coverage.
• The satellite may provide coverage of only part of the Earth (a region or
country) by means of a narrow beam (a zone or spot beam), with 3 dB beam-
width of the order of 1° to a few degrees.
With a single-beam satellite antenna coverage, it will be therefore necessary to
choose between either extended coverage providing service with reduced quality of
service to geographically dispersed GES terminals, or with reduced coverage
providing service with improved quality of transmission and reception to selected
geographically concentrated GES terminals.
Multibeam satellite antenna coverage allows these two alternatives to be rec-
onciled. Thus, satellite extended coverage may be achieved by means of the jux-
taposition of several narrow-beam antenna coverages, so in such a way, each beam
provides an antenna gain that increases as the satellite antenna beamwidth decreases
(reduced coverage per beam). The satellite link performance improves as the
number of beams increases, which limit can be determined by the antenna tech-
nology, whose complexity increases with the number of beams and the mass.
The complexity originates in the more elaborate satellite antenna technology and
the requirement to provide onboard interconnection of the coverage areas, so as to
ensure within the satellite payload routing of the various carriers that are unlinked in
different beams to any wanted destination beam.
In Fig. 2.33 (Left) is illustrated satellite that provides global coverage with a
single beam (monobeam) of beamwidth and in Fig. 2.33 (Right) is illustrated that
satellite supports spot beams with beamwidth of a consequently reduced coverage,
known as multibeam satellite coverage. In both cases, all GES terminals in the
satellite network are within the correspondent satellite coverage or in LOS with
satellite. Multibeam coverage is providing the following advantages:

implementation losses. At this point, this equation becomes (all terms in dB):

This relation is represented for the two cases considered transmitter:
• Global

(θ3

which

(θ3 dB)2 ≈20 dBi.
• Spot beam coverage (θ3
dB = 1.75°), which implies (GT)satellite = 29 000/
(θ3 dB)2 ≈40 dBi.
In case that values indicate the reduction in (EIRP)station and (G/T)station, the
transmission system is changing from a satellite with global coverage to a multi-
beam satellite with coverage by several spot beams. In this case, the multibeam
satellite permits an economy of size and, hence, cost of the Earth segment. For
instance, a 20 dB reduction of (EIRP)station and (G/T)station may result in a tenfold
reduction of the antenna size (perhaps from 30 m to 3 m) with a cost reduction for
the GES terminal for more than 100 times. If an identical GES is retained (a vertical
displacement toward the top), an increase of C/N0 is achieved which can be
transferred to an increase of capacity, if sufﬁcient bandwidth is available, at con-
stant signal quality in terms of Bit Error Rate (BER).
2. Frequency Reuse—Frequency reuse consists of using the same frequency
band several times in such a way as to increase the total capacity of the network
without increasing the allocated bandwidth (B). In the case of a multibeam satellite,
the isolation resulting from antenna directivity can be exploited to reuse the same
frequency band in separate beam coverages. The frequency reuse factor is deﬁned
as the number of times that the bandwidth is used. In theory, a multibeam satellite
with M single-polarization antenna beams, each being allocated the bandwidth,
combines reuse by angular separation and reuse by orthogonal polarization may
have a frequency reuse factor equal to 2 M. This signiﬁes that it can claim the
capacity which would be offered by a single-beam satellite with single polarization
using a bandwidth of M × B. In practice, the frequency reuse factor depends on the
conﬁguration of the service area which determines the coverage before it is pro-
vided by the satellite. If the service area consists of several widely separated regions
(for example, urban areas separated by extensive rural areas), it is possible to reuse
the same band in all beams. The frequency reuse factor can then attain the theo-
retical value of M. Figure 2.31 shows an example of multibeam coverage.
On
the
other
hand,
multibeam
coverage
is
providing
the
following
disadvantages:
1. Interference Between Beams—In practical reality, the interference genera-
tion within a multibeam satellite system is called self-interference. Thus, the effect
of self-interference appears as an increase in thermal noise under the same condi-
tions as interference noise between systems. At this point, it must be included the
term (C/N0)1, which expresses the signal power in relation to the spectral density
interference. Taking account of the multiplicity of sources of interference, which
become more numerous as the number of beams increases, relatively low values of
2.4
Spacecraft SubSystems
165

(C/N0)1 may be achieved and the contribution of this term impairs the performance
in terms of (C/N0)T of the total link. As modern satellite systems tend to re-use
frequency as much as possible to increase capacity, self-interference noise in a
multibeam satellite link may contribute up to 50 % of the total noise.
2. Interference Between Coverage Areas—A satellite payload using multi-
beam coverage must be in a position to interconnect all network Earth stations and
consequently must provide interconnection of coverage areas. The complexity of
the payload is added to that of the multibeam satellite antenna subsystem, which is
already much more complex than that of a single-beam satellite. Different tech-
niques, depending on the onboard processing capability (no processing, transparent
processing, regenerative processing, etc.) and on the network layer, are considered
for interconnection of coverage:
• Interconnection by transponder hopping (no onboard processing);
• Interconnection by onboard switching (transparent and regenerative processing);
and
• Interconnection by beam scanning.
Multibeam satellite systems make it possible to reduce the size of GES terminal
and hence the cost of the Earth segment infrastructure. Frequency reuse from one
satellite beams to another permits an increase in capacity without increasing the
bandwidth allocated to the system. However, interference between adjacent satellite
channels, which occurs between beams using the same frequencies, limits the
potential capacity increase, particularly as interference is greater with Earth stations
equipped with small antennas.
The simplest form of a payload with multibeam antenna radiation is shown in
Fig. 2.34. A three-transponder payload uses one transponder per coverage circle. At
this point, there is not connectivity between coverage areas in this simple
transponder. However, this payload could be designed so each transponder antenna
illuminates three coverage circles and provide connectivity, but would cover three
times area with just one-third the gain.

Space Segment

The relatively simple changes to multiple small satellite antenna beams have the
following signiﬁcant consequences as follows:
(a) The area covered by each beam is much smaller, increasing the antenna gain
and allowing smaller, less expensive ground terminals;
(b) The same total RF power can be used to carry more trafﬁc, and/or reduce the
RF power;
(c) The same transponder bandwidth can be used multiple beam antenna, greatly
increasing the available bandwidth of the satellite:
1. This allow the same bandwidth to be reused, increasing the amount that
can be accommodated within the bandwidth; and
2. A terminal has to be tuned to the correct RF to function and retuned if it is
moved.
(d) Connectivity between beams, if required for the mission, must be provided by
additional hardware on the satellite since a single uplink does not encompass
the entire coverage area.
The beams may be formed by individual feeds (circles) and by mechanical or
electronic beam former. Mechanical beam formers use ﬁxed wave-guide compo-
nents to control the RF phase and amplitude. Usually there is one ampliﬁer for each
transponder in each composite beam. Electronic beam formers use electronic RF
phase shifters, and sometimes electronic amplitude control, to produce the multi-
beam. There are many radiating elements and each usually has its own ampliﬁer.
Antenna radiators fall into two categories, reﬂector and direct radiating antennas.
Reﬂector antenna uses a feed that indirectly radiates the energy toward the illu-
minated area of users, while direct radiating antenna radiates the energy direct to the
coverage area. The spot beam antenna can be pointed in various directions within a
cone characterized by the scan angle, shown in Fig. 2.35. In this way, a direct
radiating array can radiate at large scan as illustrated in Fig. 2.35. Such arrays are

2.4
Spacecraft SubSystems
167

attractive for LEO communications satellites because they operate over large scan
angle than reﬂectors antenna, so they require a scan angle of 63° to cover its ﬁeld of
view. In contrary, a GEO communications satellite requires a scan angle of 7° to
cover the entire visible circle on the Earth.
In addition to the fact that satellite antenna gain decreases as the scan angle
increases, and polarization purity decreases as well. Thus, the LEO satellites require
a direct radiating antenna, while commercial GEO satellite do not use this type of
antenna, but directional reﬂector antennas. At MEO, the situation is less clear and
both direct radiating and reﬂector antennas have been proposed for this orbit.
2.4.6.3
Basic Types of Antenna Onboard Spacecraft
Four main types of antennas are used on satellites: 1. Wire antennas: monopoles
and dipoles; 2. Horn antennas; 3. Reﬂector antennas; and 4. Array antennas.
Wire antennas are used primarily at VHF and UHF to provide communications
for the Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C) systems. They are positioned
with great care on the body of the satellite in an attempt to provide omnidirectional
coverage. Most satellites measure only a few wavelengths at VHF frequencies,
which make it difﬁcult to get the required antenna patterns, and there tends to be
some orientations of the satellite in which the sensitivity of the TT&C system is
reduced by nulls in the antenna pattern.
An antenna pattern is a plot of the ﬁeld strength in the far ﬁeld of the antenna
when a transmitter drives the antenna. The gain of an antenna is a measure in dB of
the antenna’s capability to direct energy in one direction, rather than all around.
A useful principle in antenna theory is reciprocity, which means that an antenna has
the same gain and pattern at any given frequency whether it transmits or receives.
An antenna pattern measured when receiving is identical to the pattern when
transmitting.
As stated earlier, the antenna is providing global, spot, and multiple beam
coverages, but it can provide scanning and orthogonally polarized beams or cov-
erage zones as well. The pattern is frequently speciﬁed by its 3-dB beamwidth, the
angle between the directions in which the radiated (or received) ﬁeld falls to half the
power in the direction of maximum ﬁeld strength. However, a satellite antenna is
used to provide coverage of a certain area or zone on the Earth’s surface, and it is
more useful to have contours of antenna gain with maximum strengths of the signal
in the middle of the coverage area and with decreasing of signals to the peripheries.
When computing the signal power received by a GES from the satellite, it is
important to know where the station lies relative to the satellite transmit antenna
contour pattern so that the exact EIRP can be calculated. If the pattern is not known,
it may be possible to estimate the antenna gain in a given direction if the antenna
boresight or beam axis direction and its beamwidth are known.
Horn antenna is used at MW when for global coverage relatively wide beams are
required. A horn is a ﬂared section of waveguide that provides an aperture several
wavelengths wide and a good match between the waveguide impedance and the
168
2
Space Segment

free space. It is also used as feeds for reﬂectors, either singly or in clusters. Horns
and reﬂectors are examples of aperture antennas that launch a wave into free space
from a waveguide. It is difﬁcult to obtain gains much greater than 23 dB or
beamwidths narrower than about 10° with horn antennas. For higher gains or
narrow beamwidths, a reﬂector antenna or array must be used.
Reﬂector antennas are usually illuminated by one or more horns and provide a
larger aperture than can be achieved with a horn alone. For maximum gain, it is
necessary to generate a plane wave in the aperture of the reﬂector. This is achieved
by choosing a reﬂector proﬁle that has equal path lengths from the feed to the
aperture so that all the energy radiated by the feed and reﬂected by the reﬂector
reaches the aperture with the same phase angle and creates a uniform phase front.
One reﬂector shape that achieves this with a point source of radiation is the para-
boloid, with a feed placed at its focus. The paraboloid is the basic shape for most
reﬂector antennas and is commonly used for Earth station antennas. Satellite
antennas often use modiﬁed paraboloidal reﬂector proﬁles to tailor the beam pattern
to a particular coverage zone. Phased array antennas are also used on satellites to
create multiple beams from a single aperture and have been used by Iridium and
Globalstar to generate up to 16 beams from a single aperture for their LEO system.
2.4.7
Satellite Bus
The satellite bus is usually called a platform and consists of several sections, shown
in Fig. 2.17. The function of the satellite platform is to support the payload oper-
ation reliably throughout the mission of primary construction section, such as
Structure Platform (SP), Electric Power (EP), Thermal Control (TC), Attitude and
Orbit Control (AOC), Telemetry, Tracking and Command (TT&C) and Propulsion
Engine.
2.4.7.1
Structure Platform (SP)
The structure has to house and keep together all components of bus and commu-
nications modules, enable protection from the environment, and facilitate connec-
tion of the satellite to the launcher. It comprises a skeleton on which the equipment
modules are mounted and a panel, which covers and provides protection for sen-
sitive parts during the operational phase from micrometers and helps to shield the
equipment from extremes of heat, coldness, vacuum, and weightlessness, including
the relatively small dynamic forces produced by the station-keeping, attitude con-
trol engines, and inertial momentum devices.
The spacecraft is protected during the launch phase with an enclosure, or nose
cone. At the end, the nose cone is jettisoned, at which time the spacecraft must
survive the inertial and thermal stress of an additional propulsion stage until it is
inserted into orbit. In this sense, a spacecraft is virtually free of gravitational stress
2.4
Spacecraft SubSystems
169

when in orbit, which allows the use of very large deployable arrays, which would
collapse under their own weight on the Earth’s surface without problems.
Thus, large stresses are developed during launch as a result of massive acceler-
ation and intense vibration, so the SP body must be sufﬁciently strong to withstand
all external forces. On the other hand, all large structures such as antenna and solar
arrays have to be folded and protected during a launch sequence and must have a
deployable mechanism. The deployment of structures requires a special technique in
the vacuum of space because of the lack of a damping medium, such as air.
Most satellites are either cylindrically shaped and are stabilized by spinning the
whole of main body shown in Fig. 2.36 (Left) or box-shaped three-axis body
stabilized illustrated in Fig. 2.36 (Right). Spin stabilized structures have a cylin-
drical part, which rotates at a speed of 50–100 rpm and the despun stabilized part
has mounted antennas always facing to the Earth. The spin axis lies along the pitch
axis parallel to the Earth’s N–S axis. Thus, spin is initiated during the launch phase
by means of small gas jet.
The spinning part of the cylinder is covered with solar cells and its spin axis is
oriented perpendicularly toward the Sun. Body-stabilized structures rotate once for
every rotation of the Earth so that the side with mounted antenna will always face
the Earth. This platform utilizes a deployed set of solar panels with solar cells
mounted on one side of the panel surface relative to the Sun.
The box-shaped body-stabilized satellite has three-axis known as Roll, Pitch,
and Yaw (RPY), which deﬁne the attitude of satellite. Thus, all three-axes pass
through the center of satellite gravity. The Yaw axis is directed toward the Earth’s
center, the Pitch axis is normal to the orbital plane, and Roll axis is perpendicular to
the other two. In fact, the Roll axis is tangential to the orbit and lies along the
satellite velocity vector.
Materials in space are not subjected to gravitational stress or atmospheric cor-
rosion and the effects of the space environment are not all benign by any means.
The high vacuum causes some materials to sublime or evaporate and some to weld
together on contact. The latter behavior means that special attention has to be given
to the materials used for bearings. The basic materials for the main frame are
aluminum or magnesium alloys and special plastic or ﬁber materials and for other
components carbon ﬁber, epoxy resins, and carbon nanotube ﬁlaments are used.

2.4.7.2
Electric Power (EP)
The primary source of power for a communications satellite is the Sun. Hence, solar
cells are used to convert energy received from the Sun into an electrical source. The
principal components of the power supply system include: (1) The power electric
generator, usually solar cell arrays, located on the spinning body of a spin-stabilized
satellite or on the paddles for a three-axis stabilized satellite; (2) reliable electrical
storage devices, such as batteries, for operating during periods of solar eclipses;
(3) the electrical harness for conducting electricity to all of the devices demanding
power; (4) the special converters and regulators delivering regulated voltage and
currents to the devices on board the spacecraft; and (5) the electrical control and
protection section is associated with the remote monitoring TT&C satellite system.
The solar arrays are the motor during entire life of the satellite, providing suf-
ﬁcient power to all active components. Occasionally, if the Earth or Moon blocks
the Sun, then researchable batteries provide secondary electrical power.
A typical satellite power subsystem is shown in Fig. 2.37. Most components are
duplicated for redundancy. On spinning satellites, the rings are between the power
subsystem, on the rotating part, and the satellite bus.
Each cell delivers about 150 mA at a few hundred millivolts and an array of cells
must be connected in series or in parallel together to give the required voltage and
current for operating the equipment until the end of its life and to recharge the
batteries when the satellite moves out of an eclipse. Charge is applied via the main
electric power bus or a small section of the solar cell. In the course of exploitation,
batteries are sometimes reconditioned by intentionally discharging them to a low
charge level and recharging again, which usually prolongs their life.
The operational status of batteries including recharge, in-service, or reconditioning
is remotely controlled by a special ground segment. The mass of a battery constitutes a
signiﬁcant portion of the total satellite mass. Therefore, a useful ﬁgure of merit to
evaluate the performance of a battery is capacity in W/h per unit weight taken at the
end of its life. Until recently virtually all satellites used Ni-Cd (Nickel-Cadmium)
batteries because of their high reliability and long lifetime. These batteries provide a
low speciﬁc energy of about 30–40 Wh/kg. The latest type of Ni-H (Nickel-
Hydrogen) batteries can store at least 50 % more energy per kilogram.

When a satellite passes through the Earth’s shadow, the solar arrays stop pro-
ducing power and the satellite structures use the energy from batteries. The GEO
satellite undergoes around 84 eclipses in a year, with a maximum duration of
70 min. Thus, the eclipse occurs twice a year for 42 consecutive days each time.
The percentage of eclipses’ duration for GEO and HEO is much less than for lower
satellite orbits. The LEO satellites can undergo several thousand eclipses in a year.
For example, a LEO satellite in equatorial orbit at an altitude of 780 km can remain
in the Earth’s shadow for 35 % of the orbital period. For a MEO under similar
conditions, the maximum eclipse duration would be about 12.5 % of the orbital
period and a total duration of about 3 h a day, with about 4 eclipses per day.
Otherwise, the Sun can also be sometimes eclipsed by the Moon’s shadow, which is
less predictable.
2.4.7.3
Thermal Control (TC)
There is not air at satellite orbit surrounded by very harsh space environment. The
average satellite temperature is determined by the absorbed solar energy, different
thermal radiation into space, and internal electric dissipation, what depends on the
satellite shape and surface.
Thermal control of a communications satellite is very important factor during
entire satellite lifetime, which is necessary to achieve normal temperature balance
and proper performance of all subsystem. Thermal stress results in high-temperature
effects from the Sun and low temperatures occurring during eclipse period. The
obvious objective of the TC is to assure that the spacecraft structure and all
equipment is maintained within temperatures that will provide successful opera-
tions. A satellite undergoes different thermal and other conditions during the launch
and operational phase. The vacuum in space limits all heat transfer mechanisms to
and from a spacecraft and its external environment to that of radiation. However,
some main parts are usually in direct sunlight with a ﬂux density of over 1 kW/m2,
while other parts are facing the shadow side at a temperature of about −270 °C. In
addition, an eclipse causes temperature variation from around −180° to +60 °C,
when the ambient temperature falls well below 0 °C and rises rapidly from the
moment the satellite emerges from the eclipse. All these extremes have to be
eliminated or moderated for normal satellite operations, especially because all
electronic devices need optimum temperatures between −5° and +45 °C.
These problems can be solved by remote TC techniques, using both passive and
active means of controlling and regulating the temperature inside spacecraft. The
passive means are simple and reliable, using surface ﬁnishes, ﬁlters, and insulation
blankets. The active means are necessary to supplement the passive systems, which
include louvers and blinds operated by bimetallic strips, heat pipes, thermal louvers,
and different electrical heaters. Heat pipes are used to transfer heat from internal hot
spots or devices to remote radiator surfaces or must be transported to the outside
surface where it can be dissipated. On the other hand, special electric heaters are
used to maintain minimum component or structure temperatures during cold
172
2

conditions. Accordingly, the TC subsystem ensures temperature regulation for
optimum efﬁciency and satellite performance.
2.4.7.4
Attitude and Orbit Control (AOC)
The attitude and orbital control subsystem checks that a spacecraft is placed in its
precise orbital position, and maintains, thereafter, the required attitude throughout
its mission. Control is achieved by employing momentum wheels, which produce
gyroscopic torques, combined with an auxiliary reaction control gas thruster sys-
tem. Various sensors are employed to detect attitude errors, including Sun’s initial
orientation purposes.
The satellite antennas require AOC system that will keep them pointed always at
the Earth, frequently within 0.1° and 0.01°. Figure 2.38 shows a block diagram of
AOC system. The sensors direct any pointing errors and correct them by changing the
speed or direction of a rotating wheel. The main performance speciﬁcation of an AOC
system is determined by the disturbance torques and the required pointing accuracy.
The AOC system performs satellite orientation and accurate orbital positioning
throughout its lifetime, because loss of attitude renders a spacecraft useless. There
are in use two common AOS, such as attitude control and orbit or station-keeping
control systems. The objective of attitude control was to keep the antenna RF beam
pointing at the intended areas on the Earth, which procedure involves as follows:
(1) measuring the attitude of the satellite by sensors; (2) comparing the results of
measurements with the required values; (3) calculating the corrections to reduce
eventual errors; and (4) introducing these corrections by operating the appropriate
torque units.

1. Attitude Control—Currently, all types of attitude stabilization systems have
relied on the conservation of angular momentum in a spinning element, which can
be classiﬁed into the two categories already mentioned, such as spin-stabilized and
three-axis stabilization. The satellite is rapidly spun around one of its principal axes
of inertia. Thus, in the absence of any perturbing torque, the satellite attains an
angular momentum in a ﬁxed direction in an absolute frame of reference. For the
GEO satellite, the spin (pitch direction) axis must be parallel to the axis of the
Earth’s rotation. The perturbation torques reduce the spin of the satellite and they
affect the orientation of the spin axis. The second system of attitude control is a
body-stabilized design in a three-axis stabilized satellite, whose body remains ﬁxed
in space. This solution is the simplest method of attitude control using a momentum
wheel, which simultaneously acts as a gyroscope, in combination with spin and
drive stabilization. Certain perturbing torques can be resisted by changing its spin
speed and the resulting angular momentum of the satellite.
2. Orbit or Station-keeping Control—Onboard propulsion requirements for
both GEO and non-GEO are important to keep a satellite in the correct orbital
attitude and position. For this reason, several types of propulsion systems are used,
such as arc jet thrusters, ion and solar electrical propulsion, pulsed plasma thrusters,
and iridium-coated rhenium chambers for chemical propellants. In order that the
appropriate station-keeping corrections can be applied, it is essential that the orbit
and position of a satellite are accurately determined. This may be done by making
measurements of the angular direction and distance of the satellite from the Earth
station, or a number of LES. When the orbit and position of the satellite have been
determined, it is possible to calculate the velocity increments required to keep the
N–S and E–W excursion of the satellite within the tolerated limits. The frequency
with which N–S correction must be made depend on the maximum allowable value
of the orbital inclination but the total increment required each year to cancel out the
attraction of the Sun and Moon is 40–50 m/s. Otherwise, E–W station-keeping is
usually achieved by allowing the satellite to drift toward the nearest point of
equilibrium until it reaches the maximum tolerable error in longitude, then the
process is repeated on the other side of the nominal longitude, and ﬁnally, the
satellite drifts back once more toward the point of equilibrium, and the process is
repeated. The frequency and magnitude of the velocity increments required depend
on the angular distance between the satellite and the points of equilibrium and on
the tolerable error, which is a maximum of about 2 m/s.
2.4.7.5
Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C)
The telemetry, tracking, command, and communication equipment enables data to
be send continuously to the Earth stations, received from these stations and allows
ground control stations to track the spacecraft and to monitor the health of the
spacecraft and also to send commands to carry out various tasks such as switching
the transponders in and out of service, and switching between redundant units.
174

Space Segment

The TT&C subsystem monitors and controls the satellite functions right from the
liftoff stage to the end of its operational life in space. The TT&C subsystem is
therefore very important, not only during orbital injection and the positioning
phase, but also throughout the operational ﬁfe of the satellite. During the orbital
injection and positioning phase, the telemetry link is primarily used by the tracking
system to establish the satellite-to-Earth station communication channel. After the
satellite is put into the desired slot in its intended orbit, its mission is to monitor the
health of various subsystems onboard satellite.
In Fig. 2.39 is shown the block schematic arrangement of the basic TT&C
subsystem.
The TT&C system supports the function of spacecraft management for suc-
cessful operation of payload and bus subsystems. The main functions of a TT&C
are as follows:
1. Telemetry Subsystem—The function of telemetry is to monitor various
spacecraft parameters and performances such as voltage, current, temperature,
output from attitude sensors, reaction wheel speed, pressure of propulsion tanks and
equipment status and to transmit the monitored data to the Satellite Control Center
(SCC) on the Earth. At this point, the telemetered data are analyzed at the SCC and
used for routine operational and failure diagnosis purposes, to provide data about
the amount of fuel remaining, to support determination of orbital parameters, etc.
2. Tracking Subsystem—The function of tracking is to provide necessary
sources to Earth stations for the tracking and determination of orbital parameters. In
such a way, to maintain a satellite in its assigned orbital slot and provide look angle
information to LES in the network, it is necessary to estimate the orbital parameters
regularly. These parameters can be obtained by tracking the communications
satellite from the ground and measuring its angular position and range. Most SCC
employ angular and range or range-rate tracking to control satellite orbits.

3. Command Subsystem—This subsystem receives commands transmitted
from the ground SCC, veriﬁes reception, and executes commands to perform
various functions of the satellite during its operational mission, such as Satellite
transponder and beacon switching, Antenna pointing control, Switch matrix
reconﬁguration, Controlling direction and speed of solar arrays drive, Battery
reconditioning, Thruster ﬁring, and Switching heaters of the various systems.
2.4.7.6
Propulsion Engine (PE)
The functions of the propulsion motors are to generate the thrust required for the
attitude and orbital control of errors caused by solar and lunar gravity and other
inﬂuences, or possibly the adequate assistance of the satellite into its ﬁnal orbit.
Hence, these errors are normally corrected at set intervals in response to com-
mands from SCC. The necessary impulse is provided by thrusters, which operate by
ejecting hot or cold gas under pressure. The thrust requirements for orbital control
are provided by mono- or bi-propellant fuels. The attitude control thrusters are
positioned away from the center of the mass to achieve the maximum thrust, the
thrust being applied perpendicular to the direction of a spacecraft’s center of mass.
The orbit control thrusters are mounted so that the thrust vector passes through the
center of mass. The relocation of a satellite from transfer orbit into GEO may be
performed by apogee boost motor. In some satellite conﬁgurations, this is achieved
by a solid or liquid fuel engine. Moreover, the choice between these two motors has
a signiﬁcant effect on the internal arrangements of the satellite.
2.5
Intersatellite Links (ISL)
Intersatellite or cross-links are communication links between satellite constellations.
Three types of intersatellite links can be considered:
1. GEO to LEO links between geostationary (GEO) satellites and low Earth orbit
(LEO) satellites also called Interorbital Links (IOL);
2. GEO to GEO links between geostationary satellites; and
3. LEO to LEO links between low Earth orbit satellites.
Of course, one could consider intersatellite links between satellites in any type of
orbit, but the above conﬁgurations are those most considered in practice. Only the
transmission aspects are presented here.
An GEO satellite can cover about 40 % of the Earth’s surface. Because each
satellite sees so much of the Earth, no many commercial GEO satellite to date has
an ISL. The ISL solution for GEO satellites is being considered for network con-
nectivity, particularly for transfer of data, and generally to reduce ground
infrastructure.
176

Space Segment

However, if connectivity over a large geographical area is required, the smaller
footprint of LEO satellite needs that they have GES or Gateway in the coverage
area of each satellite, with onboard store and forward capacity or ISL service. The
Big LEO Globalstar has not ISL system, while Big LEO Iridium system using ISL
optical links can offer service anywhere and anytime.
The ISL conﬁguration may use either RF or optical technology for intercon-
nections. Thus, a requirement for an optical or RF ISL to operate through solar
conjunction, when the Sun is within the ﬁeld of view of an optical or RF antenna, is
a major ISL design driver. Operation through solar conjunction is possible with
both microwave and optical systems, but is actually easier with an optical system.
Optical ISL has very high antenna gain because of their short wavelength. Laser
diodes have a frequency of the order of 1–6 × 1015, or about 105 higher than a
30 GHz RF wave. The optical antenna gain is 100 dB more than a RF antenna of
the same size and efﬁciency. Moreover, a 10-cm-diameter optical antenna has
80 dB more gain than a 1 m RF antenna. This allows a 1 W laser diode to provide
the same ﬂux density as a 100 MW RF source. Optical detection is less efﬁcient
than RF detection so the above overstates the actual comparison, but gives a clear
idea of the advantages of an optical system. Thus, to appreciate the narrowness of
the optical beam, a 1-micron laser using a 10-cm antenna would have a bandwidth
of about 1 milliradian. The very narrow bandwidth requires a closed-loop tracking
system, where each ISL tracks the signal from the communicating satellite.
The choice between radio and optical links depends on the mass and power
consumed. In general terms, it can be said that the advantage is with radio links for
low throughputs (less than 1 Mb/s). For high-capacity links (several tens of Mb/s)
optical links command attention. For a link involving one uplink, one or more
optical intersatellite links and one downlink, the overall station-to-station link
performance should be established in the same way as the overall link performance
for regenerative satellites. Indeed, the implementation of intersatellite links, be it at
radio frequency or with optical technology, is mainly of interest when onboard
demodulation is available, so as to provide ﬂexible onboard switching.
2.5.1
Direct ISL Data Transmission Over GEO Satellite
In space activities, there is a stronger need of exploring and making usage of
advanced technologies to transmit data directly in cross-link from one satellite to
another, both conventionally using radio waves or in a revolutionary and new way
using laser beams.
Earth observation satellites, for instance, cannot send their data to just one Earth
station, because they ﬂy at low altitude of about 800 km. As they scan the Earth’s
surface, they disappear behind the horizon after a few minutes at the most. The data
must therefore be stored in onboard memories, which are far from fail-safe or else
transmitted to a large number of distributed Earth stations, which are costly to
operate.
2.5
Intersatellite Links (ISL)
177

From its vantage point in GEO at 36,000 km above the Earth such as the ESA
Artemis spacecraft can be in constant communication with satellites in LEO orbit
for long periods of each orbit and can beam data from those satellites directly to the
users, illustrated in Fig. 2.40. To demonstrate the reception of data from other
satellites and their onward transmission to users, Artemis is carrying an advanced
radio data-relay payload and a revolutionary laser data-relay payload called
Semiconductor Laser Intersatellite Link Experiment (SILEX). SILEX is the world’s
ﬁrst civil intersatellite data-relay system using lasers as carriers for the signal
transmission.
Using laser communications, very high data rates can be achieved via small
terminals on LEO satellites, such as existing Iridium. The radio data-relay payload
SKDR (S/Ka-band Data Relay) features the use of two frequencies for relaying data
at low, medium, or high rates again both ways. The ﬁrst users of SKDR include
ESA’s environmental ENVISAT-1 satellite scheduled for launch in 1999. Under an
agreement with NASDA, the Japanese space agency, the ARTEMIS satellite, will
also serve several Japanese spacecraft and the Japanese module of the International
Space.
2.5.2
Radio Frequency (RF) ISL
Table 2.7 indicates the frequency bands allocated to ISL by the radiocommunica-
tion regulations. These frequencies correspond to strong absorption by the atmo-
sphere and have been chosen to provide protection against interference between
intersatellite links and terrestrial systems. However, these bands are shared with

other space services and the limitation on interference level is likely to impose
constraints on the choice of the deﬁning parameters of intersatellite links (CCIR
Reports 451, 465, 874, 951). The same table also indicates the wavelengths
envisaged for optical links. These result in the transmission characteristics of the
components.
Propagation losses reduce to free-space losses since there is no passage through
the atmosphere. Antenna pointing error can be maintained at around a tenth of the
beamwidth and this leads to a pointing error loss of the order of 0.5 dB. The
antenna temperature in the case of a GEO–GEO link, in the absence of solar
conjunction, is of the order of 10 K. Table 2.8 indicates typical values for the
terminal equipment. For practical applications, antenna dimensions are of the order
of 1–2 m. In such a way, considering a frequency of 60 GHz and transmission and
reception losses of 1 dB leads to:
• A receiver ﬁgure of merit G/T of the order of 25–29 dBK−1; and
• A transmitter EIRP of the order of 72–78 dBW.
Because of the relatively wide beamwidth of the antenna (0.2° at 60 GHz for a
2 m antenna), establishing the link is not a problem. Each satellite orientates its
receiving antenna in the direction of the transmitting satellite with a precision of the
order of 0.1° to acquire a beacon signal, which is subsequently used for tracking.
The development of high capacity RF ISL between GEO satellite systems implies
reuse of frequencies from one beam to another. In view of the small angular
separation of the satellites, it is preferable to use narrow-beam antennas with
reduced side lobes in order to avoid interference between systems. Consequently,
and in view of the limited antenna size imposed by the launcher and the technical
complexity of the deployable antennas, the use of high frequencies is indicated. The
use of optical links may be usefully considered in this context.

2.5.3
Optical ISL
Except RF links, ISL can use optical or laser links as well.
In comparison with radio links, optical links have speciﬁc characteristics, which
are important for establishment a link.
2.5.3.1
Establishing an Optical ISL
Two aspects should be indicated to establish an optical ISL:
1. The small diameter of the telescope is typically of the order 0.3 m. In this
way, one is freed from congestion problems and aperture blocking of other antennas
in the satellite payload.
2. The narrowness of the optical beam is typically 5 microradians. Notice that
this width is of several orders of magnitude less than that of a radio beam, and this
is an advantage for protection against interference between systems. But it is also a
disadvantage since the beamwidth is much less than the precision of satellite atti-
tude control (typically 0.1° or 1.75 mrad). Consequently, an advanced pointing
device is necessary; this is probably the most difﬁcult technical problem.
There are three basic phases to optical communications:
1. Acquisition: The beam must be as wide as possible in order to reduce the
acquisition time. But this requires a high-power laser transmitter. A laser of lower
mean power can be used which emits pulses of high peak power with a low duty
cycle. The beam scans the region of space where the receiver is expected to be
located. When the receiver receives the signal, it enters a tracking phase and
transmits in the direction of the received signal. On receiving the return signal from
the receiver, the transmitter also enters the tracking phase. The typical duration of
this phase is 10 s.
2. Tracking: The beams are reduced to their nominal width. Laser transmission
becomes continuous. In this phase, which extends throughout the following, the
pointing error control device must allow for movements of the platform and relative
movements of the two satellites. In addition, since the relative velocity of the two
satellites is not zero, a lead-ahead angle exists between the receiver and the
transmitter LOS. On the other hand, as demonstrated below, the lead-ahead angle is
larger than the beamwidth and must be accurately determined.
3. Communications: Information is exchanged between the two ends.
Otherwise, the narrow optical beam gives rise to several problems for optical
cross-links as:
1. Difﬁcult acquisition—The very narrow beam requires very precise knowl-
edge of the location of the two satellites establishing the link and the special
acquisition mode.
2. Sensitivity to spacecraft vibration—A fast-tracking system, of the order of
100 Hz, is necessary so that naturally occurring vibrations, from thruster valves,
momentum wheels, solar array devices and so on, do not degrade performance.
180

Space Segment

3. Point ahead—The ﬁnite speed of light requires that the tracking system point
to where the communicating satellite will be when its signal reaches it, not where it
was when it received the signal. This is particularly true for GEO satellite.
4. Optical cleanliness—The satellite antenna gain is so high that even small
amounts of contamination can signiﬁcantly degrade it. The optical system must be
kept clean through ground test and launch procedure, including from satellite
thrusters used for station-keeping system.
2.5.3.2
ISL Relations Between Two GEO Satellites
Consider two satellites, S1 and S2, respectively, moving with velocity vectors VS1
and VS2, whose components orthogonal to the line joining S1 and S2 at time t are,
respectively, the two vectors represented in Fig. 2.41 (Left) by VT1 and VT2. In fact,
Lead-ahead angle for link between two satellites S1 and S2 with velocity vector
components VT1 and VT2 in a plane perpendicular to the line joining S1 and S2 at
time t; tp is propagation time of a photon from S1 to S2.
The propagation time of a photon from S1 to S2 is tp = d/c, where d is the distance
between the two satellites at time t and c is the speed of light (c = 3 × 108 m/s).
The lead-ahead angle B is given by:
b ¼ 2=VT1VT2=c rad

ð2:61Þ
where |VT1 −VT2| is the modulus of the difference vector VT1–VT2.

links between a GEO and an LEO satellite.

As both satellites are on the same circular orbit, shown in Fig. 2.39 (Right), the
velocity vectors VS1 and VS2, which are tangential to the orbit, have equal modulus:

where ω is the angular velocity of a GEO = 7.293 × 10−5 rad/s; R0 is the altitude of
a GEO satellite = 35,786 km; and RE is the Earth radius = 6378 km.
The component vectors VT1 and VT2, perpendicular to the line joining S1 and S2
at time t, both lie in the plane of the orbit and are opposite. They are at an angle
(π/2 −α/2) with respect to vectors VS1 and VS2. Therefore, following these values

At this point, the lead-ahead angle β as a function of the separation angle α
between the two GEO satellites. Here is important to note that for a separation angle
larger than 15°, the lead-ahead angle is larger than the beamwidth (typically 5
microradians). For instance, β = 10.6 microradians for α = 30°, β = 20.5 micro-
radians for α = 60°, and β = 35.5 microradians for α = 120°.
2.5.3.3
ISL Relations Between GEO and LEO Satellites
The relative velocity of the two satellites varies with time and so does the value of
the lead-ahead angle, as shown in Fig. 2.42. Its maximum value is obtained when
the LEO satellite crosses the equatorial plane. Denoting as i the LEO satellite orbit
inclination, then:

intersatellite links between two geostationary satellites.

Transmission and Reception of Optical Sources
The ISL relay link from a LEO satellite to the ground via high-altitude platforms
(HAP) relay and from a LEO satellite over a GEO satellite and HAP is presented in
Fig. 2.43.
The “last mile” downlink from the HAP or stratospheric communication plat-
form (SCP) to GES would be either bridged by a high-bandwidth optical or
microwave link.

Optical or laser sources operate in single- and multifrequency modes. In single
frequency mode, spectral width varies between 10 kHz and 10 MHz. In multifre-
quency mode, it is from 1.5 to 10 nm. The power emitted depends on the type of
laser. Modulation can be internal or external. Internal modulation implies direct
modiﬁcation of the operation of the laser. External modulation is a modiﬁcation of
the light beam after its emission by the laser. The intensity, the frequency, the
phase, and the polarization can be modulated. Phase and polarization modulation
are external. Intensity and frequency modulation can be internal or external.
Polarization modulation requires the presence of two detectors in the receiver, one
for each polarization. Because of this, it is preferable to reserve polarization for
multiplexing of two channels. The intensity distribution of a laser beam, as a
function of angle with respect to the maximum intensity, follows a Gaussian law. If
total beamwidth is reduced, there is beneﬁt in gain but the pointing error loss
increases. In general, for a pointing error of any kind, the beamwidth may be
adapted to the pointing error. In addition to losses due to pointing error, trans-
mission losses and degradation of the wavefront in the emitting optics occur.
The receiver can be of a direct detection or a coherent detection receiver. With
direct detection, the incident photons are converted into electrons by a photode-
tector. The subsequent baseband electric current at the photodetected output is
ampliﬁed then detected by a matched ﬁlter. With coherent detection, the optical
signal ﬁeld associated with the incident photons is mixed with the signal from a
local laser. The resulting optical ﬁeld is converted into a bandpass electric current
by a photodetector and is subsequently ampliﬁed by an intermediate frequency
ampliﬁer. The demodulator detects the useful signal either by envelope detection or
by coherent demodulation. The receiving losses include optical transmission losses
and, for coherent detection, losses associated with the degradation of the wavefront.
The quality of the wavefront is an important characteristic for optimum mixing of
the received signal ﬁeld and the local oscillator ﬁeld at the photodetector frontend.
Filtering, to reject out-of-band photons, also introduces losses, since the trans-
mission coefﬁcient reduces with bandwidth. A typical ﬁlter width is from 0.1 to
100 nm.
2.5.5
Iridium ISL and Mobility System
Figure 2.44 illustrates a typical satellite communication setup of the Iridium
Big LEO constellation ISL and mobility system. In distinction from the Globalstar
Big LEO, Iridium is providing optical ISL, which improves connections between
users and GES terminals, although there is not direct LOS. The Iridium ISL system
employs frequencies of 22.55–23.55 GHz as these RF are heavily absorbed by
water and hence are not useful for establishment Earth to satellite links.

2.5.5.1
LEO Satellite ISL
The LEO network topology is constructed by the ISL, which establish a network
between satellites. In order to establish ISL network, each satellite needs to have
extra equipment, including transceivers and antennas. This additional equipment
will increase the weight and the cost of the satellite, but on the other hand a satellite
system that has this ISL features does not require a GES to establish a long distance
connection. This advantage reduces the dependency of the satellite network on
terrestrial systems. As stated earlier, in the satellite constellation, there are two types
of ISL solutions.
The permanent ISL between satellites in the same plane (intraplane satellite link)
and semi permanent between satellites in the neighboring planes (interplane satellite
link) will function as edges in LEO satellite constellation with LEO satellites as the
nodes.
As illustrated in Fig. 2.45, ISL between satellites 1 (S1), satellite 2 (S2), and ISL
between satellite 1 (S1) and satellite 3 (S3) in orbital plane 1 are interplane ISL.
The ISL between S1 in orbital plane 2, S4 in orbital plane 3 and the ISL between S1
and S5 in orbital plane 1 are intraplane ISL. Iridium is the ﬁrst satellite commu-
nication system that provides ISL. The ISL system uses radio or laser media for
their direct communication for mobile and semi-ﬁxed systems. Iridium uses a
GSM-based telephony architecture, and a geographically controlled system access
process. Each satellite is connected to its four neighboring satellites through their
ISL network. Connections between the IRIDIUM network and the Public Switched
Telephone Network (PSTN) are provided via GES installations or Gateway. By
having ISL the location of the GES can be ﬂexibly located.
As stated, satellite links in the LEO constellation are constructed from two
different types of ISL solutions. The ﬁrst one is the interplane satellite connection,
which is constructed between two satellites in the same plane, whereas interplane
satellite connection is an ISL which is constructed between two neighboring

satellites in a deferent plane. The intraplane satellite connection remains continuous
for the whole period of time, while interplane satellite connection in some LEO
topology will be turned on for a period of time. For example, in the near-polar
constellation, intraplane satellite connection is switched on in the polar region, to
reduce the signal interference. In the case of Iridium intraplane, ISL will only be
maintained between latitudes of approximately 60° North or South of the equator.
A ﬁrst-degree ISL only provides a connection between satellites with its direct
neighbors. A second-degree ISL will provide a connection between satellites with
not only its direct neighbor satellites, but also with the next neighbor satellites.
Besides intersatellite handover, there is another type of satellite handover, which
is called intrasatellite handover. This is a handover between spot beams in one
satellite or handover occurs between satellites in the same plane. Interplane satellite
handover: This type of handover occurs when a connection is handed over to
another satellite in another plane, due to the unavailability of a satellite in the same
plane, or due to the unavailability of satellite channels to accommodate this con-
nection. The last type of handover is a handover that occurs once the ISL systems
between satellites (either on the seam region or near polar region) are turned off.
2.5.5.2
LEO Satellite Handover
The mobility management in LEO satellite network is speciﬁc because a LEO
satellites movement is relatively higher than the movement of any object on Earth,
when an LEO satellite becomes the moving object in this context, while the mobile
user on Earth has a relatively ﬁxed position. The LEO mobility aspect is more
concerned with the movement of the satellite footprint on Earth, in which an
on-going connection of MES users has to be handed over from one satellite to
another. Thus, these transitions have to be smooth and seamless and mobility
management has to be able to maintain any on-going network connections and
perform a handover process if needed. There is an advantage in a LEO satellites
environment, in which the movement of the LEO satellite is roughly predictable.
Prior to the disappearance of viewed satellite, a new connection needs to be
established. A handover procedure to the new approaching satellite needs to be

constructed. In case there is only one visible satellite at a time, the handover
procedure needs to be initiated before the currently used satellite becomes invisible.
This case is shown in Fig. 2.46 (Left), where a connection between MES1 and
MES2 is constructed using satellite 1 (S1) and satellite 2(S2), via ISL between these
two satellites. The MES1 unit is currently inside the service coverage of S1, while
MES2 is located inside S2 service coverage. Both satellites move in clockwise
direction, so MES2 starts losing service coverage from S2 and starts to obtain S1
coverage. Since currently MES2 is only covered by S2, it needs to start the han-
dover procedure to allocate the connection to the next available satellite S1.
In the case that two or more LEO satellites are visible at the same time, a soft
handover can be used to allocate the ongoing call into another visible satellite,
which has a better signal performance or better visibility than the current one. This
is shown in Fig. 2.46 (Right), when MES2 is currently in the coverage of S3 and
S4. Soon, S3 and S2 will cover MES2. Every time there should be two visible
satellites for each user. MES2 compares signal strength between these two satellites
and chooses the best satellite to build a connection.
Therefore, due to the rapid movement of satellites, MES terminals can only use
the same LEO satellite for short periods of times and before they lose their LOS to
the current satellite, their connection must be handed over to the next available
satellite.
It is necessary to conclude that a handover is initiated from one satellite to
another satellite. The term handover is used in US cellular standard documents,
while in ITU documents the term handover is used as well. Both terms have the
same meaning. Handover in LEO satellite systems differs from the one in the
cellular terrestrial system in term of the mobile and ﬁxed units. In the LEO satellite
systems, handover means a procedure of changing the assignment of a ﬁxed unit, a
MES terminal on Earth, from one mobile unit, a LEO satellite, to another as the
LEO satellites move, while in the terrestrial cellular system a handover means a
procedure of changing the assignment of a mobile unit from one ﬁxed unit (Base
Station) to another, as the mobile unit moves permanently.

The time in which a satellite is visible from a MES is called the sliding window
of this satellite constellation. The visibility period of a satellite is deﬁned as the
maximum time duration that a MES is located inside a footprint and can directly
communicate with that satellite (about 15 min). The satellite footprint is divided
into several spot beams, and each spot beam can use several deferent frequencies.
Because the spot beam coverage area is much smaller than the footprint coverage
area, the maximum visibility of a spot beam is around 1–2 min. This means that a
spot beam handover occurs more frequently than satellite handover. A handover
can be initiated by the network, in which the decision is made by network mea-
surements of received signals from MES on the ground. Alternatively, MES on the
ground can provide a feedback to the LEO satellite concerning the signal received
at the MES user. Various performance metrics may be used in making a decision,
such as call dropping probability due to the handover itself, probability of unsuc-
cessful handover due to an execution of a handover with an inadequate reception
condition, call blocking probability due to unavailable capacity, rate of handover
the maximum number of handovers per unit time, and handover delay due to the
distance of the point that handover should occur and the point that the handover
does occur.
Stallings outlines several handover strategies, which ﬁrstly suggests a handover
can be initiated by measuring relative signal strength between two LEO satellites
and the MES user on the ground. The second strategy depends on threshold signal
strength. A handover is initiated when the signal strength between the LEO satellite
and the MES user is lower than a certain threshold value. In the third strategy, a
handover can only occur if the signal strength of the new LEO satellite is stronger
by a margin than the current signal strength. The last strategy uses by using pre-
diction techniques. The handover decision is based on the expected future value of
the received signal depending on the movement of LEO satellites. A satellite
handover takes place when an ongoing connection needs to be handed over from
one satellite to another satellite. There are three types of satellite handovers:
1. Intra-satellite Handover—Handover occurs between satellites in the same
plane. The Gateway monitors the signal strength and the MES unit position relative
to the satellite. Since the Gateway has information about the MES unit positions
and the satellite positions, when the currently used satellite moves away from the
MES unit, the Gateway will contact the next available satellite in the same plane, to
replace the currently used satellite.
2. Interplane Satellite Handover—It occurs when a connection is handed over
to another satellite in another plane, due to the unavailability of a satellite in the
same plane, or due to the unavailability of satellite channels to accommodate this
connection.
3. Interbeam Handover—This handover occurs while the MES decides to use
another frequency in the adjacent candidate beams, due to the weakness of RF
signal power from the used frequency. Once the RF power strength in the current
beam is lower than the MES initiates, a handover requests to hand over a user to the
new beam.

Transmission Techniques
Early satellite communication systems, primarily ﬁxed, and later mobile networks
used the analog transmission technique. Although modern MSC networks are still
using the analog technique, the rapid development of high-speed digital mobile
equipment is fostering a trend toward completely digital MSC. This chapter
includes techniques and technologies that enable signals to be sent from one user to
another and vice versa via satellites and LES.
There are several methods of modulation, multiplexing, and multiple access
techniques used in MSC and their reverse processes, with some overlapping.
Modulation is the process by which the baseband signal in EM form can be
impressed upon a carrier, so phase (PM) and frequency (FM) modulations are used
heavily in satellite communications because of their positive ability to deal with
nonlinear distortion, noise, and interference. The amplitude of the PM and FM
carrier is held constant, so there is no apparent change in the power level. Most
nonlinear distortion is the result of amplitude variations on the carrier, while PM
and FM are able to perform better in this environment than amplitude modulation
(AM), so because of that problem there is a major limitation in directly using AM
for MSC.
Multiplexing and multiple access require sharing the resources of the satellite.
Facilities are shared based on spectrum assignment (frequencies), by time-sharing
(time domain) and by spatial separation (antenna beam and polarization).
Theoretically, any method can be used for the transmission of analog and digital
signals. In practice, frequency is easier used with analog signals, whereas time
division is easier to use with digital signals. Multiplexing consists of combining the
signals from several users into a single signal, which then forms the signal used for
modulation of the carrier. After demodulation, the individual signals are separated
by an inverse operation called demultiplexing. All types of coding, decoding, and
error corrections are presented. Finally, up-to-date technologies of Internet and
broadband with conclusive explanations of the major protocols used in MSS are
discussed.

3.1
Baseband Signals
The information transmitted over an RF communications link consists of signals
conveyed from one user to another via telephone and video telephone; via fac-
simile, telex, data, packets, radio, and PC terminals; and via television cameras and
receivers. Such signals are called baseband signals, which consist of basic electrical
impulses carried by the radio path of a satellite or via other communication net-
works. If the baseband signal is analog, the voltage which represents it can take any
value within a given range, but if the signal is digital, the voltage takes discrete
values within a given range.
The types of baseband signals are determined by the communication require-
ments of the ﬁnal users and the nature of the network. The main types of baseband
used in MSS are voice (Tel), fax, and Tlx signals on Tel channels and then data,
video, and image signals. The baseband signals of mobile broadcast satellite ser-
vices consist of direct TV (television) and sound transmissions, while in a broad-
band wireless or satellite service baseband, the signal is ICT via Internet and
multimedia, such as data, video retrieval, and image transfer.
Each of these radio signals has to be arranged in a form suitable for transmission
over some physical layer (air or wire), and such a technique is called baseband
signal processing. The modiﬁed baseband signal is then superimposed onto a higher
frequency carrier wave, when the signal modulates the carrier to a value suitable for
propagation over the many different transmission links, such as radio and satellite.
The analog process at the transmit end of the link is called modulation and the
circuit that performs modulation is the modulator, while at the receive end of the
link, it is called demodulation and the circuit that recovers the baseband information
is the demodulator. Digital systems use a modulator for transmission and demod-
ulator for reception of the RF carriers within one unit, known as a modem.
The process of modulation/demodulation applies to radio, satellite, and terrestrial
links using either analog or digital transmission methods. Where GMSC are con-
cerned, there could also be a terrestrial RF link involved between service sub-
scribers’ terminals on shore and LES for maritime, land, and aeronautical services.
The RF terrestrial link may be radio and relay microwave link or landline (wire and
optical ﬁber) or a combination of all three mediums. In both government and
E-commerce, the need for communications to be secure is of vital importance.
Thus, by attaching an encryption device to the transceivers, MSC customers can be
conﬁdent that their baseband voice, data, or video signals are authentic, not tam-
pered with and secure from eavesdroppers almost anywhere in the world.
The bandwidth classiﬁers and a brief description of system characteristics are as
follows:
1. Narrowband—It uses low data of 10 Kb/s by channel bandwidths of
12.5–25 kHz;
2. Wideband—It is developed to provide higher data rate services by channel
bandwidths of 50, 100, or 150 kHz and provides data rates that are measured in
100 Kb/s.

3. Broadband—It provides megabits per second of data. The current allocation is
50 MHz of spectrum at 4.9 GHz band.
In this chapter, they are considered as follows: telephone or voice signal; data
and multimedia signals; sound signals; and television or video signals.
3.1.1
Voice (Telephone) Signals
The ﬁrst commercial voice service via satellites was established by Intelsat at a time
when underwater cables could not keep pace with the rapid growth of telephone
trafﬁc. In spite of data trafﬁc growth in recent years, voice trafﬁc has become
dominant and will remain in the future integrated with videophones. In general,
signals from the most telephone sets are analog, but these signals can be trans-
formed into digital mode and multiplexed at a local telephone exchange for
transmission on trunk routes. In addition, satellites are effective for the broadcast
distribution of voice, data, and video (VDV) signals anywhere and anytime,
including voice (Tel) modems that are able to send digital data over satellite voice
channels or via an 3.3 kHz analog voice channel interfaced to the landline voice
equipment.
Based on the extensive studies of voice signals, it is now well known that most
of the speech energy during normal conversation lies between 0 and 3400 Hz and
the range of voice frequency that can be registered by the human ear is up to about
20 kHz. Therefore, a bandwidth of 3–4 kHz is allocated to each voice channel.
The CCITT recommends the range of telephony signals as 300–3400 Hz. The
maximum energy of a signal representing speech is in the range of 800 Hz, and
about 99 % of the energy is situated below 3000 Hz. The signal power of an
average talker implied to a zero relative level point which is given by:
Pm ¼ Pa þ 0:115r2 þ 10 log s dBmo
½

ð3:1Þ
where Pa = –12.9 dBmo represents the average power of the speech signal;
σ = 5.8 dB is the standard deviation of the normal distribution of the active speech
power; τ = 0.25 is the active factor of a talker. Thus, in total, the value of Pm = –15
dBmo (Article G.223 of CCITT Recommendation).
The quality of a received analog voice signal has been speciﬁed by the CCITT to
give a worst-case baseband signal-to-noise ratio for voice (Tel) signals, for trans-
mission over a long distance, as 50 dB and with the maximum allowable noise in
the baseband of 10,000 picowatts. Speech is characterized by having a large,
dynamic range of up to 50 dB to accommodate the volume difference between a
whisper and a shout. Speakers also tend to pause often, and on average, a speaker
will talk for only 40 % of the period available, while the remainder of the time the
link is idle.

In recent years, considerable effort has been spent in digitizing radio voice and
telephone systems. Some of these techniques are applicable to transfer any type of
analog into digital signal and vice versa, using various analog-to-digital conversion
techniques. The main need has arisen from the advent of MSS and cellular systems,
which both operate on a RF bands that have great demand; hence, considerable
effort is being spent on improving the spectral efﬁciency of transmission as the
spectrum becomes scarcer. The use of spectrally efﬁcient voice coding coupled with
an effective combination of modulation and multiple access techniques provides a
viable transmission solution, so Inmarsat-M mobile standard enables voice com-
munications using voice codes operating at about 6 Kb/sec. The quality of the
reconstituted speech for digital transmission at the receive end, among other factors,
will depend on the number of bits transmitted per second and the number of bits
received in error. This is BER, which value is considered to be about 10−4 (1 bit
error per 10,000 bits) to provide good speech quality. The BER can be used as a
design threshold, although some systems commonly have values superior to 10−5 or
even more.
Today, many modern transmission techniques are in use for the transfer of
analog and digital interactive voice signals between ﬁxed and mobile transmitters
and receivers and for direct transmitting of voice/fax signals to the FES and MES.
Despite the rapid technological advances and the diverse range of data capabilities
available, voice is very important for quick, instant, and easy communication,
meeting the needs of different markets worldwide. Therefore, Inmarsat mobile users
can rely on clear digital voice radiocommunications up to full broadcast quality.
Voice GMSC terminals onboard ships, in the cabin of vehicles or in the aircraft
cockpits, enable direct dealing with landline telephone subscribers via GEO or
non-GEO satellites, LES, and TTN.
The voice service of Globalstar GMPSC infrastructure is based on a
code-excited linear prediction (CELP) variable rate vocoder. The voice quality has
to meet the value provided by IS-96, which is the terrestrial CDMA standard. The
superior voice quality can be offered at low data rates in large part due to the
adaptable vocoder. In marginal areas, where the user terminal cannot generate
sufﬁcient power to close the link, the peak data rate is reduced to 4.8 or 2.4 Kb/s.
Hence, this will provide intelligible voice service in areas that otherwise could
not be served. The vocoder will incorporate echo cancelation, which can be dis-
abled if this function is provided by the satellite network. On the other hand, the
forthcoming project if ICO Global Communications has a technical solution that
can also enable voice roaming inside buildings or tunnels, which will eliminate the
blocking effect of objects, which is the current situation in personal satellite com-
munications, which is a very serious problem of GSM or other cellular systems.
The radio broadcasting program occupies a spectrum from 40 Hz to 15 kHz,
enabling a high quality of voice signal. The test signal is a pure sinusoid at a
frequency of 1 kHz. When the broadcast radio program is transmitted by com-
munication satellite in digital form, the performance objective is stipulated in terms
of error probability. These errors have the effect of generating audible “clicks.” To
limit their frequency to about 1 per hour, a binary error rate in the order of 10−9 is

required by CCIR Report 648. The present broadcasting satellite system operates at
12 GHz and is designed for community ﬁxed stations with large antennas, while
Direct Broadcasting Satellite (DBS) is serving the individual reception of signals by
ﬁxed or semi-ﬁxed terminals with small antennas called VSAT. The present system
is broadcasting both radio and TV programs only for ﬁxed terminals. Although
some developed countries have started to use Direct Audio Broadcasting
(DAB) satellite systems in the L-, S- and Ka-band for MSS. At any rate, these
models of broadcasting systems are suitable for mobile utilization on ships, vehi-
cles, and aircraft.
3.1.2
Data and Multimedia Signals
Data transmission is composed using digital signals consisting of a series of bits.
Actually, bits are bistate pulses with low state called “0” (–V) and high state “1”
(+V). Information is superimposed on a digital stream by arranging groups of bits
called words, which can be used for the transmission of analog signals from a
telephone or alphanumeric characters from a PC keypad. Therefore, facsimile,
telex, data, and PC e-mail networking terminals are used for the transfer of data
through the medium of different transmission techniques and applications that are
expanding rapidly, including GMSC systems.
Data signals used by Inmarsat MSS can be broadly classiﬁed into three ranges:
(1) Narrowband data of about 300 b/s can be transmitted via MES TDMA
24 Kb/s Tlx channel with possibly 16 data bursts directed to LES or other
MES terminals and PSTN via a modem.
(2) Full-duplex voice and 9.6 Kb/s data signals can be transmitted in the single
channel per carrier (SCPC) data channel with a rate of 24 Kb/s in O-QPSK
modulation scheme. In fact, the data channel enables packet data transfer using
the CCITT X.25 recommendation to interface data terminal equipment
(DTE) and data circuit-terminating equipment (DCTE) operating in packet
mode to the PSDN by dedicated circuits. This channel also supports CCITT
Group-3 Fax, which is also available in the SCPC voice channel, using a 2.4
b/s data rate and APC voice codes.
(3) Wideband one-way high-speed data (HSD) transmission can be supported
with a rate of 64/56 Kb/s via voice channels on a dedicated frequency with a
special type of V.32 (9600 b/s) modem. This service can be used for the
transfer of PC data, high-quality digital audio, and compressed video. The
duplex HSD will offer two-way 492 Kb/s via standard IP service for aircraft in
both directions. The two-way HSD can be also used for digital multiplexing
data channels and video conferencing between ships and shore.
There are several known techniques in transmitting digital data, facsimile,
e-mail, and PC networking data applications, whose utility is also expanding
3.1
Baseband Signals
193

rapidly for ﬁxed and mobile systems. The new satellite global area network
(GAN) portfolio of the HSD service developed by Inmarsat offers a cost-effective
extension to corporate LAN and WAN even in the world’s most rugged regions.
Moreover, mobile packet data allows users to pay according to the amount of data
they send rather than how long they spend online suited to Internet Web-based
applications such as intranet access and e-commerce via satellite.
Meanwhile, the quality of data service provided by GMPSC systems enables
transmission speeds up to 7.2 Kb/s. The BER contributed for instance by the
Globalstar system is less than 1 × 10−6. Hence, a higher terminal rate of about
9.6 Kb/s can be processed if the equipment incorporates an elastic buffer to
accommodate the required ﬂow control.
Therefore, data is becoming the most common vehicle for information transfer
related to a large variety of services, including voice telephony, video, and
PC-generated information exchange. One of the most appealing aspects of data is
the ability to combine, onto a single transmission, support data generated by a
number of individual sources, which resulting in a single data stream called
aggregate trafﬁc. This is paramount for transfer of multimedia trafﬁc integrating
VDV signals that often displays a reduced bit-rate variance versus trafﬁc generated
by the individual sources due to the embedded statistical multiplexing.
A network operator uses this opportunity to dimension its links (and particularly
satellite links) with a capacity that is less than the sum of the peak bit rate of the
individual sources. This dimensioning considers both the burstiness of the data
trafﬁc and the multiplexing techniques in use. The trafﬁc is typically transported by
packets, so the data structure (transport stream) developed for conveying TV pro-
gram components could be used to carry any type of data, taking advantage of the
well-recognized standard and mass-market production of equipment.
For example, the Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG-2) transport stream
(MPEG-TS) packets are used with DVB-S data satellite transmission. As for video
program, MPEG-2 transport stream (MPEG-TS) packet has a ﬁxed size of 188
bytes of which 4 bytes are used for the packet header and 144 bytes for the payload.
The header consists of a synchronization (sync) byte, a packet identiﬁer (PID),
transport error indication, and a ﬁeld of adaptation options.
The asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) data format is used in high data rate,
terrestrial networks. The ATM packet, called an “ATM cell,” is a ﬁxed size of 53
bytes, of which 5 bytes are used for the header and 48 bytes for the payload. The
header consists of a virtual channel identiﬁer (VCI), a virtual path identiﬁer (VPI), a
payload type, and priority and header error check (HEC) ﬁelds.
3.1.3
Video Signals
Prior to the advent of satellite communications, it was very impracticable to relay
video TV programs across oceans because of the limited bandwidth of submarine
coaxial cables. Today, optical ﬁber cables have enough channels but cannot, like
194

Transmission Techniques

satellite systems, transmit DBS TV video to many widely separated ﬁxed or VSAT
stations and especially to mobile terminals. Direct broadcast by satellite has been in
use almost 3 decades, because the ﬁrst such European satellite was launched in
1987. The demand for this type of satellite service continues to gain interest in the
distribution of TV programs direct to homes (households) or other ﬁxed stations
and, later, to provide a service for mobile stations.
There are various inexpensive ways in which it is possible to add data trans-
missions to the DBS and to provide cheap information services and e-mail for both
domestic and business purposes, and to onshore or offshore TV subscribers.
More than two decades ago, Inmarsat started to provide transmission of still
picture mode from the oil ﬁelds to any ofﬁce using a wide range of analog and
digital portable devices for transmitting, receiving, and processing high-resolution
color photographs in less than 5 min.
In addition, Inmarsat developed the HSD store-and-forward video system.
Namely, with the aid of advanced video codecs, it is possible to digitize and compress
video material and then transmit it at 492 Kb/s to a receiver, which decompresses and
buffers the data in almost full motion video. The store-and-forward technique also
ensures that the received material is error-free, since the data transmission is achieved
by using error detection and repeat transmission mode.
There is a new possibility today for Inmarsat MES to also use integrated services
digital network (ISDN) interfaces for the transfer of intensive data interactive
applications such as video conferencing (VC) and digital image transfer (DIT).
Therefore, utility of standard ISDN interfaces will enable one to easily connect
mobile ﬂeet ofﬁces with corporate applications. Video baseband allows Inmarsat
users to relay video from almost anywhere on the globe. This provides an effective
ﬂexible solution for media companies and the growing number of corporation who
also use the VC system to facilitate “real-time” discussion on a regular basis. Users
beneﬁt from ISDN speeds and easy-to-use portable equipment, which delivers
immediate live action, training, or medical and equipment diagnostic support, as
required.
3.1.4
Basic Concept of Modulation
Modulation is when the signal message that is to be conveyed is transposed in
baseband signals, such as voice or raw PC data, into a suitable form so that it can be
transmitted over the media involved, usually plain air with absorbing gases as
described earlier. The raw data or voice signal can be modulated onto a carrier
frequency as illustrated in Fig. 3.1 (left), and demodulated (Right). Thus, a fre-
quency carrier is selected to suit propagation conditions, and then spectrum and
frequency management constraints and ITU radio regulations and efﬁcient and
reliable transportation of the information across the media. There are mathematical
equations that describe this modulation process. The reverse process demodulation
is when the useful information is extracted from the unuseful carrier.
3.1
Baseband Signals
195

There are many different types of modulation schemes available to the radio
designers. In principle, these can be broken down into analog modulation such as
amplitude or frequency modulation (AM or FM) schemes or variants on these, as
can be used to modulate voice signals. More recently, digital modulation such as
frequency-shift keying (FSK), phase-shift keying (PSK), or advanced variants of
these can be used to convey digital messages and/or digitized voice streams, or of
course both.
The selections of appropriate modulation schemes for an application are usually
dependent on, but not necessarily limited to, the following factors: 1. required
ranges of propagation; 2. frequency of operation and propagation properties; 3.
spectral efﬁciency; 4. equipment complexity, reliability, size weight, and cost; and
5. required data or voice throughput rate and regulatory constraints.
The modulation conundrum of unmodulated signal is shown in Fig. 3.2 (left)
and modulated signal (right), how baseband unmodulated signal is transforming
into modulated baseband signal in frequency domain. At this point, there is a

relationship between all of these aspects; mathematically, it is Shannon’s law; and it
is usually necessary to trade off one requirement against the others to achieve the
best overall engineering solution. In reality, for low-speciﬁcation systems where
performance is not so critical, rugged and rudimentary low-order modulation
schemes can work very efﬁciently, and this keeps cost and complexity down. For
some of the more sophisticated systems where data throughput in a limited band-
width is premium, some of the more sophisticated and elaborate modulation
schemes pushing the limits of Shannon’s law become applicable if not essential.
3.1.5
Analog and Digital Domains
Before coming into the details of the modulation schemes employed by the aero-
nautical systems, it is worth momentarily looking at the analog-to-digital (A/D)
aspects of signal modulation. Modern communication systems generally digitize
voice, data, and images and transmit them via a digital medium, where quality can
generally be kept, before putting them back in their original analog domains. With
data, there is never any A/D and it stays entirely in the digital domain. In such a
way, the modulation process can be considered as the inverse of this process; i.e.,
data is modulated onto a carrier conversion, which is akin to digital-to-analog (D/A)
version, and then, it is transmitted over the media and converted back to digital via
A/D conversion at the end, illustrated in Table 3.1.
With voice over legacy radio systems, it is never even coming into the digital
domain. It is analog when it starts; it goes through an analog-to-analog conversion
as it is modulated; and then, at the end, it is an analog-to-analog demodulation
process.
Analog modulation is the supporting emissions of double-sideband amplitude
modulation (DSB-AM), single-sideband AM (SSB-AM), and suppressed carrier
AM (SC-AM), and the frequency modulation (FM) scheme is the supporting
emissions of phase-shift keying (PSK), frequency-shift keying (FSK), differential
phase-shift keying (DPSK), differential frequency-shift keying (DFSK), quadrature
amplitude modulation (QAM), and trellis coded modulation (TCM).

3.2
Analog Transmission
Analog transmission is characterized by processing performed on the baseband
signal before and after modulation in order to improve the quality of the link. The
carrier can support only one or few channels for the transmission of baseband
signals. In the case of a carrier transmitted from the station representing only a
single-user channel, this is SCPC transmission. On the other hand, if the carrier
represents a number of multiplexed users, it is designated multiple channel per
carrier (MCPC) and also are using several channels of frequency division multi-
plexing (FDM) transfer.
A signal needs to be impressed on an RF carrier for transmission through the
satellite, and for this purpose, it uses a process known as modulation. The objective
of any communications is to transmit the modulated carrier to Rx as reliably as
possible, so that the demodulated signals can be satisfactorily recovered. In analog
transmission systems, the information waveform in the form of voice, data, or video
signals are modulated directly from the source onto the carrier at the modulator of
Tx, by using the methods of amplitude modulation (AM), frequency modulation
(FM), and phase modulation (PM). Frequency and phase modulations are used most
widely for direct analog transmission in satellite communications, while amplitude
modulation is a process used indirectly in the satellite link.
Modulation may also be used at very low frequencies, like the more common
and various forms of PSK modulation scheme. In addition, modulation is often
done on a carrier with an RF of about 70 MHz lower than the transmission RF.
This RF is then upconverted to the transponder frequencies on 6/4 GHz for
ampliﬁcation and retransmission. However, the previous types of satellite do not
change the received modulation before retransmission. Satellites are now being
designed to allow only one modulation method to be employed in the uplink and
another for the downlink; each link can be optimized. The space link between two
LES can generally be accomplished by the combination of modulation and multi-
plexing techniques.
In the context of analog modulation will be included speciﬁc schemes as well as
DSB-AM, SSB-AM, and SC-AM.
3.2.1
Baseband Processing
The purpose of baseband processing is to improve the quality of the space (satellite)
link using different methods whose cost is less than that arising from modiﬁcation
of one of the parameters involved in the link budget. The principal methods of
baseband processing for telephone transmission are speech activation, pre- and
de-emphasis, and companding and for TV transmission pre- and de-emphasis only.
198
3
Transmission Techniques

3.2.1.1
Speech Activation
The principle of speech activation is to establish the space link only when the
subscriber is actually speaking. As the activity factor is τ = 0.25, its application to a
multicarrier SCPC system should permit a reduction of the power required on the
satellite by about 6 dB.
In practice, the reduction is only in the order of 4 dB, allowing guard times for
activation and deactivation of the carrier and the sensitivity of S/N spikes.
Therefore, the activation threshold parameter has to be from –30 to –40 dBmo, the
carrier activation time can be 6–10 ms, and deactivation time can be 150–200 ms.
3.2.1.2
Pre- and De-emphasis
The noise at the output of the demodulator of a FM transmission has a parabolic
spectral density, when the high-frequency components of the signal are more
affected by noise than the low frequencies. Figure 3.3 shows the principle of the
pre- and de-emphasis effects. The pre-emphasis ﬁlter prior to modulation of the
signal increases the amplitude of the high-frequency components.
The gain of the crossover frequency in the pre-emphasis ﬁlter is 0 dB. After
demodulation, the de-emphasis ﬁlter is performing inverse effects, namely reducing
the amplitude of the high-frequency signal and noise power. In such a way, the
signal is restored without spectral distortion and the S/N is improved. The
improvement can be 4–5 dB for telephony and around 13 dB for TV signals.

Companding Process
Companding is a process of compression and expansion for reducing the effect of
noise on speech channels in accordance with the speciﬁcation of CCITT
Recommendations G.162 and article G.166. In effect, a compandor comprises a
compressor and an expander, and an improvement in the S/N ratio at the output of
the demodulator is obtained by reducing the dynamic range of the signal before
modulation (compression) and performing the inverse operation after demodulation
(expansion) in order to restore the original speech signal to its correct relative level.
These circuits perform the task of modifying the speech signal in analog voice
channels; thus, when the gain of the compressor and expander is controlled by the
speech power at a syllabic rate, the technique is referred to as syllabic companding.
The characteristics of a typical compressor and expander are shown in Fig. 3.4
(left). The compressor varies in such a way that an input level of x dB results in an
output level of x/2 dB. For instance, input levels to the compressor of +10 by 0 (the
reference level) and –60 dB result in output levels from the compressor of +5 in
relation to the 0 and –30 dB, respectively. The signal characteristic of the expander
is inverse to that of the compressor. It is not practicable to use compressors and
expanders with a ratio of greater than 2:1.
The effect of companding on the relative levels of a signal and the noise added
during transmission, i.e., after the compression and before the expander, is shown in
Fig. 3.4 (right). The compressor raises the power of weak signals relative to the
noise. In this way, for an input signal at a level of –40 dB, the effect of the
compressor is to raise the S/N power ratio from 0 to 20 dB. Otherwise, in the
absence of companding, a signal would be at the same level as the noise. The
expander restores the original level of the speech signal, and it reduces the level of
the noise.
For example, if the noise level at the receiver input between syllables is –40 dB
with respect to the zero reference level, the corresponding noise level after

expansion is reduced from –40 to –80 dB. The improvement in S/N ratio is the
result of attenuation and is subjective, since it is associated with the absence of
perceived noise during silences in the conversation. It is considered to be in the
order of 15 dB.
3.2.2
Analog Modulation and Multiplexing
Source waveforms of analog signals are directly modulated onto RF or IF carriers at
the transmitter, using any form of three types of modulation: AM, FM, or PM.
Analog modulation is a process in which some characteristics of a HF carrier are
varied in accordance with the baseband signal, which is the creation, transmission,
and reception of EM ﬁelds. In reality, EM ﬁelds and waves can be used to com-
municate all kinds of information from place to place. Therefore, an analog mod-
ulated signal can be represented as the following sinusoidal wave:
cðtÞ ¼ A cos ½2pf t þ u
ð3:2Þ
where A = amplitude, 2πf = form of ωc = angular frequency of the carrier,
f = frequency, and φ = carrier phase. Modulation can be achieved by altering the
amplitude, frequency, or phase of the wave in accordance with the information
signals. Consequently, AM, FM, and PM analog carriers are simply forms of
modulated carriers in which either amplitude, frequency, or phase is modulated by
the information waveform.
Thus, by changing the amplitude, frequency, or phase is resulting in AM, FM, or
PM mode, respectively, which is illustrated in Fig. 3.5. In fact, since EM ﬁelds are
vector ﬁelds, it is also possible to modulate the polarization of a radio wave to
communicate information. However, polarization modulation is only normally used
for special purposes, as the polarization state of a wave can easily be “scrambled”
during free-space transmission by effects such as unwanted reﬂections from
buildings.
The AM system is a type of linear modulation in which the baseband signal is
linearly related to the modulated signal, while FM and PM are kinds of angle
modulation in which the baseband signal is angularly related to the modulated
signal. However, angle-modulated FM and PM signals require more carrier band-
width than AM but achieve a higher demodulated C/N ratio for the same carrier
C/N value. The reverse process of recovering the information signal from the
modulated carrier at the demodulator of the receiver is known as demodulation.
Multichannel operation of FM for analog high-capacity satellite telephone trans-
mission is normally accomplished by a system called FDM scheme. In such a
system, different channels are separated from one another by being assigned to
different subscribers, which are then combined to ﬁll the total bandwidth of the
transponder.

3.2.2.1
Amplitude Modulation (AM)
Amplitude modulation is a type of linear modulation and is not used as a modu-
lating process in the satellite link. However, it can be used to modulate individual
voice channels before combining them using FDM technique. In AM, the amplitude
of the carrier frequency is modiﬁed by the amplitude of a modulating signal;
namely, a carrier has to be amplitude modulated when the amplitude of the carrier
varies in accordance with the signals. The sidebands are displaced at either side of
the carrier frequency by the magnitude of the modulation frequency, and the
amplitude depends on the modulation amplitude. The fundamental equation of AM
modulation signals is as follows:

ð3:3Þ
where mAM (t) = AM signal represents the information waveform to be transmitted
and Δa = AM index (coefﬁcient giving the degree of modulation of angular
frequency of the carrier).
The AM method is employed usually in AM radio broadcasting and radio-
communication transmissions. In these systems, the intensity or amplitude of the
carrier wave varies in accordance with the modulating signal. When the carrier is
thus modulated, a fraction of the power is converted to sideband extending above
and below the carrier frequency by an amount equal to the highest modulating
frequency. If the modulated carrier is rectiﬁed and the carrier frequency ﬁltered out,
the modulating signal can be recovered. This form of AM is not a very efﬁcient way
to send information because the power required is quite large and because the
carrier, which contains no information, is sent along with the information. In AM,
the information is carried out only in the sidebands, and therefore, power in the
carrier remains unutilized. In a double-sideband suppressed carrier (DSB-SC),
modulation of the carrier is suppressed and only sidebands are used. The amplitude
of this wave does not follow the signal amplitude, and consequently, the inherent
simplicity of using envelope detection is lost. Therefore, this modulation is not used
in satellite communications.
In a variant of amplitude modulation, called single sideband (SSB), the modu-
lated signal contains only one sideband and no carrier. The information can be
demodulated only if the carrier is used as a reference. This is normally accom-
plished by generating a wave in the receiver at the carrier frequency. The SSB is
used for long-distance HF radiotelephony and telegraphy over land, such as in the
maritime HF radio frequency bands and submarine cables. In the other words, the
SSB scheme is called an SSB suppressed carrier (SSB-SC) when the carrier is
suppressed. The most common application of SSB modulation in satellite com-
munications is to multiplex voice carriers into a composite baseband signal. The
required C/N ratio and the occupied bandwidths are two aspects considered in
assessing the suitability of SSB for satellite transmission. The occupied RF band-
width of an SSB transmission is the same as the baseband bandwidth, which is
4–5 kHz for a single telephone channel transmission. Typical bandwidth of –
30 kHz is necessary for FM and 20 kHz for the O-QPSK, so both schemes are
widely used in satellite communications.
A typical satellite link can economically provide C/N ratios in the order of 10–
12 dB, making SSB transmission inefﬁcient from power considerations. This dis-
advantage can be offset to a large extent by the use of compandors, which offer an
S/N ratio advantage of about 15–20 dB, and in such a manner, SSB transmission
appears attractive. It is called Amplitude Companded SSB (ACSSB). Bandwidth
efﬁciency is essential for MSC service, and for this reason, ACSSB has been
considered favorably for such applications.
3.2

3.2.2.2
Frequency Modulation (FM)
In FM scheme, the amplitude of the carrier frequency is modiﬁed by the frequency
deviation of a modulating signal. The sidebands are displaced at either side of the
carrier frequency with an inﬁnite number of separate bands, most resolving near
zero. The amplitude depends on the modulation frequency change, and the fre-
quency depends on the rate of frequency change of the modulation. Therefore, the
fundamental equations of FM modulation are given below:
cðtÞ ¼ A cos xct 2pDf
Z
mFMðtÞdt þ u


ð3:4Þ
where mFM (t) = FM signal representing the information waveform to be trans-
mitted and Δf = FM index (coefﬁcient giving the degree of modulation angular
frequency of the carrier).
Using FM, the frequency of the carrier wave is varied in such a way that the
change in frequency at any instant is proportional to another signal that varies with
time. The FM band has become the choice of music listeners and for the audio
portion of TV broadcasting because of its low-noise and wide-bandwidth qualities;
however, the FM schemes are also extensively used in satellite communications.
Examples of FM applications are multiplexed telephony, SCPC systems, and TV
broadcasting.
Thus, FM systems are well suited for those cases where the baseband signal is in
analog form. An example is FM with companding used in Rx and Tx voice
channels of the analog Inmarsat-A system of the SES transceiver. Furthermore, this
scheme also offers advantages for transmission of digital data in applications where
simple receivers are essential, such as the Inmarsat paging system. At any rate, an
important requirement of a paging system is the need for simple, low cost, and
rugged receivers.
3.2.2.3
Phase Modulation (PM)
Phase modulation (PM) like frequency modulation is a form of angle modulation
so-called because the angle of the sine wave carrier is changed by the modulating
wave. The two methods are very similar in the sense that any attempt to shift the
frequency or phase is accomplished by a change in the other. The PM relation can
be expressed with:
cðtÞ ¼ A cos xct þ DpmPMðtÞ þ u

where mPM (t) = PM signal representing the information waveform to be trans-
mitted and Δp = PM index, in which coefﬁcient is giving the degree of modulation

3.2.3
Double-Sideband Amplitude Modulation (DSB-AM)
As is known AM is when the amplitude of the carrier is directly proportional to the
modulating signal. Probably, the simplest form of AM is DSB-AM mode, whose
diagram is illustrated in Fig. 3.6 (left). The DSB-AM emission is described
mathematically with the following equation:
fcðtÞ ¼ A cos 2p fct þ u
ð
Þ p
ð3:6Þ
where foci(t) is the modulated signal output. Thus, from this relation, it is possible to
derive the following equation:
A ¼ K þ fmðtÞ
ð3:7Þ
where K is the unmodulated carrier amplitude and fm (t) is the baseband signal,
which can be deﬁned by the following equation:
fmðtÞ ¼ a cos 2p fmt
ð

ð3:8Þ
The DSB-AM emission can be also presented as follows:

At this point, depth of modulation (m) = modulating signal amplitude (a)/un-
modulated carrier amplitude (K). In the frequency domain, these discrete compo-
nents are shown in Fig. 3.6 (right) and are called upper and lower sidebands,
respectively.

Analog Transmission
205

It is interesting to note that the modulated bandwidth of DSB-AM is twice the
size of the minimum baseband bandwidth or the frequency component. It is
independent of depth of modulation.
Following are the advantages of DSB-AM:
1. It is very easy to synthesize DSB-AM in nonlinear device such as diode or
transistor;
2. It is very easy to demodulate DSB-AM in non-coherent detection, which uses a
simple diode, capacitor, and resistor circuit or can use a coherent detector;
3. It is incredibly simple to work with, troubleshoot, and see the waveforms at
every stage of the process;
4. There is always a carrier present, even when no information is being sent; this
means a receiver can easily tune to this carrier frequency and keep locked to it;
and
5. In the amplitude domain, signals cannot get distorted or shifted by Doppler
shifts of receivers and transmitters that are physically moving with relation to
one another.
Some of the relative disadvantages of DSB-AM when comparing this modula-
tion to other schemes can be the following:
1. At its best performance, only one-third of power being transmitted is the
information signal, and the other two-thirds of power is absorbed by the carrier
and is not useful. This is with a modulation index of M = 100 %, which in
theory can never be fully reached, and so, the practical realization of this is even
worse, with typically always less than 25 % power transfer efﬁciency.
2. DSB-AM uses more RF bandwidth than is actually needed. As was previously
pointed out, the RF bandwidth required is double the maximum baseband fre-
quency component. More elaborate modulation schemes can half this or reduce
it even more; and
3. There is no encryption of the signal, so it is easy to interfere with (security, etc.).
3.2.4
Single-Sideband Amplitude Modulation (SSB-AM)
With DSB-AM practical work, it is found that the upper sideband is a perfect
reﬂection of the lower sideband; i.e., the same information is carried by both. By
removing one of the sidebands and by removing the carrier, therefore, no infor-
mation is lost and the S/N (signal-to-noise) ratio increases for a given transmit
power as all the transmitted energy is concentrated in the information signal. This is
the basis for SSB-AM block diagram and power spectrum illustrated in Fig. 3.7.
The construction of an SSB is fractionally more complicated than that of
DSB-AM. It can be synthesized in two different ways.
206

Transmission Techniques

Method 1—As SSB indirect synthesis and ﬁltering is shown in Fig. 3.8, a SSB
signal can be synthesized either by using basic DSB-AM or DSB-SC-AM modu-
lator and ﬁltering out the unwanted carrier and sideband (usually done at a IF).
Method 2—Arguably, a more elegant way of modulation is to use Hilbert
modulator as SSB direct synthesis, which essentially cancels out the unwanted
sideband and carrier.
Mathematically, this is described with the following equation:
Vout ¼ 0:5 k cos 2p 2f  fm

ð
Þ ¼ 0:5 k cos 2p fm
ð
Þt cos U  0:5 k sin 2p fm
ð
Þ sin u
ð3:12Þ
For demodulation, a Costas loop is required to present SSB demodulation as
shown in Fig. 3.8.
Following are the advantages of SSB-AM:
1. As already stated, all transferred power is concentrated into the useful sideband
carrying information. This gives transmitters efﬁciency theoretically up to
100 %; in reality, a more practical ﬁgure about 70 % is very useful for HF SSB
telephony;
2. It is twice as bandwidth efﬁcient as the DSB-AM system.
Disadvantages of SSB-AM are as follows:

Book: by Stacey
3.2
Analog Transmission
207

More sophisticated demodulation is required (coherent detector with PLL,
Costas loop).
It can be prone to phase distortions (due to Tx and Rx oscillators beating and Φ
changing), so high oscillator speciﬁcation is required at both ends, not really heard
by listeners (quality not high).
The aeronautical HF system and other SSB systems are using SSB modulation
for the reasons of spectral efﬁciency and a limited resource, which will be discussed
further in Chap. 9. Also, a number of earlier military systems are known to have
used SSB as a basis.
Suppressed carrier double-sideband AM (SCDSB-AM) is modulation technique
also used in aeronautical radio trafﬁc. Worth mentioning in passing, there is an
intermediate version of modulation called suppressed carrier double-sideband AM,
which lies between DSB-AM and SSB-AM.
In its basic form, it is same as DSB-AM, with the carrier ﬁltered out. It has the
advantage of concentrating more power into the useful sidebands, so there is an S/N
improvement; however, there is no bandwidth saving and it requires a more
complex synthesis. It is rarely used, as most applications will do a full conversion to
the SSB, where power and spectral efﬁciency become important and there are no
mainstream applications of this in the aeronautical bands. However, there are some
specialist military systems using this for aeronautical communication.

3.2.5
Frequency Division Multiplexing (FDM)
The process of combining baseband signals and sharing the communication
channels is known as multiplexing, while the reverse process of extracting indi-
vidual baseband signals is called demultiplexing. The CCITT proposed all multi-
plexing standards including FDM, which is applicable only to telephony baseband
signals, whereas the digital time division multiplexing (TDM) standard is appli-
cable to all types of baseband signals.
Each type of MES usually transmits and receives many kinds of signal trans-
missions to and from spacecraft. Multiplexing enables the division of channels or
the combination of two or more input signals into a single output for transmission.
In effect, the most common and known analog multiplexing method is FDM, which
is used in satellite communication transmissions. The simplest approach to multi-
plexing is to assign a speciﬁc part of the available frequency or bandwidth spectrum
to each signal. If two signals initially have the same spectrum, the frequency of one
or both is shifted, so in such a way, they will not overlap. Therefore, the FDM is a
multiplexing solution where signals occupy the channel at the same time but on
different frequencies; namely, different message signals are separated from each
other in frequency. The multiplexing scenario of FDM is shown in Fig. 3.9, as a
concept of FDM, which illustrates simultaneous transmission of three message
signals over a common communication channel. It is clear from the block schematic
arrangement shown that each of the three messages signals modulates a different
carrier.
Thus, the FM mode is used for some specialist military systems, in aeronautical
telemetry and ﬁnally in the adjacent band to the VHF aeronautical communications
for broadcasting information. It is mainly used by broadcasting in the band between
88 and 108 MHz, just below the VHF navigation and communication bands

108.000–117.975 and 117.975–137.000 MHz, respectively. However, a clear
understanding of FM is potentially useful for adjacent channel compatibility work.
In addition, it is synthesized using a voltage-controlled oscillator. Also, it is more
susceptible to Doppler shifts, which even though these have been shown to be very
minor in the previous section, make it impractical for mobile aeronautical com-
munications. Historically, FM gives a better quality of voice service. The FM
modulation is used by entertainment systems on board aircraft where channels are
FDM into time slots. Otherwise, the most common used modulation technique in
aeronautical telephony is SSB.
3.3
Digital Transmission
Before providing any explanation about solutions of digital transmission will be
necessary to introduce some relations:
1. Shannon’s Theory—Shannon’s theory provides a theoretical relationship
between bits per second, baud, and S/N for error-free transmission presented in
Table 3.2.
R ðb=sÞ ¼ M number of signal states
ð
Þ x r baud or signal rate
ð
Þ; and
ð3:13Þ


ð3:14Þ
where C is channel capacity in b/s, B is bandwidth in Hz, S/N is signal-to-noise
ratio, and R is the data rate and is always <C for errorless transmission. If R > C,
errors will occur. Theoretical relationship between M and S/N is as follows:
M ¼
1 þ S=N
ð
Þ
½
0:5 or S=N ¼ M21
ð3:15Þ
2. Non-Errorless Transmission—Of course, Shannon’s law does not apply if it is
decided to push past this theoretical limit of data throughput if errors can be
tolerated. Actually, it is sometimes a prudent approach to tolerate the errored
environment and to make facilities for correcting them by forward error

correction (FEC) and cyclic redundancy coding (CRC); of course, FEC and
CRC too are overhead and not useful data payload. However, this can be a more
efﬁcient way to operate and maximize data throughput. Alternatively, the errors
can just be tolerated, and the application layer of the data system can be
designed to tolerate this or to correct it. Also in a number of digital systems,
errors will be present from the propagation problems already present, and these
have to be tolerated. These too can be corrected by FEC or CRC checks, or other
mechanisms discussed later.
Digital transmission relates to the link for which the MES is designed to produce
the digital signals by PC or modem and to send them through Tx. It is possible to
transmit analog signals (voice or broadcast) in digital form. Although this choice
implies an increased baseband, it permits signals from diverse origins to be
transmitted on the same satellite channels and the satellite link to be incorporated in
ISDN, which implies the use of TDM. The digitization of analog signals implies the
stages of sampling, quantization, and coding. The simple digital transmission chain
includes a transmitting and receiving segment. The ﬁrst unit of the transmitting
segment is TDM with input signals from digital (direct) and analog (via encoder)
sources and after multiplexed signals pass devices such as data encryption, channel
encoding, scrambling, and digital modulation, where the digital signal is transmitted
through up or down satellite links. In the receiving segment of reverse mode,
incoming signal goes through devices such as demodulator, descrambling, channel
decoding, data decryption, and TDM demultiplexing in its direction to different
users.
Digital signals use the same principle to modulate a carrier as analog signals.
The AM, FM, and PM schemes are all applicable to digital modulation; digital
equivalents are ASK, FSK, and PSK; and special hybrid modulation solutions have
also been developed to optimize digital modulation, such as QAM. The pioneering
generation of MSS of Marisat and the ﬁrst Inmarsat-A SES used analog FM for the
voice circuits and digital PSK for the telex and signaling trafﬁc. However, the
current generation of Inmarsat standards for all mobile applications uses a com-
bination of analog and digital transmission techniques and/or full digital modulation
and multiplexing. In addition, newly developed MSS non-GEO systems such as
Iridium, Globalstar, and others usually employ digital solutions.
3.3.1
Delta Modulation (DM)
Analog signals, such as speech and video signals, generally have a considerable
amount of redundancy; namely, there is a signiﬁcant correlation between successive
samples. Thus, when these correlated samples are coded as in the pulse code
modulation (PCM) system, the resulting digital stream contains redundant infor-
mation. The redundancy in these analog signals makes it possible to predict a
sample value from the preceding sample values and to transmit the difference
3.3
Digital Transmission
211

between the actual sample value and the predicted sample value estimated from the
past samples. This results in a technique called difference encoding. One of the
simplest forms of this is DM, which provides a staircase approximation of the
sampled version of the analog input signal. This type of modulation is a way of
digitizing a voice waveform, transmitting the digits and reconstructing the original
analog waveform that avoids the quantizer and the A/D and D/A converters
employed in PCM. In linear delta modulation (LDM), a circuit of DM determines
the difference between an incoming waveform or message signal m(t) and estimated
waveform or error signal e(t), where a difference of signal error voltage is as
follows:
DmðtÞ ¼ mðtÞeðtÞ
ð3:16Þ
The quantizer output is a positive constant when Δm(t) is positive and vice versa.
Namely, the difference between the input and the approximation is quantized into
two levels, +Δ and –Δ, corresponding to a positive and a negative difference,
respectively. Moreover, at any sampling instant, the approximation can be increased
or decreased by step size (Δ) value, depending on whether it is below or above the
analog input signal.
Furthermore, a digital output of 1 or 0 can be generated according to whether the
difference is +Δ or –Δ. These pulses go to a conventional PSK digital modulator for
transmission. Increasing the step size (Δ) will result in poor resolution, and
increasing the sampling rate will lead to a higher digital bit rate. In LDM, the step
size is ﬁxed at a value that provides performance near the peak, while better ﬁnal
performance may be achieved through a scheme of adaptive delta modulation
(ADM) in which the value of step size is varied during the modulation process. On
the other hand, it is difﬁcult to make comparisons between the performance of PCM
and DM because the latter is continually improving. Thus, most commercial
satellite links to date use PCM for digital transmission of speech, while DM has
been used for military satellite applications.
The DM mode has various forms, so in one of the simplest form, only one bit is
transmitted per sample just to indicate whether the amplitude of the current sample
is greater or smaller than the amplitude of the immediately preceding sample.
It has extremely simple encoding and decoding processes, but then it may result
in tremendous quantizing noise in case of rapidly varying signal. In Fig. 3.10 is
illustrated a simple delta modulator (DM) of DM system, where m(t) is added to a
reference signal with the polarity shown. However, in Fig. 3.10 is shown the DM

of
the
delta-modulated signal. The error signal is fed to comparator and at output of
comparator is (+Δ) for e(t) > 0 and (−Δ) for e(t) < 0.
Thus, the output of DM is a series of impulses with the polarity of each impulse
depending upon the signal of e(t) at the sampling instants of time. A DM signal can
be demodulated by integrating the modulated signal to obtain the staircase
approximation and then passing it through lower ﬁlter. The smaller the Δ value, the
better is the reproduction of the message signal.

3.3.2
Coded Modulation (CM)
The CM is a combination of modulation and error correction codes without
degrading the power of bandwidth efﬁciency. Thus, using FEC, such as block and
convolutional codes, the bit error performance is improved by expanding the
required bandwidth. Obtaining the power efﬁciency requires twice the bandwidth of
the original uncoded signal because of the increase in the symbol rate of modulation
and complex implementation. This can be done by increasing the number of phases
in PSK modulation without expanding signal bandwidth. In this case, the 8-PSK
signals with 2/3 rate of convolutional code have the same bandwidth as uncoded
4-PSK. However, the bit error performance degrades by about 4 dB due to an
increase in phase but will be referable if the coding gain becomes more than 4 dB.
There are two practical CM in use for MSS: the trellis coded modulation
(TCM) and the block coded modulation (BCM).

3.3.2.1
Trellis Coded Modulation (TCM)
The TCM scheme uses the combination of convolutional coding and expanded
signal sets of 8-PSK to transmit two information bits per symbol. The modulation
signals in TCM are assigned to each one- or two-satellite trellis branch, although
binary code symbols are assigned in the convolutional codes. Here is a very
important deﬁnition of measuring the distance between modulation signals assigned
to each trellis branch. The modulation signal assignment in TCM can be designed
either by the Euclidean or Hamming distances.
Initially, the modulator states are based on a trellis illustrated in Fig. 3.11 (left).
This scheme is intelligent and involves more signals processing theory than the
simpler prior modulation schemes. This sample works on the principle of putting
states that are likely to occur simultaneously as far apart on the constellation dia-
gram shown in Fig. 3.11 (right), with maximum distance of separation employing
Euclidean distance. This sample is showing variable phase and amplitudes deter-
mining Euclidean distance as the distance between two points in constellation.
Similarly, a binary sequence that is unlikely to occur can be put together on the
constellation diagram with minimum Euclidean distance. Thus, this offers an
effective coding gain over the simpler QAM for a given BER and data throughput
would consequently require a lower SNR than QAM
The performance of TCM can be improved by increasing the number of states or
by modifying the signal constellation. At this point, one solution is provided by
multidimensional signals and another is performed by multiple coded modulations,
known as multiple TCM (MTCM). A TCM 8-DPSK modem with a rate of 2/3 and
16 states for 4800 b/s has been implemented in the NASA MSAT-X experimental
program for LMSC.

Instead of convolutional coding, this scheme uses short binary block codes, which
could be simpler and faster to decode. Similar to TCM, this type of modulation can
improve performance by using multiple BCM (MBCM). Thus, MBCM with two
symbols per branch has a coding gain of 3 dB relative to conventional BCM. The
two symbols per branch MBCM has a performance for coding gains of 1.1 and

2.2 dB at BER = 10−3 relative to the BCM 8-PSK and the uncoded QPSK,
respectively.
3.3.3
Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)
The digitization starts with the conversion of analog voice signals into a digital
format. An analog can be converted into a digital signal of equal quality if the
analog signal is sampled at a rate that corresponds to at least twice the signal’s
maximum frequency.
The peak-to-peak amplitude rate of the modulating signal in PCM is divided into
a number of standard levels, which in the case of binary systems is an integral
power of 2. The amplitude of the signal to be sent at any sampling instant is the
nearest standard level. So, if at a particular sampling instant, the signal amplitude is
3.2 V, it will not be sent as a 3.2 V pulse, as can be the case of pulse amplitude
modulation (PAM); instead, it will be sent as the digit 3, if 3 V is the nearest
standard amplitude. Thus, where the signal range has been divided into 28 levels, it
will be transmitted as 0000011, which coded waveform is shown in Fig. 3.12. This
scheme is known as quantizing process in PCM shown in Fig. 3.12, where the
number of bits for 2n chosen standard levels per code group is n + 1. In fact, it is
evident that the quantizing process distorts the signals. This distortion is referred to

a quantizing noise, which is random in nature as the error in the signal’s amplitude
and that actually sent after quantizing is random. The maximum error can be as high
as half of sampling interval, in which number of level is 16 or 1/32 of total signal
amplitude range. A technique for converting an analog signal to a digital form is
PCM, which requires three operations:
1. Sampling—This operation converts the continuous analog signal into a set of
periodic pulses, the amplitudes of which represent the instantaneous amplitudes
of the analog signal at the sampling instant. Thus, the process of sampling
involves reading of input signals at discrete points in time. Hence, the sampled
signals consist of electrical pulses, which vary in accordance with the amplitude
of the input signal. In accordance with the Nyquist sampling rate, an analog
signal of bandwidth B Hz must be sampled at a rate of at least 1/2B to preserve
its wave shape when reconstructed.
2. Quantizing—This technique is the process of representing the continuous
amplitude of the samples by a ﬁnite set of levels. If V quantizer levels are
employed to represent the amplitude range, it take the log2 V bit to code each
sample. In voice transmission, 256 quantized levels are employed; hence, each
sample is coded using log2 256 = 8 bits, and thus, the digital bit rate is
8000 × 8 = 64,000 b/s.
The process of quantization introduces distortion into the signal, making the
received voice signals raspy and hoarse. This type of distortion is known as
quantization noise, which is only present during speech. However, when a large
number of quantization steps, each of ΔS volts, are used to quantize a signal having
an rms signal level Srms, the signal-to-quantization noise ratio is given by the
following equation:
Sqn ¼ Srms
ð
Þ2= DS
ð
Þ2=12
ð3:17Þ
A large number of bits are necessary to provide an acceptable signal-to-
quantization noise ratio throughout the dynamic amplitude range. Some analysis of
speech signals shows that smaller amplitude levels have a much higher probability
of occurrence than high levels.
3. Coding—This solution protects message signals from impairment by adding
redundancy to the message signal. Another important approach in digital coding
of analog signals is differential PCM. This is basically a modiﬁcation of DM
where the difference between the analog input signals and their approximation at
the sampling instant is quantized into V levels and the output of the encoder is
coded into log2 V bits. In such a way, it combines the simplicity of DM and the
multilevel quantizing feature of PCM mode and in many applications can
provide good reproduction of analog signals comparable to PCM, with a con-
siderable reduction in the digital bit rate.

Quadrature Amplitude Modulation (QAM)
Each higher PSK modulation requires a better S/N ratio performance, which is
difﬁcult to achieve without special schemes. Instead of 16 or higher PSK modu-
lation, QAM is used, which is a combination of amplitude and phase modulation. In
effect, modulation can be achieved in a similar manner to that of QPSK, by which
the in-phase and quadrature carrier components are independently amplitude
modulated by the incoming data streams. The incoming signals are detected at the
receiver using matched ﬁlters. In terms of bandwidth, it is a highly efﬁcient method
for transmitting data ﬂow. However, the sensitivity of the QAM method to variation
in amplitude limits its applicability to satellite communication systems in practice,
where nonlinear payload characteristics may distort the waveform, resulting in the
reception of erroneous messages.
The QAM scheme is a combination of the phase domain. The number of pos-
sible states = 360/number of phase changes used. The functional block diagram of
modulator for QAM is shown in Fig. 3.13 (left). The demodulation and detection
process for QAM signals shown in Fig. 3.13 (right) becomes quite complex, but is
not unachievable with modern technology. It is used frequently in high-capacity
data point-to-point radio links. 64QAM, 128QAM, 256QAM, and even 518QAM
are not uncommon. Obviously, these have high spectral efﬁciency in the amount of
data per unit RF bandwidth they are able to pass. But consequently, a very good
SNR is needed to retain a high BER. In Fig. 3.18d is shown a 16-QAM signal space
diagram with a 16-state grid that permits both carrier amplitude and phase change.
This scheme is not yet considered favorable for satellite communication.

3.3.5
Time Division Multiplexing (TDM)
Satellite links normally relay many signals from many MES, but to avoid inter-
fering with each other, it is necessary for some kind of separation or division. This
separation is known as multiplexing, and its common forms are FDM (already
explained) and TDM. The TDM is easier to implement with digital modulation and
to form hybrid solutions applicable to all type of baseband signals.
The TDM is a time multiplexing solution where a group of various transmission
signals on the same frequency at different times take turns using a channel. In this
way, a group of pulses from a number of channels may be interleaved to form a
single high-rate bit stream of multiplexed assembly directly modulated onto the RF
carrier. Since digital signals are precisely timed and consist of short pulse groups
with relatively long intervals between them, TDM is the only natural way to
combine digital signals for transmission. This system has the advantage that less
equipment is required than is needed to modulate each channel onto a separate
carrier and that the transmission efﬁciency of a satellite is usually better when it is
carrying a few transmissions on many channels and vice versa. Accurate timing is
essential to the correct operation of digital systems. For that reason, the TDM
system uses a synchronous clock, which controls the timing of all slave clocks and
plesiochronous independent clocks with very good accuracy. If the transmission is
without errors and breaks, in the synchronous system it would be only necessary to
provide single markers at the beginning of transmission where the decoder could
identify all streams of bits.
The TDM is using when there is one RF channel shared in time between the
different users. If a suitable TDM repetition frequency is chosen, the user does not
need to be aware of the discontinuity shown in Fig. 3.14. This is the principle
deployed in modern ground cable and ﬁber networks to which the radio systems
described in this book need to interface.
However, in any practical communication system, regular markers must be
provided in the bit stream so that the decoder can extract groups of digitally
representative samples, identify the channels of a TDM assembly, and resynchro-
nize the system after errors, breaks of transmission, or drift of the clock. Therefore,
when plesiochronous time multiplexes are combined to form higher order of TDM,

it is necessary, in order to preserve synchronism over the long term, to allow for the
occasional addition of dummy or padding bits.
3.3.6
Types of Digital Shift Keying
Digital signals can be used to modulate the amplitude, frequency, and phase, and
therefore, the solutions of shift keying available for digital modulation are
amplitude-shift keying (ASK), frequency-shift keying (FSK), and minimum-shift
keying (MSK) as applications of FSK and phase-shift keying (PSK).
In terms of performance, ASK and FSK, both illustrated in Fig. 3.15a, b,
respectively, require twice as much power to attain the same BER performance as
PSK, shown in Fig. 3.15c. At the top of the same ﬁgure, a stream of a digital signal
with 1 and 0 binary state is presented. Consequently, the vast majority of MSS
employs a method of phase modulation known as PSK.
3.3.6.1
Amplitude-Shift Keying (ASK)
This scheme can be accomplished simply by the on–off gating of a continuous
carrier. The simplest ASK technique is to represent one binary level (binary 1) by a
single signal of ﬁxed amplitude and the other level (binary 0) by switching off the
signal. The absence of the signal for one of the binary levels has the disadvantage
that if fault conditions exist, it could be misinterpreted as received data. Waveform
for ASK, using different amplitude signals for the logic levels, are an alternative
method to prevent this disadvantage. As with speech telephony circuits, the upper
sideband and carrier may be suppressed to reduce the bandwidth requirement and
concentrate the available power on the signal containing the information.

3.3.6.2
Frequency-Shift Keying (FSK)
This solution may be used whereby the carrier frequency has one value for a 1 bit
and another for a 0 bit. The main difﬁculty in the use of this FM technique is that
the gap between the frequencies used must be increased as the modulation rate
increases.
More exactly, for a restricted channel bandwidth, especially using in-band
supervisory signaling, there is a limit to the maximum bit rate that is possible with
this technique.
3.3.6.3
Minimum-Shift Keying (MSK)
The MSK is a binary form of continuous-phase frequency-shift keying (CPFSK),
where the frequency deviation (Δf) from the carrier is set at half the reciprocal data
rate of 1/2T. The MSK scheme may also be viewed as a special form of offset
QPSK, consisting of two sinusoidal envelope carriers, employing modulation at
half the bit rate. It is for this reason that the MSK demodulator is usually a coherent
quadrature detector, similar to that for QPSK. The error rate performance is the
same as that of BPSK and QPSK. Similarly, differentially encoded data has the
same error performance as D-PSK. This solution can also be received as an FSK
signal using coherent or non-coherent methods; however, this will degrade the
performance of the link. At any rate, the side lobes of MSK are usually suppressed,
using Gaussian ﬁlters and the modulation method scheme adopted by GSM cellular
systems.
3.3.6.4
Phase-Shift Keying (PSK)
The PSK scheme is a technique using a multistate signaling stream in which the rate
of data transmission can be increased without having to increase the bandwidth. In
this shift keying system, the phase of the carrier changes in accordance with the
baseband digital stream or information content. Hence, a general form of a PSK
scheme is given by expression:
smðtÞ ¼ A cos xt þ /
ð
Þ and / ¼ 2 m þ 1
ð
Þ p=M
ð3:18Þ
where A = amplitude; ω = frequency angle; ф = phase angle varied in accordance
with the information signal; m = integer in the range from 0 to (M – 1); and
M = number of states. Depending on how many bits can be combined in a group of
information as a symbol, there are a number of combination possibilities for PSK
digital carriers.

Combinations of PSK Digital Carriers
There are several types of hybrid solutions used for the combination of PSK digital
carriers. The PSK family is most popular for satellite communications and espe-
cially for MSC. A real-valued band bass signal s(t), which has a common form for
these types of PSK methods, is expressed as follows:
sðtÞ ¼ AðtÞ cos 2pfct þ /ðtÞ

where A (t) = amplitude; fc = carrier frequency of signal s(t); ф (t) = phase angle;
and ωc = frequency angle varied in accordance with the signal s(t). Including
information waveform m(t), the previous relation can be determined as follows:
sðtÞ ¼ Re ½mðtÞ ej2pfct

where Re = real part of the complex in the next bracket; an = information carrying

3.3.7.1
Binary PSK (BPSK)
The simplest form of PSK is binary PSK (BPSK), where the digital information
modulates a sinusoidal carrier. For a general case of M-ary PSK (number of states)
in BPSK, M = 2, so the baseband bit rate and the symbol rates are the same. Binary
data is expressed by an = exp (jфn) for фn = 0 or π, and the phase changes every
data bit of duration period Tb. When p(t) is a rectangular pulse over symbol
duration T = Tb, the BPSK signal is expressed by the following equation:
sðtÞ ¼ Aan cos 2pfct ¼ A cos 2xct þ /n
ð
Þ for nT  t\ðn þ 1Þ T
ð3:22Þ
In Fig. 3.16a, a diagram is illustrated of how, theoretically, the phase of the
carrier changes instantaneously by 180o when the baseband signal switches from 0
to 1.
In addition, Fig. 3.18a represents the two states of the carrier by two vectors with
a phase difference of 180o. In this sense, ф = 0o and ф = 180o when the baseband
signal is 0 and 1, respectively, and A = + V and A = –V when the baseband signal
is 0 and 1, respectively.
Except for standard-A, the TDM/BPSK scheme is used by almost all Inmarsat
standards for process: Forwarding signaling/assignment channels, return request

channels use Aloha BPSK in Inmarsat standard-A, standard-C and Aero, while
Slotted Aloha BPSK is dedicated for Inmarsat standard-M. On the other hand, Tlx
message channel modulation in the forward direction uses TDM BPSK for Inmarsat
standard-A and standard-B and in the return link serves only for Inmarsat
standard-A. In the similar manner, Inmarsat standard-C uses the BPSK (1/2-FEC)
scheme in both directions.
3.3.7.2
Quadrature PSK (QPSK)
For M-ary, PSK is selected from M signals such as exp [j2π (m–1)/M], where
m = 1, 2, …, M, and the resulting signal s(t) is written as follows:

(Q channel), respectively. In such a way, the relation (aI
n, aQ
n ) is (1, 1) for фn = 0;
(1, –1) for фn = π/2; (–1, –1) for фn = π; and (–1, 1) for фn = 3π/2.
In Fig. 3.16b, the shape of QPSK-modulated signals is presented and a QPSK
scheme in the I-Q plane is shown in Fig. 3.18b.
Only two binary digits are needed to describe four possible states as follows: The
ф values of 45o, 135o, 225o, and 315o correspond to 00, 01, 11, and 10, respec-
tively. In fact, each state of the signal carries two bits of information. Thus, a
combination of two bits or more, which corresponds to a discrete state of a signal, is
called a symbol, in the case of QPSK; the symbol rate is half the bit rate. Namely, a
bit rate of 120 Mb/s corresponds, with QPSK, to a symbol rate of 60 Mb/s or
Mbauds.
The QPSK schemes of modulators are basically dual-channel BPSK schemes
shown in Fig. 3.17 (left) and (right), respectively. At this point, one channel pro-
cesses the ui (I) bits and uses the reference carrier, and the other processes the uq
(Q) bits using a 90º phase-shifted version of the reference. The demodulation
signals are passing out via low-power ﬁlter (LPF) and logic circuit. The bits values
ui and uq are selected alternately from the input bit stream. For example, ui may
represent the odd numbers bits and uq the even. In this case, one binary data channel
enters the QPSK modulator, and the outgoing symbol rate is equal to half of the
incoming bit rate. The octal phase modulation known as 8-phase PSK is a constant
amplitude scheme with a higher bandwidth efﬁciency of 3 b/s/Hz, shown in
Fig. 3.18c. The demands of high bit-rate applications are related to images, TV, and
high-deﬁnition television (HDTV) transmission.
3.3.7.3
Offset QPSK (O-QPSK)
The O-QPSK scheme delays the quadrature bit stream by T sec relative to the
in-phase bit stream to restrict the phase transition to phase changes of 0 or π/2 every T
sec. Using aI
n and aQ
n , the equivalent low-pass and resulting signals are expressed by:

The data transmission occurs in the conventional QPSK at the same time in both
I and Q channels. This scheme has larger phase changes than O-QPSK, which has
phase changes of at most ±π/2 data transmission, and large envelope ﬂuctuations
do not occur as they do with Π-phase changes in QPSK. Figure 3.16c shows the
O-QPSK-modulated signal’s shape. The Aloha O-QPSK (1/2-FEC) serves in return
request channels by a transmission speed of 24 Kb/s for Inmarsat-B and 600 b/s for
Aero standards. The Inmarsat-B and Aero standards use 16 Kb/s or 9.6 Kb/s,
respectively, of the APC O-QPSK scheme in voice channel coding/modulation,
while Inmarsat standard-M uses 4.8 Kb/s IMBE in coding O-QPSK. The
Inmarsat-B in Tlx return link uses the TDMA O-QPSK (1/2-FEC) modulation
scheme.

3.3.7.4
Differential PSK (DPSK)
Channel conditions in MSC are more severe than additive white Gaussian noise
channels due to multipath fading, shadowing, and Doppler effects. These problems
can be solved by using differentially coherent detection of encoded signals. The
received signal phase is generally an 180o ambiguity sign, which cannot be resolved
unless some known reference signal is transmitted and a comparison is made. In the
worst case, if such case left unresolved, the received signal could end up being the
complement of the transmitted signal.
When the phase condition is constant for 2T seconds, the DPSK demodulator
can obtain the optimum a posteriori probability. The DPSK scheme can also be
used to remove sign ambiguity at the receiver. Differentially encoding data prior to
modulation occurs when a binary 1 is used to indicate that the current message bit
and prior code bit are of the same polarity and 0 to represent the condition when the
two pulses are of opposite polarity.
The equivalent low-pass signal in the interval of m is given by:
vm ¼ aejð/m/ÞumðtÞ þ nmðtÞ
ð3:26Þ
where α = loss factor; фm = phase difference in m interval; um(t) = signal in m
interval; and nm(t) = Gaussian noise in m interval. The non-coherent detection
technique is useful when the carrier phase is difﬁcult to estimate at the receiver.
In MSC channels, the transmitting oscillator that generates the carrier cannot be
completely stabilized and an MSC link has a low S/N ratio. Besides, for coherent
detection, the bandwidth of the carrier-tracking loop at the Rx must be decreased in
the proper manner to increase the S/N and obtain a good phase reference.
Since propagation characteristics in MSC such as multipath fading and the
Doppler effect cause rapid phase variation, the carrier phase of the Rx signal does
not remain ﬁxed long enough to be estimated. The problem can be solved with
non-coherent detection, which is equivalent low-pass signal in relation to random
phase value (фn), and Gaussian noise is as follows:
vm ¼ aej/nunðtÞ þ nðtÞ
ð3:27Þ
Therefore, noncoherent detection results in the degradation of the bit error
performance with respect to coherent detection. In this case, the BER probability
(Pb) for binary DPSK is determined with the following relation:
Pb ¼ 1=2 exp ðcbÞ
ð3:28Þ
where γb = Eb/N0 is the value of the S/N density ratio per bit signal. In this sense,
when considering the use of DPSK schemes, a trade-off between simpliﬁed receiver
complexities against reduced performance characteristics in the presence of noise,
particularly when employing higher order modulation techniques, needs to be
made.

3.3.7.5
π/4-QPSK
Recently, π/4-QPSK, or π/4 shift QPSK, has become very popular for MSC as well
as for cellular systems because it has a compact spectrum with small spectrum
restoration due to nonlinear ampliﬁcation and can perform differential detection.
Thus, the phase point of this scheme always shifts its phase over successive time
intervals by ±π/4 or ±3π/4. Therefore, the spectrum of this scheme is the same as
that of a QPSK that undergoes an instantaneous ±π/24 or ±π phase transition. In
such a way, the π/4-QPSK signal can reduce the envelope ﬂuctuation due to
band-limited ﬁltering or nonlinear ampliﬁcation more than can QPSK. In a more
general sense, this is because differential detection can be used since π/4-QPSK is
not an offset scheme.
For MSC channels, a strong line-of-sight signal can be expected even in the
Rician fading channel, so coherent demodulation is desirable for improved power
efﬁciency. The bit error performance of coherently detected π/4-QPSK is the same
as that of QPSK. On the other hand, differential detection is also desirable for
simple hardware implementation. The bit error probability for differential coherer
detected π/4-QPSK is given by:

where γb = Eb/N0 and Ik = modiﬁed Bessel function of the ﬁrst kind in k interval
order. The differential detection is about 2–3 dB inferior to the coherent detection in
AWGN and fading channels, and non-coherent detection is also applicable.
Because of these advantages, π/4-QPSK has been chosen as the standard modu-
lation technique for several systems of cellular and satellite mobile communica-
tions. Some experimental results show that in fully saturated ampliﬁer systems,
π/4-QPSK still has signiﬁcant spectral restoration. Thus, to reduce this restoration,
π/4-controlled transition QPSK (CTPSK) uses both sinusoidal shaping pulses and
timing offsets of the phase transition between I and Q channels.
3.3.8
Digital Voice Coding
The MSC transmission applications need the utilization of digital voice (speech)
coding technique, which require high-quality speech coding at bit rates as low as
possible, and that digital voice coding techniques can be classiﬁed in groups of
waveform and parametric coding. The waveform coding group is achieved by
matching as closely as possible the waveform of the original and the reconstructed
signals, while the parametric coding group represents the speech signal using a
model for speech production, such as time-varying linear predictive ﬁlters and
transmission parameters of the ﬁlter only. At the decoder, the speech signal is
226

Transmission Techniques

reconstructed by the inverse prediction ﬁlters, using received parameters. Several
hybrid-coding methods are proposed as a combination of waveform and parametric
coding. In the hybrid coding, both the ﬁlter parameters and the quantized residual
sample, which is the signal that remains after ﬁltering the speech signal, are
transmitted.
3.3.8.1
Adaptive Predictive Coding (APC)
The APC digital technique is based on an initial estimation and prediction of the
input speech (voice) waveform samples, plus a residual (error) signal derived by
comparing the estimated samples with the actual speech input. This initial esti-
mation and residual signal are quantized and transmitted to the receiver, where an
inverse quantized residual signal is fed into a synthesized ﬁlter in order to recon-
struct the speech signal.
Coding efﬁciency is achieved by removing the waveform redundancy in the input
signals. Furthermore, a quantizer operating only on the residual signal requires fewer
bits per sample. The effect of quantization is to distort the reconstructed output speech
signals. Maximum likelihood quantization (MLQ) techniques are used to minimize
quantization noise. On the other hand, an adaptive quantization scheme with a noise-
shaping ﬁlter is used to provide the subjective performance. A combination of short-
term and long-term predictors reduces the variance of the residual signal and the
subsequent quantization error.
The Inmarsat digital MSS utilizes the APC/O-QPSK speech (voice) coding
technique, in which major parameters are systematized within the framework of the
APC system for both standard-B and Aero of 16 and 9.6 Kb/s, respectively. The
typical APC digital codec conﬁguration consists of transmitting and receiving sides,
both including two main components. The Tx side is an APC coder containing an
inverse ﬁlter with predictor of negative predisposition and quantizer (Q), which
produces output signals, while the Rx side is an APC decoder containing a syn-
thesis ﬁlter with an inverse quantizer (Q−1), which takes input signals and then
forwards them in the predictor with positive predisposition.
3.3.8.2
IMBE Coding
After extensive testing in trials during which seven candidates’ voice codecs (coder
and decoder) were evaluated, a codec manufactured by Digital Voice Systems
Incorporated (DVSI) was selected: the improved multiband excitation (IMBE)
model of voice coding algorithm. Namely, it was judged to provide reasonable
speech (voice) quality and speaker recognition; excellent intelligibility; acceptable
tolerance to burst and random errors up to 4 % error rate; good performance in the
presence of background acoustic and landline noise; relative immunity to the effect
of nonlinear microphones; and relatively straightforward implementation.
3.3
Digital Transmission
227

In use, the IMBE codec speech is sampled and digitized, and then, fast Fourier
transform is performed to determine a smoothed frequency spectrum (narrow
bandwidth). Thus, where the detected energy is above a predetermined threshold,
the harmonic is declared voiced and where the energy is declared unvoiced; then,
the amplitudes are measured in both cases. The smoothed spectral envelope, the
voice/unvoiced status of each harmonic, and the amplitudes of voice/unvoiced
harmonics are transmitted to the speech synthesizer, located at the receiver.
Accordingly, at the receiver, the pitch period and voiced harmonics are recon-
structed in the speech synthesizer, using sinusoidal oscillators whose amplitudes are
controlled by voiced amplitude information from the transmitter. Besides, the
unvoiced harmonics are simulated by band-limited noise from a noise source in the
receiver, the amplitude of the noise at each harmonic being controlled by the
unvoiced amplitude information transmitted over the communication channel. The
sampled smoothed spectrum information is multiplied with the synthesized har-
monic spectrum, and an inverse fast Fourier transform performed to construct a
digitized and synthesized voice signal.
At any rate, by employing speech analyses and coding at the transmitter,
together with decoding and speech syntheses in the receiver, a large reduction in
bandwidth and hence the transmitted bit rate can be achieved. The HF speech
components no longer have to be sent over the communication channel but can be
regenerated in the synthesizer, which is the only mathematical model that includes
frequency sources and modulators, thereby reducing occupied channel bandwidth.
More exactly, to reproduce the speaker’s voice, it is only necessary to send the
receiver a coded set of instructions, which instruct the speech synthesizer how to: 1.
simulate the distinguishing characteristics of the speaker’s voice, namely to set the
pitch frequency and selected harmonics, and 2. modulate these to reproduce the
speaker’s message.
Both types of information change only slowly during speech and can be trans-
mitted in a narrow bandwidth. Inmarsat-M uses digital voice coding at 6.4 Kb/s
speech codec rates, including error correction coding to protect the most critical
speech syntheses parameters. The coding rate has been optimized to preserve voice
(speech) quality in a typical mobile environment where high background acoustic
noise levels, multipath distortion (maritime), and blockage of the line-of-sight path
to the satellite (land) are often encountered.
3.3.8.3
Adaptive Differential PCM (ADPCM)
The PCM scheme is the simplest method of waveform coding, and the voice signal
s(t) quantized to one of many (2k) amplitude levels, however, where (k) is the
number of binary digits only to represent each sample.
When the sampling rate is chosen to be several times the Nyquist rate, the
adjacent samples become highly correlated and the signal does not change rapidly
from sample to sample. At this point, using this correlation between adjacent speech
samples, differential PCM (DPCM) quantizes the differences between the input
228

Transmission Techniques

sample and the predicted value, which is estimated by a linear predictor. Since such
differences are smaller than the sampled amplitude themselves, fewer bits are
required to represent the Tel signal.
The DPCM scheme with ﬁxed predictors can provide from 4 to 11 dB
improvement of gain over direct quantized PCM. The ADPCM method uses both
adaptive quantization and adaptive prediction to reduce coding errors.
In this sense, the typical conﬁguration of an ADPCM encoder is composed of
sample, quantizer, and predictor, providing feed-forward quantization where the
quantizer step size is proportional to the variance of the input of the quantizer. This
type of ADPCM provides about 10–11 dB improvement of S/N ratio over PCM.
Several adaptation algorithms have been proposed for this scheme. Since ADPCM
uses a scalar quantization, it is difﬁcult to reduce the bit rate to less than 8 Kb/s.
3.3.8.4
Linear Predictive Coding (LPC)
The LPC method synthesizes the speech using a linear predictive ﬁlter, which is
excited by appropriate signals such as an impulse sequence for voiced speech or
random noise for unvoiced speech. The LPC codec transmits only the parameters of
the linear predictive ﬁlter and the index of its selected excitation signals. The basic
conﬁguration of LPC codec is composed of excitation generator, long-term pre-
dictor, short-term predictor, and weighting ﬁlter. The input speech signals come
into the weighting ﬁlter and are assumed to be produced by an all-pole ﬁlter and
returned in the minimization procedure.
The short-term predictor removes the redundancy in the speech signal by the
predicted value, using the past (p) sample. However, some periodicity, which is
related to the pitch period of the original signal in the 50–400 Hz pitch frequency,
still remains. This residual signal is removed by the long-term predictor (pitch
predictor) and turns into a noise-link signal. The pitch predictor is not essential for
medium bit-rate LPC codecs, although it can improve their performance, but it is
very essential for low bit-rate codecs such as CELP, which use the excitation signal
modeled by a random Gaussian noise process.
3.3.8.5
Multipulse Excited LPC (MELPC)
The conﬁguration of the MELPC encoder is the same as CELP, the only difference
being the excitation generator. In the MELPC mode, the excitation generator
produces a sequence of pulses located at nonuniformly spaced intervals with dif-
ferent amplitudes. Both the amplitudes and positions of these pulses are determined
using a closed-loop analysis-by-synthesis method. Thus, the synthesized signal is
reconstructed using a sequence of pulses produced by the excitation generator and
the long-term and short-term predictor.
While MELPC assumes that both amplitudes and positions of excitation pulses
are initially unknown, the regular pulse-excited LPC assumes that the pulses are
3.3
Digital Transmission
229

regularly spaced, but the amplitudes are unknown. Using a suitable error criterion,
the error between the original and the synthesized signal is minimized. Two types
of codecs need similar bit rates for the same speech quality, because MELPC needs
less excitation pulses due to the optimization of the pulse position and needs both
the transmission of pulse positions and its amplitudes.
3.3.8.6
Code-Excited Linear Prediction (CELP)
The LPC and MELPC can produce good voice quality at bit rates as low as
9.6 Kb/s, but they cannot maintain their quality below this rate, because they have
to expend a large number of bits for encoding the excitation pulse. Besides, as
excitation signals, the CELP voice coder uses the collection of code vectors, which
are previously produced using vector quantization techniques based on Gaussian
processes and are stored as a large codebook.
Using each code vector and the predictors, synthesized speech is produced and
then the most suitable code vector that produces the lowest error between the
original and the reconstructed signal is selected. The index is assigned to the code
vector and the voice gain, and the values of the parameters for short- and long-term
predictors are transmitted.
3.4
Channel Coding and Decoding
Voice, video, data, and telex information are transmitted in digital form through a
channel that can cause degradation of these transmission signals. The noise,
interference, fading, and other obstacle factors experienced during transmission
could increase the probability of bit error at the receiver. Differently to say, the data
signal may be encoded in such a way as to reduce the likelihood of bit error.
Anyway, the coding process uses redundant bits, which contain no information to
assist in the detection and correction of errors. The subject of coding emerged
following the fundamental concepts of information theory laid down by Shannon in
1948, which is the relationship between communication channel and the rate at
which information can be transmitted over it. Basically, the theorems laying down
the fundamental limits on the amount of information ﬂow through a channel are
given.
3.4.1
Channel Processing
Channel processing is composed of special activities, which can improve the
transmission techniques throughout satellite channels in connection with gain,
errors, noise, interference, concentration, and authenticity.

Transmission Techniques

3.4.1.1
Digital Speech Concentration and Channel Multiplication
The system for digital speech concentration (interpolation) uses the activity factor
of telephone channels in order to reduce the number of satellite channels required to
transmit a given number of terrestrial channels. The digital speech interpolation
(DSI) technique is based on the fact that in a normal telephone conversation, each
participant monopolizes the circuit for only around half the time. As the silence
between syllables, words and phrases increases so does the unoccupied time.
Hence, on average, the activity time of a circuit is from 35 to 40 % of the con-
nection time.
By making use of the actual activity of the channels, several users can be
permitted to share the same telephone circuit. Certain numbers of terrestrial satellite
channels require only half the satellite channels and the gain is about 2. By adding a
low-rate encoder to the digital speech concentrator, the gain can be further
increased. For example, with encoding at 32 Kb/s, a gain increases by a factor of 2
can be obtained in voice channels used alternately for speech or data transmission.
The theoretical DSI gain is deﬁned by the ratio between the actual number of
speakers (input trunks) and the number of transmission channels (bearers) required
to service them.

(DCM) equipment is to concentrate a number of input digital lines (trunks) onto a

digital efﬁciency of the link or channels. This technique is qualiﬁed by the circuit
multiplication gain, which is deﬁned as the ratio of the input channels number over
the number of DCM output channels. It is used in digital circuit multiplication
equipment of the Intelsat/Eutelsat system.
3.4.1.2
Channel Encoding
The two fundamental problems related to reliable transmission of information via
channels were identiﬁed by C.E. Shannon as follows:
(1) The use of minimal numbers of bits to represent the information given by a
source in accordance with a ﬁdelity criterion. In reality, this issue is usually
identiﬁed as a problem of inefﬁcient MSC, to which the source coding pro-
vides most practical solutions.
(2) The recovery as exactly as possible of the information after its transmission
through a communication channel in the presence of noise and other inter-
ference. This is a problem of unreliable MSC, to which channel (error) coding
is the basic solution.
In such a way, Shannon proved that by proper encoding, these two objectives
can always be achieved, provided that the transmission rate (Rb) veriﬁes the fun-
damental expression H < Rb < C, where H = source entropy and C = channel
3.4
Channel Coding and Decoding
231

capacity. The BER of a digital system may be improved either by increasing Eb/N0
or by detecting and correcting some of the errors in the received data. Therefore, for
the additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channel, the Shannon Hartley law
states that capacity of a channel is given by the following relation:
C ¼ B logð1 þ C=NÞ ½b=s
ð3:30Þ
where B = channel bandwidth in Hz and S/N = signal-to-noise ratio at the receiver.
Thus, the channel capacity is the measure rate of the maximum information quantity
that two parties can communicate without error via a probabilistically modeled
channel. Namely, this chain of channels is composed of information data on input
rate (Rb), channel encoder with redundancy data (r) and encoded data symbols on
output rate (Rc). A reverse channel model contains input encoded data symbols,
channel decoder, and output information data symbols. According to Shannon, if
information is provided at rate R, which is less than the capacity of the channel,
then a means of coding can be applied such that the probability of error of the
received signal is arbitrarily small. If this rate is greater than the channel capacity,
then it will not be possible to improve the link quality by means of coding tech-
niques. Indeed, its application could have a detrimental effect on the link.
Rearranging the above equation in terms of energy-per-bit and information rate,
where the information rate is equal to the channel capacity, results in the following:
C=B ¼ log ð1 þ Eb C=N0B)
ð3:31Þ
where Eb = information bit rate; Eb = related to the carrier power and the infor-
mation bit rate; and C/N0 = carrier-to-noise density ratio. Moreover, the above
expression can be utilized to derive the Shannon limit, the minimum value of Eb/N0
below which there can be no error-free transmission of information. As C/B tends to
zero, this can be shown to be equal to –1.59 dB (1/log2e). The code rate and input
rate can be deﬁned as follows:
c ¼ n=n þ r
and
Rc ¼ Rb=n
½b=s]
ð3:32Þ
The capacity of the channel is independent of the coding/modulation scheme
used. Hence, Shannon’s channel coding theorem exactly stated that, for a given
carrier-to-noise ratio, the error probability could be made as small as desirable,
provided that the information rate (Rb) is less than the capacity (C) and a suitable
coding is used. In MSC systems, channel coding is especially interesting because of
the severe power, bandwidth, and propagation limitations. Moreover, the consid-
erable progresses in multiple access modulation schemes, resource assignment
algorithms, signal-processing techniques, and advanced error-control coding pro-
vide the most efﬁcient means to realize highly reliable information transmission.

3.4.1.3
Digital Compression
Digital transmission in general uses compression techniques for data and video
signals. The effective data transfer via the Inmarsat MSC system can be signiﬁ-
cantly increased by using data compression software. Essential results were pro-
vided on PC by the PKZIP/PKUNZIP program developed by US-based PKWARE,
which in a fraction of a second gives a 2–3 times reduction in size of ASCII ﬁles
and 1.5 times for many types of binary ﬁles. The ARJ compression software from
Robert K. Jung is slower but more effective than PKZIP. It can also be recom-
mended for the compression of data ﬁles containing graphic information.
Thus, the real-time data compression incorporated into the most advanced
modems can also increase the effective data rate of ASCII ﬁles transmission, but for
transmission of already compressed ﬁles with information, it is better not to use the
compression in the modem.
Their use in compressed video systems, where a TV receive only (TVRO) can
also receive many channels of video from one transponder (about 6–8), has become
very widespread, ﬁrst in the USA and then in Europe. The compression system that
has now become standard refers to a Moving Picture Experts Group (MPEG),
formed under the auspices of the ISO and the International Electrotechnical
Commission (IEC). In such a system, a number of digitized videos are combined
into a single bit stream in a source coder. That bit stream is then sent to a channel
coder for FEC and then to a QPSK modulator, an upconverter, ampliﬁer, and an
antenna for uplinking to the satellite transponder. Since only one signal is present in
the transponder at any on time, there is no need for back off and full transponder
power is used.
At the reverse side, the compressed video downlink comprises a line in the chain
of an antenna, tuner, downconverter and QPSK demodulator, FEC detector,
demultiplexer, and MPEG decoder. The MPEG is determined to provide standard
compression that allows video and accompanying audio signals to be compressed in
channel width. The packetizer function is to enter a suitable code in the bit stream
for the individual digitized TV program so that it can be separated in the receiving
chain, allowing the enabled user to select the desired program. The BER is
determined from the (Eb/N0) obtained for a combination of whatever transponder
EIRP, FEC coding, transmission symbol rate, and receiver system are used. If a plot
of that FEC system is not available, then the Viterbi mode FEC coding performance
could be used for a good estimate of results. This type of compression has effects
such as: MPEG-2 compression results in the removal of most audio and video
redundancy; the FES utilization scheme results in a rapid BER increase; and the
resultant (Eb/N0) should be high enough to achieve a BER of 10−6 for a TVRO.
3.4.1.4
Voice Encryption
Encryption is used when it is wished to prevent exploitation or tampering with
transmitted messages or voice conversation by unauthorized users, in the form of
3.4
Channel Coding and Decoding
233

algorithmic operation in real time, bit-by-bit, on the binary stream. Thus, the set of
parameters, which deﬁnes the transformation, is called a key. Its use is often
associated with military communications, but commercial satellite systems are
increasingly induced by customers to propose encrypted links, particularly for
administrative and government sectors.
In fact, due to the extended coverage of satellite networks and the easy access to
them by small MES, eavesdropping and message falsiﬁcation are potentially within
the reach of a large number of agents of modest means. The encryption transmis-
sion chain is composed of an encryption unit with plain text input, satellite channel
with intruder and key distribution for retransmission of cipher (encrypted) text, and
de-encryption with a unit for production of plain output text. The encryption and
de-encryption units operate with a key provided by the key generation unit.
Acquisition of a common key implies a secure method of key distribution. This key
is entered into the encryption unit through a key injector about the size of a
matchbox. Without this key, a potential eavesdropper attempting to listen in on the
conversation would hear nothing but a noise made up of digital signals.
The technique used for most voice encryption consists of speech compressing
and digitizing, using a very complicated coding process. In such a way, the voice
signal is sliced into small bits, which are processed by an algorithm into bits of
voice with a very complex structure. At the other end of the process, using the same
key pattern, the voice is reproduced as it was before the encryption.
A typical example of voice encryption for MSC is Satsec A1 for secure voice
transmission, of Inmarsat standard-A MES. This unit is housed in a modern smart
telephone, which uses a very sophisticated Swiss encryption technique. The Satsec
A1 features include full digital voice and facsimile encryption and LPC voice
compression, using full-duplex operations CCITT V.22bis and V.27 Modem with a
rate of 2400 b/s, giving business users a security level comparable to that used by
government agencies. In case of transmission only in half-duplex mode, the unit
automatically falls back to the built-in VOX-controlled quasi-duplex operational
mode. Hence, this device should not be confused with a voice scrambler, even a
digital one, which is no longer a competitive alternative to high-level encryption.
The unit digitizer uses linear predictive coding and has, unlike self-synchronizing
stream ciphers, no bit error multiplication. In a more general sense, under the same
circumstances, this device may even have an enhanced effect on the channel that is
quality of transmission.
The aspects of encryption are conﬁdential to avoid exploitation of the
voice/message by unauthorized persons and to provide authentic protection against
any modiﬁcation of the message by an intruder. This system uses the following
technique:
1. Online encryption (stream cipher)—Each bit of the original binary message
stream (plain text) is combined using a simple operation, for example, modulo-2
addition, with each bit of a binary stream (keystream) generated by a key device.
Otherwise, the latter could be a pseudorandom sequence generator whose
structure is deﬁned by the key.
234
3
Transmission Techniques

2. Encryption by Block (block cipher)—The transmission of the original binary
stream message into an encrypted stream is performed simply block-by-block,
according to the logic deﬁned by the key.
Besides, encryption is commonly used in direct TV broadcasting to avoid illegal
reception and military applications to minimize the probability of message inter-
ception. The principle of encryption and decryption unit for text is that both operate
with a key generation unit. At this point, key generation unit is giving necessary key
outputs to encryption and decryption units. In the same time, plain text is entering
in encryption unit, coming out as a cipher text, then via intruder entering in
decryption, and is transforming again in the same plain text.
3.4.2
Coding
As is known, satellite communication systems are generally limited by the available
power and bandwidth. Thus, it is of interest if the signal power can be reduced
while maintaining the same grade of service (BER). As mentioned, this can be
achieved by adding extra or redundant bits to the information content by using a
channel coder. Otherwise, excepting several main classes of channel coder, the
three most widely used in MSC are block, cyclic, and convolutional encoders.
3.4.2.1
Block Codes
Binary linear block codes are expressed in the (n, k) form, where (k) is the infor-
mation bits number that is converted into (n) code word bits. There are (n, k) party
bits in each encoded block, where the difference between (n) and (k) bits are added
by the coder as a number of redundancy bits (r). In the other words, a coded block
comprising (n) bits consists of (k) information and (r) redundant bits expressed as
follows:
n ¼ k þ r
ð3:33Þ
Such a code is designated as a (n, k) code, where the code rate or code efﬁciency
is given by the ratio of (k/n). Mapping between message sequences and code words
can be achieved using look-up tables although as the size of the code block
increases, such an approach becomes impractical. However, this is not such a
problem as linear code words can be generated using some form of linear trans-
formation of the message sequence. In this sense, a code sequence (c) comprising of
the row vector elements (c1, c2, …, cn) is generated from a message sequence (m),
comprising the row vector elements (m1, m2, …, mk) by the following linear
operation:
3.4
Channel Coding and Decoding
235

c ¼ m G
ð3:34Þ
where G = generator matrix. Thus, in general, all (c) code bits are generated from
linear combinations of the (k) message bits.
A special category known as a systematic code occurs when the ﬁrst (k) digits of
the code are the same as the ﬁrst (k) message bits, namely if input message bits
appear as part of the output code bits. The remaining n-k code bits are then
generated from the (k) message bits using a form of linear combination, and they
are termed the party data bits.
The generator matrix for a linear block code is one of the main bases for the
vector space of valid codewords. The generator matrix deﬁnes the length of each
codeword (n), the number of information bits (k) in each codeword, and the type of
redundancy that is added; however, the code is completely deﬁned by its generator
matrix. The generator matrix is a (k ∙n) matrix that is the row space of Vk value. In
such a way, one possible generator matrix for a typical (7, 4) linear block code has
to be simply presented in the following four rows: 01000/0110100/1110010/
1010001.
However, the distance between two coded words (e.g., ﬁrst 2 and second 2
digits) in a block is deﬁned as the number of bits in which the words differ and is
called the Hamming distance (dh). The Hamming distance has the capability to
detect all coded words having errors (ed), where ed < (dh –1); to detect and correct
(edc) bits, where edc = (dh –1)/2; and to correct t and detect (e) errors, where the
Hamming distance as a minimum space between two coded blocks is given by:
dh ¼ t þ e þ 1
ð3:35Þ
In the detection process, two coded words separated by (dh) are most likely to be
mistaken for each other. The extended Golay code offers superior performance to
Hamming codes but at a cost of increased receiver complexity. In practice, code
words are conveniently generated using a series of simple shift registers and
modulo-2 adders.
In Fig. 3.19 (left) is shown the concept of block codes and their rate, which
operate on groups of bits organized as blocks, namely information bits assembled as
blocks before coding, while in Fig. 3.19 (right) is shown cyclic coder.

Transmission Techniques

3.4.2.2
Cyclic Codes
These code methods are a subclass of linear codes, where a code word is generated
simply by performing a cyclic shift of its predecessor. In other words, each bit in a
code sequence generation is shifted by one place to the right and the end bit is fed
back to the start of the sequence, hence the term cyclic. Both the linear Hamming
and extended Golay codes have equivalent cyclic code generators. Thus,
non-systematic cyclic codes are generated using a unique generator polynomial g(p)
and message polynomials in the forms as follows:
gðpÞ ¼ pnk þ gnkpk1 þ . . . g1p þ 1 and
ð3:36Þ
mðpÞ ¼ mk1pk1 þ mk2pk2 þ . . . þ m1p þ m0
ð3:37Þ
where the generator polynomial is a factor of pn+1 and the value (mk-1 … m0). When
this is multiplied by the generator polynomial, it results in the generation of a code
word by:
cðpÞ ¼ ðmk1pk1 þ mk2pk2 þ . . . þ m1p þ m0Þ gðpÞ
ð3:38Þ
Thus, an alternative to this approach is to generate systematic cyclic codes,
which can be generated in three steps, involving the use of feedback shift register:
(a) The message polynomial is multiplied by pn−k, which is equivalent to shifting
the message sequence by (n – k) bits. This is necessary to make space for the
insertion of the party bits; (b) the product of step 1, pn−km(p), is divided by the
generator polynomial, g(p); and (c) The remainder from step 2 is the party bit
sequence, which is then added to the message sequence prior to transmissions. The
cyclic code scheme has two methods used in MSC systems such as: Bose–
Chadhuri–Hocquenghem (BCH) and Reed–Solomon (RS).
1. BCH Codes—The BCH codes are the most powerful of all cyclic codes with a
large range of block length, code rates, alphabets, and error correction capa-
bility. They are superior to all other codes because of similar block length and
code rate. Most commonly used BCH codes have a code word block length as
n = 2m – 1, where (m = 3, 4 …). Inmarsat standard-A uses 57 bits plus 6 party
bits encoded with BCH (63, 57) code in TDM channels and for the return
request channel burst employs Aloha BPSK (BCH) 4800 b/s.
2. RS Codes—The RS codes are a subset of the BCH codes specially suited for
correcting the effect of the burst errors. The latter consideration is particularly
important in the context of the MSC channels, and hence, RS codes are usually
incorporated into the system design. This set of codes has the largest possible
code minimum distance of any linear code with the same encoder input and
output block length. Thus, the RS codes are speciﬁed using the convention RS
(n, k), where n = number of code symbols word length per block; k = data
3.4
Channel Coding and Decoding
237

symbols encoded; and the difference between (n) and (k) is the number of parity
symbols added to the data. The code minimum distance is given by:
dmin ¼ nk þ 1
ð3:39Þ
The code is capable of correcting errors such as: e = 1/2 (dmin – 1) and
e = (n – k)/2, or to use an alphabet of 2m symbols with: n = 2m – 1 and k = 2m –1–2e,
where m = 2,3 … and so on. The advantage of RS codes is the reduction in the number
of words (n) symbols, which are code words, producing a possibly large value of
minimum distance (dmin).
3.4.2.3
Convolutional Codes
The second family of commonly used codes is known as convolution codes. Unlike
block codes, which operate on each block independently, these codes retain several
previous bits in memory, which are all used in the coding process. They are
generated by a typed-shift register and two or more modulo-2 adders connected to
particular stage of the register. The number of bits stored in the shift register is
termed the constraint length (K). Bits within the register are shifted by (k) input
bits. Each new input generates (n) output bits, which are obtained by sampling the
outputs of the modulo-2 adders. The ratio of (k) to (n) is known as the code rate.
These codes are usually classiﬁed according to the following convention: (n, k, K),
for example (2, 1, 7), refers to a half-rate encoder of constraint length 7. It is important
to know what sequence of output code bits will be generated for a particular input
stream. There are several techniques available to assist with this question, the most
popular being connection pictorial, state diagram, tree diagram, and trellis diagram.
However, to illustrate how these methods are applied, the simple example of
half-rate (1/2) encoder will be considered with constraint length k = 3. The system
has two modulo-2 adders, so that the code rate is 1/2. The input bit (m) placed into
the ﬁrst of the shift register causes the bits in the register to be moved one place to
the right. The output switch samples the output of each modulo-2 adder, one after
the other, to form a bit pair for the bit just entered. The connections from the
register to the adders could be one, two, or three interfaces for either adder. The
choice depends on the requirement to produce a code with good distance properties.
A similar encoder used by the Inmarsat standard-A is a half-rate convolutional
encoder. Therefore, in terms of connections to the modulo-2, adders can be deﬁned
using generator polynomials in the encoder conﬁguration.
Thus, convolutional codes are forming in convolutional coder by convolving
information bits R with the impulse response of a shift register encoder, whose
block diagram is shown in Fig. 3.20 (Left). These types of codes use previous
information bits in memory (v) and continuously produce coded bits. The constraint
length of convolutional code deﬁnes the number of information bits, which inﬂu-
ence the encoder output. In such a way, the constraint length is decided by the
238
3
Transmission Techniques

number of shift registers or code memory. The error correcting property of the
convolutional code depends on the constraint length and its value improves as code
memory is increased, and in such a way, decoding complexity increases.
The polynomial for the generating arm (n) of the encoder gn(p) and the generator
polynomials representing encoder g1(p) can have the following relations:
gnðpÞ ¼ g0ðpÞ þ g1p1 þ . . . gnpn
and
ð3:40Þ
g1ðpÞ ¼ 1 þ p þ p2 ¼ 1 þ p2
ð3:41Þ
where the value of g1 takes on the value of 0 or 1 and 1 is used to indicate that there
is a connection between a particular element of the shift register and the modulo-2
adder. Thus, to provide a simple representation of the encoder, generator polyno-
mials are used to predict the output coded message sequences for a given input
sequences. For instance, the input sequence 10110 can be represented by the
polynomial relation:
mðpÞ ¼ 1 þ p2 þ p3
ð3:42Þ
Combining this with the respective generator polynomials and using the rules of
module-2 arithmetic results in the following:
mðpÞg1ðpÞ ¼ ð1 þ p2 þ p3Þ ð1 þ p þ p2Þ ¼ 1 þ p þ p5 and
ð3:43Þ
mðpÞg2ðpÞ ¼ ð1 þ p2 þ p3Þ ð1 þ p2Þ ¼ 1 þ p3 þ p4 þ p5
ð3:44Þ
The output code sequence c(p) obtains by interleaving the above two products
with the following relations:
cðpÞ ¼ ½1; 1p0 þ ½1; 0p1 þ ½0; 0p2 þ ½0; 1p3 þ ½0; 1p4 þ ½1; 1p5
ð3:45Þ
Here, the number between brackets represents the output code sequence.
The Inmarsat analog standard-A uses a HSD channel encoding conﬁguration for
the information data stream at 56 Kb/s. The scrambling sequence on the input data
stream shall be provided by the scrambler before the convolutional encoder

described in CCITT Recommendation V.35 scheme. The data stream then passes
differential encoder state stage 1 followed by 1/2 (half) convolutional encoding with
constant length k = 7. The half (1/2) rate convolutional encoder can provide two
data streams to the QPSK modulator using two generator polynomials rates as
follows: G1 = 1 + x2 + x3 + x5 + x6 and G2 = 1 + x + x2 + x3 + x6. The encoder
provides two parallel data streams to the modulator: I and Q, while (Q) should lag
(I) by 90o in the modulator.
The Inmarsat digital B and aero standards for transmission and out-of-band
signaling channels use digital modulation and FEC in order to efﬁciently utilize
satellite power and bandwidth. The basic modulation and coding techniques are
ﬁltered by 60 % roll-off O-QPSK and 40 % roll-off BPSK, both with convolutional
coding at either rate: 1/2 or 3/4 FEC and 8-level soft decision Viterbi decoding
(constraint length = 7).
Hence, punctured coding is used to derive 3/4 and 1/2 rates. All BPSK channels
are differentially encoded outside the FEC. The Inmarsat maritime and aero
standard-M for all transmissions, with the exception of those ﬁelds carrying digi-
tally coded voice, employs FEC with convolutional encoding of constraint length
k = 7 and 8-level soft decision Viterbi decoding.
There are two generator polynomials rates: G1 (133 octal) and G2 (171 octal).
The transmitted bit is nominated by 1 and deleted by 0. However, the ﬁrst bit in
each transmission frame is the output from the G1 polynomial, and all bits are
transmitted at the rate of 1/2 code. Finally, the output data from the bit selector are
punctured coded data of 3/4 rate.
3.4.2.4
Concatenated Codes
These codes were originally developed for deep space communications and occur
when two separate coding techniques are combined to form a large code. The inner
decoder is used to correct most of the errors introduced by the channel, the output of
which is then fed into the outer decoder, which further reduces the BER to the target
level. That is to say, a typical concatenated coding scheme would employ half-rate
convolutional encoding of constraint length 7 (2, 1, 7)—Viterbi decoding as the
inner scheme and RS (255, 223) block encoding and decoding as the outer scheme.
Interleaving between the inner and outer coders can be used to further improve the
performance.
3.4.2.5
Turbo Codes
Turbo codes are a new class of error correction codes that were introduced in 1993
by a group of researchers from France, along with a practical decoding algorithm.
In Fig. 3.20 (right) is shown a basic rate 1/3 turbo coder. At this point, it feeds data
stream dk directly into a recursive systematic convolution (RCS) coder c1 and after
interleaving into another RCS coder C2, which is not necessarily identical to C1. In
240
3
Transmission Techniques

addition, the transmitting bit stream compresses symbol Xk and redundancies Y1k
and Y2k and is therefore a rate 1/3 code or it may be punctured to give higher code
rate. The major importance of these codes is that they enable reliable transmission
with power efﬁciencies close to the theoretical limit predicted by Claude Shannon.
Since their introduction, turbo codes have been proposed for low-power appli-
cations such as deep space and satellite communications, as well as for interference
limited applications such as third-generation cellular/personal communication ser-
vices. Due to the use of a pseudorandom interleaver, turbo codes appear randomly
to the channel, yet possess enough structure so that decoding can be physically
realized. Developed for deep space and satellite communication applications, turbo
codes offer a performance signiﬁcantly better than concatenated codes. For
instance, they are generated using two or more recursive systematic convolutional
code generators concatenated in parallel. Here, the term recursive implies that some
of the output bits of the convolutional encoder are fed back and applied to the input
bit sequence, and in sense, the ﬁrst encoder takes the information bits as input. The
key to the turbo code generation is the presence of a permuter, which performs a
function similar to an interleaver, with the only difference that here the output
sequence is pseudorandom.
The permuter takes a block of information bits, which should be large to increase
performance, for example, more than 1000 bits and produces a random, delayed
sequence of output bits, which is then fed into the second encoder. In such a
manner, the outputs of the two encoders are partly bits transmitted along with the
original information bits. In order to reduce the number of transmitted bits, the party
bits are punctured prior to transmission.
From various simulation results, it is recognized that turbo codes are capable of
achieving an arbitrarily low BER of 10-5 at an Eb/No ratio of just 0.7 dB. For
instance, in order to achieve this level of performance, large block sizes of 65,532
data bits are required. Because of this prohibitively enlarged block size, an original
turbo code is not well suited for real-time Tel communication systems such as IS-95
CDMA cellular standard. For that reason, the work on this problem has focused on
the design of short block length codes, compatible with IS-95 standard.
3.4.3
Decoding
The complete transmission loop requires any type of encoder followed by modu-
lation and transmitter via transmission channel to receiver, namely to demodulator
and decoder. In such a manner, decoding is the reverse method of coding and every
type of decoding on the transmit side needs the same convenient decoding method
on the receive side.
3.4
Channel Coding and Decoding
241

3.4.3.1
Block Decoding
The simplest means of decoding block codes is by a method of correlation whereby
the decoder makes a comparison between the received code word and all permis-
sible code words, and however, it is selecting that word that gives the nearest
match. This decoding will also depend on whether error detection or error cor-
rection is required, so decoders generally cannot use soft decision outputs from the
demodulator, unlike the decoders for convolutional codes.
3.4.3.2
Convolutional Decoding
The effect of the transmission channel on the signal and the probability of detection
of a 1 or 0 in the presence of Gaussian noise are important factors during detection.
In such a manner, an output from the demodulator can be conﬁgured to give a
correct decision regarding whether the incoming signal is 1 or 0. The process of
decoding then depends on the two state inputs it receives.
An alternative demodulator conﬁguration allows quantization of the predicted
level which gives the decoder more necessary information regarding the probable
state of the demodulator output. For example, if 3 bit (23 = 8 levels) quantization
occurs then 0 0 0 would suggest a ﬁrm valuation of the level received as a 0. On the
other hand, an 0 0 1 scheme suggests the 0 is received close to the threshold and this
valuation as a 0 is made with less certainly. The reason for quantization is to
provide the convolutional decoder with more information in order to correctly
recover the transmitted information with better error performance probability.
3.4.3.3
Turbo Decoding
The turbo decoder operates by performing an interactive decoding algorithm,
resulting in the partial transfer of an a priori likelihood estimate of the decoded bit
sequence between the constituent decoders. Initially, the received information bits,
which may be in some error due to the inﬂuence of the channel, are used to perform
a priori likelihood estimates by the respective decoders.
In a more precise sense, the decoders employ so-called maximum a posteriori
(MAP) algorithm to perform converge on the likely sequence of data transfer, after
which the interaction between decoders ceases and the output sequence is obtained
from one of the decoders.
An interleaver can be placed between the output of Decoder 1 and the input of
Decoder 2, to provide an additional weighted decision input into Decoder 2; sim-
ilarly, a de-interleaver is placed at the output of Decoder 2, to provide feedback to
Decoder 1. The decoding time is proportional to the number of interactions between
decoders.

3.4.3.4
Sequential Decoding
A sequential decoder may be used for convolutional decoding, and it operates in a
similar manner to the Viterbi decoder. On receipt of the incoming code word
sequence, this decoder will penetrate into the tree according to a decision made
regarding the best path to follow. For that reason, using a trial and error technique,
the decoder will progress as long as the chosen path appears correct; otherwise, it
will backtrack to try a different route. At this point, either soft decision or hard
decision decoding is possible with the sequential decoder, although soft decision
would considerably increase the computational time and storage space required.
A major advantage of sequential decoding is that the number of states examined
is independent of constraint length, allowing the use of large constraint lengths and
low error probability. A disadvantage is the need to store input sequences, while the
decoder searches for its preferred route through the tree. If the average decodes rate
falls below that of the average symbol arrival rate, there is a danger that the decoder
cannot cope, causing a loss of input information.
3.4.3.5
Viterbi Decoding
Viterbi decoding was developed by Andrew J. Viterbi and published in April 1967.
A Viterbi decoder uses the Viterbi algorithm for decoding a bitstream that has been
encoded using convolutional or trellis code. The Viterbi algorithm is the most
resource-consuming, but it does the maximum likelihood decoding, mostly used for
decoding convolutional codes with constraint lengths k ≤10, but values up to
k = 15 are used in practice.
Viterbi maximum likelihood decoding of convolutional codes provides the best
possible results in the presence of random errors. Thus, in an attempt to match the
output sequence received by the decoder, Viterbi’s algorithm models the possible
state transition through a trellis identical to that used by the encoder.
Accordingly, the Viterbi decoding algorithm is a maximum likelihood path
algorithm that takes advantage of the remaining path structure of convolutional
codes. This method works by modeling the possible state transitions of the encoder
and ﬁnding the output sequence that matches most closely to that received by the
decoder. Its task is to realize that not all paths through the encoder states can
contribute to the ﬁnal decoded output and that many paths can be rejected after each
frame is received, which keeps the problem to manageable proportions.
If the encoder remembers (v) bits, then there are 2v possible memory states to be
modeled by the decoder. Hence, this term dominates expressions for speed, com-
plexity, and cost of the decoder and currently imposes an upper limit of 8–10 on
constraint length. By path, maximum likelihood decoding means that of all the
possible paths through the trellis, a Viterbi decoder chooses the convenient path,
most likely in the probabilistic sense to have been transmitted. Viterbi decoders
easily make use of either hard or soft decision making. This decoding can incor-
porate soft decisions very simply, which will almost double the error correction
3.4
Channel Coding and Decoding
243

power of the code and this can provide an additional gain of up to 3 dB. Otherwise,
the procedure for choosing the best Viterbi scheme is to maximize constraint length
within the limits of cost and speed, to ﬁnd a nonsymmetrical code with the best
value of d∞and to use soft decisions. The maritime Inmarsat standard-B and
multipurpose M utilize an 8-level soft decision Viterbi decoding in their channels
(constraint length = 7).
3.4.4
Error Correction
There are several methods (such as ADPCM) that reduce the number of redundant
bits in speech, audio, and visual signals in order to make more economic use of
bandwidth. First of all, it is necessary to consider methods that require the deliberate
addition of redundant bits to messages. The added bits are very carefully chosen,
and error correction systems make it possible to achieve large savings in the power
required to realize low BER. At the receiver, the additional bits are used to detect
any errors introduced by channels. To achieve this technique in MSC, FEC, ARQ,
and pseudo-noise and interleaving are employed. In such a way, it is also possible
to combine FEC and ARQ in an integration form known as a hybrid error correction
(HEC) transmitting scheme. At this point, however, the HEC method is used to
reduce BER and the number of retranslated blocks. Such an arrangement could also
be used to provide feedback information to the transmitter regarding slow varia-
tions, such as a fading.
3.4.4.1
Forward Error Correction (FEC)
The FEC is a technique where errors are detected and corrected at the receiver.
Thus, this scheme requires only a one-way transmission link, since the message
contains parity bits used for detection and correction of errors. In such a way, it is
working only on receiving Tlx mode in radio and satellite one-way transmissions.
The basic FEC technique used in MSC can be classiﬁed into two major (already
explained) categories such as convolutional and block codes. The FEC coding as a
result of convolutional coding is used in Inmarsat standards for some voice, telex,
and signaling channels. For example, Inmarsat standard-B uses convolutional
encoder of constraint length 7- and 8-level soft decision Viterbi decoder. The
coding rate is either 3/4 or 1/2, while for voice channel, the code rate 3/4 is used and
is derived by puncturing the rate 1/2 with k = 7 convolutional code.
On the other hand, the association of both basic coding techniques results in an
even more powerful FES scheme known as the concatenated coding system. This
powerful FEC scheme has been introduced in recent years, for a considerable
244
3
Transmission Techniques

increase of the service quality without appreciable expansion of bandwidth. While
the inner code, with Viterbi decoding, can correct a large part of the random errors
and very short error bursts, the residual errors at the outputs of the Viterbi decoder
tend to be grouped in bursts. Thus, using a properly chosen interleaving that cuts
the error bursts into shorter ones, a high-rate Reed–Solomon code can be used as
the outer code in order to correct most of these dispersed errors bursts to achieve a
very low BER. Thus, the introduction of concatenated coding and trellis coded
modulation into MSC is the most remarkable event in the domain. Table 3.3 shows
a list of FEC techniques along with their performance.
An FEC scheme can improve the quality of a digital transmission link by the
following two aspects: (a) an BER reduction, closely related to the service quality
criterion, and (b) a saving in the Eb/N0 or C/N0 to be considered in the link budget.
The Eb/N0 or C/N0 saving is often called the coding gain, expressed in dB as a
difference at certain BER values, of the coded system and the reference noncoded
one. Thus, in the comparison between different transmission schemes, Eb/N0 is
usually used because it is independent of the coding scheme, where the gain is
given as follows:
G ¼ ðEb=N0Þ refðEb=N0Þ cod
½dB
ð3:46Þ
The merit of a coding system can also be appreciated in terms of the savings in
C/N0 and C/N, considering information rate (Rb) and information transmission

A coding gain in Eb/N0 means in general a gain in C/N, but the coding in C/N
depends on the bandwidth expansion with respect to the reference system. It is
however possible to have a coding gain without bandwidth expansions using trellis
coded modulation (TCM).
3.4.4.2
Automatic Request Repeat (ARQ)
The Automatic Repeat ReQuest (ARQ), also known as Automatic Repeat Query, is
an error-control method for data transmission that uses acknowledgments (mes-
sages sent by the receiver indicating that it has correctly received a data frame or
packet) and time-outs (speciﬁed periods of time allowed to elapse before an
acknowledgment is to be received) to achieve reliable data transmission over an
unreliable service. If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment before the
time-out, the message will be retransmitted until is received.
The ARQ is a transmission technique with which a high degree of data integrity
is required and latency is not a signiﬁcant factor. In reality, the ARQ scheme, based
on error detection coding and a retransmission protocol, is well adapted to the
situation where a two-way channel is available. Typical examples of such systems
can be encountered in a computer data network using satellite links. It is worthy of
notice that the ARQ and improved ARQ, as well as HEC techniques, are widely
used in modern digital communications and storage systems. The ARQ method
requires a two-way link, since a receiver, detecting an error, does not attempt to
correct it but simply requests the transmitter to retransmit the message. Thus, the
ARQ scheme basically works with the following modus:
1. Stop and Wait ARQ—After each message block is sent via satellite link, the
transmitter waits for acknowledgment. If the message block received is in error,
the transmitter will retransmit that block, but if this message is correctly
received, the next message block is transmitted. A half-duplex link is required,
transmission on the link is possible in both directions but not at the same time.
2. Continuous ARQ with Repeat—The transmitter sends and the receiver
acknowledges message blocks continuously. Hence, any message block not
correctly received causes the transmitter to return to the block in question
(incorrect received block) and recommence continuous retransmission from
there. A full-duplex link is necessary for transmission in both directions
simultaneously.
3. Continuous ARQ with Selective Repeat—In this ARQ arrangement, only the
block received in error is retransmitted and the transmitter continues from where
246
3
Transmission Techniques

it left off at the last block, instead of repeating all the subsequent even correctly
received messages. In such a manner, however, full-duplex link is also neces-
sary for transmission in both directions simultaneously.
A major advantage of ARQ compared with FEC is that decoding equipment for
error corrections can be simpler and the redundancy in the total message stream is
less. The ARQ efﬁciency is good for low error ratios, but for high ratios requiring
retransmission of a large number of message blocks, the system becomes inefﬁcient.
A disadvantage of ARQ is the variability of the delays experienced from end to end
of the link and so the possible requirement for large data stores of incoming data
blocks.
The Inmarsat standard-C for maritime and aeronautical applications uses packets
of data, and each one transmitted contains a 16-bit checksum ﬁeld. After that, the
receiver completes an expected checksum for each packet and compares this with
the actual packet received in order to verify that the packet has been correctly
received. The ARQ method is used if the packet received is in error.
3.4.4.3
Pseudo-Noise (PN)
The PN generator will produce a set of cyclic codes with good distance properties.
Thus, the name of the sequence is given, because the sequence, although deter-
ministic, appears to have the properties of sampled white noise. Furthermore, a PN
sequence is easily generated using shift registers and has a correlation function that
is high packet for zero delay and approximates to zero for other delays. The PN
sequence, being deterministic, is usually for synchronization purposes between a
transmitter and receiver.
Some Inmarsat standards use a scrambler circuit before FEC encoding and a
descrambler at the receive end following FEC decoding. For Inmarsat standard-B
and M, for instance, the scrambler/descrambler circuits are PN generators using 15
stages.
The scrambler/descrambler circuits are clocked at the rate of one shift per
information bit. The ﬁrst bit into the scrambler at the beginning of a frame is
modulo-2, added with the output of the scrambler shift generator, corresponding to
the initial state-scrambling vector. The initial state of the shift register is located at
the beginning of a burst and a frame.
Considering the Inmarsat standard-M, the initial state of the scrambler shift
registers sent by MES is received at the LES (for SCPC channel operating in voice
mode) at the start of a call as part of a call set-up sequence. The MES chooses any
initial state (except all zeros) on a random basis for each call and signals this
scrambling vector message (8D in hexadecimal form or 10001101) for imple-
mentation at the LES with the least signiﬁcant bit (LSB) in shift register No 1 and
the most signiﬁcant bit (MSB) in shift register No 15 of the scrambler. The MES
simultaneously sets the descrambler shift register with the same scrambling vector.
Otherwise, for MES-to-LES channels, a ﬁxed initial state default value of 6959 in
3.4
Channel Coding and Decoding
247

hexadecimal form or 110100101011001 is used in MES scramblers and LES
descramblers.
3.4.4.4
Interleaving
As is well known, the MSC transmission channel introduces errors of a bursting
nature. Hence, in the short term, the errors introduced by the channel cannot be
considered to be statistically independent or memory less, the criterion upon which
most coders (block and convolutional) optimally operate. In order to mimic a
statistically independent channel, a technique known as interleaving is incorporated
into the transmitter chain after the output of the encoder and from the interleaver the
input signal passes via the modulator. In reverse mode, the output signal goes
through the demodulator, deinterleaver, and channel decoder. This circle presents
the interleaver/deinterleaver segment within the transmission/reception chain in the
satellite link. Hence, the role of the interleaver is to reorder the transmission
sequence of the bits that make up the code words in some predetermined fashion,
such that the effect of an error burst is minimized.
Interleaving can be performed for both block and convolutional codes. Block
interleaving is achieved by ﬁrstly storing the output code words of the encoder into
a two-dimensional array. Consider the case of an (m, n) array, where (m) is the
number of code words to be interleaved and (n) is the number of code word bits.
Thus, each row of the array comprises a generated code word. Once the array is
full, the contents are then output to the transmitter, but in this case, data is read out
on a column-by-column basis. Generally speaking, the transmission of each symbol
of a particular code word will be non-sequential. Namely, the input signal goes via
the input sequence into the interleaver block and, after processing the output
sequence, would correspond to the chain starting with C11, C21, C31, C41, C51, C61,
C71, C12–C72, … until C18–C78. At this point, the effect of any error bursts will have
been dispersed in time throughout the transmitted code words. Convolutional
interleavers work along similar lines, achieving performance characteristics similar
to block interleaving.
At the receiver, the inverse of the interleaving function is performed by a
deinterleaver and the original code words are reconstituted prior to feeding into the
encoder. Namely, a burst of error affecting the transmitted bits indicated by the
chain coming from interleaver block would be dispersed among the code words at
the receiver.
3.5
Multiple Access Technique
In satellite communication systems, as a rule, many users are active at the same
time. The problem of simultaneous communications between many single or
multipoint satellite users, however, can be solved by using multiple access
248
3
Transmission Techniques

(MA) technique. Since the resources of the systems such as the transmitting power
and the bandwidth are limited, it is advisable to use the channels with complete
charge and to create a different MA to the channel.
This generates a problem of summation and separation of signals in the trans-
mission and reception parts, respectively. Deciding this problem consists of the
development of orthogonal channels of transmission in order to divide signals from
various users unambiguously on the reception part. There are ﬁve the following
principal forms of MA techniques:
(1) Frequency division multiple access (FDMA) is a scheme where each con-
cerned LES or MES is assigned its own different working carrier radio fre-
quency inside the spacecraft transponder bandwidth.
(2) Time division multiple access (TDMA) is a scheme where all concerned Earth
stations use the same carrier frequency and bandwidth with time-sharing,
non-overlapping intervals.
(3) Code division multiple access (CDMA) is a scheme where all concerned Earth
stations simultaneously share the same bandwidth and recognize the signals by
various processes, such as code identiﬁcation. Actually, they share the
resources of both frequency and time using a set of mutually orthogonal codes,
such as a pseudorandom noise (PN) sequence.
(4) Space division multiple access (SDMA) is a scheme where all concerned Earth
stations can use the same frequency at the same time within a separate space
available for each link.
(5) Random (packet) division multiple access (RDMA) is a scheme where a large
number of satellite users share asynchronously the same transponder by ran-
domly transmitting short burst or packet divisions.
Currently, these methods of multiple access are widely in use with many
advantages and disadvantages, together with their combination of hybrid schemes
or with other types of modulations. Hence, multiple access technique assignment
strategy can be classiﬁed into three methods as follows: (1) preassignment or ﬁxed
assignment, (2) demand assignment (DA), and (3) random Access (RA); the bits
make up the code words in some predetermined fashion, such that the effect of an
error burst is minimized. In the preassignment method, channel plans are previously
determined for chairing the system resources, regardless of trafﬁc ﬂuctuations. This
scheme is suitable for communication links with a large amount of steady trafﬁc.
However, since most mobile users in MSC do not communicate continuously, the
preassignment method is wasteful of the satellite resources. In demand assignment
multiple access (DAMA), satellite channels are dynamically assigned to users
according to the trafﬁc requirements. Due to high efﬁciency and system ﬂexibility,
DAMA schemes are suited to MSC systems. In RA, a large number of mobile users
use the satellite resources in bursts, with long inactive intervals. In effect, to
increase the system throughout, several mobile Aloha methods have been proposed.
Therefore, the MA techniques permit more than two Earth stations to use the
same satellite network for interchanging information. Several transponders in the
3.5
Multiple Access Technique
249

satellite payload share the frequency bands in use, and each transponder will act
independently of the others to ﬁlter out its own allocated frequency and further
process that signal for transmission.
Thus, this feature allows any LES located in the corresponding coverage area to
receive carriers originating from several MES and vice versa, and carriers trans-
mitted by one MES can be received by any LES. This enables a transmitting Earth
station to group several signals into a single, multidestination carrier. Access to a
transponder may be limited to single carrier, or many carriers may exist simulta-
neously. The baseband information to be transmitted is impressed on the carrier by
the single process of multichannel modulation.
3.5.1
Frequency Division Multiple Access (FDMA)
The most common and ﬁrst employed MA scheme for satellite communication
systems is FDMA concept illustrated in Fig. 3.21 (FDMA), where transmitting
signals occupy non-overlapping frequency bands with guard bands between signals
to avoid interchannel interference. The bandwidth of a repeater channel is therefore
divided into many sub-bands each assigned to the carrier transmitted by an Earth
station. The MES transmits continuously, and the channel transmits several carriers
simultaneously at a series of different frequency bands. Because of interchannel
interference, it is necessary to provide guard intervals between each band occupied
by a carrier to allow for the imperfections of oscillators and ﬁlters. The downlink
Rx selects the required carrier in accordance with the appropriate frequency.
When the satellite transponder is operating close to its saturation, nonlinear
ampliﬁcation produces intermodulation (IM) products, which may cause interfer-
ence in the signals of other users. In order to reduce IM, it is necessary to operate
the transponder by reducing the total input power according to input back off and
that the IF ampliﬁer provides adequate ﬁltering.
Therefore, FDMA allocates a single satellite channel to one user at once. In fact,
if the transmission path deteriorates, the controller switches the system to another
channel. Although technically simple to implement, FDMA is wasteful of

Transmission Techniques

bandwidth because the voice channel is assigned to a single conversation, whether
or not somebody is speaking. Moreover, it cannot handle alternate forms of data,
only voice transmissions. This system’s advantages are that it is simple technique
using equipment proven over decades to be reliable and it will remain very com-
monly in use because of its simplicity and ﬂexibility.
It does have some disadvantages however:
(1) A FDMA method is the relatively inﬂexible system, and if there are changes in
the required capacity, then the frequency plan has to change and, thus,
involves many LES.
(2) Multiple carriers cause IM in both the MES HPA and in the transponder HPA.
Reducing IM requires back off of the HPA power, so it cannot be exploited at
full capacity.
(3) As the number of carriers increase, the IM products between carriers also
increase and more HPA back off is needed to optimize the system. The
throughput decreases relatively rapidly with the number of transmission car-
riers; therefore, for 25 carriers, it is about 40 % less than with 1 carrier.
(4) The FM system can suffer from what is known as a capture effect, where if two
received signals are very close in frequency, but of different strengths, the
stronger one tends to suppress the weaker one. For this reason, the carrier
power has to be controlled carefully.
Therefore, with the FDMA technique, the signals from the various users are
ampliﬁed by the satellite transponder in a given allocated bandwidth at the same
time but at different frequencies. Depending on the multiplexing and modulation
techniques employed, several transmission hybrid schemes can be considered and
in general may be divided into two categories, based on the trafﬁc demands of Earth
stations on MCPC and SCPC.
3.5.1.1
Multiple Channels Per Carrier (MCPC)
The main elements of the MCPC are multiplexer, modulator, and transmitter using
a satellite uplink, when LES-multiplexed baseband data is received from a terres-
trial network and destined for various MES.
Moreover, the multiplexed data are modulated and transmitted to the allocated
frequency segment, when the bandwidth of the transponder is shared among several
MES, each with different trafﬁc requirements. The transponder bandwidth is divi-
ded into several ﬁxed segments, with several time frequency divisions allocated to
these MES terminals. Namely, between each band segment is a guard band, which
reduces the bandwidth utilization efﬁciency, and the loss is directly related to the
number of accessing MES in the network as shown in Fig. 3.21 (FDMA).
Depending on the number of receiving MES, a total number of carriers will pass
through the satellite transponder.
3.5

On the other hand, the signals received from different MES extract the carrier
containing trafﬁc addressed to LES by using an appropriate RF ﬁlter, demodulator,
baseband ﬁlter, and demultiplexer. The output of the demodulator consists of
multiplexed telephone channels for a few MES together with the channels
addressed to them. A baseband ﬁlter is used to ﬁlter out the desired baseband
frequency segment, and ﬁnally, a demultiplexer retrieves individual telephone
channels and feeds them into the terrestrial network for onward transmission.
Each baseband ﬁlter of LES receive stations in this scheme corresponds to a
speciﬁc one in the LES transmitting station. However, any change in channel
capacity requires the return of this ﬁlter, which is difﬁcult to implement. Thus,
many schemes may be categorized according to the type of baseband signal.
3.5.1.2
Single Channel Per Carrier (SCPC)
For certain applications, such as the provision of MSC service to remote areas or
individual MES, trafﬁc requirements are low. In reality, assigning multiple channels
to each MES is wasteful of bandwidth because most channels remain unutilized for
a signiﬁcant part of the day. For this type of application, the SCPC type of FDMA
is used. In the SCPC system, each carrier is modulated by only one voice or by low
to medium bit-rate data channel. Some old analog systems use companded FM, but
most new systems are digital PSK modulated. In the SCPC scheme, each carrier
transmits a single carrier.
The assignment of transponder channels to each MES may be ﬁxed preassigned
multiple access (PAMA) or variable Demand Assignment Multiple Access
(DAMA); the channel slots of the transponder are assigned to different MES units
according to their instantaneous needs. In the case of PAMA, a few SCPC channels,
about 5–10, are permanently assigned to each MES. In case of DAMA, a pool of
frequency is shared by many MES terminals. When necessary, each MES requests a
channel from frequency management of the network control station (NCS), which
may always attempt to choose the best available channel or a lower quality one until
an unoccupied channel has been found. The allocation is then announced on a
signaling channel known as a broadcast channel, which is received by the calling
and called MES terminal, which then tune to the allocated channel. The commu-
nication takes place on the allocated channel, and the end of call is announced by a
signaling message, following which the NCS returns the channel to the common
pool.
The SCPS solution requires an Automatic Frequency Control (AFC) pilot to
maintain the spectrum centering on a channel-by-channel basis. This is usually
achieved by transmitting a pilot tone in the center of the transponder bandwidth. It
is transmitted by designated reference LES, and all the MESs use this reference to
correct their transmission frequency. A receiving MES uses the pilot tone to pro-
duce a local AFC system which is able to control the frequency of the individual
carriers by controlling the frequency of the LO.
252

Transmission Techniques

Hence, drift in MSC translation frequency and frequency variations caused by
the Doppler effect and the carriers retain their designated frequencies relative to
each other. This feature is essential, because if uncorrected, the sum of the total
frequency error can cause carrier overlapping, as carrier bandwidths are small.
Thus, a stable receive frequency permits the LES demodulator design to be sim-
pliﬁed. Centrally controlled networks, such as Inmarsat, are simple to manage
missions, because they provide a higher usage of channels and can use simple
demand assignment equipment. The SCPS scheme is cost-effective for networks
consisting of a signiﬁcant number of LES with a small number of channels.
3.5.2
Forms of FDMA Operations
There are several hybrid schemes of multiplexed FDMA in combination with
SCPS, PSK, TDM, and TDMA techniques.
3.5.2.1
SCPC/FM/FDMA
The baseband signals from the network or users each modulate a carrier directly, in
either analog or digital form according to the nature of SCPC signal in question.
Therefore, each carrier accesses the satellite on its particular frequency at the same
time as other carriers on the different frequencies from the same or other station
terminals. Information routing is, thus, performed according to the principle of one
carrier per link. The Inmarsat-A standard use SCPS, utilizing analog transmission
with FM for telephone channels.
Thus, in calculating the channel capacity of the SCPC/FM system, it is necessary
to ensure that the noise level does not exceed speciﬁed deﬁned values. The CCIR
Recommendations for an analog channel state that the relative level of noise power
at a point of zero should not exceed 10,000 WOP with a 50 dB test tone, namely the
noise ratio. In this way, it is assumed that the minimum required carrier-to-noise
ratio per channel is at least 10 dB.
3.5.2.2
SCPC/PSK/FDMA
In this arrangement, each voice or data channel is modulated onto its own RF
carrier. The only multiplexing occurs in the transponder bandwidth, where fre-
quency division produces individual channels within the bandwidth, so Inmarsat is
using various channel types of this multiplex scheme. The satellite transponder
carrier frequencies may be PAMA or DAMA. For PAMA carriers, the RF is
assigned to a channel unit and the PSK modem requires a ﬁxed-frequency LO input.
For DAMA, the channels may be connected according to the availability of
3.5
Multiple Access Technique
253

particular carrier frequencies within the transponder RF bandwidth. For this
arrangement, the SCPC channel frequency required is produced by a frequency
synthesizer.
The forward link assigned by TDM in shore-to-ship direction uses the
SCPC/DA/FDMA solution for Inmarsat standard-B voice/data transmission. This
standard in the return link for channel request employs Aloha O-QPSK and for low
speed data/telex uses the TDMA scheme in ship-to-shore direction. The
Inmarsat-Aero in forward ground-to-aircraft direction uses packet mode TDM for
network broadcasting, signaling and data, and the circuit mode of SCPS/DA/FDMA
with distribution channel management for service communication links. Thus, the
request for channel assignment, signaling and data in the return aircraft-to-ground
direction the Slotted Aloha BPSK (1/2 – FES) of 600 b/s is employed and con-
sequently, the TDMA scheme is reserved for data messages.
3.5.2.3
TDM/FDMA
This arrangement allows the use of TDM groups to be assembled at the satellite in
FDMA, while the PSK is used as a modulation process at the Earth station. Systems
such as this are compatible with FDM/FDMA carriers sharing the same transpon-
ders, and the terminal requirements are simple and easily incorporated. The
Inmarsat standard-B system for telex low speed data uses this scheme in the
shore-to-ship direction only and in the ship-to-shore direction uses TDMA/FDMA.
The CES TDM and SES TDMA carrier frequencies are preallocated by Inmarsat.
Each CES is allocated at least one forward CES TDM carrier frequency and a return
SES TDMA frequency. Thus, additional allocations can be made depending on the
trafﬁc requirements. The channel unit associated with the CES TDM channel for
transmission consists of a multiplexer, different encoder, frame transmit synchro-
nizer, and modulator. So at the SES, the receive path of the channel has the
corresponding functions to the transmitted end. The CES TDM channels use BPSK
with differential coding, which is used for phase ambiguity resolution at the receive
end.
3.5.2.4
TDMA/FDMA
As previously stated, however, the TDMA signals could occupy the complete
transponder bandwidth. In fact, a better variation of this is where the TDMA signals
are transmitted as a sub-band of transponder bandwidth, the remainder of which
being available, for example, for SCPC/FDMA signals. Thus, the use of a nar-
rowband TDMA arrangement is well suited for a system requiring only a few
channels and has the all advantages of satellite digital transmission but can suffer
from intermodulation with the adjacent FDMA satellite channels. Accordingly, the
practical example of this scheme is the Tlx service of the Inmarsat-B system in
254
3
Transmission Techniques

ship-to-shore direction, which, depending on the transmission trafﬁc, offers a
ﬂexible allocation of capacity for satellite communication and signaling slots.
3.5.3
Time Division Multiple Access (TDMA)
The TDMA application is a digital MA technique that permits individual Earth
station transmissions to be received by the satellite in separate, non-overlapping
time slots, called bursts, which contain buffered information. The satellite
transponder receives these bursts sequentially, without overlapping interference and
is then able to retransmit them to the MES terminal. Synchronization is necessary
and is achieved using a reference station from which burst position and timing
information can be used as a reference by all other stations. Each MES terminal
must determine the satellite system in use, time, and range so that the transmitted
signal bursts, typically QPSK modulated, are timed to arrive at the satellite in the
proper time slots.
The offset QPSK modulation is used by Inmarsat-B SES. So as to ensure the
timing of the bursts from multiple MES, TDMA systems use a frame structure
arrangement to support telex in the ship-to-shore direction. Therefore, a reference
burst is transmitted periodically by a reference station to indicate the start of each
frame to control the transmission timing of all data bursts. A second reference burst
may also follow the ﬁrst in order to provide a means of redundancy. In the proper
manner, to improve the imperfect timing of TDMA bursts, several synchronization
methods of random access, open loop, and closed loop have been proposed.
In Fig. 3.21 (TDMA), a concept of TDMA is illustrated, where each mobile
terminal transmits a data burst with a guard time to avoid overlaps. Since only one
TDMA burst occupies the full bandwidth of the satellite transponder at a time, input
back off, which is needed to reduce IM interference in FDMA, is not necessary in
TDMA. At any instant in time, the transponder receives and ampliﬁes only a single
carrier. Thus, there can be no IM, which permits the satellite ampliﬁer to be
operated in full HPA saturation and the transmitter carrier power need not be
controlled. Because all MES transmit and receive at the same frequency, tuning is
simpliﬁed. This results in a signiﬁcant increase in channel capacity. Another
advantage over FDMA is its ﬂexibility, and time-slot assignments are easier to
adjust than frequency channel assignments. The transmission rate of TDMA bursts
is about 4800 b/s, while the frame length is about 1.74 s and the optimal guard time
is approximately 40 ms, using the open-loop burst synchronization method.
There are some disadvantages because TDMA is more complex than FDMA:
(1) Two reference stations and complex computer procedures are needed, for
automated synchronizations between MES terminals.
(2) Peak power and bandwidth of individual MES terminals need to be larger than
with FDMA, owing to high burst bit rate.
3.5
Multiple Access Technique
255

Therefore, in the TDMA scheme, the transmission signals from various users are
ampliﬁed at different times but at the same nominal frequency, being spread by the
modulation in a given bandwidth. Depending on the multiplexing techniques
employed, two transmission hybrid schemes can be introduced for use in MSS.
3.5.3.1
TDM/TDMA
The Inmarsat analog standard-A uses the TDM/TDMA arrangement for telex
transmission. Each SES has at least one TDM carrier, and each of the carriers has
20 telex channels of 50 bauds and a signaling channel. Moreover, there is also a
common TDM carrier continuously transmitted on the selected idle listening fre-
quency by the NCS for out-of-band signaling. The SES remains tuned to the
common TDM carrier to receive signaling messages when the ship is idle or
engaged in a telephone call. When an SES is involved in a telex forward call, it is
tuned to the TDM/TDMA frequency pair associated with the corresponding CES to
send messages in shore-to-ship direction. Telex transmissions in the return
ship-to-shore direction form a TDMA assembly at the satellite transponder. Each
frame of the return TDMA telex carrier has 22 time slots, while each of these slots
is paired with a slot on the TDM carrier. The allocation of a pair of time slots to
complete the link is received by the SES on receipt of a request for a telex call.
Otherwise, the Inmarsat-A uses for forward signaling a telex mode, while all other
MSS Inmarsat standards for forward signaling and assignment channels use the
TDM BPSK scheme.
The new-generation Inmarsat digital standard-B (inheritor of standard-A) uses
the same modulation TDM/TDMA technique, but instead of Aloha BPSK (BCH) at
a data rate of 4800 b/s for the return request channel used by Inmarsat-A, new
standard-B is using Aloha O-QPSK (1/2 – FEC) at a data rate of 24 Kb/s. This MA
technique is also useful for the Inmarsat standard-C terminal for maritime, land, and
aeronautical applications. In this case, the forward signaling and sending of mes-
sages in ground-to-mobile direction use a ﬁxed assigned TDM carrier. The return
signaling channel uses hybrid, slotted Aloha BPSK (1/2 FEC) with a provision for
receiving some capacity, and the return message channels in the mobile-to-ground
direction are modulated by the TDMA system at a data rate of 600 b/s.
3.5.3.2
FDMA/TDMA
The Iridium system employs a hybrid FDMA/TDMA access scheme, which is
achieved by dividing the available 10.5 MHz bandwidth into 150 channels intro-
duced into the FDMA components. Each channel accommodates a TDMA frame
comprising eight time slots, four for transmission and four for reception. Each slot
lasts about 11.25 ms, during which time data are transmitted in a 50 Kb/s burst.
Each frame lasts 90 ms, and a satellite is able to support 840 channels. Thus, a user
256
3
Transmission Techniques

is allocated a channel occupied for a short period of time, during which trans-
missions occur.
3.5.4
Code Division Multiple Access (CDMA)
The CDMA solution is based on the use the modulation technique also known as
spread-spectrum multiple access (SSMA), which means that it spreads the infor-
mation contained in a particular signal of interest over a much greater bandwidth
than the original signal.
In this MA scheme, the resources of both frequency bandwidth and time are
shared by all users employing orthogonal codes, shown in Fig. 3.21 (CDMA).
Therefore, the CDMA is achieved by a PN (Pseudo-noise) sequence generated by
irreducible polynomials, which is the most popular CDMA method. In this way, a
SSMA method using low-rate error correcting codes, including orthogonal codes
with Hadamard or waveform transformation, has also been proposed.
Concerning the speciﬁc encoding process, each user is actually assigned a sig-
nature sequence, with its own characteristic code, chosen from a set of codes
assigned individually to the various users of the system. This code is mixed, as a
supplementary modulation, with the useful information signal. On reception, from
all the signals that are received, a given user is able to select and recognize, by its
own code, the signal, which is intended for it, and then to extract useful informa-
tion. The other received signal can be intended for other users, but they can also
originate from unwanted emissions, which gives CDMA a certain antijamming
capability. For this operation, where it is necessary to identify one CDMA trans-
mission signal among several others sharing the same band at the same time,
correlation techniques are generally employed. From a commercial and military
perspective, this MA is still new and has signiﬁcant advantages. Interference from
adjacent satellite systems including jammers is better solved than with other
systems.
This scheme is simple to operate as it requires no synchronization of the
transmitter and is more suited for a military MES. Small mobile antennas can be
very useful in these applications, without the interference caused by wide antenna
bandwidths. Using multibeam satellites, frequency reuse with CDMA is very
effective and allows good ﬂexibility in the management of trafﬁc and the
orbit/spectrum resources. The power ﬂux density (PFD) of the CDMA signal
received in the service area is automatically limited, with no need for any other
dispersal processes. It also provides a low probability of intercept of the users and
some kind of privacy, due to individual characteristic codes. The main disadvantage
of CDMA by satellite is that the bandwidth required for the space segment of the
spread carrier is very large, compared to that of a single unspread carrier, so the
throughput is somewhat lower than with other systems.
3.5
Multiple Access Technique
257

Therefore, in the CDMA scheme, the signals from various users operate
simultaneously, at the same nominal frequency but are spread in the given allocated
bandwidth by a special encoding process.
Depending on the multiplexing techniques employed the bandwidth may extend
to the entire capacity of the transponder but is often restricted to its own part, so
CDMA can possibly be combined in the hybrid scheme with FDMA and/or TDMA.
The SSMA technique can be classiﬁed into two methods: direct sequence (DS) and
frequency hopping (FH). A combined system of DC and FH is called a hybrid
CDMA system, and the processing gain can be improved without increases of chip
rate. The hybrid system has been used in the military Joint Tactical Information
Distribution System (JTIDS) and OmniTRACS, which is Ku-band MSS, developed
by the Qualcomm Company. In a more precise sense, the CDMA technique was
developed and implemented by experts of the Qualcomm Company in 1987.
At present, the CDMA system advantages are practically effective in new
satellite systems, such as Globalstar, also developed by Qualcomm, which is
devoted to MSS handheld terminals and Skybridge, involved in FSS. This type of
MA is therefore attractive for handheld and portable MSS equipment with a wide
antenna pattern.
Antennas with large beam widths can otherwise create or be subjected to
interference with adjacent satellites. This MA technique is very attractive for
commercial, military and even TT&C communications because some Russian
satellites use CDMA for command and telemetry purposes.
The synchronous CDMA (S-CDMA) scheme proves efﬁciently to eliminate
interference arising from other users sharing the same carrier and the same spot
beam. Interference from other spot beams that overlap the coverage of the intended
spot is still considerable. This process to ensure orthogonality between all links
requires signaling to adjust transmission in time and frequency domains for every
user independently.
3.5.4.1
Direct Sequence CDMA (DS-CDMA)
This dominant DS-CDMA technique is also called pseudo-noise (PN) modulation,
where the modulated signal is multiplied by a PN code generator, which generates a
pseudorandom binary sequence of length (N) at a chip rate (Rc), much larger than
information bit rate (Rb), with a relation as follows:
Rc ¼ N  Rb
ð3:48Þ
This sequence is combined with the information signal cut into small chip rates
(Rc), thus speeding the combined signal in a much larger bandwidth (W * Rc);
namely, the resulting signal has wider frequency bandwidth than the originally
modulated signal. The transmitting signal can be expressed in the following way:
258
3
Transmission Techniques

sðtÞ ¼ mðtÞ pðtÞ cos 2pfct
ð
Þ ¼ mðtÞ pðtÞ cos xct
ð3:49Þ
where m(t) = binary message to be transmitted and p(t) = spreading NP binary
sequence. At the receiver, the signal is coherently demodulated by multiplying the
received signal by a replica of the carrier.
Neglecting thermal noise, the receiving signal at the input of the detector of
low-pass ﬁlter (LPF) is given by:
rðtÞ ¼ mðtÞ pðtÞ cos xct 2 cos xct
ð
Þ ¼ mðtÞ pðtÞ þ mðtÞ pðtÞ cos 2xct
ð3:50Þ
The detector LLF eliminates the HF components and retains only the LW
components, such as u(t) = m(t) p(t). This component is then multiplied by the local
code [p(t)] in phase with the received code, where the product p(t)2 = 1. At the
output of the multiplier this gives:
xðtÞ ¼ mðtÞ pðtÞ pðtÞ ¼ mðtÞ pðtÞ2 ¼ mðtÞ
V
½ 
ð3:51Þ
The signal is then integrated over one bit period to ﬁlter the noise. The trans-
mitted message is recovered at the integrator output, so in fact, only the same PN
code can achieve the despreading of the received signal bandwidth. In this process,
the interference or jamming spectrum is spread by the PN codes, while other user’s
signals, spared by different PN codes, are not despread.
Interference or jamming power density in the bandwidth of the received signal
decreases from their original power. Otherwise, the most widely accepted measure
of interference rejection is the processing gain (Gp), which is given by the ratio
Rc/Rb and value of Gp = 20–60 dB. The input and output signal-to-noise ratios are
related as follows:
ðS=NÞOutput ¼ GpðS=NÞInput
ð3:52Þ
Therefore, for DS-CDMA, a transmitter will assemble a bit stream consisting of
message and code information as a function of time.
In the forward link, the LES (HUB station) transmits the spread-spectrum
signals, which are spread with synchronized PN sequence to different MSC users.
Since orthogonal codes can be used, the mutual interference in the network is
negligible and the channel capacity is close to that of FDMA. Conversely, in the
return link, the signals transmitted from different MES users are not synchronized
and they are not orthogonal. The ﬁrst case is referred to as synchronous and the
second case as asynchronous SSMA.
However, the nonorthogonality causes interference due to the transmission of
other MES in the satellite network, and as the number of simultaneously accessing
users increases, the communication quality gradually degrades in a process called
graceful degradation.
3.5
Multiple Access Technique
259

3.5.4.2
Frequency Hopping CDMA (FH-CDMA)
The FH-CDMA system works similar to the DS system, since a correlation process
of dehopping is also performed at the receiver. The difference is that here the
pseudorandom sequence is used to control a frequency synthesizer, which results in
the transmission of each information bit rate in the form of (N) multiple pulses at
different frequencies in an extended bandwidth. The transmitted and received sig-
nals of FH-CDMA system have the following forms:
sðtÞ ¼ mðtÞ cos xcðtÞ t
rðtÞ ¼ mðtÞ cos xcðtÞ t  2 cos xcðtÞ t ¼ mðtÞ þ mðtÞ cos 2xcðtÞ t
ð3:53Þ
Thus, at the receiver, the carrier is multiplied by an unmodulated carrier gen-
erated under the same conditions as at the transmitter. The second term in the
receiver is eliminated by the LPF of the demodulator. The relation of processing
gain for FH is as follows:
Gp ¼ W=Df
ð3:54Þ
where W = frequency bandwidth and Δf = bandwidth of the originally modulated
signal. At this point, coherent demodulation is difﬁcult to implement in FH recei-
vers because it is a problem to maintain phase relation between the frequency steps.
Due to the relatively slow operation of the frequency synthesizer, DS schemes
permit higher code rates than FH radio.
3.5.5
Space Division Multiple Access (SDMA)
The previous systems have used frequency, time, and code domains to achieve
multiple access schemes, while SDMA uses spatial separation.
The signiﬁcant factor in the performance of MA in a satellite communications
system is interference caused by different factors and other users. In the other
words, the most usual types of interference are cochannel and adjacent channel
interference. The cochannel interference can be caused by transmissions from
non-adjacent cells or spot beams using the same set of frequencies, where there is
minimal physical separation from neighboring cells using the same frequencies,
while the adjacent channel interference is caused by RF leakage on the subscriber’s
channel from a neighboring cell using an adjacent frequency.
This can occur when the user’s signal is much weaker than that of the adjacent
channel user. Signal-to-interference ratio (SIR) is an important indicator of call
quality; it is a measure of the ratio between the mobile phone signal (the carrier
signal) and an interfering signal. A higher SIR ratio means increasing overall
system capacity.
260
3
Transmission Techniques

Taking into account that within the systems of satellite communications, every
user has their own unique spatial position, and this fact may be used for the
separation of channels in space and, as a consequence, to increase he SIR ratio by
using SDMA. In effect, this method is physically making the separation of paths
available for each satellite link.
Terrestrial telecommunication networks can use separate cables or radio links,
but on a single satellite, independent transmission paths are required. Thus, this MA
control radiates energy into space and transmission can be on the same frequency,
such as TDMA or CDMA, and on different frequencies, such as FDMA.
3.5.5.1
Special Effects of SDMA in Wireless Systems
The new technologies are recently implemented for the third-generation wireless
(3G) with future enhancements. Some of the key enhancements to wireless tech-
nology include SDMA, the introduction of 3G wireless technologies and integration
with personal and mobile applications including aeronautical. The SDMA method
is a special system access technology that allows a single transmitter location to
provide multiple communication channels by dividing the radio coverage into
focused radio beams that reuse the same frequency. To allow multiple accesses,
each mobile radio is assigned to a focused radio beam. These radio beams may
dynamically change with the location of the mobile radio.
Analogously, in reception, the mobile antenna picks up signals coming from all
directions, including noise and interference. These considerations have lead to the
development of the SDMA technique, which is based on deriving and exploiting
information on the spatial position of mobile terminals. The use of an adaptive
antenna array at the base station thus allows introducing the SDMA technique,
whose main advantage is the capability to increase system capacity, i.e., the number
of users it can handle.
This increase can be obtained in two technical ways for the following
applications:
1. Reduction in Cochannel Interference—The reduction in the level of
cochannel interference between the different cells using the same group of radio
channels is obtained, as above seen, by minimizing the gain in the direction of
interfering mobile units. This technique, indicated with the acronym spatial
ﬁltering for interference reduction (SFIR), allows reducing frequency reuse
distance and cluster size. In this way, each transmission cell can be assigned a
higher number of channels by phase array antenna, as shown in Fig. 3.22 (left).
2. Spatial Orthogonality—In conventional multiple access techniques, orthogo-
nality between signals associated with different users is obtained by transmitting
them in different frequency bands of FDMA, in different time slots of TDMA, or
using different code sequences of CDMA. However, using an antenna array, it is
possible to create an additional degree of orthogonality between signals trans-
mitted to and from different directions. It is thus possible to assign the same
3.5
Multiple Access Technique
261

physical channel to several mobile units, as depicted in Fig. 3.22 (right), when
the angles at which they are seen by the base station or satellite transponder are
sufﬁciently separated. The result is an increase in the number of available
channels, since the same physical channel, for example, the same carrier in a
FDMA or the same time slot in a TDMA system, can be subdivided into multiple
spatial channels, each of which is assigned to a different user. So, the multiple
users belonging to the same cell use the same channel. In addition, the same
frequency can be also available in same cell or satellite spot coverage by using
the more improved adaptive array system (AAS). Thus, the advantage of this
system is providing better control of radiated energy in space; it is employing
usage of spot beams antennas, may be served different areas by using same
frequency for TDMA and CDMA, or can be used different frequencies for
FDMA and can use adaptive antennas that dynamically adopt to number of users.
Disadvantages of this system are possible problems with reverse links, limitation
of battery capability for some handheld units, and interference impairments.
Therefore, the SDMA mode in MSC optimizes the use of radio spectrum and
minimizes system cost by taking advantage of the directional properties of dish
antennas. In SDMA, satellite dish antennas transmit signals to numerous zones on
the Earth’s surface. Moreover, the mobile satellite antennas are highly directional,
allowing duplicate frequencies to be used for multiple surface zones.
3.5.5.2
Special Effects of SDMA in Mobile Radio Systems
In a FDMA mobile radio system, however, capacity is limited by two different
factors. On the one hand, a limited number of radio channels, carriers, and time slots
are available, and they must be subdivided among beams making up a cluster. On the
other hand, cochannel interference limits channel reuse. The SDMA technique
allows to expand both these limits and to enhance system capacity. As already
Fig. 3.22 Phased-array antenna and base station for SDMA mode—Courtesy of Web: by Google
262

Transmission Techniques

described, this can occur in two different ways: with the SFIR technique and spatial
orthogonality. In such a way, interference level is reduced and channel reuse distance
is decreased, whereas the actual SDMA technique assigns the same channel to
multiple, spatially separated users. In Fig. 3.23 is shown a SDMA system, which
diagram shows a single tower that is serving many different users from the same radio
tower on the same frequency using independent beams of radio energy. In practice,
this is not possible to achieve, because each type of mobile system has different
frequency band, but they can be seen in separate way. On the other hand, the SDMA
technique requires an array composed of more antennas than the SFIR technique
does. In fact, spatial orthogonality is exploited by eliminating, through the use of
spatial ﬁltering, intra-cell cochannel interference, which is due to mobile units
belonging to the same cells and using the same channel as the mobile unit in question.
Differently to say, in traditional radio systems, the base station, having no
information on the position of mobile units, is forced to radiate the signal in all
direction, in order to cover the entire area of the cell. This entails both a waste of
power and the transmission, in the directions where there are no mobile terminals to
reach, of a signal which will be seen as interfering for cochannel cells, i.e., those
cells using the same group of radio channels.
It must be noted that the term SDMA refers, strictly speaking, only to the latter
application, in which SDMA is actually accomplished. In spite of this fact, the SFIR
technique is also considered within the SDMA technique, since it is based on the
same principles. In addition to the opportunity to increase system capacity, the
SDMA technique has additional characteristics making its introduction in a mobile
radio system advantageous. In particular, it is possible to exploit the higher receive
gain offered by an antenna array with respect to an omnidirectional case, to allow
mobile units to transmit at reduced power, and therefore lower consumption. At
equal power, gain can be exploited to extend beam size. This is useful when it is

necessary to cover vast surface areas, typically rural areas, characterized by a low
mobile radio trafﬁc density, with a limited number of base stations.
3.5.5.3
Special Effects of SDMA in Mobile Satellite Systems
The SDMA technology has been successfully used in satellite communications for
several years. As stated, the SDMA technique can also be integrated with all the
different MA techniques in use, such as FDMA, TDMA, and CDMA and therefore
can be applied to any mobile communication system. However, we shall see that
the ways in which the SDMA technique can be introduced and the advantages it
provides differ depending on the system under consideration. As aforesaid descri-
bed, modiﬁcations required to realize the SDMA technique are limited to the
satellite array and thus do not involve mobile units. However, this allows intro-
ducing this technique in existing mobile satellite systems, with no need to modify
their characteristics.
The ability to reject jammer of adaptive arrays can be ensured for performing
SDMA mode where several mobiles are allowed to share the same classical access
in a cell, leading to a capacity increase. In Fig. 3.24 is shown this sharing with
possibility through the use of adaptive beam forming and interference rejection on
the satellite uplink and downlink communication for mobiles, which are located at

Transmission Techniques

In using SDMA, either FDMA or TDMA is needed to allow GES to roam in the
same satellite beam or for polarization to enter the repeater. Thus, the frequency
reuse technique of same frequency is effectively a form of SDMA scheme, which
depends upon achieving adequate beam-to-beam and polarization isolation. Using
this system, reverse line means that interference may be a problem and the capacity
of the battery is limited.
On the other hand, a single satellite may achieve spatial separation by using
beams with horizontal and vertical polarization or left-hand and right-hand circular
polarization. This could allow two beams to cover the same Earth surface area,
being separated by the polarization. Thus, the satellite could also have multiple
beams using separate antennas or using a single antenna with multiple feeds.
In case of multiple satellite communication systems, spatial separation can be
achieved with orbital longitude or latitude and for intersatellite links, by using
different planes. Except for frequency reuse, this system provides onboard
switching techniques, which, in turn, enhance channel capacity. Additionally, the
use of narrow beams from the satellite allows the Earth station to operate with
smaller antennas and so produce a higher power density per unit area for a given
transmitter power.
Therefore, through the careful use of polarization, beams (SDMA) or orthogonal
(CDMA), the same frequency spectrum may be reused several times, with limited
interference among mobile users.
The more detailed beneﬁts of an SDMA system include the following:
(1) The number of cells required to cover a given area can be substantially
reduced.
(2) Interference from other systems and from users in other cells is signiﬁcantly
reduced.
(3) The destructive effects of multipath signals, copies of the desired signal that
have arrived at the antenna after bouncing from objects between the signal
source and the antenna, can often be mitigated.
(4) Channel reuse patterns of the systems can be signiﬁcantly tighter because the
average interference resulting from cochannel signals in other cells is mark-
edly reduced.
(5) Separate spatial channels can be created in each cell on the same conventional
channel. In other words, intra-cell reuse of conventional channels is possible.
(6) The SDMA station radiates much less total power than a conventional station.
One result is a reduction in network-wide RF pollution. Another is a reduction
in power ampliﬁer size.
(7) The direction of each spatial channel is known and can be used to accurately
establish the position of the signal source.
(8) The SDMA technique is compatible with almost any modulation method,
bandwidth, or frequency band, including GSM, PHP, DECT, IS-54, IS-95, and
other formats. The SDMA solution can be implemented with a broad range of
array geometry and antenna types.

Another perspective of the realization of SDMA systems is the application of
smart antenna arrays with different levels of intelligence consisting of the antenna
array and digital processor. Since the frequency of transmission for satellite com-
munications is high enough (mostly 6 or 14 GHz), the dimensions of an array
placed in orbit are commensurable with the dimensions of the parabolic antenna,
which is a necessary condition to put such systems into orbit.
Thus, the SDMA scheme mostly responds to the demands of LEO and MEO
constellations, when the signals of users achieve the satellite antenna under different
angles (± 22o for the MEO). In this instance, ground level may be split into the
number of zones of service coverage determined by switched multiple beam pattern
lobes in different satellite detections, or by adaptive antenna separations, shown in
Fig. 3.25 (left). There are two different beam-forming approaches in SDMA
satellite communications: (1) The multiple spot beam antennas are the fundamental
way of applying SDMA in large ﬁxed and mobile satellite systems and (2) adaptive
array antennas dynamically adapt to the number of users.
3.5.5.4
Switched Spot Beam Antenna
Switched multibeam antennas are designed to track each subscriber of a given cell
with an individual beam pattern as the target subscriber moves within the cell
(spot). Therefore, it is possible to use array antennas and to create a group of
overlapping beams that together result in omnidirectional coverage. This is the
simplest technique comprising only a basic switching function between separate
directive antennas or predeﬁned beams of an array. Beam-switching algorithms and
RF signal-processing software are incorporated into smart antenna designs. For
each call, software algorithms determine the beams that maintain the highest quality
signal and the system continuously updates beam selection, ensuring that customers
get optimal quality for the duration of their call. One might design overlapping

beam patterns pointing in slightly different directions, similar to the ones shown in
Fig. 3.25 (left).
Every so often, the system scans the outputs of each beam and selects the beam
with the largest output power. The black cells reuse the frequencies currently
assigned to the mobile terminals, so they are potential sources of interference. In
fact, the use of a narrow beam reduces the number of interfering sources seen at the
base station. Namely, as the mobile moves, the smart antenna system continuously
monitors the signal quality to determine when a particular beam should be selected.
Switched-beam antennas are normally used only for the reception of signals,
since there can be ambiguity in the system’s perception of the location of the
received signal. In fact, these antennas give the best performance, usually in terms
of received power, but they also suppress interference arriving from directions away
from the active antenna beam’s center, and because of the higher directivity,
compared to a conventional antenna, some gain is achieved. In high-interference
areas, switched-beam antennas are further limited since their pattern is ﬁxed and
they lack the ability to adaptively reject interference. Such an antenna will be easier
to implement in existing cell structures than the more sophisticated adaptive arrays,
but it gives only limited improvement.
3.5.5.5
Adaptive Array Antenna Systems
Adaptive array antenna systems select one beam pattern for each user out of a
number of preset ﬁxed beam patterns, depending on the location of the subscribers.
At all events, these systems continually monitor their coverage areas, attempting to
adapt to their changing radio environment, which consists of (often mobile) users
and interferers. Thus, in the simplest scenario, that of a single user and no inter-
ferers, the system adapts to the user’s motion by providing an effective antenna
system pattern that follows the mobile user, always providing maximum gain in the
user’s direction.
The principle of SDMA with adaptive antenna system application is quite dif-
ferent from the beam-forming approaches described in Fig. 3.25 (right).
The events processed in SDMA adaptive array antenna systems are as follows:
(1) A “snapshot,” or sample, is taken of the transmission signals coming from all
of the antenna elements, converted into digital form and stored in memory.
(2) The SDMA digital processor analyzes the sample to estimate the radio envi-
ronment at this point, identifying users and interferers and their locations.
(3) The processor calculates the combining strategy for the antenna signals that
optimally recovers the user’s signals. With this strategy, each user’s signal is
received with as much gain as possible and with the other users/interferers
signals rejected as much as possible.
(4) An analogous calculation is done to allow spatially selective transmission
from the array. Each user’s signal is now effectively delivered through a
separate spatial channel.
3.5
Multiple Access Technique
267

(5) The system now has the ability to both transmit and receive information on
each of the spatial channels, making them two-way channels.
As a result, the SDMA adaptive array antenna system can create a number of
two-way spatial channels on a single conventional channel, be it frequency, time, or
code. Of course, each of these spatial channels enjoys the full gain and interference
rejection capabilities of the antenna array. In theory, an antenna array with
(n) elements can support (n) spatial channels per conventional channel. In practice,
the number is somewhat less because the received multipath signals, which can be
combined to direct received signals, takes place. In addition, by using special
algorithms and space diversity techniques, the radiation pattern can be adapted to
receive multipath signals, which can be combined. Hence, these techniques will
maximize the SIR or signal-to-interference and noise ratio (SINR).
3.5.5.6
SDMA/FDMA
This modulation arrangement uses ﬁlters and ﬁxed links within the satellite trans-
ceiver to route an incoming uplink frequency to a particular downlink transmission
antenna, shown in Fig. 3.26 (left). A basic conﬁguration of ﬁxed links may be set
up using a switch that is selected only occasionally. Thus, an alternative solution
allows the ﬁlter to be switched using a switch matrix, which is controlled by a
command link. Because of the term SS (switching satellite), this scheme would be
classiﬁed as SDMA/SS/FDMA, whose block diagram is shown in Fig. 3.26 (right).
The satellite switches are changed only rarely, only when it is desired to
reconﬁgure the satellite, to take account of possible trafﬁc changes. The main
disadvantage of this solution is the need for ﬁlters, which increase the mass of the
payload.

3.5.5.7
SDMA/TDMA
This solution is similar to the previously explained SDMA/SS/FDMA in that a
switch system allows a TDMA receiver to be connected to a single beam. Switching
again is only carried out when it is required to reconﬁgure the satellite. Under
normal conditions, a link between beam pairs is maintained and operated under
TDMA conditions.
The utilization of time slots may be arranged on an organized or contention
basis, and switching is achieved by using the RF signal. Thus, onboard processing
is likely to be used in the future, allowing switching to take place by the utilization
of baseband signals. The signal could be restored in quality and even stored to
allow transmission in a new time slot in the outgoing TDMA frame.
This scheme is providing up and downlinks for the later Intelsat VI spacecraft,
known as SDMA/SS/TDMA, whose block diagram is shown in Fig. 3.26b.
This MA is using to allow TDMA trafﬁc from the uplink beams to be switched to
downlink beams during the course of TDMA frame. At this point, the connection
exists at a speciﬁc time for the burst duration within the frame time before the next
connection is made and so on.
3.5.5.8
SDMA/CDMA
This arrangement allows access to a common frequency band and may be used to
provide the MA to the satellite, when each stream is decoded on the satellite in
order to obtain the destination addresses. Thus, onboard circuitry must be capable
of determining different destination addresses, which may arrive simultaneously,
while also denying invalid users access to the downlink. However, onboard pro-
cessors allow the CDMA bit stream to be retimed, regenerated, and stored on the
satellite. Because of this possibility, the downlink CDMA conﬁgurations need not
be the same as for uplink and the Earth link may thus be optimized.
3.5.6
Random Division Multiple Access (RDMA)
For data transmission, a bit stream may be sent continuously over an established
channel without the need to provide addresses or unique words if the channel is not
charred. In fact, where charring is implemented, data are sent in bursts, which, thus,
requires unique words or synchronization signals to enable time-sharing with other
users, to be affected in the division of channels. Each burst may consist of one or
more packets comprising data from one or more sources that have been assembled
over time, processed and made ready for transmission. However, this type of
multiplex scheme is also known as Packet MA. Packet access can be used in special
RDMA solutions, such as Aloha, where retransmission of blocked packets may be
required.
3.5
Multiple Access Technique
269

Random access can be achieved to the satellite link by contention, and for that
reason, it is called a contention access scheme. This type of access is well-suited to
satellite networks containing a large number of stations, such as MES, where each
station is required to transmit short randomly generated messages with long dead
times between messages.
The principle of RDMA is to permit the transmission of messages almost
without restriction, in the form of limited duration bursts, which occupy all the
bandwidth of the transmission channel. Therefore, in other words, this is MA with
time division and random transmission, and an attribute for the synonym random
division multiple access is quite assessable. A user transmits a message irrespective
of the fact that there may be other users equally in connection. The probability of
collisions between bursts at the satellite is accepted, causing the data to be blocked
from receipt by the Earth station. In case of collision, the destination Earth station
receiver will be confronted with interference noise, which can compromise message
identiﬁcation and retransmission after a random delay period. The retransmissions
can occur as many times as probably are carried out, using random time delays.
Therefore, such a scheme implies that the transmitter vies for satellite resources
on a per-demand basis. It will provide that no other transmitter is attempting to
access the same resources during the transmission burst period, when an error-free
transmission can occur. The types of random protocols are distinguished by the
means provided to overcome this disadvantage. The performance of these protocols
is measured in terms of the throughput and the mean transmission delay.
Throughput is the ratio of the volume of trafﬁc delivered at the destination to the
maximum capacity of the transmission channels. The transmission time, i.e., delay,
is a random variable. Its mean value indicates the mean time between the generation
of a message and its correct reception by the destination station.
3.5.6.1
Aloha
The most widely used contention access scheme is Aloha and its associated
derivatives. This solution was developed in the late 1960s by the University of
Hawaii and allows usage of small and inexpensive Earth stations (including MES)
to communicate with a minimum of protocols and no network supervision. This is
the simplest mode of operation, in which time shares a single RF divided among
multiple users and consists of stations randomly accessing a particular resource that
is used to transmit packets. When an Aloha station has something to transmit, it
immediately sends a burst of data pulses and can detect whether its transmission has
been correctly received at the satellite by either monitoring the retransmission from
the satellite or by receiving an acknowledgment message from the receiving party.
Should a collision with another transmitting station occur, resulting in the incorrect
reception of a packet at the satellite, the transmitting station waits for a random
period of time, prior to retransmitting the packet. Otherwise, a remote station
(MES) uses Aloha to get a HUB station (LES) terminal’s attention. Namely, the
MES terminal sends a brief burst requesting a frequency or time slot assignment for
270
3
Transmission Techniques

the main transmission. Thus, once the assignment for MES is made, there is no
further need for the Aloha channel, which becomes available for other stations to
use. After that, the main transmissions are then made on the assigned channels. At
the end, the Aloha channel might be used again to drop the main channel assign-
ments after the transmission is completed. The advantages of Aloha are the lack of
any centralized control, giving simple, low-cost stations and the ability to transmit
at any time, without having to consider other users.
In the case where the user population is homogenous, so that the packet duration
and message generation rate are constant, it can be shown that the trafﬁc carried S
(packet correctly interpreted by the receiver), as a function of total trafﬁc G (original
and retransmitted message), is given by the relation:
S ¼ G exp ð2GÞ
packet=time slot
½

ð3:55Þ
where S = transmission throughput and G are expressed as a number of packets per
time slot equal to the common packet duration. The Aloha protocol cannot exceed a
throughput of 18 %, and the mean transmission time increases very rapidly as the
trafﬁc
increases

The Aloha mode is relatively inefﬁcient with a maximum throughput of only
18.4 % (1/2). However, this has to be counterweight against the gains in simple
network complexity, since no-coordination or complex timing properties are
required at the transmitting MES.
3.5.6.2
Slotted Aloha
This form of Aloha or S-Aloha, where the time domain is divided into slots
equivalent to a single packet burst time; there will be no overlap, as is the case with
ordinary Aloha. In Fig. 3.27 is shown a simpliﬁed arrangement that presents this
point. The transmissions from different stations are now synchronized in such a way
that packets are located at the satellite in time slots deﬁned by the network clocks
and equal to the common packet duration. Hence, there cannot be partial collisions;
every collision arises from complete superposition of packets. In effect, the time-
scale of collision is thus reduced to the duration of a packet, whereas with the Aloha
protocol, this timescale is equal to the duration of both packets. At this point, this
situation divides the probability of collision by two and the throughput becomes:
S ¼ G exp ðGÞ
packet=time slot
½

ð3:56Þ
This protocol enables collisions between new messages and retransmission to be
avoided and increases the throughput of S-Aloha in the order of 50–60 % by
introducing a frame structure, which permits the numbering of time slots. Each
packet incorporates additional information indicating the slot number reserved for
retransmission in case of collision.
3.5
Multiple Access Technique
271

For the same value of utilization as basic Aloha, the time delay and probability
of packet loss are both improved. The major disadvantages of S-Aloha are that
more complex equipment in the Earth station is necessary, and because of the
timing requirement and because there are ﬁxed time slots, customers with a small
transmission requirement are wasting capacity by not using the time slot to its full
availability.
3.5.6.3
Slot Reservation Aloha
This solution of an extension for the slotted Aloha scheme allows time slots to be
reserved for transmission by an Earth station. In general terms, this mode of
operation is termed as a Packed Reserved Multiple Access (PRMA). Slot reservation
basically takes the following two forms:
1. Implicit—When a station acquires a slot and successfully transmits, the slot is
reserved for that station for as long as it takes the station to complete its
transmission. The network controller then informs all stations on the network
that the slot is available for contention once more. There is only the problem that
a station with much data to transmit could block the system to other users.
2. Explicit—Every user station may send a request for the reservation of a time
slot prior to transmission of data. A record of all time slot occupation and
reservation requests is kept. Actually, a free time slot could be allocated on a
priority basis. Some kind of control for the reservation of slots is necessary, and

this could be accomplished by a single or all stations being informed of slot
occupancy and reservation requests.
3.6
Mobile Broadband and Internet Protocols
Under the third- and fourth-generation IMT-2000 services, high-speed and
large-capacity multimedia data and Internet will be delivered through the satellite
and radio networks, and a wide variety of network services such as global roaming
will be provided at the same time. In such a way, many solutions and protocols will
be employed in terrestrial radio and telecommunication systems, including ISDN,
IP, Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), IP/ATM, Unspeciﬁed Bit Rate (UBR),
and Available Bit Rate (ABR) broadband and Internet solutions and protocols.
With its new advanced service menu, the IMT-2000 network is required to
provide not only mobility management for individual terminals but also various
service control functions. With capabilities such as QoS, in which the desired
communications quality is individually established for each session, the IP/ATM
switching system provides for a sophisticated and economic network conﬁguration.
Usage of different satellite ﬁxed and mobile solutions has increased dramatically
in past years. Along with that trend, there has been an increasing demand for higher
transmission rates. Hence, to cope with this demand, new technologies have
emerged onto the radio and telecommunications stage. The IP/ATM over satellite is
one ﬁne example, which is creating waves in the global telecommunication world
today and is ideal for a wide range of satellite applications, including data transfer,
voice, imaging, full motion video, and multimedias. Its characteristics include
scalability, which make it ideal for the trafﬁc demands of broadband multimedia
expected on data networks of the future. Just as the Internet revolutionized
worldwide communications, ATM brings new meaning to high-speed satellite
networking.
The development of the Internet technologies is the concern of the Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF), which publishes its recommendations on the Web
site under a series of Request for Comments (RFC) documents, with a speciﬁc
identiﬁcation number for each RFC. These documents are available for down-
loading from the IETF Web site in the form of information FYI RFC documents or
those that specify Internet Standards (STD RFC).
3.6.1
Mobile Internet Protocol (IP)
The drive toward the establishment of an information society will bring together the
two most successful solutions of all of the technological advances of the latter
quarter of the twentieth century. This is the integration of Internet and mobile
3.5
Multiple Access Technique

communications to deliver Mobile IP to all mobile customers. In this respect,
fourth-generation (4G) mobile networks will be based upon an IP-environment.
Signiﬁcant effort around the world is now underway toward standardizing such a
mobile environment through such organizations as the Mobile Wireless Internet
Forum (MWIF), IETF, 3GPP, and 3GPP2. Recently, two different approaches to
the network architecture by 3GPP and 3GPP2 have been proposed. First, the 3GPP
solution for the W-CDMA radio interface is based on an evolution of the GMPSC
network, with enhancements to the call control functionalities obtained though the
introduction of a new network element, Called State Control Function (CSCF), to
allow the provision of voice over IP (VoIP) services. Second, the 3GPP2 solution
for the CDMA2000 radio interface system has adopted a forthcoming packet net-
work architecture incorporating mobile IP functionalities in support of packet data
mobility. Eventually, it is hoped that a single, harmonized solution will emerge
from the two distinct approaches. In the future mobile network, therefore, where
satellites will operate alongside terrestrial mobile networks, various categories of
service will coexist, where “best effort,” which is presently available over the
Internet, will operate with guaranteed QoS classes.
Moreover, the move toward an all IP network should facilitate the networking
between satellite and terrestrial mobile networks, since the problem of providing
mobile link connectivity across the different networks reduces to the level of
attaining the appropriate route to direct the packets of information to the appropriate
terminal. In the mobile IP environment, the mobile terminal has a temporary IP
address, known as the Care-of Address (CoA), which is associated with a corre-
spondent node of a particular access network. The CoA is in addition to the IP
address that is permanently assigned to the mobile terminal, which is its home
address, which is stored at its home subnetwork. Thus, the mobile node’s CoA is
made known to the home agent. Packets addressed to the mobile node are thus
tunneled by the home agent to the correspondent node, identiﬁed by the CoA.
Namely, when a mobile node moves from one access network to another, a new
CoA will be assigned by the visiting network operator corresponding to the new
correspondent node.
The mobile node then makes the home agent aware of the change in the CoA,
through the transmission of a binding update message. Mobile IP and the mobile
router will play a major role in NASA’s aeronautics programs, including AATT,
WINCOMM, and SATS. Each program requires continuous connectivity, while
dynamically traversing various subnetworks. Figure 3.28 illustrates what a potential
aeronautical network could entail in 2005. Although only the USA is shown,
connectivity will however be global. In addition, the future aeronautical networks
will use whatever wireless networking is available at reasonable cost. The LEO,
MEO, HEO, or GEO satellite constellations may be used, as will VHF data link
(VDL),
future
stratospheric
communication
platforms
(SCP),
and
perhaps
next-generation cellular, if it survives the competition previously mentioned.
Unique, cost-effective satellite techniques will also be deployed using GEO
satellite direct broadcasting, known as Digital Video Broadcasting (DVB).

(MPEG-2) transport streams to transmit data to the aircraft. The return path would
be an inexpensive, low-bandwidth, duplex channel. Under the AATT program,
NASA is working in alliance with the FAA to enable an increase in capacity,
ﬂexibility, and efﬁciency, while maintaining ﬂight safety of aircraft operations
within the USA and the global airspace system. Similar to a WAAS, the goals are to
increase terminals throughput by 40 % and to increase en route throughput by
20 %. Current operations in the National Air System (NAS) are severely con-
strained by an antiquated ATM, supported by a decades-old CNS infrastructure,
using primarily analog radio voice, radar surveillance, and ground-based naviga-
tional aids. Extensive ATC system delays and gridlock have resulted. A digital
airspace WAAS/IP infrastructure is needed to meet the bandwidth, latency, security,
and integrity requirements of the future free-ﬂight ATM system. The mobile router
is an enabling technology for such a system.
3.6.1.1
IP Security Protocol (IPSec)
The IPSec protocol is a framework of open standards developed by the IETF, which
can provide security for the transmission of sensitive information over unprotected
networks such as the Internet. In this sense, the IPSec protocol acts at the network
layer, protecting and authenticating IP packets between participating IPSec devices,
such as Cisco or other IP routers. With IPSec, data can be transmitted across a
public network without fear of observation, modiﬁcation, or spooﬁng. This mode

3.6
Mobile Broadband and Internet Protocols
275

enables ﬁxed applications such as virtual private networks (VPNs), including
intranets, extranets, and remote user access.
Mobile users will be able to establish a secure connection back to their ofﬁce,
similar to the encryption method. For example, the mobile user can establish an
IPSec known as a “tunnel” with a corporate ﬁrewall, requesting authentication
services in order to gain access to the corporate network; all of the trafﬁc between
the user and the ﬁrewall will then be authenticated. The user can then establish an
additional IPSec tunnel requesting data privacy services with an internal router or
end system.
Therefore, the IPSec method is a framework of open standards that provides data
conﬁdentiality, data integrity, and data authentication between participating peers.
IPSec provides these security services at the IP-layer; it uses Internet Key Exchange
(IKE) to handle the negotiation of protocols and algorithms based on local policy
and to generate the encryption and authentication keys to be used by IPSec. In fact,
IPSec can be used to protect one or more data ﬂows between a pair of hosts,
between a pair of security Gateways, or between a security Gateway and a host.
3.6.1.2
Mobile Transmissions Over IP (MToIP)
The IP data link can be used for transmissions such as regularly made long-distance
phone calls, videoconferencing connections, or sending fax messages. In such a
way, IP telephony is known as a Voice over IP (VoIP), while similar to this,
Videophone can also be established over IP (VPoIP) and fax over IP (FoIP).
Actually, these services are the transmission of telephone, video, or fax calls over a
data network like one of the many terrestrial networks that make up the Internet or
will be possible through Mobile Satellite Internet (MSI) as future MSC standards.
On the other hand, a VoIP application meets the challenges of combining legacy
voice networks and packet networks by allowing both voice and signaling infor-
mation to be transported over the packet network. A FoIP application enables the
networking of standard fax machines with packet networks. It accomplishes this by
extracting the fax image from an analog signal and carrying it as digital data over
the packet network. The VPoIP mode is a similar application, which can enable the
mobile and semi-ﬁxed networking of standard video cameras, videoconferencing,
or videophones with mobile packet network or via mobile ISDN links.
However, the TDM over IP (TDMoIP) is a transport technology that extends T1,
E1, T3, E3, serial data, or analog voice circuits transparently across IP or Ethernet
networks. When used for voice mode, these TDM over IP circuits are transparent to
signaling and provide superior voice quality with much lower latency than
VoIP. The TDM scheme over IP supports all PBX features and all modem and fax
rates. In other words, TDMoIP is not limited to voice and can extend to circuits
carrying any protocol over IP including Frame Relay, ATM, ISDN, SS7, SNA,
HDLC, Asynchronic, Synchronic, and X.25, as well as H.320 and H.324 video over
IP (VPoIP). The TDM scheme over IP was recently developed by the RAD
Company to provide a simple, inexpensive migration strategy to IP-based networks.

3.6.1.3
Mobile IP Version 6 (MIPv6)
The IP was introduced in the Arpanet in the mid-1970s; thus, the version in
common used today is IP version 4 (IPv4). Although several protocol suites
(including Open System Interconnection) have been proposed over the years to
replace IPv4, none have succeeded because of IPv4’s large and continually
growing, installed base.
Nevertheless, IPv4 was never intended for the current Internet, either in terms of
the number of hosts, types of applications, or security concerns. However, in the
early 1990s, IETF recognized that the only way to cope with these changes was to
design a new version of IP as a successor to IPv4. In such a way, the IETF formed
the next IP generation (IPgen) Working Group to deﬁne this transitional protocol to
ensure long-term compatibility between the current and new IP versions and sup-
port for current and emerging IP-based applications.
The result of this effort was IP version 6 (IPv6), described in RFC 1883–1886;
these four RFC were ofﬁcially entered into the Internet Standard Track in December
1995. IPv6 is designed as an evolution from IPv4 rather than as a radical change.
Useful features of IPv4 were carried over in IPv6 and less useful features were
dropped. Mobile IPv6 is an IP-layer mobility protocol for the IPv6 Internet, being
standardized by the IETF. Thus, the idea is that when mobility, like any other
functionality, is implemented in the network layer, it needs to be implemented only
once and will then be transparently available for all higher layer protocols. It
remains to be seen how well this promise is fulﬁlled in practice. There are, however,
some applications such as mobile VPN access, for which Mobile IP is clearly a
good solution.
The mobile network is conﬁgured in the way that the ﬁrst half of an IPv6 address
indicates the subnet to which the address belongs and it is used for routing IP
packets across the Internet. When a mobile Internet host, known as a mobile node
(MN) in the Mobile IPv6 terminology, moves to a different place in the network
topology, its subnet and IP address necessarily change. This creates two kinds of
problems: existing connections (e.g., TCP connections and IPSec security associ-
ations) between the mobile and other hosts known as a correspondent nodes (CN)s
become invalid and the mobile is no longer reachable at its old address for new
connections. The former problem is important in stateful protocols and has little
effect on stateless protocols, such as Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP). The latter
problem typically concerns servers and not client computers.
Mobile IPv6 protocol has two basic goals: All transport-layer and higher layer
connections and security associations between the mobile and its correspondents
should survive the address change, and the mobile host should be reachable as long
as it is connected to the Internet somewhere in the world. Mobile IP makes some
quite strong assumptions about the environments in which it is used. First, that all
mobile hosts have a home network and a Home Address (HoA) on that network.
This is a reﬂection from a time when mobility was an exception: Few Internet
nodes would be mobile and even they would for most of the time remains stationary
at home.

In any case, Mobile IP solves the reachability problem by ensuring that the
mobile is always able to receive packets sent to its home address. The IP address of
a stationary IP node normally serves two purposes: It is both an identiﬁer for the
node and an address that is used for routing messages to the node. Mobile IP
preserves this dual use of home addresses, which are an identiﬁer for the mobile, as
well as an address to which correspondents can send packets.
The mobile’s current location, called Care-of Address (CoA), on the other hand,
is a pure address and serves no identiﬁcation purposes. Any IPv6 address can be or
become mobile, and there is no way of distinguishing a mobile and stationary host
by just looking at its address. This is because the Mobile IP protocol was originally
designed to be transparent to the mobile’s correspondents, and the correspondent
did not need to know that the mobile, in fact, was a mobile.
An additional technical advantage in the adoption of the MIPv6 IP solution as a
ﬁnal stage of standardization should be determined to provide the opportunity to
perform seamless communications handover between satellite and TTN. Recent
trials involving handover between TTN using MIPv6 have demonstrated the fea-
sibility of such an approach. At any rate, researchers are now addressing the needs
of integrated space/terrestrial mobile communication networks, based upon packet-
oriented service delivery.
3.6.2
Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
The transmission of Internet packets in Tx-Rx direction is primarily achieved using
the TCP solution. The TCP mode is a connection-oriented transport protocol that
sends data as an unstructured stream of bytes and provides the functionality to
ensure that the transmission rate of data over the network is appropriate for the
capabilities of the Rx device, as well as the devices that are used to route the data
from the Tx to the Rx. Thus, by using sequence numbers and acknowledgment
messages, TCP can provide a sending node with delivery information about packets
transmitted to a destination node. Where data has been lost in transit from source to
destination, TCP can retransmit the data until either a time-out condition is reached
or until successful delivery has been achieved or can also recognize duplicate
messages and will discard them appropriately.
If the sending PC is transmitting too fast for the receiving computer, TCP can
employ ﬂow control mechanisms to slow data transfer. The TCP method can also
communicate delivery information to the upper-layer protocols and the applications
it supports and is responsible for ensuring that the network’s resources are divided
in an equitable manner among all users of the network. Applications such as ﬁle
transfer protocol (FTP) and HTTP (the language of the Web) rely on TCP to
transport their data over the network as quickly as the network will allow.

3.6.2.1
TCP/IP Over Satellite
As far a TCP/IP connection is concerned, a mobile satellite network should be
viewed as any other network connection. Given the way that TCP operates, the
transmission of IP packets over the MSC link poses several problems that need to
be overcome if services are to be delivered efﬁciently. In such a manner, the major
difﬁculty is due to the latency of the satellite link, which when combined with a
burst error channel and the characteristics of the TCP protocol itself can result in an
inefﬁcient means of transmission. This is because TCP operates using a conser-
vative congestion control mechanism, whereby new data can be transmitted only
when an ACK (acknowledgment) from the previous transmission has been
received.
Therefore, with this in mind, the need for a high-quality link between the satellite
and MES is re-emphasized, since packets in error are presently deemed to be due to
congestion on the satellite network. Hence, in this case, TCP responds by reducing
its transmission rate accordingly. It can be seen that TCP operates on the basis of
“best effort,” founded on the available resources of the network.
When starting transmission, TCP enters the network in a restrained manner,
whereby the initial rate of transmission is carefully controlled to avoid overloading
the network with trafﬁc. The TCP method achieves this by employing a congestion
control mechanism such as slow start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit, and
recovery.
Slow start is used, as its name suggests, at the start of transmission or after
congestion of the network has been detected and the data transmission is reduced.
On the other hand, congestion control is used to gradually increase the transmission
rate once the initial data rate has been ramped-up using the slow start algorithms. In
this sense, the fast transmit and fast recovery algorithms are used to speed up the
recovery of the transmission rate after signiﬁcant congestion in the communication
network has been detected.
3.6.2.2
TCP Intertwined Algorithms
Modern implementations of TCP contain four intertwined algorithms that have
never been fully documented as Internet control mechanism standards, such as slow
start, congestion avoidance, fast retransmit (FRet), and fast recovery (FRec).
1. Slow Start—The old TCP mode would start a connection with the sender
injecting multiple segments into the network, up to the window size advertised
by the receiver. While this works when the two hosts are on the same LAN, if
there are routers and slower links between the sender and the receiver, problems
can arise. Some intermediate router must queue the packets and it is possible for
that router to run out of space. Hence, the algorithm to avoid this is called slow
start. It operates by observing that the rate at which new packets should be
3.6
Mobile Broadband and Internet Protocols
279

injected into the network is the rate at which the acknowledgments are returned
by the other end.
Slow start adds a window to the sender’s TCP known as Congestion Window
(CWnd), which is initialized to one segment when a new connection is established
with a host on another network. Each time an ACK is received, the CWnd is
increased by one segment. The Receiver Advertised Window (RWnd) is the
maximum amount of data that can be buffered at the receiver, which is determined
by the minimum of CWnd and RWnd and ensuring that the Rx is not overloaded
with data. The sender can transmit up to the minimum of the CWnd and the RWnd.
The CWnd is ﬂow control imposed by the sender, while the RWnd is ﬂow control
imposed by the Rx. The former is based on the sender’s assessment of perceived
network congestion; the latter is related to the amount of available buffer space at
the Rx for this connection. The sender starts by transmitting one segment and
waiting for its ACK. When that ACK is received, the CWnd is incremented from
one to two and two segments can be sent. When each of those two segments is
acknowledged, the CWnd is increased to four. This provides an exponential growth,
although it is not exactly exponential because the receiver may delay its ACK,
typically sending one ACK for every two segments that it receives. At some point,
the capacity of the Internet may be reached, and an intermediate routers will start
discarding packets. This tells the sender that its congestion window has become too
large. However, it can be seen that after transmitting the ﬁrst segment, the data
sender remains idle until an ACK message has been received. For a GEO satellite,
this would take in the region of roughly 500–570 ms.
2. Congestion Avoidance—Congestion can occur when data arrives on a big pipe
(a fast LAN) and gets sent out via a smaller pipe (a slower WAN). It can also
occur when multiple input streams arrive at a router whose output capacity is
less than the sum of the inputs. Therefore, congestion avoidance is a way to deal
with lost packets of data. The assumption of the algorithm is that packet loss
caused by damage is very small (much less than 1 %); therefore, the loss of a
packet signals congestion somewhere in the network between the source and
destination. There are two indications of packet loss: a time-out occurring and
the receipt of duplicate ACK.
The congestion avoidance and slow start are independent algorithms with dif-
ferent objectives. But when congestion occurs, TCP must slow down its trans-
mission rate of packets into the network and then invoke slow start to get things
going again. Hence, in practice, they are implemented together. They require that
two variables be maintained for each connection: a CWnd and a Slow Start
Threshold (SSThres) size. If CWnd is less than or equal to SSThres, TCP is in slow
start, while TCP is performing congestion avoidance. Slow start continues until
TCP is halfway to where it was when congestion occurred and then congestion
avoidance takes over. Slow start has CWnd begin at one segment and be incre-
mented by one segment every time an ACK is received.

Transmission Techniques

3. Fast Retransmit—Before describing the change, realize that TCP may generate
an immediate ACK (a duplicate ACK) when an out-of-order segment is
received, with a note that one reason for doing so was for the experimental fast
retransmit algorithm. Thus, this duplicate ACK should not be delayed, and the
purpose is to let the other end know that a segment was received out of order
and to tell it what sequence number is expected. Since TCP mode does not know
whether a duplicate ACK is caused by a lost segment or just a reordering of
segments, it waits for a small number of duplicate ACK to be received. It is
assumed that if there is just a reordering of the segments, there will be only one
or two duplicate ACK before the reordered segment is processed, which will
then generate a new ACK. If three or more duplicate ACK are received in a row,
it is a strong indication that a segment has been lost. The TCP mode then
performs a retransmission of what appears to be the missing segment, without
waiting for a retransmission timer to expire.
4. Fast Recovery—After fast retransmit sends what appears to be the missing
segment, the congestion avoidance but not slow start is performed. That is to
say, this is practically the fast recovery algorithm. It is an improvement that
allows high throughput under moderate congestion, especially for large win-
dows. The reason for not performing slow start in this case is that the receipt of
the duplicate ACK tells TCP that more than just a packet has been lost. Since the
receiver can only generate the duplicate ACK when another segment is received,
that segment has left the network and is in the receiver’s buffer. That is, there is
still data ﬂowing between the two ends and TCP does not want to reduce the
ﬂow abruptly by going into slow start.
3.6.3
Mobile Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM)
The ATM solution is a network switching technology used by Broadband
Integrated Service Digital Network (BISDN). It uses a technique called cell
switching, breaking all data into cells, or packets and transmits them from one
location on the network to another, connected by switches. So, the small, constant
cell size allows ATM equipment to transmit audio, video, and computer data over
the same network and assure that no single type of data hogs the line.
The latest implementations of ATM support data transfer rates from 25 to
622 Mb/s, which compares to a maximum of 100 Mb/s for Ethernet. It is a protocol
designed to handle isochronous (time critical) data such as video and telephony
(audio), in addition to more conventional data communications between computers.
These protocols are capable of providing a homogeneous network for all trafﬁc
types.
The same protocols are used regardless of whether the application is to carry
conventional telephony (VoIP), fax over IP (FoIP), entertainment video over IP
(VPoIP), or computer network trafﬁc over LAN, MAN, WAN, or satellite networks.
3.6
Mobile Broadband and Internet Protocols
281

Small and constant packet size allows switching to be implemented in hardware,
rather than have routing done in the software. This makes ATM switches sufﬁ-
ciently rapid that multiple isochronous data can be statistically multiplexed toge-
ther. The signiﬁcance of this is that ATM protocols provide bandwidth on demand.
Network management software will allow small amounts of bandwidth to be set
aside for simple transactions, such as e-mails, while allowing more bandwidth for
resource intensive multimedia applications. This sort of technology means that a
level of bandwidth can be guaranteed and that a connection is not delayed or
interrupted by network trafﬁc, which in ATM parlance is known as QoS.
The ATM transport protocol is universal since it can be used for all kinds of
networks be it physical networks, (twisted pair, coax, and ﬁber optics) or virtual
networks, such as radio and satellite systems. Today’s emphasis on multimedia
presentations, videoconferencing, remote lecturing, etc., has made ATM more
attractive to network administrators. Simply throwing more bandwidth onto the
network is not the solution to the problem, since not all demands on the network are
equal. The ATM’s ability to provide the bandwidth and QoS guarantees makes it
the obvious upgrade choice. Other areas where ATM is used include Digital TV,
HDTV, and video vending. A public ATM network would offer some entirely new
services to people in their homes. The most signiﬁcant type of new services will be
the possible video services. What will be so unique about these services is the
opportunity for a viewer to interact more with the programs they receive. At this
point, the use of the ATM solution would reduce costs considerably, making ATM
a very attractive technology for mobile applications, such as oil companies, ship-
ping, and airlines. Many designers of satellite systems are thinking about imple-
menting the ATM protocol, which transmits data that have been placed in cells of a
constant length (53 bytes).
Thus, the ATM guarantees data transmission at a rate ranging between 2 Mb/s
and 2.4 Gb/s. The protocol acts on the principle that a virtual channel should be set
up between two points whenever such a need appears. This is what makes the ATM
protocol different from the TCP/IP protocol, in which messages are transmitted in
packet form, where each packet may reach the recipient via a different route.
The ATM protocol enables data transmission through various media. Taking into
account the header of the cell (cell-tax), which takes 5 bytes, the application of the
ATM protocol may not appear to be so cost-effective when the rate of transmission
is low and the capacity of the link (e.g., in two-way modem channels) becomes a
basic limitation.
As noted, the ATM technology is expected to provide QoS-based networks that
support voice, video, and data applications. Initially, the ATM protocol was orig-
inally designed for ﬁber-based terrestrial networks that exhibit low latencies and
error rates. With the increasing demand for electronic connectivity across the world,
satellite networks play an indispensable role in the deployment of global networks.
The Ka-band communication link using the GHz frequency satellites spectrum can
reach user terminals across most of the populated world. Thus, the ATM-based
satellite networks can effectively provide real-time as well as non-real-time com-
munications services to remote areas.
282

Transmission Techniques

There are four different types of ATM service.
1. Constant Bit Rate (CBR)—The CBR ATM service speciﬁes a ﬁxed bit rate so
that data is sent in a steady stream. This is analogous to a leased line.
2. Variable Bit Rate (VBR)—This ATM service provides a speciﬁed throughput
capacity but data is not sent evenly. This is a popular choice for voice and
videoconferencing data.
3. Unspeciﬁed/Undeﬁned Bit Rate (UBR)—It does not guarantee any throughput
levels. This is used for applications, such as ﬁle transfer, that can tolerate delays.
4. Available Bit Rate (ABR)—It provides a guaranteed minimum capacity but
allows data to be burst at higher capacities when the network is free.
However, there is opinion that ATM holds the answer to the Internet bandwidth
problem, but others are skeptical. Thus, ATM creates a ﬁxed channel, or route,
between two points whenever a data transfer begins. This differs from TCP/IP, in
which messages are divided into packets and each packet can take a different route
from source to destination. This difference makes it easier to track and bill data
usage across an ATM.
3.6.3.1
IP/ATM Over Satellite
As mentioned, the ATM terrestrial technology can be successfully used in satellite
communication networks to enhance the overall performance of the network. This
network as usual can comprise corresponding satellite conﬁguration and several
ground stations communicating via satellite on the one hand and ATM Switch TTN
infrastructure on the other, interconnected with the main component of the network,
known as ATM Satellite Internetworking Unit (ASIU). The ASIU is responsible for
management and control of system resources as well as the overall system
administrative functions, such as real-time bandwidth allocation, network access
control, system timing, and trafﬁc control. This ﬁxed satellite conﬁguration can be
very easily implemented in MSC with connecting MES terminals via satellite with
LES and ASIU to the ATM Switching TTN.
The internal architecture of the ASIU in the satellite direction stage is to extract
the ATM cells from the various transport methods. After the ATM cells are
extracted, they are error corrected and then buffered according to their type. After
that, the cells are encoded and transmitted through the modem to the satellite.
Hence, looking at the various components in a bit more detail, the ﬁrst stage will be
the extraction of ATM cells from the transport protocols, using the following
methods:
1. Plesiochronous Digital Hierarchy (PDH)—The PDH protocol was developed
to carry digitized voice efﬁciently. At any rate, it mainly operates by multi-
plexing various rates of bit streams at the highest allowed clock speed. When
necessary, it adds a stufﬁng bit which the demultiplexer can later remove, and
3.6
Mobile Broadband and Internet Protocols
283

therefore, the stufﬁng procedure is inefﬁcient. Also, rerouting signals after
network failures and managing remote network elements are extremely difﬁcult.
2. Physical Layer Convergence Protocol (PLCP)—On the other hand, PLCP
mode works differently. The PLCP combines 12 ATM cells in one frame format
with a header in front. Consequently, this method is not very good for satellite
transmission as it is very sensitive to burst errors, which may result in the loss of
a whole frame and loss of synchronization of the PLCP device.
3. Synchronous Optical Network (SONET) or Synchronous Digital Hierarchy
(SDH)—For the reasons already explained, PDH and PLCP are not suitable to
be used with ATM and engineers have been turning to SDH as the protocol for
ATM. The SONET, similar to the SDH protocol, uses pointer bytes to indicate
the location of the ﬁrst byte in the payload of the SDH frame. Thus, the SDH
protocol incorporates a cell delineation mechanism for the acquisition and
synchronization of the ATM cells on the receiver side of the network and has
some considerable advantages over PDH/PLCP, the main being ﬂexibility of
service, allowing the network operator to respond quickly to customers’
requirements, improved quality and supervision, permitting the operator to
increase the quality of the offered services.
Furthermore, the SDH protocol reduces operations costs, by using efﬁcient
network management technology, which makes the remote control of the network
possible mostly without on-site activities. Then, the higher rates of transfer are well
deﬁned and direct multiplexing is possible without an intermediate multiplexing
stage. In fact, despite these advantages, SDH has an important problem in that
incorrect pointer detection may produce an incorrect payload extraction and an error
block. As a result, all received blocks may be incorrect and severely errored. To
overcome this problem, an efﬁcient error mechanism, error detection, and recovery
must be used in the next stage of the ASIU architecture.
However, satellite systems have several inherent constraints. The resources of
the satellite network, especially the satellite and the Earth station, are expensive and
typically have low redundancy; these must be robust and be used efﬁciently. Thus,
the large delays in GEO and delay variations in LEO systems affect both real-time
and non-real-time applications. In an acknowledgment and time-out-based con-
gestion control mechanism (like TCP), performance is inherently related to the
delay–bandwidth product of the connection. Moreover, TCP round-trip time
(RTT) measurements are sensitive to delay variations that may cause false timeouts
and retransmissions. As a result, the congestion control issues for broadband
satellite networks are somewhat different from those of low-latency terrestrial
networks. Both interoperability issues as well as performance issues need to be
addressed before a transport-layer protocol like the TCP model can satisfactorily
work over long latency satellite ATM networks.
Satellite ATM networks can be used to provide broadband access to remote
locations, as well as to serve as an alternative to ﬁber-based backbone networks. In
either case, a single satellite is designed to support thousands of Earth terminals.
284
3
Transmission Techniques

The Earth terminals set up virtual channels (VC) through the onboard satellite
switches to transfer ATM cells among one another.
Because of the limited capacity of a satellite switch, each MES has a limited
number of VC it can use for TCP/IP data transport. In backbone networks, these
MES are IP/ATM edge devices that terminate ATM connections and route IP trafﬁc
in and out of the ATM network. Namely, these high-capacity backbone routers
must handle thousands of simultaneous IP ﬂows. As a result, the routers must be
able to aggregate multiple IP ﬂows onto individual VC. Flow classiﬁcation may be
done by means of a QoS that can use IP source–destination address pairs, as well as
transport-layer port numbers. Therefore, the QoS manager can further classify IP
packets into ﬂows based on the differentiated services code points in the TOS byte
of the IP header.
In addition to ﬂow and VC management, all MES terminals also provide a
means for congestion control between the IP and ATM networks. The onboard
ATM switches must perform trafﬁc management at the cell and VC levels. Hence,
TCP hosts implement various TCP ﬂow and congestion control mechanisms for
effective network bandwidth utilization. The enhancements that perform intelligent
buffer management policies at the switches can be developed for UBR service to
improve transport-layer throughput and fairness. A policy for selective cell drop
based on per-VC accounting can be used to improve fairness.
Providing a minimum guaranteed rate (GR) to UBR trafﬁc has been discussed as
possible candidate to improve TCP performance over UBR. The goal of providing
GR is to protect the UBR service category from total bandwidth starvation and
provide a continuous minimum bandwidth guarantee. It has been shown that in the
presence of high loads of higher priority constant bit rate (CBR), variable bit rate
(VBR), and available bit rate (ABR) trafﬁc, TCP congestion control mechanisms
beneﬁt from a minimum GR.
Moreover, guaranteed frame rate (GFR) has recently been proposed in the ATM
Forum as an enhancement to the UBR service category. GFR will provide a
minimum rate guarantee to VC at the frame level.
The GFR service also allows for the fair usage of any extra network bandwidth.
GFR is likely to be used by applications that can neither specify the trafﬁc
parameters needed for a VBR VC, nor have the capability for ABR (for rate-based
feedback control). Current Internetworking applications fall into this category and
are not designed to run over QoS-based networks. Routers separated by satellite
ATM networks can use the GFR service to establish VC between one another. GFR
can be implemented using per-VC queuing or buffer management.
3.6.3.2
UBR Over Satellite
The Unspeciﬁed Bit Rate (UBR) service class is intended for delay-tolerant or
non-real-time applications, that is, those that do not require tightly constrained
delay and delay variation, such as traditional computer communications applica-
tions. Sources are expected to transmit non-continuous bursts of cells. Namely, the
3.6
Mobile Broadband and Internet Protocols
285

UBR service supports a high degree of statistical multiplexing among sources and
includes no notion of a per-VC allocated bandwidth resource. Thus, transport of
cells in UBR service is not necessarily guaranteed by mechanisms operating at the
cell level. However, it is expected that resources will be provisioned for UBR
service in such a way as to make it usable for some sets of applications. The UBR
service may be considered as an interpretation of the common term “best effort
service.” The UBR service is typically used for data transmission applications such
as ﬁle transfer and e-mail. Neither an ATM-attached router nor an ATM switch
provides trafﬁc or QoS guarantees to a UBR virtual circuit.
As a result, UBR VC can experience a large number of cell drops or a high cell
transfer delay as cells move from the source to the destination device. In its simplest
form, an ATM switch implements a tail drop policy for the UBR service category.
Hence, if cells are dropped, the TCP source loses time waiting for the retrans-
mission timeout. Even though TCP congestion mechanisms effectively recover
from loss, the link efﬁciency can be very low, especially for large delay–bandwidth
networks. In general, link efﬁciency typically increases with increasing buffer size.
In fact, the performance of TCP over UBR can be improved by using buffer
management policies. In addition, TCP performance is also affected by TCP con-
gestion control mechanisms and TCP parameters such as segment size, timer
granularity, receiver window size, slow start threshold, and initial window size.
The TCP Reno implements the fast retransmit and recovery algorithms that
enable the connection to quickly recover from isolated segment losses. However,
fast retransmit and recovery cannot efﬁciently recover from multiple packet losses
within the same window. A modiﬁcation to Reno TCP is proposed, so that the
sender can recover from multiple packet losses without having to timeout. The TCP
solutions with selective acknowledgment (SACK) are designed to efﬁciently
recover from multiple segment losses. With SACK, the sender can recover from
multiple dropped segments in about one round trip. The studies show that in
low-delay networks, the effect of network-based buffer management policies is very
important and can dominate the effect of SACK. The throughput improvement
provided by SACK is very signiﬁcant for long latency connections. When the
propagation delay is large, time-out results in the loss of a signiﬁcant amount of
time during slow start from a window of one segment.
Reno TCP (with fast retransmit and recovery) results in the worst performance
(for multiple packet losses) because time-out occurs at a much lower window than
in Vanilla TCP. With SACK TCP, a time-out is avoided most of the time and
recovery is complete within a small number of round trips. The NewReno modi-
ﬁcation to the fast retransmit and fast recovery algorithms (TCP Reno) has been
therefore proposed to counteract multiple packet drops where the SACK option is
not available. For lower delay satellite networks (LEO), both NewReno and
SACK TCP provide high throughput but as the latency increases, SACK signiﬁ-
cantly outperforms NewReno, Reno, and Vanilla.

3.6.3.3
ABR Over Satellite
The ABR service category is another option to implement TCP/IP over ATM. This
service category is speciﬁed by a Peak Cell Rate (PCR) and a Minimum Cell Rate
(MCR), which is guaranteed by the network. ABR connections use a rate-based
closed-loop end-to-end feedback control mechanism for congestion control. The
network tries to maintain a low cell loss ratio by changing the Allowed Cell Rate
(ACR) at which a source can send. Switches can also use the virtual source/virtual
destination (VS/VD) feature to segment the ABR control loop into smaller loops.
Studies have indicated that ABR with VS/VD can effectively reduce the buffer
requirement for TCP over ATM, especially for long delay paths. In addition to
network-based drop policies, end-to-end ﬂow control and congestion control
policies can be effective in improving TCP performance over UBR. The fast
retransmit and recovery mechanism can be used in addition to slow start and
congestion avoidance to quickly recover from isolated segment losses. Otherwise,
the SACK option has been proposed to recover quickly from multiple segment
losses.
The TCP performance over ABR service is important for the satellite IP net-
work. Namely, a key ABR feature, VS/VD, highlights its relevance to long delay
paths. Most of the consideration assumes that the switches implement a rate-based
switch algorithm such as ERICA+. Credit-based congestion control for satellite
networks has also been suggested, in long-latency satellite conﬁgurations; therefore,
the feedback delay is the dominant factor in determining the maximum queue
length. A feedback delay of 10 ms corresponds to about 3670 cells (at OC-3) of
queue for TCP over ERICA+, while a feedback delay of 550 ms corresponds to
201,850 cells. This indicates that satellite switches need to provide at least one
feedback delay of buffering to avoid loss on these high delay paths. A point to
consider is that these large queues should not be seen in downstream workgroup or
WAN switches, because they will not provide as much buffering. Satellite switches
can isolate downstream switches from such large queues by implementing the
VS/VD option, while VS/VD can effectively isolate nodes in different VS/VD
loops. As a result, the buffer requirements of a node are bound by the feedback
delay–bandwidth product of the upstream VS/VD loop. At this point, VS/VD helps
to reduce the buffer requirements of terrestrial switches connected to Gateway
terminals. The feedback delay–bandwidth products of the satellite hop are about
160,000 cells and dominates the feedback delay–bandwidth product of the terres-
trial hop (about 3000 cells). Without VS/VD, terrestrial switch S, a bottleneck, must
buffer cells up to the feedback delay–bandwidth product of the entire control loop
(including the satellite hop). With a VS/VD loop between the satellite and the
terrestrial switch, the queue accumulation due to the satellite feedback delay is
conﬁned to the satellite switch. The terrestrial switch only buffers cells that are
accumulated due to the feedback delay of the terrestrial link to the satellite switch.

Fixed Digital Video Broadcasting-Return Channel
via Satellite (DVB-RCS)
According to a recent Satellite Industry Association’s report, over 130 M direct
satellite TV subscribers are spread around the world. The key enablers attributed to
this success include modern satellite systems capable of powerful transmissions over
vast expanses, efﬁcient transmission, highly integrated, low-cost receiver systems,
and a vast variety of rich content at an affordable price. Current audio and video
compression techniques dwell speciﬁcally on the MPEG multimedia standards,
which constitute the industry’s standards for compression and transport. At this
point, a majority of direct broadcast satellite systems beaming standard-deﬁnition
TV (SDTV) either use or can support the MPEG-2 standard, while HDTV and
multimedia broadcast systems rely ﬁrmly on the standard’s upgraded version,
MPEG-4 mode. However, in last two decades is implemented the new standard of
DVB-RCS system.
To encourage mass-scale acceptance, regulatory bodies promote standardization
of the satellite broadcast service. At this point, ITU recognizes at least six direct-to
home (DTH) broadcast systems that encompass television, data, and multimedia.
Modern satellite and handheld receiver technologies enable television and radio
broadcasts to handheld and portable personal devices. In the meantime, numerous
commercial systems that offer sound and television services to the individual and
groups have emerged in the last decade. The ﬁnal developments of this technique
offers the new personal and mobile solutions that will be in the future recognized as
Digital
Video
Broadcast–Satellite
Personal
(DVB-SP)
and
Digital
Video
Broadcast–Satellite Mobile (DVB-SM) standards, both of which support com-
mercial mobile television services.
The major development in satellite broadcasting technology was the standard-
ization of the DVB-RCS, which allows the users within direct broadcast terrestrial
network (DVB-T) to communicate directly with the broadcast satellite network
(DVB-S) through an assigned return channel. The DVB-T cell can be comprised by
UMTS/GPRS, ISDN, B-ISDN, and ATM broadband networks, and the DVB-S
cells may include rural, consumer broadcasting SoHo/SME LAN, Corporate WAN,
and multicasting networks. This greatly simpliﬁes the overall network architecture
and associated network management procedures, in that now all kind of commu-
nication solutions takes place over the same access network. Thus, the DVB-RCS
system has been speciﬁed for indoor use only, so can be envisaged that very soon,
research and standardization efforts will be directed toward establishing a suitable
mobile standards. Will be enough to develop corresponding mobile satellite
antenna, and this could open up signiﬁcant new opportunities in the mobile satellite
sector.
A sample of ﬁxed DVB-RCS system is depicted in Fig. 3.29. The DVB-RCS
network enables via HUB as a GES with C-, Ku-, or Ka-band antenna to interface
the TTN (DVB-T) cell via corresponding GEO satellite connections (C-, Ku-, or

The HUB terminal supports existing DVB-RCS compliant forward link system
(FLS) and provides all the ground required interfaces and management functions
necessary to set up a DVB-RCS service over 100 Mb/s downstreams. The HUB
operator can interface DVB-RCS terminals to a terrestrial network or service pro-
vider and manage all the operational aspects of the system. The HUB station design

optimized for robustness and stability in operations and can be delivered in a
number of different conﬁgurations to suit customer precise applications. Its archi-
tecture is also designed to accommodate upgrades and expansions of DVB-RCS
network and offer to DVB-RCS providers a choice of C-, Ku-, or Ka-band antenna
and RF equipment, so one ordinary DVB-RCS conﬁguration can handle 1–10
forward link transmitters and from one to several hundred return link receivers
The DVB-RCS FIT for rack mounting is composed by outdoor unit (ODU) of
antenna and indoor satellite unit (ISU) of remote transceiver to provide the most
attractive and reliable DVB solutions and ensures full compatibility with any
DVB-RCS system or VSAT modem, ETSI/CE approval. The DVB-RCS remote is
desktop terminals and router that provide two-way IP communications via satellite
at C-, Ku-, and Ka-band frequencies.
These terminals for corporations, institutions, home ofﬁces, and householders
offer an open-interface for high-capacity broadband access that bypasses the “last
mile” bottleneck associated with terrestrial infrastructure. Therefore, DVB-RCS
system offers broadband access to core IP networks using standard technologies
such as DVB-RCS, DVB-S, latest DVB-S2, and IP interfacing DVB-T with ﬁxed
and mobile user terminals.
In such a way, the broadband network delivers two-way IP connectivity both
between user terminals in the satellite system and between user terminals and the
terrestrial network coming in a scalable choice of performance with a range of data
IP throughputs from 4 to 30 Mb/s.
The broadcast MPEG2/DVB-S service is available in one-way (unidirectional)
from the HUB to the users terminals. With very low cost per bit, service prices
become comparable to those offered by terrestrial networks and can be delivered
where other technologies cannot reach. This network can provide solutions in vas
variety of user segments, such as enterprises and private networks, broadcasting and
content distribution (BCD), satellite news gathering, satellite emergency and
security management, and defense information management.

Mobile Digital Video Broadcasting-Return Channel
Over Satellite (DVB-RCS)
The convergence of MSC and Internet technique has opened many opportunities to
deliver new multimedia service over hybrid satellite systems to MES. The inter-
active nature of the Internet has paved the way for new-generation MSS to support
interactivity. Apart from the convergence between mobile and Internet technolo-
gies, the other major technical driver is the convergence between mobile and ﬁxed
technologies.
By supplementing broadcasting systems with a narrowband uplink, new inter-
active services can be facilitated in DVB and DAB solutions. This is foreseen for
ﬁxed network operation and could equally be adopted onto a mobile network such
290

as the UMTS, thus demonstrating the concept of convergence of personal and
mobile communications, Internet, and broadcasting technology.
A conﬁguration of mobile DVB-RCS system shown in Fig. 3.30 is designed by
author in 2000. The DVB-RCS mobile network includes an HUB as a GES with C-,
Ku-, or Ka-band antenna to interface the TTN (DVB-T) cell via corresponding
satellite connections (C-, Ku-, or Ka-band GEO) to the Mobile Interactive
Terminals (MIT) or Remote (DVB-S) cells for the following services: maritime and
offshore installations, land (road and rail) solutions, and aeronautical service. This
infrastructure is the best solution for establishment a network for connection of all
seaports or airports in one hypothetical country or region. In any case, however, the
modern aeronautical DVB-RCS network is the most reliable communication link
between aircraft and airports for commercial and security purposes.

MPEG Multimedia Standards
The encoding of both high-ﬁdelity (non-speech) audio signals and video signals
today is dominated by the standards deﬁned by the International Standards
Organization (ISO) MPEG, subsequently adopted by both the ISO/IEC and the
ITU. The ﬁrst standard, MPEG-1, “Coding of moving pictures and associated audio

291

for digital storage media at up to about 1.5 Mb/s,” issued in 1992, and its successor
MPEG-2, “Generic coding of moving pictures and associated audio information,”
issued in 1994, deﬁne generic coding for both moving pictures (i.e., video) and
associated audio information.
Work on an MPEG-3 standard was discontinued. More recently, MPEG-4 pri-
marily focuses on new functionality, but also includes improved compression
algorithms, and for the ﬁrst time includes speech compression algorithms, such as
CELP. Each standard comprises a number of parts; for example, MPEG-4 has 23
parts, each of which focuses on a particular aspect of the encoding (video, audio,
data encapsulation, etc.). Signiﬁcantly, MPEG standards only deﬁne in detail the
source decoder, providing a toolbox of algorithms, and standardized bit stream
formats. Detailed encoder architecture is typically not deﬁned (although example
implementations are given), thereby allowing equipment manufacturers to differ-
entiate their products and ensure compatibility of user’s equipment.
3.7.1
Audio Broadcasting
With reference to the audio broadcasting in general is necessary to be turn attention
to the general audio waveform and in particular to the high-ﬁdelity audio, including
stereo music, multichannel surround-sound content. and speech encoding.
3.7.1.1
MPEG-2 Audio Layer II (MP2) Encoding
MPEG-1 provided for three different types of audio encoding with sampling rates of
32 kHz (kSamples/s), 44.1 and 48 kHz for monophonic (mono), dual mono, and
stereophonic (stereo) channels. MPEG-2 added support for up to ﬁve audio chan-
nels and sampling frequencies down to 16 kHz. Subsequently, MPEG-2 Advanced
Audio Encoding (AAC) added sampling from 8 to 96 kHz with up to 48 audio
channels (and 15 embedded data streams). MPEG-2 audio layer I is the simplest
encoding scheme and is suited for encoded bit rates above 128 kb/s per channel
(Pan 1995). Audio layer II, known as MP2, has an intermediate complexity and is
targeted at bit rates around 128 kb/s. MP2, also known as Musicam, forms the basis
of the Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) system and is incorporated into the DVB
standard.
3.7.1.2
MPEG-2 Audio Layer III (MP3) Encoding
MPEG-2 audio layer III, known as MP3, provides increased compression (or,
alternatively, improved quality at the same data rate) compared with MP2 at the
expense of slightly increased complexity and computational effort. Today, MP3 is
widely used for the storage and distribution of music on personal computers via the
292
3
Transmission Techniques

Internet and for digital satellite broadcasting by 1 worldspace (see Chap. 10). The
MP3 psychoacoustic model uses a ﬁner-frequency resolution than the MP2 poly-
phase quadrature ﬁlter band provides (Pan 1995). MP3 divides the audio spectrum
into 576 frequency bands and processes each band separately. It does this in two
stages. First, the spectrum is divided into the normal 32 bands, using a polyphase
quadrature ﬁlter, in order to ensure compatibility with audio layers I and II. In MP3,
however, each band is further divided into 18 sub-bands using a modiﬁed discrete
cosine transform (MDCT). The MP3 MDCT is a variant of the discrete cosine
transform that reuses a fraction of the data from one sample to the next. We have
learnt in Chap. 8 that following the transformation into the frequency domain,
component frequencies can be allocated bits according to their audibility using the
masking levels in each ﬁlter. We also noted that MP3 exploits interchannel
redundancies, for example, in situations when the same information is transmitted
on both stereo channels. Typically, MP3 permits compression of CD-quality sound
by a factor of –12.
3.7.2
Video Broadcasting
As with audio encoding, the dominant video encoding standards are currently the
MPEG standards, notably MPEG-2 for standard-deﬁnition video and, increasingly,
MPEG-4 for high-deﬁnition video. The MPEG-2 video decoders contain a “tool-
box” of compression algorithms grouped into a number of subsets called “proﬁles.”
Furthermore, proﬁles support a number of levels (combinations of image size,
frame rate, etc.), and decoders may implement a subset of proﬁles.
3.7.2.1
MPEG-2 Video Encoding
The MPEG video encoding algorithms aim to transmit differences between frames
where possible and use a DCT (a form of Fourier transform) to encode the dif-
ference information into the frequency domain, discarding insigniﬁcant high spatial
frequency information that would not normally be noticeable. For this reason, they
are sometimes referred to as hybrid block interframe differential PCM (DPCM)/
discrete cosine transform (DCT) algorithms. A video buffer is used to ensure a
constant bit stream on the user side. Typical bit rates for MPEG-2 encoded
standard-deﬁnition video are in the region of 3–15 Mb/s, which is around 10–50:1
compression achieved over the raw PCM bit rate.
3.7.2.2
High-Deﬁnition TV and MPEG-4
Even greater compression ratios are required for the transmission of high-deﬁnition
TV video. HDTV frame resolutions of up to 1920 × 1080 pixels are in use
3.7
MPEG Multimedia Standards
293

(at 25 Hz)—with up to 5 times as many pixels per frame compared with SDTV.
While MPEG-2 high level can support resolutions of up to 1920 × 1080 (some-
times referred to as full-HD), HDTV generally requires the increased compression
available in MPEG-4 to be viable.
The MPEG-4 Advanced Video Coding (MPEG-4 part 10 AVC), jointly devel-
oped with the ITU Video Coding Experts Group (as H.264), employs additional
techniques to achieve compression ratios greater than those for MPEG-2 and is used
by several satellite services for broadcasting HDTV. MPEG-4 AVC is utilized in
BluRay videodiscs. Speciﬁcally, MPEG-4 AVC utilizes a number of features to
achieve higher compression than MPEG-2. Some of the more signiﬁcant features of
MPEG-4 AVC are as follows:
1. Up to 32 reference pictures, however, may be used for motion compensation,
rather than just 1 (I-Pictures) or 2 (B-Pictures);
2. The macroblock size used for motion compensation may be varied from
16 × 16 to 4 × 4 pixels with subpixel precision, and new 4 × 4 and 16 × 16
pixel block transforms; and
3. Improved nonlinear quantization size control and improved entropy encoding.
3.7.2.3
Multiplexing and Transporting
In Fig. 3.31 is illustrated packetization of encoded video and audio elementary
streams to produce a packetized elementary stream (PES). The PES packets are next
combined with system-level information to form transport streams (TS) or program
streams (PS).
The systems part of the MPEG-2 speciﬁcation (ISO/IEC 13818-1:2000(E))
speciﬁes all syntactical and semantic rules to combine MPEG-2 video and audio
elementary streams (output of an encoder), including other types of data content,
into a single or multiple streams to enable storage or transmission.
The program stream consists of one or more streams of PES packets of common
time base into a single stream. The stream is useful for operation in relatively
error-free environments such as interactive multimedia applications.
Fig. 3.31 MPEG Program and transport streams—Courtesy of Book: by Richharia
294

Transmission Techniques

The transport stream consists of one or more independent programs into a single
stream. This type of stream is useful in error-prone environments as satellite
broadcasts. Packets are 188 bytes in length. Transport stream rates may be ﬁxed or
variable. Values and locations of Program Clock Reference (PCR) ﬁelds deﬁne the
stream rate. The transport stream design is such as to facilitate: retrieval and
decoding of a single program within the transport stream, extraction of only one
more program or contents from a transport stream, and conversion of a program into
a transport stream including recovery at Rx.
Figure 3.32 illustrates the concept of demultiplexing and decoding of a single
program from a received transport scheme containing one or more program streams.
The input stream to the demultiplexer/decoder includes a system layer wrapped
about a compression layer. The system layer facilitates the operation of the
demultiplexer block, and the compression layer assists in video and audio decoding.
Note that, although audio and video decoders are illustrated, these may not always
be necessary when the transport stream carries other classes of data.
3.8
Direct-to-Home Broadcast System
Recognizing the advantages of digital television transmissions, and their potential
to transport HDTV efﬁciently, considerable effort was directed in the 1980s and
1990s (notably in the USA, Europe, and Japan) toward the development of digital
transmission systems, resulting in the design of several terrestrial and satellite
systems. The convergence of computing, telecommunications and broadcast dis-
ciplines led the developers to adapt a generic architecture that would offer a variety
of enabling services in addition to SDTV and HDTV.
Enabling technology and services include a digital video recorder to facilitate
recording of program directly in a digital format, interactivity (e.g., multichannel
display or multiple camera angle displays), receiver-enabled home networking, and
reception onboard mobiles.

Broadcast satellite service (BSS) radio frequency plan of ITU provides a useful
framework with guaranteed availability of spectrum in Ku-band to each member
country, allowing high-power radio transmissions amenable for reception at home
via small non-obtrusive antenna on low-cost receivers. It is necessary to highlight
the technology of the DVB-S2 satellite system, as it incorporates a wide range of
recent technology advances to provide a highly ﬂexible and efﬁcient medium, and
moreover, it is uniquely identiﬁed by the ITU as a broadcast system for digital
satellite broadcasting system with ﬂexible conﬁguration.
3.8.1
Transmission System Architecture
A typical direct-to-home system comprises incoming signals to the uplink facility
from one or more transmission sources, such as a studio, local terrestrial broadcast
signal feed, and prerecorded material. Occasionally, additional material such as
advertisements may be added locally at preagreed points of the incoming program.
The incoming signals are monitored, routed within the facility and, if necessary,
readjusted and synchronized. The prerecorded material is checked for quality,
edited, when necessary, and read into video ﬁle servers to be played at the broadcast
time.
Commercial systems incorporate a facility known as conditional access to
facilitate reception solely by the authorized users. Other functionalities include
additions of service information (SI) and electronic program guide (EPG),
analog-to-digital conversion, compression, multiplexing to create a suitable trans-
port stream, error control, and modulation. The equipment of SI and EPG creates
signals for displaying program-related information, for example, programs title, and
start/end time.
The compression equipment is typically MPEG-2 standard, although migration
to MPEG-4 is endemic because of its tighter encoding. At this point, several
channels are multiplexed to provide a single high-rate channel for transmission. The
stream is FEC mode, modulated and transmitted. The ITU BSS plan recommends
uplink transmissions in the 17.5 GHz band and downlink transmissions to the user
community in the 12.5 GHz band, but their transmission powers are restricted by
the FSS regulations. The BSS satellites are placed in geostationary orbits. The
satellites use transparent transponders capable of transmitting very high powers
through spot and, often, shaped beams to be able to provide the high signal quality
necessary for reception on small DTH receivers.
The DTH receivers typically use a 45–60 cm dish at Ku-band, depending on
satellite EIRP. The relatively high gain of the receive antenna in conjunction with
high-power satellite transmissions provides sufﬁcient link margins to counter rain
fades common in this band.

3.8.2
Generic Reference Integrated Receiver Decoder
(IRD) Model
The indoor unit housing the electronics is known as the integrated receiver decoder
(IRD). The core functions of all the direct-to-home television systems are nominally
identical, and hence, a generic model of the IRD is feasible. Operators may tailor
the remaining functions around these core functional entities. The ITU proposes
reference architecture of the IRD on this premise. The model provides a structured
deﬁnition of functionalities to facilitate a generic receiver design. As observed in the
preceding section, the core functions relate generically to a transmission system.
The additional essential functions relate to the service provision, operation of the
system, and additional or complementary features, which may differ depending on
implementation. These functions and units include a satellite tuner, output inter-
faces, an operating system and applications, EPG, service/system information (SI),
conditional access (CA), a display, a remote control, read-only memory (ROM),
random-access memory (RAM), ﬂash memory, an interactive module, a micro-
controller and units to support teletext, and subtitling.
Software-reconﬁgurable receivers are common as they simplify an upgrade to
the receiver. The upgrade may, for example, become necessary to repair a software
anomaly, add a new functionality, or reconﬁgure receiver subsystems when a new
satellite transponder is deployed. Modern receivers typically include a digital video
recorder permitting users to record a program directly in a digital format, or to store
content, ready for an “instant” video-on-demand display, thereby avoiding the
interactive delay. Often L-band IF signals from a single dish/LNB ﬂow to one or
more receivers in the customer’s home. Home networking systems permit inter-
working between receivers, thereby permitting programs recorded on one set to be
viewed by other sets elsewhere in the house and, in addition, support features such
as security and quality of service management.
3.9
Transmission Standards
The development of digital television has evolved independently around the world,
and hence, several types of transmission system are in use. The majority operates in
the 11/12 GHz downlink band. Being digital, the systems can support numerous
applications and services efﬁciently be it television, multimedia, data services, or
audio. To assist in the selection of an appropriate system, ITU recommends four
systems—system A, system B, system C, and system D.

3.9.1
Digital Video Broadcast Second-Generation (DVB-S2)
Standard
The DVB transmission project, initiated in Europe but subsequently extended
worldwide, deﬁnes digital broadcast standards by consensus among the participants
representing the manufacturing industry, broadcasters, program providers, network
operators, satellite operators, and regulatory bodies. The DVB standards embrace
broadcast transmission technology across all media of cable, terrestrial, and satel-
lite. The DVB-S speciﬁcations were standardized in 1993. A second-generation
speciﬁcation, DVB-S2, was produced in 2003 in response to a growing demand for
more capacity, which was standardized by the European Telecommunication
Standard Institute (ETSI) as EN 302 307 (ETSI Online). In August 2006, the ITU’s
study group on satellite delivery issued a recommendation (BO.1784) that DVB-S2
be the preferred option for a Digital Satellite Broadcasting System with ﬂexible
conﬁguration (television, sound, and data), entitled system E.
The DVB-S standards support up to 12 categories of transmission medium
encompassing a plethora of media contents, among others, standard- and
high-deﬁnition television, radio, and data with or without user interactivity. The
standard includes speciﬁcations for Internet protocol (IP) data, software downloads,
and transmissions to handheld devices. The standards, namely DVB Satellite
(DVB-S),
DVB
Return Channel Satellite (DVB-RCS),
and DVB
Second
Generation (DVB-S2) apply to ﬁxed user terminals. The DVB Satellite Handheld
(DVB-SH) standard, discussed later in the chapter, applies to handheld terminals.
Many parts of the DVB-S speciﬁcations are shared between various transmission
media. The source coding of video and audio and formation of the transport stream
comprises MPEG-2 tailored for satellite systems (MPEG speciﬁcations are too
generic). DVB-S also supports H.264/AVC video and MPEG-4 high-efﬁciency
AAC audio and, additionally, audio formats such as Dolby AC-3 and DTS coded
audio. Guidelines are also available for transporting IP content. The speciﬁcations
support teletext and other data transmitted during the vertical blanking period,
subtitles, graphical elements, service information, etc. DVB-S’s enhanced version,
DVB-S2, is based on three key concepts: 1. best transmission performance; 2. total
ﬂexibility; and 3. reasonable receiver complexity.
The speciﬁcations enable delivery of services that could never have been
delivered by DVB-S. According to the developers, the DVB-S2 standard is not
intended to replace DVB-S in the short term for conventional TV broadcasting
applications but is rather aimed at new applications such as the delivery of HDTV
and IP-based services, ﬂy-away small DSNG stations, and low-cost Internet access
to rural areas and in developing countries. The DVB-S2 speciﬁcations, in con-
junction with recent advances in video compression, have enabled the widespread
commercial launch of HDTV services. The supported applications are as follows: 1.
standard and high-deﬁnition television broadcasts; 2. interactive services, including
Internet access for consumer applications; 3. professional applications: digital TV
298

Transmission Techniques

contribution (DTVC) facilitating point-to-multipoint transmissions, and digital
satellite news gathering (DSNG); 4. content distribution; and 5. Internet trunking.
In addition to MPEG-2 video and audio coding, DVB-S2 is designed to handle a
variety of advanced audio and video formats, which the DVB Project is currently
deﬁning. In fact, DVB-S2 accommodates most common digital input stream format,
including single or multiple MPEG transport streams, continuous bit streams, IP as
well as ATM packets. It is 30 % spectrally more efﬁcient than its predecessor,
employing an adaptable modulation scheme consisting of QPSK and 8-PSK for
broadcast applications and also 16-APSK and 32-APSK for professional applica-
tions such as newsgathering and interactive services.
In addition, the modulation and coding schemes may be dynamically adapted to
variable channel condition on a frame-by-frame basis scheme. The coding arrange-
ment consists of a Bose–Chaudhuri–Hocquenghem (BCH) outer code scheme and a
low-density parity-check (LDPC) inner code. The communication performance lies
within 0.7 dB of the theoretical limit. The ﬂexibility offered by variable coding and
modulation provides different levels of protection to services as needed.
The speciﬁcations support operation on any type of satellite transponder char-
acteristics with a large variety of spectrum efﬁciencies and associated C/N
requirements. Thus, the DVB-S2 broadcast services comprise a backward com-
patible mode and a more optimized version, which is not backward compatible. The
system allows interactive services by return channels established either via satellite
or another medium incorporating the added ﬂexibility of adaptive coding and
modulation (ACM) to the forward channel through feedback. Structured as a
toolkit, DVB-S2, attempts to optimize transmission efﬁciency and ﬂexibility,
keeping receiver costs at an acceptable level.
3.9.2
DVB-S2 Architecture
Figure 3.33 shows a block schematic of functional components of a DVB-S2
transmission system. There are two levels of framing structures, one at baseband
(BBFRAME) and the other at physical layer (PLFRAME).
Fig. 3.33 DVB-S2 transmission system—Courtesy of Book: by Richharia
3.9
Transmission Standards
299

Thus, BBFRAME includes signaling to conﬁgure the receiver for the given
speciﬁcation and service. The PLFRAME comprises a regular sequence of frames,
each coded and modulated for the given channel condition and application, con-
taining a few signaling bits for synchronization and physical layer signaling.
Referring to BBFRAME shown in Fig. 3.33, the mode and stream adaptation
block interfaces with the incoming stream, provides synchronization, and supports
the adaptive coding–modulation schemes. It merges multiple streams and slices
them into blocks, each of which are modulated and coded homogeneously.
A header of 80 bits containing transmission characteristics is next appended to the
baseband data block to assist reception. The information within the header, for
example, informs the receiver as to whether the transmission stream is single or
multiple, the type of coding modulation schemes, signal format, etc. When the
volume of data is insufﬁcient to ﬁll the frame, data padding is introduced, and
ﬁnally, the frame is scrambled and passed over for coding.
The FEC coding–modulation schemes are instrumental in high transmission
efﬁciency. The FEC code comprises a low-density parity-check (LDPC) code that
exhibits a low distance from the Shannon limit for the speciﬁed decoder complexity
(equating to 14 mm2 of silicon 0.13 μm technologies).
The LDPC codes are suitable for iterative decoding at reasonable complexity
because of their easily parallelizable decoding algorithm, which can use simple
operations resulting in reduced complexity and storage. To avoid error ﬂoors at low
error rates, a BCH outer code of the same block length as the LPDC code is
concatenated.
The coded payload modulates the carrier with a QPSK, 8-PSK, 16-APSK, or
32-APSK scheme, as required by the given application data rate and link condi-
tions. In fact, the corresponding spectral efﬁciency ranges from 0.5 to 4.5 b/symbol.
Typically, the QPSK and 8-PSK schemes are applied for broadcast applications
through nonlinear transponders, whereas 16- and 32-APSK schemes are better
suited for professional and other applications operating through transponders driven
in the quasi-linear region. The DVB-S2 provides backward compatibility with
DVB-S through a hierarchical modulation scheme.
The physical layer (PL) signals are composed of a regular sequence of frames,
within each of which the modulation and coding schemes remain unchanged, that
is, a homogeneous operation. A header of 90 bits preceding the payload assists in
synchronization at the receiver, detection of modulation, and coding parameters.
This header must be made particularly robust, as the LPDC/BCH scheme is not
applied here and the packet will not be detectable unless the header is detected
correctly. An interleaved ﬁrst-order Reed–Muller block code in tandem with the
π/2-BPSK modulation scheme was found to be suitable.

Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems
In the beginning of radio development, mobile communication systems were
conceived for the transmission and receiving of telegraphy and telephony signals
via antenna from ships, cars, trains, and aircraft. The consideration of antenna
transmission is inevitable, especially in Global Mobile Satellite Communications
(GMSC) applications, where their propagation characteristics are much affected by
different and changeable local environments during movement of mobile and differ
greatly from those observed in ﬁxed satellite systems. To create antenna hardware
for GMSC systems, engineers have to consider all related factors in order to realize
full electrical, mechanical, and transmission potentials.
This chapter describes antenna characteristics, requirements, and basic relations
of antenna systems, and considerable antenna classiﬁcation for mobile satellite
applications in general and for aeronautical satellite applications in particular. The
antenna systems can be installed on board ships, vehicles (tracks, buses, cars, and
trains), aircraft (airplanes and helicopters), GNSS antennas, and integrated solutions
with GSM antenna on the top of handheld phones. Thus, all basic mobile antenna
conﬁgurations for GMSC, such as low-gain omnidirectional antennas, three prin-
cipal divisions of medium-gain directional antennas, and two types of high-gain
directional aperture antennas, are presented. Finally, all types of antennas for par-
ticular mobile systems including antenna mounting and tracking systems are
included.

coherer and a detector element with telegraph relay and a bell. Soon later, Marconi
started commercially to deploy radio and antenna equipment on board different
merchant ships and to establish his own company for the production of maritime
radio and antenna equipment.
Since the initial use of mobile radio was for long-distance wireless communi-
cations at LF and the ﬁrst shipboard antenna was all made of haphazard lengths of
wire strung as high as possible above the ship’s topside, evidently the thinking was
that the longer and higher the wire, the better the results should be. After that, those
different kinds of wire and whip antennas were developed for MF/HF/VHF mar-
itime and aeronautical applications.
4.1.1
Development of Antennas for Mobile Satellite
Communications (MSC)
The MSC systems introduced new complexities into the design of shipboard
antennas. The direct line of sight between antenna and satellite requires the antenna
to see from horizon to overhead (zenith—90°) in elevation and 360° in azimuth
angle, with total hemispherical coverage. This is fulﬁlled in the case of transceiver
antenna through the use of tracking rotatable, high-gain antennas often installed in
pairs on board ship to attain full coverage, irrespective of blockage in the form of
the funnel, musts, stacks, and other deck objects.
The ship platform itself imposes even more stringent requirements. Therefore, in
spite of constant vibrating, pitching, rolling, and yawing during bad weather condi-
tions, the MSC antenna’s narrow radiation beam must be pointed accurately from any
position on the high seas. The situation regarding land or aero antenna is less com-
plicated. As the 1970s dawned, optimism and enthusiasm about satellite communi-
cations were so great with ideas to virtually replace HF radio in the navy with the new
FltSatCom military mobile system. For instance, since this time, several types of UHF
transceiving antennas developed for US naval shipboard services were used, such as
the oldest crossed-dipole array, its improved version and the so-called wash tube
similar to an SBF antenna and one type of SHF parabolic dish antenna. However, as
discussed in Chap. 1, the ﬁrst real global MSC system was the Marisat network,
which employed Ship Earth Station (SES) and L-band antenna systems similar to the
abandoned Inmarsat-A and current Inmarsat-B terminals.
4.1.2
Classiﬁcation and Types of Mobile Satellite
Antennas (MSA)
The general classiﬁcations of mobile satellite antenna (MSA) systems in connection
with the service operators and providers are performed on the following major
types: satellite communications antennas, satellite navigation and surveillance
302

Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

antennas, digital video broadcasting return channel via satellite (DVB-RCS) or
broadband antennas, satellite meteorological antenna, and military satellite anten-
nas. Owing to the fundamental values and characteristics, gain classiﬁcation of
MSA falls into three antenna groups: low-gain omnidirectional antennas,
medium-gain directional antennas, and high-gain directional aperture antennas. In
many respects, the mobile satellite antennas currently available for MSC applica-
tions constitute the weakest links of the system. If the mobile antenna has a high
gain, it has to track the satellite, following both mobiles and satellite orbital
motions. Thus, sometimes this is difﬁcult and expensive to synchronize.
Therefore, if the vehicular antenna has low gain, it does not need to perform
tracking, but the capacity of the communications link is limited. In general,
according to the transmission direction, there are three types of MSA: (1) trans-
mitting and receiving or so-called transceiving antennas; (2) receiving antennas
only for GMSC and GNSS solutions; and (3) transmitting only built-in satellite
beacon and for satellite asset tracking (SAT) devices. In particular, MSA antenna
can be a shipborne, vehicleborne, personal, GNSS, broadband, and airborne
antenna.
The shipborne MSA was developed for oceangoing ships and oilrigs, ﬁshing,
and inland vessels and boats, whose size and weight are not very critical. The
vehicleborne antennas can be mounted on board vehicles and wagons, which need
small size. The airborne antennas have very speciﬁc design for installations on
board aircraft and helicopters. Because of the high speed of aircraft, the aerody-
namic constraints are signiﬁcant and antennas for both radio and satellite systems
must conform to minimum drag and reliability requirements.
4.2
Antennas Requirements and Technical Characteristics
This section describes important general requirements for mobile antennas for
maritime, land, and aeronautical applications, including for personal terminals.
The MSA has to be compact, ﬂexible, and lightweight and performs with good
mechanical and electrical characteristics, especially for heavy mobiles such as ships
and aircraft, owing to the special conditions of installation and the inﬂuence of
changeable environmental conditions.
4.2.1
Mechanical Characteristics
Mobile antennas have to satisfy the requirements of mechanical characteristics in
relation to construction strength and easy installation. Easy installation and
appropriate physical shape are very important requirements in addition to com-
pactness and lightweight. In the case of shipborne antennas, the installation
requirements are not severe compared to that of aircraft and cars because even in
4.1

small ships there is a comfortable space to install an antenna set. Otherwise, the
only problem is that all types of ship satellite antennas are sometimes under stress
from vibration and sloping caused by strong winds, ship’s rolling, and pitch or are
subject to corrosion by sea salt.
Owing to these problems, a ship’s antenna has to be well protected by plastic
radome and properly mounted on a strong mast, specially designed for a certain size
of antenna. However, in the case of road vehicles, especially small cars, low-proﬁle
and lightweight equipment is required. The requirements are the same as that of
aircraft, although more severe conditions are required to satisfy avionic standards.
Namely, low air drag is one of the most important requirements for aircraft
antennas. Vehicles and aircraft utilize smaller and more aerodynamic sizes of
antenna.
4.2.2
Electrical Characteristics
Sometimes, the mechanical construction of antenna is perfect because of some
functional or electrical characteristics; however, designers of antenna have to keep
in mind that the compact design of antenna has two major disadvantages in elec-
trical characteristics, such as low-gain and wide beam coverage. The gain is closely
related to the beam width, and a low-gain antenna (LGA) should have a wide beam
width. As the gain of antenna is theoretically determined by its physical dimen-
sions, reducing the size of antenna means decreasing its gain.
Because of low-gain and limited power supply, it is very difﬁcult for mobile
antennas to have enough receiving capability (G/T) and transmission power (EIRP).
The disadvantages of Mobile Earth Station (MES) can be compensated by large
satellite antenna, high-power ampliﬁer (HPA), and enough electrical power.
A powerful satellite with high G/T and EIRP performance should permit the fab-
rication of MES with compact and lightweight antennas. The next disadvantage is
that a wide beam antenna is likely to transmit undesired signals to and receive them
from an undesired direction, which will cause interference in and from other sys-
tems. The wide beam is also responsible for several fading effects, such as that from
sea surface reﬂections in MMSC and AMSC and multipath fading in LMSC, and so
a compact mobile antenna system is required to prevent fading and interference.
Accordingly, it is inevitable for mobile antennas not to have enough perfor-
mance, such as gain, radiation power, and receiving capability because of their
small physical dimensions. Without taking this into consideration, the requirements
of transmitting and receiving performance of mobile antennas mainly depend on the
satellite transmission capability. The ﬁrst and second generations of Inmarsat
satellites have a global beam, and the third generation has spot and global beams to
provide global coverage.
The regional or domestic MSS, such as AMSC, MSAT, and Optus, have spot
beams. The spot gives higher satellite capacity than global beams although there are
304

basically no big differences between requirements for mobile antennas in the global
system, such as Inmarsat or the mentioned regional systems.
4.2.3
Basic Relations of Antennas
The basic relations of antenna systems are very important parameters to easily
understand the mode of antenna functions in two-way (duplex) satellite transmis-
sion systems, such as MES transceiving antennas. Moreover, these characteristics
of MES antenna systems are needed for link budget calculations and for good
satellite up- and downlink design, which can provide reliable and acceptable quality
satellite communications. At this point, this implies that the signal transmitted via
the MES Tx antenna must reach the Rx antenna of other MES or LES at a carrier
level sufﬁciently above the unwanted signals generated by various unavoidable
sources of noise and interference.

(GEO) satellites, at L-band (1.6/1.5 GHz) to link satellites and MES. The required
frequency bandwidth in L-band MSS is about 8 % to cover transmission and
receiving channels. In using a narrowband antenna, such as an omnidirectional
patch antenna, some efforts have to be made to widen the bandwidth. The S- and
L-bands are allocated in WARC-92 for the Big LEO Iridium and Globalstar sys-
tems, which require frequency bandwidths of about 5 %.
4.2.3.2
Gain and Directivity
The required antenna gain is determined by a link budget, which can be calculated
by taking into consideration the required channel quality and the satellite capability.
The channels are expressed as C/No and depend on the G/T and EIRP values of the
satellite and MES. In the case of the present Inmarsat Aero system, a comparative
high-gain antenna (HGA) of minimum 24 dBi is required, due to the difference in
satellite capabilities. However, LGA of about 0–4 dBi are used in the Inmarsat-C
and other omnidirectional systems to provide LSD of only about 600–1200 b/s.
The GPS system has adopted LGA because of the extremely low data rate of 50 b/s
from the satellites.
There are no exact deﬁnitions to differentiate between characteristics of low-,
medium-, and high-gain antenna systems, except by the gain quantum, shape of the
antenna, and type of service. In the present and upcoming L-band GMSC appli-
cations, classiﬁcation of L-band MES antenna systems by their receiving and ser-
vice capabilities is illustrated in Table 4.1.
4.2
Antennas Requirements and Technical Characteristics

The ideal antenna gain can be deﬁned with an isotropic (hypothetical) antenna,
which has an isotropic radiation pattern without any losses and therefore radiates
power in all directions in uniform intensities. Thus, if input power (Pin) is put into
an isotropic antenna, the power ﬂux density per ideal unit area (Pid) at distance
(r) from the antenna is given by the following relation:
Pid = Pin=4pr2½W/m2
ð4:1Þ
However, if radiated power density is P h; U
ð
Þ=r2 in directions (θ = angle
between the considered direction and the one in which maximum power is radiated,
known as boresight and U ¼ phase) at distance (r) from the antenna under eleva-
tion, the gain of the antenna can be deﬁned by the following equations:
G(h; UÞ = P(h; UÞ=r2/Pid = P(h; UÞ/r2=Pin/4pr2 = 4p P(h; UÞ=Pin = P(h; UÞ/Pin/4p½ dBi]
ð4:2Þ
The above-deﬁned gain is called an absolute gain or directive gain, which is
determined only by the directivity (radiation pattern) of the antenna without taking
account of any losses in the antenna system, such as impedance mismatch loss or
spillover loss. Thus, if direction is not speciﬁed and the gain is not given a function
of
h; U
ð
Þ, it is assumed to be maximum gain. There is a general relationship
between absolute gain and the physical dimensions of the antenna and this is given
by the equation as follows:
G = 4pk2ga
ð4:3Þ
where η = aperture efﬁciency and a = physical aperture, which will denote the
effective aperture of the antenna. According to the above relation, it can be realized
that compact antennas with small apertures must have low gain. If an antenna
aperture is a dish, a known diameter (d) can be written in normal and in decibel
expression as follows:
G = ðpd=kÞ2g ¼ 10 log gðpd=kÞ2 [dBi]
ð4:4Þ
Thus, it can be calculated that the gain in the Inmarsat shipborne antenna with a
diameter of d = 1 m operated at 1.5 GHz is about 21 dBi.
The directivity of the antenna D(h; UÞ does not include dissipative losses and is
deﬁned as the ratio of P(h; UÞ to the power per unit solid angle from an isotropic
antenna radiation, the same total antenna-radiated power (Pr). The antenna direc-
tivity can be expressed by:
D(h; UÞ = P(h; UÞ/Pr/4p
ð4:5Þ
306
4
Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

The deﬁnition of antenna directivity does not take the efﬁciency of an antenna
into account because (Pr/4pÞ is related to the actual power launched into space. The
ratio of G(h; UÞ to D(h; UÞ is termed the radiation efﬁciency of the antenna.
4.2.3.3
Radiation Pattern, Beam Width, and Sidelobes
Radiation calculation is possible in principle if the EM ﬁeld can be described
quantitatively at all points of the antenna surface whose boundaries are those of the
apertures.
In this section, the radiation pattern from a circular aperture is considered as the
aperture-type antenna that has generally been used in MSC, especially in MMSC.
This simple problem will give an insight into the characteristics of mobile antennas.
For an antenna that generates a single focused beam, the principal parameter
affecting the antenna radiation pattern Eðh; UÞ, after the aperture size (a) is the
aperture illumination distribution Eaðr; wÞ, which is the amplitude of the far-ﬁeld
radiation pattern E, at the point ðh; UÞ, being essentially the Fourier transform of the
illumination distribution and is given by:

where a = d/2 denotes the radius of antenna aperture; J0 = ﬁrst kind and order zero
of the Bassel function and k = 2p=2 denotes the wave number. The other notations
that denote distance and angles in coordinates are deﬁned in the geometry illus-
trated in Fig. 4.1 (Left). Thus, the antenna radiation pattern is three-dimensional in
nature, so it usually has to be represented from the point of view of a single-axis
plot.
The characteristics of the MES antenna radiation pattern affect interference
levels directly. Any improvement in the pattern will therefore be fully reﬂected in
the interference level, and such improvement constitutes a very effective means of
solving interference problems. To improve the pattern, one can either increase the
antenna diameter or, with a constant diameter, use a speciﬁc technique for reducing
the sidelobes. This method is therefore applicable when the MSC network is in the
initial stages of development.
The antenna gain is normally calculated with reference to the boresight, i.e., the
direction at which the maximum antenna gain occurs, in the case when h, U ¼0.
Gain is usually expressed in (dBi), where component (i) refers to the fact that it is
relative to the isotropic gain. In this instance, the matter of moment in a dual
polarization frequency reuse satellite communication system is polarization dis-
crimination between the copolar and cross-polar signals, especially in the antenna
main beam region, as illustrated in Fig. 4.1 (Right). An important parameter that is
used in an antenna’s speciﬁcation is the beam width evaluated by half-power beam
width (HPBW) 2hHP where hHP is the half-power angle when radiated power

becomes half the maximum level (−3 dB). The HPBW ðh0Þ is given by the fol-
lowing equation:
h0 = 65 ðk=dÞ
ð4:8Þ
Here, it is possible to realize that the half-power bandwidth is inversely pro-
portional to the operating frequency and the diameter of the antenna. For example, a
1-m receiver antenna operating in the C-band (4 GHz) has a 3 dB bandwidth of
roughly 4:9, while the same antenna operating in the Ku-band (11 GHz) has a
3 dB bandwidth of approximately 1:8.
The antenna systems have copolar and cross-polar gains, where the reception of
unwanted, orthogonally polarized cross-polar signals will add as interference to the
copolar signal. The ability of an antenna to discriminate between a wanted polarized
waveform and its unwanted orthogonal component is termed as its cross-polar
discrimination (XPD). When dual polarization is employed and the antenna’s
ability to differentiate between the wanted polarized waveform and the unwanted
signal of the same polarization, introduced by the orthogonal polarized wave, it is
termed as the cross-polar isolation (XPI). In this context, an antenna typically
would have an XPI >30 dB.
The level of the antenna pattern’s sidelobes is also important, as this tends to
represent gain in an unwanted direction. For a transmitting gain, this leads to the
transmission of unwanted power, resulting in interference to other systems, or in the
case of a receiving antenna, the reception of unwanted signals, or noise. The
sidelobe characteristic of MES is one of the main factors in determining the min-
imum spacing between satellites and therefore the orbit and spectrum utilization
efﬁciency. The ITU-R S.465-5 recommendation gives a reference radiation diagram
for use in coordination and interference assessment, which is deﬁned by:
G ¼ 32  25 log U½dBi]
for Umin  U\48
¼10 dBi
for 48  U  180
ð4:9Þ
where G = gain relative to an isotropic antenna; U = off-axis angle referred to the
main lobe axis and Umin=1 or 100ðk=dÞ degrees, whichever is the greater. In this
context, most of the effective power radiated by an antenna is contained in the
so-called main lobes of the radiation pattern, while some residual power is radiated
in the sidelobes. Sidelobes are an intrinsic property of antenna radiation, and
diffraction theory shows that they cannot be completely suppressed. However,
sidelobes are also due partly to antenna defects which can be minimized by proper
design. Conversely, due to the reciprocity theorem, the receive antenna gains and
radiation patterns at the same frequency are identical to the transmit antenna gains
and radiation patterns. Unlikely, unwanted power can also be picked up by the
antenna sidelobes during reception.
For large satellite antennas, with a diameter over 100 k (wavelengths), a refer-
ence radiation pattern is recommended by the CCIR for interference to and from
other satellite and terrestrial communication systems. At this point, the diameters of
4.2

the vehicle antennas under discussion are, in many cases, below ﬁve wavelengths in
the L-band. Further CCIR action is expected to deﬁne a reference radiation pattern
for mobile antennas in MSC.
4.2.3.4
Polarization and Axial Ratio
The antenna and the EM ﬁeld received or transmitted have polarization properties.
Thus, the polarization of an EM wave describes the shape and orientation of the
locus of the extremities of the ﬁeld vectors as a function of time. A wave may be
described as linearly, circularly, or elliptically polarized.
Linear polarization is such that the electric E-ﬁeld is oriented at a constant angle
as it is propagated that can be either vertically or horizontally. If a plane wave is
propagated along the (z)-axis and electric ﬁeld (E) is on the (x-z) or (y-z) planes,
relations for linear vertical and horizontal polarizations can be written as follows:
Ex ¼ Eaej xtkz þ Ua
ð
Þ
and
Ey ¼ Ebejðxtkz þ UbÞ
ð4:10Þ
where Ea; x; k and Ua denote the maximum amplitude of electric ﬁeld, angular
frequency (2πf), wave number, and initial phase, respectively, while Eb and Ub are
the maximum amplitude and the initial phase of the wave.
Circular polarization is the superposition of two orthogonal linear polarizations,
such as vertical and horizontal, with a 90° (π/2) phase difference. The tip of the
resultant E-ﬁeld vector may be imagined to rotate as it propagates in a helical path.
There is a left-hand circularly polarized (LHCP) wave with anticlockwise rotation
and a right-hand circularly polarized (RHCP) wave with clockwise rotation.
An elliptically polarized wave may be regarded as the result either of two
linearly or of two circularly polarized waves with opposite directions. This type of
polarization is the case when the amplitudes and phase difference between the two
waves are not equal (π/2).
As discussed in a previous section, the signals ﬁelds can contain copolar and
cross-polar components. In this way, the cross-polarization of a source becomes of
increasing interest to MSC antenna designers. In the case of Tx or Rx antennas with
a linearly polarized ﬁeld, the cross-polar component is the ﬁeld at right angles to
this copolar component. Namely, if the copolar component is vertical, then the
cross-polar component is horizontal.
Circular cross-polarization is that of the opposite hand to the desired principal or
reference polarization. Impure circular polarization is in fact elliptical. The level of
impurity is measured by the elliptical and known as the axial ratio (AR). The AR
can be deﬁned as the ratio of the major axis electric component to that of the minor
axis by:

Accordingly, the AR is determined by the performance of the antenna, so the AR
is one of the most important parameters of circularly polarized antennas. It can
easily be understood that the AR depends on the direction with respect to the axis of
the antenna. In general, the AR is best (smallest) in the boresight direction and is
progressively worse further away from the boresight. Circularly polarized waves are
used in order to eliminate the need for polarization tracking. RHCP has been used in
the Inmarsat transmission system. In the case of aperture-type antennas, such as the
parabolic reﬂector antenna, an axial ratio of below 1.5 dB in the boresight direction
is so easy to achieve that polarization mismatch loss is almost negligible. However,
in the case of phased-array antennas, a degradation of the axis ratio caused by beam
scanning must be taken into account.
4.2.3.5
Figure of Merit (G/T) and EIRP
Although gain is an essential factor in considering antennas, the ﬁgure-of-merit
ratio of a G/T is more commonly speciﬁed from the standpoint of MSS and FSS in
general. The G/T for the receiving station is deﬁned as the ratio of the gain of the
antenna in the direction of the receiving signal to the receiving system noise
temperature. The G/T is generally given for the maximum gain derived from gain
formula (4.4) as follows:
Gmax ¼ Pmax=P0=4p ¼ 10 log G dB



The Gmax is often called the antenna gain expressed in dB, where the total

ð4:15Þ
The Earth station G/T typical values range from 35 dB(K−1); for instance, an
LES receive antenna with a 15–18 m diameter has some 15.5 dB(K−1). The G/T is
a very important parameter of an Earth station, so the methods used for its mea-
surement and the contribution to the noise temperature are the subject of the ITU-R
S.733 recommendation.
The noise temperature measured at the terminals of antenna pointed to the sky
depends upon frequency of operation, elevation angle, and the antenna sidelobe
structure. In more formal terms, the noise temperature will be derived from a
complete solid angle integration of the noise power received from all noise sources
(terrestrial and galactic) and determined for clear weather conditions by the fol-
lowing integral:

Thus, to produce a low-noise antenna, its sidelobes must be minimized, espe-
cially in the direction of the Earth’s surface, where T = noise temperature. Total
noise temperature of the system (TSR) at an input port of receiver LNA or at the
antenna output (TA) is taking account of losses caused by tracking, feed lines, and a
radome and is deﬁned by:
TSR ¼ TR þ Ta 11=a

TSA ¼ TA þ Ta a1

where TR = noise temperature of the receiver (LNA) with a typical value of about

Lf = total loss of feed lines and components such as diplexer, cables, and phase
shifters if a phased-array antenna is used; a = attenuation expressed as a power ratio
(a ≥1 or in decibel adB ¼ 10 log a); TA = antenna noise temperature that comes
from the ionosphere and the Earth, whose value of about 200 K depends on factors
such as frequency and bandwidth; and TSA = antenna with a noise temperature.
The noise of the antenna temperature must be kept as low as possible by proper
design on in order to obtain a high ﬁgure of merit (G/T). With reference to the
previously expressed formula

(dBW), taking account of feed losses such as feed lines, cable, and a diplexer.
4.3
Classiﬁcation of Mobile Satellite Antennas (MSA)
In many respects, the mobile satellite antennas currently available for MSC
applications constitute the weakest links of the system. If the mobile antenna has a
high gain, it has to track the satellite, following both mobiles and satellite orbital
motions. Thus, sometimes, this is difﬁcult and expensive to synchronize. Therefore,
if the vehicular antenna has low gain, it does not need to perform tracking, but the
capacity of the communications link is limited. In general, according to the trans-
mission direction, there are three types of MSA: (1) transmitting and receiving or
so-called transceiving, as a part of all types of MES; (2) only receiving is part of the
special Inmarsat EGC receiver; and (3) only transmitting is built-in satellite beacon
antennas for maritime, land, and aeronautical applications.
Existing and forthcoming GEO and non-GEO mobile satellite operators have
conducted research on all network segments, including different types of MSA and
their future development and improvements. The Engineering Test Satellite-V
(ETS/V) experiments conducted in Japan for the transmission of voice, video, and
different data rate digital communications between ships, land vehicles, and aircraft
were successful. Moreover, a test of low-speed data transmission by using
briefcase-size transportable equipment, onto which two small printed antennas were
mounted, was among the experiments.
4.3.1
Shipborne MSA
The different types of shipborne satellite antenna systems were developed for
installation on board oceangoing ships and inland sailing vessels, on sea platforms
and other offshore infrastructures. In general, these antennas must have strong and
rugged constructions, with corresponding mechanical and electrical particulars. The
Inmarsat-A SES is the inheritor of the ﬁrst generation of Marisat, similar to SES,
and was the ﬁrst Inmarsat operating standard of MMSC. In fact, this analog stan-
dard was started in 1982, using the Inmarsat-A standard transceiving antenna
system known as above deck equipment (ADE).
4.2
Antennas Requirements and Technical Characteristics
313

In the meantime, Inmarsat-C and EGC were developed with small omnidirec-
tional antennas. In addition, Inmarsat-B digital standard started to be in service on
ships at the end of 1993, using the second generation of Inmarsat satellites. This
standard, compatible with Inmarsat-A, uses the same antenna speciﬁcation. After
employing more powerful satellite constellations, the Inmarsat system developed
Inmarsat-M, mini-M, and D+ standards with special shipborne antenna systems. All
the above-mentioned MSA are transceiving antennas, except for the Inmarsat EGC
receiver, which can also use a receiving antenna. At the same time, Inmarsat
developed the Inmarsat-E L-band satellite EPIRB, which was decommissioned on
December 1, 2006. On the other hand, the COSPAS–SARSAT system developed
shipborne EPIRB, with small built-in VHF and UHF antennas, which is able to
send distress alert for search and rescue (SAR) operations. Thus, rugged MSA with
added-value system functions compatible with shipborne operation for Inmarsat,
Iridium, Globalstar, and other systems, and compact antennas for small lifeboat
operation are some of the fascinating requirements for antenna designers in the
future.
4.3.2
Vehicleborne MSA
The vehicleborne MSA were developed for installation on road and rail vehicles,
such as trucks, trailers, buses, cars, and trains. Thus, the transceiving Inmarsat-C, D,
M, mini-M, and other MSA are used on board land vehicles. Similar to the maritime
application, the COSPAS–SARSAT system has developed personal or vehicle-
borne

Airborne MSA
The airborne MSA were developed for installation on board aircraft, such as air-
planes and helicopters. There are several types of low- and high-gain airborne
satellite transceiving antennas for Inmarsat-C, H, H+, I, L, mini-M, and other MSS.
Parallel to the maritime and land distress applications, the COSPAS–SARSAT
system developed airborne ELT satellite beacons with small built-in VHF- and
UHF-band-transmitting antennas. Because of the high speed of aircraft, the aero-
dynamic constraints are signiﬁcant and antennas for both radio and satellite systems
must conform to minimum drag and reliability requirements.

Transportable MSA
Inmarsat satellite operator developed special transceiving satellite antenna systems,
which can be integrated into mobile Transportable Earth Station (TES) of
Inmarsat-B, C, M, and mini-M terminals.
4.3.5
MSA for Personal Satellite Terminals
The new GEO and non-GEO MSC systems developed small satellite antennas for
GMPSC terminals, such as handheld and roof antennas. These systems provide
mobile tracking, so the tracking antenna has to be combined or integrated with the
communications antenna.
4.3.6
Other Types of MSA
The other solutions for MSA are receiving broadcast radio and TV and GNSS,
transceiving broadband and antennas for military satellite communications and
navigation equipment.
4.4
Low-Gain Omnidirectional Antennas
As mentioned, the antenna systems for MSC are classiﬁed into omnidirectional and
directional. The gain of omnidirectional antennas is low and generally from 0 to
4 dB in the L-band, which does not require the capability of satellite tracking. There
are three types of low-gain omnidirectional antennas, which are very attractive for
all mobile applications owing to the small size, lightweight, and circular polar-
ization properties. These antennas are also used as elements of directional antennas
for special conﬁgurations.
4.4.1
Quadriﬁlar Helix Antenna (QHA)
The QHA low-gain model is composed of four identical helixes wound, equally
spaced, on a cylindrical surface. The helix elements are fed with signals equal in
amplitude and 0, 90, 180, and 270° in relative phase. This antenna can easily
generate circularly polarized waves without a balloon or a 3 dB power divider,
which are required to excite a balanced fed dipole and circularly polarized

crossed-dipoles. It can also be operated on a wide frequency bandwidth of up to
200 % because it is a traveling-wave-type antenna. The components of QHA are
ground plane (g), pitch (p), pitch angle (a), length (l), and diameter (d), presented in
Fig. 4.2a. The diameter of the ground plane is usually selected to be larger than one
wavelength, and the number of turns is N = l/p. However, it is well known that the
parameters for (a) are about 12–15 and the circumference of the helix pd
ð
Þ is about
0.75–1.25 wavelengths. Circularly polarized waves with good axial ratios can be
transmitted along the (z)-axis direction (axial mode). The gain of a helical antenna
depends on the number of (N) turns, and typical gain and half-power beam width
are about 8 dBi and 50 when N = 12  12 but is usually about 3 dBi. This antenna
is employed as a receiving antenna for GPS and as a transceiver antenna for L-band
Inmarsat-C SES, Vehicle Earth Station (VES) and Aircraft Earth Station (AES),
low air drag Aero-C applications covered by different kinds of radomes. All three
types of antennas can also be combined with GPS receiving. This antenna is also a
component of satellite terminals deployed by AMSC, MSAT, MSAT-x, Iridium,
Globalstar, Mobilesat ETS-V, forthcoming ICO, and other MSC operators.
In general, QHA, as a mobile antenna, is the best solution and has two advan-
tages over a conventional uniﬁlar helical antenna. The ﬁrst is an increase in
bandwidth; namely, it can generate axial mode circularly polarized waves in the
frequency range from 0.4 to 2.0 wavelengths of the helix circumference. The
second is lowered frequency for axial mode operation. The principal disadvantage
is an increase in the complexity of the feed system. The area of the ground plane is
usually about 3 times the diameter of the helix.
4.4.2
Crossed-Drooping Dipole Antenna (CDDA)
A dipole antenna with a half wavelength k=2
ð
Þ is the most widely used, and it is
also the most popular, having been used in antenna systems such as the parabolic
antenna for MSC.

Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

A half-wavelength dipole is a linear antenna whose current amplitude varies
one-half of a sine wave, with a maximum at the center. As a dipole antenna radiates
linearly polarized waves, two crossed-dipole antennas have been used in order to
generate circularly polarized waves. The two dipoles are geometrically orthogonal,
and equal amplitude signals are fed to them with p=2 in-phase difference. In order
to optimize the radiation pattern, a set of dipole antennas is bent toward the ground,
as shown in Fig. 4.2b, and for that reason, it is called a drooping dipole antenna.
Otherwise, the CDDA serves as a transceiver antenna for L-band Inmarsat-C SES
and VES applications mounted inside a radome.
The CDDA is the most interesting for LMSC, where required angular coverage
is narrow in elevation and is almost constant in azimuth angle. By varying the
separation between the dipole elements and the ground plane, the elevation pattern
can be adjusted for optimum coverage for the region of interest. The general
characteristics of this antenna are as follows: Gain is 4 dBi minimum, axial ratio is
6 dB maximum, and the height of the antenna is about 15 cm. This antenna has a
maximum gain in the boresight direction.
4.4.3
Microstrip Patch Antenna (MPA)
A microstrip disk (patch) antenna is very low proﬁle and has mechanical strength,
so it is considered to be the best type for mobiles such as cars and especially in
aircraft at the hybrid L to Ku-band, which requires low air drag. In general, a
circular disk antenna element has a circular metallic disk supported by a dielectric
substrate material and printed on a thin dielectric substrate with a ground plane. In
order to produce a circularly polarized wave, a patch antenna is excited at two
points orthogonal to each other and fed with signals equal in amplitude and 0 and
90° in relative phase. Thus, a higher-mode patch antenna can also be designed to
have a similar radiation pattern to the drooping dipole. To produce conical radiation
patterns (null on axis) suitable for land mobile satellite applications, the antenna is
excited at higher-mode orders. In Fig. 4.2c is illustrated the basic conﬁguration for
a circular patch antenna (above it is shown square patch with the same character-
istics), which has two feed points to generate circularly polarized waves. The
resonant frequency is excited by basic mode and given as follows:
f ¼ 1:84c=2papϵr
ð4:20Þ
where (a), (c), and ϵr
ð Þ are the radius of circular disk, the velocity of light in free
space, and the relative dielectric constant of the substrate, respectively.
In LMSC, a MPA antenna with higher-order excitation is considered better
because it can optimize the gain in elevation angle to the satellite in the same way as
a CDDA. The area of a higher-mode circular MPA is about 1.7 times larger in
radius as the gain is about 6–8 dBi. The circular patch is also suitable as a satellite
navigation-receiving
antenna
for
GPS
receivers.
The

higher-order excitation is considered better because it can optimize the gain in
elevation angle to the satellite in the same way as a CDDA.
In fact, the area of a higher-mode circular MPA is about 1.7 times larger in
radius as the gain is about 6–8 dBi. The circular patch is also suitable as a satellite
navigation-receiving antenna for GPS receivers.
4.5
Directional Medium-Gain Antennas (MGA)
The medium-gain directional MSA are solutions with a typical gain between 12 and
15 dBi, although some antennas can have even bigger gains. These MSC antenna
systems can provide voice, fax, and HSD for Inmarsat-M MES applications and for
Inmarsat airborne standards, including other systems developed by ESTEC.
4.5.1
Aperture Reﬂector Antennas
The aperture reﬂector antennas are good solutions with medium-gain characteristics
used in MSC, with three basic representatives such as SBF, modiﬁed SBF, and
improved SBF antennas, illustrated in Fig. 4.3 (Left), (Middle), and (Right),
respectively. The main characteristics of these three antennas are shown in
Table 4.2.
Moreover, due to the excellent radiation characteristics and voltage standing
wave ratio (VSWR) of SBF antennas, all three types of aperture antenna with
half-power beam width of about 34° have been in their time proposed for
Inmarsat-M antenna. The SBF antennas consist of the stabilized platform with two
gyroscopes for azimuth and elevation angles, diplexer, HPA, and LNA, which are

enclosed under the protective cupola of a radome. In order to stabilize the antenna,
two gyro wheels rotate in opposite directions on a platform.
4.5.1.1
Short Backﬁre (SBF) Plane Reﬂector Antenna
The SBF plane reﬂector antenna that was developed experimentally by H.W.
Ehrenspeck in the 1960s is well known as a highly efﬁcient antenna of distinctly
simple and compact construction. Its high directivity and low sidelobe character-
istics make it a single antenna with high, even values, which are applicable to MSC,
tracking, and telemetry. Therefore, an SBF antenna is very attractive for gains in the
order of 13–15 dBi peak RHCP and can be mounted primarily on small but on any
size of ships. This antenna consists of two circular planar reﬂectors of different
diameter, separated generally by one-half wavelength, forming a shallow leaky
cavity resonator with a radiation beam normal to the small reﬂector. The antenna is
fed by a dipole at around the midpoint between two reﬂectors, and it has almost a
quarter-wavelength rim on the larger reﬂector. It has the problem of a narrow
bandwidth of about 3 % because of its leaky cavity operation.
The Rx terminal G/T is −12 dBK, and the EIRP of the Tx terminal is 28 dBW.
The basic conﬁguration of the SBF antenna consists of a crossed-dipole element,

which is required to generate a circularly polarized wave, large and small reﬂectors,
and a circular metallic rim. It has the strong directivity normal to the reﬂector, and
its performance is superior to that of other types of mobile antennas with the same
diameter; however, it has the problem of narrow frequency band characteristics.
This antenna has many beneﬁcial characteristics, such as efﬁciency and the sim-
plicity of construction, and is also considered a favorite option for a compact and
high-efﬁciency shipboard antenna. It is produced by many world manufacturers
approved by Inmarsat or ESTEC.
4.5.1.2
Modiﬁed SBF Plane Reﬂector Antenna
A modiﬁed SBF antenna differs from the conventional SBF antenna in that there is
either an additional step on the large reﬂector or a change in the shape of the large
reﬂector from a circular to a conical plate in order to improve the gain character-
istics and the frequency bandwidth of the VSWR.
The dual reﬂector improves the input impedance characteristics covering the
frequency range between transmitting and receiving sides. The conventional SBF
model is a resonant-type antenna, producing input impedance characteristics that
are narrow in bandwidth, so wider bandwidth is required to cover the 1.6/1.5 GHz
range for MES of the Inmarsat system. In effect, the improvement in the input
impedance is greatly dependent on the size and the separation of the small reﬂec-
tors. The VSWR can be reduced from 1.7 and 1.5 (at 1.54 and 1.64 GHz) to below
1.2 for each RF.
4.5.1.3
Improved SBF Conical Reﬂector Antenna
The main research activities of the ETS-V program in MSC have been focused on
studying the reduction of fading, using compact and high-efﬁciency antennas with a
gain of around 15 dBi, so the electrical characteristics of a simple SBF antenna
have been improved by changing its main reﬂector from a ﬂat disk to a conical or a
step plate and by adding a second small reﬂector. The gain is improved by 1 dB
without changing sidelobe levels. Comparisons of electrical and other parameters of
three types of SBF antennas are shown in Table 4.2. Stabilization of the antenna is
obtained by a two-axis stabilized method, and satellite pointing is carried out by a
tracking program using output signals from the ship’s gyroscope. It is also con-
sidered to be a suitable option for mounting aboard ships.
4.5.2
Wire Antennas
The wire antenna systems are monosyllabic construction or combinations of ele-
ments, such as different shapes of wire spirals and helixes, dipoles, and patches.
320

Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

These types of antennas have a very simple construction, with any reﬂector spec-
iﬁed for medium-gain directional antennas, and, with some modiﬁcation, respond
well to the demands of MSC applications.
4.5.2.1
Helical Wire Antennas
Since an axial mode helical antenna has good circular polarization characteristics
over a wide frequency range, it has been put into practical use as a single wire
antenna or as an array element. With respect to the structure, this antenna can be
considered a compromise between the dipole and the loop antennas and the radi-
ation mode varies with the pitch angle and the circumference of the helix. In
particular, a helix with a pitch angle of 12–15° and a circumference of about 1λ has
a sharp directivity toward the axial direction of the antenna. This radiation mode is
called the axial mode, which is the most important mode in helical antennas.
Several studies have been carried out on the properties of the axial mode helical
antenna with a ﬁnite reﬂector. The current induced on the helix is composed of four
major waves, which are two rapidly attenuating waves and two uniform waves
along the helical wire. These waves include the traveling wave and the reﬂected
wave. Thus, in a conventional helical antenna, the uniform traveling wave will be
dominant when the antenna length is fairly large, with typical versions such as a
conical helix shown in Fig. 4.4a and a cylindrical helix in Fig. 4.4b. A conical helix
is interesting for L-band MSS enabling HPBW in the order of 100° and circular
polarization without hybrid gain of 4–7 dBi. Cylindrical antennas can be monoﬁlar
or multiﬁlar, also suited for L-band MSS, while in a shortcut cylindrical helix
antenna, the rapidly attenuating traveling wave will be dominant, especially in a
two-turn (N = 2) helical antenna.
1 Conical Helix Antenna—This antenna can be regarded as a low-gain devel-
opment of the cylindrical helix antenna and is suitable for wide beam-width
applications with good efﬁciency. Thus, with suitable choices of cone angle and
turn spacing, it is possible to achieve a beam width in the order of 100°. This
type of antenna can also achieve an input VSWR of 1.5:1 or better than 5 %

Directional Medium-Gain Antennas (MGA)

frequency bandwidth merely by incorporating a simple quarter-wavelength
transformer. The typical size of an L-band application is in the order of 15 cm in
length, and the ground plane is about 20 cm in diameter. The resultant gain is
approximately 4–7 dBi, which is between low- and medium-gain requirements.
2 Two-Turn Cylindrical Helix Antenna—This antenna has two turns of wires,
forming a simple helical antenna with reﬂector, shown in Fig. 4.4c. This model
has relatively high antenna gain and excellent polarization characteristics for its
size. Radiation patterns characteristically are calculated with respect to (E0) and
EU
ð
Þ planes. Its gain is 9 dBi, and the axial ratio is about 1 dB, with reﬂector
diameter (d) around 1λ. Such types of antenna have comparatively high per-
formance in spite of their small size and compact construction. From the
above-mentioned considerations, a highly efﬁcient antenna for the Inmarsat-M
MES can be realized by applying this antenna to elements of an array antenna.
3 Five-Turn Cylindrical Helix Antenna—This antenna solution is illustrated in
Fig. 4.4d. The main electrical characteristics are as follows: Gain is 12.5 dBi of
peak RHCP for Tx and 11.5 dBi for Rx; sidelobe level has value of about
−13 dB; axial ratio is 3 dB; beam width of 3 dB has angle of −47o; terminal
G/T has −16 dBK; and terminal EIRP has 29 dBW. This antenna solution is
designed and developed by the European research institution ESTEC. Its sta-
bilization is obtained by gravity elevation on double-gimbaled suspension.
Thus, the pendulum aligns itself with the vertical when not subject to other
acceleration. However, the center of rotation of the pendulum is distant from
that of the ship pitch and roll movement induces horizontal acceleration to
which the pendulum is sensitive. In order to limit perturbations, the resonant
frequency of the pendulum must be low with respect to the excitation fre-
quencies in pitch and roll and the damping (friction) must be minimum. Low
resonance frequency is achieved by minimizing the distance between the center
of gravity of the rotating part and its center of rotation. This also reduces torque
due to horizontal acceleration but at the same time reduces the stabilizing torque
due to gravity.
4.5.2.2
Inverted V-Type Crossed-Dipole Antenna
The inverted V-type crossed-dipole antenna is an advanced circularly polarized
antenna with tick V-elements, illustrated in Fig. 4.5 (Left). The resonance of this
antenna is obtained when the length is somewhat shorter than a free-space half
wavelength.
Thus, as the thickness is increased, the resonant length is reduced. Circular
polarization can be produced by a pair of orthogonally positioned dipoles driven in
quadrature phase with equal amplitudes. The crossed-dipole antenna arrangement
cannot provide a good axial ratio off boresight because the radiation patterns for the
straight dipole are different in both principal planes, called the H and E planes. This
322
4
Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

shortcoming can be improved by modifying the straight dipoles to a non-straight
version, such as the V- and U-forms.
The improved dipoles are called V- and U-type dipoles. According to some
conducted measurements, the U-type provides better electrical performance than the
V-type, though the V-type is simpler in mechanical structure and is less complex.
The crossed-dipole can also produce circular polarization without using any
external circuits, such as the hybrid component.
Thus, the condition to excite the circularly polarized waves can be established by
a balun and the self-phasing of four radiating elements. Two of the elements are at a
0° phase angle, and the other two are at an 180° phase angle. The desired 90° phase
difference is obtained by designing the orthogonal elements such that one is larger
to make it inductive, while the other is smaller to make it capacitive. This type of
antenna is a good model for Ku-band aeronautical satellite communications.
4.5.2.3
Crossed-Slot Antenna
These antennas are useful for L-band aeronautical satellite communications on
high-speed aircraft because they are very low proﬁle in structure and suitable for a
ﬂush-mounting application, shown in Fig. 4.5 (Middle). The slot antenna is cir-
cularly polarized and is complementary with the corresponding dipole antenna, so
that the radiation pattern is the same as that for the horizontal dipole.
There are only two differences: First is the property that the electric and magnetic
ﬁelds are interchanged, and second is that the slot electric ﬁeld component normal
to the perfectly conducting sheet is discontinuous from one side of the sheet to the
other because of the direction of the ﬁeld reverses.
In this case, the tangential component of the magnetic ﬁeld is, likewise, dis-
continuous. This antenna can be also complementary with the corresponding
crossed-dipole antenna, although the feeding method for the circular polarization is
more complicated. Thus, on a model of this antenna known as a cavity-backed, it
needs one 90° hybrid to produce the circular polarization. This feed technique is
effective not only to suppress undesired coupling between the cross-slots but also to
match the input impedance over a wider frequency band.

4.5.2.4
Conical Spiral Antenna
This type of antenna has spiral wire elements on a cone with circular polarization
and is suitable for L-band LMSC and GPS applications, while the biﬁlar version is
also used in Ku-band satellite communications [see Fig. 4.5 (Right)]. In comparison
with a conical helix antenna, this type of antenna provides better performance and is
more versatile, though the geometry is somewhat complex. Such antenna is inde-
pendent of frequency, and its geometry can be presented mathematically in
spherical coordinates r,h; U
ð
Þ as follows:
r ¼ eaUg h
ð Þ
ð4:21Þ
where (a) and g h
ð Þ are an arbitrary constant and angular function, respectively. Its
radiation mechanism can be understood by regarding the two spirals as a trans-
mission line. When two conductor arms are fed in antiphase at the cone apex, waves
travel out from the feed point and propagate along the spirals without radiating until
a resonant length has been traversed. Strong radiation occurs at that point, and very
little energy is reﬂected by the outer limits of the spiral.
Conveniently, two conductor arms can also be fed directly at the center point or
apex from a coaxial cable bonded to one of the spiral arms without any external
baluns because the spiral arm can itself act as a balun. In this case, a dummy cable
may be bonded to another arm to maintain the symmetrical performance. If the
width of arm is decreased to a narrow constant value, the arms can be formed by the
cable alone.
4.5.2.5
Planar Spiral Antennas
Cavity-backed planar spiral antennas are commonly divided into three main cate-
gories: equiangular, logarithmic, and Archimedean spiral antennas. These types of
antennas are well suited for ﬂush mounting on aircraft for L to Ku-band satellite
communications. In general, this antenna has been fed by using the external balun,
but it can also be fed at the center point, or apex, from a coaxial cable bonded to one
of the arms, without any external baluns, like the conical spiral antenna.
1 Equiangular Spiral Antenna—The geometry of this antenna corresponds to
the special case of the conical spiral antenna, biﬁlar with logarithmic period,
cavity-backed and can be obtained by substituting a π/2 into θ0 to give:
r1 ¼ r0eaU; r2 ¼ r0eaðUDÞ; r3 ¼ r0eaðUpÞ; r4 ¼ r0eaðUDpÞ
ð4:22Þ
This antenna needs no external hybrid circuits to produce circular polarization,
and the example shown in Fig. 4.6 (Left) can radiate LHCP waves outward from
the page and RHCP waves into the page when the pair of spirals is excited in
antiphase at the center. Otherwise, according to experimental measurements, the
324
4
Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

axial ratio is near unity and the HPBW is in the order of 90° over a decade
bandwidth or even more. As for the input impedance, the resistive part on the
thickness of the antenna elements and thin elements lead to high impedance
values. This implies that the impedance depends on the arm width when the
structure is planar. If the angular extent D
ð Þ is chosen to be 90°, the geometries
of the arm and the space between arms are identical, except for a rotation of 90°
around an axis.
This structure is deﬁned as self-complementary, just like the conical spiral
antenna, but it should be noted that the planar spiral antenna has a constant
impedance of 60p X
½  for the two arm conﬁgurations.
2. Logarithmic Spiral Antenna—This biﬁlar antenna design with logarithmic
period and cavity-backed, shown in Fig. 4.6 (Middle), can be presented math-
ematically by the following equation:
r1 ¼ aU; r2 ¼ aðUDÞ; r3 ¼ aðUpÞ; r4 ¼ aðUDpÞ
ð4:23Þ
This antenna can radiate RHCP waves outward from the page and LHCP waves
into the page without any external hybrid circuits, as a pair of spirals is excited
with an antiphase at the center.
3. Archimedean Spiral Antenna—The Archimedean spiral thin-wire biﬁlar
cavity-backed antenna, which is illustrated in Fig. 4.6 (Right), is another
geometry of the planar spiral antenna. This spiral antenna has superior band-
width properties when fully optimized and typically consists of a pair of
thin-wire arms, of which the geometry can be presented by the following
relation:
r1 ¼ r0U; r2 ¼ r0 Up
ð
Þ
ð4:24Þ
This antenna also needs no external hybrid circuits to produce circular polar-
ization and can radiate RHCP waves outward from the page and the LHCP waves
into the page if the pair of thin-wire arms is excited in antiphase at the center. It is a

Directional Medium-Gain Antennas (MGA)

broadband antenna and has properties similar to the standard planar spiral antenna,
although it is not theoretically a frequency-independent structure. When placed in a
quarter-wave cavity, this antenna can achieve near-octave bandwidth, even when
the cavity consists in a metal-based cylinder without any absorber.
Thus, if an absorber-loaded cylinder is employed in the cavity, a greater-than-
decade bandwidth may be achieved, although about half the power is dissipated into
heat by the absorber. A typical Archimedean spiral antenna has an octave band-
width for a VSWR less then 2, an axial ratio of less then 2 dB, and a beam width of
about 70°, while a gain of 7–8 dBi is achieved without an absorber. The structure
has several mechanical advantages: It is compact and fairly simple to construct, and
the spiral arms can be easily fed, using a suitable impendence-transforming balun.
4.5.3
Array Antennas
Several different types of antenna can be arrayed in space to make a directional
pattern or one with a desired radiation pattern. This type of integrated and combined
antenna is called an array antenna consisting of more than two elements, such as
microstrip, crossed-slot, crossed-dipole, helixes, or other wire elements, and is
suitable for MSC. Each element of an array antenna is excited by equal amplitude
and phase, and its radiation pattern is ﬁxed.
4.5.3.1
Microstrip Array Antenna
The microstrip array antenna (MAA) is a nine-element ﬂat antenna disposed in three
lines spaced at 94 mm, namely about a half wavelength at 1.6/1.5 GHz and whose
antenna volume is about 300 × 300 × 10 mm [see Fig. 4.7 (Left)]. As shown in this
ﬁgure, the element arrangements of the MAA solutions are 3 × 3 rows square arrays
in order to obtain similar radiation patterns in different cut planes.

Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

The MAA beam scanning is performed by controlling four-bit variable phase
shifters attached to each antenna element. This type of antenna is very applicable
for the MES Inmarsat-M and the Inmarsat Aero standard.
4.5.3.2
Crossed-Slot Array Antenna
The crossed-slot array antennas (XSA) are a 16-element solution with 97-mm
spacing, and their volume is about 560 × 560 × 20 mm, shown in Fig. 4.7
(Middle). Evident is the element arrangement of the XSA, which is a modiﬁed
4 × 4 square array in order to obtain similar radiation patterns in different cut
planes.
The XSA antenna beam scanning is carried out to control four-bit variable phase
shifters associated with each antenna element. This antenna is suitable for the MES
Inmarsat-M MES, including Inmarsat Aero solutions.
4.5.3.3
Crossed-Dipole Array Antenna
The crossed-dipole array antenna is composed of 16 crossed-dipoles fed in phase
with a peak gain of 17 dBi and with the feeding circuit behind the radiating
aperture, shown in Fig. 4.7 (Right). The main electrical characteristics of this
antenna are as follows: Gain is 15–17 dBi with peak RHCP transmit; axial ratio has
a value of 0.7 dB; beam width of 3 dB is −34°; terminal G/T is −9.5 dBK; and
EIRP terminal value is 32 dBW.
Otherwise, the antenna system consists of a stabilization mechanism platform for
tracking and satellite focusing, ﬂat antenna array, diplexer, HPA, and LNA, which
are all protected by a plastic radome. Stabilization of the antenna is obtained by a
single-wheel gyroscope, when the azimuth pointing is controlled by the output from
the ship’s gyrocompass. Similar to the previous two models, this satellite antenna is
also suitable for maritime, land, and aeronautical applications.
4.5.3.4
Four-Element Array Antennas
There have been several four-element antenna models developed, such as Yagi–
Uda, quad-helix, and four-element SBF array.
1 Yagi-Uda Crossed-Dipole Array Antenna—This type of array antenna has
been developed for use on board ships and is protected with a radome, shown in
Fig. 4.8 (Left). The feeder of this antenna is a simple formation of four in-line
crossed-dipoles ﬁxed in the middle of the reﬂector. This end-ﬁre array has
circular polarization, and the gain is between 8 and 15 dBi.
2 Quad-Helix Array Antenna—The quad-helix array antenna solution is com-
posed of four identical two-turn helical wire antennas in the shape of a square
4.5
Directional Medium-Gain Antennas (MGA)

and whose elements are oriented in the manner shown in Fig. 4.8 (Middle).
According to the previous studies, the effect of mutual coupling between each
element of this antenna is not negligible and this mutual coupling mainly
degrades the axial ratio. The axial ratio of a single helical antenna is about 1 dB,
but this value is degraded to about 4.5 dB in the case of the array antenna with
an array spacing of 0.7λ. However, the best properties of antenna gain and axial
ratio can be obtained at a rim height of about 0.25λ. The antenna gain is
improved by 0.4 dB, and the axial ratio is also improved by 3.5 dB, compared
to that of the quad-helix array antenna without rims. The performance charac-
teristics of this small antenna are essentially, gain is about 13 dB (HPBW is
38°), and aperture efﬁciency is about 100 %. It appears that this type of
helix-integrated antenna is also well suited for the shipborne Inmarsat-M
standards.
3 Four-Element SBF Array—This antenna is developed on the basis of a con-
ventional SBF antenna as an integrated array with four SBF elements [see
Fig. 4.8 (Right)]. The antenna provides high aperture efﬁciency, circular
polarization, and almost high-performance gain between 18 and 20 dBi.
Because of the high-gain characteristics, this array is very suitable for maritime
applications as a shipborne antenna.
4.5.3.5
Spiral Array Antenna
Directional antennas for LMSC have been expected to provide voice and HSD links
not only for long-haul tracks but also for private cars. From that point of view, cost
is an important factor to be taken into account in designing antenna systems. In the
early stage of LMSC, a mechanical steering antenna system was considered the best
candidate for vehicles; however, it will be replaced by a phased-array antenna in the
near future because it has many attractive advantages, such as low proﬁle,
high-speed tracking, and potentially low cost.

Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

The mechanical steering antenna with eight spiral elements and with adopted
closed-loop tracking method gives about 15 dBi in system gain, shown in Fig. 4.9
(Left). The antenna is 30 cm in radius, 35 cm in height, and 1.5 kg in weight. The
array consists in 2 × 4 spiral elements, and it forms a fan beam with a half-power
beam width of 21° in the azimuth and 39° in the elevation plane at L-band. Its peak
gain is about 15 dBi, including the feeder losses, and is suitable to track the satellite
for MSC, because elevation angles to the satellite are not as varied as those of the
azimuth angles. In effect, the antenna beam direction can be shifted in two azimuth
directions, from the E or W side, by switching the pin diode phase shifters.
Consequently, the difference between the received signals in both directions is used
to drive the antenna system toward the satellite. The beam-shifting angle is set to
approximately 4°.
4.5.3.6
Patch Array Antennas
The main feature of the future MSC systems will be portability and transportability,
which means that a person can directly access the satellite to establish a link using a
very small TES transceiver with antenna system. Even in the present Inmarsat
L-band system, great efforts have been made to develop transportable and portable
terminals with corresponding satellite antennas.
1 Two-Patch Array Antenna—This antenna for TES and briefcase portable
terminals is developed in the Inmarsat and ETS-V programs, which is shown in
Fig. 4.9 (Middle). This antenna has two microstrip patch elements (one for Rx
and another for Tx), gain is 6 dBi, EIRP is 6 dBW, and G/T is −21 dBK. The
reason for adopting separate Rx and Tx antennas is to eliminate a diplexer,
which is too large and heavy for a compact and lightweight terminal. The
antenna beam width on the lid is wide enough to point to a satellite by manual
tracking. Two microstrip patch array antennas mounted on the lid of the
briefcase TES transceiver for low-speed data transmission serve the Inmarsat
and ETS-V TES mobile terminals.
2 Four-Patch Array Antenna—Several four-element patch array transportable
antennas were developed for universal Inmarsat-C and other TES terminals. On
the other hand, JPL and NASA designed similar L-band types of mobile
antennas, mainly for LMSC regional utilities in the USA. These include a

Directional Medium-Gain Antennas (MGA)

mechanically steered, tilted 1 × 4 patch array and two electrically steered planar
phased-array antennas. The mechanically steered four-square patch arrays can
be ﬁxed in one line, similar to two-patch array, or can have the shape of a four
circular patch array manually steered antenna, whose arrangement is shown in
Fig. 4.9 (Right). All three of these medium-gain antennas feature beams that are
narrow in azimuth angle; hence, they require azimuth steering to keep the beam
pointed toward the desired satellite as a mobile changes its azimuth orientation.
They provide 9–12 dBi gain, reject multipath signals outside their beam pattern,
and allow two communication satellites separated by 30° in a GEO arc to reuse
the same frequency to cover the continental US region. A dither-tracking
four-element, circular, polarized array for AMSC/MSAT terminals has been
designed, which is 10.16 cm high and 50.8 cm in diameter, with 20–60° ele-
vation coverage and with a minimum of 10 dBi gain. In fact, this antenna
employs a kind of closed loop for tracking the satellite in azimuth. The rotating
antenna platform is mounted on the ﬁxed platform that includes the motor drive
and pointing system hardware.
4.5.3.7
Phased-Array Antenna
A phase antenna array is a set of 2 or more antennas in one antenna complex, in
which the relative phases of the respective signals feeding the antennas are set in
such a way that the effective radiation pattern of the array is reinforced in a desired
direction and suppressed in undesired directions. The signals from the antennas are
combined or processed in order to achieve improved performance over that of a
single antenna.
Phased-array antennas were developed for maritime, land, and aeronautical
applications to provide a design for a thin satellite antenna that can be installed on
board land vehicles and aircraft. Otherwise, these mobile antennas were developed
initially for aircraft and are well known for their complexity and high cost. As a
result, emphasis was placed on the selection of manufacturing techniques, materi-
als, and component types, in addition to meeting the RF and pointing requirements
and keeping the cost down.
As mentioned previously, the radiation pattern of an array antenna is ﬁxed;
however, the radiation pattern can be scanned in space by controlling the phase of
the exciting electrical current in each element of the array. This type of antenna is
called a phased-array antenna, which has many advantages in terms of MSC
applications such as compactness, lightweight, high-speed tracking performance,
and potentially low cost.
1. Phased-Array Antenna for AMSC—A directional medium-gain antenna is
considered a key technology in aeronautical industry. This type of antenna was
developed and tested by CRL for the ETS-V antenna program. At the same time,
Inmarsat operator approved all aeronautical antenna standards for installations
on board commercial and military aircraft as above cockpit equipment (ACE).

Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

In this sense, taking account of the electrical and mechanical requirements of
AMSC, a phased array with low-proﬁle antenna elements was chosen for a
directional main antenna, while a microstrip antenna was chosen as an antenna
element because of its very low proﬁle, very lightweight, and mechanical
strength, which satisfy the requirements of airborne antenna. However, one
disadvantage is the very narrow frequency bandwidth, usually 2–3 %. The
antenna adopted is a two-frequency resonant element because it provides a
compact array and a simple feed line conﬁguration.
On the other hand, this type of antenna has very poor axial ratio values. The
problem was overcome by using the sequential array technique, where a thin
substrate with high dielectric constant is used over a wide frequency bandwidth
with excellent axial ratios. The microstrip phased-array antenna is mounted on
top of the fuselage and has two planes with 16 circular patch elements, 2 of
which are in elevation and 8 in azimuth, illustrated in Fig. 4.10 (Left). In
practice, the required coverage angles are as narrow as +20°, so the beams are
not steered in elevation directions and the array plane is set at 65° to the horizon
in order to optimize the beam coverage on the ﬂight routes. Thus, by controlling
eight 4-bit digital phase shifters, the antenna beam scans in a 4° step with +60°
with respect to a line perpendicular to the axis of the aircraft. In addition, a step
track method was adopted to track the satellite. Therefore, this array has the
following characteristics: 2 L-band Tx and Rx frequencies; polarization is
LHCP; gain is 14.7 dBi for Tx and 13.5 dBi for Rx; EIRP is about 30 dBW,
G/T −10.8 dBK; the axial ratio is about 2 dB; volume is 760 (l) × 320
(w) × 180 (h) mm; and the weight is 18 kg.
2 Phased-Array Antenna for MMSC—The new shipborne phased-array
antenna has been developed for utilization on board big oceangoing vessels.
Besides other directional types of shipborne antenna, this unit is designed to
serve as above deck unit (ADE) of the Nera F77 transceiver or other brand SES
for new Inmarsat Fleet 77 service. The Nera F77 antenna is a mechanically
steered circular disk with 32 low-proﬁle radiating elements arranged in two
circles with 16 and 12 elements, and 4 elements are located in the middle of the
disk, which is shown in Fig. 4.10 (Right). The ADE unit can be mounted on a
mast or directly on the deck and is covered by a radome. The dimensions of
antenna mast mount are 180 × 132 cm with a weight of 65 kg, and
deck-mounted antennas are 108 × 91 cm and 50 kg in weight. The gain of the
antenna is about 15 dBi in both transmission satellite links.

3. Breadboard Phased-Array Antenna for LMSC—The breadboard mobile
phased-array antennas have been developed in the USA to meet the L-band
frequency requirements, 20°–60° elevation and full 360° azimuth angles of
special coverage, gain of 10 dBi above 30° in elevation and 8 dBi at 20° in
elevation, half-power bandwidth of 25° in azimuth and 35° in elevation, inter-
satellite signal isolation of 20 dB between two GEO separated by circa 35°, and
beam-pointing accuracy of +5°. Two phased-array antennas were developed for
LMSC: Ball and Teledyne designs shown in Fig. 4.11 (Left) and (Middle),
respectively. Each antenna consists of 19 low-proﬁle radiating elements, with 18
3-bit diode phase shifters. The Ball company model uses dual-resonant stacked
circular microstrip elements to cover both the Tx- and Rx-bands, while the
Teledyne company model employs stripling crossed-slot radiators. For the
antenna’s beam-pointing system, the initial acquisition of the satellite is
accomplished by a full azimuth search for the strongest received signal. An
angular rate sensor is used to establish an inertial reference point when the
acquisition is performed while the mobile is turning.
Tests show that the antenna can acquire a reference pilot signal in two seconds
from a random spatial position. After the desired satellite signal has been acquired,
the antenna tracks the satellite by a closed-loop sequential lobing technique. In the
event of severe signal fade due to shadowing, the sequential lobing can no longer
function properly. In this case, the open-loop angular rate sensor takes over the
pointing for a 10-s period, until the sensor drifts away. This antenna with all the
radiated
elements,
hybrids,
diode
phase
shifters,
pin
diode
drivers,
and
power/combiner driver (except diplexer) can be mounted on the roof of a land
vehicle cabin. Thus, based on the research experiments of the airborne phased-array
antenna, a new phased-array car antenna has been proposed by CRL. The antenna
was installed on a test van and tracks the ETS-V satellite at an elevation angle of
47°. The receiving signal from the satellite was almost constant except for shad-
owing and blocking effects. The gain of this antenna is 10 and 18 dBi for elevations
of 30° and 90°, respectively, the system temperature is about 200 K, axial ratio is
4 dB for 30° of elevation, the volume is 60 × 4 cm, and weight is 5 kg.

4.5.3.8
Adaptive Array Antennas
The
antenna for
the
MSAT program
of
LMSC
was
developed
by the
Canadian CRC. Linearly and circularly polarized arrays with gain values of 9–11
and 10–13 dBi, respectively, have been designed and evaluated in trials using the
ex-Marecs-B satellite.
Both antennas use L-band with spatial coverage of 15°–50° elevation and 360°
azimuth angles. The satellite tracking is initially acquired with a closed-loop
method of stepping through 16 azimuth beam positions and selecting the beam with
the strongest signal. In the event that the signal falls below a given threshold, the
acquisition sequence is again initiated until the signal is required.
The speed of operation is determined by the terminal C/N0 ratio and the value of
S/N requirements in the control loop bandwidth, which takes 0.1 s to acquire the
satellite after an initial phase look. Otherwise, tracking of the satellite is performed
by periodically switching on either side of the current beam position and selecting
the beam with the strongest signal. A number of algorithms have been devised to
minimize any perturbation of the communications signal to less than 1 % of the time.
The main characteristics of this type of antenna are as follows: Operating RF is
from 1.530 to 1.660 GHz; spatial coverage is 15°–50° elevation and 360° azimuth;
gain is 9–11 dBi for linear and 10–13 dBi for circular model; and the size of both
models is about 61 cm diameter, while the linear is 6.3 cm and circular is 20.3 cm
high, respectively. Thus, the maximum phase transients in azimuth can be kept to
less than ±10° over the required angular coverage and operating frequency band.
Here will be introduced two the following types of adaptive array antennas:
1. Linearly Polarized Adaptive Array Antenna—This antenna consists essen-
tially of a driven quarter-wave monopole surrounded by concentric rings of
parasitic elements all mounted on a ground plane of ﬁnite size. The parasitic
elements are connected to the ground through pin diodes. With the application of
suitable biasing voltages, the desired parasitic elements can be activated and
made highly reﬂective. The directivity and pointing of the antenna beam can be
controlled both in the elevation and in the azimuth planes using high-speed
digital switching techniques. The use of a circular polarizer in the linearly
polarized design can realize an increase in gain at the expense of an increase in
antenna height. The polarizer has an elliptical cross section, a diameter of 40 cm,
and a height of 20 cm. It consists of a number of conformal scattering matrices to
achieve the 90° differential phase shift between two orthogonal polarizations. Part
of a ﬁve-ring linearly polarized antenna is shown in Fig. 4.11c. The antenna
incorporates sufﬁcient electronics to control the radiation patterns and pointing
on command. It is designed to serve MSAT and AMSC transceivers and to be
mounted on the metallic roof of a vehicle, where the effective ground plane can
signiﬁcantly enhance antenna gain at low elevation angles.

2. Circularly Polarized Adaptive Array Antenna—This type of adaptive array
is similar to linear adaptive array and hence is obtained by adding the linearly
polarized array. With good cross-polarized isolation, it enables frequency reuse
using polarization diversity.
4.6
High-Gain Directional Aperture Antennas
High-gain directional aperture antennas are more powerful transmission reﬂectors
and panels used for Inmarsat maritime and transportable applications. The typical
gain of these antennas is more than 20 dBi, EIRP is a maximum of 33 dBW, and
G/T is about −4 dBK. There are few basic types of directional parabolic antennas:
parabolic dish antenna, which uses parabolic reﬂector outside or inside radome, and
umbrella antenna. The new antenna solution for Inmarsat transportable satellite
units is known as a quad ﬂat panel antenna designed by the South African-based
company OmniPless, which is introduced in the next section.
1. Parabolic Dish Antenna—The ﬁrst generation of parabolic dish antennas used
a reﬂector in diameter of max 1.2 m, whereas on newer models it is likely to
have reduced in size to approximately 0.7–0.8 m, which is illustrated in
Fig. 4.12 (Left). Because a large proportion of the Rx signal gain and Tx EIRP
is produced by the antenna, the area of the dish can only be reduced if the
transmitting power from the satellite transponder is increased, when the receive
preampliﬁer gain can be increased without an appreciable increase in noise.
The parabolic reﬂector is most often used for high directivity for radio signals
traveling in straight lines, as do light rays. They can also be focused and reﬂected
just as light rays can; namely, a microwave source can be placed at focal point of
antenna reﬂector. The ﬁeld leaves this antenna as a spherical wave front. As each
part of the wave front reaches the reﬂecting surface, it is phase-shifted 180°. Each
part is then sent outward at an angle that results in all parts of the ﬁeld traveling in
Fig. 4.12 High-gain directional aperture antennas—Courtesy of Book: by Ilcev

Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

parallel paths. Due to the special shape of a parabolic surface, all paths from the
focus to the reﬂector and back into space line are the same length. When the parts
of the ﬁeld are reﬂected from the parabolic surface, they travel to the space line in
the same amount of time. This antenna is a large microwave parabolic consisting
of the reﬂector of dish shape, feeder structure, waveguide assembly, servo and
drive system, and protective radome.
Stable platform supports an antenna assembly, which must remain perfectly
stable when MES is pitching and rolling in extremely bad weather conditions.
Namely, it is essential that the stable platform holds the reﬂector in its A/E
angular positions despite movement of the ship. The platform usually consists of
a large solid bed mounted in such a way that four gyrocompasses are able to
sense movement and correct any errors detected, holding the platform level. In
practice, it is a form of electronic gimbal.
The antenna tracking system is controlled in A/E angles by stepping motors,
which in turn are electronically controlled in a simple feedback system. This
electromechanical antenna enables the dish to maintain a lock on a satellite
despite navigation course changes. As the MES changes course, both A and E
control corrections are made automatically.
The antenna unit processor controls all necessary functions, which include
satellite tracking and electronic control. The RF electronics segment contains the
Tx HPA and the Rx RF front-end LNA stage, plus all the critical bandpass signal
ﬁlter stage. In modern equipment, it is common practice to reduce the number of
cables between antenna and main unit. Hence, this is achieved by multiplexing
up/down signals or commands between antenna and main unit onto the one
coaxial feeder. This type of antenna can be used for aeronautical broadcasting
and broadband mobile and ﬁxed DVB units and for communications antennas
between references with master stations of GNSS augmentation network.
2. Parabolic Dish Antenna in Radome—For MSC service, radomes are widely
used to protect dish antennas, which are continually tracking satellites while the
ship or aircraft experiences pitch, roll, and yaw movements. The sample of
shipborne reﬂector dish antenna is shown in Fig. 4.12 (Middle), whose
motorized elevation drive system is conﬁgured to selectively adjust an elevation
of the satellite dish and a motorized azimuth drive system can be conﬁgured to
selectively rotate the satellite dish. A control system is connected to the ele-
vation and the azimuth drive systems managing automated operation of the
satellite antenna system. Large ships may have radomes over 3 m in diameter
covering antennas for broadband, TV, voice, data, video, and Internet. Recent
developments allow similar services from smaller installations such as up to
85-cm motorized dish used in the maritime and land applications, while air-
craftborne antennas are using more aerodynamically shaped radomes for
installation atop fuselage or inside tail without radome. Small ships, ﬁshing
vessels, and private yachts may use radomes as small as 26 cm in diameter for
voice and low-speed data. However, buses and trains can have low-proﬁle
parabolic TV antenna in radome.

3. Parabolic Umbrella Antenna—This type of portable antenna is a deployable,
compact, and lightweight parabolic type suitable for portable and transportable
Inmarsat transceivers, shown in Fig. 4.9 (Right). Otherwise, this antenna has
almost all the same technical characteristics as a parabolic dish antenna.
4.7
Antenna Systems for Particular MSC
Typical MSC systems are Inmarsat, AMSC, MSAT, Optus, and others in which the
L-band 1.6/1.5 GHz MSA are used for the service link. The Big LEO systems use S-
and L-bands (2.5/1.6) and Little LEO uses VHF band. The only exceptions are
US-based OmniTRACS and EutelTRACS in which the MSA antenna is serviced in
the 14/12 GHz Ku-band, the Japanese N-Star service link uses 2.6/2.5 GHz S-band
MSA, and some new advanced MSS will operate on 30/18 K- and Ka-bands.
A typical satellite navigation system GPS uses 1.6 and 1.3 L-band for transmission
in satellite-to-Earth direction. In addition, an antenna system for ships, land vehicles,
and aircraft has been developed to receive TV programs. In general, the biggest
mobile satellite operator, Inmarsat, developed four types of MSA for maritime, land,
aeronautical, transportable, and ﬁxed applications, while in particular, some mar-
itime MSA are used or transformed for land vehicles and off/onshore installations.
4.7.1
Shipborne Satellite Antennas
The Ship Earth Station (SES) antennas are more sophisticated than other MSA
owing to the huge ship structures, different ship’s motions, and rugged environ-
ment. The MSA systems are designed by Inmarsat operator according to SES
standards, which have been developed since 1981 (see four types of MSA in
Fig. 4.13).

Previous Inmarsat Maritime Communication Antenna
Standards
Inmarsat-A standard was used from 1982 to 2007 as a ﬁrst operating analog SES,
while existing Inmarsat-B, M, and mini-M will be in service until its end-of-life
date, which is the December 30, 2016. In the meantime were developed Inmarsat
standards Fleet 33, 55, and 77, which will be still in operation, while mini-M will be
replaced by new developed Fleet One. These previous hugely popular Inmarsat
maritime services are of course now being replaced by most shipping companies
with the hugely popular FleetBroadband service, which offers quite greater speeds
and much lower cost channels for both voice and data packages. All above-stated
Inmarsat standards are using L-band frequency spectrum; however, new Inmarsat-5
satellite constellation is providing the next generation in maritime VSAT antenna
with deployment of Inmarsat Global Xpress Ku- and Ka-band service.
1. Inmarsat-B/Fleet MSA—The Inmarsat-B SES was deployed in 1993 as ﬁrst
digital maritime standard using the second generation of Inmarsat-2 GEO
satellites,
which
were
decommissioned
in
December
2014.
However,
Inmarsat-B standard will be replaced by FleetBroadband or VSAT on December
30, 2016. The next standard Inmarsat Fleet 77 has been introduced in 2002 and
Fleet 55 and 33 in 2003 using third generation of Inmarsat-3 satellites. Both
Inmarsat-A and -B standards are compatible for mounting on board large ships,
sea platforms, and onshore infrastructures. They use same high-gain parabolic
steerable dish with the same features: Gain is from 20 to 24 dBi, and G/T is –4
dBK. The EIRP of Inmarsat-B is less than that of Inmarsat-A by 3 dB, due to
the slightly shaped global beam antenna adopted in the Inmarsat-2 satellites.
Considering the desired EIRP and the noise performance of current LNA, the
Inmarsat-B EIRP of 33 dBW can be obtained by the antenna with a gain of
about 20 dBi. For both standards is suitable an aperture antenna such as a
directional parabolic dish with high aperture efﬁciency. In Fig. 4.14 (Left) is
shown rear side and (Right) shows proﬁle of the Inmarsat-B SES antenna ele-
ments with antenna control unit (ACU), pedestal control unit (PCU), and
antenna control board (ACB), produced by Norwegian company Nera. In 2006,
Nera merged with Danish Thrane and Thrane, and in 2012, both became part of
UK Cobham.
Inmarsat Fleet family of SES was announced by Inmarsat during 2002 as the
ﬁrst new dedicated Inmarsat SMC system since the development of Inmarsat-B
in 1993, which is providing oceangoing vessels with comprehensive global
voice, data, and fax service, whose comparison with A and B antenna standards
is presented in Table 4.3. As with Inmarsat-B, the Inmarsat Fleet F77 service
also provides GMDSS distress and safety communications.
In Fig. 4.15 (Left) is illustrated 1-m parabolic stabilized reﬂector dish with the
main components of Inmarsat-B antenna, while in Fig. 4.15 (Right) is shown
Inmarsat-F or precisely Fleet 77 phased-array antennas with main components,
both produced by Nera.

Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

The Inmarsat-F 33, 55, and 77 provide further services within the Fleet family,
each aimed at speciﬁc sectors of the Maritime industry serving different types of
merchant ﬂeet. The F77 SES antenna has the following speciﬁcations: G/T is
−17 dB/K minimum, EIRP is 8–14 dBW in 2 dB steps, antenna cable has
TNC/TNC female, and maximum cable loss is 15 dB at L-band and 1.8 O at
DC. In addition, antenna is providing high-speed data (HSD) at a speed of about
128, 64, and 56 Kb/s data service. Speech is offering high-quality voice con-
nections (it is the service simulated by Vox Maris), and 3.1 kHz audio for
analogue signal transmission like fax or modems and also antenna provides
transmission of mobile packed data service (MPDS) for the ﬁrst time, whose
tariff depends on the amount of data sent and received.
The B/Fleet family antenna stabilization is achieved by using the three-axis
active method that detects the different ship’s motions with three rate sensors
and an inclinometer. These antennas are simple in their structure and can be
designed ﬂexibly with respect to the gain values larger than 20 dBi. Satellite
tracking is an essential capability for ship’s motions and the small half-power
beam width of about 10°. The four-axis (X-Y-A-E) stabilizer is the one most
commonly used, when a ﬁxed horizontal plane is obtained by controlling motion
about the x- and y-axes and an antenna system installed on the x-y plane can be
stabilized by controlling the a- and e-axes. The antenna is directed to the satellite
by controlling the a- and e-axes. It needs antenna pedestal control circuits with
servomotors to control the axes and it also needs some sensors, such as an
accelerometer, a rate sensor, and a level sensor, to provide information about
ship motions. A ﬂywheel stabilizer has sometimes been used in order to avoid
the need for antenna control sensors and electronic circuits. This kind of sta-
bilizer makes use of the inertial force generated by one or two rapidly rotating
ﬂywheels. Thus, a three-axis stabilizer was developed and used in some recent
standards A and B, while the present standards have generally used a
closed-loop tracking system because of their very simple conﬁguration. The
most popular open-loop tracking is a step-tracking method, which drives in
elevation and azimuth directions alternatively by a step angle of 0.5° in such a
way as to keep the received signal level as high as possible.
2. Inmarsat-M MSA—This standard was initiated in 1993 as a solution for small,
light, and low-cost SES for installation on small ships, land vehicles, and rural
infrastructures, whose antenna is shown in Fig. 4.16 (Left). The antenna
applicable to this system can be a single medium-gain directional parabolic SBF
dish or a phased array with an antenna gain that ranges from 13 to 16 dBi. For
the medium-gain parabolic dish antenna, it will be difﬁcult to illuminate the
parabolic efﬁciency with the primary radiator because the diameter of this
antenna is smaller than a high-gain antenna. In fact, this type of antenna is not
adequate for the Inmarsat-M compared to other types of antennas with high
aperture efﬁciency, such as SBF antenna. Traveling-wave antennas, such as the
cross-Yagi/Uda array, a single helical antenna, and a log-periodic antenna, have
high efﬁciency for medium-gain performances. Since those types of antennas are
4.7
Antenna Systems for Particular MSC
339

comparatively long in their axial direction, the volume of the radome becomes
fairly large and conﬂicts with the requirements of Inmarsat-M. This antenna
needs a suitable mount/steering system on board ships. The SBF antenna, with
typical gain of 15 dBi, is one of the favorite standard M antennas for SES.
Although
the
SBF
antenna
is
a
compact,
simple
conﬁguration,
and
high-efﬁciency shipborne antenna, it has a narrow frequency bandwidth of about
3 % (about 5 % less than required). The electrical characteristics of the con-
ventional SBF have been improved in an upgraded SBF antenna by changing
the main reﬂector from a ﬂat disk to a conical or a step plate and by adding a
small second reﬂector. These improvements give better performance with an
aperture efﬁciency of about 80 % and an RF bandwidth of 20 % for VSWR
under 1.5, and gain is also improved by about 1 dB without changing sidelobe
levels. Inmarsat-M was replaced by FleetBroadband or VSAT on December 30,
2014.
3. Inmarsat mini-M MSA—The Inmarsat mini-M SES introduced in 1997 offers
the same service as Inmarsat-M but in smaller, more lightweight and compact
unit and antenna for mounting on small ships and land vehicles, whose antenna
is shown in Fig. 4.16 (Right). This SES can be made smaller because it operates
only in the spot beam coverage, whose typical representative is TT-3064A
Capsat SES, designed by Thrane and Thrane. Its antenna is three-axis stabilized
platform with a minimum of moveable parts, and all motors, sensors, and
electronics are mounted in the bottom bowl. Antenna pointing is controlled by
various sensors and a step-tracking algorithm for signal level peaking. It does
not require cable unwrapping but can track the satellite in any position above the
horizon, and it is connected to the transceiver through a single coaxial cable to
ensure simple installation. Inmarsat mini-M will be replaced by FleetBroadband
or IsatPhone Marine on December 30, 2016

The sensors in the antenna are as follows:
(a) 3D compass (magnetometer) which measures the Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld
vector;
(b) 2D inclinometer which measures the vessel’s roll and pitch angles; and
(c) Gyro that measures the vessel’s yaw, pitch, and roll rates.
The sensor stabilization of the antenna pointing compensates for the fast
movements of the ship. In case of a no signal situation, the sensors are able to point
the antenna independently, but in all other situations, a step-tracking algorithm
maximizes the strength of the received signal. The antenna has step-tracking and
sky-scan modes of normal operation:
1. During step-tracking mode, the platform tracks the satellite using the sensors
and the step-tracking algorithm. If synchronism with the satellite is lost for more
than 130 s, the sky-scan mode is entered to reacquire synchronism with the
satellite.
2. The sky-scan mode is automatically entered during the initial acquisition of a
satellite after power-up, when a different satellite is selected by the user or the
signal has been lost for more than 130 s. During a sky-scan, the antenna pointing
is moved over the sky from horizon to zenith in a smooth spiral movement and
stabilized by the sensors, searching for a particular satellite. Therefore, when the
satellite is found, the antenna exits the sky-scan mode and enters step-tracking
mode. Sensor-stabilized platforms work with directional RHCP antennas.
Maximum pointing error is ±10° and beam width ±30°. The value of G/T is
minimum −17 dBK, and EIRP is from 8 to 14 dBW in 2 dB steps.
3. Inmarsat-C and mini-C MSA—This MSA system is the simplest and has most
compact conﬁguration without mount of tracking and pointing systems, intro-
duced in 1990 as the second Inmarsat SES standard, whose antenna shape is
shown in Fig. 4.17 (Left). The omnidirectional low-gain antennas are the most
suitable for this mobile standard, such as cross-drooping dipole, quadriﬁlar

Thrane/SkyWave

341

helix, and the microstrip patch antennas. In fact, the quadriﬁlar antenna is well
known as a shipborne antenna because of its good performance and axial ratios
in wide angular coverage, with about 4 dBi in gain, maximum 3 dB in axial
ratio, −24 dBK in G/T, and 14 dBW EIRP. The Inmarsat-C MSA is suitable for
installation on board medium and small ships, land vehicles, and rural
infrastructures.
4. Inmarsat-D and D+ MSA—The Inmarsat-D (receiver), D+, and IsatData Pro
(ISP) Inmarsat (transceivers) standards were developed in 1996, 1997, and
2011, respectively, whose omnidirectional antenna is illustrated in Fig. 4.17
(Right). These three standards use omnidirectional small low-gain antenna
similar to that introduced for Inmarsat-C, with the only difference that is smaller
and more compact and with the G/T value of −25 dBK.
Besides, this antenna can be a separate unit in the smallest radome for
Inmarsat-D+ or ISP transceiver, or the antenna can be built-in a small radome
together with the Inmarsat-D+ or ISP transceiver and GPS Rx antenna made by
Canadian-based SkyWave. These antennas are serving equipment similar to paging
systems for vessels or vehicle messaging and SCADA Rx/transceivers equipment.
Therefore, both IsatM2M and IsatData Pro Inmarsat solutions were developed
from initial Inmarsat-D+ system and they can be used for all mobile and ﬁxed SAT
applications. The global IsatM2M satellite network is able to offer better service
than Inmarsat-D+ system, whose examples for maritime applications include: tracks
geographic location of ﬂeets, ﬁnds deviation from predeﬁned geofenced areas,
monitors ship locations worldwide, sends PVT data to the special shore ship trafﬁc
control, and enables polling by request from shore to be obtained data of any ship in
certain sailing area.
4.7.1.2
New Inmarsat Maritime Communication Antenna Standards
Inmarsat Maritime-B, M, and mini-M terminals are replaced by the new Inmarsat
standards known as FleetBroadband (FB) and Fleet One (F1), which use Inmarsat-4
satellites, and last developed is Global Xpress (GX) that may use Inmarsat-5
satellite constellation.
1. Inmarsat-FB MSA—The FleetBroadband (FB) was launched by Inmarsat
sometimes in 2007 providing high-speed Internet connectivity, crew IP solu-
tions in parallel with e-mail, Web, data, VPN, and voice calling at sea. It enables
tracking and telemetry functionality, so shippers on shore have all the infor-
mation they need about voyage, ETA, cargo operations, real-time engine data
for maintenance, drilling data for improving production or position data for ﬂeet
tracking and management and so on. There are two terminal types deﬁned and
type-approved for the FleetBroadband service utilizing Inmarsat-4 satellite
constellation at L-band. They are referred to as Class 8 (high-gain antenna
“FB500”) and Class 9 (low-gain antenna “FB250” and “FB 150”) terminals.
342

Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

The key difference between Class 8 and Class 9 is the antenna. Therefore, for
each type of FB terminal, Inmarsat deﬁnes:
1. The air interface at the output of the terminal’s antenna;
2. The mandatory features and service types for each class of user terminal; and
3. The performance requirements of the user terminal.
The Sailor 500 FB transceiver uses the TT-3052A antenna, which is a maritime
Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) antenna that complies with
Inmarsat’s Class 8 deﬁnition for ship antenna illustrated in Fig. 4.18 (Left). This
antenna is larger and provides more bandwidth than the TT-3050A used for the
Sailor 250 FB system.
This antenna contains all functions for satellite tracking including a GPS system.
A single coaxial cable carries all RF communication, supply voltage, and
modem communication between the antenna and the terminal. Manufacturers
must meet all of these requirements in order to obtain type-approved antennas.
The deﬁnition of other equipment features such as physical connections, user
interfaces, ﬁrewalling, routing, and control is determined by each manufacturer
according to speciﬁc market-driven needs. Because of the possibility of different
physical interfaces on terminals from different manufacturers, users should pay
particular attention to the installation guidelines for different terminal conﬁgu-
rations and features. A summary of the features of each of three FleetBroadband
terminals is shown in Table 4.4, entitled “Summary of FleetBroadband
Terminal Features.”
From above table is evident that only FB 500 HGA provides more than 20 dBW
EIRP and uses integrated services for digital network (ISDN) mode.
2. Inmarsat-F1 MSA—The Fleet One (F1) transceiver is complement to the new
Inmarsat Fleet One service, which utilizes the existing Inmarsat-4 satellites at
L-band RF to deliver voice and data connectivity ideal for use on board ﬁshing
vessels, boats, and luxury ships, whose antenna is shown in Fig. 4.18 (Middle).
With its compact, lightweight antenna and simple installation, F1 is a low-cost
solution for maritime satellite broadband that keeps oceangoing ships connected
at all times. The Sailor F1 system uses small-size maritime 2-axis stabilized

3. Inmarsat GX MSA—The Global Xpress (GX) is the newest Inmarsat standard
that uses the last constellation of Inmarsat-5 satellites at Ka-band RF, whose
Cobham Sailor 100 GX satellite reﬂector antenna with radome is illustrated in
Fig. 4.18 (Right). This light and compact light antenna is an advanced 3-axis
stabilized tracking system designed for the Inmarsat GX satellite network. It is a
direct development from the immensely successful Sailor 900 VSAT antenna
systems, which have created a new industry standard through innovative design
and reliable operation. The GX antenna features advanced tracking receiver
technology that enables it to verify the right satellite in less than a second. It uses
a single cable between satellite antenna known as above deck equipment
(ADE) and transceiver with peripherals known as below deck equipment
(BDE) for RF, power, and data, while advanced features such as automatic
azimuth calibration (home ﬂag) and automatic cable calibration signiﬁcantly

Inmarsat Maritime Multiband VSAT and TVRO Antenna
Standards
Inmarsat as the biggest GEO mobile satellite operator developed the following new
antenna standards for maritime applications, which includes multiband Ku and
Ka-band VSAT and own TV Receive-Only (TVRO) antennas for TV programs on
board ships:
1. Multiband VSAT Antenna—Intellian Company has launched in 2012 a new
Ku-band VSAT antenna, which will be upgradeable for use with existing
Inmarsat Global Xpress (GX) Ka-band after that service is launched. Thus, the
1 m, 3-Axis Ku-band v110GX antenna features an optimized Ku and Ka-band
antenna reﬂector and radome which today can be “easily” changed to be used
with the GX service, because Inmarsat’s I-5 Ka-band satellites are operational
since 2014. The modular GX Conversion Kit includes the GX BUC/LNB
assembly, GX Feed Assembly and GX ACU, incorporating the modem. The
pedestal and new mounting architecture has also been designed to support
conversion to Ka-band by manually replacing the RF Module and Feedhorn
inside the radome.
4.7
Antenna Systems for Particular MSC
345

The GX BUC/LNB assembly is attached to the rear side of the reﬂector, with no
special requirement to rebalance the system. Once the ACU is replaced and
power is supplied, the system will be immediately ready and operational for the
GX service. A gyro-free satellite search function enables the v110GX to acquire
and lock onto the satellite without requiring separate input from the ship’s
gyrocompass.
The Intellian brand of V100GX Ku/Ka-band convertible ship antenna is shown
in Fig. 4.19 (Left). As already stated, this Ku-band antenna can be quickly
converted in as little as 10 min without the need of a factory-trained technician
to GX Ka-band antenna for Inmarsat broadband service. One would need to
replace the RF module containing the BUC and LNB units, the feed, and the
ACU to make the antenna immediately ready for Ka-band service. However, the
V100GX is available with 4, 8, and 16 W BUC sizes. All models are standard
with co-pol and cross-pol feed with Intellian’s Global PLL LNB units. The local
oscillator (LO) frequency of the Global PLL LNB unit can be remotely adjusted
to receive any Ku-band VSAT satellite around the world. The antenna radome is
optimized for minimal attenuation of both Ka- and Ku-band frequencies. The
antenna will search and ﬁnd the satellite without the need for an input from the
ship’s gyrocompass.
The ADE speciﬁcations of this antenna are as follows: radome (W × H) is
133 cm × 149 cm (52″ × 59″); dish diameter is 103 cm (41″); antenna weight
is about 128 kg (282 lbs); platform provides azimuth, elevation, and cross-level;
azimuth range is unlimited; elevation range is −20° to +115°; cross-level range
is up to ±37°; RX frequency is 10.95–12.75 GHz at Ku-band; RX gain is
39.8 dBi at mid-band; TX frequency is 13.75–14.5 GHz at Ku-band; TX gain is
41.3 dBi at mid-band; cross-pol isolation minimum is 35 dB; G/T is
>18.3 dB/K; polarization is cross-pol and co-pol; and power consumption is
100–240 V AC, 50/60 Hz, 4A.
2. TVRO Antenna—Inmarsat GEO satellite operator provides stabilized ship
antennas that deliver high-quality TV reception or TV receive-only (TVRO)
systems suitable for any region of the world. This TV antenna can be installed

on board any type and size of merchant ships, sea rigs or platforms, ﬁshing
boats, and luxury cruise vessels, which are designed to withstand the harshest
marine conditions and to continue working in even the deep seas on the globe.
Inmarsat has designed four types of shipborne stabilized TVRO antenna, such as
0.6-m ST 24 model, 1.2-m 5004 model, 1.25-m t130 W in 66.5″ radome, and
1.5-m 6004 in 76″ radome. The last 6004 type of TV antenna is illustrated in
Fig. 4.19 (Right), whose total weight is approximately 159 kg and DAC 2202 is
a control unit.
4.7.1.4
Maritime VSAT and TVRO Antennas Over GEO Satellites
The single-band and multiband VSAT antennas with transceivers provide ﬁxed and
mobile two-way or interactive satellite communications for new voice, data, and
video over IP (VDVoverIP) and Internet service via GEO satellites. Thus,
DVB-RCS VSAT standards in the maritime market are delivered as packaged
solutions including GEO satellite space segment, ADE, and BDE with peripherals.
The VSAT services historically have operated at Ku- and C-bands for the com-
mercial and luxury maritime market, using satellites located at the GEO orbital
location. Due to the location of the satellites in combination with the movement of
vessels, stabilized antennas with tracking are required. A stabilized maritime VSAT
antenna typically has a circular antenna (often concealed within a dome) that is
2.4 m or smaller in diameter. The majority of maritime VSAT antennas range from
60 cm to 1.5 m for Ku-band and 2.4 m for C-band. Data rates typically range from
64 Kb/s up to 8 Mb/s, but lower and much higher data rates are available. A remote
maritime VSAT system typically consists of two parts: antenna and transceiver
placed outdoors (typically inside a radome)—in maritime, this can be referred to as
the above deck equipment (ADE). An indoor unit interacts with the outdoor unit
and controls the antenna, which in maritime can be referred to as the below deck
equipment (BDE).
The term “TVRO” has been in use on ships since it was introduced in the 1980s.
One early provider of equipment was SeaTel with its ﬁrst generation of stabilized
satellite antennas that was launched in 1985, the TV-at-Sea 8885 system. Until this
time, ships had not been able to receive TV signals from satellites due to their
rocking motion rendering reception impossible. The SeaTel antenna was stabilized
using electrically driven gyroscope and thus made it possible to point to the satellite
accurate enough, that is to within 2°, in order to receive a signal. The successful
implementation of stabilized TVRO systems on ships immediately led to the
development of maritime VSAT systems. The second generation of SeaTel TVRO
systems came in 1994 and was the 2494 antenna, which got its gyros signal from
the ship rather than its own gyros, improving accuracy and reducing maintenance.
1. Sea Tel VSAT 3011 Antenna—The VSAT 3011 model is the latest 3-axis
marine an 75-cm (30 in) stabilized antenna system for sub 1-m networks, whose
reﬂector and antenna radome are shown in Fig. 4.20 (Left). It is compatible with
4.7
Antenna Systems for Particular MSC
347

Ku-band GEO satellites for maritime broadband connectivity, which incorporate
the newest frequency-tuned radome design and electronics used in our
industry-leading XX09 series systems. Its antenna platform provides stabiliza-
tion accuracy of 0.2° (RMS); transmit gain is 39 dBi at 14.25 GHz; receive gain
is 37 dBi at 11.85 GHz; G/T is 16 dB/K at 12.0 GHz (typical); elevation range
of motion is −15° to +115°; and azimuth range of motion is unlimited.
2. Sea Tel VSAT 6012 Antenna—This model is an 3-axis marine stabilized
VSAT antenna system compatible with C-band linear satellites and is powered
by integrated marine antenna (IMA) software along with trusted XX09 pedestal
design, which is shown in Fig. 4.20 (Middle). The 6012 C-band antennas are
supplied in a 2.05-m (80.5 in) radome, which feature an integrated control unit
(ICU) that offers a single box integrated electronic control to maintain the best
and most efﬁcient pointing accuracy. Speciﬁcations of this antenna are as fol-
lows: reﬂector antenna size is 1.5 m (58 in); Tx frequency is 5.850–6.725 GHz;
Rx frequency is 3.400–4.200 GHz; Tx gain is 37.9 dBi at 6.20 GHz; Rx gain is
33.3 dBi at 3.70 GHz; BUC is 25 and 40 W standard; elevation joint angle is
−15° to +115°; azimuth is unlimited; and polarization is linearly cross.
3. Sea Tel Multiband VSAT 9797B Antenna—This radical offset VSAT antenna
is most efﬁcient ever multiband C-band, X-band, and Ku-band marine stabilized
antenna system, which is illustrated in Fig. 4.20 (Right). Thus, it is both Intelsat
and Defense Satellite Communications System (DSCS) compliant antenna
model. Mariners get more throughputs using the same or lesser amount of
valuable deck space and also are available as a dual-band selectable C- and
Ku-band system for complete ﬂexibility. This antenna utilizes the DAC 2202
ACU, which is 19″ rack mount unit (1.75″ tall) with the following features: Rx
gain is 38.5 dBi at 3.95 GHz and 47.75 dBi at 11.85 GHz; Tx gain is 41.7 dBi
at 6.18 GHz and 48.45 dBi at 14.25 GHz; G/T is calculated 20.2 dB/k at
3.95 GHz and 28.2 dB/k at 11.85 GHz (clear sky, 20° elevation); radome
dimensions are 3.66 m (144 in) D × 4.17 m (164 in) H; sidelobes are 100 %
below 29–25 log mask; and compliant to DSCS requirements is X-band G/T
>22 db/k at 7.5 GHz.

system conﬁgurations in C-, Ku-, and Ka-bands, shown in Fig. 4.21 (Left). As a
common platform, it is inherently designed to accommodate the current and
future broadband needs of the maritime market. This antenna is built for quick
and easy installation, upgrade, and maintenance, combining exceptional RF
performance and system availability with an extraordinarily small footprint. It
supports the mission and business-critical broadband solution needs of com-
mercial and naval vessels. This design comprises two product series:
(a) OceanTRx 7-300 features multiband frequency support for C- and Ku-bands
and (b) the OceanTRx 7-500 500 Series features built-in Ka-band fully com-
patible design to ensure smooth migration to future high-speed Ka-band ser-
vices, for the entire Ka-band range using GEO and MEO satellites. The
multiband 7-500 antennas provide multiband frequency support for Ku- and
Ka-bands, based on ﬁeld exchangeable kits.
5. Orbit Multiband VSAT OceanTRx 4 Antenna—OceanTRx 4 is an innova-
tive antenna platform supporting a variety of 1.15 m stabilized maritime antenna
system conﬁgurations in X-, Ku-, and Ka-bands, which is shown in Fig. 4.21
(Right). As a common platform, this antenna is inherently designed to accom-
modate commercial and military maritime applications. It features outstanding
RF performance, system availability, and dynamic response under virtually any
sea conditions. Its 500 Series features built-in Ka-band fully compatible design
to ensure smooth migration to future high-speed Ka-band using GEO and MEO
satellites
6. Sea Tel ST144 Multiband TVRO Antenna—This shipborne antenna is one of
the top 3.6-m (144″) TV-at-Sea system, whose reﬂector, radome design, RF
components, and the pedestal are based on Sea Tel well-proven 14400B system,
which is shown in Fig. 4.22 (Left). This antenna is the preferred system for
users who need the largest possible offshore operating area, for large vessels
operating in deep oceans and compatible with all current and planned GEO
satellites. The level cage used in the predecessor systems has also been replaced
by high-accuracy accelerometers. Thus, this allows for continuous calculation of
position, orientation, and velocity vector of a moving object without the need for
external references. The micro electromechanical (MEM) sensors used in Sea

Tel’s antennas are based on the same technology currently being used in missile
and aerospace technology around the world. Much like its predecessor, the
ST144 is available in C-band and Ku-band conﬁgurations or “dual-band”
conﬁguration that permits the same antenna to be used for both. This antenna
has the following features: antenna gain at C-band is 42.2 dB at 4.2 GHz and at
Ku-band is 49.6 dB at 12.5 GHz; minimum EIRP at C-band is 28 dBW and at
Ku-band is 32–33 dBW; radome dimensions are 4.27 m (168 in) D × 4.21 m
(165.7 in) H; antenna stabilization is 3-axis servo; built-in GPS is automatic
satellite acquisition; ship’s motion is ±15° roll or ±20° roll and ±15° pitch; full
elevation range is −15° to +115°; azimuth range is unlimited; the entire fre-
quency range for Ku-band satellite TV is 10.7–12.75 GHz; and the C-band
frequency range is 3.7–4.2 GHz worldwide.
7. Orbit AL-7205 Multiband TVRO Antenna—This is 1.5-m (59″) quad
Ku-band or dual C-band marine stabilized orbit TVRO antenna, which is
illustrated in Fig. 4.22 (Right). It is designed to maintain constant TV reception
on board all kind of oceangoing ships and sea platforms via both Ku-band and
C-band satellites at RF of 3.7–4.2 and 10.7–12.75 GHZ. Its antenna speciﬁca-
tions are as follows: antenna gain is 34 dB at 4.2 GHz and 43 dB at 12.75 GHz;
system EIRP is 32 dBW at 4.2 GHz and 40 dBW at 12.75 GHz.
4.7.1.5
Maritime Antenna Standards Over MEO Satellites
The new OceanTRx 7-500 2.2-m Ka-band stabilized maritime VSAT antenna of
orbit systems enables the most demanding maritime vessels and platforms to enjoy
ﬁber-like broadband communications for very high-speed Internet services over
O3b medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellites, which is shown in Fig. 4.2 (Left). In
combination, the O3b satellites and OceanTRx 7-500 maritime VSAT features

extremely high-speed Internet access over a cost-effective system and billing. O3b’s
MEO satellites will be deployed in a circular orbit along the equator at an altitude of
8000 km, less than one-fourth the altitude of GEO satellites. This lower orbit
substantially lowers costs while maintaining low-latency ﬁber-like connections. No
other service provider has the combination of ﬁber-like connections with the global
reach of the O3b satellite network. Each O3b VSAT antenna incorporates ACU and
central control unit (CCU) to manage its system operations. The controllers allocate
antenna resources while managing constellation tracking of the MEO satellite
constellation. Under normal conditions, the controllers receive and process satellite
conﬁguration and position updates from the O3b network operations center for a
completely hands-off and lights-out operation. Thus, a pair of O3b stabilized
maritime VSAT systems each with a Ka-band BUC keeps a continuous contact
with the MEO satellite constellation. In such a way, continuous service is main-
tained by automatically transferring active links between setting and rising satellites
when both are in view.
This compact maritime VSAT system offers industry-standard RF performance
equivalent to a 2.4 m (95″) dish in just a 2.7 m (106″) footprint. The key to this
antenna breakthrough is an extraordinarily small footprint with outstanding RF
performance to its size, strict regulatory compliance, and support of multiple
optional RF feeds. The key features of this antenna are as follows: highly efﬁcient
dual-offset Gregorian 2.2 m (87″) satellite antenna; superior stabilization and
tracking under any severe sea conditions; four-axis pedestal with zero “keyholes” at
zenith or horizon; supporting Ka/Ku-band frequencies, optional RF packages, and
upgradeable BUC power levels; highly accessible pedestal design using small,
light, and “easy-to-replace” ﬁeld replaceable units (FRU); it does not require
accurate or periodic balancing during installation and ﬁeld upgrades (BUC, LNB,
Feed); azimuth is continuous, and elevation is −30° to +120°; ship gyro interface is
NMEA 0183, Step by Step, Synchro;
Operating frequency Rx is 17.8–19.3 GHz and is Tx 27.6–29.1 GHz; system
G/T of (dB/°K as typical including all losses) is ≥24 dB/°K at mid-range at 20°
elevation; system EIRP with multiple BUC options (dBW, typical including all
losses) is 64 dBW with a 20 W BUC at mid-range and 67 dBW with a 40 W BUC
at mid-range.

Maritime Antenna Standards Over LEO Satellites
Low Earth orbit (LEO) satellite systems employ a large ﬂeet of spacecraft, each in a
circular orbit at a constant altitude of a several hundred to few thousand kilometers.
These orbits take the satellites over, or nearly over, the geographic poles. Each
revolution takes approximately 90 min to a few hours. The ﬂeet is arranged in such
a way that, from any point on the surface at any time, at least one satellite is on a
line of sight (LOS). The entire system operates in a manner similar to the way
cellular functions. The main difference is that the transponders, or wireless receiver,
and transmitters (transceiver) are moving rather than ﬁxed and are in space rather
4.7

than on the Earth. A well-designed LEO system makes it possible for anyone to
access the voice, data, and Internet via wireless from any point on the planet, using
an antenna no more sophisticated than old-fashioned television “rabbit ears.”
The main LEO satellite orbits are divided into Big (Iridium and Globalstar) and
Little LEO (Orbcomm). Iridium is the world’s only truly global satellite commu-
nications system, with voice and data solutions covering entire Earth’s surface with
66 cross-linked satellites. The Globalstar and Orbcomm have not intersatellite links
and so are not providing both polar coverages. The LEO satellite network provides
reliable and affordable maritime, land, and aeronautical communications enabling
essential Internet, voice, data, and short burst data (SBD) communications using
omnidirectional antennas. The antenna system for SBD units via LEO satellite is
similar to the Inmarsat-C, mini-C, and IsatData Pro antennas.
1. Iridium Pilot Antenna—This omnidirectional antenna is ADE electronically
switched and phase-steered six dual-element azimuth arrays and one zenith
element connected to the Iridium BDE of Pilot shipborne transceiver, which is
illustrated in Fig. 4.23 (Right). Small and easy to install, the Iridium Pilot unit is
a cost-effective system for mini-VSAT maritime broadband maritime providing
pole-to-pole global coverage for Internet, data, and voice transmission at stan-
dard IP of up to 128/134 Kb/s. The ADE provides the communication con-
nection between the BDE and Iridium’s LEO satellites. The ADE will
automatically locate and track Iridium satellites overhead using a solid-state
antenna array. Mounting bracket is a platform to attach mounting pole and ADE
to ﬂat surface, which is an optional accessory used to connect the ADE to the
mast. This antenna has the following features: Antenna cable is either 20 m or
50 m length; dimensions (H × Ø) of ADU are 230 × 570 mm; weight of ADU
is 11 kg; the AC power supply unit (PSU) provides power to the BDE; L-band
RF for Tx and Rx is 1616–1626.5 MHz; gain is +8 dB; antenna beam width
provides both hemispheric coverages (60° per element); steering is automatic
solid state; and coverage is from horizon to horizon.

2. Iridium OpenPort Antenna—The Iridium OpenPort low-proﬁle satellite
lightweight antenna provides pole-to-pole global coverage high-speed network
speciﬁcally engineered for the ship applications, shown in Fig. 4.24 (Left). It
offers true IP connectivity with up to three phone lines available for simulta-
neous use and high-speed data at a speed of 9.6–128/134 Kb/s. Characteristics
of this antenna are as follows: height is 230 mm (9.06 in); diameter is 570 mm
(22.44 in); and weight is 11 kg (24.25 Ib).
3. Iridium Saylor Antenna—The Sailor SC4000 omnidirectional helical antenna
provides satellite phone system for all sizes and types of vessel, which is
illustrated in Fig. 4.24 (Right). In spite of its very slim and delicate design, this
antenna is very sturdy without any moving parts. Its helix construction is coated
with glass-enforced epoxy, which is highly weather resistant and able to with-
stand the extreme conditions at sea. The characteristics technical of this antenna
are as follows: helical antenna of 210° (3 dB bandwidth); dimensions Ø are
96 mm (3.8″), and height is 140 mm (5.5″); link margin is 16 dB; and elevation
angle from any direction is 20° from horizontal.
4. Globalstar Marine Helix Antenna—For onboard ship installations, Globalstar
is using the pole-mounted helix antenna GAT-17MR, which is shown in
Fig. 4.25 (Left). This antenna provides superior reception and call retention
while sturdily attached to recreation boats, small vessels, or vehicles inside of
Globalstar satellite coverage. It also provides the new service known as Sat-Fi as
a satellite hotspot-allowing operator to send and receive satellite calls through
smartphones. Anyone on board ships of vehicles will be able to carry just a
single phone and use that smartphone on both cellular and Globalstar networks.
5. Orbcomm Marine Whip Antenna—The Stellar Wip AT400-3 Eighth Wave
(1/8) ship or vehicle VHF/GPS antenna is used with the DS400 satellite mod-
ems, which is illustrated in Fig. 4.25 (Right). This satellite antenna could be
used in marine or land environments where small mounting plates could be used
or for applications, which require a low-proﬁle antenna. It has a ﬁxed mount and

includes two RF cables, and its mounting surface ground plane of at least 6
inches in diameter or 36 square inches (6″ × 6″) is required (VHF/GPS).
The VHF and GPS cables are 15 feet long and are terminated with a FAKRA
Bordeaux Purple or Blue connector, respectively. Characteristics of VHF antenna
are as follows: RF is 137–150 MHz; gain is 2.0 dBi; maximum power is VSWR
200 W; and input impedance is 50 Ω (Fig. 4.26).

Vehicleborne Satellite Antennas
The vehicleborne satellite antenna system provides communications, broadband,
and TVRO transmission of multimedia information such as audio and video ima-
ges, voice and data by the integration of satellite communication, microwave-band
transmission, wireless LAN, Internet, mobile public network, and audio and video
compression. These antennas are serving road vehicles and rail wagons with
Satcom on-the-move (SOTM) systems via Inmarsat and other GEO satellite con-
stellations. However, the special vehicleborne satellite antenna system can quickly
establish satellite broadband and TV transmissions.
4.7.2.1
Inmarsat Land Communication Antenna Standards
Land vehicles can generally use all shipborne terminals, except Inmarsat-A and -B
because of the large size of their antennas and indoor equipment. The most popular
standards for VES are Inmarsat-C, M, and mini-M sometimes with modiﬁed
antennas and terminals. In the next section, three of the most known VES antennas,
made by the Cobham manufacturer partner Thrane and Thrane, will be introduced.
1. Inmarsat-C/GPS VES MSA—The most suitable and smallest all-in-one
antenna in the world for land vehicle mounting is the TT-3002L omnidirectional
Inmarsat-C/GSP RHC polarized antenna with built-in LNA/HPA electronics
designed to operate in an aggressive environment, which is illustrated in
Fig. 4.14a. The antenna housing is sealed and contains no user serviceable parts,
with dimensions of 122 × 35.5 mm and a weight of 0.5 kg. The antenna is very
compact and is designed to operate in a corrosive environment and in extreme
weather conditions without any service. It has a modular construction that
allows easy exchange of antenna elements and is designed to work with the VES
Capsat transceiver TT-3022C and GPS receiver in compliance with the
Inmarsat-C speciﬁcations. Thus, this antenna can handle 32 Kbytes transmission
length, with up to 100 m of coax cable, it is designed to operate when the
satellite is visible over the horizon in coverage down to 20° of elevation, and no
signal path blockage is present. The antenna gain is about 4 dBi, axial ratio is
about 3 dB, G/T is −23 dBK, and EIRP is 14 dBK at a 5° elevation angle. This
antenna is suitable for magnetic base mounting, especially on cars and on all
land vehicles for message and data transmissions. The larger version of this
antenna has only difference in dimension of 122 × 125 mm and in weight of
0.6 kg, which is shown in Fig. 4.14b. This antenna is designed to work with the
Capsat Thrane and Thrane transceivers TT-3020C, TT-3022D, and TT-3022C
and is suitable to be installed on any kind of land vehicle.
2. Inmarsat mini-M VES Plate MSA—The most suitable VES for installation in
a large variety of vehicles, ranging from long-haul trucks to off-roaders, and
train has the TT-3007F low-proﬁle antenna built on an aluminum base plate and
4.7
Antenna Systems for Particular MSC
355

covered by a radome, which is shown in Fig. 4.14c. mini-M was replaced by
Explorer BGAN on June 30, 2015.
This satellite transceiver consists of an HPA/LNA board (TT-3010G), which
ampliﬁes received/transmitted voice and data radio signals. Otherwise, a con-
troller board calculates tracking information based on input from a rate sensor
and the received signal strength. Thus, the TT-3007F low-proﬁle antenna is an
automatic tracking antenna designed to work with the TT-3062D Capsat
Compact Carphone. When it has locked onto a satellite, it tracks by turning the
antenna element via a stepper motor. Elevation value is adjustable by switching
between two different aerials; one helix aerial for low elevation and a patch for
high elevation, both with an RHCP characteristic. The helix aerial has elevation
coverage of 13°–40°; elevation beam of 37°; and azimuth beam of 73°, while
the patch aerial has elevation coverage of 30°–70°; elevation beam of 62°; and
azimuth beam of 67°. Thus, when driving in areas where the elevation is greater
than 70°, the user might need to choose another satellite with a smaller elevation
angle. To switch between the two aerials, a cable has to be manually moved
from one connector to another, which requires the radome to be removed, and
this is a disadvantage. Perhaps the problem can be solved with some kind of
simple switch or diplexer.
Moreover, the antenna comes with magnetic feet for roof mounting on a vehicle.
It is also possible to install the unit with bolts, for a more secure and permanent
installation. The value of gain is 12–15 dBi, G/T is a minimum of −17 dBK,
and EIRP is from 8 to 14 dBW in 2 dB steps. The dimensions of the antenna are
285 × 90 mm, and the weight is 2.7 kg.
3. Inmarsat mini-M VES Whip MSA—The TT-3007B rod antenna is a passive
whip omnidirectional unit for use on cars and all kinds of land vehicles, which is
illustrated in Fig. 4.14d. The only movable parts are the lower part of the unit,
where adjustments for correct land zone are carried out. The rod is rigid but will
bend down to an angle of approximately 30° at the base if necessary, e.g., when
passing under obstacles. Thus, it must always be in its upright position when the
system is in operational mode. To gain high receiver performance, the unit is
connected to the antenna front-end unit via a low-loss coaxial cable. The ele-
vation angle is set according to the geographic position and is determined by the
maps provided. In fact, manual readjustment of the elevation is necessary when
driving over long distances. Hence, the zones on the body of the antenna set the
elevation angle as follows: Zone 1 = 25–32.5°; Zone 2 = 32.5–40°; Zone
3 = 40–47.5°; Zone 4 = 47.5–55°; Zone 5 = 55–62.5°; and Zone 6:62.5–70°.
Tuned all the way down to maximum (beyond Zone 6), the antenna will work
up to 90° because of the way the beam reforms. Tuned all the way up to the
highest point, it will turn and the antenna will work down to 15°. The antenna
has an elevation beam width of approx 15°. This relatively narrow angular
aperture is necessary to obtain sufﬁcient gain. Due to this, short signal dropouts
might appear if driving in very rugged terrain. To avoid water ingression to the
antenna, a rubber “raincoat,” i.e., a rubber tube, is rolled down over the lower
356

Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

part of the antenna. This antenna has the same electrical characteristics as the
one previously discussed; dimensions are only 930 × 22 mm, and the weight is
0.63 kg.
The TT-3010A antenna front-end unit contains a high-power ampliﬁer, a duplex
circuitry, an LNA, and supervisory control circuitry. Data communication
between the main unit and the antenna is accomplished by serial communication
through the single coaxial cable, which also carries the RF signal.
4. Inmarsat Vehicular BGAN MSA—The vehicular BGAN transceiver Explorer
727 is a high-speed mobile broadband system, which is shown in Fig. 4.27
(Left). It consists of three fully integrated units: a transceiver, an IP handset, and
a roof mountable antenna. The antenna automatically tracks satellite positions
enabling high-speed connectivity while on the move providing simultaneous
432 Kb/s data, standard IP up to 492 Kb/s, ISDN up to 64 Kb/s, and phone
calls, even at speeds in excess of 200 km/h. Placing the antenna on the roof of
land vehicle, it is possible to turn it into a complete mobile communication
HUB. It provides access to the Internet and phone networks, facilitates both live
streaming and store and forward, and enables direct satellite transmissions from
the hot spots of the world. Its speciﬁcations are as follows: RF is 1525.0–
1559.0 MHz (Rx) and 1626.5–1660.5 MHz (Tx); antenna H/W is 152/
Ø477 mm (6.3/Ø18.76 in), and weight is 6 kg (13.2 lbs); antenna cable loss is
max/min 20 dB at 1.62 GHz and 1 Ω DC loop resistance, 3 dB at 36 MHz/4 dB
at 54 MHz; EIRP is 20 dBW ±1 dB; and antenna connector is TNC Socket
female.
5. Inmarsat Portable BGAN Antenna—The portable BGAN Explorer 700 inside
mount antenna provides the same access to the highest bandwidth available via
BGAN same as vehicular Explorer 727, thereby facilitating a platform for a
wide range of applications with need of high performance, which is illustrated in
Fig. 4.27 (Right). Thus, disregarding the environmental conditions, it is
designed to last, and with the detachable antenna, it is ideally suited for tem-
porary camps, vehicles, or semi-ﬁxed installations. Antenna H/W/D is
297/99/51 mm (11.7/15.7/2.0 in), and weight is 2.1 kg (4.6 lbs).
4.7.2.2
Land VSAT and TVRO Antennas Over GEO Satellites
In addition to the Inmarsat satellites, there are other GEO satellite operators that
provide innovative VSAT and TVRO transmissions for road vehicles and rail
wagons. This GEO satellite constellations offer connectivity solutions via broad-
band voice, data, and video (VDV), Internet and TVRO video, data, TV, and/or
IP-based service in a highly reliable and cost-effective packages or mobile maritime
and land applications. The VSAT antenna is providing two-way or interactive
broadband satellite communications, supporting VDV and Internet applications,
while TVRO antennas provide one-way commercial on-the-move entertainment
systems to individualized live satellite TV.

1. KVH Land Vehicular mini-VSAT Antenna—The TracPhone V7-IP and
V3-IP radome antenna units of KVH producer are mini-VSAT broadband
communications system for vehicles on the move. The V7-IP radome and
reﬂector antenna are shown in Fig. 4.28 (Left) and (Middle), respectively, while
radome of V3-IP is shown in Fig. 4.28 (Right).
Both IP antennas deliver a seamless and consistent Internet access with antennas
that are smaller and lighter than traditional VSAT antennas. These VSAT sys-
tems consist of an antenna and Integrated CommBox Modem (ICM) that con-
nect to a land-based HUB via a Ku-band GEO satellite constellation. The
ground HUB is managed by a network operations center (NOC) that provides
the link to the Internet and the terrestrial telephone network.
The antenna transmits RF energy that is potentially harmful. Whenever the
system is in use, it is necessary to make sure everyone stays more than 11 m

below the antenna. Both antennas may accept an external GPS input as a backup
to the antenna’s internal GPS. In this sense, it will be more secure to connect a
backup GPS and prevent a loss of service if the antenna’s internal GPS fails. The
speciﬁcations of both antennas are as follows: service coverage areas are

Transportable Earth Station (TES) Antennas
Recently, after the introduction of Inmarsat-A and -C standards, Inmarsat started to
provide a new transportable and portable telephone and facsimile communication
service in rural areas and in regions with out-of-range or damaged terrestrial
telecommunication networks. At ﬁrst, Inmarsat-A transportable transceivers were
developed by Magnavox Corporation, EB Communications, JRC, and other man-
ufacturers of MSC equipment, with directional aperture dish and umbrella parabolic
antennas. Soon after Thrane and Thrane, OmniPless (South Africa), Toshiba, Nera,
and other manufacturers of equipment designed the TES Inmarsat-C transceiver
with small patch antennas.
1. Inmarsat-C TES Patch Antenna—This antenna was developed for the
Inmarsat-C portable Capsat TT-3026A transceiver by Thrane and Thrane, which
is shown in Fig. 4.32a. A transceiver unit was integrated into a small laptop PC
as a portable terminal, providing the same service as other Inmarsat-C terminals
in rural and remote areas.
2. Inmarsat mini-M TES Patch Antenna—The mini-M TT-3007A patch
antenna resides on top of the Capsat TT3060A mini-M Electronics unit (EU),
where a short coaxial cable of 0.15 m connects the antenna and the EU, which is
illustrated in Fig. 4.32b. It is possible to place the patch antenna at a distance
from the laptop-sized EU when the short antenna cable can be replaced with the
supplied cable of 5 m or even longer up to 70 m. The patch antenna has a stand,
which in unfolded condition can hold it at the correct angle for transmission;
alternatively, when the stand is folded up, it can be fastened to a bracket. It is
completely watertight and sealed for outdoor operation and has an acoustic

signal strength indicator, which beeps with an increased repetition rate as the
signal received via the antenna becomes stronger. Generally, this TES antenna
meets or exceeds current and proposed Inmarsat speciﬁcations for Inmarsat
phone spot beam operations. It has a directional RHCP patch array with ±15°
horizontal and ±15° vertical beam widths and electrical characteristics as fol-
lows: Gain is about 14–15 dBi, EIRP is from 11 to 17 dBW in 2 dB steps, and
G/T
is
a
minimum
of
−17 dBK.
Dimensions
of
the
antenna
are
52 × 270 × 200 mm, and the weight is 2.2 kg (including handset, battery pack,
and antenna). The label attached to the TT3007A antenna gives a warning that
the antenna radiates microwave signals and that the operator has to keep a
minimum of 0.5 m safety distance. All types of ﬂat panel antennas have similar
warning labels. The next version of this antenna has one panel or combination of
two panels, which provided support to the M4 system multimedia service
linking users to the GAN system via Inmarsat-3 satellites providing mobile
HSD, ISDN line, voice, fax, or combinations of services from virtually any-
where
and
anytime.
The
Inmarsat
GAN
service
was
replaced
by
Explorer BGAN range on June 30, 2015.
3. Inmarsat mini-M Small Dish TES Antenna—The Small Dish TT-3008D
antenna is just one of the many antennas available for the Thrane and Thrane
M4 service, which is shown in Fig. 4.32c. The directional patch array antenna
combined with Capsat messenger terminal is the perfect choice for a combined
ﬁxed and mobile solution at remote and rural sites. It offers both portability and
an easy-to-setup ﬁxed solution. The antenna has a robust frame mount con-
struction that also gives the option of installation on a pole or tripod. Built-in
compass, audible signal strength, and clear elevation indication aid in locking
onto the satellite. The antenna can be stored in a separate and sturdy carry bag.
The transceiver is placed in a bracket inside the antenna, making it one unit; the
smallest ISDN units only weigh 5.2 kg. The 64 Kb/s mobile ISDN connections
give the user access to the Internet, voice, fax, video conferencing, and many
other applications. In addition, this antenna also enables access to the inex-
pensive low-speed mini-M services for voice, fax, and data. Should a 128-Kb/s
speed solution be required, then this is made possible by combining two M4
terminals with two small dish antennas to the ISDN interfaces of the laptop. In

this case, it is possible to use the GAN service offered by Inmarsat, which covers
both high-speed and low-speed data needs. The electric characteristics of the
antennas are as follows: Gain is from 17 to 19 dBi, EIRP is 8–14 dBW for
mini-M and 19–25 dBW for HSD, and G/T is −7 dBK. Dimensions of the
antenna panel are 397 × 397 × 75 mm, and the weight is 3.1 kg. The new
antenna version is combined with three connected (folded-over) panels.
4. Inmarsat mini-M Big Dish TES Antenna—The Inmarsat-M remote antenna is
a proven product designed by OmniPless for use with satellite phones that do
not have a remote function, which is shown in Fig. 4.33a. Due to its high gain,
the antenna can be positioned more than 20 m from the terminal without any
degradation of the signal, depending on the type of terminal and quality of cable
used. Thus, this allows the transceiver to be used indoors even when no clear
line of sight to the satellite is available. This antenna is fully sealed and can be
mounted outdoors even in the harshest weather conditions. It can be mounted on
a wall and remotely controlled from up to 70 m from the main unit. It is also
available with a dedicated pole mount option, which allows simple installation
for ﬁxed or semi-ﬁxed applications, such as rural public payphones, roadside
emergency telephones, and SCADA applications. This kind of antenna supports
Inmarsat GAN service with 64 Kb/s ISDN HSD and all Internet solutions. This
antenna is also ideal for roof mounting of indoor transceivers in rural ofﬁces or
remote business solutions in gas/oil pipe or mining industries. Besides, the
antenna enables access to the inexpensive low-speed mini-M services for voice,
fax, and data transmissions. The polarization of the dish antenna is RHCP with
manual adjustable elevation setting and with a beam width of approximately
20°. The electrical characteristics of this antenna are as follows: Gain value is
about 19 dBi, EIRP is from 8 to 14 dBW in 2 dB steps, G/T is a minimum of
−7 dBK, and the axial ratio is 2 dB. The dimensions of the antenna are
558 × 550 × 63 mm, and the weight is 3.5 kg.

5. Inmarsat-B Quad Flat Panel TES Antenna—The TES ﬂat panel quadrant
antenna is an innovative solution for new-generation transportable and portable
Inmarsat-B terminals, which is shown in Fig. 4.33b. Designed by OmniPless
for compact TES equipment, it provides ease of deployment and small stowage
size. It consists in four separate identical panels and a base plate. Proprietary
attachments allow the panels to be quickly mounted onto the base plate, ideal for
integration with the devices of the deployment structure and RF electronics.
A retaining clamp is available, which locks the panels to the base plate for per-
manent and semi-permanent installations. This antenna enables transmission of
voice, data, and fax calls at speeds of 9.6 Kb/s; advanced ISDN capabilities for
high-speed Internet/LAN access; and broadcast uplinks. By connecting a stan-
dard fax and a PC, one has a complete ofﬁce at a remote or rural location, with
optional HSD of 56/64 Kb/s. The electrical characteristics are as follows: Tx gain
is 21.4 dBi and Rx gain >21.3 dBi, EIRP is 25–33 dBW, G/T is about −4 dBK,
axial ratio is 1 dB, and antenna temperature is 114 °K and with RHCP polar-
ization. The dimension of the antenna low panel stowage is 390 × 387 × 62 mm
(4 panels), deployed panel size in total is 774 × 774 × 15.5 mm (about 0.6 m2),
and the weight is 2.4 kg.

Transmitting Antennas for the COSPAS–SARSAT
System
The COSPAS–SARSAT system uses different types of antennas built-in or
mounted atop of emergency position-indicating radio beacon (EPIRB), personal
locator beacon (PLB), and emergency locator transmitter (ELT) units, for maritime,
land, and aeronautical applications, respectively. The antenna for distress satellite
beacons (DSB) may have been designed to transmit signals at RF of 406.025 MHz
signals via LEOSAR, MEOSAR, and GEOSAR COSPAS–SARSAT satellites.
Thus, the COSPAS–SARSAT system has ceased satellite processing of 121.5/
243 MHz beacons on February 1, 2009. Some antennas for handheld DSB have to
receive signals emitted on the same RF and to conduct power to a strobe light
mounted above the antenna. It is possible that the radiated signal can be composed
of an unknown ratio of vertical and horizontal polarizations. For this reason, some
consideration shall be given to the type of antenna and its radiated ﬁeld. The results
shall encompass all wave polarizations, so the antenna pattern and ﬁeld strength
measurements should provide sufﬁcient data to evaluate the antenna characteristics.
There are many manufacturers of DSB for maritime, land, and aeronautical
applications, but only few will be introduced.
1. Antenna for Floating EPIRB/GPS—The ﬂoating EPIRB Tron 60 GPS set is a
GMDSS DSB with buoy shape and is designed by Jotron for manual or auto-
matic operation and designated to enhance crew and passenger lifesaving on

board ocean vessels, as is shown in Fig. 4.34a. This DSB unit has two built-in
antennas: The ﬁrst is an omnidirectional 406.025 MHz antenna for Tx distress,
and the second is a receiving GPS patch antenna providing accurate position
improvement of the EPIRB from a radius of 5 km to an amazing 100 m. This
unit can be used as ELT for aircraft in an emergency on the sea’s surface.
Similar top-mounted or built-in antennas have also been designed for ELT
aeronautical applications with different body shapes.
2. Antenna for Handheld PLB/GPS—This is the smallest handheld DSP pro-
duced as PLB1 brand by Ocean Signal Company, whose unit with antenna is
illustrated in Fig. 4.34b. The PLB1 unit is small enough to be easily carried in a
pack
or
pocket
with
the
following
dimensions:
Height/width/depth
is
77/51/32.5 mm, and weight is 116 g. When it is activated, this beacon transmits
via retractable antenna position of person wherever emergency situation is, at
sea or on land. The PLB1 satellite transmitter is sending alert signals via antenna
at UHF-band RF of 406.040 MHz and VHF homing beacon at 121.5 MHz. The
built-in GPS receiver is using microstrip patch antenna.
3. Antenna for Handheld–Floating PLB—This is handheld and ﬂoating
AquaLink PLB designed by ACR designed for manual activation during distress
alert by crewmember or passenger on board ship, whose antenna and unit are
illustrated in Fig. 4.34c. An omnidirectional whip transmitting 121.5 and
406 MHz antenna with a length of 180 mm is mounted on top of the electronic
unit. Moreover, similar top-mounted or built-in antennas have also been
designed for ELT and PLB beacon units for land and aeronautical mobile
applications, respectively, with different body shapes. More exactly, with three
levels of antenna types integrated in satellite beacon signal technology, such as:
GPS Rx positioning, a powerful 406 MHz DSP Tx and 121.5 MHz homing Tx

capability, the AquaLink quickly and accurately relays ships or personal posi-
tion in distress alerting the worldwide network for SAR operations.
4. Replacement Antennas for EPIRB Transmitters—This is ACR replacement
antenna model 9368 for 406 and 121.5 MHz EPIRB transmissions, which is
illustrated in Fig. 4.34d. The features of this antenna are as follows: Weight is
0.10 g; height is 18.77 cm (7.39″), and voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR) to
measure transmission line imperfections is less than 1.5/1.
1. ELT Blade Antenna—The airborne ELT Rx blade antenna S65-1231-1 is
product of sensor systems, which is shown in Fig. 4.35a. It is working on
abandoned 121.5 and 243.0 MHz and the new digital satellite-aided tracking RF
of 406.025 MHz, compatible with COSPAS–SARSAT and ELT systems. This
aircraft antenna is one-piece aluminum casting construction designed for
high-speed aircraft and can be ﬁxed on rear side of fuselage of ﬁxed and rotary
wing aircraft. It has omni/azimuth and cos/elevation characteristics: Polarization
is vertical; impendence is 50 ohms; lighting protection is DC grounded. Weight
of antenna is 1.6 lbs, height is 9.8 inches, and it is built by 6061-T6 aluminum
glass materials and is connected to the onboard unit via Bayonet Neill–
Concelman (BNC) plug.
2. Topside ELT Antennas—This type of antenna is installing on topside of ELT
and can be used in two types: the Kannad ELT with whip antenna, shown in
Fig. 4.35b (Left), and the Kannad Rod ELT Rx antenna for business jet aircraft,
shown in Fig. 4.35b (Right). Both antennas are compatible with COSPAS–
SARSAT and other ELT standards.
3. Antenna for Floating ELT—This antenna is usually whip antenna installed on
top of ﬂoating ELT, shown in Fig. 4.35c. The representative of this unit is
product of the French company KANNAD 406 AS, an aeronautical survival
beacon. Thanks to its small size and lightweight, this ELT ﬁts easily inside a life
raft. However, it is supplied with a ﬂoating collar and can be used for aircraft in
an emergency on the sea’s surface.

multifunction PLB with embedded GPS receiver with dual PLB/GPS antenna.
These units are designed to survive for up to twenty years with the only
maintenance being battery replacement every ﬁve years. Otherwise, there are
various ELT antenna options available for most applications. The manufacturer

4.7.5
Antenna Systems for GMPSC
Many emerging Global Mobile Personal Satellite Communication (GMPSC) net-
works are offering services based on small handheld terminals. The design of these
terminals is based upon the services provided by the system, so the electronics and
the antenna should follow certain guidelines to fulﬁll the system, network, service,
and market requirements. Brieﬂy, the requirements are for the GMPCS antenna
system to have a shaped pattern in elevation (depending on the satellite antenna,
orbital parameters, and satellite system statistics); circular polarization, an adequate
G/T (depending on the link budget parameters, the mobile’s environment, and
handling of the handset by the user); an adequate bandwidth (depending on the
system speciﬁcations); and ﬁnally, an appropriate size (dictated by the handset
size and aesthetic constraints but also depending on all the other requirements).
Hence, the QHA seems to be the most promising antenna for such an application
because it offers an elevational shaped pattern, whose shape can be changed by
small structural changes and circular polarization within the main lobe.
The G/T of these antennas has to be measured in conjunction with the envi-
ronment and the operating system applied, while the instantaneous bandwidth for
VSWR is better than that at 2:1–3 to 5 % for slim antennas and goes up to 10–15 %
for wider structures. Otherwise, the pattern shape bandwidth goes up to 15 % for all
structures. The required pattern shape was determined based on an analysis of the
G/T for different antenna patterns in different environments and for a system with
the constellation statistics of GMPSC, such as Iridium, Globalstar, and others. It is
assumed that the user cooperates by pointing the antenna toward the zenith. The
main lobe should have the maximum gain at about 60° above the horizon, with a
half-transmission-power beam width starting from the maximum gain angle and
ending at the minimum elevation angle.
The minimum elevation angle was deﬁned by the system to be 10o above the
horizon, but by taking into account the satellite statistics of the system, an 18°
minimum elevation angle can be selected, offering a 100 % coverage of most of the
Earth’s surface and a 98 % coverage in latitudes between 3 and 5° and above 70°
north and south. A small gain dip at the zenith is desirable, since this optimizes
coverage at low elevation angles where extra path and fading losses are encoun-
tered. The antenna sizes for handheld terminals were designed to be as small as
4.7
Antenna Systems for Particular MSC

possible for the operational L- and S-bands. At this point, the antennas chosen are
relatively short QHA with very good pattern shapes and can be produced using
simple design instructions.
4.7.5.1
Wire Quadriﬁlar Helix Antenna (WQHA) for Handheld
Terminals
The WQHA is a highly resonant antenna invented by Kilgus in the 1970s. This
antenna consists of four helices placed at 90° to each other. The four helical ele-
ments are connected by radial parts and are fed in 90° phase differences (0°, 90°,
180°, and 270°).
The analysis by Kilgus for the resonant QHA (RQHA) is based on the
assumption that the QHA consists of four helical and four radial parts. At this point,
the current distribution on the helical elements is assumed to be sinusoidal, with
magnitude maxima at the feed and the distal end for each l/2 length. The current in
the radials is approximated by a uniform distribution. Another analysis approach to
the RQHA is based on the assumption that a QHA consists of two biﬁlar helices
(BH) placed at 90° angular distance and fed in phase quadrature. The radials in the
distant end can be shorted or open-circuited giving only changes to the input
impedance. One of the major disadvantages of the QHA is the complex feed
network required. In addition, one approach is to feed each BH with the assistance
of a balun. Most of these conﬁgurations need a 90° phase difference hybrid, and two
baluns are needed to feed both BH. The exceptions to that rule are the self-phased
conﬁguration and the Keen balun, which can offer the phase difference without a
hybrid and with the use of only one balun. The other way is to separately feed each
one of the four helical elements, with 90° phase difference, using three hybrids.
This method does not need a balun to feed the QHA but can be used only in an
end-ﬁre conﬁguration, for constructional reasons.
Otherwise, the QHA can operate in both the satellite mode (hemispherical pat-
tern) and terrestrial mode (toroidal pattern). There are three possible ways to
accommodate a QHA on handheld terminals, illustrated in Fig. 4.36. The ﬁrst one
(a) is a bottom-fed, end-ﬁre QHA with shorted-end radials and normal QHA. The
second one (b) is the same antenna but uplifted to be above the head, known as a
moved-up QHA, and ﬁnally, the third one (c) is a top-fed, backﬁre QHA with open
bottom radials, i.e., with open radial QHA.
4.7.5.2
Antenna Solutions for Handheld Terminals
The new GEO and non-GEO MSC systems are employed as personal handheld
terminals with small whip or telescope antennas similar to cellular systems. In this
context, several different manufacturers in the world have designed types of antenna
for top mount on the handheld terminals. These systems also provide service for all
368

three mobile applications, with speciﬁc antenna solutions for installation atop
mobile satellite phones.
1. Iridium 9555 Satellite Handheld Phone—This is compact, light, and
easy-to-use with industrial-grade ruggedness and it is connected to the only truly
global personal and mobile satellite communications network. The Iridium 9555
handset has an inbuilt transceiver and fully integrated internal omnidirectional
whip antenna, which is illustrated in Fig. 4.37a (Left). This antenna is new and
much more sensitive and effective for reliable satellite voice and data trans-
missions. During telephone call, internal antenna has to be extended, so if is not
extended on the screen will be written alert message to extend the antenna. The
antenna must be able to “see” the entire sky from approximately 8° above the
horizon. The features of this handheld phone are as follows: Dimensions are
143 mm (L) × 55 mm (W) × 30 mm (D), and weight is 266 g (9.4 oz). This
satellite phone is also designed for usage with an optional external (auxiliary)
antenna without removing internal antenna, which is shown in Fig. 4.37a
(Right). The optional auxiliary antenna adaptor allows to be easily attached the
external antenna to the back of the Iridium 9555 handset. It allows for in-vehicle
use of Iridium handset, such as on board ships, vehicles, and aircraft, and is
calling satellite dock station. This antenna is ﬁtted via an extension coaxial cable
to the cradle that must be located more than >0.3 m (1 foot) from human body
(person) when in operation.
2. Inmarsat Handheld IsatPhone 2—This Inmarsat handheld phone is designed
for the most reliable voice and data satellite communications network in the
world. It is designed to use whip internal active antenna that is able to receive
incoming call alerts even with antenna stowed, which is illustrated in Fig. 4.37b.

The features of this phone are as follows: Dimension is 16.9 cm, and weight is
0.318 kg. This phone has external antenna port for connection of external
(auxiliary) antenna for all mobile applications. This external antenna is essential
at sea, on the ground, and in the air to lock the geostationary satellite voice
connections and also to make transfer of data without breaking. The docking
stations can be used with a variety of antennas, including a ﬁxed passive
antenna, a marine pole mount mast antenna, and low-proﬁle vehicular or aircraft
antennas.
3. Globalstar GSP-1700 Handheld Phone—This is handheld portable satellite
phone using Globalstar network. Rotate and extend the antenna located on the
back of the phone, whose phone and antenna in stowed position is shown in
Fig. 4.37c. The phone will ring with the antenna stowed, but cannot be
answered until the antenna is extended. The optional external antenna id is
designed for installation on board ships and vehicles.

Airborne Satellite Antennas
Typical medium and large jet antenna classiﬁcation includes communication,
VSAT, and TVRO antennas. The fully professional and more reliable GMSC
system is Inmarsat GEO constellation serving AMSC in which the L-band
1.6/1.5 GHz MSA is used for the service link, such as low-gain antenna (LGA),
intermediate-gain antenna (IGA), and high-gain antenna (HGA), which are shown
in Fig. 4.38, LGA (a) produced by EMS Electronics and IGA (b) and HGA (c),
both produced by Cobham. The Inmarsat and other GEO satellite operators also are
deploying antennas for satellite data link (SDL) service.

The Inmarsat satellite communication system has been described in the aero-
nautical system deﬁnition manual (SDM), and the AES portion of the system for
commercial aviation has been described in Aeronautical Radio Incorporated
(ARINC) Characteristics 741. The ARINC 741 categorizes the operational types of
the AES into four classes see Table 4.5.
The class 1 aircraft antenna type can provide only low-speed data services,
which include aeronautical operational control (AOC) and aeronautical adminis-
trative communication (AAC) services by using a low-gain antenna (0 dBi). In the
future, this type of station will be used for ATC. The class 2 aircraft antenna type
provides only voice services, mainly for passengers in the cabin known as aero-
nautical passenger communication (APC), with a high-gain antenna (12 dBi).

The Class 3 aircraft antenna type provides both voice and high-speed data services
by adding data systems to the Class 2 type. The Class 4 type combines the features
of Class 1 and Class 3 and is expected to provide all kinds of aeronautical com-
munications with high-gain and low-gain antennas.
4.7.6.1
Introduction of Antennas for Inmarsat GEO System
The commercial aeronautical MSC services worldwide have been provided by the
Inmarsat network since 1990 with Aero-H and -L standards. Hence, aircraft can
easily use Inmarsat-C and mini-M shipborne terminals, but because of the high
speed of aircraft and small space in the cockpit, all AES terminals and antenna
design are modiﬁed more aerodynamically and in a very ﬂat shape for mounting on
the aircraft fuselage. At this point, in 1992 and 1998, Aero-C and -L standards were
developed, respectively, and ﬁnally, the aero mini-M standard for AES mounts was
recently developed.
The biggest mobile satellite operator today Inmarsat Inc. developed ﬁve types of
MSA for maritime, land, aeronautical, transportable (portable), and personal and
semi-ﬁxed applications, while in particular, some maritime MSA are used or
transformed for land vehicles, aircraft, and off/onshore installations. There are many
different categorizations of Aero standards, but as stated above, the most reasonable
today is classiﬁed into three main groups: AES with LGA, IGA, and HGA, which
all produce nominal gains of 0 and up to 12 dBi, respectively. The G/T of HGA and
LGA is required to be over—13 dB/K (gain is about 12 dBi) and −26 dB/K (gain is
about 0 dBi), respectively. The HGA is used for public voice/high-speed data
(21 Kb/s) communications, which can be connected to terrestrial public telephone
networks. On the other hand, the low-gain antenna is used for low-speed data (600,
1200, 2400 bps) communications.
The phased-array antennas are the best candidates for the airborne antenna
because of such advantageous characteristics as low-proﬁle and mechanical
strength. Two types of phased-array antenna have been used; one is a conformal
type, which has two sets of phased arrays on both sides of a fuselage, and the other
is a top mount type, which has a set of phased arrays on the top of a fuselage.
As shown in Fig. 4.39, this is a top mount HGA phased-array antenna for the
INMARSAT Aero terminal, which was improved for commercial aircraft use based
on the research and development of the airborne phased-array antenna in the ETS-V
program. It has four phased-array units with an A-class HPA, a DIP/LNA, and a
beam steering unit (BSU). The nose and tail array units have been used to make
keyhole areas narrow enough to keep communication links over 85 % in the upper
hemisphere. All kinds of aircraft antenna provide simultaneous full duplex and two
bands of transceiving operations. The main speciﬁcations and RF of LGA and HGA
subsystems are shown in Table 4.6.
The AES terminal uses two types of aircraft phased-array antennas. The ﬁrst is a
top mount type, which is installed on the top of a fuselage, while the second is a
side mount array type, which is installed on both aircraft sides, port and starboard
372

Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

sides of the fuselage. Thus, the top mount type has the advantage of eliminating
keyhole areas where the beam cannot be scanned, but it has the disadvantage of
increasing air drag. The conformal type, on the other hand, has the advantage of low
air drag, but has the disadvantage of keyholes. An HGA subsystem consists of a
phased-array antenna, a DIP, an LNA, an A-class HPA, and a BSU, which steers
the beam to track a satellite.
A program-tracking method carries out the satellite tracking. A BSU steers the
beam by controlling digital phase shifters of the phased-array antenna; the infor-
mation used to operate the BSU is calculated from the signals from the inertial
navigation system (INS), which gives the position, heading direction, and altitude
of the aircraft. To track the satellite, the HGA has to steer the beam to cover over
75 % of the hemisphere above an elevation angle of 5°. When a phased-array
antenna is used, these are inevitably keyhole areas in the fore and aft directions
shown in Fig. 4.40, because it is very hard for a phased-array antenna to scan the

global basis, from sea level to about 20 km and all the way from 70 °N to 70 °S.
It consists in an antenna element, a diplexer, an LNA, and a C-class HPA. Its
gain is 0 dBi, EPIRB is about 12 dBW, G/T is −32 dBW, and its radiation
pattern is omnidirectional, to cover over 85 % of the upper hemisphere above an

subsystems are listed in Table 4.6. In Fig. 4.43 is illustrated a photography of a

with an IGA and HGA up to 200 Kb/s.

Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

A typical example of this antenna is the Capsat antenna of Sensor Systems Inc.,
consisting of a TT-3002A MSA (Jet Blade) and a TT-3001F HPA/LNA Pack. It
is connected to the Thrane and Thrane TT-3024A Aero Inmarsat-C/GPS Capsat
transceiver. Dimensions of the antenna are 116 × 297.4 × 108 mm, and the
weight is 680 g. Working ambient temperature is between −55 °C and +85 °C
at an altitude of about 21 km.
These particulars are for Inmarsat Aero-C standards, and the assembly drawing
is presented in although some of the Aero-L standards have the same shape of
antenna. The Aero-L antenna provides EIRP of minimum 16.5 dBW, G/T of
−13 dBK, and 93 % coverage and can serve as the reversionary antenna below
7 dBW of EIRP for Aero-H conﬁgurations. The LGA system is suitable for
aircraft that does not need voice or HSD communications. A LGA system
consists of an antenna element, a DIP, an LNA, and a C-class HPA. Its gain is
about 0 dBi, and its radiation pattern is omnidirectional to cover over 85 % of
the upper hemisphere above an elevation angle of 5°.
2. IGA System—The intermediate-gain antenna (IGA) is a medium 2-axis
mechanically steered phased-array IGA designed to support both aeronautical
Inmarsat-I and -M. A typical example of IGA is the integrated TT-5006A
innovative solution for Aero-I and -M installations on small- and medium-sized
business aircraft, which can be used for both multichannel Aero-I and single
channel Aero-M applications, shown in Fig. 4.41b. It is the smallest aero
satellite antenna, which interfaces to the TT-5000 and TT-3000M series of
Thrane and Thrane transceivers for Aero-I and -M, respectively, available for
voice, faxes, prints, data transfer, or e-mail messages.
This antenna contains its built-in navigational reference system, including the
GPS antenna with magnetic and altitude sensing for stand-alone operations,
angular sensors, and electronics for performing this task. All these functions are
contained within the unit. The electrical characteristics of TT-5006A MSA are
as follows: Gain is 6 dBi, EIRP is 14 dBW, G/T is −17 dBK, and axial ratio of
minimum 6 dB with coverage volume of over 85 % above 5° elevation angles.
Dimensions of this antenna system are 560 × 150 × 124 mm, and the weight is
2.2 kg. The antenna is the smallest combined NRS and MSC antenna in this
class with an ultralight construction, which offers very low drag (less than 3 lb

drag at Mach 0.8 on a small jet). The latest state-of-the-art technology from the
well-proven Thrane and Thrane IGA (Cobham) products provides ideal solu-
tions for all short- and medium-haul business and military aviation.
The sample of the Thrane and Thrane TT-5006A IGA aeronautical subsystem,
which can interface to HGA TT models, is an innovative solution for Aero-I and
-M installations on small- to medium-sized business aircrafts, due to its inte-
grated approach to functionality and installation, shown in Fig. 4.38b.
It incorporates the navigational reference functions, including the GPS aircraft
antenna, magnetic, and attitude sensing. The antenna is mechanically steered
with an ultralight construction, has a high-gain margin, and offers very low drag
(less than 3 lb drag at Mach 0.8 on a small jet). With a short distance between
the antenna and the LNA, an extremely high and superior coverage volume is
achieved. However, the novel antenna pigtails interconnect approach used with
the RF and GPS cables allows external antenna replacement without affecting
the pressurization. Its features facilitate a single antenna installation, lower
installation costs, installation ﬂexibility, and transmitting data speed of support
up to 300 Kb/s.
3. HGA System—The high-gain antenna (HGA) system is designed as a medium
2-axis electronically steered phased-array high-gain antenna. This antenna is
designated to support aero Inmarsat-H, H+, HSD+, and Swift aeronautical
standards. It may also provide service to new SwiftBroadband aeronautical
standard. The two typical representatives of HGA products are as follows:
(a) The solution of HGA conﬁguration is designed to support Inmarsat Aero-H
and H+ standards with which both provide channel rates up to 10.5 Kb/s.
In addition, it supports multichannel voice, fax, and data transfer, while the
Aero-H+ system optionally can also use the higher power of the Inmarsat-3
and Inmarsat-4 satellites when operating within the spot beam coverage
area.
(b) The combination of a HGA TT-5000HSD+ Thrane and Thrane, old
Inmarsat GAN or new Inmarsat BGAN and Swift 64 advanced technology
provides Aero-H+ capability together with a dedicated HSD satellite
channel for up to 64 Kb/s of mobile packet data service (MPDS).
The HGA is usually a planar phased array of a number of identical
crossed-dipole elements arranged in a grid. For instance, the CMA-2102 HGA of
the Canadian Marconi Company has 39 crossed-dipole array elements, presented in
Fig. 4.42a, and the T-4000 HGA array system manufactured by US-based
Company Tecom has 44 crossed-dipoles, shown in Fig. 4.42b. Hence, both
antennas provide simultaneous transmission and reception of full-duplex satellite
signals, namely the Tx- and Rx-bands. Beam steering of the HGA is performed via
serial transmission of phase shifter data from the beam steering unit (BSU).
The BSU converts tracking and pointing coordinates (relative azimuth and
elevation of antenna) from the satellite data unit (SDU) into a signal needed to
select the antenna array elements in combinations that point the antenna beam in the
376

Mobile Satellite Antenna Systems

desired direction. This form of beam steering is known as open-loop steering, which
requires the SDU to receive accurate and timely navigation information. At any
rate, all steering operations are transparent to the user since the antenna BSU/SDU
combination ensures that the beam automatically points in the desired direction.
Diplexer/low-noise ampliﬁer (DIP/LNA) enables an RF signal to be sent and
received. The 3 RF ports antenna, transmit, and receive of the DIP/LNA provide
signal routing and ﬁltering functions. Signals in the Rx-band are routed from the

antenna port to the Rx port, while Tx band signals are routed from the transmit port
to the antenna port. The Rx path ﬁlters the Tx signal and other out-of-band signals
to prevent the LNA and other Rx side components from being driven into nonlinear
operation. The Tx path ﬁlters receive band signals so that noise and spurious signals
from HPA do not increase the noise ﬂoor of the Rx. This unit establishes the noise
ﬂoor by boosting the signals and noise received from the antenna to a level much
greater than the noise level of subsequent components in the receive path.
The base plate of the antenna is a mount for the phased-array antenna and the
radome and provides a mating interface to the aircraft airframe. The phased-array
antenna is mounted to the antenna system base plate. The radome provides physical
protection for the electrical components. It is of multilayer ﬁberglass construction
and is painted with Teﬂon paint. This paint prevents ice buildup and resists com-
mon chemicals normally used around aircraft, such as de-icing ﬂuid. The radome is
outﬁtted with metallic strips, grounded to the base plate and fuselage, which serve
to divert lighting and eliminate the disturbances of any antenna or avionics elec-
trical components. Thus, the HGA low proﬁle is aerodynamically designed radome
that minimizes drag and eliminates icing. At this point, its design has been opti-
mized for installation on long- and medium-haul passenger aircraft. Since it can be
mounted anywhere along the top of the aircraft fuselage, it is suitable for a wide
range of commercial and military airframe types. The typical performance char-
acteristics of the HGA are as follows: Gain is between 12 and 17 dBi over 90 % of
the Inmarsat hemisphere (IH), i.e., coverage or minimum of 9.5 dBi over 100 % of
IH; EIRP is about 25.5 dBW over 92.6 % of IH; it assumes 40 W HPA and 2.5 dB
of cable loss; G/T is about −13 dBK over 90 % of IH, and axial ratio is about 6 dB
over 96.5 % of the industry (Inmarsat) hemisphere. Practically, HGA is known, as a
high-gain antenna for aeronautical application, but actually, this type of MSA is a
medium-gain antenna.
The system block diagram of phased-array antenna is illustrated in Fig. 4.43.
Two array antennas were adopted to provide the required wide range coverage with
high-gain beams, and ether one is selected to operate, depending on the ﬂight
direction. An array consists of 16 elements, with 2 in elevation and 8 in azimuth
angles.
The sample of the EMS technologies AMT-700 HGA is designed for tail mount
in housing radome, shown in Fig. 4.38c. This antenna is a complete ARINC 781
HGA and is used to receive and transmit voice and data from aircraft up to
432 Kb/s. It delivers the most gain of any high-gain Aero-H/H+, Swift64, or
SwiftBroadband antenna currently on the market. The antenna weigh is less than
5 Pounds and achieves the maximum gain from its optimized array of helices, more
than 13.5 dBic. The assembly of this mechanically steered antenna is made by two
line replaceable units (LRU) and a diplexer/low-noise ampliﬁer (DLNA) that meets
stringent SwiftBroadband passive intermodulation (PIM) requirements. It operates
with low-angle RF coverage >13.5 dBic gain of 100 % of Inmarsat coverage
volume and up to −10° below horizon. Power supply options for antenna is +28
VDC, and nominal power consumption is 15 W (maximum is 30 W).

Classiﬁcation of Inmarsat Aeronautical Communication
Antenna
Airborne equipment for aeronautical satellite communication in the Inmarsat system
is called the Inmarsat Aero terminal applications. As stated above, three types of
antenna systems of LGA, IGA, and HGA are deﬁned in the AES terminal systems.
The G/T of aircraft antenna is required to be over −13 dB/K (gain is about 12 dBi)
and −26 dB/K (gain is about 0 dBi). The HGA conﬁguration is used for public
voice, and high-speed data communication is about 21 Kb/s and up to 492 Kb/s,
which can be connected to terrestrial public telephone networks. On the other hand,
the LGA is used for low-speed data communications at 600, 1200, and 2400 b/s.
1. Inmarsat Low-Gain Antenna (LGA)—The LGA-3000 model of Inmarsat aero

illustrated in Fig. 4.44a. The block diagram of the Inmarsat LGA-3000 antenna
array is presented in Fig. 4.45a. A unique feature of this product is the integrated
GPS receiving antenna that enables the Cobham SB200 solution to operate as a
stand-alone system, without any inputs from aircraft navigation, or data control
systems and the installations and connections of a third-party GPS antenna. In
fact, this makes the SB200 system the most compact antenna solution for the
provision of reliable and affordable voice and data connectivity and extends
SwiftBroadband connectivity options right down to the smallest of airframes.
It deals for Aero-C and other standards, has small footprint, aerodynamic pro-
ﬁle, and simple installation, and has optimized coverage down to 20° elevation.
It meets Inmarsat Class 15 technical speciﬁcations and is integrated GPS

required).
2. Inmarsat Intermediate-Gain Antenna (IGA)—The Cobham IGA-5001
antenna is a fuselage mount electronically steered, phased-array antenna,
shown in Fig. 4.44b. The block diagram of this antenna is presented in

illustrated in Fig. 4.48a, produced by EMS Electronics. The EMS antenna is
Inmarsat SwiftBroadband Class 6 assessed and compatible with all ARINC 741
compliant satellite communications avionics. This antenna receives and trans-
mits signals to and from Inmarsat satellites from up to 10° below horizon. This
allows the helicopter to maintain a connection while maneuvering and near
geographic obstacles. An approved ARINC Type F diplexer/DLNA unit pro-
vides an RF interface between the avionics and the antenna. An antenna control
equipment (ACE) steers the antenna using ARINC 741 antenna-pointing vectors
received from avionics.

integrated antenna. These result in numerous beneﬁts, such as two antennas,
smallest size, lightweight, including related services in one, physical shape
without size increase, multisatellite operations and very low service and life
cycle cost.
Antenna enables radically new service providing concepts: By combining Ku-
and L-bands, a novel, hybrid data link can be established. In fact, Ku-band is
used for a fast downlink of large data quantities over DVB-S and DVB-S2
quality to the aircraft, whereas L-band serves as uplink channel and supple-
mentary or fallback downlink channel. However, this results in unprecedented
connectivity options and maximum ﬂexibility for owners and operators: com-
bination of cost-efﬁcient Ku-band downlink with globally available L-band
connectivity. Asymmetric aircraft data link performs high-volume downlink
combined with reasonable and affordable data rates in uplink, with avoidance of
proprietary and expensive Ku-band uplink. This fuselage mount antenna is a real
future-proof and secures your connectivity hardware investments, as it elimi-
nates dependency of a proprietary Ku-band service provider or signal-encoding
scheme. The special QEST technical solution is design of multilayer aperture for
multiband antenna operations, which is shown in Fig. 4.52a. The QEST pro-
posal of dual-band airborne broadband antenna coverage of Ku-band as well as
L-band service simultaneously in one small antenna is shown in Fig. 4.6b.
The Ku-band frequency range is 10.7–12.75 GHz, antenna gain is 29.5 dBi,
antenna G/T is >13 dB/K, data rates are up to 40 Mb/s per transponder Rx,
coverage of more than 100 transponders simultaneously, and elevation coverage
is 90°–0° (providing full performance for all elevation angles and regular ﬂight
maneuvers) including simultaneous Ku-band (Rx) and L-band (Tx + Rx)
operation (multifrequency and multisatellite operation).
The L-band frequency range is 1.5–1.7 GHz, and thus, antenna gain and G/T
comply with SwiftBroadband of Inmarsat speciﬁcations; data rates have
SwiftBroadband capacity (432 Kb/s) per channel in Tx and Rx multichannel use
possible, and elevation coverage is 90°–0° (full performance for all elevation
angles and regular ﬂight maneuvers) including simultaneous Ku-band (Rx) and
L-band (Tx + Rx) operation (multifrequency and multisatellite operation).

multiband transceiver airborne antenna of General Dynamics (GD) maintains
the data link during dynamic platform motion for VDVoIP aeronautical onboard
service in cockpit and cabins. This aircraft antenna provides reliable accuracy of
satellite tracking via combination of on board aircraft integrated tracking Rx,

Antennas for Aeronautical TV (TVRO) Broadcasting
Satellite broadcasting at the 12 GHz of Ku-band stream has become more wide-
spread and there is a need for TVRO reception by relatively large- and
medium-sized aircraft. This service is very attractive for both commercial and

military applications including for entertainment of passengers in ﬂight. The special
digital TV and audio content distributed by GEO satellites are becoming the
standard for TV reception on board aircraft worldwide. Since a satellite commu-
nication system covers a wide area of service, it is inherently suitable for mobile
reception of two new transmission services known as direct audio broadcasting
(DAB) and direct broadcasting satellite (DBS) in good propagation conditions
compared to its terrestrial TV satellite broadcast counterparts, because the former
suffers less interference due to multipath propagation as commonly experienced in
practice. Thus, the TV satellite broadcasting service is deploying the following
airborne satellite antenna systems:
1. Tailwind 300 Multiregion In-ﬂight TV System—This antenna id designed by
the Rockwell Collins Airborne TV ARINC as fully integrated system that
enables passengers to receive Ku-band DBS TV program on board aircraft and
access the spectrum of digital video and audio programming available from
GEO DBS satellites, which antenna without radome is shown in Fig. 4.54a. The
system takes these signals automatically, decodes them to the correct broadcast
format, and then distributes them to the aircraft onboard audio–video or enter-
tainment management systems for passengers in ﬂight.
2. Tailwind 500 Multiregion In-ﬂight TV System—This is the similar Ku-band
ARINC antenna system for the executive jet business aircraft, which offers the
kind of content-rich live programming from DBS satellites that allows you to

lage mount multiregion in-ﬂight TV antenna system provides passengers in
ﬂight informed and entertained, whose array antenna system is shown in
Fig. 4.54c. The Tailwind 550 is a fully integrated system that enables private
aircraft to receive Ku-band DBS TV signals, providing access to the full
spectrum of digital video and audio programming currently available from DBS
satellites. These airborne broadband antennas can be conﬁgured for multiple
ﬂight zones throughout the passenger cabins and with combinations of up to 32
unique programming receivers providing ﬂexibility to choose both personalized
content and viewing location.

ASB—The
P&L
International Inc. designed the next generation of airborne ASB antenna systems
known as ZipPhaser-Air aviation antenna for all size aircraft broadband capa-
bility on board commercial airlines that need capability to connect over the
ocean regions, which is illustrated in Fig. 4.55a. This antenna system being

broadcasting onboard entertainment applications. The antenna system would
install on the aircraft with a small low-proﬁle footprint and radome with and
astounding low weight. The modem router uses an iDirect X5 Evolution, and
the antenna controller is included. The infrastructure on the aircraft can be wired
or WiFi (wireless) and the choice is that of the airlines operator. The X5 router
and HUB provide automatic antenna beam switching capability as the aircraft
moves from one region to the next providing seamless transition for transatlantic
ﬂights. The TV broadcasting network ground stations are located in Italy,
Florida, Singapore, and Hawaii. Moreover, the broadcasting satellite network is
made up of a combination of Intelsat and Telesat Ku-band satellite transponders
that downlink to the teleport infrastructures. Installation of this antenna would
be simple with minimum effects to the aircraft.
Today instant and uninterrupted airborne communications is a must globally
employing the breakthrough technology. However, the ZipPhaser-Air aviation
antenna system is the only low-proﬁle, 2-way, Ku-band antenna system for all
aircraft. Based on a unique ﬂat panel technology, this antenna system has been
especially designed to meet airlines expectation to provide reliable connectivity
and global coverage at unprecedented speed and quality. Proved and ﬂight
tested, this antenna system is selected by some of the top airlines in the industry
scheduled for service in 2010 and beyond.

Propagation and Interference
Consideration
Propagation and interference characteristics are very important for providing quality
and reliability of MSC propagation channels. The quality of service (QoS) can be
expressed in terms of the bit error rate (BER) performance, which depends on the
carrier-to-noise density ratio C/N0; meanwhile, the service reliability is manifested in
the relation of service availability. The intervening medium between MES within the
network and satellites is termed a transmission channel. The ﬁxed satellite services
have two constant channels between a minimum of two FES using the same space-
craft, while in the GMSC network there are two types of channels to be considered:
the variable channel between the MES and satellite or service link and the constant
channel between the LES (Gateway) and the satellite or feeder link. These two
channels have many different characteristics, which need to be taken into account
during the system design examination. The more critical are the variable channels
used by MES, since transmitter power, receiver gain, and satellite visibility is
sometimes quite restricted in comparison with the constant link. In this case, the
propagation path proﬁle between all kind of MES and satellites varies continuously
whenever the mobiles (ships, land vehicles, or airplanes) are in motion. These vari-
ations are most signiﬁcant and frequent in the case of maritime and aeronautical
environments.
The common satellite channel environment affects radiowave propagation in
changeless ways. The different parameters inﬂuenced are mainly path attenuation,
polarization, and noise. The factors to be considered are gaseous absorption in the
atmosphere, absorption, and scattering by clouds, fog, all precipitation, atmospheric
turbulence, and ionospheric effects. In this sense, several measurement techniques
serve to quantify these effects in order to improve reliability in the system design.
Because these factors are random events, GMSC system designers usually use a
statistical process in modeling their effects on radiowave propagation. To design an
effective GMSC model, it is necessary to consider the quantum of all propagation
characteristics, such as signal lost in normal environment, path depolarization
causes, transionospheric contribution, propagation effects important for mobile

systems, including reﬂection from the Earth’s surface, fading due to sea and land
reﬂection, signal blockage, and to the different local environmental interferences for
all mobile and handheld applications. At any rate, the local propagation charac-
teristics on the determinate geographical position have very speciﬁc statistical
proprieties and results for ships, vehicles, and aircraft.
On the other hand, for all navigation systems based on radio waves a sound
knowledge of wave parameters is crucial to enable us to make an accurate position
determination. The systems used for radio navigation operate at frequencies
between 10 kHz and 10 GHz, and the presentation is therefore limited to this
frequency range. As will be seen, there are wide propagation differences. Radio
waves are often described as having the properties of light and can be described by
traditional “wave” physics. Another important facet of radio engineering is the
geometry and the relationship between the transmitters and receivers, and the Earth
and space through which the radio waves are propagating.
5.1
Overview of Antennas for Radio and Satellite
Communications
Antennas act as converters between conducted waves and electromagnetic (EM),
electric, and magnetic waves propagating freely in space, which diagram is shown
in Fig. 5.1. Thus, transmitter (Tx) is radiating EM via antenna and receiver (Rx) is
detecting these EM affected by the propagation impairments. The name of antenna
is borrowed from zoology, in which the Latin word antennae are used to describe
the long, thin feelers possessed by many insects. In Fig. 5.2, it can be seen that the
antenna is an important element in any radio or satellite system because it acts like a
link of a chain. In such a way, the overall transmissions performances of radio
waves in open space are signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the performance of transmit and
receive antennas.
At ﬁrst glance, modern antennas may still look very similar to the ancient model
developed by Hertz and Popov. However, they are nowadays optimized at great
expense for their intended application. Communications antenna technology

primarily strives to transform one wave type into another with as little loss during
propagation as possible.
This requirement is less important in the case of test antennas, which are
intended to provide a precise measurement of the ﬁeld strength at the installation
site to a connected test receiver; instead, their physical properties need to be known
with high accuracy. The explanation of the physical parameters by which the
behavior of each communication antenna can be both described and evaluated is
probably of wider general use.
The principal values used to determine the overall loss value for a wireless
communication link include the free-space loss, in addition to any feed line loss at
the transmitting and receiving ends of the link, which can be negligible when
compared to the free-space segment losses.
In most cases, it is impractical to install an antenna that tracks the movements of
these spacecraft, and in this point, omnidirectional antennas are normally used.
Power levels for these types of installations must be carefully calculated so that a
sufﬁcient level of energy reaches the satellite regardless of its position in the sky at
any given moment.
Communication with GEO satellite is almost always done using a directional
parabolic reﬂector antenna. Since it is directional, the antenna must be accurately
pointed toward the satellite and then ﬁxed in place. Modern mobile satellite
antennas have tracking mechanism that is constantly keeping GEI satellite in focus.
All GEO satellites rotate about the Earth above the equator, and at the same
altitude, in the region of space known as the Clarke Belt. Before attempting to align
an antenna with GEO satellite, it is useful to imagine what the Clarke Belt would
look like if observer could see it in the sky from different locations on Earth.
The Clarke Belt forms an imaginary arc in the sky, which imagine in Fig. 5.3 is
showing azimuth and elevation angles of antennas in Local Horizontal plane in the
geographical north. If an observer is at the equator, the belt passes directly over his
overhead. If an observer is in the Northern Hemisphere, the belt stretches from the
horizon a little south of due east, rising to its maximum height directly toward the
south, and then reaching the horizon a few degrees south of due west. If an observer
is in the Southern hemisphere, the maximum height of the arc appears directly north
of his location.
The true azimuths of all GEO satellites than are visible from a location in the
Northern Hemisphere range from a little more than 90° to a little less than 270°. For
locations in the Southern Hemisphere, the true azimuths are greater than 270° or
less than 90°.

The elevation of GEO satellite can range from a little more than 0° in local
horizon to a maximum elevation that depends on the latitude of the Earth station
antenna. For antenna at the equator, the maximum possible elevation is equal to 90°
minus the latitude (φ) minus the apparent declination (d).
When the elevation angle to a GEO satellite is high, the path of the signal
through the atmosphere is relatively short and degradation due to the atmosphere is
low. However, when the elevation angle is low, the transmission signal follows a
much longer path through the atmosphere and degradation is higher. The effect is
signiﬁcant below 10° elevation and very severe below 5°.
5.2
Propagation Fundamentals
Before to introduce propagation of electromagnetic (EM) waves, the best way to
start is with providing elaboration of the following basic deﬁnitions:
1. Radio Frequency (RF)—This is a number of cycles per second or hertz (Hz) of
a radio wave using in transmission systems.
2. Transmitter (Tx)—This device converts electrical signals into emitted RF
energy. It is the source of a radiated wave or perturbation transmitted via
antenna, which is illustrated in Fig. 5.4a.

Propagation and Interference Consideration

3. Receiver (Rx)—It is equipment that receives RF energy via receiving antenna
and converts it back into electrical signals, which is illustrated in Fig. 5.4a.
4. Transmitter/Receiver (Tx/Rx)—This is an integrated device containing
transmitter (Tx) and receiver (Rx) and using common Tx/Rx antenna systems,
which is shown in Fig. 5.4b.
5. Propagation—It is the ability of a radio wave to travel between a transmitter
and a receiver in free space or in another medium such as air.
6. Aerial or Antenna—This can be considered as a part of the transmitter or
receiver system (or it can be in both). It is usually a passive device that converts
electrical signals straight into radio waves.
However, one of the main objectives in designing a communication system is to
guarantee a speciﬁc quality of service, which depends on given user requirements.
A key point for this design is the quality of the channel that is present in the link.
This channel varies in time, and in order to perform an estimation of the losses that
the signal will experiment, it is necessary to consider all the factors inﬂuencing the
signal attenuation. Thus, a thorough understanding of the propagation mechanisms
inﬂuencing radio waves propagating in the channel is therefore essential. The
propagation mechanisms affecting the link produce various effects in the signal,
which vary depending on the operating frequency. It is important to emphasize
considerable differences in the models operating at low frequency bands in relation
to the ones operating in upper bands.
Once these propagation effects have been studies, determined, and understood,
an analysis of their nature and statistical behavior is performed, so that they can be
represented and characterized through statistical models. In fact, by using these
models, it is then possible to develop more realistic channel models, which are then
applied when designing radio and satellite communication systems including
navigation networks stratospheric platforms. For the case of communication sys-
tems in general, it is necessary to consider environmental conditions deﬁned by the
scenario, as well as the phenomena affecting the link. A model, which clearly
characterizes signal affectations, will allow implementation of reliable and truthful
evaluation schemes.

5.2.1
Electromagnetic Vectors and Polarization
From basic physics, radio waves are considered to be EM in origin. The EM waves
have three perpendicular vectors describing their generation. An electrical vector
(E), a magnetic vector (H), and the propagation vector (V) have to be considered as
shown in Fig. 5.5.
A practical consideration here is the term polarity or polarization sense regarding
radio wave propagation. A general convention used in radio engineering is when
talking about polarization, where the electrical vector is being discussed. Vertical
polarization is when the electrical E ﬁeld is excited in a vertical direction relative to
the Earth’s surface, shown in Fig. 5.6a. Horizontal polarization is when the elec-
trical E ﬁeld is excited in a horizontal direction relative to the Earth’s surface,
shown in Fig. 5.6b. Circular polarization is a hybrid of both vertical and horizontal
polarity where the direction of the electrical ﬁeld excitation revolves between the
two planes going out along the axis of propagation, where V changes with prop-
agation, see Fig. 5.6c.

Speed of Propagation and Relationship
to Wavelength and Frequency
Electromagnetic waves travel at the same speed as light in a vacuum expressed by:
v ¼ fk
ð5:1Þ
where v is the velocity in meters per second (m/s), f is the frequency in hertz (Hz) or
cycles per second, and λ is the wavelength in meters (m).
In particular, in free space with vacuum conditions, v has been found to be a
constant denoted by c:
c ¼ 3  108m=s
ð5:2Þ
5.2.3
Radiowave Propagation
Radio waves travel in space as electrons at the speed of light approximately
300,000,000 m/sec. When radio waves are propagated from a transmitter antenna,
they form three modes of propagation path: surface, sky, and space wave propa-
gation, shown in Fig. 5.7a. Radio waves are generally transmitted from an antenna
omnidirectionally but transmission can be also modiﬁed in a directional path by
using a directional dish or antenna arrays.
The surface wave is a radio wave that is modiﬁed by the nature of the terrain
over which it travels. The surface wave propagation predominates at all radio

frequencies up to 3 MHz for VLF-, LF-, and MF-bands. Hence, sky waves are
severely inﬂuenced by the action of free electrons, called ions, in the upper
atmosphere, known as the ionosphere and are caused to be attenuated and reﬂected
and possibly returned to Earth. In fact, sky wave propagation predominates in the
HF-band between 3 and 30 MHz.
Above 30 MHz, the predominant mode of propagation of radio waves is by the
space wave. This wave, when propagated between 30 and 300 MHz into the tro-
posphere by an Earth VHF or UHF radio station, is subject to deﬂection by vari-
ations in the refractive index structure of the air through which it passes, which will
cause the radio wave to follow the Earth’s curvature for short distances up to about
100 km. However, space waves above 300 MHz propagated upwards, away from
the troposphere, may be termed free-space waves and are primarily used for satellite
communications.
While all transmitting antenna systems produce one or more of the three main
modes of propagation, one of the modes will predominate. The predominant mode
may be equated to the frequency used, as all other constraints remain constant.
Therefore, for the purposes of this explanation of propagated radio waves, it is
assumed that the mode of propagation is dependent upon the frequency used in an
adequate system, for that is the only parameter, which may be changed by an operator.
The simplest situation involving the transmission of information by EM waves is
when the Tx antenna transmits directly to the Rx antenna, without any obstacles in
the path through which the EM waves must travel. This situation occurs when both
antennas are located at a relatively short distance on the Earth’s surface with full
mutual visibility. As the distance between the two antennas increases due to the
Earth’s curvature, the EM waves are no longer in a direct path (line of sight).
In order to increase the path length, the antenna can be ﬁtted on a higher mast but
only to the extent that the costs do not become prohibitive. In this way, the problem
can be solved by means of forthcoming stratospheric platforms or communications
satellite payloads. Since these satellites are placed at very high altitudes, their reach
is far superior to that of the higher towers that can be built on the Earth’s surface,
see altitudes and other parameters in Table 5.1.
When two antennas situated on the Earth are very far apart and there is no
visibility between them, stratospheric platforms or satellites can be used to relay the

signals. There is otherwise visibility between the Tx antenna and the spacecraft
(platforms) and vice versa, between spacecraft (platforms) and Rx antenna.
At this point, the ways these signals will travel on their line of sight depend on
propagation characteristics and conditions of interference in the hypothetical
environment. Because communications satellites are located at higher altitudes
relative to the Earth’s surface than stratospheric platforms and masts, they cover a
wider area, which is beneﬁcial for ocean spaces, continents and for countries with
large dimensions.
5.2.4
Derivation of Free-Space Path Loss
It is necessary to deﬁne the loss between Tx and Rx antenna separated by a distance
from the transmission medium, assumed to be a vacuum and the antenna is isotropic.
It may serve either as Tx or Rx antenna in the radiation ﬁeld where it is situated.
Considering that the isotropic antenna radiates signals in all directions of its
spherical surface with total power ﬂow PT in Watts, including receiving antenna
gain, at a sufﬁciently large distance (d) in meters away from the center to the surface
of the sphere, the power ﬂux per unit area through any portion of the spherical
surface must be as follows:
Pfd ¼ PT=4pd2
ð5:3Þ
To introduce free-space path loss has to be considered a radio link that starts at
point PTx and is being received at point PRx, and assuming an isotropic transmitting
source PTx (Watts) and, in addition, has to be considered the power passing through
a unit aperture at distance d (meters) from the isotropic source (i.e., it needs to
consider this area as separate on the surface of the propagation sphere).
The amount of power that the receiving antenna absorbs in relation to the RF
power density of the EM ﬁeld is determined by its effective aperture, which is
deﬁned as the area of the incident EM wave front that has a power ﬂux equal to the
power dissipated in the load connected to the receive antenna output terminals.
Following the previous (Eq. 5.3) equation, the receiving power at a receiving
antenna can be expressed by
PRx ¼ PTðk=4pdÞ2 ¼ PT=Lf
ð5:4Þ
where λ = wavelength and Lf = free-space transmission loss, which can be given in
dB as follows:
Lf ¼ 10 log10ðPT=PRx ¼ 32:40 þ 20 log fMHz + 20 log dkm
ð5:5Þ
where f = frequency of the emitted radio ﬁeld in dB and d = distance in km
between Tx and Rx antenna. Thus, free-space loss is related to operating frequency
5.2
Propagation Fundamentals
401

and transmission distance. Figure 5.7b shows free-space loss as a function of fre-
quency in GHz for a distance of 36,000 km.
The power ﬂux passing through this an area on the surface in respect of Tx
power is as follows:
Pfd ¼ PTxðk=4pdÞ2
ð5:6Þ
Power ﬂux density can be also denoted as Ψ (W/m2).
Now it has to consider an isotropic receiving antenna placed on this sphere. An
isotropic receive antenna located on this sphere will absorb power from the radi-
ation ﬁeld it is situated in. The amount of power that the receiving antenna absorbs
in relation to the RF power density of the ﬁeld is determined by the effective
aperture of the antenna in square meters. For an isotropic antenna, the effective
aperture Ac is given by
Ac ¼ k2=4p
ð5:7Þ
Therefore, the received power into an isotropic antenna is
PRx ¼ k2Pf=4p
ð5:8Þ
Substituting Eqs. (5.6) and (5.7) into (5.8) is giving the following relation:
PRx ¼ k2PTx=ð4pdÞ2
ð5:9Þ
Taking logs of each side of the equation is coming as follows:
10log10PTx  10log10PRx ¼ 20log10ð4pÞ þ 20log10ðd)  20log10ðkÞ
ð5:10Þ
The expression 10log10 PTx–10log10 PRx is the difference in what is transmitted
and what is received called path loss or sometimes called free-space path loss:
Lfspl ¼ 10log10PTx  10log10PRx
ð5:11Þ
Or substituting Eqs. (2.11) into (2.12) can be presented as follows:
Lfspl ¼ 20log10ð4pÞ þ 20log10ðdÞ þ 20log10ðfÞ  20log (3  108Þ
ð5:12Þ
To have a more practical form, it has to be included distance in kilometers and
frequency in MHz by the following equation now becomes

ð5:13Þ
This is, one of the most important radio formulae, which is reproduced in the
ITU Recommendation PN 525-2 “Calculation of free-space attenuation.”
5.2.5
Isotropic Power Source
One of the most important concepts in radio engineering is that of an isotropic
power source, which has the following deﬁnitions:
1. It is from a pinpoint source of inﬁnitesimal low volume (i.e., volume ≈0 m3);
2. It radiates radio power uniformly in all directions (i.e., the envelope of propa-
gation is an outwardly expanding sphere); and
3. It has no loss.
Obviously this is an ideal situation that cannot exist in practice. However, this
concept is the central method of referencing nearly all radio calculations and for
benchmarking most radio systems and antennas.
5.2.6
Power Flux Density and Electric Field Strength
The new concept of Pfd, Ψ, or S can be deﬁned as the amount of power radiated per
unit area from an isotropic source at a point some distanced from the isotropic
source. From the geometry and the deﬁnition of isotropic:
W or Pfd or ðSÞ ¼ PTx=ð4pdÞ2
ð5:14Þ
From basic physics, remember (a) Ohm’s law V = IR (where V is the voltage in
Volts, I is the current in amperes and r is the resistance in Ohms (Ω), and (b) the
electrical power equation P = I × V (where P is power in Watts). Using the two
equations above can be produced new relations:
P ¼ V2=R
ð5:15Þ
There is an equivalent analogous version for radio propagation:
Pfd ¼ E2=Z
ð5:16Þ
5.2
Propagation Fundamentals
403

where E is a new concept called ﬁeld strength and is measured in volts per meter
(V/m), and the impedance of free space (Z) is known to be a constant:
Z ¼ 120p or 380X
ð5:17Þ
However, now a relationship between Ψ, Pfd (S), and ﬁeld strength E can be

10logS ¼ 20logE  10log (377)
W or PfdðS)(dBW=m2Þ ¼ E(dBV=m)  10log (377)
ð5:18Þ
Sometimes, it is more useful to consider ﬁeld strength in dBμV/m. Therefore, the
formula becomes with new relations:
W or S(dBW=m2Þ ¼ E(dBlV=m)  60  60  25:76
W or S(dBW=m2Þ ¼ E(dBlV=m)  145:76

This is also a very useful formula giving a direct relationship between ﬁeld
strength and Pfd at the same geometrical point.
The relationship between ﬁeld strength and transmitted power can be explained
by the theme of the electrical ﬁeld strength and combining Eqs. (5.15.) and (2.17.)
in the following relation:

Taking logs is getting the following relations:

Refraction, Absorption, and Non-LOS Propagation
Discussion has so far been mainly concentrated on how radio waves propagate in free
space with line-of-sight (LOS) conditions. This describes the majority case for mobile
solutions and most situations can be approximated to this. Occasionally, however,
mobiles and especially aircraft will not have LOS to the nearest ground node.
This is usually the case on a long approach, or approach in mountainous terrain
or when the station is over the horizon. At such lower altitudes, other propagation
mechanisms can come into effect, such as refraction, reﬂection, and ground
wave/sky wave.

Propagation and Interference Consideration

5.3.1
Refraction
Refraction effect as a propagation mechanism has two possible solutions: layer
refraction and obstacle refraction.
1. Layer
Refraction—The
k
factor
starts
to
introduce
the
concept
of
non-straight-line radio beams. This is essentially incremental refraction occur-
ring at every point along the beam. Much study and prediction of this has been
carried out by ITU-R and archived in the P (propagation) archives (in particular
‘ITU-R P-453-95’).
Thus, the radio refractive index: its formula and refractivity data are presented in
Fig. 5.8a. Of course, in the limit, the phenomenon of total internal refraction or
“ducting” occurs and a radio beam can extend well beyond its natural horizon
limits, see Fig. 5.8b. In fact, this angle of incidence is equal to angle of refraction.
These refractive layers sometimes are called ducts. Each layer has a different gas
density and hence refractivity index.
2. Obstacle Refraction—A second type of refraction that occurs is that when the
radio wave (showing its wave physics properties) is blocked by either a smooth
obstacle that encroaches into its path or a knife-edge obstacle encroaching into
its path. An attenuation of the beam occurs as a function of the Fresnel physics.
In Fig. 5.9a is shown a smooth edge diffraction point, while in Fig. 5.9b is
presented a knife-edge diffraction point.
Therefore, in both samples diffraction signal is attenuated as a function and
Fresnel zone clearances over diffraction surface. In addition, it can be presented
attenuation as a function of geometry by relative attenuation in free space and
obstacle clearance.

5.3.2
Attenuation from Atmosphere Absorption
Consider the molecular properties of radio waves and the concept that radio waves
travel through gaseous medium. As the radio signal is promulgated through this
medium, the gases take some of the energy out of the radio wave, particularly if the
resonant frequency of the gas molecule under consideration is at or near the fre-
quency of the radio wave. This phenomenon is called absorption.
1. Water Absorption—For terrestrial signal paths operating below about 5 GHz
frequency multipaths, ﬂat fading or selective fading (sometimes called fast
fading) is the signiﬁcant contributor to degradation from the free-space path loss
condition (or fading as it is called). The gaseous absorption loss is usually
negligible. Above the frequency of 5 GHz, water absorption particularly
becomes more signiﬁcant and usually is the dominant mechanism for fading on
a terrestrial path. The proportion of the time for which the severe attenuation
occurs is usually only when the path is subject to medium to heavy rain. The
topographic rain proﬁle of an area is an important feature to such paths. The ITU
organization has studied these rain proﬁles and categorized each area of the
world with a proﬁle letter designation. (CCIR have rain zone tables and pre-
diction methods; see rain zones described in ITU-CCIR Report 563-2.) In
particular, the temperate climates are found to be less prone to rain fading than
are the tropics, e.g., Northern Europe ranges from zone C to G, the subtropics
are ranging typically to K and the tropics can go from M up to W and X. When
designing links or paths, consideration of the rain zones should be given.
For ICAO, the worst rain zone attenuations usually have to be considered when
designing radio systems for operation in all regions of the world (Fig. 2.15).
2. Oxygen Absorption and Other Gases—Of lesser signiﬁcance is absorption
from other atmospheric gases, particularly oxygen. The frequencies of 6 and
13 GHz are where oxygen absorption peaks (See CCIR Report 719). At lower
HF and VHF radio frequencies, gaseous absorption is negligible. In Table 5.2
are presented samples for CCIR rain regions.
5.3.3
Non-LOS Propagation
There are a number of other mechanisms for which propagation can happen in
non-direct LOS. These are via ground wave propagation (which tends to be more
signiﬁcant at low or very low frequencies, in kilohertz or less), reﬂection, and
refraction (which are both related and similar), which are prevalent in the HF-,
VHF-, and UHF-bands. In the following, these will be considered in more detail.
1. Ground Wave Propagation—This is when radio waves follow the curvature of
the Earth. This is particularly the case for low frequencies and very low fre-
quencies in the kilohertz region. Ground waves that follow the Earth must be
406

Propagation and Interference Consideration

vertically polarized. The attenuation is a function of frequency and is lower at
lower frequency. Generally, ground wave propagation is not appropriate for
aeronautical purposes, either in frequency (the aeronautical bands are too high in
frequency) or application. Fig. 5.10a shows the way that ground wave follows
contour of Earth’s surface.
2. Reﬂection and Multipath—The HF-, VHF-, and UHF-bands including micro-
wave frequencies lend themselves easily to reﬂection, refraction, and multipath.
This is when by the law of physics; a ray is incident to a “reﬂective surface” (and
this can be, for example, still water, land, metal, or a highly conductive surface).
In undergoing a reﬂection, usually some losses are incurred, but these can be
small, in which case a reﬂected ray can be comparable with a direct ray in terms of
incident power. From a practical perspective, this is the reason why these fre-
quencies are often chosen for radar systems, which exploit this property.
For mobile communications, in some cases, this can be a favorable property,
extending range and saturating coverage for certain systems (i.e., cellular mobiles)
in a cluttered urban environment where frequencies of 400 and 800 MHz are well
known for their good properties of bouncing off walls and propagating through
windows and tunnels. Also for aviation, the property can be useful, particularly at
HF where relatively low-loss reﬂections can be used to provide long-range radio.

Refraction, Absorption, and Non-LOS Propagation
407

However, in other aeronautical applications, particularly between low-altitude
transceivers, usually it can also lead to severe attenuations even when direct LOS
exists and is a very undesirable phenomenon. There are many models derived for
terrestrial non-LOS, usually based on the two-ray model or the extended and
advanced work on this theme by Hata and Okumura.
5.3.4
Two-Ray Model
Consider an instance where two signals (one usually direct and one indirect) from
the same source arrive at a receiver. Constructive or destructive fading can take
place, resulting in either good or bad signal reception, shown in Fig. 5.10b.
This phenomenon is called multipath and becomes very signiﬁcant for marginal
LOS cases or radio communications close to the Earth’s surface, particularly over
water or in metallic cluttered environments such as around airports. Of course the
theme can be extended where multiple indirect rays can be arriving at the receiver
with or without a direct ray, compounding the complexity and uncertainty of the
situation.
Hata and Okamura extensively studied this phenomenon regarding its applica-
tions to mobile communications. It can even be exploited thoroughly in some
instances, but generally, it is a nuisance and countermeasures are used to cancel the
destructive interference aspects (using equalization techniques, delay equalization
processing or data interleaving techniques, to name just a few of the system
measures to be discussed later.) When multipath occurs and the delay period is less
than a data period between two symbol states in the digital environment, inter-
symbol interference will occur. This can be seen when observing a data stream at
the intermediate frequency (IF) level through an “eye diagram.” The eye will close
as a function of how much reﬂected signal is arriving at the receiver and the
intersymbol interference builds. Fig. 5.11 is illustrated example transmitted and
received data stream in a multipath environment.

Propagation and Interference Consideration

5.4
Sky Wave Propagation
Sky wave propagation is an extension of the reﬂection theme. The waves that rely on
the refractive properties of the ionosphere to propagate long distances are considered
as sky waves, shown in Fig. 5.12a. In the limit, a refraction becomes a reﬂection and
hence the relationship to reﬂections. This phenomenon is very frequent below
30 MHz. These properties are useful in that long-range communications can be
provided well over the horizon. The HF-band (3–30 MHz) is well suited for this and
aviation and other radio users exploit this band for this very purpose. Conversely, the
reﬂective properties of the ionosphere can occur into the low VHF-band (above
30 MHz) and even beyond for a low proportion of time into the aeronautical com-
munications band (currently 118–137 MHz). This is usually more of a problem
where coverage can overreach past the horizon into an adjacent area sometimes up to
1000 km away using the same frequency for a different application of airspace and
consequently causing interference. The HF-band traditionally is considered to extend
from 3 to 30 MHz. The aeronautical HF-band, however, is considered to extend a
little before this to start at 2 MHz and run up to 22 MHz. In the early days of radio,
especially marine radio, HF was a favorite band because the propagation properties
are such that under certain conditions the wave can totally internally reﬂect or “skip”
its way right around the Earth. In addition, the antenna properties are very efﬁcient
and ﬁnally, the Tx/Rx was easily designed and economic. Today, this still holds true.
5.4.1
Ionosphere
The ionosphere extends nominally from 60 to 400 km above the Earth’s surface. It
is so-called as the particles in this region are easily ionized, giving its special
electrical properties.

Sky Wave Propagation

Under certain conditions, the HF radio waves will refract and in the limit totally
internally reﬂect or “duct,” shown in Fig. 5.12b. Theoretically, there are a number
of layers that exist. The D layer runs from height 60 to 90 km and the E layer from
90 to 150 km. The F1 layer runs from 150 to 250 km, and the F2 layer from 250 to
400 km. The propagation conditions during day and nighttime are providing the
different effects as follows:
1. Daytime—In general, the lower layers absorb lower frequencies typically up to
10 MHz during the daytime, and the higher frequencies typically 10–30 MHz
are reﬂected off the F1 layer, shown in Fig. 5.13a.
2. Nighttime—In general, the D and E layers disappear and the F layer reﬂects
frequencies below typically 10 MHz (the higher frequencies pass straight
through the ionosphere without refracting/reﬂecting), shown in Fig. 5.13b.
Unfortunately, with HF there is an element of “luck” or randomness to these
general
rules.
ITU
recommendation
P.533-7—“HF
Propagation
Prediction
Method,” gives an interesting insight into this. It provides a theoretical method to
calculate which frequencies are most suitable at which times. It identiﬁes a couple
of the following concepts:
1. Maximum Usable Frequency—This is a median value, which is getting sta-
tistically. The chances at the time of validity of an HF channel frequency being
“open” above this value are 50 %.
2. Highest Possible Frequency—This is the HF, above which statistically there is
only a 10 % chance of the frequency being open.

Propagation and Interference Consideration

3. Optimum Working Frequency—This is the highest HF that gives an 85 %
likelihood of the channel being open.
4. Critical Frequency—This is the highest radio frequency that is returned in
ionosphere layer. Thus, this can be applied for all path lengths from hundreds of
kilometers up to beyond 9000 km. (This is effectively half-way around the
world, which is as far as you can practically go.)
This theory also investigates the various modes discussed above in detail
(e.g., E modes up to 4000 km range and F2 modes for all distances).
There is a complex formula given in this recommendation:

Where p’ is virtual slant range (km) and c is the velocity of light (3 × 108 m/s).
5. Practical Measurements (Ionosphere Sounding)—This is a technique fre-
quently used in practice to gauge the current ionosphere conditions and to be
able to predict propagation. In its simplest form, consider sending a multifre-
quency signal straight up perpendicularly to Earth’s surface and measure which
frequency components are returned.
A number of services send out “squitters” or multifrequency components like
this in their transmissions, and receivers can look at what they receive and
analyze, and from this evaluate what the current propagation conditions are and
which frequencies are best to use at that moment in time. In reality, this practical
approach is found to be a more powerful method than the theory.
6. Solar Flares and Sunspot Activity—Solar ﬂares present total ionization of a
speciﬁc frequency and thus can wipe out HF communication ability on a par-
ticular channel for minutes or hours. There is a random nature to their occur-
rences, although sunspot activity can be correlated with 11-year solar cycles.

5.4.2
Propagation Distance of Satellite and Atmospheric
Losses
Probably, the most signiﬁcant factor for satellite communications is the distance
between the satellite and the Earth (or the distance between satellites for inter-
satellite communication). This introduces signiﬁcant delay time between transmit-
ted and received signals. Also this has a direct bearing on the path attenuation (from
the free-space path equation derived earlier, see Eq. (2.15)), which tends to be
relatively large in satellite communications.
By contrast, satellite beams cut up through the atmosphere and quickly pass
through the absorption/precipitation zone (usually this is less than 1 % of their path
length) (the exception being at the poles to geostationary satellites (above the
equator) where precipitation is much less anyway) and so rain and gaseous atten-
uation generally becomes insigniﬁcant.
For aeronautical applications, the main frequency bands of interest to aviation
are L-band 1.4 GHz; C-band 4 and 6 GHz, and Ku-band 12–14 GHz, where the
losses are minimal for satellite paths and international allocations have been made.
Doppler effects can be signiﬁcant to the radio systems at the satellite end, as a
satellite can be maneuvering at “galactic” speeds to maintain its orbital position.
There are generally three types of satellites:
High Earth orbit (HEO) or sometimes called GEO are the ones that are in
stationary (relative to Earth movement) orbit at nominally 35,000 km above the
equator. That is where the gravitational pull or centripetal force on the object
balances or equals the centrifugal force of the object spinning with a period of one
day. By the nature of physics, there is a time delay of 1/8 of a second in a radio
beam traveling from the Earth’s surface to such a satellite. These satellites are used
extensively for a number of communications applications by civil aviation, military,
and for entertainment broadcast and passenger services. These are the most com-
mon satellites presently used by civil aviation.
As discussed earlier, two other kinds of satellites are MEO and LEO satellites.
These ﬂy closer to the Earth and consequently are moving relative to the Earth’s
surface and will be perceived to go though a trajectory from one horizon to the
other when being observed on the ground (sometimes within a few minutes). The
lower the satellite, the shorter the trajectory period.
Also of consequence is that the latency or signal delay to these satellites is much
reduced and the frequency reuse is much higher due to the ability of multiple
satellites to be shielded from each other by the Earth itself. These satellites are not
currently used by aeronautical applications (other than by exception the military
ones); however, they could be used in future applications where they are more
attractive for latency/voice critical applications.

Propagation and Interference Consideration

5.4.3
Propagation Caused by Doppler Effect
In its simplest form, the Doppler effect is when an object with vector velocity
relative to a receiver is transmitting a certain frequency that is perceived to be
different due to either the waveforms being compressed (if the vector is toward the
receiver) or elongated (if the vector is away from the receiver). Remember the
school physics example of a ﬁre engine coming toward a person with its siren on
and as it passes and moves away, the note or tone apparently drops a pitch. The
same applies to radio systems.
Considering Eqs. (5.1) and (5.2), the stationary receiver is receiving waves from
a stationary source. Within a given second, the number of cycles received at the
receiver would be received cycles = c/λ.
On the other hand, considering a source moving toward the receiver would be
received cycles = (c + y)/λ, where y is the speed in meters per second of source.
Therefore,
fapparent ¼ fcarrier  ðc þ yÞ=k
ð5:24Þ
This formula is valid for transmitting sources traveling toward or way from the
target. The argument can be further extended if both the transmitter and receiver are
moving.
5.5
Atmospheric Effects on Propagation
This study deals with propagation effects in all regions of the atmosphere and free
space, including the Earth’s ionosphere. Namely, most of the Earth’s weather
precipitation and hydrometeors occur in the troposphere, which is the non-ionized
region from the Earth’s surface up to a height of about 15 km above the surface at
the equator. The thickness of the troposphere decreases toward the poles. Therefore,
propagation effects in the troposphere tend to increase in importance as the RF
increases above 1 GHz. For GMSC systems, the effects of reﬂection from the
Earth’s surface are critically important at even lower RF.
At frequencies below about 1 GHz, the most important region of the Earth’s
atmosphere is the ionosphere, the ionized region above the stratosphere, within
which low RF propagation effects are quite strong. Propagation effects within the
ionosphere have an inﬂuence on the terrestrial and Earth space paths from VLF- to
SHF-bands. However, it should be borne in mind that for an RF-band range below a
certain number of GHz, the ionospheric propagation effects can be quite important
and for frequencies above a certain number of GHz, tropospheric effects may be
negligible. At this point, radiowave signals passing through the atmosphere or over
the surface of the Earth begin to lose strength. The decrease of signal due to the
medium through which it passes is called attenuation.
5.4
Sky Wave Propagation
413

5.5.1
Propagation Effects of the Troposphere
The troposphere extends upwards from the Earth’s surface to a height of approx-
imately 15 km, where it meets the stratosphere. More exactly, at the boundary
between the two spaces there is a region called the tropopause, which possesses a
different refractive index to each neighboring layer. The effect exhibited by the
tropopause on a space wave is to produce a downward bending action, causing it to
follow the Earth’s curvature. Hence, the bending radius of the radio wave is not as
severe as the curvature of the Earth; nevertheless, the space wave will propagate
beyond the visual horizon. In practice, the radio horizon exceeds the visual horizon
by approximately 15 %. This effect is known to navigators whereby the surface
radar range of a maritime PPI radar picture extends slightly beyond the horizon.
5.5.1.1
Attenuation Due to Atmospheric Gases
The different types of gases present in the atmosphere may attenuate the electro-
magnetic waves, which is caused by the molecular absorption of the atmospheric
constituents and is strongly frequency dependent.
The main contributors to this attenuation below 70 GHz are water vapor and
oxygen. Thus, absorption increases as elevation angle is reduced, which at any
frequency is a function of temperature, pressure, humidity of the atmosphere, and
the elevation angle of the satellite.
At sufﬁciently high frequencies, EM waves interact with the molecules of
atmospheric gases to cause attenuation. These interactions occur at resonance radio
frequencies and are apparent in plots of zenith (90° elevation angle) attenuation
versus frequency, as shown in Fig. 5.14a. This is the theoretical total estimated
one-way attenuation for vertical paths through the atmosphere, where solid curves
are for moderately humid atmosphere, dashed curves represent the limits for 0 %
and 100 % relative humidity, V is vertical polarization, and A denotes limits of
uncertainty, for a vertical Earth space path as a function between 1 and 200 GHz at
45° north latitude using US standard atmosphere.
It may be noted that the speciﬁc frequency bands where the absorption is high
are about 22.23 GHz caused by vapor (left peak in the curve) and centered between
53.50 and 65.20 GHz caused by oxygen (right peak in the curve). Meanwhile, in
the frequency range of current interest about 1–18 GHz the zenith one-way
absorption is in the range of 0.03–0.20 dB and 0.35–2.30 at 5° elevation. The
corresponding upper limit for 100 % humidity is 0.7 dB at zenith and 8 dB at 5°
elevation. Therefore, these effects are not very important for GMSC systems
because the inﬂuence of attenuation due to atmospheric gases can be effectively
ignored at frequencies below 10 GHz.
414

Propagation and Interference Consideration

5.5.1.2
Attenuation by Precipitation and Hydrometeors
Hydrometeors are condensed water vapors existing in the atmosphere, such as
cloud, fog, rain, hail, and snow. The last three forms of atmospheric water are called
precipitation. They produce transmission impairments and attenuation by absorbing
and scattering the energy of radio waves.
1. Clouds and Fog—Cloud and fog may cause attenuation but much less than that
caused by light rain of about 10 mm/h. Clouds and fog are suspended water
droplets, usually less than about 0.10 mm in diameter, whose effect is signiﬁcant
only for systems operating above 10 GHz. It is important to note that attenuation
to radio waves depends on the liquid water content of the atmosphere along the
propagation path. Clouds have liquid contents from 0.05 to 5 g/m3 and their
formation shape can be due to a variety of atmospheric processes, which result in
cloud layer types for each of three cloud heights: low, middle, and high.
Thunderstorm cumulonimbus high clouds cause the maximum attenuation. The
fog liquid content is in the order of about 0.40 g/m3 and typically fog extends from
2 to 8 km. The attenuation from fog is negligible for satellite communications.
2. Rain—Rain precipitation is the most signiﬁcant contribution to atmospheric
attenuation, which is caused by radiowave absorption and scattering from
raindrops. First of all, to evaluate this additional rain loss, it is necessary to
obtain the expected rainfall rate in mm/hr for the region of the communication
link. For this reason, in Fig. 5.14b are presented six curves, which can be used
to read off dB losses per EM path length at the operating frequencies. Namely,

these curves are generated from a combination of empirical data and mathe-
matical models that ﬁt this data. Rainfall rate distribution is inhomogeneous in
space and time and can impair a satellite communications link at radio fre-
quencies above 10 GHz, as well as increase the noise temperature and
impairment, or cross-polarization discrimination. Rain gauge records show short
intervals of higher rain rates occurring in longer periods of lighter rain.
Therefore, various precipitation methods have been proposed for predicting rain
attenuation statistics calculations from rainfall rate measurements near the signal
path. The slant path rain attenuation prediction is based on the estimation of the
attenuation exceeded at 0.01 % of the time A0.01 from the rainfall rate R0.01 (mm/h),
exceeding at the same time percentage. The effective path length is given by the
formula:
A0:01 ¼cR Le ¼cR Lsr0:01 ½dB
ð5:25Þ
where γR (dB/km) = speciﬁc attenuation, Le is the effective path length, Ls = slant
path length and r0.01 = path reduction factor. The spatial structure of rain can be
modeled by an equivalent rain cell of uniform rainfall rate with a rectangular cross
section of equivalent length L0 and effective height hR–hS in the plane of the path,
see Fig. 5.15a.
The relation for slant path length for elevation angles above 5° is as follows:
Ls ¼ hR  hS=sinh ½km
ð5:26Þ
and for elevation angles less than 5° is
Ls ¼ 2ðhR  hSÞ= sin2h þ 2ðhR  hSÞ=Re

1=2 þ sinh [km]
ð5:27Þ
where θ = path elevation angle and Re = effective radius of the Earth (8500 km).
Thus, using simple trigonometry relations the horizontal projection is given by the
following formula:

The reduction factor has the following relation:

For example, the speciﬁc attenuation using the frequency-dependent coefﬁcients
k and α gives the following expression:

Values of the frequency-dependent coefﬁcients are shown in Table 5.3. Values
not given there can be obtained by interpolation using logarithmic scales for fre-

parameters can also be obtained by the following equations:

be obtained by relation:
Ap ¼ A0:010:12  p  ð0:546 þ 0:043logPÞ
ð5:32Þ
At this point, for percentages of the time outside the 0.001–0.1 % is a relatively
complicated procedure, while the predicted attenuation exceeded for 0.01 % for an
average year can be is A0.01 = 9.8 dB.
Finally, the estimated attenuation exceeded for any other percentages of the time
P may be calculated from A0.01 by the expression:
Ap ¼ A0:01ðP=0:01Þ  a ½dB

The cumulative distribution, for example, of the rain attenuation statistics is
illustrated in Fig. 5.15b.

instantaneous value of the cross-polar discrimination (XPD) effect, which may
accompany a given attenuation. Hail, with its ice meteors, causes a small loss
due to scattering but not due to absorption.
Dry snow likewise does not absorb radiowave energy, however, the water
content of wet snow dropping slowly through the ray path causes more absorption
than would arise if the same amount of water were falling as rain.
5.5.1.3
Sand and Dust Effects
The Earth’s atmosphere contains a variety of solid particles in suspension, whose
size range from aerosols of approximately 50 μm to coarse dust about 1 mm. Thus,
if the size of particles is larger, they fall out of suspension more quickly but aerosols
can remain aloft for days and sometimes can be carried high up into the strato-
sphere. Aerosol and small solid particles do not signiﬁcantly affect the propagation
of EM until the optical frequencies are approached and their extinction cross section
becomes appreciable. The effect of ﬁne and coarse dust on the radiowave path can
be noticeable at much lower frequencies and so in many cases, the impact is usually
difﬁcult to separate from the meteorological phenomena that often accompany the
dust storms. Then, enhanced humidity or even rain that might accompany a severe
convective activity in an arid region might cause the dust particles to attenuate more
strongly than would be the case in a dry atmosphere due to water uptake into the
crystal structure of the particles themselves. The strong winds that generate a dust
storm may cause antenna depointing that will lead to a loss of radio signal strength,
which is difﬁcult to distinguish from the attenuating effect of dust particles.
An intensive study of the sand and dust particle effects on 4/6 and 11/14 GHz of
satellite paths made a clear distinction between dust and sand. Sand particles have
limits from 10 to 100 μm and are usually restricted to within 10 m of the Earth’s
surface and in this case their impact on the satellite link due to radio propagation
effects is usually insigniﬁcant at elevation angles above 5°. On the other hand, dust
particle sizes are below 10 μm and can come up to 1000 m in the atmosphere. Sand
particles can absorb about 1 % and dust particles can absorb 6–9 % of air humidity.
Thus, severe dust storms occur in eight desert areas with average wind speeds from
6 to 22 m/s, gust speed is from 15 to 50 m/s, width and length of affected area is
maximum 8000 km; dust can spread up to 12 km high in the atmosphere, expected
visibility is from 0 to 1000 m in a severe storm and the duration of events is from a
few hours to 2 weeks. The location and direction of the dust storms are in the
vicinity of big desert areas, such as the southwest part of the USA, central and
southern part of the South American Continent, northern and southern African
Continent, around the Caspian Sea and Persian Gulf including central Asia and
regions of the northwest and east coast of Australia. The main sources of heavy dust
storms are big deserts such as the Sahara and the Kalahari, including nearby areas
affected by Haboob storms.
418

Propagation and Interference Consideration

Namely, the Haboob storm is a direct result of a thunderstorm generated by a
strong and cold wind, known as a cold dust storm. The severe turbulence and
gusting in this storm area leads to very high suspended dust densities, which give
rise to a signiﬁcant reduction of optical visibility. For this reason, optical visibility
has been used as a classiﬁcation mechanism for dust storm effects. The principal
criterion applied to deﬁning the occurrence of a dust storm is when visibility drops
below 1 km and when the duration of storm activities lasts from a few hours to
174 days in the various eight desert regions on Earth.
At this point, if parameters kr and ki are the real and imaginary parts of the
complex relative dielectric constant of the dust particles, respectively, the speciﬁc
attenuation (Flock 1987) can be given by
As ¼ 189r=Vk 3ki=ðkr þ 2Þ2 þ k2
i

ð5:34Þ
where r = radius [m]; V = visibility 2 m above the ground [km], and λ =
wavelength [m].
Table 5.3 gives typical results of attenuation predictions for nominated fre-
quencies and where circular dust particles are assumed to have a uniform distri-
bution. In any event, the speciﬁc attenuation is signiﬁcant when Ka-band
frequencies are employed on 20/30 GHz.
Even then, it is only in relatively humid air with about 10 % water uptake that
the path attenuation approaches 2 dB. The value of XPD for depolarization is
almost benign until the visibility becomes very small, about 2 m, and the elevation
angle is low. However, if the air becomes more humid and the dust particles absorb
the moisture, the XPD values are worsened by about 5 dB. On some paths, for
elevation angles below 10° and for some frequencies below 10 GHz, a severe dust
storm that contains a large proportion of moist particles could cause the XPD to fall
below 12 dB.
In general, however, for satellite communications link paths, the radiowave
impairments caused by sand and dust storms are signiﬁcantly less of a problem than
the mechanical difﬁculties they may cause, such as severe wind gusts and dust in
the antenna feeds and auxiliary equipment.
5.5.1.4
Site Diversity Factors
Path diversity in satellite systems involves the provision of alternate propagation
paths for signal transmission, with the capability to select the least-impaired path
when conditions warrant. In this case, implementation of path diversity requires the
deployment of two or more interconnected Earth terminals at spatially separated
sites, hence the use of the term “site diversity.” This combination is considerable
when an LES is being used for a commercially or militarily important purpose,
where an outage is considered more serious, e.g., as the head end of a cable system,
the probability of an outage can be reduced by having a second LES a few
5.5
Atmospheric Effects on Propagation
419

kilometers away and using whichever has the better signal at moment. Therefore,
this is because heavy rain, in particular, tends to be quite localized and would
probably not impact both stations at the same time.
5.5.1.5
Other Diversity Schemes
Without an ability to increase the margin (e.g., through the application of power
control via additional transmit gain and power, or increased resource allocation in
the TDMA frame), there are basically three types of diversity schemes that can be
used by satellite systems to overcome impairments at a given LES.
1. Orbital Diversity—This diversity is different from site diversity in that only
one LES site is used. To achieve a measure of diversity, the LES uses two
antennas that can access different satellites simultaneously and is not necessarily
the diversity-interconnecting link between sites that is required for site diversity.
However, to obtain signiﬁcant decorrelation of concurrent attenuations along the
two paths, the angle between the two paths at the LES must be large. Inasmuch
as this angle is large, at least one or even both of the links will be at a relatively
low elevation angle and therefore encounter a greater degree of impairment than
at higher elevation angles. In general, the achievable diversity gain is very small,
with values of about 2–3 dB in the 14/11 GHz bands.
2. Frequency Diversity—Path losses caused by particulates on the path increase
as the frequency increases, particularly for rain. In effect, at 6/4 GHz, attenua-
tion due to rain is negligible; at 14/11 GHz it can be signiﬁcant in high rainfall
regions of the world; at 30/20 GHz, it is the dominant link impairment nearly
everywhere.
At this point, if it is possible to switch communication transmissions to a
lower-frequency band, signiﬁcant increases in availability might be achieved.
This capability requires that both frequency bands (the higher, impaired one and
the lower one to which the communication channels are to be switched) be
simultaneously available at the LES in question. Furthermore, there must be
spare capacity available in the lower-frequency spectrum whenever needed,
implying that signiﬁcant spare capacity must be provided if the link is a
high-capacity channel and that the complete network need to be under dynamic
control. Namely, both elements require signiﬁcant investment. Should such
dynamic network control features be in place and the additional capacity in the
lower-frequency band is available on-call, frequency diversity can therefore
undoubtedly provide large increases in availability.
3. Time Diversity—Severe rain events do not usually last long at a given location.
Thus, this characteristic can be used in any communication RF link that does not
require interaction between the caller and the receiver. The service can be said to
be acceptable if, for example, a fax is successfully sent without any error within
a two-hour period. The delay in sending the fax can be considered a form of
time diversity. This feature could also be used with advantage to determine the
420
5
Propagation and Interference Consideration

capacity requirement of a given RF link for optimal economic performance.
Thus, if a link is sized for a maximum anticipated capacity, it will have excess
capacity for most of the time. If some transmissions can be delayed and sent, for
example, at off-peak times, the capacity requirements can be reduced. The time
delay could therefore be used either at times of peak capacity (i.e., the equiv-
alent of call-blocking) or when the LES is undergoing a severe rain event.
5.5.2
Clear-Sky Effects on Atmospheric Propagation
Radio signals traveling through the atmosphere layers suffer attenuation even
during ﬁne weather. In any event, the clear-sky attenuation is mainly the result of
absorption of energy from the transmission by water vapor and oxygen molecules,
although there are other modes of clear-sky affect that have inﬂuences on
propagation.
1. Defocusing and Wave-Front Incoherence Contribution—Several expres-
sions have already been evaluated and are provided in No 2.3.2 of ITU-R P.618
recommendation to estimate the defocusing (beam-spreading) losses on paths at
very low elevation angles. Otherwise, the loss is implicitly accounted for in the
prediction methods for low-angle fading found in articles No 2.4.2 and 2.4.3 of
the recommendation.
Hence, small-scale irregularities of the refractive index structure of the atmo-
sphere cause incoherence in the wave front at the receiving antenna. In any case,
this will result in both rapid radio signal ﬂuctuations and an antenna-to-medium
coupling loss that can be described as a decrease of the antenna gain. In practice,
signal loss due to wave-front incoherence is therefore probably only signiﬁcant
for large-aperture antennas, high frequencies, and elevation angles below 5°.
Measurements made in Japan with 22 m antenna suggest that at 5o elevation
angle the loss is about 0.2–0.4 dB at 6/4 GHz, while measurements with a 7 m
antenna at 15.5 and 31.6 GHz gave losses of 0.3 and 0.6 dB, respectively, at a
5° elevation angle.
2. Scintillation and Multipath Inﬂuence—Small-scale irregularities in the
atmospheric refractive index cause rapid amplitude variations. In such a way,
different tropospheric effects in the absence of precipitation are unlikely to
produce serious fading in radio and space telecommunication systems operating
at a frequency about below 10 GHz and at elevation angles above 10°.
Besides, at low elevation angles and at a frequency spectrum above about
10 GHz, tropospheric scintillations can, on occasion, cause serious degradations
in performance. The atmosphere scintillation measure model includes fre-
quency, elevation angle, and antenna diameter, but also including meteorolog-
ical parameters, can be used to account for regional and seasonal dependencies.
5.5
Atmospheric Effects on Propagation
421

3. Propagation Delays—Additional propagation delays superimposed on the
delay due to free-space propagation are produced by refraction through the
troposphere precipitation and the ionosphere. Therefore, at a frequency above
10 GHz, the ionospheric time delay is generally less than that for the
troposphere.
4. Angle-of-Arrival Values—The gradient of the refractive index of the atmo-
sphere causes a bending of the radio ray and the angle of arrival varies from that
calculated based on the geometry of the path. Since the relative index varies
largely with altitude, the angle-of-arrival variation is much greater in the ele-
vation than in the azimuth angle. In addition, turbulent irregularities of the
refractive index can give rise to angle-of-arrival scintillations. Both of these
effects decrease markedly with elevation angle and are generally insigniﬁcant
for elevation angles above 10°. The effects are independent of frequency.
5.5.3
Transionospheric Propagation
Radio waves at frequencies of VHF and above are capable of penetrating the
ionosphere, and therefore, they provide transionospheric telecommunications. The
ionosphere consists in a layer somewhere between 80 and 150 km altitude, where
the density of the atmosphere is very low.
Radiation from the Sun ionizes some molecules and it takes a long time for them
to be neutralized by other ions. The concentration of ions varies with height, time of
day, the season, and in what part of its 11-year sunspot cycle the Sun happens to be.
5.5.3.1
Faraday Rotation and Group Delay
Ionospheric effects are signiﬁcant for frequencies up to about 10 GHz and are
particularly important for GEO and Non-GEO satellite constellations operating
below 3 GHz. At the frequencies used for satellite transmission, signals pass right
through and are subject to negligible refraction, less than 0.01° at 30° elevation.
The total electron content (TEC) accumulated through the transionospheric
transmission path results in the rotation of the linear polarization of the signal
carrier and a time delay in addition to the anticipated propagation path delay. Given
knowledge of the TEC, Faraday Rotation, and group delay can be estimated for
communication applications. Therefore, this delay is known as the group delay,
while the rotation of the linear polarization of the carrier is known as Faraday
Rotation. The TEC, denoted by NT, can be evaluated by the formula:
NT ¼
Z
s
Neðs)ds ½electrons=m2
ð5:35Þ
422
5
Propagation and Interference Consideration

where Ne = electron density [electrons/m2] and s = propagation path length
through the ionosphere [m]. Typically, NT varies from 1 to 200 TEC units (1 TEC
unit = 1016 el/m2). NT has typical values in the range of 1016 and 1018 el/m2. Even
when the precise propagation path is known, the elevation of NT is difﬁcult to
determine because Ne is highly variable in space and time. When propagating
through the ionosphere, a linearly polarized wave will suffer a gradual rotation of its
plane of polarization due to the presence of the geomagnetic ﬁeld and the aniso-
tropy of the plasma medium. Namely, this trend slows down the signal because the
Earth’s magnetic ﬁeld penetrates the ionosphere when ions (charged particles),
subject to the alternating electric ﬁeld of a signal, tend to gyrate around the local
line of force. The magnitude of Faraday Rotation will depend on the frequency of
the radio wave, the geomagnetic ﬁeld strength, and the electronic density (con-
centration) of the plasma as follows:
U ¼ NTðKM=f2Þ ¼ 2:36  102BENTf2 ½radians
ð5:36Þ
where value K = 2.36 × 104 [MKS for units]; M = value of (BE secф) at 420 km of
height; BE = longitudinal component of the Earth’s magnetic induction along the
ray path [Tesla]; ф = zenith angle of the ray and f = frequency [Hz]. Typical values
of Φ as a function offrequency for representative TEC values are shown in Fig. 5.16.
Hence, the occurrence of Faraday is well understood and can be predicted with a
high degree of accuracy and compensated for by adjusting the polarization tilt angle
at the LES. The GPS and similar satellite navigation systems, which use the
1–2 GHz frequency spectrum and depend on measuring the travel time of EM
signals, has to correct for this effect.
The presence of charged particles in the ionosphere slows down the propagation
of radio signals along the path and produces a phase advance. Thus, the time delay

in excess of the propagation time in free space is called the group delay and is given
by
Tg ¼ 1:34  107NT=f2 ½sec
ð5:37Þ
Accordingly, the time delay with reference to propagation in vacuum is an
important factor to be considered for digital communication and navigation posi-
tioning systems.
5.5.3.2
Ionospheric Scintillation
Ionospheric effects are important at frequencies below 1 GHz, although they may
even be important at frequencies above 1 GHz and are dependent on location,
season, solar activity (sunspots), and local time. At this point, ionospheric scintil-
lation occurs as short-term, rapid signal ﬂuctuations and is mainly caused by
irregularities in the ionosphere ranging from altitudes of 200–600 km. In fact, the
frequency dependence depends on the ionospheric conditions, but the attenuation
varies approximately at the same rate as the square of the wavelengths. The effect is
greater for lower frequencies and at lower latitudes, while high-latitude areas near
the Arctic polar region bounded between ± 20o are susceptible to intense scintil-
lation activity. In the L- and S-band, this effect can be ignored at medium latitudes
except during periods of solar activity. When the Sun is very active, L-band
enhancement and fading of 6 and −36 dB, respectively, were observed even at 37°
latitude. Scintillation activity is at a maximum during the night, lasting from 30 min
to a number of hours.
5.5.3.3
Other Ionospheric Effects
1. Dispersion—When transionospheric radio signals occupy a signiﬁcant band-
width the propagation delay, being a function of frequency, introduces disper-
sion. The differential delay across the bandwidth is proportional to the integrated
electron density along the ray path. Hence, for an integrated electron content of
5 × 1017 el/m2, a signal with a pulse length of 1 μs will sustain a differential
delay of 0.02 μs at 200 MHz, while at 600 MHz delay would be only
0.00074 μs.
2. Refraction—When radio waves propagate obliquely through the ionosphere
layer, they undergo refraction, which produces a change in the direction of
arrival of the ray.
3. Absorption—For equatorial and mid-latitude regions, radio waves of frequen-
cies above 70 MHz will assure penetration of the ionosphere without signiﬁcant
absorption, while for frequencies below 70 MHz the ionospheric absorption loss
is signiﬁcant.
424
5
Propagation and Interference Consideration

4. Doppler Frequency Shift—The special effects of frequency change due to the
temporal variability of the ionosphere layer upon the apparent frequency of the
carrier is the Doppler-shifted carrier. For example, at f = 1.6 GHz (GPS sys-
tem), the observed frequency change Δf at high latitude is Δf/f < 10−9.
5.6
Sky Noise Temperature Contributions
The mechanism that causes absorption of energy from a wave passing between
space and the Earth also causes the emission of thermal noise at RF. In fact, some
radio noise is added to the emission reaching the receiver, whereas the Earth itself
radiates noise, which can enter the transmission path via satellite or the LES
receiving antennas. Therefore, the radio noise emitted by all matter, while used as a
source of information in radio astronomy and remote sensing, may be a limiting
factor in communication services.
Otherwise, sources of radio noise of interest on Earth-to-space paths are the
atmosphere, clouds, rain, extraterrestrial sources, and noise from the surface of the
Earth. Prediction methods are given in the ITU-R P.372 Recommendation. The
thermal noise power N, available from a blackbody having a noise temperature of
the source T [K], measured in bandwidth B [Hz], is given by the form:
N ¼ kTB ½W
ð5:38Þ
where k = Boltzmann’s constant. The special power density N0 of noise from
source is
N0 ¼ N=B ¼ kT [WHz 1
ð5:39Þ
Thus, in considering the level of noise received at an LES or satellite from
sources external to the environment, it is convenient to identify a brightness tem-
perature TB for each separate source and a coefﬁcient (η), which represents the
efﬁciency, with which the receiving antenna captures noise from that source. Then t,
the noise temperature component due to the identiﬁed source, is given by:
t ¼ gTB ½K
ð5:40Þ
Therefore, the total noise entering the system from all of these sources,
expressed as a noise temperature, can be obtained by summing all the component
noise temperatures.
5.5
Atmospheric Effects on Propagation
425

5.6.1
Environmental Noise Temperature Sources
The LES antennas in GEO satellite infrastructures are typically designed and sited
so that the main lobe does not intersect the local terrain or obstructions, such as
mountains or large buildings. Side lobes are also minimized to reduce the effect of
the Earth’s temperatures on the system performance. However, in LMSC systems,
the antenna beam may pass through vegetation and be obstructed by buildings or
mountain terrain. Measurements suggest that the impact of the additional terrestrial
noise is greater when the antenna has a low internal noise temperature, that is, for
less directive antennas. Although these obstructions will raise the noise temperature
seen by the antenna, they will also cause shadowing or multipath effects, which are
likely to be more signiﬁcant in the total link performance.
Industrial man-made sources of noise affect VHF and UHF frequencies for all
but the quietest rural areas. Unlike other noise effects, there is a polarization
dependence in that the vertical component is higher that the horizontal. In general,
the median level of noise will decrease linearly with log(f). There are signiﬁcant
variations with location and time and little data are available to develop models to
predict levels.
Thus, considering the noise received at an LES from the ground, the sea, etc. and
buildings nearby, TB typically lies between 100 and 250 K, approaching the lower
limit at sea at low angles of elevation angles and the upper limit on land. The
relation for this noise temperature component tgr is same as for t. If the angle of
elevation of the main beam and the gain of the antenna are both high and the
antenna design is good, with well-suppressed side lobes and little subreﬂector
spillover, the corresponding value of η will be small and tgr may be no more than
20 K. If, however, the gain of the antenna is very low, as is typical of LES, η may
reach 0.5 and tgr may exceed 100 K. Satellite antennas directed toward the Earth,
having sufﬁcient gain for the main lobe to be ﬁlled by the Earth, will also receive
terrestrial noise with η ≈1, while TB will be about 210 K if land occupies a large
fraction of the beam footprint. However, except in the atmospheric absorption
bands, T will be somewhat less, perhaps as little as 160 K, if the sea occupies a
large part of the footprint.
5.6.2
Atmospheric Noise Temperature Elements
The noise temperature of a satellite-based antenna is dominated by the high tem-
perature emitted by the Earth, which ﬁlls, or mostly ﬁlls, the main beam of the
antenna. Additional noise from precipitation or other variables is insigniﬁcant in
this case. For a global beam, the noise temperatures are dependent both on fre-
quency and on the position of the satellite with relation to the major landmasses of
the Earth. The ground-based antenna observes the relatively cool sky and therefore,
the presence of clouds and rain can signiﬁcantly raise the noise temperature of the
426
5
Propagation and Interference Consideration

antenna. In general, the brightness temperature of the atmosphere due to the per-
manent gases and rain, if it is present and seen by an antenna, is given as follows:
TB ¼ Tmð1  10  A=10Þ ½K
ð5:41Þ
where Tm = effective temperature of the attenuating medium (atmosphere, clouds,
rain), typically about 270 K and A = total attenuation due to the medium. The
effect of rain on a satellite downlink is not just the attenuation, but it decreases in
C/N due to the higher noise temperature seen in rainy conditions, compared to
clear-sky conditions. In some cases, the noise temperature increase can have more
effect on the link than the attenuation itself.
5.6.3
Galactic and Other Interplanetary Noise Effects
Noise from interplanetary sources, particularly the Sun, the Moon, and from the
galactic background, is well understood and the effect on the total extraterrestrial
noise temperature of a system can be calculated with the following relation:
TB ¼ Tg  10  A=10 ½K
ð5:42Þ
where Tg = temperature of any interplanetary radio sources, including background
galactic noise (about 3 K above 3 GHz). Thus, the brightness temperature of the
Sun decreases with increasing frequency, from about 106 at 30 MHz to 104 at
10 GHz under quiet conditions. At 20 GHz, an antenna of 2 m diameter and a beam
width of about 0.5° would have an increase in noise temperature of about 8.100 K
with a quiet Sun. The Sun and Moon each subtend an angle of about 0.5°, so that if
the antenna beam is signiﬁcantly larger than that, the effect t of the Sun or Moon is
averaged with a larger portion of relatively cool sky.
5.7
Path Depolarization Causes
The atmosphere behaves as an anisotropic medium for radio propagation, which is
the property of being directionally dependent. Consequently power from one
polarization is coupled to its orthogonal component, causing interference between
the channels of a dual polarized system.
In this sense, depolarization or cross-polarization may occur when EM waves
propagate through media that are anisotropic, namely asymmetrical with respect to
the incident of polarization. Meanwhile, depolarization in the form of Faraday
Rotation of the plane of linear polarization occurs in the ionosphere because of
presence of the Earth’s magnetic ﬁelds. At this point, the resulting impairments are
typically circumvented by using circular polarization at frequencies below 10 GHz,
5.6
Sky Noise Temperature Contributions
427

for which the effect can be signiﬁcant. Depolarization is often the most signiﬁcant
path impairment for 6/4 GHz satellite systems and can be the limiting performance
factor for some 14/11 GHz satellite paths, especially at lower path elevation angles
in moderate rain climates.
On the other hand, depolarization in precipitation is caused by differential
attenuation and phase shifts that are induced between orthogonal components of an
incident wave by anisotropic hydrometeors. Orthogonally polarized radio waves
propagating in a medium that causes only differential phase shift are depolarized but
maintain orthogonality. If the medium induces differential attenuation, the waves
are also deorthogonalized.
5.7.1
Depolarization and Polarization Components
The importance of depolarization for satellite communications systems depends on
a few components: f = frequency signal, geometry of path (θ = elevation angle and
τ = tilt angle of the received polarization), local climatic factors (severity of the
rain), and sensitivity to cross-polar interference (whether the system employs fre-
quency reuse).
The EM waves comprise both the electric and magnetic ﬁeld vectors. Therefore,
these two components travel in the direction of the transmission path and are
orthogonal, while the orientation of the electric ﬁeld vector deﬁnes the polarization
of the transmitted waves. In general, as the wave progresses in time the tip of the
electric vector traces an ellipse in a plane perpendicular to the propagation direction.
A representative polarization ellipse of representative elliptically polarized radio
wave is displayed in Fig. 5.17. Two important parameters in this ﬁgure are the axial
ratio and τ = the inclination tilted angle with respect to the reference axis. The
polarization ellipse may be tilted at an angle (τ) with respect to the particular
coordinate frame. Thus, the general form of a polarized wave, when viewed per-
pendicular to the direction of travel, is elliptical in shape.
The polarization state of a wave is completely speciﬁed by its polarization
ellipse, i.e., the amplitudes of the major axis (Emax), the minor axis (Emin), and the
sense of rotation of the vector also deﬁnes the axial ratio by using the following
expression:
AR ¼ 20log (Emax=EminÞ ½dB
ð5:43Þ
In satellite communications, four types of polarization are employed, shown in
Fig. 5.17: (a) vertical linear polarization (VLP), (b) horizontal linear polarization
(HLP), (c) left-hand circular polarization (LHCP), and (d) right-hand circular
polarization (RHCP). The direction of the travel is symbolical “into the paper.”
Horizontal and vertical polarizations are deﬁned with respect to the horizon, LHCP

Propagation and Interference Consideration

has an anticlockwise and RHCP has a clockwise rotation when viewed from the
antenna in the direction of travel.
Therefore, if Emax and Emin are equal in magnitude, the polarization state can be
RHCP or LHCP, depending on the sense of rotation and in the case where Emax is
nonzero and Emin is zero, the value of electric vector maintains a constant orien-
tation deﬁned by Emax and the polarization state is said to be linear.
The polarization quantity of interest for frequency reuse communication systems is
the cross-polar isolation (XPI), deﬁned as the decibel ratio of the (desired) copolar
power received in a channel to the (undesired) cross-polar power received in that same
channel. In practice, however, XPI is difﬁcult to measure because the cross-polarized
components cannot be distinguished from noise in the copolar channel.
The quantity usually measured is the XPD, deﬁned as the ratio of the copolarized
power received in one channel to the cross-polarized power detected in the
orthogonal channel, both arising from the same transmitted signal. Moreover,
theory predicts that XPD and XPI components are equivalent for most practical
situations.
In fact, a polarized wave will comprise the wanted polarization together with
some energy transmitted on the orthogonal polarization. The degree of the coupling
of energy between polarizations is given by

Relation Between Depolarization and Attenuation
The ITU provides a step-by-step method for the calculation of hydrometer-
induced cross-polarization, which is valid for frequencies within the range
8 GHz < f < 35 GHz and for elevation angles less than 60°. Also, the attenuation
due to rain exceeded for the required percentage of time p and the polarization tilt
angle τ, with respect to the horizontal, also needs to be known. The XPD due to rain
is given by the following equation:
XPDrain ¼ Cf  CA þ Cs þ Ch þ Cr ½dB

where Cf = frequency-dependent term or 30 logf [GHz]; CA = rain-dependent term

Propagation Effects Important for GMSC Systems
The MES operates in a dynamic and often unsuitable environment in which
propagation conditions are constantly changing. Namely, satellite transmission path
proﬁle in GMSC varies continuously while the mobiles are in motion. The MES use
relatively broad beam antenna systems, which have only a limited discrimination
against signals reﬂected from scattered objects and surfaces. Because of the inherent
random nature of disturbances, radio signals are usually characterized statistically.
In general, a signal arriving at the antenna of a MES consists in the vector sum of a
direct component and diffused components arising from multipath reﬂection. The
resultant effects of these additional considerations are as follows:
(1) Signals suffer attenuation whenever the satellite path to mobiles is shadowed.
(2) Signals ﬂuctuate randomly because reﬂected and scattered random signal
components arriving at the mobile antenna are picked up, which is known as
the multipath.
(3) The power spectral density of multipath noise is a function of the mobile’s
speed and the environmental conditions.

Propagation and Interference Consideration

Depending on the environment in which a mobile operates, the satellite channels
in GMSC may be categorized as maritime, land, and aeronautically based. Each
category has its typical channel characteristics because of the different propagation
environments. Three different categories of MES: SES, VES, and AES, with their
own distinctive channels, need to be considered separately. Therefore, the local
operation variable environment has a signiﬁcant impact on the achievable quality of
transmission service in GMSC.
On the contrary, the LES or Gateway terminals serving in a mobile satellite
network can be optimally located in ﬁxed positions with constant channel charac-
teristics to guarantee good visibility to the satellite at all times, eliminating or
reducing the negative and undesirable effect of the local environment to a minimum.
5.8.1
Propagation in MMSC Systems
Maritime GMSC requirements have speciﬁc tasks and problems for shipping
designers and operators. In fact, the modern ship is constructed of steel, which
while ﬂoating on salt seawater becomes a very effective electromagnetic shield
capable of rejecting and reﬂecting part of radio waves. Meanwhile, modern
ocean-going vessels have reduced or removed many very heavy traditional deck
structures, which can affect transmission and reception. Hence, ships are sailing
sometimes on very rough seas, which cause the motion and vibration of satellite
antennas. In this case, the mobile satellite antenna goes quickly out of satellite focus
and causes interrupted or intermediate transmission.
Afterward, multipath fading caused by reﬂections from the sea surface can
signiﬁcantly impair MMSC channels, especially at the low elevation angles of an
antenna system onboard ships. Fading characteristics depend on the antenna gain of
the SES, elevation angle, sea surface conditions (smooth or rough), and so on.
A number of multipath fading reduction techniques, such as polarization shaping,
antenna pattern shaping, multielement antenna systems, and error-correction coding
have to be considered.
Furthermore, MMSC systems may operate on a worldwide basis, including paths
with low elevation angles. Due to the use of L-band frequencies for the Inmarsat
system, the effect of ionospheric scintillation is not negligible, particularly in
equatorial regions during years of high solar activity on an 11-year cycle. On the
other hand, tropospheric effects, such as rain attenuation and scintillation, will be
negligible for the said frequency bands. But signal-level attenuation due to blocking
by the ship’s superstructure is a considerable problem, for which there are some
adequate solutions and modiﬁcations.
In any event, the necessity of communications to ships via satellite is greater
every year. Due to safety regulations of the IMO and GMDSS, communication
channels to vessels need to be speciﬁed to a high degree of reliability. A typical
voyage onboard a ship comprises the following phases:
5.8
Propagation Effects Important for GMSC Systems
431

(1) The ship, after sailing, usually uses coastal navigation to a convenient position
on the open sea ready to take over the shortest course or orthodrome toward
the next port of call.
(2) Celestial and satellite navigation in a constant open sea environment.
(3) Going over to coastal navigation and maneuvering the ship at anchorage or in
port.
(4) The ship is moored in port under merchant operations.
Each of the above phases can be considered to have particular channel charac-
teristics. For instance, while the ship is in the port, an LMSC channel-type envi-
ronment could be envisaged, where it is subject to sporadic shadowing due to
buildings, cranes, other ships, and obstacles. However, during coastal navigation
ship’s satellite antennas could be under the inﬂuence of ground refraction and
diffuse reﬂected components. With regard to effects of multipath reﬂection from the
sea, this will be explained later in this chapter.
Clearly, the MMSC network offers a very different propagation scenario to that
in the LMSC case. Whereas with the LMSC channel, the modeling of the specular
ground reﬂection is largely ignored, in the instance of MMSC reﬂections from the
surface of the sea provide the major propagation impairment. At this point, such
impairments are especially severe when using antennas of wide beam width, while
operating at a low elevation angle to the satellite. Such a scenario is not untypical in
the MMSC environment.
5.8.2
Propagation in LMSC Systems
Land GMSC requirements have different problems to those for MMSC application
because of a more speciﬁc local environment. Namely, when the direct satellite
signal is obstructed by roadside trees, utility poles, buildings, tunnels, hilly terrain,
mountains, or other kinds of blockage, communication outages will occur. If the
disturbance lasts for a long period of time, the communication will be disconnected.
At all events, it is necessary to know the statistical characteristics of signal atten-
uation and its frequency as well as the duration of outages in given service areas,
such as urban, suburban, rural, vegetation, and mountain areas. However, in
comparison with the modeling of the MMSC propagation channel, results for the
LMSC channel are relatively few.
Radio waves reﬂected from mountains, hills, and artiﬁcial structures, such as
buildings and bridges, cause interference to the direct signal from a satellite and
cause amplitude and phase ﬂuctuations in the received signal. Namely, such mul-
tipath fading may degrade the BER performance for digital modulation. The
received LMSC signal is combined with three components: the direct line-of-sight
wave, the diffuse wave, and the specular ground reﬂection. The direct wave arrives
at the receiver without reﬂection from the surrounding environment.
432
5
Propagation and Interference Consideration

Besides, the only L- and S-band propagation impairments that signiﬁcantly
affect the direct component are free-space loss and shadowing. The diffuse com-
ponent comprises multipath reﬂected signals from the different nearby surrounding
environment, such as buildings, mountains, trees, and telegraph poles. Without
consideration of LMSC, networks rely on multipath propagation, where multipath
has only a minor effect on mobile satellite links in most practical operating envi-
ronments. The specular ground components are results of the reﬂected signal
reception from the ground near to the mobile. Antenna of low gain and wide beam
width operating through satellites with low elevation angle are particularly sus-
ceptible to this form of impairment. In fact, such a scenario could also include
GMPSC systems operating via LEO spacecraft. The ﬁrst step toward designing an
LMSC channel is to deﬁne and divide certain transmission environments into
typical categories as follows:
(1) Urban areas are characterized by almost complete obstruction of the direct
wave.
(2) Suburban, mountains, and tree shadowing environments are affected when
intermittent partial obstructions of the direct wave occur.
(3) Open and rural areas are not affected by obstruction of the direct wave.
The last two of the above environments are of particular interest for LMSS.
However, in urban environments, it is difﬁcult to guarantee visibility to the satellite,
resulting in the multipath component dominating reception. Currently, it is not very
economical and practical to use LMSC system in urban areas because it is possible
to employ landline infrastructure or dual cellular/GMPSC networks, such as
Globalstar and Iridium.
In open and rural areas, the multipath phenomenon is the most dominant link
impairment. The multipath components can either add constructively, with
enhancement of signal, or destructively, with fade caused to the direct wave
component. This results in the received MES transmissions being subject to sig-
niﬁcant ﬂuctuations in signal power.
In suburban areas, the major contribution to signal degradation is caused by
buildings, trees, and other man-made obstacles. These obstacles manifest as
shadowing of the direct signals, which results in attenuation of the received signal.
The MES motion through suburban areas results in continuous variation of the
received signal strength and variation in the received phase.
5.8.3
Propagation in AMSC Systems
Aeronautical GMSC requirements and propagation conditions are superior to those
in MMSC and LMSC because there are no difﬁculties and obstacles between a
satellite and AES. However, at low elevation angles and when a low-gain antenna is
used, multipath fading caused by reﬂection from the sea or ground surface occurs,
5.8
Propagation Effects Important for GMSC Systems
433

although it is less than in the maritime case. In an AMSC, an aircraft demodulator
must track the received signal and remove the Doppler effect due to the high speed
of ﬂight, using digital signal processing or pilot signal. The ability of communi-
cations to aircraft via satellite is becoming increasingly important. Due to the ICAO
safety regulations, communication channels to an aircraft need to be speciﬁed to a
high degree of reliability. A typical ﬂight has the following phases:
(1) The aircraft taxies to a position on the runway, ready to takeoff.
(2) Takeoff and ascension to cruise altitude at a constant height above the cloud
layer.
(3) Descent from cruise altitude to a landing on the runway.
(4) Taxiing from the runway to a standby place in the airport for a new ﬂight.
Each of the above phases can be considered to have particular channel charac-
teristics. For example, while the aircraft is in the airport, an LMSC channel-type
environment could be subject to sporadic shadowing due to adjacent buildings,
airport structures, other aircraft, and close obstacles. In effect, the AMSC channel is
further complicated by the maneuvers performed by an aircraft during the course of
a ﬂight, which could result in the aircraft’s structure blocking the line of sight to the
satellite. The body of the airplane is also a source of multipath reﬂection, which also
needs to be considered. In fact, as was discussed earlier, the speed of an aircraft
introduces large Doppler spreads as an additional effect.
The effect of multipath reﬂections from the sea for circular polarized L-band
transmissions will be explained later, together with the maritime case. Thus, ITU
provides a methodology similar to that for the maritime link, for determining the
multipath power resulting from specular reﬂection from the sea. Thus, the ITU
Recommendation includes a methodology to derive the mean multipath power as a
function of elevation angle and mobile antenna gain. In this sense, by applying this
method for an aircraft position 10 km above the sea and for a minimum elevation
angle of 10°, the relative multipath power will be in the range of approximately −10
to −17 dB, for antenna gains varying from 0 to 18 dBi, respectively.
Presently, AMSC systems are served by the L-band. Due to the bandwidth
restrictions at this spectra, services are limited to voice and low data rate applica-
tions. Inmarsat recently improved speed of transmission with a new generation of
satellite constellation. The need to provide broadband multimedia satellite services,
akin to those envisaged by new satellite UMTS/IMT-2000, will require the move up
in frequency to the next suitable bandwidth, the K- and Ka-bands. At these fre-
quencies, tropospheric effects will have an impact on link availability during the
time when the aircraft is below the cloud layer. The channel characteristics for a
K-band satellite system have been investigated in Europe and the USA. Thus, here
a Rice factor of 34 dB is reported for line-of-sight operation, while shadowing
introduced by the aircraft’s wing during a turning maneuver resulted in a fade of
15 dB.

Propagation and Interference Consideration

5.8.4
Surface Reﬂection and Local Environmental Effects
Surface reﬂections and local environmental effects are important for GMSC systems
because such factors generally tend to impair the performance of satellite com-
munications links, although signal enhancements are also occasionally observed.
Local environmental effects include shadowing and blockage from objects and
vegetation near the MES. At this point, surface reﬂections are generated either in
the immediate vicinity of the MES terminals or from distant reﬂectors, such as
mountains and large industrial infrastructures. However, the reﬂected transmission
signal can interfere with the direct signal from the satellite to produce unacceptable
levels of signal degradation. In addition to the fading, signal degradations can
include intersymbol interference, arising from delayed replicas.
The impact of the impairments depends on the speciﬁc application, namely in the
case of typical LMSC links, all measurements and theoretical analysis indicate that
the specular reﬂection component is usually negligible for path elevation angles
above 20°.
Moreover, for handheld terminals, specular reﬂections may be important as the
low antenna directivity increases the potential for signiﬁcant specular reﬂection
effects. For GMSC system links, design reﬂection multipath fading, in combination
with possible shadowing and blockage of the direct signal from the satellite, is
generally the dominant system impairment.
5.8.4.1
Reﬂection from the Earth’s Surface
Prediction of the propagation impairments caused by reﬂections from the Earth’s
surface and from different objects (buildings, hills, vegetation) on the surface is
difﬁcult because the possible impairment scenarios are quite numerous, complex,
and often cannot be easily quantiﬁed. For example, the degree of shadowing in
LMSC satellite links frequently cannot be precisely speciﬁed.
Therefore, impairment prediction models for some complicated situations,
especially for LMSC links, tend to be primarily empirical, while more analytical
models, such as those used to predict sea-reﬂection fading, have restricted regions
of applicability. Nevertheless, the basic features of surface reﬂections and the
resultant effects on propagating signals can be understood in terms of the general
theory of surface reﬂections, as summarized in the following classiﬁcation:
1. Specular Reﬂection from a Plane Earth—Here, the specular reﬂection coef-
ﬁcient for vertical polarization is less than or equal to the coefﬁcient for hori-
zontal polarization. Thus, the polarization of the reﬂected waves will be different
from the polarization of the incident wave if the incident polarization is not
purely horizontal or purely vertical. For example, a circularly polarized incident
wave becomes elliptically polarized after reﬂection.
2. Specular Reﬂection from a Smooth Spherical Earth—In this case, the inci-
dent grazing angle is equal to the angle of reﬂection. The amplitude of the
5.8
Propagation Effects Important for GMSC Systems
435

reﬂected signal is equal to the amplitude of the incident signal multiplied by the
modules of the reﬂection coefﬁcient.
3. Divergence Factor—When rays are specularly reﬂected from a spherical sur-
face, there is an effective reduction in the reﬂection coefﬁcient, which is actually
a geometrical effect arising from the divergence of the rays.
4. Reﬂection from Rough Surface—In many practical cases, the surface of the
Earth is not smooth. Namely, when the surface is rough, the reﬂected signal has
two components: one is a specular component, which is coherent with the
incident signal, while the other is a diffuse component, which ﬂuctuates in
amplitude and phase with a Rayleigh distribution.
5. Total Reﬂected Field—The total ﬁeld above a reﬂecting surface is a result of
the direct ﬁeld, the coherent specular component, and the random diffuse
component.
6. Reﬂection Multipath—Owing to the existence of surface reﬂection phenomena
signals may arrive at a receiver from multiple apparent sources. Thus, the
combination of the direct signal (line of sight) with specular and diffusely
reﬂected waves causes signal fading at the receiver. The resultant multipath
fading, in combination with varying levels of shadowing and blockage of the
line-of-sight components, can cause the received signal power to fade severely
and rapidly for MES and is really the dominant impairment in the GMSC
service.
5.8.4.2
Fading in MMSC and AMSC Systems Due to Sea Surface
Reﬂection
Multipath fading due to sea reﬂection of EM signals is caused by interference
between direct and reﬂected radio waves. The reﬂected radio waves are composed
of coherent and incoherent components, namely specular and diffuse reﬂections,
respectively, that ﬂuctuate with time due to the motion of sea waves. The coherent
component is predominant under calm sea conditions and at low elevation angles,
whereas the incoherent becomes signiﬁcant in rough sea conditions. If the intensity
of the coherent component and the variance of the incoherent component are both
known, the cumulative time distribution of the signal intensity can be determined
by statistical consideration.
In any event, a prediction model for multipath fading due to sea reﬂection,
however, was ﬁrst developed for MMSC systems at a frequency near 1.5 GHz.
Although the mechanism of sea reﬂection is common for MMSC and AMSC
systems, only with the difference that fading characteristics for AMSC are expected
to differ from those for MMSC, this is because the speed and altitude of aircraft so
much greater than those of ships. At this point, the effects of refractions and
scattering by the sea surface become quite severe in case of MMSC and AMSC,
particularly where antennas with wide beam widths are used.
436

Propagation and Interference Consideration

The most common parameter used to describe sea condition is the signiﬁcant
wave height (H), deﬁned as the average value of the peak-to-trough heights of the
highest one-third of all waves. Empirically, H is related to the r.m.s. height (ho) by
H ¼ 4h0
ð5:48Þ
Hence, at 1.5 GHz the smaller-scale waves can be neglected and the r.m.s. value
of the sea surface slopes appear to fall between 0.04 to 0.07 in the case of wave
heights less than 4 m.
Thus, with diminishing satellite elevation angle, the propagation path increases,
causing a decrease of signal power at the Rx side. The noise level is initially
constant; however, upon reaching some critical value of the elevation angle,
sea-reﬂection signals appear at the Rx input, which begins to affect the C/N value.
To include the effect of multipath interference caused by sea-refracted signals, the
reception quality would be more properly described by the C/N plus M, where M is
an interfering sea-reﬂected signal acting as a disturbance. Thus, sea-reﬂected signals
differ in structure and can be divided into two categories:
1. Radio signals with the rapid continuous ﬂuctuations of amplitudes and phases
and with a possible frequency shift due to the motion of small portions of the
specular cross section relative to the source of signals (noise or diffused
components).
2. Radio waves with relatively slowly changing phase close to the phase of the
basic signal and with amplitude correlating with that of the basic signal
(specular component).
Consequently, within the overall specular cross section, an angle of arrival
reﬂected radio signals relative to the horizontal plane may be regarded as constant
and can be described by the following expression:
a ¼ 90o  c
ð5:49Þ
where α = angle of radio signals arrival in accordance with Fig. 5.18 and
γ = reﬂection angle. In this ﬁgure is presented satellite antenna onboard oceangoing
ship, but can be also presented the similar antenna onboard aircraft instead. The
modulus of sea-reﬂection factor for L-band signals is within 0.8 and 0.9, which
means that the amplitude of the specular reﬂected signal is nearly the same as that
of the direct signal.
As measurements have shown, the noise component depends only upon an
elevation angle and a wave height. Decreasing the elevation angle and increasing
the wave height result in an increase in the total amplitude of the noise, which
includes the noise component. At elevation angles below 5°, the amplitude com-
ponent reaches a peak value and is no longer affected by the wave height. Now an
increase of the wave height causes primarily more frequent variations in the noise
component. The corresponding deviation of C.N measured in 1 kHz bandwidth
amounts from 4.5 to 5 dB.
5.8
Propagation Effects Important for GMSC Systems
437

The specular component that appears at the Rx input together with the direct
signal causes fading in the direct signal due to both the minor difference between
their phases and the slow change of the parameters of the reﬂected signals. The ratio
of the direct to specular reﬂected signal can be described as follows:
C=M ¼ ðC þ GeÞ  ½C  Gða þ eÞ
ð5:50Þ
where C = direct signal; M = specular reﬂected signal power from the sea;
Gε = maximum gain of the receive SES antenna pointing toward the satellite;
ε = elevation angle and α, as is shown in Fig. 5.18. In addition, keeping accuracy
sufﬁcient for practical purposes, the previous relation gives:
C=M ¼ bC=N þ ½Ge  Gða þ eÞ
ð5:51Þ
where βC/N = deviation of C/N ratio. With decreasing elevation angle, the C/M
diminishes monotonically, except for the elevation angle range of 5°–8°, within
which a rise in C/N is observed. This is obviously due to the fact that at the said
angles the difference in path between the direct and the specular signal becomes
negligible, so that conditions appear close to the summation of the similar signals at
the receiver input. An increase of the C/N plus M ratio is observed simultaneously
due to reaching a peak value of amplitude in the noise (diffused) component. In fact,
experimental measurements show that as the elevation angle decreases from 10° to
1°, the mean C/N plus M diminishes from 22–24 dB to 17–18 dB, with the
deviation increasing from 1.5–2 dB to 4.5–5 dB.

5.8.4.3
Multipath Fading Calculation Model for Reﬂection
from the Sea
The amplitude of the resultant signal at the SES terminal, being the sum of the
direct wave component, the coherent, and the incoherent reﬂection components, has
a Nakagami–Rice distribution (see ITU-R P.1057). The cumulative distribution of
fading depends on the coherent-to-incoherent signal intensities. For example, in the
case of rough sea conditions at 1.5 GHz, the coherent reﬂection from the sea is
virtually non-existent and the coherent signal is composed only of the direct
component. Therefore, the fading is determined by the carrier-to-multipath ratio
(C/M), i.e., the power ratio of the direct signal and multipath component caused by
incoherent reﬂection. The maximum fade depth (Φmax) occurs when the coherent
multipath signal is in antiphase with the direct signal, given by:
Umax ¼  20log (1  ArÞ½dB
ð5:52Þ
where Ar = amplitude of the coherently reﬂected component. The value decreases
rapidly with increasing wave height, elevation angle, and RF.
In practice, due to the vertical motion of the ship antenna relative to average sea
surface height, the maximum fade value will seldom occur. By adding Φmax and
Φi(p) as signal fade due to the incoherent component in the function of time
percentage (p), a practical estimate of the combined fading effects of the coherent
and incoherent multipath signal for sea conditions is obtained:
Uc ¼ Umax þ UiðpÞ
ð5:53Þ
The maximum fade value due to the coherent component will not occur con-
stantly because of the vertical motion of the ship antenna relative to average sea
surface height; therefore, the estimate using this equation seems to give the
worst-case value. In practice, for low elevation angles (less than 10°) at around
L-band frequencies, the maximum fading occurs when the signiﬁcant sea wave
height is between 1.5 and 3 m, where the coherent reﬂected component is negli-
gible. Accordingly, the dependence of fading depth on wave height in this range is
relatively small.
The amplitude level of the coherent component decreases rapidly with increasing
sea wave height, elevation angle, and frequency. Figure 5.19a illustrates the rela-
tionship between coherent reﬂection and signiﬁcant wave height. Namely, estimates
of amplitude of the coherent component for an omnidirectional antenna as a
function of a signiﬁcant wave height for low elevation angles are illustrated; the
frequency is 1.5 GHz and polarization is circular. Thus, the incoherent component
is random in both amplitude and phase, since it originates from a large number of
reﬂecting facets on the sea’s waves. The amplitude of this component follows
Rayleigh distribution and the phase has a uniform distribution.
Since the theoretical model concerning the incoherent components is not suitable
for engineering computations using a small calculator, simpler prediction models
5.8
Propagation Effects Important for GMSC Systems
439

are useful for the approximate calculation of fading. Such simple methods for
predicting multipath power or fading depth have been recently developed.
In Fig. 5.19b is presented relation between multipath power and elevation angle
for different antenna gains. Although fading depth depends slightly on sea surface
conditions, even if the incoherent is dominant, the simple model is useful for a
rough estimate of fading depth. Fading depth, which is a scale of intensity of fading,
is usually deﬁned by the difference in decibels between the direct wave signal level
and the signal level for 99 % of the time. It can be approximated by a 50 % to 99 %
value for fading where the incoherent component is fully developed. Large fading
depths usually appear in rough sea conditions, where the incoherent component is
dominant. In Fig. 5.20a is shown the fading depth estimated by the simple method
for antenna not exceeding for 99 % of the time and the corresponding C/M ratio for
circular polarization at 1.5 GHz band under the condition of signiﬁcant wave
heights from 1.5 to 3 m. The antenna gains of 24, 20, 15, and 8 dB are functions of
elevation angle with a fully developed incoherent component. The calculation is
based on the theoretical method, where the shaded area covers the practical range of
the sea wave slope, which depends on fading depth in rough sea conditions. Values
estimated by this simple method give the mean values of those given in Fig. 5.20b.
On the other hand, as the theoretical model is not suitable for engineering
computations using a small calculator, these simple prediction models are really
useful for the approximate calculation of fading or interference. Such simple
methods for predicting multipath power or fading depth have been developed by
Sandrin and Fang (1986) and by Karasawa and Shiokawa (1988) for MMSS and
Karasawa (1990) for AMSS.

Propagation and Interference Consideration

Furthermore, the frequency spectral bandwidth of temporal amplitude variations
enlarges with increasing wave height and elevation angle. Figure 5.20b shows the
probable range of –10 dB spectral bandwidth (which is deﬁned by the frequency
corresponding to the spectral power density of −10 dB relative to the ﬂat portion of
power spectrum) of L-band multipath fading obtained by the theoretical fading
model as a function of the elevation angle under the usual conditions of MMSC,
namely signiﬁcant wave height of 1 m–5 m, ship speed of 0–20 knots, and rolling
conditions of 0°–30°.
5.8.4.4
Other Estimations of Fading for MMSC and AMSC Systems
The error pattern in digital transmission systems affected by multipath fading is
usually of the burst type. Accordingly, a ﬁrm understanding of the fade duration
statistics of burst-type fading is required. Mean values of fade duration (ΦD) and
fade occurrence interval (Φo) for a given threshold level as a function of time
percentage can be estimated from the fading spectrum. A simple method for pre-
dicting the mean value from the −10 dB spectral bandwidth is available as a
theoretical fading model. Predicted values of (ΦD) and (Φo) for 99 % of the time at
an elevation angle from 5 to 10o are 0.05 to 0.4 s for (ΦD) and 5 to 40 s for (Φo).
The probability density function of (ΦD) and (Φo) at any percentages ranging from
50 to 99 % approximates an exponential distribution.

ysis and experimental results made by the mentioned researchers in Japan, the

lowest elevation angle Earth-to-space path at 1.5 GHz RF-band satisﬁes the
energy conservation law: [Power of coherent component] + [Average power of
incoherent component] * Constant. If this expression is satisﬁed, the maximum
incoherent power can be estimated easily by calculating the coherent power at
u = 0. Otherwise, for a more accurate estimation, small modiﬁcations of some
parameter dependencies are necessary. The modiﬁed procedure has been adopted
in P.680 for MMSC and P.682 ITU-R Recommendations for AMSC.
In Fig. 5.21a is shown a scattergram of measured and predicted altitude
dependence of fading depths (i.e., fade for 99 % of the time relative to that for
50 %) in the case of MMSC systems between measured data and predicted
values derived from the simple calculation method with the same conditions. In
this ﬁgure, Φdp2 are values from the method set out in ITU-R P.680, while Φdp1
are those from an alternative procedure of the prediction method for scattering
angles. On the other hand, it is evident that the measured values given by these
methods agree well with the same experimental values although the methods are
rather approximate.
In Fig. 5.21b is shown the altitude dependence of signal fade depth not
exceeded for 99 % of the time vs. antenna height onboard ships or aircraft. This
experiment was obtained from measurements with a helicopter together with the
calculated values from the simple estimation method of the solid line and the
theoretical model of the shaded region in the ﬁgure. From the ﬁgure, it can be
seen that the simple prediction method agrees well with both the theoretical
model and measured data even in the case of the AMSC system.
2. Fading Spectrum—In system design, particularly for digital transmission
systems, it is important not only to estimate the fading depth but also to know
the properties of temporal variation, such as the frequency power spectrum.
For MMSC systems, theoretical analyses were carried out in Japan and all

parameters affecting the spectrum such as wave height, wave direction, ship’s
direction and velocity, path elevation angle, and antenna height variations due to
ship’s motion (rolling and pitching) were taken into account. In general, spec-
trum bandwidth is broader with increasing wave height, elevation angle, ship
velocity, and the relative motion of the ship-borne antenna. The dependence of
the spectral shape on antenna polarization and gain is usually very small.
Moreover, since the speed of aircraft is signiﬁcantly higher than that of the
ships, the ﬂuctuation speed of multipath fading in AMSC is much faster than
that in MMSC, depending on the ﬂight elevation angle measured from the
horizontal plane. The calculated −10 dB spectral bandwidth is between 20 and
200 Hz for elevation angles of 5°–20°, for ﬂight elevation angles 0°–5° at a

Fading in LMSC System Due to Signal Blockage
and Shadowing
Recently, in the USA, Canada, Australia, Japan, and Europe, domestic LMSC and
GMPSC services have started. The main purpose of these systems is to extend MSC
voice services to rural/remote areas where terrestrial/cellular services are not pro-
vided. In a typical urban environment, line of sight for cellular systems sometimes is
not available due to blockage by buildings and other structures, when a MES can
receive many waves reﬂected from these structures and conduct communication link
using these signals. The LMSC system can be expected to use the direct line-of-sight
signal from a satellite because of the high elevation angles. When the LoS is blocked
by any obstacle, MSC is not available, but using path diversity the link is available
because of overlapping of two or more signal from adjacent satellites. At present,
path diversity from separate satellites is rarely used for GEO MSS, but Non-GEO
MSS have an inherent capability to exploit diversity, because the number of satellites
is large providing path diversity. Thus, Fig. 5.22 shows a typical propagation
environment for scattering, multipath fading, shadowing, diffusion, and so on.
Therefore, to design LMSC system, one needs information about the propaga-
tion statistics of multipath fading and shadowing. A vehicle runs at a distance of
5–20 m from roadside obstacles using an omnidirectional antenna, which has
azimuthally uniform gain but elevation directivity, or a medium or high-gain
antenna with automatic tracking capability. Thus, signal blockage and shadowing
effects occur when an obstacle, such as roadside trees, overpasses, bridges, tunnels,
utility poles, high buildings, hills or mountains, impedes visibility to the focus of
satellite. This results in the attenuation of the received signal to such an extent that
transmissions meeting a certain quality of service may not be possible. At any rate,
in the shadowing environments the presence of the trees will result in the random
attenuation of the strength of the direct path signal. Hence, the depth of the fade is
dependent on a number of parameters including tree type, height, as well as season
due to the leaf density on the trees.

Propagation Effects Important for GMSC Systems

Whether a VES is transmitting on the left- or right-hand side of the road could
also have a bearing on the depth of the fade, due to the line-of-sight path length
variation through the tree canopy being different for each side of the road. In such a
way, fades of up to 20 dB at the L-band may be presented due to shadowing caused
by roadside trees. This shadowing by roadside trees cannot occur on modern
highways because they are free of trees, only sometimes can shadowing appear by
tunnels, very big constructions, bridges, and mountains or hills in narrow passages.
1. Tree Shadowing—Attenuation due to trees nearby the roads arises from
absorption by leaves and blockage by trunks and branches. Absorption by leaves
is a function of the type and size of leaves and the water content therein.
Blockage due to trunks is primarily a function of their size. In addition to
attenuation of the direct signal, trees also cause an incoherent component due to
signals reﬂected and diffracted off the tree surfaces.
The overall attenuation from different types of fully foliated trees varies from
10.6 to 14.3 dB and the attenuation coefﬁcient is from 1.3 to 1.8 dB/m.
Measurements were conducted with MES Rx in a rural environment. Based on
these average values, a frequency scaling law for the attenuation coefﬁcient has
been derived (Goldhirsh and Vogel) by
a1 ¼ a0
pf1=f0 ½dB=m]
ð5:54Þ
where a1 and a0 = attenuation coefﬁcients at frequencies f1 and f0 [GHz], respec-
tively. Hence, the range of variation for a1 at 1.5 GHz is from 0.5 to 1.7 dB/m.

Propagation and Interference Consideration

Moreover, trees without foliage attenuate less and the reduction in attenuation
appears to be proportional to the total attenuation experienced when the tree is fully
foliated. The received strength of the direct signal behind a tree will depend on the
orientation of the signal path with respect to the tree. Therefore, the amount of
absorbing matter lying along the path will determine the degree of attenuation and
hence, on average, the length of the signal path through the tree shield can be
considered a major factor in determining the signal level.
The path length is a function of the elevation angle and the distance between the
receiver and the tree. At this point, the average attenuation behind an isolated tree
can be estimated as the product of the attenuation coefﬁcient and the path length
through the tree. Thus, the path length through the tree canopy will depend on its
shape and the orientation of the signal path within the canopy. Depending on the
type being considered, the tree canopy may be modeled as any one of the shapes.
Otherwise, for the intermediate elevation angle (20o–50o), attenuation is almost
independent of elevation and dependence becomes important only at the higher and
lower ends of the elevation angle range. By considering the path length variability
as a statistical parameter, however, a tree can be modeled as giving an average
attenuation and a distribution around it. Both the coherent and incoherent com-
ponents will vary with the receiver position and complete decorrelation of the signal
is expected over distances in the order of a few wavelengths.
2. Building Shadowing—Signal reception behind buildings takes place mainly
through diffraction and reﬂection. A direct line-of-sight component does not
usually exist and therefore shadowing cannot be deﬁned unambiguously, as in
the case of trees. However, shadowing may be loosely deﬁned as the power ratio
between the average signal levels to the unshadowed direct signal level.
Otherwise, diffractions from buildings can be studied using knife-edge diffrac-
tion theory, which gives reasonable estimates. A concept view of knife-edge
diffraction phenomena is shown in Fig. 5.23 for all losses caused by the pres-
ence of the obstacles as a function of a dimensionless parameter ν and in
Fig. 5.24 which illustrates the geometry of the path for both the illuminated
(a) and shadowed cases (b), in order to calculate the parameter ν, by using
elevation and wavelength as follows:
m ¼ ep2= kð1=d1 þ 1=d2)
½
 but d1  d2; so : m ¼ ep2=kð1=d2Þ ¼ ep2d2=k
ð5:55Þ
The signal strength at the shadow boundary is 6 dB below the line-of-sight
level. In the illuminated region, the signal ﬂuctuations are experienced due to
interference between the direct and the diffracted components. Hence, once
inside the shadowed region, the shadow increases rapidly. An experimental
investigation into building shadowing loss conducted by Yoshikawa and
Kagohara in 1989 conﬁrmed the applicability of the knife-edge diffraction
theory. Measured signal strength behind a building at various distances was
found to follow the prediction made, assuming a single diffraction edge.
5.8
Propagation Effects Important for GMSC Systems
445

However, where the building is narrow compared with its height, there may be
signiﬁcantly less shadowing than predicted by the above procedure.
When the direct signal path is blocked by a building, diffractions of the buildings
are not expected to play a dominant role in establishing the communication link,
unless MES is close to the shadow boundary. Reﬂections may play a useful role in
such situations, as happens in cellular systems. Building penetration depends on the
type of exterior material of the building and the location inside the building. Thus,
the loss through the outer structure, known as the penetration loss, is deﬁned as the
difference in median signal levels between that measured immediately outside the
building at 1.5 m above the ground and that immediately inside the buildings at
some reference level on the ﬂoor of interest. Measurements made at 940 MHz in a

Propagation and Interference Consideration

medium-size city in the USA indicate that on the ground ﬂoor of typical
steel-concrete-stone ofﬁce buildings, the average penetration is about 10 dB with a
standard deviation of about 7 dB. While another set of measurements in a large city
resulted in average ground ﬂoor penetration loss of 18 dB with a standard deviation
of 7.7 dB. However, the overall decrease of penetration loss with height was about
1.9 dB per ﬂoor. The biggest average attenuations are 12 and 7 dB and standard
deviations are 4 db and 1 dB for metal and concrete, respectively.
Attenuation through glass ranges from about 2 to 6 dB depending on the type of
glass, i.e., plain glass produces less attenuation compared to tinted or coated glass,
containing metallic components. Otherwise, the smallest average attenuation is
through ofﬁce furnishings, aluminum, and wood/brick of about 1, 2, and 3 dB,
respectively. Losses within a building are both of distance from the exterior wall
blocking the signal path, as well as the interior layout. Measurements have resulted
in an inverse distance power law coefﬁcient ranging from 2 to 4. The forthcoming
ICO system has conducted experiments with satellite-borne signals whose ﬁnal
target is to improve and even to eliminate building shadowing.
5.8.4.6
Fading in AMSC System Due to Land Reﬂection
An experiment aboard a helicopter over land was carried out by receiving
right-hand circularly polarized 1.5-GHz beacon signals from an IOR Marisat
satellite at an elevation angle of 10°. Fading depths measured over plains such as
paddy ﬁelds were fairly large (about 5 dB), nearly equal to that for sea reﬂection.
However, fade depths measured over mountainous and urban areas were less than
2 dB. In the case of mountains, reﬂected waves are more likely to be shadowed or
diffused by the mountains. As to urban areas, the shadowing and diffusing effects of
reﬂected wave by buildings are also large. For this reason, the ground-reﬂected
multipath fading in these cases is not generally signiﬁcant.
Measurements of Sea-Reﬂection Multipath Effect—A study of multipath
propagation at 1.5 GHz was performed with KC-135 aircraft and the NASA ATS-6
satellite. Otherwise, the signal characteristics were measured with a two-element
waveguide array in the aircraft noise radome, with 1 dB beam width of 20o in
azimuth and 50o in elevation. Namely, data were collected over the ocean and over
land at a normal aircraft altitude of 9.1 km and with a nominal speed of 740 km/h.
Coefﬁcients for horizontal and vertical antenna polarization were measured in an
ATS-6 experiment, where values for r.m.s. sea surface slopes of 3° and 12° were
plotted versus elevation angle, in Fig. 5.25, along with predictions derived from a
physical optics model. Sea slope was found to have a minor effect for elevation
angles above about 10°. The agreement between measured coefﬁcients and those
predicted for a smooth ﬂat Earth as modiﬁed by the spherical Earth divergence
factor increased as sea slope decreased. The relationship between r.m.s. sea surface
and wave height is complex but conversion can be performed. Namely, for most
aeronautical systems, circular polarization will be of greater interest than linear. For
the simpliﬁed case of reﬂection from a smooth Earth, which should be a good
5.8

assumption for elevation angles above 10°, circular copolar and cross-polar scatter
coefﬁcients (Sc and Sx), respectively, can be expressed in terms of the horizontal
and vertical coefﬁcients (Sh and Sv), respectively, by
Sc ¼ ðSh þ SvÞ=2 and Sx þ ðSh  SvÞ=2
ð5:56Þ
For either incident RHCP or LHCP is employed. Thus in general, the horizontal
and vertical coefﬁcients are complex values and phase information is required to
apply the last equations to the curve, in Fig. 5.25.
5.8.5
Interference from Adjacent Satellite Systems
In GMSC systems for ships, vehicles, and aircraft, small mobile antennas are
essential for operational and economic reasons. As a result, a number of low G/T
value MES terminals with smaller antennas have been developed. However, such
antenna systems are subject to the restriction of frequency utilization efﬁciency, or
coexistence between two or more satellite systems in the same frequency band
and/or an overlap area where both satellites are visible.
For coordination between two different systems in the same frequency band, a
highly reliable interference evaluation model covering both interfering and inter-
fered with conditions is required. Investigation into this area has been undertaken in
particular by ITU-R Study Group 8. Advancement of such a model is an urgent
matter for the ITU-R considering the number of MSC systems that are being
developed in the meantime.

Propagation and Interference Consideration

In GMSC systems, the desired signal from the satellite and the interfering signal
from an adjacent satellite independently experience amplitude ﬂuctuations due to
multipath fading, necessitating a different treatment from that for ﬁxed satellite sys-
tems. The main technical requirement is a formulation for the statistics of differential
fading, which is the difference between the amplitude of the two satellite signals.
At this point, the method given in No 5 of ITU-R P.680 Recommendation
therefore presents a practical prediction method for signal-to-interference ratio
where the effect of thermal noise and noise-like interference is taken into account,
assuming that the amplitudes of both the desired and interference signal affected by
the sea-reﬂected multipath fading follow Nakagami–Rice distributions. In fact, this
situation is quite probable in MMSC systems.
The basic assumptions of the intersatellite model are shown in Fig. 5.26, as an
example of interference between adjacent satellite systems, where (a) is downlink
interference on the MES side and (b) is uplink interference on the satellite side. This
applies to multiple systems sharing the same frequency band. It is anticipated that
the interference causes an especially severe problem when the interfering satellite is
at a low elevation angle viewed from the ship presented in this ﬁgure because the
maximum level of interference signal suffered from multipath fading increases with
decreasing elevation angle. Another situation is interference between beams in
multispot-beam operation, where the same frequency is repeatedly allocated.
5.8.6
Speciﬁc Local Environmental Inﬂuence
in GMSC Systems
Local environmental inﬂuence is important for SES and AES equipped with beam
width antenna. Many factors, with different kinds of noise sources, tend to make
disturbances in mobile channels. Another factor that affects communication links is
RF emission from different noise sources in the local environment. Thus, speciﬁc
local mobile environmental factors can be noise contributions from various sources
in the vicinity of the SES/AES and the inﬂuence of the ship’s superstructure in the
operation of maritime mobile terminals.

5.8
Propagation Effects Important for GMSC Systems
449

However, some of these local environmental factors can affect SES/AES when a
ship or aircraft is passing nearby the ground and, some of these are permanent noise
sources. More exactly, these environmental sources include broadband noise
sources, such as electrical equipment, motor vehicles, and out-of-band emission
from powerful transmitters such as radars and ships HF transmitters.
5.8.6.1
Noise Contribution of Local Ships’ and Aircraft’ Environment
Some of the noise contributions from the local ships’ environment are as follows:
1. Atmospheric Noise from Absorption—Absorbing atmospheric media, such as
water vapor, precipitation particles, and oxygen emit thermal noise that can be
described in terms of antenna noise temperature. These effects were discussed at
the beginning of this chapter.
2. Industrial Noise—Heavy electrical equipment tends to generate broadband
noise that can interfere with sensitive receivers. Therefore, a high percentage of
this noise originates as broadband impulsive noise from ignition circuits.
Namely, the noise varies in magnitude by as much as 20 dB, depending on
whether it is measured on a normal working day or on weekends and holidays
when it is lower in magnitude.
3. Out of Band Emission from Radar—Ship-borne and surveillance radars
operating in pulse mode can generate out of band emission that can interfere
with SES receivers. In general, such emissions can be suppressed by inserting
waveguide or coaxial ﬁlters at the radar transmitter output.
4. Interference from High Power Communication Transmitters—High-power
ships and terrestrial transmitters, for example, HF ship radio transceivers; HF
radio diffusion and TV broadcasting can interfere with SES.
5. Interference from Vehicles—Under certain operational conditions, RF emis-
sions from vehicles may impair Rx sensitivity. In one measurement, the noise
emanating from heavy trafﬁc has to be about −150 dB (mW/Hz) within the
frequency band 1.535–1.660 MHz.
6. Shipyard Noise—Extremely high-peak amplitudes of noise of −141 dB (mW/Hz)
wasrecordedfromBostonNavyYard,whichwasinfulloperationatthattime.Thus,
thisnoiseisalsoacombinationofcityambient noiseandbroadbandelectromagnetic
noise from industrial equipment.
In the similar way, all ﬁve stated noise contributions from the local ship envi-
ronment, except Shipyard Noise might affect instruments in the cockpit.
5.8.6.2
Blockages Caused by Ship and Aircraft Superstructures
Ship’s superstructures can produce both reﬂection multipath and blockage in the
direction of the satellite. For the most part, reﬂections from the ship’s superstructure
450
5
Propagation and Interference Consideration

located on the deck can be considered coherent with the direct signal. The fading
depth due to these reﬂections depends on a number of construction parameters
including shape of the ship, location of the ship’s antenna, antenna directivity and
sidelobe level, axial ratio and orientation of the polarization ellipse, azimuth and
elevation angles toward the satellite. Antenna gain has a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on the
fading depth.
In this case, low-gain antennas with broader beam widths will collect more of the
reﬂected radio signals, producing deeper fades. Blockage is caused by ship
superstructures, such as the mast and various types of antennas deployed on the
ship. The geometry of blockage by a mast is presented in Fig. 5.27, where signal
attenuation depends on several parameters including diameter of column, size of
antenna, and distance between antenna and column. Accordingly, estimated
attenuation due to blocking by a column-type structure is shown in Fig. 5.28 for
antenna gains of 20 dB (a) and 14 dB (b), respectively.
In the case of blockage can be caused by aircraft superstructures, such as
fuselage, wings, propellers, jet engines (engine nacelles), tails, and insigniﬁcant

various types of antennas deployed on the aircraft. Thus, signal attenuation depends
on several parameters including diameter of wings, size of antenna, and distance
between antenna and obstacles.
5.8.6.3
Motion of Ship’s and Aircraft’s Antenna
The motion of mobile satellite antennas is an important consideration in the design
of ships and aircraft infrastructures. The received signal level is affected by the
antenna off-beam gain because the antenna motion is inﬂuenced by the ship or
aircraft motions in the space. The random mobile motion must be compensated by a
suitable stabilizing mechanism to keep the antenna properly pointed toward the
satellite. This is normally achieved either through a passive gravity stabilized
platform or an active antenna tracking system. In either case, the residual antenna
pointing error can be signiﬁcant enough to warrant its inclusion in the overall link
calculation.
Earlier experimental evidence suggests that the roll motion of a mobile follows a
zero mean Gaussian distribution over the short term of the sea waves. The standard
deviation of the distribution (σs) is a function of the vessel or aircraft characteristics
and the sea or air state of the rolling and pitching. In Fig. 5.29 is presented dis-
tribution of the instantaneous roll angle of a ship under moderate to rough sea
conditions. The distribution of the ship or aircraft motion approximates to a
Gaussian standard deviation of distribution with σs = 5.42 value. Also shown in the
ﬁgure is the distribution of roll angle of a passively stabilized antenna under the

same conditions, which also follows a zero mean Gaussian distribution with a
quantum of σs = 0.99. Solid curves in Fig. 5.29 represent measured values and
dashed curves show calculated values for stabilized antenna motion over the sea
conditions with wave heights of approximately 5 m.
The relation between the standard deviations of the two distributions depends on
the design of the passive stabilizer. Although the ship’s antenna motion is much
reduced, depending on the antenna beam width, the residual pointing error may be
large enough to produce appreciable signal ﬂuctuations. Over a long period of sea
waves time σs varies as a function of the sea surface conditions and its distribution
can be approximately by either a log normal distribution or a Weibull distribution.
The same context can be used to explain the distribution of the instantaneous roll
angle of an aircraft under moderate to rough drift conditions in the air.
5.9
Propagation for Space Mobile Broadcasting
One of the main objectives when designing a mobile broadcasting communication
system over satellite or stratospheric platforms is to guarantee a speciﬁc QoS, which
depends on given user requirements. Thus, a key point for this design is the quality
of the channel that is present in the link. This channel varies in time and space, and
in order to perform an estimation of the losses that the signal will experiment, it is
necessary to consider all the factors inﬂuencing the signal attenuation.
A thorough understanding of the propagation mechanisms inﬂuencing radio
waves propagating in the channel is therefore essential. The discussed space
propagation mechanisms affecting the link produce various effects in the signal,
which vary depending on the operating frequency.
It is important to emphasize considerable differences in the models operating at
low radio frequency bands in relation to the ones operating in upper bands. Once
these propagation effects have been analyzed and understood, an analysis of their
nature and statistical behavior has to be performed, so that they can be represented
and characterized through statistical models. Thus, by using these models, it is then
possible to develop more realistic channel models, which are then applied when
designing space communication systems.
For the case of the stratospheric communication platforms (SCP) systems, which
have many similar effects and propagation conditions causing especially low
orbiting satellite systems, it is necessary to consider environmental conditions
deﬁned by the scenario, as well as the phenomena affecting the link. In such a way,
a model that clearly characterizes signal affectations will allow implementation of
reliable and truthful evaluation schemes. This analysis sets the basis for a deeper
channel characterization and the need to construct channel models, which are very
useful tools when designing an SCP models.
Mobile broadcasting has a lot in common with two-way interactive mobile
satellite systems for communication and navigation. The previous discussion
reviewed propagation aspects for mobile broadcasting can be included for the
5.8
Propagation Effects Important for GMSC Systems
453

general treatment on mobile broadcasting over satellite. In fact, there are two
principal differences between mobile broadcasting and two-way voice or data
services:
1. Mobile broadcasting must rely on one direction of information transfer, because
there is no any possibility of requesting retransmission. As a result, when the
signal ﬁnally fades out, the receiver has nothing to play except silence or what
might have been prestored.
2. The programming must be delivered on a continuous basis, regardless of the
location of the user. This is why both XM and Sirius include terrestrial relay
transmitters to ﬁll in dead spots in dense urban environments.
Accordingly, the new developments and discussion about a satellite digital
broadcasting transmission system is important that consistently are helping to
deliver video and audio bits to the mobile receivers. The satellite mobile receiver, in
turn, must be able to reassemble the entire signal stream in order to decompress and
convert from digital to analog system. Loss of bits causes dropouts at best and a
complete loss of signal at worse. Thus, there is no graceful degradation aspect that
can be accustomed to as FM listeners. The FM receiver only completely breaks lock
if there is interference from a stronger signal on the same or adjacent channel
frequency. In Satellite Digital Audio Radio Service, there is only one signal, but the
fades can be deep and either rapid due to multipath or prolonged due to blockage.
However, there are other reasons why FM is more resilient: Signal strength tends to
be quite high, and the radio frequency range centered on 100 MHz is more able to
bend and reﬂect in and around obstacles. Absorption by foliage is also much less
than at L- and S-bands. In fact, with L- or S-band transmission, the signal into a
ﬁxed receiver with clear line of sight to the satellite will generally remain solid. In
tropical regions around the geomagnetic equator, ionospheric scintillation can be a
problem. Fades from this phenomenon can be 6 dB or more in seasons near the
equinox. Fortunately, the satellite mobile broadcasting systems generally have
margins of 8 dB or more, which should provide a commercially acceptable
reception service. The Faraday effect is avoided through the use of circular polar-
ization (CP), which thereby demands an acceptable axial ratio. Therefore, any
chance of providing a continuous service under bed propagation conditions is small,
thus the need for diverse paths containing the same broadcast.

Ground Segment
In general, satellite ground segment is very important subsystem that is connecting
Fixed Earth Stations (FES) with other FES via geostationary Earth orbit (GEO) or
other types of satellites. In particular, mobile Earth stations (MES), ﬁxed or mobile
very small aperture terminals (VSAT), and TV (TVRO) broadcasting networks are
connecting
ground
segment
to
the
terrestrial
telecommunication
networks
(TTN) via communication satellites. The ground segment in GMSC can be repre-
sented by conventional land Earth station (LES) for all mobile applications, coast
Earth station (CES) for maritime and land applications, and ground Earth stations
(GES) for aeronautical applications.
Thus, in the twenty-ﬁrst century, satellite communication systems have become
an essential and very important technology for modern commercial and government
applications. Satellites are launched from Earth by the launchers in GEO, from
high-ﬂying airplanes or from ground based rockets. Once lunched, the payloads
must reach proper elevation and escape velocity to be boosted into certain orbit.
However, in order to maintain proper orbital path and communication operations,
satellites are controlled by ground station on Earth that sends commands and
receives status and telemetry from the satellite.
However, low Earth orbits (LEO) as a part of non-GEO satellites are visible for
only a period of time from the point of view of an observer on Earth. They can
dump data to the ground Earth when they pass by a ground station area. Therefore,
the ground station plays a very important role in the communication with the
satellites in the orbit. A mission control center (MCC) might use several ground
stations to maintain the communication with many satellites. Although a ground
station will have a lot of radio hardware to receive and send the microwave signal to
and from satellites, the objective of this work was to focus on the software part of
the ground station.
Global satellite coverage has proven to be extremely desirable in recent years in
all sectors in both communication and exploration applications. Increased satellite
coverage requires increased capacity of the ground segment, which is controlling
the main operations in the life circle of satellites. The ground segment provides the

means and resources to manage and control the missions, to receive and process the
data produced by the station instruments. The operational ground segment is in
charge of the satellite housekeeping, the mission planning and telemetry reception
from the satellites.
6.1
Deﬁnition of GMSC Services
This
section
shortly
introduces
the
ofﬁcial
deﬁnition
of
International
Telecommunication Union (ITU) related to the various satellite services currently in
operation.
6.1.1
Fixed Satellite Services (FSS)
According to the Radio Regulations (RR S1.21), the FSS is a radiocommunication
service between given positions on the Earth’s surface when one or more satellites
are used.
These stations located at given positions on the Earth’s surface are called Earth
Stations or Radio Earth Stations (RES) of the FSS. The given position may be a
speciﬁed ﬁxed point or any ﬁxed point within speciﬁed areas, such as rural and
urban areas within one country or between two countries or continents. Stations
located onboard the satellites mainly consist of the satellite transponders and
associated antennas, which are providing satellite links between RES and FSS
users. Figure 6.1 shows solution of Global or Regional FSS network with RES as
are called gateways or space stations and interface to the TTN facilities of the FSS
coverage, such as Internet, Integrated Services for Digital Network (ISDN), and
Public Switched Telephone Network (PSTN).
At the recent time, with very few exceptions, all links between a transmitting
Earth station and a receiving Earth station are affected through a single satellite. In
fact, these links are comprised of two parts, an uplink between the transmitting
station and the satellite and a downlink between the satellite and the receiving
station. Thus, at the present time and in the future, it is envisaged that links between
two Earth stations could use two or more satellites directly interconnected without
an intermediate Earth station. Such a link between two Earth stations using
satellite-to-satellite links would be called a multisatellite link (MSL). The
satellite-to-satellite links will form a part of the intersatellite links (ISL).
The ISL network may be employed to provide connections between Earth sta-
tions in the service area of one satellite to Earth stations in the service area of
another satellite, when neither of the satellites covers both sets of Earth stations.
A set of space stations and Earth stations working together to provide radiocom-
munications is called a satellite system. For the sake of convenience, a distinction is
made in the particular case of a satellite system, or a part of a satellite system,
456

Ground Segment

consisting of only one satellite and the associated Earth station that is called a
satellite network.
The FSS also includes feeder links, i.e., transmission links from an Earth station
located at a speciﬁc ﬁxed point to a space station onboard satellite, or a feeder link
is the portion of a broadcasting satellite system that provides the connection from
the Earth to the satellite. In vice versa direction, satellite is conveying information
for a space communication service other than for the FSS. This category includes,
in particular, uplinks to the satellites of the Broadcasting Satellite Service (BSS) and
up- and downlinks between ﬁxed earth stations and satellites of the Mobile Satellite
service (MSS).
Deﬁnitions of BSS and MSS are given in the same way, namely all types of any
radio or telecommunications signals can be transmitted via FSS links: telephony
(voice), facsimile (Fax), data, video or a mix of these signals in the framework of
ISDN and PSTN, television and sound programmes, etc. In addition, the newest
ﬁxed and mobile satellite system is Digital Video Broadcasting-Return Channel via
Satellite (DVB-RCS), which is providing service deploying VSAT in ofﬁces or
onboard mobiles.
The latest communications satellite generations, operating in FSS frequency
bands, are equipped with high-power transponders, which makes it possible to
implement different broadcasting services direct to the general public for individual
reception, such as Digital Audio Broadcasting (DAB) via satellite, direct-to-home
(DTH) applications through very small receiving antennas known as television
receiving only (TVRO), and for rural and community reception (professional and
domestic applications).

6.1.2
Mobile Satellite Services (MSS)
The MSS applications use different frequency band allocations than the FSS. This
service has similar techniques employed and many commonalities exist between
these services and those of the FSS solutions. According to the Radio Regulations
(RR No S1.25), this is a radiocommunication service between MES and one or
more space stations, or between MES terminals by means of one or more space
stations. In Fig. 6.2 is shown solution of Global or Regional MSS network with
LES terminals as are called gateways or space stations and interface to the TTN
facilities of the MSS coverage.
The MSS communication system may deploys GEO, medium Earth orbit
(MEO), and LEO satellite constellations to establish connections of all MSS ter-
minals, such as Ship Earth Stations (SES), Vehicle Earth Stations (VES), Aircraft
Earth Stations (AES) and Personal Earth Stations (PES), with the ground Internet,
ISDN, and PSTN facilities.
Therefore, MSS system includes maritime, land (road and rail), personal, and
aeronautical applications providing global communication service, managed by the
adequate trafﬁc control centers (TCC). The MSS network may also serve to the
disaster and search and rescue (SAR) facilities, rural communications, mobile
multimedia, WAN, and so on. It is important to note that the modern mobile

systems are implementing VSAT onboard ships, land vehicles, and aircraft, and that
may even serve to the personal handheld phones and PC terminals as well.
The ISL network in MSS may provide connections from MES in the service area
of one satellite to LES terminals in the service area of another satellite and vice
versa, when neither of the satellites covers both sets of these stations. The MSS also
includes feeder links, i.e., transmission service from LES terminals to the satellite,
and service links, i.e., are providing transmission service from MES terminals to
LEO/MEO or GEO satellites.
6.1.3
Fixed and Mobile Broadcasting Satellite
Services (BSS)
This is a radiocommunication service in which signals transmitted or retransmitted
by RES or space stations are intended for direct reception by the general public
using VSAT for the TVRO reception onboard ships, land vehicles and aircraft,
which scenario is illustrated in Fig. 6.3. The satellites implemented for the BSS are
often called Direct Broadcast Satellites (DBS) for video and audio signals.
The TVRO systems needed for BSS reception should be smaller than the ones
needed for stated operation in the FSS system. The new TV system that can serve
ﬁxed and mobile TV broadcasting is high-deﬁnition TV (HDTV). Direct Audio
Broadcasting (DAB) also needs very small satellite radio receivers.

Deﬁnition of GMSC Services

The direct reception shall encompass both individual reception known as direct
to home (DTH) and community reception such as Community Antenna Television
(CATV) and Satellite Master Antenna Television (SMATV). In addition,
DVB-RCS has solution of Internet Protocol TV (IPTV) for both ﬁxed and mobile
applications. Some other speciﬁc satellite services may provide radiodetermination
satellite service, radionavigation satellite not augmented and augmented service,
meteorological-satellite service, and so on.
6.2
Divisions of Earth Stations in MSS
An Earth station in MSS sends and receives communication transmissions using a
space objects. Earth stations can be in service of Inmarsat GMSC via GEO satellites
and usually are called LES. While non-GEO GMSC Earth stations provide GMSC
service via Iridium, Globalstar, or Orbcomm satellite constellations, they are
referred to as Gateways.
They can transmit signals to space or when used for services such as pay TV,
just receive. Standard Earth stations used for FSS and MSS generally transmit and
receive. An Earth receive station is an Earth station that is only a receiver, so the
majority of Earth stations for a BSS will only receive.
In addition to feeder link Gateway, satellite operations require Telecommand,
Telemetry and Control (TT&C) centers in order to track and control the satellite
constellation. There are at least two such sites in a given satellite mobile system
serving as primary and backup facilities. They are used to provide command
functions to satellites such as to perform orbit maneuvers, as well as monitor the
status of the satellite and subsystems.
6.2.1
Land Earth Stations (LES) Design for GEO Mobile
Networks
Feeder links of LES terminals are using RF C-band to connect GMSC transceivers
onboard ships, land vehicles, and aircraft, including transportable, portable, and
personal handheld units with TTN via Inmarsat or other GEO satellite operators,
while service links of MES are using RF L-band. The LES terminal interface TTN
infrastructure, such as Internet, ISDN, and PDTN, which simpliﬁed block diagram
of a typical gateway or feeder link Earth station (LES), with its receive and transmit
chains is shown in Fig. 6.4.
Feeder link Earth stations that operate to GEO satellites have a simpler LES
antenna tracking structure than those that operate to non-GEO satellite networks,
because the relative movement of GEO satellites is much smaller. Consequently,
large Earth station antennas of about 10–15 m diameter can be economically used
460
6
Ground Segment

thereby improving link margins. Furthermore, only one feeder link Earth station
antenna (and one spare for backup purposes) is required to handle all mobile calls
from the coverage area of GEO satellite constellations.
Having said this, other feeder link Earth stations are normally added within the
system to provide for resilience and to allow for national presence of operations
within different regions. The GMSC service is managed by satellite operators, while
these LES terminals are typically operated by service providers who interconnect
trafﬁc to the local terrestrial networks and who also market the mobile services
within the region.
6.2.2
Gateways Design for non-GEO Mobile Networks
Feeder link of Gateway terminals or Earth station antennas for non-GEO satellite
systems are generally smaller than those used for GEO operation, because of the
lower path losses to the satellites and to allow for easier tracking ability. Feeder link
frequencies normally used by Big LEO systems are in the 5/7 GHz bands or
20/30 GHz bands. Frequencies in the 15 GHz band are also available.
The design and location of feeder link Earth stations are related to the satellite
constellation characteristics. For example, LEO satellite system such as Iridium
having ISL network to route trafﬁc between satellites would need fewer Earth
stations than otherwise required. On the other hand, systems using Earth orbits
without ISL, such as Globalstar and Orbcomm, will need more Earth stations than
those using Iridium and MEO satellite constellations.
However, in the Iridium satellite system there are 1 or 2 Gateways station sites
connected together via a global TTN and ﬁber optic network. Trafﬁc is internally
routed to the closest Gateway to the call destination before being routed through the
public terrestrial networks. In the Globalstar system, there are between 30–40

6.2
Divisions of Earth Stations in MSS
461

Gateways sites planned globally with trafﬁc routed directly through the public
terrestrial networks at the gateways. Furthermore, the location of feeder link sites
must take into consideration the existing national or regional telecommunications
infrastructure available.
The number of tracking Gateway antenna installed at individual sites will vary
depending on the number of satellites being tracked, the number of antennas lining
up for the next satellites to become visible and the number being used as spare.
Typically, the number of antennas installed at an individual non-GEO feeder link
site can vary from about 2 to 6.
6.2.3
Components of Ground Segment
The ground segment, shown in Fig. 6.4, comprises the uplink and the downlink
radio Earth station (RES) components, which include:
1. Multiple beam reﬂector ground antennas with antenna feed, diplexer and drive
motors, as an outdoor equipment (ODE), for simultaneous connections with
other satellites inside of their overlapping coverages, which consist of precision
systems for satellite tracking. This precision system is managed by antenna
controller and TT&C system for monitoring the performance of the satellites
and receiving telemetry data from the satellites;

6.3
Ground Antenna, Components, and Control Systems
An antenna (plural antennae or antennas), or aerial, is an electrical device which
converts electrical power of EM waves into radio waves and vice versa. It serves in
ﬁxed and mobile RES with a radio Rx and Tx or both in one as radio transceiver.
An Tx supplies the electric current oscillating at RF or HF alternating current
(AC) to the antenna, and the antenna radiates the energy from the current as EM

waves. An Rx via antenna intercepts some of the power of an EM wave in order to
produce and amplify a tiny voltage at its terminals.
6.3.1
Center Feed Antennas
Simplest form of axisymmetrical conﬁguration is a paraboloidal reﬂector with a
primary feedhorn located at the focus, which is shown in Fig. 6.5 (Left). However,
this leads to a long waveguide run between the feed and the electronics box for
antennas whose diameter is greater than about 3 meters. This is undesirable because
it leads to reduction in signal power and increase in noise. A more compact con-
ﬁguration, especially for larger antenna diameters, can be realized by the intro-
duction of a subreﬂector. The feedhorn is located at the rear of the main reﬂector,
eliminating the need for long, potentially lossy, waveguide runs. This is known as
Cassegrain antenna and is shown in Fig. 6.5 (Right). Thus, the subreﬂector is a
section of hyperboloid situated within the focus of the main reﬂector.
However, the subreﬂector and associated support legs cast an effective shadow
that affects the antenna efﬁciency and its sidelobe envelope. Typically, for a
Cassegrain conﬁguration, a decrease in peak gain of 0.1–0.5 dB can be expected.
Also, the subreﬂector may not intercept all that is radiated from the primary feed
and this could lead to degradation of the antenna sidelobe performance. To increase
the percentage of energy intercepted by the subreﬂector, the antenna feed is con-
ﬁgured to give a tapered illumination distribution at the subreﬂector. Moreover,
decreasing or tapering the subreﬂector edge illumination reduces the overall
antenna efﬁciency. This would require some compromise between the sidelobe
performance and the antenna efﬁciency. It is feasible to achieve a reasonable
wide-angle sidelobe performance and high antenna efﬁciency. An improvement in

antenna efﬁciency can be achieved by shaping the reﬂector proﬁles and controlling
the aperture amplitude distribution while still maintaining a uniform phase distri-
bution. The near-uniform aperture distribution achieved will lead to higher side-
lobes close to the boresight direction.
Here will be discussed the following types center or axisymmetric feed antennas:
1. Center Focal Feed Paraboloid Antenna—This is single reﬂector-type ground
antenna with a simple conﬁguration, low aperture efﬁciency and so reﬂector
shaping cannot be applied, which is illustrated in Fig. 6.6a. It is generating high
noise temperature due to large spillover power from main reﬂector and bad
accessibility for large diameter antenna, because feed and LNA should be
adjoined to primary radiator (horn). This type of antenna is ﬁtted for installations
at small size Earth stations.
2. Center Feed Cassegrain Antenna—This is subreﬂector convex (Cassegrain)
antenna that provides high efﬁciency and low noise temperature because
reﬂector shaping can be applied, which is shown in Fig. 6.6b. Its feed and LNA
can be installed in the equipment room behind the main reﬂector, so for that
reason rather good accessibility can be obtained. Frequency range of this
antenna is narrower than that of 4-reﬂector beam waveguide feed type and is
producing fairly good radiation pattern. This antenna is ﬁtted for installations at
medium size Earth stations.
3. Center Feed Gregorian Antenna—This is subreﬂector concave (Gregory)
antenna with high efﬁciency and low noise temperature because reﬂector
shaping can be applied, which is shown in Fig. 6.6c. Feed and LNA can be
installed in the equipment room behind the main reﬂector, so at this point rather
good accessibility can be obtained. Frequency band range is narrower than that
of 4-reﬂector beam waveguide feed type. This antenna has good radiation
pattern and is suitable for medium Earth stations.
4. Cassegrain Center 4-reﬂector Fed Beam Waveguide Antenna—This is
advanced Cassegrain antenna fed by 4-reﬂector beam waveguide, which is
shown in Fig. 6.6d. It provides high efﬁciency and low noise temperature over
Fig. 6.6 Different types of ground center feed antennas—Courtesy of Handbook: by Intelsat
464

Ground Segment

super-broadband and good accessibility, because feed and LNA can be installed
in the room free from El- and Az-rotations. No waveguide run and rotary joint is
required, so transmit power can be about 2 dB higher at 6 GHz band for
30-m-diameter antenna. This antenna shows good radiation pattern and can
accommodate large size Earth station antennas (D/λ about 500).
6.3.2
Offset Feed Antennas
The offset feed ground antennas, such as the offset Cassegrain and Gregorian,
achieve a better radiation pattern because of lower aperture blockage. They are
often known as non-symmetrical ground antennas and are generally used in small
Earth stations because of construction problems and higher cost.
Here will be introduced two types of offset feed antennas such as:
1. Offset Feet Paraboloid Antenna—This ground antenna has excellent radiation
pattern and shows low noise temperature because of no blocking features, which
is shown in Fig. 6.7 (Left). It has excellent voltage standing wave ratio (VSWR)
and is small size Earth station antenna (e.g., TVRO).
2. Offset Feet Cassegrain Antenna—This Earth station antenna is experiencing
excellent radiation pattern because of no blocking issues, which is illustrated in
Fig. 6.7 (Right). It also has high efﬁciency and low noise temperature because of
no blocking possibilities and reﬂector shaping. This antenna provides excellent
VSWR, small wind load if limited steerable amount is selected environments,
and good accessibility because feed and LNA can be installed in the room free
from El- and Az-rotations. It is ﬁtted for installations in small and medium size
Earth stations.

Models of GEO Ground RES Antenna Systems
An antenna with a feed in the center of the paraboloid (axisymmetric) reﬂector
represents the simplest antenna conﬁguration that is potentially capable of meeting
the important RF speciﬁcations for RES applications. Thus, a major advantage of
such a conﬁguration is that mechanically, it is relatively simple, reasonably compact
and in general, fairly inexpensive. The circular symmetry of the main antenna
reﬂector leads to considerable cost savings in the manufacturing of the reﬂecting
surface, backup structure and antenna mount. There are many types of ground
antenna that can be deployed in RES infrastructures.
6.3.3.1
ViaSat 13.5 M Communication Earth Station Antenna
The ViaSat 13.5 m 8013 model antenna provides high-performance in RF of C-,
Ku-, or DBS-band GEO satellite applications, shown in Fig. 6.8 (Left). The shaped
Cassegrain reﬂector provides superior gain and sidelobe performance, meeting
stringent of satellite operators’ requirements. Precision stretch-formed and inter-
changeable aluminum panels are attached to a central structural-steel HUB with
rigid, interchangeable structural trusses. The antenna panels are coated with a
solar-diffusive white coating system that provides years of environmental protection
while minimizing thermal expansion effects. The reﬂector back structure and
subreﬂector spars are designed to exacting rigidity requirements under wind and
gravity loads. The HUB provides a protective enclosure for sensitive electronics.
The ViaSat so-called Turning Head mount provides an efﬁcient structure for
supporting and positioning the feed and reﬂector system over a full 360° in 70°

The ViaSat model 8118 is a 16.0 or 18.3 m GEO satellite antenna that provides
superior performance through the use of precision stretch-formed reﬂector panels
and a dual-shaped Cassegrain feed, which is shown in Fig. 6.8 (Right). Corrugated
conical feed horns ensure excellent antenna gain and sidelobe performance.
High-strength aluminum panels are durable enough to withstand rough handling
and a range of environmental conditions.
The HUB also provides a protective enclosure for sensitive electronics. The
high-strength structural-steel mount employs an elevation-over-azimuth geometry
for easy pointing to any satellite within the visible orbital arc. The mount’s stiff,
rugged construction provides pointing accuracy for continuous operation, even
under adverse wind conditions.
Main features of this RES antenna are as follows: Transmit operational RF is
5.850–6.425 GHz; receive operational RF 3.625–4.2 GHz; gain (Midband, Ref.
Feed Horn) for 18.3 m transmit antenna is 60.3 dBi2 and for receive antenna is
56.6 dBi; and for 16.0 m transmit antenna is 58.9 dBi dBi2 and for receive antenna
is 55.4 dBi.
6.3.3.3

This RES is designed for the latest high-capacity GEO Ka-band satellites, and the
9.1 m antenna system offers exceptional broadband support to deliver high-speed
Wi-Fi ﬁxed and mobile connections for residential, commercial, and government
satellite services, which is shown in Fig. 6.9 (Left). It is ideally suited for
high-performance gateway applications.
The shaped Cassegrain antenna with precision-machined subreﬂector provides
superior gain and sidelobe performance at Ka-band operational RF. Its improved
high-precision, stretch-formed panels are supported by stiff radial trusses attached
to a large central HUB. The reﬂector back structure and spars are designed for

rigidity requirements to provide optimum performance under a wide range of
environmental conditions.
All aluminum reﬂector panels, coated with a solar-diffusive white paint, mini-
mize thermal effects. The oversized HUB is speciﬁcally designed to support mul-
tiple redundant suites of HPA, BUC and receive chain conﬁgurations. The
extra-large doorway allows easy access from the large work platform for convenient
maintenance of all the electronics. Besides, the redundant heating, ventilation, and
air-conditioning (HVAC) system maximizes the electronics mean time before
failures (MTBF) and service availability.

conditions. The pedestal design features a precision azimuth bearing with dual
drivers for very low backlash. Its control system offers full DC servo performance

Models of non-GEO Ground RES Antenna Systems
The LEO and MEO ground RES satellite antennas provide the accurate tracking
function of sending and receiving voice and data by aiming it at Big LEO (Iridium
and Globalstar) and MEO (O3B) mobile system for automatical communications
with satellites. The ground antenna for Small GEO Orbcomm satellite system can
provide transfer of data only. The major requirements are to track, control, and
communicate accurately with the rapidly moving communication satellite around
the Earth requires deployment of very high-quality ground RES antennas.
The Korean-based High-gain Antenna Company produces several types of LEO
and MEO RES antenna terminals for mobiles reliable and quality service. The
major functions of LEO and MEO satellite tracking antennas are to perform the task
of controlling a satellite and communicating including TT&C facilities and so on.
This type of RES antenna has different program, from 3.7 to 13 m in size, at
intervals of one meter. In addition, each of these antennas covers RF at L-, S-, and
X-band. Its wheel range is the elevation 0° * 90° or −90° * 90° and the azi-
muth ±180°, the operation speed is from 0.02°/s to 16°/s, and its mount of Yoke &

6.3.5
Ground RES Antenna Mount Systems
There are variety sizes of ground RES antennas, from 1.2-m ultra-small antennas to
32-m ultra-large antennas, at intervals of one meter. There are various types
of antenna mounts such as XY, AZ/EL, and Polar, including King Post, Yoke &
Tower, and Wheel on Track type. The ground antennas provide services for GEO
and non-GEO constellations, such as Small LEO, Big LEO, MEO, and HEO
satellite services. The RES antennas perform satellite communications, navigation,
observation, remote sensing, and monitoring according to their RF bands, such as
L-, S-, C-, X-, Ku-, and Ka-band or antennas for multibands as well.
When selecting the location for an Earth station ground antenna of any size, the
primary consideration is to ensure a clear view of the orbital arc, which allows the
antenna to “see” the maximum number of satellites. Placing an antenna on a rooftop
is often the optimal solution. However, extremely high winds can damage or
destroy a parabolic dish antenna.

Ground Antenna, Components and Control Systems
471

An Earth station antenna typically requires a rigid steel backup structure com-
bined with an accurate dish surface. They are ﬁtted with necessary bearings, gears,
and drives to enable pointing accuracy within a few tenths of a degree. Thus, the
structure must also be able to withstand extreme weather conditions, from excessive
heat to cold, and hurricanes. Three common antenna mount types are as follows:
1. Two-Axes (X–Y) Mount—This mount system is used for medium-sized
antennas (10–13 m). In Fig. 6.13 (Left) is shown an X–Y mount system, in
which lower axis (X) is parallel to the ground. Rotation about this axis moves
the antenna in elevation plane. The upper axis (Y) lies in a vertical plane and is
perpendicular to the X-axis. The position of the Y-axis in the vertical plane
depends on the rotation of the X-axis and can range from vertical to horizontal.
This is the simplest type of mount, but is a limited coverage mount. It provides
coverage up to 90° in the X-axis but in some cases, only ±5° in the Y-axis.
2. Two-Axes (AZ/EL) Mount—The location of a point on Earth surface can be
described by using the azimuth-over-elevation coordinate system. Azimuth is
deﬁned as an angle produced by rotation about an axis, which is perpendicular
to the local horizontal plane. The elevation axis rotates in the local horizontal
plane as the azimuth angle rotates. A change in the elevation angle will cause a
rotation of the antenna in the vertical plane. Installation of an AZ/EL antenna
mount is relatively easy. The azimuth axis should be very nearly vertical to the
local ground plane to minimize the change in elevation angle when azimuth is
swept. In Fig. 6.13 (Middle) is shown a simplest form of AZ/EL mount. This
type of mount has full elevation coverage and ±180° in azimuth.
There are two types of two-axes (AZ/EL) mount systems:
a) Fixed azimuth over elevation is shown in Fig. 6.14 (Left). This mount is
designed for an antenna that is deployed for ﬁxed service on a single satellite.
The satellite antenna is pointed manually in elevation, azimuth, and polarization
with the use of tools and requires an engineer on site to repoint.

Ground Segment

b) Two-axes motorized mount is shown in Fig. 6.14 (Middle). This is also an
azimuth over elevation mount in which both axes of movement are motorized
independently which allows a wider range of movement and pointing accuracy.
These antenna mounts can be controlled remotely and when combined with a
motorized polarization adjustment can offer full 3-axes pointing. There is also
3-axes mount with inclined orbit tracking, which uses a 3-axes mount com-
bined with electronics and tracking algorithms to track a satellite in an inclined
orbit. Typically this system provides track up to 10° Inclination.
Three main types of AZ-EL mounts are used for Earth station antennas, such as
King Post, shown in Fig. 6.15 (Left), Yoke & Tower, shown in Fig. 6.15 (Middle),
and Wheel on Track type, shown in Fig. 6.15 (Right).

an angle equal to the latitude of the site. Therefore, the hour angle axis is parallel
to the ground at the equator and perpendicular to the ground at either the North
or the South Pole, while the second angle is the declination.
In such a way, satellite longitude, Earth station longitude and latitude determine
the amount of declination required. This mount uses a single motorized axis to slew
the antenna so that the range of movement will follow an arc of sky that corre-
sponds to satellite locations in GEO constellation. Able to be repointed remotely,
this is the most cost-effective form of steerable satellite antenna and typically allows
coverage on a 90° segment of the GEO arc.
4. Ground Mount—There are additional antenna mount systems, which mostly
may suit the following applications:
a) Non-penetrating mount (NPM) is a freestanding mount designed to be placed
onto hard standing or a ﬂat roof and ballasted according.
b) Penetrating king post mount is a ground mount designed to be anchored into a
suitable structural foundation for permanent installations.
c) Wall mount is a mount that attaches the satellite antenna to a vertical wall
surface rather than the ground. This type of mount is convenient for smaller
antenna sizes where suitable load bearing walls are available.

Main Ground RES Antenna Geometry
and Parameters
Satellite ground Earth stations deploy dish antennas of 0.5–30 m in diameter. The
dish surface contour is based on the equation for a parabola:
y2 ¼ 4fx
ð6:1Þ
where f = focal length, and x = coordinate along the axis of the paraboloid.
A paraboloidal surface contour satisﬁes the requirement that all the energy
radiated from a launcher at the focal point toward the surface will be reﬂected to
form a phase coherent plane wavefront across the dish aperture. Expressed in
another way, path lengths ABC, ADE, and AFG, shown in Fig. 6.16, are all equal.
The important parameters of a ground satellite Earth station antenna are gain,
beamwidth, and sidelobes.
6.3.6.1
Ground Antenna Gain
Satellite ground antenna gain is deﬁned in the way, when a radio wave arriving
from a distant source impinges on the antenna that collects the power contained in
its antenna aperture effective (Ae). If the antenna were perfect and lossless, then the
474
6
Ground Segment

effective aperture area Ae would be equal to the actual projected area A. For a
circular aperture, the projected aperture is as follows:
A ¼ p d2=4
ð6:2Þ
where d = antenna diameter and the effective aperture area Ae = A (for an ideal
antenna).
Taking into account losses and the nonuniformity of the illumination law of the
aperture, the effective area is in practice expressed by the following equation:
Ae ¼ g A and Ae ¼ g p ðd=2Þ2
ð6:3Þ
where η = antenna efﬁciency and η < 1.
Efﬁciency is an important factor in antenna design, so in such a way, special
techniques are used to optimize the efﬁciency of Earth station antennas. Antenna
efﬁciency is affected by:
a) The subreﬂector and supporting structure blockage;
b) The main reﬂector RMS surface deviation;
c) Illumination efﬁciency, which accounts for the non-uniformity of the illumi-
nation, phase distribution across the antenna surface, and power radiated in the
sidelobes; and
d) The power that is radiated in the sidelobes.
Antenna aperture efﬁciencies between 55 and 75 % percent are typically
attainable. Then, the on-axis antenna power gain (relative to an isotropic radiator) is
given by relation:
Fig. 6.16 Geometry of paraboloid—Courtesy of Manual: by Intelsat
6.3
Ground Antenna, Components and Control Systems
475

G ¼ 4p Ae=k2
ð6:4Þ
where λ = is the free space wavelength and π = 3.14159…., and Ae = effective
aperture of the antenna. Substituting for Ae in (6.4) yields:
G ¼ g ðp d=kÞ2
ð6:5Þ
This relation can be expressed in decibels:
GdBi ¼ 10 log g þ 20 log p þ 20 log d  ð20 log kÞ or
GdBi ¼ 10 log g þ 20 log f þ 20 log d þ 20:4dB
ð6:6Þ
where η = antenna efﬁciency, d = antenna diameter in meters, f = operating fre-
quency in GHz and 20.4 dB = Constant value resulting from 10 log (1*109* π/c).
The deﬁnition of antenna gain is more straightforward if the antenna is con-
sidered during transmissions. However, according to the reciprocity theorem, the
properties of an antenna are the same for transmission and for reception of radio
signals. For example, an isotropic receiving antenna is able to receive uniformly
from the same transmitter positioned in any direction and power.
6.3.6.2
Ground Antenna Beamwidth and Bandwidth
Beamwidth is a measure of the angle over which most of the gain occurs. It is
typically deﬁned with respect to the half-power beamwidth (HPBW) or −3 dB
points of the main lobe in the antenna radiation pattern, and the scenario is shown in
Fig. 6.17 and is given by the following relation:
HPBW ¼ k=dp g  57:29
ð6:7Þ
An Earth station with an antenna of 16 m (52 ft) and an efﬁciency of 70 %
would have a beamwidth of 0.214° at 6 GHz.
With regard to the bandwidth, dish antennas are wideband devices. As seen from
the gain equation, for a given diameter, the gain of a dish will increase as the
frequency of operation increases. However, operation away from the design fre-
quency will normally result in impaired performance due to the limitations of the
feed and launch system.
6.3.6.3
Ground Antenna Sidelobes
While most of the power radiated by an antenna is contained in the main lobe, a
certain amount of power can be transmitted or received in off-axis directions.
Sidelobes are an intrinsic property of antenna radiation and cannot be completely
476
6
Ground Segment

eliminated. However, sidelobes are also due to antenna defects that can be mini-
mized with proper design. ITU-R Record 580-1, for instance module 1, deﬁnes the
desired sidelobe envelope for different types of antennas. Thus, antennas installed
after 1988 and with a ratio of d/ λ > 150 must meet the following characteristics:
G ¼ 29  25 log h dBi
ð6:8Þ
where θ = degrees from boresight and 1° ≤θ ≤20o, d = antenna diameter (me-
ters), and λ = wavelength for the operation frequency (meters).
For smaller antennas with d/λ between 35 and 100 (1.75–5 m for C-band and
75 cm–2.1 m for Ku-band) relation is as follows:
G ¼ 52  10 log d=k  25 log h dBi
ð6:9Þ
where for (100 λ/d)° ≤θ ≤d/5λ°.
Fore example, to calculate the transmit sidelobe envelope for a 1.5 m antenna
operating at 14 GHz. (l = 0.021 m) it is possible to get as follows: Ratio D/ λ = 70;
G = 52 −10 log (70) −25 log θ; GdBi = 33.5 −25 log θ; As D/ λ = 70; then
follows 1.4o ≤θ ≤d/5λ°14o.
Figure 6.17 shows a radiation pattern for a paraboloidal antenna and the rec-
ommended sidelobe characteristics. Diameter, operating frequency, and aperture
efﬁciency affect antenna parameters, but sidelobe characteristic is one of the main
factors in determining the minimum spacing between satellites and therefore, the
orbit and spectrum efﬁciency. In Fig. 6.18 is shown a plot of antenna gain as a
function of antenna diameters while using frequency and efﬁciency parameters.

6.3.6.4
Ground Antenna Noise Temperature
and Figure of Merit (G/T)
The system noise temperature of an Earth station consists of the receiver noise
temperature, the noise temperature of the antenna, including the feed and waveg-
uides, and the sky noise picked up by the antenna.
TSys ¼ TAnt=L þ ð1  1=LÞTo þ Te
ð6:10Þ
where RES values are: TSys = system noise temperature, L = feed loss in numerical
value, Te = receiver equivalent noise temperature, To = standard temperature of
290°K, and TAnt = antenna equivalent noise temperature as provided by the
manufacturer.
The noise power into the receiver due to the antenna is equivalent to that
produced by a matched resistor at the LNA input at a physical temperature of TAnt.
If a body is capable of absorbing radiation, then the body can generate noise. Thus,
the atmosphere generates some noise. This also applies to the Earth surrounding a
receiving ground station antenna. If the main lobe of an antenna can be brought
down to illuminate the ground, then the system noise temperature would increase
by approximately 290°K. Fortunately, however, synchronous satellites require
vertical angles of elevation of 5° or more. If the directivity of the antenna is such
that the ground absorbs 5 % of its radiated energy illuminates, then the same
antenna used for reception would contribute 5/100 × 290°K, i.e., 14.5°K of noise.
Every satellite antenna has sidelobes, which are augmented by “spillover” from
the dish edge and scattering of energy by the launcher or by the subreﬂector and its
supporting structure. All of these factors inﬂuence the noise temperature of the
antenna. The satellite antenna noise temperature is a complex function of antenna
gain pattern, background noise, temperature of the sky, equivalent atmospheric

noise temperature, and noise temperature of the Sun. Thus, a typical curve variation
of the antenna noise temperature with the antenna elevation angle is shown in
Fig. 6.19. It is usually a minimum at zenith, typically 15–20°K for a low loss
antenna with low sidelobes, which increases considerably as the elevation angle
falls below 10°.
The next important parameter of ground antenna is Figure of Merit (G/T). In
every radio transmission system, noise is a factor that greatly inﬂuences the whole
link quality. The G/TdBK is known as the “goodness” measurement of a receive
system. Satellite systems require a speciﬁc G/T for all of the standard Earth stations
for ﬁxed and mobile service, such as presented in the Intelsat Earth Station
Standards (IESS) documents. This means that providing the Earth station meets the
required G/T speciﬁcation, Intelsat or other satellite operators will provide enough
power from the satellite to meet the characteristic of every service.
The ground antenna G/T values are expressed in dB relative to 1°K, so at this
point the same system reference point, such as the RES receiver input, for both the
gain and noise temperature must be used by the following equation:
G=T ¼ GRx  10 log TSys
ð6:11Þ
where GRx = receive gain in dB and TSys = system noise temperature in °K.
In such a way, as the antenna gain is frequency-dependent, the G/T must be
normalized to a known frequency (normally either 4 or 11 GHz) by subtracting
from Eq. (6.11) the factor 20 log f/fo (fo being 4 or 11) where “f” is the frequency in
GHz.

6.3.6.5
Ground Antenna Pattern and EIRP
The ground satellite antenna pattern has a deﬁned beam edge, in which values of
equivalent isotropic radiated power (EIRP), G/T, and ﬂux density are referenced.
Adjustment factors to account for the location of an Earth station within the satellite
beam may be applied to the link analysis. These factors, called beta-factors, aspect
correction, or pattern advantage, apply to all satellite beams, with the exception of
the global beams. Thus, the beta factor is deﬁned as the difference between the
satellite beam edge gain and the gain in the direction of an Earth station. Each
station location should consider the beta-factors for uplink and for the downlink,
because, for the same station (and also the same beam), the uplink beam coverage is
not the same as for the downlink. A rough calculation of these factors can be made
through the satellite beam coverage as shown in the correspondent satellite IESS
where the lines or contours in the footprint represent 1 dB incremental from beam
edge. A more accurate value can be obtained by requesting it from Intelsat, espe-
cially in those cases where fully steerable satellite beams are used.
The radiation pattern indicates the variations of gain with direction. For an
antenna with a circular aperture or reﬂector, this pattern has rotational symmetry
and is represented within a plane in polar coordinate form shown in Fig. 6.20 (Left)
or Cartesian coordinate form shown in Fig. 6.20 (Right). The main lobe contains
the direction of maximum radiation, while side lobes should be kept to a minimum.
The angular beamwidth is the angle deﬁned by the directions corresponding to a
given gain fallout with respect to the maximum value. The 3 dB beamwidth,
indicated in Fig. 6.20 (Left) by u3 dB, is often used. The 3 dB beamwidth corre-
sponds to the angle between the directions in which the gain falls to half its
maximum value, which is related to the ratio λ = D by a coefﬁcient whose value
depends on the chosen illumination law. For uniform illumination, the coefﬁcient
has a value of 58.5°. Thus, with non-uniform illumination laws, which lead to
attenuation at the reﬂector boundaries, the 3 dB beamwidth increases and the value
of the coefﬁcient depends on the particular characteristics of the law.

Ground Segment

The power radiated per-unit solid angle by an isotropic antenna fed from a radio
frequency source of power PT is given by PT = 4π [W/steradian]. In a direction
where the value of transmission gain is GT, any antenna radiates a power per-unit
solid angle equal to PTGT/4p [W/steradian]. The product PTGT is called the EIRP
value expressed in Watts (W).
The gain of the Earth station antenna, from Eq. (6.5), is as follows:
Gmax ¼ gðp df=cÞ2
ð6:12Þ
where λ = c/f, c = velocity of light or 3 × 108 m/s and f = frequency of the
electromagnetic wave (EW). Hence, expressed in dBi (the gain relative to an iso-
tropic antenna), the actual maximum antenna gain is:
Gmax dBi ¼ 10 log g ðp d=kÞ2 ¼ 10 log g ðp df=cÞ2
½dBi]
ð6:13Þ
The power ﬂux density in relation to distance (R) is given by:
Umax ¼ PT GTmax=4p R2
ð6:14Þ
The maximum EIRP of the Earth station (on the axis) is given by:
EIRPmax ¼ PTGT max ¼ 53:1 dBi þ 20 dBW ¼ 73:1 dBW
ð6:15Þ
Therefore, PT at the input of the transmitting antenna multiplied by GT of the
same antenna is deﬁned as the EIRP and is usually expressed in dBW. The latter
also depends on the absolute power from the transmit ampliﬁer and the loss in the
combining and feed system. According to Fig. 6.21, the EIRP will be as follows:
EIRP = PA*(power) −(Feed loss) −(Combining losses) + Antenna Gain, where
PA*(power) = carrier power at power ampliﬁer output ﬂange.
In the link equation, by unfolding the kTB product under the logarithm, the
carrier-to-noise ratios (C/N) becomes:
C=N ¼ EIRP  L þ G  10 log k  10 log T  10 log B
ð6:16Þ

The difference, G −10logT is the ﬁgure of merit:
C=N ¼ EIRP  L þ G=T  10 log k  10 log B
ð6:17Þ
where values L = transmission losses, G/T = ﬁgure of merit of the receiver,
k = Boltzmann’s constant, T = temperature in Kelvin, and B = carrier occupied
bandwidth.
6.3.7
Ground Antenna Feed
An antenna with a feed in the center of the paraboloid dish (axisymmetric) repre-
sents the simplest antenna conﬁguration that is potentially capable of meeting the
RF speciﬁcations for RES applications. A major advantage of such a conﬁguration
is that mechanically, it has relatively simple design, reasonably compact and, in
general, fairly inexpensive.
In telecommunications and electronics, an antenna feed refers to the components
of an antenna which feed the radio waves to the rest of the antenna structure and in
the air or in receiving antennas collect the incoming radio waves, convert them to
electric currents, and transfer them to the receiver. Antennas typically consist of a
feed and additional reﬂecting or directive structures (such as a parabolic dish or
parasitic elements) whose function is to form the radio waves from the feed into a
beam or other desired radiation pattern.
The antenna feeds of all Earth stations perform the same basic functions:
a) To shape the beam to provide the required uniform illumination of the main
reﬂector.
b). To separate the transmit and receive signals with minimum loss and
interference.
c). To convert from circular to linear polarization and vice versa for the downlink
and uplink signals at C-band where circular polarization is employed.
d). To produce error signals that represent the degree and direction by which the
main beam is off-track. This is not required for antennas that use a step-track
system or are small enough not to need tracking.
In simple antennas, the feed usually consists of the feed antenna (driven ele-
ment), the part of the antenna which actually converts the RF currents to radio
waves or vice versa, and the feed or transmission line, which connects the feed
antenna with the receiver or transmitter. Thus, the antenna feed is the combination
of all of the components of the antenna that are used for the receiving and trans-
mitting purposes of RF waves, in which sample for Intelsat RES transceiving
antenna with associated components is shown in Fig. 6.22.
Antenna design should be made considering the maximum power transfer
possibilities and the efﬁciency. The antenna feed impedance must be matched with
the load resistance as the combination of the resistance, the capacitance, and the
482
6
Ground Segment

inductance, which includes radiation and loss resistance. The feed impedance is the
resistance offered at the input of the antenna to the signal and loss resistance is the
resistance that is offered by the actual components of the antenna. The loss and the
feed impedance must work together in order to achieve a proper working antennae
feed. The efﬁciency, gain, and absolute gain are very important considerations in
the design of the antenna feed. Thus, the total efﬁciency of the antenna describes the
losses at the input terminal and through the antenna components. It accounts for the
reﬂection, conduction, and the dielectric losses inside the antenna.
6.3.8
Ground Antenna Diplexer
The approach about antenna diplexers is the most efﬁcient for combining receive
and transmit signals. Each antenna diplexer uses two hybrids and two bands pass
ﬁlters, which typical diagram of two-port diplexer/combiner is shown in Fig. 6.23.
It consists of two diplexers (four are hybrids and four are band pass ﬁlters). The
ports in each hybrid are labeled A to D. Each hybrid is the same type as previously
described, so not only can it combine two signals into one, but it can also split a
single signal into two components.
The signal input 2 (or 1) is split by hybrid 1 (or 3) and will appear in ports 1-B
(or 3-B) and the same signal shifted 90° in port 1-C (or 3-C). Because the hybrid is
a passive reciprocal device, it follows that if two versions of the same signal (one
shifted 90° with respect to the other) are connected to two input ports (as for
hybrids 2), then the signal will combine to one of the output ports (port 2-B). But,
they will be canceled in the second port (port 2-C). The signal from diplexer 2 will
enter hybrid 4 (diplexer 1), will split, and will be reﬂected by ﬁlters F2, and
recombine to port 4-B reaching the combiner output.
In Table 6.1 is shown a typical insertion losses caused by the diplexer. Thus, the
drawback with this approach is that every diplexer is designed for a speciﬁc fre-
quency band, while it permits the use of smaller power ampliﬁers due to its low
combining losses.

6.3.9
Ground Antenna Tracking and Control Systems
During the early development of satellite communications, monopulse tracking of
one form or another was used almost exclusively. However, since the mid-1970s
through the present days, there has been a signiﬁcant shift toward the use of
step-track autotracking and modern programmed tracking, which will be shortly
presented in the following sections.
The term monopulse was derived from radar terminology to describe a case in
which angular error could be obtained from a single pulse. Thus, the type of
antenna feed used is the higher mode detection feeds, which use the fact that unless
the boresight axis of the feed is perpendicular to the incident EM ﬁeld, higher order
modes as well as the dominant mode will be produced within the feed waveguide.
By detecting the presence of these higher modes, tracking information relative to
angular displacement can be derived.

6.3.9.1
Antenna Step-track Autotracking
With the continuing improvement in the station-keeping accuracy of modern GEO
ﬁxed and mobile communication satellites, however, the opportunity arose to
reduce signiﬁcantly the complexity of the antenna autotracking system which, until
recently, was predominantly based on the monopulse tracking technique described
in the previous section. While this system is inherently very accurate, it is a
complex, expensive, and difﬁcult to maintain. To take advantage of the greater
station-keeping accuracy of today’s satellites, the monopulse tracking systems have
been largely replaced in recent years by the newest step-track system, principally
because of the latter’s great simplicity and consequently lower cost.
The operational concept of the step-track system is quite simple. After acqui-
sition of the satellite beacon (or pilot) signal, the antenna is commanded to make an
initial angular move. By comparing the received signal level before and after the
move, the direction of the next move can be decided. That is, if the signal level has
increased, the antenna continues to be moved in the same direction. If the signal
level has decreased, then the direction of movement is reversed. This process is
continuous and alternates between the two orthogonal antenna axes.
System interface of antenna step-track autotracking with connection between the
ACE, APE, and the servo drive system is shown in Fig. 6.24. For example,
Standard B ground Earth stations use single channel per carrier (SCPC) only, so the
signal often used by the autotracking system is the SCPC pilot, which is located in
the middle of the SCPC band. On the downlink, this pilot is extracted by the SCPC
terminal and passed onto the ACE. Thus, Intelsat spacecraft are equipped with
different beacon frequencies.

Ground Antenna, Components and Control Systems

The main disadvantages of the step-track system are as follows:
1. Locating a beam maximum can never be as accurate as ﬁnding a sharp null; and
2. Tracking can be degraded by amplitude ﬂuctuations in the received signal levels
due to atmospheric perturbations. This would also have a detrimental effect on
the receive signal at the satellite where the levels are required to be kept
within ±0.5 dB of nominal.
These limitations can be overcome by choosing a step size that is sufﬁciently
small, but not so small as to cause the antenna to continuously hunt the satellite as
during moderate wind loading conditions. The biggest advantage of the step-track
system is its simplicity, which means signiﬁcantly lower costs because a special
tracking communications feed to detect the higher modes is not required. The need
for maintenance is also reduced.
6.3.9.2
Antenna-Programmed Tracking
With the advent of inclined orbit satellites, a programmed tracking system becomes
more attractive and accurate. The antenna is under computer control and a per-
manent calculation of satellite orbital position is derived from pointing data (11
ephemeris parameters), thus eliminating the need for a satellite beacon. Also
available are the so-called smooth stepback systems, which are step-track systems,
using computer memories to memorize the satellite movement within the ﬁrst 24 h
of acquisition and then follow the memorized program. This feature is not rec-
ommended with inclined orbit.
6.3.9.3
Ground Antenna Telemetry, Tracking & Command
(TT&C) System
To maintain the satellite at its assigned GEO location periodic adjustments are made
by ground infrastructure station and antenna for Telemetry, Tracking & Command
(TT&C), including control and monitoring, by using propellant onboard the
spacecraft to enable repositioning of the satellite through the activation of
propulsion jets. This procedure, known as satellite station-keeping, keeps the
satellite drifting within certain bounds (like drawing a box). For the Intelsat
satellites, station-keeping is performed both in the east–west and in the north–south
directions. Thus, the amount of propellant placed on board, the satellite, therefore,
determines the maneuver life of a satellite. If near-zero orbit inclination during the
satellite launch phase (injection into GEO) is achieved, more fuel will be available
for station-keeping maneuvers. For satellite, station-keeping is necessary a 13-m
mono-pulse Cassegrain-type antenna with polarization diversity established for
S-band TT&C, which scenario is shown in Fig. 6.25 antenna (Left) and RF/BB
equipment for TTC (Right).
486
6
Ground Segment

To implement TTC&C facilities in any RES will be necessary to provide
reception of satellite beacons, which are the only signals, apart from the satellite
telemetry channel, which are produced by the satellite payloads. The majority of
Earth stations use them for tracking and reference purposes. Each satellite transmits
two satellite beacon signals in each of the frequency bands in the Pol Global Beam.
However, the C-band beacons are modulated with telemetry data, whereas the
Ku-band beacons are always unmodulated.
6.4
Ground Earth Station Radio Frequency Equipment
Radio frequency equipment in RES comprises low-noise ampliﬁers (LNA), power
dividers, high-power ampliﬁers (HPA), and power combiners, shown in Fig. 6.4.
6.4.1
Low-Noise Ampliﬁers (LNA)
To receive the very weak signals from a satellite, the RES antenna must be con-
nected to a highly sensitive receiver, i.e., one with very low inherent thermal noise.
Before that, the receiver is connected to a low-noise ampliﬁer (LNA) that ampliﬁes
a very low-power signal without signiﬁcantly degrading its signal-to-noise ratio
(S/N). An ampliﬁer will increase the power of both the signal and the noise present
at its input. The LAN units are designed to minimize the additional noise by
considering tradeoffs that include impendence matching, choosing the ampliﬁer
technology, and selecting low-noise biasing conditions.

6.3
Ground Antenna, Components and Control Systems
487

Thus, the LNA devices are ampliﬁers that have a very good noise performance
coupled with a wide bandwidth. This makes them essential for use as the ﬁrst stage
of a satellite RES receiving chain. Random movement of electrons causes thermal
noise, which within semiconductors can be minimized by reducing the actual
temperature of the LNA (by Peltier or cryogenic cooling method) or the current
method of using uncooled ﬁeld effect transistors (FET) ampliﬁers employing high
electron mobility transistor (HEMT) technology. An FET ampliﬁer uses one or
more FET components, which main advantage used for ampliﬁcation is that it has
very high-input impedance and low-output impedance.
Bipolar transistors cause (shot) noise other than thermal noise and can provide
mediocre performance at high frequencies. Besides, the noise due to ﬁeld effect
transistors is mainly of thermal origin and can be reduced by selecting the type of
semiconductor used and the geometric characteristics of the transistor. In such a
way, the performance in terms of noise factor is continuously improving due to the
use of gallium arsenide (GaAs) and submicron lithography. The typical block
diagram of GaAs FET is shown in Fig. 6.26.
The G/T system for an Earth station is virtually determined by the Noise
Figure (F) and gain of the LNA, along with the antenna gain. The LNA is generally
mounted as close to the antenna feed as possible so that the transmission line losses
to the LNA will be at an absolute minimum. An LNA must also provide sufﬁcient
gain to overcome losses in the transmission line between the receiver and the LNA.
6.4.2
Power Dividers (Splitter)
Power dividers or splitters are electronic elements used in receiving radio tech-
nology and, when used in reverse transmitter technology, power combiners and
directional couplers are passive devices used in the ﬁeld of radio technology. They
couple a deﬁned amount of the electromagnetic power in a transmission line to a
port enabling the signal to be used in another circuit. In such a way, when an Earth

station must demodulate several carriers simultaneously, it is necessary to distribute
the power at the LNA device output among the various converter channels. This is
performed by a power splitter using passive devices (hybrid couplers or power
dividers). The power splitter insertion loss LPS adds to the feeder loss LFRX from the
LNA output to the power splitter input. The power split among the n-channels
translates into attenuation by a factor n; hence, the total loss L from the LNA output
to any converter input is
L ¼ LFRX LPS n
ð6:18Þ
Basically, a 0° splitter is a passive electronic device which accepts an input
signal and delivers multiple output signals with speciﬁc phase and amplitude
characteristics. In fact, the output signals theoretically possess the following
characteristics: equal amplitude; 0° phase relationship between any two output
signals; high isolation between each output signal; and Insertion loss, for instance,
for 2 ports is 3 dB, for 8 ports is 8 dB, and for 48 ports is 16.8 dB, and so on. Thus,
in the reverse mode, power combiner will also exhibit isolation between the input
ports. The amount of isolation will depend upon the impedance termination at the
combiner output or sum port.
The sample of splitter and combiner is illustrated in Fig. 6.27. Namely, when is
used 0° power splitter, the input is applied to port S and equal outputs appear at
ports A and B. When used as a power combiner, both inputs are applied to ports A
and B and the sum taken from port S. The following signal-processing functions
can be accomplished by power splitter/combiners:
1. Add or subtract signals vectorially;
2. Obtain multi-in-phase output signals proportional to the level of a common
input signal;
3. Split an input signal into multioutputs;
4. Combine signals from different sources to obtain a single port output; and
5. Provide a capability to obtain RF logic arrangements.

High-power Ampliﬁers (HPA)
The order of magnitude of the power required at the transmitter output of RES
terminal is 1 W or less per telephone channel and 1 kW per television carrier. The

ampliﬁers are the Traveling Wave Tube Ampliﬁers (TWTA) and Klystron Power
Ampliﬁers (KPA). Furthermore, in the case of small Earth stations, Solid-state
Power Ampliﬁers (SSPA) are more and more used.
6.4.3.1
Traveling Wave Tube (TWT) Ampliﬁers
A TWT is an ampliﬁer with a wide bandwidth and a power gain of typically 25–
50 dB. The efﬁciency, in general, is a function of bandwidth and it ranges from 20
to 40 % with 20 % being a typical ﬁgure. It covers the entire usable band of the
satellite (500 MHz or more) with the necessary uniformity of gain and group delay.
Because of these features, the TWT appears to be the ideal power ampliﬁer for
Earth stations, since it allows several telephone carriers to be transmitted simulta-
neously with a single tube, irrespective of the repeaters and the frequencies allo-
cated to these carriers.
It should be noted that the simultaneous transmission of several carriers in the
same tube produces intermodulation noise components, which increase as the
operating point of the tube approaches saturation. Since the maximum level of
intermodulation components is subjected to speciﬁcation, the degree of linearity of
the tube parameter at the operating point is stipulated in each conﬁguration. This
leads to a back off of the operating point in relation to saturation and hence to a loss
of available power. This loss during multicarrier operation can now be partly offset
by using new equalizing devices known as linearizers.
In Fig. 6.28 is depicted a typical conﬁguration of TWT device. The RF wave’s
electric ﬁeld traveling in the slow-wave structure penetrates into the electron beam
region and causes some electrons to accelerate and some others to decelerate
producing a periodic velocity modulation in phase with the RF electric ﬁeld. The
electron bunches thus formed tend to concentrate ahead of the accelerating ﬁeld and
behind the decelerating ones. Because the average velocity of the electron beam is
slightly greater than that of the RF wave, bunches will tend to move back into
regions where the RF ﬁeld will decelerate the electrons. As the electrons lose
velocity, the energy lost by the electrons is transferred to the RF energy in the RF

wave. This transfer of energy registers a constant gain in the amplitude of the RF
wave per unit of length. At this point, a slow-wave structure will support RF energy
traveling from output to input as well as from input to output.
The wave traveling from input to output will be ampliﬁed, and the wave trav-
eling from output to input will not be ampliﬁed. However, in the presence of the
inevitable reﬂections at the output and input couplers, some RF energy could be
reﬂected back toward the input along the helix, and upon reﬂection from the input
coupler, this signal will represent RF feedback. All practical TWT have sufﬁcient
gain for this feedback mechanism to result in self-oscillation. It is fairly simple to
interrupt this feedback path by placing RF attenuation on one or more of the helix
support rods. Thus, this attenuation is depicted in Fig. 6.28 by a resistive section
(sever) and is formed by placing a carefully controlled pattern of a resistive material
on the rods prior to their installation into the helix structure. Pyrolytic graphite
(carbon) and titanium carbide are the most commonly used substances. The density
of this attenuation pattern is selected to provide a very low reﬂection of RF energy
so that any energy reﬂected from the output of the TWT is absorbed in the atten-
uation. The region of the helix structure containing the attenuation is called sever
because the RF wave on the helix is terminated or severed at this point.
The following subsections describe the basic elements, construction, and func-
tions of TWT are electron gun, cathode, heater, focus electrode, anode, slow-wave,
and structure.
6.4.3.2
Klystron Power Ampliﬁers (KPA)
Klystrons are essentially narrow passband devices at about 40 MHz for 6 GHz
klystrons, and 80 MHz for 14 GHz klystrons and sometimes more. These band-
widths sufﬁce for traditional frequency modulated (FDMA mode) carriers, but may
be inadequate for carriers with phase modulation and digital coding (TDMA mode).
In any case, the choice of the klystron as the type of tube to be used generally
entails the use of an ampliﬁer for each of the carriers transmitted except for SCPC
(and even possibly for SCPC and TV in certain domestic systems).
In Fig. 6.29 are depicted basic features of a typical multicavity klystron unit (5
cavities typical for a modern 3 kW KPA). Klystrons may be ﬁtted with a
mechanical (remote control) tuning device, whereby they can be adjusted to the
operational center frequency (or to the center frequency of the repeater) so that this
frequency can easily be changed.
In Fig. 6.30 is illustrated a typical block diagram of a KPA, which can also
optionally connect to the control logic the following units: computer interface POB,
remote control panel, and remote channel selector. Electrons emitted by the electron
gun pass through the cavity gaps in each of the resonators and through cylindrical
metal tubes (called drift tubes) located between the various gaps. Thus, in a
Klystron ampliﬁer, a low-level RF input signal is coupled into the ﬁrst resonator,
which is called the buncher cavity. The RF input signal excites oscillating currents
in the cavity walls, which causes an electric ﬁeld to appear across the buncher
6.4

491

gap. Then, this excited electric ﬁeld velocity modulates the electron beam creating
bunches of electrons.
After leaving the buncher gap, the electrons proceed toward the collector in the
drift tube region, passing through the intermediate resonators and the output
(catcher) cavity. If the catcher cavity is of the correct size (i.e., tuned to the proper
frequency), large oscillating currents will be generated in its wall that resulting in a
RF output from the tube. To acquire the high gain and the required saturated power
levels, intermediate cavities such as the second and third cavities are used. The
electron beam is focused from the gun through the cavity gaps and drift tubes to the
collector by means of a focusing structure, that is, either a permanent magnet for a
short tube or a solenoid for a long tube.

6.4.3.3
Solid-State Power Ampliﬁers (SSPA)
In the case of small low-capacity stations, an SSPA normally with ﬁeld effect
transistors may sufﬁce. Advances in FET technology, particularly Gallium
Arsenide FET (GaAsFET), have signiﬁcantly impacted satellite communications,
Earth station as well as spacecraft applications as block diagram is shown in
Fig. 6.26. The SSPA are available today to replace TWT in Earth stations and in the
new-generation satellites (all solid state).
The SSPA offers the following advantages over TWTA: superior intermodula-
tion distortion performance; higher reliability; lower maintenance and cost for
spares; longer operating life; higher personnel safety—no dangerous high voltages;
and lower power consumption.
Because of current advances in ﬁeld effect transistors using GaAs and advanced
circuit technology, recent power level of SSPA reached 100 W in 6 GHz band and
20 W in 14 GHz band. Solid-state power ampliﬁers are very reliable and eco-
nomical and may provide an ideal solution for small Earth stations.
6.4.4
Power Combiners
In a typical Earth station, there could be more than one power ampliﬁer connected
to the feed port of the antenna serving a particular polarization. Under these cir-
cumstances, it is necessary to combine the output of the ampliﬁers into a
single-signal path to the antenna feed. The output from the ampliﬁer is usually in
waveguide and is connected via one or more RF combiners. Thus, an RF combiner
can be one of three types, namely hybrids, circulators, and diplexers.
The hybrid power combiner approach is the simplest and least expensive method
for RF combining several signals. Hybrids used for this purpose are passive
devices, and they are used to either split or combine the signal. A 3 dB hybrid
combiner splits each input signal, so that 50 % of the input power (of input 1 and 2)
is combined, both signals suffer the same loss, and the lost power is dissipated in
the matched load. Similarly, a combiner shown in Fig. 6.31 splits each input signal
so that 67 % of the input power in the cross-arm and 33 % in the through arm
introduces a 1.8 dB loss to one signal, and 4.8 dB to the other.
Fig. 6.31 Power combiner—

The signal wasted will be 33 % of input 1 and 67 % of input 2. This type of
combiner is known as a Fixed Ratio. The power division in these types of com-
biners can vary from 0 to 100 %. A power combiner that allows the ratio to vary at
a given time, according to the needs of the stations, is known as a variable ratio.
The main drawback is the large amount of wasted transmitted power. The advan-
tage is that the system is wideband.
6.5
Ground Earth Station Communication Equipment
The term telecommunication equipment usually refers to the equipment, which
modulates the very high-frequency carrier with low-frequency signals (baseband)
for emission and extracts (demodulates) these low-frequency signals on reception.
Thus, the low-frequency signals may be analog telephone signals (usually multi-
plexed), digital signals, audio and video (television) signals, etc. The ground RES
telecommunication equipment comprises the main equipment: receivers, transmit-
ters, and uplink baseband processing signals. In particular, these equipment com-
prises
frequency
converter,
modulating
and
demodulating
equipment
and
signal-processing equipment.
6.5.1
Receivers (Rx) Subsystem
The receiver equipment is part of transceiver complex in any hypothetical ground
Earth station. Every radio receiver as a part of RES transceivers contains RF
equipment, such as Block Down Converters and Demodulators.
6.5.1.1
Block Down Converters (BDC)
Block downconverters change the radio frequency signals (e.g., 4 or 11 GHz)
received by the antenna and preampliﬁed by the LNA unit into intermediate fre-
quency signals. These signals are then translated to the baseband in the demodu-
lator. Ground Earth station receive electronics normally consist of an LNA at the
antenna with a microwave cable connecting it to the indoor receivers. The receivers
downlinks are equipped with downconverters to process either C-band or Ku-band,
including new in use RF Ka-band.
Low-noise BDC consists of an LNA and a downconverter combined into one
package. In Fig. 6.32 is illustrated an example of a low-noise BDC device where
the ﬁrst frequency conversion of a double frequency conversion occurs. The output
IF frequencies are in a lower RF band and are fed to the receivers to ﬁnal frequency
tuning and further processing. Even though there can be problems associated with
operating an BDC outdoors, where it would be exposed to varying climatic
494
6

conditions such as temperature and humidity, there are signiﬁcant advantages to
moving the ﬁrst frequency conversion outdoors, as follows:
a) The loss in coaxial cables increases as a function of the frequency as well as
their length, by decreasing the frequency, cheaper cable can be used and the
loss is reduced; and
b) One converter is shared by multiple receivers, making the receiver electronics
cheaper.
6.5.1.2
Demodulators
The most essential portion of the baseband-to-IF chain in ground Earth station
terminal consists of the demodulator and modulator or a combination of the two,
called a modem. On the receive side, the demodulator detects the incoming carrier,
synchronizes the data, performs error correction, and outputs a clean bitstream for
the particular application. However, the RES transmit side works in the opposite
direction. Threshold performance in terms of error rate and synchronization is
determined at this level of the station.
Because there must be one modem for each frequency, multicarrier FDMA Earth
stations can contain large quantities of these units, representing a sizable invest-
ment. In TDMA star networks, some frequency channels are shared by several
Earth stations. There would need to be only a single modem per ground Earth
station, since it can receive the bursts from the other Earth stations so long as they
do not overlap in time. That is, of course, central to the operation of a TDMA
satellite network as opposed to a CDMA network, where stations may transmit
simultaneously on the same frequency.
There are other different modulation schemes that can be used to demodulate and
modulate the data, such as QPSK, m-QAM, and FSK. In space communication,
power is severely limited. FSK is not generally used, as it would require very high
bandwidth to modulate our data resulting in very low bandwidth efﬁciency.
In Fig. 6.33 is presented the simpliﬁed block diagram of BPSK demodulator
section. This demodulator determines the ﬁnal performance BER, which is the ratio
of incorrectly received bits divided by the total received bits during a given time

6.5
Ground Earth Station Communication Equipment
495

interval. These errors are introduced when the received bandwidth contains
instantaneous peaks of noise and interference that cancel the desired signal. The
problem is further complicated by distortion of the bit pattern itself by bandwidth
limiting, which is necessary to reduce the total noise power and channel impair-
ments such as group delay and AM to PM distortion.
Therefore, the role of the RES terminal demodulator is to identify the phase or
phase shift of the received carrier and to deduce from it the value of the bits of the
transmitted binary stream. The demodulation unit can be as follows:
1. Coherent demodulation enables the binary stream to be reconstructed for both
cases of transmission encoding, direct (BPSK, QPSK) and differential (DE-BPSK,
DE-QPSK); and 2. Differential demodulation is always associated with differential
encoding in receiver during transmission. At this point, the transmitted information
can be recovered only if it is contained in phase changes.
6.5.2
RES Transmitters (Tx) Subsystem
The transmitter equipment is also part of transceiver complex in any hypothetical
ground Earth station. Every radio transmitter as a part of RES transceivers contains
RF equipment, such as Block Up Converters and Modulators.
6.5.2.1
Block up Converter (BUC)
A Block Up Converter (BUC) is used in the transmission RES uplink of satellite
signals. It converts a band of RF from a lower to a higher frequency. Modern BUC
units convert from the L-band to C-band, Ku-band, and Ka-band. Older generation
of BUC units convert from a 70 MHz intermediate frequency (IF) to Ku-band or
C-band.

496

Ground Segment

Most BUC units use phase-locked loop local oscillator and require an external
10 MHz frequency reference to maintain the correct transmit frequency.
The BUC units are generally used in conjunction with LNB and in association
with an orthogonal mode transducer (OMT). It being an upconverting device,
makes up the transmit side of the system, while the LNB is the downconverting
device and makes up the receive side. An example of a system utilizing both a BUC
and an LNB is a satellite broadcasting system, used for DVB-RCS interactive
telecommunications via VSAT, IPTV transmissions, and fast bidirectional Internet
access via satellite.
In Fig. 6.34 is shown the block diagram of double upconverter, which change IF
signals, such as 70 MHz, 140 MHz, 1 GHz, and so on, from the modulator into RF
signals in the 6 GHz or 14 GHz band. These RF signals are then ampliﬁed by the
power ampliﬁer before being transmitted through the antenna.
Upconverters and downconverters are usually composed of RF ﬁlters, 2 cas-
caded mixers, 2 Local Oscillators (LO); one ﬁxed frequency and the other variable
frequency, IF ampliﬁers, possibly with automatic gain control, IF ﬁlters, group
delay equalizers (GDE).
6.5.2.2
Modulator
In Fig. 6.35 is depicted a block diagram of a typical BPSK digital modulator, such
as that used in a TDMA transmissions. Modulation is provided by mixing the data
with a 70 MHz carrier and inverting the sinewave, when a change from 1 to 0 or
vice versa is desired. The QPSK transmission can be obtained by adding a 90°
phase shift to a second-modulated stream of data, thus doubling the use of the
uplink frequency channel.
Reception works in the reverse direction, using the same mixing process but
resulting in the original data being recovered. In such a way, additional circuitry is
needed on the receive side to remove satellite link noise and resolve the bit pattern.
The latter is accomplished by a decision circuit that, simply enough, decides if the

6.5
Ground Earth Station Communication Equipment
497

received bit is 1 or 0. The presence of noise and distortion in the demodulated bits
causes the decision circuit to make a bad decision occasionally, a process that gives
bit errors. It is the average rate of those errors, the BER, which determines received
data quality.
The typical satellite modem (and terrestrial modem, as well) also contains the
FEC coding and decoding circuitry that reduces the BER by factors of 100–10,000,
depending on the strength of the coding technique. Other functions include burst
synchronization for TDMA, baseband processing such as compression and
decompression, including encryption and decryption, if appropriate.
6.5.3
Downlink Baseband Processing Signals
(BPS) Equipment
The downlink BPS equipment is part of receiver complex of ground Earth station.
Every radio receiver as a part of RES transceivers contains DeMUX and Decoder.
6.5.3.1
Demultiplexer (DeMUX)
Demultiplexer or DeMUX or ﬁle splitter is an electronic device taking an input
analog or digital signals and selecting one of many data output lines, which is
connected to the single input on the receiving end is often used with a comple-
mentary multiplexer. There are many types of demultiplexers, but here will be
explained one of them.
The most common multistage frequency demultiplexer design is shown in
Fig. 6.36. In this structure, the bandwidth of the input signal X(z) is divided into
two sub-bands of equal bandwidths at the ﬁrst stage. In the next stage, each
sub-band is further divided into two new sub-bands of equal bandwidths. This
process is continued until the last stage is completed. However, in order to divide
the input signal in K channels, the demultiplexer must include M = log2 (K) stages.
The basic signal-splitting element at each stage, designated H1,…, HM in Fig. 6.36,
may simply be a two-channel ploy-phase Inverse Offset Discrete Fourier Transform
(IODFT) demultiplexer.

6.5.3.2
Decoder
A decoder is an electronic circuit that changes a code into a set of signals. Thus, it is
called a decoder because it does the reverse of encoding done by encoder, but we
will begin our study of encoders and decoders with decoders because they are
simpler to design.
There are many decoders such as: audio decoder that converts analog audio to
digital form; binary decoder provides digital circuits such as 1-of-N and
seven-segment decoders, decompressor (compression decoder) converts compressed
data, such as audio, video, and images to an uncompressed form; instruction decoder
is an electronic circuit that converts computer instructions into CPU control signals;
and video decoder that converts base-band analog video to digital form.
The decoding operation in receiver is also performed on a block-by-block basis
by the Low Delay Codebook Excited Linear Prediction (LD-CELP) decoder.
Namely, upon receiving each 10-bit index, the decoder performs a table lookup to
extract the corresponding codevector from the excitation codebook. In such a way,
the extracted codevector is then passed through a gain-scaling unit and a synthesis
ﬁlter to produce the current decoded signal vector. The synthesis ﬁlter coefﬁcients
and the gain are then updated in the same way as in the encoder.
The decoded signal vector is then passing through an adaptive postﬁlter, which
has to enhance the perceptual quality. The postﬁlter coefﬁcients are updated peri-
odically using the information available at the decoder. The ﬁve samples of the
postﬁlter signal vector are next converted to ﬁve A-law or μ-law PCM output
samples, which is depicted in Fig. 6.37, where VQ Index is meaning index of
Vector Quantization (VQ) and conversion is using Pulse Code Modulation (PCM)

6.5.4
Uplink Baseband Processing Signals
(BPS) Equipment
The uplink BPS equipment is part of transmitter complex of ground Earth station.
Every radio transmitter as a part of RES transceivers contains MUX and Encoder.
6.5.4.1
Multiplexer (MUX)
Multiplexing is the reversible operation of combining several information bearing
signals to form a single, more complex signal. The signals that are combined in a
multiplexer usually come from independent sources, such as subscribers in a
telephone network. Prior to multiplexing, each signal travels over a separate elec-
trical path, such as a pair of wires or a cable, whereas the multiplexed signal can be
transmitted over a single communication medium of sufﬁcient capacity. The
reversibility permits recovery of the original signals, which often have different
ﬁnal destinations at the receiving end of the transmission link. This inverse oper-
ation whereby the original signals are recovered is demultiplexing.
In Fig. 6.38 is shown the most common multistage frequency multiplexer. It
may be regarded as the dual structure of the multistage demultiplexer shown in
Fig. 6.36. The ﬁlter bank takes a number of K narrow-band input signals and
combines these to produce a broadband signal, using M = log2 (K) stages. At the
ﬁrst stage, the input signals are organized in K/2 pairs, and each pair is combined to
one signal. At the second stage, the resulting signals are paired and combined. This
process proceeds until the ﬁnal output signal is provided at the output of the last
stage. The basic signal-combining element at each stage may simply be a
two-channel IODFT frequency multiplexer.
6.5.4.2
Encoder
An encoder is an electronic device, circuit, transducer, software program, algorithm
or person that converts information from one format or code to another, for the
purposes of standardization, speed, or compressions.

and so on.
In Fig. 6.39 is depicted the block diagram of LD-CELP encoder, where Min.
MSE is Minimum Magnetic Stripe Encoding. After the conversion from A-law or
μ-law PCM to uniform PCM, the input signal is partitioned into blocks of ﬁve
consecutive input signal samples. Thus, for each input block, the encoder passes
each of 1024 candidate codebook vectors (stored in an excitation codebook)
through a gain-scaling unit and a synthesis ﬁlter. From the resulting 1024 candidate
quantized signal vectors, the encoder identiﬁes the one that minimizes a
frequency-weighted mean-squared error measure with respect to the input signal
vector.
The 10-bit codebook index of the corresponding best codebook vector or
codevector, which gives rise to that best candidate quantized signal vector, is
transmitted to the decoder. The best codevector is then passed through the
gain-scaling unit and the synthesis ﬁlter to establish the correct ﬁlter memory in
preparation for the encoding of the next signal vector. The synthesis ﬁlter coefﬁ-
cients and the gain are updated periodically in a backward adaptive manner based
on the previously quantized signal and gain-scaled excitation

General Infrastructure of Earth Station
The general infrastructure of an Earth station includes all premises, RES buildings
and civil engineering works. In the premises space are located communication and
TT&C antennas, while outside of the RES buildings are RF equipment, testing
equipment, terrestrial interface points, and power supply units

6.6.1
Terrestrial Interface Equipment and Subsystems
Baseband data processing for converting the transmission formats of the terrestrial
network into the satellite link formats and reciprocally at receive should be provided
by the modem devices. The following terrestrial interface functionalities are
included in a framing unit:
– Engineering Service Channel (ESC) equipment facilities;
– Redundancy switching for secured links;
– Data framing and synchronization; and
– Energy dispersion by scrambling.
The physical interfaces must comply with common standards, such as V.11,
V.24, X.21 and HDB3, …) depending on the data rate. The ESC functions provide
operation such as insertion/extraction of the dedicated channel into/from the normal
trafﬁc channel. Thus, synchronous multiplexing of overloads bits for the provision
of ESC and alarms is also accomplished in the framing unit.
The clock of the data transmission along the satellite link may be provided by a
network clock, a local Earth station clock, or from the incoming signal.
A plesiochronous buffer copes with asynchronism, jitter, and Doppler effects.
The last function of the framing unit is to give some minimal stochastic char-
acteristics to the data stream sent to the link. The two main purposes are scrambling
for energy dispersion of the transmitted spectrum and of the receiver synchro-
nization, and interleaving that permits spreading out bursts of errors generated by
loss of synchronization in decoders. This latter technical approach is also used in
the implementation of Reed–Solomon codes.
The terrestrial interface subsystem comprises one or several terrestrial interface
modules (TIM), which connect to each user link and provide the appropriate
buffering for data compression at the satellite transmit side (sub-bursts creation) and
data expansion at the satellite receive side (sub-bursts extraction). Several types of
TIM may be found depending on the type of terrestrial link to connect:
– 2 Mb/s or 1.544 Mb/s PCM links (telephony applications);
– Higher rate PCM links (telephony or digital TV applications);
– Various types of serial data links (EIA RS-232 or RS-422, ITU-T X.2 l, etc.);
and
– 2 or 4-wire analog links.
In some cases, TIM units include additional processing for onboard voice
compression or fax demodulation (telephony applications), or protocol spooﬁng
(data applications). Some experimental systems include also ATM-oriented TIM
units.

6.6.2
Power Supply Equipment
The satisfactory operation and service continuity of an Earth station depends on the
correct design of its electric power supply. There are two main sources of power: 1.
Main power supply, with stand-by capability; and 2. Uninterrupted Power Supply
(UPS). Otherwise, can also be included batteries and solar power supply.
In addition, an auxiliary low voltage 24 V or 48 V DC source may be required
to supply certain automatic equipment, while the main supply distribution network
is via the station transformer unit. It is backed up by an independent generating set
(or better still by two sets with 1 + 1 redundancy) driven by a fast-start 5–10 s
diesel engine. This generator, which for large stations would have a power of
usually about 250 kVA, supplies the whole station including the antenna motors,
lighting and air-conditioning.
Maintaining the standby generator and keeping a stock of diesel fuel is one of
the basic tasks in the management of the station. The purpose of the UPS, which
receives its primary energy from the main power supply, is to provide a constant
high-quality power supply (stable voltage and frequency with no signiﬁcant tran-
sients), while the standby sets are starting up following a power cut in the distri-
bution network.
6.7
Inmarsat GEO Land Earth Stations (LES)
The ground segment of Inmarsat GEO MSC operator comprises an integrated
network of Land Earth Stations (LES), which are operated by Land Earth Station
Operators (LESO), Network Coordination Stations (NCS), and a Network
Operations Center (NOC). The LES sometimes referred to as Coast Earth stations
(CES) in the maritime and land mobile environment and Ground Earth Stations
(GES) in the aeronautical mobile environment, which links the Inmarsat’s satellite
constellations with the national and international telecommunication network.
The LES are owned independently by telecommunication operators, which are
often, but not always, the national signatory, the organization nominated by the
government to invest in and work with Inmarsat of the country in which the LES is
located. One LES can support multiple services providers. At present, there are
about 40 LESO companies that are managing more than 40 LES terminals dis-
tributed around the globe, with at least one on every continent.
The LESO companies provide a link between the satellite constellations and the
international telecommunication network. An LES is capable of handling many
voice calls and data transfer to and from different MES terminals, such as Ship
Earth Station (SES), Vehicle Earth Station (VES), Aircraft Earth Stations (AES),
Transportable Earth Stations (TES), and Personal Earth Stations (PES), simulta-
neously over the different Inmarsat networks. Many LESO now offer service in all
4-ocean regions, through a global-sharing agreement with other LESO operators in

ocean regions, which cannot be seen from their own location. The 4 ocean regions
are as follows: 871 Atlantic Ocean Region—East (AOR-E), 872 Paciﬁc Ocean
Region (POR), 873 Indian Ocean Region (IOR), and 874 Atlantic Ocean Region—
West (AOR-W).
For each Inmarsat satellite system and ocean region, there is an NCS that
monitors and controls all communications. Each NCS communicates with the LES
terminals in its ocean region, the other NCS and NOC terminals located at
Inmarsat’s London headquarters, making it possible to transfer operational infor-
mation throughout the system. The NCS terminals are involved in setting up calls
between an MES and an LESO facility. The LESO provider is responsible for
adding an MES to, or removing an MES from, the MES authorization table that
allows or disallows access to the space segment. In addition, LESO is providing and
conducting service veriﬁcation for different MES standards, such as IsatData Pro,
IsatM2 M, Inmarsat-C and mini-C, Fleet 33/55/77, Fleet One, FleetBroadband,
BGAN, and Maritime Global Xpress for SES terminals. For VES terminals,
Inmarsat is providing transportable or installed mini-M and BGAN standards, while
for AES terminals Inmarsat provides modern standards such as Swift64,
SwiftBroadband, and Aero Global Xpress.
The LES terminal is a powerful land-based receiving and transmitting station
serving in a GMSC system. Although LES is ﬁxed and is not moving, it can serve
but cannot be part of FSS. Some LES, such as Goonhilly, provides widely ﬁxed
links for FSS, and consequently the Inmarsat MSC network is a small part of
overall LES providing service for Inmarsat-A, B/M, mini-M, D + and Aero MES.
Each LES in the IGN is owned and operated by an Inmarsat Signatory in the
mission to provide a range of service to all types of MES. There are more than 40
LES terminals located in 30 countries round the globe, but usually in the northern
hemisphere, which is a small anomaly. The MES operator and shore subscribers can
choose the most suitable LES, as long as they are within the same Ocean Region.
The fundamental requirement for each Inmarsat LES is that it be capable of
communicating reliably with all MES terminals. There are two major types of LES:
CES for maritime and land mobile applications providing service to all standards of
SES and VES, and GES for aeronautical mobile applications providing service to
all standards of AES terminals only.
The list of LES terminals, type of service and access codes, the country in which
they are based and Ocean Region of operation are given in Inmarsat Operational
Handbooks, in Admiralty List of Radio and Satellite Services and in ITU list of
Coast Stations.
The technical side of typical Inmarsat LES (CES or GES) consists of three main
features: the antenna system (left), the communication RF equipment (between
Feed and ACSE), and ACSE unit (right), as illustrated in Fig. 6.40.
1. Antenna System—A typical LES antenna system for entire IGN would be a
Cassegrain structure with a dish reﬂector of about 14 m diameter. At this point,
each LES can have a minimum of one operational and one spare antenna in
order to continue transmissions during maintenance. Some stations have more
504
6
Ground Segment

than two antennas, which depend on the Ocean Region covered and service
provided. Thus, the antenna operates in both the L- and C-band to and from
satellite, with gain requirements of 50.5 and 29.5 dBi, respectively. This antenna
is designed to withstand high wind speed up to 60 m/h in its operational attitude
and 120 m/h when stowed at 90°, and the parabolic dish would be steer-
able ± 135° in azimuth and 0°–90° in elevation angle. Tracking is ether by
automatic program control or operator initiated. The antenna tracking accuracy
of 0.01° RMS and repositioning velocity of 1°/s would be typical parameters for
such a dish. The RF and baseband processing hardware design varies greatly
with LES design and requirement. A single antenna may be used to transmit and
receive L-band as well as the C-band signals or employing a separate L-band
antenna avoids the need for a relatively complex feed system (to combine and
separate the outgoing and incoming L-band and C-band signals) but this
advantage must be weighed against the cost of procuring and installing a second
antenna.
2. Communication RF Equipment—The equipment is situated inside of LES
building and must be able to operate in Tx and Rx L-band link; to monitor the
MSC L-band channel and respond to requests for frequency allocations by the
NCS; to verify signal performance by loop testing between satellite and LES;
and to receive the C-to-L Automatic Frequency Control (AFC). The AFC
provides Tx and Rx direction control, which helps to keep MES as simple and
as cheap as is practicable. A complete test of the LES equipment can be carried
out without the cooperation of the MES, because a separate test terminal is
provided at each LES for this purpose. The Inmarsat system requires AFC to
correct for Doppler shift (caused by inclination of the GEO) and errors in
frequency translation in the satellite and LES terminals.

6.7
Inmarsat GEO Land Earth Stations (LES)
505

The total frequency shift from the cause without AFC could be more than
50 kHz, thus is of the same order as the spacing between the NBFM channels
and would be enough to cause failure of the system. The AFC reduces the RF
shift to a few hundred hertz by comparing pilot carriers transmitted via the
satellite with reference oscillators at the LES and using the difference signals to
control the RF of the local oscillator associated with the up- and downconverter.
A pilot transmitted at C and received at L-band is used to control the upcon-
verter and thus offset the frequencies of the operational carriers to compensate
for
Doppler
shift
and
satellite
frequency
translation
errors
in
the
ground-to-mobile direction. Similarly, a pilot transmitted at L and received at
C-band controls the downconverter and corrects for Doppler shift and errors in
translation in the mobile-to-ground direction. All RF errors are corrected except
those arising from frequency instability of the MES up and downconverter, and
Doppler shift resulting from the relative velocity of satellite and MES.
3. ACSE—Antenna control and signaling equipment (ACSE) is part of LES,
whose principal purpose is to recognize request for calls, to set and release. This
requires response to and initiation of in-band and out-bands signaling over
satellite and terrestrial path. The next ACSE tasks are to recognize distress calls
(from SES–AES) and preempt channels for them when necessary; to check that
MES are on the list of authorized users and to bar calls (except all distress calls)
from or to unauthorized MES; to switch voice circuits between TTN circuit and
the LES FM channel modem; to switch Tlx circuits between TTN channels and
the TDM/TDMA time slots; to determine Tx/Rx frequencies used by the FM
channel unit in accordance with the channel allocations made by the NCS; to
allocate TDM and TDMA time slots; and to collect statistics for billings,
international accountings (for transit calls), trafﬁc analyses, and management
and maintenance purposes.
The MSC services offered by an LES vary depending upon the complexity of the
station selected. For example, a typical LES could offer a wide range of services
from and to the MES located in convenient ocean regions, such as two-way voice
including fax/paging, Tlx, all data rate, Video, GAN/Internet, and Mobile
Emergency service (Distress, Urgency, Safety and Medical assistance calls). The
Inmarsat LES are operating in the 6/4 GHz band, and MES operate in the
1.6/1.5 GHz band. The LES terminals provide feeder link to the Inmarsat satellites,
and MES terminals provide service link in reverse.

Iridium non-GEO Gateways
The Iridium network can provide voice and data services for all mobile applica-
tions, such as maritime, land, and aeronautical, including personal and determi-
nation service. Thus, in support of this service, a new type of mobile, referred to as
a Satellite Data Unit (SDU) is deployed that will interoperate with the Iridium
506

global satellite communications system and the existing mobile voice and data
communication systems to users via satellite network and ground infrastructures.
The three main components of the Iridium MSC service are as follows: Space,
Ground, and Users segments.
The Iridium ground segment provides voice and data MSC service via 66 LEO
satellites and two Gateways only, because utilizes Inter Satellite Links (ISL).
The ISL network is providing connection of all Iridium satellites transferring MSC
service and route network trafﬁc to the Regional gateways and PSTN from any user
station worldwide.
The Iridium gateway shown in Fig. 6.41 provides a number of the following
roles:
1. Setup and maintain basic telephony services. The gateway provides the interface
for all communications between Iridium subscribers and between Iridium sub-
scribers and PSTN leased line users worldwide;
2. Interface to the PSTN or leased lines to the Iridium constellation via Gateways
functions;
3. Provide messaging and data services, dial-up data, Short Burst Data (SBD),
including
Direct
Internet
access
and Router-Based

Digital
Internetworking Connectivity Solutions (RUDICS); and
4. Messaging processing and services, management and billing functions.
The Gateway is split into two functional areas, such as the Gateway
Management System (GMS) and the gateway operational elements. The Iridium
gateway is comprised of the following network elements: Message Origination
Center (MOC); GSM Switch Subsystem (SSS); Ground Notiﬁcation Center (GNC);
Gateway Management System (GMS); Ground Earth Terminals (GET); Earth

Network (PSTN), Operational Support Network-Gateway (OMC-G); Operational

The SCS system is the central management function in the Iridium satellite
network, which provides global operation, support, and control services for the
operational Space Vehicle (SV) constellation, delivers SV tracking data to gate-
ways, and performs the termination control function of messaging use a Message
Termination Center (MTC). Thus, the SCS comprises three main components:
Telemetry Tracking and Control (TTAC) sites, Control Facilities (CF), and
Operational Support Network (OSN).
6.9
DVB-RCS HUB Terminal
The DVB-RCS VSAT network has been designed to minimize the cost of scaling a
satellite broadcast, broadband, and multimedia access via few HUB station solu-
tions from terminal populations as small as several hundred VSAT units to tens or
even hundreds of thousands of simultaneously logged-on VSAT units in urban and
rural or remote areas, including for all mobile applications.
The HUB VSAT station is usually a relatively large, high-performance Earth
station with an antenna diameter of anything between 6 and 9 m with tracking
system, which consists of a control center to manage the network as well as
microwave equipment, including an outdoor antenna for the transmission and
reception of signals. Thus, a substantial amount of interfacing equipment necessary
to support the wide range of terrestrial interfaces required at the HUB completes the
installation. This equipment is usually mounted in several racks, which block
diagram is shown in Fig. 6.42. The customer has choice of C, Ku, or Ka antennas
and CIT RF equipment, what is depending on available satellite transponder RF
band. The HUB can handles 1–10 forward link VSAT terminals and from one to
several hundred return link receivers up to 200,000 terminals. Its architecture is also
designed to accommodate upgrades and expansions, and to optimize stability in
operation.
A Radio Frequency Terminal (RFT) contains the following components:
The transmit subsystem of HUB containing upconverters which change the 70 or
140 MHz IF to the required transmit frequency before feeding it to the HPA unit. In
fact, if the HUB only uses a single carrier for data it is possible to use an SSPA
otherwise a more powerful TWTA must generally be used. Uplink power control is
often provided so that the power transmitted by the HUB can be increased to
compensate for high link attenuation due to precipitation in bad weather. The
receive subsystem consisting of an LNA with a noise temperature usually between
150 and 175°K (Ku-band) and a downconverter to change the received frequency to
the IF frequency (70 or 140 MHz). A Network Control Center (NCC) controls and
monitors the operation of the HUB and the IDU devices in the network.
508
6
Ground Segment

The HUB station consists of several main subsystems, except for the HUB
antenna; these are usually fully redundant with automatic switchover in the event of
failure:
A switch is generally a packet switch subsystem, which controls routing between
host ports and the modulator and demodulator ports, as well as adding and reading
header address information which controls routing to and from individual IDU
devises. Moreover, HUB consists of one or more modulators that modulate the
outbound carriers with the TDM stream, which is generated by the switch (each
outbound carrier has a dedicated modulator), and then is included a bank of
demodulators which receive the inbound carriers and extract the data packets and
feed them to the switch.

Users Segment
In general, Global Mobile Satellite Communications (GMSC) terminals can be
located onboard ships, land vehicles, and aircraft and can be also used as trans-
portable or handheld personal transceivers. Thus, as these mobiles can be in motion
when the communications are in progress, there are some special considerations
that need to be taken into account in the design and installation of the GMSC
terminal onboard mobiles. The antenna should be mounted clear of any obstructions
on the vehicle so as not to reduce the signal strength. However, if the antenna is
directional, typically having a gain greater than 6 dBi, then it will also need to
include a mechanism to automatically track the GMSC satellite. This may be
accomplished by either mechanically rotating a ﬁxed beam antenna, or by the use of
electronic steerable or switchable beams in the case of phased-array antennas.
The GMSC terminal itself may be physically separated into two parts: an
external sealed unit that houses antenna in the special plastic radome, radio fre-
quency (RF) front end and possible antenna-tracking unit and an internal unit
normally located near the operator that houses the other radio components.
The LNA units are usually placed as close as possible to the diplexer so as to
minimize the noise resulting from losses in the feed guides.

Overview of GMSC Applications
There are a wide variety of applications supported by the GMSC services for the
general provision of voice, data, and video (VDV) communications to users of the
maritime, land, aeronautical, and communities worldwide. In Fig. 7.1 are intro-
duced the space, ground, and user segments for Inmarsat and DVB-RCS conﬁgu-
rations of GMSC service.
The GMSC infrastructure can provide global coverage just with three geosta-
tionary Earth orbit (GEO) satellites to mobile earth station (MES) and ﬁxed earth

station (FES) via Inmarsat or DVB-RCS satellite constellations. The applications
include emergency distress alerting and locating services, direct-dial telephone
(voice), data transfer, facsimile, telex, electronic mails (E-mail), high-quality audio
transmission, still pictures, videoconferencing, and compressed (digital) video. In
general, the complete GMSC service can be included in a modern package known
as voice, data, and video over IP (VDVoIP). Digital data rates currently available
from different mobile satellite system (MSS) providers vary from tens of
bits-per-second, which is suitable for short messaging services to 64 Kb/s, which is
suitable for many high-speed data applications. Even higher bit rates are planned;
for instance, the top Inmarsat GMSC onboard equipment is able to provide forward
link transmission speed up to 50 Mb/s, while mobile DVB-RCS interactive VSAT
several may provide forward link speed up to 775 Mb/s and even 1 Gb/s.
The GMSC equipment terminals come in a wide variety of shapes and sizes.
They may be designed to be carried by the person, transported to a site, or ﬁxed to a
vehicle, ship, small craft, or an aircraft. They can vary from small paging terminals
or handheld phones that ﬁt on a trouser belt to very large terminals with directional
dish antennas, requiring a stable platform for the operation to compensate for ship
movement in rough seas. Typical users of GMSC applications are as follows:
1. Maritime Users—These users can be all ﬂoating objects at sea or rivers and
lakes, such as operators of ﬁshing boats, yachts, cargo ships, container vessels,
ferryboats, drilling rigs, oil tankers, liquid natural gas carriers, and passenger
cruise ships.

2. Land Users—In general, these users can be road and rail vehicles, while in
particular, they can be journalists, traveling executives, disaster relief agencies,
government ofﬁcials, mineral exploration companies, and workers at remote
sites, for example, in the building of hydropower projects, agriculture, mining,
constructing companies, and tourism.
3. Aeronautical Users—These users can be longhoul airway operators, general
aviation, corporate or private aircraft, and helicopters.
4. Personal Users—These users can be all persons carry handheld satellite ter-
minals either onboard mobiles or ashore.
5. Transportable Users—These users can be transportable satellite terminals
either inside land vehicles or as a temporary installation ashore.
6. Portable Users—The Broadband Global Area Network (BGAN) developed by
Inmarsat is a portable GMSC transceiver that can provide Internet access via
laptop or smart device.
7.1.1
General Architecture of GMSC System
The GMSC systems, whether they be designed to address maritime mobile, land
mobile, or aeronautical mobile satellite services, all have certain common charac-
teristics. Likewise, the satellites employed in these GMSC systems can be found in
constellations using the GEO and non-GEO, such as medium Earth orbit (MEO),
low Earth orbit (LEO), and high elliptical orbit (HEO), with widely differing
perigees and apogees or even some combination of these orbital conﬁgurations
known as hybrid satellite orbits (HSO).
It is more common, both globally and regionally, for the majority of GMSC
allocations to be speciﬁed as generic MSS service, in the RR Table of Frequency
Allocations, Article 5—rather than specifying the particular type of MSS applica-
tions, such as maritime, land, and aeronautical.
7.1.1.1
Functions of Feeder and Service Links in GEO GMSC
Networks
Irrespective of which orbital conﬁguration is employed, the GEO GMSC systems
differ from ﬁxed satellite system (FSS) service in one key aspect. Speciﬁcally, the
FSS service uses one pair of RF bands, namely one band for uplink and one for
downlink to connect ﬁxed points via the satellite links.
However, the MSS service employs two pairs of links: one set known as MSS
service links and the other set designated as MSS feeder links. The MSS service
works in the way that MES transmits on the Earth-to-Space 1.6 GHz service link to
7.1
Overview of GMSC Applications
513

the satellite, and then, the satellite repeats that transmission on the Space-to-Earth
4 GHz feeder link to the Gateway ﬁxed Earth station or LES. The LES terminal, in
turn, is typically interconnecting the call or data transmission via the public swit-
ched telephone network (PSTN) to the party to whom the mobile wishes to connect.
The landline party then sends back voice or data calls to the LES terminal, which
transmits it via 6 GHz feeder link to the satellite transponder. Finally, the satellite
transponder repeats that latter transmission backs again to the mobile terminal on
1.5 GHz, which originated the call via the service link.
In Fig. 7.2 is illustrated the tandem use of feeder links plus service links in an
GMSC satellite link in relation to the Gateway (LES) station and the different MES
terminals. In any MSS network, the service links connect the MES terminals to the
satellite, whereas the feeder links are used to connect the land-based Gateway or
feeder link LES to the satellite. It takes two pairs of links to complete the full MSS
circuit, namely the forward link from LES out to the MES terminal, which com-
prises one feeder plus one service link as a pair of links and return from the MES
terminal back to the LES, which comprises one service plus one feeder link as a pair
of links. Quite often, the MSS networks utilize any of several FSS bands, generally
higher in RF than the service link allocations themselves to operate their feeder
links. For example, a particular MSS system could be designed to use segments of
any of the FSS allocations at 5/7, 11/12/14/15, or 19/29 GHz for feeder link

purposes. However, there are also particular FSS bands allocated by the ITU, which
are speciﬁed as being designated exclusively for use by certain MSS feeder link
operations.
7.1.1.2
Feeder Link Gateway Stations in Non-GEO GMSC Networks
Feeder link Gateway antennas for non-GEO satellites are generally smaller than
those used for GEO operation, because of the lower path losses to the satellites and
to allow for easier tracking ability. Feeder link frequencies normally used by
Big LEO systems are in the 5/7 GHz bands or 20/30 GHz bands. Frequencies in the
15 GHz band are also available.
The design and location of feeder link Gateway station is related to the non-GEO
satellite constellation characteristics. For example, LEO satellite constellation
having InterSatellite Link (ISL) to route trafﬁc between satellites would need fewer
Earth stations (Gateways) than otherwise required. However, systems using LEO
constellations will need more Earth stations than those using MEO constellations.
Furthermore, the location of any feeder link sites must take into consideration
the existing national or regional telecommunications infrastructure available.
Therefore, in the Iridium satellite system there are 2 Gateways serving 66 Big LEO
operational satellites. Trafﬁc is internally routed through ISL network to the only
operational Gateway in USA, and the call destination is routed to the public ter-
restrial networks worldwide.
In the Globalstar, there are 48 Big LEO operational satellites and up to 60
Gateway cites worldwide with trafﬁc routed directly through the public terrestrial
networks. However, the Orbcomm satellite system is containing 36 LEO satellites
and about 16–20 operational and few planned Gateway terminals worldwide with
trafﬁc routed directly through the public terrestrial networks. Thus, trafﬁc of LEO
constellations without ISL network is internally routed to the closest Gateway to the
call destination before being routed through the public terrestrial networks.
The new developed MEO satellite constellation in 2014 known as O3b Networks
for ﬁxed and mobile satellite communications already completed about 10 gateway
terminals and is planning to expand the total number of satellites from 12 to 20.
The number of tracking Gateway antenna installed at individual sites will vary
depending on the number of satellites being tracked, the number of antennas lining
up for the next satellites to become visible, and the number being used as spare.
Typically, the number of antennas installed at an individual non-GEO feeder link
site can vary from about 2–6. In addition to feeder link Earth stations, satellite
operations require Telemetry, Tracking, and Command (TT&C) centers in order to
track and control the satellite constellation. In fact, there are at least two such sites
in a given satellite system serving as primary and backup facilities. They are used to
provide command functions to satellites such as to perform orbit maneuvres, as well
as monitor the status of the satellite and subsystems.

7.2
Inmarsat GEO Users Segment
Inmarsat GMSC user terminals can be located onboard ships, land vehicles (road
and rail), and aircraft. As these mobiles can be in motion when the communications
are in progress, there are some extra considerations that need to be taken into
account in the design and installation of the terminals. The MES satellite antenna
should be mounted clear of any obstructions on the mobile so as not to reduce the
signal strength. Thus, if the antenna is directional, typically having a gain greater
than 6 dBi, then it will also need to include a mechanism to automatically track the
Inmarsat satellite. This may be accomplished by either mechanically rotating a ﬁxed
beam antenna, or the use of electronic steerable or switchable beams in the case of
phased-array antennas.
The MES terminal itself may be physically separated into two parts: an external
sealed unit comprising the radome which houses the antenna, RF front end, possible
antenna-tracking unit, and an internal unit normally located near the operator which
houses the other radio components. Usually, the low-noise ampliﬁers are usually
placed as close as possible to the diplexer so as to minimize the noise resulting from
losses in the feed guides.
7.2.1
Maritime Ship Earth Stations (SES)
The SES mobile terminals are shipborne satellite transceivers that have been
designed for installation and operation onboard seagoing vessels. For instance, an
example of such type of terminals are those forming a part of the Global Maritime
Distress and Safety System (GMDSS), which are designed for high availability and
other safety requirements. In this group of SES, terminals included Inmarsat mini-C
or C as a part of GMDSS, but long-range identiﬁcation and tracking (LRIT) system,
Fleet One, FleetBroadband, and newest Global Xpress can be also its part. Thus, the
LRIT installation is not a part of the GMDSS requirements either but its equipment,
particularly Inmarsat mini-C or C terminals, can also be used to support the system.
The Ship Security Alert System (SSAS) is used by ships to transmit a security
alert to a competent authority when the security of the ship is under threat or has
been compromised.
The International Maritime Organization (IMO) legislation states that the ship’s
security alert system shall be initiated by pressing a special dedicated SSAS button
on alarm panel and transmitting a ship-to-shore security alert to a competent
authority designated by the administration, which may include the shipping com-
pany, identifying the ship and its location and indicating that the security of the
ships is under threat or has been compromised. The SSAS is not part of the GMDSS
communication requirements, but its equipment can be used to support the system.
Ship security alerts can be sent using Inmarsat-C and mini-C, and relevant hardware
516
7
Users Segment

and software can be added to the existing GMDSS terminals to support the service.
Dedicated SSAS models are also available from MES manufacturers.
The GMSC system in a maritime environment has distinctive propagation
characteristics and operating requirements. Maritime communications are particu-
larly susceptible to multipath effects due to signal reﬂections from the structure of
the ship or sea environment. Thus, methods employed to counter this effect include
the use of modulation schemes that are tolerant to signal fading and intersymbol
dispersion, and the incorporation of a signiﬁcant fade margin, through the use of
dynamic power control in the satellite link design. The required fade margin can be
minimized by the use of data interleaving and forward error correction coding
schemes.
Maritime user terminals can be classiﬁed into three main types:
1. Those having ship low-gain antenna (LGA) of approximately 6 dBi as typiﬁed
by the Inmarsat Maritime-C terminals. In fact, these ship terminal types are
characterized by very compact SES having an unstabilized and unsteered
antenna subsystem, and they are very suitable for GMDSS solutions.
2. Those having ships with high-gain antenna (HGA) of approximately 15 dBi as
typiﬁed by the Inmarsat Maritime-B, Fleet 33/55/77, Fleet One, FleetBroadband,
and Global Xpress terminals. These terminal types would need to track Inmarsat
satellites in order to counter the roll, pitch, and yaw motion of the vessels on
which they are mounted. They must still be capable of correctly pointing to a
satellite even when operating under heavy sea conditions by the deployment of
special antenna-tracking devices.
3. Those having ship with medium- or intermediate-gain antenna (IGA) of
approximately 6–15 dBi as typiﬁed by the Inmarsat Maritime mini-M and M
terminals. These are scaled down versions of the high-gain antenna. A subset of
these terminals is designed to operate only within the spot beam coverage areas
of GEO satellites. These terminals typically use antennas that have wide
beamwidths in the elevation (vertical) plane so that they need only track the
satellite in the azimuth (horizontal) plane. Such terminals would be suitable for
installation on pleasure craft because they are smaller, cheaper, and simpler than
their fully stabilized counterparts.
In this section will be introduced only FleetBroadband and related solutions.
7.2.1.1
Maritime FleetBroadband (FB) SES
Above all is important to express that author of this book is inventor of this SES,
because he already wrote about in his ﬁrst edition of this book published by
Springer in 2005. In 2000, he introduced Broadband Maritime Communication
Service (BMCS) and submitted manuscript to Springer in 2003, while Inmarsat
promoted its FleetBroadband in 2007.
7.2
Inmarsat GEO Users Segment
517

The FleetBroadband SES terminal operates using the spot beam capabilities of
the previous Inmarsat-4 and new Inmarsat-5 generation satellites. Thus, three
satellites are deployed to provide global coverage located at positions 25° East,
143.5° East, and 98° West as shown in Fig. 7.3 and to connect ships to the ter-
restrial telecommunication network (TTN).
The use of spot beams enables Inmarsat to reuse spectrum across the coverage
area which, combined with the dynamic network management, enables Inmarsat to
optimize the use of satellite resources for all users connected to the network.
FleetBroadband Standard IP data are a variable bit-rate service provided on a shared
or contended channel and operating up to 432 Kb/s in each direction on a
best-effort basis. Inmarsat system manages this service by dynamically allocating
satellite resources to the Standard IP data service to ensure that all users experience
the best possible performance.
Factors taken into account in managing this service include the following:
Total volume of trafﬁc (and not just the activity in the channel); number of users in
the spot beam and overall number of users; the level of activity in other spot beams;
number of spare channels available and forecast use based on historical data;
average bandwidth currently experienced; and how long has this pattern of heavy
use been prevalent.
Thus, Inmarsat network is able to dynamically and transparently provide additional
satellite resources to vessels demanding more capacity and restore and reallocate
those resources when that demand has been satisﬁed.

standard can provide the following services:
1. Standard IT Data—The Standard IP data service provides up to 432 Kb/s
(maximum data rate will vary depending upon the type of terminal used) on a
contended, best-effort basis. There are no guarantees associated with this ser-
vice; thus, if the link is busy, with many active users, then the observed bit rate
will be lower than if the link is quiet with little trafﬁc. Standard IP is best suited
to most typical onboard applications such as Internet browsing, e-mail, File
Transfer Protocol (FTP), and also numerous maritime applications such as
electronic charts, weather updates, engine monitoring, and many more. This is
not Inmarsat Mobile Packet Data Service (MPDS), but new type of connection
that will be used most of the time and for most applications.
2. Streaming IP Data—The Streaming IP provides an on-demand, guaranteed
quality of service (QoS) connection at any one of 32, 64, 128, or 256 Kb/s. The
capacity is not offered to other users and effectively delivers reserved capacity
for a speciﬁc IP connection. It is available on demand and on a ﬁrst come, ﬁrst
served basis. Thus, if the channel requested is unavailable, a user can request
another channel with a lower bit rate. Streaming is very important for
time-critical data transmissions such as live video and audio but unoptimized

resource-intensive enterprise applications such as Oracle, SAP, and database
synchronization. However, further characteristics can be assigned to this stan-
dard, including error correction and application-speciﬁc routing instructions.
3. Circuit-switched Data—This data services are available from the moment the
terminal is registered to the network, and data connections can be initiated from
either the ship IP data uplink or the shore IP data downlink. The FleetBroadband
network supports mobile originated and terminated ISDN circuit-switched data
calls at 64 Kb/s. A user may run simultaneous ISDN and Standard IP sessions1
but not simultaneous ISDN and Streaming IP sessions. However, as with
Inmarsat Fleet ISDN, two terminals may be bonded together to deliver
128 Kb/s.
In
order
to
support
legacy
modem
and
facsimile
users,
FleetBroadband provides PCM-coded 3.1 kHz audio via a 64 Kb/s transparent
bearer. This service can be used to make and receive legacy modem, facsimile,
and speech calls requiring PCM coding to and from the terrestrial PSTN or
ISDN and also supports encrypted voice such as STU III. The 3.1 kHz audio
services are provided at the terminal typically via either an RJ-11 analogue
telephone connector or RJ-45 ISDN connector (where supported).
4. Voice and Messaging Services—FleetBroadband offers a direct-dial voice
service using compression technology (the AMBE+2 codec3) delivering voice
encoded at 4 Kb/s, which should not connect voice over IP (VoIP). This makes
efﬁcient use of satellite capacity while delivering good speech quality. It is
possible to make a circuit-switched voice call while simultaneously using
Standard and Streaming IP data services. It also provides a voicemail facility,
which is comparable with most cellular networks. A subscriber’s service proﬁle
can be provisioned so that call forwarding will divert calls to the voicemail
server whenever the subscriber is unable to receive incoming calls. Each sub-
scriber may receive a notiﬁcation via SMS that they have messages waiting for
them. In addition to the basic messaging service, subscribers can forward
messages to another number, record a message and distribute it to one or more
subscribers, and access their voice mail from any telephone, ﬁxed or mobile.
The FleetBroadband network incorporates an SMS (text) messaging application
with a full range of messaging features. The SMS message format follows the
standard 160-character structure, but it does not support concatenated SMS.

FleetBroadband Onboard Equipment
There are two terminal types deﬁned and type-approved for the FleetBroadband
service. They are referred to as Class 8 terminal deploying HGA and Class 9
terminal using LGA. The key difference between Class 8 and Class 9 is the antenna.

Users Segment

For each type of FleetBroadband terminal, Inmarsat deﬁnes the air interface at
the output of the terminal’s antenna; the mandatory features and service types for
each class of user terminal; and the performance requirements of the user terminal.
Manufacturers must meet all of these requirements in order to obtain type
approval for FleetBroadband SES. The deﬁnition of other onboard equipment
features such as physical connections, users interfaces, ﬁrewalling, and routing
control is determined by each manufacturer according to speciﬁc market-driven
needs. Thus, because of the possibility of different physical interfaces on terminals
from different manufacturers, users should pay particular attention to the installation
guidelines given in technical manuals.
The FleetBroadband SES provides most typical ofﬁce applications such as
e-email, Internet browsing, FTP, and numerous maritime applications. These
onboard vessel applications are electronic charts, weather warnings (WX), navi-
gation warnings (NX), and others, best suited to Standard IP combined with an
Internet-based last-mile implementation.
FleetBroadband is a ﬂexible and very versatile shipborne GMSC system capable
of providing a cost-effective platform for the wide range of devices and applications
that are to be found on a modern ship today. Its peripheral package is depicted in
Fig. 7.5, where ADE is above deck equipment (Antenna Unit); BDE is below deck
equipment (Satellite Transceiver); PoE HUB is Power over Ethernet, which inte-
grates the built-in Wireless Fidelity (Wi-ﬁ) router and private branch exchange
(PBX); Digital Enhanced Cordless Telecommunications (DECT); cabin telephone
unit (CTU); Secure Terminal Equipment (STE); Future Narrowband Digital
Terminal (FNBDT); High Assurance Internet Protocol Encryptor (HAIPE); mar-
itime safety information (MSI); communication, navigation, and surveillance
(CNS); and ship trafﬁc management (STM).
FleetBroadband terminal can connect the numbers of existing and optional
communications equipment and peripherals, such as handsets, such as analogue,
cordless, DECT, ISDN, and wireless Wi-ﬁnetwork; VoIP peripherals, such as USB
and Wi-ﬁphones; audio, such as conference systems; LAN and WAN devices, such
as routers, HUBs, switches, and wireless access points; IP/Network cameras, such
as remote surveillance; off-the-shelf video, such as Scotty-motion media,
Polycomm and Sony IP; and legacy ISDN devices.
Besides, nowadays, many onboard systems are data network-enabled and can be
connected to the onboard LAN. Such connectivity when used in conjunction with
FleetBroadband will permit remote monitoring of onboard systems such as water
ﬁltration systems; weather sensors; preventative/predictive maintenance, engine
telemetry sensors; refrigeration systems; and systems container loading/unloading
monitoring sensors.
The distress alarm panel, as illustrated in Fig. 7.5, is supplied with power
through the Ethernet interface using PoE (1), which is available in all the
FleetBroadband systems, or alternatively (2) from a DC supply (10.8–32 V DC).
The DC input is protected against reverse polarity. The alarm panel is used together
with a Sailor and other FleetBroadband system and an IP handset designated for
distress use. A push on the red FB distress button on the alarm panel initiates a

Maritime SES Terminal Equipment and Installation
FleetBroadband is a robust GMSC system that will provide reliable communica-
tions across the globe in all weather conditions. However, in order to get the best
performance out of the system, it is essential that the equipment, both ADE and
BDE, is correctly installed. A well thought out and designed installation will ensure
consistently high data throughputs and minimize, or even eliminate, outages due to
shadowing. This section provides guidance on all aspects of the installation of the
SES maritime broadband terminals of onboard ships together with some best
practice recommendations.
FleetBroadband and other maritime broadband systems that provide simultane-
ous voice, high-speed data (HSD), and video communication via satellite through
the mobile BGAN (Broadband Global Area Network) are very robust SES termi-
nals. Mounting process of this SES type requires very serious preinstallation
planning. The SES terminal equipment and conﬁguration installed on the vessel is
the responsibility of the customer, but it is expected that guidance will be provided
by the Inmarsat distribution partner or service provider.
Usually, the ship antenna (ADE) structure can be mounted on the compass deck
atop special antenna mast, while the transceiving equipment (BDE) with peripherals
can be ﬁxed in the navigation bridge or better in special radio station, whose
conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 7.7. The main elements of BDE are the following
units:
1. Cabin Interface Unit (CIU)—With build in PC or system processor, it controls
and monitors the whole system operations of the transceiver and direction of the
antenna and also performs different task of baseband signal conditions between
Fig. 7.6 ADE and BDE components—Courtesy of manual: by Furuno
7.2
Inmarsat GEO Users Segment
523

all obligation and optional BDE peripheral equipment (Tel, fax, Tlx, video, and
data) and baseband processor.
2. Baseband Processor—Simply performs baseband processing of all transmitting
and receiving audio, video, and PC/data signals. It comprises intermediate fre-
quency (IF) ampliﬁer, modems, and timing circuits for multiplexing up and
down signals. In this case, the synthesizer produces the highly stable frequencies
required for modulation and demodulation and for signal switching.
3. Interface Terminal—Connects navigation Gyro Compass and motion sensor
units with CIU device for satellite tracking and electronic control of ADE.
4. Modulator and Demodulator—Both represent the nucleus of any transceiver.
First modulates the baseband signal onto the IF carrier of transmitting signal,
and second demodulates the baseband signal from the IF carrier of the receiving
signal.
5. BDE Diplexer (DIP)—Enables direction of transmitting signals from modulator
to the ADE and receiving signals from ADE to the demodulator.
The ADE is mounted below the waterproof container or radome on the stabilized
platform. The following units compose the ADE assembly:

Users Segment

1. ADE Diplexers (DIP)—The ﬁrst diplexer passes all transmitting signals to the
up converter and from down converter to the demodulator. The second diplexer
guides transmitting signals from HPA to the SAU and from SAU to the LNA.
2. Up and Down Converters—The up converter accepts the modulated IF carrier
from modulator and translates it to the uplink transmitted RF via HPA, by
mixing with local oscillator (LO) frequency, while the down converter receives
the modulated RF carrier from the LNA and translates its downlink receiving RF
to the IF.
3. High-Power Ampliﬁer (HPA)—The HPA device provides ampliﬁcation of
transmitting signals by the traveling wave tube ampliﬁer (TWTA) and klystron
ampliﬁer. The second HPA enables higher gain and better efﬁciency than
TWTA but in smaller bandwidth of 2 %. The ampliﬁed uplink signal is going
via DIP to the SAU.
4. Low-Noise Ampliﬁer (LNA)—The LNA device provides initial ampliﬁer stage
of downlink signal coming from SAU via DIP without introducing much
additional temperature noise. In this sense, the two most commonly used LNA
products are new GaAs (gallium arsenide) FET (ﬁeld-effect transistor) and old
parametric ampliﬁers. Thus, the recently developed GaAs FET LNA enables
very low-noise temperatures and takes advantages of its stability, reliability, and
low cost.
5. Antenna Control Equipment (ACE)—This unit controls antenna stabilized
platform (Stabilizer) and tracking system. It maintains the antenna direction
toward the focus of satellite against any motion of the ship.
During SES installation, primary consideration should be given to onboard
computers, hardware, and operating system, such as Windows, MAC, and Linux,
including user applications and protocols, such as FTP, Internet Message Access
Protocol (IMAP), regional HUBs, LES or points of presence (POP), Simple Mail
Transfer Protocol (SMTP), Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP), Transmission
Control Protocol/IP (TCP/IP), or User Datagram Protocol (UDP), wiring, Ethernet,
and other network connectivities, appropriate optimizations of applications and
communications software, terminal installation, and in particular the location of the
antenna.
7.2.2.1
Shipborne Antenna Mounting System
Ideally, the antenna should be installed on the highest point of the vessel with a
clear view of the sky in all directions, and all possible steps should be taken to
achieve this objective. However, if it is not possible to mount the antenna with an
unrestricted view of the sky, then the antenna should be positioned so as to ensure
minimum shadowing from the vessel superstructure such as funnels and radar. Such
antenna positioning should take into account the typical shipping routes used by the
vessel and the azimuth and elevation required for communication under way with
the appropriate satellite.
7.2
Inmarsat GEO Users Segment
525

In circumstances when shadowing might occur, it is useful and good practice to
create a “shadow area” chart for use on the bridge showing at which azimuth
shadowing may occur for each of the Inmarsat satellites to be used. Thus, if
shadowing is a major problem, then consideration should be given to the instal-
lation of two antennas, one on either side of the ship superstructure, so operator can
select the antenna with the clearest view of the satellite.
The SES antennas are relatively large and heavy directional structure, which
comprises the mechanical assembly, control electronics and gyroscope, microwave
electronic package, and the antenna assembly (dish, array, or similar) and has
reduced considerably in both physical size and weight. The Maritime Mobile
Satellite Communications (MMSC) SES antenna is generally ﬁtted on the antenna
pedestal pointing forward as indicated by the forward arrow on the base of the
antenna.
However,
Land
Mobile
Satellite
Communications
(LMSC)
and
Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Communications (AMSC) antenna units more or less
are similar. This pedestal or a platform has two horizontally, stabilized axes
(X and Y), achieved by using a gyrostabilizer or sensors such as accelerometer or
gyrocompass units.
The stabilized platform provides a horizontal plane independent of mobile
motion such as roll or pitch. For example, all mobiles have some kind of motions,
but ship motion has seven components during navigation such as roll, pitch, yaw,
surge, sway, heave, and turn, which are shown in Fig. 7.8. Turn means a change in
ship heading, which is intentional motion, not caused by wave direction, and the
other six components are caused by wave motion. However, surge, sway, and heave
are caused by acceleration.
Two-Axis Mount System (E/a and Y/X)
An antenna mount is mechanically moving system that can maintain the antenna
beam in a ﬁxed direction. In MMSC systems, the mount must have a function to
point in any direction on the celestial hemisphere, because ships have to sail across
the heavy seas. It is well known that the mount of the two-axis antenna conﬁgu-
ration is the simplest mount providing such functions.

There
are
2
typical
mounts
of
the
axis
conﬁguration:
One
is
E/A
(elevation/azimuth) mount and the other is the Y/X mount. Simpliﬁed stick dia-
grams of both mounts are given in Fig. 7.9a and b, respectively. Thus, in the E/A
mount, a full steerable function can be obtained by choosing the rotation range of the
azimuth axis (a-axis) from 0–90o. In the Y/X mount, a full steerable function is
achieved by permitting the rotation angle from −90o to +90o to both the x- and y-axis.
In fact, this is the basic conﬁguration for the ship utility, so a special function
required for its antenna mount system is to compensate the ship motions due to
sailing and ocean waves, and to keep the antenna beam in nearly a ﬁxed direction in
space. In the case of the pointing and tracking under ship motions, the required
rotation angle range of each axis is from 0o to more than 360o for the a-axis, and
from −25o to +120o for the e-axis with respect to the deck level, assuming that the
operational elevation angle is de facto restricted above 5o. Otherwise, both mount
types have several disadvantages.
Three-Axis Mount System (E/a/X, E′/E/a, and X′/Y/X)
The three-axis mount system is considered to be a modiﬁed two-axis mount, which
has one additional axis. The three-axis mount of an E/A/X type, as shown in
Fig. 7.10a, is the E/A mount with one additional x-axis. The function of the x-axis
is to eliminate the rapid motion of the two-axis mount due to roll. However, in this
system, the possibility of gimbal lock for pitch is still left near the zenith, when the
e-axis is parallel to the x-axis. The three-axis mount of an E′/E/A type, as shown in
Fig. 7.10b, is the E/A mount with an additional cross-elevation axis, E. In the
mount system, the change of the azimuth angle is tracked by rotating the a-axis and
the change of the azimuth angle is tracked by a combined action of the E and E′
axes. Hence, the E and E′ axes allow movements in two directions at a right angle.

7.2
Inmarsat GEO Users Segment
527

With an approximate axial control, this mount is free from the gimbal lock problem
both near the zenith and near the horizon. The three-axis mount of an X′/Y/X type is
the two-axis Y/X mount system with the x′-axis on it to obviate the gimbal lock at
the horizon, as shown in Fig. 7.10c. When the satellite is near the horizon, the
x-axis takes out the rapid motion due to yaw and turn. In this sense, the x′-axis
rotates within ±120o, so the x′-axis can only eliminate the rapid motion within the
angular range. In general, this axis mount is rather more complex than that of the
four-axis mount because steering and stabilization interact with each other.
Four-Axis Mount (E/a/Y/X)
The stabilized platform is made by the x-/y-axis to take out roll and pitch, and a
two-axis mount of the E/A type is settled on the stabilized platform. This is the
four-axis mount conﬁguration, as shown in Fig. 7.9c. The tracking accuracy of this
mount is the best solution because the stabilization function is separated from the
steering function, and at any rate, four major components such as roll, pitch, azi-
muth, and elevation angle are controlled by its own axis, individually. The four-axis
mount has been adopted in many SES of the current Inmarsat-A and B standards.
7.2.2.2
Omnidirectional Shipborne Antenna Mounting
When installing MSA, it is necessary to ﬁnd a location on board ship that is as free
from obstruction as possible. Thus, it is also important to maintain a certain distance
from other communication antennas, especially radar installations. Normally, the
best place for the MSA would be above the radar scanning antennas or far away
from them. Otherwise, a minimum safe distance should be maintained to HF
antennas of 5 m, to the VHF antennas of 4 m, and to the magnetic compass of 3 m.
The omnidirectional antenna is designed to provide satellite coverage even when
the vessel has pitch and roll movement up to 15o. Thus, to maintain this coverage,
the antenna should be free from obstructions in the area down to 15o below the
Fig. 7.10 Three-axis mount system—Courtesy of handbook: by Fujimoto
528

Users Segment

horizon, as illustrated in Fig. 7.11 (Left). Since this may not be possible in the fore
and aft directions of the vessel, the clear area can be reduced to 5o below the
horizon in the fore and aft directions and 15o below the horizon in the port and
starboard directions. Otherwise, any compromise in this recommendation will
degrade performance. If an obstruction, such as a pole or a funnel, is unavoidable,
the distance to these objects should be large enough, so that the obstruction only
covers 3o. For instance, if the diameter of the obstructing object is 0.1 m, the safe
distance should be about 2 m, as shown in Fig. 7.11 (Right).
The safety levels for the Thrane & Thrane Capsat-C Antenna Unit and similar
Inmarsat-C aerials are based on the ANSI standard C95.1-1982. Namely, this
standard recommends that the maximum power density at 1.6 GHz exposed to
human beings should not exceed 5 mW/cm2. Therefore, at maximum radiation
output, the power from an Inmarsat-C antenna of 16 dBW EIRP corresponds to a
minimum safety distance of about 30 cm. The future standard from the European
Telecommunication Standard Institute (ETSI) concerning 1.5/1.6 GHz MES the
recommendation will be maximum 8 W/m2 (0.8 mW/cm2) with a minimum safety
distance of 62 cm at 16 dBW of EIRP.
7.2.2.3
Directional Shipborne Antenna Mounting and Steering System
The ship ADE unit consists antenna system mounted on a pedestal, RF, power, and
control units, all covered by an antenna radome. Ideally, antenna should have free
optical sight in all directions above an elevation angle of 5o. It must be placed as
high as possible in the best position and to avoid blind spots with degradation or
loss of the communications link.
The directional antenna has a beam width of 10o and ideally requires a free line
of sight in all directions above an elevation angle of 5o. Possible obstructions will
cause blind spots, with the result of degradation or even loss of the communications
link with the spacecraft. So, complete freedom from degradation of the propagation
is only accomplished by placing the antenna above the level of any possible
Fig. 7.11 Safe distance of Inmarsat-C antenna from obstructions—Courtesy of manual: by Sailor
7.2
Inmarsat GEO Users Segment
529

obstructions. This is normally not feasible and a compromise must be made to
reduce the amount of blind spots. The degree of degradation of the communication
depends on the size of the obstructions as seen from the antenna; hence, the dis-
tances to them must also be considered. However, it should be remembered that the
antenna RF beam of energy possesses a width of 12o angle cone and consequently,
objects within 10 m of the radome, which cause a shadowing sector greater than 6o,
are not likely to degrade the equipment signiﬁcantly. Preferably, all obstructions
within 3 m of the antenna system should be avoided. Obstructions less than 15 cm
in diameter can be ignored beyond this distance. Knowing the route that the ship
normally sails allows a preferable sector of free sight to be established, thus
facilitating the location of the antenna unit.
The antenna beam must be capable of being steered in the direction of any
Inmarsat GEO satellite, whose orbital inclination does not exceed 3o and whose
longitudinal excursions do not exceed ±0.5o. This must be provided to point the
antenna beam automatically toward the satellite with sufﬁcient accuracy to ensure
that the G/T and EIRP requirements, namely receive and transmit signal levels, are
satisﬁed continuously under operational conditions. Careful and important con-
sideration should be given to placing directional antenna in right place onboard
seagoing ships. In particular, the focal point of the directional antenna must be
pointing directly at the Inmarsat satellite being tracked without any interruption of
the microwave beam, which may be caused by any obstruction on the ship.
Inmarsat specify that there should be no onboard obstacle that is likely to
downgrade the performance of the equipment in any angle of azimuth down to an
elevation of −5o, which is not easy to achieve. At this point, the SES design and
Inmarsat installation guidelines give a theoretical antenna installation instruction
mode satisfying this advice but with the disadvantage that the antenna is very high
above the vessel’s deck and would be impossible to install in such a way (see
Fig. 7.12). This type of installation is not practical because a ship’s antenna would
certainly be adversely affected by strong, gusty wind and vibration and it would be
difﬁcult to gain access for maintenance purposes.
If ship’s structures do interrupt the antenna beam, blind sectors will be caused,
leading to degraded communications over some arc of azimuth travel. Otherwise, if

Users Segment

it is like that and as is often the case, it is impossible to ﬁnd a mounting position
free from all obstructions; the identiﬁed blind sectors should be recorded. It may be
possible for the operator, when in an area served by two satellites, to select the
satellite whose azimuth and elevation angles with respect to the ship’s position are
outside the blind sector. Obviously, this method is not enough practical because the
satellite overlapping sectors inside of Inmarsat’s four ocean regions cover relatively
small areas. The best solution to avoid all blind sectors is to place the antenna unit
on top of the radar mast or on a specially designed mast.
However, if antenna is placed in the same level of radar antennas, it is important
to take into consideration interferences that radar antenna may cause. Since radar
radiates a fan beam with a horizontal beam width of a few degrees and a vertical
beam width of up to ±15°, the worst interference can be avoided by mounting the
antenna at a different level, namely this meaning that the antenna is installed at
minimum 15° above or below the radar antenna, which scenario is as shown in
Fig. 7.13 (Left). Due to near-ﬁeld effects, the beneﬁt of this vertical separation
could be reduced at short distances below 10 m between radar antenna and the
Sailor FleetBroadband antenna. Thus, it is recommended to ensure as much vertical
separation as possible when this antenna has to be placed close to a radar antenna.
When FleetBroadband SES antenna cannot obtain full line of sight (LOS) to the
satellites because of blocking objects onboard ship, the new Sailor FleetBroadband
Dual Antenna solution keeps connection. It maintains full LOS to the satellites with
a combination of two Sailor 500 FleetBroadband SES antenna solutions installed in
parallel at different locations together with Dual Antenna Control Equipment
(DACE), as shown in Fig. 7.13 (Right), where 1 = ADE, 2 = master below deck
equipment (BDE), 3 = IP handset, 4 = PC or laptop, 5 = Dual Antenna Control
Equipment (ACE) and 6 = NMEA 0183 input.
7.2.2.4
Shipborne Antenna Tracking and Pointing System
The tracking system is another important function required of the antenna mount.
Thus, the primary requirement for SES tracking systems is to be economical,

7.2
Inmarsat GEO Users Segment
531

simple, and reliable. Tracking performance is a secondary requirement when an
antenna beam width is broad.
1. Manual Tracking—This is the simplest method, wherein an operator controls the
antenna beam to maximize the received signal level. At ﬁrst, the operator acquires
the signal and moves the antenna around one axis of the mount. If the signal level
increases, the operator continues to move the antenna in the same direction.
If the signal decreases, the operator reverses the direction and continues to move
antenna until the signal level is maximized. The same process is repeated around
the second axis, and the antenna is held in both axes when the received signal
level decreases. This method is suitable for LMSC units and especially for
portable and ﬂyaway communication terminals.
2. Step Tracking—Among various auto track systems, the step track system has
recently been recognized as a suitable tracking mode for SES because of its
simplicity for moderate tracking accuracy. The recent development of integrated
circuits and microprocessors has brought a remarkable cost reduction to the step
track system, whose principle is the same as that of the manual track. The only
difference is that an electric controller plays the role of an operator in the manual
track. The functional block diagram of the step tracking system is shown in
Fig. 7.14 (Left). Sample-hold circuits are used to hold the signal levels, which
are compared before and after the antenna has been moved by an angular step. If
the level increases, the antenna is moved in the same direction and vice versa; if
the level decreases, the direction will be reversed. In the other words, this
process will be carried out alternately between two axes, whose good accuracy
depends on the sensitivity of the comparators. As a result, the beam center is
maintained in the vicinity of the satellite direction. Wrong decisions on the
comparison of levels generally arise from the S/N ratio, and level changes due to
multipath fading and stabilization error.
3. Program Tracking—This tracking concept is based on the open-loop control
slaved to the automatic navigation equipment, such as a gyrocompass, GPS, the
Omega, and Loran-C systems. In program tracking, the antenna is steered to the
point of the calculated direction based on the navigation positional data. Since
the satellite direction changes because of roll, pitch, and turn, a function to
remove these rapid motions is required in the program track, whose block
diagram is shown in Fig. 4.14 (Right). The error of the navigation equipment is
Fig. 7.14 Block diagrams of step and program tracking—Courtesy of handbook: by Fujimoto
532
7
Users Segment

negligibly small for the program track system, while its error mainly depends on
the accuracy of sensors for roll, pitch, and turn, which is the stabilization error.
At this point, an adequate sensor for the antenna program track system is a
vertical gyro because it is hardly affected by the lateral acceleration. When the
stabilization requirement is lenient, a conventional level sensor, such as incli-
nometer, a pendulum, and a level, may be used with careful choice of the
sensor’s location. The controller calculates the direction of the satellite to
compensate for the ship’s motions, which is affected by all components.
The simpler the axis conﬁguration of the antenna mounts, the more complex the
program calculation procedure becomes. Since the program controller has to exe-
cute calculations of many trigonometric functions, a microprocessor is a candidate
for the controller. Thus, this program tracking is also applicable to the four-axis
mount. Combination with the step track system is desirable because the error of the
program track can be compensated by the step track and its rapid ship motion error
can be compensated by the program tracking system.
7.2.2.5
Antenna Mast and Stabilization Platform
The mast has to be designed to carry the weight of the antenna unit up to 300 kg,
depending on model design or manufacturer, which is depicted in Fig. 7.15 (Left).
It must also be able to withstand the forces imposed by severe winds up to 120
knots on the radome and strong vibrations due to very rough seas on the whole
ADE construction. The top end of the mast should be ﬁtted with a ﬂange with holes
matching the bolts extending from the bottom of the radome. The ﬂange must not
be so large as to interfere with the hatch in the bottom of the antenna unit. The holes
through the mast ﬂange must be positioned symmetrically around the ship’s lon-
gitudinal axis. If the height of the mast makes it necessary to climb up to the
antenna unit, a ladder must be provided on the mast column. A guardrail must be
attached to the upper section for safety purposes. If the height of the mast exceeds
approximately 4.5 m, an access platform should be attached to the mast about
1.5 m below the radome bottom.
The radome completely encloses the periphery of the base plate assembly to
protect the electronic and mechanical components from corrosion and weather. It is
usually fabricated from high-gloss ﬁberglass and is electronically transparent to RF
signals in the assigned frequency band. The radome is secured to the circular or
square antenna stand (base plate) with several screws and can be removed easily
without special tools.
The antenna-stabilized platform is housed inside the radome and consists in the
electrical and mechanical elements, which is depicted in Fig. 7.15 (Right). There
are two antenna control stepper motors. First, there is the azimuth step motor, which
controls the position of the antenna reﬂector in the horizontal A plane (azimuth),
and second, there is the elevation step motor that controls the vertical E plane
(elevation). Each motor has four phase inputs coming from the drive circuit in the
7.2
Inmarsat GEO Users Segment
533

BDE Control Board and a supply voltage from the master power supply located on
the antenna stand. As a stepper motor turns the antenna, it also adjusts the setting of
the relevant sensor potentiometer. The sensor voltage supply is the reference
voltage for the A/D converter on the Control Board.
Therefore, two stepper motors move the antenna in both azimuth and elevation
angles and move the relevant sensor potentiometers, which provide feedback
information on the position of the antenna. The stabilization system, or gyroscope
with two gyro motors, stabilizes the platform for the antenna against the roll and
pitch of the ship. A two-turn solenoid clamps the antenna platform to the gyroscope
assembly. A diplexer passes the Rx signal from the antenna to the LNA and the Tx
signal from the transceiver assembly to the antenna. The LNA ampliﬁes the Rx
signal, and the HPA ampliﬁes the Tx signal. The antenna, a parabolic dish, radiates
EM energy to and from the antenna feeder in Rx or Tx direction, respectively.
Finally, the antenna assembly is mounted below the radome for protection
purposes.
7.2.2.6
Antenna Location Aboard Ship
The ship’s antenna unit should be located at a distance of at least 4.5 m from the
magnetic steering compass. At this point, it is not recommended to locate the
antenna close to any interference sources or in such a position that sources such as
the radar antenna lie within the antenna’s beam width of 10o when it points at the
satellite. The ADE should also be separated as far as possible from the HF antenna

Users Segment

and preferably by at least 5 m from the antennas of other communications or
navigation equipment, such as the antenna of the satellite navigator or the VHF and
NAVTEX antennas. In addition, it is not practical to place the antenna behind the
funnel, as smoke deposits will eventually degrade antenna performance. Regardless
of the location chosen for the antenna, it should be oriented to point forward in
parallel with the ship’s longitudinal axis when in the middle of its azimuth range,
which will correspond to zero degrees on the azimuth indicator.
The EM RF signals are known to be hazardous to health at high radiation levels.
Thus, it is inadvisable to permit human beings to stand very close to the radome of
an SES when the system is communicating with a satellite at a low elevation angle.
In this case, Inmarsat recommends that the radiation levels in the vicinity of the
antenna should be measured. The crew members and passengers should not be
admitted to areas closer than 10 m away from the antenna unit at desk level above
2 m, measured beneath the lowest point of the radome, as shown in Fig. 7.16 (Left).
No restrictions, therefore, are required when the antenna radome is installed at least
2 m above the highest point accessible to crew and passengers. Hence, authorized
personnel should not remain close to the antenna system for periods exceeding 1 h
per day without switching off the RF transmitter.
However, radiation plan diagrams may be produced and located near the antenna
as a warning for crew members, passengers, and ship’s visitors, or distances from
the antenna may be physically labeled at the relevant place.
7.2.2.7
Satellite Determination and Antenna Azimuth Limit
An Inmarsat directional antennas must be capable of locating and continuously
tracking the GEO satellite available or selected for communication, namely if the
ship has in view only one satellite or if the ship is in an overlapping position,
respectively. Thus, Inmarsat-C has an omnidirectional antenna and does not need a
tracking system. Locating and tracking may be done automatically, as in the case of
an SES, or manually, as with a portable MES.

7.2
Inmarsat GEO Users Segment
535

In fact, it is common practice to believe that the GEO satellites are ﬁxed and that
once the link has been established, it will remain so as long as the mobile does not
move. However, ships or other mobiles are always moving during operational
management of voyages, and satellites are under the inﬂuence of a number of
variable astrophysical parameters, which cause it to move around its station by up
to several degrees.
Therefore, an ADE tracking system must counteract this by repositioning the
SES antenna at regular intervals and in case of need. At this point, the carrier signal
is monitored continuously, and if a reduction in its amplitude is detected, a
close-programmed search is initiated until the carrier strength is again at maximum.
No loss of signal occurs during this process, which is automatically initiated.
Obviously, the greatest antenna-tracking problem will arise when the SES is
moving at speed with respect to the satellite. An Inmarsat antenna may be moved
through any angle in azimuth and elevation as the vessel moves along its course. In
this case, it is essential that electronic control of the ship antenna is provided. In
practice, antenna control may be achieved by manual or simple electronic feedback
methods.
1. Manual Commands—When the radio operator has selected manual control,
elevation is commanded by up and down keys, whereas azimuth positioning is
controlled by clockwise and counterclockwise keys. A command would be used
when the relative positions of both the vessel and the satellite are known.
Azimuth (A) and elevation (E) angles can be derived and input to the equip-
ment, by using the two A and E charts of Inmarsat network coverage. Once the
ship antenna starts to detect a satellite signal, the operator display indicates
signal strength. Fine positioning can now be achieved by moving the antenna in
A and E in 1/6th degree increments until maximum ﬁeld strength is achieved.
2. Automatic Control—Once geostationary satellite lock has been achieved, the
system will automatically monitor signal strength and apply A/E corrections as
required in order to maintain this lock as the vessel changes course.
3. Automatic Search—An automatic antenna search routine commences 1.5 min
after switching on the equipment, or it may be initiated by the operator.
Therefore, the elevation motor is caused to search between 5o and 85o limits,
whereas the azimuth motor is stepped through 10o segments. If the assigned
common signaling channel signal is identiﬁed during this search, the step
tracking system takes over to switch the antenna above/below and to each side
of the signal location searching for maximum signal strength.
4. Gyroscopic Control—Lock is maintained irrespective of changes to the ves-
sel’s course by sensing signal changes in the ship’s gyro repeater circuitry.
Satellite signal strength is monitored, and if necessary, the A/E stepper motors
are commanded to search for maximum signal strength.
5. Antenna Rewind—The antenna in the ADE is provided on a central mast and is
coupled by various control and signal cables to a stationary stable platform.
Thus, if the antenna was permitted to rotate continuously in the same direction,
the feeder cables would eventually become so tightly wrapped around the
536
7
Users Segment

central support that either they would prevent the antenna from moving or they
would fracture. To prevent this happening, a sequence known as antenna rewind
is necessary, as is shown in Fig. 7.16 (right). In fact, an antenna unit has three
areas with rewind time of approximately 30s plus stabilizing time, giving a total
of about 1.5 min:
(1) Operational area is the antenna-rotating limit in the azimuth plane. In fact, the
antenna can rotate a total of 540o, which is shown as a white area in Fig. 7.17
(Left). Normally, the antenna will operate in the operational area, which is
between 60o and 480o.
(2) Rewind area is necessary for the following reasons: If the antenna moves into
one of the rewind areas, i.e., 10o–60o or 480o–530o (antenna azimuth lamp-
lights) and if no trafﬁc is in progress, the antenna will automatically rewind
360o to get into the operational area and still be pointed at the satellite, which
is illustrated as a dotted area in Fig. 7.17 (Right). For example, the ship
antenna moves from position 1 to position 2 and rewinds lamplights. If the
SES terminal is occupied with a call and the ship turns so that the antenna
enters the rewind area, no rewind will take place unless the antenna comes into
the azimuth limit area. Deﬁnitely, if this happens, rewind will take place and
the call will be lost. The azimuth-warning indicator on the operator display
will light to indicate that antenna rewinding is in progress.
(3) Azimuth limit area is an important factor because when the antenna is in this
area, the azimuth limits lamplights. If the antenna moves into the outer part of
the azimuth limit area, i.e., 0o–10o or 530o–540o, rewind will start automati-
cally, despite trafﬁc in progress.
7.2.2.8
Antenna Pointing and Tracking
The directional reﬂector antenna is highly directive and must be pointed accurately
at the satellite to achieve optimum receiving and transmitting conditions. In normal
operation, the antenna is kept pointed at the satellite by the auto-tracking system of,
Fig. 7.17 Antenna pointing—Courtesy of manual: by Ilcev
7.2
Inmarsat GEO Users Segment
537

for example, Saturn 3 SES. Before the auto-tracking can take over, the antenna
must be brought within a certain angle in relation to the satellite. Thus, this can be
obtained using the command “ﬁnd” or by manually setting the antenna using the
front push buttons on the terminal or via teleprinter command. For manual pointing,
it is necessary to provide the ship’s plotted position, ship’s heading by gyro, azi-
muth angle map, and elevation angle map of the satellite.
1. Ship’s Plotted Position—The plotted position is needed to decide which
satellite can be used, namely which Inmarsat network area can be tuned: Indian
Ocean
Region
(IOR),
Paciﬁc
Ocean
Region
(POR),
Atlantic
Ocean
Region-West (AORW), or Atlantic Ocean Region-East (AORE), depending on
the ship’s actual position, as shown in Fig. 7.17 (left). Sometimes, the ship can
be in an overlapping satellite area covered by two or even three Inmarsat
satellites. In this case, it will be important to choose convenient CES and to
point the antenna toward one of the overlapping ocean regions.
2. Ship’s Heading by Gyrocompass—The permanent heading of the ship
determined by gyrocompass is needed for the antenna auto-tracking system (see
Fig. 7.17) (right).
3. Azimuth Angle—The azimuth is the angle between north line and horizontal
satellite direction as seen from the ship, as is shown by example of 259o, in
Fig. 7.18 (Left). Thus, the actual azimuth angle for the various satellites due to
the ship’s plotted position can be found on the map, as shown in Fig. 2.5a.
4. Elevation Angle—The elevation angle is the satellite height above the horizon
as seen from the ship, as is shown by the example of 38o, in Fig. 7.18 (Right). In
this case, the actual elevation angle for the various satellites due to the ship’s
plotted position can be found on the map in Fig. 2.5b.

Land Mobile Earth Stations (MES)
In a land mobile environment, the communications link between the satellite and
mobile terminal is subject to impairments in the form of multipath effects arising
from signal scattering and reﬂections and shadowing effects arising from signal
blockage. This results in signal fading and phase variations in the carrier, the
magnitude of which depends on whether the terminal is stationary or moving, the
speed at which it is moving, and the environment between the terminal and the
satellite. It is possible to provide sufﬁcient link margin to compensate for fading or
to allow for some in-building penetration of the signal. However, it is not practical
in LMSC system to provide sufﬁcient margin to still allow communications when
the direct LOS of the link is blocked by buildings, heavy vegetation, and other
obstacles.
In vehicular applications, such as road and rail vehicles, the antenna is normally
placed on the roof and is typically of low or medium gain (less than 15 dBi). The
latter is normally either a low proﬁle motorized tracking antenna or a non-tracking
rod antenna about a meter in height, which has an omnidirectional coverage in
azimuth and ﬁxed coverage in elevation (coverage suitable for use in temperate
regions).
In this section will be described Inmarsat Broadband Global Area Network
(BGAN) for vehicular and transportable applications. At the end of 2005, Inmarsat
launched its BGAN service as the ﬁrst high-speed wireless data solutions with voice
and Internet available on a global basis. The BGAN service is accessed through
onboard vehicle or portable broadband satellite transceivers with antenna easy to
carry as a laptop computer. The BGAN network uses 3 GEO I-4 satellites and an
optimized ground network, which interconnects with variety of TTN links at local
BGAN users via LES terminal. The satellite coverage of BGAN network is the
same as FleetBroadband, as shown in Fig. 7.3.
The BGAN satellite network and terminals employ bandwidth efﬁcient modu-
lation and coding techniques, capable of supporting variable bit-rate quality of
service (QoS) and depending on the need of the applications. The BGAN provides a
near-global coverage overlay for TTN, giving users service availability beyond the
reach of IMT-2000 and Universal Mobile Telecommunications Service (UMTS)
standards. A range of supported terminals, personal devices, and transportable and
mobile units linked with entertainment, communications systems to remote base
stations including local area networks for civilian and military applications
including SCADA or M2M are discussed.
7.2.3.1
Land BGAN Transportable Earth Station (TES)
With the appropriate software and hardware, BGAN service supports all mobile
data and ISDN solutions up to 64 Kb/s and Internet Protocol (IP) up to 492 Kb/s
including secure encryption (STU III/STE) system important for corporate and
7.2
Inmarsat GEO Users Segment

military communications. It extends ﬁxed or mobile ofﬁce such as a LAN, Internet,
and ISDN/PSTN in remote areas using multimedia semi-ﬁxed transportable BGAN.
The BGAN system provides a range of IP and voice, data, and video
(VDV) transmissions covering almost all of the world land masses for civilian and
military satellite communications, VoIP, Internet, videoconference, e-solutions,
SCADA monitoring, and broadcasting in rural and remote environments.
The BGAN system offers few classes of solutions with large scale of service for
portable, such as mobile and semi-ﬁxed users via L-band I-4 GEO constellation and
LES ground segment to other users, mobile or semi-ﬁxed customers interfaced to
the TTN infrastructure. The new transportable Explorer 710 BGAN announced in
April 2013 provides on-demand streaming rates at 650 Kb/s out of the box, whose
conﬁguration with antenna is depicted in Fig. 7.19 (Left). This is the most powerful
Class 1 terminal that provides high-speed new streaming service, whose compo-
nents are shown in Fig. 7.19 (Right).
The BGAN Explorer 710 can be provided with BGAN network connected to
different peripheral equipment as shown in Fig. 7.20. This unit also includes several
advanced new features, including plug-and-play bonding, which can simply con-
nect two Explorer 710 terminals with an Ethernet cable and double the throughput
at speeds in excess of 1 Mb/s QoS. The new ﬂagship in the Explorer series
introduces smartphones to the world of BGAN units, enabling onboard mobile and
ﬁxed users to connect their own devices for voice calling and connectivity. Then,
other features include a USB host interface, hot-swappable batteries, an easy-to-use
LED display, and multiple interfaces to support a wide range of applications.
The white part of the Explorer 710, including the support bracket, is the
detachable antenna module, which comprises a GPS and a BGAN antenna, while
Bluetooth and wireless LAN antennas are integrated in the transceiver. It also
provides a compass to help positioning the antenna, which Class 1 Cobham
Explorer is shown in Fig. 7.21 (Left) and (Right).
The BGAN solution is a near-global Satellite Internet and Multimedia Network
with telephony deployed to connect onboard mobile or ﬁxed laptop or palmtop PC
to broadband Internet in remote locations, although as long as LOS to the satellite
exists, the terminal can be used anywhere. The value of BGAN terminals is that
unlike other satellite Internet services which requires bulky and heavy satellite

dishes to connect, a BGAN terminal is about the size of a laptop and thus can be
carried easily in the bag or vehicle.
Namely, BGAN is based on the Inmarsat Mobile Packet Data Service (MPDS)
IP packet technology, so users only pay for the amounts of data they send and
receive, and not for the amount of time spent online such as ISDN. So, this solution
enables all users to stay always connected and standby on the Internet Webpages
using a valid SIM card inserted in the BGAN Satellite IP Modem. Hence, this
prescribed SIM card may be activated and used in other GPRS mobile devices for
roaming between networks.
Other BGAN applications include File Transfer and File Transfer Protocol
(FTP) for downloading and sharing ﬁles from the Internet, Web e-commerce for
online ordering and procurement and providing secure end-to-end connectivity over

a corporate Virtual Private Network (VPN). Thus, if it is running as a secure and
shared 144 Kb/s rate channel, BGAN operates at more than twice the speed of
current ground GPRS (General Packet Radio Service) cellular phones.
There are other types of BGAN smaller terminals offering reduced service, such
as classes 2, 3, and 4. In Fig. 7.22 (Left) is shown LAN peripherals and service of
portable Explorer 300 BGAN designed by Cobham. In Fig. 7.22 (Right) are shown
the smallest two BGAN prototypes: BGAN A4 concept of briefcase modes (Above)
and NGAN A5 concept of pocket model (Below).
7.2.3.2
Land BGAN Road and Railway Vehicle Earth Stations (VES)
The VES for road and railway solutions is a series of L-band satellite terminals
utilizing the BGAN network from Inmarsat, such as an Explorer 727 depicted in
Fig. 7.23 (Left). Similar to the transportable BGAN, this terminal offers a broad-
band connection and voice service from anywhere in the world. Every terminal
features easy setup and operation. Simply connect a PC or phone and point the
terminal toward a satellite using the compass and sound indicator, and you are
instantly connected from anywhere in the world.
In Fig. 7.23 (Right) is shown mobile BGAN RF-7800B-VU104 of Harris suited
for commercial and military applications. This BGAN unit has similar technical
characteristics as an Explorer 710, which streaming speed rates for both devices
starting from 32 and reaching up to 492 Kb/s. In Fig. 7.24 is shown BGAN ground
segment and network.
The basic Explorer 710 system consists of antenna and IP handset with cradle.
The VES terminal, which contains the primary electronic parts, is designed for wall
or desktop installation. It supplies 23.0–30.0 V DC to the antenna through a single
coaxial cable. The DC input for the terminal uses both 24 and 12 V DC power
supply. The Explorer 727 antenna is a mechanical tracking antenna, consisting of a

two-axis stabilized antenna with RF unit, antenna control unit, and GPS antenna.
The antenna is dedicated to the Inmarsat BGAN system and is designed for roof
mounting on a vehicle. All communication between the antenna and terminal passes
through a single coaxial cable. The IP handset connects to the LAN interface of the
terminal and is power supplied with PoE through the LAN interface. The IP cradle
serves as a holder for the IP handset, power supplied from PoE and connected to the
handset with a coil cord and to the terminal with a standard LAN cable (Fig. 7.25).
7.2.3.3
Personal Earth Stations (PES)
Personal Earth stations can be divided into two categories, such as handheld Earth
stations and docking Earth stations. Handheld MSS terminals are similar in size and
appearance to normal terrestrial cellular phones. In fact, the terminals are commonly

dual-mode phones that have the capability of operating to either the satellite or
terrestrial mobile networks. When a call is placed, it is ﬁrst connected through the
local terrestrial mobile network. If, however, the terminal is outside the terrestrial
coverage area, the call is then routed through the mobile satellite network. This
method of operation allows MSS phones to complement the existing terrestrial
mobile infrastructure by providing a regional or global extension to its coverage
area. An important feature of these terminals is that they are assigned a single
telephone number, which is used for both satellite and terrestrial cellular call
reception. The terminals will generally require a direct LOS to the satellite. Other
than this, their usage will be similar to terrestrial cellular operation.
1. Handheld PES—Inmarsat developed few handheld phone terminals, which can
be used in urban, rural, and remote environments including onboard mobiles via
Inmarsat-4 coverage, as shown in Fig. 7.3. Here will be introduced two PES
units, such as IsatPhone Pro shown in Fig. 2.25 (Left) and IsatPhone 2 shown in
Fig. 2.25 (Right).
IsatPhone Pro offers satellite telephony with Bluetooth for handsfree use, voice
mail, text, and e-mail messaging. This phone is easy to use, which provides peace
of mind when you are many kilometers from anywhere, it has the longest battery
life with up to 100 h standby time, and GPS location data can be looked up or sent
in a text message. It is an essential part of any traveler’s kit; whether persons are
traveling for business or pleasure, it is small enough to have on hand for a call back
home to the family or for professional users in government, onboard mobiles,
media, aid, oil and gas, mining, and construction sectors.
IsatPhone 2 is the latest addition to Inmarsat handheld satellite phone portfolio,
offering a range of new features ensuring phone calls in any extreme and remote
locations. The robust handset can be used in any weather conditions and any

positions under Inmarsat-4 satellite coverage. The phone battery provides 8 h of
continuing talktime and up to 160 h on standby. This phone gives users excellent
voice clarity and call stability available on global basis over the three I-4 satellites,
which have an operational lifetime into the 2020s.
– Docking MES—Inmarsat was developed several docking phone terminals,
which can be installed onboard ships and road and rail vehicles via Inmarsat-4
satellite coverage. Here will be introduced two docking PES designed by beam,
such as IsatDock 2 Marine shown in Fig. 7.26 (Left) and IsatDock 2 Drive
shown in Fig. 7.26 (Right).
IsatDock 2 Marine is an intelligent docking station for the IsatPhone 2 that is
speciﬁcally designed for maritime applications. The marine dock supports voice
services via Bluetooth, RJ11/POTS for corded phones or PABX support, handsfree
speakerphone, or the privacy handset. The phone handset is completely enclosed in
the docking unit while still giving full access and functionality to the user. This
phone supports the assistance alert, personal alert, and tracking functionality of the
IsatPhone 2.
IsatDock 2 Drive is in-vehicle handsfree docking station, which provides a
high-quality semipermanent installation good suited for land and railway vehicular
applications for the Inmarsat IsatPhone 2. The docking voice station has in-built
echo canceling and full duplex technologies to provide superior voice quality and
professional handsfree or privacy calls.
7.2.4
Aeronautical Aircraft Earth Stations (AES)
Aircraft terminals, like the maritime terminals, also have high system requirements
in the performance, availability, and integrity of communications. Aspects speciﬁc
to aeronautical terminals include the need to cater for large Doppler shifts and

temperature variations, the need for ergonomic design of the external satellite
antenna subsystem components, so as to minimize atmospheric drag, and the need
for compact internal RF units that ﬁt into assigned spaces within the aircraft.
The terminals are likely to be much more integrated with other electronic
equipment present on the aircraft than is the case with land or maritime mobile
terminals. Additionally, a category of aeronautical terminals has recently become
available that is designed for public correspondence calls only, and they are not
certiﬁed for aeronautical safety applications or for use with air trafﬁc management
systems. Such terminals, typiﬁed by the Inmarsat mini-M service, are attractive for
use in light aircraft as they are compact, the purchase price is lower, and the
installation and certiﬁcation process is much reduced compared against safety
compliant terminals.
The AMSC terminals normally employ one of three types of antenna:
– Those having HGA with minimum gain of 12 dBi as typiﬁed by the Inmarsat
Aero-H/H+, Swift64, and SwiftBroadband. The antenna, being directional,
needs to track the satellite.
– Those having IGA as typiﬁed by the Inmarsat Aero-I service. Thus, these
antennas are designed to exploit the higher power of Inmarsat satellite spot
beams to receive Aero-H levels of service through smaller and cheaper
terminals.
– Those having LGA as typiﬁed by the Inmarsat Aero-C and L service. In fact,
these aero antennas are unsteered dipole or helix antenna having near omnidi-
rectional gain.
Some of stated aero Inmarsat standards have been or will be abandoned, so in the
following context will be explained new SwiftBroadband AES.
7.2.4.1
Aeronautical SwiftBroadband (SB) AES
In addition to the Maritime Broadband system, the author of this book in 2000
proposed aeronautical broadband solution as well. However, seven years later,
Inmarsat introduced both FleetBroadband and SwiftBroadband terminals.
Prior to this event, Inmarsat aeronautical services introduced solutions on the
second- and third-generation satellites, such as Aero-H, H+, I, L, Mini M Aero, and
Aero-C, which are being referred to as “Classic Services.” The ﬁrst aeronautical
service, Aero-H, was introduced in 1991 and has become the de facto standard of
cockpit data communication for many of the world’s airlines and private aircraft,
giving Inmarsat a reputation of reliability and longevity. With the addition of Swift
64, in 2002, the ﬁrst high-speed data service was added to the portfolio and has
since proven to be an extremely popular solution for business and military users
who need ISDN data connectivity.
Since its introduction, SwiftBroadband (SB) aero terminal has enhanced cockpit
and cabin applications through one installation utilizing single AES satellite
546

antennas. Inmarsat has established SB as the fastest growing aeronautical service
ever introduced. This terminal provides global voice and high-speed data
(HSD) service, simultaneously through a single SB installation onboard aircraft via
Inmarsat-4 satellite spot beam shown in Fig. 7.3.
Here will be introduced the Cobham Aviator 700D system engineered to take
advantage of the latest technologies of SwiftBroadband system for increased reli-
ability and connectivity. The SB background data and standard voice channel allow
users to access a shared data channel and a compressed high-quality voice channel
at the same time. The Aviator 700D is an Inmarsat Class 6 system that supports
circuit-switched standard voice, background IP up to 432 KB/s, Streaming IP at
8/16/32/64/128 Kb/s, SB X-Stream services, and ISDN service or 3.1 kHz audio.
The Aviator 700D brings onboard aircraft the following service: high-speed
Internet with data rate up to 432 Kb/s, FANS 1A ready (compliancy in certiﬁca-
tion), and VoIP connectivity,
• Low-cost voice, built-in PBX supporting numerous handsets, ISDN connec-
tivity, secure voice and data transmission, and Wi-ﬁcapable.
This upgrade from AERO HSD+To Aviator 700 level D will allow in cockpit
and cabin to get SB with cabin Wi-ﬁcapability by installing a satellite commu-
nication system that is Level D qualiﬁed as a regulatory requirement for FANS 1A
equipped aircraft. Installing communications equipment in a jet plane often means
giving up other options. Not so with the Aviator 700D, which is no more than 8
MCU altogether. It is perfect to replace older and heavier onboard systems, freeing
up space for additional payload or fuel savings.
The Aviator 700D installation also includes the following features: Interface
with existing CNX-200 Router (pre-requisite for Dassault SB), 1 (or more) dedi-
cated handsets wired directly to the SBU to use low-cost voice brought by SB
(optional), SAT-AFIS functions capable and is DLNA Type F ﬂutter installation by
Dassault Aviation Design Ofﬁce.

The Aviator 700ED SB system comprises the following main hardware:
1. Satellite Data Unit (SDU)—The SDU is the controlling unit of the satellite
system, which is shown in Fig. 7.28 (Left). A conﬁguration module (CM) and
all the interfaces, except for the maintenance port, are located on the rear of this
unit. This unit is seamless integration of Aero-H+ and Swift64 services into one
terminal. As a compact 3 microcontroller unit (MCU) size, it has low weight and
power consumption and is not requiring forced cooling. This terminal has
built-in CTU that connects up to six (standard or wireless) handsets including
two 2-wire (RJ-11/POTS) interfaces and no converter box required. It provides
features such as intercom, conference calling, and call forwarding and also
included ARINC 429 for IRS, built-in test equipment (BITE), attitude and
heading reference system (AHRS), ACARS, MCDU, CMU, AFIS, CPDF,
RS-232C port for portable data loader/conﬁguration management terminal
(PDL/CMT), detachable conﬁguration module (CM), and Ethernet, ISDN, and
RS422 connectivity. The dimension of this terminal is ARINC 404A 3/8 ATR
short, mass is 7.2 lbs (3.5 kg), and consumption power is 28 V DC, 30 W
typical, and 50 W maximum. The optimal environmental temperature is −25° to
+55 °C and at altitude mean sea level (MSL) to 55,000 ft.
2. High-Power Ampliﬁer (HPA)—The HPA device connects to the satellite
antenna and ampliﬁes the transmission signals of all channels simultaneously,
which is shown in Fig. 7.28 (Middle). It has a very small size (3 MCU), low
weight, and low power consumption; no external forced cooling is required and
installation outside pressure area. The mass of this unit is 11.2 lbs (5.1 kg); the
environmental temperature is −55° to +70 °C and can be used at altitude MSL to
55,000 ft. The HPA-7450 unit is a 2 MCU linear RF power ampliﬁer, which
ampliﬁes the transmit RF signal generated by the SDU to the required power
level to communicate with the satellite. Secondary functions of the HPA include
providing regulated +28 VDC power to the antenna via the SDU and monitoring
the diplexer and low noise ampliﬁer/built-in test equipment (DLNA/BITE). It
can support multichannel SB operation with HGA and IGA antennas. This unit
meets Inmarsat (3rd Order) intermodulation speciﬁcation of -38.7 dBc.
Status LED displays provide visual output of HPA and DLNA status. This unit
is qualiﬁed for installation in no pressurized and non-temperature-controlled
environments. The unit interfaces ARINC 600 Connector, while for RF input
and RF output is Threaded Neill–Concelman (TNC) Female.
The HPA unit provides Inmarsat type approvals of Class 6 B6CH01 and Class 7
B7CH01. It is important to say that airborne SB antenna systems have not built-in
HPA and LNA inside radome, while shipborne FB antennas have them integrated
within radome.
3. SwiftBroadband Unit (SBU)—The SBU device provides access to the
SwiftBroadband services, which is shown in Fig. 7.28 (Right). A conﬁguration
module (CM) and all the interfaces, except for the maintenance port, are located

Type F, ARINC-781, Inmarsat SB Diplexer, and DLNA, as shown in
Fig. 7.29a. The DAU-7070 DLNA separates transmit and receive signals and
ampliﬁes the received signal. It ensures that speciﬁed signals in the transmit
band from the HPA are transmitted to the antenna with minimal power leaks
into the receive band LNA. However, this SB unit also suppresses unwanted
harmonics generated in the HPA, providing protection against interference with
other systems. It is ARINC-781 compliant and is compatible with Aero-H/H+,
Swift64, and SwiftBroadband systems. It interfaces RF by the TNC Female, Tx
by the N-Type Female, and Rx by the TNC Female.
4. Satellite Data Unit (SDU) 7310—The SDU-7310 unit is ﬂange mount pack-
aged to do away with expensive and weighty ARINC 600 trays and connectors,
as well as increase installation conﬁguration options, which is shown in
Figs. 7.29b and 1.31.
The unit simultaneously supports a telephone channel and data connections
which speeds up to 200 Kb/s, offering affordable connectivity on any aircraft. The
SDU-7310 includes a router, which enables simultaneous connectivity to multiple
data users. This unit is ﬂange mounted to reduce installation cost as well as
increasing ﬂexibility, and it is suitable for installation outside pressure vessel. This
unit has built-in GPS Rx, internal calls between handsets, PPPoE Internet access,
and conﬁgurable Power over Ethernet on all ports. It interfaces 2× Ethernet
10BaseT User Ports, 2× POTS by two-wire phone interfaces (two handsets per
interface), and RS232 for remote monitoring and control.

ampliﬁer and diplexer–low noise ampliﬁer (HPA/DLNA) packaged into a sin-
gle, compact component, as shown in Fig. 7.29c. It forms part of a
SwiftBroadband single channel system and reduces overall boxcount, system
weight, and complexity. The system supports applications such as VPN, e-mail,
phone calls, and Internet browsing. The SwiftBroadband transceiver is a
packet-switched network that offers both streaming class (pay-perminute) ser-
vices and background class (payper-Mbyte) services. A single box that performs
2 functions and reduces system size, used with a single channel SDU, can be
used with a variety of HGA, IGA, and LGA (classes 6, 7, and 15). This unit can
be mounted in non-pressurized and non-temperature-controlled environment. It
uses full Inmarsat Tx and Rx band ﬁltering for use with SwiftBroadband and
interfaces antenna port by the TNC Female, Rx port by the TNC Female, and Tx
port by the N-Type Male. It provides Inmarsat approval type Class 6 single
channel B6CH01 and Class 7 single channel B7CH01. It can be used as optional
solution together with SDU-7260, instead of using main solution combined with
SDU-7330, HPA-7450, and DAU-7070.
6. Magnetic Sensor Unit (MSU) 7250—The MSU-7250 device is a stand-alone
three-axis magnetometer and three-axis accelerometer used to provide magnetic
heading information to a Satcom Reference Unit (SRU), (3-axis Magnetometer)
shown in Fig. 7.29d. This unit improves the magnetic accuracy of an SRU
device if the SRU cannot be mounted in a magnetically clean environment;
however, it can be mounted in non-pressurized and non-temperature-controlled
environment. The MSU is a sealed unit allowing mounting in extreme envi-
ronments such as the aircraft’s wingtip. However, this speciﬁc unit can also be

receive and to make calls, as shown in Fig. 7.30a. In an instruction manual of
Aviator 700, every pilot can see description how to use and to make a call with
the 2.4 GHz cordless handset.
2. Aviator Wireless Handset and Cradle—The Aviator Wireless Handset can be
used for making phone calls over an IP-based network, as shown in Fig. 7.30b.

Aeronautical AES Terminal Equipment
and Installation
The AES interfaces onboard communication and antenna systems, such as duplex
Tel, fax, data, and video equipment for aircraft, which standards meet the
requirements of the ICAO and industry standards such as ARINC characteristics
741 as well as Inmarsat standards. In fact, ARINC 741 standard describes one
physical implementation of the Inmarsat system, which characteristics 741 for AES
comprises Above Cockpit Units (ACU) or antenna dish and Below Cockpit Units
(BCU). The AES terminals are installed onboard aircraft as radio communication
and antenna sets capable of communicating via satellite with ground Earth stations
(GES) in the Inmarsat or other satellite operators via their satellite networks for
accessing terrestrial telecommunication networks (TTN).
Same as maritime FleetBroadband system, aeronautical SwiftBroadband is also
robust and important GMSC system that will provide reliable communications
across the globe in all weather conditions. However, in order to get the best per-
formance out of the system, it is essential that the equipment, both ACU and BCU,
is correctly installed. In the case of AES terminal equipment installation onboard
aircraft, there are not any obstacles atop fuselage or in tail to provide any sort of
shadowing. However, it will be very important during installation of airborne
antenna to be considered safe distance due to huge disturbances and outages from
radar antennas.

All stated aspects about shipborne antenna mounting system will be the same or
similar for aircraft antenna mounting system, such as two-axis mount system (E/A
and Y/X); three-axis mount system (E/A/X, E′/E/A, and X′/Y/X); four-axis mount
(E/A/Y/X); shipborne antenna tracking and pointing system; satellite determination
and antenna azimuth limit; and antenna pointing and tracking.
SwiftBroadband and other airborne broadband systems that provide simultane-
ous voice, high-speed data (HSD), and video communication via satellite through
the mobile BGAN (Broadband Global Area Network) are very robust AES ter-
minals. Thus, mounting process of this AES type requires very serious preinstal-
lation planning. The AES equipment and conﬁguration installed on the vessel is the
responsibility of the customer, but it is expected that guidance will be provided by
the Inmarsat distribution partner or service provider.
Usually, the aircraft antenna (ACU) can be mounted either on top or sides of the
aircraft fuselage and inside the pilot cabin (cockpit). For instance, in some cases of
wrong antenna installation can arise very serious problems caused by the blind
spots phenomenon. In this section will be shortly introduced the occurrence of blind
spots. However, the electronic elements of transceiver unit (BCU) with peripherals
can be ﬁxed inside the pilot cabin (cockpit), whose airborne conﬁguration is shown
in Fig. 7.31. The main elements of BDE are the following units:

1. Satellite Data Unit (SDU)—The SDU is the heart of the AES. It interfaces with
other onboard avionics including the aircraft navigation system (GPS, GNSS or
GLONASS, and new CNS) and performs most of the protocol, data-handling,
modulation/coding, and demodulation/decoding functions of the AES.
2. RF Unit (RFU)—The RFU converts IF inputs from the SDU into L-band RF
signals, which are sent to HPA for transmission. It also receives the L-band RF
signal from the satellite via the LNA, converts them to IF, and passes them to
the SDU.
3. High-Power Ampliﬁer (HPA)—It ampliﬁes the transmitted RF signal from the
RFU to the appropriate power level required to maintain only the air-to-ground
Mobile Satellite Communications (MSC) link.
4. Diplexer/Low-Noise Ampliﬁer (DIP/LNA) —Diplexer is providing separation
of Rx (receiver) and Tx (transmitter) signals, while LNA ampliﬁes the RF
signals received by the antenna to compensate for system signal losses and
forward them to the RFU.
5. Beam Steering Unit (BSU)—The BSU is also otherwise known as Antenna
Control Equipment (ACE) when used with a mechanically steered antenna
controls the pointing of the airborne antenna. Namely, it receives instructions
from the SDU on where to point the antenna beam. The instructions are con-
verted into steering commands, either electronic or electromechanical, to point
the antenna beam toward the desired satellite.
6. Satellite Antenna Unit (SAU)—The antenna as a part of ACU is the important
component, which is mounted to the exterior of the aircraft fuselage enabling the
system to transmit and receive RF signals to/from the satellite. In effect, there
are the following three kinds of antennas speciﬁed by gain performance for use
in the Inmarsat Aeronautical Mobile Satellite Communications (AMSC) sys-
tems: low-gain antenna (LGA), intermediate-gain antenna (IGA), and high-gain
antenna (HGA).
7.2.5.1
Satellite Determination and Mounting System
For installation satellite antenna on an aeroplane follow the following general
guidelines: always install antenna on top of fuselage as far away from obstructions
(tail section) as possible; install HPA/LNA pack as close to the antenna as possible
and AES transceiver in or near the cockpit (nose); and cross section of antenna has
to meet maximum 20º, as shown in Fig. 7.32 (Left). Regardless of the location
chosen for the antenna, it should be oriented to point forward in parallel with the
aircraft’s longitudinal axis when in the middle of its azimuth range, which will
correspond to zero degrees on the azimuth indicator. The EM RF signals are known
to be hazardous to health at high radiation levels, so it is recommended that
technicians in airport have to be on safety distance from radiating satellite antenna.
Antenna mount atop fuselage can be top mount HGA or port and starboard side
mount HGA system, as depicted in Fig. 7.32 (Middle).

Users Segment

Similar to shipborne antenna, when airborne HGA cannot obtain full LOS to the
satellites because of same blockage of the satellite signals or more important due to
low elevation angles as well, the new SF Dual Antenna solution can eliminate
appearance of blind spots. In such a way, it maintains full LOS to the satellites with
a combination of two Cobham Aviator HGA-7001 antenna solutions installed in
parallel at different port and starboard side locations together with Dual Antenna
Control Equipment (DACE), as is shown in Fig. 7.32 (Middle). In Fig. 7.32 (Right)
are presented three main mounting of airborne HGA, such as top, side, and tail
antenna mount.
7.2.5.2
Airborne Antenna Mounting and Motion System
The antenna gain is the fundamental parameter controlling antenna operation.
The HGA CMA-2102 aircraft antenna system of the Canadian Marconi Company
provides very good gain coverage, exceeding 12 dBi in 90 % and 9.5 dBi over
100 % of the Inmarsat system hemisphere, which extends from 5o upward over the
horizon in all level of ﬂight. Thus, this antenna provides very high-gain values of
14–17 dBi within 50 % of the hemisphere and has profound implications for the
economics of the end user.
With superior receive gain, less satellite power is required for nominal service
and more satellite channels can therefore be supported. High transmit gain improves
multichannel operation capabilities by ensuring robust operation and the continuity
of six-channel operation over a maximum coverage zone. The HGA CMA-2102
also exhibits good coverage below the Inmarsat hemisphere. Measured gain
exceeds 9 dBi when looking down to −3o in the roll plane, while trials conducted in
cooperation with Inmarsat veriﬁed that HGA has 10 dBi gains at 0o elevation and
can maintain a voice call to at least −2o.
AES Antenna Mounting
As stated above, the airborne antenna assembly can be mounted on top of the
aircraft or on the sides of the fuselage. Ideally, the best position for placing the
Fig. 7.32 Antenna cross section and mount solutions—Courtesy of manual: by Ilcev
7.2
Inmarsat GEO Users Segment
557

antenna is a location on the centerline of the aircraft coordinate system, as is
depicted in Fig. 7.33. In this case, the antenna assembly location should be moved
forward or aft along the centerline from the ideal position to maintain proper
separation from other antenna systems. All L-band antennas must be separated by at
least 50.8 cm, with 1.5 m preferred. The airborne satellite antenna should be
located at a distance of at least 5 m from GPS antenna and the magnetic steering
compass.
At this point, it is not recommended to locate the antenna close to any inter-
ference sources or in such a position that sources such as the radar antenna lie
within the antenna’s beam width of 10o when it points at the satellite. The antenna
should also be separated as far as possible from the HF antenna and preferably by at
least 5 m from the antennas of other communications or navigation equipment,
such as the antenna of the satellite navigator or the VHF and other related radio
antennas. The top mount provides satellite coverage independently of the direction
of aircraft travel.
Namely, the top view is 100 % clear, while front and side views have a very
small shadowing on the lower levels of the hemisphere. This heading-independent
antenna gain coverage is a very signiﬁcant advantage, which may, in the future,
become an important condition for all type of aircraft before being permitted to use
the optimal ﬂight paths made possible by satellite-based air trafﬁc management
(ATM).
On the other hand, typical side-mounted antennas have an inherent coverage
deﬁciency due to their limited scan range. Thus, nose and tail bearings and shallow
elevation angles to the satellite can reduce HGA gain values below 12 dBi,
sometimes all the way to zero.
Thus, these triangular areas, called blind spots or “keyholes”, occur in an air-
craft’s fore and aft directions, extending horizontally about 45o to each side at an
elevation angle to the GEO satellite of 5o and rising to a point about 45o above the

nose and tail, as shown in Fig. 7.34. Recent operational experience by a number of
airlines has conﬁrmed that the blind spots cause problems with satellite signal
reception, especially in certain areas of the world, such as the Paciﬁc Rim.
Actually, these blind spots of the signal reception are the frequent cause of
problems, including intermittent blackouts, dropped calls, and sometimes zero
communications, even when the aircraft is well within the Inmarsat satellite cov-
erage zone, particularly at high latitudes with low elevation angles. In any case,
these operational problems have been important factors in the switch from
side-mounted to top-mounted antenna system. Thus, side-mounted installations also
require two feeds from the HPA, as well as a high-power relay, adding to system
losses.
The top-mounted antenna can typically be installed with up to 1 dB less loss
than permitted in ARINC-741, resulting in better communications and greater
channel availability. Hence, Table 7.1 compares the top-mounted with a typical
side-mounted antenna design.
Therefore, as shown in Fig. 7.34, the top view of a side-mounted airborne
antenna is reduced in the nose and tail with shadowing of about 12 % in total, while
both front and side views have shadowing spots of about 15 % each.
Components of Aircraft Motion
The GMSC antenna system is generally mounted on a stabilized platform, which
has two horizontally stabilized axes (X and Y), achieved by using a gyrostabilizer
or sensors, such as accelerometers or gyrocompasses. The stabilized platform
provides a horizontal plane independently of mobile motion, such as roll or pitch.

For example, all mobiles have some kind of motion components during trav-
eling, such as roll, pitch, yaw, surge, sway, heave, and turn, as shown in Fig. 7.35.
Turn means a change in the aircraft’s heading, which is intentional motion, not
caused by wave motion, and the other six components are caused by wave motion.
Surge, sway, and heave are also caused by acceleration.
7.2.5.3
Performance at High Latitudes and Low Elevation Angles
The MSC performance can be limited at high latitudes and low elevation angles,
regardless of which HGA is used. For a GEO satellite orbiting at an altitude of
about 35.786 km, the highest latitude that can be viewed is 81o 18′, corresponding
to an elevation angle of 0o. For aircraft ﬂying above this latitude, the satellite is
below the horizon and unavailable for communications.
Hence, when the aircraft’s longitude differs from that of the satellite, the max-
imum latitude is even less; at longitudes that are midway between two satellites, it
can be as low as 71o. Even before the 0o elevation angle is reached, MSC signals
suffer from several sources of increased loss at low elevation angles. These factors
combine to reduce the number of available voice channels at 5o elevation compared
to 20o elevation angle. High gain below the horizon can actually degrade an HGA’s
low-elevation performance because it increases the interference from signals
reﬂected from the ground. Thus, side-mounted antennas can meet these limits only
over uneven ground or rough seas, where multipath signals are diffused. At low
elevation angles, the multipath rejection of HGA is further enhanced by its
top-mounted design, since the antenna’s predominantly vertical polarization ellipse
helps to cancel out the effects of multipath reﬂections, mostly horizontally
polarized.

The major source of antenna noise results from HGA “looking” at portions of the
terrain, which are “hotter” than the sky. In any event, the top-mounted antennas
controlled gain roll-off below the horizon, at all azimuth angles, giving much lower
noise characteristics than side-mounted antennas, especially at low satellite eleva-
tion angles. In reality, the noise of this antenna is almost independent of elevation
angle, whereas patterns of side-mounted antenna vary widely around the horizon.
At low elevation angles, it is critical that MSA can seamlessly transfer to the
next satellite as soon as it has a higher elevation angle. The algorithm normally used
to determine when handover should occur assumes that the satellite with the highest
elevation angle is the optimal one but this is not necessarily true of side-mounted
antennas, since the higher satellite may be in a blind spot fore or aft of the aircraft.
This can cause delays in satellite selection and could lead to a temporary com-
munications blackout. The HGA top-mounted unit has no blind spots and performs
better than side-mounted during satellite handover.
7.2.5.4
Beam Steering Performances
Steering of the HGA is controlled by the Beam Steering Unit (BSU), which
transmits steering commands to the HGA over an asynchronous EIA-RS-422A
serial data link. The HGA interprets the steering command and steers the antenna
beam to the desired position. Thus, the BSU translates antenna beam position data
and beam change commands received from the SDU terminal in a standard digital
format into signals needed to select phasing of the antenna elements that result in
the antenna beam pointing at the desired satellite. The BSU is housed in an
ARINC-600 rack-mounted 2-MCU package.
During subsystem operation, open-loop steering words and control words are
received from the SDU. The steering words contain azimuth and elevation infor-
mation for the direction in which the beam will be steered, using the coordinate
system, which is shown in Fig. 7.36. In the proper manner, after receiving an
open-loop steering word, the BSU calculates the beam number (one of more than
1000) and associated phase-shifter settings, which are then up linked to the HGA at
a maximum rate of 20 Hz, via an RS-422A serial data links. However, should the
rate of transmission of the open-loop steering words exceeds 20 Hz, the BSU
buffers the incoming words unit it has uplinked and strobes in the phase-shifter
settings for current azimuth/elevation value. If multiple steering words have been
received during the processing time, only the most recent value is retained. Control
words will be processed as they are received. Another function of the BSU includes
reporting of the selected antenna beam and gain to the SDU.
Moreover, BSU’s operational software meets the requirements of Level 2 Flight
Essential category. In addition to operating software, the BSU terminal contains
diagnostic software to assist ground maintenance personnel in fault isolation. The
diagnostic software is capable of identifying faults to a more detailed level than
required by ARINC 741.

Inmarsat Global Xpress (GX) Solutions
The concept of Global Xpress (GX) achieved in December 2015 as a new gener-
ation of Inmarsat-5 mobile broadband at Ka-band gives as follows: worldwide
coverage via three satellites; much higher QoS and ﬂexible bandwidth purchase
models; major leaps forward as global system capacity is 20× Inmarsat-4 genera-
tion with throughput up to 50 Mb/s at forward link and 5 Mb/s in return link to a
60 cm antenna dish; independent from L-band constellation, but integrated as a
service L-band to remain a major component of Inmarsat services; deployed for
lower bandwidth and/or highly portable MSC (BGAN, GSPS, Inmarsat-C, SLDR,
M2M, safety services); overlays Ka-band network to ensure high availability,
continuity,
and
safety
services
for
SwiftBroadband
and

Maritime XpressLink (XLink) System
Maritime XpressLink (XLink) system that connecting ship navigation bridges is the
ﬁrst project of GlobalXpress (GX) developed by Inmarsat; however, in the mean-
time, Inmarsat was designed GX for land and aeronautical applications. XpressL
offers the maritime industry a compelling combination of high-speed broadband for
a ﬁxed monthly fee. It integrates the Inmarsat FleetBroadband with VSAT service
to provide maritime users with increased performance and ﬂexibility of unlimited
data.
In Fig. 7.38 is shown network diagram of Intellian GX60 maritime XLink with
antenna (ACU), integral core module (BCU), network and peripheral connection,
Rx connection to BCU, Tx connection to ACU, and power supply lines for ACU
and BCU from ship power generator. Initially, access of XLink was always
available as IP data at up to 768 Kb/s and with a committed information rate
(CIR) of 192 Kb/s since 2014 XLink became available for customers to receive
double-bandwidth speeds with rates of up to 50 Mb/s.
Intellian GX60 contains a 65-cm Ka-band maritime stabilized antenna
(ACU) and core module (BCU), which provides maritime broadband service via
Inmarsat-5 satellite constellation. The GX60 HGA, efﬁcient carbon ﬁber antenna
reﬂector, and frequency-tuned radome ensure reliable and quality service for ocean
going ships. In addition, the GX60 antenna supports a low elevation angle (−20°)
capability to guarantee reliable connection at extremely high latitudes.

The GX60 SES terminal provides a newly developed graphic-based antenna
remote control program with an additional Software Development Kit (SDK),
allowing the NOC or land service center to integrate satellite antenna monitoring
and control into its existing network management systems in an easier,
user-friendly, and convenient manner. The GX60 ACU includes the integral XLink
core module and a Wi-ﬁsystem for wireless monitoring and control of the system
onboard the vessels. Besides, the GX60 comes with a 5 W BUC and a Ka-band
LNB conﬁgured for circular polarized signals.
Frequency-tuned radome ensures efﬁcient operations for Ka-band Inmarsat
XLink and supports auto satellite and beam switching for seamless continuous
coverage. The signal loss of the radome itself is minimized and the performance
maximized with an optimized radome design that enhances the Ka-band system
performance. Intellian’s new generation gyro-free satellite search function enables
the GX60 to acquire and lock onto the satellite without requiring a separate input
from the ship’s gyrocompass. The GX60 also supports auto satellite and beam
switching for seamless continuous coverage.

Iridium Maritime SES
Iridium maritime satellite network includes several types of GMSC terminals
similar to the Inmarsat and other MSC systems. Because the oceangoing ships are
not sailing in polar regions, so to them is sufﬁcient only Inmarsat service. On the
other hand, since the airplanes are ﬂying over the North Pole, they may use Iridium
service only, because HF radio is not enough reliable and Inmarsat is not covering
beyond the 80o of Latitude.

Iridium Aeronautical AES
Iridium aeronautical satellite network is very important service that is providing
global coverage including both poles, which regions are not covered by Inmarsat.
Here will be introduced two Iridium AES, such as ICG Sora and SkyConnect. The
newest Iridium Aero OpenPort with other solutions will be introduced in Volume 2
of this book.
7.3.2.1
Iridium-Integrated Aeronautical ICG Sora IG+Terminal
The Iridium Aero solution provides communication and safety service via
three-channel system integrated with peripherals and Inmarsat IGA SwiftBroadband
antenna. It is packed with features that are important to conducting business on the
ﬂy. The ICG NxtLink ICS 220A is three-transceiver Iridium device that combines
two channels of global voice and a dedicated cockpit datalink channel via a third
short burst data (SBD) channel.
The ICG integrated airborne unit as shown in Fig. 7.42 is designed speciﬁcally

5. Cobham IGA-5001—This is smallest intermediate-gain antenna (IGA) on the
market today that delivers full SwiftBroadband capabilities. It is considered to
be one of the optimum antenna solutions for Inmarsat’s SwiftBroadband Class 7
service offering.
An additional voice/data transceiver is available for cabin crew and passenger
services, credit card clearing, and providing communications in case of medical
emergencies. This aircraft terminal permits connections of conventional telephony
devices through either standard 2-wire “Tip and Ring” circuits or 4-wire audio
connections and Digital European Cordless Communication (DECT) units. In such
a way, telecommunication features include intercom calling, call transfer, confer-
encing, and follow-on dialing.
This device connects to standard aircraft systems via 4-wire audio for ﬂight deck
voice and ARINC 429 circuits for multipurpose control display unit (MCDU)
dialing or datalink messaging exchanges. It has external SIM card readers making
them a true LRU, and various types of handsets including cordless can be connected

The MMU-II device is a computer-controlled dialer and is very ﬂexible opera-
tion. It communicates with the transceiver over an RS-232 port and can be pro-
grammed in the aircraft with new message sets, or software. It has a four
step-dimming feature to the display. The MMU makes it a breeze to send standard
company-speciﬁc messages, such as number of passengers, current fuel load,
patient status, estimated time of arrival (ETA), and more. There are two tactical
dialers, a 6-position and an 11-position. The 11-position unit dialer has a backlit
faceplate and the dimming feature to the panel lights, and the annunciators can be
separate or together.

Maritime O3B MEO Users Segment
The medium Earth orbit (MEO) satellite constellation is developed in 2014 known
as O3b Networks to provide GMSC service for ﬁxed and mobile satellite com-
munications users. The name O3B satellite system refers to the “Other 3 Billion”
and is primarily intended as a backhaul service for terrestrial cellular phones in
remote countries that do not have a wire line infrastructure. They will also be
serving existing, high-end, and maritime markets such as the cruise and merchant
shipping industry.

Users Segment

The constellation of 12–20 satellites will be in a circular MEO satellite con-
stellation at a distance of about 8,063 km from the Earth surface. Each MEO
satellite will have 12 fully steerable Ka-band spacecraft antennas of which 2
will target the terrestrial LES (Gateways) and 10 will target the coverage areas.
Each beam will have a throughput capacity of 600 Mb/s in each direction. The
beam footprints will have a diameter of about 600 km on the Earth’s surface
between 45oN and 45oS and will be dynamically steered as the satellite moves
around the Earth, to cover the required service areas and skip over the unpopulated
or non-contracted areas. Eight MEO satellites will be spaced 45o apart, orbiting
around the equator, in a non-inclined orbit.
In Fig. 7.44 (Left) is depicted space segment of O3b containing minimum 8
spacecraft in MEO constellation at 8,062 km altitude, while in Fig. 7.44 (Right) is
illustrated O3b ground segment with O3b LES (Gateway) antenna system. Building
a next-generation O3b satellite constellation will be capable of offering to user
better, faster, reliable, and more affordable connectivity.
Initial constellation of eight MEO satellites is revolving around the Earth, about
4 times per day providing continuous service coverage, namely when one satellite
leaves, another satellite takes over without transmission interruption. Besides, its
Ka-band beams of 700 km diameter are steerable around the globe, each delivering
scalable options from 100 Mb/s up to 1.2 Gb/s.
Each beam is connected to a high-throughput teleport providing reliable and
high-speed Internet at a competitive price, which high speed is 4× faster than GEO
satellites. Low-latency roundtrip latency is between 120 and 150 ms (depending on
latitude and environmental conditions): faster interactivity and superior voice
transmission quality with lower cost up to 30 % cheaper than GEO service.
Flexibility steerable beams can be placed anywhere 45° north/south of the equator.

Due to the much lower orbit, the latency of MEO satellite will be in the region of
130 ms, round trip, as opposed to about 720 ms for geostationary satellites. In fact,
it will be a big improvement for phone calls and data ﬂow rather than allowing
GEO satellite constellation. The beams will target speciﬁc areas under contract, and
in the case of maritime installations, the beams can actually follow the movement
of the ship to optimize coverage. The ship will require two tracking antennas, each
tracking a different satellite, and switching from one to the other as the satellites rise
and set.
As a trial, O3B Networks have been awarded a contract by Royal Caribbean
Cruise Lines to provide high-speed broadband service to their Oasis of the Seas,
which is the world’s largest cruise ship carrying 8000 passengers and crew. Two
stabilized antennas, installed onboard the ship by Harris Caprock, will track each
visible satellite and allow seamless handovers, as one satellite is setting and another
rising. The satellite beams will also track the ship, keeping the ship centered in the
beam, as it moves around the Caribbean. The system will use a ViaSat high-speed
modem. There will be a third, hot standby antenna and modem onboard for
redundancy. The low-latency and high-speed throughput will be vastly superior to
the geostationary satellites used today.
In Fig. 7.45 is illustrated O3b Ka-band stabilized SES terminal with two 1.0 or
1.8 m shipborne stabilized tracking antennas and ViaSat high-speed modem, where
term IFL is interfacility link and Xcvr is transceiver (Fig. 7.46). The O3b SES

The O3b satellite terminal is designed for seamless handover at end of pass and
in case of blockage. Thus, 3rd hot standby satellite antenna for redundancy is
included (for OrBand300), so a dedicated dual system selector provides instanta-
neous hot swap with a third redundant system.
The O3b MEO satellite system for maritime applications provides a real-time
ship track monitoring via O3b Customer Portal. O3b satellite beams will follow
ship tracks on ship’s normal route, where cruise operator provides O3b with normal
ship course. Then, beam tracking updates in real time if the ship has to change
course, where O3b will maintain ship within beam center and ship provides latitude
and longitude updates on 2 h intervals via in-band or out-of-band channel.
The satellite terminal O3b for maritime applications provides high-capacity
throughput and delivery data rates up to 500 Mb/s, serves more users on ship at
substantially higher data rates, and ofﬂoads business processes from ships to shore
data centers and round trip latency between 120 and 150 ms, which is depending on
latitude and environmental conditions, as shown in Fig. 7.46

Mobile DVB-RCS GEO Users Segment
Since 2005, many satellite operators worldwide initiated to provide mobile service

S/S2 standards, whose conﬁguration is shown in Fig. 3.30. The GEO satellite
operators are Intelsat, Eutelsat, SES-NewSkies, PanAmSat, and other, with regional
or global and spot beam coverage. The space segment conﬁguration may consist of
minimum three broadcast GEO satellites, while the ground segment infrastructure
may have mission center to control the network, control center to manage space-
craft, and several LES terminals. Thus, the user segment is represented by FES and

As discussed in Chap. 3, in 2000, author of this book designed and proposed
DVB-RCS mobile network for all mobile applications. Almost 5 years later, some
satellite operators and manufacturers proposed their DVB solutions, in particular for
maritime applications. Afterward, at the beginning of 2005, the ﬁrst ﬁtted out ship
with DVB-RCS Nera SatLink Marine system was luxurious supper Motor Yacht
M/Y Lady Marina. The Norwegian company Nera developed its ﬁrst DVB-RCS
VSAT for maritime applications for use with telephony, ﬁle transfer, radio, daily
news delivery, and broadcast services.
In this section will be introduced just maritime and aeronautical DVB-RCS
standards, while in Volume 2 will be introduced complete chapter about global
broadcasting satellite system for all mobile applications.
7.5.1
DVB-RCS Architecture for Maritime Broadband
The solid maritime market demands robust, secure, and ubiquitous broadband
connectivity delivered by terrestrial networks. Intelsat has developed global
mobility solutions that rival the performance and reliability of land-based VSAT
networks. The IntelsatONE Mobility Solutions via C- and Ku-band provide con-
stant, modern, and reliable high-speed IP access for converged voice, data, and
Internet applications on one anytime and anywhere platform.
1. Global Intelsat C-band Coverage—The Intelsat global C-band Coverage
contains three GEO satellites for VSAT service: IS-701, IS-107, and IS-906 in
tree ocean beam areas and four LES terminals, which network is shown in

The broadband maritime platform is IntelsatONE NBB (iDirect) C-band cov-
erage, similar to the current Inmarsat-4 coverages, until 75º north and 75º south,
which SeaTel 9707D VSAT is shown in Fig. 7.49a. Its beneﬁts are as follows:
Global C-band broadband access not affected by rain fade; automatic beam
switching (ABS); data rates from 128 Kb/s to 4.096 Mb/s; cost-effective solution
with predictable ﬁxed monthly service charges per vessel; guaranteed committed
information rate (CIR) values with variable max burst rates per vessel; bandwidth
lease solutions with data rates over 60 Mb/s; and iDirect-based IntelsatONE plat-
form. This system deploys iDirect VSAT Hub transceiver conﬁgurations with
Intelsat terrestrial ABS infrastructure, which eliminates at all the need for human
intervention as a vessel traverses between satellite beam coverage areas. The
Intelsat single platform is always-on broadband access, which supports all con-
verged VDV and Internet applications with global IP address with Multiprotocol
Label Switching (MPLS).
2. Global Intelsat Ku-band Coverage—This solution is employing GEO six
satellites and nine wide beams providing Ku-band coverage with IntelsatONE
NBB (iDirect), which global coverage is shown in Fig. 7.48. The Above Deck
Equipment (ADE) or antenna is shown in Fig. 7.49b. The Below Deck
Equipment (BDE) Sailor 900 Maritime VSAT is shown in Fig. 7.49c, which

The beneﬁts of this system are as follows: Broadband access from single
onboard platform at Ku-band shipping route coverage; automatic beam switching
with data rates up to 50 Mb/s; antenna is smaller than for C-band and is about
60 cm; robust solution to address the challenges of the global maritime environ-
ment, covering VDV and Internet access with global IP/MPLS address; and manage
backbone network which links all of Intelsat GES teleports. It is used to provide
ocean vessels with a single IP address, which is maintained even when the vessel
switches between beams that are uplinked from different teleports, when a special
application session is maintained as the vessel crosses from one beam’s coverage to
another. The biggest problem of K-band is very high negative effects of fade rain on
the propagation, so for that reason is possible to switch to Ka-band. The ocean
vessel in navigation during very bad weather needs very reliable communication
faculties. Thus, this problem can be solved with combination of usage different
solutions onboard ships, such as Inmarsat, Iridium, or any C/L-band solutions.
In Fig. 7.50 is illustrated shipborne DVB-RCS VSAT conﬁguration, which
contains the following main components: antenna structure or ADE and BDE or

Broadband Service for all mobile applications, which in particular may help keep
aircraft connected in the sky and on the ground, whose satellite coverage and ﬂight
lines are shown in Fig. 7.51.
This affordable, two-way broadband VDV communications service delivers new
network performance on par with typical cable modem and DSL technology found
in navy ofﬁce or home, so the business jet literally becomes the ofﬁce-in-the-sky
offering: Place and receive cell phone calls just as you would on the ground; browse
the Internet and Web or send and receive e-mail in real time; access certain com-
pany’s network through a secure VPN; to cell phones, laptop, PDA, tablet com-
puters, and other enabled devices via Wi-ﬁ.
In Fig. 7.52 is shown onboard aircraft VSAT for the ARINC service on business
jets, such as ViaSat modem, Rantec tail-mount antenna, and ACE. Thus, this VSAT
includes an integrated transceiver, router, and a tracking antenna subsystem
developed in partnership with Rantec Microwave Systems of Calabassas, CA. The
antenna size for the ARINC service is as small as 30 cm, and it is usually
accommodated in the tail of the aircraft.

With Yonder, commercial airlines can offer true in-ﬂight wireless broadband,
enabled by ViaSat-1, the world’s highest capacity satellite, and the ViaSat
SurfBeam 2 ground system, such as higher speeds and more bandwidth for each
customer, including lower installation and airtime pricing for service plan ﬂexi-
bility. The breakthrough bandwidth economics of ViaSat-1 create a world of pos-
sibilities for a personalized broadband experience, whether it is an “ofﬁce-in-the-
sky” or multimedia entertainment, such as LiveTV.

Users Segment

In addition, to the high-value passenger experience, the crew will be able to
accomplish traditional manual tasks, such as cabin and ﬂight deck operations,
electronic ﬂight bag (EFB) systems, and ﬂight attendant reports in-ﬂight using the
satellite Internet connection.
The Yonder mobile network is providing high-speed Internet service to multiple
customer classes operating on simultaneously around the world. Applications also
include VoIP, and video, plus maritime security operations by the US Coast Guard
and real-time video feeds from intelligence, surveillance, and reconnaissance
(ISR) aircraft.
Similar to the shipborne DVB-RCS VSAT structure, it is designed the airborne
DVB-RCS VSAT structure, as shown in Fig. 7.53. This VSAT conﬁguration
contains the following components: antenna unit or ACU and BCU or satellite
router (modem) with peripherals:
1. Above Cockpit Unit (ACU)—This structure can contain tail or fuselage mount
VSAT Ku- and Ka-band satellite airborne communication antenna. Here will be
presented Gilat fuselage mount electronically steered array/phased array antenna
(ESA/PAA), which is ultra-slim; low proﬁle-phased array electronically steers
the transmission and reception beams toward the satellite versus traditional
mechanical antenna steering allowing operation even under the equator (no
“key-hole” effect).
