Preface
This book consists of a linear part written by J. Engberg and a nonlinear part written 
by T. Larsen. Noise is anything unwanted by the hearer. Electrical noise in this work 
is the result of quantification of processes and electronic movements thus leaving out 
hum, intermodulation phenomena and regular harmonic oscillations, distortions etc. 
The book begins with a short historical review on the main developments in noise 
theory.
Chapter 2 concerns noise in one-ports. From Nyquist’s expression for thermal 
noise, where the frequency dependency is mentioned, the expressions for noise re­
sistance, noise conductance and noise temperature are developed and extended to 
active as well as passive one-ports. The noise expressions are defined for thermal 
as well as for other noise sources. The last section of the chapter is devoted to 
calculation rules for noise quantities of networks consisting of two-ports in various 
combinations.
Chapter 3 is devoted to the definition of noise quantities for multiports. Here 
all types of noise quantities - the noise factor, the effective noise temperature and 
the operating noise temperature - are extended to active as well as passive networks 
and terminations. The definitions are for passive networks and terminations in ac­
cordance with the IRE definitions except for the operating noise temperature, where 
a minor correction is included. The noise quantities are defined in two ways: spot 
frequency and average values. Also the equivalent noise bandwidth is discussed. In a 
discussion of the noise quantities an operating load noise temperature is. introduced.
In Chapter 4 the noise parameters of a two-port are developed from the equiva­
lent noise two-port of Rothe and Dahlke. Similarly noise parameters are developed 
on the basis of noise power waves. The chapter finally presents transformation 
formulae between the many types of noise parameters.
In Chapter 5 the extended noise measure is introduced. The chapter is devoted 
to graphic representations of the noise measure. In order to do this the exchangeable 
power gain, which takes part in the definition of the noise measure, is illustrated. 
The graphic representation is shown in both the source admittance plane and in the 
source reflection plane. Both representations lead to a third-degree equation from 
which the extreme values of the noise measure can be calculated.
Chapter 6 concerns embedded circuits. In the first section a three-pole embedded 
in lumped one-ports is discussed. This makes it possible to calculate the noise

Preface
quantities of a transistor with bias and feedback elements included. Then a two- 
port with a lossy transmission line in front is considered, and from that the noise 
parameters of a transmission line are deduced. Then interconnection of two-ports 
is considered in various ways, and a method by Pucel et al. making it possible to 
compute the noise parameters at one high frequency from data at a lower frequency 
is presented. This method makes extensive use of embedding theory as well as 
matrix formulation. Two special circuits are considered next. One is a transistor 
with mixed transformer feedback and the other is a circuit with input at both base 
and emitter. Finally formulae for noise parameter transformations from common 
emitter to common base and common collector are presented.
Chapters 7 and 8 deal with the basic theory of non-linear noisy networks and 
systems. Chapter 7 presents the derivation of the theory, and chapter 8 presents ex­
amples and conclusion. Chapter 7 presents a unified method of analysis of low-level 
noise in non-linear networks and systems. Low-level noise refers to that the noise 
is a small pertubation of the deterministic signal regime. This book is the first to 
present a method based on Volterra series. The basic representation of noise sources 
is investigated. Both unmodulated (fundamental, independent) and modulated (de­
pendent) noise sources are treated. The noise sources are represented as the noise 
response from a non-linear system with inputs given by a fundamental (unmodu­
lated) noise source and one or more controlling variables. The controlling variables 
may be any system variables in the non-linear network. In this way it is possible 
to represent a wide variety of noise sources. Based on this representation a method 
is derived to analyse noise in general non-linear networks and systems. Expressions 
for the noise and deterministic response from the network are derived. To be able 
to determine average noise powers, expressions for the ensemble cross-correlation 
between Fourier series coefficients of the noise response at two arbitrary ports and 
at arbitrary frequencies are derived. The noise response may be determined as the 
dot product of a non-linear conversion vector and a noise vector at precalculated 
frequencies. The non-linear conversion vector is described by multi-port Volterra 
transfer functions determined from an equivalent circuit description of the network. 
Eexamples to illustrate the method are included in chapter 8. The practical appli­
cations of the method of non-linear noise analysis are expected to be in the analysis 
and optimization of noise in (near-sinusoidal) oscillators, in mixers with moderate 
local oscillator levels, and in frequency multipliers. Many oscillators are relatively 
weakly non-linear, but the non-linear 1/f noise upconversion is still very important. 
Because of this a non-linear noise analysis is required. More and more mixers are 
being used in low-power applications, eg. in portable communications equipment, 
which means that the Volterra series based noise analysis may be almost ideal for 
this purpose. Even though this type of mixers are not being switched on/offby the 
local oscillator signals, the sideband noise is still of importance and the loading of 
the mixer ports may have a significant impact on the mixer performance. Also the

xi
method of non-linear noise analysis is expected to be useful in the determination of 
noise models of non-linear devices.
Chapter 9 deals with the determination of multi-port Volterra transfer functions. 
In the existing literature only one-port Volterra transfer functions containing one- 
port non-linear elements are allowed. The method developed in the present book 
allows the determination of multi-port Volterra transfer functions containing multi­
port non-linear elements (subsystems). This is a fundamental requirement for the 
noise theory, since there are generally more than one input port in the noise descrip­
tion of the networks. Moreover, in the analysis of (noise free) non-linear circuits 
it has been pointed out that some models of MESFET’s should contain multi-port 
elements, but the theoretical methods required to determine the Volterra transfer 
functions did not exist. The present method has been implemented in a symbolic 
programming language which allows determination of the Volterra transfer functions 
in algebraic form. Using this it is possible to determine Volterra transfer functions 
up an order of about 8-10. Several examples are presented to illustrate the method, 
and comparisons with the existing literature have been made in some special cases. 
The work on multi-port Volterra series may be of high interest in the development 
of accurate non-linear models of devices with multi-dimensional non-linear elements 
and in the analysis of systems with multi-port excitations.

Some milestones in the development 
of noise theory
The first person to show the connection between “Spontaneous Fluctuations”, as 
noise was called then, and thermodynamics experimentally was the Dutch scientist 
Geertruida Luberta de Haas-Lorentz [1,2]. Using very sensitive mirror galvanome­
ters she showed that the electrons carrying the current behaved like molecules with 
temperature and she proved the thermal origin of noise on the basis of the ther­
modynamic theory which independently was developed by Albert Einstein [3,4] and 
Marian von Smoluchowski [5,6,7] and shown experimentally by Jean Baptiste Perrin 
[8j. In a third paper Albert Einstein [9] theoretically calculated a noise voltage on 
a capacitor. An interesting description of the development from the experiments of 
Robert Brown in 1827 and up to about 1906 is given by Haas-Lorentz in [2].
1.1 Johnson Noise
Quickly passing W. Schottky’s 1918 paper [10] on the theory of shot noise, the next 
major development was Nyquist’s and Johnson’s papers [11,12,13] in 1927-28. Here 
Johnson showed experimentally and Nyquist theoretically the thermal noise from a 
one-port. An outline of Nyquist’s proof is given here.
In Figure 1.1 everything is assumed ideal. The (long) coaxial transmission line 
is lossless and not radiating, and the switches are lossless and open at the beginning 
of the experiment. The two resistances have the same surrounding temperature and 
as they remain in thermodynamic equilibrium the noise power Ar2L transferred from 
2 to I must equal the noise power .Vl2 transferred the other way. Then the two 
switches are closed simultaneously. The two noise powers arc perfectly reflected at 
the ends of the line and the energy thus trapped in the transmission line will form 
oscillations at the fundamental mode and its harmonics with a voltage node at each

end. The frequencies of oscillations are
/1 = 
/2=2/l, /3 = 3/1s ...
where c is the speed of light and I the length of the transmission line. This length 
is imagined to be large (/ —> oo).
At every frequency there are two degrees of freedom (~ electrical and magnetic 
energy), and from the (classic) theory of thermodynamics it is known that each de­
gree of freedom has the energy of | k T where k = 1.38 X 10~23 J K-1 is Boltzmann’s 
constant and T the absolute temperature in kelvins.

determines the number of frequencies between
fm and fn to be n — m = (/n - fm)^
*
 The energy in the frequency band from 
fm to fn is then
= 2-|fcT(n-m) = kT(/n -/m)^ 
[J]
This, trapped energy must be equal to the noise energy delivered from the two 
resistances in the time r it takes for the power to be transferred from one end to 
the other. Therefore
M: =

where is the thermal noise power from one resistor and r = -. This deter­
mines
[N]ff^ = kT(fn - fm) = kTSf [W]
In the quantum mechanical theory Nyquist suggested that the energy kT is 
replaced by h, f /(exp — 1) where h = 6.626 x 10~34 J s is Planck’s constant and 
thus the expression for thermal noise in the frequency band A/ is
Today most authors agree that the zero-point energy term (- k T) should be included 
in the quantum mechanical expression of the energy: see [14,15,16].

1.2. Receiver noise
1.2 
Receiver noise
In the thirties and early forties noise in receivers was the great subject of interest. 
It took some time to separate the noise from the source (the' antenna) from the 
receiver noise itself. One early attempt was made by Burgess [171. who introduced 
a K factor which was dependent only on the source resistance, the resistance of the 
input network and the equivalent noise resistance of the first valve.
A figure of merit for receiver noise - the noise factor - was introduced by D. 
0. North [18] and independently by K. Franz [19]. Two years later H. T. Friis [20] 
wrote a paper on the noise figure (which today is called noise factor) and a lot of 
articles emerged discussing the definitions of North and Friis - a rivalry on which 
Okwit [21] has written an interesting article.
The definitions were expressed a little differently, but they were all on the familiar 
noise factor. Franz did not call his definition anything, but he clearly used the 
concept of available power. North also introduced the “operating noise factor1' which 
multiplied by the noise standard temperature, To equals the modern operating noise 
temperature, Top. Friis’s definition was very stringent. He used available power and 
available gain and he also derived a formula for the noise factor of networks in 
cascade.
One more thing that was discussed was the value of the standard noise 
temperature. Values from 288.39 to 300 K had been proposed - see [21] and 
[22, pp. 54-55] - until 290 K was chosen as the standard noise temperature by 
IRE in 1962 [23].
1.3 
Linear two- and multi-ports
In 1955 Rothe and Dahlke [24,25] enlarged the well-known (voltage and/or current 
based) small-signal parameters (four complex numbers) to include noise by adding 
four more numbers (two real and one complex). They also facilitated noise compu­
tations by replacing two partly correlated noise sources with two uncorrelated noise 
sources and a correlation immittance. The four noise quantities are called noise 
parameters and they exist in many forms. Later, noise power wave based noise 
parameters were developed by Penfield, Meys and others a,s explained in Chapter 4.
This theory was further developed to a linear noisy network theory in 1959 by 
Haus and Adler, collected in [26]. They introduced the noise measure and showed 
that the minimum noise measure was invariant by embedding in noiseless compo­
nents. Also they introduced the extended noise factor for negative sources. In 1967 
Bosma [27] introduced the characteristic noise temperature which can be related to 
the noise measure. It is, however, seldom used - perhaps because the characteristic 
noise temperature is negative for ordinary amplifiers.

was written by A. van der Ziel [16].

Noise in one-ports
With a background of Nyquist’s theory of thermal noise this chapter gives the 
definitions of some noise quantities for one-ports. These are extended to allow 
negative immittances1 and calculation rules for noisy one-ports are developed.
2.1 Thermal noise
H. Nyquist [1] has shown that the thermal available noise power from a conductor 
at the physical temperature T [K] is
N = 
------A/ 
[W] 
(2.1)
exp[^f] - 1
where h = 6.626 x 10-34 J s is Planck’s constant,2 k — 1.38 0 7 X 10-23 J K ’1 is 
Boltzmann’s constant,3 f is the frequency and A/ is the bandwidth (of the measuring 
system), both in Hz. It is assumed that the noise power density is constant in the 
frequency range A/ around fQ or 0 < f0 - 
< f < f0 + For h f kT, a
condition which at room temperature is fulfilled for f < 600 GHz, Equation (2.1) 
is reduced to
N = kT&f !W] 
(2.2)
In the following it is - if not specifically stated - assumed chat the frequency is low 
enough for using Equation (2.2). If T = 290 K (17 °C) the available noise power 
density is
N' . = kT = 
1.38 x IO”23 x 290 = 4.00 x 10~21 WHz-1
rThe term immittance is used when it. is not necessary to distinguish between impedance and 
admittance.

measured in the frequency band A f with a ‘True’’ RMS-meter and R and G are 
defined in Figure 2.2. From this expression the mean square noise voltage is given 
by

2.2 Definitions of noise quantities
In noise analysis it is (|e|2) (and (|i|2) ) which is of interest in noise calculations, as 
(e) is equal to zero. As (|e|x) is dependent on the bandwidth A/ this must also be 
specified. Sometimes the quantities (|e|2)/A/ [V2Hz-1] or ^/( |e|2) / A/ [V Hz-*]  
are used* 5 but mostly one of the following representations is preferred.
Since noise may have other origins than thermal effects and since it is convenient 
to have equivalent representations for all types of noise, Equations (2.4) and (2.5) 
are modified in such a way that they are valid for all kinds of noise. This can be done 
in two ways. One possibility is to keep the temperature T fixed and then change the 
values of the resistance R and of the conductance G until the equations are fulfilled. 
The values for R and G obtained in this way are called the equivalent noise resistance 
Rn and the equivalent noise conductance Gn respectively. The other possibility is 
to keep the resistance and the conductance at their physical values and then select 
the temperature T such that the equations are fulfilled. This change of temperature 
could also be performed in Equation (2.2). The thus obtained temperature is called 
the noise temperature of the one-port.
In order to be able to characterize one-ports with negative real parts of their 
impedance or admittance the available power according to custom is replaced by the 
exchangeable power5 as introduced by Hans and Adler [51. Thus the thermal avail­
able noise power is replaced by the exchangeable noise power, Ae. in Equation (2.2).

2. Noise in one-ports
where (|e|2) 
[V2] is the mean square (open circuited) noise voltage
at the terminals of the one-port in the frequency band A/ [Hz], k = 
1.3807 x 10-23 JK-1 is Boltzmann’s constant and Tq = 290 K is the stan­
dard noise temperature.
It is seen that the chosen fixed temperature in Equation (2.4) is To regardless 
of the physical temperature of the one-port. A change in the mean square noise 
voltage with temperature determines the variation of Rn with temperature. Other 
noise contributions than the thermal noise also change, (increase) the equivalent 
noise resistance. A variation of Rn with frequency f occurs quite often, and A/ 
should be chosen so narrow that (|e|2)/A/ is independent of the value of A/.7 The 
quantity (|ej2)/A/ can be regarded as the mean square noise voltage density. It is 
seen that Rn > 0 even if the one-port has a negative real part of its resistance.
A one-port characterized by R^ generates as much noise as a metallic conduc­
tor (which only generates thermal noise) with the resistance Rn at standard noise 
temperature. Rn does not give any information about the ohmic resistance of the 
one-port. The equivalent diagram of the one-port consists of a series connection 
of its impedance, a noise voltage generator, the stochastic noise voltage which is 
determined by
< |e|2) = u-T0Rna/ [V2] 
(2.7)
and perhaps one or more deterministic voltage generators. According to custom a 
noise voltage generator in a diagram is shown with the symbol of a normal voltage 
generator with Rn beside, as seen in Figure 2.2.
2.2.2 The equivalent noise conductance
Definition 2.2 The equivalent noise conductance of a one-port Gn is de­
fined as 
where (|i]2) [A2] is the mean square (short circuited) noise current at 
the terminals of the one-port in the frequency band A/ [Hz], k — 1.3807 
X 10~23 J K-1 is Boltzmann’s constant and To — 290 K is the standard noise 
temperature.
The same remarks as above for the equivalent noise resistance can be added 
here if voltage, resistance, impedance series connection are replaced by current, 
conductance, admittance and parallel connection respectively. Similarly, a noise

(2.9)
2.2.3 The extended noise temperature
The above definitions for Rn and Gn have been chosen in such a way that they are 
both positive whatever sign the immittance of the one-port has. In the following 
definition of the noise temperature for a one-port the usual definition [4] has been 
extended such that the sign of the extended noise temperature shows if the one-port 
is active8 or passive [61.
Definition 2.3 The extended noise temperature of a one-port is the 
exchangeable noise power density, Nfe [W/Hz], divided by Boltzmann’s 
constant, k — 1.3807 X 10~23 J K"1.
".Active means a one port with negative teal part of its immittance.
Tem = 
[K] 
(2.10)
This definition is equivalent to that in Equations (2.4) and (2.5) keeping the 
values of R and G at their physical values and then adjusting T until the equations 
are fulfilled. Thus definition 2.3 can be expressed by either

The subscript em stands for extended, which refers to the extension of the noise 
temperature to active one-ports, and mono for one-port.
The extended noise temperature is negative when the one-port is active as iV' 
then is negative. This corresponds to a negative R or G in Equations (2.11) and 
(2.12). Of course Tsm can not tell anything about the physical temperature except 
in the case of pure thermal noise (of a one-port which then must be passive) where 
Tem equals the physical temperature. From

2.3 Calculation with noise quantities
In order to calculate the noise properties of series and parallel connections of uncor­
related9 one-ports it is necessary to develop rules for series connection of one-ports 
characterized by either Rn or Tem and similarly parallel connection of one-ports 
characterized by either Gn or Tem.
Noise generators are represented by stochastic processes, and when those are 
uncorrelated (independent) the following formulas for the equivalent mean square 
noise voltage (|e|2) for series connected noise voltage generators and the equivalent 
mean square noise current (lip) for parallel connected noise current generators arc 
valid:

equivalent noise resistances and conductances
The Thevenin equivalent of a noisy one-port is a series connection of an internal 
impedance Z (passive or active), a (stochastic) noise voltage generator Rn generating 
a mean square noise voltage given by Equation (2.4) and perhaps a (deterministic) 
voltage generator E as shown in Figure 2.3.

Figure 2.4. As the imaginary parts of the impedances do not generate noise only 
the real parts - the resistances - are shown in Figure 2.4. Inserting Equation (2.4)

The network divides the antenna voltage by 10 (and the power by 16.67) and the 
antenna noise temperature (and noise power) is divided by 6.6 so the signal to noise 
ratio is only slightly degraded (~ 4 dB). At long- and medium-wave bands, where the 
antenna noise temperature is above 300 000 K, the degradation of the signal to noise 
ratio is hardly noticeable (~ 0.09 dB), so a lossy network can be used to isolate a receiver 
from an unknown antenna impedance if the antenna noise temperature is relatively high 
compared to ambient temperature.

Noise characteristics of multi-ports
The multi-ports considered in this chapter can be single response two-ports, multi­
response two-ports or multi-ports with one or more responses at each port. In 
single response two-ports only one single input frequency gives an output at the 
corresponding output frequency and - of less importance in noise theory - this input 
frequency leads to no other outputs at other output frequencies. A multi-response 
port can be considered as many ports as there are responses at the desired output 
frequency at the output port. This means that multi-response ports are treated as 
multi-ports with as many ports as the sum of ports times responses requires. It is 
important to note that only one output port is considered and for spot frequency 
analysis only a single output frequency is of interest. If more than one output port 
is of interest each output port is treated separately one by one.
After a short look at some power gain definitions the following noise quantities 
are introduced: effective input noise temperature, noise factor and operating noise 
temperature. The noise measure is defined in Chapter 5. Of these the operating 
noise temperature is intended to be used to describe the noise performance of a 
system including source and load generated noise. The other definitions are used 
to describe devices, stages and amplifiers and they are extended to cover negative 
immittances as well [1,2]. Then the average values of the noise quantities are defined. 
In a discussion of the noise quantities a definition of an output operating noise 
temperature is considered.
3.1 Power gains
Two types of power gain are often used in noise theory. One is the available power 
gain which is extended to include negative immittances and is then called the ex­
changeable power gam. The other is the transducer gain.
For a passive one-port source the available power Pa is defined as the great-
19

20
3. Noise characteristics of multi-ports
est power that can be drawn from the source by arbitrary variation of its 
terminal current (or voltage) [2]. This power is the maximum power delivered 
to the load when the load immittance is the complex conjugate of the source im­
mittance. Extending the above definition to active sources gives no meaning as the 
“maximum” power is infinite and thus not a stationary value (extremum). Howev­
er, a (negative) stationary value exists in this case so the exchangeable power Pe is 
defined as follows.
Definition 3.1 The exchangeable power of a one-port Pe is the stationary 
value (extremum) of the power output from the source, obtained by 
arbitrary variation of the terminal current (or voltage).
For a Thevenin equivalent of a one-port where Z — R d- j X and R 0 definition 
3.1 leads to
Pe
(H2)
2(Z + Z-)
[W] for R 0 0 
(3.1)
It is seen that Pe is negative when the one-port is active (R < 0) and positive when 
passive (R > 0).
The extended version of the available power gain, which is defined as the available 
power at the output divided by the available power at the source, is the exchangeable 
power gain Ge defined by replacing the available powers by exchangeable powers.
Definition 3.2 The exchangeable power gain Ge is defined as
Ge =

and the exchangeable power at the source 
where eO) Rs 0 and Ro 7^ 0 are the Thevenin voltage at the source 
and output terminals and the corresponding resistances.
It is seen that
Ge > 0 
when 
Rs /Ro > 0
G„ < 0 
when 
R$/R.:j < 0
The transducer gain Gr is defined as the power delivered to the load divided 
by the power available from the source. As the available power is always positive 
then Gt > 0 for passive loads and Gt < 0 for active loads. If active sources 
are considered Gt ~ 0 as the available power approaches infinity. It is therefore 
necessary to extend the definition in the same way as above. This leads to

Definition 3.3 The extended transducer gain Ger is defined as

where Pl is the power delivered to the load and Pets is the exchangeable 
power at the source.
It is seen that

where Rs and Rl are the source and load resistances respectively.
3-2 Definitions of noise quantities
In this section the extended noise temperature, the extended noise factor (and figure) 
and the operating noise temperature which also is given in an extended version are 
defined. The extensions of the old definitions include the cases of active sources. 
This is very convenient as a stage in a cascade of stages as source immittance has 
the output immittance of the former stage. Often this stage is only stable when 
loaded which means that the output immittance can well be negative.
The definition of the noise measure will be given in Chapter 5.
Usually the available or exchangeable power gain is used for definitions of spot 
frequency noise quantities and the transducer or extended transducer gain for aver­
age noise quantities and this habit is maintained here. It is, however, not important 
which type of gain is used as all noise quantities are defined as ratios of powers 
and a change of e.g. exchangeable output powers in numerator and denominator to 
powers delivered to the load does not change anything.
3.2.1 The effective noise temperature
The idea behind the definition of the noise temperature is to transfer the noise 
power generated in the two- or multi-port to the source or sources. As a one-port 
source with a known exchangeable noise power is characterized by its extended noise 
temperature this quantity is used to characterize the two- or multi-port.
Definition 3.4 The extended effective (input) noise temperature Tee of a 
multi-port transducer is defined as the exchangeable output noise power 
density at a specified output frequency of the transducer with noise free 
sources, Nf„ [WHz^1] divided by Boltzmann's constant k = 1.3807 x 10"23

T* = [K] (3’4)
where I is the number of responses from all the input ports and Geii is 
the exchangeable power gain from port response i to the output port.
Note 1: There is only one output port and at that port only one frequency is 
considered. As the definition uses the exchangeable output noise power density any 
noise from the load has no influence on Tee
Note 2: All other ports than the output port are considered input ports and 
they should be loaded with any passive or active immittances except short or open 
circuits.
Note 3: Tes is a function of the source immittance(s).
The subscript ee stands for extended Te where Te is the standard symbol for 
the IRE definition of effective input noise temperature [3].
For passive port terminations this definition is equivalent to the IRE definition. 
The IRE definition states that the effective (extended) input noise temperature of a 
multi-port transducer is the (extended) noise temperature which assigned simulta­
neously to all input ports of a noise free equivalent of the transducer yields the same 
available (exchangeable) output noise power density at a specified output frequency 
as the actual transducer with noise free sources.
With all input port terminations active, definition 3.4 gives a value of Te€ which 
is negative and this corresponds to definition 2.3 of Tem. If, however, some input 
ports are terminated by passive immittances and some by active immittances Tee 
can be of both signs. This situation is discussed below. In these cases with some or 
all input terminations active the above IRE definition is equivalent to definition 3.4 
when the alterations and the addition indicated in brackets are taken into account.

exchangeable output noise power density A". The noise free - but otherwise equiv­
alent - amplifier to the left is connected to a source of which the extended noise 
temperature is varied in such a way that the exchangeable noise power density of this 
amplifier is also ;V'. Then the extended noise temperature of that source is defined 
to be the extended noise temperature of the noisy amplifier. As -V' is a function of 
frequency the extended noise temperature is also a function of frequency.
As mentioned above the interpretation of Tee with both active and passive input 
terminations is a little difficult. Consider a three-port transducer with one output 
port and two input ports. The input ports are loaded with two immittances where 
one is passive and one active and the output immittance may be either passive 
or active. As Tee is the same at both input ports and the exchangeable power 
gains from the two ports have opposite signs, one of the input ports has assigned 
an extended noise temperature of the opposite sign than the port resistance. It 
also seems that the noise power density at the output port consists of the difference 
between two noise power densities. This can be accepted as fictitious reference noise 
temperatures at the input ports, but it seems more natural if the temperature and 
resistance had the same sign and that the powers were added. If the input ports 
were loaded with either only active or only passive immittances, the noise powers 
at the output port from the input ports would all have the same sign. When this is 
not the case another - always positive - noise temperature is sometimes useful. It 
can be expressed from the extended noise temperature by
The idea behind Tep is that if all the input port responses are loaded by immittances 
with noise temperatures of ±Tep (4- for a passive load and — for an active load) 
and the transducer is replaced by a noise free equivalent, then the exchangeable 
output noise power density is the same as that from the actual transducer with 
noise free sources. It is seen that if and only if the loads to the input port responses 
are either all passive or all active then 7'ep = |TeeL One of the main reasons 
for choosing definition 3.4 instead of Tep as the definition of the extended noise 
temperature is that for a single response two-port the function Tee(Z<), where Zs is 
the source impedance, is the quadric surface of a hyperboloid of two sheets.1 This 
is a consequence of the simple relations - for single response two-ports - between 
the extended noise temperature and the extended noise factor defined below.
3-2 2 The noise factor
A much used noise characteristic for two-ports is the noise factor. It is, however, not 
very practical to use with multi-ports, where the noise temperature is preferable,

but in some cases more than. one response is considered. The noise factor was the 
first to be "extended” to active sources [4].
Definition 3.5 The extended noise factor of a multi-port transducer, Fe 
(at a specified input frequency or specified input frequencies which all 
give an output response at the same output frequency) is defined as the 
ratio of (1) the total exchangeable noise power density at the output 
port (and at the corresponding output frequency) when the extended 
noise temperature of the source (or sources) is/are the standard noise 
temperature (290 K) at all frequencies (and input ports), to (2) that 
part of the exchangeable noise power density at the output port which 
originates from the signal source (or sources) at the input frequency (or 
frequencies) and at standard noise temperature.
Note 1: Fe is not defined for a one-port.2
2 Unfortunately the expression F. = 1 + T-m/To is sometimes used for a one-port noise factor, 
which is excluded by the definition.
Note 2: For multi-ports with more than one signal response, either an extended 
noise factor is defined for each signal response, or part (2) in the definition includes 
noise from those port responses which are used for the input signals.
Note 3: Fe is a function of the source immittance(s).
For two-ports this definition gives the source noise power density N'e s ~ kTo. 
The exchangeable output noise power density N'eo consists of two parts: the noise 
power generated by the internal noise sources of the network N'e and the input noise 
amplified by the exchangeable power gain of the network kToGe. As definition 3.4 
leads to N*  = kTee Ge one gets
=

Tee = (Fe-1)TO [K] 
(3.7)
Please note that Equations (3.6) and (3.7) are only valid for a two-port with a single 
input and a single output frequency. For multi-ports conversion from Tee to Fe and 
vice versa is more complicated and is discussed below.
Definition 3.5 is also consistent with H. T. Friis’s previous definition [6] when 
- instead of the exchangeable power gain - the available power gain is used. 
Ga = So/S$ where So and S$ are the available signal output and source powers in 
the frequency range of interest A/.
F -T = 
1 -V'A/
Ga k'To&f

3.2. Definitions of noise quantities

From the definition it is seen that
Fe > 1 for > 0
Fe < 1 for Rs < 0
The noise factor for Fs > 1 is often expressed in dB by
R [dB] = 
10 log Fe
(3.8)
and then mostly called the noise figure. Also Fe — 1 ~ Fce/F^ is called the extended 
excess noise factor.
Example 3.1 In the figure below a two-port consists of three resistors with known 
resistances and noise temperatures. When the source resistance Rs is known it is 
possible to determine the noise factor of the two-port by use of definition 3.5.

Example 3.2 Consider a transmission line made of metallic conductors and therefore 
generating only thermal noise at the physical temperature of 17 °C ( — To) and a loss of 
L = l/(7e. In order to find its noise figure the source must have the noise temperature 
of To also. As a transmission line generates only thermal noise the transmission line 
and source together can be regarded as a one-port at standard temperature and thus 
its output noise power density is AjTq. The noise power density from the source is 
A:To which is “amplified” by Ge = 1/L- The ratio of these two noise power densities 
determines the noise factor:
Now let the transmission line have the physical temperature T^. To begin with let 
Tti = To, then
+ kTo/L = kT0 => N'Tq = &TO(1 - l/L)

Consider a heterodyne system with a normal response and an image response. 
If it is used for a broadcast receiver the wanted signal is only present at the normal 
response and the denominator in definition 3.5 includes only noise from the source 
at the input response frequency, but the numerator contains noise from both the 
normal and the image responses. If the receiver is for radio astronomy, signals are 
present at both responses and therefore the denominator in definition 3.5 includes 
noise from both input responses. Alternatively it may include one response and a 
separate noise factor derived for each response. The distinction between the two 
uses of the noise factor is given by calling them single and double sideband noise 
factors respectively.
In Figure 3.2 the Z-f

tances, but signals, which are supposed to be uncorrelated, are applied to only I of 
them. Suppose the extended noise temperature Tee is given, then the exchangeable

3.2.3 The operating noise temperature
The operating noise temperature Top - sometimes called the system noise temper­
ature - is used to characterize a system under operating conditions and includes 
all noise contributions which add to the output noise power delivered to the load. 
Consider the system shown in Figure 3.3 where three sources contribute to the noise 
power density delivered to the load. One contribution is the noise from the source 
which could be an antenna with known noise temperature. For the time being only 
passive sources and loads are considered. The available source noise power ampli­
fied by the transducer gain determines the contribution from the source to the noise 
power density delivered to the load. The next noise source is from the two-port 
considered (e.g. a receiver). This part is given by the Tee of the two-port and con­
tributes by definition 3.4 as the source at the noise temperature of Tee. The final 
part is from the load itself. The load generates noise; some of this noise is absorbed 
by the output port of the two-port (and changes Tes, but often only slightly) and 
the remaining part is reflected at the output port ?md then contributes to the noise 
delivered to the load. This third part is usually very small compared to the other 
two. While these are amplified by the normally very big transducer gain of the 
system, the load-generated noise is reduced as it is divided between the load and 
the output immittance of the transducer.
The IRE definition [5] has been changed in two respects. First it has been 
extended to cover multi-ports writh active as well as passive sources, and secondly

3.2. Definitions of noise quantities

the noise power density considered at the output is the power delivered to the 
noise tree part of the load circuit. This is because the load noise often flows in the 
opposite direction to the noise delivered to the load and thus reduce the operating 
noise temperature [7]. The noise generated in the load and reflected at the output 
port is included as in the IRE definition.

free immittance of the load circuit, k = 1.3807 X 10~23 J K'1 is Boltzmann’s 
constant, I is the number of signal responses from all input ports where 
signals are applied and Gei\i is the extended transducer gain from port 
response i to the output port.
Note 1: There is only one output port and at that port only one frequency is 
considered.
Note 2: Noise generated in the load and reflected at the output of the trans­
ducer back to the noise free equivalent of the load is part of the numerator in 
Equation (3.14).
Note 3: All ports other than the output port are considered input ports and 
they should be loaded with any passive or active immittances except short or open 
circuits.
Note 4: The denominator of Equation (3.14) includes only gains from input 
responses where signals are applied.

In order to keep track of the signs a three-port is considered. The two signal 
input ports are loaded with an active and a passive generator immittance and the 
possible sign combinations are shown in Table 3.1. If instead only port 1 is applied 
with a signal the sign combinations shown in Table 3.2 occur.

where I is the number of inputs with signals applied and Rl is the real part of the

In most cases where Teop is used both the source and load will be passive and 
most often a single response transducer is considered.
It should be noted that Teop is used in the common “figure of merit” GjT, where 
G is the antenna gain and T — Teop.
Example 3.5 The importance of only considering the lossless part of the load circuit is 
illustrated by calculation of the extended operating noise temperature of an attenuator. 
Consider the one in Example 2.3 and load it with Zl = 75 T j 25 Q with a load noise 
temperature Tl = 580 K. Computing the exchangeable power gain of the attenuator 
one gets G? = 60.0 X 10-3 and the method used in Example 3.2 determines
Fe = l/Ge
16.67
=> Te& = (Fe - 1)TO = 4543 K
This determines term 1 in Equation (3.15) to be Tee + Ta = 7543 K. In order to 
compute term 2 let the load circuit be substituted by an equivalent noise free impedance 
Zl in series with a noise voltage generator whose voltage is determined by

The power delivered to the noise free part of the load is

If the IRE definition is used the power density flow to the load is the same as above

output of the attenuator will then be subtracted. This part of the power density flow 
is determined by the output terminal voltage U, the current into the load circuit I and

Example 3.6 Let a 12 GHz satellite-TV receiver require a G/T — 14 dB. If a 90 cm

3.3 Average noise quantities and the noise bandwidth
The noise definitions in Section 3.2 above a,re all defined at a single (a spot) output 
frequency and therefore often called spot noise quantities. They are functions of the 
frequency and most useful to describe the noise behaviour of the circuit. Sometimes 
it is practical to characterize the noise properties in a given frequency band with 
one number instead of the more useful frequency function and therefore the average 
noise quantities are introduced. If the gain function of the circuit is not very fiat 
there may be some confusion as to how the reference amplification and the frequency 

3.3. Average noise quantities and the noise bandwidth
33
band are defined. These problems are exposed and the equivalent noise bandwidth 
is defined.
In the IRE definitions of average noise quantities the transducer gain is used. 
When the definitions are extended to active sources it is necessary to replace it with 
the extended transducer gain from Equation (3.3), but the really confusing problem 
is when source immittance or load immittance changes sign in the frequency band 
of interest. This leads to the possibility of zero exchangeable noise power and gives 
results which can not be given a physical meaning. If the IRE definitions are going 
to be extended to active devices it could be more interesting to look at the flow 
of the noise powers. Then the results may be given an understandable physical 
meaning, but the equations will be rather complicated. As extended average noise 
quantities are used rather seldom, it is chosen to keep the mathematics as simple 
as possible, and thus in cases with both positive and negative noise power flow the 
values of the noise quantities do not right away give an impression of whether an 
amplifier has good or bad noise properties.
3.3.1 The average effective noise temperature
The definition of the average extended noise temperature is given as a formula and 
if all source immittances for all input frequencies have the same sign and the load 
immittance also has the same sign for all output frequencies a more explanatory 
equivalent formulation can be given.
Definition 3.7 The average extended effective (input) noise temperature 
of a multi-port Tee is defined as 
Tee
ELTGeM/ - /.)#
[K]
(3.18)
where Tee(f) is the extended effective noise temperature of the multi­
port as a function of the frequency /, and GeT,i(f - ft) is the extended 
transducer gain from port response t to the output port at an input 
frequency f — f which originates a corresponding output frequency f.
If Tee^f) for all f have the same sign and also if GeT.i(f — ft) for ah f and i 
have the same sign. Equation (3.18) is seen as a weighted average of Tes. In words 
this can be stated as follows:
For a multi-port with a load immittance which has the same sign for all frequen­
cies and with source immittances which all (and for all frequencies) have the same 
sign, the average extended effective (input) noise temperature Tee is the extended 
noise temperature applied to all input immittances of a noise free equivalent of the 
multi-port which delivers the same noise power to the load as the noisy multi-port 
with noise free sources.

34
3. Noise characteristics of multi-ports
3.3.2 The average noise factor
For the average extended noise factor the same comments apply as for the average 
effective noise temperature.
Definition 3.8 The average extended noise factor of a multi-port is 
defined as

where Fe(f) is the extended noise factor of the multi-port as a function 
of the frequency /, G^Af ~~ fi) the extended transducer gain from 
port response i to the output port at an input frequency f — f, which 
originates a corresponding output frequency /, I is the number of signal 
responses and Z+J is the total number of responses from sources to load.
If Fe(f) has the same sign for all f and Gei\i(f — fi) has the same sign for all 
f and i, Equation (3.19) can be seen as a weighted average of K. In words this can 
be stated as:
For a multi-port with a load immittance which has the same sign for all frequen­
cies and with source immittances which all (and for all frequencies) have the same 
sign, the average extended noise factor Fe is the ratio of (1) the total noise power 
delivered to the load when the extended noise temperature of the source (or sources) 
is/are the standard noise temperature (290 K) at all frequencies (and input ports), 
to (2) that part of the noise power delivered to the load which originates from the 
signal source (or sources) at standard noise temperature.

3.3. Average noise quantities and the noise bandwidth

 The average operating noise temperature
The IRE definition [5] uses signal gain which involves the signal bandwidth in the 
definition of the average operating noise temperature. As many new modulation 
schemes have been developed in the last decades it seems inconvenient to tie a noise 
definition to the type of signal. Thus the signal gain is replaced by the extended 
transducer gain from the signal input ports to the output port in the definition of 
the average extended operating noise temperature.
Definition 3.9 The average extended operating noise temperature of a 
multi-port Teop is defined as
(3.23)
where Ar£(/) is the total noise power density delivered to the equiva­
lent noise free immittance of the load circuit at the output frequency /, 
k - 1.3807 X 10”23 J K-1 is Boltzmann’s constant, I is the number of signal 
responses from all input ports where signals are applied and 
~ fi)
is the extended transducer gain from port response i to the output port 
at an input frequency f — fi which causes the output frequency f.
Note 1: Noise generated in the load and reflected at the output of the trans­
ducer back to the noise free equivalent of the load is part of the numerator in 
Equation (3.23).
Note 2: The resulting 
may consist of parts with opposite signs at a
frequency f and also iV£(/) may change sign with varying frequency. This means 
that when active immittances occur great care should be taken in interpreting the 
value of Teop.
Note 3: All ports other than the output port are considered input ports and 
they should be loaded with any passive or active immittances except short or open 
circuits and the extended noise temperatures of these loads are the actual ones.
Note 4: The denominator of Equation (3.23) includes only gains from input 
responses where signals are applied.

As stated in note 2 care should be taken in interpreting the value of Teop when 
active immittances occur. Even a very noisy transducer may have almost zero Teop 
as the noise power may flow in opposite directions at different frequencies. On the 
other hand in all those cases where the noise power parts delivered to the load add 
up with the same sign the average extended noise temperature is a very descriptive 
quantity.
3.3.4 The equivalent noise bandwidth
For each response a gain function exists. In many expressions in noise theory this 
gain function is integrated over all f. It is often convenient to replace the integral 
with the product of a fixed reference gain GeTr (often the maximum gain) aud 
a bandwidth which is called the noise bandwidth Bn, when the gain function is 
the (extended) transducer gain. Even if the extended transducer gain can be used 
the interpretation is most clear for the common transducer gain function which is 
possitive for all f.
Definition 3.10 The (extended) equivalent noise bandwidth Bn is defined 
as
= m (3.a)
GeTr
where GeTr is the reference value of the extended transducer gain func­
tion GeT(f) (at a corresponding reference frequency /r).
Note 1: Usually GeTr is chosen as the maximum value of GeTr(f\ hut it can be 
chosen freely, so it is important to know which GeTr (or /r) is used when the noise 
bandwidth is specified.
As seen from Figure 3.4 it is important to specify which Gerr or fr is used 
when the noise bandwidth is used. It should be noted that all axes in Figure 3.4 
are linearly scaled and that the area under the gain function is equal to the area 
determined by GeTr Bn- The ratio of Bn/B^b for n LC-circuits with identical Q 
factor, resonance frequency and without any mutual coupling is given in Table 3.3.
Example 3.7 A tuned amplifier consists of an £C-circuit, a transistor and another 
Z/C-circuit with the same Q and resonance frequency as the first, and no coupling exists

is Tems — 580 K (~ 2 To) the problem is to find the signal to noise ratio at the load 
for an input signal power level of 1 pW.

It is supposed that the signal gain G$ — S^/Si is equal to the transducer gain

By), which usually is the case. If the power spectra of St and iVjr,
are different due to a special type of modulation and/or very frequency dependent Te- 
the above calculation may give a wrong result. The IRE definition, which uses Gs in the 
definition of Top, will of course give the correct result, but the problem is that the signal 
spectrum then must be specified together with the Top figure to give a full description 
of the noise in the system and also when measuring the Top.
The response factor defined in Equation (3.20) can be expressed with use of 
noise bandwidths for multi-ports which are not loaded with short or open circuits

3.4 Discussion of noise quantities
Most often noise quantities are used to describe the noise properties of two-ports. 
In cascading these, one or more of the two-ports may be only conditionally stable. 
This means that a source or load for one of the stages is active even if the cascaded 
circuit is stable. This situation is quite common at higher frequencies. Therefore 
in extending the gain and noise quantity definitions to include active sources and 
loads, first priority was given to ensure that the well-known and often used formulae 
could be used unchanged.
When extending to multi-ports this choice will in rare cases give some values for 
extended noise quantities which - considered alone - do not give a correct feeling 
for the noise properties of the device. This is due to the fact that the extended 
definitions in special cases may have noise powers going in opposite directions and 
thus being subtracted. It has been decided to accept this rarely occurring calamity 
in order to preserve the simplicity of the often used formulae.
The same problem occurs for the average noise quantities if either the source, 
the load or the gain of the device changes sign in the frequency band of interest. At 
one frequency the noise power flows in one direction and at another in the opposite. 
Thus the noise power integrated over the frequency band may be a small and rather 
meaningless figure.
One way to get around these problems is to introduce yet another noise quan­
tity [7]. As all definitions of noise quantities consider only one output port no 
ambiguity exists on the sign of the load at a given output frequency. By referring a 
noise temperature to the output terminal many problems are solved. The proposed 
output noise temperature is called the extended load operating noise temperature 
and is defined for a multi response transducer as
Definition 3.11 The extended load operating noise temperature Tclop of 
a multi-response transducer is defined as
-v; 
l-Lcp - 
— 
(O.M)
where N£ is the noise power density delivered to the equivalent noise 
free immittance of the load circuit at the output frequency and k = 
1.3807 x 10-23 J K-1 is Boltzmann’s constant.

3.4. Discussion of noise quantities
39
If the extended load operating noise temperature should have an average equiv­
alent and the load immittance should change sign in the frequency band of interest 
the same problem occurs once again. Two possibilities exist. One is to integrate 
numerically in order to add all the power how over the frequency range. The other 
is just to integrate, which in some rare instances gives meaningless results without 
further information. But is an average extended load operating noise temperature 
needed? Perhaps an international, European or American standard committee on 
noise might be a good idea. If so the number of recommended definitions might be 
reduced. The first step could be to abolish the average definitions.

Noise parameters
Most amplifiers consist of cascaded two-ports. In order to characterize the noisy be­
haviour of a two-port several sorts of noise parameters have been developed. Noise 
parameters can also be developed for multi-ports, but would be more clumsy to 
use. Two-ports are conveniently characterized by their small-signal parameters like 
H, y or S parameters. These consist of 8 (4 complex) numbers, which are func­
tions of frequency and bias point in particular and to a minor extent temperature, 
radioactive radiation etc. They are, however, used extensively in practical circuit 
design. By adding 4 more numbers (2 real and 1 complex) the noise properties of a 
two-port can be included as well. Those 4 numbers are called noise parameters and 
- in analogy to small-signal parameters - noise parameters exist in many forms.
In this chapter the noise parameters are derived, their use explained, and the 
conversion formulae between different types of noise parameters given.
4.1 Noise voltages and currents
In 1955 Rothe and Dahlke [1] introduced noise parameters related to the chain or 
ABCD small-signal parameters. These are based on noise voltages and currents. In 
a similar way noise power waves related to the scattering parameters have been used 
by several authors, e.g. [2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9], but they are still not used as extensively as 
the Rothe and Dahlke type of noise parameters.
4.1.1 The equivalent noise two-port
In order to describe a noisy linear two-port, the small-signal equations are enlarged 
to cover the noise contributions as well. In Figure 4.1 the noisy two-purl and three 
examples of equivalent circuits are shown. In Figure 4.1(a) the noisy two-port is 
characterized by hatching. In Figures 4.1(b), (c), and (d) the noisy two-port is

replaced by a noise free but otherwise unchanged two-port and two partially corre­
lated noise generators. This is correct as long as the two-port is linear. Physically 
the noise sources inside the two-port can contribute to either the input side, the 
output side, or both. Mathematically two linear equations exist between the input 
and output sides and the noise appears in both equations.

The noise vectors each represent two noise generators. As the noise is generated 
inside the two-port by various physical processes, the contributions to the two noise 
generators are more or less correlated. It is therefore necessary to know the correla­
tion between the two generators. The correlation between two stochastic variables

As shown in Figure 4.2(b) the noise current generator is partitioned into two 
parts. -in = inl -|- ir.2, where one part (in2) 1S partially correlated with the noise 
voltage generator and the other part (zni) is uncorrelated. Thus

The circuit in Figure 4.3 can be replaced by the circuit in Figure 4.4 where Yy 
and — Yy are noise free which is shown by their noise temperatures of 0 K. The noise 
generators are conveniently indicated with Rn and Gn by Equations (2.4) and (2.5) 
replacing the bandwidth dependent en and ini. The two circuits are identical as 
their open circuit voltages and short circuit currents are the same. The equivalent 
noise two-port - such as the one in Figure 4.4 - are placed in front of the noise free 
small signal two-port. When small signal analysis is performed, the noise voltage 
generator is short circuited, en = 0, the noise current generator is open circuited, 
inl = 0, and Yy and — Yy cancel each other, therefore the noise two-port will have 
no effect on the small signal analysis.
From the two noise generators in Equation (4.1) given by (|en|2), and 
their correlation coefficient 7, the four noise parameters Rn, Gn and Y7 — Gy-\-j 
shown in Figure 4.4 are determined.
If the noise voltage generator instead is partitioned - with the noise current, 
generator - into a correlated and an uncorrelated part, the resulting equivalent 
noise two-port is shown in Figure 4.5. Again the four noise parameters rn, gn and

Two sets of noise parameters have now been defined. These are Rni Gn, and Y7

Zy which are convenient with Z parameters.
4.1.2 Y and Z noise parameters
From Figure 4.4 the noise factor can be derived. The amplifier following the noise 
two-port is noise free so that the noise ratios on the output and input side of the 
amplifier are the same and therefore the (noise free) amplifier does not contribute 
to the noise factor. To find the noise factor, the exchangeable noise power densities 
from the source at Tq and from the two-port at the output terminals are found. 
This is done by finding the current in a short circuit over the output terminals from 
each of the three noise sources Gs-, Rn and Gn. The noise power density is then the 
sum of the three power densities which are each found by squaring the short circuit 
current and dividing by A/ and by four times the output conductance. This noise 
power density is also the noise power density of the source admittance at either 
Tq (the contribution from the source) or Tee (the contribution from the two-port 
transferred to the source) both multiplied by the exchangeable power gain of the 
two-port..

noise parameters and the source immittance.

4. Noise parameters
Equation (4.11), which is illustrated in Figure 4.6, and Equation (4.12) give 
information on the noise factor as a function of a chosen source immittance. If 
the minimum noise factor is the design criterion then Equation (4.17) or (4.21) 
determines the source immittance and Equation (4.16) or (4.20) gives the value of 
the minimum noise factor. If the source is active the Fernax gives the smallest noise 
factor for the stage.
Sometimes the values of Femin, ^SOF, and Rn are used as noise parameters and 
similarly with Fem.n, Zsof, and gn. This leads to

source admittances are possible only the right-hand side of the figure is of interest. 
From this figure the actual noise factors for different source admittances can be found. 
However, they can also be found directly from Equation (4.11). If Ys = 20 + j 0 mS 
then
Fe = 1 + -T (Gn + Rn |ys + K,|2)
= 1 + 4 (4'S + 0.025|20 + 2 + j7.5|2)
= 1.92 (2.82 dB)
The designer has now to decide whether the amplifier should be noise matched, which 
gives him an extra 0.27 dB, or if a noise figure of 2.82 dB is sufficient. A noise match 
should be with as little loss as possible, as any losses degrade the noise factor. In this 
case a loss of a quarter of a dB ruins as much as is gained. With transmission lines an 
almost lossless match can be performed. If the input frequency is 600 MHz an 83.7 rnm 
shorted 50 Q stub across the 20 mS source admittance and a 30.3 mm 50 Q lineiength 
to the amplifier will perform the noise match ( + r - 1). It should be noted that only a 
narrow band match has been performed.
Example 4.2 An amplifier with the noise parameters Rn = 20 Q, Gn — 6.4 mS, 
and ify = 2 + j 14 m.8 has a source impedance of 50 Q. By adding a lossless admittance

50
4. Noise parameters
(a susceptance) in parallel with the input of the amplifier the noise factor of the amplifier 
can be improved. In order to determine by how many decibels, the noise factor without 
this parallel admittance is computed as
FeoU = 1 + ~ (Gn + Rn\Ys + Y7|2)
= 1 + 
(6.4 + 0.020 [(20 + 2)2 + (0 + 14)2])
= 2.000
A lossless admittance in parallel with the input of the amplifier changes the source 
admittance from h's = 20 mS to Ys = Gs + j Ba where Ba is the value of the 
susceptance. If Ba is chosen such that Ba + B^ = 0 then the noise factor is at the 
local minimum. This means that B± = — By = -14 mS and the new value of the 
noise factor is
1 + ^0 (6-4 + 0020 ^20 + 2^2 + 1-14 + 14^]) 
= 1-804
From this it follows that the improvement in the noise figure is
2.000
AF[dB] = 
10 log = 0.448 dB
If instead of a lossless admittance a complete noise match is performed the Femin = 
1.800 could be obtained. It is, however, a much more complicated solution and the 
extra 0.010 dB, which theory gives, would almost certainly be lost in the real matching 
network's internal losses.
4.2 Noise power waves
As y and Z oarameters in. many applications have been replaced by S parameters 
it is natural to look for a set of noise parameters which are also based on the power 
waves formulation and could work conveniently together with the S parameters.
In order to use the Rothe and Dahlke equivalent from Figure 4.1 - redrawn in 
Figure 4.7 - in the power wave representation, the T parameters are chosen. The 
representation is in accordance with Kurokawa [10]. Without noise it follows that

multiplier. If f, = fc but there is a phase shift 6 between c,(t) and S(t), then if 
rz.(z) is low-pass-filtered, the output of the filter is proportional to sin 0. The circuit 
is now called a phase detector. If the output voltage uL(t) is followed by a tuned 
circuit centered at f, + nfc, we call the circuit a mixer and say that we have 
shifted or heterodyned the frequency f, to the new frequency + nfc.
1.7 FUNCTION GENERATION
rhe technique of function generation involves approximating the vi characteristic 
of a nonlinear device with connected straight-line segments and then utilizing 
diodes, resistors, and constant-voltage and constant-current sources to construct 
an equivalent circuit which realizes the piecewise-linear curve. The equivalent 
circuit is then amenable to standard circuit-analysis methods, especially for small 
signals, and graphical procedures are thus avoided.
An application of the use of function generators is to the solution of problems 
in which a nonlinear differential equation representing a physical system is to be 
solved using an analog computer. Nonlinear terms are approximated by piecewise- 
linear curves and synthesized. The complete problem is then solved electronically, 
and the result is plotted automatically or displayed on an oscilloscope.
Consider the two-segment approximation to the nonlinear characteristic awn 
in Fig. 1.7-1 as an example of the synthesis of a piecewise-linear circuit. Note

(4.43)
As shown in Figure 3.1, Definition 3.4 for a linear two-port states that is the 
noise temperature of the source with a noise free equivalent of the two-port which 
gives the same exchangeable output noise power as the (noisy) two-port with a noise 
free source. Figure 4.9 shows the two cases. There the reference impedance of the 
source is Zrs = and also the reference impedance of the load, Zr^ = ZJ. This 
is so that an easy connection of source, load and two-port can be achieved as shown 
in Figure 4.9 (b).

4.2.
In Equation (4.50), the noise waves are represented as (jan!2) and (j6n|2), which 
can be regarded as the available power of the ingoing and outgoing power waves at 
port 1, and as (a

It should be noted that the definitions, Equations (4.51) - (4.53), are the same as 
Meys’s [6,7]. They are, however, used in a different way. as shown in Equations 
(4.37) and (4.54) (for the real part of Zy positive). To distinguish them from each 
other, the indices have been chosen differently.
The extended noise factor as a function of the T noise parameters and the source 
reflection coefficient is found from inserting (4.54) into (3.12):

where = 0 corresponds to no correlation between the ingoing and outgoing noise 
power waves and T7 = \JTa T.j corresponds to full correlation.
4.2.2 T noise parameters
Another set of noise parameters - the T noise parameters which are T<y. Tj, and 
7\ explj yr^] - has been defined above and the extended effective noise temperature 
T3C expressed by the T noise parameters in Equation (1.54). TeK can also be written 
as circles for constant Tee in the source reflection coefficient plane. Equation (4.54) 
can be written as

When Tee is constant, then from Equation (3.12), Fe = 1 4- Tee/T0 is constant. 
Therefore circles can also be drawn for Fe constant with centre and radius given 
by substituting Tee = (Fe - l)7o from Equation (3.13) into Equations (4.58) and 
(4.59).
If R? = 0 then two extrema for Tee (or Fe) are determined. These and their 
corresponding source reflection coefficients are

Tee as a function of the source reflection coefficient, F< = |Fs| exp[j ps] is shown 
in Figure 4.10. When the magnitude of this reflection coefficient is kept constant, 
which corresponds to following a circle around the origin with radius |Fs| in Figure 
4.10, Tee as a function of the phase is

It is seen that Tee((ps) is sinusoidal with a mean value Tm given by TQ and and 
an amplitude Ta given by T7 and thus by the magnitude of the cross-correlation 
coefficient of the noise waves. An example of Tee((ps) is shown in Figure 4.11. If 
ips = — <p7 then Tee is minimum for a passive source immittance and maximum for 
an active source immittance.
When looking at Tee as a function of |Ts| with tps = - <p7, which corresponds 
to the line m in Figure 4.10, Equation (4.54) can be written as

Example 4.3 In Figure 4.10 the circles for constant Tes in the source reflection plane 
are drawn. These are constructed for a transistor with the following T noise parameters:

First Teemin and Teemax are found from Equations (4.60) and (4.64) to be 475 K and 
— 125 K respectively. Then for Tee > 475 K and Tee < —125 K the centres and radii 
of the circles of constant Tee are found from Equations (4.53) and (4.59). Some of the 
results are shown in Table 4.3. The two lines n and m are found as n goes through the 
origin and given by

Noise measure and graphic 
representations
In this chapter the extended effective noise temperature and the extended noise 
factor for cascaded single response two-ports are derived. Then the extended noise 
measure of a single response two-port is introduced. The behaviour of the extended 
gain and especially the extended noise measure in both the source admittance plane 
and the source reflection coefficient plane are treated in the last two sections.
5.1 Two-ports in cascade
Often amplifiers consist of two-ports in cascade. This section computes the extended 
noise factor and the extended noise temperature of two-ports in cascade.
Figure 5.1: Noisy two-ports in cascade.
The definition of extended effective noise temperature (Equation (3.4)) uses 
the exchangeable output noise power density for the amplifier alone (without noise 
from the source). Single response amplifiers mean that each two-port has only one 
exchangeable gain at the appropriate frequency, thus

In order to see how the signs behave the combination of two stages is examined. 
From Table 4.2 it is seen that Tee has the same sign as the source resistance Rs-

It is seen from Table 5.1 that the sign for Tee for a two-stage amplifier is the 
same as the sign of the source immittance. Taking these two two-ports as a single 
two-port and then adding another two-port, the combination of three two ports also

It is seen that the second stage has a rather high noise factor, but because of the also 
rather high gain of the first stage it does not spoil the combined noise factor very much. 
If a lossless matching network was added between the two amplifier stages in order to

transform the output admittance of the first stage to the optimum source admittance for 
minimum noise factor for the second stage the combined noise factor can be determined.

Example 5.2 An antenna with impedance 50 fl and noise temperature Ta = 2900 K 
is connected to an amplifier via a 50 fl cable. This cable has a loss of 1.76 dB and its 
temperature can be taken to be the standard temperature, Tq (17 °C). The noise factor 
of the amplifier is 1.8.
The 50 fl cable has a loss of 1.76 dB and as its temperature is To [K] it is seen 
from Example 3.2 that its noise factor is 1.50 ~ 1.76 dB and the gain is 1/1.50. For 
the combination of cable and amplifier, the result is

From this the operating noise temperature for the antenna - cable - amplifier combi­
nation referred to the antenna terminal is

2900 + 493 = 3393 - 3400 K
It should be noted that a rise in noise factor from 1.5 to 2.7 - which often should be 
avoided - is of no importance, when another noise source - here the antenna noise - is 
dominating.
5.2 The noise measure
Take two two-pons with extended noise factors Fej and FPt2 and exchangeable 
power gains Ge,}. and Ge,z and find out which cascade combination is best - the one 
with two-port one first or the one with two-port two first. Let the result be that

5.2. The noise measure
Fei2 < ^e2i- From Equation (5.5) it follows, for a passive source and Ge,i < 0 or 
> 1 and GSi2 < 0 or Gen > 1, that
It is seen that for two two-ports with a positive source immittance and an am­
plification which is either negative or greater than one, the choice should be the 
two-port with the smaller extended noise measure, Me, first, where the extended 
noise measure is defined by
If the source is chosen to be negative the same procedure shows that the negative 
noise measure closest to zero is the best. Haus and Adler [1] have extended the 
definition to the general case where Fe and Ge may differ from the conventional F 
and Ga and denoted this extended definition of noise measure by Me.
In the discussion of the noise performance of amplifiers, it turns out to be im­
portant to bear in mind the algebraic sign that Me assumes under various physical 
conditions. These are summarized in Table 5.2.

It should be noted that, for a passive source. A/e is positive for > 1. which 
corresponds to a normal amplifier, and for Ge < 0. which holds for an amplifier with 
negative real part of the output immittance. Also \F is negative when U < G’e < I 
which corresponds to an attenuator.

5. Noise measure and graphic representations
In contrast, when a post amplifier is specified and a single preamplifier is required 
to precede the postamplifier. then one preamplifier must be chosen from several 
possibilities [2]. Here the minimum noise measure does not give enough information 
for the choice. This is demonstrated by writing the expression for the noise factor 
of the cascaded arrangement as follows:
F 
- F 4. fe’2 - 1
■Te.l 2 - 4*e,l  + ——-----
- 1! nc--‘ ■

Suppose that a second stage is given. The second stage noise factor can be kept con­
stant at the minimum value of for example, by keeping the source immittance 
presented to stage two constant. Next, consider a candidate preamplifier with the 
real part of its output immittance positive. A lossless, passive two-port can be used 
to transform preamplifier output immittance to the value of stage two source im­
mittance for minimum Fe)2. In subsequent comparisons of preamplifier candidates, 
let a lossless two-port transforming network, such as discussed above, be included 
with each preamplifier, with the net result that Fe>2 stays constant at its minimum 
value. It is seen that, given a particular second stage (the postamplifier), the first 
stage should be chosen such that the expression 
(5.9)
is maximized.

Table 5.3 shows the noise factor of a cascaded amplifier for three cases of ex­
changeable gain of the first tw'o-port. Only the third case gives a lov/er noise factor 
for the cascaded amplifier. The first case in Table 5.3 corresponds to an attenuator; 

5.2. The noise measure
its noise measure is negative and the cascaded noise factor greater than Fe2. In 
the second case, the preamplifier has a noise measure greater than the excess noise 
factor (the noise factor minus one) of the second stage, and again the cascaded noise 
factor is greater than The third case is the normal case, where the first stage 
noise measure is less than the excess noise factor of the second stage. The cascaded 
noise factor is lower than Fe,2- Here it is interesting to note that, from preamplifiers 
with the same noise measure, the one with the highest gain should be chosen.
The noise measure for m cascaded two-ports is derived from Equations (5.7), 
(5.5), and (5.6) as
Me = Me,l —----------— GS|2<7S>3 ■ ■ • Ge,m
Cre — 1
+ Me,2 ~-1 (7e,3 ■ •

(5.10)
Cre — 1 
Lre — 1
or
It is, however, normally much simpler to find the cascaded noise measure by com­
puting the noise factor and the exchangeable gain of the cascaded two-ports and 
using the definition of the noise measure (Equation (5.7)).
When looking at this definition it is seen that
lim Me = Fe - 1 
Ge-*oo
This is also the case when cascading an infinite number of identical two-ports. Let 
these all have the noise factor Fe > 1 (~ a passive source) and gain Ge > 1, then
= i + (re - i) + (K - u(d-) + 
- n(^-) + •••
It should be noted that like the noise factor, the exchangeable gain, and other noise 
characteristics, the noise measure is also a function of the source immittance.
Example 5.3 This example illustrates the importance of the noise measure and the 
effect of matching. Consider three amplifiers having the following noise parameters:

As 0 < MCi2 < NLt3 < Afe.i the best amplifier is the one which consists of amplifier 
stages with the numbers 2-3-1.
If each amplifier in front of its input terminal has a network which transforms the 
10 mS of the source or the output admittance of the former amplifier to the optimum 
admittance for minimum noise factor then the order of the amplifiers is changed. This 
is demonstrated in the following:

It is interesting to note that the combination with matching networks generates about 
half as much noise power as the combination without matching networks.
5.3 Graphic representation in the admittance plane
In order to examine graphically the behaviour of the extended noise measure it 
is necessary to look at the involved parts, the extended noise factor and the ex­
changeable power gain. The extended noise factor is shown in Appendix C to be 
a hyperboloid of two sheets. The exchangeable power gain is examined before the 
extended noise measure is investigated. Fukui [31 was the first to be interested in 
this subject and the present work is an enlargement of Fukui 's work.

5. Noise measure and graphic representations
5.3.1 Graphic representation of the exchangeable power gain
The exchangeable power gain for a two-port can be expressed as a function of the 
two-port’s Y parameters and the source admittance as:
Re [(Ar + l^lsXln + Is)'] 
’ 
'
where Ay = 111122 — I12I21 and for any index the admittance Y = G + j B. 
Since the extended noise measure equation contains the exchangeable power gain 
as L/Gg the contours for 1/Ge as a function of 1$ are found by rewriting Equation 
(5.12) as follows:
IW 
Re[yt2r2i]
2 G’eC7'22 
2G22

where
Ra
IU2U1I2 + IU1I3

IW
4 GCG22
Re[y12y21]
(5-14)
and it is seen that when Rq > 0, the contours for constant 1/Ge (and thus constant 
Ge) are circles in the y$-plane. Extrema exist for 1/Ge if Rq = 0, or when
G; = -jyTjy (2G1^2 - ReMi]

is real. The latter requires that
JGfiG^ - 4GliG22Re[y2y21] (Im[y12r21])2 > 0 
(5.i6)
This inequality is equivalent to k2 > 1, where k = 1/(7 (G ~ Linvill’s factor) is a 
common stability factor

When k2 < 1. R2G > 0 for all values of 1/Ge; so there are no extrema for 1/GE.

Extrema of Me(Ys) can be found by setting the partial derivatives with respect to 
Gs and Bs equal to zero. This yields two equations of fourth order in Gs and 
Bs with no explicit analytical solutions. As the expressions for both Fe and l/G^ 
are represented by circles, the theory of linear transformations of analytic functions 
shows that Equation (5.23) must also represent circles and can be written as
(Gs - Gcm)2 + (Bs - BCmY = R2m

Equation (5.24) is valid when R2vf > 0. By examining Equations (5.24) - (5.27) 
and by setting the expression in curly brackets in Equation (5.27) equal to A + 
B Ms + C where C < 0, the following conclusions can be drawn:
I. (GcM^'h), Bcm (Me)) is on a straight line in the Ys plane:

it is seen that Ms(Gcm) is monotonic with one pole.

^Z12|2 + |y2i|2 - 4GnG22 + 2Re[y12y31] > 0

extrema will exist for Me. The signs for the extrema are different because 
— 4 AC > 0 and thus |£?1 < V B2 — 4 AC. Note that the condition of 
Equation (5.30) is the same as that for R& > 0 when L/Ce = .1.
4. When A < 0, |B| > VB2 - 4.AC whenever B2 - 4 A C > 0, so that
the signs for the extrema are the same.
5. Calling the extrema Mei and Me2 where Me i > Ms2, the range for Me is
Me > Mei > 0 and Me < Mei < 0 for A > 0
Me2 < Me < Mei where sgnfLMei] = sgn[Me2] for A < 0
Figures 5.4 and 5.5 indicate the behaviour of the noise neasure. The extreme 
values are found from Equation (5.27) by setting R\r = 0, and the corresponding 
optimum source admittance, Fsom, from Equations (5.25) and (5.26).
5.4 Graphic representation in the reflection plane
As in the former section the exchangeable gain and the extended noise measure can 
be illustrated as functions of the source reflection coefficient. As these quantities 
are ail traced as circles in the source admittance plane it follows from the theory 
of linear transformations of analytic functions that they should also be generalized 
circles (a circle, a straight line, or a point) in the plane of the source reflection 
coefficient. This section examines the behaviour of Ge and Me as functions of the 
source reflection coefficient.

This means that either F^og or Fsog1 13 passive while the other is active. The 
special case, when |Fsqg| - IFsog'I - E requires that Re[Zs] = 0. As the 
exchangeable gain is defined only for Re[Zs] 0 the unit circle is excluded from 
the region of definition. It is also seen that

One important thing about the location of Tgr is that it is located just midway 
between Fsog and T^og' which is seen from Equations (5.40) and (5.44):
Another characteristic of r?r is that it is always located on or outside the unit 
circle. This is seen from

q. e. d.
For k2 < 1 it follows that Rq > 0 for all values of Ge. It can be shown that 
different circles corresponding to different constant Ge values all intersect each other 
in two points on the unit circle for k2 < 1 and in one point on the unit circle for 
k2 = 1. In these points Ge is not defined as Ge is not defined on the unit circle.

5.4.2 Graphic representation of the extended noise measure

As AL can be illustrated as circles for constant Ms in the admittance plane 
it follows from the theory of analytic functions that Me also can be illustrated as 
circles in the source reflection coefficient plane. Equation (5.53) can be written as 
a set of circles:

Here it is seen that two extrema exist as 52 — 4AC > 0. As A < 0 and 
C < 0 it follows that |2?| > a/S2 - 4 AC and thus the signs for the extrema 
are the same. It is also seen that the range for Me is between the extrema.

From Equation (4.56) it is seen that C < 0 which is important to remember in 
the following:
1. A > 0
When A > 0 then B2 - 4 AC > 0. This means that there exist two extrema 
for Afe. It is also seen that |jB| < \/jB2 - 4 A C from which it follows that the 
signs of the extrema are different. As A is positive it is seen from Equation 
(5.57) that R2^ is negative between the two roots and thus Memtn > 0 and 
Msmax < 0. This yields

Noise of embedded networks
Noise parameters of a transistor or another active element are often given in data­
sheets, but what happens if bias network, feedback elements, or other external 
elements are added to the original network? This is the subject of this chapter where 
lumped elements, distributed elements, and combinations of two-ports are analyzed. 
Then an example is given of a two-port with feedback via two transformers in such 
a way that the rules analyzed in section 6.1 do not apply. Only three-poles are 
considered, as most active elements have three poles which are the common reference 
terminal, the input and the output terminals. Therefore formulae for transformation 
of noise parameters from common emitter or source to common collector or drain 
and to common base or gate are given. Finally, some thoughts on computer aided 
design of linear circuits with noise are expressed.
6.1 Lumped embedding
Consider a three-pole network as in Figure 6.1 to which linear and lumped one-ports 
such as resistors, capacitors, and inductors are added by a number of successive par­
allel and series connections. It will be convenient to define “embedded’’ and “em­
bedding” networks. The original network is called the embedded network (denoted 
by 1, 2, and 3 in Figure 6.1), and the linear one-ports are called the embedding 
network. The resulting netw'ork is also a three-pole network (denoted by 1', 2\ and 
3'). A practical way to obtain the new signal parameters of such a network can be 
explained as follows. Add the first set of parallel admittances to rhe Y parameters of 
the embedded network. Transform the resulting Y parameters to Z parameters and 
add the first set of series impedances. Then transform the resulting Z parameters 
back again to Y parameters and add the second set of parallel elements. Continue 
this procedure until complete 11.2 s.
The noise parameters of the composite network are computed in a similar way.

6. Noise of embedded networks
Figure 6.1: Three-pole embedded in lumped one-ports.
Like signal parameters, noise parameters have several forms as shown in Chapter 4. 
The most useful forms of this application are the equivalent II and T noise two-ports 
introduced by Rothe and Dahlke [3] and examined in Chapter 4. The transforma­
tion procedure is as follows. First, compute the noise parameters (in fl form which 
corresponds to Y parameters) of the network consisting of the embedded network 
(with its noise parameters in II form) and the first set of parallel elements. Trans­
form the resulting noise parameters to T form, and combine the noise parameters (in 
F form ) of the resulting network with those of the first set of added series elements. 
Then transform the resulting noise parameters back to fl form and add the effect 
of the second set of parallel elements, continuing this procedure until complete.
Since the admittance of a parallel element and the impedance of a series element 
may be zero, it is possible to compute the signal and noise parameters of a rather 
general class of embedding networks (feedback, biasing, stray elements etc.).
The formulae, which are derived in [1], are given below. The unprimed entities 
are the small signal and noise parameters of the three-port without new embedding, 
and the primed entities are the parameters with a set of embedding elements.

parameters and noise parameters are measured. The effect of (the known) stray 
capacitors and stray inductors can be removed by adding the negative of the stray 
elements. This is done such that the stray elements closest to the terminals of the 
encapsulated transistor are removed first and then the second set of stray elements 
until finally the small signal and noise parameters of the transistor chip are obtained.

Figure 6.2: Transistor with bias and feedback and equivalent circuit. Capacitors are 
considered as shorts at the working frequency.
Example 6.1 A transistor amplifier stage as seen in Figure 6.2 consists of a transistor 
with known Y and noise parameters and also bias and load resistors and finally a series 
feedback resistor. The data for the transistor are
Tn = 10 T J 2.1 mS 
Y12 = 0.5 — j 0.866 mS 
y2l = 125 - j 29 mS 
y22 = 1 + 7 3 mS
= 25 n
These data give Fmin = 1.8 and Ysof - Id - j 7.5mS. In order to compute the small 
signal and noise parameters of the stage, one has to apply Equations (6.22) - (6.28) 
to get the transistor data into Z form. Then Equations (6.8) - (6.14) add the series 
feedback resistor (while ZA = Ze = 0 + j' 0). Equations (6.15)- (6.21) transform to 

106
6. Noise of embedded networks
the Y parameters and Equations (6.1) - (6.7) add the bias and collector resistor (with 
Yb — 0). The final result, computed with a Fortran program where the equations used 
are shown as subroutines in Appendix D, is:
Ku = 1.586 4- j 1.548 mS 
r12 = 0.4448 - j 1.017 mS
Yii = 25.162.935 mS
Y22 = 0-2837 j 1.469 mS
Rn = 62.81 Q
Gn = 4.735 mS
Y^ = 3.442 4- j 3.432 mS
This corresponds to Fmin = 2.606 and Y$of = 9.340 - 3.432 mS. The main part 
of this noise degregation is due to the series feedback. The bias and collector resistors 
raise the noise factor only slightly - from 1.800 to 1.807.
Figure 6.3: Feedback elements for simultaneous input power match and noise optimization.
Example 6.2 An optimization procedure for simultaneous input power match and 
noise optimization using only one series and one shunt feedback element as shown in 
Figure 6.3 has been developed. Since lossless feedback does not change the value of 
the minimum noise measure (does not add noise), only lossless elements are considered. 
The fact that is constant for lossless feedback is a convenient check on results of 
computer programs. What does change, of course, is the value of the source admittance, 
Isn.V.- for minimum noise measure.
For each pair of lossless feedback elements a computer program - using the subrou­
tines in Appendix D - gives the values for the primed signal and noise parameters from 
Equations (6.1) - (6.28). The minimum noise measure, Afemtn, and the corresponding 
source admittance, Y$om, from Equations (5.27). (5 25) and (5.26) are also computed.

Figure 6.4: Transducer gain Gt (full lines) and load admittance Gl, Bl (dotted lines) 
versus lossless feedback for unity VSWR and minimum noise measure.
When the source admittance, Y$ — Ysom’s determined, input power matching occurs 
when the load admittance, Yl, is chosen to satisfy the relation:
Yl
— Y'22 d-
V12121
1/11 -
This equation allows choosing the load admittance for input power match and minimum 
noise measure (Ilom)- Then, with the source and load admittances equal to Ysom 
and Vrriyr respectively, the transducer gain, G'r, of the stage is computed.
From these results various parameter curves are drawn with the values of the lossless 
feedback elements as coordinates. Such a graph is shown in Figure 6.4, where the 
real and imaginary parts of the load admittance and the transducer gain for that load 
admittance are the parameters. The graph is to be read as follows.
Each point in the graph assigns a load admittance {Gl ? Hl) a feedback pair 
{Bf , X/) such that input matching and minimum noise measure are attained simulta­

neously. The corresponding transducer gain can also be read from Figure 6.4.
It should be noted that simultaneous input power match and minimum noise measure 
without feedback can only be obtained with a transducer gain less than one. With only 
series feedback (X/ = 12 0) the optimization is obtained with a transducer gain of 
about 11.5 dB.
Lehmann and Heston [4] have constructed an integrated low noise amplifier on X- 
band using this technique.

disappear. This is done by applying Equations (6.1) - (6.7). Using Equations (6.22) - 
(6.28) the Z parameters appear. Then the resistances and inductances in series with 
the intrinsic transistor are removed by adding the negative amount in Equations (6.8)

6.2 Reference plane transformation of noise parame­
ters
When working with noise parameters it is often convenient to know them at a ref­
erence plane different from that where the noise parameters are actually measured. 
This is a kind of embedding as a piece of transmission line in front of a transistor can 
be considered as an embedding element. The result leads to the noise parameters 
of a transmission line as a two-port. In the next section this two-port can be an 
embedding element in parallel or in cascade with other two-ports. In this section, 
formulae are presented for transformation of noise parameters along a transmission 
line with known characteristic impedance and known attenuation and phase con­
stants. It is assumed, however, that the temperature of the transmission line is the 
standard noise temperature of 290 K [5].
When calculating the noise performance of an active element embedded in pas­
sive circuit elements, it is necessary, at microwave frequencies, to include distributed 
elements as well as lumped elements. The most significant distributed element with 
respect to noise performance is the transmission line leading to the first active el­
ement. This section considers the noise parameters of a network consisting of a 
transmission line with known constants preceding an active two-port with known 
noise parameters. The result can be used to transform the noise parameters mea­
sured in one reference plane to another along the known transmission line. The 
transformation works both ways; it adds the additional noise contribution when the 
transmission line is made longer and subtracts noise when the reference plane is 
moved closer to the active two-port. This feature is useful when correcting mea­
sured noise data of an active two-port and is carried out by adding a ‘‘negative’’ 
length of transmission line.

Transformation of noise parameters through a lossy transmission line
Equations (6.29 s - (6.32) are derived in the following. With reference to Figure 6.6 
the problem can be stated as follows: find the (new) noise parameters at reference 
plane A expressed by the (old and known) noise parameters at reference plane B 
and the transmission bne constants i, Zq (real and positive) and 7 = o + j d. First, 
all immittances are normalized to Zo or Yb = 1/Zq:

of .a source admittance and a transmission line at the temperature To, generates 
noise as the real part of Y$ at Tq. The denominator 7" represents that part of the

Figure 6.7: Generator with shorted transmission line and equivalent circuit.
The only remaining unknown in Equation (6.34) is now g$. Some of the noise 
power generated in the source is dissipated in the lossy transmission line, and as 
one only has to consider the noise generated in the source all other noise sources are 
eliminated. The relation between the short circuit noise current at B (see Figure 
6.7) and g” is

Equation (6.34) is now completely determined by the known noise p.»ramotcrs g

expressed in Equation (6.35), and g^ is expressed in Equation (6.40), in terms of 
only al, /3l and ys.
With Equations (6.35) and (6.40) this expression for the noise factor must, for 
all ys = gs 4- j bs, be identically equal with the noise factor expression in Equation 
(6.33), and it is thus possible to determine the new noise parameters in terms of 
the old ones and the transmission Line data by choosing four values of ys and then 
solving the four identity equations for the new normalized noise parameters. The 
results are:

noise parameters:

the noise performance of a preceding transmission line of a length up to half a wavelength 
(A/2) and three different attenuation constants (o = 0.0, 0.3 and 0.6 Np/A) has been 
computed and expressed by Equations (4.84) - (4.86) as

and Rr.
The noise parameters as functions of normalized length and with the attenuation 
constant a as parameter are shown in Figure 6.8(a), (b) and (c). One obvious use of 
this figure is to choose a length of the transmission line which makes the real part of 
Ysof — 20 mS. Then the imaginary part can be removed by a stub and the transmission 
line two-port combination has optimum noise performance for Y's — 20 mS. Another 
possibility is to choose the imaginary part of Yso? — 0 S and then add a quarter wave 
transmission line transformer. This also gives a match with optimum noise figure, but, 
of course, both cases are narrow band matchings.
6.2.1 The equivalent noise two-port of a lossy transmission line
The results above can be used to derive the equivalent noise two-port of a lossy 
transmission line. Consider two two-ports in cascade. The first is the transmission 
line and the second is a lossless line of length zero. The noise parameters of the 
second two-port are all zero. The noise parameters of the transmission line are then 
derived from the Equations (6.29) - (6.32) letting 7cn, Gn and Yy be equal to zero. 
Thus for a lossy transmission line the parameters are
— sinh 2a I 
(6.45)

It has been shown above that the minimum noise factor is obtained for a source 
admittance equal to the characteristic admittance for the transmission line and that 
the noise factor rises exponentially with the loss factor a and with the length I of 
the transmission line.
6.3 Noise parameters of interconnected two-ports
A network consisting of linear two-ports each with known small signal and noise 
parameters can often be replaced by one two-port with small signal and noise pa­
rameters derived from the individual parameters. The small signal parameters are 
computed by general circuit theory and for the noise parameters two methods exist.
One of these methods is to use the definition for the extended noise factor for 
a two-port, Equation (3.6), or for the extended effective noise temperature, Equa­
tion (3.4). In these equations the output noise power density is computed from 
contributions from the noise parameters, the source and perhaps some one-ports. 
The same result is then computed from the unknown noise parameters of the total 
circuit. The tw’o results must be identically equal tn each other for all values of the 
source immittance, and by chousing four values of this source immittance the four 
resulting equations may be solved for the new noise parameters.
The other method, introduced by Albinsson [6], consists of two parts. The first 
part aims at transforming the noise parameters of each individual two-port one at 

6.3. Noise parameters of interconnected two-ports

a time to the input of the overall two-port, replacing the other individual two-ports 
with their noise free equivalents. The second part is to combine these individual 
two-ports to a noise two-port for the resulting network and from this extract the 
resulting noise parameters.
The first of these two methods is used for the case of two parallel connected 
two-ports and for two two-ports in cascade. The first part of Albinsson’s method is 
dependent on the circuit configuration, but the second part is very general and will 
be examined in this section.
6.3.1 Two-ports in parallel
Equations have been derived for two two-ports in parallel. Each two-port is de­
scribed by the chain or ABCD parameters and by the Rn. Gn and noise param­
eters. If more two-ports are connected in parallel they can be combined by taking 
two at a time until complete. The parameters from one two-port are all primed and 
from the other double-primed. The resulting parameters are unprimed.
Figure 6.9: Two noisy two-ports in parallel and equivalent circuit.
The two circuits in Figure 6.9 nave the same excess noise factor which with 
parameters from the combined circuit is expressed as
Fc - 1 = N (Gn + Rn'\r's + Vi2) 
(6.51)
6$
The excess noise factor can also be expressed as the ratio of the noise power density 
at the output from, noise generators belonging to the two two-ports, to the output

noise power density from the source. As it is the ratio of power densities and as 
they are proportional to the square of the output short circuit current, the excess

line in series with a feedback element the noise parameters of the feedback two- 
port should be computed first. It is therefore necessary to investigate the noise 
parameters of two-ports in cascade.
6.3.2 Two-ports in cascade
The same procedure as above is used for calculating the noise parameters for the 
equivalent two-port of two two-ports in cascade. Again, if more two-ports are in 
cascade, they are taken two at a time. Let the small signal and noise parameters of 
the first two-port be primed, and let the parameters of the second be double-primed. 
The resulting parameters are unprimed.
Figure 6.10: Two noisy two-ports in cascade and equivalent circuit.
Computing the noise currents just after the second-stage noise two-port (and 
thus before the noise free equivalent of the second stage, which does not add more 
noise power but only amplifies it with the same amplification), gives

Equations (6.56) - (6.58) can be used to compute the noise parameters of a 
feedback element which includes two-ports such as transmission lines used to connect 
one or two lumped feedback elements. The total feedback element can then be 
connected in parallel with a transistor and the noise parameters are computed by 
Equations (6.53) - (6.55).
6.3.3 Albinsson’s method of interconnected two-ports
This method is divided into two parts. In the network of two-ports the noise pa­
rameters of each two-port in the first part is transformed to the input side of the 
resulting network as the noise parameters Rn,i, and Y7>1-. This part is dependent 
of the network configuration and must be performed individually for the network 
considered. As the network is linear the superposition principle is valid and the 
second part is to perform this superposition.
In order to investigate this second part it should be kept in mind that the noise 
parameters used by Albinsson are the II noise parameters from [3] which are based 
on Figure 4.2. The noise voltage en is the summation of the transferred noise 
voltages en>i and noise current in is the summation of the transferred noise currents 
inti, thus
(6.59)
(6.60)
As the voltages from the different two-ports are uncorrelated it follows from Equa­
tions (2.13) and (2.6) that

it follows that

and, as noise from the different two-ports is uncorrelated,

(6.67)

This is another way to compute the noise parameters Rn (Equation (6.61)), 
(Equation (6.62)) and Gn (Equation (6.67)) of interconnected two-ports.
6.3.4 Matrix formulation
Hillbrand and Russer [7] have made a matrix formulation of parallel, series and 
cascade connections of linear, noisy two-ports. The noisy two-ports are represented 
either by an admittance representation with a noise free part and two noise current 
sources, or by an impedance representation with two noise voltage sources, or by a 
chain representation with a noise current source and a noise voltage source both at 
the input side. These representations are shown in Figure 6.11.
The noise free circuit matrices are the r*.  Z and chain or ABCD matrices, and 
the correlation matrices are - in the same order - given by

where A/ is the bandwidth, the factor 2 occurs because the two-sided Fourier trans­
form has been used and {• - •) denotes the ensemble average over processes with 
identical statistical properties.2
Often the correlation matrices can be calculated without knowing the noise 
sources. If the two-port considered consists of only passive elements the thermal 
noise from it results in a correlation matrix of either of the two forms:
CY = 2kTRe[Y]
Cz = 2kTRe[Z]
where k = 1.38 X ICT23 J K-i is Boltzmann’s constant and T [K] is the noise 
temperature of the two-port.
For active two-ports the chain correlation matrix is given by

where /?n is the equivalent noise resistance, F:;rjn is the minimum noise factor and
Y$OF is tbe corresponding source admittance.
These matrices can be transformed to any of the three forms by
C = tct*
(6.72)
See Appendix A.

This method can be used instead of section 6.1 as demonstrated in [7]. It is also 
useful when active two-ports are interconnected.

6. Noise of embedded networks
In a more recent paper Dobrowolski [8] has used a wave representation! and en­
larged the network to be considered. His network consists of interconnected passive 
multiports which introduce only thermal noise and active linear two-ports. It is also 
a requirement that the two-ports are interconnected two and two. Dobrowolski’s 
results are applicable to computer aided design of noisy microwave circuits.
6.4 Calculating noise parameters from deembedded 
data
*
Pucel et al. [9] have shown a procedure to calculate noise parameters as functions of 
frequency for field effect transistors, FET’s, and high electron mobility transistors, 
HEMT's. This is especially important at frequencies so high that it is very difficult 
to measure the noise parameters. If the noise parameters at one frequency and 
the parasitic elements of a transistor (with its encapsulation) are well known, the 
intrinsic elements and noise generators with their correlation can be computed by 
deembedding. As for FET’s and HEMT’s these noise parameters are approximately 
independent of frequency and the behaviour of the intrinsic equivalent circuit is well 
known, so it is possible to compute the S and noise parameters in a large frequency 
range. Thus computation replaces measurement which is a great advantage as noise 
parameter measurements are rather difficult at frequencies above 10 - 20 GHz. The 
authors claim sufficient accuracy up to at least 40 GHz.
6.4.1 Matrix formulation of the deembedding procedure

correlation matrices of the packaged device, Cpc{, and the intrinsic device, C^, are

related by the linear matrix equation
Cpd = PCpP' + DCdDi
where Cp denotes the admittance correlation matrix of the packaged four-port 
and P and D represent package and device transformation matrices exprcssibb
*
 
in terms of the admittance parameters of the package and device. The dairsmr 
denotes the Hermitian (conjugate transpose) of the associated matrix. Equation 
(6.81) is used when the intrinsic parameters are embedded in parasitic elements of 
the encapsulation.
Deembedding is performed by solving Equation (6.81) for C^:
Cd = D-\Cpd - PCpP^D^ 
(6.82)
Under special conditions the matrix D may not possess an inverse, and the deem­
bedding procedure fails. This may occur when certain non-reciprocal elements, such 
as isolators, are considered part of the package.
In order to find the matrix transformation matrices P and D in terms of the K 
parameters of the package and the active device, some quantities are defined:
Yp : four-port admittance matrix of the package.
Yd : two-port admittance matrix of the active device.
Ypd : two-port admittance matrix of the packaged device.
Cp : noise correlation matrix of the package.
C.i : noise correlation matrix of the active device.
Cpd : noise correlation matrix of the packaged device.
rip : vector of the noise current sources of the package.
jd ' vector of the noise current sources of the active device.
A : identity matrix of order k.
In Figure 6.13 the active device is shown with noise current generators and 
terminal currents and voltages. In Figure 6.1 1 the package is showm with two ports 
to the outside world and two ports to khe active device. It is seen that the active 
device is a two-port, the package a four-port and the packaged device a two-port.
The terminal voltages and currents of the package can be divided into two groups 
one belonging to the external ports (with subscript e) and another belonging to

and

6.4. Calculating noise parameters from deembedded data

In the same manner the package noise source matrices are defined:
n
The admittance matrix of the package is partitioned into four *2  x 2 siibmatricos:
and the signal and noise nodal equations for the package can be expressed in terms 
of the above vectors and matrices either succinctly as
i = Ypv 4- n.p 
(6.84)
or in partitioned form as
ig — TggVe T- u. T 
(b.85)
i, = Yteve 4- Ylzvt 4- npt 
(6.86)
A similar procedure is followed for the active device. With reference to Figure 
6.13 the following current and voltage vectors are defined:
• 
C13 
V43 
• 
ji
L14 J 
[ Kfl ]

and the nodal equations for the active device can be written as
. ii = YiVd 4- jd 
(6.87)
Applying the boundary conditions
id =

to Equation (6.87). inserting (6.87) into (6.86) and solving for the following 
equation is obtained:
r; = 
— (Y. 4- Yd! \ Kr- t’r 4- nri i jC) 
(6.88)
Inserting Equation (6.88) into (6.85) gives

This formula can also be written as

6. Noise of embedded networks
(6.89)
where the first term represents the signal component of the current and the second 
term the noise component. It is evident that Ye represents the admittance matrix 
of the two-port packaged device. It is given by the expression
Ye = Yse 4*  D Yie
J Please note that the statistical noise averages, hence correlation matrices, are normalized to
2 A To Af, where A = 1.38 x 1G-7'1 j K'1 is Boltzmann:s constant, To == 290 K is the standard 
noise temperature and A/ is the noise bandwidth in Hz. The factor 2 (instead of 4) is chosen
because both positive and negative frequencies are included, fn any case, this factor cancels out in 
the final noise parameter expressions.
(6.90)
where the matrix D is defined as
D = -Ye:(Yt + Y/)-1 2
(6.91)
The noise matrix term in denotes the sum of the contributions of the package 
and the active device. In matrix form it can be represented as
in = P np -r Djd 
(6.92)
where
P 
= [7JP] 
(6.93)
Now the correlation noise matrix of the packaged device
CPd 
= (i„<) 
(6.94)
where (•••) denotes the ensemble average over processes with identical statistical 
properties.3 As no correlation exists between the noise sources in the device and 
the package,
. 
Cpd = P (np nJ) + D D1 
(6.95)
The definitions
Cp = 
(np7?) and Cj - O?JP) 
(6.96)
lead to 
Cpd = PC?P! + DCjV<
(6.97)
which is Equation (6.81). This equation can be reduced to one involving matrices 
of order 2 only, when Cp is partitioned in the same way as YP (Equation (6.83)).
Cpd = Cee + DCie 4- 
~ D(Czt + Cd) 
(6.98)

6.4. Calculating noise parameters from deembedded data
129
The deembedding procedure is to find Cj from (6.98) and thus
Cd = D" (Cpi - C^D'-1 - Cie Df- D~L Ce,- C„ (6.99)
This equation is equivalent to (6.82) but it includes only matrices of order 2. 
It now remains to find the expressions for the correlation matrices CPd and C.9 for 
the packaged device and the package in order to be able to compute the correlation 
matrix Cd for the device from (6.99).
Twiss [10] has shown that for a linear and passive network, such as the package, 
which generates only thermal noise, its noise correlation matrix is
It should be noted that this equation does not require reciprocity, but in the rest of 
this section reciprocity is assumed.
Hillbrand and Russer [7] have shown how the noise correlation matrix in AB CD 
form relates to the noise parameters. Let CA denote this correlation matrix. From 
[7] or Equation (6.71) it is seen that

by
Cpd = V CA vf
(6.105)
where V is expressed in terms of elements of the admittance matrix Y7 (Equation 
(6.90)) as
The reverse transformation is given by

In many cases this deembedding procedure, which here is performed with matrix 
algebra, can be performed as shown in Example 6.3 in section 6.1 and in section 
6.2, where sections of transmission line in a similar way can be removed from the 
encapsulation by adding the negative lengths.
6.4.2 Calculating noise parameters at a new frequency
Now the correlation matrix of the active device C4 is known at one frequency. Since 
the two-port is linear it is possible to write Cd as a superposition of two terms:
Cd = TNf + SNtS^ 
(6.114)
where T and S are transformation matrices which are functions of the equivalent 
circuit parameters. Nt represents the thermal noise contributions included with the 
active device and is known from the equivalent circuit parameters. N represents 
the noise from the noise generators in the intrinsic transistor and from [11] Equation 
(6.114), N can be expressed as
N = 
SN.S^Tf-' 
(6.113)
Now consider a frequency change. The frequency dependence of N is known.1 
/Vf represents thermal noise and thus the noise generators are independent of fre­
quency, hut rhe inttuence of frequency dependent elements shapes the noise spectra 
of the thermal noise generators in their transformation to the reference planes cor 
responding to the matrix Nt. The transformation matrices, T and S, should also

6.5 Transformer coupled feedback
Consider an active two-port with feedback consisting of two transformers - one 
connected to give voltage series feedback and the other to give current parallel 
feedback as shown in Figure 6.15. Let the two transformers be identical. This type 
of circuit is often used but how does its noise two-port look? Neither of the above 
mentioned methods leads to a result.
Figure 6.15: Amplifier with double feedback.
The method used here is to compute the noise factor of the circuit in Figure 
6.15 and also to compute the noise factor of its equivalent circuit with the unknown 
noise two-port. As these two noise factor expressions are identical the new (primed) 
noise parameters can be found by setting the two expressions equal for four different 
values of source admittances with the real part positive. This method has also been 
used to get the results in section 6.1.
In Figure 6.15 the two transformers are characterized by their Z parameters and 
the transistor by its F parameters;

impedances of the two inductances and the mutual inductance. The noise currents 
and voltages are all uncorrelated and the equivalent noise two-port of the amplifier 
is shown. The noise currents and voltages are determined from the noise parameters 
by Equations (2.7) and (2.9).
As the noise sources are uncorrelated, the noise factor equals the sum of the out­
put noise powers originating from the noise sources and from the source at standard 
noise temperature divided by the output noise power from the source at standard 
noise temperature. There are seven noise sources and each of them gives a contri­
bution to the output noise power. Eight (numbered) equations can be written as 
follows where the right sides of seven of the equations are either zero or contain a 
noise source:

6.6 Mixed input
in older to obtain a low noise factor and simultaneously a good input power match, 
it is sometimes the practice to ground the input transistor somewhere between the 
base and the emitter and thus apply the input signal to both base and emitter by 
means of a lossless transformer as shown in Figure 6.16.
For such a circuit the noise parameters ran be calculated by expressing the output 
noise power density with the source at standard noise temperature, and from this an 
expression can be made for Fe. This expression is identically equal to the standard 
expression for Fe (Equation (4.11)) for all source admittances and thus the following 
equations are found:

Noise computations in computer aided design pro­
grams
One type of popular optimization program comprises those based on the adjoint 
network. Without going into detail it is clear that uncorrelated noise contributions 
should be added as powers or power densities. Every one-port contains one noise 
generator which is uncorrelated to the other noise sources as they are physically 
separated. The two-ports contain two partly correlated noise generators which are 
separated into the equivalent noise two-port as shown in Chapter 4 and thus t­
wo uncorrelated- sources and a correlation immittance emerge. As equivalent noise 
multi-ports have not yet been developed to contain uncorrelated sources it is neces­
sary to include correlation matrices.
Dobrowolski’s book on computer methods for microwave circuit analysis and 
design [16] includes linear noise computation of one-, two- and multi-ports.

Noise in non-linear systems: Theory
This chapter deals with the theory of time invariant non-linear noisy multi-port 
non-autonomous systems. The type of non-linear system considered may contain 
non-linear one- and multi-port non-linear elements and subsystems, the internal 
noise sources may be unmodulated (independent) or modulated (dependent), the 
system may contain de sources, and the multiple signal input ports may be excited 
by multiple finite energy1 signals (also de) and noise. The method of analysis is 
based on the use of Volterra series which requires an equivalent circuit description 
of the non-linear noisy system. The main objective of the present chapter is to 
derive expressions for the noise and deterministic response at arbitrary response 
ports in the situation where low level noise is analyzed. Low level noise refers to the 
situation where the noise is a small perturbation of the deterministic signed regime. 
This means that the non-linear contributions caused by a non-linear mixing of noise 
with noise are insignificant.

7.1 Introduction
For non-linear systems the principle of superposition is not valid. This, as a con­
sequence, implies that the (non-linear) transfer function seen from a given noise 
source in a system to a given output response port does not only depend on the 
system itself but also on the applied deterministic signals. This makes non-linear 
noise analysis much more complicated than noise analysis of linear systems. The 
purpose of the present chapter is to develop a method to analyze low level noise 
in general time invariant non-linear multi-port non-autonomous systems — gener­
al in the sense that the equivalent noise free system may be described by a finite 
(convergent) multi-port Volterra series. This suggests that the type of system al­
lows- (i) multiple input ports which can be excised by both deterministic signals
143

7. Noise in non-linear systems: Theory
(also de) and noise, (ii) internal de sources in the system, (iii) multiple unmodulat­
ed (independent.) internal noise sources, and (iv) multiple modulated (dependent) 
internal noise sources which may be modulated by multiple arbitrary deterministic 
signals. The system may have an arbitrary number of responses (or more generally, 
arbitrary system variables) which may be, e.g., voltages or currents at any node 
or branch respectively in the underlying network. The low level noise assumption 
implies that only systems which are small signal linear may be analyzed — this 
means that contributions caused by non-linear mixing of noise with noise have to 
be insignificant. However, most of the known devices are small signal linear. Also 
de sources in the system are allowed. Traditionally, de analysis has not been used 
in relation to Volterra series analysis. This is because (i) it has not previously been 
possible to analyze multi-port systems, which is required when de is applied not 
only to the signal input port, and (ii) Vol terra series have traditionally only been 
used for weakly non-linear systems in which case the influence of the deterministic 
signals on the de due to non-linear phenomena is insignificant.
The objective of the present chapter is to determine the ensemble cross-correlation 
(or autocorrelation) between response Fourier series coefficients at two arbitrary fre­
quencies at arbitrary response ports. This makes it possible to determine average 
noise powers and average noise power densities wffiich are used extensively in noise 
analysis. Practical applications are expected to be in the analysis and optimization 
of noise in mixers with moderate local oscillator levels, interconnected mixers and 
oscillators, some types of frequency multipliers (e.g. FET types), oscillators (once 
the oscillation frequency and amplitude are determined, using e.g. [1,2]), and com­
munications systems. The theoretical work may also be used in a combined analysis 
of intermodulation and noise, and to analyze the noise properties when more compli­
cated deterministic excitations (multiple sinusoidal excitations) are used. Another 
possible application is in the development of non-linear models of various devices.
The chapter is organized as follows. Section 7.2 presents preliminaries regarding 
the type of system which is under consideration and discusses the mathematical rep­
resentation of deterministic signals and noise in the frequency domain. Section 7.3 
outlines a method which can be used to represent modulated (dependent) as well 
as unmodulated (independent) noise sources. Lastly in Section 7.4 expressions are 
derived for the responses of a non-linear noisy multi-port system.
7.2 Preliminaries
Two major prerequisites for the analysis of noise in non-linear systems are to con­
sider (i) the system description, and (ii) the mathematical representation of noise 
and deterministic signals. These two problems are treated in the present section.

7.2. P relimi naries

7.2.1 System description
The type of system under consideration is shown in Figure 7.1. This is a time invari­
ant non-linear non-autonomons multi-port system with multiple internal unmodu­
lated and modulated noise sources, and the system may also contain de sources. 
For the analysis it is required that an equivalent circuit description of the non­
linear noisy system is available. That is, a detailed non-linear network descrip­
tion of the system must be available. The system is excited by J input signals 
{.^1(/), • • •, 
applied at ports {(£, 1),.... (z, J)} — these signals may all
include deterministic signals (also de) and noise. The system has L responses 
{ri(/)i- • 
which are present at ports {( r, 1),... ,(r, L)}. The response r.»(/)
at port (r, /) where I 6 {i, 2,.... L} may be any open circuit voltage or short circuit­
current (or, more generally, an arbitrary system variable) at any node or branch 
respectively in the underlying non-linear network of the system. Using this system 
formulation it is possible to determine the noise response, as well as the deterministic 
signal response (including de), at any place in the non-Un ear system. The equivalent 
noise free non-linear system may contain one- and multi-port non-linear elements 
and subsystems — e.g. non-linear capacitors, and current generators with a non­
linear dependence of two (or more) controlling variables. The primary objective of 
the present chapter is to determine expressions for the responses {ri( /)>. -., rr(/)} 
and their statistical properties, and to describe the information needed to deter­
mine the responses. The statistical properties include the determination of average 
noise power densities and average noise powers at the response ports as well as the 
cross-correlation (and autocorrelation) between Fourier series coefficients at arbi­
trary response ports.
The type of system in Figure 7.1 can not readily be analyzed since it contains 
internal noise and de sources. The internal sources, as well as the noise sources 
applied at the input ports, may be applied at separate external ports provided that 
the internal topology of the underlying non-linear network is not changed. This is 
shown in Figure 7.2 where the (unmodulated as well as modulated) noise sources 
riQ(f)} are applied at ports {(?i, 1),..(n, Q)}. These noise sources also 
describe the noise sources at the input ports. Thus the signals {.s; 
sa'(/)}
applied at ports {(s, 1),..., (s. R')} are purely deterministic signals which may also 
include de.
The overall system is described up to some maximum order A/. This order is 
the highest order considered, including the possibly non-linear transfer from funda­
mental (unmodulated) noise source to modulated noise source. For example, if the 
maximum order of a transfer from unmodulated to modulated noise source is A/ 
and the system itself is linear, then the order for the analysis must be M to yield 
correct results. In this example, of course, the Volterra transfer functions of orders 
greater than 1 for the linear system are zero. Only the Vol terra transfer functions 
for the modulated noise source of orders greater than 1 are non-zero. Suppose that

may be either a short circuit current or an open circuit voltage. The noise sources internally 
in the system may be either unmodulated (independent) or modulated (dependent). The 
system may also contain de sources.
the non-linear system in itself is described up to some maximum order and the 
maximum order of the transfer from unmodulated to modulated noise source is 
then the overall maximum order M must be chosen as M = inax{Ms, Mn} to yield 
correct results.
7.2.2 Representation of signals
Fourier series in Volterra series analysis are very attractive since brute force multi­
dimensional integration is replaced by addition of multiplicative terms which in a 
sense is made in one dimension. This makes a Fourier series representation of the 
signals computationally very efficient. Also the use of Fourier series has advantages 
of a simple representation of sinusoidal signals, and in the determination of average 
noise power densities at specified frequencies. Generally the noise and deterministic 
signals considered are extending over all time, -oo < t < oo, and have infinite 
energies. Thus for a real valued noisy signal Xj(t') where —oo < t. < oo it is given 
that- Linir-.oj 
This means that the noisy signal ^j(t) is not
absolutely integrable and thus it does not generally have a Fourier transform.
In [3] two standard types of suggestions are given for the frequency domain rep­
resentation of stationary (random) noise signals. The first suggestion is to represent 
Xj(t) in a time interval —r < t. < r and to assume = 0 for |/| > r. The

frequency domain representation in this case is the (integral) Fourier transform of 
given as Xj(f) = f^T exp[-j'27r/i] dt. The second suggestion is to assume 
that the noise signal a’j(t) is periodic with period 2r such that z7(f) - a’j(t+ 2ir) 
where i E 3 is an integer. From this, the frequency domain representation is given 
as a Fourier series. However, the assumption that z/j) is periodic has the un­
fortunate consequence that the autocorrelation function is also periodic such that 
(zjGi) = (^j(G) z*(i
2 + 2zt)) where i E Z is an integer. This also implies 
that the coefficients of the Fourier series are orthogonal — two Fourier series coeffi­
cients ^J:(pif) and Zj2(p2f) are said to be orthogonal if 
^y2(p2<)} = 0 for
all integers pi,p2 E Z except forpj = p2 where (•) denotes the ensemble average over 
noise processes with identical statistical properties. Since (zj(ti) z*(i
2)) is generally 
not periodic for the type of signals considered in the present work this suggestion is 
not useful. If the systems under consideration are linear (single response), which is 
the case for the work in [3], then it is not a problem that (zy(h) ^(h)} is periodic, 
because there is no need for any evaluation between Fourier series coefficients at 
different frequencies. However, since the systems considered in the present work 
are non-linear, periodicity of xj(t) can not be assumed since there may very well 
be a correlation between Fourier series coefficients at different frequencies. This is, 
for example, the case for modulated noise sources — even in the case where the 
fundamental noise source in itself (without modulation) generates white noise (it is 
very simple to show special cases which illustrate this statement). Since it is most 
useful to have some kind of a Fourier series representation in the present work, none 
of the suggestions made in [3] are useful.
One way to achieve the goal of a Fourier series representation without the prob­
lems of orthogonal Fourier series coefficients due to periodicity of the signals is 
described in the following. Assuming that the noise signal Xj(t) has finite energy in 
the finite time interval — r < t < r where r > 0 then f^r |xJ(t)|2 dt < oc. In this 
case Xj(t) can be represented as a Fourier series in the time interval -r < t < r as

(7.1)
where

In this case x^t) is generally non-zero for t > H as opposed to the first method 
in [3] where z;(t) — 0 for t > lr|. The time interval [—t;t] is referred to as the 
observation time interval. In Equation (7.1) the quantity Xj{p%) is a complex valued 
random variable in the random process describing the statistical properties of the

where T7 {•} denotes the (integral) Fourier transform, and <$(•) is the Dirac (^-function 
[4]. Note from Equation (7.6) that Xj(f) is a two-sided Fourier transform and thus 
xj(f) is represented at both positive and negative frequencies. It is very impor­
tant to maintain both positive and negative frequencies since the mixing of various 
frequency components is essential to the non-linear noise analysis, and is only cor­
rectly analyzed when both positive and negative frequencies are included. It is also 
seen from Equation (7.6) that the frequency resolution in the spectrum of Xj(f) is 
given by £. This frequency resolution can be made arbitrarily small by choosing r 
sufficiently large.
To prove that Equation (7.1) is fulfilled in the time interval — r < t < r it suffices 
to show that (|xj(t) — Z^-oo^/X) exp[J2ap^]l2) = 0. This relation may be 
proved using standard techniques based on the assumption that Xj(t') is real [51. 
It can also be shown that if the autocorrelation function (^(ij) ij(i2)) is periodic 
with period 2r then the coefficients of the Fourier series expansion are orthogonal. 
However, in general this property is not valid since the autocorrelation function 
(jryfti) xj(t2)) is generally not periodic.

The notation used in Equations (7.7)-(7.9) implies that sums of pure exponential

theoretical point of view since exponential inputs are frequently used iu Volterra 
series analysis.
7.3 Noise sources
In the analysis of non-linear noisy networks and systems it is sometimes necessary 
to take into account modulated (dependent) noise sources as well as unmodulated 

7.3. Noise sources
151
(independent or fundamental) noise sources. That is, the noise generated in a given 
device or network element may depend on some controlling quantity (or quantities) 
in the system. For example, shot noise in semiconductor devices is dependent on a 
deterministic signal applied to it (mainly de, but also the alternating signals may be 
of importance if they are not much smaller than the de signals) [6]. This is because 
the shot noise is usually proportional to an instantaneous current - this may be 
viewed as the de operating point is changing with time due to the excitation. If 
the deterministic signal is sufficiently large, this causes a modulation of the noise 
source which in turn leads to correlated noise sidebands — this is even the case if 
the fundamental noise source (the noise source which is being modulated) generates 
white noise.
7.3.1 Basic theory
Noise sources are generally included as in Figure 7.3 in which the possibly modulat­
ed (dependent) noise source nQ(/) is identical with the response from a non-linear 
noise free subsystem not containing de sources with inputs {«7,i(/)?, .., u7)/7(/)}. 
which are referred to as controlling variables applied at ports {(u7, 1),. . .,(?/,?, f7)}, 
and a fundamental (unmodulated, independent) noise source w?(/) where q E 
{1,2,.... Q}. The non-linear noise free multi-port system in Figure 7.3 must not con­
tain de sources. However, the controlling variables {u7.i(/),..., 
maY have
a de value, and also the fundamental noise source w7(i) where q t {1, 2,..., Q} may 
have a non-zero mean value. The controlling variable u7jI'7(/) where q G {1.2..... Q} 
and iq G {1,2,...,77} may be either an open circuit voltage or a short circuit 
current (or actually any system variable) at any node or branch respectively in 
the underlying network of the non-linear system. The non-linear system in Fig­
ure 7.3 is described by a multi-port frequency domain Volterra series [71 with inputs 
{u>7(/L 
and output nq(f) where q G {1,2,..., Q } as

and (Gg)m0,m1,...Tm/q(-) is the partly symmetrical multi-port frequency domain Volter­
ra transfer function relating the inputs {w,?(/); uqA(f),..., u^/A/)} to the output 
n?(/) of order m0 +

the order mo + mi + • • • + mj to be from 1 to M. Thus, M is the order of truncation 
of the multi-port Volterra series.
A partly symmetrical multi-port frequency domain Volterra transfer function is 
defined as follows. Let {”.<1,.... denote permutation Ik E {1.2,.... oj} 
of the o.J total number of permutations of the frequency variables ,..., 
where k E {1.2,..., A’}. Then, a multi-port frequency domain Volterra transfer

Volterra transfer function (5"7il(?)ai... Or-(T can be made partly symmetrical as

7. Noise in non-linear systems: Theory
All permutations 
are required to be different for all k E
{1,2,..., A'} to assure (partial) symmetry of (.F?|I(j)mi (.„i7nK(-).
Note that the assumption of partly symmetrical transfer functions is not a loss 
of generality, since the response n?(/) where q E {1,2,...,Q} in Equation (7-19) 
remains the same if a possibly unsynimetrical frequency domain Volterra transfer 
function is substituted with the corresponding partly symmetrical transfer function. 
Note also from Equation (7.19) that there may be several different (f?7)/n0,m1,...1m/ (•) 
multi-port frequency domain Volterra transfer functions of the same order mo + 
mi 4- • * ■ + Observe from Equation (7.19) that even if (G^Itho,^,...,™^ j where 
q E {1,2,..., Q} Is unsymmetrical then any variables 
where
k E {1, 2,..A’} may be permuted and one still obtains the same result for nq[f). 
The reason for using partly symmetrical Volterra transfer functions is that the 
amount of computations required to determine the response may be significantly 
reduced when the transfer functions are symmetrical compared to when the transfer 
functions are unsymmetrical.
Full symmetry of a multi-port Volterra transfer function can generally not be 
utilized. A fully symmetrical Volterra transfer function is defined by
( 
.....oa; ("1,1 ? • • • i —‘1, Ji ,............* ; — R .1» ■ • • i “R ,0 )
“ 
‘ I.............. : ^R',1 j ■ • ■ ,
(7.23)
where q E {1,2,...,Q}, and P/{-} denotes permutation number / E {1,2,..., (oj + 
••• + °/<)’j of the frequency variables. The full symmetry in Equation (7.23) is 
generally not fulfilled since the signals are applied at K possibly different input 
excitation ports. Thus, two signals from two different input ports may generally not 
be interchanged to give the same output response. Therefore, multi-port Volterra 
transfer functions are generally not fully symmetrical, and a fully symmetrical multi­
port Volterra transfer function can not be substituted for the possibly unsymmetrical 
transfer function in Equation (il9).
The contribution of order 0 for n„(f) in Equation (7.19), which is identical to 
the response when no signals (including de) are applied, is excluded in the systems 
in Figures 7.2 and 7.3. It is very important to emphasize that the de sources can not 
be removed as sources by introducing a zeroth order term in Equation (7.19). This

is because the zeroth order contribution, identical to l/7?)c,o,...,o( h in this case can 
not give information on the non-linear interference between de and other applied 
deterministic signals. Actually, (G\)o,o,...,o() is a- system contribution which is there 
but it can not interfere with other signals (it may be called a ’mathematical offset’). 
It lies in the modelling of non-linear devices that the zeroth order contribution is 
not of interest (it does not describe any physical behaviour of the circuit). Note 
that there may very well be interference between de and other deterministic signals 
and noise in the system in Figure 7.2. In much work on Volterra series analysis it 
is stated that the zeroth order contribution (G?)o,o... o() represents the internal de
sources in the system. However, this is generally not correct for the above reasons.
The upper limit for the order m0 4 mi F ■ ■ • + mig is the maximum order M. 
Actually, M —> co but for practical reasons M must be chosen to have some finite 
value. Of course, M must be chosen sufficiently large so as not to give incorrect 
results because of too low a maximum order. For a given M it is sometimes useful 
to determine limits for the amplitudes of the applied deterministic signals to ensure 
that the residual components to ng(f) in Equation (7.19) of orders higher than M 
are insignificant. This problem is also closely related to the functional modelling 
of the non-linear elements in the system. The model of a non-linear element is 
valid for the controlling variable in some finite interval. Therefore, it is a good 
idea to calculate the deterministic contributions at the controlling variables for the 
non-linear elements to assure that the elements are not too strongly/weakly excited.
The response for the modulated noise source n7(/) where q E {1,2,...,Q} is 
limited to exclude zeroth order noise contributions — actually, this is no limitation 
as in this case the modulated noise source n7(/) is just a controlled non-linearity, 
and this type of non-linear element (subsystem) is already included in the non-linear 
noise free system in Figure 7.2. Using the above assumptions and treating only low

q E {1,2,. or (ii) when M = 1 meaning that the system is linear. Similarly, 
if Iq = 0 then n?(/) = (Cg)i(/) wg(/) in which case ng(/) is an unmodulated noise 
source given as a linear filtering of the fundamental (unmodulated) noise source 
Wq(f) where q E {1,2,...,Q}. Using the formulation in Equation (7.24) it is pos­
sible to introduce very complicated modulating functions in a simple way. For 
example, the modulated noise source nq(f) where q E {1,2,...,Q} may depend 
on several deterministic signals in the non-linear network, and the non-linear net­
work in Figure 7.3. In Table 7.1 some examples of modulated noise sources and the 
corresponding modulating functions are shown.
7.3.2 Controlling variables
Since low level noise is assumed, which implies that the noise is a small per­
turbation of the deterministic signal regime, the controlling variables are deter­
mined as the contributions to {«7)i(/),..

If a set of frequencies {uq,.. .,cjq} is not incommensurate up to order o, it is com­
mensurate for orders higher than or equal to o. In the literature, e.g. [8.9,10,11], the 
commensurability concept does not depend on the order, which is not in accordance 
with the above definition. However, the traditional definition actually assumes that 
the order is infinite, which of course is not very relevant, since all practical uses of 
the Volterra series technique are of limited order (traditionally order 2 or 3). For a 
further discussion on this see [7, footnote 1]. From the definition it is seen that
1. If 0 E . .cjq} then the set {uq,.. .,cjq} is incommensurate up to order 
o=l and commensurate for order o E {2,3,..,, oo}.
2. Any set of frequencies {uq,... where uq 
uq is incommensurate
up to at least order o = 1,
The concept of commensurability is very important in the analysis and is frequently 
used in the following. The definition of commensurability does not depend on the 
number of input ports for the non-linear system but only on the overall frequencies 
applied. Intuitively, a set of frequencies {uq,... ,u.’q} is incommensurate up to order 
o if a frequency cjj E {uq, ... , cjq} can. not be given as an intermodulation product 
or harmonics of the other frequencies up to order o.

7 E {1,2, ...,Q} can be written as the Fourier series in Equation (7.9) with some

For the noise response It is not of interest directly to operate on the expression 
for n7(/) but rather on the Fourier series coefficient of c(0) in the expression for 
n7(/). This is because (i) the noise representation has a (practically — due to a 
very small continues frequency spectrum, and (ii) only low level noise is included 
in the analysis, in which case it is not necessary to consider contributions caused by 
non-linear mixing of noise with noise. In Equation (7.51) a part of the argument 
frequency to w7(-) is

7.3.4 Fundamental noise sources
A typical type of fundamental time domain noise source is a Gaussian white noise 
process with specified mean and standard deviation. Traditionally, Gaussian white 
noise sources are with mean values equal to zero, but in the present work the fun­
damental noise sources may have non-zero mean values. Due to this the noise is 
actually not “white” since not all frequencies have the same average power density. 
However, this type of noise will be referred to as white noise even though it has a 
non-zero mean. The fundamental time domain Gaussian white noise source with 
mean and standard deviation uq has a time domain cross-correlation given by
(wg(fi) w*(<
2)) 
= 
- G) + 
, 
<i,i2€[-r;r] 
(7.66)
for noise source q € {1,2,...,Q} where <$(•) is the Dirac delta-function. It can. 
be shown that the corresponding cross-correlation between two arbitrary frequency 
domain Fourier series coefficients evaluated in the time interval [-t; t] is given by
g., sin[ir(pi - p2)]
2r 7r(pi-p.2)
<r,7(2r)+p,2
. 0
2sin[7Tpr] sin[rrp'
TTPl 7rP2 
for Pi = p2 = 0 
for pi = ps 0 
otherwise 
(7.67)
(7.68)
where pi?p2 E 2. Note that there are only contributions to (ujq^P1) wq(£P2)} when 
pi = p2. When pi = p2 7^ 0 only the standard deviation is of importance, and when 
Pl = p2 = 0 both the standard deviation and the mean value are of importance.
In some cases it may be useful to make a comparative study by a discrete time 
domain simulation. In this case the description in time is discretized such that 
t € 
. ,t\} with ” b.-i = 2r/(2A + 1) for all z\ e {-A -J-
1, - A + 2,..., A}, and 
where AG {-A,..., -1,0,1,..., A}. Note from Equation (7.69) that t_\ = —t\. In 
this case it can be shown that the Fourier scries coefficient is given by
= 9aT7 T expf—>27rp 
(7.70)
wnere p t {~A,..., —1,0, 1,..., A}. Thus the one time domain stochastic variable 
is represented as 2A4-1 frequency domain stochastic variables. Assuming that wq(t)

and standard deviation ag it can be shown that

(7.78)
which is generally different from zero. Note that the modulated noise source 
?ig(t) is correlated at two different frequencies £p + ’P and £p even when, as in 
this case, the fundamental (unmodulated) noise source w7(t) is a zero mean 
white noise source.

7. Noise in non-linear systems: Theory
It is recalled that (rn)/1(fpi) r*j,(f
P2)) where , Z2 € {1,2,..., L] and pi,p2 6 Z is 
a two-sided Fourier series coefficient cross-correlation. Thus, if for example the 
average signal power is determined for the one-sided case with positive frequencies, 
i.e. 
E Aj-h then a factor 2 must be multiplied on the right-hand side of
Equation (7.108) if the time domain response signals are real.
7.4.4 Some special cases
Consider the following situations:
• 
If (i) all the noise sources {ni(/),..., riq(/)} are unmodulated, and (ii) the 
system is linear, then Equation (7,104) leads to
Q Q

of a linear network.

Noise in non-linear systems: 
Examples and Conclusion
This chapter contains three examples for the analysis of low-level noise in non-linear 
networks and systems. The first example illustrates the properties of a modulated 
noise source. The second and third examples illustrate the analysis of noise in two 
types of networks. The examples have been constructed to facilitate comparative 
numerical simulations of the networks. The numerical simulations turn out to agree 
very well with the predicted theoretical results.
Generally, the simulations are performed as follows. First a number of 2A + 1 
fundamental noise samples, which are in accordance with the specified statistical 
properties, are generated for each noise source by a pseudo random number gen­
erator. Then the modulated time domain noise samples are determined from the 
modulating function, the fundamental noise samples are processed by the network 
equation(s), and next these time domain samples are Fourier series transformed. 
The Fourier series coefficients for the frequency points of interest are saved. Then 
new noise samples are generated for the next iteration and so forth. Thus, the num­
ber of iterations is the same as the number of ensembles in the stochastic process 
for the noise. Denoting the number of iterations by T, the value for
where zi and z? are stochastic variables and E {—A,..-1,0,1...., A} is 
given by
(8-1) 
1 7=1
where -^(^J and ^^Ups) arc l?ourier series coefficients for the ensemble number 
(iteration number) 7 at frequencies and <fP2. Equation (8.1) can bp used to 
illustrate the convergence of the result as more and more iterations are processed. 
If the result of a simulation is to be given as a single number it is most convenient 
to take the average over a number of iterations. This can be done as

8.1 Example 1
Problem: First an example of a modulated noise source is considered. The non­
linear noisy system under consideration is shown in Figure 8.1. For this system the 
number of signal input ports A' = 1 and the number of controlling variables Q = 1 
(and the number of output ports is L — 1 though this is not of interest in this 
example, since only the noise source is investigated). The modulated noise source 
current depends on the controlling current uij. The objective of the example 
is to determine (ni(fpi) nJ(fP2)) where pi,p2 E 2 are integers, and to compare the 
theoretical results with numerical experiments. The maximum order is chosen to 
be M = 3.
Theory: The system in Figure 8.1 is excited by the deterministic signal Si(/) given 
by Equation (7.8) as

The cross-correlation )n^P2)} may be 0 even if |fpi - fP2| fulfils Equation 
(8.27) but then it depends on the conversion vector given by Equation (8.21). 
Note that (^i(fPl) nJ(^Pz)) may be different from 0 if pi p2. This is due to the 
modulation of the fundamental white noise source. When there are pi ± p2 which 
fulfils Equation (8.27) then (u)i(fPl) fbJ(f,J2)) is a non-zero matrix with non-zero 
off-diagonal elements, e.g. for il1(1 — 3 and 2 = 7 it can be shown that

The following numerical simulations have been performed to illustrate the properties 
of the modulated noise source:

8.1. Example 1
187
Simulation 1 The autocorrelation (|Hi(fP)|2)r with p — 17 is simulated versus the 
number of iterations F. The data and result of the simulation are shown in 
Figure 8.2. For this situation only the standard deviation and not the mean is 
of importance as predicted from the theoretical result in Equation (8-30). The 
simulated result (jHi(sirjPJSgoi = 1-5.48 agrees with the theoretical result 
(|Hi(fir)!2) = 15.42 with a deviation of 0.37 %.
Simulation 2 The autocorrelation (|Hi(fp)|2)p with p ~ 0 is simulated versus the 
number of iterations T. The data and result of the simulation are shown 
in Figure 8.3. For this situation both the standard deviation and the mean 
are of importance as predicted from the theoretical result in Equation (8.30). 
The simulated result (|Hi(f0)i2)-2990i - 23.74 agrees with the theoretical result 
(|Hi(<fo)j2) = 23.76 with a deviation of -0.09 %.
Simulation 3 The autocorrelation 
with p — 7 is simulated versus
the amplitudes pu = of the input sinusoidals. The data and result of the 
simulation are shown in Figure 8.4. All simulated values (|)lggoi agree 
with the theoretical result (|Hi(£t)|2) in Equation (8.30) with a deviation less 
than ±1.25 %. As seen from Figure 8.4 the noise level ('Hi(^7)|2) increases 
with the amplitudes pi.i — p1>2 of the deterministic excitation signals.
Simulation 4 The cross-correlation (Hi(fP1) nJ(<P2))r with pi = 4 and p2 = 6 for 
t — 1.0, $1,1 = 2.0 and $i? — 3.0 is simulated versus the number of iterations 
T (thus, fP1 = 
= $i,i and ^P2 — $3 = $1,2)- The data and results of the
simulations for Re[(ni(fpi) 
))r] and Im[(n1(^Pl) n7(fP2 ))r] are shown in
Figures 8.5 and 8.6. The theoretical result for this situation can be predicted 
from Equation (8.26) observing that

8.2 Example 2
Problem: As a simple example of the theory, consider the non-linear time invari­
ant noisy system in Figure 8.7. For this system the number of signal input ports 
is A = 1, the number of controlling variables is Q = 1, and the number of output 
ports is L — 1. The deterministic input signal is a single sinusoidal signal, and the 
single noise source is unmodulated. The objective of the example is to determine 
the cross-correlation (rn,i(fP1) )) where pi,p2 G £ are integers.

by use of Equations (7.10-5) and (7.106). It can be shown that the autocorrelation 
(|En(i(s>)i2) is given by

(8.83)

Note that the output autocorrelation Cixiffp)!2) has the same frequency domain 
shape as the autocorrelation for the fundamental noise source (’Wi(sp)|2)- The only 
difference is the multiplication factor C2 ||-riil(£p)||2 which depends on the amplitude 
of the input sinusoidal signal, and on the linear and non-linear network parameters.
Numerical Experiment: To investigate the correctness of the theoretical results 
presented in this example, numerical simulations are performed in accordance with 
Section 7.3. To obtain the desired correlation properties for the fundamental noise 
source Wi(t) as given by Equation (8.39), uq(Z) is given by a linear filtering of a 
noise signal c'i(C which is a zero mean white Gaussian noise process with standard 
deviation . Choosing the frequency domain transfer function of the linear filter 
as
= —vZk.(2A + 1) —=2i-■- 
(8.84)
gives the desired correlation properties for Wi(fp)- Thus the fundamental noise 
source is given by
iul(Cpi) = Hiin( fpt) cl(£pi) 
(S.d-5)
which leads to the derived correlation properties for wi(f?) as given by Equation 
(8.39). It is necessary to determine fundamental noise samples mi(t_A),..., wi(<a) 
from the noise samples £i(La),...,^a) taking into account the linear filtering. 
One way to do this is first to generate cT(Z_a), •. • . £i(t\) as a zero mean white 
Gaussian noise process with standard deviation tri, then determine all the Fouri­
er senes coefficients €i(£-a), • • -;^I’sAh then multiply Hun{£-a T ■ • ■ ?

In this case Wi(fPl) = Sj(fP1) for all pi E {-A,..., -1,0,1,..., A} which means

retical results (|wi(£p)|2) with deviations less than ±1.3 %. To avoid mak­
ing assumptions on the simulation it is only possible to make direct noise 
comparisons for |p| G {1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15} since the simulated results for 
|p| G {0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14,16} contain both a noise contribution and a de­
terministic distribution which can not be separated without making some as­
sumptions.
Simulation 2 The autocorrelation for the output response \|(sp)P)3990? with 
p - 5 is simulated versus the amplitude pij of the input sinusoidal for various 
maximum orders M G {2,4,6, 8}. The data and results of the simulation are 
shown in Figure 8.9. As seen from Figure 8.9 the noise level increases with 
amplitude pj.4. Quite as expected from the theory, the agreement between the­
ory and experiments improves when the maumuni order M for the theoretical 
prediction increases. When M = 8 the experimental results (|Fi(£n)|2)399o? 
and the theoretical results (|r1(f11)|2) agree with deviations less than ±0.7 %

and results of the simulation are shown in Figure 8.10. All simulated val­
ues (Pi(?p)|2?399oi where |p| G {1,3,5,7,9,11,13,15} agree with the theo­
retical results (|rn,i(fP)|2) with deviations less than ±1.6 %. To avoid mak­
ing assumptions on the simulation it is only possible to make direct noise 
comparisons for |p| G {1.3,5,7,9,11,13,15} since the simulated result for 
|p| G {0,2,4,6,8,10,12,14} contains both a noise contribution and a deter­
ministic contribution which can not be separated without making some as­
sumptions.

given by Equation (7.8) as

where ^1,1 — ^1,1 > 0 and V>i,2 = and

and thus Ji = 2. The time domain noise signal ni(t) is given by
m(T) = Ci wi(t) 
(8.98)
where wi(t) is a white noise source. Thus the noise source ni(i) is unmodulated.

All Volterra transfer functions relating Si(/)} ?ii(/) and to the response r1(/) 
of orders higher than 3 are zero, even though, due to the modulation of noise source

Simulation 1 The autocorrelation (|rn(1(fp)|2)r with p = 3 is simulated versus the 
number of iterations T. The data and result of the simulation are shown in 
Figure 8.12. This simulation is for a linear system, i.e. a2 = 03 = 0, but where 
noise source 2 is being modulated by the applied deterministic signal. The 
simulated result (|rn,i(&)|2)399o? = 1-7523 X 10-15 agrees with the theoretical 
result (|Fn)i(f3)|2) = 1.7596 X 1O~10 with a deviation of -0.42 %.

ues (|^n,i(f3)|2)399oi agree w^h ^e theoretical result (|rnti(f3)|2) in Equation 
(8.144) with a deviation less than ±0.39 %. As seen from Figure <8.12 the noise 
level 
increases with the amplitudes pij = cqt2 of the deterministic
excitation signals. For very small plfl only noise source 1 is of importance 
since it, as opposed to noise source 2, is independent of a modulating signal.

in Equation (8.144) with deviations less than ±0.14 %. The simulation for 
rji — (t2 ~ 10 deviates from the theoretical result by 6.0 %. This rather 
large deviation is due to the fact that the mixing of noise with noise for in­
creasing standard deviations is not considered in the theoretical prediction but 
is included in the numerical simulation.

S. Noise in non-linear systems: Examples and Conclusion
8.4 Conclusion
A method has been presented to analyze noise in nou-autonomous non-linear multi­
port networks and systems where low level noise can be assumed. This means that 
the systems must be small signal linear which is true for many types of systems.
The system description and mathematical representation of noise have been dis­
cussed. The non-linear noisy system under consideration must be transferred to an 
equivalent non-linear noise free system with external deterministic and noise gen­
erators (sources). This is required to apply the Volterra series technique. The de­
terministic and noise signals are represented mathematically as Fourier series which 
are computationally very efficient when Volterra series are used. The mathematical 
representation of noise sources has been treated in detail. A noise source is given 
as the response from a non-linear noise free multi-port system with a fundamen­
tal (unmodulated) noise source and possibly modulating signals as inputs. In this 
way it is possible to represent unmodulated as well as modulated (dependent) noise 
sources. The cross-correlation between Fourier series coefficients of any two (possi­
bly) modulated noise source signals can be described by a cross-correlation matrix 
for the two fundamental noise sources at various frequencies, and vectors which 
describe the transfers from fundamental noise sources to modulated noise sources. 
This way to describe (possibly) modulated noise sources is very flexible, and it is 
easy to describe even very complicated multi-signal modulations.
Expressions for the noise and deterministic signal response at arbitrary response 
ports have been determined. The cross-correlation between two Fourier series coef­
ficients at arbitrary response ports has been determined from noise cross-correlation 
matrices for the fundamental noise sources, and vectors describing the transfer from 
fundamental to modulated noise sources and from modulated noise sources to the 
noise responses at the response ports. Also, it has been shown how these rather 
complicated transfers must be specified for the Volterra series technique.
Expressions have been derived for various average noise powers and noise powrer 
densities. The quantities are usually of high interest in the analysis of noise. The 
average noise powers and noise power densities have been determined from noise 
cross-correlation matrices for the fundamental noise sources, and from the non­
linear transfer of the fundamental noise sources to the given response port.
Three examples have been shown to illustrate the use of the presented method. 
One example shows the representation and the properties of a, type of modulated 
noise source. Two examples show how to determine noise cross-correlations at a 
response port for two type of circuits. All examples have been chosen to make 
it possible to find an alternative (analytical) solution to the given examples. The 
results for the presented method and from the alternative (analytical) solutions are 
in agreement, which indicates the correctness of the presented method. Generally it 
is not possible to find alternative analytical solutions, and all three examples have 
been carefully chosen to make comparisons possible.

Multi-port Volterra transfer functions
This final chapter deals with the determination of frequency domain Volterra trans­
fer functions of non-linear multi-port networks containing non-linear multi-port el­
ements (subsystems). A pure frequency domain method is derived which allows 
commensurate as wed as incommensurate frequencies. The method is based on an 
extension of the probing method to allow multi-port networks and commensurate 
frequencies. A computer implementation of the method in an algebraic program­
ming language is made which allows determination of Volterra transfer functions in 
algebraic form up to eighth order on a low end workstation. Examples are present­
ed and the results are compared with existing literature in the special cases where 
comparison is possible.
9.1 Introduction
In this chapter a method and algorithm are developed to determine multi-port 
Volterra transfer functions of non-linear multi-port networks which may contain non­
linear multi-port elements (subsystems) — that is, non-linear elements (subsystems) 
which are controlled by arbitrary variables. The purpose of this is twofold: (i) 
multi-port Volterra transfer functions are a fundamental requirement for the low- 
and high-level noise analysis, and (ii) it has been pointed out in the literature that 
the use of Volterra series is limited to one-port non-linear elements which precludes, 
for example, the analysis of MESFET transistors which ought to contain (at least) 
two-dimensional non-linear elements [1,2]. The work of the present chapter is also 
of importance in the analysis of the convergence properties of Vol terr a series since 
relatively high order (> 4) Vol terra transfer functions may be determined. In the 
literature, much material is available on the one-port Volterra series representation, 
but little on the general multi-port Vol terr a series representation.
Previously, Bussgang, Ehrman and Graham [3], Maas [4,5] and Chua and Ng

.9. Multi-port Volterra transfer functions
[6] have investigated the determination of one-port Volterra transfer functions 
using the method of non-linear currents by a combination of time and frequency 
domain analysis. These analysis methods have been limited to one-port networks 
containing one-port non-linear elements and generators controlled by one variable. 
The method derived in the present work is based on an extension of the probing 
method to allow arbitrary (also commensurate) frequencies.1 A recursively based 
algorithm for the determination of Volterra transfer functions of non-linear multi­
port networks is derived. A computer implementation of the method in a symbolic 
programming language is presented. This makes it possible to determine algebraic 
expressions of the multi-port Volterra transfer functions. Finally, three examples 
are considered.
Tn Chua and Ng [7] a set of frequencies {Qi,. .. , is called incommensurate (and a fre- 
ouencv base'*, if there does not exist a set of rational numbers in, , r_. > <not ail zero) such that 
T'. 
+ ■ ■ • + rm-9m — fl. This is indeed a sufficient but actually not a necessarv condition for the
conventional probing method to be valid. It can be shown that a sufficient and necessary condition 
for the conventional probing method to be valid is that there does not exist a set of integer numbers 
, . . . , t/—. where </’ + 1,..., 4- 1 € <2o+ (not all zero) such that 71 Qi + • • • + 
— 0. For
example, the Chua and Ng condition says that the probing method can not be used lor the set

the sufficient and necessary condition, the probing method can be used for the set of frequencies

The chapter is organized as follows. Section 9.2 gives some preliminaries re­
garding multi-port Volterra series where the symmetry properties of the transfer 
functions are analyzed, and a modification of the probing method to allow com­
mensurate frequencies is presented. In section 9.3 the theoretical formulation for 
the determination of multi-port Volterra transfer functions is presented. Section 9.4 
discusses the implementation of the method in a symbolic programming language 
on a digital computer. Section 9.5 presents some types of time domain multi-port 
Volterra kernels and the corresponding frequency domain transfer functions. In sec­
tion 9.6 three examples are presented to illustrate the method. Finally, section 9.7 
presents some concluding remarks.
9.2 Preliminaries
The frequency domain response v(f) at a frequency f from a non-linear multi-port 
Volterra system (a system which can be described by a convergent Volterra series) 
with K input ports and input signals {s1(/)...., s/<(/)} is given by

In Equation (9.1) the quantity ....,mK(') a (possibly) uusymmetrical multi­
port frequency domain Volterra transfer function of order |’m|| and £(-) is the Dirac 
ti-function [8]. In Equation (9.1) the zeroth order contribution corresponding to 
||m|| = 0 has been excluded due to the factor £1>oo(||7n||). This contribution, which 
is usually not of interest, is identical to the response v(f) when no input signals are 
applied (the contribution may be called a mathematical offset). As pointed out in 
the previous section, this is no restriction in the noise analysis since the internal 
sources in the non-linear systems are applied at external ports.
9.2.1 Symmetry properties
For one-port Volterra systems ( K ~ 1) it is usually assumed, without loss of general­
ity, that the one-port Volterra transfer function 7Ynil (/i.i, -.., fi.mf) is -symmetrical. 
If the transfer function is not symmetrical it can be replaced by times the sum 
of all permutations of the unsymmetrical transfer function. In this way a symmet­
rical one-port transfer function can be obtained. This transfer function can directly 
be substituted with the given (and possibly uusymmetrical) transfer function in 
Equation (9.1).
For multi-port Volterra systems this approach for obtaining a symmetrical multi­
port Volterra transfer function is not directly possible. As seen from Equation 
(9.1) the response v(/) remains the same for any arbitrary permutation of the 
transfer function >mK(fi>\^ •• ■» /w.........; J’ka ? - - - > fx,^ ) respect to 

218
9. Multi-port Volterra transfer functions
variables from the same set {f^i,..., fktTnk } where k G {1, 2,..., K}. This means, 
for example, that two signals may general];/ be interchanged to yield the same 
response v(/) unless they enter the system through two different input ports. Thus 
a partly symmetrical Volterra transfer function, indicated by Sym{'H?nir.>tZn (•)}, 
can be obtained as
where Pk,ik {A.i, - • •, fk,mk] indicates permutation number l^ t {1,2,..., m J} of 
{A,i, • - •, fk,mk} for k E {1,2,..A'}. All permutations 
Pk,mki{-}
required to be different for all k 6 {1,2, ...,71} to assure (partial) symmetry of
The symmetrical transfer function 
can directly be substi­
tuted for the corresponding (possibly) unsymmetrical transfer function ^...^A•) 
in Equation (9.1).
It should be noted that the (possibly) unsymmetrical Volterra transfer function 
^m1„,.,..,TnA'(') is not unique in the sense that there may be several distinct trans­
fer functions which give the same response v(/) in Equation (9.1) for the same 
input. However, the (partly) symmetrical multi-port Voltcrra transfer function 
7fmi,....mA-(') is unique since
Hmi A(/l.1, • • •j/ljnp......... j fh,l i • « • ? fK ,m)
= 
{fl Ji ■ j /l,mi .......... ! 
J , • • ■ j/a\tia}) (9-6) 
for all permutations Pk,ik{fk,i , - • •, fk,mk} where k E {1,2,. .., A'}, and 
A G {1,2,..., mJ}. The use of partly symmetrical multi-port Volterra transfer 
functions, and not (possibly) unsymmetrical Volterra transfer functions, implies 
that the amount of computations needed to determine the response to sinu­
soidal or complex exponential inputs may be substantially reduced by exploiting the 
symmetry properties to avoid recalculating contributions which .are pist permxita- 
tions of variables from the same set.
9.2.2 Determination of transfer functions
The time domain signal applied at input port k E {1,2,.. .. K} is given by a sum 
of I*  complex exponentials:

k E {1,2,..., K} and I E {1,2,..., mjJ.
Note that Ik = mt for all k E {1,2,..., A'} is used in the derivation of Equation 
(9.10). If Ik < mk for one or more k E {1,2,.... A'} then at least one frequency 
in {^’jtj, ■ •appears twice in the argument to 7fmil...,7nR(-)- In this case 
Equation (9.10) does not follow since frequencies in the set {V’jt.i, ■ • ., ^k.m.k} for 
the symmetrical 
are not different. This is necessary to obtain a gen­
erally correct 
independent of the argument frequencies. If A >
for k E {1,2,..., A'} then Equation (9.10) can be derived. However, if Ik > mk 
for k E {1,2,..., A'} then the determination of v(/) in Equation (9.9) requires 
more calculations than are actually necessary. Thus, choosing Ik = for al- 
I k E {1,2,..., A’} is the proper choice for the analysis which leads to Equation 
(9.10).
The conventional probing method to determine one-port Volterra transfer func­
tions uses only a sum of <5-functions and no phases in the probing signal [3,6]. This 
situation is a special case of Equation (9.8) when (pk,ik = 0 for all k E {1,2,..., A'} 
and ik E {1,2,..., and precludes the situation of commensurate frequencies as 
noted by Chua and Ng [6].
9.3 Theory
In Figure 9.1 the overall non-linear network under consideration is shown. The 
non-linear network is separated into a purely linear network and Q purely non­
linear subsystems.2 Non-linear subsystem number q E {1,2,...,Q} is controlled 
by a number of P(q) variables. There are R controlling variables for the overall 
non-linear network represented by {^i(/),..Thus PM 6 {1,2, ...,A} 
for all q E {1,2, 
There are Q controlled variables, identical to the num­
ber of non-linear subsystems, for the overall non-linear network represented by 
{yi(/), • •, yo(/)}- Thus there are not necessarily equally many controlling as con­
trolled variables. For example, one controlling variable may control several con­
trolled variables, and one controlled variable may be controlled by several control-

ling variables. At the signal input ports independent voltage or current generators 
{'Si (/).. .. 
are applied. The complementary currents or voltages of the (volt­
age or current respectively) signal generators {^(J),.. -, «?A'(/)} are not of interest 
in this analysis. At the designated output port the response u(/) is either the ooen 
circuited voltage or the short circuited current. Thus the complementary current or 
voltage of the (voltage or current respectively) response u(/) is zero.
Figure 9.1: Non-linear network separated into a purely linear network and purely non­
linear subsystems.
Each non-linear subsystem in the overall non-linear network is described by the 
general non-linear multi-port type shown in Figure 9.2. The variables 
where j,,r 6 {1.2, ....11} for q 6 {1,2, ...,Q} and r 6 
{1,2,.. .,P(q)} are the controlling voltage or current variables and yq(J) is the cor­
responding controlled voltage or current output variable for non-linear subsystem 
q € {1.2,...,Q}. The subscripts for the controlling variables are collected in the 
vectors {j15.-. Jq} where j,. = [jqd...., j..hp(g}]T 6 £'?7)xl for q C {1,2..
Each controlling input port is either short or open circuited and hence the port volt 
age or current respectively is zero. The complementary current or voltage of the con­
trolled (voltageor current respectively) output variable yq(f) where 7 C {1,2,..., Q] 
is not of interest in the analysis. The general type of non-linear multi-port subsys­
tem shown in Figure 9.2 can be used for one-port non-linear elements as well as 
multi-port non-linear subsystems. One-port non-linear elements are represented

from Figure 9.2 by appropriate use of feedback between the output and the input 
port.

trolling signal input ports, 
■ • •, 
are the controlling variables where
r € {1,2,.. /?}, r € {1,2...., P(?)} and q E {1,2,..., Q}. At the output port,
is the controlled output variable for non-linear subsystem q £ {1,2,..., Q}. P(q) is the 
number of controlling variables for non-linear subsystem q C {1,2,..., Q]. This multi­
port non-linear subsystem can also be used to represent non-linear one-port elements, e.g. 
non-linear resistors and capacitors, by appropriate feedback between the output and input 
ports.
The problem to be solved in the following is to determine the multi-port frequen­
cy domain Volterra transfer function relating the input signals {si(/),..., 
to the output response v(f).
9.3.1 Relations for the linear system
By appropriate arrangement of the network variables and using the above properties 
for the non-linear subsystems, the linear system can, after some considerations, be 
described by the matrix equation

As seen from Equations (9.16)—(9.19) the sizes of the system matrices and vectors 
depend on the number of controlling variables, the number of controlled variables 
and the number of signal input ports. Thus the sizes of A(/); B(J), a(/) and b(f) 
do not depend on the number of linear elements in the overall network. However, it is 
obvious that the linear system matrices and vectors get more complicated the more 
linear elements there are in the network. That is, the number of multiplications and 
additions required to determine A(/), B(f), a(f) and b(/) increases with the num­
ber of linear network elements. The system matrices and vectors of the linear net­
work A(/), B(J), a(f) and b(/) may be determined using standard techniques [9]. 
However, when the system vectors and matrices are determined, 
?/q(/)}
should be interpreted as the port voltages or currents and not as generators since 
{9‘(/):•••? i'Qt/)} are dependent variables — the variables {.sjsk(/)} can 
still be viewed as generators since these are independent variables.
9.3.2 Non-linear response
An expression for the non-linear response i?(/) is determined with the signals at 
the K signal input ports as given by Equation (9.8) and Ik = for all k C 
{1/2,..A}. Thus the output response v(/) is given by

to be determined (with the substitutions mentioned earlier in this section), and 
in Equation (9.36) the response v(/) is given by network specific vectors and the 
non-linear controlling variables.

.....o(^,f) = ^2 M^’u) (Zr)l(tfe,/) +

The multi-port Volterra transfer functions of second and higher order (||m|| £

determined.

The controlling variables can be determined by using the fact that the coefficient of

solution vector in Equation (9.53), xi(ii\.j), can be determined provided the matrix

can be perturbed by some linear elements to obtain a unique and non-singrdar

only 
that is used. This matrix may be determined by setting s(f) =
[0,0,...,0]T € {0}Axl and then using y(f) as excitation signals instead of x(f). 
This technique is used in Example 2 in Section 9.6. If Q R then A(/) is non­
quadratic and then the inverse does not exist. This problem can be solved by 
introducing fictitious controlling or controlled variables as follows:
• 
If Q < R then introduce R — Q fictitious controlled sources which depend on 
one or more of the controlling variables Zi(/),.. ., z/?(/).
• 
If Q > R then introduce Q - R fictitious controlling variables which control 
one or more of the controlled variables t/i(/),.. .j1/q(/)«

Equation (9.70) has used the fact that the multi-port frequency domain Vol terr a 
transfer function (GQ)ni,...,nF((j)(-) is partly symmetrical for all q G {1.2, 
The condition in Equation (9.71) is used to avoid contributions which are simply 
permutations of {qrl,... ,qr7lr} where r € {1, 2....,P(g)}. As seen from Equations 
(9.68) and (9.70) there must, be summation over many g-variables. From Equation 
(9.70) it is seen that there are ||m!| X |}nj| q-variables. According to the properties, 
only ||mij of these q-variables are different from 0 (those q-variables that are not 0 
are 1). Thus it would be more convenient to use a pointer Wkj to indicate which 
^-variable in the set {71,1,w,.... qi,ni,k,l..........., ?P(7),1,^< • • ,, 7P(,,),np(,,.A-.i} is equal
to 1. In this case only ||mil w-pointers are needed instead of [|mli x |!n|l q- variables.
Now the requirements given for the q-variables in Equation (9.70) — and in turn 
in properties 9.2, 9.1, 9.3 and 9.4 — must be transferred to the w-pointers. As seen 
from the properties

9.3.6 Algorithm
To determine the non-linear multi-port frequency domain Volterra transfer function 
//mi... the following algorithm can be used.
1. Specify the number of controlling variables for all Q non-linear subsystems, 
{?(!),..., P(Q)}. Specify 
for all q G {1,2,...,<3}
where jq contains all subscript numbers for the relevant controlling variables 
®(/) = [a?ixFor example, if jg = [l,2,4]r for non-linear 
subsystem q € {1,2,.. . ,Q} then the corresponding controlling variables are 
{x^f),x2(f\x4(f)}.
2. Determine expressions for the system matrices and vectors of the linear system: 
B(f), a(f) and 6(/).
3. Specify the multi-port frequency domain Volterra transfer function 
tor all the non-linear subsystems q G {1,2,..., Q}.
4. Determine the controlling vector ®i|ml|(II^ID- This is done by a recursive 
method where higher order variables are determined from lower order variables 
as follows:
» Determine xi(^,0 for all k G {1,2,..., A"} and / 6 {1, 2,..., m.t} using 
Equation (9.53).
• Determine i2(V’Te) for e where ||e|| = 2 using Equations (9.68) and

Computer implementation
This section briefly discusses the computer implementation of the theory in Section 
9.3 to determine non-linear multi-port frequency domain Volterra transfer functions. 
The implementation is made in the MAPLE V Release 3 symbolic programming 
language which, for example, makes it possible to determine algebraic expressions 
for the multi-port Volterra transfer functions. The source code for the program is 
included in appendix E.
9.4.1 Some introductory considerations
It can be derived from the method described in section 9.3 that the number of 
contributions of £r0(^re) for a given o= j|e|| E {1,2,..., |lm||} is given by
11 ml I 
To(lim||) = 
(9.80)
o'. (||m|| - o)!
Thus the total number of evaluations required to determine ®i|7ni|(||'0ll) is given by
Ilmf!
HIM) = E ^(IHI)
0=1
= - 1
(9.81)
(9.82)
In Table 9.1. 7^(||m||) and 7'(||m||) are listed for some values of o and ||m||. When 
the multi-port frequency domain Volterra transfer function of a given order ||m|| is 
to be determined, all lower order Volterra transfer functions at any permutation of 
{mi,.... mx'} are determined at a very low computational cost. This is because all 
the required controlling x vectors have already been calculated. Thus ,□<<(•) 
where Oi 4------ r or- E {1,2,..., ||m|| — 1} is easily determined using Equation (9.38)
if oi + • ■ * + o% = 1 and Equation (9.41) if Oi + • • • + o/c £ {2,3,..., oo}.
It can also be shown that the number of ... with different frequency
arguments that must be determined to evaluate the response u(/) is given by
1
.......ZrA 
= TT ---- - Ik{ Tk + 1) • • • (fk + mk - 1) 
(9.83) 
' ,, mkl ' 
’
In Table 9.2 examples are given of the number of different transfer functions (‘differ­
ent’ in the sense that the frequency arguments are different) that must bo determined 
versus the number of input ports and applied (incommensurate) frequencies.
When K > 1 there have to be determined several Lfmii.„trnR(-) transfer functions 
of the same order ||m||. The number of ,...,mA'(’) of order ||m|| that must be 
determined for given K is shown in Table 9.3.

Table 9.1: Number of controlling vectors which must be determined, 71?(l|m||), for a given 
order ||m|| versus the orders of the individual controlling variables o. If the frequencies 
form a frequency base then the number of controlling variables listed is the same as the 
number of different frequencies at which the controlling variables must be determined. The 
rows indicate that a parallel computer could be efficient in computing the Volterra transfer 
functions as the calculation of different contributions of the same order o can run in parallel.
9.4.2 Precalculated tables
To make the program run relatively fast, tables are precalculated to determine valid 
n, o and w vectors from Equation (9.78) where

pointer to give the location of each which controlling x-variable involved in the
Table 9.2: #7f0 is the number of different rnR.() where mi + - - + 
— o that
must be evaluated at different frequencies to determine r(/) when the symmetry properties

Also tables are precalculated for the locations of the 2^m^ — 1 evaluations re­
quired to determine ®||7n||(ll'0ll) 35 5een from Equation (9.82). To illustrate why 
this type of table is necessary consider the following example.

9.4. Computer implementation
241
For a given order, o, compare a:o(Qi) and J3O(Q2) where fij Q2- As has been 
described previously, the oth order contribution is calculated from contributions of 
order 1,2,.. .,o — 1. Thus the frequencies at which x must be known for lower order 
contributions to determine zJfL) are not the same as those used to determine 
®0(Q2). Thus it is necessary to know where to find the lower order contributions 
dependent on the given frequency (actually a pointer to the given frequency).
During calculation reference from the former table to the latter is made.
9.4.3 Program
The program named volfun consists of three table-generating procedures, an initial­
ization procedure which defines arrays and reads tables into memory and a proce­
dure to calculate the multi-port frequency domain Volterra transfer function. Once 
the tables are calculated only the latter two are used. The current version of the 
program volfun allows determination of up to tenth order transfer functions and 
non-linear subsystems with up to two input ports.
The program can be used in three different modes:
• ‘algf’ - A full algebraic evaluation where the multi-port frequency domain 
Volterra transfer function is given by a single expression as a function of the 
elements in the linear network and Volterra transfer functions of the non-linear 
subsystems in the overall network. This is usually used for visual inspection 
of relatively low order Volterra transfer functions.
• ‘algr’ - A recursive algebraic evaluation where a given oth order contribution 
is given by lower order contributions of the controlling ie-vectors. The result 
from this mode can be directly translated into FORTRAN 77 code using an 
internal Maple V procedure. This mode is used for relatively high orders and 
where a high speed FORTRAN 77 version is to be determined.
• ‘num’ - A numerical evaluation of the Volterra transfer function. As this 
version does not use hardware floating-point arithmetic this mode is usually 
used for numerical evaluation of relatively low order Volterra transfer func­
tions. For higher order numerical evaluation the ‘algr mode is used to produce 
FORTRAN 77 code
The user must specify: (i) the number A*  of signal input ports, (ii) the number 
Q of controlled variables, (iii) the number R of controlling variables, (iv) index 
lists for all q E {1,2, ....Q} to specify which variables control each of the non­
linear subsystems, (v) procedures to calculate 
B(f), a(f) and b(f), (vi)
procedures to calculate the multi-port frequency domain Volterra transfer functions 
(Gf9)nit...,np(<j}(-) for all q G {1,2....,Q} of the non-linear subsystems, and (vii) 
mode of operation which may be either of the types ‘algf’. ‘algr’ or ‘num’.

9.6 Examples
The theory presented in the previous sections will be used to derive the non-linear 
Volterra transfer functions in four examples. Maple V source code for a program 
to determine algebraic expressions for transfer functions and for the example are 
included i appendix E.
9.6.1 Example 1
Here the non-linear Volterra transfer function between input and response vo 
in Figure 9.3(a) will be determined. The time domain relation for the non-linear 
conductance is given by

(9.96)
The modified non-linear system is shown in Figure 9.3(b) where the linear and non­
linear parts of the overall network have been separated. Using the algorithm in 
section 9.3 the relation for the linear system is given by
3/1(7) 
= 
^1,1(7) *i(7)  + 51.1(7)-31(7)
(9.97)
where ri(/) is the controlling voltage across and yi(f) is the controlled current 
through the non-linear conductance. Thus it can be shown from Figure 9.3(b) that

These results for the transfer functions are the same as those obtained by Bussgansj, 
Ehrman and Graham [3] using the traditional probing method.4
4lt should be noted that there are two errors in [3] regarding this example. In Equation (3.19) 
the factor — t should be and in Equation (3,20) the factor — | should be +|.
A somewhat similar example to the one in Figure 9.3 has been given by Maas 
[10, pp. 179-186] which includes a Type 5 non-linearity given in section 9.5. Using 
the method in this chapter, results are obtained which are in agreement with Maas.

non-linear elements where the time domain relations are given as

capacitor and transcond uc t ance as two separate one-port non-linear ge ne r ators an d 
not by one two-port generator as in this work. Using one two-port non-linear element 
instead of two one-port non-linear elements, the number of non-linear elements in

Conclusion
A method has been presented to determine the frequency domain Volterra t ransfer 
functions of non-linear multi-port networks containing non-linear multi-port sub­
systems. The method is based on a generalization of the probing method to allow 
arbitrary frequencies. The Volterra transfer functions are described as functions of 
network specific vectors of the linear part of the overall network and as functions of 
variables which control the nnn-llnear multi-port subsystems. A method has been 
derived to determine these controlling variables in recursive form.
The method has been implemented in a symbolic programming language ( Maple 
V Release 3 k which makes it possible to determine, algebraic expressions for the 
Vol terra transfer functions. This implementation can directly translate the resulting 
Volterra transfer functions in recursive algebraic form into FORTRAN 77 code.
Four examples have been presented. The results obtained are in agree merit with 
existing literature in the cases where comparison has been possible.

A
Mathematical concepts
This appendix discusses the mathematical representation of noise. First there is a 
short introduction to stochastic processes which is the basis for the mathematical 
treatment of noise. Next the representation of noise in the frequency domain using 
a Fourier series expansion is discussed in detail. Finally, there is an investigation of 
signal energies and powers of random variables.
A.l Stochastic processes
Noise in electrical networks and systems can be considered as random fluctuations 
in time of, for example, voltage, current or charge. Statistical methods are used to 
describe the influence of such random noise signals in a qualitative way. These are. 
for example, to analyze the mean value (which is usually assumed identical to zero), 
variance, autocorrelation and spectral density of the noise signals.
Using stochastic processes an ensemble of realizations {i A(/o), jAU0), .... A('i0)} 
with similar statistical properties are observed at the same instant of time The 
ensemble average of the random noise variable A(/Q) is given as
1
(A( to)) = Inn — 2_2 nA( to) 
A —*oo  ; V 
= A,o P(Af„AA,
where (■ • •) denotes the ensemble average over realizations with similar statistical 
properties, and P(Atf)) is the probability density function for the random, variable 
A(hj). Another important quantity is the autocorrelation function defined as

2) 
(A.4)
A-- 20 1' '----
where P(Atl,Af2) is the joint probability density function for the random variables 
A(tj) and A(Z2)-
Sometimes, the time average of a random noise signal is used which is a somewhat 
different concept from the ensemble average. The time average of the noise signal 
nA(t) of a given realization n E {1,2,..Ar} in the ensemble is defined as
zlA(Z) = lim / aA(t)dZ 
(A.6)
where the bar denotes the time average. An auto-correlation function is defined as
„A(t)„A(i + e) = 
nA(«)„A(/ + r') dl 
(A.7)
As the random noise fluctuations are usually observed versus time, it may seem 
closest to the physical reality to use time averages instead of ensemble averages. 
However, ensemble averages arc very useful from a theoretical point of view. This is 
because the (joint) probability density functions for the random variables in many 
cases can be deduced from theoretical considerations. Thereby it is possible to 
evaluate the statistical properties of the random variables without the need for time 
averaging. Another important factor is that the ensemble average usually equals 
the time average with regard to electrical networks. In case (A(Zo)) — nA(t) the 
noise process is called ergodic, which means that the ensemble average is equal to 
the time average for any realization n E {1,2,.... A’}.
The fact that a set of random variables are un correlated or independent is often 
used in the analysis of noise. A set of variables {Aift), AAt),..., A.w(Z)} are said to 
be uncorrelated if
(Ai(Z) A2(t)---AM(t)) = (A-i(t)) (A2(0) ••■(Aw(Z)) 
(A.S)
and independent if
AH t), A2(t).. . ., Aa/(G)
A-J >’)) P{ A2( I)) - - - P\ A.v( i.}) 
t A.9}
where P(- • ■) is the (joint) probability density function. This means that if a set of 
random variables are independent then they are also uncorrelated but not necessarily 
vice versa.

A.2. Fourier series representation
259
A.2 Fourier series representation
Generally the noise signals considered are extending over all time, -oc < t < co, 
and have infinite energies. Thus for a real valued random noise signal A(f) where 
—oc < i < co it is given that
Jim. J jA(/)|2d£ = co 
i A.1.0)
This means that the noise signal A(i) is not square integrable and thus it does not 
generally have a Fourier transform.1 Assuming that the noise signal A(i) has finite 
energy in the finite time interval -r < t < r where r > 0 then
lIt should be noted that it is a sufficient but actually not a necessary condition for a signal 
to have a Fourier transform that it is square integrable. For example the signal cos(2?r/t) where 
— :c < t < co has d Fourier transform though it is not square integrable.
J |AU)j2 dt < -co 
(A.11)
In this case the signal A(/) where -r*  < t < r can be represented as a Fourier series 
given by
*(
*)  = T VX) exp[j2-p?Z] 
(A. 12)
where
A(X) ~ f/ A(Z) exp!-j27rpff] dt 
(A.13)
f ~ 
(A. 14)
In Equation (A.12) the quantity A(pf) is a complex valued random variable in the 
random process describing the statistical properties of the random noise signal A(Z).
In Ill two suggestions for the frequency domain representation of random noise 
signals are given.
The first- suggestion is to represent A(Z) in a time interval -r < t < r and to 
assume A(Z) = 0 for |i| > r. The frequency domain representation in this case is the 
(integral) Fourier transform of A(Z) given as A(/) = A(Z) exp[-j27r/Z] dt.
The second suggestion is to assume that the random noise signal A(0 is periodic 
with period 2r such that A(l) — Aft + 2nr) where n is an integer. From this the 
frequency domain representation is given .as .a Fourier scries simitar to Equations 
(A.12), (A.13) and (A.14). However, the assumption that A(t') is periodic has the 
unfortunate consequence that the autocorrelation function is also periodic, such that 
R (t1, -■ 2) = # (ti, t-2 T 2 nr) w h ere ri is an int ege r. This also means that the coefficien ts

A. Mathematical concepts
of the Fourier series are orthogonal.2 Since J2) is generally not periodic for the 
type of signals considered in the present work this suggestion is not useful. If the 
systems under consideration are linear (single response) then it is not a problem that 
t'2) is periodic because there is no need for any evaluation between Fourier series 
coefficients at different frequencies. However, as some oi the systems considered in 
the present book are non-linear (multi-response) the periodicity of A(t) can not 
be assumed since there may very well be a correlation between two Fourier series 
coefficients at different frequencies.
"Two Fourier series coefficients Aifpii;) and AHpjf) are said to be orthogonal if 
A2tp2s)/ = 0 for all integers pi ami p2 except when pi — p?
3The Dirac function is a generalized function defined by
[ 
- a) da - y(/)
This as a consequence implies that
f 5(a) da = 1 A 5(ca) = -5(a) A g(a) 8(f — a) = g[f) 6(f - a)
An extensive analysis of generalized functions has been made by Lighthill [2].
Since it is most useful to have some kind of Fourier series representation in the 
present work, none of the suggestions made in [1] are useful.
The Fourier transform of the random noise signal A(7) in Equation (A. 12) is 
given by
A(/) = Eww-X) 
(A. 15)
p=-oo
where d(- • •)' is the Dirac £-function.3 It is seen from Equation (A.15) that the 
frequency resolution in the spectrum of A(/) is given by A. This frequency resolu­
tion can be made arbitrarily small by choosing r sufficiently large. To prove that 
Equation (A. 12) is fulfilled in the time interval -t < t < r it suffices to show that
/i

(A.19)

A.2. Fourier series representation
261
Using the fact that |a|2 = a a*  in Equation (A.16) gives four terms. The first term 
can be determined as
= fl(t.i) 
(A.20)
The second and third terms express the correlation between the time domain signal 
and a Fourier series coefficient as
(A(i) 
exp[-;2-p?t])
' p=-oo
= iz / A*(tj)
 exp[J2irp$ti]<fti) exp[-j2a-pft]

The fourth and last term expresses the correlation between two Fourier series coef­
ficients as 
oo oo

X exp[J27Tpift]
- 
^2 -E(^Pis) exp[7'2~p^t] 
- 
(A.23)
Pl = -2O
Thus insertion of Equations (A.20) - (A.23) into Equation (A.16) using R(t, t) = 
R*(t,t)
 since A(i) is a real valued signal completes the proof.
It can be shown [3] that if the autocorrelation function 
is periodic with

A. Mathematical concepts
However, in general this property is not valid since the autocorrelation function 
7?(U,A) is generally not periodic.
Example A.l Consider a white noise random variable A(t) extending over al! time 
—oo < t < 00 with the autocorrelation function
= 
c<5( t2 - G) 
(A.26)
where c is a positive real constant. The correlation between the frequency domain 
representation of AU) at two arbitrary frequencies A and f2 can be determined as
(A(/i) A*(/

A(i1) 
exp[j27r/2Z2]
= y _/ 6(72 - h) exp 
- /2(2)j dtx dt2
= 
- A) 
(A.27)
This means that the correlation of white noise at two different frequencies. J\ f2, is 
zero and that there is correlation not equal to zero only when the two frequencies are 
identical, J\ = /A.
Example A.2 Consider a white noise random variable A(f) in a finite time interval 
— r < t < r where the correlation between two Fourier coefficients of arbitrary frequem 
cies A and A is to be determined. The autocorrelation function for the time domain 
random variable A(f) is
f" -/<'<-

The correlation between the two Fourier series coefficients is given by
(A(A)A’(A)> =

As the factor c in Equation (A.29) generally increases with r, the ensemble average of 
the two Fourier series coefficients is zero for A f2 and some non-zero quantity for

A.3 Signal energy and average power
The total energy £tot of a random noise signal A(f) averaged over the ensemble of 
realizations is given by
£tot = (P

= /_ J!A(/)!2) J/ 
(A.33)
Equation (A.33) is based on the assumption that A(t) is square integrable and that 
exp[j27r(/i — f-2)t] dt — d(/i ~ h)- Equation (A.31) the quantity Etoi can be 
interpreted as the total energy in joules if the right-hand side of Equation (A.31) is 
divided by 1 Q where A(i) is a voltage or multiplied by 1 S where A(t) is a current. 
The case for A(/) in Equation (A.33) is similar. Note from Equation (A.31) that if 
A(2) is not square integrable then Stot = oo. Usually the total energy of a random 
noise signal is of no interest as the signals are only observed in some finite time 
interval.
The average power in a random noise signal A(t) observed in the time interval 
-r < t < t is given by
P

If A( i) is represented as a Fourier series in the time interval —t < t < r then the 
average power is given by

Thus the total average power is determined by summing the ensemble average of the 
magnitude squared Fourier series coefficients at all the relevant frequencies. From 
Equation (A.39) an average power density is defined as
p'(n = <|A(ni2)
(A.40)
where it is assumed that r is chosen so large that there exists an integer p such that 
p£ = f. It should be noted that f in Equation (A.40) runs over both positive and 
negative frequencies.

Determination of Volterra transfer 
functions using Maple
The present appendix contains program listings for a Maple V Release 3 program to 
determine algebraic expressions for Vol terr a transfer functions. Also the Maple V 
source code for the examples in chapter 9 are included. The two functions list gen 
and vtf must be in the same file called volfun. Before the functions can be used the 
user must read the volfun file into a Maple. V session, and then run the command: 
volfun [listgen] (4):. This generates some tables that are used by the volfun 
program.
