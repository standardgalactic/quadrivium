Computer Requirements 
for 
BLENDER
To run Blender, your computer must meet a minimum speciﬁcation.
Hang on! Don’t close the book. Read on.
The minimum (basic usage) requirement is:
32-bit dual core 2 GHz CPU with SSE2 support
2 GB RAM
24 bits 1280 × 768 display
Mouse or trackpad
OpenGL 2.1 compatible graphics with 512 MB RAM.
This speciﬁcation pretty much applies to most off the shelf laptop computers 
which retail in the lower price range. You should therefore be good to go with 
most personal computers (PCs). Of course, the bigger the better and that certainly 
applies to the monitor display. There is a lot of info on the Blender interface so the 
bigger the screen the better. If you have a small laptop, hook it up to a reasonably 
sized monitor and I would recommend plugging in a USB wheel mouse. This gives 
a more enjoyable experience.

Test Drive 
BLENDER
Discover Computer Graphics
Take a test drive in Blender and discover what’s under the hood. The power is 
fantastic, the controls will take you to places you never dreamed of, and what you 
can create is limited only by your imagination.
Go! Take a test drive and get hooked on Blender. Become a Blenderhead and 
create fantastic Computer Graphics.
This book will introduce you to the controls and steer you toward understanding what 
Blender can do. The program is a fantastic application with which you can create 3D 
(three-dimensional) models of objects and characters. The objects and characters 
can be placed in scenes. The scenes are captured by camera and rendered into 
digital images. The objects and characters can be animated and then, again, captured 
by camera and rendered to video ﬁles. Video ﬁles are then compiled into movies.
This book will show you how to make the Blender program go through some 
of its paces and give you an insight into this fantastic world. You will be shown 
the controls and given operation instructions allowing you to activate a variety of 
Blender’s features.
Blender is crammed full of features and the trick is to be aware of them and learn 
how to combine the features to do what you want.
 

viii
The book does not attempt to show you everything. It cannot. There is far far too 
much. The book contains merely a sample of what the program can do. It’s like 
opening the corner of a box of chocolates and selecting a few yummy pieces to taste. 
You can get hooked on chocolate. You can get hooked on Blender. After trying a 
sample, I’m sure you will want to continue munching and discover everything there 
is. Like chocolate, you can never have enough.
It is hoped that you will become interested and encouraged to pursue the world of 
computer modeling and animation using Blender.

Author
Hi! My name is John.
I was born in England, in the county of Wiltshire, in the town of Swindon in 1942. 
I have written this book in 2016, so you can do the math and ﬁgure out my age.
You may well ask, what’s an old dude doing writing a book on how to run a computer 
graphics program?
PCs certainly weren’t around when I was a kid. Neither were televisions nor mobile 
phones. Most people didn’t have a telephone in their home and most people didn’t 
have a car. When I was born the bombs were still dropping during the World War II 
and they didn’t stop until a couple of years later.
I had a poorly start, as a kid, got sick and spent a lot of time in hospital. When I 
went to school I discovered I couldn’t spell but I could draw pictures and I could 
make things. At 10-years old I emigrated to Canada with my family and went 
through school in British Columbia. I continued to draw and tried my hand at wood 
carving. There’s a lot of wood in British Columbia. Following school I returned to 
England by myself and became an apprentice to an engineering company. Being 
an apprentice meant you signed a contract for 5 years and worked and studied to 
become something useful in life. Boy, you sure worked and I learned to do what I 
was told. I’m not too sure if I ever became useful but I became a draughtsman and 
spent my life drawing and making things.
 

xvi
When I ﬁnished my apprenticeship I returned to Canada and worked in Vancouver 
for several months. This proved to be a mere stepping stone in life’s journey since I 
made the big jump to a life down under in Australia. I continued drafting, did further 
studies, and graduated to designing. I couldn’t escape from wood. I eventually 
became a sales engineer in sawmill machinery manufacturing.
In all of my working life there were no computers. Engineering calculations were 
assisted by using a slide rule and trigonometric tables. You can Google those to 
ﬁnd out what they are. My only computer at work was a scientiﬁc calculator.
When retired I had to ﬁnd something to do. I tried woodcarving for a while. Won a 
few prizes, didn’t make any money but had fun.
      
Then I discovered the computer and Blender with all its buttons and panels and 
sliders and windows, which were a mystery. Engineering is about solving mysteries 
so I began solving the mysteries of Blender and thought I would save you some 
time by passing on what I have discovered.
I think Blender is a fantastic program that allows you to be creative in the modern 
world. Have a go.
Happy Blending.

Chapter 1 
Introduction
What Is Blender?
Blender is a computer graphics program for making three-dimensional (3D) models 
of characters and objects. The characters and objects are placed in scenes like the 
one shown in the picture above. Parts of the scene are captured as digital images 
or a series of images then rendered into image ﬁles or video. The scene in the 
picture is from a Blender game called Yo Frankie!
You can make computer games with Blender.
What Is Computer Graphics?
Computer graphics is the process of using a computer to make still pictures and 
moving pictures just like all the ads and cartoons you see on TV. You also use 
computer graphics to make games like the ones on your i-pad or i-phone.
1

2
Yes! You can make your own games.
How Much Does Blender Cost?
Blender is absolutely FREE! It doesn’t cost anything. You can download the 
program and use it for anything you wish.
Amazing Images Made with Blender
      
 

3
It’s easy to show you pictures in a book but not so easy to show you examples of 
video.
Grab your computer and head over to the Blender website to see some fantastic 
demo reels.
www.blender.org
This is the website where you get the program. When you are on the Blender 
page, click on Features in the border at the top. It’s not surprising that some of 
Blender’s fantastic features are shown on the next page that opens. To see the 
video demonstrations click on Demo Reels in the header just below the big colored 
window at the top of the page. Click on the little white triangle in any of the windows 
and see some amazing stuff.
 

4
How Do I Get Blender?
You can download the Blender program from the same website where you found 
the Demo Reel.
If you know how to download and 
install programs, you won’t want 
to read through a whole bunch of 
instructions so I have put these at 
the back of the book. If you need 
some help with downloading, 
read through the instruction page 
and if you need to, ask for help.
When you have the program 
installed, you are ready to ﬁnd 
out how to drive Blender. It’s like learning to drive a car. You have to know which 
buttons and pedals to push to make it do what you want and Blender has a lot of 
pedals.
Learning to drive will get you used to reading and following the instructions. This is 
very important since I write in a peculiar way. You have to be peculiar to write this 
stuff.
Before I start the driving lesson on how to drive the program, I have to assume that 
you know how to drive the computer. The computer can be a PC or a laptop but it 
is preferable that you have a keyboard—and a mouse.
 

5
Blender is designed to be operated using a keyboard and a three-button mouse. 
The mouse can be a wheel mouse. That’s the one with a scroll wheel in the middle 
which acts as a middle mouse button (MMB). You can use the laptop touch pad 
but you will have to learn special keystrokes to do this. I recommend you connect 
a mouse to your laptop.
Start Your Engine
OK! You have Blender installed. Place your 
mouse cursor on the desktop icon and give 
it a double click with the left mouse button 
(LMB).
This Is What You See
 

6
If Blender doesn’t open full size on your screen, click the Expansion button.
I told you Blender has a lot of buttons and pedals. We call the pedals things like 
Windows, Panels, Headers, Buttons, Sliders, Selection Drop Down Menus, etc. 
There is a lot of “et cetera.” Don’t Freak Out! You will soon get the hang of it.
The Blender Screen Arrangement
The Start Screen shows ﬁve different Windows with a Splash Screen in the 
middle. The splash screen shows you what version of BLENDER you have and 
gives you some links to websites.
When you click with your mouse cursor in the 3D Window, the Splash Screen 
disappears.
Blender is updated regularly as the developers tweak and improve things and add 
more fantastic features. Each time the program is updated, the Splash Screen 
is changed so you know what version you have. The program doesn’t update 
automatically. You have to visit the Blender website and download and install the 
new version.
What Are Windows?
Windows are the different panels into which the screen is divided. They have 
nothing to do with the “Windows Operating System” which allows you to run the 
Blender program. You may be running a different operating system. The different 
Windows are:
The 3D Window—This is the main workspace which is a view of a 3D World.
The Info (Information) Window—Gives you access to controls.
The Outliner Window—Shows you a list of everything in the 3D Window.
The Timeline Window—Is where you set up and operate animations.
The Properties Window—Contains information about things in the 3D Window.
 

7
Don’t be concerned about the detail of what all the Windows with all the buttons do at 
this point. Everyone ﬁnds the arrangement confusing when they ﬁrst see it. Blender 
can do lots and lots of things so 
you would expect lots and lots of 
buttons. As you can see there are 
lots and lots. As you work through 
the book, the windows and buttons 
will be explained as you need to 
know them.
Take a Look at the 3D Window
Now that doesn’t look so bad when you take a closer look. It’s pretty simple.
 

8
The 3D Window is divided into three panels. The main 3D Window where you do 
the work. The Tool Panel and the Header contain buttons and subpanels where 
you click your mouse to access settings for things in the 3D Window.
In the 3D Window Main Panel you see that there is a Cube Object, a Lamp, and 
a Camera. There is also a Midplane Grid.
The Camera will take a picture of whatever it is pointed at in the 3D Space. The 3D 
Space is very dark without some lighting so a Lamp is provided for illumination. The 
Midplane Grid gives you a reference for placing things in the 3D Space. Imagine 
being in real space far away from the nearest planet or star. It would be nice to have 
a grid to know which way is up and how far away from something you were.
If you look closely at the grid, you will see there is a green line at the center running 
from left to right and a red line running from the back to the front. These are the X 
and Y axes. There is another axis which is the Z axis (not shown) which runs up 
and down in space. You see all three axes in the lower left-hand corner of the main 
window panel.
Let’s Do Something!
I know you are just raring to go and push some buttons and make something 
happen so let’s do something just to give you a feel. This is going to change your 
3D Window view so we will show you how to get back to square one when you 
mess up. This is a good thing to know.
The Cube Object in your 3D Window will look like this. 
The orange outline shows that the Cube is selected. It has 
red, green, and blue arrows pointing away from its center. This 
arrow arrangement is the Manipulation Widget.
What’s a Widget? I saw that one coming.
The Oxford Dictionary says a widget is any small device that you do not know the 
name of. Not very helpful is it? I guess it must be the same as a thingamyjig or a 
whatsit.
The Widget in our case lets you move something about in 3D Space, keeping in a 
straight line. Try it out. Place your mouse cursor on any of the arrows, click LMB, 
hold and drag the mouse in the direction of the arrow. Release the mouse button 
to set the cube in its new position. Click and drag in the opposite direction.
 

9
Look at the 3D Window Header. The Widget has different modes. Try them out.
You can also move the Cube Object freely by pressing the G Key on the keyboard, 
dragging the mouse then clicking LMB to release. G stands for Grab.
One thing to note here is the Cube Object has an orange outline (we call this the 
Default Cube since it appears by default when you start a new BLENDER Scene). 
The outline indicates that this Object is selected. When you have more than one 
Object in a scene, you have to select the one you want to work on. You select an 
Object by clicking with the right mouse button (RMB). The orange outline appears. 
To deselect an Object, press the A key on the keyboard.
More Moving About
Let’s really get the scene scrambled. Look at the Num Pad (Number Pad) on the 
keyboard. The Num Pad can be used to rotate the 3D Window and change it to 
different perspective views.
 

10
Look at the upper RH (right hand) corner of the 3D Window. You will see User 
Perspective written in small white letters. This means you are seeing a perspective 
view of the 3D World. Perspective is where all the edges of things appear to point 
toward a single point on an imaginary horizon. Have a play with the keys. Press 
the keys in the order below or at random. The idea here is to scramble the view in 
the window.
Num Pad 7 Top perspective view
Num Pad 5 Top orthographic view
Num Pad 1 Front orthographic view
Num Pad 3 Right orthographic view
Num Pad 4, 6, 8, and 2 Rotates the view
Num Pad 0 Camera view (shows you what the camera sees)
Believe it or not there is a logical sequence in all of this and you will understand it 
with a little practice.
Also try clicking and holding the MMB and dragging the mouse. That should really 
mess up the view.
Getting Back to Square One
If (when) you ﬁnd yourself in a pickle, you have completely messed up or you just 
don’t like what you have made sometimes it’s best to start over with a clean slate.
 

11
To start over, go to the Info Window Header and click on File. Click on New.
Clicking on New reloads the Blender default screen arrangement. A warning 
message appears saying, doesn’t save the current ﬁle. This means that if you 
haven’t saved your work it will be lost. Don’t worry about this just now. I will talk 
about saving later.
Also when you click New, a window appears where you have to click Reload 
Start-Up File. This gives you a second chance to save if you want to.
So far you have only been messing about with messing up the scene so you don’t 
need to save anything. You will learn how to do that later.
For now just click on Reload Start-Up File and Blender will do just that, and put 
the 3D Window back to the way it was when you ﬁrst started. You are back to 
square one.
 

12
I know you are itching to do something so we will make a scene and make an 
image. In the process I will show you a few more of Blender’s features and get you 
used to following these peculiar instructions. This will be like Shannon ﬂying before 
he hatched from the egg. We will probably get scrambled. It will also be like playing 
with ﬁre.
Taking a test drive is fun but when you are trying something new there is always 
a process of trial and error. Sometimes you will lose your way, sometimes you will 
break down, and sometimes you will crash. Crashing Blender is part of the learning 
process.
The Properties Window
In demonstrating how to manipulate what you see on the computer screen by 
rotating the view or moving an Object, you have been working within the 3D Window. 
This is where you will make models of things and set up scenes and animate the 
models to move. The 3D Window is the windscreen in front of the driver’s seat. The 
mouse is the steering wheel. The Properties Window is the dashboard containing 
the buttons and switches for controlling things.
Do not attempt to memorize what all the buttons and switches do. Just like driving 
a new car for the ﬁrst time you can get by with a few basics like a pedal to push 
to make the car go, a pedal to make it stop, and a steering wheel to point it in the 
right direction. You can worry about the overdrive and headlights and the stereo 
system later.
 

13
Look at the 12 buttons along the top of the Properties Window. I’m not including the 
Properties Window icon in the count.
The ﬁrst four buttons display control tabs with buttons and sliders for adjusting 
values which control how an image of the scene in the 3D Window or an animation 
is rendered.
Rendering is the process of converting what you see in the 3D Window into a 
digital image or movie ﬁle.
The remaining eight buttons display control tabs for controlling the properties of 
an Object that you have selected in the 3D Window. Each Object has its own set 
of properties. Selecting a different Object displays the properties which have been 
assigned to the selected Object.
Objects are anything included in the 3D Window Scene. That is, any model you 
have made or imported, any lamps, and any camera.
 

14
Changing Values
As you progress through the examples in the book I will give instructions to change 
numeric values. Where values are displayed in the Blender interface, they are 
usually in a panel as shown here in the Properties Window.
The Properties Window is at the RHS (right-hand side) of the default Blender 
screen.
The window displays by default with the Render buttons active which is one of 12 
button selections available.
 

15
The Value Panel is a Slider, which means you can click LMB in the panel, hold the 
mouse button down, and drag the mouse left to right to change the value.
Alternatively you may click LMB in the panel (the value shifts to the left of the 
panel), press delete on your keyboard, and retype a new value. Press Enter.
The two little arrows at either end of the panel allow you to click LMB and 
incrementally increase or decrease the value.
 

 

17
Chapter 2 
Playing With Fire
Playing With Fire
This will be EXCITING! I won’t explain much about what is going on or why you are 
doing things. I just want to show you some neat stuff and get you interested. Along 
the way, I will introduce you to some of the Blender controls.
In the introduction, we looked at the 3D Window with the Cube Object located 
at the center of the World. The Cube Object is one of ten Primitive shapes with 
which you start to make models of all different sorts of things.
You can join the shapes together and change the shape of the shape to whatever 
you want. I will explain how to do that later on.
2

18
Let’s change the Cube in the 3D Window to a different shape. A sphere is a nice 
shape for demonstrating. You will see in the diagram that there are two sphere 
types; UV Sphere and Ico Sphere. We will use the UV Sphere.
In the 3D Window have the Cube Object selected (orange outline). Press the 
X Key on the keyboard then click LMB OK Delete to remove the cube. To add 
a sphere into the scene, there are two methods. You will ﬁnd that there is nearly 
always more than one way to do something.
How to Add a Sphere
To add a Sphere Object click on Add in the 3D Window Header then place 
the mouse cursor over Mesh and click on UV Sphere in the selection menu that 
appears. A UV Sphere will be placed in the 3D Window wherever the 3D Window 
cursor has been located.
The second method is to press 
Shift + A Key on the keyboard 
with the mouse cursor in the 3D 
Window. This opens the same 
selection menu in the 3D Window. 
Click on UV Sphere.
 

19
Set the Sphere on Fire
With the sphere selected (orange outline) and the mouse cursor in the 3D 
Window, press the Space Bar on the keyboard. Pressing the Space Bar opens 
a Search Window. Type “Quick Smoke” in the panel at the top of the Search 
Window. The single entry Quick Smoke will be in the list below. Click on Quick 
Smoke.
The 3D Window will change showing the sphere as a Wire Frame mesh inside a 
cuboid.
In the bottom LH (left hand) corner of the 3D Window at the bottom of the 
Tool Panel, you will see Quick Smoke with a Smoke Style panel with Smoke 
inside. Click on the panel and select: Smoke + Fire.
This has set Blender to produce a Simulation of the sphere burning. The Simulation 
is an Animation. Animations are played in the Timeline Window.
 

20
The Timeline Window
The Timeline Window has buttons similar to those on a CD or video player. To see 
the sphere burning, simply press the Play button. The animation plays for a set 
time then repeats until you press Stop. Once you have pressed the Play button, it 
changes to a Stop button.
Press the Stop button somewhere in the middle of the animation to see a still 
view of the burning Sphere. Press the Go To Start button to start the animation 
over.
 

21
There are a lot of settings and controls in the Timeline Window but for now only use 
the buttons described. Press the Go To Start button, then in the Tool Panel, Quick 
Smoke tab, select the different Smoke Style options. Play an animation for each 
option and see the different effects.
The rocket is another quick example using Quick Smoke. It has a small UV Sphere 
on ﬁre placed at the end of a second UV Sphere which has been scaled to form 
the rocket shape.
 

22
Before you can make things and use Quick Smoke to add effects, you have to learn 
about modeling and applying Materials.
In the example of the Quick Smoke method, a UV Sphere has been used as a 
model. Remember the sphere is one of ten Primitive shapes in Blender. You may 
use any of these as well as any model that you make.
As an example work through the following exercise.
Start a new Blender Scene and delete the default Cube. Add a Mesh, Circle Object 
(press Alt + A Key and select Mesh—Circle). Remember selecting means clicking 
LMB on the item in the menu.
The Circle Object is entered in the Scene at the location of the 
3D Window Cursor. The 3D Window Cursor is the little dotted 
circle with the cross hairs.
By default this cursor is located at the center of the Scene in 
the 3D Window but when you click (LMB) anywhere in the 3D 
Window the cursor gets located at wherever you click.
 

23
To put the 3D Window cursor back at the center of the Scene, press Shift + S 
Key on the keyboard to bring up the Snap menu, then select Cursor to Center 
from the menu.
When an Object is added to a Scene, it is 
entered in Object Mode. If you were to use 
the Quick Smoke method at this time and 
pressed Play in the Timeline Window, you 
would be very disappointed to see that there 
is no smoke or ﬁre.
When you entered the Circle Object, you selected Mesh then Circle from the menu. 
You selected a Mesh Object as being a shape made out of something like a ﬁshing 
net or a piece of chicken coop wire. There are strands of twine or wire joined where 
they intersect. As an example, look at a UV Sphere Mesh Object.
The image shows a sphere in Wireframe Display Mode which illustrates the 
concept.
Objects in the 3D Window can be viewed in different Viewport Shading modes.
 

24
The UV Sphere in Edit Mode also illustrates the mesh concept.
Let’s get back to the Circle Mesh Object.
The circle displays in Object Mode as an orange circle. In Edit Mode, you have the 
same circle but you also have little orange dots spaced around the circumference. 
Think of the circle as separate short pieces of wire joined at each end forming a 
circle. The joints are called Vertices. Now, if you tried to set a wire circle on ﬁre, you 
will have a hard time doing it. On the other hand if you have a piece of wire mesh with 
some combustible fabric stretched over it, you will be able to set the fabric on ﬁre.
What you have to do is form the circle into a mesh with a surface.
With the circle selected in the 3D Window (orange outline) in Object Mode, press 
the Tab Key to place it in Edit Mode. You will have an orange circle with the 
vertices (dots) all selected. Get your hand off your mouse, press the E Key 
(extrude) and press Enter. It appears as if nothing has changed but, in fact, you 
have duplicated a set of vertices which are superimposed over the original set.
 

25
Have your mouse cursor positioned in 
the 3D Window off to one side. Press 
the S Key (scale). The mouse cursor 
arrow changes to a white cross on 
top of a black arrow with a broken line 
connected to the center of the circle. 
Move the mouse cursor toward the 
center of the circle. Only move slightly, 
which moves the duplicated set of 
vertices in. You now have an outer and inner set of vertices forming a ring.
The spaces between the vertices are shown gray which indicates that they are 
ﬁlled in or faced. The faces are your fabric. Tab back to Object Mode and apply the 
Quick Smoke method as you did for the UV Sphere.
Before you apply Quick Smoke, rotate the ring on either the X or Y axis by pressing 
the R Key (rotate) + X or Y and moving your mouse. Place other objects in the 
scene.

Chapter 3 
Quick Explode
Exploding the Quick Way
The previous chapter showing how to set something on ﬁre is one of Blender’s 
quick methods. Exploding also has a Quick Method. In a new Blender scene 
replace the default Cube with a UV Sphere.
A plain old gray sphere isn’t very exciting so let’s give it some color.
This is where the Properties Window comes into play. That’s the 
window at the RHS of the screen with a row of buttons in the Header
at the top and squillions of buttons and sliders and settings going 
down to the bottom of the screen.
When you ﬁrst look at the Properties Window and you look at the buttons in the 
Header, you see the Render button option active. Underneath are the controls for 
setting how you want a picture or a video to be made.
3

28
At this point we are not concerned with the Render buttons, instead we want to 
select the Material button. For the time being, think of Materials as Color.
Therefore for Color go to the Properties Window, Material button, click on New.
Clicking on New will open buttons for controlling the color of the Object that you 
have selected in the 3D Window. We have the UV Sphere selected so the buttons 
 

29
will control the color of the sphere. If you had some other Object selected, the 
buttons would affect that Object.
In Blender, color is controlled by the Material buttons. Color is only one part of 
what an Object looks like. You can have a red sphere but it can be any shade of 
red or it could be shiny or dull or it could reﬂect other colors from other Objects. 
This is why we refer to an Objects’ Material rather than its color.
When you click the New button, the Properties Window expands showing the 
controls for setting the Material color. To color the UV Sphere, click in the white 
panel in the Diffuse tab. (I will refer to the different panels in the Properties Window 
as tabs.) A new panel opens with a colored circle shown. Click anywhere in the 
circle to select a color for the sphere.
 

30
The Diffuse color is the base color of the Object. The Specular color in the tab 
underneath Diffuse is the color of highlights on a glossy surface. Click in the 
Specular color bar, select a color, and play with the Intensity slider. You will see the 
shiny spot on the sphere in the Preview Window change.
OK! OK! The Exploding
With our nice colored UV Sphere 
selected in the 3D Window and 
the Mouse cursor in the window, 
press the Space Bar on the 
keyboard.
In the Search panel, type Quick 
Explode 
and 
select 
Quick 
Explode from the options.
Ready to go! Press the Play button in the Timeline Window Header.
Oops! The sphere just fell apart and disappeared off the bottom of the screen. 
When you press Stop in the middle of the animation, you see the broken sphere 
hanging in space. If you press the Return to Start button, you have a cluster of 
broken bits.
 

31
The sphere breaks into pieces and falls because there is a gravitational force effect 
applied. You will turn that off in a moment. Look at the lower left of the screen in 
the Tools Panel. You will see Quick Explode controls. Each of the gray bars are 
sliders where you change values. Click, hold, and drag in the Amount of Pieces 
slider bar and make the value approximately 700. Replay the animation and see 
the difference.
Change the Outward Velocity value to 10 and see a real explosion when you 
replay the animation. Gravity is still in effect but it doesn’t have time to do much.
If you return to the Quick Explode Tool Panel and reduce the Outward Velocity 
value to something really low like 0.73, when you play the animation the pieces of 
the sphere ﬂoat out into space.
BUT HEY! Where do they go?
Look at the Timeline Window when you play the animation. A green line moves 
from left to right. This is the Timeline Cursor. Note the numbers along the bottom 
 

32
of the Timeline. These are Frames in the animation (like the frames in a piece 
of old movie ﬁlm). The green line moves from Frame 1 to Frame 250 then the 
animation replays. But note the Duration and End Frame values in the Tool Panel. 
Although the animation in the Timeline is playing for 250 frames, the life of the 
broken sphere parts lasts only for 50 frames. You can play with these values and 
see the different effects.
Look what happens when you have three separate spheres with different colors 
and different Outward Velocity values.
All spheres are located in the same space at the center of the scene, but when 
they  explode the parts ﬂy apart at different speeds and you see the different 
colors.
 

33
A rendered image of the Scene is not very spectacular.
A second render with a simple tweak is much more spectacular.
To produce these renders, it will be better if you take the long road and understand 
a little more about the BLENDER controls.
 

 

35
Chapter 4 
Exploding the Long Way
Exploding the Long Way
Using the quick method to explode in Blender is easy and fun but taking the long 
way round teaches you even more cool stuff. You can still start with the same UV 
Sphere and give it a Material (color) but then you apply a Particle System and a 
Modiﬁer.
A Particle System makes an object throw off little dots which show as fuzzy points 
of light when you make a picture. Sort of like fuzzy stars. You can control how the 
Particles ﬂy and move and make them look like other things.
When you use Particles for exploding a sphere, you make the broken bits of the 
sphere follow the particles.
A Modiﬁer is a prearranged piece of computer code which makes something 
happen. Don’t worry you don’t have to be a coder nor understand the code, you 
just have to know which buttons to press.
4

36
Let’s Make a Particle System
Have your UV Sphere selected in the 3D Window then go over and look at the 
Properties Window Header. Find the Particles button.
Yes! There are more buttons and panels and sliders and 
controls.
Blender is a very powerful tool that can make fantastic 
effects. To drive it is like ﬂying a jumbo jet. There are lots 
and lots of switches in the cockpit. No one learns to ﬂy an 
airplane in 5 minutes and they never start off in a jumbo.
With all the buttons showing you have applied a Particle 
System to the UV Sphere and this has automatically set 
up an animation. Look in the Timeline Window and you 
will see a faint red line across the bottom. This shows 
that an animation sequence is in place.
Remember Gravity! That is also working.
Press Play in the Timeline Window Header.
 

37
Particles are emitted from the surface of the sphere and fall under the effect 
of Gravity. The Particles continue to be emitted until just before the end of the 
animation sequence in the Timeline.
You can click the Stop button and then the Go To Start button.
Click, hold, and drag the green Timeline Window Cursor to the right to see the 
particles at different positions in the animation.
Turn Gravity off and replay (Properties Window, Scene buttons, Gravity tab).
This time the Particles ﬂoat off into space but they only stay in view for 50 frames. 
If you look in the Properties Window, Particles buttons, Emission tab, you will 
see a Lifetime value: 50.000. If you increase this value (click, hold, and drag in the 
panel), the Particles will remain visible longer.
 

38
To give you a taste of how you can control the particles go to the start at Frame 1 
then in the Properties Window, Particle buttons, Velocity tab, and change the 
Emitter Object: Y value to 10. This gives the particles a start speed in the Y 
direction when they are emitted so they shoot off along the Y axis in the scene.
When you Render (Press F12) and make the Camera View in the 3D Window into 
a picture, you see the Particles as fuzzy points of light. They are the same color 
as the Sphere’s Material.
Let’s Blow It Up
To blow the sphere up (make it ﬂy apart), 
we add an Explode Modiﬁer.
You must have the Particle System in 
place ﬁrst.
In the Properties Window Header, click 
on the Modiﬁer button.
 

39
You will see that there is a Modiﬁer already applied which is the Particle System. 
Click on the Add Modiﬁer button and in the selection menu that displays under 
Simulate, click on Explode.
The Explode Modiﬁer is added to the Modiﬁer Stack (Modiﬁers are stacked one on 
top of the other in the Properties Window).
In the Timeline Window, play the animation again and see the sphere disintegrate 
with parts ﬂying off in the same direction as the particles.
Render an image (press F12).
 

40
Exploding a Different Way
There are always more ways than one to do something depending on the effect 
that you want. We will make a simple ﬁreworks type of explosion.
Start a new Blender scene and replace the default Cube with a UV Sphere.
Scale the sphere down. To do this precisely so that you 
get the same results that I will show you, press the N Key 
on your keyboard to display the Object Properties panel 
at the RHS of the 3D Window.
Remember, the properties in the panel are for the Object 
that is selected in the 3D Window. In this case, the Object 
is the UV Sphere.
With the mouse cursor in the 3D Window, press the S 
Key (Scale) and move the cursor toward the sphere. You 
will see the scale values in the Object Properties panel 
change as you move the mouse. Move the mouse until 
the X, Y, and Z values equal 0.30, then click LMB to set 
the value.
Change the 3D Window to Camera View (press Num Pad 0). Click LMB on the 
blue handle of the Manipulation Widget (blue arrow, vertical Z axis), hold, and 
drag the sphere to the top of the Camera viewport.
 

41
In the Properties Window, Material buttons, click on the New button to apply a 
material to the sphere. Blender will apply the default gray Material (color). This is 
ﬁne for the moment but also by default the Material Type is set as Surface. This is 
deﬁning how the object is rendered when an image is created. Change this to type 
Halo by simply clicking the Halo button.
The UV Sphere in the 3D Window changes from a solid sphere to a sphere made 
up of a group of orange dots.
You can see the different render effects by clicking on each option (Surface, Wire, 
Volume, Halo) and pressing F12 to render an image with the different options. 
Remember, press Esc to cancel the rendered view.
Another way? Yes, there is always another way.
Up until now we have been seeing things in the 3D Window in Solid Viewport 
Shading mode. There are other options.
In the 3D Window header, next to 
Object Mode is the Viewport Shading 
options button (selection menu). You 
may select the different options and see 
the different ways things display in the 
3D Window. In later versions of Blender, 
there is the Rendered option which 
puts the 3D Window into Render mode 
letting you see how the Scene will look 
when rendered. The same as pressing 
F12 on the keyboard.
 

42
To see the different Material Render effects, have the 3D Window in Rendered 
Viewport Shading mode and select the different Material Render options in turn.
In our case, with the Material Render, Halo option selected, the sphere  displays 
in the 3D Window as a group of orange dots when in Solid Viewport Shading 
mode. In Rendered Viewport Shading mode, it displays as a fuzzy ball of 
white light.
The orange dots are actually the vertices 
of the mesh surface of the sphere. The 
Material Render, Halo option says, displays 
the vertices as little points of light so the 
group of orange dots looks like a ball of 
light when rendered.
If you change the Material color of the UV 
Sphere, the dots will display as whatever 
color you select and the ball of light will be 
that color.
Note: With the material Halo option 
selected, the Properties Window, Materials 
buttons have changed. There is a Halo tab 
with controls for affecting the halo display, 
one of which is a color bar for selecting the 
Diffuse Material color.
Change Back to Solid Viewport Shading 
Mode
 

43
In the previous example of exploding we saw how the surface of the UV Sphere 
ﬂew apart following Particles. We will do the same thing this time but now the 
vertices showing as little points of light will follow the Particles.
The UV Sphere is still selected in the 3D Window. 
In the Properties Window add a Particle System.
Change the values as shown in the diagram. The 
main points in these settings are, we are making 
the particles emit in a random order, and that by 
setting the Start Frame to 50 and the End Frame 
to 55, the explosion takes place during ﬁve frames 
of the animation (at 24 Frames per second that is 
0.208 seconds).
If you play the animation with the 3D Window in 
Rendered Viewport Shading mode, at best nothing 
will happen or at worst the program will crash. The 
computer just cannot process the information in 
the time. Well, mine can’t.
Change back to Solid Viewport Shading, play the 
animation then move the Timeline Window cursor 
somewhere past Frame 55 and render an image 
(F12) or put the 3D Window in Rendered Viewport 
Shading mode.
Repositioning the Timeline Window cursor will 
cause the 3D Window to re-render.
 

44
You can add multiple spheres to the scene and experiment with different particle 
settings to create a real ﬁreworks display.
 

45
Chapter 5 
Modeling
Modeling
The question you have been asking all along is, “How do I make something?”
Here goes! You will have to follow carefully and sorry, but I will have to take you 
back to Moving About and expand on the subject. Sometimes there is no getting 
away with shortcuts.
Start a new Blender scene.
You will have the default screen arrangement with the gray 
Cube Object at the center.
Zoom in a little (scroll the mouse wheel if you have one or 
press Num Pad plus +).
The cube is selected as shown by its orange outline. When in this state, it is said 
to be in Object Mode. You see this in the 3D Window Header.
In Object Mode, you see the outer surfaces of the cube with a gray Material 
applied. The default Cube Object is the only object that has a material pre-
applied. When you enter other objects into a scene, you have to manually apply a 
Material (new objects display as the defauly gray but the Material is not applied).
5

46
At the beginning of the book, in the introduction, I brieﬂy talked about moving 
objects. This was mainly how to move in a straight line and how to rotate the scene 
in the 3D Window. Remember this diagram?
I said that you move an Object in a straight line by using the Manipulation 
Widget or by pressing the G Key and grabbing the Object. Since this is Blender 
there are more options. To demonstrate I will use the default Cube Object as a 
starter.
Moving Straight Line ..... Click on a Widget arrow and drag the mouse.
Press the G Key + X, Y, or Z and drag the mouse.
Moving Freely ................. Press the G Key, hold, and drag the mouse.
Rotating ..........................  Change the Widget to rotation mode. Click on one of 
the rotation handles (circles) and drag the mouse.
 
 Press the R Key + X, Y, or Z to rotate about an axis.
Scaling ............................  Change the Widget to scale mode. Click on one of 
the handles and move the mouse away or toward the 
object.
 

47
OK! Now you know how to move an Object and scale it. To model something 
in Blender, you start with any of the Primitive shapes that are available (press 
Shift + A for the selection menu).
Once you have selected a shape, you then modify (change) the shape.
 

48
To change a shape, you place the Object in Edit Mode. To do this, have the object 
selected, then simply press the Tab Key.
You can also change modes in the 3D Window Header but since you will be 
changing modes frequently it is much more convenient to press the Tab Key.
Look at the Cube Object in Edit Mode. What you see is the cube with little orange 
dots at the corners and orange edges. The dots are called Vertices and since they 
are all orange in color they are selected.
Press the A Key to deselect and press the A Key again to select. This procedure 
of pressing a key to select and deselect is called Toggling. Toggle to deselect the 
vertices.
In Edit Mode, you can select (click RMB) a single vertex and move it to reshape a 
Primitive.
 

49
The cube is OK as a starting point to explain the very basics of shaping by moving 
vertices, but I must admit it is not very exciting. There is only one Primitive in 
Blender that is anywhere near being complex which will show you how an object 
is constructed.
Meet Suzanne
Suzanne is a Monkey Object.
You ﬁnd Suzanne in with all the other Primitives.
That’s no reﬂection on Suzanne. It’s not nice to call 
her primitive just because you think you are so clever.
 

50
When you select Suzanne, she will show up on the screen as a plain old gray 
monkey looking to the left. The other way round.
I have given her a Material (color) and rotated her for a better look at her beautiful 
face.
Oh Yes! I have also changed the background color. I will show you how later.
You can deselect Suzanne’s vertices while she is in Edit Mode, then select a 
single vertex or even a group of vertices and move them about to make her even 
more beautiful. You select more than one vertex by holding the Shift Key while 
clicking RMB. If you have the Manipulation Widget turned on, the Widget locates 
to the center of the Vertex Group. You can use it to move the vertices.
Selecting vertices is only one way of changing the shape of an Object.
Look at the 3D Window Header while you are in Edit Mode.
Besides selecting Vertices, you can select Edges or Faces by changing the 
selection mode.
 

51
The Limit Selection to Visible button toggles between, allowing you to select 
only the vertex, edge, or face that you see on the screen (the front of an object) or 
vertices, edges, and faces that are on the back of an object.
OK! OK! We will but ﬁrst there is one more thing.
You will have to know how to Extrude.
Extrusion means taking a shape and stretching it out to form a different shape. 
A little while ago I translated a vertex to change the shape of a cube. When you 
extrude, you duplicate the selected vertices and reposition them to alter a shape.
To Extrude, select the vertices, edges, or faces. Press the E Key (Extrude). Drag 
the mouse and click when in position.
 

52
We are ready to go and make something. OK? We will make an aircraft.
Open a new Blender scene. Delete the default Cube and add a UV Sphere. Zoom 
in (scroll MMB or Num Pad +). Scale down on the Z axis (S Key + Z Key, drag the 
mouse toward the center of the sphere) as shown in the diagram.
Don’t make the pancake too thin.
When you open Blender, the 3D Window is shown on User Perspective view. 
Look in the top LH corner of the window and you will see User Perspective. Change 
to Top Orthographic view.
Yes it’s all a bit confusing but just keep on following 
along.
To change views, have the Mouse Cursor in the 3D Window and press Num Pad 
7. What you get is Top Perspective view. The give-away is the line radiating from 
the Lamp toward the ﬂattened sphere.
The Lamp???? Look for a black dot with two dotted circles. That’s the Lamp. Also 
look in the top LH corner of the window to see Top Perspective.
You want Top Orthographic so press Num Pad 5. Notice the line radiating 
from  the Lamp disappears since you are now looking straight down on the 
sphere.
Scale the sphere times 2 on the Y axis (Press S key + Y Key + 2 and LMB click).
 

53
You will be modeling the reshaped sphere and want it to be identical either side of 
the Y axis (the green line). That is to say you want it to be mirrored on the X axis 
(along the red line).
To mirror something place the sphere in Edit Mode and delete all the vertices on 
the LHS (left-hand side) of the Y axis (press the B Key for Box select, place the 
cursor as shown by the yellow cross, click and hold dragging a rectangle around 
the LHS vertices). Don’t forget to turn Limit Selection to Visible off. With the 
vertices selected, press the X Key and select Vertices to Delete. Place the UV 
Sphere in Object Mode (press Tab).
 

54
OK! What have we got? A long skinny pancake!
To continue, change the window to Right Orthographic view (press the 
Num Pad 3 Key).
Select the vertices as shown in the diagram (hold Shift and click RMB on each 
vertex).
Press Num Pad 7 to change back to Top Orthographic view. Press the E Key 
(Extrude) and use the Widget to move the vertices to the right.
With the Vertex Group still selected, press the S Key (scale) and scale the group 
in. Use the Widget to move the group down toward the back of the aircraft.
Change to Front Orthographic view (Press Num Pad 1). The Vertex Group 
remains selected. Press the E Key (Extrude) and move the extrusion up, then scale 
in (S Key, drag mouse toward the group). Finally use the Manipulation Widget to 
move the group back slightly.
 

55
Keep going you are nearly there.
Select a line of vertices on the center as shown and extrude up.
Scale the group in and move back.
 

56
Go into Object Mode, add a Material. In the Tool Panel at the LHS of the 3D 
Window click on the Smooth button. Rotate the 3D Window to see your super 
duper aircraft.
You have your aircraft model ﬁnished 
and placed in the 3D Window the way 
you want it, like this for instance.
Oh! By the way, I have changed the 3D 
Window background color to this pale 
green.
Changing the 3D Window background color 
is just one of many things you can change 
to suit your personal preferences. Guess 
what? There’s a User Preferences Window 
for doing it. Click on the 3D Window icon in 
the lower left of the window and select User 
Preferences.
 

57
The 3D Window changes to the User Preferences Window.
Wow! There are a lot of things to mess with here. Look at the top of this window 
and click on Themes (if it isn’t highlighted blue). Now look at the list at the left of 
the window with all the different window types. Click on 3D View.
With 3D View selected (highlighted blue) what you see is a whole bunch of colored 
panels (as shown above) which, when clicked, open color selection circles for the 
different parts of the 3D Window. You want the 3D Window background. You can 
look all you want but you won’t ﬁnd it. This is one of Blender’s peculiarities. To 
change the 3D Window background color, you click on the Gradient High/Off panel 
at the lower RHS of the window. In the color circle that displays, you can select a 
color and adjust the brightness with the vertical slider at the RHS of the panel.
 

58
When you have the color you like, you click Save User Settings at the bottom left 
of the window. Click on the icon in the corner and go back to the 3D Window.
A better way of opening the User Preferences Window is to click on File in the 
3D Window header, then select User Preferences from the menu. When you do it 
this way, the User Preferences Window opens at a reduced size on top of the 3D 
Window so, when you change the color, you see it happening as you make the 
change.
Changing 
the 
3D 
Window 
background color will not color the 
background of a rendered image. 
To do this you use the background 
settings in the Properties Window, 
World buttons. You will have to 
experiment with these to discover 
all the options but to get you started 
look at the Preview tab and the 
World tab.
In the World tab click on the Horizon Color bar and select a blue sky color in the 
color circle. Use the slider to adjust the brightness. You see the color in the Preview 
tab panel. Check (tick) Blend Sky to add a shading gradient.
 

59
The Properties Window, World buttons will show a preview.
Render an image (F12) to see the image background.
Experiment with the color bars and the Sky settings to see the differences.
 

60
A better way. Yes! A better way (there’s always a different way) is to use an Image 
Textures. You will have to wait until you learn about Textures before you can use 
this method. The image below gives you the idea.
 

61
Chapter 6 
Saving Your Work
Saving Work
Saving something like a model in Blender is simply saving the Blender ﬁle in which 
you made it. Blender ﬁles have a .blend ﬁle extension. That’s the bit you put on the 
end of the File Name.
For example: If I want to save a ﬁle in which I have made onions, I would name 
the ﬁle:
My_Onions.blend
6

62
Now! If you have made some models of onions in a new Blender scene, that 
is to say, if you have started Blender, deleted the Cube object, and modeled 
some onions. What you have done is modiﬁed the default Blender ﬁle. To save 
the modiﬁed ﬁle, go to the Info Window Header, click on File then click on Save 
and…….WHAT HAS HAPPENED? The Screen changes from the 3D Window to 
the File Browser Window. I will take a little diversion to explain.
Windows
In Blender the default Screen arrangement has ﬁve windows open. There are 
actually 16 different windows listed under Editor Types. In the 3D Window Header, 
click on the icon in the bottom LH corner and you will see the list.
 

63
Try this as an experiment. Click the icon at the bottom of the 3D Window and then 
click on Properties in the list. You will have opened the Properties Window. The 
original Properties Window remains open at the RHS of the screen. The new 
window looks different because it is spread across the area that was the 3D Window 
but you will see the same row of buttons in the top LH corner.
Next to the buttons you see the icon for the Properties Window. Click the icon and 
select the 3D View from the list. The 3D Window is reinstated.
I have already mentioned that you can 
drag the edge of a window but you can 
also split a window. Splitting divides 
the window into two identical windows. 
You can then change one part to a 
different type. To divide a window, click 
on the cross hatching in the top right or bottom left of a window (the mouse cursor 
turns into a white cross), hold, and drag the mouse.
To cancel a window click, 
hold, and drag the cross into 
the window to be cancelled. 
You will see a large arrow 
pointing into the window.
We haven’t ﬁnished with 
saving, so we had better get 
back to it.
 

64
Back to Saving
OK! You clicked on Save and the window changed to the File Browser Window.
The File Browser Window shows you all the Directories, Folders, and Files saved 
on the Hard Drive in your computer. Clicking Save opens the window at the last 
place where you saved something and Blender automatically names your new ﬁle 
untitled.blend. You see the name in the red strip at the top of the window. You can 
click in the red strip, delete this name, and type your own name. It’s preferable to 
name your ﬁle something that you will remember otherwise you are never going to 
ﬁnd it again. When you have typed your ﬁle name, press Enter. The red strip turns 
gray. To save your ﬁle, click Save Blender File in the top RH corner of the window. 
You will be taken back to the 3D Window.
Hold on a minute!
I said that the File Browser Window opened at the last place that you previously 
saved something. Is this where you want to save the new ﬁle? Maybe not!
This is where you have to know a bit about navigation. Go 
get the GPS from the car.
Sorry! GPS isn’t going to help. Neither will a compass, a 
sextant, nor a street map. We will have to take a look at 
the File Tree.
 

65
The File Tree
Shannon the Owl is very confused because his world has gone topsy turvy 
(upside-down). Actually only the File Tree is upside down (Roots at the top, 
Branches at the bottom).
Roots have nothing to do with the Root Drive on your computer. That’s something 
else, but the main trunk of the tree represents the C: Drive. The Hard Drive on 
your computer is a disc where all your folders and ﬁles and programs are stored. 
The Hard Drive is divided into partitions which are called Drives and the Drives 
are named C, D, E, F, etc. The C: Drive is where all your folders and programs 
are kept. Look at the C: Drive (the tree trunk). There is a branch on the trunk 
named My_Documents_Folder. (Note: I have made these names up so I can 
 

66
explain.) Inside the folder is a subfolder (a smaller branch) named My_Blender_
Stuff_Folder and inside this folder is a ﬁle (a twig on the small branch) named 
MyOnions.blend.
You will see this arrangement on a Windows Operating System in Windows 
Explorer or File Explorer. These are Windows programs that let you see the File 
Arrangement.
The File Tree: File Explore (Window 10)
The File Tree: Blender File Browser
In Blender you navigate the File Tree using the File Browser Window. The window 
opens in stages. When you click Save to save work, the File Browser Window 
opens, showing the place where you last saved something. This may not be where 
you want to save something new. To get back to the beginning of the C: Drive, click 
on the drive in the System tab. The folders in the C: Drive will be listed in the main 
window panel at the right.
 

67
In the folder list, in the main window panel, you will see the folder named A_My_
Documents_Folder. Click LMB on the name to open this folder. You will see the 
subfolder named My_Blender_Stuff_Folder.
Click on the folder name and inside the folder is the ﬁle MyOnions.blend.
 

68
You see the complete File Path in the panel at the top of the main File Browser 
Window panel.
To navigate back through the File Path, click on either of the reverse arrows.
There are plenty of other options in the File Browser Window but that should do 
for now.
Go back and remake the model of the super duper aircraft and save a Blender ﬁle.
 

69
Save or Save As
When you open Blender, you open the default Blender Scene with the Default 
Cube in the center. You can then model something using the cube or add one or 
more primitives to construct a model or create a scene. At any time in the process, 
you can and should save the ﬁle. When a model or scene includes a considerable 
amount of work, you don’t want to lose it should your computer crash or the power 
goes off. Save your work regularly.
To recap, you go to the Info Window header, click File then when you click Save 
the File, the Browser Window opens. Navigate to where you want to save. Enter 
a name for your ﬁle and click Save Blender File.
The next time you start Blender you get the default arrangement again.
To retrieve your work, you go to the Info Window header, click File, then click 
Open. The File Browser Window opens where you navigate to the ﬁle that you 
saved, click on it to select, then click Open Blender File in the upper right of the 
screen.
You can proceed to make changes to the ﬁle by adding more models, changing 
the scenery, etc.
At this point, you may want to save the new work in which case you simply use the 
Save option.
You may want to save the new work but retain what you had before you made the 
changes. This is where you select the Save As option. The File Browser Window 
again opens where you enter a new ﬁle name then click Save Blender File. This 
creates a new ﬁle with the new name and your original ﬁle remains unaltered.

Chapter 7 
Materials
In Blender, think of Materials as color and how a color is applied to the surface of 
an Object. The Object could be the aircraft that you have modeled.
We started by adding a UV Sphere 
Object into the Scene, squishing 
down on the Z Axis and extruding 
bits to form the shape of an aircraft.
The UV Sphere displayed on the 
screen as a dull gray color. This is 
the default Blender color, the same 
as that applied to the default Cube.
Default, according to the dictionary, 
means failure to act, perform, or 
participate, therefore in the case 
of Blenders Materials it means 
gray is what you get unless you do 
something about it.
The default dull gray color is 
what Blender uses so that it has 
something to show you.
7

72
The Default Color
When you start Blender, the 3D Window has a Cube object in the center of the 
Scene. The Cube displays as the default gray color. The default Cube has this 
Material color applied to its surface. This is the only time that a Material color is 
actually applied to an object when it is entered into a scene. When you enter other 
objects, they automatically display with the same gray Material color but the color is 
not automatically applied. Blender just uses the gray color so that it has something 
to show you.
The best way to understand the application of materials is to work through an 
exercise.
The Materials Buttons
Materials (colors) are selected and applied 
using the Properties Window Materials 
buttons. The Properties Window is at the 
RHS of the screen. When the default Cube 
Object is selected, you see the Materials 
buttons as shown here. The buttons display 
because the Material is already applied to 
the default Cube Object.
 

73
If you delete the Cube and add a new Object such as a UV Sphere, then the 
Materials buttons will display like this.
This display indicates that a Material has not been applied. The sphere shows as 
the default gray color because Blender uses this for something to show you in the 
3D Window. The gray Material color is not applied. To apply a Material, you click 
on the New button. When you do this the button controls open in the Properties 
Window and, would you believe it, you get the dull gray default color.
Selecting a Material Color
The ﬁrst thing you do when selecting a Material color is have your object/model 
selected in the 3D Window.
The Material color is going to be applied to the surface of the selected object. 
Remember the default Cube object already has the gray Material color applied so 
go get something else. A UV Sphere is good or you can use your airplane model, 
if you remember where the Blender ﬁle is saved.
If you use a UV Sphere object, click on Smooth 
in the Tools Panel at the LHS of the 3D Window. 
This makes the surface of the sphere appear 
smooth and gives a better display when applying 
Materials.
 

74
With the UV Sphere selected head over to the Properties Window and click on the 
Materials button. Click on the New button.
The Materials buttons for the UV Sphere will open showing the settings for the 
default gray color.
 

75
 

76
What we have done so far is apply a Material (color) to the UV Sphere. By 
default, Blender applied the default gray Diffuse color. We changed this to a nice 
brown color.
You will notice that underneath the Diffuse 
tab is the Specular tab.
The Specular Material color is the color of reﬂected highlights on a surface. By 
default, this color is white. You see this as a white spot on the surface of the 
sphere. You can see it in the 3D Window and in the Preview tab. The Specular 
color can be changed the same way as the Diffuse Material color.
 

77
More Materials
Besides Material colors, there is a lot more you can do to create stunning images. 
I will tell you about a few of the features to get you interested.
As a starting point, use the UV Sphere with its nice brown Diffuse color and 
whatever Specular color you have chosen.
In the 3D Window, deselect the UV Sphere (press the A Key). Add a new 
Plane object, scale it up and position it just below the UV Sphere as shown in the 
diagram.
At this point the Scene in the 3D Window has a UV Sphere object and a Plane 
object. There is also a Lamp providing light and a Camera. Another element in the 
composition is the background to the image.
 

78
The Lamp in the Scene is the default Spot Lamp in its default position with its 
default settings. Any of these defaults can be changed should you wish but for the 
exercise, leave them as they are. To produce a ﬁnal image, we will alter Material 
values for the UV Sphere, the Plane, and the background. The Camera remains in 
its default position.
The UV Sphere: For the UV Sphere, use the settings previously set producing 
the nice brown Diffuse color for the surface and whatever Specular color you have 
chosen.
 

79
The Plane: Select the Plane and set the Properties Window, Materials buttons as 
per the diagram on Page 78 opposite.
The Background: Background Materials are set in the Properties Window, World 
buttons.
The Final Image
 

80
As you can see, there are many settings which you can play with to produce a 
variety of effects. Don’t be afraid to experiment and try for yourself.
Lighting
In the real world the color of an object that you see is the result of light reﬂecting 
off its surface. What light is reﬂected depends on what part of the light spectrum 
is absorbed by the surface material and what the light consists of in the ﬁrst place. 
Blender replicates this phenomenon on the computer screen, therefore lighting 
is an important part of composition. There are several Lamp types from which 
to choose, each of which has its own color and intensity settings. You can have 
multiple Lamps in a scene therefore the light combinations are limitless.
 

81
This has been the tip of the iceberg when considering Materials and you can 
see it is a fascinating and important part of the creation process. Up to this point 
I have been using the Blender Render system with Materials. The alternative 
is the Cycles Render system which has different controls and makes use of 
Blender’s Node system. This opens a new can of worms which will have to wait 
for the time being.
 

 

83
Chapter 8 
Textures
The image shown above is a small JPEG 
image saved on the computer. To demonstrate 
the application of a Texture I will place this 
onto the surface of an Object. This is what is 
called applying an Image Texture. Blender 
has several in-built Textures called Procedural 
Textures, but we will use the Image Texture.
Start a new Blender Scene and add a UV 
Sphere object. You can delete the default Cube.
8

84
With the UV Sphere selected in the 3D Window, click on Smooth in the Tool Panel, 
Tools tab at the LHS of the window.
Press the Tab Key to place the UV Sphere in Edit Mode. Note: The Tool 
Panel changes. The UV Sphere is shown with its Vertices displayed. For this 
demonstration the default number of vertices is adequate. In the Shading UVs tab, 
click on Unwrap.
 

85
Clicking Unwrap opens a selection menu. Select Sphere Projection.
Smoothing you have seen before. This just makes the 
surface of the object (the UV Sphere) appear smooth 
which is good for seeing colors when they are applied.
Oh! By the way. Before I forget. Go ahead and apply a 
material to the UV Sphere. Just click the Materials button 
in the Properties Window and then click on New. Just as 
we did in the last chapter. The default gray will do ﬁne.
Unwrapping: is peeling off the surface 
of an object and laying it out ﬂat so 
the Texture can be placed on the ﬂat 
surface. We have unwrapped the UV 
Sphere’s surface and you can see 
this if you open the UV Image Editor 
Window.
 

86
Applying Texture
Make sure you have applied a Material. Textures are applied in the Properties 
Window—wait for it—Texture buttons.
When you click the New button, the 
Texture buttons expand showing the 
controls for the Object that is selected in 
the 3D Window. By default the Texture 
Type, Image, or Movie is active. In the 
Preview tab, you see a black preview 
because you haven’t selected a Texture 
Image at this point. To select an image 
to be used as a Texture, click on Open in 
the Image tab.
Clicking Open opens the File Browser 
Window. This is the same window you 
used when saving your work.
 

87
Selecting an Image as a Texture
In the File Browser Window, you navigate through your computer’s ﬁle system to 
a folder containing the image you wish to use as a Texture. This could be a single 
image you have taken with a camera and saved, or a selection of Texture images 
you have downloaded. On my computer I have a folder named BLENDER_IMAGE_
TEXTURES which contains a whole selection of images. In the diagram, you can 
see the ﬁle names for each image. This is OK if you know what image you want to 
use, but if you are selecting an image at random it isn’t very helpful.
Blender will help you. In the window header, click on the Thumbnail display option 
and you will see your image or images as Thumbnails (little pictures). Click on a 
picture and press (click) the Open Image button at the top RH of the screen.
 

88
When you click Open Image, the screen reverts to the 3D Window and Properties 
Window.
In the Properties Window, Preview tab, you see the image you have selected as 
multiple copies spread across the panel.
At this point, the 3D Window is in Solid Viewport Shading mode and probably in 
User Perspective view. Change to Camera view by pressing Num Pad 0.
You will see the gray UV Sphere in the window, inside a rectangle. Outside the 
rectangle the window is a dark shade of gray. The gray surround is called the 
Passepartout. This can be turned off but we won’t worry about that right now.
 

89
Even though you have applied a Texture to the 3D Window, it shows the sphere as 
the gray default color. This is to save computer power while you are constructing 
your scene. With only a UV Sphere, a Camera, and a Lamp in the scene it doesn’t 
have much effect, but if you have a complicated scene with many objects and 
scenery, all with different Textures applied, then to show the Textures the computer 
would be in overdrive. Moving things in the scene will become very slow and jerky 
and, depending on your PC, it could freeze or crash.
Anyway! We want to see the Texture on the UV Sphere.
In the 3D Window header, click on the Viewport Shading option button and select 
Rendered from the menu.
 

90
Remember, this procedure can be used on any Object in the 3D Window. When I 
say Object I am referring to a Mesh Object. A Mesh Object is one where you see 
that it has Vertices when you Tab into Edit Mode. There are other types of Objects 
in Blender which are not Mesh Objects.
Surface Displacement
One more trick just to ﬁnish off.
A texture can be used to displace the vertices of a Mesh Object to give the surface 
lumps and bumps. In the Properties Window, Texture buttons, Inﬂuence tab, simply 
check (tick) Displace in the Geometry section and adjust the value.
Adjust the value by clicking in the Displace bar, holding and dragging the mouse 
left or right or clicking, pressing delete, and retyping a new value. Note: Values 
in sliders are not always inﬁnitely variable. In the Displace Slider, the value is 
adjustable between +1.000 and −1.000.
 

91
Texture Images as Scene Background
When I was showing you how to model something (the aircraft) an image was 
created with a colored background, and I showed you that an image could be used 
to create a background to the scene (clouds in the sky).
Go on the Internet and ﬁnd yourself a nice picture of clouds in the sky like the one 
above.
I will use the picture as an Image Texture. In other words the picture will be used 
as a background for the image of the aircraft. Save the picture, and remember 
where you saved it.
Go back and ﬁnd the Blender ﬁle you saved when you modeled your aircraft, and 
open the ﬁle.
Put the 3D Window into Camera view and have your aircraft model in the viewport. 
Make sure the model is NOT selected (press the A Key if it is).
Go to the Properties Window, Texture buttons. Click on the World Texture button 
(see diagram). Click on the New button to display the Texture tabs. The default 
Texture Type is Image or Movie.
If you click on Image or Movie, you will see a selection menu for a number of 
Texture options but you will be using the default setting.
 

92
In the Image tab, click on Open. The File Browser Window opens. Find the cloud 
picture you saved, select it, and click open image. In the Inﬂuence tab, check (tick) 
Horizon.
When you render an image (press F12), you will see the clouds in the background 
of the image. With the 3D Window in Rendered Viewport Shading mode, you will 
see that the clouds are spread across the entire window and the Camera is only 
capturing a part of the Texture background.
If you want the Texture image to totally ﬁt the background of the rendered image, 
you have to know the resolution of the texture image (the physical size in number of 
pixels wide and number of pixels high). You can then go to the Properties Window, 
Render  buttons and change the values in the Dimensions tab, Resolution panel to 
match the  resolution of the image.
Perhaps that’s another story for later on.

Chapter 9 
Downloading and Using 
Models
Say hello to Zoe. Zoe is a cartoon character but she is also a Model. She is not 
one of your high-end fashion models who parade up and down a catwalk but she 
is a Blender model rigged for animation.
BLEND SWAP is one of numerous websites you can access and download models 
to use. Some websites ask you to pay for model downloads but BLEND SWAP 
doesn’t. You do, however, have to register as a user and agree to their terms of 
use. Many models entail a lot of work so it is good to show appreciation.
9

96
The web address will take you directly to the download page for Zoe. Zoe is just 
one of many Blender ﬁles you can download from the site. To see other models, 
click on BLENDS in the header at the top of the page, then start scrolling through 
the pages.
To download Zoe click on the DOWNLOAD button. Remember you must be logged 
in to download which means you must be registered as a user.
When you download Zoe, you download a ﬁle name: 76271_Zoe.zip.
The .zip bit at the end tells you it is a compressed ﬁle which means it has been 
scrunched into a smaller ﬁle size to make it quicker to download. Guess What! You 
have to unscrunch the ﬁle to use it. To unscrunch (unzip) the ﬁle, you can use the 
program WinZip or WinRar or the free program 7-Zip.
I will assume you can unscrunch the ﬁle or if not, get someone to do it for you. 
When it is unscrunched, you will have a Blender ﬁle named: Zoe.blend.
In Blender, open the ﬁle Zoe.blend to see Zoe in the 3D Window.
 

97
How to Use Zoe
If you take a close look at Zoe and rotate her in the 3D Window (click, hold, and 
drag MMB), you will see that she is surrounded by some strange looking shapes. 
Some are black and some are red. The white circle with the red arc located at her 
left (your right) ankle is the 3D Window Manipulation Widget. You can turn this off 
in the 3D Window header.
Zoom out in the window and you will also see that there is a Camera in the Scene 
pointing at Zoe and a Plane Object above her.
The Plane above is a Light Source.
 

98
Take another look at the black and red shapes. These are control handles for 
posing the model. Posing means positioning the parts of the model to look the way 
you want it to look. With Zoe you move parts of her body to make her look cuter 
than she already is.
Remember that in Blender a model is a mesh object and Zoe is no exception.
The control handles are linked (associated with) parts of the mesh, such that when 
a handle is moved the associated mesh moves. Moving body parts and inserting 
keyframes at different positions in the Timeline Window is how you animate a 
ﬁgure to move. Posing and animating is a whole book load of information in itself, 
but to give you the idea perform the following.
Concentrate on Zoe’s head. You will have to zoom in and rotate Zoe to see the 
close up images as shown in the diagrams. Change the 3D Window to Pose Mode 
then click, hold, and drag the control handles to see the body part move.
 

99
There are lots of handles to experiment and play with. Don’t be afraid.
Have a go. See if you can place Zoe in an action pose like this one.
To use the Zoe Object, you can place other Objects in the Scene, add and arrange 
Lamps, add a Landscape, etc. and modify Zoe herself. If you Save the ﬁle you save 
 

100
all the additions and modiﬁcations, so in effect you lose the original ﬁle. Alternatively 
you can select the Save As option.
Using the Save As command saves a copy of the ﬁle and retains the original ﬁle 
for use at a later date.
 

101
Appending
A model in a Blender ﬁle can be Appended into a different ﬁle. This means you 
pluck the model from one ﬁle and place it into another ﬁle.
We can use your aircraft model as an example.
Make sure you understand how to navigate the ﬁle system (see Chapter 6).
Make sure you know where you have saved your aircraft ﬁle.
LET’S DO IT! Open a new Blender ﬁle and delete the Cube.
Have the 3D Window Cursor in the center of the Scene. When you Append a 
model, it will be placed in the Scene at the location of the 3D Window Cursor.
Your aircraft model is very simple. This is a good place to start for Appending.
When you made the model it was constructed from a Sphere Object and I purposely 
didn’t provide any instruction on renaming it to anything else. Consequently, your 
aircraft model is named Sphere in your aircraft Blender ﬁle. This is OK as long as 
you remember the name.
 

102
Have a new blender ﬁle opened and deleted the default Cube. Your 3D Window 
Cursor is located at the center of the Scene.
As you can see above, my Aircraft.blend ﬁle is saved in:
C:\Blender_Test_Drive\210_Project\
Click on the aircraft ﬁle to show the folders contained within 
the ﬁle.
Click on the Object folder and select Sphere.
Click on Append from Library in the upper 
right hand corner of the window.
Bingo! Your aircraft model is in the Scene.
 

103
Appending a simple model or object into a ﬁle is fairly straightforward. Complex 
models like Zoe are not quite so easy to append.
At the beginning of Chapter I said Zoe was a model rigged for animation. By that I 
meant, the model came intact with control handles for posing, linked to the mesh. 
When a control handle is moved, the mesh moves.
The more traditional method of rigging a character model for posing and animating 
is to employ, what is termed, an Armature. An Armature is like a bone skeleton. In 
fact the parts of an Armature are called Bones.
To show you what I mean I have downloaded another model named “Mr. Comic.”
The web address for the model download is:
www.blendswap.com/blends/view/23500
Say hello to Mr. Comic.
 

104
When you have downloaded the zip ﬁle and unzipped, you have the Blender 
ﬁle named comic.blend. When the ﬁle is opened the 3D Window is in Camera 
Perspective view and you see Mr. Comic with some weird black stick lines connected 
by dots showing inside his body. This is the Armature.
Armatures can be displayed in different ways but for the demonstration I will use 
the stick conﬁguration.
The Armature sticks, or to be precise the bones, are linked to parts of the mesh just 
like the control handles in the Zoe model. You select a bone and move it to make 
the mesh move.
The ﬁgure on the left shows an arm bone selected (click RMB to select).
When the Blender ﬁle is ﬁrst opened, the 3D Window is in Object Mode. When you 
select a bone, this changes to Pose Mode.
Mr. Comic is still a relatively simple model but it is more complicated than your 
aircraft model. When you appended the aircraft, you found the Sphere Object in 
 

105
the File Browser Window. If you go looking for Mr. Comic, you will not ﬁnd his name 
listed or anything else that is meaningful.
To get Mr. Comic into another Blender ﬁle, you use a cut-and-paste method.
With the comic.blend ﬁle opened and the 3D Window in Camera Perspective View, 
you select the model by pressing the B Key (Box select) and dragging a rectangle 
around Mr. Comic. BUT! Before you do, RMB click on the ﬂoor plane and delete it 
from the Scene.
Make sure you are inside the Camera 
View otherwise you will also select the 
Camera.
With Mr. Comic selected, press Ctrl + C 
(copy). In the Info Window header, you will 
see “Copied selected to buffer” display. 
Wait until this disappears.
In the Info Window header, click in File—
New—Reload Start Up File.
In the new Blender Window that opens, 
delete the default Cube object, then press 
Ctrl + V (paste).
There you have it Mr. Comic in a new 
Scene ready to go.

Chapter 10 
Spin Magic
Blender has two quick tools for creating circular Objects called Spin and Screw. 
Spin extrudes and duplicates vertices around a center point, while Screw does 
the same thing and offsets the duplication at the same time. The center point in, 
both cases, is the 3D Window Cursor. To make sense of these processes, follow 
the procedures precisely. Both the position of the 3D Window Cursor and how the 
Viewport is arranged are important.
10

108
The Spin Tool
To show how Spin works, start by simply making a doughnut from a circle. The 
Circle Object will be the cross section proﬁle for the doughnut. The cross section 
proﬁle for spinning can be any shape you like, formed by a string of vertices. A 
circular shape is a closed loop of vertices but this doesn’t have to be the case. Any 
string will work. In fact you can spin any shape, even an Object.
Use a Circle Object so you see what is shown in the diagrams. You can 
experiment later.
Start a new Blender Scene, delete the default Cube and add a Circle Object.
When you add a Circle Object it always presents, lying ﬂat, in Top Orthographic 
View. Make it stand on edge so you see it in Front Orthographic View. With the 
circle selected, press the R Key + X Key + 90, which tells Blender to Rotate about 
the X axis, 90°.
With the circle selected, in Object Mode, move it four grid units to the left and then 
Tab into Edit Mode.
 

109
The distance moved doesn’t have to be exact but make sure the 3D Window 
Cursor remains at the center of the Scene. If you have clicked somewhere in 
the 3D Window, it will be wherever you clicked. To get it back to the center, press 
Shift + S key and select Cursor to Center from the menu that displays.
Change the 3D Window to Top Orthographic View.
To spin the proﬁle, simply press Spin in the Tool Panel, Tools tab at the LHS of 
the 3D Window.
When Spin is pressed, the proﬁle is extruded around a circular 
arc of 90°.
The Spin tool panel displays in the Tool Panel at the lower 
LHS of the Screen.
By default, the rotation is 90° and there are nine steps in 
the extrusion. Change the steps to 80 and the angle to 360° 
to form a complete circle. More Steps creates a smoother 
Object.
 

110
With any extrusion, you ﬁnish up with the original set of vertices plus the extruded 
vertices, so in the closed circle with 80 Steps you have 81 sets of vertices, with the 
last set superimposed over the original. You have doubled up.
In the Tool Panel, click on Remove Doubles.
More Spin
A doughnut is a good starting point for the Spin Tool, but you could just as well 
have added a Torus Object to your Scene. Let’s make something a little more 
exciting. Make a simple bowl.
The ﬁrst thing to do is make a cross section proﬁle of the bowl.
Start a new Blender Scene, delete the Cube Object and add a Plane Object. The 
Plane will be presented laid ﬂat on the mid-plane of the Scene. Flip it up on edge, 
press R Key + X Key + 90.
 

111
Change the 3D Window to Front Orthographic View and tab into Edit Mode.
In Edit Mode, move the vertices one Blender Grid Unit to the left. To accurately 
position the vertices, press the N Key to open the Object Properties Panel on the 
RHS of the window (press the N Key again to close the panel). In the panel, in the 
Transform tab, make the X Median value: −1.00000, that is, minus one.
The Median is the middle of the selected group of vertices. The Manipulation 
Widget locates at the Median Point when in Edit Mode. With a square Plane 
Object, the Median Point is slap bang in the center.
 

112
Press the A Key to deselect the Vertices, then RMB click on a single Vertex. Press 
the X Key and select Delete Vertices in the menu that displays. You now have an 
open string consisting of three vertices. This is the starting point for creating your 
bowl cross section proﬁle.
Make particular note that the lower RH vertex is located on the center of the 
vertical  Z  axis of the Scene. This coincides with the center of the 3D Window 
cursor.
Arrange and add vertices, as shown in the diagrams, to form a proﬁle.
 

113
With the proﬁle completed and all vertices selected, in Edit Mode, press Num Pad 
7 to place the 3D Window in Top Orthographic View. In the Tool Panel, Tools 
tab, click on Spin. Make sure the 3D Window Cursor is at the center of the Scene.
In the Spin Tool Panel, increase the steps and make the angle 360°. Remove 
Doubles.
 

114
The Screw Tool
Creating a screw or spiral in Blender is similar to spinning in that the spiral takes place 
about the center of the 3D Window Cursor. The spiral is also affected by whatever 
3D Window Viewport you have at the time. To see how to spiral, be in the Front 
Orthographic View.
Start a new Blender Scene and delete the default Cube Object. Put the viewport in 
Front Orthographic View (press Num Pad 1).
Add a Circle Object. The circle will be presented at the location of the 3D Window 
Cursor, which, hopefully, is at the center of the Scene. If it isn’t, press Shift + S Key 
and select Cursor to Center from the menu. If you do this after you have added the 
circle, press Shift + S Key and select Object to Cursor. This is an accurate way of 
locating anything at the center of the Scene.
The Circle Object is always presented ﬂat in Top Orthographic View, so ﬂip it on 
edge (R + X + 90) so you see it in the Front Orthographic View.
With the Circle Object selected (Object Mode), move the circle ﬁve grid units to the left.
 

115
Moving the circle doesn’t have to be accurate, but if it had to be, you can use the 
Object Properties Panel. This panel is hidden from view by default. To display it 
press the N Key. Pressing the N Key a second time will hide the panel (saves room 
in the 3D Window).
With the Object Properties Panel open in the Transform tab, change the Location 
X value to −5.00000 (minus 5).
With the circle relocated, Tab into Edit Mode, and with the circle still selected 
(vertices showing orange) add a Plane Object to the Scene. The Plane is entered 
at the location of the 3D Window Cursor at the center of the Scene. It is also 
entered lying ﬂat when in Top Orthographic View so ﬂip it on its edge so we can 
see it in Front view (R + X + 90). Both the Circle and the Plane are selected. Press 
the A Key to deselect then press the B Key and drag a rectangle around the Plane 
to select the Plane. Move the Plane one grid unit to the right.
You want the left-hand edge of the Plane to be exactly on the vertical Z axis of the 
3D Window. Go to the Object Properties Panel again (N Key to display) and in the 
Transform tab change the Median X value to 1.000.
What you are about to do is make a single vertical line consisting of two vertices. 
The length of this line determines the Pitch of the Screw (vertical length/height 
of the spiral).
Press the A Key to deselect the Plane then the B Key and drag a rectangle around 
the RH edge. With the RH edge selected, press the X Key to delete. You are left 
with the single line on the vertical Z axis.
 

116
While it is still selected press the S Key, drag the Mouse and scale the line up so 
that it is approximately four grid units long.
Press the A Key to deselect then press A Key again to select the Circle and the 
Line.
With both the Circle and the Line selected, click on the Screw button in the Tool 
Panel, Tools tab at the LHS of the 3D Window.
 

117
The screw is generated, and the Screw Panel displays at the lower LHS of the 3D 
Window.
Adjust the Steps value to add more vertices and smooth the screw and increase 
the Turns value to increase the number of turns (spirals).

Chapter 11 
Quick Fluid
I know you like the quick stuff, so I will show you how to make a Fluid Simulation. 
The ﬂuid can be water, milk, oil, honey, in fact anything that ﬂows.
This will be a very quick demonstration of the Quick Fluid method. It is only intended 
to show you one of Blender’s features and encourage you to pursue further studies.
Open a new Blender Scene with the default Cube Object. With the Cube selected, 
press the Space Bar and type Quick Fluid in the search window that displays. 
Select Quick Fluid from the options. What you see in the 3D Window immediately 
changes.
11

120
What actually happens is, the Cube Object has become a Fluid Object and has 
been surrounded by a cuboid. The cuboid is called a Domain and it represents a 
cubic volume of space in which the ﬂuid simulation will take place. Change the 3D 
Window from Solid Display mode to Wireframe Display mode.
 

121
Look in the bottom LHS of the 3D Window to see the Quick Fluid tab. Place a 
tick (click) in Start Fluid bake and wait. This is like baking a cake. You just have 
to be patient and wait until the cake is cooked. Look at the top of the 3D Window 
and you will see a progress bar with a percentage value showing. When the cake 
is baked, the progress bar disappears.
Change back to Solid Viewport Shading. In the Timeline Window, click Play to see 
the ﬂuid descend inside the domain, splash, and come to rest.
 

122
Many interesting effects can be created with Fluid Simulation.
Objects and the Domain can be altered which affects how the Fluid ﬂows. The 
Fluid Object could be hidden inside a model of a tap or pipe, simulating the ﬂuid 
exiting. There are viscosity settings for ﬂuid which determine what type of ﬂuid is 
being simulated. The color of the ﬂuid can be varied. Other objects can be placed 
inside the domain to act as obstacles which the ﬂuid has to ﬂow around or to act 
as containers to catch the ﬂuid.
There are many settings for fantastic effects for you to discover.
 

123
Chapter 12 
Animation
This is one of the best parts of Blender. This is where you get to make things move 
about.
You have already seen things move when you use quick methods to make ﬁre and 
smoke and explode, but I know you want to make your own models ﬂy.
Let’s begin with your super duper aircraft that you saved.
You did save it, didn’t you!?
Never mind I will start off with something else anyway.
This is another case of learning to walk before you can 
ﬂy.
Making things move about in computer graphics is 
called Animation.
Animation began when someone drew a whole bunch of pictures of something, with 
each picture being just a little bit different. They then ﬂipped through the pictures 
very quickly and saw the illusion of their moving.
Picture cards turned into little bits called Frames on a long strip of celluloid 
(a movie reel) which had light shining through that projected the image onto a 
screen.
12

124
Today the images are stored as digital data in a computer and displayed on your 
monitor.
The little squares are called Pixels.
Your First Animation
Animation is the art of making you think you see something move. I will show you how 
this is done in Blender by making the default Cube Object in the default scene move.
Open a new Blender scene. Move the Cube, using the Widget, to the back of the 
Grid.
 

125
Look in the Timeline Window and note that the cursor (green line) is at Frame 1.
Place your Mouse Cursor in the 3D Window and press the I Key. In the menu that 
displays select (click) Location.
Move the Cube to the front of the Grid.
In the Timeline Window, move the cursor (green line) to Frame 60. You can move 
the cursor to any frame you like but 60 will give you a good demo.
With the Cube at the front of the Grid and the Timeline Cursor at Frame 60, put the 
Mouse cursor in the 3D Window and press the I Key again. Select Location from 
the menu.
In the Timeline Window, press the Go To Start button. Press the Play button to see 
the Cube move from the back of the Grid to the front.
No! THAT IS NOT IT!
This is the very very beginning. The animation has 
shown a simple translation (movement) of an Object.
I know you are itching to do something fantastical BUT!
Have you found where you saved your model of the aircraft?
 

126
While you are looking for it I will explain a little bit about the animation.
What you did was locate the Cube at the back of the Grid in the 3D Window. In 
the Timeline Window, you placed the cursor at Frame 1. You then pressed the I 
Key and clicked in Location. Pressing the I Key and selecting Location inserted a 
Keyframe at Frame 1. You then relocated the Cube to the front of the Grid and 
placed another Keyframe at Frame 60.
Placing Keyframes tells Blender how to display the Cube at Frame 1 and Frame 
60. Blender automatically works out how to display the Cube at all the in-between 
frames.
When you play the animation, all the Frames ﬂash on the screen so you think the 
Cube is moving.
Oh! You have found your aircraft ﬁle at last. I can move on.
You could use the Cube and make it ﬂy around but using the ﬂying machine 
adds realism to the animation. Some simple things can look fantastic. Animating 
something to move in a straight line is relatively simple. As well as animating the 
location of an object, you may also animate the scale (size) and rotation and many 
other things. When you press the I Key to insert Keyframes, you see the different 
options in the selection menu:
Yes, to make an object move, spin around, and change size during an animation, 
you would have to insert lots and lots of Keyframes.
This is another DON’T PANIC situation, just strap yourself in and ﬂy with the 
instructions. At ﬁrst this will probably appear to be a long and tedious process 
because you have to ﬁnd the buttons to press and where to enter values. At the 
 

127
same time you have to understand what is going on. It will become simpler when 
you have practiced a bit and are familiar with the interface.
Let’s get going.
Start-up Blender and open your aircraft ﬁle with your model in it. In Top Orthographic 
view (Num Pad 7), you should have a view as shown in the diagram.
Make a note that the Camera is pointing toward your aircraft and in Camera View 
(Num Pad 0) you should see something like this.
 

128
Place the 3D Window in Top Orthographic view (Num Pad 7).
With the Mouse Cursor in the 3D Window, press Shift + A Key and in the menu 
that displays, click Curve then Circle. This adds a Bezier Circle to the scene. In 
Blender, all the Curve options are Paths, which can be used for animating objects. 
They also have other uses, but I will not go into that at this time.
You are about to make your aircraft follow a Path. This means you will create an 
imaginary track in space which the aircraft ﬂies along. You will use the Bezier Circle 
as the Path.
When you enter the Bezier Circle into the scene, it is one Blender unit in diameter. 
When you modeled the aircraft, you didn’t consider what size it was since it was 
the only object in the scene. You began with a UV Sphere which by default was 
one Blender unit in diameter. You elongated the sphere on the Y axis and scaled it 
down on the Z axis. It remains at one Blender unit wide on the X axis. Therefore in 
width it is the same as the Bezier Circle.
You can see the relationship in Top Orthographic view with the 3D Window in 
Wireframe Viewport Shading Mode. Viewport Shading is the way in which the 3D 
Window displays the scene.
 

129
When it is important to know the size of one object relative to another or how 
far away something is, Blender has an Object Properties panel which shows you 
the relative dimensions. With the Mouse Cursor in the 3D Window, press the N 
Key and the panel will open on the RHS of the window. The important thing to 
remember is that all the values shown in the panel apply to the object that you have 
selected at the time. With the Bezier Circle selected, you will see the Scale: X, Y, 
and Z values 1.000. If you select the model of the  aircraft (click RMB), you will see 
Scale: X 1.000, Y 2.000, and Z 0.357. The Z axis value will depend on how much 
you squished the UV Sphere.
To use the Bezier Circle as a Path for the aircraft to follow, you want it to be way 
bigger than 1.000. Maybe 40 times as big. Select the Bezier Circle. The Object 
Properties Panel will show the Scale values for the circle. They will be 1.000 for 
X, Y, and Z. The Z value doesn’t mean anything since a circle in our case is just a 
circle. It is 1.000 wide (X) by 1.000 high (Y) but it has no thickness (Z).
 

130
To make the circle bigger, press the S Key and drag the mouse or press the S Key 
then 40. If you drag the mouse, watch the X, Y, and Z values increase as you drag. 
When they approach 40, click to release the mouse button. In either case, the 
circle is going to be  displayed off the screen. Zoom out in the 3D Window until you 
see the Bezier Circle. Your aircraft will be very tiny.
A Bezier curve is a parametric curve frequently used in computer graphics and 
related ﬁelds. Generalizations of Bezier curves to higher dimensions are called 
Bezier surfaces, of which the Bezier triangle is a special case. The circle we are 
using is also a curve, therefore we have Bezier Circle.
 

131
The Bezier Circle
In Edit mode, the circle displays with chevrons spaced around the circle. Remember 
the circle is a Path. The chevrons point in the direction in which an object will travel 
when it is animated to follow the path. At four points around the circumference 
of the circle, you will see yellow (orange) lines with a point in the center of the 
line and points at each end. These lines are manipulation Handles (similar to the 
Manipulation Widget). You click LMB on a Handle to select it. When it is selected, 
the Manipulation Widget locates at the center point of the handle.
A circle is OK for a Path but a different shape is more interesting.
 

132
Change the Curve Shape
Select the curve (Circle) in Object Mode and tab into Edit Mode.
 

133
The Path in Object Mode
To make the aircraft follow the Path, you have to apply a Constraint. The aircraft is 
constrained to the Path.
The Constraint is applied in the Properties Window, Constraint buttons panel.
 

134
When you set the constraint, your aircraft will relocate from the center of the scene 
to the start point on the Curve Path. Note, however, it is pointing along the Y axis 
at right angles to the direction of the Path. To correct this, check (place a tick by 
clicking) Follow Curve in the Constraint Panel.
You are producing an animation and you have to set the Keyframes. This is a Path 
Animation so you have to tell Blender where the aircraft is at the start and end of 
the Path.
You previously pressed the I Key to enter Keyframes with the selected object at 
different locations and at different frames in the animation. In Path Animation, you 
do this in a different way.
There are many things in Blender which may be animated and this is an example 
of the method used.
Deselect the aircraft (A Key) and select (click RMB) the Curve Path (Bezier Circle).
 

135
With the curve selected, Tab (press Tab) into Edit Mode to see the aircraft pointing 
in the direction of movement along the Path.
Tab back to Object mode. Remember the Path is 
selected.
Go to the Properties Window, Object data buttons. 
Pressing this button opens panels and tabs with 
information about the selected object in the 3D 
Window. Look down the panel and ﬁnd the Path 
Animation tab.
Disregard the Frames: value for the time being.
Note the Evaluation Time value: 0.000. This is 
telling you that you are at the start of the Path at the 
start of the animation. The value is a percentage. At 
the start, this is 0%.
To enter a Keyframe at the start position (0.000%), click RMB on the Evaluation 
Time bar and select Insert Keyframe in the menu that displays.
The Evaluation Time bar will turn yellow indicating that a Keyframe has been set.
In the Timeline Window, press the Go To Last Frame button.
 

136
In the Path Animation tab, change the Evaluation Time to: 100.000 (100%). Click 
RMB and enter a second Keyframe.
Remember when you placed the Bezier Circle in Edit mode and moved the Control 
Handle. You can go back and reshape the Curve Path at any time and this means 
you can reshape it on the X, Y, and Z axes. Reshaping on the Z axis means your 
aircraft ﬂies up or down in the scene.
Camera View: You previously saw a picture of the aircraft in Camera View (Num 
Pad 0). If you switch to Camera View, now you won’t see anything because the 
Camera is pointing at the spot where the aircraft was located in the beginning. It 
has been relocated to the start of the Path.
Seeing the aircraft ﬂy around the Path in the 3D Window is OK for setting up the 
action but at some stage you will want to make a movie of the animation, and for 
that you will want your actor to be in the shot. In this case, the aircraft is the actor.
 

137
Track to Constraint
You follow the same procedure that was used to set the Follow Path Constraint 
except this time you select Track To in the Constraint options.
You select Sphere since the aircraft was modeled 
from a UV Sphere and you haven’t told Blender 
anything else.
In the 3D Window, you will see a dotted line 
connecting the Camera to the aircraft (Sphere). 
This shows that the Constraint is set.
 

138
The Track To Constraint has been applied, but you have to reset the Camera’s 
orientation.
In the Camera Constraint panel look at the To: and 
Up: values. Click on −Z (minus Z) for the To: value 
and change Z in the Up: value to Y (click on the Up: 
value panel and select Y in the menu).
With the values set, the pink line is the same as the dotted line. You will see your 
aircraft in Camera View, but it is way way in the distance.
Grab the Camera and move it closer to the aircraft. It 
will remain pointed at the aircraft no matter where you 
position it. Playing the animation in Camera View will 
show the aircraft ﬂy away and return. If the aircraft 
disappears from view at some point, it is because it 
moves out of range of the Camera.
 

139
Chapter 13 
Dynamic Paint
Dynamic Paint is one of several Physics applications in Blender. As the name 
indicates, this tool may be used for painting which in Blender is the application of 
Material (Color) to the surface of a Mesh Object. The tool does a little more than 
that however. It is also used for deforming the surface of a mesh.
To show you how the tool operates I will start with the paint.
Just like an artist painting a picture you will have a Brush to apply the paint and 
a Canvas on which to apply it. The Brush and Canvas can be any of the Blender 
Primitives, but to make the demonstration something like painting a picture on 
a Canvas, you will use a UV Sphere as the Brush and a Plane Object as the 
Canvas.
13

140
To demonstrate Dynamic Paint, set up a Scene as shown in the diagram. There is a 
simple UV Sphere located at the center of the Scene in the center of the midplane. 
The sphere has a red Material applied. This is the Brush. The Plane is also located 
centrally and has been scaled up six times and in Edit Mode it has been subdivided 
six times. Subdividing adds vertices. Without sufficient vertices, you will not be 
able to paint. The Plane has also been given a pastel-colored Material.
Applying a Material (Color) to the Canvas or the Brush isn’t necessary, it merely 
makes the demonstration more colorful.
To paint you have to set up Physics for the Brush and the Canvas. You will be using 
the UV Sphere Brush to paint on the Plane Object Canvas.
Physics is set up in the Properties Window, Physics buttons.
You will start with the Plane Canvas. Select the Plane in the 3D Window and in the 
Physics buttons click on Dynamic Paint.
 

141
The Dynamic Paint tab opens. Click on the Canvas button to apply Canvas 
properties to the Plane then click Add Canvas. The Dynamic Paint tab expands. 
Check (tick) Anti-aliasing and in the Frames: buttons change the Sub-Steps value 
to 1. Applying these values improves the output quality when painting.
Now for the Brush. Select the UV Sphere in the 3D Window and again, in the 
Properties Window, Physics buttons click Dynamic Paint.
This time click on the Brush button then Add Brush. The Dynamic Paint Brush tab 
expands.
 

142
Here you go again, another deﬁnition which doesn’t appear to have any relevance 
to what is happening. Well it doesn’t until you understand the painting procedure. 
You are actually setting up to paint on the Canvas but if you were to grab hold of 
the Brush and thrash it about, nothing would happen.
There are two things you should know. The ﬁrst is that the paint effect is created at 
the intersection between the Brush and the Canvas. In this particular case that will 
be at the center of the sphere since it is sitting with its center coinciding with the 
center of the plane in elevation. You select the Brush in the 3D Window, press the 
G Key (Grab), and move the mouse to paint.
The second point in regard to painting is since you have applied Physics, the paint 
action takes place while an Animation Sequence is running. This means that you 
have to activate or start the Animation in the Timeline Window before you can 
paint. You start the Animation by pressing the Play button in the Timeline Window 
or by pressing Alt + A Key on the keyboard.
If you have the 3D Window in User Perspective, User Orthographic, or Camera 
View, remember that moving the Mouse and dragging the Brush will translate it 
 

143
on the plane of the view. That is, it moves on the ﬂat plane that is your computer 
screen. If the Canvas Plane is at a different angle then moving the Brush Sphere 
moves it away from the Canvas in elevation. To keep the Brush on the center of the 
Canvas in elevation, have the 3D Window in Top Orthographic View.
OK! Start the Animation sequence, grab the Brush, and move it (in Top Orthographic 
View). You will see the paint effect applied to the Canvas.
Animation Sequence Time
The default animation sequence in the Timeline Window is set to Start at Frame 
1 and End at frame 250. The sequence runs for 250 Frames then repeats. The 
default Frame Rate is 24 frames per second (see the Properties Window, Render 
buttons, Dimensions tab—Frame rate). This means that, in order to paint, you have 
approximately 10 second to create your masterpiece.
You had better be a quick painter!
 

144
You can change the End Frame value in the Timeline Window in an attempt to 
increase the time but that doesn’t do the trick. Go back and look at the Canvas 
Dynamic Paint tab in the Properties Window. Change the End Frame value here 
and in the Timeline Window.
Brush Stroke Thickness
Obviously you may wish to vary the thickness of your paint line and obviously you 
can do this by increasing or decreasing the diameter of the sphere. Another way 
would be to use an inverted Cone Object as a Brush and vary its elevation in Front 
Orthographic View.
 

145
Paint Color
In the demonstration so far the paint color has been the default blue that you see 
in the color bar in the Brush, Dynamic Paint tab. Clicking on the color bar displays 
the color circle where you may select a different color.
Another option is to use the Material color of the Brush Object. Instead of clicking 
the color bar in the Dynamic Paint tab, check (tick) Use Object Material.
The color bar will change to a Material Selection button showing the Material which 
is applied to the Brush Object. In the diagram above, the Material is Material.004.
 

146
The color bar will change to a Material Selection button showing the Material 
which is applied to the Brush Object. In the diagram above, the Material is 
Material.004.
Drag the Brush around 
a side elevation of the 
Monkey Object to paint a 
stripe.
Experiment 
with 
other 
views and settings.
Dynamic Paint Is Not 
Just for Painting
There is more to Dynamic Paint than Paint. You can also use the tool to deform the 
surface of a mesh.
Set up a Scene as shown in the diagram. Yes it’s the same as before with a 
UV Sphere in the center of a Plane which has been scaled up. Don’t forget to 
subdivide the Plane.
I have applied a green blue Material to the Plane since we will be transforming the 
surface into water and making waves and ripples.
Set up the UV Sphere as the Brush. In this case, it is not necessary to apply a 
Material.
Set up the Plane as the Canvas, then in the Properties Window, Dynamic Paint 
Advanced tab click the Surface Type bar and select Waves from the menu.
 

147
Click Play in the Timeline Window Header. Grab the UV Sphere Brush (G Key). 
Drag the mouse over the surface of the Canvas and see waves being made. It 
doesn’t matter here that the Brush goes under or above the Canvas since this has 
the effect of producing splashes.
And there is still more. With the same set up as before, select Displace in the 
Dynamic paint advanced tab.
 

148
This time place the 3D Window in Top Orthographic View when painting. The 
surface of the Canvas (Plane) is deformed up or down depending on the Displace 
Factor value (− negative for depression + positive for elevation).
Note: If the negative–positive values work in the opposite direction, this is due to 
the Normals setting of the Canvas. Select the Canvas, Tab to Edit Mode and in the 
Tools panel Shading Uvs tab, under Normals, click on Flip Direction.
Rotate the 3D Window after stopping the Animation Sequence midway to see the 
effect.
 

149
Chapter 14 
Physics
Physics is the study of matter and energy and the relationships between them, 
including the study of forces, heat, light, sound, electricity, and the structure of 
atoms.
In Blender, Objects are given Physics characteristics which make them behave 
how they would in the real world. This allows interaction with other objects when 
animated.
In a new Blender Scene arrange some Cubes, Planes, and a UV Sphere Object 
as shown in the diagram. The objective is to have the sphere roll down the inclined 
plane and knock down the stack of cubes. To do this, you assign Physics to each 
of the objects in the Scene.
14

150
The arrangement doesn’t have to be exact but pay particular attention to how the 
cubes are stacked. Position the bottom cube just above the ﬂoor Plane leaving a 
slight gap between the Cube and the Plane. Leave a slight gap between all the 
Cubes and have them slightly staggered.
Physics is applied to each Object in the Scene from the Properties Window, Physics 
buttons.
 

151
There are several options for enabling Physics but in this case use Rigid Body 
Physics.
To apply Physics to an Object, you must have the Object selected in the 3D Window. 
You do this for each Object.
Select the Floor Plane in the 3D Window.
In the Properties Window, Physics buttons 
click on Rigid Body. This applies Physics and 
opens the Rigid Body tabs. By default the 
Rigid Body Type is Active and Dynamic is 
checked (ticked).
You don’t want the Plane to move in the 
Scene so change Active to Passive.
Repeat the same Physics set up for the 
Inclined Plane.
Set up Physics for the Cube Objects.
Select each Cube in turn and click on Rigid Body in the Physics buttons.
Now you want the Cubes to move in the Scene, therefore leave the Rigid Body 
Type: Active and ensure that Dynamic is checked.
 

152
Repeat the Active Dynamic Physics set up for the UV Sphere but in the Rigid Body 
Collision tab change Shape: from Convex Hull to Sphere.
With Physics applied to all the Objects in the Scene, press the Play button in the 
Timeline Window. The Cubes will fall and sit on top of one another. The Sphere will 
roll down the inclined plane and give the cube stack a nudge. If you increase the 
Mass: Value in the Rigid Body tab to 10, the Sphere will demolish the stack and 
push two of the cubes off the side of the ﬂoor plane.
 

153
Other Physics Options
You have already used some of the other Physics options in your little Blender 
journey: Fluid, Smoke, and Dynamic Paint.
Take a look at the Cloth option. This one throws in a few variations in regard to the 
set up.
Start a new Blender Scene. Leave the default Cube Object where it is. Add a 
Plane Object. Scale the Plane up four times and subdivide it. Don’t forget to 
SUBDIVIDE!
You may add a material (Color) to the Objects but it is not necessary.
 

154
The objective in this Physics exercise is to drape the Plane, which we will turn into 
a cloth, over the Cube.
Applying Physics in this instance is performed using Blender’s Modiﬁers.
Select the Plane in the 3D Window then in the Properties Window, Modiﬁer buttons 
click on Add Modiﬁer and select Cloth from the menu.
The Modiﬁer is assigned to the Plane which turns it into a Cloth. 
You can see the Physics settings in the Properties Window, 
Physics buttons.
Select the Cube in the 3D Window then in the Properties 
Window, Modiﬁer buttons click on Add Modiﬁer and this time 
select Collision.
 

155
In the Timeline Window, press the Play button. The Cloth (Plane) falls and drapes 
over the Cube.
Pinning
Pinning means pinning the edges or corners of a cloth as if pegging to a clothes 
line.
Use the same Cloth arrangement with the Physics. In the Timeline Window, press 
the Go To Start button to position the Timeline Cursor at Frame 1.
Select the Cloth (Plane) in the 3D Window, tab to Edit Mode, press the A Key to 
deselect the vertices. Press Shift and RMB click two corner vertices.
 

156
In the Properties Window, Data buttons, Vertex Group tab, click the Plus sign to 
create a Vertex Group Slot. With the two vertices selected in the 3D Window, click 
the Assign button to assign the two vertices to the Group.
Tab back to Object Mode.
With the Cloth (Plane) selected in 
the 3D Window, go to the Properties 
Window, Physics buttons, Cloth tab, 
and check (tick) Pinning. In the bar 
underneath, click and select, Group 
from the menu (Group is the only 
entry).
Click on the Presets: bar and select Cotton from the menu.
 

157
Press Play in the Timeline Window to see one side of the Cloth fall and drape over 
the Cube.
Note: The Cube tears through the Cloth. Go back and change the Presets to other 
options and see the different results.
 

 

159
Chapter 15 
Games
Blender has a special section built in for making games called the Blender Game 
Engine. In this section you place objects and characters in a Scene, which you can 
move, using the keyboard and mouse or a joystick. The moving objects are called 
Actors. The Actors interact with other Actors and Objects which you also place in 
the Scene. You can add special effects and animations to make the game really 
interesting.
The best way to learn how to make a game is to start from scratch (the beginning) 
so that you understand the basics. I can show you this, then you will be able to look 
at Blender Game ﬁles and ﬁgure out how they work.
Before you go into the Game Engine, you can make an Actor and a stage on which 
it performs, in the default Blender Scene.
I will keep this very simple, which means it won’t be terribly exciting. This is the 
crawling stage which leads on to some really exciting stuff.
15

160
The Actor will be a simple Object which we will make move around in the Scene. 
You can use the default Cube Object. In the default Blender Scene, with the default 
Cube selected, scale on the Y axis as shown in the diagram. Tab into Edit Mode. 
In the Tool Panel (LHS of 3D Window) click on Subdivide once, to create more 
vertices. Select two center vertices and move them to form a pointy bit.
This is simply to allow you to see the direction of movement.
Tab back to Object mode and give the elongated Cube a Material color. Deselect 
the cube. Add a Plane Object, scale it up, and position it just below the Cube. Apply 
a Material to the Plane.
Remember that by default there is a Lamp and a Camera already positioned in the 
Scene.
 

161
The Game Engine
To start the Game engine, there are two actions to perform. In the Info Window 
header at the top of the screen, click on the icon next to where you see Default and 
select Game Logic from the menu that displays. This changes the default Blender 
Screen arrangement, opening the windows for game development.
In the Info Window Header, click where you see Blender Render and select 
Blender Game in the menu that displays.
 

162
The Logic Editor Window
The Logic Editor Window is where you assemble (program) the controls which 
make things happen in the game. The controls are programmed by assembling 
Logic Blocks. Logic Blocks are like icons which call up preassembled pieces of 
computer code. You don’t have to write the code, you only have to understand 
what the pieces of code are for. At the top of the Logic Editor Window, you see 
the three selection panels for the Logic Blocks: Sensor, Controller, and Actuator.
 

163
Sensors are the input signals which cause something to happen. These can be 
Mouse clicks or Keyboard buttons or actions from other objects.
Controllers, control how the Sensor signals are relayed to the Actuator.
Actuators have adjustable values which you set to make your Actor or Object 
behave in the game.
Clicking on the Add Sensor, Add Controller, and Add Actuator buttons displays 
menus for selecting different types of each category (see diagram opposite).
To understand how this works, create a Logic Block arrangement to drive your 
Actor (the elongated Cube with the pointy end) around in the Scene.
Make sure you have your Actor selected in the 3D Window.
Click on Add Sensor and select (click) Keyboard in the menu.
In the Keyboard Sensor that 
opens, click on the Key: panel. A 
message displays instructing you 
to Press a key. Press the W Key 
on your keyboard. This assigns 
the W Key as the input device for 
this sensor.
When you press the W Key, your 
Actor will move forward.
Well! It will eventually when you 
have ﬁnished setting up.
 

164
 

165
More Setting Up
Click on Add Controller and select And (Yes! And).
The And Controller is good to go 
as it is.
Click on Add Actuator and select Motion.
Note that in the Motion 
Actuator panel the Motion 
Type is Simple Motion and 
all the values for location 
(Loc:) and rotation (Rot:) are 
zero.
You will be hooking this 
Actuator up to the Sensor 
via the Controller. When you 
press the key you set as the input device for the Sensor (the W Key) you want your 
Actor to move in the forward direction. Forward is in the direction of the pointy bit. 
In the 3D Window in Top Orthographic View, you will see this as being positive 
along the Y axis. To get the Actor to move in a forward direction, set Loc: Y = 0.02 
(0.02 is positive, −0.02 is negative which of course is the reverse).
With the Logic Blocks in place, click on the little black dot beside the Keyboard 
Sensor, hold, and drag over to the bigger black dot beside the And Controller. This 
is connecting them together and telling Blender to use the signal from one in the 
other. Do the same between the Controller and the Actuator.
Click on Add Sensor, Add Controller, and Add Actuator a second time, to add a 
second Logic Block for each category and repeat the connection process.
The diagram opposite shows the Logic Block arrangement for forward and reverse 
movement with the W Key as forward and the Z Key as reverse.
 

166
 

167
Keyboard Control Arrangement
You can assign any keyboard key 
you like as the input signal device, 
but it’s a good idea to have a plan 
and make life as easy as possible 
for the game player.
You want your Actor to move 
forward, reverse, and turn right and 
left. To make this happen, set up 
a pattern of keys on the keyboard 
which is easy to remember and 
easy to manipulate. Keep in mind that you may want to introduce other inputs such 
as a mouse click to cause something else to happen. One possible key pattern 
would be as shown above. This arrangement is shown on a Qwerty keyboard. 
Guess why?
As you can see in the diagrams, the Logic Block Editor Window rapidly begins to 
ﬁll even though you have only worked on a simple forward and reverse motion. In 
the upper RH corner of each Sensor, Controller, and Actuator, you will see a small 
white triangle. You click on this to collapse and expand the panels.
Collapse the panels you have added so far, then add more Sensors, Controllers, 
and Actuators as shown in the diagram opposite. In the Keyboard sensor panels, 
assign the A Key and the S Key. When combined with the W Key and the Z Key, 
this provides a  forward reverse and left and right conﬁguration. Note: All Controllers 
are type And.
In the new Motion Actuators, enter Rot (rotation) values of plus and minus 0.5 for 
the Z Rotation Axis.
 

168
When you ﬁnally get to try the game, you will ﬁnd the forward and reverse motion 
is very slow. You can come back later and increase the values to whatever you 
wish, but we don’t want you zooming off and crashing when you push the Play 
button.
Before you ask! No, you are not good to go just yet.
You have to assign Physics.
Physics gives the game components attributes which simulate how they behave in 
the real world.
Remember that by default, there is a gravitational effect applied in the Scene.
Physics
As far as you are concerned, Physics is how an Actor or an Object reacts with other 
Actors or Objects in a Scene. Your Scene is an artiﬁcial world in which you are 
attempting to simulate the real world, therefore, there are physical forces built into 
the simulation. One of these forces is Gravity.
In Blender, Gravity is always in effect unless you turn it off. You can do this in 
the Properties Window, Scene buttons, but in case you forget, when an Object 
is entered in the Blender Game Engine it is designated as Physics Type: Static. 
This means it does not react to Gravity.
To apply Physics to an Actor or Object, have the object selected in the 3D Window, 
then in the Properties Window, click on the Physics button. The default Physics 
Type will be Static. The Actor or Object will not move when the game is played.
 

169
To change the Physics Type to Dynamic, click on the Physics type bar and select 
Dynamic from the menu. Set the Actor Physics Type to Dynamic and the Floor 
Plane to Static.
 

170
When you start something it’s a good idea to know how to stop it. To STOP the 
game, press the Esc Key.
In your very simple game, when you press the P Key, the game starts and you will 
see the Cube Actor fall and come to rest on the surface of the Plane.
To drive the Cube Actor around the Plane, press the W Key to go forward, the 
Z Key to reverse and A and S Keys for turning left and right. With the Y axis 
Loc (Location) values in the Motion Actuators set at 0.02, the forward and reverse 
movement will be very slow. When you have the feel for how the game is played, 
go back and increase the values.
A point to remember is the Axis values are the Local Axis values for the Object, not 
the Global Axis of the Scene. When you rotate the Cube Actor, the positive Y axis 
of the cube is in the direction of the pointy end.
This is the very basic assembly of a game in the Game Engine. From this point on, 
you can begin to build a game which will be much more interesting. As a starter, 
add more Cubes to the Scene positioned at random on the Plane. Give them 
Dynamic Physics then you can either drive around them or push them about on 
the plane.
If you drive the Actor off the Plane or push an Object over the 
edge of the plane, you will see them descend in space and 
disappear into oblivion. You may wish to include this feature in 
your game.
 

171
The Scene in Game Mode with Additional Objects.
The Actor has been driven into the near corner of the plane.
Let’s develop the game a little further.
Expand the 3D Window so that you have a good overall plan view of the Scene.
 

172
If you press the P Key (Play) with the Mouse Cursor in the window, the game will 
play in the view that is displayed in the 3D Window. In this case, in Plan View, press 
Esc to cancel Play.
Change to Camera View (Num Pad 0). Pressing P for Play in Camera View plays 
the game in Camera View. Remember, you must have the Mouse Cursor in the 3D 
Window before pressing the P Key.
It’s all very well playing the game as if you are looking down from above but I know 
you will want to play from a ﬁrst person perspective. That means you play as if 
you are sitting in the driving seat or looking from behind the gun in a shoot-em-up 
game. To do this, you position the Camera to look from behind your Actor and 
make the Camera move with the Actor.
In the Scene at the moment, the Camera View looks like the image on the left. You 
want to see it like the image on the right.
In the 3D Window, in Top Orthographic View, select the Camera and using the 
Widget move it in line with and slightly behind the Cube Actor.
Switch between Top view and Camera view and adjust the camera position until 
you have a view as shown in the right-hand image.
Pressing Play at this point and pressing the forward motion button (W Key) will see 
the Cube Actor move away from you heading toward the blue Cone.
The next trick is to make the Camera move with the Actor so that, from your point 
of view, you move with the Cube Actor.
 

173
Head down to the Properties Window which is in the Game Logic window 
arrangement, located in the lower RH corner of the screen.
Have the Cube Actor selected in the 3D Window. In the Properties Window, click 
on the Object data button, and in the Transform tab, check that all Rotation values 
are 0 and all Scale values are 1.000. When you model your Actor, you will inevitably 
start with one of the Blender Primitives and, depending on the complexity of the 
model, scaling and rotation will be performed. Residual values may remain after 
these operations. In your case you scaled the Cube Object on the Y axis. Do you 
see the scale value in the Transform tab? The rotation of the cube was unaltered.
 

174
To have the Camera follow the Cube Actor, you have to Parent it to the Cube. This 
is like telling the Camera to take hold of the Cube’s hand and not let go. Before you 
do this, you have to get rid of any residual scale and rotation values.
To remove the values, have the Cube 
Actor selected, then in the 3D Window 
header, click on Object, click on Apply, 
then select Rotation & Scale. This tells 
Blender to consider your Actor model 
as if it were a new Object which hadn’t 
been messed with.
You now are set to Parent the Camera 
to the Actor.
Deselect the Cube Actor and select the Camera (press A Key to deselect and click 
RMB to select). In Camera View, you may click RMB on the edge of the camera 
aperture.
Note that the Properties Window changes to show the Object data settings for the 
Camera. In the Relations tab, click in the Parent bar with the little orange cube icon 
and select Cube from the menu that displays.
 

175
Remember: Cube is the name of your actor as far as Blender is concerned. The 
little orange cube in the Parent bar has nothing to do with this. It is merely an icon. 
If you had renamed your Actor something else and had modeled the Actor from 
one of the other Primitives, you would still see a cube icon.
With the Mouse Cursor in the 3D Window, Camera View, press the P Key (Play). 
The Objects in the game settle on the ﬂoor plane and when you press the W 
Key (forward motion) the Camera view follows the Cube Actor toward the Cone. 
Pressing the A, S, and Z Keys will direct the Cube Actor in the Scene.
Remember: If you drive the Cube Actor over the edge of the ground plane, it will 
disappear into oblivion.

Chapter 16 
Project 
Animation Sequence
Having worked through the book, you will have picked up a fair amount of knowledge 
and discovered some of Blender’s secrets. Blender is full of things to discover 
which are interesting as stand-alone features. When you are aware of these, you 
can begin to let your imagination run wild and create wondrous computer graphics. 
The following exercise will give you a feel for how to combine and use the features. 
You will learn more detail, building on what has already been covered, and more 
importantly see how to build a more complex animation.
Animation movies, especially full length feature movies, are made up of many 
video sequences combined into video clips which, in turn, are combined into the 
ﬁnal feature movie. Each sequence may combine a number of Blender’s features 
to produce effects.
Start at the beginning. A good place to start.
The simple plan for this project is to see how a model is animated to collide with 
another model causing both to explode and catch on ﬁre.
16

178
It’s obvious that the Blender features to be used are: Modeling, Animating, Explode 
(Quick Explode), and Fire (Quick Fire). These have been introduced in earlier 
chapters.
Guess what? You will be using the aircraft model from Chapter 5.
You did save the Blender .blend ﬁle, didn’t you?
Start a new Blender Scene and delete the default cube.
The plan for the animation sequence is to have the aircraft appear from behind 
some hills, crash into a dome causing both the dome and the aircraft to explode. 
This is not intended to represent any event whether it be real or imaginary. It is 
merely a demonstration of creating something using animation effects.
In the demonstration I will be keeping to a fairly basic plan, therefore the end result 
will be a rather crude animation. In reality it would be a starting point for further 
reﬁnement, but it will demonstrate how to combine the features.
The ﬁrst step in the process is to create a background for the Scene.
Create a Landscape
In the Scene, add a Plane object.
Scale the Plane up eight times (S Key + 8 + Enter). Tab into Edit mode, then in the 
Tool Panel at the LHS of the screen, click on Subdivide, six times. This produces 
vertices for manipulation. Press the A Key to deselect the vertices.
Still in Edit mode, select a single vertex (click RMB) somewhere toward the rear of 
the Plane off to one side.
 

179
The Manipulation Widget will locate at the selected vertex. If it doesn’t show, 
click on the Widget button in the 3D Window header. Also in the header, enable 
Proportional Editing and select the Random Falloff option.
With the single vertex selected, press the G Key (Grab). When you move your 
mouse, the vertex will move and a white circle displays. Scroll MMB to increase or 
decrease the circle size. This circle determines how many vertices will be affected 
by the Proportional Editing.
In adjusting the circle of inﬂuence, you will probably move some vertices about. For 
this exercise it is not important, but if you want to be precise, you can always press 
Ctrl + Z Key to undo previous steps in the editing.
Use the Widget to drag the vertex up (blue arrow). When you drag the selected 
vertex up, vertices within the circle of inﬂuence follow, and since you have Random 
Falloff selected they follow in a random order.
 

180
Press the A Key to deselect the vertex, then repeat the process on the opposite 
side of the Plane forming a second peak. None of this has to be precise since you 
want to create a random landscape. You may select several vertices at one time. 
Note that the vertices in the circle of inﬂuence are not selected as such. They just 
follow what is selected. You may also select vertices and move them down forming 
depressions in the landscape.
When you have your landscape shaped the way you want it, Tab back to Object 
mode. In the Tool panel, click on Smooth. In the Properties Window add a nice 
soft green Material color (see Chapter 7). I have used R: 0.600 G: 0.800 B: 0.432.
Deselect the Plane (Landscape). Press A Key.
 

181
Add a Dome to the Scene
Before you deselected the Plane, you would have seen the Manipulation Widget 
located at the center of the Plane. Since the Plane hasn’t been moved, it remains 
at the center of the 3D World. The 3D Window cursor, however, could be anywhere 
in the window, wherever you happened to click the mouse button.
You are about to add a new Object to the Scene. When you add an Object, it will 
be placed at the location of the 3D Window cursor. To put the cursor exactly at the 
center of the Scene, press Shift + S Key and select Cursor to Center from the 
menu that displays.
Add a UV Sphere Object. Zoom in on the Scene and place the 3D Window in Right 
Orthographic View (Num Pad 1). The sphere is at the center of the Scene which 
is the center of the 3D World, therefore the lower half of the UV Sphere is below 
the Plane. To create a Dome, you simply remove the lower half.
With the UV Sphere selected, tab 
to Edit mode. In the 3D Window 
header, turn off Limit Selection 
to Visible.
Press the A Key to deselect the 
vertices, then the B Key (box select) 
and drag a rectangle around the 
lower half of the sphere. With the 
lower half selected, press the X 
Key and select Delete—Vertices.
 

182
Change to Object mode and apply a Material (color) to the dome. I have used a 
Diffuse: R 0.800 G 0.080 B 0.002.
Add a Base to the Dome
Deselect the Dome (UV Sphere). In Top Orthographic View (Num Pad 7), add a 
Circle Object. Make sure the 3D Window cursor is at the center of the Scene which 
coincides with the center of the Dome. Press the S Key and scale the circle up 
slightly (S Key [scale]—Drag the mouse) so that you see it outside of the Dome. 
Tab to Edit mode. You will see the circle with vertices around its circumference.
Note: The center of the circle is empty (it has no surface). Press the F Key (Face) 
to ﬁll in the center of the circle. Tab to Object mode and apply a Material (Black R 
0.000 G 0.000 B 0.0000).
Note that the black circle coincides with the surface of the landscape in elevation. 
In either Front or Right Orthographic View, use the Widget and move the Circle up 
slightly.
You will have a red dome with a black base nestled into the side of the right hand 
 mountain of the landscape.
It is time to add your aircraft model.
 

183
Add the Aircraft Model
Since your aircraft model is fairly simple, you can Append it from the Blender ﬁle 
that you previously saved. That is unless, like me, YES! me, you forgot to save it or 
you forgot where you saved it.
If you did forget, go back and start over. It’s good practice.
OK! You have a model of an aircraft saved in a Blender ﬁle.
Append the model (see Chapter 9) into your new landscape.
Remember, the model will be entered at the location of the 3D Window cursor, so 
if the cursor is at the center of the Scene, which is the center of the Dome, your 
aircraft will Append inside the Dome. Depending on the scale, it may be completely 
hidden from view or it may stick out from the Dome.
Scale the aircraft model down and park it off to one side in the Scene.
 

184
Make a note that your aircraft was modeled from a UV Sphere, so unless you 
renamed it, it remains named, Sphere, in your ﬁle. In this new Scene the Dome 
was modeled from a UV Sphere which was also named Sphere. You can’t have 
two objects with the same name so Blender automatically will have renamed your 
aircraft model to Sphere.001.
At this point all the models for the animation sequence are in place in the Scene.
It’s time for some animation.
Create a Glide Path
In Chapter 12 you animated your aircraft to ﬂy around a circular path (a Bezier 
curve circle). This time use a Curve Path to create a glide path.
A Curve Path is a curve that can be shaped and extended to form a path that an 
Object can be made to follow in an animation.
Be in Top Orthographic View and locate the 3D Window cursor approximately as 
shown in the ﬁgure. When you enter a curve into a scene, it locates at the position 
of the cursor. Press Alt + A Key, select Curve then select Path.
The Curve Path is entered in Object Mode and is positioned where you had the 
3D Window cursor. In Top Orthographic View it will be as shown above, but in 
elevation it is at the center of the Plane forming the Landscape.
In Object Mode, in Front Orthographic View, move the Curve Path midway up the 
Dome.
 

185
Back in Top Orthographic View, Tab into Edit mode. You will see the path has 
chevrons along its length indicating the direction of travel an Object following the 
path will take. There is also a series of orange dots. These are Control Points for 
shaping the Curve Path.
With the Curve Path selected, tab to Edit Mode, then press the A Key to deselect 
the control points. The points will display as black dots. Click RMB on the LH dot 
then click and drag the green widget handle to curve the path. With the LH control 
handle still selected, press the E Key (extrude) and drag the mouse, extending the 
curve. Repeat the extensions (extrusions) forming a path around the mountain to a 
point approximately opposite the Camera.
 

186
Repeat the process with the other end of the Curve Path shaping and extending it 
through the Dome to a point somewhere off to the RHS.
In elevation, grab control points and shape the Curve Path to approximate the glide 
path shown in the ﬁgure below. The Path passes through the Dome.
 

187
With the glide path complete, tab to Object mode and deselect the curve (A Key).
Animate the Aircraft
The aircraft model will be animated to follow the Curve Path.
Place the 3D Window in Top Orthographic View.
Select your aircraft model and move it over to the start of the Curve Path.
In the Properties Window, Constraint button, add a Follow Path Constraint 
(Chapter 12) with the Target set as Nurbs Path and with Follow Curve checked 
(ticked). If necessary, drag the aircraft to the start of the path and align by setting 
Forward: Y and Up: Z in the Constraint Panel.
Deselect the Aircraft Model and select the Curve Path.
In the Timeline Window, the Timeline Cursor (green line) should be at Frame 1.
 

188
The Aircraft model is positioned at the start of the Curve Path and the Timeline 
Cursor is at Frame 1.
With the Curve Path selected, in the Properties Window, Object Data button, 
Path Animation tab ensure that Path Animation is checked (ticked). Click RMB 
on the Evaluation Time bar and select Insert Keyframe from the menu. The bar 
turns yellow and a yellow line is drawn at Frame 1 in the Timeline Window.
Click on the Timeline Cursor and drag it to Frame 250. In the Evaluation Time 
bar (it is displayed green), change the value to 100.000 (100%). Click RMB in the 
Evaluation Time bar and select Insert Keyframe from the menu.
When you changed the Evaluation Time to 100%, your Aircraft Model relocated to 
the end of the Curve Path.
Click on the Go to Start button in the Timeline Window header to position the 
cursor at Frame 1. Your aircraft relocates to the start of the Curve Path.
Press the Play button in the Timeline Widow to see your aircraft move along the 
path in the 250 frame animation.
The aircraft moves fairly slowly. To put the movement into perspective, imagine the 
aircraft is a huge jumbo jet ﬂying around a mountain. The 250 frame animation is 
playing at the default 24 frames per second, therefore the aircraft takes approximately 
10 seconds to traverse the path. In Camera view the Aircraft, as it appears from 
behind the mountain, swings around, and passes through the Dome.
You can click and drag the green Timeline Window cursor backward and forward to 
see how it looks at different frames. Do this and make a note of the frame number 
where the Aircraft sticks about half way into the Dome, and the frame number 
where it is sticking half way out when it exits. You will use this information a little 
later on.
Everything is ﬁne so far so it’s time to introduce explosions into the animation. The 
objective will be to have the Dome explode and catch on ﬁre when the aircraft hits 
it, then the aircraft will also explode.
To introduce ﬁre and explosion, use the Quick Smoke method (Chapter 2) in 
conjunction with an Explode Modiﬁer (Chapters 3 and 4).
 

189
Exploding the Dome
Select the Dome in the 3D Window. In the Properties Window, Particles buttons, 
click New to add a Particle System.
Set the values as shown in the ﬁgure below.
With the Dome selected add an Explode Modiﬁer in the Properties Window, 
Modiﬁer buttons.
Play the animation in the Timeline to see the Dome explode when the Aircraft 
crashes into it. You will see the Faces of the Dome ﬂy away. Drag the Timeline 
cursor to a point just past the beginning of the explosion. Render an image (F12).
 

190
You see that the rendered image is very different from the view in the 3D Window. 
The faces of the Dome ﬂy apart following the particles. The particles render as 
points of light taking on the Material (color) of the Dome.
Look closely at the 3D Window view and you will see your aircraft inside the 
explosion, intact. In the animation, it ﬂies through the Dome unscathed. This will 
be addressed later.
When something explodes, it can start a ﬁre so you should add ﬁre into the equation.
Adding Fire
After the Dome explodes, there isn’t much left except for the base (the black circle). 
Add the Quick Smoke Modiﬁer to the Circle.
Select the Circle object. Press the Space Bar and in the search window that 
displays type, Quick Smoke. In the Tool panel at the LHS of the window, set the 
modiﬁer to Type: Smoke + Fire.
In the 3D Window, you will see an orange rectangle appear surrounding the Dome. 
This is the Domain for the Smoke + Fire simulation. It represents the cubic 
volume of space in which the simulation takes place. It only surrounds the Dome 
since the Circle object was placed at the base of the Dome. The size of the Domain 
could be adjusted to suit, but it should be ﬁne the way it is.
Play the animation in the Timeline. Smoke and ﬁre emit from the Circle immediately. 
To delay the emission until the explosion takes place, you must ﬁrst let the animation 
play through to the end.
 

191
Playing the animation creates the data for the Smoke + Fire simulation and stores 
it in a Cache. The controls for the Cache are in the Properties Window, Physics 
buttons, Smoke Cache tab. In the tab, set Start: 150 (the frame just after the 
explosion commences). Leave the End frame as 250. The ﬁre will continue to the 
end of the animation.
When you play the entire animation at this point, the Dome explodes and catches 
on ﬁre when the Aircraft crashes into the Dome. Miraculously the Aircraft ﬂies on 
by without a scratch. Of course, the Aircraft would also explode in the disaster.
Explode the Aircraft
To cause the Aircraft to explode, you perform a similar operation to exploding the 
Dome. Select the Aircraft, add a Particle System and an Explode Modiﬁer.
In the Properties Window, Particle buttons, Emissions tab set Start: 170 (midway into 
the explosion), End: 190 (190 − 170 = 20 divided by 24 frames per second = 0.833 
seconds). Set Emit From: Volume, uncheck Even Distribution and change Jittered 
to Random.
 

192
Play the animation to see the Dome explode, catch on ﬁre and the Aircraft 
disintegrate leaving the ﬁreball. Change the Material of the Aircraft to something 
dark (dark blue) for a better view.
The rectangular shape in the render is a shadow from the Domain. To stop this 
occurring go to the Properties Window, Render buttons, and uncheck Shadows in 
the Shading tab.
The End.
 

193
This exercise demonstrates how features in Blender are combined to produce 
an effect. The animation produced is rough around the edges and could do with 
reﬁnement but it will do for now.
As you will have seen, there are numerous settings, which can be combined 
and adjusted to suit an application. This is the world of computer graphics. It is a 
fantastic study and I hope this introduction encourages you to explore and discover 
other fantastic features.

Chapter 17 
Installation
Installation is as easy as ABC.
Remember learning ABC? Probably not, but when you start out the simplest things 
aren’t that easy. Sometimes everyone assumes that you know how to do stuff and 
it’s not always easy to remember.
I will run through this installation business from go to whoa.
Hook on to the Internet and use your web browser to go to the Blender website:
www.blender.org
If you type: www.blender.org/downloads/ into the web address bar, you will arrive 
directly at the download page.
17

196
Either way you will arrive at the download page and be presented with choices for 
downloading, for Windows, Mac OX, or GNU/Linux. These are operating systems 
so you download the Blender version which is suitable for the system you have on 
your computer.
I will run through the download and installation for a Windows operating system.
Even for Windows you are presented with more choices such as a download for 
a 64-bit system or a 32-bit system (see the note at the end of the chapter). Again 
you download the version for the system you have on your computer. Then you 
have options for downloading from various locations. DE is from Germany and 
NL1 or NL2 are from the Netherlands. You can choose whichever is best for you 
depending on where you live.
 

197
Still more choices. Do you want an Installer (.msi) ﬁle or a .ZIP ﬁle?
You choose the options by clicking in the download window.
Installing with the Installer (.msi) Option
If you choose the Installer (.msi) option, you will be presented with this download 
window:
Note the diagram shows the Windows installer for a 64-bit system. Click on Save 
File to download to your computer. You will probably ﬁnd the download in your 
Downloads folder:
Double click on the ﬁle name in the Downloads folder and Blender will be 
automatically installed to the Program Files folder on your computer and an icon 
will be placed on your Desktop.
 

198
Installing with the .ZIP Option
If you chose the .ZIP option, you will be presented with this download window:
Note: In this case the diagram shows the download for a 32-bit system. Click on 
OK to save the ﬁle to download it to your computer.
With a .ZIP ﬁle, you will have to unzip the ﬁle. You ﬁrst create a new folder on your 
computer, then use a program like 7-Zip or Win-Zip to unzip (decompress) the zip 
ﬁle into the new folder (see the note at the end of the chapter).

When the ﬁle is unzipped into the new folder, you will see blender.exe as one of 
the entries. You double click on this to run Blender or you can create a shortcut 
which places an icon on your desktop.
Note: 32–64 Bit
The terms 32 bit and 64 bit refer to the way a computer’s processor (also called a 
CPU) handles information. The 64-bit version of Windows handles large amounts 
of random access memory (RAM) more effectively than a 32-bit system.
Note: Unzipping
7-Zip is an open source (free) application for decompressing (unzipping) .zip ﬁles. 
You download the program from: http://www.7-zip.org where there is a link to 7-Zip’s 
Source Forge web page which provides instructions.

Chapter 18 
Blender Overhaul
Now that you have taken the test drive and found out some of what Blender can 
do, you might like to take a closer look under the hood and discover more about 
the program.
You have probably crashed through a few gears and encountered problems during 
your drive so you will need the manual before you start tinkering.

Every good mechanic has a check list to follow when they do an overhaul or a 
service on a vehicle. With Blender, the check list for the major parts is the list of 
windows that are available.
The Windows are listed as Editor Types, and the list is 
accessed by clicking on any of the window icons.
For example, click on the 3D Window icon or on the Info 
Window icon.
3D View: This is the 3D Window where you create 
models and scenes. The 3D Window has several 
different Viewport Shading modes which control how 
the Scene in the windows displays.
The Shading Mode you select depends on what you 
are doing at the time.
The 3D Window also has different operational modes, which, again, are selected 
depending on the operation being performed. You have seen how to switch between 
Object Mode and Edit Mode.
The other options are selected for speciﬁc operations.
 

203
Timeline: The Timeline Window where you construct and play animations.
Graph Editor: The Graph Editor Window has two different modes.
F-Curve: When an Object is animated to move in a scene, graphs are displayed in 
this window mode. The Graphs are editable; therefore, the animation (movement 
of the Object) can be controlled by changing the graph.
Driver: Drivers are another way to control animations.
Dope Sheet: The Dope Sheet Window also has several different modes for a 
variety of operations.
NLA Editor: The NLA Editor Window is primarily used for animation control.
 

204
UV Image Editor: The UV Image Editor Window is, as it says in the name, where 
you edit images. There are modes for painting and creating image masks.
Video Sequence Editor: Video editing tools.
Movie Clip Editor: Motion tracking tools.
Text Editor: Where you can write notes or edit code.
Node Editor: There is a fantastic way of adding and controlling Materials (colors) 
and Textures. Preassembled code is displayed in graphic blocks called Nodes. 
These blocks can be arranged and connected together in a multitude of ways to 
produce an inﬁnite array of effects.
Logic Editor: This window was demonstrated when we discussed Game Creation. 
It’s where you set up the controls for your video games.
Properties: The Properties Window. The power house with all the buttons and 
sliders for controlling most everything in the 3D Window.
Outliner: The Outliner Window shows you a display of everything in the 3D 
Window. Sometimes, when an Object is obscured by other things in the window 
which prevent you selecting what you want, you can select it here.
User Preferences: The User Preferences Window. This is where you change 
Blender and make it look the way you want. We saw how to change the background 
color of the 3D Window.
Info: The Info (Information) Window. If you drag the edge of the window down 
the screen you will see a line-by-line record of the actions you are doing in the 3D 
Window.
File Browser: The File Browser Window. As you have seen, this window opens 
when you want to ﬁnd a picture you have saved to your computer.
Python Console: You see the Python Console ﬂash on the screen when you start 
Blender. Python is the computer programming language used by Blender. The 
Python Console is the command line window for using Python.
As you can see, there are lots of windows with lots of options which means there 
is lots to learn and lots and lots of stuff you can do.

Conclusion
Blender is a fantastic program and computer graphics is an intriguing subject, 
which you can pursue as a hobby or a profession. This book has merely given 
a brief test drive in the Blender world. There is much more. It is impossible to 
write a book which covers all that there is to learn. If you wish to continue studies 
in Blender, there are numerous publications which cover speciﬁc parts of the 
subject, and there are literally hundreds of websites which provide video tutorials 
on all sorts of topics.
I recommend my book The Complete Guide to Blender Graphics.
Supplemental material may be found on the companion website,

The Complete Guide to Blender Graphics is a manual designed for those who 
wish to undertake a learning experience and discover a wonderful creative new 
world. The book will help you with the basics of computer animation using 
Blender. My approach has been to introduce the Blender features with examples 
and diagrams referenced to the graphical user interface (GUI).
In The Complete Guide to Blender Graphics, I reference video tutorials presented 
by Neai Hirsig of Tufts University, Boston.
