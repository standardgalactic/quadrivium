These are the so-called polarization identities. They tell us that in a Hilbert space, the inner product
is determined by the norm.
Let V be a real vector space with an inner product. It follows straightforward that

The task is to prove that in general
1) (x1 + x2, y) = (x1, y) + (x2, y),
2) (αx, y) = α(x, y).
In order to prove (1) we start by proving

This is done below.
In order to prove (2) we start by assuming that α ∈Z is an integer, then we assume that α ∈Q is
rational, and ﬁnally we let α ∈R be real. This task is also postponed.

We conclude from (2) that
(x, x) = ∥x∥=0,
if and only if
x = 0,
and if (·, ·) is an inner product, then the norm is deﬁned by this inner product.
We see that the claim will be proved if we can prove (1) and (2) above.
1) As mentioned above we ﬁrst prove (1), i.e.
(x1, y) + (x2, y) = 2

We get by computing the left hand side,
(x1, y) + (x2, y)

The latter two terms are treated separately by means of the law of parallelograms. (We shall
somewhere use the assumption).
If we put u + v = x1 + y and u −v = x2 + y, then
u = 1
2 (x1 + x2) + y
og
v = 1
2 (x1 −xx).
Then apply the law of parallelograms to get
∥x1 + y∥2 + ∥x2 + y∥2

and the auxiliary result is proved.
We use again the law of parallelograms in the following computation,

∥2z + y∥2 −∥2z −y∥2

∥z∥2 + ∥z −y∥2

4

∥z + y∥2 −∥z −y∥2
= 2(z, y),
where we get for the underlined terms that
∥z −(z + y)∥2 −∥z −(z −y)∥2 = ∥−y∥2 −∥y∥2 = 0.
Finally, use the result above with z = 1
2 (x1 + x2), to obtain
(3) (x1, y) + (x2, y) = 2
1
2 (x1 + x2), y

= (x1 + x2, y).
2) Let n ∈N. Then we get by repeatedly applying (3),
(nx, y) = (x + · · · + x, y) = (x, y) + · · · + (x, y) = n(x, y),
thus (2) holds for α = n ∈N.
If α = −1, then by the deﬁnition of (·, ·),
(−x, y) = 1
4

∥−x + y∥2 −∥−x −y∥2
= −1
4

∥x + y∥2 −∥x −y∥2
= −(x, y).
Composing this result with the previous one for n ∈N we get
(−nx, y) = −(nx, y) = −n(x, y),
and the formula holds for α ∈Z.
Then let α = 1
n, n ∈N. We shall prove that

n (x, y),
or, equivalently,

If ∥x −x0∥< δ, then it follows by the triangle inequality that
∥y0 + (x −x0)∥+ ∥y0 −(x −x0)∥≤2 {∥y0∥+ δ} ,
and
|∥y0 + (x −x0)∥−∥y0 −(x −x0)∥| ≤2∥x −x0∥≤2δ,
hence by insertion
|(x −x0, y0)| ≤1
4 · 2(∥y0∥+ δ) · 2δ = {∥y0∥+ δ} · δ < ε
for suﬃciently small δ. Since (·, y0) is continuous, the formula for Q is extended by the continuity
to all of R, and the claim is proved.
Remark 1.1 The most diﬃcult part of the example is that the notation (·, ·) is a little confusing.
One shall always be aware of distinguishing between what is given and what shall be proved. ♦
Remark 1.2 If also the complex law of parallelograms holds in a normed complex vector space,
then it is possible to prove the analogous result. Only the computations become much larger. ♦
Example 1.3 Show that the sup-norm on C([a, b]) is not induced by an inner product.
We know already that if a norm is deﬁned by an inner product, then we the law of parallelograms
holds,
∥f + g∥2 + ∥f −g∥2 = 2

∥f∥2 + ∥g∥2
.
Hence, it suﬃces to prove that the law of parallelograms does not hold for
∥f∥= sup{|f(t)| | t ∈[a, b]}
in C([a, b]).
We may assume that [a, b] = [0, 1].
Choose f(t) = 1 and g(t) = t for t ∈[0, 1]. Then ∥f∥= 1 and ∥g∥= 1, and
∥f + g∥= sup
t∈[0,1]
|1 + t| = 2,
∥f −g∥= sup
t∈[0,1]
|1 −t| = 1.
Hence
∥f + g∥2 + ∥f −g∥2 = 4 + 1 = 5
and
2

∥f∥2 + ∥g∥2
= 2(1 + 1) = 4.
It follows from
∥f + g∥2 + ∥f −g∥2 = 5 ̸= 4 = 2

∥f∥2 + ∥g∥2
,
that the law of parallelograms is not satisﬁed, so the sup-norm is not deﬁned by an inner product.

Example 1.4 Prove that in a real vector space with inner product we have that ∥x∥= ∥y∥implies
that
(x + y, x −y) = 0.
In the case V = R2 this is a well-known geometric statement – which one?

If ∥x∥= ∥y∥, then
(x + y, x −y) = (x, x) + (y, x) −(x, y) −(y, y) = ∥x∥2 −∥y∥2 = 0.
If we sketch the parallelogram of forces, then we have just proved that in a rhomb the diagonals are
perpendicular to each other.
Example 1.5 Let Vi, I = 1, . . . , k be vector spaces equipped with inner products (·, ·)i, respectively.
We deﬁne the product space k
i=1 Vi as in Example 2.16 in Ventus, Functional Analysis,
Topological and metric spaces, Banach spaces and bounded operators.
Show that we can deﬁne an inner product in n
i=1 Vi by
((x1, x2, . . . , xk), (y1, y2, . . . , yk)) =
k

i=1
(xi, yi)i,
and that k
i=1 Vi with this inner product is a Hilbert space if Vi, i = 1, . . . , k are Hilbert spaces.
Due to the structure of the suggested inner product it suﬃces to prove the claim for k = 2, because
the general result then follows by induction. In this way we avoid the usual mess of notation.
Consider two vector spaces V1, i = 1, 2, each one with an inner product (·, ·)i. We shall prove that
((x1, x2), (y1, y2)) := (x1, y1)1 + (x2, y2)2

deﬁnes an inner product on V × V .
First note that
((y1, y2), (x1, x2)) = (y1, x1)1 + (y2, x2)2 = (x1, y1)1 + (x2, y2)2 = ((x1, x2), (y1, y2)).
Then
(α(x1, x2) + (y1, y2), (z1, z2))
=
((αx1 + y1, αx2 + y2), (z1, z2))
=
(αx1 + y1, z1)1 + (αx2 + y2, z2)2
=
α(x1, z1)1 + (y1, z1)1 + α(x2, z2)2 + (y2, z2)2
=
α {(x1, z1)1 + (x2, z2)2} + {(y1, z1)1 + (y2, z2)2}
=
α ((x1, x2), (z1, z2)) + ((y1, y2), (z1, z2)) .
Finally,
((x1, x2), (x1, x2)) = (x1, x1)1 + (x2, x2)2 ≥0,
where we have equality, if and only if both ∥x∥1 = 0 and ∥x∥2 = 0, thus if and only if x1 = 0 and
x2 = 0, which again is the same as saying that (x1, x2) = (0, 0).
We have now proved that (·, ·) is an inner product on V1 × V2.
Then assume that k
i=1 Vi for some k ∈N is given an inner product by
((x1, x2, . . . , xk), (y1, y2, . . . , xk)) =
k

i=1
(xi, yi)i,
whenever each Vi is equipped with an inner product (·, ·)i, i = 1, . . . , k. We proved above that this
is true for k = 2.
Consider k + 1 vector spaces (Ui, ⟨·, ·⟩i), i = 1, . . . ,k + 1, each equipped with an inner product. We
deﬁne
V1 = ⊗k
i=1Ui
and
((x1, . . . , xk), (y1, . . . , yk))1 =
k

i=1
⟨xi, yi⟩i,
and
V2 = Uk+1
and
(xk+1, yk+1)2 = ⟨xk+1, yk+1⟩k+1.
It follows by using the assumption of induction that both (V1, (·, ·)1) and (V2, (·, ·)2) are vector spaces
with inner products. Then it follows from the result above that
V1 × V2 =
k+1


is also a vector space, equipped with the inner product
((x1, . . . , xk, xk+1), (y1, . . . , yk, yk+1)) = ((x1, . . . , xk), (y1, . . . , yk))1 + (xk+1, yk+1)2

and the ﬁrst claim is proved.
Then assume (for k = 2) that (Vi, (·, ·)i), i = 1, 2, are both Hilbert spaces. We shall prove that V1 ×V2
becomes a Hilbert space when it is given the inner product which has been constructed her, in other
words, we shall prove that V1 × V2 is complete.
Let ((xn
1, xn
2))n∈N be a Cauchy sequence in V1 × V2, which means that to every ε > 0 there exists an
N ∈N, such that for all m, n ≥N,
∥(xm

which shows that (xn

are both convergent by the assumption,
xn

a) If (x, y) = 0, then we immediately get that
∥x + αy∥2 = ∥x −αy∥2
for all α.
b) Assume that (x, y) ̸= 0. Choosing α = (x, y), we get
∥x + (x, y)y∥2 −∥x −(x, y)y∥2 = 4|(x, y)|2 > 0,
and it follows that ∥x + αy∦= ∥x −αy for α = (x, y).
2) Since ∥x + αy∥≥∥x∥and ∥x + αy∥2 ≥∥x∥2 are equivalent, we ﬁrst compute ∥x + αy∥2 −∥x∥2.
This gives
∥x + αy∥2 −∥x∥2

Remark 1.3 Hilbert spaces are the natural generalization of Euclidean spaces. This means that if
we only consider a subspace of a Hilbert space spanned by two vectors (like in the present situation),
then we might as well give a geometric proof in the usual 2-dimensional plane, because a 2-dimensional
Hilbert space is isomorphic to E2. Analogously in 3-dimensional subspaces. However, only very few
have a geometrical understanding of what is going on in Euclidean spaces of higher dimensions. I only
remember the late professor Fabricius Bjerre once told me that he himself had some sense of E4 as
being described as “shadows”. ♦

The answer is “no”! In fact, choose V = (C, +, ·, C), and
x = 1
and
y = i.
Then
|x + y|2 = |1 + i|2 = 12 + 12 = |1|2 + |i|2 = |x|2 + |y|2

and
(x, y) = (1, i) = −i(1, 1) = −i|1|2 = −i ̸= 0.

Example 1.8 Let V be a complex vector space with an inner product and assume that T ∈B(V ).
Show that (Ty, x) = 0 for all x, y ∈V if and only if T is the zero operator.
Show next that (Tx, x) = 0 for all x ∈V if and only if T is the zero operator.
If the vector space is assumed to be real, do these results hold?
1) Assume that (Tx, y) = 0 for all x, y ∈V . Choosing y = Tx ∈V we get
∥Tx∥2 = (Tx, Tx) = 0,
thus Tx = 0.
Since this is true for every x, we infer that T is the zero operator.
Of course this argument also holds if the vector space is real.
T(x,y) = (-y, x)
x
0
Figure 3: Rotation T of π
2 around (0, 0) in the plane E2, cf. (3).
2) Assume that (Tx, x) = 0 for every x ∈V . Then
0
=
(T(x + αy), x + αy) = (Tx + αTy, x + αy)
=
(Tx, x) + (Tx, αy) + α(Ty, x) + |α|2(Ty, y)
=
α(Tx, y) + α(Ty, x).
We infer that
α(Tx, t) = −α(Ty, x)
for alle x, y ∈V og α ∈C.
Choosing α = 1 we get
(4) (Tx, y) = −(Ty, x).
If we instead choose α = i, then
−i(Tx, y) = −i(Ty, x),

hence
(5) (Tx, y) = +(Ty, x).
By combining (4) and (5) we get
(Tx, y) = 0
for all x, y ∈V.
Then it follows from (1) that T is identically 0.
3) The last result is not true for real vector spaces.
Let V = E2 be the Euclidean plane, and let T denote the rotation around (0, 0) of the angle π
2 .
Expressed in coordinates we have
T(x, y) = (−y, x)
for (x, y) ∈E2.
Clearly, the mapping T is linear, and ∥T∥= 1 ̸= 0, hence T ̸= 0.
Finally,
(T(x, y), (x, y)) = ((−y, x), (x, y)) = −yx + xy = 0.
Remark 1.4 We see that it is essential for the proof that we in the derivation of (5) can choose
α = i. ♦

We shall prove that in a vector space of inner product,

A direct computation of the left hand side gives
∥x + y∥2 + ∥x −y∥2 = (x + y, x + y) + (x −y, x −y)

and the claim is proved.
Example 1.10 Denote by M the set of all random variables on a probability space (Ω, A, P) of ﬁnite
second moment. Deﬁne
(X, Y ) = Cov(X, Y ),
X, Y ∈M.
Does this deﬁne an inner product on M?
It is well-known that the covariance is deﬁned by
Cov(X, Y ) = E {(X −μ1) (Y −μ2)} ,
where
E{X} = μ1,
V (X) = σ2
1,
og
E{Y } = μ2,
V (Y ) = σ2
2.
We shall check if we get an inner product.
We have
(X, Y ) = Cov(X, Y ) = Cov(Y, X) = (Y, X),
and
(α X, Y ) = Cov(α X, Y ) = α Cov(X, Y ) = α (X, Y ),
and
(X + Y, Z) = Cov(X + Y, Z) = Cov(X, Z) + Cov(Y, Z) = (X, Z) + (Y, Z).
It follows from
1 = ϱ(X, X) = Cov(X, X)

for σ1 ̸= 0,
and (X, X) = σ2

1 ≥0 for every X, and that (X, X) = 0, if and only if
V (X) = σ2
1 = 0, i.e. if and only if X is causally distributed.
We conclude that (X, Y ) = Cov(X, Y ) is not an inner product in M, because we cannot distinguish
between causal distributions and O.

Example 1.12 Let T be a linear operator T : L2(R) →L2(R2) satisfying that f ≥0 implies that
Tf ≥0.
Show that
∥T(|f|)∥≥∥T(f)∥,
for all f ∈L2(R).
Show that T is bounded.
1) We ﬁrst assume that f is real. Then
|f| −f ≥0
and
|f| + f ≥0,
so
T|f| −Tf ≥0
and
T|f| + Tf ≥0
according to the assumption. We conclude that |Tf| ≤T|f| for real f ∈L2(R). This estimate
implies that

(T|f|)2dx = ∥T(|f|) ∥2

and we conclude that for every reelle f ∈L2(R),
∥Tf∥2 ≤∥T(|f|)∥2.
Then assume that f is complex, f = g +i h. This case is far more diﬃcult than one would imagine.
We present below one proof among several ones. First apply the result above on the real and the
imaginary part separately,

The trick of the present proof is that we choose constants α and β ∈R, such that 0 < α < β, and
then consider the set
Ωα,β = {x ∈R | α|f(x)| ≤|g(x)| < β|f(x)|},
where α and β are to be ﬁxed later.
If x ∈Ωα,β, it follows from the above that

and

Assume that T is not bounded. Then there exists a sequence fn ∈L2(R), where fn ≥0 and

Show that M ⊂

By the deﬁnition,

If x, y ∈M ⊥, and α is a scalar, then
(x + αy, z) = (x, z) + α(y, z) = 0 + α · 0 = 0
for every z ∈M. Then x + αy ∈M ⊥, and it follows that M ⊥is a subspace.
Let x ∈M and y ∈M ⊥. Then of course (x, y) = 0, so we conclude that

Clearly,

M ⊥⊥is a closed subspace. We shall prove that

M ⊥⊥is the smallest closed subspace

we infer that there exist a λ ̸= 0 and a sequence (xn) ⫅M, such that xn →λx. Since M was assumed

We conclude that there exists y ∈M ⊥, such that (x, y) ̸= 0. This shows precisely that x /∈

When H is inﬁnite dimensional, then there exists an orthonormal sequence (xn), thus ∥xn∥= 1, and

Example 1.17 Let H be a Hilbert space. Show that

if and only if y = αx + (1 −α)z for some α ∈[0, 1].

Figure 4: “The smallest detour”.
First assume that y = αx + (1 −α)z for some α ∈C. Then
∥x −y∥+ ∥y −z∥
=
∥x −αx −(1 −α)z∥+ ∥αx + (1 −α)z −z∥
=
∥(1 −α)(x −z)∥+ ∥α(x −z)∥= (|1 −α| + |α|)∥x −z∥.
If α ∈[0, 1], then
|1 −α| + |α| = 1 −α + α = 1,
hence the equation is fulﬁlled in this case
If α ∈C \ [0, 1], then |1 −α| + |α| > 1, and the equation is not fulﬁlled.
Then assume that y cannot be written in this way. If x = z, there is nothing to prove, because
∥x −z∥= 0, and the right hand side is > 0. Therefore, assume that x ̸= z. Then
y = α(x −z) + w,
where (w, x −z) = 0.
Using a translation we see that we can put z = 0, thus
y = αx + w,
where (w, x) = 0 and w ̸= 0.

Example 1.18 It is well-known that any continuous function deﬁned on [0, π] can be approximated
uniformly by linear combinations of cosines. Is this also true if we instead approximate with sines?
The answer is “no”, because every function sin jt has the value 0 at t = 0 and t = π, so no continuous

1. Hilbert Spaces
Example 1.21 Let S, T ∈B(H), where H is a complex Hilbert space.
Prove that if (Sx, x) = (Tx, x) for every x ∈H, then S = T.
This result is not true for real Hilbert spaces. Give an example.
We ﬁrst produce an example which shows that the claim is not true in real Hilbert spaces.
Let H =

, and let
S(x1, x2) = (−x2, x1),
denote a rotation of the angle π
2 around O, and let T = 0. Then
(S(x1, x2), (x1, x2)) = ((−x2, x1), (x1, x2)) = 0 = (T(x1, x2), (x1, x2))
for all (x1, x2) ∈R2, and it is obvious that S ̸= T.
We have in a complex Hilbertrum (cf. the polarization identity)

=
(Ty, x),
hence
(Sy −Ty, x) = ((S −T)y.x) = 0
for all x, y ∈H.
Choosing x = (S −T)y, we get ∥(S −T)x∥2 = 0, thus Sx = Tx for all x ∈H, and hence S = T.

Show that limn ξ(f + gn) = 1 if ∥f∥< λ and limn ξ(f + gn) = 0 if ∥f∥> λ.

If ∥f∥< λ, then there exists N(λ, f) ∈N, such that we for every n ≥N(λ, f) have ∥f + gn∥< 1, i.e.
ξ(f + gn) = 1
for n ≥N(λ, f),
hence
lim

If ∥f∥> λ, then we ﬁnd quite analogously N(λ, f) ∈N, such that ∥f + gn∥> 1 for all n ≥N(λ, f),
hence

normalized Legendre functions (pn), n = 0, 2, 4, . . . is an orthonormal basis for the closed subspace

(t2 −1)n
is a polynomial, which at least contains the factor t2 −1, hence the boundary values are 0.
Combining this result with Example 1.26 we obtain that the Legendre polynomials form an orthog-
onal system.
Denote by U ⫅L2([−1, 1]) the closed subspace of all even functions.
We have proved above that
&
2n + 1
2
Pn(t) is an orthonormal sequence, and since we get them from
1, t, t2, . . . by Gram-Schmidt’s orthogonalizing method, they form an orthonormal basis for all of
L2([−1, 1]).
Every function from L2([−1, 1]) can uniquely be written as a sum of an even and an odd function.
Thus the next claim will be solved if we can prove that Pn(t) is an even function, when n is even, and
an odd function for n odd.

Clearly, (t2 −1)n is always an even polynomial, no matter the choice of n ∈N0. By n diﬀerentiations
we either lower the degree of each term by n, or, the term totally disappears, because its degree is
smaller than n. Therefore, if n is even, then all terms of Pn(t) is of even degree, and if n is odd, then
all terms of Pn(t) are of odd degree, and the claim follows,
Finally, we notice that it follows from
U =

that U is closed.

Use these results to show that Hn is a solution to the Hermite diﬀerential equation:

then hn(t) · hm(t) is piecewise constant, and hn(t), n > m must be an odd function with respect
to the midpoint of {t | hn(t) · hm(t) ̸= 0}, where we ignore the values at the midpoint and at the

Using a combinatorial argument on the diﬀerentiation of the product it follows that Lm(t) is a poly-

due to the diﬀerence of magnitude.

By 2020, wind could provide one-tenth of our planet’s 
electricity needs. Already today, SKF’s innovative know-
how is crucial to running a large proportion of the 
world’s wind turbines. 
Up to 25 % of the generating costs relate to mainte-
nance. These can be reduced dramatically thanks to our 
systems for on-line condition monitoring and automatic 
lubrication. We help make it more economical to create 
cleaner, cheaper energy out of thin air. 
By sharing our experience, expertise, and creativity, 
industries can boost performance beyond expectations. 
Therefore we need the best employees who can 
meet this challenge!

Example 1.36 Prove for the n-th Chebyshev polynomial Tn(x) that the coeﬃcient of xn is 2n−1,
n ∈N.
We know that Tn(x) is a polynomial of degree n, hence it follows from the recursion formula,
Tn+1(x) = 2x Tn(x) −Tn−1(x),
n ∈N,
that the coeﬃcient of xn+1 in Tn+1(x) is equal twice the coeﬃcient of xn in Tn(x). In fact, the term
−Tn−1(x) is only of degree n −1.
It follows by induction that if the claim holds for Tn(x), then it is also true for Tn+1(x).
Clearly, the claim is true for T1 = 1 = 21−1, where n = 1, so it follows in general by induction.
Example 1.37 Prove that the n-th Chebyshev polynomial Tn(x) has its n roots lying in the interval
[−1, 1].
The polynomial Tn(x) is of degree n, so it has at most n roots in [−1, 1]. According to the Fundamental
Theorem of Algebra the polynomial has n complex roots. The problem is that some of them might
lie outside the given real interval.
In order to ﬁnd the roots we apply the deﬁnition
Tn(x) = cos(n · Arccos x).
From cos t = 0, if and only if t = π
2 + pπ, p ∈Z, we get the condition
Arccos x = π

Let Pn be a polynomial of degree n and of coeﬃcient 1 of tn. Then
Tn+1(t) = 2t Tn(t) −Tn−1(t),
n ∈N,
and T0(t) = 1, T1(t) = t.
Since Tn−1(t) only has degree n −1, it follows by induction that the
coeﬃcient of tn in Tn(t) is 2n−1. This means that
Qn−1(t) :=
1
2n−1 Tn(t) −Pn(t)
is a polynomial of at most degree n −1.
The latter claim is now proved indirectly. Thus assume that Pn(t) has been chosen, such that

Orthogonal projections and complement
Example 1.40 Let H be a Hilbert space and let P and Q denote the orthogonal projections on the
closed subspaces M and N, respectively. Show that if M ⊥N, then P +Q is the orthogonal projection
on M ⊕N.
When M ⊥N, then
M ⊕N = {z ∈H | z = x + y, x ∈M, y ∈N}.
Then
((P + Q)x, y) = (Px, y) + (Qx, y) = (x, Py) + (x, Qy) = (x, (P + Q)y)
for x, y ∈H, implies the ﬁrst condition for that P + Q is a projection.
Now, PQx = 0 for all x ∈H, because Qx ∈N ⊥M, and analogously QPx = 0, because Px ∈M ⊥
M. This shows that PQ = QP = 0. We shall apply this result by the reduction below of (P + Q)2.
In fact,
(P + Q)2 = (P + Q)(P + Q) = P 2 + PQ + QP + Q2 = P + 0 + 0 + Q = P + Q.
We have now proved that P + Q is the orthogonal projection onto the closed subspace
{z ∈H | (P + Q)z = Pz + Qz = z} = {z ∈H | z = x + y, x ∈M, y ∈N} = M ⊕N.
Example 1.41 Let P and Q denote the orthogonal projections in a Hilbert space, and assume that
PQ = QP. Show that P + Q −PQ is an orthogonal projection and ﬁnd the image of P + Q −PQ.
Using that P and Q are projections, we get
(Px, y) = (x, Py)
and
(Qx, y) = (x, Qy),
and P 2 = P and Q2 = Q. We shall prove that assuming that PQ = QP then the same conditions
hold for R = P + Q −PQ. By a computation,
(Rx, y)
=
((P + Q −PQ)x, y) = (Px, y) + (Qx, y) −(PQx, y)
=
(x, Py) + (x, Qy) −(Qx, Py) = (x, Py + Qy) −(x, QPy)
=
(x, Py + Qy) −(x, PQy) = (x, (P + Q −PQ)y) = (x, Ry),
and the ﬁrst condition is proved.
Then by another simple computation,
R2
=
(P + Q −PQ)(P + Q −PQ)
=
(P 2+PQ−P 2Q)+(QP +Q2−QPQ)+(−PQP −PQ2+PQPQ)
=
P + PQ −PQ + PQ + Q −pQ2 −P 2Q −PQ + P 2Q
=
P + PQ + Q −PQ −PQ −PQ + PQ = P + Q −PQ = R,
and we have proved that R = P + Q −PQ is a projection.

Remark 1.8 We note that
R = I −(I −P)(I −Q).
It follows from the assumption PQ = QP that also
(I −P)(I −Q) = (I −Q)(I −P).
With more theory at hand it is possible to prove that if
P(H) = M
and
Q(H) = N,
then
(I −P)(H) = M ⊥
and
(I −Q)(H) = N ⊥,
and
(I −P)(I −Q)(H) = M ⊥∩N ⊥.
Then we get
R(H) = {I −(I −P)(I −Q)}(H) =

M ⊥∩N ⊥⊥= M ⊥⊥+ N ⊥⊥= M + N,
where
M + N = {z ∈H | ∃x ∈M ∃y ∈N : z = x + y}.
Note that the splitting z = x + y is not necessarily unique. ♦
The proof of the remark above requires a little more of the reader than can be expected. Therefore,
we give below an alternative proof.
Let P(H) = M and Q(H) = N. It follows from PQ = QP that for every x ∈H,
PQx ∈M ∩N.
In fact, PQx = P(Qx) ∈M, and PQx = QPx = Q(Px) ∈N. Conversely, if x ∈M ∩N, then clearly
PQx = P(Qx)x = Px = x,
and we infer from
(PQ)2 = PQPQ = P(QP)Q = P(PQ)Q = P 2Q2 = PQ,
that when PQ = QP, then PQ is the orthogonal projection onto M ∩N.
We shall prove that the image of R = P + Q −PQ is
R(H) = M + N := {z ∈H | ∃x ∈M ∃y ∈N : z = x + y}.
Clearly, R(H) ⫅M + N. In fact, Px ∈M, Qx ∈N and PQx ∈M ∩N, from which we conclude that
Rx = Px + Qx −PQx ∈M + N.

Now, M and N are closed subspaces of the Hilbert space H, so they can also be considered as Hilbert
spaces. They both contain the closed subspace M ∩N, hence there exist a subspace M1 of M and a
subspace N1 of N, such that
M = M1 ⊕(M ∩N)
and
N = N1 ⊕(M ∩N),
and we conclude that
(9) M + N = M1 ⊕N1 ⊕(M ∩N).
Let z ∈M + N. We shall only prove that Rz = z. By (9) we can write z uniquely in the form
z = x1 + y1 + z1,
where x1 ∈M1,
y1 ∈N1,
z1 ∈M ∩N.
In particular,
x1 = Px1,
y1 = Qy1,
Pz1 = Qz1 = PQz1 = QPz1 = z1,
and we get by insertion that
Rz
=
(P + Q −PQ)(x1 + y1 + z1)
=
(Px1+Py1+Pz1)+(Qx1+Qy1+Qz1)−(PQx1+PQy1+PQz1)
=
(x1+PQy1+z1)+(QPx1+y1+z1)−(QPx1+PQy1+z1)
=
x1 + y1 + z1 = z.
We have proved that R is the orthogonal projection onto M + N.
Example 1.42 Consider C([a, b]) with the sup-norm, (here we take only real functions and consider
it as a real vector space) and consider the functionals
α(f) = max
t∈[a,b] f(t),
β(f) = min
t∈[a,b] f(t).
Are these functionals linear and/or bounded?
None of the functionals is linear. It follows from max{−f(t)} = −min f(t) that it suﬃces to consider
α(f) = max
t∈[0,1] f(t),
even in the interval [a, b] = [0, 1].
Choosing f(t) = t and g(t) = 1 −t, t ∈[0, 1] we get
α(f) = α(g) = 1.
From f + g ≡1 follows that
α(f + g) = 1 ̸= 2 = α(f) + α(g),
and we have proved that α is not linear.
We have in general
|α(f)| =
 max
t∈[a,b] f(t)
 ≤max
t∈[a,b] |f(t)| = ∥f∥∞,
and analogously for β(f). Hence, both functionals are bounded in (C([a, b]), ∥· ∥∞).

Example 1.43 Let ϕ denote a linear function on a vector space V , and assume that ker(ϕ) ̸= V .
Let x0 ∈V \ker(ϕ). Show that any vector x ∈V can be written in the form x = ax0 + y, where y ∈
ker(ϕ).
Is this expansion unique?
Analysis: If x = ax0 + y has the right form, where y ∈ker(ϕ), then
ϕ(x) = a ϕ(x0) + ϕ(y) = a ϕ(x0),
because ϕ(y) = 0 for y ∈ker(ϕ).
From x0 /∈ker(ϕ) follows that ϕ(x0) ̸= 0. Thus, the only possibility is
a = ϕ(x)
ϕ(x0).
Now let
y = x −ϕ(x)
ϕ(x0) x0.
Then
ϕ(y) = ϕ(x) −ϕ(x)
ϕ(x0) · ϕ(x0) = ϕ(x) −ϕ(x) = 0,
hence y ∈ker(ϕ).

ϕ(x0) is uniquely determined by the above, so the expansion is unique.
Example 1.44 Let ϕ and ψ denote linear functionals on a vector space V , and assume that ker(varphi) =ker(ψ).
Show that there is a constant α ∈C such that α ϕ = ψ.
If ker(ϕ) = ker(ψ) = V , then ϕ = ψ = 0, and there is nothing to prove.
Assume that ker(ϕ) = ker(ψ) ̸= V , and let x ∈V \ker(ϕ). Then ϕ(x) and ψ(x) ∈C \ {0}. Hence,
there exists ant a ∈C \ {0}, such that
a ϕ(x) = ψ(x),
for this particular x ∈V \ker(ϕ).
If y ∈V \ker(ϕ), y ̸= x, is any other element, then there exists analogously a b ∈C \ {0}, such that
b ϕ(y) = ψ(y).
The task is to prove that a = b.
Putting
α = ψ(x)
[= a ϕ(x)] ∈C \ {0}
and
β = ψ(y)
[= b ϕ(y)] ∈C \ {0},
we get
ψ(β x −α y) = β · a ϕ(x) −α · b ϕ(y) = ab · ϕ(x)ϕ(y) −ab · ϕ(x)ϕ(y) = 0,
thus β x −α y ∈ker(ψ) = ker(ϕ), where the latter follows from the assumption. This means that also
0 = ϕ(β x −α y) = b ϕ(y)ϕ(x) −a ϕ(x)ϕ(y) = (b −a)ϕ(x)ϕ(y).
From ϕ(x) ̸= 0 and ϕ(y) ̸= 0 follows that b −a = 0, hence a = b.
The claim follows from that x and y are arbitrarily chosen in V \ker(ϕ), and that there is nothing to
prove in ker(ϕ = ker(ψ).

Example 1.45 Let V denote a normed vector space with norm ∥·∥. Recall that V ⋆denotes the vector
space of bounded, linear functionals on V . On V ⋆we deﬁne the dual norm ∥ϕ∥⋆, which is just the
operator norm of ϕ as an element of B(V, C).
Let x ∈V . Show that
gx(ϕ) = ϕ(x),
ϕ ∈V ⋆,
determines an element gx ∈V ⋆⋆.
Show that the mapping x →gx is a linear and injective mapping from V to V ⋆⋆, and that ∥gx∥⋆⋆= ∥x∥.
If x →gx is also surjective, V is said to be reﬂexive.
Show that a Hilbert space is reﬂexive.
Let gx(ϕ) = ϕ(x), ϕ ∈V ⋆. We shall prove that gx is linear and bounded. It follows from the deﬁnition
of gx that
gx(ϕ + λψ) = (ϕ + λψ)(x) = ϕ(x) + λψ(x) = gx(ϕ) + λ gx(ψ),
which shows that gx is linear. Furthermore,

∥f∥⋆≤1
∥f∥⋆= ∥x∥,
hence ∥gx∥⋆⋆≤∥x∥, and gx is bounded. We have proved that gx ∈V ⋆⋆.
Then we prove that the mapping x →gx is linear: V →V ⋆⋆,
Assuming that x + λy →gx+λy, we shall prove that gx+λy = gx + λ · gy.
For every ϕ ∈V ⋆,
gx+λy(ϕ) = ϕ(x + λy) = ϕ(x) + λ ϕ(y) = gx(ϕ) + λ gy(ϕ),
and the linearity follows.
Next we prove that the mapping x →gx is injective. Therefore, let x ̸= y.
1) If x and y are linearly dependent, then there exists λ ̸= 1, such that y = λx. Choose ϕ ∈V ⋆, such
that ϕ(x) = 1. Then ϕ(y) = λ ̸= 1, and
gx(ϕ) = ϕ(x) ̸= ϕ(y) = gy(ϕ),
thus gx ̸= gy.
2) If x and y are linearly independent, we choose ϕ ∈V ⋆, such that ϕ(x) = 1 and ϕ(y) = 0. Then
gx(ϕ) = ϕ(x) = 1 ̸= 0 = ϕ(y) = gy(ϕ).
Summing up, it follows that x →gx is injective.
It only remains to prove that ∥gx∥⋆⋆= ∥x∥. According to (10) we have already proved that ∥gx∥⋆⋆≤
∥x∥. Therefore, it suﬃces to prove that we can choose ϕ ∈V ⋆, such that
∥ϕ∥⋆= 1

Remark 1.9 The codimension is 1, if dim V/U = 1, where V/U denotes the space of classes in V
modulo U, i.e. if x1, x2 ∈V/U, then x1 = x2 in V/U, if x1 + U = x2 + U, i.e. if there exists an u ∈U,
such that x1 −x2 = u ∈U. ♦
From dim V/U = 1 follows that every element y ∈V has a unique expansion in the form
y = λ x + u,
where λ ∈C
and
u ∈U.
Deﬁne ϕ ∈V ⋆by
ϕ(y) = λ ∥x∥,
i.e. ker(ϕ) = U.
Then ϕ(x) = ∥x∥, i.e. ϕ

(11) ϕ(y) = λ ∥x∥= ∥y∥·
λ ∥x∥
∥λ x + u∥.
It follows that the subspace U must be chosen, such that 0 ∈U is the closed point in U to x, because
in that case if follows from (11) that |ϕ(y)| ≤∥y∥, where we obtain equality, if y = x, and the claim
is proved.
Finally, let V = H be a Hilbert space.
According to Riesz’s Representation Theorem, every continuous linear functional ϕ on H can be
written
ϕ(x) = (x, f),
where f ∈H is uniquely determined by ϕ ∈H⋆.
This means that H⋆is mapped bijectively onto H by ϕ →f. Consequently, H and H ⋆are isomorphic,
and we identify f = ϕ, hence
ϕ(x) = (x, ϕ).
By repeating this argument we get that H⋆and H⋆⋆are isomorphic, and we may consider H⋆⋆as it
was H itself.
Finally, if g ∈H⋆⋆and ϕ ∈H⋆, then
g(ϕ) = (ϕ, g) = (g, ϕ) = ϕ(g),
hence x →gx is surjective, and every Hilbert space H is reﬂexive.

1. Hilbert Spaces
Example 1.48 Let ϕ denote a bounded, linear functional on a Hilbert space H, and assume that the
domain D(ϕ) is a proper subspace of H. Show that there is exactly one extension ϕ1 of ϕ to H with
the property that ∥ϕ1∥= ∥ϕ∥.
Since ϕ is bounded, it can by continuity be extended to the closure D(ϕ) of its domain. Hence we
may from the beginning assume that D(ϕ) is closed.
The orthogonal complement D(ϕ)⊥makes sense in the Hilbert space H, i.e. it is deﬁned. Hence, every
element z ∈H has a unique expansion of the form
z = x + y,
where
x ∈D(ϕ)
and
y ∈D(ϕ)⊥.
Therefore, any bounded extension ϕ1 of ϕ is given by
ϕ1(z) = ϕ(x) + ψ(y),
where ψ is a bounded and linear functional with D(ψ) = D(ϕ)⊥.
Both D(ψ) and D(ϕ) are closed subspaces of a Hilbert space. We may therefore consider them as
Hilbert spaces. According to Riesz’s Representation Theorem there exist f ∈D(ϕ) and g ∈D(ϕ)⊥
(hence also h ∈H), such that
ϕ(x) = (x, f) for all x ∈D(ϕ),
ψ(y) = (y, g) for all y ∈D(ϕ)⊥,
hence
ϕ1(z) = (z, h) = (x + y, h) = (x, f) + (y, g).
The spaces D(ϕ) and D(ϕ)⊥being orthogonal, it follows that
∥ϕ1∥2 = ∥h∥2 = ∥f∥2 + ∥g∥2 ≥∥f∥2 = ∥ϕ∥2,
so the equality holds, if and only if ∥g∥2 = 0, i.e. if and only if g = 0. This shows that the requirement
ϕ1∥= ∥ϕ∥uniquely ﬁxes the extension to a Hilbert space, and that
ϕ1(z) = ϕ1(x + y) = ϕ(x),
where z = x + y is the unique splitting given by x ∈D(ϕ) and y ∈D(ϕ)⊥.

x, x1, x2 ∈H and α ∈C we have
h(x1 + x2, x)
=
h(x1, x) + h(x2, x),
h(x, x1 + x2)
=
h(x, x1) + h(x, x2),
h(α x1, x2)
=
α h(x1, x2),
h(x1, α x2)
=
α h(x1, x2).
We say that h is bounded if there is a constant c ≥0 such that
|h(x1, x2)| ≤c ∥x1∥· ∥x2∥,
for all x1, x2 ∈H. The norm ∥h∥is deﬁned as the smallest possible c.
Show that there is an S ∈B(H) such that
h(x1, x2) = (Sx1, x2),
and that this representation is unique. Show also that ∥h∥= ∥S∥.
A sesquilinear form is called Hermitian if
h(x, y) = h(y, x),
for all x, y ∈H. If, moreover, h(x, x) ≥0 the form is called positive semideﬁnite.
Show that in this case we have the Schwarz’s inequality:
|h(x, y)|2 ≤h(x, x) h(y, y),
for all x, y ∈H.
For every ﬁxed x1 the mapping
x2 →h(x1, x2)
is a linear bounded functional.
Then by Riesz’s Representation Theorem there exists an element
x3 ∈H, such that
h(x1, x2) = (x2, x3),
i.e.
h(x1, x2) = (x3, x2).
Now, x3 is uniquely determined, so we can deﬁne a mapping S : H →H by Sx1 = x3, i.e.
h(x1, x2) = (x3, x2) = (Sx1, xx).
We shall prove that S is linear. It follows from the deﬁnition of a sesquilinear form that
(S(x1 + λ x2), x)
=
h(x1 + λ x2, x) = H(x1, x) + λ h(x2, x)
=
(Sx1, x) + λ (Sx2, x) = (Sx1 + λ Sx2, x).
This is true for all x, so
S(x1 + λ x2) = Sx1 + λ Sx2,

and S er lineær.
It follows from
|(Sx1, x2)| = |h(x1, x2)| ≤∥h∥· ∥x1∥· ∥x2∥,
and Sx1 ∈H for x2 = Sx1 that
∥Sx1∥2 ≤∥h∥· ∥x1∥· ∥Sx1∥,
so either ∥Sx1∥= 0 or ∥Sx1∥≤∥h∥· ∥x1∥. Now, ∥S∥is the smallest constant, for which ∥Sx1∥≤
∥S∥· ∥x1∥for all x1 ∈H. It therefore follows that ∥S∥≤∥h∥.
On the other hand,
|h(x1, x2)| = |(Sx1, x2)| ≤∥Sx1∥· ∥x2∥≤∥S∥· ∥x1∥· ∥x2∥,
and because ∥h∥is the smallest possible constant in such an estimate, we conclude that ∥h∥≤∥S∥,
hence ∥h∥= ∥S∥.
Assume that h is sesquilinear, Hermitian and positive semideﬁnite. Then
0
≤
h(x + λ y, x + λ y)
=
h(x, x) + λ h(y, x) + λ h(x, y) + |λ|2h(y, y)
=
h(x, x) + 2 Re{λ h(y, x)} + |λ|2h(y, y).
Let μ ∈R be a real constant. Then choosing
λ = ±sign(h(y, x)) · μ = ±sign(h(x, y)) · μ,
we infer from the above for every μ ∈R that
0 ≤μ2 · h(y, y) + 2μ · |h(y, x)| + h(x, x).
The right hand side is a polynomial of second degree in μ ∈R of real coeﬃcients. It then follows from
the usual condition of the discriminant that
0 ≥B2 −4AC = 4 · |h(x, y)|2 −4 · h(y, y) · h(x, x),
hence by a rearrangement
|h(x, y)|2 ≤h(x, x) · h(y, y).
Remark 1.10 The example is a natural generalization of the inner product in a Hilbert space. This
can be seen by choosing h = (·, ·). ♦

Weak convergence
Example 1.50 Let V and W be Hilbert spaces and let T ∈B(V, W). Show that the image of a weakly
convergent sequence in V is a weakly convergent sequence in W.
Let (xn) ⊂V be a weakly convergent sequence in V , thus there exists an x, such that for every y ∈V ,
(xn, y) →(x, y)
for n →+∞.
Let (xn) ⊂V and T ∈B(V, W). Then we have for the adjoint operator that T ⋆∈B(W, V ), so for
every z ∈W,
(Txn, z) = (xn, T ⋆z) →(x, T ⋆z) = (Tx, z),
and (Txn) converges weakly towards Tx in W.

Operators on Hilbert spaces, general
Example 2.1 In the Hilbert space ℓ2 we deﬁne an operator T : D(T) →ℓ2 by
T ((xn)) = (anxb) ,
where (an) is a complex sequence.
Find the maximal possible D(T) and show that T is linear.
Show that D(T) is dense in ℓ2.
Show that if (an) is bounded, then D(T) = ℓ2 and T is bounded.
It is obvious that
D(T) =

n=1
|an|2 · |xn|2 < +∞

We shall show that D(T) is a subspace. If x, y ∈D(T), then
|xn + yn|2 = |xn|2 + |yn|2 + 2|xn| · |yn| ≤2

|xn|2 + |yn|2




n=1

< +∞,
from which follows that x + y ∈D(T).
If x ∈D(T) and λ ∈C, then trivially λ x ∈D(T), and we have proved that D(T) is a subspace of ℓ2.
It is now obvious that T is linear.
Next we prove that D(T) is dense in ℓ2. Let x ∈ℓ2. Then

n=1
|xn|2 < +∞.
Hence, to every ε > 0 there is an N ∈N, such that


n=N+1
|xn|2 < ε2.
Putting xN = (x1, x2, . . . , 0, 0, . . . ), we get ∥x−xN∥2 < ε. It only remains to prove that xN ∈D(T)
for every N ∈N. This condition is the same as saying that

|an|2|xn|2 < +∞,
which clearly is fulﬁlled, because the sum only contains a ﬁnite number of terms.

Finally, assume that (an) is a bounded sequence, thus there exists an M > 0, such that |an| ≤M for
every n ∈N. Let x ∈ℓ2. Then

n=1
|an|2|xn|2 ≤M 2∥x∥2

hence
∥Tx∥2 ≤M ∥x∥2,
and we have proved that T is bounded.
Example 2.2 Consider in L2(R) the operator Q deﬁned by
Qf(x) = x f(x),
with
D(Q) =

f ∈L2(R) | Qf ∈L2(R)

.
Show that Q is linear but not bounded. Show that D(Q) is dense in L2(R).
In quantum mechanics Q is called the position operator.
Let λ ∈C and f ∈D(Q). Then trivially, λ f ∈D(Q).
If f, g ∈D(Q), then it follows from the inequality
|f(x) + g(x)|2 ≤2

2|f(x)|2 + |g(x)|2

x2|f(x)|2dx+2

x2|g(x)|2dx < +∞,
and we conclude that f + g ∈D(Q), thus D(Q) is a subspace of L2(R).
If f, g ∈L2(R) and λ ∈C, then
Q(f + λ g) = x · {f(x) + λ g(x)} = x · f(x) + λ · x · g(x) = Qf(x) + λ Qg(x),
thus
Q(f + λ g) = Qf + λ Qg,
and we have proved that Q is linear.

with
D(P) =

f ∈L2(R) | Pf ∈L2(R)

.
Show that P is linear but not bounded.
Show that D(P) is dense in L2(R).
In quantum mechanics P is called the momentum operator.
Let f ∈D(P) and λ ∈C. Then clearly, λ f ∈D(P).
If f, g ∈D(P), then f and g are diﬀerentiable almost everywhere, hence f + g is also diﬀerentiable
almost everywhere. From f ′, g′ ∈L2(R), follows that also f ′ + g′ ∈L2(R), so D(P) is a vector space.
Then clearly, Pf(x) = −i df
dx (x) is linear.
Then we shall show that P is not bounded. Let

2. Operators on Hilbert spaces
Example 2.4 Let V be a normed vector space. Show that no pair of operators S, T ∈B(V ) satisﬁes
the canonical commutator relation:
[S, T] = ST −TS = I.
Hint: Show by induction that ST n −T nS = nT n−1, n ∈N, and use this to estimate ∥S∥and ∥T∥.
Indirect proof.
Assume that S and T are two operators from B(V ), which satisfy the canonical
commutator relation
(14) ST −TS = I.
We ﬁrst prove that these assumptions imply that
ST n −T nS = nT n−1,
n ∈N.
First method. It is actually not necessary to use induction, because adding and subtracting some
suitable terms will de the job. We ﬁnd
ST n −T nS
=
ST n−TST n−1+TST n−1−T 2ST n−2+T 2ST n−2−· · ·+T n−1ST −T nS
=
{ST −TS}T n−1+T{ST −TS}T n−2+· · ·+T n−1{ST −TS}
=
IT n−1+TIT n−2+· · ·+T n−1I = nT n−1,
and the claim is proved.
Second method. Induction. The claim is trivial for n = 1.
Assume that ST n −T nX = nT n−1, thus by a rearrangement, ST n = T nS + nT n−1. Then we get
for the successor that
ST n+1 −T n+1S
=
(ST n)T −T n+1S = T nST + nT n −T n+1S
=
nT n + T n{ST −TS} = (n + 1)T n,
which is the same formula, only with n replaced by n + 1. The claim then follows by induction.
We have assumed that S, T ∈B(V ), so ∥S∥and ∥T∥< +∞. Hence it follows from the formula
nT n−1 = ST n −T nS,
n ∈N,
that
		T n−1

n ∥ST n −T nS∥≤1

		T n−1		 +
		T n−1		 · ∥T∥· ∥S∥

n ∥S∥· ∥T∥·
		T n−1		 .
This inequality implies that either
∃n ∈N :
		T n−1		 = 0,
or
∀n ∈N : ∥S∥· ∥T∥≥n

2. Operators on Hilbert spaces
Because the proof is given indirectly, we shall prove that none of these two possibilities can be
fulﬁlled.
Because we have assumed that ∥S∥· ∥T∥< +∞, the latter possibility is excluded.
Then assume that
		T n−1		 = 0 for some n ≥2. Then T n−1 = 0, which implies that
(n −1)T n−2 = ST n−1 −T n−1S = SO −OS = 0,
hence T n−2 = O. We get by recursion after a ﬁnite number of steps that T 1 = T = O, from which
follows that
I = ST −ST = O.
This relation is only satisﬁed in the not so interesting case of V = {0}.
No matter which one we choose of our two possibilities, we obtain a contradiction. Therefore, our
(indirect) assumption is wrong, and the original claim is proved.
Example 2.5 Let V be a normed space and assume that T ∈B(V ) is bijective. Show that if T −1 is
bounded, then
		T −1		 ≥∥T∥−1.
We have tacitly assumed that V ̸= {0}.
If T ∈B)(V ) is bijective, then T −1 exists and D

2. Operators on Hilbert spaces
If V is a Banach space, we prove below that also T −1 ∈B(V ). If V , however, is just a normed space,
then T −1 needs not being bounded, a statement we shall also give an example of below.
If T −1 is unbounded, then it follows from the deﬁnition of the norm that
		T −1		 = +∞, and the
inequality above is trivial. Therefore, we now assume that T −1 ∈B(V ). It follows from I = TT −1
for every x ∈V that
∥x∥= ∥Ix∥=
		TT −1x
		 ≤∥T∥·
		T −1x
		 ≤∥T∥·
		T −1		 · ∥x∥.
We have assumed that V ̸= {0}, so we conclude that
∥T∥·
		T −1		 ≥1,
and we get the wanted inequality.
If V is a Banach space, then it follows from the theorem of a bounded inverse that T −1 ∈B(V ).
If V is not a Banach space, then T −1 needs not be bounded. Let {ϕn | n ∈N} be an orthonormal
basis in a Hilbert space H, and let
V = span {ϕn | n ∈N} .
Then V is dense in H, though V itself is not complete.

Example 2.8 Let (ek) be an orthonormal basis in a Hilbert space H, and let T : D(T) →K be a
linear operator from the Hilbert space H into the Hilbert space K. Show that if ek ∈D(T) for all
k ∈N, then D(T) is dense in H.
This example is trivial. In fact, (ek) is an orthonormal basis, so the set of ﬁnite linear combinations
of (ek) is dense H, and because this set is contained in the subspace D(T), we conclude that D(T) is
also dense in H.
Example 2.9 Let [a, b] be a bounded interval. We equip the vector space C([a, b]) with the two norms
∥f∥p =

∥f∥q =
 b

where 1 ≤p < q < +∞.
Let Vp = (C([a, b]), ∥· ∥p) and V1 = (C([a, b]), ∥· ∥q). Prove that
1) the identity operator from Vq to Vp is bounded,
2) the identity operator from Vp to Vq is not bounded
Remark 2.1 If the interval [a, b] is not bounded, then one can prove that both “identity operators”
are unbounded. ♦
1) First note that
∥f∥p

|f(t)|pdt =

q1 =

Remark 2.2 By a continuous extensions we get

♦
2) In order to prove that I : Vp →Vq is not bounded we only have to choose a sequence (fn) of
functions from C([a, b]), such that (∥fn∥p) is bounded, while ∥fn∥q →+∞. Using that 1 ≤p < q,
we can choose a constant α ∈]0, 1[, such that α p < 1 < αq. Then choose

We conclude that I : Vp →Vq is unbounded.
Remark 2.3 The example shows that continuity depends essentially on the structures we give the
spaces as normed spaces. ♦
Example 2.10 Let k be a continuous function in [a, b] × [a, b], and deﬁne the operator K by
Kf(x) =
 b
a
k(x, t) f(t) dt,
f ∈C([a, b]).
Prove that Kf ∈C([a, b]) and that K is a bounded and linear operator of (C([a, b]), ∥· ∥∞) into itself.
Prove that
∥K∥≤(b −a)
max
a≤x, t≤b |k(x, t)|.
First note that if f = 0, then Kf = 0. Then let f ̸= 0, thus ∥f∥∞> 0. It follows that
Kf(x + y) −Kf(x) =
 b
a
{k(x + y, t) −k(x, y)}f(t) dt,
hence
|Kf(x + y) −Kf(x)| ≤max
t∈[a,b] |k(x + y, t) −k(x, t)| · ∥f∥∞· (b −a).
The function k is continuous in a closed and bounded, i.e. compact, domain, so k is uniformly contin-
uous. Then we can ﬁnd a δ > 0, such that
k(x, y) −k(y, u) <
ε
∥f∥∞· (b −a)
for ∥(x, y) −(y, u)∥< δ.
Therefore, if |y| < δ, then |Kf(x + y) −Kf(x)| < ε, proving that Kf ∈C([a, b]).
Clearly
K(f + λ g)(x)

k(x, t) · {f(t) + λ g(t)} dt =
 b
a
k(x, t) f(t) dt + λ
 b

where the right hand side is independent of x. Thus we conclude that
∥Kf∥∞≤(b −a) ·
max
a≤x, t≤b |k(x, t)| · ∥f∥∞,
and K is bounded. Because ∥K∥is deﬁned as the smallest possible constant in such an estimate, we
conclude that
∥K∥≤(b −a) ·
max
a≤x, t≤b |k(x, t)|.
Example 2.11 Let H denote a Hilbert space, and let T ∈B(H). Show that
∥T∥= sup{|(Tx, y)| | ∥x∥≤1, ∥y∥≤1}.
We infer from
|(Tx, y)| ≤∥Tx∥· ∥y∥≤∥T∥· ∥x∥· ∥y∥,
that
sup{|(Tx, y)| | ∥x∥≤1, ∥y∥≤1} ≤∥T∥.
If T = O, there is nothing to prove. Thus, let T ̸= O, and consider the set of x ∈H, for which Tx ̸= 0.
Putting y =
Tx
∥Tx∥we get
∥Tx∥=

Tx, Tx


≤sup{|(Tx, y)| | ∥y∥≤1},
hence
∥T∥
=
sup{∥Tx∥| ∥x∥≤1}
=
sup{|(Tx, y)| | ∥x∥≤1, ∥y∥≤1} ≤∥T∥,
and we infer that we have equality as wanted.
Example 2.12 Let (ek) be an orthonormal basis of a Hilbert space H, and let T : D(T) →H be a
closed, linear operator in H, for which ek ∈D(T) for all k ∈N.
Let x = +∞
k=1 αkek ∈H, and let xn = n
k=1 αkek, n ∈N. Prove that if (Txn) is convergent, then
x ∈D(T) and Tx = +∞

It follows from the assumptions that xn →x. Therefore, if (Txn)n = (n

we infer that x ∈D(T) and

Example 2.13 Let H denote a Hilbert space and deﬁne for a, b ∈H the mapping Ta,b : H →H by
Ta,bx = (x, b)a.
1) Show that Ta,b ∈B(H) and ﬁnd dim (Ta,b(H)) (when a, b ̸= 0) as well as the norm of Ta,b.
2) Find T ⋆
a,b.
3) Let T ∈B(H) have a one dimensional range. Show that there exist a, b ∈H such that T = Ta,b.
1) If Ta,bx = (x, b) a, then
∥Ta,bx∥= |(x, b)| ∥a∥≤∥a∥· ∥b∥· ∥x∥,
hence ∥Ta,b∥≤∥a∥· ∥b∥, and Ta,b ∈B(H).
Choose in particular x = b ̸= 0. Then
∥Ta,bx∥= ∥b∥2∥a∥= ∥a∥· ∥b∥· ∥x∥,
and we get equality in the estimate above, thus ∥Ta,b∥= ∥a∥· ∥b∥.
Finally, Ta,b(H) is generated by the vector a ̸= 0. Since also b ̸= 0, we get
dim (Ta,b(H)) = 1.
2) By a direct computation,
(Ta,bx, y) = ((x, b)a, y) = (x, b)(a, y) =
'
x, (a, y) b
(
= (x, (y, a)b),
hence
T ⋆
a,by = (y, a)b.
3) Let dim(T(H)) = 1, thus T(H) is generated by a vector a ̸= 0,
T(H) = {λa | λ ∈C},
and Tx is determined by a scalar function λ(x) by the relation
Tx = λ(x) a.
Then
λ(x) =

λ(x) a,
a
∥a∥2

=

∥a∥2 (Tx, a) =

∥a∥2 (x, T ⋆a) ,
so T = Ta,b, where a ̸= 0 generates T(H),and b is given by

for x ∈[a, b]
and

1) Show that T ∈B(H).
2) Show that T is a projection.

b −a < +∞,
thus Tf ∈H, and it follows that T ∈B(H).

Because T is linear, we conclude that T is a projection on the closed subspace

It is very natural to call (26) a non-harmonic Fourier series.
It is possible to prove (“Kadeˇc’s 1

when
|λn −n| ≤M < 1

for all n ∈Z.
The proof of this Theorem is far more diﬃcult, and Kadeˇc’s ﬁrst proof was even wrong.
Finally, it is possible to prove that there exists a sequence (λn) such that
sup

and such that the result (26) does not hold for the sequence (λn). ♦

2. Operators on Hilbert spaces
2.2
Closed operators
Example 2.16 Consider in ℓ2 the operator T, deﬁned by
T(xn) = (n xn).
Prove that T is a closed and densely deﬁned operator, and prove that
T(D(T)) = ℓ2.
We shall start by ﬁrst proving the latter claim. Then notice that
Tx = (1x1, 2x2, 3x3, · · · ) = (0, 0, 0, · · · ),
if and only if x = 0, proving that T is injective, thus the inverse T −1 exist. Then it immediately
follows that
T −1(x1, x2, x3, · · · ) =

x1, 1
2 x2, 1
3 x3, · · ·

,
hence
		T −1x
		2 =
+∞

n=1
1
n2 |xn|2 ≤
+∞

n=1
|xn|2 = ∥x∥2,
and T −1 is bounded,
		T −1		 ≤1. We even conclude from
T −1(1, 0, 0, · · · ) = (1, 0, 0, · · · ),
that
		T −1		 = 1, even if this is not essential for the example.
It is, however, very important that T −1 ∈B

ℓ2
, so T −1 is in particular a closed operator. This means
that the graph G

T −1
is a closed set. However, G(T) is obtained from G

t−1
by interchanging the
two coordinates. Hence it follows that the graph G(T) for T is also closed, and we have proved that
T is a closed operator.
Note, however, that T is an unbounded operator. We have e.g.
∥Ten∥= n
and
∥en∥= 1.
Even if the task have been totally solved above, we continue by giving a direct proof of that T is
closed.
The domain D(T) contains the subspace consisting of all sequences from ℓ2, which are 0 eventually.
The latter subspace is already dense in ℓ2, so D(T) is also dense in ℓ2.
Choose x(n) ∈D(T) such that x(n) →0 and Tx(n) →y. If we can prove that y = 0, then it follows
that T is closed.
Choose any z ∈D(T). Then x →(x, z) is continuous in ℓ2, and we infer that
'
Tx(n), z

→(y, z)

for n →∞,
because x →(x, Tz) also is continuous for every ﬁxed z ∈D(T). We conclude for every z ∈D(T)
(which we have shown above is dense in ℓ2) that
(z, y) = (y, z) = 0 = 0.
Then it follows from Riesz’s Representation Theorem that this is only possible, if y = 0.
Example 2.17 Let T be a closed linear operator T : D(T) ⊂V →V , where V is a Banach space,
and let A ∈B(V ).
Show that A + T and TA are closed, linear operators.
By the deﬁnition, T : D(T) →V is closed, if the graph
G(T) = {(x, y) ∈V × V | x ∈D(T), y = Tx}
is a closed set.
Let A ∈B(V ). We shall prove that
G(T + A) = {(x, y) ∈V × V | x ∈D(T), y = Tx + Ax}
is closed.
It suﬃces to prove that if (xn) ⫅D(T + A) and xn →x and Txn + Axn →y, then
x ∈D(T + A) and (T + A)x = y.
Let (xn) ⫅D(T + A) = D(T) and xn →x and Txn + Axn →y. Then
Txn →y −lim Axn = y −Ax.
Since T is closed. x ∈D(T), and Tx = y −Ax, hence by a rearrangement, Tx+Ax = y, and it follows
that T + A is closed.
Finally, choose a sequence (xn) ⫅D(TA), such that
xn →x
and
TAxn →y.
Then (Axn) ⫅D(T), and
Axn →Ax
and
T(Axn) →y.
Using that T is closed, we get Ax ∈D(T) and TAx = y. However, Ax ∈D(T) means that x ∈D(TA),
and we have proved that TA is closed.

2. Operators on Hilbert spaces
Example 2.18 Consider in ℓ2 the operator T deﬁned as
T(x1, x2, . . . ) = (x2, 2x3, 3x4, . . . ).
Show that T is closed, densely deﬁned operator.
Clearly, T is linear, T : D(T) →ℓ2, where D(T) ⫅ℓ2 is dense in ℓ2. (All sequences which are zero
eventually lie in D(T), and this subspace is dense in ℓ2).
Let

x(n)
⫅D(T), and assume that x(n) →x ∈ℓ2 and Tx(n) →y ∈ℓ2. If we write
x(n) = (xn
1, xn
2, xn
3, · · · )
and
y = (y1, y2, y2, · · · ),
then
y −Tx(n) = (y1 −xn
2, y2 −2xn
3, y3 −3xn
4, · · · ) →0
in ℓ2.
In particular,
xn
2 →y1,
xn

2 y2, . . . , 1

.
Because y ∈ℓ2 it is obvious that x ∈ℓ2. Finally, it is trivial that Tx = y, so x ∈D(T), and we have
proved that T is closed.
Example 2.19 Let X, Y be Banach spaces, and let
T : D(T) ⊂X →Y
be a closed linear operator. Assume that the sequences (un), (vn) ⊂D(T) satisfy the condition
lim
n un = lim
n vn.
Show that if (Tun) and (Tvn) are both convergent, then limn Tun = limn Tvn.
From the assumption that T is a closed operator and
x =
lim
n→+∞un,
un ∈D(T),
and
lim
n→+∞Tun = z,
then x ∈D(T), and Tx = z.
Similarly it follows from
x =
lim
n→+∞vn,
vn ∈D(T),
and
lim
n→+∞Tvn = q,
and from T being closed that also Tx = q. Now, x ∈D(T), and the mapping is uniquely deﬁned, so
lim
n→+∞Tun = z = q =
lim
n→+∞Tvn.

2. Operators on Hilbert spaces
Example 2.20 Let T : X →Y be a closed linear operator between two normed spaces and let A ⊂X
be compact. Show that T(A) is closed.
Let (yn) ⫅T(A), and assume that yn →y ∈Y . We shall prove that y ∈T(A).
Since yn ∈T(A), there exists at least one xn ∈A (possibly more), such that Txn = yn. Choose
for each such yn one xn ∈A of this property. Then (xn) deﬁnes a sequence on a compact set A. It
therefore contains a convergent subsequence (zn), where zn →x ∈A. We have now proved that
(zn) ⫅A ⊂D(T),
zn →x ∈A
and
Tzn →y ∈Y.
Now, T is a closed operator, so it follows that x ∈D(T) and y = Tx. Since x ∈A, we have y ∈T(A).
This proves that T(A) is closed.
Example 2.21 Let T : D(T) ⊂X →Y be a closed linear operator between two normed spaces. Show
that ker(T) is a closed subspace of X.
It is obvious that
ker(T) = {x ∈D(T) | Tx = 0}
is a subspace, so we shall only prove that it is closed.

2. Operators on Hilbert spaces
Let (xn) ⫅ker(T) be a sequence, such that xn →x ∈X. We shall prove that x ∈ker(T).
We infer from Txn = 0 →0, and T being closed that x ∈D(T) and
Tx =
lim
n→+∞Txn = 0,
thus x ∈ker(T), and the claim is proved.
Example 2.22 Let V and W be two Banach spaces (over the same scalar ﬁeld), and let T : D(T) →
W be a bounded linear operator, where D(T) is a subspace of V .
Prove that there exists precisely one bounded extension T1 of T, such that D(T1) = D(T), and prove
that ∥T∥1 = ∥T∥.
If D(T) is closed, there is of course nothing to prove.
We assume that D(T) is not closed.
Let
x ∈D(T). Then there exists a sequence (xn) ⫅D(T), such that xn →x. Because T is bounded, we
see that (Txn) is a Cauchy sequence on W. In fact,
∥Txm −Txn∥= ∥T(xm −xn)∥≤∥T∥· ∥xm −xn∥→0
for m, n →+∞.
Now, W is a Banach space, so (Txn) is convergent with some limit value, which we call w, thus
Txn →w for n →+∞.
If (yn) ⫅D(T) is another sequence, for which yn →x, then xn −yn ∈D(T), and xn −yn →x−x = 0
for n →+∞. Furthermore, T is bounded, so Txn −Tyn rightarrow0, and we get that (Txn) and
(Tyn) have the same limit value w, whenever (xn) and (yn) converge towards the same x.
Then put w = Tx, i.e.
Tx =
lim
n→+∞Tx
for x =
lim
n→+∞xn,
xn ∈D(T).
Then clearly T is an extension of T to D(T).
Then we prove that T is linear. Let x, y ∈D(T), and let (xn) and (yn) be sequences from D(t), for
which xn →x and yn →y. If α, β ∈L, then α xn + β yn ∈D(T), and
α xn + β yn →α x + β y ∈D(T).
Using the linearity of T on D(T) we get
T(α x + β y)
=
lim
n→+∞T (α xn + β yn) =
lim
n→+∞{α Txn + β Tyn}
=
α
lim
n→+∞Txn + β
lim
n→+∞Tyn = α Tx + β Ty,
and it follows that T is linear.
Finally, we shall prove that T is bounded. Let x ∈D(T), and let (xn) ⫅D(T), xn →x. Then we
have the estimates
∥Tx∥≤∥T −Txn∥+ ∥Txn∥≤∥Tx −Txn∥+ ∥T∥· ∥xn∥.
From Tx = limn→+∞Txn, follows that ∥T −Txn∥→0 and ∥xn∥→∥x∥for n →+∞. We infer that
∥Tx∥≤∥T∥· ∥x∥,

which shows that ∥T∥≤∥T∥. On the other hand, T is an extension of T, so trivially ∥T∥≥∥T∥.
Summing up, ∥T∥= ∥T∥.
If T2 : D(T) →W were another bounded extension, then T2 −T1 : D(T) →W would be a bounded
operator, and
(T2 −T1) (D(T)) = O(D(T)).
However, the only continuous extension of the zero operator on D(T) to the closure D(T) is of course
the zero operator, hence we conclude that T2 = T1. Thus the uniqueness is also proved.
