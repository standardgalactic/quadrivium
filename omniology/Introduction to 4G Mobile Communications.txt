Acknowledgments
I would like to thank my wife, Akiko, for running the household and taking 
care of our baby while I was up in our attic room writing this book. For 
many months she usually met me only when I climbed down, looking for a 
meal in our kitchen. And baby Koyuki, who from now on can spend much 
more time playing with daddy.
I would also like to thank my colleagues at ETSI and especially the 
people on the 3GPP project team. They have been very supportive of my 
book-writing project. Moreover my manager, Mr. John Meredith, is a walk-
ing data bank on all matters 4G, which is a very useful feature in one’s 
manager.
Within Artech House, I would especially like to thank Ms. Aileen 
Storry. She has had to endure a lot with me and my slipping deadlines.

Chapter 1
Introduction
Long-term evolution (LTE) was originally only an internal 3GPP name for 
a program to enhance the capabilities of 3G radio access networks. This pro-
gram was initiated already in 2004. The name was never meant to become 
the official name for the new 4G mobile communications system. However, 
the name stuck, and its use has spread from the engineering community to 
general public. LTE has become synonymous with 4G.
At the same time with LTE development, 3GPP was also working with 
another evolutionary project known as system architecture evolution (SAE), 
which produced the specifications for the evolved packet core (EPC) net-
work. SAE or EPC have not become as well-known buzzwords as LTE. 
However, a LTE access network could not work properly without an EPC 
core network supporting it, and therefore EPC is also discussed in this book 
extensively.
This book is about LTE-advanced (LTE-A), an enhanced version of 
LTE. LTE-A fulfills the requirements set by the International Telecommu-
nications Union (ITU) for a 4G mobile communications system. Currently 
there is no plan to replace this name with a catchier marketing name, so it 
seems that the new LTE-A system will be there for good. However, it seems 
that quite often the general public simply uses the term LTE without any 
distinction between LTE and LTE-A.
The first LTE specifications were published in December 2008, in a 
specifications release known as 3GPP Release 8. The first LTE-A specifica-
tions followed in 3GPP Release 10, which was published in mid-2011. At 
the time of this writing in late 2013, 3GPP is working with Release 12, to 
be published in late 2014. 3GPP standardization is a continuous process; 
new features are added in every release and older features are improved. 
Therefore it is fair to say that 3GPP specifications are never ready—they are 
constantly evolving.
This book provides an introduction to the world of LTE-A. It is only 
an introduction—it does not explain every detail in LTE-A, and in any 
case that would be impossible. 3GPP standards contain hundreds of speci-
fications, which jointly have probably tens of thousands of pages in them. 
This also means that it would be very difficult to study a given feature just 
by reading the specifications. Even finding the correct specifications that 
handle a given feature is a major achievement for a new LTE student. More-
over, 3GPP standards are written by a group of specialist engineers to other 
specialist engineers. The contents can be very cryptic for nonspecialists.

Introduction
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Typically a standard does not explain, it just sets the rules and requirements. 
The user of those standards has to have deep understanding of the issues on 
hand already; otherwise, the text in standards is incomprehensible.
This book explains the LTE basics in plain English, oftentimes with a 
few examples, pointing out how various issues are interconnected, and then 
refers to further sources of information for those who want to learn more 
about a specific subject.
History of mobile telecommunications is discussed in Chapter 2. It 
is important to know the past because it helps us to understand the pres-
ent. How have we ended up with the systems we have today? This chap-
ter discusses the development of mobile telecommunications generation 
by generation. It shows how we have arrived in a situation where we have 
only one serious competitor in the fourth generation, whereas in the first 
generation many countries had (at least) one national system of their own.
Chapter 3 presents the overview of a modern 4G telecommunications 
system; that is, an LTE-A system. First, the LTE system is compared to 3G-
UMTS: what are the changes and why are they needed. When the LTE 
project was launched, a list of high-level requirements was presented for 
the system to be designed. These requirements are listed in Chapter 3, and 
then they are discussed one by one: can the LTE system fulfill the require-
ments and how does it do it? The same treatment is given for the LTE-A: 
its requirements are listed, and then the performance of the new system is 
analyzed against them. In the end of the chapter the most important new 
LTE-A features are presented briefly. Note that Chapter 11 will analyze 
some of these features in depth.
LTE and LTE-A have adopted a new air interface technology called 
ODFMA. In Chapter 4, the new air interface is compared to the old one 
used in 3G. Why was WCDMA not suitable for 4G anymore, and why can 
OFDMA supposedly fulfill the requirements better? OFDMA basics are 
discussed, as are the reasons LTE air interface employs different uplink and 
downlink technologies.
Chapter 5 concentrates on the air interface physical layer. This chapter 
is a continuation of Chapter 4. Whereas Chapter 4 discussed OFDMA tech-
nology, Chapter 5 concentrates on other aspects of the physical layer. The 
downlink data path through the physical layer is described, and the physical 
layer functionality along that path is discussed in detail. Also, physical chan-
nels and physical layer signals are explained.
Chapter 6 is a sizeable chapter because it presents the air interface pro-
tocol stack. MAC, RLC, PDCP, and RRC layers are handled here. Each of 
them is discussed in its own section. The most important functions from 
each layer are explained. Transport and logical channels are also introduced 
and discussed.
Chapter 7 is about the radio access network. In LTE the radio ac-
cess network is called E-UTRAN (as in evolved UTRAN). In fact, the

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
E-UTRAN is very different from the UTRAN in 3G. The E-UTRAN 
has no radio network controllers. The only node type it has is called eNo-
deBs, which stands for evolved NodeB. The eNodeB is a combined base 
station and base station controller. This has resulted in some fundamental 
changes in how the radio access network operates and especially in how it is 
managed. There is, for example, a new direct logical interface, X2, between 
the base stations. The E-UTRAN also includes home eNodeBs and relay 
nodes, which are discussed in this chapter.
Chapter 8 handles the core network, or evolved packet code (EPC) in 
3GPP jargon. Even though its name seems to suggest that it is somehow just 
an enhanced version of the UMTS core network, the EPC is very differ-
ent from its predecessor. Partly this stems from the fact that the UMTS had 
both circuit-switched and packet-switched domains, whereas the EPC has 
only a packed-switched domain. This chapter is divided in two parts. In the 
first part, EPC architecture is presented and its entities and their functions 
are discussed one by one. The second part concentrates on EPC interfaces 
and the protocol stacks in them.
Chapter 9 includes procedure descriptions. The most important proce-
dures in the LTE/EPC system are described in detail, with the help of dia-
grams and figures. In earlier chapters, the system functionality was discussed 
layer by layer or entity by entity. This may have left some questions on how 
everything fits together. This chapter shows how various entities cooperate 
to provide services.
Chapter 10 discusses 3GPP standardization. For those readers who want 
to gain in-depth knowledge on a particular topic, the 3GPP specifications 
provide the ultimate source of information. However, it is not easy to find 
what you want to find from those publications. Therefore this chapter first 
explains the structure of 3GPP, its working practices, its release regime, 
how specifications are modified, and what is inside each specifications se-
ries. When the reader is equipped with all this information, he may have a 
chance to find something from the specifications.
LTE-A is an evolution of LTE, with a set of new features and improved 
performance. Chapter 11 discusses a selection of new LTE-A features. The 
list is not complete—it cannot be since there are so many new features in 
LTE-A. However, the author believes he has selected the most important 
and interesting new features for this chapter.
Finally, Chapter 12 contains some crystal-ball gazing. We try to have a 
peek into the future and guess what is going to happen in mobile telecom-
munications in the latter part of this decade.

Chapter 2
History of Mobile 
Telecommunications
2.1  First Generation
2.1.1  Introduction
Mobile telecommunications actually has quite a long history already. The 
first generation cellular systems were launched around 1980, but it must 
be noted that there were already mobile phones in existence long before 
that. The first mobile phone systems were launched soon after the Second 
World War, first in the United States and thereafter in various European 
countries. But these were radio telephones, not cellular systems (see Figure 
2.1). They did not support concepts such as handovers or roaming. The call 
was only maintained as long as the phone remained within the coverage 
area of the transmitting tower. The number of simultaneous calls the system 
could handle was very small because each call required a separate frequency 
channel. Mobile phones were large, and typically they were installed in cars. 
The weight and size of these devices did not enable handheld usage. In some 
sources, these systems are known as generation zero.
The first generation cellular systems were analog systems (for voice 
channels, that is; control channels were already digital in most systems). 
Each frequency carrier could carry only one call. Obviously, as a result, 
the capacity of such systems was small. However, it was much better than 
in radio telephone systems because the cellular concept enabled frequency 
reuse. The cellular approach also provided an easy way to increase capacity 
where it was needed. In the countryside, the cells could be larger, providing 
wide coverage but lower system capacity, whereas in cities, the cells would 
be smaller, greater in number, and provide more capacity. Being cellular 
systems (see Figure 2.2), these networks also supported handovers. The user 
could move from one base station area to another, and the ongoing call was 
maintained.
First generation networks were typically only countrywide. The tech-
nology was distinct in different countries, and thus roaming to other net-
works was not supported except in some special cases such as in NMT

systems in Northern Europe. The list of first generation technologies and 
the countries that adopted them are given in Table 2.1 (note that this list is 
not exhaustive).
2.1.2  AMPS
Advanced mobile phone service (AMPS) was a US-developed (by Bell 
Labs) standard, operating in the 850-MHz band. It was also widely used in 
several countries in Asia and South America. The first commercial AMPS 
network was launched in 1983 in the US. The AMPS system employs full 
duplex channels with a 45-MHz channel separation. Individual channels 
are 30 kHz each. This is an all-analog system (i.e., both control and traffic 
channels are analog).
Narrowband advanced mobile phone service (NAMPS) was an analog 
cellular system that was introduced by Motorola in late 1991 and thereafter 
deployed in several countries. NAMPS used narrow 10-kHz bandwidth

radio channels, which is one-third of the AMPS channel bandwidth. As a 
result, the system capacity was increased.
2.1.3  TACS
Total access communication system (TACS) was a UK-based standard, al-
though its roots lie in AMPS. TACS operated on the 900-MHz band, and 
it was used mainly in the UK and in Ireland. The first TACS network was 
launched in 1985. TACS system was deployed on 25-kHz radio channels, 
which were narrower than the 30-kHz channels used in AMPS. Extended 
TACS (ETACS) was an extended version of TACS, providing more fre-
quency channels.
2.1.4  NMT
Nordic mobile telephone (NMT) was different from other 1G systems in 
that it was specified jointly by Nordic telecommunication authorities, and 
thus it supported roaming between different operators from the beginning. 
And because the specifications were open, it enabled several companies to 
manufacture NMT handware and compete in the marketplace. NMT came 
in two variants, NMT-450 and NMT-900. The numbers indicate the oper-
ating frequency in megahertz. The first NMT-450 networks were launched 
in 1981, and NMT-900 followed in 1986.

History of Mobile Telecommunications
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
NMT became very popular and was adopted in a large number of 
countries, even outside the Nordic region. The reasons for this were that the 
system was technically quite advanced, and it was based on an open standard 
that enabled lower cost for equipments. NMT-450, with its lower frequency 
band and higher maximum transmit power, could provide large coverage 
(up to 40-km radius), whereas NMT-900 was more suited for areas that 
required higher system capacity. In both systems, the channel bandwidth 
was 25 kHz.
2.1.5  C-NETZ
C-Netz was a German-developed 1G standard, replacing the earlier B-Netz 
radio telephony network. C-Netz operated on the 450-MHz band, and its 
channel bandwidth was 20 kHz. It did not support roaming, and indeed 
there would have been little use for that functionality since the only other 
countries adopting C-Netz were Portugal and South Africa. The first C-
Netz system became operational in Germany in 1985.
2.1.6  Radiocom2000
Radiocom2000 was a French system developed by Matra. It was launched in 
1986 and operated on the 400-MHz band. Two years later, an NMT-based 
network was also launched in France.
2.1.7  Japanese Systems
Japan deserves a special mention because in mobile communications it has 
always been among early adopters. NTT DoCoMo launched its MCS-L1 
(mobile cellular system) network in 1979 [1]. This system was based on 
AMPS technology, which was then yet to be launched in the United States. 
It operated on the 800-MHz band. In 1988 an improved MCS-L2 system 
was launched, operating on the same frequency channels. In some sources 
MCS-L2 is also known as Hi-Cap. MCS-L2 improvements include halv-
ing the radio channel bandwidth, from 25 kHz to 12.5 kHz, and diversity 
reception in mobile handsets. Because NTT DoCoMo’s mobile services 
became very successful, competing operators started similar services using 
Japanese Total Access Communication System (JTACS) technology in 1989. 
JTACS was based on TACS (and therefore also AMPS). JTACS was swiftly 
improved in narrowband TACS (NTACS) in 1991. NTACS, like MCS-L2 
before it, employed 12.5-kHz channels, therefore increasing the system ca-
pacity considerably.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
2.1.8  Summary
Many of these systems continued to operate until after 2000 but were then 
gradually closed, and the frequencies were reused for 2G/3G systems. The 
main problem with these systems was that they were not designed for mass 
markets. The system designers did not anticipate that mobile phone penetra-
tion could raise to 100 percent or over as it is today. Rather, it was thought 
that these devices would only be used by special groups who travel often 
and need to communicate a lot, such as marketing people and senior manag-
ers. When more and more customers started to use the networks, the capac-
ity simply ran out. There were also other problems, such as security. In many 
of these systems the security issue was not very well designed. Calls could 
be eavesdropped, and in many cases it was also possible to steal the identity 
of the phone, clone it, and thereafter make calls for free.
2.2  Second Generation
2.2.1  Introduction
The second generation was the first one to employ all-digital transmis-
sion technology, both for signaling and traffic. This greatly enhanced the 
capacity of systems and quality of services. In first generation systems, one 
call required one frequency channel (in full-duplex systems this was actu-
ally two frequencies; one for the uplink and one for the downlink), but 
in second generation systems one frequency channel was divided between 
several users by means of time-division or code-division techniques, which 
resulted in increased system capacity. There were also many other improve-
ments in 2G that increased the system capacity even further. It is good to 
note that the development of a major mobile communications standard is 
a continuous process. New releases of specifications are published regularly, 
with improvements to networks, services, and mobile handsets. Especially in 
case of GSM, this continuous development process has lasted more than 20 
years by now. The latest Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE)-
enhanced GSM systems are completely different from those GSM networks 
that were launched in early 1990s. However, at some point it may become 
obvious that the basic platform has become too old and cannot easily be 
improved further, in which case a new system will be designed, with a 
new generation “tag.” Many 2G technologies have already been abandoned, 
and there is less and less development work being done with EDGE. It is 
foreseen that soon, maybe in 1–2 years, GSM and EDGE will no longer be 
improved further. Operational GSM/EDGE networks will be here for many 
years to come though.

History of Mobile Telecommunications
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
There were several attempts to draft standards for digital mobile com-
munication systems. Not all proposals survived. There are four main 2G 
systems that have been in widespread use:
•• GSM (originally Groupe Special Mobile, later Global System for Mo-
bile communications);
•• Digital advanced mobile phone system (D-AMPS);
•• Code division multiple access (CDMA);
•• Personal digital cellular (PDC).
Moreover, integrated dispatch enchanced network (iDEN) networks 
have been launched in several countries, although its subscriber numbers 
are clearly smaller than with the systems listed here.
2.2.2  Global System for Mobile Communication (GSM)
GSM [2] was designed to be the pan-European standard, but later it became 
very popular and has spread all over the world, with the most notable excep-
tion being Japan. The original GSM was using the 900-MHz band because 
that was the band allocated for the pan-European system. However, later on 
more bands were allocated for GSM: 850 and 1900 MHz in Americas, and 
1800 MHz in Europe, and existing bands were extended. GSM was also 
specified for 450 MHz (GSM-450), to replace NMT-450 networks, but this 
system has not seen commercial deployments. The first GSM network was 
launched in 1991 in Finland.
GSM is a time division multiple access (TDMA) system. In TDMA each 
frequency carrier is divided into timeslots that are allocated for different us-
ers dynamically (see Figure 2.3). In basic GSM there are eight timeslots in a 
frame (i.e., eight users can have simultaneous calls on the same frequency). 
In its simplest form, a GSM phone will transmit on only one timeslot and

receive on one (but it does not have to do these things simultaneously since 
the uplink is delayed by three timeslots when compared to the downlink). 
That leaves six timeslots when the phone can measure its radio environ-
ment or stay idle and save power. The GSM channel bandwidth is 200 kHz.
2.2.2.1  Circuit Switched Data (CSD)
As pointed out earlier, GSM has undergone continuous development and 
new improvements are still being introduced into the standard. The most 
notable enhancements of GSM were the faster data services. In the begin-
ning GSM supported mainly voice, and its data services were primitive. The 
first GSM data service, circuit switched data (CSD), provided only a 9.6-
Kbps connection. This was enhanced with the high speed circuit switched 
data (HSCSD) service to 14.4 Kbps per timeslot, and HSCSD was also able 
to use up to four timeslots per frame, giving the maximum data rate of 57.6 
Kbps. The problem with these services was that the timeslot(s) employed 
were allocated for a user for the whole duration of the call. For many ap-
plications the data transmission requirements are not static but highly vari-
able. Therefore circuit switched data services are likely to waste capacity and 
are therefore expensive to use. However, they do offer low latency, which 
is important for some applications, and the data rate is guaranteed. Also, for 
operators the HSCSD update was a rather easy step to take since it did not 
require large investments in hardware.
2.2.2.2  General Packet Radio Service (GPRS)
The next data service to be introduced was GPRS. This packet switched 
service was fundamentally different from the earlier circuit switched service. 
In GPRS the timeslots were allocated for the data service only when there 
was data to send or receive. Thus, the service could adapt to highly variable 
data transmission needs. However, this flexibility did not come cheap for 
network operators. To support GPRS, the core network required a major 
upgrade with a set of new components and modifications to existing ones. 
However, GPRS was seen as a necessary step for operators to take in their 
development path. Without GPRS, a 2G operator would not have survived 
for long because it could not have provided data services effectively.
The maximum data rate in early GPRS systems was 40 Kbps, but in 
later releases this was increased to 171 Kbps. The maximum rate will require 
all timeslots in a frame to be assigned to a single user, but this is still not as 
bad a situation as a four-slot HSCSD, because GPRS does not reserve these 
slots permanently. They are only used when there is data to be sent. If there 
is no data to be sent, those slots can be allocated to some other users. This 
re-allocation can be done on a frame-by-frame basis. The drawback of this 
arrangement is that there will be more latency because mobile devices must 

12 
 
History of Mobile Telecommunications
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
first get a permission to transmit from the data scheduler in the network. 
Moreover, this latency does not have a guaranteed upper limit, though the 
operator can implement a quality of service (QoS) scheme in order to try 
to limit the delays. Therefore, the basic GPRS is not suitable for interactive 
services that require guaranteed low latency, but it is better with noninter-
active services such as email, streaming audio/video, and ftp. It is also suited 
for web browsing since even though browsing is an interactive process, the 
delay requirements are not very strict.
The first operational GPRS networks were launched in 2001.
2.2.2.3  Enhanced Data rates for Global Evolution (EDGE)
The next improvement to GSM was EDGE. The idea behind EDGE is 
a new modulation scheme called eight-phase shift keying (8PSK). It in-
creases the data rates of standard GSM by up to threefold. This modulation 
scheme does not replace the old Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) 
modulation but rather coexists with it. 8PSK can only be used effectively 
in good radio conditions over short distances and/or higher transmission 
power, and thus GMSK is needed for weaker radio conditions. The first 
version of EDGE provided maximum data rate of 384 Kbps, but this has 
then increased to 1.3 Mbps (downlink) and 653 Kbps (uplink) with EDGE 
Evolution. To achieve this kind of performance, EDGE Evolution employs 
techniques such as:
•• Higher order modulation: the basic EDGE employ 8PSK in addition 
to GMSK, but EDGE evolution has also 16QAM and 32QAM (QAM 
= Quadrature Amplitude Modulation) in its toolbox. Whereas GMSK 
carries 1 bit per symbol, and 8PSK 3 bits per symbol, in 16QAM and 
32QAM these numbers are 4 and 5, respectively. However, 16QAM and 
32QAM can only be used in very good radio conditions.
•• Receiver diversity: as is well known, the receiver diversity improves the 
quality of the reception.
•• Parallel data channels: EDGE evolution can make use of two parallel 
data channels.
•• Simultaneous transmission and reception: standard GSM/EDGE hand-
sets have only one combined transmitter/receiver chain in order to 
save costs. However, EDGE evolution proposes handsets with indepen-
dent transmission/reception parts, so it would be possible to use up to 
eight timeslots per frame (i.e., the whole frame) for transmission and 
reception.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
However, it is good to point out that even though EDGE evolution can 
potentially provide performance comparable to 3G, it has not been taken up 
very well by operators. Even though the actual evolved EDGE upgrade to 
networks is a relatively simple process for operators, the operators also want 
to see evolved EDGE–capable handsets in the market that can use those 
services before they commit to this upgrade. And handset manufacturers do 
not want to manufacture evolved EDGE handsets before there is a market 
for those handsets. In all, there is a feeling that GSM upgrades are coming 
to a close and evolved EDGE could provide only a temporary solution be-
fore the operator would need to upgrade its network to UMTS/LTE. Also, 
it is good to note that even though evolved EDGE looks good on paper 
performancewise, most of this gain is achieved by using more spectrum re-
sources (i.e., parallel data channels and simultaneous Tx/Rx). Higher order 
modulation is an improvement that cannot always be used. In weak radio 
conditions, it may actually make things worse and result in reduced data 
throughput.
When it comes to the “generation game,” then GPRS is regarded as 
2.5G and EDGE is 2.75G. 
2.2.3  Digital Advanced Mobile Phone System (D-AMPS)
D-AMPS is another popular 2G system that is known by several other names 
too: North American TDMA, North American digital cellular (NADC), 
US-TDMA, IS-54, IS-136, or simply TDMA. Therefore D-AMPS is a bit 
vague since it could refer to either IS-54 or IS-136, which are quite different 
systems, with IS-136 being the successor of IS-54.
IS-54 is a digital extension of the first generation AMPS system. It is 
backwards compatible with it in the sense that both systems use the same 
analog control channel structure and the same channel bandwidth (30 kHz). 
That is, IS-54 is only half digital in the sense that its control channels are 
analog. This provided a smooth path for AMPS operators to upgrade their 
systems to digital. IS-54 divided a traffic channel into three timeslots (full 
rate), or six timeslots (half rate).
However, IS-54 soon ran out of capacity, and an upgrade was needed. 
The result, IS-136, was an all-digital system (both control and voice chan-
nels), which was also incorporated the functionality of the IS-54 standard 
(see Figure 2.4). Therefore it was possible to use AMPS and IS-54–capable 
phones in an IS-136 network. IS-136 also introduced new features such as 
text messaging, CSD, sleep mode, picocells, and improved security. All IS-
136 channel frames were divided into six timeslots.
The IS-54 system was operational in 1990, and IS-136 followed in 
1994. The operating frequency for IS-54 was the same as for AMPS (i.e., 
850 MHz). IS-136 could also operate on the 1900-MHz band. Note that 

14 
 
History of Mobile Telecommunications
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
since 1900 MHz was an IS-136 specific band, it did not need to support 
analog AMPS phones (i.e., the 1900 MHz band was all digital).
D-AMPS was also enhanced with a cellular digital packet data (CDPD) 
specification in 1993. The maximum data rate provided was 19.2 Kbps. 
Even though this feature was deployed in some D-AMPS networks in the 
United States, it did not receive much enthusiasm from consumers. It was, 
however, used to provide some special services such as machine-to-machine 
communications (M2M) and public safety services. The last CDPD net-
works were finally shut down in 2005.
2.2.4  Code Division Multiple Access (IS-95 CDMA)
Code division multiple access (CDMA) standard IS-95 was developed by 
Qualcomm in the late 1980s. IS-95 was different from other commercially 
deployed 2G systems in that IS-95 was based on CDMA technology, with 
the others being TDMA systems. Whereas in TDMA the radio channel is di-
vided into timeslots that are then allocated to different users, in CDMA the 
radio channel is divided into code channels by means of different spreading 
codes (see Figure 2.5). That is, in CDMA the transmissions to each user are 
continuous.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
CDMA has also some other properties that make it different from other 
2G technologies. The same frequency carrier may be used in adjacent cells, 
which means no frequency planning is needed (though a different planning 
exercise, namely code planning, is required). CDMA also enables soft han-
dovers (i.e., at cell edges the mobile device can be connected to more than 
one base station simultaneously, improving the call quality). The IS-95 radio 
channel bandwidth is 1.25 MHz.
CDMA as a technology has become exceptionally popular since it is 
was also adopted by UMTS later (though not in the form that was initially 
promoted by Qualcomm). 
IS-95 was also known as cdmaOne; with IS-95 being the standard 
name and cdmaOne the brand name given to it by the CDMA Develop-
ment Group (CDG). IS-95 became popular in North America and some 
parts of Asia. However, it could not compete with GSM when it comes to 
European markets. The first commercial IS-95 network was launched in 
1995 in Hong Kong. Thereafter IS-95 got two major revisions: IS-95A and 
IS-95B. Further revisions (e.g., 1xRTT) are regarded as 3G systems already.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
2.2.5  Personal Digital Cellular (PDC)
PDC is the Japanese 2G standard. Originally it was known as Japanese Digi-
tal Cellular (JDC), but the name was changed to Personal Digital Cellular 
to make the system more attractive outside Japan. However, this renaming 
did not bring about the desired result, and the PDC standard was used only 
in Japan. Though it is good to point out that CDMA (IS-95) was also ad-
opted by some operators in Japan. The air interface specification is known 
as RCR-27, and the system operated on two frequency bands: 800 MHz 
and 1500 MHz. PDC had both analog and digital modes; the analog mode 
was for backwards compatibility to older first generation networks in Japan. 
The PDC system employs TDMA technology. Its physical layer parameters 
are quite similar to D-AMPS, but its protocol stack resembles GSM. It uses 
25-kHz carriers, and each frame is divided into three or six timeslots.
NTT DoCoMo was the first operator to launch PDC in 1993. It be-
came an extremely popular service, with more than 80 million subscribers 
at its peak (in a country of about 127 million people). Also PDC evolved to-
ward faster data connections. NTT DoCoMo developed a proprietary data 
service called i-mode. It employed a packet data network (PDC-P) behind 
the PDC radio interface. The popularity of mobile services in Japan also 
meant that Japan was very eager to design and adopt a 3G system as early 
as possible, before their 2G systems ran out of capacity. As a result, NTT 
DoCoMo became the leading promoter of WCDMA technology.
Once 3G networks became available in Japan, PDC subscriber numbers 
started to diminish, and the networks were closed one by one. The last PDC 
network was closed by NTT DoCoMo in 2012.
2.2.6  Integrated Dispatch Enhanced Network (iDEN)
Integrated dispatch enhanced network (iDEN) is a mobile telecommunica-
tion system that includes features from both cellular systems and trunked 
radio systems. iDEN was developed by Motorola, and it provides voice, data, 
and push-to-talk services. It was first deployed in 1996 by Nextel. The radio 
channel bandwidth is 25 kHz, and TDMA frames are divided into six time 
slots per frame. The operating frequencies are on 800-MHz and 900-MHz 
bands.
iDEN users are typically governmental organizations and large compa-
nies. The operators can be “normal” telecom operators or small private ser-
vice providers. iDEN has a lots of users, especially in Central and Southern 
America. However, the number of iDEN users is already declining, and, for 
example, in the United States the old Nextel iDEN network was closed by 
its new owner Sprint Nextel in 2013.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
2.2.7  Terrestrial Trunked Radio (TETRA)
TETRA’s usage areas are similar to iDEN. TETRA has been designed for 
governmental agencies, military, emergency services and transport services 
to provide closed group communication services in addition to normal cel-
lular services. The first version of TETRA was published in 1995 by Eu-
ropean Telecommunications Standards Institute (ETSI), and the second 
version, TETRA 2, in 2005. In addition to normal cellular services, TETRA 
offers also push-to-talk services. Its operating frequencies are typically quite 
low, around 400 MHz, depending on a particular country, and thus it can 
operate on much larger cells than GSM/UMTS/LTE networks. The chan-
nel bandwidth in TETRA 1 is 25 kHz, and the TDMA frame is divided into 
four timeslots. The problem with TETRA has been that its data transmis-
sion capabilities were rather slow, especially if compared to “public” cellular 
networks. This issue will partly be solved by TETRA 2 standard once those 
networks are deployed. However, given the rapid development of cellular 
standards and capabilities, it is likely that TETRA will always lag behind 
other cellular technologies when it comes to data transmission capabilities.
TETRA is currently widely deployed (almost) all over the world. In the 
United States, the use of TETRA was not authorized before, but FCC al-
lowed the use of TETRA on non–public safety bands in 2012. The reason-
ing for not allowing TETRA for public safety bands were interoperability 
problems and potential interference caused by TETRA.
2.3  Third Generation
2.3.1  Introduction
The extraordinary success of 2G mobile communication networks with 
ever increasing subscriber numbers made it obvious for mobile network op-
erators that new capacity was needed, and it was needed quickly. The design 
work for third generation systems had already started about the same time 
as the first second generation systems were deployed.
In Japan the PDC network was quickly running out of capacity, and 
NTT DoCoMo wanted to push forward with 3G faster than other industry 
members. NTT DoCoMo’s technology of choice was WCDMA. In Eu-
rope there were support for both TDMA- and CDMA-based solutions, but 
NTT DoCoMo’s example probably tipped the scale in favour of CDMA 
(i.e., WCDMA). In the United States, there were two popular 2G systems, 
D-AMPS and IS-95. D-AMPS supporters formed a consortium called 
Universal Wireless Communication Consortium (UWCC) to promote a 
TDMA-based solution by enhancing the existing IS-136 standard. The new 
standard was known as UWC-136. Similarly, IS-95 supporters grouped to-
gether to promote an IS-95-based solution that was called CDMA2000.

History of Mobile Telecommunications
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Lots of research both in the industry and in the academia was carried 
out for various technologies. As seen, the promoters of the most widely de-
ployed 2G technologies had different ideas on how to proceed. The Inter-
national Telecommunication Union (ITU) might have preferred to select 
only one 3G technology, but from early on it was clear that this was not go-
ing to happen, for both technical and political reasons. Instead ITU drafted 
IMT-2000, the umbrella specification of all 3G systems.
In its November 1999 meeting Helsinki, the ITU accepted the follow-
ing proposals as IMT-2000 compatible:
•• IMT direct spread (IMT-DS; also known as UTRA FDD);
•• IMT multicarrier (IMT-MC; also known as CDMA2000);
•• IMT time code (IMT-TC; also known as UTRA TDD);
•• IMT single carrier (IMT-SC; also known as UWC-136);
•• IMT frequency time (IMT-FT; also known as DECT).
However, in the end only three of these proposals survived and were 
developed further under two consortia; 3GPP and 3GPP2. UTRA FDD 
and UTRA TDD were developed by the Third Generation Partnership 
Project (3GPP). This technology was commonly known also as wideband 
code division multiple access (WCDMA), or universal mobile telecom-
munications system (UMTS). CDMA2000 was progressed further by an-
other industry consortium, 3GPP2. IMT-SC was originally supported by 
UWCC, but later this organization decided to adopt UTRA FDD as its 
3G technology. UWCC disbanded itself and in 2002 a new organization, 
3G Americas, was formed to promote WCDMA systems in the Americas. 
When it comes to the DECT-based 3G system, it never took off and that 
initiative was abandoned.
2.3.2  3GPP
2.3.2.1  Introduction
The 3GPP is an organization that developed specifications for a 3G system 
based on the UTRA radio interface and on the enhanced GSM core net-
work. 3GPP is also responsible for the future GSM development work. Note 
that since then 3GPP has also taken over the 4G (LTE) standards develop-
ment work. That is, currently 3GPP is doing standards development for 
three mobile communications generations; 2G, 3G, and 4G. The participants 
in 3GPP are mainly from the telecommunications industry: equipment ven-
dors, network operators, regulators, academia, and other research establish-
ments. The membership is arranged around organizational partners: the

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Association of Radio Industries and Businesses (ARIB), Japan; the Alliance 
for Telecommunications Industry Solutions (ATIS), United States; China 
Communications Standards Association (CCSA); the European Telecom-
munications Standards Institute (ETSI); Telecommunications Technology 
Association (TTA), Korea; and Telecommunication Technology Committee 
(TTC), Japan. A company can apply 3GPP membership by first becoming a 
member of one of the organizational partners.
2.3.2.2  UMTS
The air interface technology developed by 3GPP is called wideband code 
division multiple access (WCDMA) [3]. This system is also known as the 
universal mobile telecommunications system (UMTS). It has two modes: 
frequency division duplex (FDD) and time division duplex (TDD). In the 
FDD mode, the uplink and downlink use separate frequency bands. In the 
first version of the standard the WCDMA carriers had a 5-MHz bandwidth, 
although in later versions also other bandwidths were specified. Each carrier 
is divided into 10-ms radio frames, and each frame further into 15 timeslots. 
The UTRAN chip rate is 3.84 Mcps. A chip is a code word used to modu-
late the information signal. Every second, 3.84 million chips are sent over 
the radio interface. However, the number of data bits transmitted during 
the same period by a user is much smaller. The ratio between the chip rate 
and the data bit rate is called the spreading factor. In principle, the spread-
ing factor indicates how large a chunk of the common bandwidth resource 
the user has been allocated. For example, one carrier could accommodate 
at most 16 users, each having a channel with a spreading factor of 16. The 
spreading factors used in UTRAN can vary between 4 and 512. The se-
quence of chips used to modulate the data bits is called the spreading code. 
Each user is allocated a unique spreading code (or several codes).
The TDD mode differs from the FDD mode in that both the uplink 
and the downlink use the same frequency carrier. The 15 timeslots in a 
radio frame can be dynamically allocated between uplink and downlink di-
rections; thus, the channel capacity of these links can be different. The chip 
rate of the normal TDD mode is 3.84 Mcps, but there also exists two other 
options, the 1.28 Mcps low chip rate (LCR) option and the 7.68 Mcps 
option. The 1.28 Mcps option was introduced in Release 4, and the 7.68 
Mcps option was added to Release 7. The nominal carrier bandwidths for 
1.28 Mcps, 3.84 Mcps, and 7.68 Mcps options are 1.6 MHz, 5 MHz, and 10 
MHz, respectively. The TDD mode is actively promoted by Chinese com-
panies, and China Mobile has been given licences to operate TDD mode 
networks in China, in both 3G and 4G technologies. The advantage of the 
TDD mode is that the timeslots in a frame can be allocated asymmetrically 
for data services where the expected bit rates in the uplink and downlink 
differ significantly. Also, because TDD does not require symmetric band 

20 
 
History of Mobile Telecommunications
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
allocations, it can be deployed on individual spectrum bands, which are 
easier to find than “paired” symmetric bands.
The UMTS core network (in its early form) is an enhanced GSM/
GPRS core network—many elements of the GSM/GPRS network can be 
reused in 3G, which makes the migration from 2G to 3G easier for network 
operators. The radio access network (base stations and base station control-
lers) in UMTS is new though.
2.3.2.3  Releases
The standards work in 3GPP is organized around releases. A release is a 
self-contained set of standards (this set can be rather large—a 3GPP release 
typically contains hundreds of individual specifications). There is no exact 
schedule on when new releases will be published. At early stages of UMTS 
work there were new releases every year, but later on this time has grown 
to 18 months or so. More about 3GPP working practises and releases in 
Chapter 10.
When it comes to 3G, the first 3GPP release was known as Release 99 
(though it was already the year 2000 before that release was published). Re-
lease 99 provided 64-Kbps circuit switched and 384-Kbps packet switched 
connections. After Release 99 the numbering of releases was changed as it 
became obvious that a year-based numbering would be difficult to main-
tain; not all years would have a new release. After Release 99 came Release 
4 (originally called release 2000), which was released in 2001. This release 
was rather thin in content. The most important new features in Release 4 
included:
•• Transcoder free operation (TrFO);
•• Tandem free operation (TFO);
•• Virtual home environment;
•• Full support of location services (LCS);
•• The new narrowband, or low chip rate, TDD mode (1.28 Mcps);
•• UTRA repeater;
•• Robust header compression (ROHC).
Release 5 followed in 2002. This is a bigger release than Release 4. 
It contains several large and important enhancements to 3GPP systems. 
One could also quite justifiably claim that Release 5 provides the first true 
3GPP system, as only Release 5’s new features make it possible to provide 
genuine 3G-specific services with attributes that people are expecting from

3G. Therefore, it is slightly ironic that marketing people already like to call 
HSDPA 3.5G. The new features in Release 5 include the following:
•• High-speed downlink packet access (HSDPA);
•• Wideband AMR (WB-AMR) codec;
•• IP-based multimedia services (IMS);
•• Intradomain connection of RAN nodes to multiple CN nodes (Iu-Flex);
•• Reliable end-to-end QoS for packet-switched domain.
HSDPA, especially, was a very important enhancement. It increased the 
maximum data rate in the downlink to 14.4 Mbps (with 16QAM modula-
tion and code rate of 1). However, HSDPA is not so much about increas-
ing the theoretical maximum data rate (which, in mobile telecommunica-
tions, is very theoretical anyway); it is more about increasing the practical 
throughput. The highly dynamic and adaptive nature of HSDPA means that 
HSDPA channels will be able to transmit the highest possible amount of 
data frame after frame even in poor and changing radio conditions. 
After Release 5 it took a longer time before the next release was ready. 
Release 6 came out at the end of 2004. This is also a large release, contain-
ing features such as:
•• High-speed uplink packet access (HSUPA);
•• Multimedia broadcast multicast services (MBMS);
•• Push to talk over cellular (PoC);
•• Generic access network (GAN);
•• Improvements to IMS.
The main features here are HSUPA and MBMS. HSUPA can provide 
5.76 Mbps maximum data rate in the uplink in Release 6. MBMS is poten-
tially a very important feature for operators, enabling them to offer broad-
cast services such as TV and radio. However, even though this release was 
out in 2004, there are no operational MBMS systems yet anywhere in 2013. 
The problem is probably in that MBMS consumes a large chunk of the 
network capacity, and in 3G the capacity is still in short supply. However, 
in LTE the corresponding feature (eMBMS) will be launched at least by 
Verizon in 2014. LTE has more capacity available so MBMS may be more 
successful there.
Release 7 was the last 3G-only release before the arrival of LTE. The 
most important enhancements in this release include:

•• HSPA+;
•	Advanced mobile receiver diversity;
•	Higher order modulation (64QAM for the downlink, and 16 QAM 
for the uplink);
•	Continuous packet connectivity (CPC);
•	Multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antennas;
•	RAN architecture improvements (flat architecture, lower latency);
•• Evolved EDGE.
The maximum data rate in Release 7 is 21.2 Mbps for the downlink, 
and 11.5 Mbps for the uplink.
Releases 8 and later contain also LTE; therefore those releases are dis-
cussed in Chapter 10. See Table 2.6 for a timeline of 3GPP releases.
2.3.3  3GPP2
2.3.3.1  Introduction
The 3GPP2 initiative is the other major 3G standardization organization. 
It promotes the code division multiple access 2000 (CDMA2000) system, 
which is also based on a form of WCDMA technology. In the world of 
IMT-2000, this proposal is known as IMT-MC. The major difference be-
tween the 3GPP and the 3GPP2 approaches is that 3GPP has specified a 
completely new air interface without constraints from the past, whereas 
3GPP2 has specified a system that is backwards compatible with IS-95 sys-
tems. This approach was seen necessary because in North America, IS-95 
systems already use the frequency bands allocated for 3G by the World Ad-
ministrative Radio Conference (WARC). It makes the transition into 3G 
much easier if the new system can coexist with the old system in the same

frequency band. The CDMA2000 also uses the same core network as IS-95, 
namely IS-41 (also known as TIA/EIA-41).
A CDMA2000 system can operate on the same 1.25-MHz radio chan-
nels as IS-95, and thus it offers backward compatibility with IS-95. The 
chip rate of CDMA2000 (1x) is also the same as in IS-95 (1.2288 Mcps). 
Note that the CDMA2000 standard originally included two carrier modes; 
single-carrier (1x) and multi-carrier (3x) modes (see Figure 2.7). However, 
the 3x mode never took off as intended (that is, as a wideband carrier sys-
tem with 3.75 MHz carriers), and all CDMA2000 deployments so far are 
using the single carrier mode only.
2.3.3.2  1xRTT
The first CDMA2000 standard was called 1xRTT. This abbreviation stands 
for single carrier radio transmission technology. Whether or not it is a true 
3G technology depends on who does the definition. The theoretical maxi-
mum data rate in the first release (cdma2000 revision 0) was 153 Kbps, 
though in operational networks this is likely to remain below 100 Kbps. 
After revision 0, several new revisions have been released: revision A, revision 
B, revision C, revision D, and revision E, which is also known as 1x advanced 
(more about 1x Advanced in Section 2.3.3.5). The first cdma2000 1xRTT 
network was deployed in October 2000.
2.3.3.3  1xEV-DO
CDMA2000 1xEV-DO (evolution-data optimized) is a family of standards 
that brought new high-speed packet-switched techniques to CDMA2000. 
The design aim was to deliver peak data rates exceeding 2 Mbps. EV-DO 
introduces an additional carrier that is optimized for packet data transfer 
only. In an EV-DO system the circuit-switched connections (voice) and 
packet-switched high-speed data connections are separated on different 
1.25 MHz carriers, even if they belong to the same user. Indeed, originally 
EV-DO abbreviation meant “evolution-data only”.

History of Mobile Telecommunications
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
1xEV-DO has also undergone several revisions since its first release 
(release 0): revision A and revision B. There were also plans for revision C, 
which would have included an OFDMA-based 4G air interface. However, 
as discussed later, this revision will not be deployed.
EV-DO release 0 offers data rates up to 2.4 Mbps in the downlink (or 
in the forward link in CDMA2000 jargon), which in operational networks 
means approximately 300–600 Kbps. This release has many similarities with 
HSDPA, which is part of UTRAN Release 5. The maximum uplink data 
rate is 153 Kbps. The first EV-DO release 0 network was deployed in 2002.
EV-DO revision A introduces further enhancements by reducing laten-
cy and increasing data rates. The maximum downlink data rate is increased 
to 3.1 Mbps, and the uplink rate to 1.8 Mbps. Low latency (around 50 ms) 
enables new types of services such as VoIP and video telephony. EV-DO rev 
A has many similarities with HSUPA, which is part of UTRAN Release 6. 
The first EV-DO rev A network was deployed in 2006.
EV-DO revision B introduces scalable bandwidth channels. Revision 
B enables the aggregation of multiple 1.25 MHz channels to form a set 
of parallel channels, increasing the data throughput. The standard allows 
15 parallel channels, in which case the combined channel has an effective 
bandwidth of 20 MHz. Note that the component channels do not have 
to be adjacent in frequency space. Also, with the introduction of 64QAM 
modulation, the maximum data rate of a single 1.25-MHz component car-
rier has been increased to 4.9 Mbps. An aggregated 5-MHz carrier can 
thus deliver 14.7 Mbps downlink, and a 20 MHz carrier could achieve 
73.5 Mbps downlink. However, these numbers are truly theoretical be-
cause 64QAM requires very good radio conditions. Latency is also further 
reduced in EV-DO revision B. The first EV-DO revision B network was 
deployed in early 2010.
2.3.3.4  EV-DO Advanced
EV-DO advanced is the latest enhancement to EV-DO systems. It does not 
improve the actual theoretical maximum data rate. Rather, it is a software 
update that improves network operation and management processes. EV-
DO advanced enhancements include the following:
•• Network load balancing (NLB) reassigns mobile devices from heavily 
loaded sectors to lightly loaded sectors, even if the radio conditions are 
better in the heavily loaded sector.
•• Adaptive frequency reuse reduces the interference in a capacity-con-
strained cell by reducing the transmit power of a secondary carrier in 
an adjacent lightly loaded cell, while the primary carrier continues to

operate at full power to ensure wide coverage. As a result, the overall 
network capacity is increased.
•• Distributed network scheduler prioritizes and allocates bandwidth to 
multiple users at the network level to help to maximize overall network 
efficiency.
•• Single carrier multilink, whereby two carriers using the same frequency, 
can serve a dual-antenna mobile device from different cells or sectors. 
Therefore the mobile can get the benefits of a multicarrier network, 
even though it moves in a single carrier network.
•• Smart carrier management can assign one or more carriers to a device 
within the same cell or from an adjacent cell if another cell is less loaded 
or offers better coverage.
•• Enhanced connection management optimizes device connections to 
the network depending on the type of application being used to im-
prove signaling capacity and to reduce latency.
2.3.3.5  1x Advanced
Whereas EVDO enhancements were about improving the packet switched 
operations of the CDMA2000 system, 1x advanced is a standards release for 
improving the circuit-switched side of the system. The specific 1x advanced 
enhancements include the following:
•• Enhanced variable rate codec (EVRC-B);
•• Quasi-linear interference cancellation (QLIC);
•• Quasi-orthogonal functions (QOF);
•• Advanced QLIC;
•• Mobile receive diversity (MRD);
•• Radio link enhancements, including:
•	Reverse link interference cancellation (RLIC);
•	Smart blanking;
•	Efficient power control;
•	Frame early termination (FET).
As a result, 1x advanced can increase the voice capacity in the system by 
up to a factor of four, or alternatively to increase network coverage by up to 
70 percent. The peak data rate is increased to 307 Kbps.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
2.3.3.6  Evolution Data and Voice (1xEVDV)
This evolution was to enhance the existing systems for data and voice on 
the same carrier. Note that as the name says, EVDO systems are optimized 
for data, and 1x advanced is designed for voice. Therefore, in state-of-the-art 
CDMA2000 systems, data and voice tend to use different carriers. However, 
due to lack of interest from network operators, Qualcomm halted the de-
velopment work of 1xEVDV in 2005. 
2.3.3.7  Ultra Mobile Broadband (UMB)
This system was planned to be 3GPP2’s version of 4G. It was to be based 
on OFDMA, in a similar way as LTE. However, in 2008 Qualcomm de-
cided to support LTE as the 4G technology instead. This means that while 
CDMA2000 keeps on evolving, there will not be major upgrades to the 
system anymore. The upgrade path for CDMA2000 operators will point to 
LTE.
2.4  Conclusions
In this chapter we have quickly reviewed the history of mobile telecom-
munications. Timewise, this history is surprisingly short. The first generation 
systems were launched about 30 years ago. During those 30 years the mobile 
telecommunications world has undergone not an evolution but a revolution. 
Nobody in early 1980s could have forecast the way mobile telecommuni-
cations services are used today. The general public has embraced mobile 
phones with such enthusiasm that it has surprised the system designers too. 
All generations so far (1G, 2G, and 3G) have suffered from the shortage of 
capacity since they were designed for fewer users or less data. See Figure 2.8 
for a graph of mobile communications generations and the technologies in 
them.
The fourth generation, or LTE-Advanced, tries to meet the challenges 
of today and those of the future. It is a continuously evolving standard, with 
each release containing new, improved features. It is good to point out that 
basic LTE (without the “A” part) as such is not a recognized 4G system, and 
some call the basic LTE a 3.9G system. LTE was first introduced in 3GPP 
Release 8, but it did not meet the requirements for a 4G system set by 
ITU. It is only in Release 10, which was called LTE-Advanced, that those 
requirement could be met. At the time of this writing, Release 11 specifi-
cations are available and frozen, and work is undergoing with Release 12.
It is also interesting to note that so far new mobile communication 
generations have been launched about every 10 years. The first generation 
started around 1980, the second after 1990, the third generation had its first

deployments around the millennium, and the fourth generation networks 
have been around since 2010. There is no reason why this trend could not 
continue, with a fifth generation system being launched in 2020. However, 
it is good to note that the definition of a new generation is not very clear 
cut. Great improvements in capacity, performance, and services can also be 
achieved within a generation, using the existing basic technology.

Overview of a Modern 4G 
Telecommunications System
3.1  Introduction
The LTE-advanced is now de facto 4G mobile communications system, 
and it is likely to remain so. It does not have a serious competitor in sight. 
3GPP2 has given up its UMB initiative, and mobile WiMAX (802.16m) 
has not been able to gain significant market share, though it fulfills the 4G 
criteria set by the ITU.
In order to understand LTE-A, it is better to have a look at LTE first. 
LTE is a very different system from UMTS, as both its architecture and the 
technologies used are either new or greatly enhanced versions of the old 
entities. In this section we will first have a look at LTE architecture, and 
then we will discuss the radio access network (RAN), the new OFDM 
air interface, and the core network. The final section presents the LTE-A 
enhancements to LTE. The purpose of this chapter is to give an overview 
of an LTE-A system. The detailed discussion will then follow in subsequent 
chapters.
3.2  LTE-A System Architecture
Figure 3.1 gives a high-level description of the LTE-A network architec-
ture. Readers who are more familiar with 2G/3G networks may notice 
the simplicity of the LTE-A architecture. In the old GSM there were base 
transceiver stations (BTS) and base station controllers (BSC), and in UTRA 
networks (see Figure 3.2) we have NodeBs and radio network controllers 
(RNC), and several different entities in the core network.

3.3  LTE RAN
In LTE we have only eNodeBs in the RAN network, though eNodeBs 
come in different sizes and configurations. There is no separate controller 
element like in GSM or in UTRAN. This change is mainly because of the 
drive for lower response times. Latency is an important quality of service 
(QoS) parameter. Many interactive applications such as interactive games 
require very short response times, and the more network elements there 
are on the signal path, the more time will be spent on processing the signal 
before it reaches its destination. Also, by bringing more intelligence to the 
eNodeB, it may be able to handle more requests from the mobile directly,

without consulting the core network. This will result in shortened latencies 
for control signaling.
The third generation mobile communication system as defined by 
3GPP had a WCDMA-based air interface. Whereas WCDMA has many 
good qualities, the requirements for a state-or-the-art mobile communica-
tion system have changed, and an OFDM-based system can fulfill these bet-
ter. Therefore, OFDM was adopted as the air interface technology for LTE 
RAN. In the following section we will discuss why that is so.
3.4  OFDM Air Interface
First of all, OFDM is a system where the wideband carrier consists of nu-
merous subcarriers. In WCDMA a single wideband carrier is employed, and 
it can be very wide indeed. This is probably the most important difference 
between these systems, and it provides several advantages to an OFDM sys-
tem over a WCDMA system. The channel response (i.e., how the channel 
distorts the signal that passes through the channel) depends on the frequency 
used. Therefore, with wideband carriers the channel response is different 
in different parts of the frequency channel. Such a channel is called a fre-
quency-selective channel, and designing a receiver for a frequency-selective 
channel is challenging. When OFDM is employed, a wideband carrier is 
transformed into many narrowband carriers, which are frequency-flat (i.e., 
the channel response is the same for the whole carrier), and receivers for 
frequency-flat channels are easier to design. The list of OFDM advantages 
over WCDMA include:
•• Operators have found out that it is difficult to acquire spectrum, and 
it is especially difficult to get spectrum that is in one big, continu-
ous block. A high-capacity mobile communications system needs more 
spectrum since in principle more spectrum equals more capacity. How-
ever, a WCDMA carrier has to be continuous in frequency, and that is 
a serious limitation for many operators. In OFDM a carrier can con-
sist of component carriers, and those do not have to be continuous in 
frequency. Therefore, an operator can use even small frequency bands 
and combine them to larger carriers in OFDM. Carrier bandwidths in 
OFDM vary between 1.4 MHz and 20 MHz.
•• LTE-A has introduced a concept of carrier aggregation, which en-
ables the network to combine up to five component carriers to form 
one wideband composite carrier. Since the maximum bandwidth of a 
component carrier is 20 MHz, carrier aggregation could handle up to 
100 MHz composite carrier bandwidths. Note that it is true that late

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
WCDMA specifications also allow multicarrier deployments. In Re-
lease 10 an HSDPA system can assign four normal 5-MHz carriers to 
a single user. However, multicarrier HSDPA still cannot complete with 
the level of flexibility provided by an OFDM system.
•• OFDM is better at dealing with multipath interference. Since WCDMA 
employs (possibly very) wide carrier bandwidths, it is difficult for the 
receiver to equalize over the whole carrier. OFDM is a multicarrier 
system; the total carrier bandwidth consists of several narrowband sub-
carriers, and thus equalization can be done individually for each such 
carrier.
•• OFDM is better at providing a single frequency network. Such net-
works are useful for multimedia broadcast multicast (MBMS) services. 
Single frequency networks may suffer from intersymbol interference 
on cell boundary areas. However, since OFDM divides the transmission 
bandwidth into a large number of narrowband subcarriers, the resulting 
symbol length is quite long, and the guard interval between the symbols 
ensures that the symbols do not interfere with each other at the receiver.
•• WCDMA cells are interference-limited (i.e., their capacities depend on 
interference caused by other users). From this fact follows that the ef-
fective cell size is also changing according to a number of active users in 
the cell. This can result in a phenomenon called cell breathing, whereby 
a highly loaded cell loses coverage, thus also interfering users. And due 
to less interference, the effective cell size grows again. This phenomenon 
can be alleviated by careful transmission power control and load balanc-
ing, but it will still be a problem that needs attention. OFDM cells are 
not interference-limited in a similar way as WCDMA cells, and thus cell 
breathing does not exist.
•• OFDM is particularly suitable for MIMO. OFDM modulation turns 
a frequency-selective MIMO channel into a set of parallel frequency-
flat MIMO channels. As a result, the MIMO multichannel equalization 
will be simpler, since only a constant matrix has to be inverted for each 
OFDM subcarrier.
•• Higher spectrum efficiency is possible with MIMO than what 
WCDMA-MIMO can achieve. For 2x2 downlink MIMO, the numbers 
are about 0.6 bps/Hz in WCDMA, 1.7 bps/Hz in LTE, and 2.4 bps/
Hz in LTE-A [1].
OFDM as a technology is further discussed in Chapter 4. The previous 
bullet points list only the differences that make it more suitable than WCD-
MA for a 4G system. However, it is good to point out that WCDMA is by 
no means a dying technology in mobile communications. UTRA networks 
are being enhanced in every 3GPP release, and, for example, a Release 12

Evolved Packet Core 
 
33
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
UTRAN system is certainly a much more capable system than a Release 6 
system, even though both are based on WCDMA.
3.5  Evolved Packet Core
3GPP introduced LTE in Release 8, and it is best known for its new air 
interface technology, OFDM. However, the air interface was not the only 
new system component that was introduced in Release 8, since also the 
core network was new. The new core network architecture is known as the 
system architecture evolution (SAE), or more commonly as the evolved 
packet core (EPC). EPC is based on the GPRS core network, and it uses the 
Internet protocol (IP) as the basic transmission protocol, which means that 
there is no circuit-switched domain left in the system, and only the packet-
switched domain exists.
The main design principle in EPC was to keep the architecture simple. 
In GPRS and UMTS the network has a hierarchical architecture with many 
different types of nodes, which also results in a large number of different 
interfaces between them. A signal/message is likely to be processed in many 
nodes and sent over many interfaces, resulting in unnecessary long latencies 
for message exchanges. To simplify things, EPC provides a flat architecture, 
with a few new network nodes.
The user plane (i.e., the data traffic) and the control plane (control 
signaling) are logically separated. The architecture is optimized for the data 
traffic—the aim is to transfer the data as quickly as possible, with as few 
network nodes and protocol conversions on the data path as possible.
The network nodes in the EPC include serving gateway (S-GW), pack-
et data network gateway (PDN GW), mobility management entity (MME), 
and home subscriber server (HSS). If the radio access network used is not 
a 3GPP RAN, then some other types of nodes may also be needed in the 
core network.
As with the air interface, EPC is constantly evolving, and new improve-
ments are introduced in every release. EPC will be discussed further in 
detail in Chapter 8.
3.6  LTE Requirements
Quite soon after the first 3GPP networks were launched, it became obvious 
that 3G had a problem with data transfer services. Though 3G can transfer 
data, it cannot transfer a lot of it. With the increasing number of data applica-
tions, the capacity of 3G would run out sooner rather than later. There are 

34 
 
Overview of a Modern 4G Telecommunications System
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
ways to increase capacity (e.g., by adding more spectrum), but WCDMA is 
not very good at very wide carrier bandwidths.
3GPP held a workshop in late 2004 in Toronto, and, based on the con-
tributions presented, a feasibility study regarding a new system was launched. 
The outcome of this work was Technical Report 25.913 [1], which con-
tained a list of requirements for the future LTE system. When looking at this 
list, it becomes clear that many of these requirements would be difficult to 
achieve merely by enhancing the existing UMTS system. In the following 
sections we will present and discuss these requirements.
LTE requirements for Release 8 [1] are listed as follows:
•• Peak data rate:
•	Instantaneous downlink peak data rate of 100 Mbps within a 20-
MHz downlink spectrum allocation (5 bps/Hz).
•	Instantaneous uplink peak data rate of 50 Mbps within a 20-MHz 
uplink spectrum allocation (2.5 bps/Hz).
•• Control-plane latency:
•	Transition time of less than 100 ms from a camped state, such as Re-
lease 6 idle mode, to an active state such as Release 6 CELL_DCH.
•	Transition time of less than 50 ms between a dormant state such 
as Release 6 CELL_PCH and an active state such as Release 6 
CELL_DCH.
•• Control-plane capacity:
•	At least 200 users per cell should be supported in the active state for 
spectrum allocations up to 5 MHz.
•• User-plane latency:
•	Less than 5 ms in unloaded condition (i.e., single user with single 
data stream) for small IP packet.
•• User throughput:
•	Downlink: average user throughput per MHz, 3 to 4 times of Release 
6 HSDPA.
•	Uplink: average user throughput per MHz, 2 to 3 times of Release 6 
enhanced uplink.
•• Spectrum efficiency:
•	Downlink: In a loaded network, target for spectrum efficiency (bits/
sec/Hz/site), 3 to 4 times of Release 6 HSDPA).

•	Higher mobile speed between 15 and 120 km/h should be sup-
ported with high performance.

from 120 km/h to 350 km/h (or even up to 500 km/h depending 
on the frequency band).
•• Coverage:

should be met for 5-km cells and with a slight degradation for 30-km 
cells. Cells range up to 100 km should not be precluded.

•• Spectrum flexibility:

and unpaired spectrum shall be supported.
•	The system shall be able to support content delivery over an aggre-
gation of resources including radio band resources (as well as power, 
adaptive scheduling, and so on) in the same and different bands, in 
both uplink and downlink and in both adjacent and nonadjacent 
channel arrangements. A “radio band resource” is defined as all spec-
trum available to an operator.

Peak data rate is a popular attribute among marketing people and the 
press. This rate is typically so high that it sounds good for prospective cus-
tomers. However, it is really a theoretical peak data rate in ideal conditions, 
and as such it will not be available in operational networks. It is also the 
maximum capacity of the whole base station, or a base station sector, and 
therefore it has to be divided between the users of the base station/sector. 
And even if the user were the only user of the base station in question, a 
standard mobile device could not make use of the whole available capacity.
Peak data rate can be increased by adding more spectrum, by using 
higher-order modulation, or by MIMO antenna techniques. Here, the peak 
data rate requirement is already given as “per Hertz” so simply adding more 
spectrum to the system would not help. But LTE employs both MIMO and 
higher-order modulation. It supports 4x4 MIMO antennas in the down-
link and 2x2 MIMO in the uplink in Release 8. The modulation schemes

supported are QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM (64QAM is optional for the 
UE in the uplink). With these parameters, the peak data rate will easily ex-
ceed the requirements both in the uplink and in the downlink [2].
Control-plane latency requirements between idle/dormant and active 
states for the mobile device are 100 ms between idle and active states, and 50 
ms between dormant and active states. This requirement has been fulfilled 
mainly by adopting a simplified and flat architecture, since this will reduce 
the transmission delays. The new eNodeB also includes most the function-
ality of the old base station controller node (RNC in UTRAN). Since the 
eNodeB has more intelligence, it can itself respond to more queries from 
the mobile station, without consulting other network nodes first. However, 
control plane latency is a complex issue, and low latency requires careful 
planning of control protocols. Simply reducing the number of messages 
transferred will also reduce the latency caused by the whole procedure. The 
signaling procedures should be as simple as possible, and the transfer of re-
dundant information (i.e., information that is already known by the mobile 
station or information which is not needed) should be avoided. Sometimes 
the UE also needs to read the broadcast system information, and the system 
information transmission sequences should be designed so that the most 
commonly needed information is transmitted more often.

Overview of a Modern 4G Telecommunications System
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Control-plane capacity requirement is that at least 200 users per cell 
should be supported in the active state for spectrum allocations up to 5 
MHz. This requirement (as given in [1]) is a bit unclear, but if interpreted 
that the system should be able to support this number of users per cell with 
quasi-instantaneous access (i.e., within 1 ms) to radio resources in the active 
state, then it can be achieved: one resource block is 180 kHz wide and 0.5 
ms in duration. A 5-MHz-wide channel can accommodate 27 such blocks 
in the frequency domain. This number can be multiplied by two because an 
LTE transmission time interval (TTI) (1 ms) can take two resource blocks 
(of 0.5 ms length) => 54 users in each TTI. Furthermore, if 4x4 MIMO is 
used, then this number can be further multiplied by 4 => 216 simultane-
ous users.
User-plane latency should be less than 5 ms in unloaded conditions 
for a small IP packet (i.e., with no payload). Small IP packet means that the 
message does not need to be segmented and can be sent in a single sub-
frame. In the air interface the most important factor deciding the amount 
of latency is the TTI. TTI defines the duration of a transmission on the air 
interface. In LTE the TTI is only 1 ms. That is, it will take 1ms for the UE to 
transmit even a short data packet. In addition there will be small processing 
delays in the mobile station, eNodeB, and in the S-GW, plus a transmission 
delay between the eNodeB and the S-GW, which depends on the length of 
the cable between these nodes (i.e., their physical distance). In any case 5 ms 
is achievable in an unloaded network where retransmissions are not needed.
User throughput/spectrum efficiency requirement was given as im-
provement over Release 6; in the downlink LTE should be 3–4 times better 
than Release 6 HSDPA, and in the uplink it should be 2-3 times better than 
Release 6 enhanced uplink. These are also achievable, provided that 2x2 
MIMO is used in the downlink and 1x2 MIMO in the uplink.
Mobility requirements are divided into three classes: the emphasis in 
LTE performance should be for low mobile speeds from 0 to 15 kph. Still, 
mobile speeds between 15 and 120 kph should be supported with high per-
formance. And some level of mobility should be maintained up to 350 kph 
(or even up to 500 kph, depending on the frequency band). Note that these 
kinds of requirements are difficult to measure. For example, who defines 
what is the “high performance” that should be supported for mobile with 
velocity between 15 and 120 kph?
The coverage requirement states that throughput, spectrum efficiency, 
and mobility targets should be met for 5-km cells, and with a slight degra-
dation for 30-km cells. Cells range up to 100 km should not be precluded. 
Again, the requirements for 30-km and 100-km range cells are not exact 
and therefore cannot be measured.
The requirement for further enhanced multimedia broadcast multicast 
service (MBMS) is included in the requirements list, but in the end this 
feature was not included in Release 8 LTE. The reason for this was probably 

	
3.6 
LTE Requirements 
 
39
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
the extra work required and the fact that 3G-based MBMS was not de-
ployed commercially anywhere in the world and thus there was no urgent 
need to specify it for LTE from the start. However, eMBMS is included in 
LTE Release 9.
The spectrum flexibility requirement is actually not a requirement but 
a relief. LTE is very flexible when it comes to spectrum bands. Whereas 
UTRAN could only operate on 5-MHz carriers (in the FDD mode that is; 
the TDD mode has more options), LTE can use six different carrier band-
widths: 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, and 20 MHz. Both paired and unpaired spectrum 
can be used. Reference [1] also mentions carrier aggregation as a means 
to combine these component carriers into bigger aggregated carriers. The 
component carriers do not have to be on adjacent frequency bands. How-
ever, carrier aggregation is not part of Release 8, but it is introduced in 
Release 10.
Co-existence and interworking with 3GPP radio access technology 
(RAT) means that LTE and GERAN/UTRAN networks can have over-
lapping coverage areas, and an LTE mobile device should be able to support 
measurements of, and handover from and to, both UTRAN and GERAN. 
For real-time services, the interruption time during handover should be less 
than 300 ms; for non–real time services this requirement is less than 500 ms.
The requirements for architecture and migration do not contain many 
tangible details, except that there should be only one E-UTRAN architec-
ture (which is common sense) and that architecture should be packet based.
Similarly, the requirements for radio resource management are not re-
ally measurable; rather, they form a list of good intentions. Load sharing 
across different RATs is an especially useful feature.
The complexity requirement is also recommendable. The number of 
options and features should be kept at minimum. In early 3GPP work, 
if competing features were proposed for addition to specifications, it was 
sometimes easiest to add them all as optional features. This approach will 
result in unnecessary complex and expensive devices, and it is especially dif-
ficult to test all those optional features.
This list of requirements here is not complete; the reader can have a 
look at [1] for the full list. However, the most important requirements are 
listed here; the rest are mainly good intentions of what the system should 
be able to do.
As a conclusion, it is clear that a new system was needed, and the new 
system should be able to provide much higher data rates to many more 
users. They key improvements to achieve these were the new system ar-
chitecture and the selection of OFDM as the new air interface technology. 
OFDM can make use of very wide frequency bands efficiently, especially 
when carrier aggregation is used. It is also well suited for MIMO, which is 
definitely a technology to be exploited when higher data rates are needed. 
Most of all, it was important to have a system that can be enhanced in the

future. Future-proof is not quite the right word because no system can 
foresee and accommodate every possible future requirement. However, the 
nature of 3GPP work is such that new features will be introduced in every 
release, and LTE provides a good platform to do it. LTE-advanced is already 
a proof of this.
3.7  LTE-Advanced
LTE was in first introduced in 3GPP Release 8, which was therefore a 
major release. After that, Release 9 was a more lightweight release for LTE, 
containing features that were originally planned for Release 8 and for some 
reason or another were postponed.
3GPP Release 10 was again a major release, and it included the stan-
dards for LTE-advanced. Even though the basic LTE was a great improve-
ment over UMTS, it still fell short of the requirements set by ITU for a 4G 
system. LTE-advanced aimed to fix this.
This section explains the issues that make LTE-advanced different from 
the standard Release 8 LTE. In fact, the transition from LTE to LTE-A is 
much smaller than the transition from UMTS to LTE. LTE already included 
the major changes, such as the new air interface based on OFDMA.
ITU has defined a set of high-level requirements that have to be ful-
filled before a system can claim to be a 4G system (or as ITU defines it, 
IMT-Advanced). These are given in the following list [2]:
•• A high degree of common functionality worldwide while retaining the 
flexibility to support a wide range of services and applications in a cost-
efficient manner;
•• Compatibility of services within IMT and with fixed networks;
•• Capability of interworking with other radio access systems;
•• High-quality mobile services;
•• User equipment suitable for worldwide use;
•• User-friendly applications, services, and equipment;
•• Worldwide roaming capability; 
•• Enhanced peak data rates to support advanced services and applications 
(100 Mbps for high and 1 Gbps for low mobility were established as 
targets for research).
As one can see, the problem with these requirements is that, except 
for the last requirement, they are rather difficult to measure. Any system

can claim to offer high-quality mobile services and user-friendly applica-
tions. The last requirement looks rather challenging at first, but it is good 
to note that this is about peak data rates. Again, peak data rates are often 
purely theoretical values, not to be achieved or maintained in operational 
networks. Therefore simply by throwing in a few enhanced parameters and 
making assumptions, the peak data rate can be increased considerably. For 
example, with MIMO 8x8 antennas, higher-order modulation, and very 
wide channel bandwidths, it is possible to show that the new system can 
achieve 1Gbps data rate in ideal conditions. But will you get this data rate to 
your mobile device in five years’ time? The answer is certainly no.
In fact, it is more interesting to analyze 3GPP’s own characterization of 
the LTE-A system from Annex 1 of [1, 3]. This list contains lots of hard facts 
that make it interesting reading for a telecommunications engineer:
•• Downlink transmission scheme is based on conventional OFDM;
•• Uplink transmission scheme is based on discrete Fourier transform 
(DFT) spread OFDM;
•• Both FDD and TDD operations are supported;
•• Transmission bandwidths up to 100 MHz are supported, individual car-
riers up to 20 MHz are supported, and a maximum of five of them can 
be combined with carrier aggregation;
•• Peak data rates of 1Gbps in the downlink and 500 Mbps in the uplink 
(this was later increased to 3 Gbps in the downlink and 1.5 Gbps in the 
uplink);
•• Channel coding is based on rate 1/3 turbo coding + hybrid ARQ with 
soft combining;
•• Data modulation supports QPSK, 16QAM, and 64QAM, for both the 
downlink and the uplink;
•• 8x8 MIMO supported on the downlink, 4x4 on the uplink;
•• Intercell interference coordination (ICIC) is supported;
•• Relays are supported;
•• Flat radio access network (RAN) architecture (RAN has only one type 
of node, eNodeB);
•• Control plane latency 50 ms;
•• User plane latency 4 ms;
•• Peak spectrum efficiency; downlink 30 bps/Hz, uplink 15 bps/Hz;
•• Mobility support for speeds up to 350 kph (possibly up to 500 kph).

42 
 
Overview of a Modern 4G Telecommunications System
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Many of these requirements were already supported by Release 8/9 
LTE. The completely new LTE-A features include:
•• Carrier aggregation;
•• Higher order MIMO;
•• Relays;
•• Enhanced intercell interference coordination (eICIC);
•• MBMS enhancements;
•• SON enhancements.
With the help of carrier aggregation and higher order MIMO, it is 
possible to achieve the new peak data rate requirements. And rather than 
calculating peak spectrum efficiency, it is more useful to examine the av-
erage spectrum efficiency requirement. Peak spectrum efficiency means 
error-free conditions and all radio resources of a cell assigned to a single 
mobile device. This kind of situation will never happen in operational net-
works. Average spectrum efficiency is defined as the aggregate throughput 
of all users (the number of correctly received bits over a certain period of 
time) normalized by the overall cell bandwidth divided by the number of 
cells. This gives a much better estimate of the performance of the network, 
though it is good to remember that these numbers are also based on com-
puter simulations and not on measurements in deployed networks.
For LTE-A the targets for average spectrum efficiency are listed in Table 
3.1.
In Table 2.1, the antenna configuration column gives the antenna con-
figuration employed. For example, DL 4x2 refers to a downlink antenna 
system that has four transmitting and two receiving antennas. And since this 
is downlink, the four transmitting antennas are in the base station, and the 
two receiving antennas are in the UE.
Carrier aggregation was introduced into LTE-A in Release 10. It is 
used to combine several component carriers (up to five) into one logical

aggregated carrier, though in Releases 10 and 11 only two-component 
carriers are supported. The component carriers are normal carriers (i.e., 
similar to standard LTE carriers), and thus they can have a bandwidth of 1.4, 
3, 5, 10, 15, or 20 MHz. Therefore, the theoretical maximum bandwidth of 
an aggregated carrier is 100 MHz. However, it is very unlikely that such a 
wide carrier is seen in operational networks (first of all, such large unused 
frequency blocks simply do not exist, and, even if one was made available, 
no operator would be wealthy enough to buy it). Rather, the main rea-
son for carrier aggregation is that some operators may have access to only 
relatively small slices of spectrum on different frequency bands, and carrier 
aggregation provides a way to combine those slices into wider, more useful, 
spectrum channels. Carrier aggregation is discussed in detail in Chapter 11.
MIMO was also enhanced in Release 10. The downlink now supports 
8x8 MIMO, and in the uplink 4x4 MIMO can be used. This kind of high-
er-order MIMO system can increase the data throughput considerably, but 
it must be noted that 8x8 MIMO requires very good radio conditions be-
fore it can be used successfully. However, MIMO as a technology is much 
more than just adding more antennas to devices, and it is discussed in detail 
in Chapter 11.
Relays are the third important LTE-A enhancement. The reason to 
introduce relays is that macro-cells may have locations with poor coverage, 
especially near cell edges. Relays offer an inexpensive way to cover those 
locations better. A new macro eNodeB would cost more, and the wired 
backhaul especially may become a costly issue. LTE-A relays employ wire-
less backhaul, which is in principle free. However, it uses the same spectrum 
as other base stations/users, and thus the capacity of base stations involved 
is less than it would be without relays. LTE-A relays are so-called layer 3 
relays, which are transparent to mobile devices (i.e., mobile devices do not 
know that the “base station” they are connected to is not a base station but 
a relay since the relay looks like a normal base station to mobile devices). 
The backhaul may use the same or a different frequency compared to the 
frequency used by the relay. Relays are also discussed in detail in Chapter 11.
Enhanced intercell interference coordination (eICIC) is introduced to 
deal with interference, especially in heterogenous networks (HetNet). Pico 
and femto cells are becoming more popular, and they are introduced es-
pecially to traffic hotspots. However, these cells are low power, and they 
may suffer from serious interference from the much higher power macro 
cells, since typically such pico cells and macro cells have overlapping cover-
age. The solution proposed in Release 10 is to use almost blank subframes 
(ABS). During those frames, only the most minimal set of signals is trans-
mitted from the macro eNodeB (or whoever is the interferer). The pico/
femto cells can then use these quiet frames to transmit to the UEs in their 
coverage area. More about eICIC can be found in Chapter 11.

44 
 
Overview of a Modern 4G Telecommunications System
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
MBMS is also enhanced in Release 10. MBMS was already introduced 
in LTE in Release 9, and the most important enhancement in Release 10 is 
the counting function. Because MBMS is a broadcast/multicast service, the 
network does not necessarily know how many users (if any) are receiving 
a particular broadcast. This may lead to a waste of resources if the network 
broadcasts services nobody wants to receive. The counting function checks 
the number of connected mode users that either already receive, or want to 
receive, a particular MBMS service. The details of this feature and MBMS 
in general are discussed in Chapter 11.
Self-organizing networks (SON) enhancements is a very diverse topic. 
SON is an “umbrella” work item for various issues that aim to assist net-
work operators in managing LTE networks. SON involves various mecha-
nisms that maintain or improve the performance of LTE network autono-
mously without an operator’s intervention, or at least with reduced need 
for interventions. SON is such a wide topic that it is discussed in its own 
section in Chapter 11.
The first 3GPP release implementing LTE-A feature was Release 10. 
Release 10 was frozen (i.e., no new functional features can be added to the 
specification after this date) in March 2011, and in 2013 there are already 
some network operators trialing these features. It is also good to point out 
that the new LTE-A features presented in this section are only a subset of 
all new LTE-A features (albeit they are they are the most important ones).
3.8  LTE-A in Release 11
Release 11 was nominally frozen in September 2012, but in practice the 
RAN protocols were stable only in March 2013. 
The list of LTE-A enhancements and new features include:
•• Coordinated multipoint transmission and reception (CoMP);
•• Carrier aggregation enhancements;
•• Further enhanced intercell interference coordination (FeICIC);
•• MBMS service continuity;
•• Further SON enhancements.
CoMP is a scheme where the data throughput for UEs near cell edges 
is improved, and thus the overall system efficiency is enhanced. The idea 
behind CoMP is that the UEs near cell edges can receive the signal from 
two or more cells, and conversely such UEs’ transmissions can be received 
by several cells. If the downlink transmissions are coordinated, and the same 
data is sent to the UE via several transmitters, this obviously improves the

quality of the reception. There are several variations in this scheme, and they 
are all discussed further in Chapter 11.
Carrier aggregation is also enhanced further in Release 11. The en-
hancements include improved support for different downlink/uplink con-
figurations in the TDD mode on different component carriers that are on 
different frequency bands. Different timing advances on different compo-
nent carriers is also supported.
The FeICIC feature includes support for an interference cancellation 
receiver at the UE. The network may configure the UE with cell-specific 
reference signal (CRS) assistance information of the interfering cells in or-
der to aid the UE to mitigate the interference from CRS of those cells.
MBMS service continuity includes support for multicarrier MBMS 
deployment. The network can inform the UE about the carrier frequen-
cies used and which services are available on each frequency. The UE can 
also indicate the network on which MBMS services is interested, and the 
network can use this information in its mobility management so that the 
UE in question is kept on the appropriate carrier frequency so that it can 
continue to receive the selected services.
Release 11 also contains a long list of various SON enhancements. 
These are discussed together with earlier SON features in Chapter 11.
Mobile relays study item was also part of Release 11, but due to lack of 
time this work item was postponed to Release 12.
The LTE-A development work is continuing, and each new release will 
bring further improvements. The time span between releases is currently 
about 18 months.
Release 12 LTE-A enhancements are discussed in Chapter 12, Future 
Trends. However, at the time of this writing, Release 12 work is still ongo-
ing, and therefore it is not quite sure yet what it will contain.

Chapter 4
OFDMA
4.1  Introduction
Orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) as a technology is 
quite old; 3GPP by no means invented it. It has been used earlier for many 
systems such as wireless LAN standards 802.11a/g/n, DVB-T, DVB-H, and 
many others. It is also been used in IEEE 802.16m (mobile WiMAX) [1], 
which is the other 4G standard in existence today. OFDM is also used in 
many cable systems. Therefore, it is a proven technology.
Orthogonal frequency division multiple access (OFDMA) is simply a 
variant of OFDM whereby different OFDM subcarriers can be allocated 
to different users. This transforms OFDM into multiple access scheme, en-
abling several users to access system resources simultaneously.
From the user point view the different air interface technology means 
that a new handset is required before moving to a 4G network. In practice 
all 4G capable handsets will be at least dual-mode (3G/4G) phones, or even 
2G/3G/4G phones (though in Japan the 2G network is already closed, so 
the new Japanese mobile phones are typically dual-mode 3G/4G handsets).
OFDM has many qualities that make it especially suitable for wideband 
communications. It can make use of wide carriers very well. This is impor-
tant in 4G since higher data rates require more spectrum and wider carriers. 
In systems that are based on CDMA (or TDMA, for that matter) the prob-
lem with wide channels is that such channels become very frequency selec-
tive (i.e., the signal gets distorted when transmitted over the air), and the 
distortion is dependent on the frequency used (see Figure 4.1). Designing a 
receiver for frequency selective channel is difficult, especially if the receiver 
is in a mobile device that has limited amount of processing capacity and 
power in its use. The complexity of such receivers in wideband channels 
makes it impractical to use WCDMA with, say, a single 20-MHz carrier.
OFDM divides the wide carrier into numerous narrowband subcarri-
ers and handles them (almost) individually. These subcarriers are so narrow 
that the channel response is frequency nonselective (frequency-flat) (i.e., the 
receiver can assume that the received narrowband signal is equally distorted 
over the whole frequency area of the subcarrier). In other words, the chan-
nel bandwidth of a frequency flat channel should be smaller than the coher-
ence bandwidth. For such a signal, it is much easier to design an efficient

receiver. However, note that in practice some parts of the frequency channel 
may remain unusable even if the subcarrier bandwidth is smaller than the 
coherence bandwidth. For example, in Figure 4.1 there is a very deep fade 
around frequency f1. Therefore this frequency channel should be left un-
used. Fortunately, in LTE it is possible to use channel response (i.e., channel 
quality measurements) as one scheduling parameter in the eNodeB sched-
uler: the objective is to schedule for each UE only those frequency channels 
that offer the best channel response for each particular UE.
The subcarriers are packed very close to each other and normally these 
carriers would interfere with each other. However, the “O” in OFDM 
stands for orthogonal, and that is how the arrangement works. The subcar-
rier frequencies are chosen so that the subcarriers are orthogonal with each 
other, and as a result the subcarriers do not interference with each other. 
There is no need to have a guard band between subcarriers. Figure 4.2 
depicts three orthogonal subcarriers; frequency f1 has the peak amplitude 
for the first subcarrier, but subcarriers 2 and 3 have zero amplitude on that 
frequency. Similarly, f2 provides the peak amplitude for the second subcar-
rier, but zeros for subcarriers 1 and 3.
The orthogonality requires that the subcarrier spacing is

is 66.67 us and the subcarrier spacing is thus 15 kHz [2]. Note that as a 
result of subcarrier orthgonality, OFDM is very spectral efficient because

the subcarriers can be packed tightly. On the other hand, OFDM is very 
sensitive to frequency offset. If frequency synchronization is lost, then also 
the subcarrier orthogonality is gone, and the receiver will suffer from seri-
ous intercarrier interference (ICI). Figure 4.3 shows a system where the 
orthogonality is lost, resulting in ICI. In this example, the second subcarrier 
has drifted slightly toward the first subcarrier, and this has resulted in serious 
ICI, affecting both subcarriers.
A typical radio channel also suffers from multipath effects. The receiver 
may get delayed versions of the same signal, in which case the delayed 
symbol received from a long propagation path may overlap with the next 
symbol at the receiver resulting in intersymbol interference (ISI) (see Figure 
4.4). In modern systems, the data rates are ever higher, and consequently 
the symbol lengths become shorter. As a result it could be that ISI is not 
the result of only two successive symbols interfering with each other, but 
the ISI may span over several symbol periods. Designing a receiver for such 
a system is very challenging. However, OFDM can suppress ISI quite ef-
ficiently. OFDM employs a large number of narrowband carriers, which 
are modulated at a low symbol rate. This results in a long symbol duration 
which limits the effects of ISI and makes it feasible to use cyclic prefixes to 
remove ISI altogether. 
A cyclic prefix acts as a guard interval, and it is added between each 
OFDM symbol. Typically it consists of a copy of the end part of the same 
OFDM symbol. It is added in the beginning of the symbol at the transmit-
ter and removed at the receiver, all while removing possible ISI effects (see 
Figure 4.5). The guard interval should be longer than the length of the

longest ISI period expected. Note that the guard interval should not be 
longer than necessary, since too long a guard interval is channel capacity 
wasted, after all.
The guard interval could also be empty if we were interested only in 
the ISI removal. However, by using a cyclic prefix to fill the guard interval, 
the resulting signal is cyclically extended. Such a signal maintains the sub-
carrier orthogonality, which would be lost with empty guard intervals, and,

This section discusses the principles of OFDMA as it is defined and used in 
LTE. OFDMA as such is also used in LTE-A—the basic principles are the 
same in both cases. However, LTE-A contains other technical enhancements 
that will improve the capabilities of the system. These are briefly discussed 
in the end of the section.

OFDMA
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
OFDM is used differently in LTE downlink and uplink. We will first 
concentrate on the downlink, and the uplink is discussed in Section 4.3. 
Also, if not mentioned otherwise, the text here refers to the FDD mode. 
The OFDM principles are the same for the TDD mode, too, but the physi-
cal layer is inevitably somewhat different in FDD and TDD modes.
Figure 4.6 presents a simplified OFDM signal processing chain. Note 
that this is not a description of the whole LTE layer 1—that is a much more 
complex entity. This section describes only the OFDM principles; the LTE 
physical layer in general is then discussed in Chapter 5.
Since the OFDM scheme transmits the data via several narrowband 
subcarriers, the data bits have to first undergo a serial-to-parallel conver-
sion, one parallel stream for each subcarrier. Next an inverse-FFT (IFFT) 
algorithm transforms the modulated subcarriers from frequency domain 
to time domain samples. Fast Fourier transform (FFT) [3] and its inverse, 
IFFT, are widely used algorithms in engineering. FFT transforms the signal 
representation from the time domain to the frequency domain, and IFFT 
does the opposite. In case of OFDM, IFFT is used at the transmitter and 
FFT at the receiver.
After the IFFT function, the cyclic prefix is added. In the LTE physical 
layer, all timing is derived from the basic time unit Ts = 1/30720000 sec-
onds. The radio frame is then:
	
Tframe = 307200 * Ts = 10 ms	
Each radio frame is divided into 10 subframes, and each subframe fur-
ther divided into two slots. A subframe is 1 ms in duration and a slot is 0.5 
ms [2, 4]. A subframe is the smallest time unit that can be scheduled by the 
network scheduler (see Figure 4.7).
Futhermore, each slot is divided into symbols, either six or seven sym-
bols per slot. In the “normal” mode the slot contains seven symbols, and 
in the extended mode there are six symbols in every slot. In both cases

the effective symbol length Tu is the same, Tu = 2048 * Ts = 66.7 us. The 
cyclic prefix is added after every symbol, and for the first symbol in each 
slot (number #0) the cyclic prefix is Tcp = 160 * Ts = 5.2 us, while for the 
others (numbers 1–6) the length is Tcp = 144 * Ts = 4.7 us (see Figure 4.8).

These values are for the normal mode. In the extended mode the cyclic 
prefix is longer: Tcp-e = 512 * Ts = 16.7 us. The extended mode is to be 
used in situations where a large signal delay spread is expected. The mode to 
be used is signaled by the network. Note that the normal cyclic prefix can 
handle ISI resulting from delay spreads up to 1.4 km (speed of signal1 × 4.69 
µs = 1406m) difference in signal propagation paths. The extended mode cy-
clic prefix is much longer and can remove ISI effects until the propagation 
path length difference is 5 km (speed of signal x 16.7 µs = 5007m) [2, 4].
The cyclic prefix takes about 7.5 percent of the channel capacity in the 
normal mode. This is a significant slice of the overall capacity available, but it 
should not be considered as wasted capacity since the signal quality is much 
better if ISI does not cause problems, and it may be possible to employ 
higher order modulation schemes as a result.
In the OFDM air interface the number of subcarriers can vary between 
128 (with a 1.4-MHz frequency band) and 2048 (20-MHz band). The spac-
ing between subcarriers is 15 kHz. Not all subcarriers are used for data (e.g., 
the band’s “center” carrier, direct current (DC), is not used for anything and 
neither are the guard carriers on either side of the frequency band). The 
DC carrier is intentionally left empty because from the empty subcarrier 
the UE can identify the center of the frequency band. The guard carriers are 
used to minimize interference from adjacent frequency bands.
In the air interface the data to be transmitted is mapped into resource 
elements and resource blocks (see Figure 4.9). A resource block is a time-
frequency entity, consisting of one slot in the time domain and 12 subcarri-
ers in the frequency domain. In other words, a resource block is a 0.5 ms * 
180 kHz slice of the time-frequency space. The number of resource blocks 
on LTE bands vary from 6 (1.4-MHz band) to 100 (20-MHz band). The set 
of resource blocks over the whole band is called the resource grid. If several 
antenna ports are used (i.e., if MIMO is employed), then each antenna port 
has its own resource grid.
A resource block is built of resource elements. One resource element 
consists of one symbol on one frequency subcarrier. A resource element 
is the smallest resource unit that can be addressed and allocated in the air 
interface, though when it comes to scheduling resources to users, the unit 
used is a resource block. All together, a resource block contains 12 * 7 = 84 
1.

resource elements (or 12 * 6 = 72 resource elements in case the extended 
cyclic prefix is employed) [2].
The air interface resource scheduling is controlled by the MAC layer in 
eNodeB. Both uplink and downlink shared channels have their own sched-
ulers. The smallest scheduling time unit for user services is one TTI, which 
is two successive resource blocks (i.e., 12 subcarriers * 1 subframe). The 
actual scheduling algorithm itself is not standardized; it is up to eNodeB 
vendor to implement as efficient a scheduler as possible. However, its work-
ing principle is that it will collect information on channel conditions and 
data transmission requests, and, based on this information, it assigns suitable 
subcarriers for each user so that the overall system throughput is maximized.

It can also modify other parameters such as the channel modulation and 
coding rate separately for each resource block. More about the scheduling 
can be found in Chapter 6, MAC Layer.
4.3  LTE Uplink—SC-FDMA
One problem with OFDM, as used in the LTE downlink, is its high peak 
to average power ratio (PAPR). In theory at least it is possible that all sub-
carriers use the maximum power level simultaneously, and as a result the 
combined carrier can have a very high power level. This can be handled at 
the base station transmitter (i.e., on the downlink), but for user equipment 
(UE), a high PAPR means inefficient power amplifier performance and thus 
short battery life. Therefore for the LTE uplink, another technique called 
single-carrier FDMA (SC-FDMA) has been chosen.
SC-FDMA is a hybrid scheme that combines the low PAPR of a single 
carrier system with many advantages of an OFDM system. Figure 4.10 
shows the high-level block diagram of the SC-FDMA processing chain. As 
one can see, it is very similar to OFDM, except that in the beginning of the 
transmission chain the time-based signal is converted to a frequency-based 
signal using FFT. This has the effect of spreading the information bits onto 
all subcarriers, instead of the downlink OFDM where bits are sent in paral-
lel, in separate subcarriers. As a consequence of this spreading, the PAPR 
experienced will be much smaller. Those subcarriers not used for uplink 
transmission will be set to zero. The FFT function is then followed by much 
of the same processing chain as with OFDM. IFFT is used to convert the 
signal to time domain, and after that cyclic prefixes are added in a similar 
way as in OFDM. The three resource concepts (resource element, resource 
block, and resource grid) are defined in exactly the same way as in OFDM. 
Also the subcarrier spacing is 15 kHz in both in OFDM and in SC-FDMA.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
The SC-FDMA receiver block diagram is a mirror image of the transmitter 
diagram.
In addition to saving power, SC-FDMA has some other advantageous 
features:
•• Since data bits are spread over wide channels, it offers some level of 
frequency diversity.
•• SC-FDMA is not as sensitive to frequency offset as OFDM.
•• Lower complexity transmitter (important for UEs).
4.4  Summary of OFDMA
As seen in this chapter, OFDM has many good qualities and that is why it 
was chosen as the air interface technology for LTE. The list of advantages 
includes the following issues, among others:
1.	 Using orthogonal subcarriers means that the subcarriers can be 
packed tightly, resulting in high spectral efficiency.
2.	 Orthogonality also means no intercarrier interference, and no need 
for intercarrier guard bands.
3.	 Long symbol time and guard intervals remove intersymbol 
interference.
4.	 OFDM is flexible on spectrum bands: it can exploit both relatively 
narrow and very wide bands.
5.	 The large number of subcarriers enables the use of efficient sched-
uling algorithms, whereby each user is allocated the best nonfading 
subcarriers/resource blocks from the time/frequency space.
6.	 Implementing OFDM is easy with FFT/IFFT algorithms.
7.	 Suitable for use when implementing single-carrier networks (for 
services such as MBMS).
However, it was also pointed out that the basic OFDM has some disad-
vantages. The two most important ones are:
1.	 Sensitive to frequency offset;
2.	 High peak-to-average power.
The first problem may cause the loss of subcarrier orthogonality, which 
in turn will introduce lots of interference from adjacent subcarriers (ICI). To 
overcome this, OFDM transmission contains two types of signals that can

be used for frequency estimation: synchronization signals and cell-specific 
reference signals [2, 5]. These are discussed in Section 5.5.1.
High PAPR, which was discussed in Section 4.3, would be a serious 
problem for UE transmitters, and therefore LTE uplink uses a modified 
form of OFDM called SC-FDMA.
In the next chapter we will continue with the LTE air intrface.

Chapter 5
Air Interface: Physical Layer
5.1  Introduction
In this chapter we will continue to handle the air interface. The previous 
chapter already presented OFDM and SC-FDMA basics, and now we are 
looking at other air interface details: starting with the physical layer and in 
the following chapters continuing with protocol layers, protocols, and the 
typical procedures that can take place in this interface.
The air interface is well specified—every single detail in it has to be 
agreed and put into standards because this interface is truly open. There are 
many radio access network equipment vendors and numerous user equip-
ment manufacturers, and all of these devices have to work seamlessly to-
gether over the air interface.
LTE follows a layered protocol model as shown in Figure 5.1, with de-
fined interfaces between layers. However, it is good to remember that these 
interlayer interfaces are internal interfaces for UEs and eNodeBs; they are 
not open interfaces such as the air interface. They are not standardized, and 
the manufacturer may implement them in the most appropriate way. Also 
the functionality in protocol layers may be customized (e.g., sometimes 
it may be more efficient to move some functionality to another protocol 
layer).
There are three separate channel concepts in LTE: physical, transport, 
and logical channels (see Figure 5.2).
Logical channels define what type of data is transferred. These channels 
define the data transfer services offered by the MAC layer; that is, the con-
cept of logical channels is used in the interface above the MAC.
Transport channels define how and with which type of characteristics 
the data is transferred by the physical layer. These channels are used in the 
interface between the MAC and the physical layers.
Physical channels define the exact physical characteristics of the radio 
channels. These are the channels used below the physical layer; that is, in the 
air interface.

5.2  Physical Layer—General
The lowest layer in the air interface is the physical layer. It is the first entity 
facing the air interface in the user terminal and in the eNodeB, transmitting 
and receiving bit streams. Therefore, its functions are closely coupled with 
the air interface timing, indicating that its processes are usually tightly time 
constrained. That is, the physical layer must react on inputs and perform its 
tasks very quickly. This is also the reason why the physical layer is typically 
implemented in hardware, as opposed to software running on a CPU, as 
hardware implementations are much quicker.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
As discussed in Chapter 4, the air interface technologies in the down-
link and uplink are slightly different. Also, the physical layer entities in the 
UE and in the eNodeB are different, especially implementationwise. The 
eNodeB can use more computational-intensive solutions, more complex 
receiver algorithms, bigger processors, and—especially important—there is 
no shortage of electric power. The UE, on the other hand, is a mass-pro-
duced device where each component has gone through a strict cost-per-
formance analysis (i.e., its components can fulfill the task they are designed 
to do but no more). These handheld devices are typically battery powered; 
therefore, energy saving is essential.
The air interface frame structure for the FDD mode was briefly dis-
cussed in Chapter 4. However, since the TDD mode has a different struc-
ture, both frame types are discussed next.
In the FDD mode each radio frame (10 ms) is divided into 10 sub-
frames, and each subframe further divided into two slots [1]. A subframe is 1 
ms in duration and a slot is 0.5 ms. A subframe is the smallest unit that can 
be scheduled by the network scheduler. The FDD mode radio frame is also 
known as the type 1 frame (see Figure 5.3). The FDD mode can be either 
half-duplex or full-duplex, depending on UE capabilities. A UE that can 
transmit and receive simultaneously is a full-duplex UE. If it can do only 
one of them at a time, then the device is a half-duplex UE. Note that in the 
FDD mode, the uplink and the downlink use different frequencies.
In the TDD mode, a type 2 frame is used. Each 10 ms radio frame con-
sists of two 5-ms half-frames. Moreover, each half-frame consists of eight 
0.5-ms slots. In addition, a half-frame has three special fields in a special sub-
frame: downlink pilot time slot (DwPTS), guard period (GP), and uplink 
pilot time slot (UpPTS). The total length of DwPTS, GP, and UpPTS fields 
together is 1 ms (see Figure 5.4).
Both 5-ms and 10-ms switch-point periodicities are supported. The 
switch-point periodically indicates how often the transmission switches 
between the uplink and the downlink. Note that even though the TDD 
mode is inherently suitable for asymmetric data connections, in LTE there 
are only seven different uplink-downlink configurations for the eNodeB to

choose from. Table 5.1 shows the various uplink-downlink combinations 
for both periodicity values. 
Subframe 1 is always a special subframe (i.e., the switching point), and 
in addition subframe 6 is also a special subframe when 5 ms switch-point 
periodicity is used. Subframes 0 and 5 are always reserved for the downlink, 
and subframe 2 for the uplink.

•• Rate matching and channel interleaving;
•• Scrambling;
•• Modulation;
•• Layer mapping and precoding;
•• Mapping to assigned resources and antenna ports.
See Figure 5.5 for the physical layer downlink data path. These steps 
are discussed in detail in the following sections. The data processing in 
the uplink direction follows the same principles and will not be discussed 
separately.
5.3.1  CRC Insertion
Physical downlink shared channel (PDSCH) is the main physical channel 
for carrying user data in the downlink direction. The physical layer gets the 
data in transport blocks from the MAC layer, at a rate of maximum of two 
data blocks per TTI. The first task for the physical layer is to calculate and at-
tach cyclic redundancy check (CRC) bits to the block. The CRC is a form 
of a block code for error checking at the receiver.
A block code manipulates the data one block at a time. The encoder 
adds some redundant bits to the block of bits, and the decoder uses them 
to determine whether an error has occurred during the transmission. If an 
error is found, the receiving entity can ask for a retransmission of the same 
data. The CRC bits are then discarded at the receiver. The more CRC bits 
there are, the better the code is to detect errors. But the added redundancy 
also consumes bandwidth, so a good balance must be found.
In the LTE PDSCH, the length of CRC is 24 bits per block. The other 
channels in LTE may also use CRC lengths of 16 and 8 bits. Even the 24-
bit CRC in LTE has two versions, A and B, depending on what kind of 
generator polynomial is used to calculate the CRC parity bits. The poly-
nomials used in LTE are given in Table 5.2. The PDSCH uses gCRC24A(D) 
polynomial.
For example, the CRC generator polynomial D8 + D7 + D4 + D3 + 
D + 1 means that the polynomial bit string is 110011011. The data block is 
divided modulo 2 by the generator polynomial, and the remainder becomes

the checksum field. The data block size can be between 40 and 6,144 bits. If 
there are less than 40 bits to send, then the data block has to be padded with 
filler bits. If there are more bits to send than the maximum code block size 
(6,144 bits), then the bit sequence is segmented into smaller data blocks and 
an additional sequence of CRC bits is attached to each block.
Because CRC and other block codes are typically used with retrans-
mission schemes, they cannot be used with channels that have very tight 
timing constraints because there is no time to wait for a retransmission. 
CRC insertion is specified in [3].
5.3.2  Channel Coding
In addition to error checking performed by the block coding function, the 
LTE employs two forward error correction (FEC) schemes: convolutional 
codes and turbo codes [3]. The difference between a block code and a FEC 
function is that whereas the block code simply indicates to the receiver 
whether or not the data block was received correctly, FEC codes try to fix 
the errors found, up to a certain point. FEC codes achieve this capability by 
adding redundancy to transmitted data. The ratio between the number of 
input bits and the number of output bits from the coding function is called 
the coding rate. In LTE, most channels use coding rate of 1/3. That is, after 
the channel coding, there are three times more bits to be transmitted. There-
fore, channel coding should not be used unnecessarily, and a suitable code 
rate should be carefully considered.
Both the turbo coding and the convolutional coding that are used in 
LTE produce so called systematic code, as opposed to nonsystematic code. 
In a systematic code, all redundant (or parity) bits are added to the end of 
the codeword, whereas in nonsystematic code the redundant bits are mixed 
with information bits at the coding function output. Both in the turbo cod-
ing and in the convolutional coding, the output has three streams: the first 
stream contains the information bits, and the two other streams have parity 
bits. However, as explained later, these streams will be combined after chan-
nel coding in the rate matching function.

5.3.2.1  Turbo Codes
Turbo codes are a relatively new invention, first discussed in 1993 [4]. They 
are found to be very efficient, because they can perform close to the theo-
retical limit set by the Shannon Law [5].
In turbo coding, the output of the decoding process is used to readjust 
the input data. This iterative process improves the quality of the decoder 
output, although the returns from the process diminish with every iterative 
loop. The turbo encoder specified in the LTE is shown in Figure 5.6. This 
encoder is a parallel concatenated convolutional code (PCCC). It consists of 
two convolutional encoders in parallel separated by an interleaver. The en-
coders are recursive and systematic. The task of the interleaver is to random-
ize the data before it enters the second encoder. The interleaver consists of a 
rectangular matrix. It performs both intra-row and inter-row permutations 
for the input bits, and the output bit sequence is pruned by deleting these 
bits, which were not part of the input bit sequence. The last phase of turbo 
encoding is called Trellis termination. It is performed by taking the tail bits 
from the shift register feedback after all information bits are encoded. Tail 
bits are padded after the encoding of information bits. The output of the 
Trellis termination stage is three bit streams.
The turbo decoder is depicted in Figure 5.7. It consists of two soft input 
soft output (SISO) decoders connected by interleavers and a de-interleaver. 
The extrinsic information is relayed back from the output of the second de-
coder to the input of the first decoder. Each iteration improves the estimate 
of the extrinsic information, which again improves the estimate for the de-

coded data. The data is processed in the iterative loop on a block-by-block 
basis. 
5.3.2.2  Convolutional Codes
Convolutional codes are different from block codes in that they operate 
continuously on streams of data. They also have a memory, which means 
that the output bits do not depend only on the current input bits, but also 
on several preceeding input bits. A convolutional code can therefore be de-
scribed using the format (n, k, m), where n is the number of output bits per 
data word, k is the number of input bits, and m is the length of the coder 
memory. The code rate of the convolutional code is thus similar to block 
codes:

(5.1)
The convolutional coder adopted by LTE is shown in Figure 5.8. It is 
a combination of shift registers (D) and exclusive-OR functional units. In 
the end of the data sequence to be encoded, the convolutional coder adds 
m-1 zeros to the output sequence. This is done periodically to force the en-
coder back to its initial state. This technique improves the error protection 
for the encoded bits at the end of the message. The structure of the encoder

is rather simple and its operation straightforward. The decoder, however, is 
something completely different.
The optimal convolutional decoder is the maximum likelihood se-
quence estimator (MLSE) [6], which is based on the idea that for a finite 
sequence of bits, the receiver generates all possible sequences the encoder 
could possibly have sent. Next, the receiver compares the actual received 
bit sequence with each of the generated sequences and calculates the Ham-
ming distance for each pair. The minimum Hamming distance should iden-
tify the most likely transmitted sequence.
The MLSE method provides the most efficient convolutional code de-
coder, but the problem is that once the size of the transmitted bit sequences 
increases, the complexity of the MLSE algorithm becomes unmanageable. 
A solution to this problem is to use the Viterbi algorithm, which estimates 
the MLSE algorithm well enough still to be efficient.
The actual theories behind the MLSE and Viterbi algorithms are out-
side the scope of this book. However, convolutional codes and maximum 
likelihood decoders are explained well in [7].
Convolutional decoders can be either hard or soft decision decoders. 
This division refers to the way the decoders receive the bit information 
from the demodulator. In the hard decision method, the demodulator out-
put is either a 0 or 1. In the soft decision method, the demodulator returns 
not only the received bit (0 or 1), but also an estimation of the reliability 
of this decision. The estimation can be based on such things as the current 
received signal level. The decoder can then use the estimation data as one 
parameter in its maximum likelihood decoding algorithm.
Convolutional decoders work well against random errors, but they are 
quite vulnerable to bursts of errors, which are typical in mobile radio sys-
tems. This problem can be eased with interleaving, which spreads the er-
roneous bits over a longer period of time and thus makes the convolutional 
decoder more efficient.

5.3.2.3  Summary
The channel coding schemes used in LTE are given in Tables 5.3 and 5.4. 
Note that on some physical channels in LTE, both FEC and block codes are 
used. First the channel decoder (either a convolutional or turbo decoder) 
tries to correct as many errors as possible, and then the block decoder (CRC 
check) gives its judgment on whether the resulting information is good 
enough to be used in the higher layers.
Convolutional coding can be used for low data rates, and turbo cod-
ing for higher rates. At higher bit rates, turbo coding is more efficient than 
convolutional coding. Turbo coding is not suitable for low rates, as it does 
not perform well on short blocks of data.
5.3.3  Physical-Layer Hybrid-ARQ Processing
The hybrid automatic repeat request (HARQ), the retransmission scheme 
adopted by LTE, is mainly a MAC sublayer procedure. However, the CRC 
check is done in the physical layer, and therefore part of the HARQ func-
tionality is there, namely the transmission of ACK/NACK indications. 
Note that a HARQ retransmission is not simply a retransmission of a stored 
packet. If a retransmission is needed, then the packet must be reconstructed 
in the rate matching function.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
For the downlink data packets, the acknowledgments are sent on up-
link PUCCH or PUSCH. For the uplink data, the same acknowledgments 
are sent on the downlink PHICH. See [2, 8] for details, which are rather 
complex.
5.3.4  Rate Matching and Channel Interleaving
The number of bits on a transport channel can vary with every transmission 
time interval—many applications generate variable bits rates. However, the 
allocated physical channel radio resources must be completely filled. The 
adjustment of the generated bit rate to the available bit rate is called rate 
matching.
Rate matching is depicted in Figure 5.9. The process is slightly differ-
ent for turbo coded and convolutionally coded channels, but this top-level 
diagram applies to both cases.
The input to the rate matching is the output of the channel coding 
function. Three bitstreams are interleaved separately in a sub-block inter-
leaver. The interleaver is a simple process whereby the bits are written into a 
matrix row by row, then the columns of the matrix are permutated accord-
ing to a fixed pattern, and finally the bits are read again column by column. 
The matrix has always 32 columns, but the number of rows depends on the 
number of bits to be sent.
Next, the bit collection process simply combines the three bit streams 
that are the outputs of individual subblock interleavers, and the result is 
inserted into a circular buffer. Note that even at this stage of processing, the 
systematic bits are still in the beginning of the buffer, and the parity bits 
come in the end.
Bit selection and pruning is then the stage where the actual rate match-
ing is done. Typically the number of bits from the channel coding process 
is larger than the allocated capacity, so some bits have to be punctured, or 
pruned (if there is more capacity than bits, then some bits can be duplicated). 
In principle, the systematic bits are more important than parity bits, and 
thus parity bits are what should be punctured. However, if excessive punc-
turing is applied to parity bits, the effective minimum Hamming distance

of the punctured code can degrade at high code rates. Therefore, a small 
amount of systematic bit puncturing is adopted in LTE rate matching for 
turbo codes; this applies to about 6 percent of systematic bits.
Rate-matching function must also incorporate HARQ functionality. In 
case a negative ack was received, indicating that a data packet was received 
with errors, a retransmission must take place. The new transmission is not 
simply a retransmission of the old data packet, but the rate-matching func-
tion must make sure that each retransmission punctures different bits from 
the packet. This can easily be achieved with the help of the circular buffer. 
In case of a retransmission, the “starting point” for the bit selection and 
pruning function from the circular buffer is different from the original one, 
and this starting point changes with each successive retransmission. If the 
end of the buffer is reached, the reading of bits continues from the begin-
ning of the buffer—thus the name circular buffer. From this we see that sys-
tematic bits do not get any preferential treatment in retransmitted packets, 
since they are no longer the first bits to be processed. The receiver will store 
all received packets, combine them, and try to decode the composite packet 
again. Therefore, the retransmission number (or redundancy version[RV], 
in the rate-matching process jargon) is an important parameter in the rate-
matching function (see Figure 5.10). Note that this figure depicts basically 
the same process as in Figure 5.9, but in more detail. Rate matching is also 
explained in [3].
Note that in the beginning of this section, in CRC calculation, the 
transport block was divided into several code blocks in case there were 
more than 6,144 bits in a transport block. These code blocks went through 
channel coding and rate-matching processes separately, but after rate match-
ing it is again time to combine the individual code blocks into a single 
codeword. This is done sequentially. It is also possible that the UE is config-
ured to receive two transport blocks in a transmission time interval; in this 
case, the result is two codewords.
5.3.5  Scrambling
The purpose of scrambling is to convert the input bit string into a pseudo-
random output bit string, thus removing as many long sequences of bits 
with similar values as possible. A long sequence of 1s or 0s might cause 
lots of problems at the receiver, especially the loss of timing synchroniza-
tion and interference due to spectral spikes. See [1] for further information. 
This reference explains the generic scrambling used in the downlink. How-
ever, some physical channels employ their own channel-specific scrambling, 
while the uplink has its own scrambling procedures.
The scrambling generator is initialized at the start of each subframe; 
thus, scrambling does not have a memory over subframe boundaries.

5.3.6  Modulation
It is easy to assume that in digital communication systems, we transmit bits, 
and each bit carries one piece of information in the form of one or zero. 
However, this is not the case. Modern wireless communication systems that 
employ digital modulation do not actually send digital bits; rather, they 
modulate an analog carrier signal in one way or another, and the items that 
are sent are called symbols. Each symbol can carry information from one or 
more bits, depending on the modulation scheme used.
A data-modulation scheme defines how the data bits are mixed with 
the carrier signal, which is always a sine wave. There are three basic ways to 
modulate a carrier signal in a digital sense: amplitude shift keying (ASK), 
frequency shift keying (FSK), and phase shift keying (PSK).
In ASK the amplitude of the carrier signal is modified (multiplied) by 
the digital signal. The modulated signal can be given as:

In FSK the frequency of the carrier signal is modified by the digital 
signal. If the digital signal has only two symbols, 0 or 1, this means that in 
the basic FSK scheme, the transmission switches between two frequencies 
to account for multilevel FSK. For mathematically minded people:

There are several variants in the PSK family. In binary phase shift keying 
(BPSK) modulation, each data bit is transformed into a separate data sym-
bol. The mapping rule is 1 -> + 1 and 0 -> - 1. There are only two possible 
phase shifts in BPSK, 0 and π radians (see Figure 5.11).
The quaternary phase shift keying (QPSK) modulation has four phases: 
0, 1/2 π, π, 3/2 π radians. Two data bits are transformed into one complex 
data symbol; for example, (00 -> + 1 + j), (01 -> - 1 + j), (11 -> - 1 - j), 
(10 -> + 1 - j). A symbol is any change (keying) of the carrier.
Generally, M-ary PSK has M phases, given as 2πm/M; m = 0, 1, …, 
M - 1.
Minimum shift keying (MSK) is a modification of QPSK. The GSM 
system uses Gaussian minimum shift keying (GMSK) modulation.
The number of times the signal parameter (amplitude, frequency, or 
phase) is changed per second is called the signaling rate or the symbol rate. 
It is measured in baud: 1 baud = 1 change per second. With binary modu-
lations such as ASK, FSK, and BPSK, the signaling rate equals the bit rate. 
With QPSK and M-ary PSK, the bit rate exceeds the baud rate.
LTE uses four different modulation schemes: BPSK, QPSK, 16QAM 
(Figure 5.12), and 64QAM (Figure 5.13). The number of bit each symbol 
can carry in these schemes is given in Table 5.5.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Note that the modulation schemes in LTE belong to two different 
modulation families. BPSK and QPSK are pure phase-shift keying modu-
lation schemes, whereas 16QAM and 64QAM schemes combine features 
from both phase-shift and amplitude-shift keying schemes. BPSK and 
QPSK are more robust modulation schemes, and they can be used in situa-
tions where the amount of data transferred is small, but its error-free deliv-
ery is important. On the other hand, 16QAM and 64QAM can carry large 
amounts of information, but 64QAM especially requires very good channel 
conditions before it can be successfully employed.
BPSK is used only on some control channels: physical hybrid ARQ 
indicator channel (PHICH), and in some formats of physical uplink control 
channel (PUCCH).
QPSK is used on all other control channels where BPSK is not used. 
It provides a robust enough modulation for control channels that do not a 
require lots of transfer capacity. It can also be used on data channels if the 
radio conditions are difficult.
In addition, 16QAM and 64QAM are only used on data channels, and 
only when the radio conditions are good enough for their use. 64QAM is

optional in the uplink. As seen from Figure 5.13, these schemes are error-
prone in weak radio environment. For example, in 64QAM, it is hard to 
differentiate constellation points 000110 and 000111 at the receiver if the 
reception is not perfect.
The scheduling scheme used is decided by the scheduler at the eNo-
deB, and it can change dynamically even at every TTI. The value employed 
is signaled in a parameter called the modulation and coding scheme (MCS).

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
5.3.7  Layer Mapping and Precoding
Layer mapping is a process of dividing the data so that it can be transmit-
ted via several antennas in a multiantenna system. Note that a layer and an 
antenna are not synonymous. The number of layers can be less than or equal 
to the number of transmit antennas. Lets go through this phase by phase 
because understanding the relationship between layers and physical antennas 
is not clear even for many 3GPP specialists.
Layer is a somewhat abstract concept that defines how many simultane-
ous data streams there are to be transmittted. The number of layers can vary 
between 1 and 8. Layer mapping then defines how individual codewords (1 
or 2) are mapped into layers. If there is only one layer, then this is easy: the 
single codeword is mapped onto the single layer. Note that it is not pos-
sible to have two codewords and a single layer. The number of codewords is 
always smaller than the number of layers, and the number of layers is always 
smaller than the number of antenna ports. A single codeword can be divided 
between (up to) four layers, and two codewords between (up to) eight lay-
ers. See Table 5.6 for clarification.
As a special case, if transmit diversity is employed instead of spatial mul-
tiplexing, then the number of codewords is one, and it can be mapped into 
two or four layers.
Precoding is the next process after layer mapping. Generally, in wireless 
systems, the capacity of the transmission link is much higher if the transmit-
ter knows the channel state information and thus can adapt the transmission 
parameters accordingly (e.g., by selecting a suitable channel coding rate and

a modulation scheme). Usually this is accomplished by the receiver measur-
ing the channel and then reporting the measurement results back to the 
transmitter.
With multiple antenna systems, this approach becomes increasingly dif-
ficult when the number of antennas increases. A 2x2 MIMO system has 4 
individual component channels to measure and report, a 4x4 system has 
16 channels, and an 8x8 MIMO system should report the channel state 
information from 64 channels. This is a large amount of data that should be 
reported at once, or it will quickly become outdated and thus useless for 
the transmitter.
A solution that has been adopted by LTE uses so called codebooks. A 
codebook is a collection of predefined matrices, each indicating a certain 
type of channel state (or actually the transmission parameters that are suit-
able for this channel state). The receiver selects one of them, one that is the 
closest to the measured channel state information, and only signals back the 
index of the selected matrix. Again, the system designer needs to make a 
compromise between how large the codebook is (and thus how accurately 
it signals the channel state information) and the number of bits needed to 
signal the matrix index in the codebook.
Once the precoder in the transmitter knows the precoding matrix in-
dex to be used, it simply takes the block of symbol vectors from the layer 
mapping as an input and multiplies it with the precoding matrix.
Precoding is a wide topic, and it is further discussed in the MIMO 
section in Section 11.2. Layer mapping and precoding are specified in [1].
5.3.8  Mapping to Assigned Resources and Antenna Ports
Antenna port is an unfortunate term in LTE. It easily gives an impression of 
a physical entity, a port, to a physical antenna. However, antenna port in LTE 
is a logical concept that identifies a channel with separate characteristics 
and planned usage. Each antenna port has been defined a separate reference 
signal (RS), such as a UE-specific RS for multilayer beamforming, or a UE-
specific RS for single-layer beamforming. Reference [1] defines how layers 
are mapped into antenna ports. There are 27 antenna ports in the LTE-A 
Release 11 downlink. These are listed in Table 5.7.
Note that 3GPP specifications do not define how antenna ports are 
mapped to actual physical antennas. This is left for each base station manu-
facturer to decide.
5.4  Physical Channels in LTE-A
In this section we will discuss physical channels that are defined in LTE-A. 
Physical channels are used below the physical layer in the air interface, and

they define the exact physical characteristics of radio channels. Different 
physical channels have different characteristics, and they are used to carry 
different types of data. A physical channel is a logical concept in the sense 
that there are no separate frequency resources for different physical chan-
nels; all of them are sent using the same frequency channel. However, each 
of them is allocated a different set of resource blocks.
Uplink and downlink have different set of physical channels, defined in 
[1, 3]. We will first introduce the downlink channels.
5.4.1  Downlink Physical Channels
Physical Broadcast Channel (PBCH)
•• This channel carries the most important system information that the 
UE needs for accessing the cell. This information is defined in the Mas-
ter Information Block (MIB).
•• Other system information in System Information Blocks (SIB) is trans-
mitted on the PDSCH.
•• The data is modulated using QPSK.
•• Channel coding is the standard LTE convolutional block coding.
•• The scrambling sequence for PBCH is cell specific.
•• The PBCH is mapped on the central 72 subcarriers of the frequency 
band.
•• One PBCH transmission lasts 40 ms (i.e., the PBCH TTI is four radio 
frames).

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Physical Control Format Indicator Channel (PCFICH)
•• This channel informs the UE and the relay node about the number of 
OFDM symbols used for the PDCCHs (1, 2, 3, or 4).
•• The channel coding is unique to PCFICH: 32,2 block coding that is 
defined in [3, Section 5.3.4].
•• A PCFICH is transmitted on the first symbol of every subframe and 
carries a control format indicator (CFI) field.
•• The PCFICH is modulated using QPSK.
Physical Downlink Control Channel (PDCCH)
•• The physical downlink control channel carries scheduling assignments 
and other control information such as:
•	Downlink resource scheduling;
•	Uplink power control instructions;
•	Uplink resource grant;
•	Indication for paging or system information.
•• The PDCCH carries the downlink control information (DCI) field, 
which can adopt several different formats: type 0, 1, 1A, 1B, 1C, 1D, 2, 
2A, 2B, 2C, 2D, 3, 3A, and 4. This information can be UE specific, or it 
can apply to a group of UEs.
•• Channel coding is the standard LTE convolutional block coding.
•• Modulation is QPSK.
Enhanced Physical Downlink Control Channel (EPDCCH)
•• This physical channel type was introduced only in Release 11, but it can 
co-exist on the same carrier as Rel-8/9/10 UEs.
•• EPDCCH increases the downlink control channel capacity that might 
have become a bottleneck in LTE-A systems otherwise.
•• EPDCCH carries information on the resource allocation of DL-SCH, 
hybrid ARQ information related to DL-SCH, and the uplink schedul-
ing grant.
•• Channel coding is the standard LTE convolutional block coding.
•• The modulation scheme employed is QPSK.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Physical Hybrid ARQ Indicator Channel (PHICH)
•• Carries hybrid-ARQ ACK/NACKs in response to uplink data 
transmissions.
•• Channel coding is simply repeating the ACK/NACK bit (0 or 1) three 
times (i.e., the resulting codeword is either 000 or 111).
•• The modulation scheme employed is BPSK.
Physical Downlink Shared Channel (PDSCH)
•• This is the main data-carrying channel; it carries the DL-SCH and the 
PCH.
•• The channel coding is 1/3 rate turbo coding.
•• Modulation can be QPSK, 16QAM, or 64QAM.
•• Data transmitted on this channel goes through the whole processing 
chain that was explained earlier in this chapter.
Physical Multicast Channel (PMCH)
•• This channel carries the MCH.
•• No transmit diversity scheme is specified.
•• Layer mapping and precoding will be done assuming a single antenna 
port (antenna port 4).
•• This channel uses extended cyclic prefix.
•• Physical layer processing for PMCH is very similar to PDSCH, includ-
ing channel coding and modulation.
Relay Physical Downlink Control Channel (R-PDCCH)
•• This channel informs the relay node about the resource allocation for 
DL-SCH.
•• It carries hybrid ARQ information related to DL-SCH.
•• It carries the uplink scheduling grant.
•• The physical layer processing for R-PDCCH is very similar to PDCCH.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
5.4.2  Uplink Physical Channels
The uplink has fewer physical channel types than the downlink. This is 
understandable because typically the intelligence in the system lies in the 
eNodeB, and it needs to send lots of different types of control information 
to UEs via the air interface. On the other hand, the uplink control infor-
mation is mainly various indications and reports from UEs to the eNodeB.
Physical Uplink Control Channel (PUCCH)
•• This is the only control channel type in the uplink. It can carry three 
different types of information:
•	Hybrid ARQ ACKs and NACKs in response to downlink 
transmissions;
•	Scheduling requests (SR);
•	Channel state information (CSI) reports (i.e., measurement reports).
•• Like its downlink counterpart, PUCCH can adopt several different for-
mats: 1, 1A, 1B, 2, 2A, 2B, and 3 (see Table 5.8).
•• Channel coding depends on what kind of information the channel con-
tains (i.e., its PUCCH format).
•• The modulation scheme is BPSK or QPSK, depending on the PUCCH 
format.
Physical Uplink Shared Channel (PUSCH)
•• This is the uplink data channel, carrying the UL-SCH.
•• Channel coding is 1/3 rate turbo coding.
•• The modulation scheme is QPSK, 16QAM, or optionally 64QAM.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Physical Random Access Channel (PRACH)
•• This channel carries the random access preamble (i.e., the request from 
the UE to initiate a connection).
•• �There are four different preamble formats (five in the TDD mode) and 
64 different preambles in each cell.
5.5  Physical Layer Signals 
The physical layer also has several different types of signals. The difference 
between a physical channel and a physical layer signal is that a physical 
channel carries information, whereas a signal is the information in itself. A 
physical layer signal is never mapped to a higher layer channel, so it does not 
carry information originating from higher layers. Signals are defined in [1].
5.5.1  Downlink Signals
LTE downlink can have two different types of signals:
•• Reference signals;
•• Synchronization signals.
5.5.1.1  Reference Signals
Reference signals are used for channel estimation. A reference signal trans-
mits a known pattern, and by receiving this signal the UE can estimate what 
kind of imperfections the radio channel caused to the signal, and further it 
can exploit this information when receiving physical channels.
There are six different reference signals in the downlink:
•• Cell-specific reference signals (CRS);
•• MBSFN reference signals;
•• UE-specific reference signals (DM-RS) associated with PDSCH;
•• Demodulation reference signals (DM-RS) associated with EPDCCH;
•• Positioning reference signals (PRS);
•• CSI reference signals (CSI-RS).

82 
 
Air Interface: Physical Layer
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
There is one reference signal transmitted per downlink antenna port. 
The antenna ports and corresponding reference signals were given in Table 
5.7.
The downlink cell-specific reference signal is transmitted in the first 
and the third-last OFDM symbol of each slot for antenna ports 0 and 1. If 
the reference signal is additionally transmitted from antenna ports 2 and 3, 
then the second OFDM symbol of each slot is used. The mapping of cell-
specific reference signals to resource elements is depicted in Figure 5.14. 
Cell-specific reference signals are transmitted in all downlink subframes in 
a cell supporting PDSCH transmission.
MBSFN reference signals are transmitted in MBSFN subframes only 
when the PMCH is transmitted. MBSFN reference signals are transmitted 
on antenna port 4. They are spaced more “tightly” than other reference 
signals in the frequency domain (i.e., MBSFN reference signals are inserted 
in every other subcarrier), in the third, seventh, and eleventh OFDM sym-
bols as shown in Figure 5.15. MBSFN reference signals are defined for the 
extended cyclic prefix only.
UE-specific reference signals can be transmitted on antenna port(s) 5, 
7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14. The number of antenna ports depends on the 
layers used for the transmission of the PDSCH. The mapping of UE-spe-
cific reference signals is rather complex. The example in Figure 5.16 is for 
antenna port 5. Here the reference signals are transmitted on the fourth and 
seventh OFDM symbol in even-numbered slots, and on the third and sixth 
OFDM symbol in odd-numbered slots. Other antenna ports and frames 
with extended cyclic prefixes use different mapping as explained in [1].

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Demodulation reference signals associated with EPDCCH are a new 
reference signal type, only introduced in Release 11. They can be transmit-
ted from antenna ports 107, 108, 109, and 110; the exact number depends 
on how many layers are used. The mapping of reference signals to resource 
elements for antenna ports 107–110 is similar to mapping UE-specific ref-
erence signals for antenna ports 7–10.
Positioning reference signals (PRSs) are transmitted on antenna port 6 
as in Figure 5.17. They are used to improve the accuracy of the observed

time difference of arrival (OTDOA) positioning method. In this position-
ing method, the UE position is calculated based on the measured time dif-
ference of the arrival of reference signals from the serving cell and at least 
two neighboring cells. This sounds simple, but the problem is that the UE 
may not hear the standard reference signals from neighboring cells, espe-
cially if the UE is in the middle of the serving cell. Therefore positioning 
reference signals were introduced in Release 9. The purpose of PRSs is to 
improve the “hearability” of neighboring cells. PRS subframes do not over-
lap with PDCCH or cell-specific reference signals, and their transmission is 
not scheduled on the same subframes as PDSCH. PRSs are also transmitted 
on several successive subframes to improve their detection. Moreover, with 
the help of cell-specific frequency shifts, it is possible to define six different 
nonoverlapping PRS patterns for neighboring cells. This is also a very useful 
feature in increasing PRS hearability. If, despite this feature, there are still 
overlapping PRSs in neighboring cells, the network can order some cells 
to halt their PRS transmissions for a number of subframes. During these 
subframes, the hearability of the remaining (now nonoverlapping) PRS will 
improve. The positioning reference signals are not mapped to resource ele-
ments that are already allocated to the PBCH, primary synchronization 
signal (PSS), or secondary synchronization signal (SSS) regardless of their 
antenna port.
Channel state information (CSI) reference signals are used for obtain-
ing CSI estimation from up to eight antenna ports. CSI reference signals are 
transmitted on one, two, four, or eight antenna ports.

5.5.1.2  Synchronization Signals.
Synchronization signals are the first signals the UE needs to receive if it 
wants to camp into the network. The UE needs to receive PBCH in order 
to get vital information on the system. However, before it can do that, it has 
to synchronize itself with the eNodeB.
There are two types of synchronization signals: the primary synchro-
nization signal and the secondary synchronization signal. The PSS provides 
slot timing detection, and the SSS provides the radio frame timing detec-
tion. The synchronization signals are sent periodically, twice in a 10-ms 
radio frame. The PSS is sent in the last OFDM symbol of the first and 
eleventh slots of each radio frame. The SSS is transmitted in the preceding 
OFDM symbol, in both PSS occurrences.
The synchronization procedure itself is explained in Section 9.2 and 
that section also includes a more thorough handling of synchronization 
signals.
5.5.2  Uplink Signals
In the uplink direction there are only two reference signal types:
•• Demodulation reference signal, associated with the transmission of 
PUSCH or PUCCH;
•• Sounding reference signal, not associated with the transmission of 
PUSCH or PUCCH.
The demodulation reference signal is associated with transmission of 
PUSCH data or PUCCH control information. This reference signal is pro-
vided, as its name suggests, for channel estimation so that the eNodeB can 
demodulate the received data or control channel. There is one demodula-
tion reference signal in every uplink PUSCH or PUCCH slot.
In case of PUSCH (and normal cyclic prefix), the demodulation refer-
ence signal is added to the third symbol of each slot. In case of PUCCH, the 
situation is more complex because PUCCH itself does not have a standard 
single format but several PUCCH formats have been defined. Table 5.9 
shows the demodulation reference signal location for different PUCCH 
formats.
Sounding reference signals (SRS) are not associated with any particular 
channel. Instead they are used by the network to get channel quality infor-
mation, which is then used as a parameter in frequency-selective scheduling. 
The SRS, if used, is added in the last SC-FDMA symbol in a subframe. A 
SRS transmission is triggered by a request from the eNodeB. The request 
can indicate a single SRS transmission or periodic SRS transmissions.

Air Interface: Physical Layer
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
5.6  Summary
This chapter discussed the LTE air interface physical layer. We omitted 
OFDM-specific issues since those were already discussed in Chapter 4. In-
stead, this chapter concentrated on physical layer processing, which is for the 
most part surprisingly independent of the air interface access technology 
used.
The chapter started with a general overview of the physical layer, in-
cluding the radio frame structure for both FDD and TDD modes. However, 
the main content of the chapter is in Section 5.3, Physical Layer Processing. 
A diagram is presented, showing the main processing stages for downlink 
data packets received from higher layers, and then these stages are discussed 
one by one in separate subsections. Physical channels and physical layer sig-
nals were also presented in Sections 5.4 and 5.5, respectively.
The presentation in this chapter is mostly FDD-mode specific. How-
ever, the TDD mode in LTE is purposely kept very similar to the FDD 
mode whenever this has been possible. As proof of this, there are no separate 
sets of FDD and TDD mode physical layer specifications in LTE, whereas in 
UMTS we had 25.21x series specifications for the FDD mode, and 25.22x 
series for the TDD mode. In LTE, the 36.2xx series covers both modes.
It must again be stressed that the air interface physical layer is a very 
complex entity in LTE. This chapter discusses only the principles of the 
physical layer. The details and various optional functionality can then be 
studied from the specifications itself once the principles are understood. 
Also, because of Section 5.3, the discussion in this chapter is downlink-
centric. The physical layer in the uplink is different from the downlink, but 
the same principles apply to both. If the downlink is well understood, then 
there should be no problems with the uplink either.

Chapter 6
Air Interface: Protocol Stack
6.1  Introduction
This chapter continues from where the previous chapter ended. The air in-
terface protocol stack uses the services provided by the physical layer.
The protocol stack architecture is typically considered to consist of 
two different parts: control and user planes. The control plane carries con-
trol data (i.e., signaling data that is needed for the management of the UE 
connection and indeed for many tasks that take place already before a con-
nection is established). The user plane carries user data that originates from 
various applications, including voice calls. Whereas both planes have largely 
the same protocol tasks, their functions are very different. Particularly in 
LTE, the data rates can be very high, and therefore user plane functions have 
to be designed (and, especially, implemented) in a way that enables high data 
throughput.
Sometimes the air interface protocols are also divided into access stra-
tum (AS) and nonaccess stratum (NAS) protocols (see Figure 6.1). LTE has 
inherited this concept from UMTS. In principle, AS protocols are those that 
handle the radio access between the UE and the eNodeB. These protocols 
terminate in the RAN. The NAS includes core network (CN) protocols 
between the UE and the CN itself. These protocols are not terminated in 
the RAN, but in the CN; the eNodeB is transparent to the NAS. In prin-
ciple, NAS protocols are independent of the radio access technology below 
them—though in case of LTE this principle remains unexploited—the LTE 
access technology is only deployed with the LTE core network [1].
Since this chapter is about the radio interface, we will only concentrate 
on AS protocols here. NAS and NAS procotols (ESM and EMM) are briefly 
discussed in the core network chapter.
Figures 6.2 and 6.3 present the protocol layers in the air interface [2]. 
They are introduced one by one in following sections, in each case discuss-
ing both the user plane and control plane functionality. Note that radio 
resource control (RRC) is a pure control plane entity.

6.2  Medium Access Control (MAC)
6.2.1  MAC—General
MAC is the protocol task closest to the physical layer [3]. It works closely 
with the physical layer in many processes such as HARQ and random access. 
Indeed, the model of the MAC layer presented in 3GPP specifications and 
in this book is just a model. An equipment vendor is free to implement the 
physical layer and the MAC layer in a way it considers to be the most appro-
priate and efficient solution. The interface between the PHY and the MAC 
layers is not an open interface but a vendor-specific one. The functionality 
of these entities can be moved around, as long as the air interface conforms 
with the standard and remains an open interface. Because of its close rela-
tionship with the physical layer, many of MAC’s processes are tightly time 
constrained. MAC is configured by the RRC layer.
The MAC protocol is not a symmetrical protocol; the entities in the 
UE and in the eNodeB are different. This is due to the fact that in many 
ways, the UE acts as a slave and the eNodeB as a master in this relationship.

Air Interface: Protocol Stack
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
The UE provides measurement and scheduling information to the eNodeB, 
and, based on the information available, the eNodeB manages the UE. The 
MAC functionality in the UE is closely standardized, but the MAC layer 
specifications for the eNodeB have been left much more open. This is be-
cause the MAC scheduler is an especially important factor for the whole 
network performance. It was not seen as appropriate to restrict the imple-
mentation of the eNodeB by standards that were too detailed. Instead the 
equipment vendor and/or the network operator can fine-tune the eNodeB 
MAC layer more freely. Similar approach was not chosen for UEs because 
of the large number of different UE vendors and devices. That is, a network 
operator can trust itself to implement the eNodeB MAC properly, but it 
cannot trust that hundreds of UE manufacturers will do the same.
Note that relay nodes (RN) include the functionality of both the UE 
and the eNodeB MAC, since it needs the former to communicate with the 
eNodeB and the latter to communicate with the UE [2, 4].
Readers familiar with UMTS may recall that UMTS-MAC had several 
functional entities, such as MAC-b and MAC-c. LTE does not follow this 
convention anymore. Instead, Figure 6.4 shows a possible MAC structure 
at the UE side. 
The following functions are supported by the MAC protocol layer:
•• Mapping between logical channels and transport channels;
•• Multiplexing of MAC SDUs;
•• Demultiplexing of MAC SDUs;
•• Scheduling information reporting;
•• Error correction through HARQ;
•• Priority handling between UEs;
•• Priority handling between logical channels of one UE;
•• Logical channel prioritization;
•• Padding;
•• Transport format selection.
Note that this list includes MAC functionality both in the UE and in 
the eNodeB. Table 6.1 shows how these functions are divided between the 
UE and the eNodeB, and between downlink and uplink.
This list does not include all tasks done by a MAC layer. A given UE (or 
eNodeB) function typically involves several protocol tasks, and sometimes it 
is difficult to define which layer “owns” this functionality.
We will briefly explain the meaning of the functions from Table 6.1 in 
following sections.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Multiplexing means combining data from several different (or indeed 
from the same) logical channels onto transport blocks (TB) to be delivered 
to the physical layer on transport channels. Demultiplexing is its mirror 
process at the other end of the transmission link. The channels that can be 
multiplexed together are shown in Figure 6.4. The actual multiplexing con-
figuration (i.e., how much data and from which channels are multiplexed 
together and transmitted in each TTI) is controlled by the RRC layer.
Logical channel prioritization takes place in the uplink direction. The 
RRC layer assigns priority parameters for each logical channel, and the 
scheduling of uplink data is based on these parameters; the channels with 
higher priority are served first. This is a two-stage process: in the first round 
each channel is allocated capacity based on its prioritized bit rate (PBR) 
value, in the order of the channel priority parameter. If, after all channels 
with buffered data have been allocated their PBR capacity, there is still 
unused capacity left, then the UE will allocate that capacity in the channel 
priority order until all capacity has been used. This two-stage approach tries 
to prevent a situation where a lower-capacity channel never gets its data 
through if there is data buffered in higher-priority channels. See an example 
in Figure 6.5. The data is added to the MAC PDU in the order shown; first 
the PBR data in blocks numbered 1–4, and then additional non-PBR data 
in blocks numbered 5 and 6.
Transport format selection is a process that happens in the eNodeB 
only, for both the downlink and the uplink. After selecting a suitable trans-
port format, the eNodeB then sends the information to the UE, to be used 
in the uplink transmissions. Transport format defines with what kind of

characteristics the data is sent over the air interface. Transport format indi-
cates parameters such as channel coding, modulation, and interleaving. In 
fact, the term transport format is rarely used in LTE specifications (whereas 
this term is everywhere in UMTS standards). An interested reader looking 
for further information is advised to look instead for terms downlink control 
information (DCI) and especially modulation and coding scheme (MCS) within 
the DCI. DCI comes in many different formats, which are suitable for dif-
ferent situations. Uplink grants (and MCS) and sent using DCI formats 0 or 
4. Format 0 is for normal channels; format 4 for MIMO channels. For the 
downlink, there are several DCI formats [5]. DCI is carried on the physical 
downlink control channel (PDCCH). In the downlink the new transport 
format received via DCI applies to the next transport block, but for uplink 
the DCI 0/4 applies only to subframe n+4 where n is the current subframe. 
This delay is necessary so that the UE has some time to process the outgo-
ing data appropriately. Note that the new DCI information will not neces-
sarily be sent in every subframe. DCI allocation can also be semipersistent. 
Semipersistent scheduling can take place when the same amount of data is 
sent from subframe to subframe. In this case, the eNodeB can configure the

UE to use the same transport format until advised otherwise. Semipersistent 
scheduling is expected to be used with the VoIP service especially.
Scheduling information reporting is an important task for the UE. It 
has to provide the eNodeB with information that can be used in eNodeB’s 
MAC scheduler. This information includes the amount of data in UE’s buf-
fers and other information added to MAC PDU headers.
If there is not enough data to use all the allocated resources, then pad-
ding will be used to fill the PDU with dummy bits.
6.2.2  Transport Channels
Transport channels define how and with which type of characteristics the 
data is transferred by the physical layer. These channels are used in the in-
terface between the MAC and the physical layer. All transport channel types 
are unidirectional; they exist either in the downlink or in the uplink but not 
in both.
The mapping of transport channels to physical channels is pretty 
straightforward (see Figures 6.6 and 6.7). These figures depict the situation 
from the UE point of view (i.e., they show the UE uplink and the UE 
downlink channel mapping) [5].
As seen, some of the physical channels do not map to any transport 
channels. Instead, they are transport control information such as uplink 
control information (UCI), downlink control information (DCI), hybrid 
ARQ indicator (HI), and control format indicator (CFI).
6.2.2.1  Downlink Transport Channels
Broadcast Channel (BCH)
The BCH carries the most important system information, the master in-
formation block (MIB), which informs the UE about the configuration of 
the cell. This information is needed for the UE so that it can access the cell,

read more system information via other channels, and set up a connection. 
Without a successful reception of the MIB, the UE cannot use any services 
of the cell. The transport format used in this channel is static so the UE does 
not need to decode anything else in order to receive the MIB. There is also 
a requirement that this channel has to be broadcast over the whole cell area. 
The BCH channel maps to PBCH in the physical layer.
Downlink Shared Channel (DL-SCH)
This transport channel is the main data transfer channel for the downlink. 
DL-SCH can carry several different logical channel types, including both 
data and control channels. Notably, the non-MIB parts of the system infor-
mation, the system information blocks (SIB), are transmitted on DL-SCH. 
This channel can use the whole toolbox of MAC procedures and functions 
in order to provide efficient data transfer services, including HARQ, adap-
tive modulation and coding (AMC), discontinuous reception (DRX), and 
multiple input multiple output (MIMO) antenna techniques.
This channel maps to PDSCH in the physical layer.
Paging Channel (PCH)
Like the BCH, the PCH also needs to be transmitted over the whole cell 
area. Paging channel carries paging information (i.e., notifications of in-
coming user data). In order to receive this user data, the UE has to set up a 
connection using the random access procedure. The UE should monitor the 
PCH regularly so that it does not miss any incoming connection requests. 
However, continuous monitoring is not necessary because PCH supports 
the DRX scheme whereby the PCH channel for this particular UE is sent 
only on certain times. This is an important feature that saves power and in-

creases the UE standby time because the UE can go to sleep mode outside 
the scheduled PCH transmission periods.
In addition to connection requests, the PCH also carries indications 
that the system information has been modified and thus the UE should 
re-read it from the DL-SCH, or that a new public warning system (PWS) 
message is available via SIB on the DL-SCH. PWS carries, for example, 
warnings on natural disasters. These warnings are sent on SIB 10/11 in 
case of the Earthquake and Tsunami Warning System (ETWS, the Japanese 
PWS system), or on SIB12 in case of the Commercial Mobile Alert Sys-
tem (CMAS, the North American System), the Korean Public Alert System 
(KPAS, the Korean system), or the EU-Alert (the European Union system).
This channel maps to PDSCH in the physical layer (i.e., there is no 
dedicated physical paging channel).
Multicast Channel (MCH)
This transport channel carries MBMS information, either control or user 
data, that requires MBSFN combining (i.e., the data is broadcast over multi-
ple cells). Note that the other type of MBMS data (“the single-cell MBMS”) 
can be transmitted over DL_SCH.
This channel maps to PMCH in the physical layer.
Note that there is no dedicated MAC layer downlink control channel. 
MAC control information is received via higher layer (RRC) signaling or 
via MAC PDU headers.
6.2.2.2  Uplink Transport Channels
Uplink Shared Channel (UL-SCH)
This transport channel is the main channel for uplink data transfer. In fact, 
all uplink logical channels use UL-SCH as their transport channel. Like its 
downlink counterpart, UL-SCH can employ HARQ, AMC, and MIMO.
This channel maps to PUSCH in the physical layer.
Random Access Channel (RACH)
This channel is used for random access. It has to be used when the UE still 
does not have uplink timing synchronization or allocated uplink resources. 
RACH can carry only a very limited amount of data, and because of the 
type of the channel there is always a risk of collisions with RACH transmis-
sions from other UEs.
This channel maps to PRACH in the physical layer. Transport channels 
are also discussed in [2].

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
6.3  Radio Link Control (RLC)
6.3.1  RLC—General
The RLC task is simpler than MAC, at least when it comes to functionality. 
In general, the RLC layer is in charge of the actual data packet, containing 
either control or user data transmission over the air interface. It makes sure 
that the data to be sent over the radio interface is packed into suitably sized 
packets. The RLC task maintains a retransmission buffer, performs HARQ 
reordering, and routes the incoming data packets to the right destination 
task. Depending on the type of data, there are three alternative services it 
can provide via its functional entities:
•• Transparent mode (TM);
•• Unacknowledged mode (UM);
•• Acknowledged mode (AM).
One RLC task contains several different functional entities. For data 
using the transparent mode service or the unacknowledged mode service, 
there is one transmitting and one receiving entity for each service. For data 
using the acknowledged mode service, there is only one combined entity 
handling both the transmission and reception.
The transparent mode is used for the BCCH, PCCH, and CCCH 
(both uplink and downlink) channels. Transparent mode means that very 
little processing is done to the data in the RLC. The transmitting TM entity 
contains only a transmission buffer, and the receiving task does not even 
have that. Note that no RLC header is added to data units in the transparent 
mode (see Figure 6.8).
The transparent mode is used only to transport higher layer control data 
that does not require additional protection from the RLC layer. This data 
includes broadcast and paging messages, and control messages sent using the 
CCCH. The transparent mode is not used for user data.
The UM mode is used for the DTCH (both uplink and downlink), 
MCCH, and MTCH channels. This entity either segments or concatenates 
upper layer packets so that they are of suitable size for transmission. The 
RLC also adds a header to the PDU; this header includes the sequence 
number of the packet to be used for HARQ reordering at the receiver (see 
Figure 6.9).
The UM mode is used for delay-sensitive real-time applications. For 
such services, the AM mode cannot be used because of the delays that the 
additional data processing, especially packet retransmissions, would cause. 
Also, point-to-multipoint services such as MBMS will use the UM mode.

100 
 
Air Interface: Protocol Stack
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
The AM mode can be used for the DCCH and DTCH channels. The 
AM entity is bidirectional; the same entity can handle both the transmission 
and the reception of data. As seen from Figure 6.10, the major difference 
between UM and AM modes is the added retransmission functionality in 
the AM mode. The AM mode aims to provide error-free data transmis-
sion service by means of retransmissions in case of incorrectly received 
packets. However, a retransmission (or several retransmissions) of the same 
data packet increases the delay, and thus the AM mode is more suitable for 
delay-tolerant services such as file downloads, email, and web browsing. 
Also streaming services can use the AM mode if some amount of delay is 
accepted. Streaming services should employ a large buffer at the receiver 
to mitigate the effects of jitter (which will inevitably occur as a result of 
retransmissions).
Once the AM entity sends a data packet, it is also stored into the re-
transmission buffer. If the transmitting entity receives a positive acknowl-
edgment, the packet is disposed of the buffer. In case a retransmission is 
needed, the packet can be retransmitted as such or, if the MAC layer indi-
cates that the packet size will be smaller for the retransmission, the buffered 
packed can be resegmented. Typically a retransmitted packet will have a 
smaller data content than the original one, not a larger one. This is because

if a transmission failed, it is possible that the MAC will employ more robust 
transmission parameters such as the modulation scheme, and therefore less 
data can be sent within a similar packet size.
An RLC PDU can be either a data PDU or a control PDU. Data PDUs 
transfer higher layer data, and control PDUs relay acknowledgment info for 
RLC data PDUs.
The AM mode also handles HARQ reordering at the reception buffer 
in a similar way as the UM mode.
6.3.2  RLC Functions
As a summary, the following functions are supported by the RLC [6]:
•• Transfer of upper layer PDUs;
•• Error correction through ARQ (only in AM mode);
•• Concatenation, segmentation, and reassembly of RLC SDUs (UM and 
AM);
•• Resegmentation of RLC data PDUs (AM);

6.3.3  Logical Channels
Logical channels define what type of data is transferred. These channels de-
fine the data transfer services offered by the MAC layer; that is, the concept 
of logical channels is used in the interface between MAC and RLC layers. 
Instead of the uplink/downlink split, logical channels are typically classified 
by the type of data they carry (i.e., control and traffic channels) [2, 6].

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
6.3.3.1  Control Channels
These channels carry control plane information only. Note that control data 
in this case does not mean RLC layer control data, but higher layer control 
data that uses the control plane.
Broadcast Control Channel (BCCH)
This control channel provides system information to all mobile terminals 
that are within the coverage area of the eNodeB. It is mapped either to the 
BCH (in case of MIB system information) or to the DL-SCH (all other sys-
tem information) transport channel. The BCCH is a downlink-only channel. 
Within the RLC layer, the BCCH uses the TM mode for its transmissions.
Paging Control Channel (PCCH)
PCCH relays paging information to all UEs within the cell coverage area. Its 
purpose is to inform the UE about the need to set up a connection. It is also 
used to notify UEs about system information changes on the BCCH. The 
PCCH is mapped to the PCH transport channel, and it is also a downlink-
only channel. Within the RLC layer, the PCCH uses the TM mode for its 
transmissions.
Common Control Channel (CCCH)
CCCH is used to transfer control information when there is no established 
connection yet. In practice this means random access procedure messages 
that are used to establish such a connection. The CCCH is mapped to the 
UL-SCH or the DL-SCH, so it can be used in both directions: uplink and 
downlink. Within the RLC layer, the CCCH uses the TM mode for its 
transmissions.
Multicast Control Channel (MCCH)
This channel transmits control information that is used to support MBMS 
services. It is mapped either to the DL-SCH or to the MCH. DL-SCH 
mapping is used if this is a single-cell MBMS service, and MCH mapping 
in case the data requires MBSFN combining (i.e., the same data is broadcast 
over multiple cells). The MCCH is a downlink-only channel that uses the 
UM mode for its transmissions within the RLC layer.
Dedicated Control Channel (DCCH)
DCCH is the control channel that is used for user-specific control informa-
tion. This implies that there has to be a connection between the UE and 
the eNodeB before the DCCH can be used. The DCCH carries all kinds 
of connected mode signaling data, related to procedures such as handovers, 
measurements, security, and so on. The DCCH is used both in the uplink 

104 
 
Air Interface: Protocol Stack
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
and the downlink. Within the RLC layer, the DCCH uses the AM mode 
for its transmissions.
6.3.3.2  Traffic Channels
These traffic channels carry user-plane data (i.e., content that is generated by 
some application). Two traffic channel types are defined for LTE: the DTCH 
for point-to-point connections and the MTCH for point-to-multipoint 
connections.
Dedicated Traffic Channel (DTCH)
DTCH is used for transferring user data over dedicated point-to-point con-
nections. That is, the UE must have a connection with the eNodeB before 
this channel can be used. The DTCH can be used both in the uplink and in 
the downlink. Within the RLC layer, the DTCH can use either the UM or 
the AM mode for its transmissions.
Multicast Traffic Channel (MTCH)
MTCH is used for the transmission of multicast data (i.e., data that is sent 
over a point to multipoint connection). At the moment the only service 
that can employ the MTCH is MBMS. A multicast channel is obviously 
used only in the downlink, and it uses the UM mode within the RLC layer.
Figures 6.11 and 6.12 depict the mapping between logical chan-
nels, transport channels, and physical channels for uplink and downlink, 
respectively.

Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP) 
 
105
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
6.4  Packet Data Convergence Protocol (PDCP)
The PDCP layer [7] has three main tasks:
•• Header compression;
•• Security functions;
•• Handover support.
PDCP has different structure and functionality for user and control 
plane data. The user plane has more functionality (see Figure 6.13), whereas 
the control plane (see Figure 6.14) only implements the security functions.
Header compression is an important function that is needed with VoIP 
services. VoIP packets typically have very small payload, so much so that 
the VoIP header part is usually bigger in size than the payload. If every 
VoIP packet carries a full RTP/UDP/IP header, then the channel capac-
ity is clearly wasted. The header compression algorithm used in LTE is the 
robust header compression (ROHC) protocol by IETF. The basic principle 
in ROHC is that the full header is sent only in the initialization phase, and 
after that only modified parameters are transmitted. 
ROHC is efficient in reducing the header size: In the case of IPv4 the 
header size is 40 bytes, and in the case of IPv6 it is 60 bytes. Once the com-
pression is done, the header size will be reduced to 4–6 bytes.

Air Interface: Protocol Stack
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Header compression is performed only for the user plane, and only for 
VoIP packets. In fact, its implementation in the UE is not mandatory; only 
UEs with VoIP support need to have it.
Security in PDCP includes two functions: ciphering and integrity pro-
tection. Ciphering encrypts the data so that it cannot be read by intruders. 
Integrity protection verifies that the message at the receiver is the same 
as what the transmitter sent. Note that integrity protection itself does not 
prevent an intruder from reading the message; it just prevents its unauthor-
ized modification. Therefore, in many cases both ciphering and integrity 
protection are used for control plane data. Ciphering is performed to both 
U-plane and C-plane data, integrity protection only to C-plane data. Ci-
phering and integrity protection are discussed in [8].
Handover support in PDCP context means support for user data han-
dling during handovers. Depending on the type of data (i.e., whether the 
data transmission employs the UM or the AM mode in the RLC layer), the 
PDCP layer can perform a seamless or a lossless handover.
If the data transmission uses the UM mode, then delay is an important 
QoS parameter for this data. However, the loss of a few data packets is ac-
ceptable in the UM mode. For example, streaming data fits the description 
for such a service. In this kind of case the PDCP performs a seamless han-
dover. This type of handover is designed to be as quick as possible. Com-
plexity is kept at minimum to minimize the delays. However, as a result of

this, there are no checks at the receiver for missing data packets during the 
handover process, and therefore such PDCP SDUs that were already trans-
mitted from the source entity, but not yet received at the target entity when 
the switchover took place, may have been lost. See [7] for details.
If the data transmission uses the AM mode, then it is obvious that lost 
data packets are not tolerated. However, small delays in the handover pro-
cedure will be acceptable since the AM mode will create them anyway. In 
this case a lossless handover is performed. This handover type requires more 
complex support mechanisms, and as a result longer delays will also take 
place. But the mechanisms introduced will guarantee that the data should 
be received without lost packets.
In a lossless handover the PDCP layer has to take a few special steps in 
order to guarantee that all data packets are delivered successfully:
1.	 The data packets already transmitted via the old link have to be 
retransmitted via the new radio link if no acknowledgment was 
received via the old link before the switchover took place.
2.	 Step 1 will result in duplicate data packets being received in cas-
es where the original data packet got through, but its acknowl-
edgment did not because the old radio link was cut before

acknowledgment(s) were delivered. Therefore, the receiver must 
check PDCP sequence numbers from received data packets and 
remove duplicates. To make this possible, PDCP sequence numbers 
must be maintained throughout the whole handover procedure.
3.	 The handover procedure also increases the possibility that data 
packets are received out of sequence at the receiver. Therefore, the 
receiver must use a data buffer for reordering the packets. Such 
a buffer exists in user-plane PDCP in any case, but its usage in a 
lossless handover requires that PDCP sequence numbers are main-
tained throughout the whole handover procedure.
6.5  Radio Resource Control (RRC)
6.5.1  Introduction
Radio resource control [9] is a big protocol task, no matter how you mea-
sure it. It has lots of functionality, its code size is large, and the RRC speci-
fication is also very large.
RRC exist in the control plane only; no user plane data is processed 
in the RRC layer. It configures and manages other air interface access stra-
tum protocols. Other protocol tasks have their own control signaling, too, 
especially at the lower end of the protocol stack. Typically, however, RRC 
takes care of the initial configuration of protocol tasks and manages slowly 
changing parameters, whereas other tasks can self-configure rapidly chang-
ing parameters for which the configuration via RRC signaling approach 
would be too slow an alternative.
6.5.2  UE States
RRC functionality depends a lot on the UE state (sometimes also known 
as the RRC state). In LTE the UE state diagram is greatly simplified from 
the one in UMTS; now there are only two states: RRC_IDLE and RRC_
CONNECTED. The transition between these states takes place when an 
RRC connection is established or released.
As readers may recall, in UMTS there were all together five UE states: 
UTRA_Idle, and four RRC_Connected substates: URA_PCH, CELL_
PCH, CELL_FACH, and CELL_DCH. In LTE the substates have been 
removed (see Figure 6.15).
The UE states can be characterized as follows:
•• RRC_IDLE:
•	DRX support (RRC configures the physical layer in the UE to 
monitor only the paging channel during certain periods). This is not

a mandatory option, but a UE without DRX will quickly drain its 
batteries.
•	UE controls its own mobility (i.e., the network does not stipulate 
which cell the UE should camp onto).
•	In RRC_IDLE, the UE must:
•	Monitor a paging channel to receive notifications for incom-
ing calls, system information changes, and PWS notifications (if 
supported).
•	Measure neighboring cells, and, based on these measurements, 
perform cell reselection;
•	Read system information.
•	Perform measurement logging (if supported).
•• RRC_CONNECTED:
•	Data transfer to/from the UE.
•	DRX support.
•	Support for carrier aggregation (from Rel-10 onward).

•	Monitor the paging channel and/or SIB1 to receive notifica-
tions for system information changes and PWS notifications (if 
supported).
•	Monitor control channels associated with the shared data channel 
to receive data indications.
•	Provide channel quality and feedback information.
•	Perform neighboring cell measurements and measurement 
reporting.
•	Read system information.
6.5.3  RRC Functions
The list of functions the RRC has to perform is very long. They can be 
grouped into eight classes:
•• Broadcast of system information;
•• RRC connection control;
•• Inter-RAT mobility;
•• Measurement configuration and reporting;
•• Generic protocol error handling;
•• Support of self-configuration and self-optimization;
•• Support of measurement logging and reporting;
•• Other functions.
In the following sections we will briefly discuss the contents of each of 
these classes.
6.5.3.1  Broadcast of System Information
System information includes important configuration information about 
the network and the serving cell. Since this information is common to all 
users of the cell, it is broadcast to all UEs in the cell coverage area. System 
information is grouped into messages called the master information block 
(MIB) and a number of system information blocks (SIBs).

Radio Resource Control (RRC)

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
The MIB includes the most essential parameters that are needed for the 
UE to acquire other information from the cell: the carrier bandwidth and 
the current system frame number. The MIB is transmitted on BCH, which 
is a low-capacity channel, and thus the amount of data in MIB is kept at 
minimum. The system information in MIB is transmitted again every 40 ms; 
it has the shortest periodicity of any system information block.
System information blocks are numbered from 1 to 16. This is the status 
in Release 11—later releases can and will introduce additional SIBs once 
new features requiring configuration information are added to the system. 
LTE is designed to be easily extendable; new messages and message ele-
ments can be added to the system without problems in a backwards com-
patible way. SIB type 1 is transmitted in a message of its own; other SIBs are 
embedded into the system information (SI) message. One SI message can 
contain several SIBs—but only SIBs that have the same periodicity. SIB1 
has an element called the schedulingInfoList, which indicates the presence 
of SIBs in each SI. Not all SIBs are transmitted in all networks or all cells. 
Some SIBs are feature-specific. If a network does not support a certain 
feature, then the corresponding SIB is not transmitted. Also, a UE that does 
not support a certain feature does not have to receive the related SIB. The 
SI and the SIBs are transmitted on the DL-SCH. The periodicity for SIB1 
is 80 ms; for other SIBs the periodicity is configurable.
The information received in a SIB is valid until new and different in-
formation is received, which then overwrites the old info. The oncoming 
change in SIB contents is indicated with the parameter systemInfoModifi-
cation in a paging message. If the contents are to be changed, then the UE 
has to receive SIBs again. If the UE misses this paging message (e.g., it is 
out of coverage temporarily), then it can check if SIBs have changed from 
SIB1, which carries a systemInfoValueTag parameter. If the value of this tag 
has changed since the UE last read it, then there has been a change in the 
contents of SIBs. Therefore a UE should always read SIB1 if it has been out 
of coverage even for a short period.
Note that not all system information parameter changes will result in a 
change in the systemInfoModification or in the systemInfoValueTag. Some 
SIBs contain rapidly changing information such as current timing info, 
which does not need to be read again after the initial SIB acquisition.
System information is broadcast information; the UE does not need to 
acknowledge its reception.
The list of SIBs in Release 11 is as follows.

6.5.3.2  RRC Connection Control
RRC connection control is a very broad topic, encompassing a long list of 
functionality starting from paging and ending with the release of a connec-
tion. It includes security management, handovers, carrier aggregation, QoS 
control, and so on. In fact, RRC connection control is a topic worthy of 
a book in itself; therefore, we can only scrape the surface when discussing 
this topic.
Note that many of the following functions are further discussed in 
Chapter 9, Procedures.
The list of functions belonging under RRC connection control banner 
include the following:
•• Paging;
•• RRC connection establishment;
•• Security management;
•• RRC connection reconfiguration;
•• Counter check;
•• RRC connection re-establishment;
•• RRC connection release;
•• Proximity indication.
The purpose of the paging procedure is as follows:
•• To transmit paging information to a particular UE that is in RRC_
IDLE state;

	
6.5 
Radio Resource Control (RRC) 
 
115
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
•• To inform all UEs about a system information change;
•• To inform all UEs about a PWS notification.
RRC connection establishment is always initiated by the UE. It may 
follow a paging message reception, or it may be a result of a request from 
higher layers in the UE. Before launching an RRCConnectionRequest, the 
UE has to check from received SI that it is allowed to access the current cell. 
This message will trigger a random access procedure in the MAC layer, but 
note that random access is purely a MAC layer procedure in LTE.
Security management includes the management and generation of se-
curity keys. Security in the access stratum involves two functions: ciphering 
and integrity protection. In the access stratum, both of them are performed 
at the PDCP layer. However, RRC handles the security management and 
configures the required security parameters. Note that NAS has its own 
security functions.
The integrity protection algorithm is common for signaling radio bear-
ers SRB1 and SRB2. The ciphering algorithm is common for all data bear-
ers and control bearers SRB1 and SRB2. Neither integrity protection nor 
ciphering applies to SRB0. Both ciphering and integrity protection are al-
ways activated together. They can never be deactivated once activated, but it 
is possible to switch to a “NULL” ciphering algorithm. The null algorithm 
can be used, for example, when making an emergency call without a USIM.
The various security keys [8] required by the access stratum are all de-
rived from a key called access security management entity (KASME). KASME 
is stored in the USIM in the UE, and in the authentication centre in the 
home subscriber server (HSS). The AS uses three different security keys: 
•• KRRCint for the integrity protection of RRC signaling;
•• KRRCenc for the ciphering of RRC signaling;
•• KUPenc for the ciphering of user data.
These keys are derived from the KeNB key, which is again based on 
the KASME  key. Once a connection is established, a new set of AS keys is 
generated. This also applies to handovers and connection re-establisment 
procedures: a new set of keys will be needed then.
RRC connection reconfiguration is a multipurpose procedure. It can 
establish, modify, or release radio bearers; perform handovers; set up, modify, 
or release measurements (there is no separate “measurement command” in 
LTE); and add, modify, or release SCells in case of carrier aggregation. This 
procedure is always initiated by the network. It may include the reconfigu-
ration of the physical, MAC, RLC, and PDCP layers, or a subset of those.
The counter check procedure is used by the network to request the UE 
to verify the amount of data sent and received on each data bearer. Both 

116 
 
Air Interface: Protocol Stack
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
sides will maintain the counter value independently, and this procedure 
verifies that these values match. The purpose of this procedure is to detect 
packet insertion by an intruder (a “man in the middle attack”).
When a failure occurs in the radio connection, the UE may attempt 
to re-establish the existing connection rather than to start from the be-
ginning. The procedure for doing this is called the RRC connection re-
establishment. Since the old cell obviously had problems, the UE must first 
find a new cell. If this is successful, the UE can send an RRC connection 
re-establishment request message, which will trigger a random access pro-
cedure in the MAC layer. This procedure, if successful, will re-establish the 
signaling connection only (SRB1). All other bearers will then have to be 
re-established with the RRC connection reconfiguration procedure.
The RRC connection release procedure releases the RRC connection, 
which includes the release of the established radio bearers as well as all radio 
resources. As a result of this procedure, the UE will enter the RRC_IDLE 
state. Whereas the RRC connection establishment is always initiated by the 
UE, its release is always initiated by the network side with a RRCCon-
nectionRelease message. This message is unacknowledged. Note that the 
UE can itself initiate a connection release, but that is done at upper layers 
and that process will later result in this network-initiated RRC connection 
release.
Proximity indication is sent by the UE to indicate that the UE is en-
tering or leaving the proximity of a closed user group (CSG) member cell 
(i.e., there is a Home eNodeB nearby). This information is useful for the 
eNodeB, because it may not otherwise know if the UE is close to a CSG 
cell. Once the proximity is known, the eNodeB may configure the UE to 
perform measurements on the frequency used by the CSG cell and take 
other actions related to a handover to the CSG cell [10].
6.5.3.3  Inter-RAT Mobility
Inter-RAT mobility [2, 9], in its widest sense, includes both idle and con-
nected mode mobility. In the idle mode, the mobility is UE-controlled, 
whereas in the connected mode it is controlled by the network. A prereq-
uisite for inter-RAT mobility is that the UE supports the radio technology 
of the other network.
In the idle mode the UE gets to know the potential inter-RAT cells via 
broadcast system information. SIB6, SIB7, and SIB8 contain information 
on UTRA, GERAN, and CDMA2000 frequencies and neighboring cells, 
respectively. With this information the UE can measure the inter-RAT cells 
to find out if there are suitable cells for reselection. Inter-RAT cell reselec-
tion is based on absolute priorities where the UE tries to camp on the high-
est priority RAT available. Priorities are given in the system information, 
and thus they are valid for all UEs in a cell. However, specific priorities per 

	
6.5 
Radio Resource Control (RRC) 
 
117
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
UE can be signaled in the RRC connection release message. If the criteria 
for a cell reselection are fulfilled, the UE can simply camp on the new cell, 
and there is no need to inform the network about it, though a cell reselec-
tion may trigger a location update procedure.
In the connected mode, the inter-RAT mobility procedure is much 
more complex, including, for example, security activation and the transfer 
of RRC context information.
Mobility to LTE is very much like a normal intra-RAT LTE handover. 
When the handover from another RAT is initiated by the other RAT, the 
UE is configured to use LTE radio resources via messages in the other RAT, 
and then a RRCConnectionReconfiguration message is sent to the UE 
via LTE. This will be followed by the ciphering activation, unless that was 
already done by the previous RAT.
Mobility from LTE is a more varied topic. There are (at least) three ways 
to perform such a procedure:
•• Handover: the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message includes radio 
resources that have been allocated for the UE in the target cell; this op-
tion applies to mobility from LTE to UTRA and GERAN.
•• Cell change order: the MobilityFromEUTRACommand message may 
include target cell system information. The cell change order procedure 
is applicable only to mobility from LTE to GERAN.
•• Enhanced CS fallback to CDMA2000 1xRTT: the MobilityFromEU-
TRACommand message includes radio resources that have been al-
located for the UE in the target cell. The enhanced CS fallback to 
CDMA2000 1xRTT may be combined with concurrent handover or 
redirection to CDMA2000 HRPD.
In case of mobility to CDMA2000, the eNodeB in LTE decides when 
to move to the other RAT while the target RAT determines to which cell 
the UE shall move.
6.5.3.4  Measurement Configuration and Reporting
This section is about measurements performed in the connected mode. The 
UE reports measurement information based on the measurement configu-
ration as provided by the E-UTRAN. This information is provided using 
the RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.
The UE can be requested to perform the following types of 
measurements:
•• Intrafrequency measurements: measurements at the downlink carrier 
frequencies of the serving cells;

118 
 
Air Interface: Protocol Stack
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
•• Interfrequency measurements: measurements at frequencies that differ 
from the downlink carrier frequencies of the serving cells;
•• Inter-RAT measurements (UTRA/GERAN/CDMA2000).
The measurement configuration in the RRCConnectionReconfigura-
tion includes the following parameters [9]:
1.	 Measurement objects: The objects on which the UE should perform 
the measurements. These objects are usually carrier frequencies, 
possibly with a list of cell specific offsets and a list of “blacklisted” 
cells.
2.	 Reporting configurations: A list of reporting configurations where 
each reporting configuration consists of:
•	 Reporting criterion: The criterion that triggers the UE to send a 
measurement report. This can either be a periodic or a single event 
description.
•	 Reporting format: The quantities that the UE includes in the mea-
surement report (i.e., what the UE is supposed to measure) and the 
associated information (e.g., the number of cells to report). The 
quantity parameters depends a lot on the system to be measured (i.e., 
LTE, UMTS, GERAN, or CDMA2000) and can be, for example, 
received signal code power (RSCP), reference signal received power 
(RSRP), reference signal received quality (RSRQ), or received sig-
nal strength indicator (RSSI). In case of LTE, this parameter to be 
measured is either RSRP or RSRQ.
3.	 Measurement identities: A list of measurement identities where each 
measurement identity links one measurement object with one re-
porting configuration. The measurement identity is used as a refer-
ence number in the measurement report.
4.	 Quantity configurations: The quantity configuration defines the fil-
tering for each measurement.
5.	 Measurement gaps: Periods that the UE may use to perform meas-
urements (and during these periods no uplink or downlink trans-
missions for this UE are scheduled).
The measurement procedures distinguish the following types of cells:
1.	 Serving cells;
2.	 Listed cells: these are cells listed within the measurement objects;
3.	 Detected cells: these are cells that are not listed within the meas-
urement objects but are detected by the UE on carrier frequencies 
indicated by the measurement objects.
The rules on what to measure and where are as follows:

	
6.5 
Radio Resource Control (RRC) 
 
119
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
•• For E-UTRA, the UE measures and reports on the serving cells, listed 
cells, and detected cells.
•• For inter-RAT UTRA, the UE measures and reports on listed cells and 
optionally on cells that are within a range for which reporting is allowed 
by E-UTRAN.
•• For inter-RAT GERAN, the UE measures and reports on detected 
cells.
•• For inter-RAT CDMA2000, the UE measures and reports on listed 
cells.
As explained earlier, a measurement report can be event triggered or 
periodical. In event-triggered reporting, the report is sent once a certain 
event takes place. In periodic reporting, the triggering event is the corre-
sponding timer expiry. The triggering event can also be a mixture of event-
triggered and periodic reporting: the first report is only sent once an event 
occurs, but after that the following reports are sent periodically until the 
maximum number of reports has been sent or the event reporting criteria 
are no longer fulfilled. Note that for each event-triggered reporting criteria, 
both the entering condition and the leaving condition for measurement 
reporting has been defined.
The list of event-triggered reporting criteria in LTE include:
•• Event A1: Serving cell becomes better than a threshold.
•• Event A2: Serving cell becomes worse than a threshold.
•• Event A3: Neighbor cell becomes better than the serving cell plus an 
offset.
•• Event A4: Neighbor cell becomes better than a threshold.
•• Event A5: Serving cell becomes worse than threshold1, and neighbor 
cell becomes better than threshold2.
•• Event A6: Neighbor cell becomes better than the secondary serving cell 
plus an offset.
For inter-RAT measurements, the following event-triggered reporting 
criteria have been defined:
•• Event B1: Inter-RAT neighbor cell becomes better than threshold.
•• Event B2: Serving cell becomes worse than threshold1, and inter-RAT 
neighbor cell becomes better than threshold2.
Measurements are reported in a MeasurementReport message.

Air Interface: Protocol Stack
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
In the example in Figure 6.16, the UE measures the RSRP from both 
the serving cells and a neighboring cell. The serving cell is getting weaker, 
while the neighboring cells grow in strength. At point A, the neighboring 
cells becomes stronger than the serving cell, but this does not cause any ac-
tions yet because in reporting criteria event A3, the neighboring cell must 
be an offset value better than the serving cell before it is considered for a 
measurement report.
Once the neighboring cell becomes an offset value better than the 
serving cell at point B, the UE starts a timer (time to trigger). Timer time to 
trigger does not contain a fixed value, but the UE can scale it based on its 
own speed.
If the neighboring cell remains an offset value better than the serving 
cell for a time period indicated by a time-to-trigger parameter, then the UE 
will send a measurement report to the eNodeB (point C).
6.5.3.5  Generic Protocol Error Handling
The generic error handling applies to cases where the error handling is not 
explicitly specified elsewhere in specifications. This may include errors such 
as ASN.1 coding errors, missing mandatory message fields, a variable value 
out of range, or a field value not understood. Basically these are errors that 
should not happen but still somehow manage to happen. In most other

cases, the error handling is already defined in relevant subclauses, but it is 
good to have generic error handling defined in case something unexpected 
happens.
6.5.3.6  Support of Self-Configuration and Self-Optimization
The self-optimizing network (SON) has become a popular catchword in 
LTE. SON is a new concept for LTE, not used in other mobile networks 
before LTE. SON includes various automated functions that can help the 
network operator to configure and autotune an LTE network. These func-
tions can be very different in nature; for example, mobility load balancing 
(MLB) and energy saving do not have much in common—except that both 
of them can be used in improving the network performance, and they can 
be automated—and therefore they are part of SON.
SON is given a thorough treatment in Chapter 11. In this section we 
will just briefly mention that in some cases the RRC has to support various 
SON functions (e.g., by providing measurement results). It is worth noting 
that SON functions are typically radio access network (RAN) functions, 
residing in the eNodeB, which require little support from UEs over the air 
interface. SON mechanisms are also discussed in section 22 of [2].
6.5.3.7  Support of Measurement Logging and Reporting
This clause does not mean the measurements performed by the UE in the 
connected mode and defined in Section 6.5.3.4. Instead measurement log-
ging refers to special measurements that the UE performs while in the idle 
mode (in some special cases also in the connected mode) in order to support 
network performance optimization. In LTE engineering jargon, this topic 
is known as minimization of drive tests (MDT) [9, 11], which describes its 
purpose well. Traditionally, when a network operator deploys a network, or 
adds eNodeBs to an existing network, the fine-tuning of the network is a 
major task. It involves lots of operator vans, driving around the coverage area 
of the network and measuring the radio conditions. The overall goal is to 
find, for example, coverage holes, areas with weak radio signals, areas with 
potential capacity problems, or areas where the neighboring cells can cause 
interference. This is an expensive undertaking and takes time if done prop-
erly. The idea behind MDT is to let the UEs to measure the radio conditions 
when they move around the network and report them back automatically.
These measurements are typically meant to take place in the idle mode, 
although there is a variant called the immediate MDT, which involves the 
UE to make the measurements in the connected mode. The measurements 
should have a time stamp and location information attached to them; other-
wise, they are useless for MDT purposes. It is important that the amount of 

122 
 
Air Interface: Protocol Stack
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
MDT measurements per UE is kept within reasonable limits because they 
consume valuable battery power.
MDT measurements are initiated when the UE receives a LoggedMea-
surementConfiguration message. The measurement quantity is fixed for the 
logged MDT (i.e., it is not configurable) and consists of both RSRP and 
RSRQ for LTE, both RSCP and Ec/No for UTRA, P-CCPCH RSCP 
for UTRA 1.28 TDD, Rxlev for GERAN, and pilot Pn phase and pilot 
strength for CDMA2000 (in all cases it is assumed that the serving cell is 
E-UTRAN).
The UE should perform the required measurements and store the re-
sults. It should not send them to the network by its own initiative; rather, 
it should indicate their presence with a flag in the RRCConnectionSet-
upComplete message (i.e., the next time the UE enters the connected 
mode). The network can then explicitly request the logged results with a 
UE information procedure (see Figure 6.17). The response message, UEIn-
formationResponse, will contain the logged measurements.

Chapter 7
Radio Access Network
7.1  Introduction
The radio access network (RAN) in LTE is called E-UTRAN, or evolved 
universal terrestrial radio access network. It is a bit unfortunate that the 
RAN in LTE is called evolved UTRAN, whereas in UMTS it is UTRAN. 
This gives the impression that the 4G technology employed is just a slightly 
upgraded version of 3G. However, as shown earlier, the air interface espe-
cially is based on completely different technologies, and the RAN architec-
ture is also very different.
The E-UTRAN has a greatly simplified architecture when compared 
to UMTS UTRAN. In UTRAN the radio network controller (RNC) and 
the base station (NodeB) were separate entities, but in EUTRAN they have 
been combined into an evolved NodeB (eNodeB, or eNB).
Since we have already discussed the air interface in previous chapters, 
this chapter will concentrate on the network side of RAN, namely, the 
eNodeB, its variants, and the interfaces of RAN.
7.2  E-UTRAN Architecture
The E-UTRAN architecture [1, 2] is depicted in Figure 7.1. As seen, it has 
fewer entities than in the UTRAN architecture. The radio network control-
ler and the base station have been combined into a single entity, eNodeB. 
This solution was chosen because it allows for shorter transmission delays 
for the signaling between the UE and the network.
The eNodeB connects to the core network, evolved packet core (EPC) 
via the S1 interface [3]. There are two variants of this interface:
•• S1-AP interface exists between the eNodeB and the mobility manage-
ment entity (MME). 
•• S1-U interface exists between the eNodeB and the serving gateway 
(S-GW).

126 
 
Radio Access Network
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
eNodeBs can also be connected directly to each other. This logical in-
terface between them is called the X2 interface [4].
In addition, the E-UTRAN architecture includes home eNodeBs 
(HeNBs) [2, 5], which are special eNodeBs, designed for deployment in 
a private environment (e.g., in homes or offices). Logically, HeNB is a full 
eNodeB that connects to the core network via the S1 interface, and to UEs 
via the Uu interface. A HeNB is designed to be an affordably priced, easily 
deployable (without mobile operator’s involvement) home electronics de-
vice that may or may not support a closed user group (CSG).
The home eNodeB gateway (HeNB-GW) is an optional gateway 
through which the home eNodeB accesses the core network. Its UTRAN 
counterpart, HNB-GW, is a mandatory element in UTRAN networks. 
However, even though the HeNB-GW is optional in EUTRAN, network 
operators typically have a HeNB-GW to optimize the operations and man-
agement of HeNBs. Otherwise, a very large number of HeNBs would be 
directly connected to the MME and the SGW. It is also possible to use this 
gateway only between the HeNB and the MME, and to have a direct inter-
face between the HeNB and the S-GW.
The E-UTRAN may also include relay nodes (RNs) [2, 6]. A RN is a 
low-power base station that can be used to increase or improve the cover-
age of a LTE network. A RN is connected to a “host” eNodeB via a radio 
interface. The host eNodeB is called the donor eNodeB (DeNB). The RN

is “architecturally transparent” in the sense that toward eNodeB it looks like 
a UE, and toward the UE it looks like a normal eNodeB. Relays are further 
discussed in Chapter 11.
7.3  eNodeB
7.3.1  eNodeB Introduction
The eNodeB combines the functionality of a base station and a radio net-
work controller. In the past with 2G and 3G, the design aim was to keep 
the base station as simple and cheap as possible and to concentrate the in-
telligence in RAN into a radio network controller. However, since shorter 
transmission delays are an important design factor in LTE, the radio network 
controller was removed and its intelligence was moved into eNodeBs (i.e., 
closer to UEs).
This change has brought many advantages, the most important of 
which is that the network response time as experienced by UEs is much 
shorter than before. But there are also some problems. Because the radio 
network does not have a central “master” node anymore, the intelligence in 
the RAN is distributed. Therefore it is not obvious which node makes the 
decisions in procedures and functions that require inter-eNodeB interac-
tions. For example, many new SON features, such as mobility load balanc-
ing, require careful design and distributed algorithms to work properly.
eNodeB protocol stacks are depicted in Figures 7.2 and 7.3. We have 
already discussed the air interface protocols in the previous chapter. The in-
terface between the eNodeB and the core network, the S1 interface, comes 
in two different versions: S1-MME and S1-U. The S1-MME is in the con-
trol plane and the S1-U interface exists in the user plane.

Between two eNodeBs exists the X2 interface. From a logical stand-
point, the X2 is a point-to-point interface between two eNodeBs. How-
ever, as this is a logical interface, there is no direct physical connection be-
tween two eNodeBs. Figures 7.4 and 7.5 show X2 interface protocol stacks.
7.3.2  eNodeB Functionality
eNodeB has several important functions [2]:
•• Radio resource management functions;
•• Measurement and measurement reporting configuration;
•• Access stratum security;
•• IP header compression and encryption of user data;
•• Selection of an MME at UE attachment;
•• Routing of user plane data toward the serving gateway;
•• Scheduling and transmission of paging messages;
•• Scheduling and transmission of broadcast information;
•• Scheduling and transmission of PWS messages.
Each of these functions is discussed briefly in following sections. It must 
be stressed here that a network operator is free to implement these functions 
as it sees best. In most cases the specifications do not restrict the selection 
and the implementation of the relevant algorithms. There are, of course, 
exceptions such as security. Security algorithms are strictly standardized, and 
their implementation must conform to the corresponding specifications.

And even though the implementation of these functions is not guided 
by standards, there are detailed test specifications that will check that the 
performance of implemented functions is good enough. For example, the 
requirements for support of radio resource management can be found in 
[7].
Radio resource management (RRM) ensures the efficient use of available 
radio resources. It has several functions in its toolbox to achieve this:
•• Radio bearer control (RBC);
•• Radio admission control (RAC);
•• Connection mobility control (CMC);
•• Dynamic resource allocation (DRA);
•• Intercell interference coordination (ICIC);

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
•• Load balancing (LB).
Radio bearer control (RBC) decides what kind of radio bearers are assigned 
for each user and when. When setting up a radio bearer for a service, the 
RBC takes into account the overall resource situation in the E-UTRAN, 
the QoS requirements of in-progress sessions, and the QoS requirement for 
the new service. RBC also monitors the situation throughout the lifetime 
of the connection and can modify the bearer parameters due to mobility 
or other reasons. At the end of the connection, the RBC is involved in the 
release of radio resources associated with radio bearers.
Radio admission control (RAC) acts as a gatekeeper for the new radio 
bearer establishment requests. The goal of RAC is to provide high radio re-
source utilization by accepting new radio bearers if required radio resources 
are available, but also at the same time to ensure that existing sessions can 
be provided with high enough QoS. The latter requirement means that 
sometimes RAC has to reject new radio bearer requests. In order to do this, 
RAC must consider the overall resource situation in E-UTRAN, the QoS 
requirements, the priority levels and the provided QoS of existing sessions, 
and the QoS requirement of the new radio bearer request. 
Connection mobility control (CMC) manages the radio resource realloca-
tion that is due to UE mobility. This applies to both the idle and the con-
nected mode mobility. In the idle mode, the UE makes the cell reselection 
decision autonomously, but CMC can control the reselection algorithm by 
setting the relevant parameters such as threshold and hysteresis values. These 
parameters are broadcast to all UEs in the cell. In the connected mode, 
handovers are controlled by the eNodeB. There is a long list of parameters 
the CMC can take into account when making handover decisions, such as 
radio measurements, neighbor cell load, traffic distribution, and transport 
and hardware resources.
Dynamic resource allocation (DRA) is also known as packet scheduling 
(PS). The task of DRA is to allocate resources to UEs both in the uplink 
and in the downlink. These resources are not only channel resources but 
also memory resources (packet buffers) and data processing resources. DRA 
is very dynamic as its name suggests: it may be necessary to reallocate the 
resources to UEs in every subframe. As with other RRM functions, the 
DRA can take a long list of measured parameters as inputs to its scheduling 
algorithm. These include at least the QoS requirements of radio bearers, the 
channel quality information, packet buffer status, and interference. 
Intercell interference coordination (ICIC) has to manage radio resources in a 
way that minimizes the intercell interference. Intercell interference may be 
a serious problem for users near the cell edges and in pico/femto cells that 
are located inside macro cells but are operating on the same frequency. ICIC 
is a multicell function that has to take into account parameters from several 
neighboring cells. This makes it difficult to design an efficient algorithm, 

	
7.3 
eNodeB 
 
131
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
since there is no central radio controller node in E-UTRAN and all eNo-
deBs are equal. Therefore some degree of configuration by operation and 
maintenance (O&M) may be necessary in order to achieve a satisfactory 
ICIC solution. ICIC includes a frequency domain component and a time 
domain component. The frequency domain ICIC aims to manage radio 
resource blocks in a way that minimizes interference in the frequency do-
main. This requires coordination on the use of frequency resources across 
multiple cells. The time domain ICIC introduces a concept called almost 
blank subframe (ABS). ABSs are subframes that are transmitted with greatly 
reduced transmit power. Only the most essential control channels are trans-
mitted during ABS periods. The ABS patterns are signaled to the eNodeB 
of the victim cell, and it can schedule the UEs suffering from interference 
to transmit their own data during the ABS frames only. The time domain 
ICIC is especially designed to deal with interference caused by a macrocell 
toward a pico/femto cell. The obvious drawback with ICIC schemes is that 
most of them tend of reduce the overall throughput of the cell because not 
all channel resources are used. The preferred ICIC method may be different 
in the uplink and in the downlink.
Load balancing (LB) aims to distribute the data traffic across multiple 
cells in a way that results in more evenly loaded cells. The LB algorithm 
tries to find such UEs that can be handed over from highly loaded cells to 
underutilized cells. The QoS of existing connections should be maintained 
even after such handovers. In most cases, load balancing is a difficult task 
because typically only UEs near cells edges can be considered candidates 
for load balancing, unless the network has more than one frequency chan-
nel in its use—in which case, the LB algorithm can perform interfrequency 
handovers to ease the congestion on the heavily loaded cell.
Measurement and Measurement Reporting Configuration
This topic was already discussed in Section 6.5.3.4. The eNodeB has to 
decide what kind of measurements and when are needed from each UE. As 
already seen in previous sections, the eNodeB needs measurement informa-
tion for a wide variety of management functions. However, it should not 
overburden the UE with unnecessary measurement requests, since they do 
consume power.
Access Stratum Security
Access stratum (AS) and nonaccess stratum (NAS) security procedures and 
keys are kept separate in LTE. In AS, the security issues are handled by the 
eNodeB; in NAS the main actor is MME.
It is worth noting that even though both AS and NAS level security 
keys are derived from the same “root” key KASME, it is not possible to deter-
mine NAS level keys from AS keys or vice versa.

132 
 
Radio Access Network
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
The same SecurityModeCommand is used to activate both ciphering 
and integrity protection simultaneously, if both are to be employed. It is not 
possible to launch one process first and then another later. However, AS and 
NAS use separate commands to initiate security procedures and may do 
those at different times.
A sequence number, COUNT, is used as an input to ciphering and 
integrity protection procedures. The same COUNT number must only be 
used once for a given data packet on the same radio bearer in the same di-
rection, except when sending an identical retransmission. However, the same 
COUNT value can be used for both ciphering and integrity protection.
Security is a very wide topic, worthy of a book in itself. This book can 
only discuss the basic security principles in LTE. For more information, see 
[2, 8, 9].
IP Header Compression and Encryption of User Data
User data is transmitted in IP packets (either IPv4 or IPv6) that have a size-
able header. Normally, this is not a big problem, but with VoIP applications 
the amount of data in each packet is typically very small, and the header part 
can be larger than the data part. Therefore IP header compression can be 
performed for IP headers in case of VoIP. The header compression algorithm 
used in LTE is the robust header compression (ROHC) protocol [10]. The 
basic principle in ROHC is that the full IP header is sent only in the initial-
ization phase, and afterward only the modified parameters are transmitted. 
Header compression is performed for only the user plane, and currently 
only for VoIP packets. Its implementation in the UE is not mandatory; only 
UEs with VoIP support need to have it. The eNodeB is in charge of when 
and which UEs should support the IP header compression. The compres-
sion/decompression function itself is a PDCP layer function.
The reason the PDCP has two different functions for security is that 
ciphering and integrity protection perform different, but complementary, 
tasks. Ciphering encrypts the data so that it cannot be read by intruders. 
Integrity protection verifies that the message at the receiver is the same as 
what the transmitter sent. Note that integrity protection itself does not pre-
vent an intruder from reading the message; it just prevents its unauthorized 
modification. Therefore in many cases both ciphering and integrity protec-
tion are used for control plane data. Ciphering and integrity protection are 
discussed in [8].
Ciphering, deciphering, and integrity protection are performed at the 
PDCP layer. Once a connection is established, the eNodeB has to calculate 
an access stratum base key KeNB, based on the KASME key [8]. This key is 
used to derive three further keys that are used in ciphering and integrity 
protection. The eNodeB activates the access stratum security with a Secu-
rityModeCommand at the RRC layer. Ciphering is performed to both 
U-plane and C-plane data, integrity protection only to C-plane data.

eNodeB

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Selection of an MME at UE Attachment
Normally, when a UE initiates a connection, it will send a globally unique 
MME identifier (GUMMEI) to the eNodeB in RRCConnectionSet-
upComplete message. This parameter identifies the MME the UE was last 
registered with. It will then be used by the eNodeB to select the correct 
MME from a pool of available MMEs. However, GUMMEI is not always 
known to the UE, or it may be that the eNodeB does not have access to the 
MME identified. In that case the eNodeB has to select the serving MME 
by other criteria, provided that there are more than one MME available for 
this eNodeB. In this selection, the eNodeB can employ, for example, some 
load sharing algorithms.
Routing of User Plane Data Toward the Serving Gateway
The selection of the S1-U interface for a given data connection is done 
within the EPC and signaled to the eNodeB by the MME.
Scheduling and Transmission of Paging Messages
The MME initiates the paging procedure by sending a paging message to 
the eNodeB. The eNodeB will then page the UE in cells that belong to 
tracking areas (TA) listed in the paging message. Note that each cell can 
belong to only one TA, but one eNodeB can contain cells belonging to 
different TAs.
Paging messages are also used to inform UEs about an oncoming 
change in system information. Also, they will warn the UEs about new 
PWS messages being sent in SIB10, SIB11, and SIB12.
Scheduling and Transmission of Broadcast Information
The MIB is carried on the BCH. All other SI messages are carried on the 
DL-SCH, where they can be identified through the SI-RNTI (system in-
formation RNTI). SI-RNTI is an identifier, transmitted on the PDCCH, 
indicating that there is system information being transmitted in the associ-
ated DL-SCH. Both the MIB and SystemInformationBlockType1 use a 
fixed schedule, with a periodicity of 40 and 80 ms, respectively, while the 
scheduling of other SI messages is flexible and indicated by SystemInfor-
mationBlockType1. It is up to the eNodeB to decide the periodicity of 
individual SI messages.
The eNB may schedule DL-SCH transmissions containing logical 
channels other than BCCH in the same subframe used for BCCH. System 
information may also be provided to the UE by means of dedicated signal-
ing (e.g., during the handover).
Scheduling and Transmission of PWS Messages
PWS messages originate from the cell broadcast center (CBC). These mes-
sages are forwarded to eNodeBs by the MME. PWS messages are broadcast 

134 
 
Radio Access Network
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
on SIB10, SIB11, and SIB12 messages. The schedule information for the 
broadcast is received along with the broadcast message content from the 
CBC. Because of the nature of these warnings, it is imperative that they are 
delivered quickly. Typically, these messages are also sent repeatedly to ensure 
their successful reception. There are mechanisms in place that ensure that 
only one copy of the same message is displayed to the user. That is, the user 
knows that every message displayed is a new warning message that requires 
special attention. In case of ETWS messages, the secondary notification is 
not as urgent as the primary notification, and indeed it may be segmented 
and scheduled over several SIB11 messages.
The eNodeB is also responsible for paging the UE to provide an indi-
cation that a warning notification is being broadcast.
PWS handling is specified in [2, 11, 12].
7.4  Home eNodeB
7.4.1  Introduction
Home eNodeB (HeNB) is a small low-powered LTE base station designed 
to be used in offices or homes (i.e., it is deployed by someone else than the 
mobile network operator). In marketing talk, HeNBs are commonly known 
as LTE femto cells, since the HeNB is an engineering term only. Note that 
another popular term for micro cells, a pico cell, refers to operator deployed 
small cells.
The HeNB, in principle, has all the functionality of a full macro eNo-
deB. It is connected to the evolved packet core (EPC) via a fixed connec-
tion, typically the Internet, and to UEs via normal air interface. One notable 
difference between the eNodeB and HeNB is that whereas an eNodeB can 
manage several cells, a HeNB controls only one cell. The HeNB system 
logical architecture is shown in Figure 7.6.
HeNBs can have an X2 interface between them, just like “real” eNo-
deBs. Toward the evolved packet core (EPC) they connect through the stan-
dard S1 interface. It is also possible to deploy a HeNB gateway between the 
HeNB and the EPC; it would act mainly as a signal traffic concentrator.
A HeNB can operate in three different access modes:
•• Closed access mode: HeNB provides services only to the members of its 
closed subscriber group (CSG).
•• Hybrid access mode: HeNB provides services both to its associated CSG 
members and to nonmembers, but CSG members are prioritized over 
nonmembers.

Home eNodeB 
 
135
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
•• Open access mode: HeNB appears as a normal eNB. Anybody can access 
its services, as long as they have a subscription or a roaming agreement 
with the mobile operator.
A HeNB will have a connection to mobile operator’s O&M system, 
and the operator can carry out O&M functions on the HeNB. These can 
include remote configuration of the HeNB, software upgrades, detecting 
and reporting changes in RF conditions, and performing general O&M 
tasks. One major worry for the operator is the interference caused by HeN-
Bs. Even though the operator can configure the HeNB via the O&M con-
nection, it will not (in most cases) physically install the HeNB. The owner 
of HeNB may deploy it as he wishes, and as a result the location may not be 
optimal from the whole network point of view; that is, there is no network 
planning. For example, the HeNB may transmit a radio beam through a 
window, which will then cause interference to mobile users who happen 
to be within the beam footprint. The problem may be even worse if the 
HeNB operates in the closed access mode, because with the open access 
mode the users suffering from HeNB interference would have the option 
to make a handover to the HeNB. However, in most cases the interference 
problems can be avoided if the HeNB implements interference mitiga-
tion techniques. Of course, interference can happen both ways: interference

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
caused by the macro cell can result in serious problems in HeNBs, especially 
if the HeNB is close to the macro cell transmitter. One approach to solve 
such a problem is to employ almost blank subframes (ABS) in the macro 
cell. This solution was already discussed in Section 7.2.1.2.
The easiest solution for HeNB interference problems would be to de-
ploy all HeNBs on a separate operating frequency. Unfortunately this is 
not always possible since radio spectrum is expensive and there is always a 
shortage of it (at least if you ask network operators).
In some countries there is a requirement that it should be possible to 
locate the caller who has made an emergency call. This means that the ex-
act position of the HeNB should be known to the network operator. The 
network operator can ask the HeNB location when the HeNB is registered 
with the operator for the first time, but the problem is that there is no 
guarantee that the device will stay in that location. For example, the HeNB 
owner may move to a new address with the HeNB and forget to update 
the address register. Or she may decide the take the HeNB with her to her 
holiday cottage for a weekend. A GPS device can be added to a HeNB to 
provide its location, but this approach may not work properly in all cases 
since HeNBs are typically installed indoors where the GPS coverage is poor.
The ability to locate the HeNB is also important for reasons other than 
emergency calls: it is easy to move a small HeNB around, so much so that 
there may be a temptation to take it to another country. When traveling, 
for example, it can be connected to a normal broadband connection, and at 
least in theory it could be used to make cheap calls back to home country. 
There are two problems with this approach:
1.	 The home PLMN operator most probably does not have a mobile 
network operating license in the other country.
2.	 A HeNB uses licensed spectrum, and it is tuned to use a specific 
part of that spectrum. In another country, this spectrum is licensed 
to some other operator or to some other purpose altogether.
HeNB service requirements are defined in [5]. Other useful HeNB 
information can be found from [2].
7.4.2  Closed Subscriber Group (CSG)
CSG refers to a defined group of users that are allowed to access a HeNB 
that operates in a closed access mode. Typically, the UE’s identities belonging 
to a CSG are registered when the HeNB is first set up, but it is also possible 
to modify the CSG list later.
A closed access mode HeNB allows connections only from a UE that is 
a member of the corresponding CSG. Most HeNBs are of this type, and it is 
understandable that a HeNB owner does not want the whole neighborhood 

	
7.4 
Home eNodeB 
 
137
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
to use his broadband connection and to fill it with data traffic. This would 
certainly be the case if a HeNB were to operate in an open access mode 
in a densely built area. A hybrid access mode HeNB also allows all UEs to 
access it, but CSG members are given higher priority in case of congestion.
7.4.3  HeNB Mobility
Mobility between HeNBs and eNodeBs is supported both ways: to and 
from the HeNB. From Release 9 onward mobility between HeNBs is also 
supported (using the S1 interface), and from Release 10 onward the HeNB 
to HeNB handover can be done via the X2 interface. However, the direct 
X2 handover is allowed only if no access control by the MME is required. 
That is, both HeNBs should operate in open or hybrid access mode, or their 
CSG IDs should be the same.
Mobility from a HeNB to a eNodeB follows the standard intra-RAN 
handover procedure, but mobility to a HeNB requires some special atten-
tion. If the target HeNB is operating in the closed access mode, the MME 
has to check that the UE is a member of the CSG. In case of hybrid access 
mode, the MME accepts the handover even if the UE is not a member of 
the CSG, but the nonmember status is indicated to the target HeNB, which 
may “de-prioritize” this UE in case of congestion.
7.4.4  HeNB Gateway
The E-UTRAN architecture may also employ an optional home eNB gate-
way (HeNB GW) to allow the S1 interface between the HeNB and the 
EPC to support a large number of HeNBs in a scalable manner. However, 
it is likely that this gateway is used only in the S1-MME interface. The 
U-plane (S1-U interface) will most often have a direct connection to the 
S-GW. The HeNB GW is located in the operator’s premises; it is not some-
thing a home user would purchase. A typical HeNB GW can serve tens of 
thousands of HeNBs.
The HeNB GW appears to the MME as an eNB, and to the HeNB it 
appears as an MME. Therefore the HeNB GW is “transparent” in the sense 
that neither entity, HeNB or MME, needs to know about its existence. The 
S1 interface between the HeNB and the EPC stays the same, regardless of 
whether the HeNB is connected to the core network via a HeNB GW 
or via a direct interface. See Figures 7.7 and 7.8 for HeNB GW protocol 
stacks.
7.4.5  Traffic Offloading
Traffic offloading refers to technologies that route data traffic from the U-
plane directly to the Internet or to some other IP network, bypassing the 

138 
 
Radio Access Network
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
mobile core network. This will result in less congestion in the EPC and a 
shorter round trip time (RTT) for user data. The main technologies stan-
dardized in 3GPP for traffic offloading are local IP access (LIPA) and se-
lected IP traffic offload (SIPTO) [1, 13–15].
Note that from a mobile operator point of view, LIPA and SIPTO 
are useful technologies not only because they ease the network load but 
also because with LIPA and SIPTO (and other similar mechanisms yet to 
be standardized) the operators can keep the mobile user as their customer 
even when the UE is connected to a local network printer or browses 
the Internet. In principle, the mobile user could do both of those things 
without connecting to the mobile network, signaling-wise, but by adding 
LIPA and SIPTO into its service palette, the mobile operator can stay in 
control and can even charge for the usage of those services. This is very 
important for operators since users are increasingly accessing the services in

the Internet with mobile devices that are not traditional mobile phones and 
may not have a subscription with a mobile operator. In this context, LIPA 
and SIPTO can be seen as technologies that can help mobile operators to 
keep mobile users as their customers.
7.4.5.1  LIPA
From Release 10 onward, HeNBs can support LIPA. However, UEs do not 
have to be Release 10 conformant in order to use LIPA; older mobiles can 
also enjoy this improvement if the network supports it. Using LIPA, an IP-
capable UE that is connected to an HeNB can connect to other IP capable 
entities in the same local IP network via a local gateway (L-GW). Data 
traffic for LIPA does not traverse through the EPC (but the signaling does). 
The decision whether or not the HeNB operates in the LIPA mode remains 
under the control of the mobile network operator. 
For a LIPA packet data network connection, the HeNB sets up and 
maintains an S5 connection to the EPC. This S5 interface does not go via 
the HeNB GW. The mobility of the LIPA PDN connection is not sup-
ported; the LIPA connection is always released at outgoing handover. The 
L-GW function in the HeNB triggers the release over the S5 interface. See 
Figure 7.9 for the LIPA architecture. 
7.4.5.2  SIPTO
SIPTO stands for selected IP traffic offload. This term means that some 
IP traffic from HeNB can be routed directly to the Internet, therefore by-
passing the EPC. One major difference between LIPA and SIPTO is that 
whereas LIPA can operate with HeNBs only, SIPTO can offload traffic from 
both HeNBs and eNodeBs.
For SIPTO there are three different architectures specified.
SIPTO Above RAN
This SIPTO function enables a mobile operator to offload certain types of 
traffic at a L-GW close to the (H)eNB that the UE is attached to. SIPTO 
above RAN architecture (Figure 7.10) selects a L-GW that is near the UE’s 
point of attachment. The obvious problem with this approach is that it does 
not reduce any traffic in RAN since the L-GW is in the EPC. SIPTO above 
RAN was first specified in Release 10.
SIPTO at the Local Network with L-GW Collocated with the (H)eNB.
In this SIPTO architecture, the L-GW is collocated with the (H)eNB (see 
Figure 7.11). The MME shall use the LGW address proposed by the (H)
eNB in the S1-AP message, instead of selecting the PGW via DNS inter-
rogation. The S-GW remains in the mobile operator’s core network. In this

solution, the IP traffic is already sent to the Internet from the local (H)eNB, 
so it does not load the mobile network unnecessarily. This version of SIPTO 
was specified in Release 12.
SIPTO at the Local Network with Standalone GW (S-GW and L-GW 
Collocated)
In this SIPTO architecture, the stand-alone GW resides in the local network 
(see Figure 7.12). This GW includes both the L-GW and the S-GW func-
tionality. The gateway and (H)eNBs can be separate nodes (i.e., one gateway 
can serve a number of (H)eNBs).
Also in this solution, the IP traffic is already sent to the Internet from 
RAN, though not directly from the local (H)eNB, so the IP traffic load in 
the mobile network is greatly reduced. This version of SIPTO was specified 
in Release 12.

Radio Access Network
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
7.5  Relay Node
Relay node (RN) [2, 6] is an eNodeB that is wirelessly connected to an 
eNodeB serving the RN. RNs can be used to improve the coverage of the 
mobile network (e.g., in radio blackspots or areas where it is difficult to 
build conventional fiber backhaul).
The RN can be either inband or outband type. An inband RN uses 
the same carrier frequency for both the backhaul and access links. An out-
band RN employs different frequencies for both links. The inband RN will 
probably be the most common type in use.
This serving eNodeB is called the donor eNodeB (DeNB). The RN 
looks like a “real” eNodeB to a UE, and like a UE to the DeNB. The RN 
and the DeNB are connected by an air interface that is a modification of the 
standard LTE air interface Uu. We call this modified interface Un. Because 
the RN is an eNodeB, its backhaul toward the DeNB should also include

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Because the interface between the RN and the DeNB has to support 
several logical interfaces, the number of protocols involved is also large (see 
Figures 7.14, 7.15, and 7.16).
LTE-A has supported relays from Release 10 onward. Relay nodes are a 
new LTE-A feature, and they are discussed in depth in Chapter 11.

Chapter 8
Core Network: Evolved Packet Core
8.1  Introduction
So far this book has discussed LTE and LTE-advanced. The latter term espe-
cially is becoming synonymous with the 4G mobile communications net-
work. However, strictly speaking LTE (and LTE-A) cover only the access 
network evolution (i.e., E-UTRAN). A mobile communications system 
also needs a core network to function. The core network consists of equip-
ment such as switches, gateways, and registers, and the transmission medium 
between those. In a similar way as the access network, also the 3GPP core 
network has undergone a major evolution so that it can support the packet-
based access network and the new services it can provide. This evolution is 
known as the system architecture evolution (SAE).
The concepts and their names around core networks are often misused 
or misinterpreted. SAE and LTE should be used in equal terms: SAE is 
the core network evolution process and LTE is the access network evolu-
tion. However, quite often everything new in 3GPP systems is labeled as 
LTE, at least by people outside the 3GPP community. The LTE process has 
produced E-UTRAN. In a similar way the SAE process has produced the 
evolved packet core (EPC), the new packet-only core network system. To-
gether E-UTRAN and EPC form the evolved packet system (EPS), which 
covers everything from UEs to registers and switches in the core network. 
Unfortunately, EPS as a concept is not well known, and not many people 
can connect that abbreviation to the latest mobile telecommunications sys-
tem by 3GPP. Therefore, the name of this book is “Introduction to 4G Mo-
bile Communications” and not “Introduction to Evolved Packet System”.
It is also possible, at least in theory, to attach the EPC into a non-3GPP 
access network. Such networks could include, for example, CDMA2000, 
mobile WiMAX, and WLAN access networks. However, attaching a non-
3GPP access network to the EPC is never a simple plug-and-play exercise. 
Reference [1] presents a long list of architecture enhancements and ad-
ditional functions that are needed in the EPC in case a non-3GPP access 
network were to be employed. 
The EPC functionality in case of non-3GPP access also depends on 
whether the non-3GPP access is regarded as trusted or untrusted (i.e., 
whether the core network operator believes that the access network can 

148 
 
Core Network: Evolved Packet Core
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
provide a high enough security level so that the UEs can access the EPC 
via this network without additional security at the EPC). If the network 
operator believes that the access network is untrusted, then the access from 
that network will take place through an additional network entity called the 
evolved packet data gateway (ePDG). The ePDG provides security mecha-
nisms such as IPsec tunneling of UE connections over an untrusted access 
network.
8.2  Architecture
In this chapter we will introduce the EPC, its components and interfaces, 
its protocols, and its most important tasks. Figure 8.1 shows the overall EPC 
architecture. This diagram also depicts E-UTRAN, which is outside the 
EPC, but this is just to show how various entities in the EPC connect to 
E-UTRAN via different interfaces. The EPC is also often simply called the 
core network (CN). In fact, core network is a generic name, EPC is the 
SAE- (or LTE-) specific CN.
Note that the architecture diagram shows the functional entities in the 
EPC architecture. Whether these entities exist as separate physical entities 
is up to the network operator to decide. For example, the MME and the 
S-GW can be implemented as a single physical node; SGW and PDN GW 
is also a common combination. Depending on the services provided, several 
additional functional entities may be added to the diagram. For a full list of 
different entities in an EPC network, please consult [2]. 
The EPC architecture in Figure 8.1 consists of the following entities:
•• Mobility management entity (MME);
•• Serving gateway (S-GW);
•• Packet data network gateway (P-GW);
•• Home subscriber server (HSS);
•• Evolved serving mobile location center (E-SMLC);
•• Gateway mobile location center (GMLC);
•• Policy control and charging rules function (PCRF).
These entities are briefly discussed next.
8.2.1  Mobility Management Entity
The MME is probably the most important single entity in the EPC because 
all C-plane signaling traffic between the UE and the EPC will go through it. 

	
8.2 
Architecture

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
The MME controls, for the most part, what is happening in the E-UTRAN. 
The list of MME functions includes, among others:
•• Tracking the UE in the idle mode;
•• Paging the UE;
•• UE authentication;
•• Selection of the S-GW at the UE initial attach;
•• Selection of the P-GW;
•• Allocation of a wide variety of different temporary identities for the 
UE;
•• Termination NAS signaling protocols;
•• NAS signaling security;
•• Support for the lawful interception (LI) of signaling traffic;
•• Bearer management;
•• Support for PWS message transmission;
•• Selection of the SGSN in handovers to UMTS networks;
•• MME selection for handovers that result in MME change;

•• Roaming;
•• Suppory for relaying.
And the list continues. Many of these functions actually require coop-
eration from several entities. Chapter 9, Procedures, gives several examples 
of how the different nodes in the network interact with each other in order 
to provide certain functionality.
8.2.2  Serving GW
Whereas the MME is the first contact point in the EPC for access network 
control plane signaling, the serving gateway (S-GW) fulfills the same func-
tion for user plane data. All user data to and from a UE will go through the 
S-GW; it is the first point of interconnect between the E-UTRAN and 
the EPC. The S-GW routes the incoming and outgoing IP packets to their 
correct destinations. Each UE is assigned a S-GW when the UE does the 
initial attach, and there cannot be more than one S-GW assigned for a UE 
at a given time. The S-GW is logically connected to the other EPC data 
gateway, the PDN GW.
The serving gateway implements the following functions:
•• The local mobility anchor point for inter-eNodeB handover;
•• Mobility anchoring for mobility to/from UMTS;
•• E-UTRAN idle mode downlink packet buffering and initiation of net-
work triggered service request procedure;
•• Lawful interception of user data;
•• Packet routing and forwarding;
•• Transport level packet marking in the uplink and the downlink;
•• Accounting for interoperator charging;
•• Event reporting (e.g., change of RAT) to the PCRF.
8.2.3  Packet Data Network Gateway
The packet data network gateway (PDN GW, or P-GW) connects the EPC 
and the external IP networks, such as the Internet. The PDN GW routes 
user data packets to and from the PDNs (i.e, it handles the transport of IP 
data traffic between the UE and the external networks).
Often, both the P-GW and the S-GW functionality are combined into 
a single device by network vendors. However, whereas there can be only 

	
8.2 
Architecture 
 
151
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
one S-GW per UE, it is possible to have more than one P-GW per UE if 
the UE is accessing several PDNs simultaneously.
The PDN GW performs the following functions:
•• Per-user-based packet filtering (e.g., by deep packet inspection);
•• Lawful interception;
•• IP address allocation for UEs;
•• Transport level packet marking in the uplink and downlink, based on 
the quality of service class identifier (QCI) of the associated bearer;
•• UL and DL service level charging, gating, and rate enforcement;
•• DL rate enforcement based on the APN aggregate maximum bit rate 
(APN-AMBR).
The APN aggregate maximum bit rate (APN-AMBR) is the maximum 
allowed total non-GBR throughput to specific APN. It is specified interde-
pendently for the uplink and the downlink.
8.2.4  Home Subscriber Server
The home subscriber server (HSS) is a database that contains user-related 
information. It also provides some support functions for the following:
•• Mobility management;
•• Call and session setup;
•• User authentication;
•• Access authorization.
The authentication center (AuC), which generates authentication and 
security keys, is often integrated into the HSS. 
Other EPC entities consult HSS whenever they need some informa-
tion about the user. IMSI is the main reference key to any data that is stored 
in the HSS. Table 8.1 gives an example of the data held in the HSS [3].
8.2.5  Evolved Serving Mobile Location Center
The evolved serving mobile location center (E-SMLC) is a server that sup-
ports different location services for target UEs, including positioning of UEs 
and delivery of assistance data to UEs. Positioning has become an important 
application for UEs for many reasons. The mobile user may want to know 
where he is; therefore, the position data in itself is a service. Positioning may

also be used to enhance many other services. For example, if the mobile user 
wants to find a certain type of restaurant, the mobile operator may give him 
a selection of locations to choose from if the operator knows the UE’s loca-
tion. The governmental organizations may also be interested in the UE loca-
tion. In United States, the FCC E-911 requirements, phase 2, stipulates that 
the network operator must be able to provide the location of emergency 
callers, anywhere between 50 meters and 300 meters of their actual position, 
depending on whether GPS handset or network-based E-911 technology 
is used. Even though FCC E-911 phase 2 is a US requirement only, similar 
requirements are likely to be adopted by many other countries.
The E-SMLC can employ both UE- and eNodeB-based positioning 
methods, or a combination of those methods to estimate the location of 
the UE. It may order the UE or the eNodeB (or several eNodeBs) to

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
perform positioning measurements and report the results to the E-SMLC. 
The method(s) chosen depend on UE and eNodeB positioning capabili-
ties and the positioning requirements (especially accuracy). Some of the 
positioning measurements may require assistance data to be provided to 
the UE by the E-SMLC. Note that some measurements may have already 
taken place as part of other procedures, such as handover preparation. The 
E-SMLC combines all the received results and determines a single location 
estimate for the target UE. Additional information like accuracy of the lo-
cation estimate and velocity of the UE may also be provided.
The E-SMLC is connected to the MME via the SLs interface. LTE 
positioning protocol (LPP) is an end-to-end location protocol running be-
tween the UE and the E-SMLC. LPP acts as a method-agnostic supporting 
protocol for various UE positioning methods:
•• Observed time difference of arrival (OTDOA);
•• Global navigation satellite system (GNSS) and assisted GNSS (A-GNSS);
•• Enhanced cell ID methods.
ODTOA is a downlink positioning method based on measured time 
differences observed by the UE from different eNodeBs. GNSS is a generic 
name for different satellite-based positioning methods such as GPS, Galileo, 
GLONASS, and Beidou. Assisted GNSS means that the base station pro-
vides additional satellite positioning data to UEs so that as a result, UE’s own 
satellite positioning process is much quicker.
Positioning is a service that is certainly going to become much more 
important in the future. Positioning is needed by everybody, and the num-
ber of various location-based services is increasing. However, the wide-
spread adoption of positioning technology has also brought about questions 
on its effect on privacy. From a pure technical point of view, positioning 
technologies enable the UE location to be monitored and logged continu-
ously. Is the network operator allowed to do this? Who has the access to 
positioning data? E911 stipulates that the location of the UE should be 
made available in case of an emergency calls, but how about other govern-
mental usage of location data? Can the police track the suspect 24/7? Can 
the positioning data be sold if the UE identifying information has been 
removed it? Is it OK to track the UE without the user knowing it (e.g., a 
company tracking the business phones of its employees or parents tracking 
the mobile phone of their child)? These are questions that need answers, 
preferably sooner than later. Positioning data is valuable, and it should have 
well-defined legal protection.

8.2.6  Gateway Mobile Location Center
The gateway mobile location center (GMLC) is the first node in the EPC 
that an external location application accesses. The GMLC checks the au-
thorization for the location request, and, if the result is positive, the GMLC 
sends the positioning request to the MME. The MME forwards the request 
to the E-SMLC, which is responsible for the actual positioning process. 
There may be more than one GMLC in a PLMN.
8.2.7  Policy Control and Charging Rules Function
The policy and charging rules function (PCRF) acts as a policy decision 
point for policy and charging control of service data flows and IP bearer re-
sources. The applicable policy and charging control is communicated to the 
policy control enforcement function (PCEF), which is located in the PDN 
GW. The PCRF checks the user’s subscription profile, and then provides the 
QoS authorization that tells the PCEF how a data flow should be treated so 
that the resulting QoS conforms with the user’s subscription. See [2, 4] for 
further information.
8.3  EPC Interfaces and Protocols
EPC has a large number of different interfaces between its entities, and 
each of these interfaces need protocols to relay communication. This section 
presents the most important interfaces in the EPC. Again, it must be noted 
that these logical interfaces do not always exist in deployed networks; a ven-
dor may have implemented several functional entities in the same physical 
device, in which case there are no interfaces between them.
The functional entities and interfaces are different in control and user 
planes. For example, MME is a pure control plane entity, and S-GW exists 
in the user plane. Therefore, the presentation in this section is divided in two 
parts. First we discuss the control plane and then the user plane.
8.3.1  EPC Control Plane
EPC interfaces are wired interfaces, and therefore many of the protocols 
in them are not specified by 3GPP. Because 3GPP is specialized in drafting 
wireless standards, re-inventing the wheel was not sensible. Therefore, the 
lower layers (physical and transport network layers) in many EPC inter-
faces are implemented using non-3GPP protocols. In fact, 3GPP specifica-
tions exist for all of these protocol layers, but, for example, 3GPP TS 36.411 
(S1 Layer 1) simply states that: “The support of any suitable layer 1 tech-
nique—like point-to-point or point-to-multipoint techniques—shall not 

156

be prevented.” That is, 3GPP specifications do not really stipulate what kind 
of layer 1 an operator should use in its S1 interface. 
The same applies to all interfaces in the EPC: the physical layer and the 
data link layer are left for the network operator to choose and implement. 
The IP layer can support IPv4 and/or IPv6.
8.3.1.1  S1-MME Interface
The S1-MME interface is located between the eNodeB and the MME. It 
handles all signaling traffic between the E-UTRAN and the EPC.
The protocols in this interface are as follows:
•• The S1 application protocol (S1AP): This is the application layer control 
protocol between the eNodeB and the MME. It is defined in [5]. This 
specification is large and contains many important functions.
•• Stream control transmission protocol (SCTP): This protocol guarantees 
delivery of signaling messages between MME and eNodeB (S1). SCTP 
is defined in [6] (see Figure 8.2).
8.3.1.2  UE-MME Interface
The UE-MME interface is a special case because actually it is a combina-
tion of two individual interfaces, Uu and S1-MME. It is presented here 
because the nonaccess stratum (NAS) protocol is specified to be used over 
eNodeB

the UE-MME interface. The NAS protocol is transparent to the eNodeB, 
which is situated between the Uu and S1-MME interfaces (see Figure 8.3).
The NAS protocol supports the following:
•• Mobility management;
•• U-plane bearer activation, modification, and deactivation;
•• Ciphering and integrity protection of NAS signaling.
The NAS procedures are grouped in two categories:
•• The EPS mobility management (EMM);
•• The EPS session management (ESM).
The EPS mobility management protocol refers to procedures related 
to mobility over the E-UTRAN access, authentication, and security. The 
EPS session management protocol offers support to the establishment and 
handling of user data in the NAS. The NAS protocol is defined in [7].

8.3.1.3  S5/S8 Interface
This interface is located between the S-GW and the P-GW. It defines user 
plane tunneling and tunnel management between these entities. It is also 
used for the S-GW relocation due to UE mobility. The S8 interface is the 
inter-PLMN variant of the S5 interface (see Figure 8.4).
The protocols in this interface include the following:
•• GPRS tunneling protocol for the control plane (GTP-C): This protocol 
tunnels signaling messages between S-GW and P-GW (S5 or S8). The 
GTP-C is defined in [8].
•• User datagram protocol (UDP): This protocol transfers signaling mes-
sages between S-GW and P-GW. The UDP is defined in [9].
8.3.1.4  S10 Interface
This interface is located between two MMEs. It handles the MME reloca-
tion and MME to MME information transfer. Its protocols are the same as 
in the S5 interface (see Figure 8.5).

signaling messages. SCTP is defined in [6].
8.3.1.7  S13 Interface
This interface is located between the MME and the equipment identity 
register (EIR). It is used for UE identity checks (i.e., to check the identity 
of the equipment itself). The protocols in this interface are the same as in the 
S6a interface (see Figure 8.8).
8.3.1.8  S7a Interface
This interface is located between the MME and the CSG subscriber server 
(CSS). It carries CSG subscription data for roaming subscribers only. Its 
protocols are the same as in the S6a interface (see Figure 8.9).
8.3.2  EPC User Plane
As with control plane protocols, the lower layers in user plane protocols are 
left for the operator to choose. The IP layer can support IPv4 and/or IPv6.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
The protocols in this interface include GPRS tunneling protocol for 
the user plane (GTP-U). This protocol tunnels user data between eNodeB 
and the S-GW. The GTP-U encapsulates all end-user IP packets. It is de-
fined in [11].
8.3.2.2  S4 Interface
This interface is located between the S-GW and the serving GPRS sup-
port node (SGSN) in the UMTS network. It provides control and mobility 
support between the GPRS core network and the S-GW. In addition, if the 
direct tunnel is not established, S4 provides user plane tunneling. S4 proto-
cols are the same as in the S1-U interface (see Figure 8.11).
8.3.2.3  S12 Interface
This interface is located between the S-GW and the radio network control-
ler (RNC) in UTRAN. It is used between UTRAN and the serving GW 
for user plane tunneling when the direct tunnel is established. The decision 
whether to use S12 is an operator configuration option. S12 protocols are 
the same as in the S1-U interface (see Figure 8.12).

Chapter 9
Procedures
9.1  Introduction
This chapter presents a selection of procedures that take place in E-UTRAN 
and EPC networks. The objective in this chapter has been to include proce-
dures that show how the various entities in the system interact.
9.2  Cell Search
Cell search is the first procedure done by a UE when its power has been 
switched on. It is a procedure by which the UE acquires time and frequency 
synchronization with a cell and detects the cell ID of that cell. Without the 
initial synchronization, the UE cannot read system information broadcasts 
and thus cannot continue to perform any other procedures.
After the UE switch-on, the UE measures the wideband received pow-
er from several frequencies over a set of frequency bands. The frequencies 
are ranked based on their received signal strength indicator (RSSI), and the 
UE attempts the cell search starting from the best cell, using the downlink 
synchronization channels.
Note that in practical UE implementations, when the UE is switched 
off, it stores on the SIM card the cell search parameters of the last cell it was 
camped on. When the UE is again switched on, it may first try to see if the 
last cell is still available. If not, then the UE will go for the full cell scan as 
described in the previous paragraph. In most cases this arrangement works, 
noticeably cutting the time when the UE is out of service.
The eNodeB transmits two types of signals in order to help the UE 
with the synchronization process: the primary synchronization signal (PSS) 
and the secondary synchronization signal (SSS). The PSS and SSS are trans-
mitted over the center 72 subcarriers in the first and sixth subframe of each 
frame. The PSS is sent in the last symbol of slots number 0 and 10, and the 
SSS as the next-to-last symbol in the same slots (see Figure 9.1).
There are three different PSS sequences, and each cell transmits only 
one of them. Once the UE detects the correct PSS sequence, it knows 
both the slot timing and the cell identity within a cell group (the three PSS 

170 
 
Procedures
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
sequences map into three cell IDs). Thereafter, the UE cross-correlates the 
same channel with 168 possible SSS sequences. The contents of the PSS 
are the same in every slot it is transmitted, but SSS contents are alternated: 
different coding is used for SSS in slot number 0 and in slot number 10. 
However, the data contents of the SSS sequence are the same in both cases. 
The purpose of this arrangement is that once the UE manages to find the 
right SSS sequence, it knows at once where the frame boundary lies because 
it knows whether this slot is number 0 or number 10. Also, the separation in 
time of PSS and SSS symbols indicates whether the cell employs a normal 
or an extended cyclic prefix (CP) (see Figure 9.2).
As mentioned before, the SSS sequence also indicates the cell ID group 
number (0–167). By combining the cell group number, and the cell ID 
within the group (obtained from the PSS), the UE knows the physical cell 
identity (PCI). The PCI has a very important property in that it indicates 
the location of cell-specific reference signals in downlink frames. These ref-
erence signals are used for channel estimation.

Random Access 
 
171
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
There are all together 504 locally unique PCIs. The network operator 
should take care that the same PCI is not allocated for two cells that are lo-
cated near each other, because this may lead to PCI confusion: the UE can-
not distinguish the downlink transmissions of two cells with the same PCI. 
Normally in a macro-cell network the number of PCIs is large enough that 
the PCI confusion can be avoided, but femtocell deployments may easily 
result in PCI confusion. This is especially true in the case of HeNBs because 
those devices can be deployed anywhere, and the HeNB owner cannot be 
assumed to know about technical details such as PCI confusion.
PSS and SSS sequences are sent only on the central 72 subcarriers of any 
channel, regardless of the total channel bandwidth. This arrangement allows 
the UE to perform the synchronization without any preknowledge of the 
channel bandwidth, because synchronization signals are always transmitted 
on same frequency positions in relation to the channel central frequency.
Once the UE has obtained time and frequency synchronization, and it 
knows the PCI, it can start receiving system information. The first system 
information message to be received is the master information block (MIB), 
which contains three important pieces of information:
•• The downlink channel bandwidth;
•• The system frame number;
•• The physical hybrid ARQ indicator channel configuration info.
With this information the UE can receive and decode system infor-
mation block type 1 and thereafter all other required system information 
blocks.
The description of the cell search procedure is divided between several 
specifications. The best place to start is [1].
9.3  Random Access
The random access procedure is performed when the UE does not yet have 
any connection with the network. With random access, the UE gains uplink 
time synchronization, which is prerequisite for any two-way air interface 
communication. Note that the UE can gain downlink time synchronization 
simply by listening the eNodeB and receiving synchronization signals, as 
described in Section 9.2.
A UE does not have uplink time synchronization with a cell, for ex-
ample, in following cases:
•• This is UE’s initial access for this eNodeB.

172 
 
Procedures
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
•• Existing connection has failed, and an RRC connection reestablish-
ment is attempted.
•• Handover to a new cell.
The random access can be either contention-, or noncontention-based. 
In noncontention-based random access, the UE has to use a random ac-
cess preamble that is assigned to it by the eNodeB via dedicated signaling. 
Obviously this is possible only in special cases where there already exists a 
dedicated connection with the UE (e.g., in handovers when the preamble 
can be sent via the old cell).
Figure 9.3 depicts the contention-based random access procedure. In 
LTE, random access is a MAC layer procedure and therefore specified in 
[2]. Additional random access information can also be found from [1, 3–5].
1.	 The random access procedure starts when the UE sends a random 
access preamble on the PRACH channel. The preamble is actually 
a 6-bit-long random ID. Each cell has 64 different random access 
preambles, although not all of them are available for contention-
based random access. The UE selects one of them and transmits it 
in the next subframe that is allocated for the PRACH channel.
2.	 The eNodeB responds with a random access response (RAR) on 
the PDSCH using the same preamble it just received. The UE lis-
tens to this channel during the RAR time window, which starts at 
the subframe that contains the end of the preamble transmission 
plus three subframes and has a configurable length in subframes 
(see Figure 9.4). The response message also contains uplink timing

alignment information, uplink resource grant for the next uplink 
message, and a temporary cell radio network temporary identifier 
(C-RNTI). Note that it is possible that more than one UE got the 
same response message in case they has selected the same preamble 
in phase 1 and then transmitted it at the same time and at the same 
frequency. This clash can be resolved later, as shown in phase 4.
	
If the UE did not receive a response within the RAR time window, 
then it has to try again. A new random access preamble must be 
chosen, and the UE must delay the new preamble transmission by 
the parameter backoff time.
3.	 In phase 3 the UE sends its first scheduled uplink transmission 
on the PUSCH channel. This message contains the actual message 
for which the whole random access procedure was started (e.g., 
an RRC connection request). This message must also contain the 
UE NAS identifier if this procedure is an initial UE access or a 
C-RNTI if that was assigned to the UE earlier via dedicated sig-
naling. (Note: therefore this C-RNTI is not the same identifier as 
the temporary C-RNTI assigned in phase 2.) It is important that a 
unique UE identifier is transmitted in this phase because the same 
identifier will be used for contention resolution in phase 4.
4.	 Contention resolution: the eNodeB sends a HARQ feedback mes-
sage on the PDCCH using the UE identifier that it just received in 
phase 3. Since this identifier is unique and known to only one UE, 
other UEs will understand that a random access clash has happened 
and will stop their random access procedures.

9.4  Tracking Area Update
Tracking areas (TAs) are used in LTE to locate UEs for paging. The corre-
sponding concepts in UMTS are location areas and routing areas. In UMTS 
both are needed because location area is a CS domain concept and rout-
ing area a PS domain concept. In LTE there is only one domain, packet 
switched, and so only tracking areas are needed.
A tracking area contains a group of cells. How big this group is and 
which cells belong to the same group depend on network planning. A group 
of TAs forms a tracking area identity (TAI) list. A TA is a parameter that is 
common to all users. It is broadcast in cell’s system information messages. 
A TAI list, on the other hand, is a tailor-made parameter for each user. The 
reason for this arrangement is that a TA alone would be a poor method to 
keep track of a UE. It would be impossible to design TAs that would suit for 
all users because users’ movement patterns are very different. If you design 
a TA for user A along her daily movement patterns, trying to minimize her 
TA boundary crossings, the same TA map may cause numerous TA updates 
for user B with his different movement patterns.
The TAI list contains a number of TA identities, up to 16 in Release 
12. Instead of the network paging the UE in one TA, the UE is now paged 
in all TAs in the TAI list. The TAI list of each user is stored in the serv-
ing MME. The TAI list concept gives the network planner great flexibility. 
Now each user can be given her own tracking area scheme. The UE triggers 
a tracking area update only when it camps on a cell whose TA is not found 
from the UE’s TAI list. The triggered tracking area update request contains 
the new TA to be added to UE’s TAI list. It is up to MME to decide how 
many TA entries there are in UE’s TAI list and according to which policy 
any older TAs are removed from it. 
The smaller the TAI list is, the fewer paging messages are needed. Be-
cause a paging message has to be sent in all cells in all TAs in the TAI list, the 
number of paging messages could be very large with a large TAI list. This 
would suggest that a very small TAI list is preferable. If the tracking area 
covers only one cell, and the TAI list contains only this TA, then the paging 
has to be carried out only in one cell. However, the UE also has to perform 
a tracking area update every time it crosses a cell boundary to a TA that is 
not in its TAI list. With small TAI lists, this happens more often. Therefore, a 
network planner must find a good balance between suitably sized tracking 
areas and individually tailored TAI lists according to each user’s movement 
and usage patters. This is a balancing act between the number of paging 
and tracking area update procedures. Moreover, selecting correct cells into 
a TA is important. For example, it is usually a good idea to group the cells 
along a busy road into the same tracking area. The TA and TAI list concept 
is depicted in Figure 9.5.

175
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
In this example, Jill is commuting to her office daily using a route via 
cells 3, 1, 8, 9, and 15. Jack prefers trains for commuting and uses a route via 
cells 12, 14, 13, 9, 7, and 6. If Jill’s TAI list contains TAs 1, 3, 5, and 6, her UE 
does not have to make any tracking area updates during her daily commute. 
Similarly Jack’s TAI list 2, 3, and 4 gives him journeys without tracking area 
updates. However, the drawback is that a paging message has to be sent to 
all of these TAs. In Jill’s cases this includes cells 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 9, and 15. A 
paging message to Jack has to be sent to cells 6, 7, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14.
A TA update can also be periodic. The network sends a value for timer 
T3412 via dedicated signaling, and, once this timer expires, the UE has to 
start a tracking area update. Note that this timer is UE specific, not cell or 
TA specific. Therefore, the network can adjust the value of this timer ac-
cording to user’s behavior. For example, there is no need to request frequent 
tracking area updates from a user who always stays within a one tracking 
area.
The example procedures here include two tracking area updates: first 
a basic update (Figure 9.6) and then a full tracking area update with MME 
and S-GW changes (Figure 9.7).
1.	 There are several reasons a tracking area update procedure can be 
triggered. However, the most usual cases are that in the idle mode 
the UE has camped on a new cell belonging to a tracking area 
that is not part of the UE’s registered TAI list or that the periodic

Procedures
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
TA update timer has expired. For other TAU triggering reasons, 
consult Section 5.5.3.1 of [6]. The procedure starts with the UE 
sending a NAS: Tracking_Area_Update_Request to the eNodeB. 
This message contains the current GUMMEI parameter. Before 
this message can be sent over the air interface, a connection must 
be established using the random access procedure.
2.	 The eNodeB checks the destination MME from the GUMMEI 
parameter. If that parameter is not available, or the destination 
MME is not associated with the eNodeB, the eNodeB has to select 
a new MME. The NAS: Tracking_Area_Update_Request is then 
sent over to the new MME within the S1AP: Initial_UE_Message. 
However, in this case there will not be a change of MME, so the 
message goes to the serving MME.
3.	 The MME performs an integrity check to the received tracking 
area update request message. If it fails, an authentication procedure 
will follow. Otherwise, the MME considers the procedure success-
ful and sends a NAS: Tracking Area_Update_Accept message to 
the eNodeB, encapsulated into a S1AP: Downlink_NAS_Trans-
port message. This message contains the new TAI list. Note that it 
is up to the MME implementation to decide how big the TAI list 
is and which TAIs it will include. The maximum size of the TAI list 
is 16 TAIs in release 12 specifications.
4.	 The eNodeB delivers the NAS: Tracking_Area_Update_Accept 
message further to the UE.

Procedures
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
As seen, the tracking area update can be a simple process if both MME 
and S-GW remain the same in the procedure. This is the case in most track-
ing area update procedures if the S1-flex scheme is employed in the S1 
interface. In S1-flex, several MMEs and S-GWs can form a pool in which 
they share the load within the pool members. One eNodeB is simultane-
ously connected to all MMEs and S-GWs within the pool. However, as 
long as the UE stays within the pool area, its context will normally remain 
with the same MME. This is to avoid unnecessary update procedures within 
the network every time the serving MME changes.
Tracking area update (TAU) with MME and S-GW changes is a much 
more complex procedure than the previous basic procedure. If S1-flex is 
employed, then this procedure will take place when the UE crosses the 
MME pool area edge.
1.	 Step 1 here is similar to step 1 in the previous example.
2.	 The eNodeB checks the destination MME from the GUMMEI 
parameter. If that parameter is not available or the destination 
MME is not associated with the eNodeB, the eNodeB has to select 
a new MME. Since this scenario is about a TAU with MME and 
S-GW changes, then the MME indicated by GUMMEI is not as-
sociated with the eNodeB, and a new MME must be selected. The 
eNodeB will send the NAS: Tracking_Area_Update_Request mes-
sage within the S1AP: Initial_UE_Message to the new MME.
3.	 The MME uses the old GUMMEI to find the identity of the old 
MME and sends a GTP-C: Context_Request message to the old 
MME in order to retrieve the user information. The old MME 
starts a timer, which will be later used in step 14.
4.	 The old MME responds with a GTP-C: Context_Response mes-
sage, which includes the stored UE context.
5.	 If the MME decides to change the S-GW, it will then send a GTP-
C: Context_Acknowledge message to the old MME, indicating 
that the S-GW will change, too. On receiving this message, the old 
MME marks into its UE context that the related information in the 
S-GW and in the HSS is invalid. 
6.	 The new MME compares the EPS bearer status received from the 
UE with the bearer contexts received from the old MME and re-
leases any network resources related to EPS bearers that are not 
active in the UE. The new MME will then send a GTP-C: Cre-
ate_Session_Request message to the new S-GW.
7.	 The S-GW informs the P-GW about the change with a GTP-C: 
Modify_Bearer_Request message.
8.	 The P-GW updates its bearer contexts and returns a GTP-C: 
Modify_Bearer_Response message.

	
9.5 
Initial Context Setup

9.	 The S-GW updates its own bearer context. This enables the SGW 
to route bearer PDUs to the P-GW when received from the eNo-
deB. After this the S-GW sends a GTP-C: Create_Session_Re-
sponse message to the new MME.
10.	 The new MME checks whether it holds subscription data for the 
UE. If the answer is no, the new MME sends a Diameter: Update_
Location_Request message to the HSS.
11.	 The HSS sends a Diameter: Cancel_Location_Request message to 
the old MME with the cancellation type set to “Update Procedure.”
12.	 The old MME removes the MM context of this UE from its re-
cords. The old MME acknowledges the message with a Diamater: 
Cancel_Location_Answer message.
13.	 The HSS sends a Diameter: Update_Location_Answer message to 
the new MME, with the IMSI and UE subscription data. The new 
MME will then construct a context for the UE.
14.	 Once the timer that was started in step 3 expires, the old MME re-
leases any local MME bearer resources and sends a GTP-C: Delete 
Session Request message to the old S-GW so that it can also delete 
all bearer resources related to the UE. The S-GW also discards any 
data packets buffered for the UE.
15.	 The S-GW acknowledges with a GTP-C: Delete_Session_Re-
sponse message to the old MME.
16.	 The new MME sends a NAS: Tracking_Area_Update_Accept mes-
sage to the UE. The GUMMEI is included if the MME allocated a 
new GUMMEI for the UE.
17.	 If the GUMMEI was included in step 16, then the UE acknowl-
edges the received message with a NAS: Tracking_Area_Update_
Complete message to the MME.
Tracking area updates are discussed in [7–9].
9.5  Initial Context Setup
Initial context setup is a procedure whereby the UE initiates a data connec-
tion (though the original request for that might have come from the net-
work in the form of paging), and the network side then allocates necessary 
resources in different nodes, updates registers, and creates bearers/sessions/
contexts so that the routing of messages for the new connection is clear for 
all participating nodes (see Figure 9.8).
1.	 The UE initiates the attach procedure by sending the NAS: Attach_
Request message to the eNodeB. In the RRC layer this message

is encapsulated into the RRC: UL_Information_Transfer message. 
This message contains the UE identity, tracking area identity, UE 
capability, various security parameters, and so on. Before it can be 
sent over the air interface, the UE must establish a dedicated con-
nection with the random access procedure.
2.	 The eNodeB checks the received message to find out if the UE is 
already associated with an MME (i.e., if there a GUMMEI param-
eter attached). Otherwise, the eNodeB selects an MME by using 
the MME selection function and then sends the S1AP: Initial_UE_
Message to the MME.
3.	 If the GUMMEI in the received message does not match MME’s 
own identity, then the MME has to send a GTP-C: Identification_
Request message to the old MME (identified by the GUMMEI). 
This message includes the attach request.
4.	 The old MME verifies the attach request and sends back a GTP-C: 
Identification_Response message.
5.	 The new MME sends a Diameter: Update_Location_Request 
message to the HSS.
6.	 The HSS sends back a Diameter: Update_Location_Answer mes-
sage that includes IMSI and subscription data. 
	
The new MME checks whether the UE is allowed to access the 
current tracking area and whether it has a valid subscription. If both 
cases are true, the MME creates a new context for the UE. The 
MME also selects a S-GW for the UE by using a S-GW selection 
function and allocates an EPS bearer identity. If the HSS did not 
indicate a P-GW address to the MME, then the MME also selects 
that address using a special selection function.
7.	 The MME sends a GTP-C: Create_Session_Request message to 
the S-GW, including the EPS bearer identity and the P-GW ad-
dress (among other parameters).
8.	 The S-GW adds the new EPS bearer identity into the EPS bearer 
table and sends a GTP-C: Create_Session_Request message to the 
P-GW.
9.	 The P-GW adds a new entry into its EPS bearer table. It also gen-
erates a charging ID. After that the PDN-GW sends a GTP-C: 
Create_Session_Response message back to the S-GW.
10.	 The S-GW sends a GTP-C: Create Session Response message to 
the MME. Both the S-GW and the P-GW are now aware of the 
new bearer/session.
11.	 The MME sends an S1AP: Initial_Context_Setup_Request mes-
sage to the eNodeB in order to set up the UE context. This mes-
sage also contains the NAS: Attach_Accept message.

182 
 
Procedures
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
12.	 When the eNodeB receives the message, it creates a new radio 
bearer based on the information in the message and then sends 
a RRC: RRC_Connection_Reconfiguration message to the UE, 
including the new EPS radio bearer identity and the encapsulated 
NAS: Attach_Accept and NAS: Activate_Dedicated_EPS_Bearer_
Context_Request messages.
13.	 The UE sends an RRC: RRC_Connection_Reconfiguration_
Complete message to the eNodeB to acknowledge the successful 
establishment of the radio bearer.
14.	 The eNodeB sends an S1AP: Initial_Context_Setup_Response 
message to the MME to acknowledge the successful context setup.
15.	 The UE sends an RRC: UL_Information_Transfer message to the 
eNodeB that includes the NAS: Attach_Complete and NAS: Acti-
vate_Dedicated_EPS_Bearer_Context_Accept messages.
16.	 The eNodeB sends the two NAS messages (encapsulated in the 
S1AP: Uplink_NAS_Transport message) to the MME.
17.	 After receiving the S1AP: Initial_Context_Setup_Response mes-
sage and the NAS messages, the MME sends a GTP-C: Modify_
Bearer_Request message to the S-GW, indicating the eNodeB user 
plane address.
18.	 The S-GW finishes the initial context setup procedure with a 
GTP-C: Modify_Bearer_Response message to the MME. 
The relevant signaling specifications used in this example are [5–10].
9.6  Handover (X2 interface)
Handover (HO) is a procedure in which the UE changes the serving eNo-
deB. The reason for this change is typically the change in radio conditions 
caused by the UE moving from one cell area to another. However, there can 
be other reasons, such as load balancing.
LTE handovers come in many different forms, depending on how the 
source and the target cells are related: intra-eNodeB HO, intra-MME/S-
GW HO via X2, intra-MME/S-GW HO via S1, inter-MME/intra-S1 
HO, inter-MME/S1 HO, and inter-RAT HO in various combinations.
In this example, we will show the intra-MME/S-GW HO via the X2 
interface. Note that the X2 interface is an optional interface. If the network 
operator does not support it, then the intra-MME/S-GW HO must be 
done via the S1 interface. Also, an X2 handover can only be made when 
both the serving MME and the serving S-GW do not change as a result of 
the handover (i.e., the source and the target eNodeB has to be served by the 
same MME and S-GW).

	
9.6 
Handover (X2 interface) 
 
183
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
A handover consists of three different phases:
•• Handover preparation;
•• Handover execution;
•• Handover completion.
These phases are also shown in Figure 9.9.
1.	 When a data call is ongoing, the UE measures its radio environ-
ment according to measurement configuration parameters given 
to it in RRC: RRCConnectionReconfiguration message. Note 
that there is no specific measurement request message in LTE, but 
the measurement configuration is indicated by the MeasConfig IE, 
which can be attached to the RRCConnectionReconfiguration 
message. The measurement process is a continuous one; typically, 
a UE is performing some type of radio measurements periodically 
while connected to the network.
2.	 The UE sends back to the source eNodeB (the current serving 
eNodeB) a RRC: MeasurementReport message. This message can 
be sent periodically, or it may sent once some triggering event oc-
curs. If the measurement results indicate that there is a more suit-
able cell available for the UE, the Source eNodeB may trigger a 
HO.
3.	 The handover algorithm is operator specific and may include, for 
example, an X2AP: Resource Status Request message to be sent to 
a potential target eNodeB in order to find out whether this poten-
tial target eNodeB is capable of handling the additional load caused 
by the UE to be handed over. Note that in E-UTRAN there is 
no central controller node in the radio access network that could 
make decisions on which eNodeB is the best base station to handle 
a UE connection. The source eNodeB has to make this decision 
itself and may need information from other eNodeBs in this pro-
cess. However, sending messages to other eNodeBs and waiting for 
responses takes time, and sometimes HOs have to be made urgently 
or the call may be lost.
4.	 If the X2AP: Resource_Status_Response shows that the target 
eNodeB could handle a new UE connection, the source eNodeB 
triggers the HO.
5.	 An X2 handover is started with an X2AP: Handover_Request 
message from the source eNodeB to the target eNodeB. The mes-
sage contains information that is needed by the target eNodeB to 
allocate appropriate resources.

6.	 The target eNodeB checks the resource availability and if every-
thing is in order, it sends back an X2AP: Handover_Request_Ac-
knowledge message. This message includes a transparent container 
with a RRC: RRCConnectionReconfiguration message.
7.	 The source eNodeB unwraps the container and sends the RRC:
RRCConnectionReconfiguration message to the UE. This mes-
sage includes the new C-RNTI, the security algorithm to be used 
with the target eNodeB, system information, and other informa-
tion. This is the last message sent by the source eNodeB to the UE.
8.	 The source eNodeB sends an X2AP: SN_Status_Transfer message 
to the target eNodeB. It includes the PDCP sequence numbers and 
the hyper frame numbers (HFN) for the E-RABs. After sending 
this message, the source eNodeB starts to forward the downlink 
data packets that it has stored in its buffers (note that the downlink 
from the source eNodeB to the UE is no longer active).
9.	 After receiving the RRC: RRCConnectionReconfiguration mes-
sage, the UE starts a random access procedure toward the target 
eNodeB. If successful, the UE sends the RRC: RRCConnec-
tionReconfigurationComplete message to the target eNodeB. 
Now both the uplink and the downlink are active with the target 
eNodeB.
10.	 The target eNodeB sends a S1AP: Path_Switch_Request message 
to the MME to inform it that the UE has changed its serving cell 
and to request the switch of the downlink GTP tunnel toward a 
new GTP tunnel endpoint at the target eNB. The MME checks 
the target eNodeB identity and determines that the existing S-GW 
can serve also the new eNodeB.
11.	 The MME sends a GTP-C: Modify_Bearer_Request to the S-GW, 
to request that the S-GW modify its downlink data bearers (i.e., 
they should now be addressed to the new target eNodeB).
12.	 The S-GW starts sending downlink packets to the target eNo-
deB using the new address and sends the GTP-C: Modify_Bearer_
Response to the MME. The S-GW also sends one or more “end 
marker” packets on the old path toward the S-eNodeB before re-
leasing all user plane resources toward the source eNodeB.
13.	 The MME sends an S1AP: Path_Switch_Request_Acknowledge 
message back to the target eNodeB as a notification that the han-
dover was successful.
14.	 The target eNodeB sends a X2AP: UE_Context_Release message 
to the source eNodeB indicating that the handover process is com-
plete and that the source eNodeB can now release the resources 
that were allocated for the UE.

Procedures
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Note that there are many occasions where the handover procedure 
could have failed. For more information on LTE handovers, including vari-
ous failing cases, please consult [3, 5, 9].
9.7  CSG Inbound HO
The following example (Figure 9.10) presents a handover from a macro 
cell to a HeNB. It is shown here because it has some special features when 
compared to a standard macro-to-macro handover. These include issues 
such as the closed subscriber group (CSG) and physical cell identity (PCI) 
confusion.
Home eNodeBs are typically installed by private individuals, and the 
network operator may not know their exact location, at least not with the 
accuracy that is needed for efficient network planning, or does not even 
know if those devices are still there (e.g., the user may have switched his 
eNodeB off to save electricity at night). That is, when the network sends a 
Neighbour Cell List to a UE for measurements, it typically does not include 
HeNBs.
However, the network operator usually knows the approximate loca-
tion of HeNBs because of emergency call location requirements (possibly 
reported to the operator with the initial HeNB registration). Therefore, 
once a UE enters an area where there may be HeNBs that the user can ac-
cess, the network can send a proximity configuration to the UE, which is 
basically a request to start monitoring other frequencies too (i.e., frequen-
cies outside the Neighbour Cell List).
1.	 The procedure starts when the UE has entered an area where there 
may be HeNBs that the UE can access. These are HeNBs in open 
or hybrid access modes, or it can be a HeNB in the closed access 
mode and the UE has a subscription to this CSG. The eNodeB 
sends a RRC: RRC_Connection_Reconfiguration message to the 
UE, with the reportProximityConfig field enabled. Because this 
message is sent in the dedicated mode, it is UE specific. This is a 
useful feature: when a UE goes around in town, it is typically not 
configured to monitor and measure closed access mode HeNB cells 
because that would simply be waste of power. However, when the 
UE arrives at a macro cell(s) near the user’s home (and his HeNB), 
the network can send a proximity configuration only to this UE via 
the macro cell so that the UE can search for the HeNB and possibly 
make a handover to it. Other UEs in the area do not know about 
this HeNB because their proximity configuration is not active. 
The reception of proximity configuration triggers an autonomous 
search procedure (i.e., the UE starts monitoring frequencies other

than those in the Neighbour Cell List). The request also indicates 
which radio acccess technology (RAT) or technologies should be 
monitored.
2.	 The UE sends a RRC: Proximity_Indication message when it finds 
a cell that may be a CSG member cell. The expression is “may” be-
cause at this point the UE does not decode SI from the measured 
channels and cannot know for sure whether or not a cell is a CSG 
cell. It is not defined how the UE should perform the “autonomous 
search” for CSG cells (this is left for the UE manufacturer to de-
cide), but most probably it does not mean that the UE should scan 
all frequencies from all RATs because that would take a very long 
time (note that this procedure takes place in the connected mode 
and the UE may be busy communicating with the eNodeB at the 
same time). Instead, the UE may, for example, measure only those 
frequencies that it knows belong to CSGs where it is a subscriber. 
The proximity indication contains the RAT and the frequency of 
the possible CSG cell.
3.	 If the eNodeB concludes that one of the indicated cells might be 
a CSG cell suitable for this UE, it will send a new RRC: RRC_
Connection_Reconfiguration message to the UE, including a new 
measurement configuration that allows the UE to measure the can-
didate cell regularly, as part of its normal neighbor cell monitoring 
process.
4.	 If the candidate CSG cell is better than the current cell or some 
other event triggers the measurement reporting, the UE sends an 
RRC: Measurement_Report, which also contains physical cell 
identities (PCI) of the reported cells.
5.	 If the received measurement report indicates that a handover could 
be beneficial, the eNodeB configures the UE to perform SI ac-
quisition, again with a RRC: RRC_Connection_Reconfiguration 
message. As you may have already gathered, this message is a mul-
tipurpose message for the UE connected mode. Whatever needs to 
be done in the UE, the eNodeB sends this message. It is then the 
various parameters within the message that actually tell the UE 
what action should be taken.
6.	 The UE acquires the SI from the CSG cell and reports the most 
important parameters back to the eNodeB using an RRC: Mea-
surement_Report message. Note that it is only at this point that 
the UE finds out if this cell is really a CSG cell, since this piece of 
information is transmitted in SIB type 1.
7.	 After receiving the full measurement report from the UE, the eNo-
deB may decide to trigger a handover. If so, it sends a S1AP: Han-
dover_Required message to the MME, which includes the target 
E-CGI and the CSG ID, among other parameters. The cell access

mode for the target cell must also be included in case the access 
mode is hybrid.
8.	 The MME checks whether this UE is allowed to access the CSG 
cell in question (i.e., whether the UE is a subscriber of this CSG). If 
the access control was successful, the MME sends a S1AP: Hando-
ver_Request message to the target eNodeB (i.e., the HeNB in this 
case). If the target cell is a hybrid cell, the CSG membership status 
will be included in the message.
9.	 The target HeNB checks that the received CSG ID in the hando-
ver request matches the CSG ID of this cell. If so, then the HeNB 
allocates necessary resources for the UE, and sends back to the 
MME a S1AP: Handover_Request_Acknowledge message. This 
message includes a transparent container with a RRC: RRCCon-
nectionReconfiguration message in it.
10.	 The MME further sends a S1AP: Handover_Command message to 
the source eNodeB.
11.	 The source eNodeB unwraps the container and sends the RRC:
RRCConnectionReconfiguration message to the UE. This mes-
sage includes a new C-RNTI, the security algorithm to be used 
with the target eNodeB, system information, and other informa-
tion. This is the last message sent by the source eNodeB to the UE.
After this point, the signaling sequence is similar to the previous han-
dover example in Figure 9.9, continuing from point 8.
It is possible or even probable that there is a HeNB gateway between 
the MME and the HeNB, but it does not have any effect on the signaling 
procedure in this example.
Note that the handover from a CSG cell to a macro cell follows the 
normal handover rules; there is no special “CSG” handling in that case. CSG 
handovers are discussed in [3, 5, 9].
9.8  S1 Release Procedure
S1 Release involves the release of the S1-MME signaling connection, and 
the release of all UE data bearers from S1-U. Typically this procedure is 
initiated by the UE switch-off, although there are also several other causes 
that may lead to S1 release, including various errors or failures in eNodeB 
or MME (see Figure 9.11).
1.	 The procedure starts with the eNodeB requesting the UE 
to release the existing signaling connection with a RRC: 
RRC_Connection_Release.

190 
 
Procedures
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
2.	 The eNodeB sends a S1AP: UE_Context_Release_Request with a 
cause parameter, which indicates the reason for the release.
3.	 The MME sends the release request further to the S-GW in GTP-
C: Release_Access_Bearers_Request. Note that if the S1 release 
procedure is triggered by the MME, then this is the first message in 
the procedure.
4.	 Upon receiving this message, S-GW releases all eNodeB-related 
information (address and TEIDs) for the UE and responds with a 
Release_Access_Bearers_Response message to the MME.
5.	 MME sends a S1AP: UE_Context_Release_Command (cause) to 
the eNodeB.
6.	 If this procedure was launched by the MME in stage 3, then the 
RRC connection is released here with a RRC: RRC_Connec-
tion _Release message.
7.	 The eNodeB responds to the MME with a S1AP: UE_Con-
text_Release_Complete. Upon receiving this message, the MME 
releases the signaling connection to the eNodeB and deletes all 
eNodeB-related information from its stored UE context.
See [3, 5, 7–9] for further information.

Dedicated Bearer Activation 
 
191
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
9.9  Dedicated Bearer Activation
When the UE attaches to the network, it will be assigned a default EPS 
bearer. This bearer exists as long as the connection remains active. The UE 
may also be allocated additional bearers, so called dedicated bearers. Each 
bearer comes with associated QoS parameters, and the various entities in the 
network must allocate resources for each new bearer so that they can fulfill 
the QoS requirements for data that is transported via those bearers. One UE 
can thus have several dedicated bearers allocated, one for each different data 
connection.
A dedicated bearer allocation is initiated by the policy and charging 
rules function (PCRF), although the request for this can come from the 
UE. In such a case, the signaling flow diagram in Figure 9.12 would be pre-
ceded by a NAS: Bearer_Resource_Modification_Request message from 
the UE to the MME, and thereafter as Bearer_Resource_Command from 
the MME to the S-GW and further to P-GW
1.	 The procedure starts when the PCRF sends a PCC decision provi-
sion message to the P-GW. This message indicates the QoS that is 
required for the new bearer.
2.	 The P-GW transforms the QoS policy requirements into bearer-
level QoS parameters and allocates an EPS bearer. The P-GW fur-
ther sends a GTP-C: Create Bearer Request message to the S-GW.
3.	 The S-GW in turn allocates the resources for the new bearer and 
forwards the message to the MME.
4.	 The MME builds a NAS message (activate dedicated EPS bearer 
context request) to be sent to the UE, and encapsulates it into S1AP: 
E-RAB Setup Request message, which is sent to the eNodeB.
5.	 The eNodeB maps the EPS bearer QoS to the radio bearer QoS. 
It sends the NAS: Activate Dedicated EPS bearer context request 
further to the UE, encapsulated into a RRC: RRC_Connection_
Reconfiguration message.
6.	 The UE first acknowledges the new radio bearer activation with a 
RRC: RRC_Connection_Reconfiguration message. 
7.	 The eNodeB further acknowledges the successful radio bearer ac-
tivation to the MME with a S1AP: E-RAB_Setup_Response.
8.	 The UE NAS layer sends a NAS: Activate Dedicated EPS bearer 
context accept message to the eNodeB within an UL_Informa-
tion_Transfer message.
9.	 This message is further relayed to the MME within S1AP: Up-
link_NAS_Transport message.
10–11.	 Thereafter, the successful bearer creation is acknowledged to S-GW 
and P-GW with a GTP-C: Create_Bearer_Response message.

Specifications
10.1  Introduction
This chapter section discusses how 3GPP standards are developed; the 
structure of 3GPP as an organization; its various working groups, working 
practices, releases; and more. The purpose of this chapter is to familiarize 
the reader with 3GPP and especially its specifications. The specifications 
are the ultimate source of LTE-A information; all technical information 
about the system is there. The only question is whether it can be found and 
understood. 
3GPP was a rather unique arrangement when it was set up in 1998. It 
is a collaboration project between regional telecommunications standards 
organizations. Currently 3GPP has six organizational partners: ARIB, ATIS, 
CCSA, ETSI, TTA, and TTC. Individual companies can join 3GPP via their 
organizational partner association (i.e., a company cannot join “only” 3GPP 
without first joining one of the organizational partners). As of October 
2013, there are 401 individual 3GPP members. This group includes equip-
ment vendors, network operators, governmental organizations, regulators, 
academic establishments, research laboratories, and so on (see Table 10.1).
Also, at this point it is good to remind the reader what the 3GPP speci-
fications actually specify. Typically they specify the functionality of interfaces. 
For example, there is no 3GPP specification that specifies how the eNodeB 
should be implemented. Instead, several specifications specify how the in-
terfaces around the eNodeB work, as well as what information and in what 
format should be transported over those interfaces. The 3GPP specifications 
do not want to stipulate or restrict the implementation of eNodeBs (or any 
other 3GPP network entities for that matter). But if the interfaces are prop-
erly specified, it will be possible to use hardware from different vendors on 
both sides of an interface.

On top of the structure is the Project Coordination Group (PCG). 
The PCG is the highest decision making body in 3GPP. It meets formally 
every six months to carry out the final adoption of 3GPP Technical Speci-
fication Group work items, to ratify election results, and determine the 
resources committed to 3GPP. PCG delegates include the leadership from

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
3GPP technical specification groups (TSG), delegations from 3GPP or-
ganizational partners, and also representatives from market representation 
partners (MRP).
The actual technical work is done in TSGs. Currently there are four of 
them:
•• Radio access networks (RAN);
•• Service and systems aspects (SA);
•• Core network and terminals (CT);
•• GSM EDGE radio access networks (GERAN).
Furthermore, the work in TSG is organized into working groups (WG). 
Each TSG can have several WGs reporting to it. Each WG is responsible for 
certain aspects of the TSG work. WGs meet four to six times a year, usually 
in five-day-long meetings. Occasionally some difficult issues may result in 
additional ad hoc meetings. WG meetings are very technical in nature. WGs 
can and do propose changes to specifications via a formal process called 
change requests. However, CRs agreed in WGs still have to be submitted to 
the next TSG meeting for the final approval.
TSGs currently meet four times a year. In TSG meetings, the results 
from the work of WGs is presented for information, discussion, and ap-
proval. Only after a TSG has approved a CR can it be incorporated in speci-
fications. In following sections, we will discuss each of the TSGs in turn, as 
well as introduce their WGs.
10.2.1  TSG RAN
The TSG RAN is responsible for the UTRAN and evolved UTRAN, in-
cluding their internal structures and functions, of systems for evolved 3G 
and beyond. Specifically, it has a responsibility for the followinbg:
•• Specification of layer 1 of Uu radio interface for UE, Node B, and 
eNode B, as well as layer 1 of Un radio interface for relay node and 
eNode B;
•• Specification of layer 2 of Uu radio interface for UE, Node B, and 
eNode B, as well as layer 2 of Un radio interface for relay node and 
eNode B;
•• Specification of layer 3 of Uu radio interface for UE, Node B, and 
eNode B, as well as layer 3 of Un radio interface for relay node and 
eNode B;

198 
 
Specifications
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
•• Overall UTRAN and E-UTRAN architecture, including the specifi-
cation of interfaces between UTRAN/E-UTRAN and the core net-
work, and of network interfaces within UTRAN/E-UTRAN;
•• Specification of LTE positioning protocol (LPP) between the UE and 
the positioning server for LTE, and LTE positioning protocol A (LPPa) 
between the eNode B and the positioning server;
•• UTRAN and evolved UTRAN O&M requirements;
•• Transport of implementation-specific O&M between the management 
system and node B;
•• Conformance test specifications for evolved UE;
•• Conformance test specifications for base stations and evolved base 
stations;
•• Specifications for radio performance and RF system aspects.
TSG RAN has five WGs. These are large working groups; some of 
them have 200–300 delegates attending every meeting. RAN WG1 (radio 
layer 1) is responsible for the specification of the physical layer of the radio 
interface for UE, UTRAN, evolved UTRAN, and beyond, covering both 
FDD and TDD modes of the radio interface. RAN1 is usually the largest 
3GPP WG in terms of delegate numbers.
RAN WG2 (radio layer 2 and radio layer 3 RR) is in charge of the 
radio interface architecture and protocols (MAC, RLC, PDCP), the specifi-
cation of the radio resource control protocol, the strategies of radio resource 
management, and the services provided by the physical layer to the upper 
layers. Within the scope of TSG RAN, RAN WG2 is responsible for the 
development of specifications dealing with UTRA, evolved UTRA, and 
beyond.
RAN WG3 is responsible for the overall UTRAN/E-UTRAN archi-
tecture and the specification of protocols for the Iu, Iur, Iub, S1, and X2 
interfaces.
RAN WG4 works on the RF aspects of UTRAN/E-UTRAN. RAN 
WG4 performs simulations of diverse RF system scenarios and derives the 
minimum requirements for transmission and reception parameters and for 
channel demodulation. Once these requirements are set, the group defines 
the test procedures that will be used to verify them (only for BS). Require-
ments for other radio elements, like repeaters, are specified in the RAN 
WG4 as well.
RAN WG5 works on the specification of conformance testing at the 
radio interface (Uu) for the user equipment (UE). The test specifications 
are based on the requirements defined by other groups such as RAN WG4 
for the radio test cases, and RAN WG2 and CT WG1 for the signaling and

protocols test cases. RAN WG5 is organized in two subgroups, the RF sub-
group and the signaling subgroup.
10.2.2  TSG SA
The TSG service and system aspects (TSG-SA) group is responsible for the 
overall architecture and service capabilities of systems based on 3GPP speci-
fications and, as such, has a responsibility for cross TSG coordination. That is, 
even though all TSGs are equal, TSG-SA is more equal than the others. This 
position is also reflected on the fact that TSG-SA has its plenary meeting 
after other TSG meetings, and other TSGs will present their meeting reports 
to TSG SA.
TSG SA has also five WGs. These groups have quite diverse tasks. SA 
WG1 handles services. This group is typically the first one to have a look at 
new features and services that might be added to the system. The outputs 
of this working group are technical specifications and reports, or changes 
to these, which are all submitted to TSG SA for approval. Once approved, 
they form the basis for the work for the whole of 3GPP and for indus-
try segments interested in deploying networks based on IMS. That is, in a 
way TSG SA1 works as a filter. It examines which features or services are 
worth adding to the standards and then produces requirement specifications 
(known as stage 1 specifications) that will be used by other 3GPP groups as 
guidance in their work. This also means that while other 3GPP groups are 
preparing specifications for release X, TSG SA1 may already be discussing 
release X+1 features.
SA WG2 handles the system architecture. It is in charge of developing 
the stage 2 specifications for the 3GPP network. Based on the service re-
quirements elaborated by SA WG1, SA WG2 identifies the main functions 
and entities of the network, how these entities are linked to each other, and 
the information they exchange. The output of SA WG2 is used as input by 
other groups in charge of the definition of the precise format of messages 
in stage 3 specifications (stage 2 for the radio access network is under TSG 
RAN’s responsibility). The group has a systemwide view and decides how 
new functions integrate with the existing network entities. Therefore, SA 
WG2 is probably the most important WG in the whole 3GPP.
SA WG3 is responsible for security and privacy in 3GPP systems, de-
termining the security and privacy requirements, and specifying the secu-
rity architectures and protocols. This WG also ensures the availability of 
cryptographic algorithms, which need to be part of the specifications. The 
sub-WG SA3-LI provides the requirements and specifications for lawful 
interception in 3GPP systems.
SA WG4 handles various codecs in the system. It deals with the speci-
fications for speech, audio, video, and multimedia codecs, in both circuit-
switched and packet-switched environments. Other topics within the 

200

mandate of SA WG4 are quality evaluation, end-to-end performance, and 
interoperability aspects with existing mobile and fixed networks from codec 
point of view.
SA WG5 specifies the requirements, architecture, and solutions for pro-
visioning and management of the network (RAN, CN, IMS) and its ser-
vices. The WG will define charging solutions in alignment with the related 
charging requirements developed by relevant WGs and will specify the ar-
chitecture and protocols for charging of the network and its services.
The WG will ensure its work is also applicable to the management 
and charging of converged networks and potentially applicable to fixed 
networks. 
10.2.3  TSG CT
TSG CT was formed in 2005 as a merger of two older TSGs, the core 
network (CN) and terminal (T). TSG CT is responsible for specifying the 
CN and T equipment aspects of systems based on 3GPP specifications. This 
includes the following:
•• User equipment–core network layer 3 protocols in CS and PS domain 
excluding the radio access technology layers;
•• Core network internal interfaces for call-associated and noncall-associ-
ated signaling;
•• Interconnection of the core network with external networks;
•• SIM/USIM/ISIM/HPSIM and its interface specifications;
•• Terminal- or network-based applications supported by 3GPP terminals;
•• Core network protocols for CS and PS domain;
•• IP multimedia subsystem.
After the merger, it had six WGs, though two of them have been since 
closed.
CT WG1 is responsible for specifications that define the user equip-
ment–core network l3 radio protocols and core network side of the Iu 
reference point. Specifically, it has a responsibility for user equipment–core 
network layer 3 radio protocols (call control, session management, mobility 
management, SMS).
CT WG2 does not exist. The old T WG2 was responsible for terminal 
capabilities, but that group was closed in 2005.
CT WG3 specifies the bearer capabilities for circuit and packet switched 
data services, as well as the necessary interworking functions toward both the 
user equipment in the UMTS/LTE PLMN and the terminal equipment in 

	
10.2 
Internal Structure

the external network. In addition CT3 is responsible for end-to-end QoS 
in the UMTS core network.
CT WG4 standardizes stage 2 and stage 3 aspects within the core net-
work focusing on supplementary services, basic call processing, mobility 
management within the core network, bearer-independent architecture, 
GPRS between network entities, transcoder free operation, CAMEL, ge-
neric user profile, wireless LAN–UMTS interworking, and descriptions of 
IP multimedia subsystem. CT WG4 is also responsible as a “protocol stew-
ard” for the some IP-related protocols (this involves analyzing, validating, 
extending if necessary, clarifying usage, specifying packages, and parameter 
values).
CT WG5 used to develop application programming interfaces (APIs) 
for the open service access (OSA). However, this task was transferred to the 
Open Mobile Alliance (OMA) in 2008 and the WG was closed.
CT WG6 is responsible for the development and maintenance of speci-
fications and associated test specifications for 3GPP smart card applications 
and the interface with the mobile terminal. These include the following:
•• Subscriber identity module (SIM), which is used by 2G systems;
•• Universal subscriber identity module (USIM), which is used by 3GPP 
systems;
•• IM services identity module (ISIM), with the exception of the security 
algorithms (those are developed by SA WG3).
10.2.4  TSG GERAN
TSG GERAN is responsible for the specification of the radio access part of 
GSM/EDGE. Since 1992, GSM specifications had been developed by ETSI, 
but in 2000 this work was transferred to a new GERAN group within the 
3GPP. Since GERAN still retains some old working practices, its meeting 
schedule and working practices are different from other TSGs. For example, 
GERAN TSG and WG meetings take place during the same week at the 
same location; typically Monday and Friday are reserved for the TSG ple-
nary and Tuesday through Thursday for working group meetings. GSM/
EDGE has a long and distinguished history, but now it seems that operators 
are no longer interested in investing in new GERAN development work 
and are moving their focus to 3G/4G. Subsequently, the amount of work in 
TSG GERAN has diminished, and it is possible that this TSG will disappear 
in not so distant future.
•• Currently TSG GERAN has three WGs. GERAN WG1 is responsible 
for the following:

202 
 
Specifications
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
•• RF aspects of GERAN;
•• Internal GERAN interface specifications such as A-ter (CCU-TRAU);
•• Conformance test specifications for testing of all aspects of GERAN 
base stations;
•• GERAN-specific O&M specifications for the nodes in the GERAN;
GERAN WG2 is responsible for the protocol aspects of GERAN. GE-
RAN2 specifies the data link and RLC/MAC layer protocols and the in-
terfaces between these layers and the physical layer.
GERAN WG3 is responsible for conformance test specifications for 
testing of all aspects of GERAN terminals. It also deals with GERAN radio 
aspects and interfaces.
10.2.5  Mobile Competence Center (MCC)
In addition to TSGs and WGs, 3GPP also includes the mobile competence 
center (MCC). MCC provides support to the Third Generation Partner-
ship Project (3GPP). It is about 20 people strong and is located at the ETSI 
headquarters in Sophia Antipolis in southern France. Each TSG/WG has a 
dedicated MCC support officer who gives support at 3GPP meetings, takes 
minutes, implements agrees actions, updates specifications, and so on.
10.3  Standardization Process
10.3.1  Introduction
Even if the reader is not planning to participate in 3GPP standardization, 
it is good to know how the standardization is done. The process is not 
obvious for an outsider, and the jargon used may not be self-explanatory. 
Understanding the process will help to find the right information from the 
specifications.
In the previous section the various TSGs and WGs were discussed. The 
standardization work is done in these groups, either in face-to-face meet-
ings, via email lists, or in electronic/telephone meetings. 3GPP standardiza-
tion work is contributions-driven. It is up to individual member companies 
to propose new work items or changes to specifications.
10.3.2  Work Items
In principle, all work done in 3GPP should belong to some work item. A 
work item is a piece of work introducing a new feature, modifying an ex-
isting feature, or perhaps studying some proposed new feature. It must be 

	
10.3 
Standardization Process 
 
203
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
initiated and supported by a group of companies (at least four companies 
by current rules). Work item proposals must be approved by the relevant 
TSG before any related work can commence. If a work item proposal is 
approved, it will become part of the work plan and may get meeting time 
from relevant WGs.
In its specification work, 3GPP uses a three-stage methodology as de-
fined in ITU-T recommendation I.130 [1]. That is, there are three types 
of specifications, and, at least in principle, a new feature to be standardized 
should be defined in all of these:
•• Stage 1: these specifications contain the service requirements from the 
user point of view.
•• Stage 2: these specifications define the architecture to support the ser-
vice requirements.
•• Stage 3: these specifications define an implementation of the architec-
ture by specifying protocols in details.
However, in practice a new feature, especially if it is a minor enhance-
ment, may only include stage 2 and/or stage 3 specification changes.
If the work item is a so called study item, making a feasibility study on 
whether a new feature is needed, then its outcome is recorded in a technical 
report, which could be regarded as a stage 0 specification. Technical reports 
are not specifications as such; they merely contain a description of a feature 
and say whether it is feasible to include it in normative 3GPP specifications. 
If the conclusion is yes, then a related work item can be proposed. Despite 
this, note that technical reports are often very useful sources of informa-
tion for a reader who wants to learn about a new 3GPP feature. The actual 
technical specifications are compact standards that do not explain issues. 
However, the corresponding technical report, if such exists, may help to 
understand the topic in hand. But it is also good to remember that technical 
reports describe only the study phase. There is no guarantee that the actual 
technical specification will follow the conclusions and recommendations of 
the technical report. In any case, technical reports are typically not main-
tained after the study phase has concluded, and thus they should never be 
used as an aid for the implementation of the feature.
Each work item has a rapporteur. This person is typically from the com-
pany that initiated the WI proposal and is an expert in the subject. When 
the specification is still in a draft phase, the rapporteur collects the agreed 
text proposals toward the draft specification at each meeting and updates 
the draft specification accordingly. Once the specification is considered to 
be 80 percent ready, it will be put under change control and its maintenance 
becomes the responsibility of the MCC. Thereafter, the treatment of the 
specification becomes more formal. 

204 
 
Specifications
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Changes to a specification under change control can only be intro-
duced via formal change requests (CRs), see Figure 10.2. A CR must be 
first agreed by the WG, and then approved by the corresponding TSG. Only 
after that will MCC incorporate the change into the specification. A CR 
can introduce a new feature, modify an existing feature, or fix an error 
that was found from existing definitions. Also, editorial corrections are in-
troduced via CRs. Each CR can modify only a single version of a single 
specification. For example, if the modification of a feature affects several 
specifications, then each of those specifications needs its own CR. A CR 
must clearly show what should be changed in the specification and provide 
reasons for the change. All approved CRs will be recorded in the central 
CR database, and they are also listed in the end of the relevant specification.
10.3.3  Version Numbering
Specifications are updated after every TSG plenary meeting by the MCC, 
provided that the TSG approved any CRs for the specification in question. 
Since currently there are four meetings per year for each TSG, it follows that

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
the specifications will be updated a maximum of four times a year. Once a 
specification is updated, it will be given a new version number. The version 
number follows an x.y.z notation, where:
•• x gives the release number. Release numbers 0, 1, and 2 indicate that 
the specification is a draft that is not yet approved by a TSG. Once the 
specification is approved (i.e., it is estimated to be 80 percent ready), 
the specification is given version number x.0.0. For example if this is a 
Release-11 specification, then the new version number will be 11.0.0.
•• y gives the technical version number. For the first version of a release, y 
is always 0. The version number is incremented by one each time a tech-
nical change (or changes) is introduced to the specification. Each TSG 
meeting that approves one or more CRs will make such an increment. 
The new version will contain all approved CRs from a TSG meeting.
•• z gives the editorial version number. An editorial change is one that does 
not affect the technical content of the specification. These can include 
correction of typos or a clarification of the meaning of the specification. 
The z field is reset back to zero every time the y field is changed.
10.3.4  Releases
A release forms a self-contained set of specifications that can be used to con-
struct a functional 3GPP system. Specifications for release X can be created 
by taking the corresponding Release (X-1) version as a starting point and 
then adding all approved release X CRs to it. Once a release is considered 
mature enough, it will be frozen. Frozen in this context means functional 
freeze: no new functionality will be added to a frozen release, but errors 
found can be corrected. The term frozen release has caused misunderstand-
ings in the past, and it must be stressed that a frozen release does not mean 
that the specifications in that release remain unchanged. A company can 
propose CRs to a frozen release as long as the release remains open. Once a 
release is declared closed, it is no longer maintained by the MCC. Currently, 
closed releases include all releases up until and including Release 99.
However, even though CRs can be proposed against old but open re-
leases, the chances of getting a CR approved becomes progressively more 
difficult with time (i.e., the member companies are very reluctant to re-
open very old releases). It has to be a very serious error found from, for ex-
ample, a specification that was frozen five years ago before a CR correcting 
the error can get an approval in the TSG. The reason member companies 
often do not approve such changes is quite practical: if a change were to be 
introduced in old specifications, it might result, at least in theory, in product 
recalls to fix the problem in products that are already out there, and with 

206 
 
Specifications
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
mass-market devices such as mobile phones this would be a completely 
impossible situation.
It can also be argued that a CR fixing an old error is unnecessary on the 
grounds that the system with the error in it has been in use for a long time 
already, and therefore the problem cannot be serious and the specifications 
can be left untouched.
The freezing date for a release under work is set well in advance. How-
ever, it is not unheard of that the freezing date is postponed if the work takes 
more time than expected and important issues remain open in the release.
Earlier 3GPP releases up until Release 7 were briefly discussed earlier 
in this book in the history chapter. From Release 8 onward the releases 
contain an LTE component, and from Release 10 onward they also contain 
LTE-advanced items. We will discuss the main enhancements introduced in 
these releases in this section. Note that the freeze dates given are freeze dates 
for stage 3 specifications. Stage 1 and stage 2 specifications may have their 
own freezing dates, which are typically much earlier than stage 3 freezing 
dates. See Figure 10.3 for the LET release schedule.
10.3.4.1  Release 8
Release 8 introduced LTE—including the new air interface and the new 
type of core network. These were major changes. It was decided that the 
new air interface definitions cannot fit into existing specifications, and thus 
a new set of standards, the 36-series, was established. Currently, this series has 
more than 150 technical specifications and technical reports. Since Release 
8 employs a new air interface technology, OFDMA, it cannot be backwards 
compatible with Release 7. OFDMA technology is discussed in detail in 
Chapter 4. Other LTE-specific Release 8 features include:
•• Flat RAN architecture, RAN having only a single type node (eNodeB);
•• A new core network, enhanced packet core (EPC);
•• Low latency (transit time < 10ms);
•• MIMO support (max 4x4 downlink, 2x2 uplink);
•• QPSK/16QAM/64 QAM modulation;

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
•• Multicast/broadcast over a single frequency network (MBSFN);
•• Data rates up to 300-Mbps downlink, 75-Mbps uplink.
Note that LTE air interface is also known as evolved UMTS terrestrial 
radio access (E-UTRA). Release 8 was frozen in December 2008.
10.3.4.2  Release 9
Release 9, by nature, is a smaller “enhancement” release in between Re-
lease 8, which introduced LTE, and Release 10, which introduced LTE-
advanced. However, Release 9 still contains many important new features. 
These include:
•• Home eNodeBs (i.e., femtocells);
•• Evolved multimedia broadcast and multicast service (eMBMS);
•• The self-organizing network (SON);
•• Location services (LCS) to detect the location of a mobile device 
accurately;
•• Multistandard radio (MSR).
Home eNodeBs are further discussed in Section 7.3, eMBMS in Sec-
tion 11.6, and SON in Section 11.7. Release 9 was frozen in December 
2009.
10.3.4.3  Release 10
Release 10 introduced LTE-advanced, which is again a major release with 
greatly enhanced capabilities. LTE-A increases the capacity and throughput 
of the LTE system. UEs near cell edges will also see improved performance 
as a result of Release 10. The main features include:
•• Data rates up to 3-Gbps downlink and 1.5-Gbps uplink;
•• Carrier aggregation (CA), allowing the combination of up to five sepa-
rate carriers together, in theory providing bandwidths up to 100 MHz. 
However, in Releases 10 and 11, the maximum number of component 
carriers is two;
•• Higher order MIMO: 8×8 downlink and 4×4 uplink;
•• Relay nodes;
•• Enhanced intercell interference coordination (eICIC) to improve per-
formance at cell edges;

208 
 
Specifications
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
•• SON enhancements;
•• Minimization of drive tests feature;
•• HeNB mobility enhancements;
•• Machine type communications (MTC).
Release 10 was frozen in March 2011.
10.3.4.4  Release 11
Release 11 was again an enhancements release after bigger changes intro-
duced in Release 10. The list of refinements include:
•• Enhancements to carrier aggregation;
•• New frequency bands;
•• Coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission and reception (simulta-
neous communication with multiple cells);
•• Network-based positioning support (NBPS);
•• Network energy saving;
•• Further enhanced intercell interference coordination (FeICIC).
Release 11 was frozen in March 2013. Note that the official freeze date 
was September 2012, but protocols (especially RAN protocols) were not 
stable until six months later.
10.3.4.5  Release 12
Potential features for Release 12 were discussed at a 3GPP workshop in Slo-
venia in June 2012. A strong requirement was the need to support the rapid 
increase in mobile data usage, but other items included the efficient support 
of diverse applications while ensuring a high-quality user experience.
At the time of this writing, Release 12 work is still at early phases, and 
the list of features in it may still change. Currently Release 12 seems to 
introduce at least:
•• Enhanced LIPA and SIPTO;
•• MTC enhancements;
•• Proximity-based services;
•• Enhancements to HeNB mobility;

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
•• Support for BeiDou satellite navigation;
•• Improved mobility for heterogenous networks (HetNet) (i.e., networks 
with macro, pico, and femto cells);
•• 8x8 MIMO for uplink.
Release 12 (stage 3) is expected to be frozen in September 2014.
10.3.5  Development Cycle
The development cycle for specifications is shown in Figure 10.4. Once a 
release is frozen, no new functionality will be added to it, but corrections 
will be accepted. The focus of the specification work will move to the next 
release. As soon as there are approved CRs for the new release X, a copy of 
the latest release X-1 specification is named the release X specification, and 
the changes from the CR will be added to it.
CRs will be handled and agreed in WG meetings and then given the 
final approval in TSG meetings. In special cases it is also possible for the 
companies to submit their CRs directly to a TSG meeting. After a TSG 
meeting, all approved CRs are bundled together per specification, and then 
the specification is updated. Note that a correction may affect several re-
leases of the same specification. However, in this case each release requires a 
CR of its own. Between each TSG meeting there can be one or more WG 
meetings. Since there are four TSG meetings in a year, the specifications are 
updated at most four times a year. If there are no approved CRs for a given 
specification, then it will remain untouched.
Once the release X is frozen, release X specifications must form a self-
contained set of standards. If there have been no release-X CRs against a 
certain specification, and this specification is needed in release X, at this

10.4  Specification Numbering
3GPP specifications are divided into several series. The series numbering 
goes from 0 to 55, although not all numbers in this range are used. Table 10.2 
shows the different series and a short description of their contents.
In the context of this book, we are mostly interested in 36 series, which 
contains the radio specifications for LTE and LTE-A. However, it is good to 
know that 36 series is not the only place that contains LTE/LTE-A defini-
tions. The 36 series is about radio access technology only. Many other issues, 
such as security, charging, and codecs, are in their own series, and often the 
same specification contains definitions for GERAN, UTRAN, and EU-
TRAN systems. Moreover, EPS definitions for the evolved core network

Backwards Compatibility

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
are added to 22, 23, and 24 series, often embedded to existing specifications. 
However, this section discusses the 36 series only.
Since LTE and LTE-A define the new radio access network, EUTRAN, 
the 36 series specifications are drafted and maintained by TSG RAN and its 
WGs. This series currently contains about 150 specifications, and the num-
ber is increasing. Not all of these documents are nominative specifications; 
there are also so called technical reports (TR) in the 36 series. 
There are two types of technical reports:
•• Those intended to be transposed and issued by the organizational part-
ners as their own publications. These type of TRs are given numbers of 
the form xx.9xx.
•• Those that are 3GPP internal working documents and not intended for 
external publication. These may include, for example, results of feasibil-
ity studies. They are numbered as xx.8xx.
The rest of the series is technical specifications (TS). They are subdi-
vided by the working group responsible as follows:
•• 36.1xx: RAN4 specifications (i.e., radio performance related 
specifications);
•• 36.2xx: RAN1 specifications (i.e., air interface physical layer 
specifications);
•• 36.3xx: RAN2 specifications (i.e., air interface protocol specifications);
•• 36.4xx: RAN3 specifications (i.e., radio access network protocol 
specifications);
•• 36.5xx: RAN5 specifications (i.e., radio test specifications).
10.5  Backwards Compatibility
Backwards compatibility is an important basic principle that is maintained 
whenever possible while introducing changes to specifications. It means 
that changes should be introduced in a way that allows hardware or software 
to conform to an older version of the specification and to continue func-
tioning without problems in a network that has devices conforming to the 
new version of the specification. For example, a Release 8 UE should work 
without problems with a Release 10 eNodeB. Of course, a new feature or 
a modification of functionality introduced by this new change will not be 
available for the older equipment, but the change should be done in a way 

212 
 
Specifications
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
that enables the older equipment to ignore the newer functionality without 
problems.
Backwards compatibility has important practical reasons behind it. If a 
customer buys a new LTE mobile phone, it should continue working in any 
LTE network, regardless of the particular release the network is conform-
ing to. Also, a network operator probably wants to upgrade its network in 
phases. It is not practical for an operator to upgrade all devices in a network 
simultaneously, which would be the case without backwards compatibility. 
If the releases are backwards compatible, then devices confirming to differ-
ent releases can coexist in the same network.
The backwards compatibility issue does have implications for speci-
fications under work. A backwards compatible solution may not be the 
most elegant one or the most obvious one. But the principle of backwards 
compatibility is more important than specification’s style points. Note that 
sometimes backwards compatibility can be broken on purpose. For exam-
ple, if a serious error that has broken the backwards compatibility in the 
first place is found, then it is allowed to fix this error with a non–backwards 
compatible change. The reasoning here is that the original feature would 
not have worked anyway, so there is no point in trying to make its correc-
tion backwards compatible with something that does not work. However, if 
there is an even older version of the same piece of specification (i.e., older 
than the version that introduced the error), then it probably a good idea to 
make the new corrected specification backwards compatible with the old 
specification.
Backwards compatibility has to be kept in mind even when introducing 
new features that do not exist in older versions. They have to be introduced 
in a form that makes it easy to modify them later—especially in a way that 
is backwards compatible with the original feature.
10.6  E-UTRAN Specifications
This section briefly discusses the most common LTE interfaces and speci-
fications in them. Figure 10.5 presents Uu, S1, and X2 interfaces and the 
corresponding specifications.
Note that both S1 and X2 interfaces are wired interfaces, and thus 
the lower layer specifications for those interfaces are not defined by 3GPP. 
Rather, the specifications listed in Figure 10.5 contain references to other 
standards that can be used in layer 1 and layer 2 of S1 and X2 interfaces.
Figure 10.6 shows the Xn interface between the relay node and the do-
nor eNodeB. Most of the protocols in these stacks are already familiar from 
earlier figures, but the physical layer is special in that it is a modified ver-
sion of Uu, known as Un. The Un interface conforms to all normal physi-

Chapter 11
LTE-A Features
This chapter introduces a few selected features that have been adopted in 
LTE-A or are in the process of being adopted by LTE-A. Some of these 
features are not completely new in LTE-A (e.g., MIMO has been earlier 
specified for UMTS and LTE, too). However, these features have been given 
new capabilities in LTE-A, resulting in improved performance.
Also, this chapter includes some features that are completely new for 
3GPP systems, such as coordinated multipoint (CoMP) transmission/recep-
tion and energy saving.
11.1  Energy Saving
This section discusses energy saving within the network infrastructure. Mo-
bile devices are designed to be as energy saving as possible. They are typically 
wireless devices, running on batteries, and thus low power consumption is 
a very important design parameter. Long standby times are also exploited in 
marketing. Low UE power consumption is achieved by adding power saving 
features into system specifications and by clever hardware design.
On the network side the equipment is connected to mains power, and 
thus there is no similar operational requirement to save power as with mo-
bile devices. However, electricity is getting increasingly expensive, and big 
mobile operators have a very large number of base stations in their net-
works. In addition, traffic patterns in mobile networks are very variable; 
peak demand takes place at different times in different locations. For exam-
ple a shopping mall may have a high-capacity demand during prime shop-
ping hours but close to zero demand at night time. Office blocks have high 
capacity demand during office hours, but low demand during weekends. 
Operators have to plan their networks so that they can meet the peak-time 
demand. However, this will leave them with unused capacity at other times.
As a consequence, mobile operators may want to switch off some of 
their base stations when they are not needed. Note that switching off a 
base station should not result in a coverage hole where mobile devices 
cannot get any service. Mobile networks, especially in capacity hotspots, 
have typically layered cell structure. The same area may be covered by both 
macro cells and capacity-boosting micro/pico/femto cells. If smaller cells 
are switched off, the macro cell(s) can still provide service for the remaining 
UEs (see Figure 11.1).

LTE-A Features
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Mobile operators can, of course, switch their cells on and off already via 
their O&M systems. However, what has been missing so far are clearly de-
fined mechanisms on how the operator can detect low capacity demand in 
a base station, how to switch it off, and most importantly when and how to 
switch it back on. This is not quite as simple as one would think. The princi-
pal problem is that mobile networks were not designed to have base stations 
that are continuously switched on and off. In addition, LTE does not have 
centralized control nodes in the radio access network, such as the RNC in 
UTRAN. The decision-making algorithm has to be distributed among all 
eNodeBs. They have to decide among themselves which eNodeB can be 
switched off and when, and what triggers will switch it back on. There are 
several problems to solve. For example:
1.	 Is it acceptable to switch off LTE cells, if the coverage is then pro-
vided by UMTS cells (or even EDGE cells)? This may result in 
some LTE-specific services becoming unavailable or to being pro-
vided with a lower quality of service. Note that there could also be 
LTE-only capable mobiles in the area, in which case those mobiles 
would be out of service.
2.	 Is a base station allowed to make the switch-off decision autono-
mously, or should this always be a centralized decision? (Note: base 
station switch-off is known as entering the dormant mode in 3GPP 
jargon.)
3.	 How/when should the base station make the switch-on decision? 
When the coverage base station detects increasing load, it has to 
switch on some capacity cells. However, capacity-boosting cells are 
typically much smaller than coverage-providing cells. How does 
the coverage cell know which capacity-boosting cells should be 
switched on to ease its loading? If it switches on the wrong cells 
with only a few or no UEs in their coverage area, the overload

situation in the coverage cell may continue. There are various 
methods to solve this problem, but it is not clear which ones would 
provide the best results. These methods include:
•	 OAM predefined policies;
•	 IoT measurements;
•	 UE measurements;
•	 Positioning information.
The first method is to let the O&M decide, based on operator-specific 
proprietary algorithms. This algorithm may simply involve two (or more) 
predefined sets of coverage configurations, store them in the O&M, and 
then reconfigure the network at set times using these configurations. For 
example, use configuration 1 at daytime and configuration 2 at night. The 
trigger to change the configuration may also be a certain loading pattern. 
Figure 11.2 gives an example of predefined configurations. In configuration 
1, all capacity-boosting cells are switched off. This configuration is used at 
night. At 8:00 in the morning the cell(s) in the office district are switched 
on because extra capacity is needed when offices are opened. And in the af-
ternoon around 3:00 the number of customers around the shopping district

starts to increase and therefore the capacity cells are switched on also in this 
area. When the evening comes, both shops and offices will be closed, and 
thus all capacity cells can enter dormant mode at 9 pm.
Interference over thermal (IoT) measurements mean the coverage cell 
can ask a dormant cell or a set of dormant cells to switch on their listening 
capability and check the local noise level. If there is high level of noise, then 
it is probable that there are UEs in the area, and they would benefit if this 
cell is switched on again.
UE measurements method is where the coverage cell can ask a dormant 
cell or cells to transmit the reference signal for a short “probing” interval. 
At the same time, the UEs within the coverage cell are asked to measure 
the reference signal(s) and report back the results. After the probing interval, 
the dormant cells can return back to their dormant state. The measurement 
results should indicate to the coverage cell which dormant cells should be 
switched on.
The coverage cell can also exploit positioning information from UEs 
to determine which dormant cells to switch on. However, not all UEs have 
accurate positioning capability. To improve this method, dormant cells can 
start a specific timer when they are switched on and then on the expiration 
of this timer the cell should check if it is serving enough UEs to justify its 
switched-on state. If not, the cell can switch itself off again.
The eNodeB or eNodeBs that will provide the service once some 
other cells have been switched off to save energy are called compensating 
eNodeBs. Figure 11.2 presented a case where the compensating cell did not 
have to do anything to improve its coverage when the capacity cells were 
switched off since it already covered the area completely. Figure 11.3, on 
the other hand, presents a case where the compensating eNodeB will have 
to increase its Tx power to cover the whole coverage area of dormant cells. 
In this scenario, cells B, C, D, E, and F are switched off, and cell A has to 
increase its coverage area in compensation.
Once a decision has been made that the cell is to be switched off, all 
UEs with a connection in the cell have to be handed over to the compensa-
tion cell, and the energy-saving cell should not be switched off before this 
has been accomplished.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Note that base stations are the only part of the network infrastructure 
that can be switched off and on to provide energy saving. Other equipment 
in the network has to be switched on and in use continuously.
In summary, the problems in network energy saving include:
1.	 How to select which cells to switch off and when for energy saving;
2.	 How to decide which cells will act as compensating cells;
3.	 How to select which dormant cells to switch on and when.
The mechanisms to solve the issues above are still under discussion in 
Release 12. For example, this may require new signaling messages over the 
X2 interface between eNodeBs or it may be handled via O&M interven-
tion, or the selected solution may involve both the O&M and the inter-
eNodeB signaling.
Energy saving is a study item in Release 12, and, as such, standardized 
non-OAM solutions for network energy saving may have to wait until Re-
lease 13. Energy saving studies have so far produced two technical reports in 
[1, 2], and there is also a small section on energy saving in [3].
11.2  MIMO
11.2.1  MIMO Overview
MIMO is a form of multiantenna technology, exploiting a technique called 
spatial multiplexing. MIMO is not a 3GPP-specific technology and even 
within 3GPP, MIMO has already been used in UTRAN since Release 7 
and in LTE from the beginning (i.e., Release 8). However, MIMO has been 
considerably enhanced for LTE-A, and that is why it is discussed here.
MIMO is not the only multiantenna technique, there are many other 
things one can do with multiple antennas. Sometimes the term MIMO 
has been misused, either deliberately or by ignorance, as a label for other 
multiantenna systems, too. In this book MIMO is considered to be a system 
that exploits spatial diversity (i.e., we do not consider MIMO to be synony-
mous to multiantenna systems that exploit beamforming or transmit and/
or receiver diversity).
In spatial multiplexing each transmitting antenna sends independent 
data streams. MIMO introduces a new way of handling the radio inter-
face channel resources. Previously transmission channels were thought to be 
shared and allocated among users by partitioning of frequency and time (as 
in FDMA/TDMA systems such as GSM) or by means of frequency, time, 
and code (as in UMTS). However, MIMO introduces a new spatial dimen-
sion. It has been shown that it is possible to separate two or more transmis-
sions at the receiver even if they have been sent using the same frequency, 

220 
 
LTE-A Features
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
time, and code, as long as their spatial signatures are sufficiently different. 
MIMO systems can achieve this by using several transmit and receive anten-
nas, provided that the antenna spacing at both ends of the radio link is suffi-
ciently large and the environment is rich in scatterers. In optimal conditions 
these antennas can form several parallel transmission channels, which can 
employ the same frequency, time, and code space, thus increasing the system 
capacity considerably. A MIMO system with m transmit and n receive an-
tennas can achieve up to C = min (m,n) independent subchannels. In terms 
of MIMO, a good operating environment is one with high signal-to-noise 
(S/N) ratio and that is rich in multipath (for an example, see Figure 11.4).
However, increasing the number of independent subchannels by means 
of increasing the number of transmit and receive antennas will bring dimin-
ishing returns. The channels have to be uncorrelated and uncoupled, both 
of which are increasingly difficult to achieve when more antennas needs to 
be packed into small devices. The bigger the distance between antennas, the 
more likely it is that the transmissions from those antennas will undergo in-
dependent fading and thus they will have unique spatial signatures. MIMO 
antenna technology has developed rapidly in recent years, and there are 
several different types of antennas available, each with different performance 
parameters. However, a good ballpark figure for UE design is that antenna 
elements should be at least half a wavelength apart. For a mobile operating 
at 2.6-GHz frequency, this means about 5.8 cm. But on 800-MHz operat-
ing band the separation should already be 18.7 cm. Lower frequencies are 
clearly challenging for MIMO handsets. But it is also good to remember 
that data-hungry devices are not those with the smallest form factor, but 
those with larger displays: large smart phones and tablet PCs. Such devices 
provide a much better base onto which to attach MIMO antennas. Still, 
multiple MIMO antenna elements are problematic, and thus further re-
search on multiantenna techniques is needed.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
11.2.2  Downlink MIMO
LTE in Releases 8 and 9 supported 4 × 4 MIMO in the downlink and 2 × 
2 MIMO in the uplink. In LTE-A this is increased to 8 × 8 in the downlink 
and 4 × 4 in the uplink. The 8 × 8 MIMO is definitely something that will 
not be seen in operational networks in the near future, since equipping both 
eNBs and UEs with eight antennas is a costly and complex exercise.
The theoretical peak data rate for an 8 × 8 MIMO system deployed on 
a 20-MHz carrier would be 600 Mbps. LTE-A also enables carrier aggrega-
tion, up to five component carriers together. If we assume an 8 × 8 MIMO, 
and 5 × 20 MHz aggregated carriers, then the theoretical maximum is 3 
Gbps. Needless to say, this is a purely theoretical number. 
There are two ways to use MIMO in 3GPP: single user MIMO (SU-
MIMO) and multiuser MIMO (MU-MIMO) (see Figure 11.5). In SU-
MIMO all MIMO layers are assigned to the same UE; in MU-MIMO 
they are assigned to different UEs. A cell can switch between these modes 
dynamically. The UE in a MU-MIMO cell does not have to be aware of 
other UEs, which may be spatially multiplexed to use the same frequency/
time resources.
SU-MIMO provides a higher theoretical peak data rate for one user, 
but in practice the full 8 × 8 SU-MIMO will not be used for some time to 
come. Its successful usage would require that those several layers are not spa-
tially correlated and indeed that both the eNB and the UE have 8 Tx/Rx 
antennas. Moreover, most applications do not require or provide continuous 
high data rates. Therefore using SU-MIMO with an 8 × 8 antenna installa-
tion (or even with 4 × 4) is likely to result in a suboptimal solution system 
capacity-wise. MU-MIMO is a better solution in this sense. MU-MIMO 
can be exploited even by single-antenna UEs; that means it is available for 
all LTE-A-capable UEs. Moreover, since the individual UEs are in differ-
ent locations, it is more likely that the different MIMO layers are spatially

separated. As a result MU-MIMO is likely to provide higher throughput per 
cell/sector than SU-MIMO.
Spatial multiplexing in LTE downlink can be either open loop or closed 
loop. Open loop spatial multiplexing does not need channel state informa-
tion (measurement results) from the UE, whereas in the closed loop method 
UE feedback is required. Generally speaking, if the transmitter knows the 
channel state information (CSI), it can use this information in precoding, 
which will result in more robust transmissions. The transmitter tries to com-
pensate for the problems in the airwaves in such a way that the signal that 
the receiver gets should be as error-free as possible.
There are two major problems in delivering the CSI from the receiver 
to the transmitter:
1.	 There are many transmission channels, especially in MIMO sys-
tems, and thus several independent channels to measure. The 
amount of measurement results very easily grows so large that its 
delivery to the transmitter would consume a large amount of avail-
able bandwidth.
2.	 The channel state can change very quickly, especially if the receiver 
or transmitter is moving. Therefore, channel measurements should 
be delivered to the transmitter quickly because they will become 
less and less relevant over time.
Problem 1 is an especially serious one. A 2 × 2 MIMO system has 4 
individual component channels to measure and report, a 4 × 4 system has 
16 channels, and a 8 × 8 MIMO system should report the channel state in-
formation from 64 channels. In LTE the problem of CSI delivery has been 
solved by the use of codebooks. A codebook is a collection of predefined 
matrices, each indicating a certain set of the transmission parameters that are 
suitable for this channel state. The receiver measures the channel and then 
selects the entry from the codebook that best characterizes the CSI. Instead 
of signaling all the channel parameters to the transmitter, the receiver simply 
sends the index of the codebook entry. A codebook has a limited size, and 
therefore this method can never fully characterize the channel. In a 2 × 2 
MIMO channel the codebook size is 4, and in a 4 × 4 system it is 16. Thus, 
a 2 × 2 MIMO receiver can signal the codebook index with two bits, and 
a 4 × 4 MIMO receiver needs four bits for the index. The codebooks are 
defined in [4].
Once the precoder in the transmitter knows the precoding matrix in-
dex to be used, it simply takes the block of symbol vectors from the layer 
mapping as an input and multiplies it with the precoding matrix.
Note that in the TDD mode the problem of CSI is much easier to 
solve since the same channel is used for both transmission links (uplink and

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
downlink). The transmitter will know the channel state because it is also 
receiving on the same channel.
The use of multiple antennas is under the control of the eNodeB. In 
order to be able to quickly inform the UE on what kind of data transmis-
sion method is used in the downlink, a concept called the transmission mode 
(TM) has been defined. In Release 11 there are 10 different TMs. The eNo-
deB informs the UE about the TM to be used via RRC signaling. Different 
TMs indicate whether multiple antennas are used, and, if they are used, then 
in what kind of configuration (e.g., transmit diversity or spatial multiplexing 
multiuser MIMO), and other precoding-related information. Table 11.1 [5] 
gives a short description of each mode.
In general, MIMO (or spatial multiplexing in standards jargon) should 
be used when the channel conditions are good, and transmit diversity or 
large delay cyclic delay diversity (CDD) should be used when the channel 
conditions are poor. This is because spatial multiplexing requires a high-
quality radio channel to perform successfully. On weaker channels, it is bet-
ter to transmit only one data stream and use diversity provided by multiple 
antennas to make sure that the data gets through without errors. On weak 
channels diversity schemes can provide higher data throughput than spatial 
multiplexing because it may be possible to employ more efficient MCS val-

ues (e.g., higher-order modulation) with diversity schemes than with spatial 
multiplexing (Figure 11.6).
11.2.3  Uplink MIMO
Uplink MIMO in LTE-A is slightly different from downlink MIMO. First 
of all, UEs are physically much smaller than eNodeBs and thus it is difficult 
to have as many antennas in a UE as in an eNodeB. Therefore, the maxi-
mum number of antennas is four, at least in Release 11. Moreover, UEs are 
handheld devices, and thus it is impossible to employ techniques such as 
beamforming in the uplink. Therefore, in the uplink there are just two alter-
natives on what the UE can do with its antennas: single antenna transmission 
or spatial multiplexing with two to four antennas.
MIMO is discussed in several LTE specifications (e.g., [3–6]).
11.3  Relays
Relays in LTE-A are so called L3 relays. These are quite intelligent devices, 
combining both eNB and UE functionalities. They are different from much 
simpler repeaters, also known as L1 relays, which basically just forward the 
received signal blindly.
The reasons to use relays in LTE-A are that they can provide enhanced 
coverage and capacity at cell edges and they can also be used to connect 
remote locations without fiber connections. The latter point is actually very 
important in some cases. Small base stations as such are quite inexpensive 
nowadays, but the backhaul connection they require can, in some cases, be 
very expensive to install. Relay nodes (RNs) have the wireless backhaul 
connection “in-built” in the technology, though a 3GPP RN is not by all

means the only technology that can be used to build wireless backhaul for 
base stations.
Figure 11.7 presents the LTE-A relay architecture. The relay node is 
connected to the donor eNB (DeNB) via the radio interface Un. This is 
a modified LTE air interface Uu. The difference between Uu and Un is 
specified in [7]. From the UE point of view, the RN behaves like an eNB. 
In fact, the UE is not aware that it is connected to a RN; this entity is just 
another eNB for a UE. The RN supports the eNB functionality as well as 
part of the UE functionality. The RN terminates S1, X2, and Un interfaces. 
The DeNB provides S1 and X2 proxy functionality between the RN and 
other network nodes such as eNBs, MMEs, and S-GWs. Because of the 
proxy functionality, the DeNB appears as an MME (for S1-MME), an eNB 
(for X2), and an S-GW (for S1-U) to the RN. The protocol stacks in a RN 
were  presented in Section 7.4.
At the moment (Release 12) LTE-A does not support multihop relays 
(i.e., setups where several RNs are linked into a chain). There is only one 
RN between the DeNB and the UE. Also, RN mobility is not supported 
in Releases 10 and 11 (that is, an RN cannot change its DeNB while it is 
in active mode), although this may change in the future with mobile relays 
(see Section 12.2.3).
With relay nodes, there are two radio links: Un interface for the back-
haul link and Uu interface for the access link. These can operate on the 
same frequency or on different frequencies. Both arrangements have their 
advantages and disadvantages.
Same-frequency relays are called inband relays. These are more spectrum 
efficient, since both the DeNB and the RN use the same frequency band. 
Therefore, this is a good solution for cases where spectrum is scarce. On the 
other hand, inband relays need to employ a special subframe configuration

that separates backhaul and access links in the time domain. The inband 
solution also causes longer delays to signals because of the necessary time 
delay between backhaul and access signals.
If the backhaul and access links are configured to use different fre-
quencies, then the result is called an outband relay. In this case, subframe 
configuration data is needed. Both radio links can operate independently of 
each other, though the penalty is increased spectrum usage. Also care should 
be taken that the two frequencies are far enough apart from each other to 
prevent interference (see Figure 11.8).
The third option is to employ inband relays, but to isolate the antennas 
for backhaul and access links in a way that prevents interantenna interfer-
ence (e.g., by using directed antennas). In this case, a special subframe con-
figuration is not needed.
Which relay configuration is used (inband or outband) will be config-
ured by the O&M system. Once the RN is set up, it will inform the DeNB 
in the RRC connection setup complete message (rn-SubframeConfigReq 
field) whether it needs to receive subframe configuration data.
Relay functionality is specified in [3, 7–10].
11.4  Carrier Aggregation
Carrier aggregation is a new feature that is adopted in LTE-advanced. It 
is used to combine several carriers (up to five) into one logical aggregated 
carrier. However, in Releases 10 and 11 only two component carriers are 
supported. The component carriers are normal carriers (i.e., similar to stan-
dard LTE carriers), and thus they can have a bandwidth of 1.4, 3, 5, 10, 15, or 
20 MHz. Therefore, the theoretical maximum bandwidth of an aggregated

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
carrier is 100 MHz. However, it is very unlikely that such a wide carrier 
is seen in operational networks. Rather, the main reason for carrier aggre-
gation is that many operators have access to only relatively small slices of 
spectrum, and carrier aggregation provides to way to combine those slices 
into wider spectrum channels.
The component carriers do not have to be similar in size. For example, 
one aggregated carrier can consist of three component carriers with band-
widths of 3, 5, and 10 MHz. In the FDD mode the number of component 
carriers can be different in uplink and downlink, but in the uplink the num-
ber of component carriers has to be smaller than or equal to the number 
of downlink component carriers. In the TDD mode, due to the nature of 
this mode, both uplink and downlink must have the same number of com-
ponents carriers.
There are three ways to combine component carriers into an aggre-
gated carrier:
1.	 Intraband contiguous;
2.	 Intraband noncontiguous;
3.	 Interband noncontiguous.
In the first case all component carriers are on the same frequency band, 
forming a continuous block. In the second case the component carriers 
are still on the same frequency band, but there are frequency gaps between 
them. In the third case the component carriers are from different frequency 
bands, in which case there are obviously gaps between them (see Figure 
11.9).
Since components carriers are standard LTE carriers, older LTE (non-
LTE-A) devices (i.e., release 8/9 UEs) can use them as before, whereas 
LTE-A devices can exploit also aggregate carriers.
Each component carrier employs a separate serving cell. However, 
these cells may and often will originate from the same eNodeB. One of 
the serving cells is the primary component carrier (PCC), and the others 
are secondary component carriers (SCC). The RRC connection (control 
signaling) is handled by the PCC only.
Component carriers may have different coverage areas. This is obvious 
if they originate from different eNodeBs, but even CCs originating from 
the same eNodeB can differ in their coverage areas. This is due to differ-
ent carrier frequencies and different transmission powers. Release 11 in-
troduced different timing advance values for different component carriers, 
which enables the CCs to originate from multiple sites. Furthermore, this 
feature enables the use of CCs in heterogenous networks (HetNets); (i.e., 
networks that have a mixture of macro, pico, and femto cells). Tradition-
ally such networks are implemented in a way that each layer (macro, pico, 
femto) has its own frequency band in order to avoid interference between 

228 
 
LTE-A Features
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
layers. However, this may lead to less than optimal resource usage and also 
numerous handovers when a UE moves between layers. However, carrier 
aggregation enables the UE to have CCs on different layers. Typically, the 
macro cell is the PCC, and pico/femto cells are SCCs. This arrangement 
enables the UE to receive control signaling via the macro cell as well as user 
data via small cells that probably have more capacity available (see Figure 
11.10).
Since in carrier aggregation the PCC will handle control signaling for 
all CCs, it is foreseen that the capacity of the Release 8 PDCCH may run 
out (there are also other reasons why the PDCCH may become highly 
loaded, such as MU-MIMO).  To alleviate the problem, Release 11 has also 
introduced a new control channel type, enhanced physical downlink con-
trol channel (ePDCCH). The extra capacity for this channel is taken from 
PDSCH resources.
The allowed component carrier combinations for carrier aggregation 
are strictly defined; various carriers cannot be combined at will. This is 
because each combination has different radio performance requirements. 
Carrier aggregation is designed to operate in operating bands defined in

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Tables 11.2, 11.3, and 11.4 [11]. But note that these tables are continuously 
evolving as new carrier combinations are added to them.
There are six bandwidth classes defined for carrier aggregation, though 
only three of them are in use so far (A, B, and C). As seen from  Table 11.5, 
the maximum number of component carriers is only two in classes B and C.
Carrier aggregation as a feature is much more than just combining 
individual component carriers into bigger channels. Its ability to make Het-
Nets to operate more efficiently means that carrier aggregation will be 
widely used in future LTE networks. Carrier aggregation is discussed in [3, 
11, 12, 13].
11.5  Enhanced Intercell Interference Coordination
Enhanced intercell interference coordination (eICIC) tries to mitigate in-
tercell interference at cell edges. The ICIC feature actually consists of three 
(so far) different phases. The original ICIC was introduced in Release 8, the 
enhanced version (eICIC) in Release 10, and the further enhanced version 
(FeICIC) in Release 11.
The original ICIC is about scheduling the transmission resources (re-
source blocks and transmission power) in a way that mitigates the intercell 
interference. The basic idea is not to allocate the same resource blocks to 
UEs on both sides of a cell boundary. Instead it is better to perform inter-
cell resource allocation coordination for users near cell edges. Users that 
are closer to the eNodeB do not need similar treatment because they are 
less likely to cause intercell interference, as they are further away from cell 
boundaries, and in addition their transmission power is likely to be low 
because they are close to the eNodeB. Figure 11.11 clarifies a typical ICIC 
solution. Cell center UEs can be allocated any resource blocks and low 
tx power. On the other hand, the UEs near cell edges must use higher tx 
power to reach the eNodeB, and they can only be allocated a subset of the 
available resource blocks—a subset that does not overlap with the resource

any resource blocks, whereas for UE1 only those resource blocks that be-
long to cell B specific subset can be allocated.
The system needs a minimum of three different resource block subsets 
because the subsets can be reused in nonneighboring cells.
ICIC works fine for standard macrocell deployments, but not in small 
pico/femto cells that are deployed inside macrocells. As was shown in Sec-

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
up to 6 dB in Release 10. Though it can help the UEs at femto cell edges 
reconnect to the femto cell, it does not help with the interference those 
UEs are experiencing. The solution proposed in Release 10 is to use almost 
blank subframes (ABS). A certain number of subframes are nominated as 
ABS subframes. During ABS subframes only the most minimal set of signals 
(CRS/PSS/SSS/PBCH) is transmitted from the macro cell. The femto cell 
can then use these quiet frames to transmit to the UEs in its coverage area. 
The ABS configuration can be communicated to the femtocell via the X2 
interface and via the OAM interface if the X2 interface is not available.
Note that the ABS approach applies only to UEs that are in the femto 
cell edge area. UEs that are near the cell center can be served also during 
non-ABS subframes.
However, in practisc the heterogeneous network intercell interference 
problem is not this serious. Namely, femtocells are often deployed indoors, 
and then the interference from macrocells is not that severe. The walls of 
the building may act as a natural cell boundary; indoors are served by the 
femtocell and outdoors by the macrocell.
In Release 11 the intercell interference cancellation was further en-
hanced in the FeICIC work item. The main enhancement was to provide 
the UE with cell specific reference symbol (CRS) assistance information 
of the interfering cells. This information can be used in the interference 
cancellation receiver in the UE.
In case of strong interference the UE may not be able to decode even 
the system information transmitted. Therefore in Release 11 it is possible 
to transmit system information block type 1 (SIB1) information via dedi-
cated RRC signaling (RRCConnectionReconfiguration message). SIB1 
includes important information like PLMN IDs, tracking area code, cell 
identity, access restrictions, and information on scheduling of all other sys-
tem information elements.
For further information, please check [3, 14].
11.6  Evolved Multimedia Broadcast Multicast Service
Evolved multimedia broadcast multicast service (eMBMS) was first in-
troduced to LTE in Release 9. MBMS never took off in UMTS because 
UMTS networks simply did not have enough capacity to support adequate 
MBMS services. But with greatly enhanced capabilities of LTE-A, the ca-
pacity should not become an obstacle with eMBMS.
The most important eMBMS enhancement in Release 10 is the count-
ing function. This feature is designed to help the network operator to de-
cide which MBMS services are of interest to users and to prioritize them 

234 
 
LTE-A Features
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
accordingly. Because MBMS is a broadcast/multicast service, the network 
does not necessarily know how many users (if any) are receiving a particular 
broadcast. This may lead to a waste of resources if the network broadcasts 
services nobody (or very few users) wants to receive. The counting function 
checks the number of connected mode users that either already receive or 
want to receive a particular MBMS service.
The counting procedure is initiated by the network. The multicell/
multicast coordination entity (MCE) requests the eNodeBs with an MBMS 
service counting request message to count and report for one or more 
MBMS services the number of connected mode UEs receiving the MBMS 
service or interested in receiving it. 
The connected mode UEs that are interested in the indicated services 
will respond with a RRC counting response message. This message con-
tains short MBMS service identities (unique within the MBSFN service 
area) and may optionally include the information to identify the MBSFN 
area (if overlapping is configured).
Only Release 10 and later UEs are counted; Release 9 UEs will be 
ignored, since they do not support the necessary procedures. Also, only con-
nected mode UEs are counted.
The results are delivered back to the MCE in an MBMS service count-
ing results reporting message. The MCE then decides the priority order of

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
11.7  Self-Organizing Networks
SON is a set of various automatic tools that the operator can use to ease the 
deployment and management of LTE networks. These tools are very varying 
in nature, and some have very little in common. Yet they all belong under 
SON umbrella.
Next, we discuss the most important SON improvements in Releases 
10 and 11.
11.7.1  Automatic Neighbour Relations (ANR)
The purpose of the ANR function is to relieve the operator from the task 
of manually managing neighbor relations (NRs) of cells. The ANR function 
is located in the eNodeB and manages the neighbor relation table (NRT). 
With the help of UEs, the neighbor detection function finds new neighbors 
and adds them to the NRT. ANR also contains the neighbor removal func-
tion, which removes outdated NRs. 
Release 11 ANR improvements include interradio access technology 
(IRAT) ANR (i.e., ANR from E-UTRAN to GERAN, UTRAN, and 
CDMA2000).
11.7.2  Mobililty Load Balancing (MLB)
The objective of load balancing is to distribute cell load evenly among cells 
or to transfer part of the traffic from congested cells, at the same time avoid-
ing unnecessary load balancing handovers and redirections. This is done by 
self-optimizing mobility parameters and handover actions. The MLB func-
tion includes the following subfunctions:
••
Load reporting;
••
Load balancing handovers;
••
Load balancing by adapting handover and/or reselection parameters.
11.7.3  Mobility Robustness Optimization (MRO)
The MRO function aims at detecting and enabling correction of the fol-
lowing problems:
••
Connection failures due to intra-LTE or inter-RAT mobility;
••
Unnecessary handover (HO) to another RAT (too early IRAT HO 
with no radio link failure);

236

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
••
Inter-RAT ping-pong HO.
This function aims at to optimize relevant HO algorithm parameters to 
mitigate the problems of too early handovers, too late handovers, and inef-
ficient use of network resources.
11.7.4  Coverage and Capacity Optimization
This function identifies problems with network coverage or capacity. The 
network may have coverage holes, weak coverage, pilot pollution, overshoot 
coverage, or DL and UL channel coverage mismatch. The input data for the 
function is collected from performance measurements at the source and/or 
target eNodeBs, minimizing drive tests (MDT) measurements, or handover 
(HO)–related performance measurements.
11.7.5  RACH Optimization Function
This function aims to automatically set several parameters related to the 
performance of random access channel (RACH):
••
RACH configuration (resource unit allocation);
••
RACH preamble split (among dedicated, group A, group B);
•• RACH backoff parameter value;
••
RACH transmission power control parameters.
11.7.6  Coordination Between Various SON Functions
This function addresses conflicts that could happen when separate SON 
functions try to change the same network configuration parameter. This is a 
new SON function, specified in Release 11.
Energy saving and MDT functions are also sometimes included in 
SON functions. Both of these have been discussed elsewhere in this book; 
energy saving in Section 11.1 and MDT in Section 6.5.3.7.
SON is discussed in several specifications because SON consists of 
many independent functions. For a start, see [3, 21].
11.8  Coordinated Multipoint Transmission/Reception
Coordinated multipoint transmission and reception function (CoMP) re-
sembles the soft handover function in some other mobile networks. It po-
tentially improves the quality of service for UEs that are near cell edges.

Coordinated Multipoint Transmission/Reception 
 
237
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Such UEs may be able to receive signals from several cells, and the uplink 
transmission from the UE could be received by several cells. Currently the 
signals from the other cells would be interference to the UE in LTE, but 
if there were a way to coordinate the downlink transmissions from all cells 
within the range, the result would be a greatly improved signal quality. In the 
uplink fewer changes would ne needed because the signal could already be 
received by several cells. Therefore, uplink CoMP probably does not need 
major specification changes, as it is more of an implementation issue (see 
Figure 11.14).
11.8.1  Downlink CoMP
For the downlink CoMP, three different approaches have been studied by 
3GPP:
••
Joint processing (JP);
••
Coordinated scheduling or beamforming;
••
Dynamic point selection (DPS).
Joint processing takes place when the same transmission to a UE is si-
multaneously transmitted from multiple transmitters. This approach requires 
tight coordination between transmitters.
Coordinated scheduling or beamforming (CS/CB) is a form of coor-
dination where a UE is transmitting with a single transmission or recep-
tion point that is the base station in the serving cell. CS/CB reduces the 
interference level experienced by a UE terminal by appropriately selecting 
the beamforming weights of interfering cells to steer the interference away 
from the UE.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
In dynamic point selection, the UE is always served by a single trans-
mitter. However, this transmitter may dynamically change, based on the 
channel state.
All these methods require very fast feedback on channel quality mea-
surements. Also, in case of joint processing and dynamic point selection, the 
backhaul network will be heavily loaded since the downlink data has to be 
sent to all potential transmitters. In case of the CS/CB method, only sched-
uling decisions and details of beams need to be coordinated.
11.8.2  Uplink CoMP
In the uplink direction there are two alternative approaches:
••
Joint reception (JR);
••
Coordinated scheduling and beamforming (CS/CB).
In joint reception the same signal is received by several receivers at 
multiple points. The individual signals are then combined and processed to 
produce the final signal. The main disadvantage with JR is that all partici-
pating eNodeBs need to transfer large amounts of data.
Coordinated scheduling operates by coordinating the scheduling de-
cisions among eNodes to minimize interference. This method provides a 
much reduced load in the backhaul network because only the scheduling 
data needs to be transferred between the different eNBs.
CoMP mechanisms have been shown to improve signal quality at cell 
edges. However, because some CoMP mechanisms require extra process-
ing and transmitting data between eNodeBs, they will also increase signal 
latency, which will be a critical issue for LTE-A. With this in mind, 3GPP 
has launched a new study in [22] to find out how CoMP would work with 
nonideal backhaul.
Other CoMP-related 3GPP documents are found from [3, 23].
11.9  LTE and Voice
There is a well-known problem with LTE and its provision of circuit-
switched services, the most important of which are the voice calls. Older 
systems, such as GERAN and UMTS, have both circuit-switched and core-
switched domains, and separate entities in the core network can handle 
either circuit-switched or packet-switched connections. However, LTE has 
only a packet-switched core network, the evolved packet core (EPC).
When LTE was originally being designed, it was thought that voice 
could be provided to LTE users via the IP multimedia subsystem (IMS)

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
and thus LTE would not need a circuit-switched domain. This is a good 
plan, except that mobile operators were not keen on deploying IMS. IMS 
has been in specifications for about 10 years by now, well before the initial 
LTE was launched, but it has not been adopted by mobile operators as was 
originally envisaged. The reasons for this are various, but basically IMS is a 
major upgrade that requires lots of work: upgrades to equipment, creating 
the business case for IMS services, interoperability tests, increased signaling 
and user data because of IMS sessions, and so on. Moreover, there was a lack 
of IMS-capable devices as phone makers did not bother to add IMS capa-
bility into their handsets because there were no IMS-capable networks. And 
most LTE operators already have 2G/3G networks that can offer circuit-
switched services for those who need them. IMS would not bring new 
services as such, but it could deliver them more efficiently. Therefore, many 
operators preferred to wait, let the others to do the IMS adoption first, and 
learn from their experiences/mistakes.
Note that IMS is not (only) about delivering voice over LTE; this is just 
one IMS service among others. But the lack of voice provision over LTE 
has forced the operators to do something about the matter. Basically they 
have three options to choose from:
••
Circuit-switched fall back (CSFB);
••
Voice over LTE via GAN (VoLGA);
••
Voice over LTE.
CSFB is the most common solution operators have adopted. Its princi-
ple is that if 4G cannot do voice, then let’s do it via 2G or 3G. If the network 
operator also has a 2G or 3G network, then voice calls are routed via that 
network using the circuit-switched domain. This feature has been specified 
in LTE standards since Release 8 (i.e., from the start of LTE), and it has been 
enhanced since then. However, this functionality is not very “elegant”—it 
was meant to be a temporary solution for a problem that was expected to 
go away soon. CSFB includes some challenges, mainly with the call setup 
times in 2G/3G. When the mobile gets an indication in LTE that there is an 
incoming CS call (or indeed the mobile user wants to make a call), every-
thing has to happen quickly because the user will not accept if the mobile 
stays quiet for several seconds before a CS call has been established with the 
other network.
The first problem to solve is how the mobile gets the indication of an 
incoming CS call in the first place. If the mobile is camped on the LTE net-
work, the other network (2G or 3G) in principle does not know where the 
mobile is and thus cannot route the incoming call indication appropriately. 
LTE employs tracking areas (TAs) to register the location of the mobile, 
whereas 3G uses location areas (LAs) for the same purpose. The movement 

240 
 
LTE-A Features
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
of the mobile within the LTE network will trigger a tracking area update 
if the mobile enters a new TA. As a result of this procedure, the new TA 
identity will be stored in the MME. However, the MSC/VLR in 3G does 
not have knowledge about this procedure, and, even if it was told about the 
new TAI, it would have no meaning to MSC/VLR because that 3G register 
knows only LAIs.
The solution is to combine the mobility management processes of the 
3G CS domain and LTE. The MME in the LTE network has to maintain 
a mapping table of LAs and TAs. This table informs the MME on where 
to forward (i.e., which MSC/VLR) the location registration message that 
is received from the mobile. Each TA is coupled with an LA that overlaps 
its area. Note that this table is operator maintained and has to be renewed 
every time TAs or LAs are reconfigured.
After the location registration, also the MSC/VLR in 3G receives the 
LTE location information (i.e., the identity of the MME on which area 
the mobile is currently located). The MSC/VLR can use this information 
to relay the circuit-switched call request from 3G to the correct address in 
LTE.
Once the mobile in the LTE network receives a voice call setup request 
from 3G, the most common solution is an LTE to UMTS redirection in 
which the mobile only reads the mandatory system information blocks 
(SIB) from the new 3G cell before accessing it. An additional challenge is 
that there are different types of 2G/3G networks; those who need to handle 
CSFB include GSM, UMTS, and CDMA2000. They all need (more or less) 
different mechanisms to handle CSFB.
It is not only voice calls that need special treatment in early LTE net-
works—SMS is another important service that lacks the SMS-over-IMS 
functionality in those networks. Instead, a temporary solution is available as 
SMS-over-SG interface. This solution enables the LTE network to transmit 
circuit-switched SMSs. SG is an interface in the core network, between 
the MME in the EPS (in LTE), and the mobile switching center (MSC) 
in the CS domain. SG is tasked to handle mobility management and pag-
ing procedures, and now, in early LTE systems, also SMS. SMS-over-SG 
is a different procedure from CSFB. Since SG is an interface within the

core network, this procedure is transparent to mobiles. The procedure does 
not trigger a fallback to 2G/3G, and thus it does not require the presence 
of those networks as CSFB does. Standards-wise, if the network supports 
CSFB, it also has to support SMS-over-SG, but this requirement does not 
apply the other way around.
The story of voice in LTE networks has been a slightly embarrassing 
episode for the LTE community. Here we have a state-of-the-art telecom-
munications system that is capable of everything . . . except you cannot 
make a voice call to your mother! The issue is being addressed, but the most 
widely used CSFB solution is clearly a temporary one. Its biggest drawback 
is that an LTE operator also needs overlapping 2G/3G coverage before 
CSFB can be employed. Whereas this is normally the state of affairs any-
way, it is by no means carved into stone. A new entrant operator (so called 
greenfield operator) does not have a “backup” network into which to make 
a call fallback. Such an operator may want to implement IMS services in 
LTE already at the network launch. However, there is still a problem with 
the supply of IMS capable mobile handsets.

Chapter 12
Future Developments
12.1  Introduction
In this chapter we try to have a look into the future. The contents of this 
chapter are divided into two parts. First we will discuss the near future—
what kind of improvements are expected to be introduced to LTE-A speci-
fications within the next two to three years (i.e., in Releases 12 and 13). 
Note that even if something is added into a LTE release now, it will take at 
least two to three years before that release is deployed by an operator, and in 
most cases it will take much longer.
In the second part of this chapter the focus is on the fifth generation 
system. That is expected to be launched around the year 2020. Various fore-
casts are predicting that by 2020 the mobile data traffic will increase by a 
factor of 1000, and a new generation system must be designed to provide 
performance that matches the expected increase in traffic volume. Also, it 
is widely suggested that the required performance improvements can be 
achieved by a combination of three factors:
1.	 More bandwidth;
2.	 Massive use of small cells;
3.	 Further improvements of existing mechanisms.
Even though this list is, in principle, quite correct, it gives a much too 
simplistic view of the challenges that are awaiting 5G system designers. 
More about this in Section 12.3.
It must also be stressed here that the gradual improvements introduced 
in LTE-A, and the 5G improvements discussed in this chapter, are not sepa-
rate issues. LTE-A has to continuously evolve, release by release, so that it 
can handle the increased data traffic and other challenges it encounters 
every year. By 2020, it may have evolved into something that can be labeled 
as 5G.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
12.2  Evolving LTE-A
The way 3GPP develops standards is one of gradual improvement. There 
are some bigger leaps such as adopting OFDMA as a basis of the LTE air 
interface, thus replacing WCDMA. But still, every new release brings new 
features and improves existing ones in order to provide better services to 
users. This process did not stop when LTE was launched in Release 8, and it 
did not stop when LTE-A was introduced in Release 10. It still continues, 
with Release 12 to be frozen in late 2014, and Release 13 possibly 1.5–2 
years later.
In this section we will have a look at a few possible future LTE-A en-
hancements. These features are still at a study phase or at stage 1 specifica-
tion phase, so it is by no means certain that these features will appear in final 
stage 3 specifications, or if they do, in what format.
12.2.1  Proximity Services
Proximity services refer to a very old idea. It is a service that has been pro-
posed as an enhancement to most mobile communications systems, but has 
not found success very often so far. Proximity services are known by many 
other names, too, such as device-to-device (D2D) communications, and 
walkie-talkie communications.
The basic idea in proximity services is that two UEs close to each other 
could communicate directly with each other, with only limited involvement 
by the mobile network, or in an extreme case even without the mobile net-
work. Such functionality might be useful in some special cases. If the user 
plane is connected directly from one UE to another, then the network user 
plane resources are not consumed. However, such functionality would still 
consume air interface resources. Another scenario is the communication of 
two UEs, at least one of which is outside the network coverage area. With-
out proximity services, such a connection would not be possible. On the 
other hand one could ask how common is such a scenario. Mobile phone 
networks are already widely deployed, and in any case the communicating 
UEs should be relatively close to each other (i.e., within a few kilometers, 
depending on radio conditions) before proximity services could be used. 
The third, and quite important, use case is public safety. Emergency services 
typically do not trust public mobile phone networks in their communica-
tions because in a major accident the local communications network may 
also be destroyed. Therefore, these services use specialized systems (such as 
TETRA) that can support direct connections between handsets. However, 
if LTE-A were to support direct connections, then LTE-A handsets could 
also be adopted by emergency services.

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Figure 12.1 depicts the basic proximity services scenario whereby the 
user plane is routed directly between two communicating UEs, but the 
control plane is routed to the MME as usual.
There are also several other possible architectural scenarios for proxim-
ity services, some of which are depicted in Figures 12.2 and 12.3. The com-
municating UEs can be connected via the local eNodeB (if they are both 
connected to the same eNodeB). UEs may also be connected to two dif-
ferent PLMNs, with no overlapping coverage, but still close enough to each 
other so that they could try to have a direct proximity services connection. 
One UE can also be outside the network coverage while connected to 
a UE that is within the coverage area, or both UEs can be outside the ser-
vice area. The latter scenario is especially interesting for emergency services,

since it would allow proximity service-capable UEs to continue communi-
cating even when the network is not there.
Note that the cases 3 and 4 are problematic in that the UEs’ outside 
network coverage cannot get any control information from the network, 
at least not directly. Without this radio link configuration information, any 
connection to another UE is impossible. In case the UEs in question are 
special UEs that have been designed, say, for emergency services use, they 
could have been preconfigured so that in case there is no network connec-
tion, they would start using a stored configuration that allows them to con-
nect to other UEs in the same preconfigured group. Alternatively, one prox-
imity service UE in a group could be configured to act as a radio resource 
controller—in a way, a mobile mini-MME (see Figure 12.4). This UE could 
manage the radio connection control for all UEs within the group.
Another variation of the case in Figure 12.4 is presented in Figure 12.5. 
In this example the radio resource controller UE also acts as a relay (i.e., the 
user plane is also relayed via it). In this case the UEs do not connect directly 
to each other. In case the relay UE itself is within the mobile network cov-
erage, it can also relay UE connections to the PLMN if that is required. In 
the second case, the relay UE can also relay control signaling to the eNodeB, 
so it does not need to act as a radio resource controller anymore. In fact, if a 
radio resource controller-capable UE detects a mobile network, it probably 
should not allocate radio resources by itself anymore but relay such requests 
to this network. This is because any radio resource allocation done by it may 
clash with radio resource allocations done by the mobile network control 
node (i.e., the MME).

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Proximity services would also allow a kind of closed user group com-
munication whereby the members of a group (members of a family, club, 
company, and so on) could communicate directly with each other.
Proximity services are a fundamentally new concept for LTE-A. There-
fore, introducing such services is not an easy task. Many new mechanisms 
would need to be introduced in specifications. Most of them are relatively 
easy to solve technically; rather, the problems are more at the policy level. 
For example, to be able to form a direct connection with another UE, the 
user must first know if the other UE is nearby. The process of finding out 
who is nearby is called proximity discovery. Several proposals exist on how 
this could be solved [1]. However, proximity discovery would clearly breach 
other user’s privacy by revealing their location information. Issues like this 
have to be solved by new proximity services policies or rules.
Finally, even though all technical issues around proximity services are 
possible to solve, the main question is whether there is a strong enough

business case behind it. New features to mobile networks are introduced 
by mobile operators. They are investing real money to launch new services 
and expect to get their investments back within limited number of years. 
In case of proximity services, it is not clear what the benefit would be for 
operators (i.e., how can they make money out of this). They could of course 
charge for the privilege of being a member of a closed user group that can 
use the proximity services. But then again, why would anybody want to pay 
extra for something that they can already do without proximity services? 
Use cases where one or more UEs are outside the network coverage are 
extremely rare. For the author of this book, the only solid use case is the use 
of proximity services by emergency services. However, it is not clear if this 
use case is enough for network operators to make an investment decision 
regarding proximity services.
Proximity services are still in a study phase in 3GPP. Some study results 
are already available in [1, 2].
12.2.2  Machine-Type Communications
Machine-type communication (MTC) is data communication that involves 
entities that are not human. Its characteristics are very different from the 
usual human-to-human communication, at least in following aspects:
•• Different market scenarios;
•• All communication is data;
•• Communication has to be very low cost;
•• Very large number of communicating devices;
•• To a large extent, little traffic per device.
MTC devices and services do not form a single coherent group. Cer-
tain MTC services are more tolerant and can accept a lower level of per-
formance (e.g., longer latencies and low data throughput). However, other 
MTC services will have similar service requirements as current LTE-A mo-
bile network services.
The 3GPP technical report [3] has a list of examples of MTC applica-
tions (see Table 12.1).
The work to add support for MTC is still at early study phases in 3GPP. 
Much more will be needed before suitable solutions are found. However, 
MTC support is an important LTE-A enhancement that has to find its 
way to 3GPP specifications in the coming years. The problem is that MTC 
applications are so varying that each application class may require its own 
solutions.

The following sections contain some examples of MTC applications 
and problems that need to be solved in each case [3].
Addressing from a Centralized Entity
Metering devices can be controlled by a centralized entity that informs the 
actual metering device when it needs measurement results. In some cases, 
there may be a requirement for a low latency response.
Theft-Vulnerable MTC Device
MTC devices are often installed in remote locations that are not monitored 
by humans. Therefore, they are prone to vandalism or theft. The network

cannot prevent this from happening, but it should be able to detect what has 
been done to the device in order to deactivate the device and the related 
USIM.
Time-Controlled MTC Device
Some MTC applications are not time critical. The communication can take 
place at any time. A good example of this is an electric power meter reading. 
The network operator can configure these types of devices to communicate 
only during low traffic periods.
Avoid Radio Network Congestion
Some MTC applications tend to generate bursty traffic. These are typically 
monitoring sensors. When a triggering event occurs, it tends to occur for a 
large number of MTC devices simultaneously. The radio network must be 
prepared for a large number of MTC devices in a particular area to transmit 
data almost simultaneously.
Avoid Core Network Congestion
The radio access network may be able to handle the bursty traffic case de-
scribed in the previous paragraph (e.g., when MTC devices are well scat-
tered over the network). Despite this, when a large number of MTC devices 
is transmitting simultaneously, congestion may take place in the core net-
work or on the link between the core network and the MTC server.
Avoid Signaling Network Congestion
The previous two examples were about congestion caused by bursty pay-
load data traffic. However, MTC devices may also generate bursty signaling 
traffic, which may cause problems. For example, after a power outage, some 
MTC devices may reboot themselves at the same time and then send almost 
simultaneous messages to the MTC server to inform the server about their 
active status.
Access Control with Billing Plan
An USIM should only be used with the associated MTC device, and there 
should be a mechanism to enforce this. Many MTC devices have very low 
cost billing plans, and therefore using such an USIM with other non-MTC 
devices is not acceptable.
Extra Low Power Consumption Devices
There are many MTC use cases where extra low power consumption is es-
sential because the power source for the MTC device cannot be replaced (or 
the replacement is so difficult that it should only be done in extreme cases). 
These devices include, for example, many battery-powered tracking devices 

	
12.2 
Evolving LTE-A 
 
251
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
and battery-powered sensors. That is, the system must be designed so that 
extra low power consumption in communication is possible.
Extra Low Power Consumption with Time-Controlled MTC Devices
An MTC device may be configured to communicate within predefined 
period and additionally be prepared to receive nonperiodic messages out-
side these periods. This case is a variation of the previous use case. Outside 
the defined communication periods, it should be possible for the network 
operator to configure the MTC device to enter a sleep mode, but there 
should also be a mechanism in place to wake the device in case an urgent 
communication need arises.
End-to-End Security for Roaming MTC Devices
For some MTC applications security may be important. If an MTC device 
is roaming outside the home network coverage area (an MTC device can be 
mobile or it might have been installed outside the home network in the first 
place), then the MTC application server cannot trust that the communica-
tion is secure. In this kind of case, it may be necessary to provide end-to-end 
security for messages exchanged between the MTC server and devices that 
are roaming.
Machine type communications is discussed, for example, in [3]. This is 
a stage 1 specification, so there is still a long way to go before stage 3 speci-
fications are available.
12.2.3  Mobile Relays
An increasing number of countries either have operational high-speed train 
systems or have plans to build such systems. In East Asia, Japan, China, Korea, 
and Taiwan all have operational bullet train networks, and high-speed train 
networks are also spreading across Europe. Such trains provide special chal-
lenges to mobile networks. In this section, we will discuss these challenges 
and possible solutions.
High-speed train challenges for mobile communications include the 
following:
1.	 High-speed vehicles were not taken into consideration when tradi-
tional cellular networks were first launched.
2.	 Train carriages typically suffer from poor signal penetration.
3.	 High-speed rail tracks have lots of tunnels in some mountainous 
countries.
High-speed trains are fast, but the speed itself is not a major problem 
for LTE devices since they can communicate with the network even when 
moving very fast (one of the design requirements of LTE-A was the ability 

252 
 
Future Developments
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
to have connections at 500 kph). The fastest high-speed trains can move at 
speeds of about 320 kph in normal operations. This speed translates to about 
90 meters per second. The base station coverage area can be highly varying, 
but typically those are only a few hundred meters in diameter. This would 
mean that a train enters a new cell area every few seconds. Moreover, the 
cell overlap area where the handover has to be performed is even shorter. 
Since the train is fully packed with passengers, there would be very many 
simultaneous handovers very frequently. Even if a mobile device is not in 
an active mode, it may still communicate its new location to the network 
once it changes a cell (i.e., tracking area update). The signaling load gener-
ated to the network can potentially be very large, and frequent cell changes 
will drain UE batteries much faster than from stationary devices (see Figure 
12.6).
Doppler frequency shift may also become a problem on high-speed 
trains. It will cause problems with the signal quality.
Train carriages are made of metal, which is not good for mobile phone 
signals. Even the carriage windows are typically reinforced with metal mesh 
in high-speed trains. That is, the signal penetration inside the train may be 
poor.
Tunnels present particular problems to wireless communication, and 
some mountainous countries such as Japan and Korea have lots of tunnels 
along their high-speed rail tracks. Tunnel entrances in particular are prob-
lematic since there the cell overlap area is small which means that there is 
very little time to perform a large number of handovers. Inside the tunnels 
normal macro eNBs are mostly useless if the train does not have outside 
antennas. This is because signal penetration losses with low incidence angles 
are very high, and in tunnels these angles would most of the time be close to 
zero. Radiating cables or remote radio units (RRUs) can be used inside tun-
nels to provide coverage, but the entrances of tunnels are still problematic.
While it is possible to alleviate these issues with careful network plan-
ning to continue using existing technologies in high-speed trains, there are 
now proposals to adopt mobile relays to solve the problems. Mobile relay is

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
a relay mounted on a vehicle and wirelessly connected to macro cells. It is 
likely to provide at least the following key functions: 
1.	 Wireless connectivity to end users inside the vehicle;
2.	 Wireless backhaul connection to the network outside the train;
3.	 Capability to perform group mobility functions;
4.	 Capability to allow different air interface technologies on the back-
haul and on the access link.
It must be noted that mobile relays are not yet specified for LTE-A. 
A feasibility study on mobile relays has been ongoing during Release 11, 
and the work may continue in Release 12. Several alternative solutions 
have been presented, the difference of which is mainly on which parts of 
the fixed relay architecture are modified in order to provide support for 
mobility.
The advantages of mobile relays are as follows:
•• Since the relay nodes (access points) are within the train/other vehicle, 
there are no handovers/tracking area updates when the train moves;
•• Signals do not suffer from high penetration losses;
•• No Doppler effect;
•• Reduced UE power consumption.
Instead of UE handovers and tracking area updates, the mobile relay 
itself will perform a handover/tracking area update (but these are transpar-
ent to UEs in the train). This procedure is also known as a group handover.
Since the UEs and relays nodes are in same carriages, there is no signal 
penetration loss, nor there is Doppler effect. All these issues will result in 
reduced UE power consumption.
And as always there are also disadvantages:
•• Increased cost;
•• Increased latency;
•• Standardization effort;
•• Unclear ownership of the mobile relay infrastructure.
Mobile relays will have a cost effect. The relay equipment itself may be 
cheap, but its deployment will cost serious money. Planning the deploy-
ment, modifying core network elements (depending on the chosen archi-
tecture), taking trains out of service for equipment installation, testing, and 
so on—it all adds up.

254 
 
Future Developments
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
Mobile relays will also increase latency when compared to nonrelay 
network scenarios. This is true for all relays, mobile or fixed. On the other 
hand, signal quality will be better and therefore in some scenarios the la-
tency experienced may in fact be smaller because protocols do not need to 
perform as many retransmissions when relays are used.
The standardization effort also has an effect. It will have a cost effect, 
and since all 3GPP standardization work is congested (for each release, there 
are many more work item proposals than can be accommodated), every 
new feature to be standardized will mean that some other feature will not 
be standardized.
It is also unclear who owns the mobile relay. Is it the mobile network 
operator or the train operator? If it is the train operator, does the train 
operator also need a mobile phone operator license? Should the same mo-
bile relay infrastructure support several mobile operators (network sharing)? 
These questions (and many others) are all issues that are not really technical 
but rather commercial or regulatory issues, but they still have to be solved 
or there will be no business case for mobile relays.
Mobile relays may support multi-RAT functionalities (i.e., an LTE-A 
Un may provide the backhaul link, while different air interface technolo-
gies, such as LTE/3G/2G/WiFi, may be supported on the access link).
As mentioned earlier, the problems described above can be solved or 
at least alleviated to a certain extend by existing methods such as direc-
tional macro cells or RRUs along the train line. Figure 12.7 shows a solu-
tion whereby directional macro cells are combined with carrier aggregation 
(though of course the carrier aggregation part can only be exploited by 
UEs that support carrier aggregation. Mobile relays would have the ad-
vantage that they are transparent to UEs (i.e., any old UE could attach to 
them). The carriers in freq 1 and freq 2 are configured to UE as component 
carriers. At any point, the UE can receive good SINR at least from one car-
rier. This solution increases the overlap area to the cell radius, and if cells are

directed then the cell radius can be very large. This method could decrease 
the handover failure rate considerably.
Another solution using existing techniques is to use RRUs as depicted 
in Figure 12.8. Different remote radio units (RRUs) share the same cell ID. 
The nearest RRU is chosen to serve the train without the need for han-
dovers. This scheme will enlarge the cell radius together with the overlap 
area. In fact, the whole train line could be defined as one logical cell. This 
method is already used in many underground systems; in a tunnel it is usu-
ally implemented using a radiating cable.
Mobile relays technical report can be found in [4].
12.2.4  Heterogeneous Networks
Heterogeneous networks (HetNets) are not a new invention as such, but 
HetNets are becoming very important in LTE-A and that is why they are 
discussed here. HetNets and related issues are mentioned in several places in 
this book, but here everything is tied together.
HetNets refer to a network deployment that consists of a mixture of 
macro, pico, and femto cells (i.e., cells of different sizes). HetNets typically 
provide layered coverage in which macro cells provide the wide-area cov-
erage and smaller cells provide the capacity in traffic hotspots (see Figure 
12.9). Therefore, these cell types are also known as coverage cells and capac-
ity cells.
Mobile data traffic is forecast to grow very rapidly. The current situation 
in which macro cells are the norm and small cells are added to a few loca-
tions will have to change fundamentally. The network capacity has to grow 
so rapidly that pico and femto cells have to be deployed on a large scale, and 
they will become the most common cell type.
Both macro and small cells are needed in an operational network. They 
fulfill different tasks and thus complement each other. Combining macro

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
and small cell deployments can be done in many different ways. The easiest 
way is to deploy both layers on their own frequency channels, thus avoid-
ing intercell interference. However, spectrum is very expensive and extra 
spectrum may not even be available. Even if an operator has two frequency 
bands in its use, assigning a whole layer to a macro cell can be considered 
(at least partly) waste of resources. Numerous small cells can provide more 
capacity per area than a few macro cells.
Carrier aggregation is a promising solution to HetNet deployment 
problems. As discussed in Section 11.4, a macro cell can form one com-
ponent carrier and a set of small cells another. The advantage over the old 
setup where we had two “independent” frequency carriers for macro and 
small cells is that a carrier aggregate-capable UE can swap between com-
ponent carriers at will, so there is no need to make frequency handovers.
One component carrier will act as a primary component carrier (PCC); 
others are secondary component carriers (SCC). The control information 
for all component carriers is sent via the PCC. This arrangement makes 
carrier aggregation even more attractive to HetNets since it enables the 
UE to read its control information from a macro cell and receive the user 
data from a small cell. Note that NTT DoCoMo has promoted similar idea 
under the label “Phantom Cell” [5].
Carrier aggregation in HetNets would also help to alleviate intercell 
interference problems that can be severe. If both the macro and small cells 
operate on the same frequency, then the macro cell may cause serious in-
terference problems to the small cells because typically a macro cell covers 
small cells completely. When carrier aggregation is used, then the compo-
nent carriers are on different frequencies, and there is no intercell interfer-
ence—at least not between different component carriers. However, there 
are several noncarrier aggregation interference cancellation mechanisms 
standarized as a result of ICIC, eICIC, and FeICIC work items. These are 
needed because not all UEs will be carrier aggregation-capable. Older Re-
lease 8 and Release 9 UEs will be around for a long time. Moreover, not

The Fifth Generation 
 
257
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
all HetNets support carrier aggregation. For example, HeNBs are deployed 
semi-independently from operators, and they will not be part of any carrier 
aggregation scheme.
Network energy saving is also important in HetNets. Because small 
cells are typically capacity cells, they will not be needed all the time. On 
low-traffic periods, some small cells could be switched off, at least if there 
is a coverage cell nearby making sure that there will not be coverage holes 
after switch-off. Because small cells are expected to be deployed in large 
numbers, efficient energy saving schemes would result in considerable sav-
ings. Such schemes are not yet standardized, but Release 12 may bring a 
change to that.
12.3  The Fifth Generation
12.3.1  Introduction
As discussed in the beginning of this book, a new generation in mobile 
communications technology has been launched about every 10 years so 
far. And there is no reason to believe that this trend would not continue in 
the future. This conclusion will thus let us expect the 5G to emerge around 
2020. Indeed, we have already heard news from Japan that there will be a 
5G system in use when the Olympic games are held in Tokyo in 2020. Japan 
is slightly ahead of other countries when it comes to adopting new mobile 
communication technologies so in that sense a promise of 5G is not very 
far-fetched.
However, there are no 5G standards available as of now—not even seri-
ous plans. Various telecommunication businesses are of course studying fu-
ture technologies as they always do, and in their long-term research they are 
certainly trying to forecast what is going to happen in 2020. But no inter-
national standardization body is preparing 5G specifications yet. And, most 
importantly, ITU has not defined what 5G means or what it should contain.
It is good to be cautions with the term 5G. It is becoming the new 
buzzword in mobile telecommunications, and if you want publicity and at-
tention to your new invention, the easiest way to get attention is to call it 
part of 5G. Therefore it is good to take the news about 5G with a pinch of 
salt, especially if they come from a less-known source.
In general, a new mobile telecommunications system must be able to 
provide more, better, and faster everything. For example, users want higher 
data rates and shorter latencies, and operators want more capacity, cheap-
er equipment, and easier-to-operate networks. The wish list for 5G could 
include:
•• More capacity;

258 
 
Future Developments
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
•• Higher user data rates (especially average data rates);
•• Shorter latencies.
Note that bullet points 1 and 2 do not mean the same. More capacity in 
the network may result in higher user data rates, but not necessarily. Adding 
more femtocells to a network will increase its capacity, but not necessarily 
the data rates a user is experiencing. There are lots of different methods to 
improve the performance of mobile networks, eventually leading to 5G. In 
this section, we will discuss a selection of them. In any case, the new 5G is 
not achieved only by improving one single issue. For example, upgrading 
the air interface access technology in 2020 will bring improvements in per-
formance, but this change will not be big enough so that the new system 
could provide performance and service expected from a 5G system. A 5G 
system will be a result of many large and small improvements, and together 
those improvements will hopefully provide a system that fulfills the expec-
tations for a 5G system.
The list of improvements that are needed for a 5G include at least the 
following ones:
•• New air interface;
•• More bandwidth;
•• Updated network architecture;
•• Widespread use of small cells;

12.3.2  New Air Interface
Generally speaking, the capacity bottleneck of a mobile telecommunica-
tions system is typically considered to be the air interface. The main goal 
behind the development of new air interface technologies has always been 
to provide more capacity. However, it is wrong to say that capacity can be 
increased only by adopting a new air interface technology. There are sev-
eral methods available for the network operator to increase the capacity. 
Which ones are chosen depend on the particular operator and the particular 
circumstances.
A new air interface technology can bring improvements to system 
capacity. The technology changes from TDMA to WCDMA to OFDMA 
have been leaps in terms of performance. The reason new technologies

have been adopted about every 10 years is mainly due to improvements in 
microprocessor technology. As Moore’s Law states, the number of transistors 
on integrated circuits doubles approximately every two years. One conse-
quence of this is that the chip performance doubles every 18 months. This 
may not sound a lot, but in 10 years the chip performance increases about 
hundredfold. Because of the much increased processing capability, the re-
ceivers can employ more complex receiver algorithms that were impractical 
in the past, and consequently new technologies can be adopted.
Recently there has been increased interest toward nonorthogonal mul-
tiple access (NOMA) schemes. LTE uses OFDMA, which is an orthogonal 
access scheme. In orthogonal access schemes the signals from/to different 
users are orthogonal to each other. The signals do not interfere because 
their cross-correlation is zero. Orthogonality can be achieved by TDMA, 
FDMA, or OFDMA access schemes. However, CDMA is a nonorthogonal 
access scheme, including the WCDMA scheme that is employed in UMTS. 
NOMA schemes rely on interference cancellation algorithms to sort out 
the correct signals. Such algorithms have already been used in base stations, 
but in 2020 it will be possible to employ them also in UEs.
The principal difference between orthogonal and nonorthogonal mul-
tiple access schemes is that in orthogonal schemes the channel resource is 
allocated exclusively to one user only at a time, whereas in nonorthogonal 
schemes this resource belongs to all active users. Therefore, nonorthogonal 
access schemes can have a higher overall capacity because the whole capac-
ity of the cell can be accessed by all users. In orthogonal schemes the capac-
ity is divided into small portions that are each allocated to one user only. 
If a UE cannot use the whole capacity that is allocated to it, the leftover 
capacity remains unused.
A NOMA scheme can also be used together with an orthogonal 
scheme. For example, a block of OFDMA subcarriers could be jointly al-
located to a group of users, but within that subcarrier block the channel 
resources are accessed using a NOMA scheme.
12.3.3  Bandwidth
More bandwidth equals more capacity. However, bandwidth is a very lim-
ited resource and in most markets it is therefore expensive to acquire. Radio 
regulators favor spectrum auctions in which the market can decide the price 
for the bandwidth. These prices tend to be high, and spectrum price may 
become an insurmountable obstacle for new operator candidates.
LTE-advanced can employ many different spectrum bandwidths—it 
is a truly scalable system. Currently (in Release 11) LTE-A air interface 
supports six different channel bandwidths, ranging from 1.4 MHz to 20 
MHz. Mobile devices can then use these channels in various combinations, 
depending on their capabilities and bandwidth requirements. With carrier

aggregation, it is possible, in theory, to use 100 MHz of LTE spectrum for 
one UE.
However, it is expected that the demand for mobile data capacity will 
increase a thousandfold by 2020. This kind of increase can only be accom-
modated with the help of several different improvements, one of them defi-
nitely being more bandwidth. 
It is difficult to find large junks of unused spectrum from the traditional 
bands used by mobile networks. So called digital dividend is the spectrum 
that was/is freed up after analog television broadcasting switched or switch-
es to digital transmission. Part of this spectrum will be available for mobile 
networks, but the problem is that analog TV spectrum was quite low-fre-
quency (usually VHF = 174 to 230 MHz  and UHF = 470 to 862 MHz), 
and therefore only a part of UHF can be considered for mobile broadband. 
And even though this spectrum is, in principle, very desirable for mobile use 
because low-frequency signals can penetrate obstacles such as walls and can 
be used in cells with large coverage, it is not very useful for 5G. In 5G one 
of the design principles is to deploy a large number of small cells to increase 
system capacity. Low frequencies are not good for this purpose because they 
easily carry signals too far, causing intercell interference. These frequencies 
can be useful for 3G and 4G networks, though.
Instead 5G systems could use spectrum from very high frequencies such 
as 10 GHz or even 20 GHz. The signal penetration is then poor and cell 
sizes are small, but this is actually desirable in 5G. Only with very small cells 
can the overall system capacity be increased enough.
High frequencies have also another desirable property: they make the 
design of large MIMO antenna installations easier. Efficient MIMO an-
tenna elements at the UE typically have to have an antenna separation of at 
least 0.5λ before acceptable spatial diversity can be achieved. Wavelength of 
course changes with the frequency as indicated by (12.1):
	
λ = c f 	
(12.1)
where c = the speed of light and f = frequency.
The minimum separation of MIMO antennas for selected frequencies 
is given in Table 12.2.
The results from Table 12.2 indicate that for under 1-GHz spectrum 
bands it is difficult to design a handset with MIMO capability. However, 
for over 2-GHz spectrum bands this is rather easy, and for 10- and 20-GHz 
bands it is possible to add a large number of MIMO antennas into even a 
small handheld device. At this point it is good to note that the half-wave-
length rule can possibly be circumvented in the future with new advanced 
antenna designs. Moreover, the high data rates requiring MIMO antennas 
are typically associated with large form factor devices such as laptops and 
tablets, and those can more easily accommodate MIMO antennas even in

relatively low frequencies. A small handheld smart phone, even if used for 
watching streaming video, does not consume as much bandwidth as a large 
laptop with a high-resolution display.
The World Radio Conference 15 (WRC-15) will be a very important 
occasion regarding future radio spectrum allocations, and therefore it will 
also have a big impact on 5G. WRCs are organized by ITU and historically 
they have been held every two to five years. The next WRC will be held 
in Geneva, 2-27.11.2015. Note that “15” in the conference name does not 
mean that this is the 15th WRC conference. Rather it refers to the con-
ference year. The previous WRC conference was WRC-12. Among other 
things, the WRC will decide which new radio frequencies can be used for 
future mobile broadband systems. Since so much is at stakes in this meeting, 
the preparation phase for it is very long. For example, for WRC-15 the first 
regional preparatory meetings were held already in 2012, more than three 
years before the actual conference.
12.3.4  Network Architecture
The new 5G system may also introduce something new for mobile network 
architecture. In 4G, the architecture was already greatly updated from 3G, 
with the new access network EUTRAN and the new core network EPC. 
But 5G faces new challenges. With the expected increase of data traffic and 
the demand for ever-shorter latencies, a new architectural upgrade will be 
necessary.
The most obvious solution to accommodate the expected increase in 
data traffic is to reduce cell sizes; add many more pico and femto cells, and 
increase the use of SIPTO-like mechanisms that can offload the traffic to 
fixed data networks as early as possible. More small cells covering a given 
area can handle more data than a few large macrocells. However, macro 
cells are also needed to provide large area coverage and also to handle fast-
moving UEs, which could cause severe problems in small cells with their 
frequent handovers. To make small cell deployments more effective, NTT

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
DoCoMo has proposed a mechanism called phantom cells [5] (see Figure 
12.10), whereby the C-plane for small cells is provided by the macro cell 
covering the area, and the small cells only transfer the U-plane data. The 
macro cell and small cells would operate on different frequency channels, 
and the macro cell would also take care of fast-moving UEs. This kind of 
arrangement also makes network energy saving easier: small cells are likely 
to have only a few UEs in them. If the network notices that the number of 
users gets very low, or there are no users at all in a given cell, it is easy to 
switch that cell off. The control signaling will be handled via the macro cell 
anyway. This is useful because UEs in a dormant small cell area are not in a 
coverage hole in this scenario. They can send their connection requests via 
the macro cell as normal and can be served via the macro cell user plane. If 
there are enough active UEs in an area, the network can switch the dormant 
small cell on. Therefore, it can be concluded that smaller cell sizes increase 
the granularity of the network topology and thus make it easier to switch 
off lightly loaded cells.
Shorter latencies are another “standard” requirement for every new 
mobile communications generation. It is also a difficult or at least an ex-
pensive requirement to fulfill because it typically requires changes to net-
work architecture. In LTE this requirement was handled, for example, by 
the flat RAN architecture. In 5G the already short latencies of 4G can be 
shortened by using fast backhaul technologies (e.g., optical cables) and using 
user plane data offloading whenever possible. That is, if it is not prevented 
for other reasons, the user plane data should be offloaded already from the 
local switch to the fixed data network.
12.3.5  Multiple Antennas
Multiple antenna techniques are known to improve the data throughput 
considerably. They are especially attractive in the sense that they do not 
require extra resources such as more bandwidth or more cell sites. Multiple 
antennas can be exploited in many ways, but possibly the most promising

Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
techniques with regard to 5G are MU-MIMO and beamforming. MU-
MIMO was already discussed in Chapter 11. 
Beamforming works better the more antennas there are at the transmit-
ter. In LTE (Release 11) the number of antennas is limited to eight. Increas-
ing this number is possible in future LTE specifications, but the problem 
is that in currently used LTE frequency bands, the physical size of MIMO 
antenna installations is getting large because of the required minimum an-
tenna separation. With the new expected high-frequency bands (3.5 GHz 
and up), it is possible to position the individual antenna elements very close 
to each other. This enables the use of several tens (or even hundreds) of 
antenna elements together. This kind of system is known as massive MIMO 
in many academic papers [6]. Massive MIMO antennas at the base station 
enable the use beamforming with very narrow beams. Because the beam 
energy will be concentrated on a small area, this reduces the interference 
caused to others and improves the signal quality near cell edges.
Indeed, beamforming as such is an old technique, but its usefulness was 
limited by the number of individual beams a base station could emit. With 
massive MIMO, it is possible to create individual beams for each user.
Still, it is good to recognize that massive MIMO is not yet ready in the 
sense that there are many problems to be solved before this scheme can be 
used in operational networks.
12.3.6  Support for M2M Communications
The number of human mobile network users is not growing anymore in 
mature markets (though their use of data services is growing rapidly). How-
ever, the number of devices that wish to communicate wirelessly is grow-
ing fast. This machine-to-machine (M2M) communication (also known as 
MTC) is very varying in nature; it can include various sensors, alarm sys-
tems, meter readings, vehicle-to-vehicle communications, and so on. Some 
of these devices already use mobile networks for their communications, but 
especially with low-power sensors the solutions so far have been proprietary. 
It would greatly improve the usability of these devices if they could com-
municate using standardized interfaces and protocols. They would also be 
cheaper and easier to deploy if their connectivity was provided by a stan-
dardized solution. Currently, a simple sensor may cost only a few dollars, but 
its deployment and testing may cost hundreds of dollars. A 5G-connnected 
sensor would ideally be a plug-and-play product.
The problem with connecting a machine such as a sensor into a mobile 
network is that the requirements for such a connection are often very dif-
ferent from the UE requirements. For example, a 5G UE will require very 
high data rates and low latency. It also has considerable processing power in 
its use, and its battery will be recharged regularly.

264 
 
Future Developments
Introduction to 4G Mobile Communications
On the other hand, a wireless sensor typically transmits only a very 
small amount of data and it does this very rarely. A sensor has only limited 
data-processing capabilities and even more limited power sources. Using the 
same mobile network to cater to the needs for both traditional UEs and tiny 
sensors will be difficult. Furthermore, M2M communication characteristics 
are very different by nature; it is not possible to define M2M communica-
tion as a single class and then define a solution for this class. For example, a 
humidity sensor in the garden and a networked car have completely differ-
ent communications needs.
In the future there will be a very large number of sensors or other 
M2M communication devices deployed. Even though the amount of data 
each device will transmit may be small and infrequent, it can be foreseen 
that those traffic bursts can be simultaneous and this may cause problems 
with network access. There will be lots of sensors deployed, many of them 
performing the same tasks. Therefore, once a triggering event happens, it 
may trigger the transmission of a signal from a large amount of sensors 
simultaneously. 
Due to the nature of M2M devices, the network access protocol has to 
be lightweight and require as little processing as possible at the device.
The challenges with M2M communication are difficult, but solving 
them would bring great benefits. And even if purely technical issues are 
solved, there is still the question of a suitable business case. How would 
a mobile operator benefit if its network is open for M2M devices? How 
would it charge the sensors for the use of the network? How would it check 
that the sensor accessing the network is legitimate? A SIM card and a full 
authentication protocol may be too heavy a solution for a cheap sensor, but 
is there an alternative? 
12.3.7  Other Improvements
Indeed, 5G should exploit all enhancements available to increase the perfor-
mance of the system. Every little thing helps to increase the system capabil-
ity, and the accumulated effect of even small individual improvements can be 
substantial. For example, the introduction of 256QAM modulation might 
help in some special cases, such as in indoor femtocells.
Finally, it must be stressed that having something made possible tech-
nology-wise is not enough if the new feature is not attractive business-wise. 
Most new features and enhancements mentioned here are clearly beneficial 
for a network operator, and therefore it is in operator’s interest to adopt 
them. However, there are also cases where the technical benefit is obvi-
ous, but it is not so obvious whether the entity making the investment will 
benefit. For example, a HeNB is technically a great invention and benefits 
the operator. But it should be acquired by a homeowner. Therefore, an op-
erator should plan its HeNB business case in a way that benefits all parties

involved. Similar cases will no doubt emerge also with M2M communica-
tions. The history of mobile telecommunications is full of great inventions 
that were never deployed. To be able to succeed, a technical solution needs 
also a credible business case to support it.
12.4  METIS Project
By now, the 5G wagon has definitely started to roll. In Europe, the EU is 
funding a large project called mobile and wireless communications enablers 
for the twenty-twenty information society (METIS). Its task is to study the 
future requirements for mobile communications and set the foundations 
for 5G. This project was launched in November 2012 [7], and it has already 
outlined the first set of requirements for 5G [8]:
•• Ten to 100 times higher typical user data rates, where in a dense urban 
environment the typical user data rates will range from 1 to 10 Gbps;
•• One thousand times more mobile data per area (per user) where the 
volume per area (per user) will be over 100 Gbps/km2 (resp. 500 GB/
user/month);
•• Ten to 100 times more connected devices;
•• Ten times longer battery life for low-power massive machine commu-
nications where machines such as sensors or pagers will have a battery 
life of a decade;
•• Support of ultrafast application response times (e.g., for tactile Inter-
net) where the end-to-end latency will be less than 5 ms with high 
reliability;
•• A key challenge will be to fulfill the previous requirements under a 
similar cost and energy dissipation per area as in today’s cellular systems.
METIS must be taken seriously because it has an impressive list of 
members, which includes equipment manufacturers, telecommunications 
operators, and academia.

So far (October 2013), METIS has published six deliverables on its 
website [9]. In addition to top-level system requirements for 5G, it has 
also published an interesting initial review of radio spectrum that could be

available for 5G and its suitability for the task. A very wide radio spectrum 
area was assessed, from 380 MHz to 275 GHz. When looking for new spec-
trum bands, METIS set a minimum requirement that it should be possible 
to identify continuous spectrum of several hundred megahertz below 40.5 
GHz and at least 1 GHz above 40.5 GHz.
The radio frequencies below 5925 MHz were not discussed in depth in 
the initial study because those frequencies will be considered in the WRC-
15 preparation process. In any case, that spectrum is already heavily used 
and it will be difficult to allocate large bandwidths for 5G usage from this 
frequency band.
Table 12.3 contains the spectrum bands that were identified as potential 
bands for 5G [10].
The deadline for the current METIS project is in the end of April 2015. 
However, it is quite clear that there will be a continuation project of some 
form building on the results of this project. Also, most probably the results 
from METIS and its followup projects will be fed into future 3GPP LTE-
A releases via company contributions (note that all nonacademic METIS 
members are also 3GPP member companies).

About the Author
Juha Korhonen was born in Suonenjoki, Finland. He holds two university 
degrees in telecommunications from Lappeenranta University of Technol-
ogy, Finland, and a Ph.D. from Cambridge University, UK.
He joined the Nokia Research Center in Espoo near Helsinki in 1988. 
At that time, his work involved the development of protocol software testers 
and tools. From 1993 to 1995, he worked as a design engineer at Nokia 
Mobile Phones, Camberley, UK, developing JDC mobile phones for the 
Japanese market. In 1995, he returned to Nokia Research Center, this time 
to work on advanced DECT research. During 1996 and 1997 he was the 
leader of the protocol stack team that developed the WCDMA prototype 
network.
In 1997 he moved to Cambridge, UK, to join TTPCom, Ltd. He was 
first involved in a satellite phone development program, and after 1999 he 
worked in various research projects related to 3G technologies. Between 
2006 and 2009 he worked as an independent telecoms consultant.
In 2009 he joined the European Telecommunications Standards Insti-
tute in Sophia Antipolis, France, where he works as a project manager for 
3GPP projects; currently, he is responsible for the 3GPP RAN3 working 
group.
He lives in the little village of Saint Cézaire in Southern France with 
his wife, Akiko, and baby daughter, Koyuki.
