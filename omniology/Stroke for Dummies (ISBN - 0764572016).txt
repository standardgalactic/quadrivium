Author’s Acknowledgments
This book could not have been produced without the help of Corbin Collins,
editor, and Betsy Sheldon, writer, who took me step by step from rough draft
to finished product. I thank them for their insights and suggestions. Likewise,
Kathryn Born’s illustrations are remarkable for their clarity and precision. I
couldn’t respect any stroke clinician any more than I do the technical editor,
J. Donald Easton, MD. His comments have added greatly to this book. I want
to thank Sandra Sewell, RN, at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda, Maryland, who
helped me understand many of the difficulties faced by stroke patients and
their families after hospitalization. Mary Dombovy, MD, MHSA, Unity Health
System in Rochester, New York, took the time to talk with me about the basic
approach to stroke recovery and rehabilitation. Jeffrey Saver, MD, at the
UCLA Stroke Center, along with his colleagues David S. Liebeskind, MD and
Reza Jahan, MD, provided the CT and MR images for the figures in the book.
And last but far from least, there is Kathy Cox at Wiley whose dare got me to
start this project in the first place and whose patience and encouragement
motivated me to finish. Thank you all.

Introduction
W
elcome to Stroke For Dummies.
In a nutshell: Stroke is the often severely damaging result of a sudden inter-
ruption of blood to part of the brain, whether due to a blockage or bleeding.
Stroke’s impact on the brain can be catastrophic, causing paralysis, loss of
speech, loss of memory, and, of course, death in as many as 30 percent of
those who experience stroke.
Stroke is serious stuff. If you have one, you want to get to the emergency
room as fast as possible and begin treatment. If you survive one, you want to
recover as fully as possible and do everything in your power to never have
one again. Helping you achieve these things is what this book is about.
About This Book
This book is full of useful information to help you understand the who-what-
where-when-why-and-how of stroke. Information is critical in helping you get
the most out of stroke treatment, recovery, and adjustment to life after stroke.
And, most importantly, information is essential in helping you prevent future
stroke. But it’s worthless if it’s so technical you can’t understand it. That’s
why I wrote this book.
Stroke For Dummies explains stroke in a simple, straightforward manner, 
guiding you through a complex field of knowledge with a minimum of techni-
cal vocabulary and a maximum of fundamental facts needed to understand
this medical condition and take action. The difficult issues are presented
unflinchingly — I don’t soft-pedal the cold, hard facts. Stroke is scary. The
better you understand that, the more fervently you’ll pursue a focused and
effective course of prevention.
Stroke For Dummies offers well-tested, clinically proven courses of action for
treatment and prevention of stroke. I spend my life trying to find out which
treatments for stroke and other brain diseases really work. You can count on
the fact that every treatment mentioned in this book is proven, unless I state
otherwise.
Still, every treatment plan poses risks, and doctors don’t agree on every-
thing. Your doctor may not agree that certain treatments described in this

book will work for you. This is to be expected and doesn’t mean that either
one of us is wrong. The point here is to gather as much good information as
possible to help you make the best choices for you.
Stroke For Dummies is not a do-it-yourself book — I do not recommend any
specific treatment plan but, instead, offer general information for you to dis-
cuss with your physician. Each individual is unique and must develop a cus-
tomized approach to stroke in partnership with an experienced doctor. This
book gives you the basic knowledge you need to be an effective partner in
that relationship.
Conventions Used in This Book
The following conventions are used throughout the text to make things con-
sistent and easy to understand:
 New terms appear in italics and are closely followed by an easy-to-
understand definition.
 Bold is used to highlight the action parts of numbered steps or key-
words in bulleted lists.
 Sidebars, which are enclosed in a shaded gray box, include information
that may intrigue you but isn’t critical to your understanding of stroke.
 Case studies, set off like sidebars but with a “Case Study” icon, present
summarized accounts of fairly typical stroke victims.
What You’re Not to Read
You can safely skip the case studies in this book and still understand the
topic at hand. The case studies are merely meant to illustrate and dramatize
some aspect of stroke or stroke prevention or care. Some may find them help-
ful, but they are not essential to understanding the basics of stroke as dis-
cussed here.
Likewise, if you came to this book to understand a particular type of stroke
that you or a loved one has had, don’t waste time boning up on the other
kinds of stroke described in Part II. Many aspects of stroke and its accompany-
ing events and treatments are time sensitive. This book is designed to make it
as easy as possible to get in and get out with as much specific and easy-to-
digest information as you need depending on your particular circumstances.
2
Stroke For Dummies 

Finally, the “Jargon Alert” icon may warn you of impending Latin tongue-
twisters, but in many cases you will have to grit your teeth and read the
material in the indicated paragraphs in order to get a full understanding of
the discussion. Due to the nature of the topic of stroke, some technical terms
are unavoidable, and if stroke has touched your life or that of a loved one,
you will be glad to have absorbed a few of these when it comes time to dis-
cuss the stroke and possible treatments.
Foolish Assumptions
It’s unlikely that someone would pick up a book like this at random. Here is
what I assume about you — that you fall into one of three categories:
 You’ve recently suffered a stroke and are now on the road to recovery.
Perhaps you’re re-learning to walk. Or talk. Or button your shirt. You
seek an easy-to-understand resource that can shed light on your new 
circumstances.
 You are a spouse or family member of a stroke survivor who wants to
learn as much as possible so you can be a better caregiver.
 You returned recently from a visit to your doctor and learned that your
high blood pressure, high LDL blood cholesterol, and extra weight put
you on a path toward something called stroke and you want to learn
more about it.
Or maybe you picked up this book by mistake because you thought it had
something to do with golf. In that case, I can’t help you.
In any event, now that I have your attention, I hope to persuade you to con-
tinue reading. Stroke is the number three cause of death in the United States.
This book could very well save your life — or the life of a loved one. At the
very least, Stroke For Dummies can enlighten you about the recovery and
treatment process and help you avoid future strokes.
How This Book Is Organized
Stroke For Dummies is organized into six parts. The chapters within each part
cover specific topic areas in detail. Because I’ve structured the book this way,
you can easily find the topic you’re looking for. Check out the Table of
Contents or the Index for your general area of interest and then find the chap-
ter that concerns your particular needs.

Introduction

Part I: The Brain and Stroke
I begin with some rudimentary background on stroke and how and why it
happens. The basic principles of stroke are quite simple, but often get
obscured by the terminology used by doctors to describe it. I’ve tried to 
simplify the explanations so that you can understand what you are told by 
or what you may overhear from your medical team. I begin in Chapter 1 by
describing exactly what happens when you have a stroke. In Chapter 2, I offer
a basic biology lesson in the workings of your brain and what happens when
things go wrong.
Part II: Types of Stroke
For simplicity, I break stroke down into five types, stemming from two major
causes. The most common cause of stroke is a blood clot blocking an artery
to or inside the brain — I call these white strokes because they involve a lack
of blood. The other cause is bleeding inside the skull, either inside or outside
of the brain — I call these red strokes.
Chapters 3, 4, and 7 cover different types of white strokes, and Chapters 5
and 6 deal with the two kinds of red strokes. It’s important to know which
type of stroke one is dealing with, because treatment is different for each. For
each type, I present the causes, what actually occurs during it, symptoms,
risks, how to treat — and how to prevent.
Bear in mind that my “red” and “white” distinction is my own invention. I
believe it helps to visualize what is happening in the brain. Of course, I also
give you all types of technical terms for each type of stroke and explain them
as clearly as I can.
Part III: Preventing Stroke
Three chapters are devoted to ways of reducing risk of stroke in the 
future — whether you’ve already suffered a stroke or want to maintain 
your stroke-free record.
Chapter 8 in this part deals with blood pressure, the major risk factor for
stroke. I explain how high blood pressure beats down the blood vessels, lead-
ing the way for damage and blood clots. Even more importantly, I give you
steps you can take to lower your blood pressure.
Chapter 9 addresses another key risk factor for both stroke and heart dis-
ease: cholesterol. I discuss the differences between bad cholesterol and good
4
Stroke For Dummies 

cholesterol — and how you can change your diet and take action to control
your blood cholesterol levels and reduce stroke risk.
Finally, Chapter 10 rounds up other prevention steps that you can take to
reduce your chances of having a stroke — or another stroke.
Part IV: Treating Stroke
This part focuses on the critical steps required for treating stroke. Chapter 11
is perhaps the most essential — responding fast when stroke occurs. Call 911:
Stroke is an emergency! The faster you get to the hospital, the more brain you
can save. I walk you through the emergency response process, including
which actions and procedures are likely to be done. I also offer important
advice to the stroke victim and family members — that will help ensure the
best care. Chapter 12 deals with the hospital stay and what to expect in
terms of care and follow-up testing. And Chapter 13 addresses the rehabilita-
tion process, giving you a sense of what to expect as you make your way
along the path toward recovery.
Part V: Living with Stroke
Life after stroke can be daunting for the stroke survivor and family members.
It’s a culture shock of sorts that involves learning a “language” of adjustment
to new limitations and challenges. You will likely have to make changes to
familiar routines and, perhaps, compromises to future plans.
Chapters 14 through 17 help you face the changes brought on by stroke,
including returning home from the hospital, considering residential place-
ment, confronting the cost implications, wrestling with family dynamics,
returning to normal life, and confronting end-of-life issues.
You’ll pick up on a recurring theme in this section: the importance of asking
for help — whether you are the stroke survivor who must give up driving or a
caregiver spouse who needs a support group. Asking for help is often difficult,
but failing to do so causes a lot of unnecessary pain and impedes recovery.
Part VI: The Part of Tens
In these short and sweet chapters, I offer helpful information that I hope will
enhance your understanding of the consequences of stroke and motivate you
to do your part to take care of yourself — and others.
5
Introduction

Chapter 18 offers ideas for helping your community manage stroke. I especially
like Chapter 19, about the notable personalities who’ve contributed to the
world — despite their history of stroke. From presidents to beauty queens,
from authors to actors, stroke survivors have proven that productive life isn’t
over with the onset of stroke. Chapter 20 lists concrete steps you can take to
improve your personal stroke care and prevent stroke. The last chapter is a
glossary of terms — anytime you feel confused or unsure about a technical
term, check the glossary for a quick definition.
Icons Used in This Book
Icons are handy little graphic images meant to point out particularly impor-
tant information about stroke. You’ll find the following icons in this book,
conveniently located along the left margins.
This icon points out stroke stories that illustrate a point and help you recog-
nize stroke issues in yourself and others. They are technically fictional and
don’t identify any single patient, but they are based on typical stroke events.
They are similar to stories doctors hear over and over as they see the hun-
dreds of stroke patients that come to their hospitals every year.
This icon alerts you to a paragraph that contains new medical terms in case
you’re severely allergic to them. The terms will be defined, so don’t get too
stressed out about it.
Remember these important points of information, if nothing else. In fact, if
you’ve had a stroke, or even if you haven’t, it’s probably a good idea to write
them down to put them on the refrigerator or bathroom mirror.
This icon directs you to helpful hints or practical advice for taking care of or
preventing stroke.
Everything you do to treat, prevent, or recover from stroke may have side
effects or complications. Stroke is a very serious disease and surgery and
powerful drugs are warranted in many situations. You need to be aware that
there can be problems.
Where to Go from Here
Where you go from here depends on why you are reading the book. You can
read it cover to cover or look up specific topics of interest in the Table of
Contents or Index.
6
Stroke For Dummies 

Part I is written for everyone — stroke victims, family members, and any 
individual committed to protecting good health. It offers a basic understand-
ing of stroke.
In Part II, you may only want to read about the particular type of stroke that
is of most immediate concern or interest to you.
Part III is for the whole world. Preventing stroke isn’t that hard, especially
considering the payoff. And preventing another stroke may be absolutely
paramount.
If you or a loved one is in the hospital or rehabilitation unit, Part IV is for you.
Part V is for patients, caretakers, and family members struggling with the
realities of life after stroke.
Part VI also has something for everyone — particularly the Glossary, which
you may find yourself flipping to repeatedly.
If you are a stroke survivor, it is my hope that you will be inspired to maxi-
mize your rehabilitation efforts and make the most of your life after stroke. If
you are a caregiver, I hope you will increase your understanding of stroke and
do what you can to partner in your loved one’s adjustment. If you are an indi-
vidual concerned with preventing stroke, I hope you will make lifestyle
changes to reduce your chances of stroke.
And for all readers, I hope that, armed with knowledge bound in this book,
you will move forward with a greater appreciation for your brain — its power
and its delicacy — and do everything within your capacity to protect it.

Part I
The Brain 
and Stroke

In this part . . .
W
hat is stroke, what does it do to the brain — and
how and why does it do this? These are a few of
the questions I tackle in this part. I begin in Chapter 1 by
describing the process and mechanisms of the different
kinds of stroke. Chapter 2 covers the basics of how the
brain does what it does and how stroke disrupts its nat-
ural workings.

Chapter 1
A Brain Attack
In This Chapter
 Taking a sudden hit from stroke
 Targeting the different types of stroke and their causes
 Profiling the likeliest stroke victims
 Responding to stroke for the best outcome
 Coping and adjusting to life after stroke
L
et me hit you with the bad news first: Stroke kills, stroke destroys, stroke
debilitates. Stroke is the third most common cause of death in the United
States, and the number-one cause of serious disability. One year after the
most common kind of stroke, approximately 30 percent of those afflicted will
have died, and another 30 percent will have a moderate to severe disability.
Now for some good news: Of those who experience the most common type of
stroke, approximately 40 percent are left with only a mild or no disability one
year later. And each year more people survive and recover from stroke as
medical research continues to advance effective treatment. Today, recovery
with improvement is the rule rather than the exception.
Stroke is sometimes called a brain attack. I wish this label would catch 
on, because I think that people might then understand that stroke is an 
emergency — like a heart attack — and call 911 right away! A heart attack
threatens your heart; a stroke threatens your brain. In truth, most stroke is
like a heart attack: It’s a problem with blood vessels, and time is really impor-
tant. However, heart attack is a little easier to recognize. First of all, the pain
tells you something is wrong — and it is usually near your heart. Most strokes
are painless, and the symptoms, a paralyzed arm or leg for instance, are not
obviously related to the brain.
Clearly, the more you know about stroke — its symptoms, causes, risks, treat-
ment, and prevention — the better your chances of living a full and productive
life with or, better yet, without stroke. And the first lesson is to learn what
stroke is and how and why stroke occurs.

If you’ve already had a stroke, there are many opportunities to reduce the
disability that stroke causes and prevent another stroke attack. A serious
stroke will affect your entire family. You can fight back together.
Attacking Out of the Blue
Stroke is nothing if not fast. Each year, as many as 750,000 people in the
United States suffer a sudden and unexpected attack of the brain. When part
of the brain is deprived of oxygen — which is what is happening when stroke
hits — it doesn’t take long for the catastrophe to make itself evident. A
minute or less.
Whether it’s a sudden inability to speak, the crash of a dish from a hand that
can no longer grasp, or loss of consciousness, a brain attack strikes its vic-
tims quickly and powerfully and without warning.
12
Part I: The Brain and Stroke 
Real-life examples
A 57-year-old man arrives early at work to pre-
pare for an important presentation he has to
make at 10 a.m. At about 9:15 he notices a
headache. He thinks this is unusual, because he
doesn’t have many headaches. He remembers
that he did forget his blood pressure medica-
tion. He continues to work for a few minutes and
then notices his right hand is not working and
he can’t concentrate. He calls for his assistant
who finds him looking very unusual. His mouth is
twisted. He starts to talk but his speech is diffi-
cult to understand. She asks if he is okay. He
says no. He starts to get up but his right arm
gives way and he almost falls. His assistant
calls 911.
A 68-year-old woman is preparing breakfast for
herself and her husband. He has made the
coffee and is reading the newspaper. He hears
her drop a plate and looks up to see her stand-
ing and looking at her left hand. He asks her
what’s wrong. She says she doesn’t know. Her
face — particularly the way she is holding her
mouth — looks unusual. She keeps looking at
her hand. “My hand is numb,” she says. He asks
her to sit down. She seems confused as he
leads her to a chair. He asks if it hurts. She says
no. “I think you’re having a stroke,” he says. He
dials 911.
A 38-year-old lawyer is out jogging on a canal
towpath. She starts to feel pain in her head that
gets worse and worse. She stops, puts her hand
to her head, and falls to the ground. A man walk-
ing ahead of her sees her fall. He runs to her but
she is unconscious. He pulls out his cellphone
and dials 911.

Or does it? Although your stroke may occur in a lightning flash, it has most
likely been years in the making, with conditions such as high blood pressure,
high cholesterol, obesity, and diabetes possibly serving as warning signs that
the brain is in danger. Basically, as these conditions cause wear and tear on
your blood vessels, your risks increase of suffering either a blockage or rup-
ture of a brain artery. And — suddenly — you’re in stroke mode.
So how does it happen? It starts with the brain.
Going to the source: Stroke is in the brain
Because of a number of possible causes — which I explain in detail in this
book — part of your brain may be deprived of blood. When that happens, it
doesn’t take long for your brain to suffer. In a nutshell, the glucose and oxygen
transported by one of the brain’s arteries are not reaching some part of the
brain, which in less than a minute will begin to shut down. And you will show
signs of stroke.
The 50 professional groups forming the Brain Attack Coalition describe the
signs of stroke as follows:
 Sudden numbness or weakness of face, arm, or leg, especially on one
side of the body
 Sudden confusion, trouble speaking or understanding speech
 Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
 Sudden trouble walking, dizziness, loss of balance or coordination
 Sudden severe headache with no known cause
Most of the time, a stroke victim feels no pain as the stroke is occurring — 
so there is not much evidence to clue you in that the reason your hand looks
funny and doesn’t move when you want is because there’s something wrong
in your head.
Most people who have a stroke don’t know what is happening to them. Most
people who see someone who’s had a stroke don’t know what is happening.
A stroke doesn’t hurt (except if a headache accompanies it), and its most
obvious effects are far from the brain where the problem is located. This
means a lot of people don’t recognize they are having a stroke and can’t use
the opportunities they have to get into the hospital quickly and be treated.
13
Chapter 1: A Brain Attack

Damage in your brain, 
symptoms someplace else
So, why is it that a blocked artery in your brain causes you to lose control of
your legs and fall to the floor? Suppose a small blood clot forms in your heart
and flows with the blood up into your brain and plugs an artery that feeds a
part of your brain near the top of your head. Normally, that part of the brain
sends nerve impulses down threadlike fibers through the base of your brain
and along your spinal cord down to a point a couple of inches below your
lowest rib. There those nerve fibers connect to other nerve fibers that extend
down to muscles in your legs.
But without blood flow, the affected part of the brain stops sending mes-
sages. Your leg muscles only work when they receive messages, so they stop
working. But the other parts of your brain that are getting oxygen and glu-
cose don’t understand that the whole team’s not on board and look at the leg
in confusion, trying to comprehend why it’s not cooperating, not realizing
that the problem is right upstairs.
The brain is sensitive to the slightest touch of your skin, but completely
insensitive to serious injury to itself. As remarkable as it may seem, the brain
is very poor at recognizing when it has been injured. This makes it hard for
you to figure out what is going on when you have a stroke.
Responding quickly: Time is brain
Your brain is completely unprepared when blood flow is cut off. The organ is
so packed full of knowledge and memories that there is no room in the design
for storing sugars and fats that could keep brain cells alive in hard times
when blood stops flowing.
Most other cells in the body can survive for up to an hour without blood flow.
The brain cells stop working in a matter of seconds and start dying after 
five minutes.
The brain counts on the heart to do its job. That’s why when you have a heart
attack it is so important to get the heart restarted quickly. Within seconds
after your heart stops, your brain stops working. Within minutes of the heart
stopping, the brain is permanently injured and can’t recover even if the heart
gets going again.
In stroke, you have a little more time than in a heart attack. Because the heart
keeps pumping, some blood can often get around the obstruction or broken
portion of the blood vessels, or seep in from areas of the brain that are still
getting blood. But get yourself to a hospital right away. Call 911. If you are going
to get the best treatment, you need to get to a hospital within 60 minutes.
14
Part I: The Brain and Stroke 

Recognizing Types of Stroke: Same
Symptoms, Different Causes
Doctors can typically identify stroke when a patient comes in with symptoms —
they’re even pretty good at knowing what part of your brain may be damaged
by the stroke just by looking at you. With some scenarios, such as a bursting
aneurysm, a doctor can guess what caused the stroke. With other cases, it is
almost impossible to tell what caused the stroke, although there is little doubt
that a stroke is in progress.
Sometimes, with severe headache, for example, it’s hard to tell whether a
stroke is happening at all because the symptoms are similar to those of a
migraine headache. A stroke might cause dizziness that is difficult to distin-
guish from an inner-ear infection.
Fortunately, testing instruments such as CT or MRI scans can indicate if there
is a stroke and what its cause might be.
Red or white: Color-coding stroke types
A friend of mine, a cardiologist, once told me that neurologists make stroke too
complicated with their jargon and classification. He said he just thinks of stroke
like wine: There’s red wine and white wine — and red stroke and white stroke.
What did he mean by this? Basically, some strokes are caused by broken
blood vessels — which results in blood in the brain or brain area (thus, the
red); other strokes are caused by the blockage of vessels to the brain, so no
blood gets there (hence, white).
I liked his use of the color-coding and have found that when I talk to patients
and their families, this explanation helps them better understand the cause of
the stroke and what is happening in the brain. So throughout this book, you’ll
see that I classify the five major types of stroke into two general categories
based on whether they are caused by bleeding (red) or blockage (white).
Oh, don’t worry — I promise to give you the complex, hard-to-pronounce ter-
minology, as well! Throughout the book, you will find the most commonly
accepted medical terms for the types of stroke.
If you’re ready now to track it down in a medical textbook, you’ll find out
more about red stroke under the term hemorrhagic stroke or intracerebral
hemorrhage. White stroke is covered under the term ischemic stroke, embolic
stroke, or thrombotic stroke.
15
Chapter 1: A Brain Attack

Understanding white stroke
As you age, your blood pressure, diet, and the ravages of time roughen the
fragile lining of your blood vessels and heart.
Your blood-vessel lining is like the coating on your best cookware — it keeps
your blood from sticking and clotting. However, as you approach senior
status, that Teflon-like protection starts breaking down, and your vessels
develop spots where blood and other buildup stick to them.
Blood clots block blood to the brain
The most common sign of blood-vessel damage is atherosclerosis, also known
as hardening of the arteries, the condition in which a rough, scarred area called
a plaque forms because of high blood pressure and high fat content in your
blood. (There is more about atherosclerosis in the Glossary and in Chapter 9.)
The roughness makes it more likely that blood inside your arteries will form
clots that can block arteries in the brain or break up into smaller pieces that
are carried downstream to lodge in small brain arteries. Sometimes blood
16
Part I: The Brain and Stroke 
A stroke by any other name
Stroke means that part of your brain has sud-
denly stopped working because of a problem
with its blood supply. It may help to think of
strokes caused by blockage as white strokes;
they’re most typically referred to as ischemic
strokes by doctors. But here are some other
names for this type of stroke:
occlusive stroke
cerebrovascular accident (CVA)
acute ischemic stroke
atherothrombotic stroke
embolic stroke
small vessel stroke
lacunar stroke
large vessel stroke
cardioembolic stroke
Ischemic stroke and CVA are probably the most
common terms used. Doctors usually know
what all these terms mean and use them each in
different situations to mean virtually the same
thing. “Little white stroke” and “big white
stroke” could probably replace all these fine
technical terms just as well, and everyone
would know exactly what they meant.
I refer to strokes caused by bleeding in or
around the brain as red strokes. Names for
these types of stroke are equally varied:
subarachnoid hemorrhage (SAH)
intracranial hemorrhage
intracerebral hemorrhage (ICH)
brain bleeding
brain hemorrhage

clots can break off and flow downstream to form a blockage somewhere else,
called an embolism (see Figure 1-1 for illustrations of atherosclerosis, blood
clots, and embolism).
If the clot blocks blood to a part of your brain, you have a stroke. If the clot
stays in place for even a short time, part of your brain dies, leaving a hole
called a brain infarction. The affected area of brain turns from pink to white
because there is no red blood flowing (another good reason to refer to this
type of stroke as white).
Dissection: Blood vessel lining splits
White ischemic strokes are also caused by dissection. No, this doesn’t mean
somebody is practicing brain surgery on you. Dissection refers to the splitting
of the blood vessel lining, typically occurring at a place where the blood
vessel bends back and forth, such as in your neck. It can also happen where
atherosclerotic plaque has built up in a brain artery. At the bend point or at the
rough surface of atherosclerosis, a little flap of the vessel lining peels off and
catches the blood as it flows quickly past. The blood dives under the flap and
keeps tearing it. Eventually the blood can pack the lining against the other
side of the vessel and stop blood flow completely. When the blood stops flow-
ing, a white stroke occurs. Figure 1-2 shows how dissection causes stroke.

Chapter 1: A Brain Attack

Transient strokes: Just as serious
White ischemic strokes may last just a couple of minutes and then clear com-
pletely. If the blood clot breaks up right away, the stroke is transient — so
fleeting that no permanent tissue death occurred. These transient strokes are
officially called transient ischemic attacks. Try to say that ten times fast.
Doctors abbreviate it as TIA.
I don’t like the term TIA or what it stands for because it doesn’t tell you
plainly that you had a stroke. A stroke is very serious even if it is transient,
and you still need to consider it a medical emergency requiring a rapid
response. After a TIA stroke, your next stroke may not be transient and you
need to get busy to prevent it from happening. It could happen tomorrow.
You can have more than one transient ischemic stroke. As the number of
these small strokes add up, your brain can just slow down generally, and 
you can suffer from dementia, as each small stroke erodes away more of 
your brain. Small white ischemic stroke dementia is often called vascular
dementia or vascular cognitive impairment. This is the death of the brain 
by a thousand cuts.

Getting a handle on red stroke
Blood vessels can break and bleed into or around the brain, causing some of
the most serious and deadly strokes. These type of strokes may result in sim-
ilar symptoms to white stokes — although some are unique to red stroke —
but in many cases, they should be treated differently.
Bleeding within the brain
A stroke caused by a blood vessel that breaks inside the substance of the
brain is called intracerebral hemorrhage, brain hemorrhage, or brain bleeding.
The brain goes from pink to red. Hence, the term red stroke. The vessels that
bleed are often damaged extensively by high blood pressure or diabetes
(Figure 1-3). The blood vessels have thick, fibrous, but weak walls. They form
little blebs — bubble-like growths — from time to time. These brain vessels
are very prone to break, especially when blood pressure is high.

Chapter 1: A Brain Attack

Bleeding around the brain
Sometimes red — or hemorrhagic — strokes are caused by bleeding just out-
side the brain, but still inside the skull (Figure 1-4). This type of red stroke is
known as subarachnoid hemorrhage. The most common cause in this case is a
little peanut or marble-sized bubble or pouch that forms at a Y-junction in a
brain-bound artery. This bubble is called an aneurysm. It has tough, thin, rub-
bery walls and may actually be present for years before it starts causing trou-
ble. Some never do cause trouble. But aneurysms may get larger as time
passes and, as they do, doctors believe they are more likely to burst.
The result can be devastating as high-pressure blood from larger brain arter-
ies floods into the space around the brain. If you aren’t killed immediately,
you have to survive weeks of recovery as your body tries to clean up the
resulting mess. Further injury to your brain and rebleeding are likely, unless
you get immediate medical attention.
This type of red subarachnoid hemorrhage stroke is usually accompanied by
severe headache. Many people also fall down unconscious when the stroke
first hits. The pain and loss of consciousness are both strong warnings that
something serious is happening.

Part I: The Brain and Stroke 

When red and white stroke occur together
White ischemic strokes can turn red if a blood vessel is injured and breaks in
the area where lack of blood flow caused a brain infarction. The bleeding can
become a major intracranial hemorrhage or it may just be a small leak that
doesn’t do much more damage than has already been done by the ischemia.
In a stroke that starts out as subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by an
aneurysm, white ischemic strokes can occur 4 to 14 days after the aneurysm
bursts. This is a time when the blood around the brain irritates the brain’s
blood vessels and they clamp shut. Blood flow stops and ischemic stroke can
result. This is of course bad news for someone who has just started to
recover from the bleeding.
Five stroke scenarios
Blood clots and bleeding aren’t the only causes of stroke — but about 99 per-
cent of strokes can be attributed to one of these reasons. In this book, I’ve
identified the five most common stroke scenarios and dedicate a full chapter
to each type:
White strokes
 Ischemic stroke, caused by a blood clot (Chapter 3)
 Transient ischemic stroke (TIA), also caused by a blood clot (Chapter 4)
 Multiple small ischemic strokes causing dementia or vascular cognitive
impairment (Chapter 7)
Red strokes
 Intracerebral hemorrhage caused by bleeding in the brain (Chapter 5)
 Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by rupture of an aneurysm and bleed-
ing around the outside of the brain (Chapter 6)
Assessing Stroke Risk
If you’ve suffered a stroke, let me assure you of one thing: You are not alone.
In the United States, 750,000 people experience a stroke each year. Of these
three-quarters of a million strokes, here’s how they break down in our red
and white categories:
21
Chapter 1: A Brain Attack

 Eighty percent are white ischemic strokes, including TIA and dementia.
 Fifteen percent are red intracerebral hemorrhages.
 Five percent are red subarachnoid hemorrhages.
Survival rates by type of stroke vary greatly. Clearly, your chances of survival
are much better with a white stroke than a red subarachnoid hemorrhage:
 80–90 percent survival rate of ischemic stroke
 60–70 percent survival rate of intracerebral hemorrhage
 40–50 percent survival rate of subarachnoid hemorrhage
Taking steps to prevent stroke
Fact is, neither you nor I nor your doctor knows for certain whether a stroke
is in your future. It’s not really possible to predict with any certainty exactly
who will suffer a stroke. To some extent, having a stroke is a matter of bad luck.
But we do know that certain characteristics place you at a greater risk for
stroke. We know that you are more prone to this particular form of bad luck if
you have high blood pressure, smoke cigarettes, and/or have heart disease,
diabetes, or high blood cholesterol levels. Researchers have identified a
number of indicators that can help predict the likelihood of stroke. Some you
can influence; others you can’t.
Risk factors beyond your control
Unfortunately, you may be carrying some genetic, hereditary, gender, or age
baggage that you simply can’t change, such as:
 You’ve already had a stroke.
 You are 65 or older.
 You are African American.
 You are Hispanic.
 Stroke runs in your family.
 You are a man.
 You have diabetes.
Risk factors you can control
So you can’t change your age (don’t we all wish we could?), your sex, your
past, or your forebears’ genetic makeup. But I can offer you plenty of ways to
22
Part I: The Brain and Stroke 

make changes in your life that will significantly reduce your risk of stroke. In
fact, I devote four chapters of this book (Chapters 8, 9, 10, and 20) to stroke-
prevention topics.
Some of the steps you can take to improve your outlook for a stroke-free
future include the following:
 Treat high blood pressure with medication, if necessary.
 Reduce sodium in your diet to help control high blood pressure.
 Stop smoking.
 Lower “bad” cholesterol and raise “good” cholesterol through medica-
tion and diet.
 Maintain a healthy weight, which may reduce blood pressure and
improve cholesterol levels.
 For women, consider the use of oral contraceptives or estrogen replace-
ment therapy with the advice of a physician.
Treating Stroke: Fast Response 
Is Everything
Damage occurs quickly with the onset of stroke. Whether a brain artery
starts bleeding or is plugged by a blood clot, in just minutes the symptoms
become apparent. And in the next hours most of the damage will be done and
the course set for the future.
In those first minutes and hours, a quick response and prompt course of
treatment are critical in terms of reducing the amount of permanent damage
and increasing odds for an optimal recovery.
Bottom line? Get to the hospital! If you’re having the stroke, call 911. If you’re
watching the symptoms of stroke overtake an individual, call 911.
Once at the emergency room, the first course of action will likely be a battery
of tests to verify which sort of stroke you are having. ER docs will likely take
your blood pressure, start an IV, draw blood, check your heart, and perform a
CT scan or an MRI to see your brain and determine what’s going on. They’ll
gather this evidence as quickly as possible so they can start the appropriate
course of treatment.
23
Chapter 1: A Brain Attack

Treatment response for white stroke
In ischemic stroke, the goal is to dissolve or remove the blood clot as quickly
as possible before the affected brain has gone from ischemia to infarction, or
brain cell death. This is most often done with a drug called tissue plasmino-
gen activator — or TPA.
TPA is a valuable drug and effective treatment, but it poses some risks. For
example, it can aggravate bleeding — so it’s critical to ensure that the stroke
is a white stroke — and not red. Because of its risks, emergency-room physi-
cians are cautious about using TPA. If they can’t verify that the stroke onset
was less than three hours prior, they will not prescribe TPA. After three hours
has passed, the damage to the brain is mostly done, and the risks of TPA out-
weigh any benefit.
Treatment response for red stroke
Red stroke poses greater challenges to the emergency-room team. Treatments
to stop bleeding are still being developed, and, currently, little can be done.
However, your physicians will be keenly focused on keeping you alive through
the first few days after your stroke. They will take efforts to lower your blood
pressure, reduce any brain swelling, and keep you breathing.
The bleeding may cause you to stop breathing, or may make your brain swell.
If we’re talking subarachnoid hemorrhage — bleeding outside the brain —
your doctors may consider surgery to patch an aneurysm or repair a rup-
tured vessel. I cover treatments for intracerebral and subarachnoid strokes in
detail in Chapters 5 and 6.
Most people who find themselves in the middle of a stroke are unprepared —
and being unprepared means losing precious time for treatment. The good
news for you is this: Because you are reading this book, your eyes are now
opened to the importance of fast response. Now’s the time to research whether
your community is one of the growing number of stroke-prepared locations
where the emergency medical system and hospitals are fully prepared to
respond to stroke. Stake out the best emergency center for stroke and have
your “evacuation” plan in place. It’s a minimal effort for maximum results.
Recovering from Stroke
If you’ve already had a stroke, improving your chances of recovery is as
important as preventing the next one. And you can take many positive steps
to increase your odds of a successful recovery.
24
Part I: The Brain and Stroke 

Connecting with the best experts
You can prepare your own taxes and repair your car, but evidence is strong
that placing your stroke care in the hands of a specialist will result in a
healthier outcome than if you try to manage your recovery by yourself.
Stroke specialists from neurologists to physical therapists have a great deal
to offer you, including the latest treatment opportunities when you first get
to the hospital (quickly, we hope) and throughout your recovery. Some thera-
pists are more experienced than others in taking care of stroke patients, how-
ever, and you want to seek out the best.
One of the best steps you can take is to find hospitals in your community that
have special certifications as stroke centers. Check with your own doctor and
with stroke patients in your community to find stroke specialists and experi-
enced therapists.
Exercising your brain cells
You may have heard that your brain can’t regenerate new brain cells to
replace those that are injured by a stroke. For any practical application to
your stroke, this is probably true. However, scientists are learning that the
brain can change significantly in response to injury. Stroke studies of animals
have established that new connections do form, and some evidence supports
that this happens in humans, as well.
We don’t know yet the extent to which exercise and physical and cognitive
therapy can increase the extent of the restoration of function after a stroke.
Exercising brain doesn’t seem to build new brain tissue the same way that
exercising muscle does. However, exercising muscles and joints does keep
them flexible and strong so that they are more responsive to small improve-
ments in brain function. And it is well-established that if you don’t maintain
your strength and flexibility after a stroke, you are less likely to regain as
much useful function of an arm or leg.
Your full therapy program, developed and supervised by an expert, is likely to
play an important role in your recovery. Adhering to the advice of your physi-
cal therapists and others on your recovery team will increase your results.
Asking for help
Stroke not only injures your brain and disables you, it also places stress on
your family and your financial security. Often these stresses are more than a
25
Chapter 1: A Brain Attack

married couple or a family can cope with. Recovery can be more complete if
you decide to take advantage of a wide array of community, employer, and
government programs that suit your needs.
You can learn a lot about the different ways to organize and pay for all the
care available after a stroke. It often takes two or more people to keep track
of all the different medical, social, and financial interactions that are imposed
on you by your stroke disability.
Several million people in the United States are living with the consequences
of stroke. Getting to know some of them can help you recover from your own
stroke — and perhaps provide emotional support as an added bonus. Com-
munity organizations, hospital social workers, and perhaps your own doctor
may be able to put you in touch with support groups and helpful resources.
Letting “use it or lose it” be 
your guiding principal
The basic principle of stroke recovery is use it or lose it. Use your muscles or
they won’t be there for you — even if your brain is able to rewire or relearn
old skills. Keep your joints flexible, or you won’t be able to bend them when
you do recover some strength. Use the opportunities to prevent another
stroke, or the next one you have may destroy all the gains of your recovery
from your first stroke. Use your community resources and the help of friends
when you need it. They often don’t offer more than once, if at all.
Living with Stroke: Reasons for Optimism
No doubt about it, stroke is a devastating event, a medical calamity that can
leave its victims severely disabled — or worse.
But study after study has shown that patients recovering from stroke do
indeed improve with time. They are better at three months than they were
when they left the hospital — and further along at a year than they were at
three months. Function returns, depression fades, and the skills to live inde-
pendently are gradually regained by a significant proportion of patients. And
as stroke survivors become more knowledgeable about stroke and how to
prevent it, they follow treatment plans that can dramatically reduce the
chances of a second stroke.
26
Part I: The Brain and Stroke 

Just as there are a lot of people who have strokes, there are a lot of people
who survive their stroke and learn to live with a disability. Life can return to
normal after a very mild stroke, but even with residual disability, you can still
have a meaningful life.
Stroke comes as an unexpected bolt from the blue and can dramatically
change your life. There are many opportunities to take actions that will
reduce the bad effects of stroke on your independence and quality of life.
Arming yourself with as much information as possible will take you far in
your recovery and improve your ability to cope with life after stroke.

T
he brain is arguably the most complex biological machine known. Buried
within its folds of gray matter are operational mysteries that continue to
confound the world’s most brilliant minds.
Our brains are what make us us. Your dreams, daydreams, personalities,
quirks, and unique points of view are all contained in your brain. Likewise,
your philosophies, political ideas, prejudices, knowledge, and passions are
buried inside your brain — though nobody really knows exactly where.
You can read a thousand books and travel a thousand miles, filling your brain
with memories of sights, sounds, and smells. Yet it doesn’t weigh any more
for all the information you pack into it. We’re just beginning to figure out how
little we know about the brain. What other amazing capabilities do our brains
have that we don’t even know about yet?
In this chapter I describe basic brain workings — “The Brain 101,” if you will —
with as little complex theory and Latin terminology as possible. The basic
facts are relatively easy to grasp — no more difficult, say, than learning the
rudiments of car operation and maintenance.
The brain is a delicate structure, soft and pliable, easily injured, locked
tightly and securely in a hard, protective skull that is well designed to protect
it from the bumps and sudden twists on the highway of human life.

By understanding how the brain is put together and what makes it run, you’ll
have a better appreciation for the damage everyday mileage puts on it. And
how, in some cases, that wear and tear can lead to stroke.
An Illustrated Tour of Your Brain
Information enters your brain, gets processed, and then comes out as behav-
ior. The difference between what comes in and what goes out is what the
world knows as you. Your brain — how you perceive data, process it, and
react to it — makes you the unique human being you are.
Different areas of the brain are responsible for different cognitive functions,
and these areas develop slightly differently in each person (see Figure 2-1).
But when it comes to the physical brain itself, one looks pretty much like the
others. Yours isn’t that distinguishable from Einstein’s.

30
Part I: The Brain and Stroke 

Parts of the brain
Figure 2-2 shows some of the parts of the brain.
Your brain stem is like the boiler room in a large industrial building. Maybe all
the important things happen upstairs, but the temperature control, plumb-
ing, and electrical circuits to keep the tenants in condition to work and live
are all downstairs. The brain stem is where all the information flows in and
out of your brain and also where all vital heart, breathing, and other vital
functions occur.
Nerves to and from the eyes, ears, mouth, and throat emanate from the brain
stem. The brain stem connects the thinking part of the brain to the rest of the
body primarily through the spinal cord, the major carrier of millions of nerve
fibers taking messages to muscles and organs of the body. The brain stem
simply passes on most information with little modification.
The cerebellum, that little brain on the back, seems to be a little computer
that smoothes things out, making us more graceful and less jerky as we move
about. In women, the cerebellum is larger relative to the rest of the brain,
interestingly enough. In strokes that damage the cerebellum, after you get
over the unsteadiness, which can take several months, you can survive seri-
ous injury destroying large parts of the cerebellum.
Fluid-filled cavities called ventricles account for about 10 percent of your total
brain volume, though nobody really knows what they are for. They are lined

31
Chapter 2: Understanding How the Brain Works

with special cells that produce a clear, protein-filled fluid. The brain’s four
ventricles are similar to the four ventricles of the heart. They are connected
by narrow canals. The fluid produced in the ventricles flows from the largest
two ventricles into the smaller two ventricles and finally out of the brain into
the space surrounding it and the spinal cord. Once outside, the fluid is
absorbed into the bloodstream.
Serious problems occur when the flow of the fluid out of the ventricles is
blocked by blood clots or brain swelling that squeezes the narrow canals
closed. Immense pressure can build up that will enlarge the ventricles and
cause further brain injury or death.
The ventricles look like dark holes in the brain on a CT scan, similar to what
appears in some kinds of stroke. You need to know about the ventricles when
you look at your CT (computerized tomography) scan. Otherwise, you may
think your stroke is a lot larger than it really is.
How the brain is wired
The brain consists of nerve cells, special support cells, blood-vessel cells,
and blood cells all working together. Nerve cells occur in clumps and sheets
that are organized the same in most human brains — yes, the same in men’s
and women’s brains, contrary to popular belief. The surface of the brain is
covered with around six layers of nerve cells, separated and held in place by
support cells. The nerve cells look like a tiny forest, with their branches,
twigs, and leaves touching each other at special connections.
The connection points between nerve cells are called synapses. Millions of
synapses exist for just a few nerve cells. The number of synapses for the
whole surface of the brain is truly staggering, almost unimaginable. There are
a lot of them.
Ever try to stop thinking? Not so easy, is it? Your nerve cells are extremely
active, chattering all the time like a flock of birds. Creating the chatter are
little electrical charges that repeat several times per second, day and night,
awake or dreaming. They never let up.
With all this electrical activity going on, it’s a wonder your brain doesn’t glow.
The brain is constantly receiving and sending information from one area to
another and directing it to and from the rest of your body. And this takes a lot
of energy (more on the brain’s energy later in this chapter).
Messages come into the brain from your sense organs: your skin, eyes, ears,
nose, mouth, and tongue. These incoming messages rain on the brain every
minute that you are awake. The brain depends on this raucous thunder of sig-
nals to know what’s going on in your body and the world.
32
Part I: The Brain and Stroke 

The brain reacts to signals you aren’t even conscious of. It responds to a
complex mix of speech and visual cues simultaneously. And from within, your
body sends the brain signals — you’re hungry, you’re too hot, your blood
pressure is too high.
Your responses to the incoming signals are formed all over the brain (Fig-
ure 2-3) and then routed out from the brain, usually as electrical signals to
muscles, which obligingly move as instructed by the brain.
Of course, some of the outgoing messages go somewhere besides a muscle.
For instance, your glands secrete tears, digestive juices, and all kinds of hor-
mones in response to your brain’s requests.

Chapter 2: Understanding How the Brain Works
The brain’s vineyard
The branches coming out of these central cell
areas are amazing. Have you seen grapevines
covering an arbor? Well, some nerve cells are
like that. Although most connect to only a thou-
sand or so nearby nerve cells, other nerve cells
have long, threadlike branches that extend from
your brain to the bottom of your spinal cord in
your lower back. And some nerve cells in your
spinal cord reach all the way to the surface of
the brain and then stretch to the end of your big
toe. How far is that? Could be five or six feet.
Sending nerve impulses at a rapid rate down
that long fiber consumes a huge amount of
energy.

One thing your brain does well is learn. And it does so quite quickly. After
you respond to the same stimulus a number of times, it takes a lot less time
and energy for the brain to organize a response. Scientists agree that this
learning requires the brain to form new permanent connections between
nerve cells. Some of these connections between nerve cells apparently last a
lifetime. This learning by forming new connections also takes a lot of the
brain’s energy.
So here’s the summary of the brain’s operating system:
1. The brain’s nerve cells receive messages and information, mostly by
electrical signals, from all over the body.
2. The nerve cells respond to the incoming messages by sending out mes-
sages to muscles and glands.
3. They also learn and remember by forming new connections.
But how does the brain process all these connections and signals? Next I look
at how basic processing is organized.
The Brain’s Roadmaps
The brain is like an atlas — full of roadmaps. The maps are organized in a log-
ical way: The nerve cells that move your left index finger are located between
the nerve cells that move your left thumb and left middle finger. The part 
of the brain that feels what the left index finger touches is situated right 
next to the part of the brain that moves the left index finger.
But the unusual thing about these brain maps is that they’re reversed right 
to left. Many are even reversed up to down. In the two hemispheres — the
largest part of the brain — the right hemisphere controls the left side of the
body, and the left hemisphere controls the right side. These reversed maps
are also found in other parts of your brain, including the brain stem and
underneath the hemispheres.
How the brain manages 
all the different senses
The picture that you see as your brain peers through your eyes and out into
the world travels to the visual cortex in the very back of the brain. The scene
each eye picks up goes to the brain stem, to a little junction box. Nerve fibers
34
Part I: The Brain and Stroke 

from the junction box send this data across the middle of the brain stem and
to the very back of the brain where it’s projected on the opposite side. For
example, what your eyes see to the upper left is shown on the lower right
part of the map.
Hearing is presented on a whole series of little maps that arrange the pitch by
frequency. The hearing cortex is located between the more straightforward
mechanical areas that coordinate movement and the areas where more emo-
tional functions are known to reside.
Ordinary touch is mapped according to the position on the body, just like the
area responsible for simple movements.
Taste and smell have their own special locations in the brain stem and frontal
cortex just above the nose.
Left brain, right brain
Although the brain appears to be similar from side to side (the left hemisphere
looks the same as the right hemisphere), each half of the brain seems to spe-
cialize in certain functions. Large areas of the left side of the brain (between
the area for simple movements and the area for vision) are related to language
and language processing as well as mathematics. The left side of the brain is
often referred to as the logical half.
Interestingly, there is some speculation that people with injuries to their left
hemisphere are more likely to become depressed than those individuals with
right-hemisphere injuries. Is the left brain happier than the right? Although
there may not be a rigid division of emotional centers in the brain, experience
indicates that positive emotions may be located on the left side of the brain.
What does the right brain specialize in? We tap into the skills of the right
hemisphere when we listen to music, draw a picture, and approach complex
spatial problems and abstract problem-solving. The right brain is associated
with our imagination. Just as it appears that positive emotions may be 
tied to the left hemisphere, negative emotions may be associated with 
the right brain.
Numerous books delve into the differences between the right and left side of
the brain, even offering exercises for developing your creative side or your
analytical skills. There’s even some speculation that the functions of the left
and right halves of the brain are to some extent based on your culture and
how you are raised.
35
Chapter 2: Understanding How the Brain Works

The two sides of the brain work together to create a balance in perceiving
and responding to the world. The following key concepts about the makeup,
organization, and workings of the brain are particularly important when con-
sidering stroke:
 The major brain functions are spread over a large area on the outer
upper surface of the brain.
 Nerves and nerve fibers for the same functions are concentrated in very
small areas in the brain stem.
 The map of brain functions is quite similar for most humans with
normal, uninjured brains.
 The brain functions related to one side of the body are generally located
on the opposite side of the brain.
 After a stroke, by measuring the strength of your muscles in your face,
arms, and legs, it is possible to make some guesses about the area of 
the brain that has been affected by the stroke from the weakness that
you have.
 After a stroke, the brain injury may make it impossible to recognize that
there is a brain injury or even that a hand, arm, or leg is part of your body.
 Language occurs primarily in the surface of the left brain. Problems with
language almost always point to damage or injury on the surface of the
left brain.
Fueling the Brain’s Energy Highways
Ever try to concentrate on a difficult mental task when you were tired or
hungry? Doesn’t work very well, does it? It’s kind of like driving your car on
an empty tank of gas.
Your brain also needs fuel — in this case, that fuel is provided by the blood.
Now that we’ve looked under the brain’s hood, we understand a bit more
how the brain’s operating system works — how nerve impulses are transmit-
ted to and fro, picking up data and sending messages. We’ve established that
the brain and nervous system are extremely active and require a lot of fuel.
So let’s take a look at how the brain gets that energy.
From superhighway to back road
Basically, your blood vessels are the delivery system for the food — oxygen
and glucose — that the brain needs in order to function. Imagine your body’s
vascular system as a national highway system.
36
Part I: The Brain and Stroke 

Four superhighway blood vessels move large amounts of blood to the brain.
The two carotid arteries are the largest highways, with ten lanes each. They
are in the front of the neck and pulse away your whole life. You can feel the
pulse in the hollow on each side of your windpipe. At the back of the neck,
threading through the bones, are the two four-lane vertebral arteries. They
join to form the larger basilar artery.
The basilar artery then divides to create a large traffic circle called the circle
of Willis that connects the four major arteries (the superhighways). Parts of
this traffic circle are small or incomplete in a surprisingly high percentage of
people. In general, though, it is hard to completely block traffic in this system
at the base of the brain because it can usually reroute itself to reach almost
any part of the brain stem and brain.
The blood vessels grow out from the traffic circle at the base of the brain and
spread upward into the brain. Once away from the traffic circle — out in the
country where most of the brain is — only one major blood vessel (like an
old state highway) serves each area.
Branching off from the country highways are even smaller back roads and
driveways — tiny blood vessels called capillaries, as small as a single red
blood cell, which are about the same size as the smallest neuron — that
deliver oxygen and glucose to the brain. This fuel simply oozes through the
capillary wall and is absorbed by the different nerve and nerve support cells
in the brain.
Sending fuel where it is needed most
One remarkable thing about the brain is more blood goes where the brain is
more active. For example, if you start tapping your right index finger on the
table as fast as you can, more blood will flow to the part of your (left) brain
that has responsibility for moving that finger. This may be a small place —
about the size of a dime — but more blood flows here as the brain sends
thousands and thousands of extra electrical volleys out to the small muscles
that move your finger.
You can even see the increased blood flow in special pictures of the brain.
When you solve problems, plan activities, or look at complicated patterns,
your brain momentarily shifts more blood flow to the areas of the brain that
are associated with those actions.
When the main vessels to a certain brain area are blocked, the only alter-
nates are very small routes that support hardly any traffic flow. In an emer-
gency, these smaller vessels can widen and open up, but the process can take
several days.
In the meantime, those brain areas normally served by the main vessel don’t
get needed supplies. Without fuel and oxygen, these areas can last only a few
37
Chapter 2: Understanding How the Brain Works

minutes or hours on supplies brought in along the small alternate routes. 
The longer it takes to restore the flow of energy through the main vessel, the
higher the chances are that they will suffer ill consequences from the break
in their main supply line.
Connecting blood vessel to brain area
The area of the brain supplied by a particular artery doesn’t have just one
purpose or affect function in just one area of the body. For example, blocking
the anterior cerebral artery may affect movement and feeling in the opposite
leg as well as make it more difficult for you to control your emotions and
impulsive behavior. Cutting off blood flow in another artery can make you
deaf and dizzy. This is because brain arteries travel through areas of the
brain that aren’t necessarily related.
In cases of stroke, the brain is damaged by a blocked or bleeding artery. One
challenge for doctors is to figure out which blood vessel is causing the stroke.
Dozens of blood vessels are associated with the right leg, for example. But
fewer are connected to the right leg and the personality. Neurologists, there-
fore, can sometimes make a pretty good guess about which blood vessel is
causing the stroke based on the patient’s combination of symptoms.
(An MRI scan, CT scan, or angiogram may also help define which vessel is
causing the symptoms. More about these procedures later in this chapter
and elsewhere in the book.)
Consequences of Gridlock 
on the Vascular Interstate
Now that you have an idea of how your blood vessels carry food to your
brain, just imagine the consequences of a breakdown in that delivery system.
Consider the impact of a major pile-up on your route home from work — you
can count on missing dinner. Likewise, when there’s a blood clot or another
blockage in a major blood vessel to your brain, it likely means your brain is
not going to be fed. And a brain without food cannot last long.
How long? When you apply a tourniquet to your arm or leg, the maximum
time the affected muscles can endure complete loss of blood supply without
destructive injury is approximately two hours. Your brain is far more sensi-
tive to lack of blood flow than your muscles. The maximum time your brain
can survive without blood flow without sustaining permanent injury is
approximately five minutes.
38
Part I: The Brain and Stroke 

Why such a difference between muscles and brain? Muscles are designed to
survive with limited oxygen and sugar fuel. When blood flow is halted, the
muscle cells turn to their own internal stores of glycogen for fuel. They convert
glycogen to energy through a chemical process that allows them to continue
working. Thus, organs and tissues can buy a little extra time before damage
occurs — organs and tissues, that is, other than the brain or spinal cord.
This is your brain on stroke
You know those scented candles in jars? The ones I am thinking of have quite
a bit of space above the candles. You have to tip the jar to the side and reach
down in to light the candle. The wick burns, and the jar acts as a reflector.
When you put the top on the jar, the candle continues to burn for a certain
number of seconds before it begins to flicker and then goes out as the oxygen
inside is consumed.
Putting the lid on the candle is like cutting off the blood supply to the brain.
You don’t have much time after stopping blood flow before the brain cells 
cut off from that energy quit working and are permanently injured. This is
what happens in many strokes, when a blood clot blocks the blood flow to
your brain.
In white stroke — the topic of the next chapter — some brain cells can sur-
vive for one or two hours because the blood supply is not always completely
blocked by the blood clot. As I mention, the main road can be blocked, but
smaller side roads can widen a bit and allow for some flow. A very small
amount of blood can flow in from nearby areas of the brain where the artery
is not plugged by a blood clot.
The benefit to the brain cells that this backup blood flow provides can be
critically important. But when symptoms of a stroke are apparent, backup
flow is nothing you can count on. It certainly doesn’t mean you should relax
and take the time to pack a suitcase or call a family member. The sooner doc-
tors start doing what they can to restore blood flow and protect the brain,
the better. Just remember that every minute of delay is killing millions of
brain cells. Call 911.
The nearby case history about the clot-buster drug called TPA illustrates 
what happens when a blood clot blocks the main artery to the left side of the
brain — the left internal carotid artery — and causes a stroke. This case
demonstrates many of the principles of brain structure and function dis-
cussed so far. The injury to the left brain stopped language and the function
of the right arm and leg. The left side of the body wasn’t affected. Because
the blood flow was re-established quickly, the permanent brain injury was
less than if the artery had remained closed.
39
Chapter 2: Understanding How the Brain Works

Your brain’s response to injury
When your brain is injured by stroke, it mounts a significant response to
repair the damage and clean up the mess. The result is similar to what hap-
pens anywhere when you injure yourself.
White blood cells are activated to absorb dead and dying cell debris and carry
it away in the bloodstream. Some brain cells form a kind of scar tissue on the
edges of the injury. When the stroke is larger than a few cells, a small cavity,
which fills with a clear or yellow fluid, forms in the brain. When a red stroke
(see Chapters 5 and 6) heals, it often stains the brain yellow because the
white cells change the color of the red pigment of blood in the process of
cleaning up the blood clot. This is similar to the yellow tinge that you may
have seen as a bruise heals.
Evidence indicates that part of the healing process for the brain may include
some sort of rewiring. The younger you are, the more extensive the rewiring
is, and the more rapidly it occurs. What actually happens in the cells is some-
thing of a mystery. Whether new cells are formed as part of the process
remains unclear, but we do know that new connections are formed.
One of the best-studied examples of rewiring is when patients with normal
vision become blind. When their brains are studied several years later, it is
clear that the part of the brain that used to respond to visual stimuli now
responds to touch in the fingers as the patients read Braille.
40
Part I: The Brain and Stroke 
TPA: Clot-buster to the rescue
One Saturday morning, a 75-year-old man was
in his yard when he developed a headache,
right-side weakness, and confusion. Neighbors
called EMS. He was brought to the emergency
department of a mid-sized Midwestern hospital.
When first examined, he couldn’t lift his right
arm, the right side of his face drooped, and his
right leg was weak. He was unable to talk and
did not seem to understand what was being
said to him.
He was taken for a CT scan immediately. No
blood was seen on the CT. Because of his symp-
toms, the doctor taking care of him thought that
the problem was probably in the left internal
carotid artery or one of its main branches.
Because there was no bleeding seen on the CT
scan to suggest a red stroke, the doctor
assumed this was a white ischemic stroke
caused by a blood clot blocking an artery.
The doctor on call gave TPA, tissue plasmino-
gen activator, a commonly used clot-buster for
stroke patients, to dissolve the blood clot two
hours after the stroke started. The patient had
recovered the use of his right leg and could
speak and understand words to some extent.
This man owes a lot to his quick-thinking neigh-
bors who got him to an emergency room so fast.

After a stroke, brain function generally improves some with time. This is true
regardless of the type of stroke. The improvement is more rapid in the first
few weeks and months and is thought to be greater if other problems, such as
muscle contractures and atrophy of muscles, are prevented. (Read more
about rehabilitation and prevention of contractures in Chapter 13.)
Occupational, speech, and physical therapy all incorporate exercises to aid
in rehabilitation. Recent research indicates that such therapy may play an
important role in stimulating brain rewiring and regrowth. Naturally, the
larger the brain injury is, the less you will be able to recover.
Medical Technologies for 
Peering into the Brain
A picture is worth a thousand words, and this is especially true when it
comes to stroke. Pictures of the brain help neurologists and stroke specialists
understand a lot about a patient’s condition and how he or she has been
affected by stroke. Until the invention of modern techniques to visualize the
brain inside the skull, neurology depended almost entirely on a careful exami-
nation of the patient, plus a spinal tap reading, to diagnose brain problems.
In the past three decades, especially with the development of CT and MRI
scans, doctors have been able to get a clearer picture of the living brain
inside your skull. Today, a variety of tools allow doctors to peek inside the
skull and learn more about the state of an individual’s brain.
The CT scan
The CT scan, the most common scan used on the brain, involves X-rays, using
about the same amount of radiation as a chest X-ray (refer to the next chap-
ter’s Figure 3-1 for an example of a CT scan).
CT stands for computerized tomography. A CT scan is also called a CAT scan.
CAT stands for computerized axial tomography. Tomography is the process of
getting the whole picture from a lot of different views from different angles.
You don’t have to remember or know what CT or CAT stands for. Many doc-
tors couldn’t tell you, either.
To have a CT scan of your head, you are placed on a large, movable table, and
your head is positioned in the middle of a futuristic-looking metal-and-plastic
donut. X-rays are taken from many different angles as the emitter orbits
around your head. In about five minutes, the scan process is completed. 
A computer constructs an image of the brain inside the skull by adding
together all the information.
41
Chapter 2: Understanding How the Brain Works

Imagine slicing an orange horizontally into quarter-inch slabs. As you move
through the orange the slices get larger, and then smaller after you pass the
halfway point. The first slice may only contain peel, revealing a white center
outlined by the thin orange skin. Progressive slices begin to include the seg-
mented interior of the fruit, and you see a wagon-wheel pattern develop.
Further toward the center you encounter the seeds.
That’s what a CT scan does. Each slice is a picture of a thin part of your brain.
The slices are usually arranged from the base of your neck to the top of your
head. You can see more than the brain — often the eyes and part of the nose
are visible. Typically, the images are taken at an angle that avoids the teeth
because these interfere with the X-rays, especially if you have metal fillings.
On the CT scan, the brain appears gray. The ventricles and the spaces in the
convolutions of the brain are dark gray or black. The bone of the skull and
jaw appears white. Typically, the outer surface of the brain, the cerebral
cortex, appears a little whiter than the rest of the brain.
Evidence of white stroke can be found on a brain CT scan only after several
hours or days. This is because the damage caused by white stroke can take a
while to show up. The first visible sign is most often swelling of the brain,
then the part of the brain destroyed by the stroke becomes darker until it
matches the ventricles. This is because after weeks or months the parts of
brain injured by stroke are replaced by clear fluid.
Red stroke shows up as a white area in the brain. The white area is outside
the brain, mostly at the base, in subarachnoid hemorrhage. The white area is
inside the brain if the red stroke is caused by bleeding inside the brain. (Read
about these two forms of red stroke in Chapters 5 and 6.)
The MRI scan
The magnetic resonance imaging, or MRI, scan can look a lot like the CT scan,
but it uses magnetism and radio waves instead of X-rays to form images
(check out Chapter 7’s Figure 7-1 to see an example). Because of the strong
magnets, you have to be careful about metal in the scan area. Tooth fillings
aren’t a problem because they aren’t magnetic.
An MRI scan takes longer to perform and requires the patient to hold still in a
very confined space. In this case, the “donut” encompasses your whole body,
not just your head. The result, however, is a much more detailed picture of
the brain than a CT scan provides.
In addition, the MRI scan can give a clearer picture of blood flow. Using an MRI
scan, a white stroke is detected easily, even in the first hours after the stroke.
The same stroke would probably not yet be visible on a CT scan. On the other
hand, hemorrhage is not usually as easy to see early on an MRI scan.
42
Part I: The Brain and Stroke 

The angiogram
Stroke, as you now know, is all about the blood and blood vessels. The best
pictures of the brain’s blood vessels come from a procedure called an
angiogram (refer to Chapter 6’s Figure 6-3 for an example). An angiogram
involves the injection of a special dye into the blood vessels of the brain
through a long tube inserted in the groin and run up through the body. As the
dye pumps through the blood vessels, a rapid series of X-rays are taken.
The result is an easily read X-ray of the blood vessels. Several pictures have
to be taken in order to get a good idea of what the vessels look like. What you
get is a picture of the inside of blood vessels that are larger than a sixteenth
of an inch or so.
Though rare, there can be complications during an angiogram. The tube can
punch a hole in a blood vessel, which could cause a brain hemorrhage. The
tube might knock a piece of blood clot loose, or a clot may form on the end of
the tube. Doctors keep the patient awake during the angiogram so they can
test brain function during the process.
Because of the risks of conventional angiograms and better alternative tech-
nology, angiograms are being done less often than they used to be. This is
partly because the same machines used for MRI scans can also do MRA, mag-
netic resonance angiography. The images formed in MRA can be almost as
clear as those obtained from conventional angiography. CT scan technology
can also be used to obtain images of brain arteries, to some extent.
If there is any doubt about CT or MRA angiograms, then a conventional
angiogram may be required.
The ultrasound
Surprisingly, sound waves often produce a telling picture of the brain’s blood
vessels. These waves, called ultrasound because their pitch is so high that they
43
Chapter 2: Understanding How the Brain Works
So which scan should be used?
MRI scans give more information than CT 
scans — but take more time and cost more
money. Under emergency conditions, the time it
takes to do them may delay treatment. A CT
scan is all that is needed in the emergency room
to deliver the best care according to current
stroke treatment guidelines.

can’t be heard, are emitted into and through you, and a computer analysis 
of the echoes from the sound waves helps doctors identify problems in 
your vessels.
Ultrasound is thought to be one of the safer methods of imaging. In fact, you
are probably most familiar with the use of ultrasounds in taking pictures of
unborn fetuses in pregnant women. An ultrasound can spot narrowing of the
blood vessels in the neck. As ultrasound techniques improve, surgeons are
increasingly eliminating the angiogram, which leads to certain risks, before
doing surgery on the carotid artery in the neck.
A form of ultrasound called a Transcranial Doppler ultrasound can safely help
diagnose narrow places in brain vessels inside the skull. The images that are
formed are blurry and lack the clarity seen with angiograms. But then, there
is almost no risk. And the ultrasound is portable and easily performed in the
emergency room, stroke unit, or intensive care unit.
The brain is an extremely complex organ. Many of its mysteries remain hidden
from even the most brilliant and knowledgeable experts. But a general under-
standing of the makeup of the brain, how it operates, and how it is fueled can
benefit any of us. For stroke patients and caring family members, knowing
more about the brain underscores the importance of doing all we can to 
prevent stroke and, if it inevitably occurs, respond quickly and effectively 
in treating stroke.
The PET scan
Well, since CAT scans aren’t for cats, don’t be surprised that PET scans are
not for pets. A positron emission tomography, or PET, scan can actually show
the chemical activity of the brain via the introduction of special radioactive
compounds into the brain. This procedure results in more exposure to radia-
tion, and it is almost impossible to do a PET scan in an emergency. The com-
pounds used have a very short shelf life. The images are in color, but are not
as detailed as CT and MR scans. For the present time, PET scans are for
research purposes.

Part II
Types of Stroke

In this part . . .
T
here are five basic types of stroke, so there are five
chapters in this part. Stroke is caused by two things
that can go wrong in the brain. When a blood clot blocks
an artery to or inside the brain, that is what I call a white
stroke, because of the lack of blood. When there is bleed-
ing inside the skull, that’s what I refer to as a red stroke.
These chapters take each type in turn and discuss each 
in detail.

W
hat I term white strokes — technically called ischemic strokes or acute
ischemic strokes (AIS) — are so called because they stop the flow of
blood. White strokes are the most common type of stroke, representing four
out of five strokes. They stand in contrast to red strokes, which, not surpris-
ingly, cause bleeding in the brain. In almost every white stroke, a blood clot
forms and blocks blood flow to a part of the brain. The result is a painless
loss of brain function. Sometimes, the incident has little or no impact on a
person’s life; in other cases, it causes severe incapacitating disability. Most
white strokes result in some kind of life-changing disability.
Strokes come suddenly. Few victims recognize what’s happening as it strikes.
The characteristic signs are weakness of an arm, drooping of one side of the
face, and inability to speak, understand language, or walk. Usually with white
stroke, the victim does not experience pain. Others nearby often report that
the individual just appeared surprised or stunned. In the luckiest cases,
someone calls an ambulance, and the victim is quickly taken to an emergency
department of a large hospital with a stroke team.
Many are not so lucky. They don’t understand what is happening and wait
around to see if things improve. They may not want to make a big deal of the
inexplicable and unusual feelings they are having. They may call a family
member or a doctor’s office. Instead of minutes, it takes these people hours

or even days to get to the hospital — usually too late to get the best treat-
ment. In other words, if you think you might be having a stroke, don’t delay
because of any doubts. Call 911.
In this chapter, I explain in detail how white strokes occur, what causes them,
how they injure the brain, and how to help prevent further white strokes.
Getting a Handle on the Jargon
Like all doctors, I use a lot of jargon in my day-to-day dealings with the brain. I
try to avoid that as much as possible in this chapter. The problem is, your
doctor may not try to avoid it, and I don’t want you to be intimidated when you
hear “stroke talk.” Most of the terms I define in Table 3-1 are relatively simple.

Infarction (in FARK shun)

Cerebral infarct
Dead brain area caused by an ischemic stroke
I’m kind of a purist, so I don’t mix up the term stroke, which means the sudden
loss of brain function, with infarct, which is the result of some white strokes.
White strokes can be transient and not cause an infarct. Or, they can be treated
soon enough to reverse ischemia before the process of infarction begins.
Infarction is the process of cells dying because of insufficient blood flow.
Initially, the brain area killed by prolonged ischemia — an infarct — contains
dead brain cells. With time, the dead tissue is cleaned up to leave a hole in
the brain that is filled with clear fluid.
Technically, it’s not right to point to a hole in a brain and call it a stroke. That is
an infarct. Many people have evidence of brain infarction with no recollection
of ever having stroke symptoms. Does that mean a lot of people are running
around out there with holes in their brain and don’t even know it? Yes, it
does. They have brain infarcts but have not had a stroke. They may have
other symptoms (see Chapter 7).
48
Part II: Types of Stroke 

You can also have a stroke, even a white stroke, without having an infarction.
A blockage must last several minutes before brain cells start dying and an
infarct begins to be formed. Some strokes are transient and, fortunately for
those who have them, do not cause infarction. There’s a lot more about tran-
sient strokes in Chapter 4.
How Blood Clots Cause Stroke
Understanding how stroke happens is pretty simple. What to do about it and
how to recover from serious brain injury are not so simple, as you will see.
In Figure 3-1, notice that inside the white skull are gray areas, which are brain,
and dark areas, which are fluid. Some of the dark areas are normal — they are
usually similar on both sides of the brain. Some dark areas, however, indicate
that a stroke occurred. In this scan, almost half of the brain has been destroyed
by a stroke, and the dark area you see on the left is an infarct. The stroke hap-
pened a week before this scan was taken.

Chapter 3: White Stroke (Ischemic): Blood Clots Block the Brain

If you knick your thumb with a knife or bruise your hip on the edge of a table,
you may bleed for a while, but eventually the bleeding stops. This is because
blood has the amazing ability to stay liquid inside blood vessels, but turn
solid and patch holes in the same vessels when they are cut or torn. The
blood’s ability to clot can save your life during childbirth or when you are
injured in accidents. However, as with many wonderful things, there are 
times when blood clotting can be a big problem. Stroke is one of them.
Getting blood through the pipeline
Your brain weighs just a couple of pounds, yet it uses about a fifth of your
body’s energy — even when it seems to be idle. Solving problems, and other
stress, significantly increase the brain’s energy consumption.
The brain gets all this energy from the blood. The basics of blood energy are
glucose (sugar) and oxygen. Unlike muscle tissue and other organs, brain cells
don’t store energy to be used if the blood doesn’t provide enough. Some
organs can even survive without oxygen on the short term. The brain is not
among them. The brain can’t adjust to lack of oxygen. It burns sugar so fast
that without blood flow, it begins to fail within 30 to 60 seconds. You can hold
your breath for a minute or more without injuring your brain because your
heart is still beating and there is enough oxygen and glucose to keep your
brain going. When all available oxygen is pulled out of the blood, you either
have to take a breath or lose consciousness.
50
Part II: Types of Stroke 
A quick response to stroke symptoms
A 68-year-old retired glass blower woke at 6
a.m. and came downstairs to read the paper
and eat his breakfast. His wife was at the
counter talking about the weather and looking
out the window. She heard a spoon clatter to
the floor and turned to see her husband looking
bewildered. His mouth hung down on one side,
and he was looking at his right hand, which had
apparently just dropped the spoon.
When she asked what was wrong, he started to
speak, but a garbled noise came out of his
mouth. He stopped talking and looked at her,
then his hand. His face seemed flat on the 
right side and he kept slowly clenching and
unclenching his right hand. He looked down 
and tried to stand up. He slipped and put out his
right hand to catch himself, but fell.
His wife realized he had had a stroke. She
called 911, and he was taken to the emergency
room. He received a drug to dissolve a blood
clot and he improved somewhat by the next
morning in the hospital. Three months later he
is still retired at home. His speech has never
quite returned to normal.

The brain needs about a pint and a half of good, oxygenated blood every
minute to get its job done. All this blood has to travel north from the heart in
four main arteries. These lines branch and branch again as they travel up
into the brain. Eventually, tiny arteries branch into capillaries that hold only a
single red blood cell. In the capillaries, the oxygen and sugar leave the blood
and enter the substance of the brain. All this activity allows one to think, talk
with a neighbor, play video games, and so on.
The key idea is that from main arteries as big around as your little finger, the
vessels narrow down to such fine diameters that only a single red blood cell can
get through. Anything that can’t be squeezed through such a tiny pipe stops
blood flow there, and some part of the brain is starved for oxygen and glucose.
Blood and clotting
Every day, blood clots repair blood vessel leaks that come about from the
ordinary wear and tear of everyday life. Brushing your teeth, banging your
knee on a table leg (which just happened to me this morning), and scraping
yourself on a tree branch are all events that injure blood vessels. Their rapid
repair goes unnoticed most of the time.
When I was a kid, I lived in Denver, where these little, thorny weeds growing
out of sidewalk cracks were forever causing flat tires on my bike. One day, a
man at Jenson’s Hardware showed me NeverLeak Tire Fluid. You squeezed
this remarkable stuff into the tire’s valve and, miraculously, no more flat tires.
It was a glue-like liquid that ran around inside the tire all the time, sealing the
leaks as fast as they happened.
You see where I’m going with this. The blood is like NeverLeak, a liquid that is
always just seconds away from becoming a gelatinous solid and minutes to
hours away from becoming a tough plug of sticky gum. The balance between
liquid and solid forms of blood is very delicate and can be shifted one way or
the other by a number of different factors.
As you age, your clotting system tends to tilt more toward clotting than
bleeding. These clots can form anywhere in the blood vessels, but do tend to
accumulate most often in the heart and at rough spots in the blood vessels.
Breaking loose and forming in place
Blood clots begin as rather loose clumps of tiny blood cells called platelets.
Platelets get sticky and adhere to each other and to the wall of the blood
vessel near places where there is a break in the lining of the blood vessels.
51
Chapter 3: White Stroke (Ischemic): Blood Clots Block the Brain

Over time, these clots get harder. Some eventually become quite rigid with-
out much to hold them together — like dried mud, they break into small frag-
ments easily.
If a piece of a clot breaks off, it can travel downstream to the brain, where it
can eventually lodge . . . and cause a stroke. The lining of the blood vessel
where it lodges is usually intact and can activate processes in the blood to
dissolve the clot. Because these broken-off clots were formed sometime earlier,
they tend to be firmer, gummier, and harder to dissolve than clots that have
just formed in place. As the clot gets smaller, it moves further downstream.
As it moves downstream, it moves past openings into branch arteries that are
then open to carry blood to more of your brain.
The result might be that someone in the emergency department might regain
the ability to use their right hand, but still have difficulty saying words. In this
case, the clot blocked blood flow to two branch arteries. When it broke up or
was partially dissolved, the blood pressure forced it downstream past the
branch that took blood to the part of the brain that controlled the person’s
right hand before any permanent damage had occurred. That part of the brain
started working again. The clot was still large enough that it blocked flow to
the language area of the brain, and speech was still abnormal.
Clots can also form at narrow spots in blood vessels where there is athero-
sclerosis. When they do, they can cause a stroke, but because the clots are
relatively new, they are softer and may be easier to dissolve.
Bleeding into the vessel wall
Some experts suspect the cause of stroke is a little more complicated in a
large number of cases. Suppose your carotid artery, which leads through your
neck to the brain, develops a large plaque that nearly closes it off. The plaque
looks like the craters of the moon: rough, with ridges and valleys where the
artery lining has been torn and replaced many times.
As the plaque grows rougher and thicker, it also grows more fragile. The
carotid artery is twisted and stretched whenever you move your neck.
Eventually the top layer of the plaque may split open exposing the fat, cal-
cium, and scar tissue underneath. The split in the lining can create a pocket
in the surface of the plaque that catches the blood flowing past — like an
umbrella turned the wrong way breaks in a strong breeze. Under high pres-
sure, the blood catches the split edge. As the blood forces its way under it
the edge, the plaque enlarges and closes against the opposite wall of the
artery. The sudden enlargement of the plaque fills the artery and stops the
blood from flowing past. A stroke results. Then the blood in the plaque clots,
and you have a permanently blocked artery.

White Stroke Risk Factors
Most of the factors that lead to forming blood clots can be related in one way
or another to things you do — or don’t do — that increase your chances of
having a white stroke.
High blood pressure
Hypertension, or longstanding high blood pressure, is a disease that causes
your blood pressure to be higher than it should be, even when you are
relaxed and rested. Atherosclerosis is worse in people who have high blood
pressure, simply because of the extra wear and tear of all that blood going by
faster and pushing harder. Rushing fluid cut the Grand Canyon out of rock —
imagine what it can do to the lining of your blood vessels.
High blood pressure quadruples your chances of having a stroke compared
to people your same age. Having high blood pressure is like being someone
who drives too fast and follows other cars too closely all the time. Chances of

Chapter 3: White Stroke (Ischemic): Blood Clots Block the Brain
Hearing a “whoosh” in your head
Even a little bit of clot formation can cause a
stroke in vessels where atherosclerotic plaques
have built up so much that they nearly block the
flow. In these cases, there is hardly any room
for the blood to squeeze by. Because the pas-
sage is narrow, the blood tends to go faster —
like whitewater through a narrow canyon.
Sometimes it moves so fast that it causes a
whooshing sound every time the heart beats.
This sound is called a bruit (BROO-ee).
You usually can’t hear your own bruit.
Sometimes a doctor can hear it with a stetho-
scope on your neck next to the carotid artery.
The sound is “whoosh . . . whoosh . . . whoosh”
in your head or neck in time with your heartbeat.
Don’t worry if you hear this sound yourself while
you are lying down with the side of your head
pressing down on a pillow. Almost everyone
hears this sound at one time or another when
lying down. A bruit could mean that you have a
very thick atherosclerotic plaque in your carotid
artery. Your doctor will probably have it checked
out with a special ultrasound test, because
some of these thick plaques can be removed by
a surgeon to prevent a stroke. A bruit is a sign of
a narrowing vessel, which means more wear
and tear on the vessels — they can be very
rough, and the lining can be injured more often.
And if a small clot forms in that narrow spot, it
can quickly close off the already tiny space
available for blood flow. Then you have a stroke.
If it’s a major blood vessel like the carotid artery,
you have a major stroke.

a crash are much more likely. Your car has a speedometer you can read any-
time you want. You have to go to a doctor’s office or drugstore to measure
your blood pressure. Do you know how fast your blood pressure is wearing
out your blood vessels?
Some people who have never shown any signs of high blood pressure in the
past can increase their blood pressure by taking certain drugs such as decon-
gestants, high doses of anti-inflammatory drugs like ibuprofen, prednisone
and other steroids, or diet pills — or by being anxious or angry. Be sure you
are checking your blood pressure if you are taking any of these medications
on a regular basis.
High blood pressure injures the lining of your blood vessels, leading to a clot,
which can result in a stroke. Usually the stroke is a white ischemic stroke.
High blood pressure is also a major risk for red strokes. Sometimes it causes
a weak-walled artery to burst and bleed into the brain — a red stroke (see
Chapter 5).
Fat and atherosclerosis
Blood vessels have a thin, delicate lining that keeps blood from clotting. But
whenever there are rough spots, such as when this lining is broken, the blood
comes in contact with the underlying muscle and protein that make up the
wall of the blood vessel. Suddenly, just like NeverLeak in a tire, blood starts
clotting right there, covering over the bare spot that has lost its lining. This
happens while blood that doesn’t touch the bare spot continues to rush on
by. The clotting of the blood stimulates the cells of the lining to grow, and the
patch is complete.
A couple of other factors also work together to create rough spots on the
inside of your arteries where blood clots can form. One is the process of ath-
erosclerosis, which seems to result in part from high fat in the diet. With ath-
erosclerosis, for whatever reason, fat collects underneath the protective lining
of the blood vessels and occasionally breaks through it. Result: blood clot,
fat, and a new lining over the conglomeration of fat and clot. As this process
continues, especially at places where the blood flow is under high pressure
or where it turns a corner, hard little irregularly shaped nubbins called plaques
form. Plaques can collect calcium and often become quite hard and crunchy.
Hence, the term hardening of the arteries — also called atherosclerosis.
Large plaques can be removed by surgery. And some are reported to get
smaller if you go on a diet very low in fats.
54
Part II: Types of Stroke 

Smoking tobacco
The chemicals that get into your bloodstream when you smoke tobacco appar-
ently irritate the lining of the blood vessels and make atherosclerosis worse.
Millions of Americans are buying and smoking tobacco products, primarily
cigarettes. They are paying to shorten their own lives. They usually worry
about lung and mouth cancer. But a lot more harm comes from injury to your
heart and blood vessels. Smoking more that doubles your risk of heart attack
and stroke. Smoking also increases your blood pressure.
Some smokers seem to believe that the damage is already done and that
stopping won’t make any difference. The evidence is overwhelming that stop-
ping smoking will reduce your odds for having stroke. After a year or two,
your chances of stroke are reduced to the same as if you had never smoked.
Atrial fibrillation
The heart is designed to pump at a steady pace in order to maintain a strong
enough pressure and keep the blood flowing smoothly. The contraction of the
different chambers of the heart needs to be carefully synchronized.
Otherwise, the blood doesn’t flow smoothly.
In a condition called atrial fibrillation, the heart has an irregular beat that
allows the blood to slow down, swirl in eddies against itself, and collect in
pockets of the heart chamber called the atrium. A simple electrocardiogram
(EKG) test of your heart — the one where they hook wires onto your chest,
wrists, and one leg — can tell you if you have atrial fibrillation.
55
Chapter 3: White Stroke (Ischemic): Blood Clots Block the Brain
Why no finger strokes?
If 80 percent of the blood goes elsewhere, 
why don’t people have strokes elsewhere —
such as a finger, for example? Well, for one
thing the blood vessels in the brain are much
less interconnected than blood vessels in other
organs. I have no idea why this is. For whatever
reason — unlike the case with the finger — if
you plug an artery to the brain, there are very
few alternate routes for the blood. And other 
tissues tolerate the blockage longer, giving
more time for the clot to dissolve on its own.
In muscle, for example, there are many alter-
nate routes because the vessels are connected
together in a network. The likelihood is small
that muscle or other tissue will ever die
because of an artery blocked by a clot.
Sometimes, a black spot may form on a finger
or a toe where skin dies because an artery got
plugged, but this is not nearly as common as in
the brain.

How does a clot in the heart cause a stroke in the brain? Simple: It grows, 
and a piece of it breaks off and is shot out of the heart under high pressure.
There’s a one-in-five chance it will hit the brain because 20 percent of the
blood goes there. If it does, it’s inevitable that it will clog an artery and usu-
ally cause a stroke. The smaller the clot, the smaller the artery that gets
clogged and the smaller any stroke will be.
Estrogen: Pregnancy, the pill, and 
hormone-replacement supplements
Women face a unique risk of white stroke: Estrogen, a hormone that occurs
naturally in women, has long been known to increase the occurrence of blood
clots. Estrogen levels are especially high in pregnancy, when it is a good idea
to be able to clot and prevent excessive bleeding. Many women also take
estrogen orally in birth control pills or in hormone-replacement supplements
during menopause.
Smoking is especially bad for you when combined with taking estrogen. When
combined with other risk factors for stroke — such as high blood pressure 
or high cholesterol or smoking — the extra estrogen that comes from preg-
nancy, birth-control pills, or hormone-replacement therapy after menopause
makes it important that you take other steps to reduce the chance of blood
clot formation and stroke. I suggest you discuss this with the doctor prescrib-
ing the estrogen.
Other risks
Here are some other factors that some experts warn may further increase
your chances of blood clots:
 Dehydration: Dehydration means not enough water in the blood. The
blood is thicker and, therefore, more likely to clot. Many older people
are dehydrated simply because they tend not to drink enough water.
Alcohol, caffeine, and exercise dehydrate you, and people tend to
become dehydrated overnight. Dehydration increases the chances of a
blood clot forming in the arteries — hence more chance of stroke.
 Stress: Stress is related to blood pressure, but its impact is less under-
stood. I’m a little hesitant to write about this — it seems like placing
blame for a stroke where it doesn’t belong. One hears stories: “He had
the stroke right after his daughter said she was going to marry that
biker.” Sure, this may have raised Dad’s blood pressure, but it could
56
Part II: Types of Stroke 

have been one straw out of the pile on the camel’s back. I think it’s
unfair to blame the daughter. (Maybe the biker, though.) You could prob-
ably find a lot of upsetting things that happened a few hours before any
particular stroke. Still, a couple of research projects have confirmed the
association of emotional upset with stroke onset.
 Certain medications: As I mentioned earlier, some medications, even
over-the-counter drugs, can increase your blood pressure suddenly,
leading to blood-vessel injury and blood clot. Diet pills, prednisone, high
doses of pain medications like aspirin or ibuprofen, and decongestants
are examples. Read the fine print that comes with your prescriptions.
Watch your blood pressure if there are warnings about the drug increas-
ing blood pressure.
 Changing blood-pressure medication dosage: Many who suffer from
high blood pressure feel secure that they are on medication to maintain
a healthy blood pressure and stave off strokes, among other related
problems. But they may not realize that carelessly changing dosages or
switching medications may result in a sudden spike of high blood pres-
sure. It’s extremely important to monitor your blood pressure when
changing medicines or dosage.
Other Causes of White Stroke
Blood clots are almost always the cause of white strokes. But there are long
lists of very unusual causes of stroke. I won’t burden you with all of them, but
two are common enough that you should understand them.
Dissection
Dissection is a medical term for splitting something apart, usually along lines
that are already there. It usually doesn’t mean cutting. At least to a physician.
So how does dissection cause stroke?
As I have mentioned, blood vessels are like tires with inner tubes. They are
hollow and made up of strong layers of material that fit inside each other.
Blood vessels have three basic layers, and each is a separate sheath. If you
follow the line between the layers, you can peel — dissect — the layers of an
artery just as you can peel the bark off a green tree branch. There is a natural
line along which the artery breaks into two separate parts.
If the edge of a torn innermost layer faces upstream into the flow of blood,
the blood can force its way under it and peel the vessel from the inside, in
57
Chapter 3: White Stroke (Ischemic): Blood Clots Block the Brain

much the same way you can pull the bark off a tree limb, strip the plastic off
a wire, or peel a banana. As the blood forces its way under the edge, it makes
a blister of blood on the inside of the artery. This blister swells and lengthens
and can completely shut off the blood flow. This kind of stroke usually hap-
pens at the back of the neck in arteries going to the brain, called the vertebral
arteries, meaning stroke can result. See the nearby sidebar called “An acci-
dent leads to white stroke” for more.
Red strokes
One kind of red stroke called subarachnoid hemorrhage can also cause 
white strokes. Chapter 6 deals with red stroke caused by subarachnoid 
hemorrhage — but I give you a little preview here so that you can under-
stand how it causes white strokes.
The bleeding from subarachnoid hemorrhage can embed some brain vessels in
a blood clot. These are blood vessels just outside the brain but inside the skull.
For unknown reasons, the muscles in blood vessels just hate to be exposed
to blood, and usually the vessel lining protects the artery muscle from contact
with blood. After severe red strokes, though, there is blood all over the out-
side of some brain vessels. The artery muscles then contract and go into
spasm, shutting off the blood flow downstream in the arteries and causing a
white stroke.
58
Part II: Types of Stroke 
An accident leads to white stroke
A 62-year-old news cameraman was carrying a
television camera behind a reporter who was
chasing down a story. There was a short hedge
in his path. As he stepped over it, someone
yelled and he turned his head quickly while still
holding the camera on his shoulder. He had to
twist his head very far and back because of the
camera. And then he tripped on the hedge and
fell. When he got up he had a strange burning
pain in the back of his neck and within a minute
or so began to feel extremely dizzy and nause-
ated. He felt as if he would lose his balance
again when he tried to walk, but he managed to
drive home.
Later, he noticed his face felt a little numb. He
continued to have neck pain and was unsteady
when he walked. The neck pain became a
pretty severe headache. He didn’t like doctors
so he just stayed home for a few days. The
symptoms got better and he returned to work,
though he was still a little unsteady on his feet.
He saw a doctor only after his company made
him do it, because he had missed work. A very
small stroke deep in the brain was diagnosed 
by MRI scan. He was told he couldn’t carry 
the camera at work any more. He retired. The
diagnosis was stroke caused by vertebral
artery dissection.

The nurses may notice that a patient’s red stroke caused by subarachnoid
hemorrhage is getting worse. This may be due to a white stroke. The white
stroke is said to be due to spasm in the arteries, vasospasm (VAY zoh spaz um).
How White Stroke Injures the Brain
So now you know that white ischemic stroke is caused by a blood clot block-
ing an artery to the brain. Either the flow is completely or partially cut off to
some portion of the brain that depends primarily on that artery for blood. 
As time passes, brain cells in the affected region stop their usual function as
they run out of oxygen. After a short time, if blood flow is not restored, the
brain cells are not able to keep up with their basic needs for survival. When
this happens, the cells begin to die, and their cell walls begin to break down.
For a while, the brain can hold its breath. Some cells in the brain can survive
longer without oxygen than others. Some can steal enough oxygen from nearby
blood vessels that are still flowing to keep themselves alive. However, others
start dying within minutes of the first deprivation of blood. Most of the cells
die within three to four hours.
It is very important to treat white stroke before three hours have elapsed.
Because it takes time to get ready for treatment, you have to be in the emer-
gency room as soon as possible — certainly within an hour — to get the most
benefit from restoring blood flow. After enough time passes, unblocking an
artery and restoring blood flow doesn’t revive any cells. The area in the brain
where cells die from lack of blood flow, as mentioned earlier, is called the
area of infarction or an infarct.
Brain swelling
As the outer membranes of the brain cells in an area of infarction begin to
fail, fluid rushes into the cells and they swell until they eventually burst open.
As cells are dying, they attract white blood cells into the area — the cleanup
crew. In addition, blood vessels in the injured area leak, and blood fluids are
forced into the area. This is just like any other injury to your body. When
there is injury, there is swelling and inflammation from white blood cells and
leaky blood vessels.
Brain ischemia from a white stroke causes the brain to swell. In large strokes,
the swelling can be so significant that the whole brain is distorted out of its
normal shape. The swelling gets worse in the first few days after the stroke. It
typically reaches a maximum at two to four days and then resolves as the
injured brain area is cleaned up by white blood cells.
59
Chapter 3: White Stroke (Ischemic): Blood Clots Block the Brain

If the swelling causes the injured side to press across the midline of the brain
into some of the space usually occupied by the other side, vital structures 
at the base of the brain can be crushed by the pressure. Brain swelling is one
of the most common causes of death in stroke patients. There are several
treatments for brain swelling, but they only help for a short time.
Brain bleeding
I already explained how one type of red stroke can cause white strokes. I will
now tell you how white strokes can cause red strokes.
Brain blood vessels, unlike brain cells, can survive reasonably well without
oxygen or glucose. Made of muscle and other components, they have their
own energy stores on board. However, lack of blood flow begins to weaken
them, lessening their ability to contain blood under pressure. Given enough
time, though, the blood vessels may open themselves back up by dissolving
the offending blood clot — but typically not quickly enough to stave off
stroke effects.
If a blood vessel into an area of dead and dying brain happens to reopen nat-
urally, then the part of the vessel downstream that may have been weakened
while no blood was flowing through it can rupture. This can cause a real mess,
with blood, dead brain cells, and fluid flowing into the area of infarction.
The body responds by sending in the troops — white blood cells — to clean
up. They do a thorough job. We don’t know yet whether they are a little too
thorough and cause further brain injury in the cleanup process, but if they
do, it isn’t much. Nevertheless, over a few weeks, the brain infarction area is
cleaned up until all that is left is a cavity filled with clear liquid. These cavi-
ties (infarctions) are usually pretty easy to see on a CT or MRI scan.
Seizures
Epileptic seizures sometimes occur after white strokes, typically when the
stroke creates an infarction at or near the surface of the brain, where seizures
start. Presumably, as the infarction heals, the brain is more vulnerable to the
hyper-excitability that causes seizures. Just like a person under stress is
more prone to an angry outburst, brain cells without sufficient oxygen are
more likely to fire off an outburst of electrical waves. The reason for this is
that a short circuit develops in the electrical control system. Left on its own,
the unrestrained electrical system cannot hold back its surge of electrical
activity. One result is that oxygen and glucose are used up even faster than
usual. Another result can be a seizure. These seizures are often fairly easy to
control with medication that restrain the production of electrical discharges
in brain cells.
60
Part II: Types of Stroke 

Different Sizes of White Strokes
Both blood vessels and blood clots come in a variety of sizes. This means
that white stroke comes in many sizes, too.
One thing to realize is that the severity of the stroke doesn’t always match
the size of the hole — or infarction — that it leaves in your brain. The brain
has small control centers, where a lot of information from all over the brain
connects or passes through on the way someplace else. Even a small infarc-
tion in one of these critical information centers can cause severe disability.
Big strokes: Blocking a major artery
The biggest strokes occur when one of the four major arteries supplying the
brain is completely blocked and there is little blood flow to make up for the
loss from the other side. The availability of blood from the other side of the
brain is somewhat a matter of luck. Some people have great collateral flow
from one side to the other. For instance, if your right carotid artery is blocked
by a blood clot in your neck, you might have a stroke on the right side of
61
Chapter 3: White Stroke (Ischemic): Blood Clots Block the Brain
Big stroke: Left side leads to 
communication problems
An 87-year-old retired postal worker was found
by a student who was renting a room from her.
She was in a chair in front of the television,
breathing deeply and noisily, her mouth opening
and closing. She was looking over to her left
side. The student called 911. In the emergency
room, she was found to be completely paralyzed
on her right side. The right side of her face was
flat and her mouth drooped. She was unable to
speak and didn’t seem to understand anything
said to her. She drifted into sleep and noisy
breathing whenever she was left alone for a
few minutes.
After a few days in the hospital, she began to
improve. She tried to speak and seemed to
understand a few words. She was able to move
the fingers of her right hand slightly. She still
couldn’t raise here right arm or walk on her
own. With some help, she could support herself
while standing.
One of her visitors was the student who found
her. He told the doctor that she had had a spell
a few days before her stroke. She had said she
was in the bathtub and lost the use of her right
arm for a few minutes. It returned to normal, and
she apparently thought no more about it.
She had no immediate family. She was dis-
charged from the hospital to a nursing home.
She required a great deal of care. Her neuro-
logical condition improved, but her continuing
difficulty with communication limited her
progress. She had persistent difficulty with
swallowing. She finally developed pneumonia
and died several months later.

your brain. Often this doesn’t happen because blood from the left carotid
artery crosses over to the right side through the traffic circle of vessels at the
base of the brain.
Both of the nearby case study sidebars talk about big strokes caused by
blockage of the carotid artery to the brain, but in each case the carotid
artery is blocked on a different side. A carotid artery blockage on the left
side, as in the case of the elderly retired postal worker, causes weakness and
numbness on the right side of the body, as well as difficulty with speaking. A
big stroke on the right side of the brain paralyzes the left side, but leaves the
victim capable of speaking and communicating. Typical with this type of
stroke, though, is that the victim may not recognize that the left side is not
working, as is the case with the retired insurance agent.
Medium stroke: Blocking branches 
of main trunk arteries
Most strokes are not as severe as the two described in the preceding two
case studies. They may start out with quite severe symptoms, but often
improve in the first few days. Patients with medium stroke are very likely to

Big stroke: Right side leads to left side paralysis
A 67-year-old retired insurance agent awoke
early to go to the bathroom. He found he couldn’t
get out of bed and began talking to himself. The
sound awakened his wife, a frequent visitor to
a nursing home. She knew immediately by look-
ing at him that he had had a stroke. He was not
moving his left side and his face drooped on the
left. She called 911. He didn’t want her to make
such a big deal out of it. In the emergency room,
he was not treated with the drug TPA (tissue
plasminogen activator, a drug that dissolves
blood clots) because the time the stroke started
could not be established. In the hospital, for the
first few days after the stroke, he was sleepy
and dozed a great deal. A CT scan showed
some brain swelling on the right side of his
brain. Further testing showed that his carotid
artery was completely blocked, but that quite a
bit of blood was crossing over from the left to
the right side of the brain.
After three or four days, he became more alert
and regained some use of his left arm and leg.
He didn’t seem to pay much attention to the fact
that his left side was weak. He did complain of
some discomfort from the numbness of his left
arm. He had no problems with speech or com-
munication. He was sent home with his wife
without going to a rehabilitation unit. The fact
that he didn’t really care about the paralysis on
his left side was considered an indication that
he would not do well with rehabilitation.
At home, he became depressed during the first
four weeks. His wife mentioned this to his
doctor and he was given medication for depres-
sion. After that, he did remarkably well. He con-
tinued to socialize with his family and he
learned to get himself around quite well using a
cane and ankle brace to walk.

benefit from rehabilitation and typically are able to return home, though fre-
quently they may not be able to continue working. Medium strokes are usu-
ally caused by blockage of just a branch of one of the main trunk arteries to
the brain.
Small strokes: Cross circulation 
minimizes injury
The case here involved one of the four major trunk arteries to the brain —
the left vertebral artery. Because of extensive cross circulation from the 
right vertebral artery and the two carotid arteries, the resulting stroke was
pretty minimal.

Chapter 3: White Stroke (Ischemic): Blood Clots Block the Brain
Medium stroke: Quick response and near recovery
One night, an 82-year-old retired teacher called
her daughter who lived out of town. She said,
“Something’s wrong,” in a strangled voice that
was difficult to understand. Her daughter called
the local police who notified EMS of the emer-
gency. The woman arrived at the emergency
room about an hour after she called her daugh-
ter. There, she exhibited moderate to severe
weakness of her right arm, slight weakness of
her right leg, drooping of the face on her right
side, and difficulty pronouncing words — but no
difficulty comprehending speech. When she
finally got them out, her answers to questions
were sensible. The emergency department doc-
tors were able to determine what time the
stroke started from her memory of the television
show she had been watching. A CT scan of her
head showed no evidence of brain hemorrhage.
Blood tests were normal. She was treated with
the drug TPA and admitted to the ICU.
The next morning her right arm was stronger,
but not normal. Both her face and leg also still
showed signs of weakness. It was difficult to tell
whether her speech had improved. Physical
therapy was started right away in the hospital.
She remained outgoing and smiled a lot during
the next few days. She spent one week in a
rehabilitation unit working with physical and
occupational therapists before returning home.
Three months later, her condition had improved
so that most people did not notice the clumsi-
ness of her right hand or her slight limp. When
she walked, her right arm tended to bend at the
elbow and her right hand formed a fist. Her
speech was still noticeably different, but there
was no problem understanding her. She did rou-
tine stretching exercises twice a day of all the
muscles of her right arm and leg.

Diagnosing White Stroke
The most serious problems encountered in white stroke are also encountered
in red strokes. These include brain swelling, brain hemorrhage, blood clots in
the legs, and pneumonia and other infections. Chapter 12 explores the treat-
ment of all types of stroke in the hospital. Here, I provide a little extra detail
on diagnosing white stroke in the hospital.
When no brain bleeding is seen on a CT scan in the emergency room, doctors
will likely determine that a stroke was a white stroke by the time the patient
is settled in the hospital. They will now concentrate on further testing to
determine what caused the blood clot that led to the stroke. This is impor-
tant because there are treatments that can reduce the risk of another stroke.
In addition, they are as worried about brain swelling and bleeding into dam-
aged brain and another white stroke. In order to monitor cause, severity, and
potential for further strokes — both white and red — they may employ the
following tests:
 CT and MRI scan: An X-ray CT scan performed earlier in the emergency
room may have been normal (see Chapter 2 for more on CT and MRI
scans). This is because an infarction may take days to appear clearly on a
CT scan. So, another one may be done. An MRI scan can show the changes
after just a few hours. After a few days, both CT and MRI scans can show
the amount and location of brain injured by the stroke. And both can also
give some idea of the condition of the major brain blood vessels.

Part II: Types of Stroke 
Small stroke: Back to almost normal
A 57-year-old maintenance worker was out
walking his dog. He felt some pain in his head,
became very dizzy, and was seeing double. He
staggered when he walked. A neighbor started
to help him walk home, but the man insisted that
he just wanted to sit down for a while. After
resting, he still was dizzy and seeing double. He
thought he was a little better and started to walk
again. He still had problems with his balance.
The neighbor called an ambulance and got the
man to lie down on his porch. The ambulance
took more than an hour to get to him. The EMTs
suspected that he had dizziness due to a viral
infection. They took quite a while evaluating him
on the porch before deciding to take him to the
emergency room. He waited in the emergency
room for an hour before a physician saw him.
His blood pressure was high at 170 over 120. He
took no medication except B vitamins.
He was admitted to the hospital. He still had
some difficulty with coordination, but his walk-
ing was much steadier and his double vision
had resolved. He was able to leave the hospital
three days later and returned home. His balance
never felt quite normal again, but most people
didn’t notice this when they saw him walking.
He continued to work and walk his dog.

 Ultrasound: You may be familiar with ultrasounds as a method of cap-
turing images of unborn fetuses in pregnant women. These pictures pro-
duce images using sound waves instead of X-rays. The ultrasound is a
less invasive procedure than an angiogram — in other words, no needle.
Usually some form of jelly is applied on the skin and a probe is moved
around until a good picture angle is found.
Ultrasound can give a good picture of the mainline carotid arteries and
determine if there is a large atherosclerotic plaque. It can also get a
fairly good picture through the skull of some of the larger arteries at the
base of the brain. Finally, some very clear images of the heart can be
obtained, especially if the patient is willing to have a tube placed in the
throat (which apparently looks small to doctors, but may look like a
garden hose to the patient — the truth is probably somewhere in
between). If the test can determine where the clot came from, it may
save you from having a second, perhaps larger, stroke.
 Angiograms: These invasive tests involve pumping dye into the brain
arteries and taking X-rays to find clots. A large needle, placed into the
big artery of one leg, feeds a long plastic tube through the arteries up
toward the head, around a few tight corners, and then into the carotid or
vertebral artery of choice. Then a special dye is pumped into the arter-
ies at considerable pressure. The patient is sedated, the head held tight
so it doesn’t move.
Angiograms are not used very frequently, because similar information —
some think better — can be gained from a non-invasive ultrasound.
Another reason is that there’s a slight risk — less than 1 percent — that
an angiogram can cause a stroke (by breaking a piece of clot loose or by
punching a hole in a brain artery).
 Other tests: If you’ve had a stroke, the chances are well over 50 percent
that you have some combination of several other medical problems
including high blood pressure, diabetes, heart disease, arthritis, or prob-
lems with memory. So, in addition to stroke, these other conditions may
need to be evaluated and treated as well. Like when you take your car to
get the oil changed and they tell you that the brakes are almost gone,
the timing belt is about to break, and the shocks are finished. Whatever
you decide about your car, when it comes to stroke, the repairs recom-
mended are probably worth the expense. You definitely can’t trade your-
self in for a new model.
Treating White Strokes
Treating white strokes involves dissolving the clot that caused the stroke,
treating complications from any brain injury that does occur, and preventing
the next stroke.

Chapter 3: White Stroke (Ischemic): Blood Clots Block the Brain

Dissolving the clot
At the time of this writing, there is only one FDA-approved treatment for
white ischemic stroke. This is TPA (tissue plasminogen activator), a drug that
dissolves the blood clot that is blocking a brain artery and causing ischemia
in part of the brain. If TPA is given early — three hours or less after the first
symptoms of your stroke — the blood clot may be dissolved, and blood flow
re-established soon enough to reduce the amount of injury to the brain.
TPA has been shown to increase your chances of going home with minimal or
no disability by 30 percent. However, there are serious side effects of brain
hemorrhage in about 6 percent of patients who receive the drug, usually in
those with the worst strokes. Doctors have to be sure you are not prone to
bleeding and that you do not have a red stroke caused by bleeding. TPA
would only make a red stroke worse.
Using TPA requires a coordinated team effort to ensure your safety and the ear-
liest possible treatment when the benefits are likely to be greatest. Many hos-
pitals are just now getting around to organizing the teams that are required.
Treating the complications
Unfortunately, not many patients get to the emergency room soon enough to
be treated. If TPA can’t be given, there is still a lot that can be done, but noth-
ing that will reduce the amount of brain injury from the stroke. The things
that can be done fall into two categories: Preventing the complications of the
brain hemorrhage and preventing another stroke. All of these treatments are
described in later chapters in this book.
For white stroke, two of the most important complications to treat in the hos-
pital are swallowing and blood clots that form in your legs due to inactivity
from the stroke. Swallowing problems can lead to serious, possible fatal,
cases of pneumonia. Blood clots in your leg veins can break loose and stop
your heart or lungs. This isn’t good either.
Swallowing problems can be treated by a speech therapist who can teach you
ways to eat without choking or inhaling bits of food or drink.
Blood clots in your legs can be prevented by compression stockings or
blood-thinning drugs. The choice depends on your other medical problems
and the severity of your stroke disability.
66
Part II: Types of Stroke 

Preventing another stroke
Each of the treatable risk factors can be addressed after you have a stroke. 
A second stroke may be even more serious that the one you just had, so it is
definitely worth the effort. Stroke specialists know a lot more about prevent-
ing second and subsequent strokes than they do about preventing that first
one. Ideas on prevention, in fact, are scattered all over this book because pre-
vention is so important. But you should especially see the chapters in Part III
for a lot of information on preventing strokes.
I present the following short list to summarize what you should be doing to
prevent a second stroke while you are recovering from your first stroke:
 Control your blood pressure.
 Thin your blood if you have atrial fibrillation.
 Swear off tobacco.
 Take aspirin or a substitute.
 See if you would benefit from having a large atherosclerotic plaque
cleared out of your carotid artery.
 Lower the cholesterol levels in your blood.
 Learn the signs and symptoms of stroke and teach your family to call
911 so that if you do have a stroke, you can be treated rapidly to reduce
disability from a second stroke.

A
68-year-old retired postman was out walking his dog one morning. He
noticed a fog forming in his vision and rubbed his right eyelid to see if it
would clear. It didn’t. He covered his right eye and the fog cleared. When he
covered his left eye he could barely see anything with his right eye, as if his
vision was grayed out. He stopped and sat down at a bus stop. Still his vision
did not clear. He was beginning to worry now. He got up and decided to hurry
home. By the time he got home his vision had cleared. He told his wife, and
they decided to call an eye doctor. The receptionist scheduled an appoint-
ment in two weeks.
The morning after her boss’s daughter’s wedding party, a 61-year-old accoun-
tant was resting in the living room watching television and slowly drinking a
cup of coffee. As she reached for the cup, she became aware that her right
hand and forearm felt numb. Her hand seemed clumsy. She tried to pick up
the cup but her fingers wouldn’t wrap around the handle. She noticed her
face felt funny as well. She thought about whether she had too much to drink
at the party the night before. Then she remembered her blood pressure and
wondered if she was having a stroke. She started to get frightened. She
looked for the telephone to call for help but decided she didn’t want to scare
everyone or cause a lot of commotion. She tried to calm down and take a

deep breath. The feeling was still gone in her hand, and her face felt heavy on
the right side. In a minute or two, the feeling started to return to her hand.
The whole episode lasted three or four minutes. She went to the hospital’s
emergency department that morning and insisted on being seen right away.
Both of these scenarios illustrate typical occurrences of transient ischemic
attack (TIA), or transient stroke, a form of white stroke that is distinguished
by its short duration and the fact that it passes without lingering symptoms.
How about a quick refresher: In Chapter 3, you found out that white strokes
come in different sizes because blood clots and brain arteries come in differ-
ent sizes. The symptoms depend on which artery is plugged. Blockage of the
right carotid artery could leave you paralyzed on your left side; a clot in the
left carotid artery might cause you to be unable to communicate or under-
stand language. Strokes in smaller brain arteries cause other symptoms —
not necessarily less severe — depending on what part of the brain that artery
leads to.
This chapter explores another factor: the length of time the artery is plugged. If
the vessel is plugged for a shorter amount of time, less or even no damage may
occur. These “mini strokes” — in which the victim recovers from stroke symp-
toms in as little as a few minutes and has no lingering stroke symptoms — are
considered transient strokes (or, by their official name, transient ischemic
attacks — TIA).
Transient strokes typically last about two to seven minutes. Some last a little
longer. You might read an official definition that transient strokes are all
those that last less than 24 hours. But as a rule, they distinguish themselves
from classical white strokes by being noticeably shorter events.
A type of stroke that neither lasts long nor leaves the victim with any debili-
tating after-effects? Should we be concerned at all? If there’s one thing that
you take from this chapter, let it be this: If you have a transient stroke, be
concerned. Be very concerned. Why? Because a transient stroke can be fol-
lowed by a serious disabling stroke within 24 to 48 hours. Roughly 10–20 per-
cent of individuals who experience a transient stroke will suffer a bigger
white stroke within 90 days. Half of these strokes will occur in the first 48
hours. And 15 percent of strokes are preceded by transient strokes. That
amounts to at least 75,000 people per year in the United States. But experts
estimate that these figures are actually higher — because many transient
strokes are probably not reported.
In this chapter, I discuss transient strokes and why they are serious, even 
if they’re often referred to as minor strokes. I cover how to respond to a 
transient stroke and suggest steps for preventing future strokes, transient 
or otherwise.
70
Part II: Types of Stroke 

Defining Transient Stroke
Transient means lasting only a short time. Thus, a transient stroke is differen-
tiated from the white stroke dealt with in Chapter 3 by its length. Recall the
alphabet soup of names for white stroke: cerebrovascular accident, or CVA, and
ischemic stroke, or acute ischemic stroke or AIS. You’ll hear doctors and med-
ical professionals refer to transient strokes as transient ischemic attacks — or,
in their acknowledgment of how hard this is to say, TIAs. Why some strokes
are accidents and others attacks has always baffled me. I prefer to say that
some white strokes are transient.
So you have this little stroke. It’s over in minutes and you’re back to normal.
Your arms and legs work fine, you walk without a limp, your speech returns,
your mind is working, and you exhibit no sign that you ever suffered this
strange episode. Are you free of brain injury?
Not necessarily. As explained in Chapter 3, if a brain artery is plugged for
long enough, the brain is permanently injured, and the result is a hole in the
brain called an infarct. If the infarct is big enough or in a critical location, then
a permanent disability is the result — lingering symptoms such as impaired
speech or walking with difficulty, for example.
Transient strokes present a different situation: a relatively short period of
stroke symptom and no apparent disability after the episode clears up. This
doesn’t guarantee, however, that there isn’t any brain injury. If the blood flow
is stopped or slowed down for a long enough period of time, brain injury will
occur, and the resulting infarct may be seen on a CT or MRI scan.
In a transient stroke, it’s possible that no brain injury occurred. But it’s just as
possible that it did occur. Some transient strokes may cause brain injury, but
that brain injury may not cause any abnormality noticed by the patient. Stroke
comes, stroke leaves, brain is injured, but nobody could tell unless they
observed the little hole revealed on a brain scan. It’s like a scar on your leg:
It’s usually hidden, and no one notices because you don’t walk any differently.
But how can it be that there are no symptoms at all, yet the brain is injured
and an infarct can be seen on a brain scan? Well, it seems that some parts of
your brain just don’t cause obvious symptoms when they are injured. A lot of
people live with small brain injuries they don’t know they have. The only
problem comes when all these small injuries begin to add up to a bigger,
more obvious injury, called vascular dementia, that does cause symptoms.
Table 4-1 lists all the possibilities for white stroke.

How a Transient Stroke Occurs
A transient stroke begins just like any other white stroke. It may start when a
blood clot forms in an artery and blocks it right there. This often happens at
a spot where the artery, such as the carotid artery, is narrowed by a rough,
raised plaque of cholesterol and scar tissue caused by atherosclerosis and
high fat in the diet (see Figure 4-1). (See Chapter 3 for more information
about atherosclerosis and blood clots.) Or a clot that has formed in an artery
or the heart can break free and travel downstream to the brain or the retina.
Your carotid arteries, the pulses from which you feel around your voice box
in your throat, are each about the size of your little finger. Near the angle of
your jaw, each artery branches — one branch to your scalp and face, the
72
Part II: Types of Stroke 
Transient stroke can cause vision loss
A transient stroke may result in loss of vision in
one eye. One of the arteries to the brain is an
artery that supplies blood to the retina of the
eye, the seeing part at the back of the eye. (The
blood supply of the retina is what causes the
red eyes seen in flash photography.) When a
blood clot plugs this artery, the retina stops
working and a gray curtain falls on the vision
from that eye. Often it will clear. If it does clear,
it is called transient monocular blindness or
even amaurosis fugax (fleeting blindness in
Latin). If it doesn’t clear, it is called retinal artery
occlusion.
Because technically the retina is part of the
brain, I feel comfortable calling this a stroke.
Others, perhaps most, don’t.

other a mainline for blood to your brain. For some reason, this branch in the
carotid arteries is prone to develop thick plaques of atherosclerosis.
The carotid plaques are particularly rough and cragged with craters and val-
leys. The plaques are composed of cholesterol, scar tissue, and calcium all
mixed together. Because they are right in the path of blood headed to the
brain, they are a common cause of stroke.
Such a stroke can occur a couple of ways:
 A clot can form on the plaque and close off the branch to the brain —
this can be a major stroke affecting almost one third of the entire brain.
 A clot can begin to form on the plaque and then break loose in the blood-
stream to travel toward the brain and block a smaller brain artery —
this would also cause a stroke, but probably one not as serious as the
clot blocking off the entire carotid artery.
In some patients, surgeons can remove the plaques to prevent strokes.

Chapter 4: Transient Stroke (TIA): Warning Sign

In any case, the vessel is clogged, and you begin to notice one or several of
those stroke warning signs discussed so far in this book: The left or right side
of your body loses feeling; you can’t hold an object with your hand; you have
blurred vision in one or both eyes; you can’t find the words for what you
want to say; you don’t understand what others are saying to you.
In a regular white stroke, these symptoms are likely to continue for quite a
while, even while you’re being taken to the emergency room. In a transient
stroke, they’re likely to clear up within 10 minutes — because in this case,
your body is working efficiently against the clot.
As soon as blood flow is blocked, blood vessels all over the body spring into
action to restore the flow. First, the small blood arteries that cross-connect
with the blocked artery enlarge and increase their capacity to carry blood.
Then enzymes, blood cells, and other molecules in the lining of the blood ves-
sels are activated to dissolve and remove the clot.
In a white stroke that results in permanent brain injury, this process is not
fast enough for the brain. By the time the blood clot is cleared and blood flow
is restored, the sensitive substance of the brain is already injured beyond
repair. In a transient stroke, however, the enzymes successfully attack and
break up the clot quickly, and the blood flow returns. There can still be a
brain injury — an infarct might be seen on a brain scan — but often there is
no brain injury at all.
In transient stroke, the symptoms clear completely after the episode. The
brain, puzzled by the whole process, heaves a sigh and thinks, “I wonder
what that was?” Unfortunately, your brain also learns that maybe if you wait
the next time you have a stroke, it may also go away on its own. That is not
the right lesson to learn from transient stroke. Read on.
How to Recognize a Transient Stroke
Some people aren’t sure whether they are having a transient stroke. If it goes
away while they are still trying to figure out what is happening, they may not
realize how serious it is. I don’t want anyone who has a stroke to stay home
confused or simply hope it will go away. On the other hand, I don’t want
everyone running to the emergency department just because their foot 
fell asleep.
If you have a little spell that starts out like a stroke but clears up, it could be
a transient stroke. But it could also be a migraine headache, pressure on a
nerve, a small seizure, or even low blood sugar. Sometimes, it might be hard
74
Part II: Types of Stroke 

to distinguish between, say, a dizzy spell and a transient stroke. Often people
are confused and a little afraid of making too much of the episode and err on
the side of timidity. They tell themselves they’ll wait and see — and then
never get around to going to the doctor at all.
But often, telltale signs distinguish a headache or a dizzy spell from a stroke.
Arm or leg falls asleep
If you sit on a hard surface for a long while, your leg may start buzzing with
numbness. Tight straps or clothing may cause numbness in your arm or
hand. This is because of pressure on a nerve going to your arm or leg. Having
an arm or leg fall asleep is so common that most recognize this phenomenon
for what it is. You know you have been in an uncomfortable position and you
can often feel pain at the site where the nerve was pinched.
The numbness of stroke can be similar. But a few indicators might help you
differentiate between an ordinary numbness and a transient stroke. If the
numbness spreads to your shoulder, or hip, or elsewhere on the body, then
this is a sign that the problem is more serious. If it spreads to include both an
arm and a leg on the same side — and you have clumsiness or weakness of
that arm or leg — then it’s likely a stroke.
You better call 911 or get yourself to an emergency department soon, even if
it clears up on your way or before you even leave for the hospital. Now you
understand what is most likely a transient stroke that needs to be evaluated
by a physician. Don’t wait for it to go away. Even if it has before.
Dizzy spell
Dizzy spells are extremely difficult to figure out — especially when they clear
up in a few minutes. There can be an episode of “wooziness” when the brain
just doesn’t feel right. There can be bouts of spinning vertigo with nausea
and vomiting. A spell of lightheadedness, or vertigo, is usually not a stroke.
There are many causes of vertigo: viral infection, an unusual form of
migraine, even a benign condition that results in vertigo when you rise up
from bed or move your head in certain ways.
But stroke is one of the causes of room-spinning vertigo, too. How do you
know if that dizzy spell you just had is a sign of a transient stroke? Stroke-
caused vertigo is often associated with other symptoms, including numbness
or weakness on the side of the face, a droopy eyelid, or double vision.
75
Chapter 4: Transient Stroke (TIA): Warning Sign

Sometimes dizziness caused by a stroke can be associated with clumsiness
or weakness of the hand. Likewise, you might have difficulty with balance
while you are walking — or staggering, as the case may be — supporting
yourself against tables and chairs.
Age is another indicator of whether your dizziness is likely to be stroke-related.
A dizzy episode when you are 33 is probably not a stroke in progress. (It’s not
impossible, though, especially if you are taking birth-control pills and smok-
ing cigarettes.) If you are 67, stroke is a more likely culprit — particularly if
you also have high blood pressure, diabetes, and a history of heart trouble.
If you have a dizzy spell that clears up quickly — and you usually don’t have
them — then you may well be perfectly healthy. However, you might take this
opportunity to assess your stroke risks and be sure you are doing everything
necessary to prevent a stroke. See a doctor, especially one with a special
interest in stroke.
Migraine headaches
Some migraines start out as strokes. The blood vessels of the brain constrict
so tightly that blood flow is cut off to a part of the brain. The result is very
similar to a stroke caused by a blood clot.
For individuals who’ve never before experienced a migraine headache, the
severity of the symptoms often persuades them to go to the emergency room.
The stroke-like symptoms usually fade and are followed by an incredibly
painful headache. Those who periodically suffer from migraines are familiar
with the feeling and can usually distinguish an ordinary migraine from a stroke.
If this is the first time you’ve had a headache like this, even if you suspect
your sudden excruciating headache is a migraine rather than a stroke, go to
the hospital to make sure it isn’t some type of red stroke. Read more about
headaches and stroke in Chapter 6.
Seizure
A seizure is one symptom of epilepsy, a convulsion involving a massive
uncontrolled discharge of nerve impulses from all or part of the brain that
causes muscles to jerk back and forth. Usually a person having a seizure
loses consciousness.
76
Part II: Types of Stroke 

However, there are times when only a small part of the brain loses control. In
that case, only one limb may jerk back and forth. Sometimes the jerking is not
as noticeable. When the seizure is over, the brain is completely exhausted
and may not function for several minutes. Occasionally the brain doesn’t get
itself together for an hour or two. In the meantime, there may be temporary
paralysis on one side of the body or another, one arm or leg. The result can
be numbness, tingling, or weakness, just like a small stroke. Seizures may be
caused by a number of factors unrelated to stroke: an old head injury, a
tumor, a viral infection. In young children, they can even be the result of a
sudden spike in temperature.
People can have a seizure in their sleep and not remember it. When they
wake up or someone else finds them, all they may see is the paralysis from
the seizure. Even during the day the seizure that causes the paralysis may
not be witnessed by bystanders or remembered by the person who has just
had a seizure. The person having a seizure isn’t a reliable witness. He or she
can’t tell a stroke from a seizure, and who’s to say someone with epilepsy
can’t have a stroke? Watch for shaking if you suspect a seizure, but go to an
emergency room to see what’s causing the problem.
Diabetes
If you are diabetic and take insulin to convert glucose into energy, you may
experience stroke-like symptoms if you’ve taken too much insulin or some
other medication to lower your blood glucose. At blood glucose levels below
80, your brain will begin to show symptoms. You will usually have the telltale
symptoms of an insulin reaction: confusion, sweating, hunger, dizziness, con-
fusion, and numbness or tingling of the lips.
If you don’t have or don’t heed these warning signs soon enough to get some
sugar into your system, your brain may begin to shut down. Though you might
expect the brain to turn off everywhere at once, only one part of the brain may
in fact shut down. The symptoms may be paralysis on one side of the body 
or inability to speak or comprehend language that looks just like a stroke. It
doesn’t happen often, but every stroke specialist will tell you about a case
that he or she was sure was a stroke until the blood glucose came back as 45,
and the symptoms cleared up with the rapid infusion of glucose.
Sometimes the symptoms of low blood sugar can mimic a stroke by occurring
on just one side of the body. Most stroke symptoms affect one side of the
body or the other. Either way, your symptoms should clear rapidly when you
drink some orange juice or other sugared drink. Otherwise, regardless of the
cause of your symptoms, call for an ambulance. An insulin reaction is a life-
threatening situation.
77
Chapter 4: Transient Stroke (TIA): Warning Sign

Responding to a Transient Stroke
You’re lucky if your first stroke is transient. Some people experience a series
of transient strokes, each similar to the last. This can go on for weeks or
months. It’s unusual, though. More often, a transient stroke is followed by a
full-blown stroke that causes permanent disability.
If you take one thing from this chapter, make it this: Transient stroke is a warn-
ing sign. If you have a transient stroke, you are very likely to have another
more serious stroke in the future. It’s possible that a full-blown stroke could
occur as early as 24 hours later. If you have a transient stroke, even if you feel
completely normal, you must do something! You must immediately get yourself
evaluated to find out what caused the stroke.
Get medical attention now
You had a close call. Your stroke lasted for a few minutes, then cleared. You
were fortunate. But you may not be so fortunate next time. If you were really
attuned to the importance of stroke, you would already have called 911 with-
out waiting to see if your stroke was going to clear on its own. The ambulance
is already on the way and will take you to the emergency department. If you
have delayed, then start acting now to take advantage of the warning your
transient stroke has given you.
The problem is that not everywhere is set up to treat transient strokes as
emergencies. It can be hard to take get others to pay attention to your prob-
lem. You can ask your emergency room whether they have an emergency pro-
tocol for stroke.
The majority of stroke experts now believe that you should be admitted to
the hospital the first time you have a transient stroke (TIA). In the hospital,
you should be quickly evaluated so that any treatment you require can be
started right away before you have another stroke that leaves you disabled.
In the ideal situation, you have your condition rapidly evaluated by stroke
specialists and are admitted to the hospital. Some hospitals can run the tests
you need while you are in the emergency room. In addition to blood tests,
these would include a CT or MRI scan, a carotid ultrasound test, and an 
electrocardiogram.
Your other medical conditions and medications you are taking would be eval-
uated. Your history of stomach ulcers and other bleeding problems would be
considered because that may influence whether you are given aspirin or a
substitute. If you weren’t already taking aspirin, then you might be started on
aspirin. You would be given instructions on the symptoms of stroke and told
to call 911 immediately if the symptoms returned.
78
Part II: Types of Stroke 

If you aren’t satisfied with the way things go in the emergency room, then try
calling your physician’s emergency number. Ask to be seen in the emergency
room to be evaluated for stroke or TIA. If he/she says to come into the office
in the morning, say you are worried about a stroke in the meantime. Ask if a
stroke expert can be called in to see you or to talk to you on the phone.
If you are standing there reading this while your significant other is browsing
travel books, and you are figuring out that you just had a transient stroke
four days ago, then you need to know you have an opportunity here to pre-
vent a real disaster. We are not talking about your car or your house, but your
brain and your life as you know it.
Checklist for your check-up
Whether you get to an emergency room after your transient stroke or are
able to see your physician immediately, you’ll want to be sure that certain
tests are considered and relevant health issues are addressed.
Here are the basics to consider:
 Blood pressure: Your blood pressure should be checked to see if it
needs treatment or if treatment is effective.
 Atrial fibrillation: You should be checked for atrial fibrillation, a condi-
tion in which your heart pumps irregularly, causing ineffective blood
flow, pooling of blood, and clots inside the heart that can break free and
cause a white stroke. This check requires an EKG. (See Chapter 8 for
more on this.)
79
Chapter 4: Transient Stroke (TIA): Warning Sign
Be proactive in getting treated
There are always scary stories in the newspa-
pers and medical journals. One study recently
suggested that even if you go to an emergency
room, there’s no guarantee that you will leave
with the best recommendations. If you are sent
home without being told whether you should be
taking medication to prevent stroke, you might
want to get to another physician more inter-
ested in stroke.
Because you are essentially “back to normal”
after a transient stroke, it may be hard for 
emergency-room doctors who are responding
to serious and urgent medical trauma to per-
ceive your problem as critical. It is critical, how-
ever, and if you don’t get the attention you
require, you could be back in the emergency
room sooner rather than later. Insist on getting
the attention immediately — and don’t stop until
you get it.

 Cholesterol levels: Your cholesterol levels should be read. If you have
high cholesterol, you are a candidate for atherosclerosis — the condition
in which plaques form inside your blood vessels. (Several chapters in
this book address this topic. Check out Chapters 9 and 10.)
 Listen to the neck: The doctor should listen to your neck with a stetho-
scope in order to determine whether you have an audible bruit in your
neck that is a sign of a large carotid atherosclerosis plaque. Surgical
removal of the plaque may reduce your risk of stroke. The doctor may
not do this if an ultrasound test is going to be done immediately.
 Carotid ultrasound: The carotid artery in your neck should be checked
to see if it is partially obstructed by a thick atherosclerotic plaque.
 CT or MRI scans: A CT or MRI scan is advised. This may reveal brain
infarctions and injuries, indications that you have had brain infarction
previously and not known it, or perhaps that your transient stroke
wasn’t as transient as you thought it was.
 Heart exam: Your transient stroke may be a sign that you have serious
heart disease. A doctor should examine your heart as well.
 Blood tests: These are to check your blood glucose level and other tests
to determine the cause of your symptoms. The clotting status of your
blood will be evaluated as well.
Preventing the “Big One”
Once you’ve had the work-up following your transient stroke, you may have
confirmed some stroke risk issues that you can now address more effectively.
Perhaps you learned that you have atrial fibrillation, high cholesterol, heart
disease — or maybe other conditions were detected that require follow-up.
In any case, now that you know you’re at high risk for another stroke — one
that might be permanent and disabling — it’s high time to decide whether
you are going to use this opportunity to take steps to reduce your risk.
Avoiding blood clots with medication
Perhaps the most important step after a transient stroke is to determine
whether you should be taking aspirin or another drug to slow down your
blood’s tendency to form blood clots that cause strokes. If you have an ulcer
or stomach problems, that’s no reason not to treat your clotting risk. Aspirin
is known to aggravate stomach problems, but there are other drugs that are
as effective as aspirin in preventing clotting. Clinical trials have shown time
80
Part II: Types of Stroke 

and again that aspirin and other similar drugs reduce the number of strokes
in patients who have had a transient stroke. See Chapter 8 for more details
about aspirin and other medications that reduce the risk of clotting.
Considering surgery
For some, surgery is the best way to prevent a follow-up stroke after transient
stroke or a small white stroke. If you have a thick plaque (atherosclerosis)
blocking one of the carotid arteries to your brain, then you may benefit from
having the plaque surgically removed if the plaque is in the portion of the
artery in your neck. Surgery has its risks: There’s a 2 to 5 percent chance that
you could have a major stroke during the procedure. But several clinical
trials support that the odds are in your favor if you have the surgery.
Clinical trials have shown that the thicker the plaque, the more you have to
gain from surgery. The thickness of the plaque is measured in terms of the
percentage of blood flow that is blocked. The blockage is called stenosis, or
narrowing of the blood vessel. If your carotid artery stenosis is more than 50
percent, then surgery is probably beneficial if you have just had a transient
stroke. If it is more than 70 percent, the benefits are greater. For lower
degrees of stenosis, less than 50 percent, surgery is not usually helpful.
The risks of surgery are serious stroke and even death. The percentages are
low, but after a TIA you are completely normal. Be sure you have a clear
understanding of the risks and want to go ahead. It’s a little like seatbelts in a
car. In most accidents, they will protect you. In a small percentage of cases,
they may cause more harm than good.
The surgical procedure to remove a carotid plaque is called carotid
endarterectomy. It is one of the most common stroke-related surgical proce-
dures done. But, as always with major surgery — especially when it involves
the brain — it’s important to consider your decision carefully. Whatever the
degree of stenosis, you should get a second opinion and find out about the
track record and success of the surgeon making the recommendation.
Should you choose to proceed with surgery, be sure to verify that your sur-
geon is experienced with the procedure. Ideally, you would like a surgeon
who does dozens of these procedures every year. The surgeon should also be
able to tell you the percentage of patients who have a stroke or die within 30
days of the surgery. This percentage should be less than 5 percent. This may
seem high — keep in mind that it is not the result of poor surgical technique,
but the fragile medical condition of many patients. Remember that for patients
with a large plaque and a history of transient stroke, the percentage who
have a stroke without surgery is much higher at one year than those who 
did have surgery.

Chapter 4: Transient Stroke (TIA): Warning Sign

Stents: An alternative to surgery
You might be advised to consider stents instead of surgery. Stents are devices
that can be placed inside your carotid artery to hold it open. This alternative
to surgery is relatively new and still being tested in clinical trials. To some,
stents are appealing because there’s no scar on your neck. That doesn’t seem
to me like a good reason to choose how to protect your brain from stroke.
Placing stents is not free of serious problems, however. The stent procedure
can cause strokes, just as surgery can. There are devices that are supposed
to keep blood clots and pieces of plaque from breaking loose and flying up to
the brain while the stent is being placed, but there is only limited evidence
that they work as advertised. There is more information on surgery and
stents in Chapter 8.
A reminder list
There are many steps you can take to reduce your risk of future stroke.
Chapters 8–10 explore many of them in detail. But here’s a reminder list of
the most important preventive measures that will arm you in your war
against stroke.
 Monitor your blood pressure.
 Stop smoking.
 Lower your cholesterol — through diet and/or statin drugs.
 Thin your blood if you have atrial fibrillation.
 If you’ve had a stroke, even a transient stroke, take aspirin or a substi-
tute daily if your doctor agrees.
 Prevent diabetes if you don’t have it, treat it to the max if you do.
Answering the Wake-Up Call
When a transient stroke happens, you can think of numerous excuses for not
doing anything. It could be this. It could be that. You’re just tired. You’re
upset because of something and if you just settle down, everything will be
okay. You’ll call your daughter — she always knows what to do.
We all make excuses and hope something terrible will just go away. Sometimes
it does. But often it doesn’t. It’s your brain. Your life of memories, your love,
your personality, your get-up-and-go. Take action when you need to. Don’t be
fooled by one lucky turn of fate.
82
Part II: Types of Stroke 

A transient stroke is like the red engine light on your car that blinks on while
you are driving. The car is running fine — the road is smooth ahead. There
hasn’t been any other sign of trouble. Maybe the red light is malfunctioning?
Unlikely.
Isn’t it amazing that people actually burn up their car’s engines? I wonder
what they tell themselves. “I thought I could make it to work.” “I didn’t want
to stop on the interstate.” “If I stopped, I would be late.”
If you have a transient stroke and keep on driving, you’re taking a good chance
of burning up the engine of your life. A transient stroke is a red light — a seri-
ous warning that you have problems. You can ignore the opportunity and
very likely live to regret it. On the other hand, there are relatively simple
actions you can take that will greatly increase the likelihood that you will live
a longer and better life.

R
ed strokes are the opposite of white strokes. White strokes are caused
by blood clots in the brain arteries, but red strokes are caused by bleed-
ing of the brain arteries. The two types of red stroke are differentiated by
where the bleeding starts. One type involves bleeding in the areas surround-
ing the brain, called subarachnoid hemorrhage or aneurysm; this type of
stroke is dealt with in Chapter 6.
This chapter covers the other type — called brain hemorrhage or intracere-
bral hemorrhage (ICH), which occurs when the bleeding is within the brain
itself. I prefer the less technical term brain hemorrhage. Brain hemorrhage
produces the same signs and symptoms as a white stroke. This includes
paralysis of the face, arm, or leg on one side of the body, difficulty speaking
or understanding speech, loss of sensation on part of one side of the body,
dizziness, and clumsiness in the use of the arms or legs. However, a red stroke
caused by brain hemorrhage often continues to get worse as the minutes and
hours pass, eventually progressing to coma in many cases. A typical white
stroke, on the other hand, stays the same or even improves on its own during
the first few hours and coma occurs much less often.
Brain hemorrhages are more often fatal and cause more severe disability than
the more common white ischemic stroke. The chances of someone dying in
the first few days after a brain hemorrhage (ICH) are about 40 percent —
double the rate for white strokes, which is about 20 percent. This is primarily
because of the catastrophic consequences of brain swelling that accompa-
nies brain hemorrhage.

Victims of brain hemorrhage are typically between 55 and 60 years old —
younger than those who suffer from white strokes. The good news is brain
hemorrhage is a less common type of stroke, striking approximately 15 per-
cent of all stroke sufferers. This equates to an estimated 70,000 individuals
each year in the United States.
In this chapter, I identify the causes of brain hemorrhage, explain how the
brain reacts to bleeding, review a variety of treatments for this type of red
stroke, and, finally, cover steps to prevent further brain hemorrhage.
Although white strokes and red strokes result from different causes, the same
advice for preventing white strokes applies to this type of red stroke. Prepare
yourself now — you’ll be reading a lot about high blood pressure and the
importance of getting it in check. (If you want to escape that altogether, try
one of the chapters on nursing homes or rehabilitation. I think I only mention
it in passing there.)
High blood pressure, among other factors, can increase your risk of brain
hemorrhage.
I would hope that, by now, it’s understood that at the first sign of stroke, you
should call 911. It is critical to get to the ER as soon as possible. Early arrival
allows the stroke team to do a better job of controlling your blood pressure,
containing your brain swelling, and keeping you breathing if you lose con-
sciousness. The earlier you receive treatment for brain hemorrhage, the
better your odds of reducing disability — and surviving. 
The CT scan shown in Figure 5-1 shows a medium-sized brain hemorrhage
that started on the patient’s left side (remember, right and left are reversed
on the CT scan) and pressed the brain to the patient’s right across the front-
to-back midline. Those bright white spots in the ventricles are normal
deposits of hard calcium. The gray-colored brain has also swollen to press a
little more tightly against the white-colored bony skull on the left side: You
see fewer of the usual convolutions of the brain, which typically appear as
distinct creases on a CT scan. This is because they have been squeezed flat
against the skull.
Why the Brain Bleeds
High blood pressure — particularly longstanding high blood pressure — is
the leading cause of brain hemorrhages, being responsible for nearly half.
Still, that leaves many other possible causes. Unlike white stroke, which is
almost always caused by blood clots blocking arteries and reduced blood
flow, brain hemorrhage may be the result of anything from abnormal blood
vessels to a bladder infection. Sometimes the cause may be clear — in other
cases, it’s a mystery until further testing can be done. If a patient survives
86
Part II: Types of Stroke 

the initial hours of the brain hemorrhage, a variety of tests may be done to
determine why the stroke occurred.
Longstanding high blood pressure
Over the years, high blood pressure, particularly if aggravated by diabetes,
wears out and weakens the walls of small blood vessels deep inside the brain.
These vessels are connected directly to high-pressure mainline arteries to
the brain. They are exposed to greater stresses than other small blood ves-
sels in the brain. After years of strain, the blood vessels develop dilapidated,
patched, and repatched walls. In some places the vessels are so weak, they
form tiny blebs that can easily break under high pressure.
87
Chapter 5: Red Stroke (ICH): Bleeding Inside the Brain
A fatal brain hemorrhage
A 62-year-old successful businessman was
dancing at his youngest daughter’s wedding. He
had been diagnosed with high blood pressure
and took his medication infrequently. (No one
could verify whether he took the medication the
day of the wedding.) While he was dancing, he
noticed a headache and sat down for a rest.
Gradually the headache got worse. Someone
noticed that he was speaking abnormally. He
reached for a drink of water and spilled it on the
table and floor. When he tried to stand up, he
found that he couldn’t and lost his balance.
Some thought he just had too much alcohol to
drink. His oldest daughter, a nurse, recognized
that he was having a stroke. She called 911. The
ambulance EMTs started him on an IV and took
him to an emergency room. 
In the ER, it was noticed that his right arm and
leg were very weak. He spoke, but the words
were garbled and did not make sense. He was
drowsy. His blood pressure was 220/160. He
was given medication to lower it. Blood tests
were ordered. The stroke team got a history
from the family. One of the daughters was a
physician. She was very concerned because
the hospital did not have all the resources of 
a major big-city hospital. Other physicians,
including a neurology specialist, were called in.
Meanwhile, the patient lost consciousness. 
The specialist ordered a CT scan while the
family discussed transferring the patient to
another hospital. The scan showed a large ball
of blood on the left side, centered deep in the
middle of the brain. The blood had gotten into
the ventricles of the brain. Already, swelling on
the left side of the brain was pushing across the
midline into the right brain. When the physician
daughter saw this, she knew the story was over.
The patient had been placed on a respirator and
was being prepared for the intensive care unit.
His breathing alternated between slow and fast.
Soon he stopped breathing on his own and the
ventilator began breathing for him. 
In the next few hours, his condition worsened
as his coma deepened and his brain stopped
functioning. He had told his family he never
wanted to be kept alive for a prolonged time
when there was little or no chance he would
survive. The immediate family, all gathered at
the hospital, asked that he be taken off of life
support. He died about eight hours after the first
signs of his stroke.

Blebs? Yes, blebs. Blebs are little blisters on the walls of these blood vessels,
about the size of the head of a pin. These tiny blebs are also called micro-
aneurysms, but they are not to be confused with the much larger berry
aneurysms that cause subarachnoid hemorrhage, the type of red stroke 
discussed in Chapter 6.
If blebs break, blood pours out of the ruptured artery. The extensive damage
that can be done by blood gushing out of one of these pencil-lead-thin arteries
is amazing. It shows how hard the arteries work to contain the pressure. Think
about that the next time you consider skipping your blood pressure pills.
When white stroke leads to red stroke
What starts out as a white stroke caused by a blood clot blocking an artery
can turn into a red stroke with bleeding into the brain. Most experts think
this happens because the brain blood vessels are injured when their blood
supply is cut off by a blood clot upstream. The vessels are starving for glu-
cose and oxygen. When they don’t come in time, the vessels begin to fall
apart. Then later — perhaps hours or even a day or two — the blocking clot

may be cleared by the normal processes that keep blood vessels free of clots
and wide open for the flow of blood. Then the blood rushes from the site of
the clot that caused the white stroke into blood vessels that have been weak-
ened and injured by lack of glucose and oxygen. Sometimes the vessel walls
are so weak they can’t contain the new rush of blood. This brain bleeding can
worsen the original white stroke disability and can be fatal. This process is
called hemorrhagic conversion of a white ischemic stroke. It happens more
often when your blood is thinned with a drug like warfarin, heparin, or TPA.
Medication that thins the blood
It seems ironic that trying to prevent a white stroke can cause a red stroke,
but warfarin and heparin, two drugs used to slow down blood clotting for suf-
ferers of white stroke, must be carefully monitored. Blood tests must be done
regularly to be sure that blood clotting isn’t slowed down too much. But even
when the clotting time is acceptable, brain hemorrhages can occur. Heparin
is mostly used in the hospital since it must be dripped into a vein. Warfarin
(also called Coumadin) is taken when you are not in the hospital.
I don’t think anyone is exactly sure how the hemorrhages start. Perhaps there
are tiny breaks in the blood vessels all the time that are repaired rapidly by
the clotting mechanism. When blood clotting is too slow, these tiny leaks
become larger until they are too large to contain. Perhaps it is like the first
trickle over the top of an earthen dam that quickly washes the dam away.
Although there are treatments that help reverse the effects of warfarin and
heparin, often the damage from hemorrhage is done before the effects can be
reversed.
Should you risk treating white stroke with a drug that could lead to red
stroke? Probably. Clinical trials have shown that the odds are still in your
favor if you take warfarin when you have atrial fibrillation, a condition that
can lead to white stroke (see Chapter 8 for more details), even though it does
increase risk of brain hemorrhage. The potential benefits outweigh the risks.
When dealing with something as serious as stroke, most people are willing to
take greater risks. A closely monitored drug and treatment strategy ought to
balance the benefits with the risks.
If you are on Warfarin or Heparin to treat white stroke, you’re wise to keep 
an eye on your blood-clotting time through frequent blood tests. Don’t miss
scheduled blood tests, and let your doctor know if you change medications
or notice any change in bruising so that extra tests can be scheduled. You
should also watch your diet to avoid sudden changes in the amounts of foods
with vitamin K and in the timing of your eating relative to when you take 
your medication. Also be careful when you change any other medications,
because stopping or starting a drug and changing your diet can affect blood
clotting time.

Chapter 5: Red Stroke (ICH): Bleeding Inside the Brain

Blood-vessel abnormalities
Have you seen people with large, red patches or birthmarks on their skin?
Those are caused by abnormal blood vessels. Sometimes they can enlarge,
but other than their appearance, they cause no problems. Abnormal blood
vessels can also occur in the brain. They are more problematic. The knots
and tangles of arteries and veins, which can become quite large, are inter-
twined in the substance of the brain. Because they are abnormal, they often
have weak walls that tend to break and bleed. Some never bleed.
One of the most common blood-vessel abnormalities, arteriovenous malfor-
mations or AVMs, are formed from brain arteries and veins. Brain bleeding
from AVMs is generally not as severe as the more common type of brain hem-
orrhage from a broken artery. High blood pressure increases the risk that an
AVM will bleed, but they often bleed when the blood pressure is normal.
You should know that many specialists recommend that you do nothing at all
to get rid of an AVM. In fact, an AVM may bleed several times before some
doctors think it is worth the risk to treat them. They are quite rare, and not
all of them cause brain hemorrhages. Some cause epileptic seizures, as well,
but that is for another book.
90
Part II: Types of Stroke 
What to do about AVMs?
Testing for AVMs requires MRI scans or a pro-
cedure called an arteriogram or angiogram. A
large needle is poked in the groin, a spaghetti-
sized hollow plastic tube is threaded into a main
brain artery, and the brain is blasted with a spe-
cial contrast agent through this tube to make
the AVM light up on an X-ray. The pictures show
all the blood vessels at once and reveal a lot of
detail that is needed to figure out the best way
to treat the AVM.
Some specialists recommend doing nothing to
treat the AVM. Others recommend brain
surgery, radiation therapy, or blocking off the
AVM from inside the blood vessels — or a com-
bination of these. We really don’t have evidence
from good clinical trials to help you decide
about treatment of AVMs. You will have to go by
the recommendations of your physicians.
Any of these procedures present risks, and
there are frequent complications. A patient who
is advised to undergo any of the treatments
should seek out a second — or even third —
opinion. If you choose to proceed, confirm that
the surgeon or radiologist has experience with
this procedure successfully. I would suggest
going with the most experienced surgeon you
can find. The AVM may be treated during the
same hospitalization as the brain hemorrhage
or after the patient is transferred to a more com-
prehensive stroke treatment center.

Infections from tooth to bladder
On occasion, something as seemingly unrelated as a bladder infection or the
infection resulting from a dental procedure can lead to a brain hemorrhage.
Some infections can get into the blood, where the bacteria grow and are car-
ried to the heart and valves. The infected blood can collect in clumps in the
smallest blood vessels in the brain. Lodged there, the infection continues to
multiply and eats away at the blood vessel walls, potentially breaking through
to cause a hemorrhage. Usually, though, the brain can contain the hemorrhage,
and a relatively small hemorrhage is the result.
It is important to determine whether a hemorrhage is caused by bacteria,
because antibiotics will cure the problem. If a stroke victim survives, the
antibiotic should clear up the infection and eliminate the risk of future brain
hemorrhages. Without antibiotic, more hemorrhages and serious infection
can develop in the brain. Simple blood and urine tests can determine
whether infection is the cause of a brain hemorrhage.
Other causes of brain hemorrhage
As I said earlier, brain hemorrhage claims a lot more causes than white stroke
does. Here are several others that doctors may test for:
 Aging of blood vessels: When some people get to be more than 70 years
old, their brain arteries are weakened by a rubbery substance deposited
among the muscle fibers of the artery wall. The substance is called amy-
loid (AM uh loyd), and the weakening of the artery wall is called amyloid
angiopathy (ann jee OPP uh thee). Bleeding from these weakened arter-
ies is usually near the top surface of the brain. It is probably the second
most common cause of brain hemorrhage.
 Tumors in the brain: Tumors growing in the brain may go unnoticed
until they start bleeding and cause a stroke. The tumor itself may be
hidden within all the blood. If it is a small tumor, it may not be noticed in
the emergency room — after all, the ER team is more focused on treating
the stroke and keeping the patient alive until the bleeding stops. Later,
as doctors try to figure out what caused the brain hemorrhage, further
testing may reveal what remains of the tumor.
Surviving a brain hemorrhage only to find a brain tumor is not a happy
series of events. However, it may turn out that the tumor is entirely
treatable. So it’s important to explore this possibility.
91
Chapter 5: Red Stroke (ICH): Bleeding Inside the Brain

 Cocaine and stimulant drugs: The use of cocaine and stimulant drugs is
associated with a higher incidence of brain hemorrhage. Some hemor-
rhages may occur because of sudden increases in blood pressure associ-
ated with the drug; others, by some type of reaction of the brain blood
vessels to the drug.
 Blood-clotting deficiencies: People who have conditions such as hemo-
philia, leukemia, cancer, and liver failure also have abnormally slow clot-
ting of the blood, making them more prone to brain hemorrhages. And
because the blood doesn’t clot normally, these brain hemorrhages are
usually more serious and more often fatal.
 Extremely high blood pressure: A sudden and severe increase in blood
pressure is called a hypertensive crisis. The lower of the two blood pres-
sures (the diastolic pressure) goes over 120. The longer the blood pres-
sure stays up, and the higher it is, the greater the risk that a brain artery
will rupture under the strain. The result is bleeding into the brain. The
most common cause of hypertensive crisis is an unexplained sudden
blood pressure increase in someone who already has high blood pres-
sure. Suddenly stopping some of the less common blood pressure med-
ications like clonidine can precipitate a crisis. Hypertensive crisis also
can occur during pregnancy as part of the problem called eclampsia.
 Red strokes due to subarachnoid bleeding: As explained in Chapter 6,
subarachnoid hemorrhage is when bleeding occurs in the fluid surround-
ing the brain. Occasionally, this bleeding occurs in such a way that the
jet of blood goes into the brain. Subarachnoid hemorrhage caused by
rupture of a blood vessel outside the brain is much worse if it is accom-
panied by bleeding into the brain.
 Head trauma: If you bang your head hard enough, all the padding and
fluid cushions that protect the brain will fail. The result can be a few
tiny, torn vessels deep in the brain. Or it can be a brain destroyed by a
skull-crushing blow. Brain trauma is not a stroke, so I don’t discuss it in
this book.
Because this book, to a certain extent, is like a brain owner’s manual, I can’t
help but say to you that brain hemorrhage occurs a lot more often than most
people realize. Over the years, all the bumps on the head and resulting minor
hemorrhages begin to accumulate. So, wear a helmet when you are supposed
to and buckle your seatbelts when you are driving.
How the Brain Reacts to Blood
The brain hates blood that isn’t where it is supposed to be. And when blood
gets outside of brain blood vessels, by whatever means, the brain reacts
strongly. Although eventually the bleeding stops on its own as the clotting
process kicks in, the repercussions can be extremely destructive. In this sec-
tion I list some of the challenges.
92
Part II: Types of Stroke 

Brain swelling
Blood gushing from an artery into the substance of the brain makes it swell
up just like any bruise under the skin or in a muscle. The extra blood alone
causes the brain to swell. But the reaction also causes white blood cells to
release special chemicals to respond to the blood. More white blood cells are
drawn to the area. The blood vessels in the surrounding area begin to leak
fluid around the blood clot. Injured brain cells also leak fluid into the sub-
stance of the brain. The result is that the brain swells even more as it reacts
to the release of blood within the brain.
Often on CT or MRI scans, you can see a darker area around the white area of
hemorrhage. This darker area represents a part of the brain that is swollen
and filled with water (mostly) as a result of the brain’s response to the blood.
This extra water filling the brain is called edema. You may notice a little dark
rim around the white clot areas in the brain CT scan shown back in Figure
5-1. The more blood in the brain, the more brain edema is produced.
Pressure mounts, blood flow stops
The problem with all this swelling is that the brain is trapped inside the skull.
If the brain swells, then something else has to shrink. For a while this can be
the clear fluid around the brain and in brain ventricles. But if the brain con-
tinues to swell, something else has to give.
As bleeding continues to increase the size of the brain inside the skull, the
pressure in the skull goes up. It’s as if the brain is pushing against the skull
and all the holes in it. As the brain pushes out, the heart has a harder time
pushing the blood into the skull. If the pressure gets too high, the heart will
fail to push enough blood into the brain to sustain brain function. 
This is a total disaster. First, the brain shuts down, leading to unconsciousness.
Then before too many minutes, the brain starts to die from lack of blood flow.
Sometimes there is so much blood and swelling in the brain that nothing
works. Within a few minutes or hours, death occurs. Fortunately, in most
cases, either the pressure doesn’t get so high that blood flow stops, or the
pressure inside the skull can be controlled so that blood flow continues.
Deforming the brain
The swelling from the bleeding happens on just one side of the brain, but the
imbalance in pressure squeezes against the side of the brain that is not bleed-
ing. If you look carefully back in Figure 5-1, you can see in the center of the
skull where the blood (which appears as the white splotch on the right) has
pushed the right side of the brain into the left side and deformed it.
The brain is flexible only to a certain extent. The spinal cord and nerves at the
base of the brain still have to exit from the holes in the skull. They can stretch
a little, but they pull back on the brain as it is deformed by the pressure. The
93
Chapter 5: Red Stroke (ICH): Bleeding Inside the Brain

brain can actually push part of itself down into the space in the neck where
the spinal cord usually is.
There are a few really tight places where vital brain structures that keep a
person alive and breathing are squeezed so hard that the nerve cells are
crushed and torn. The victim loses consciousness, but this time because of
actual physical injury to the brain. Injuries to the base of the brain are not
easy to fix, and they are the most common cause of death for patients with
brain hemorrhage.
Unconsciousness
Sleep is good. Unconsciousness is bad. Unconsciousness is due to a failure of
vital structures in the brain to respond to stimuli that would ordinarily keep
someone alert. There are different degrees of unconsciousness, but in the
deepest levels of coma, the brain is not able to keep the lungs breathing. The
patient may easily choke and becomes more prone to infections. Obviously,
people in this state cannot feed themselves.
Here come the tubes. Tubes to help you eat, tubes to help you breathe, and
tubes to help you eliminate waste. As more and more of the brain is perma-
nently injured by brain hemorrhage and swelling, the closer a patient comes to
brain death — the vegetative state that most of us consider to be unacceptable.
It’s hard to predict whether someone who remains unconscious and accumu-
lates brain injury will survive and recover. If the hemorrhage is unusually
large, if there is blood in the ventricles, if the person is very old, if there is
shift of the brain across the midline, then meaningful survival is unlikely.
Overuse of technology can certainly keep people “alive” — even if they have
no chance of meaningful life after the brain swelling is brought under control.
Treating Brain Hemorrhage 
in the Hospital
Treating bleeding inside the brain is difficult. The bleeding is tightly enclosed
in the skull where broken blood vessels can’t easily be reached. Even if a sur-
geon cuts through the skull, the source of the bleeding is usually farther
inside the brain itself. Eventually the bleeding stops on its own — by clot for-
mation and increasing pressure inside the skull. But doctors must deal with
the effects of the bleeding, including brain swelling and unconsciousness and
other conditions that may slow the clotting process.
94
Part II: Types of Stroke 

Hyperventilating to reduce brain swelling
The goal of medical treatment for brain swelling is to keep the blood flowing
and to control the swelling so that the brain doesn’t crush itself. Serious
brain swelling means the sufferer is already unconscious and a machine is
breathing for him or her.
It is remarkable but true that during hyperventilation the brain shrinks.
Someone on a ventilator machine is given drugs that paralyze the muscles
and keep the patient from fighting to control breathing. By simply setting the
ventilator to go a little faster than normal, the patient can be forced to hyper-
ventilate, and, hence, the brain shrinks. But there are certainly risks to this
tactic. Lots of expensive blood tests have to be done to control the breathing
once the brain is no longer being allowed to do that.
Using drugs to reduce brain swelling
Another way to reduce swelling in the bleeding brain is the use of drugs.
Mannitol, barbiturates, and steroids are all drugs that can help reduce
swelling. Like hyperventilation, though, they only work for a while, and then
only produce a relatively small effect. But a small amount of extra space in
the skull at a critical time can save a life.
Brain drain
Increased pressure inside the skull is more of a mechanical problem than a
medical one. However, it is a difficult mechanical problem, and MRI and CT
scans are needed to map out the best solutions. One surgical treatment
physicians may consider in order to bring down swelling is to place a tube in
the brain to drain the fluids.
In some cases of brain hemorrhage, blood breaks through into the ventricles
of the brain. It’s bad news if this happens, for several reasons. For one thing,
when the blood in the ventricles clots, it blocks the usual flow of the fluid
from one ventricle to another and eventually out of the brain into the space
around the brain and spinal cord where it is absorbed. In the CT scan shown
in Figure 5-1, three of the four ventricle spaces are filled with blood (it’s really
red or reddish black, but on the CT scan it looks white).
If the blood clots and prevents the escape of the fluid out of the ventricles of
the brain, pressure builds up, and the ventricles expand. As you might imag-
ine, this isn’t good. Fortunately, there is a relatively easy way to deal with
95
Chapter 5: Red Stroke (ICH): Bleeding Inside the Brain

this. A surgeon can drill a hole in the skull and press a soft plastic tube through
the brain and into a ventricle to relieve that pressure. This is called a ventricu-
lostomy, and it can potentially cause infection and more bleeding. Neither is
good — but sometimes there isn’t much choice.
Removing the clot: Risky business
Well, you may say, if it’s so easy to put a tube in the ventricle and relieve the
pressure by draining fluid, then why not put a tube in the clot and let the
blood escape? Believe me, it’s been tried. Problem is, it’s just not clear
whether it helps or hurts.
The blood doesn’t stay fluid very long. Contact with the substance of the
brain tends to make it clot quickly.
So when a surgeon puts a tube in the center of the bloody area, blood doesn’t
gush out like the clear fluid from the ventricles. Sucking the blood out with
vacuum pressure doesn’t work that well either. Attempts to dissolve the clot
before sucking it out through a tube have not been very successful in saving
lives or reducing disability. Nevertheless, when things are not going well, some
neurosurgeons are willing to accept high risks rather than do nothing at all.
Another approach is to open up a larger hole in the skull and expose the clot.
This is easy to do on smaller brain hemorrhages near the surface — not so
manageable for deep hemorrhages, such as shown in Figure 5-1. Once the clot
is exposed, the surgeon can remove it and stop any bleeding. This approach
has its problems, too. For one thing, clots near the surface are often those
caused by bleeding from old blood vessels weakened by amyloid angiopathy.
They bleed easily — so this process can actually make the problem worse.
Also, there is some potentially good brain mixed in with the clot. You can’t
always remove the clot without injuring some brain.
There is one situation in which surgical removal of the clot can be beneficial.
If the bleeding is in the cerebellum (refer to Chapter 2’s Figure 2-2), a brain
hemorrhage can be rapidly fatal, because a large clot here presses the brain
against a sharp edge that cuts into vital brain areas that keep someone alive.
Emergency surgery in this somewhat rare situation can be life-saving.
All in all, except for the larger hemorrhages in the cerebellum, surgical removal
of a blood clot in the brain is pretty dicey. Some surgeons claim they can
make things better in specific situations. Often, the situation is so dire that
the family and other doctors may think taking any chance is better than
having no chance at all. In other cases, the clot may be small and in a place
96
Part II: Types of Stroke 

that’s easy (for a neurosurgeon) to reach. In that case, risk of further injury
seems less, and possible benefits from clot removal may seem worthwhile.
The patient is going to be sound asleep or unconscious, so the neurosurgeon
is going to be talking to someone in the family about the risks and benefits of
doing the surgery. This isn’t a situation in which there is a lot of time to get a
second opinion from another surgeon. If the surgeon at hand is experienced
and thinks it’s worth the risk, then it’s probably wise to go ahead with the
understanding that the surgery could make things worse.
You don’t think I sound convinced? Well, I’m not, and you should know that a
lot of doctors have their doubts about surgical removal of clots.
Reducing blood pressure
High blood pressure causes the bleeding for nearly half the incidents of brain
hemorrhage. Why not just drop the blood pressure? If there is anything doc-
tors are good at, it is raising and lowering blood pressure. But it isn’t that
simple. High blood pressure has benefits as well as disadvantages. We still
don’t have a good way to keep the blood pressure in just the right range, not
too high and not too low.
Slowing the bleeding . . .
When a brain hemorrhage is caused by a blood clot that pushes high-pressure
blood into weakened brain vessels that break, the bleeding can continue
because of the high blood pressure. Most physicians agree that it’s critical to
lower the blood pressure to help slow the bleeding and perhaps reduce the
size of the eventual blood clot.
. . . but strangling the brain
On the other hand, lowering the blood pressure can reduce the amount of
blood going to the brain. The higher blood pressure may be needed to push
harder against the growing pressure inside the skull. If you lower the blood
pressure too much, the brain gets less and less blood flow as the size of the
hemorrhage grows. The whole brain can start to die from lack of oxygen and
glucose in the blood. This isn’t good either, obviously.
Because of the risks, the lowering of blood pressure is done cautiously with
drugs chosen to have a slow and gradual effect. Dropping the blood pressure
suddenly can cause serious problems, so it’s not uncommon for a patient on
such a treatment to be placed in an intensive care unit just to control and
monitor the blood pressure.

Chapter 5: Red Stroke (ICH): Bleeding Inside the Brain

Getting the blood to clot
If your brain is bleeding, you want your blood to clot, and the sooner the
better. So if blood tests show that for some reason the blood isn’t clotting
well, doctors will undoubtedly take steps to fix that. First, they try to deter-
mine why the blood won’t clot. Sometimes, the problem may be a drug —
warfarin, heparin, even aspirin — prescribed to prevent blood clotting. As
mentioned, drugs given to prevent white strokes may cause very serious red
strokes. Other conditions also result in blood-clot problems:
 Kidney failure: Those who are on dialysis sometimes receive heparin to
keep the blood from clotting inside the dialysis machine.
 Liver failure: The liver makes vitamin K, required for healthy clotting. If
the liver is compromised, vitamin K production may be down.
 Cancer: Some cancer drugs reduce the number of blood platelets. These
cells are necessary for clotting.
Medical treatment to increase the ability of the blood to clot is relatively
straightforward. Vitamin K counteracts warfarin or the effects of liver failure.
There are drugs that reverse the effects of heparin. An alternative solution is
to give a special transfusion of blood that contains all the clotting factors. Or
if the problem is a shortage of platelets, platelets can be transfused.
Treating infections
If a brain hemorrhage was caused by an infection in the bloodstream, then it
is likely that massive amounts of antibiotics will be administered along with
treatments for brain swelling and unconsciousness. If the brain recovers well,
the treatment of the blood infection can takes weeks or even months to com-
plete. If a heart valve or implanted device becomes infected, surgery may be
required, though it usually can be postponed until after stroke recovery.
Relying on life support
Keeping someone alive who is deeply unconscious raises complex issues —
not to mention hospital bills. Yet the wonderful capability of modern medi-
cine has saved many folks for long and productive lives.
A stroke patient who has drifted into unconsciousness may require life-support
measures to maintain basic body functions. The family needs to be aware
98
Part II: Types of Stroke 

that after the worst is over, the patient may appear more unconscious than he
or she is. Many treatments in an intensive care unit make it impossible for
someone to move or speak. Because being agitated and awake raises intracra-
nial pressure, patients are sedated while connected to a ventilator. This may
result in a groggy state in which the patient can hear, but may have a hard
time responding. Nurses are usually aware of this and often talk to the
patient. Family members may be encouraged to do the same.
All the tubes and electronic machinery can be frightening. The family may
feel that their loved one is suffering, not realizing that the individual is not
feeling much of anything. Doctors and nurses are used to seeing people in
this condition and know that they can survive with little or no complications.
For this reason, they may seem a little insensitive. But just because the sur-
roundings look like Dr. Frankenstein’s lab doesn’t mean anyone should give
up hope. What really makes a difference is the condition of the brain. No one
should give up hope until the doctor does.
Preventing More Red Strokes
Someone lucky enough to get out of the hospital after a brain hemorrhage
needs to take action to prevent more strokes. A red stroke puts you at
increased risk of white strokes. Here are some preventative measures:
 Treat your blood pressure: It’s your first priority. Remember, longstand-
ing high blood pressure causes nearly half of all brain hemorrhages. This
means check your blood pressure regularly, see the doctor more often,
take medication if appropriate, and make lifestyle changes (diet, exer-
cise) as necessary.
 Monitor your warfarin: If your red stroke was the result of a white
stroke, and you are being treated for white stroke, you want to make
sure that your dosage of warfarin (for reducing blood clotting) is closely
monitored. This may mean more check-ups with your stroke doctor.
 Manage blood lipids, diabetes, and heart disease: High blood pressure
is intimately connected to other blood-related conditions, including high
cholesterol, diabetes, and heart disease. You can read more about this in
Chapter 10. Being healthy may mean giving up favorite pastimes and
taking more pills than you want to. Tough luck. Work hard to live long.

 Treating SAH stroke
 Forecasting SAH stroke
T
his is a tough chapter to write without using the ridiculous tongue-twisters
of medicine, but there is simply no way around them when discussing
this form of red stroke. If I don’t let you in on terms such as subarachnoid hem-
orrhage and aneurysm, you may be lost when you hear doctors talk, I won’t be
able to clearly explain how such strokes occur, you may not be able to under-
stand the situation if you or a loved one suffers from this serious condition. We
just don’t have everyday words to describe the complex goings-on of the brain,
its blood vessels, and the occurrences inside the skull.
So, just be patient and focus on two terms you don’t hear every day. The first
is aneurysm, pronounced “ANN yur ism.” The second is subarachnoid (will you
ever forgive me?), pronounced “sub uh RACK noyd.” For those who know that
arachnoid has something to do with spiders, I can only say that the people
who came up with these terms must have had overactive imaginations.
But doctors soon tire of saying subarachnoid hemorrhage (who wouldn’t?)
and chop it down to SAH. This may not be much help to patients — SAH is as
mysterious as subarachnoid hemorrhage, even if it is easier to say.
Whatever you call it, this form of red stroke — involving bleeding outside the
brain — is the least common of the four major types of stroke, afflicting just
3 percent of all stroke sufferers. Each year, though, some 50,000 people in the
United States suffer a subarachnoid hemorrhage. Though they attack at all
ages, SAH strokes are most common in adults between 55 and 60 — a bit
younger than the average stroke victim.

SAH strokes are some of the most catastrophic events in medicine. About half
the people who have an SAH stroke die, many before they get to the hospital.
The good news: Those who do arrive alive have promising odds. Several
effective treatments support an 80-percent survival rate.
Like other types of stroke, certain behaviors increase the chances of SAH
stroke. So once again, be aware of the importance of not smoking, controlling
blood pressure, and reducing other risk factors.
This chapter examines the cause of SAH stroke, identifies warning signs and
symptoms, reveals treatments, and more.
How SAH Strokes Happen
In order to get a handle on the cause of subarachnoid hemorrhages, let’s
peek beneath the skull to see how the brain fits into its casing and how it is
wired into the circulatory system.
The brain’s brilliant packaging
Even a linebacker’s brain is delicate and fragile. If it wasn’t for excellent pack-
aging, you would have wrecked yours years ago. Fortunately, your brain is
packed neatly inside your skull to protect it for a lifetime of inevitable bumps
on the head.
The double-wrapped brain
First, the surface of the brain is wrapped with a tightly fitting layer of clear
tissue, like plastic wrap. This waterproof jacket covering all the surface
of the brain is called the pia mater. At the base of the brain, behind your
eyes and above the back of your throat, this layer is penetrated by blood 
vessels and nerves.
A second layer of clear tissue is wrapped around the brain and all the blood
vessels and nerves leading to the brain. But this layer is loose. It is called the
arachnoid. The arachnoid presses tight against the leatherlike lining of the
skull called the dura mater. Imagine putting two plastic gloves on your hand —
one bigger than the other; one tight, one loose. That’s what’s inside your head:
a double-wrapped brain positioned loosely inside the skull.
Shock-absorbing fluid
Despite its double wrapping, the brain would still flop around in the skull and
be injured if it wasn’t for this: The space between the two layers of tissue is
filled with approximately one half cup of clear fluid, called cerebrospinal fluid.
102
Part II: Types of Stroke 

That’s right, your brain is floating! (Have you ever thawed ice that had been
frozen inside a container? As the ice melts against the container’s sides, you
can spin the ice because it floats in the small amount of water spread out
against the edges of the container. This is how the brain floats, protected,
inside the skull.) Though it is tethered like a hot air balloon by the blood 
vessels at its base, your brain can sustain quite a bit of jostling because of
this shock-absorbing liquid padding. In fact, this protective fluid covers your
spinal cord as well, extending down all the way to your tailbone.
The space between the two clear layers of membrane is called the subarach-
noid space. (Ah, there’s that term again!) In addition to the fluid, branching
arteries, veins, and nerves run through the subarachnoid space from the skull
into the depths of the brain.
The role of arteries in SAH
Now, as we consider the network of arteries that spread through the sub-
arachnoid space and into the brain, we get closer to understanding how SAH
occurs here.
Your arteries are mighty tough and rubbery. They can stretch to take the
force of your heartbeat, yet contain your blood and deliver it at high pressure
everywhere in your body. These blood vessels are built like high-quality tires
or garden hoses with three-ply construction. Layers of tough protein, muscle,
and a delicate lining won’t let blood stick or clot.
Weak spots lead to aneurysms
For a variety of reasons, sometimes weak spots are present in arteries. They
can be caused by defects present at birth, the wear and tear of aging, or dis-
ease of the arteries. These weak spots can be anywhere.
Years of blood pressure pounding on the weak spots can lead to stretching
of the artery where it is weakened. The stretched-out parts are called
aneurysms. The entire artery balloons out, like a snake that just had dinner.
This often happens in the aorta where the weakness is all around the entire
diameter of this thumb-width blood vessel in your abdomen. If the weak
spot is smaller than the whole artery, the bubblelike spot that forms is
called a bleb.
Aneurysm in the brain
In the arteries of the brain, the weak spots typically form where they branch
into smaller twigs. They begin as small blebs, like little buds on a tree. Through
the years, some of the weakest blebs can stretch out to form small pea-sized
bubbles. With time, they can continue to enlarge. As they grow, they stretch
thinner and thinner and then, like a bubble-gum bubble, they run the risk of
bursting.
103
Chapter 6: Red Stroke (SAH): Bleeding Outside the Brain

Warning signs from enlarging aneurysms
Evidence indicates that aneurysms start out small and enlarge over time.
Depending on where they are, aneurysms may reveal their presence — before
they burst — through a variety of warning signs:
 Face and eye pain: Sometimes enlarging aneurysms cause pain in the
face or around an eye. This type of pain can have many causes, making
diagnosis difficult.
 Large pupil in one eye: The pupil of one eye may become much larger
than the pupil of the other. If you look in the mirror and see a small dif-
ference in the size of your pupils, don’t immediately go to the emergency
room. Many are born with a difference in pupil size. An old picture can
often show that a difference has been present for years. Contact lenses
and eye irritation can also affect pupil size.
 Headaches: Before it bursts, an aneurysm may have a small leak that
seals itself off before major damage occurs. The leak causes a headache,
typically in the front or back of the head. The headache is severe. Such a
headache can be mistaken for a migraine headache, though, particularly
among those who do not often get migraines. People who suffer from
migraine headaches can probably tell the difference.
 Neck pain and stiffness that come on suddenly: Headaches caused by
leaks from aneurysms may be associated with neck pain and stiffness.
 Sudden pain between the shoulder blades: This is another symptom,
though more unusual than neck pain and stiffness, that results from a
headache brought on by an aneurysm leak.
When brain aneurysms rupture
So, we have our well-packaged brain floating in a layer of protective fluid, and
within that shock-absorbing padding, we have arteries threading in from the
base of the skull and into the brain. Arteries sometimes develop aneurysms —
those stretched-out sections — from weak spots. These spots sometimes leak
and seal themselves off, causing uncomfortable side effects such as a severe
headache, unequal pupil size, and other pains.
But what happens if an aneurysm actually bursts (see Figure 6-1)? You have a
brain catastrophe. A subarachnoid hemorrhage. SAH. Bleeding in the space
between the brain and skull. Red stroke. Refer back to Chapter 1’s Figure 1-4
for another illustration of this.
104
Part II: Types of Stroke 

When an aneurysm bursts, blood rushes at high pressure from the artery into
the surrounding space. In most cases, the rupture spews blood into the sub-
arachnoid space that surrounds the brain. In a few cases, the rupture directs
a high-pressure stream directly against the surface of the brain. Blood goes
into the subarachnoid space but also can tear holes in the delicate tissue of
nearby brain and force itself into the substance of the brain.

The problem with headaches
When headache is the only symptom, sufferers
and doctors alike may be challenged to diag-
nose it immediately. Only one in ten patients
who complain of a sudden, severe headache
actually has subarachnoid bleeding. Severe
headache is quite common in the ER, and,
unfortunately, the telltale neck stiffness
common to this form of stroke takes several
hours to develop.
The consequences of missing a bleeding
aneurysm are so bad, though, that it is usually
considered worthwhile to do expensive tests
when someone comes to the ER with a sudden,
severe headache. A CT scan may be done. If it
doesn’t show blood or any other problems, a
simple spinal tap may be in order. Spinal taps
have an undeserved bad reputation — they’re
relatively safe and cause minimal discomfort
(discomfort is medical talk for pain). The pres-
ence of clear fluid from a spinal tap is the best
evidence that a headache is not caused by sub-
arachnoid bleeding.
No test — CT scan, spinal tap, or even MRI
scan — is 100-percent accurate. Some sub-
arachnoid bleeds cause such mild or unusual
symptoms that no one can be blamed for miss-
ing the diagnosis. Fortunately, the diagnosis is
missed most often in the least severe cases.

Bleeding into the subarachnoid space can slow the normal blood flow to the
brain. This is because the pressure inside the subarachnoid space is usually
lower than the blood pressure in arteries. When blood leaks into the sub-
arachnoid space, its pressure goes up, squeezing the brain, making it harder
to pump blood into the brain, and the result is the blood does not flow in fast
enough to meet the needs of the brain. This is why some people drop to the
ground unconscious when their red subarachnoid stroke first happens.
In Figure 6-2, you can’t see the aneurysm, but you can see all the white areas
around the outside of the brain filling all the nooks and crannies where the
convolutions of the brain are. In a week or so, the blood vessels on the top
and bottom surfaces of the brain that are surrounded by this blood in the
subarachnoid space may start going into spasm and cutting off the blood
flow to areas of the brain. No one knows why the spasm occurs, but there are
several treatments given to try to repeat it.

Part II: Types of Stroke 

What does the individual experience when an aneurysm bursts in the sub-
arachnoid space? Here are a few of the common symptoms:
 A pop: A few patients report hearing or feeling a pop inside their head
when an aneurysm ruptures.
 Unconsciousness: Right after the rupture, about half of the patients
become unconscious and remain so for more than an hour. Many are
unconscious for less time. Some patients do not regain consciousness
for several days. Some die before they awaken.
 Headache: Almost all victims who don’t fall immediately unconscious
complain of severe headache. Vomiting may accompany the headache.
Sometimes there is a brief moment of sudden and severe headache
before someone becomes unconscious. Those who lose consciousness
don’t report a headache, of course, but they often show signs of severe
pain. After they awaken, they almost always have a severe headache.
 Brain injury: Approximately one third of patients who suffer an SAH
stroke experience signs of brain injury immediately after rupture. These
signs may be the same as almost any other stroke. They include abnor-
mal eye movements, paralysis on one side of the body, language difficul-
ties, and memory loss.
Can I post this warning too many times? If you note any of the symptoms
listed for SAH in yourself or anyone else, call 911 immediately! Remember, 
50 percent of all individuals who experience a subarachnoid hemorrhage 
die before they get to the hospital. There’s absolutely no time to delay.
After an SAH Stroke
The initial bursting of the aneurysm is only the start of the problems with
subarachnoid hemorrhage. If the victim makes it to the emergency room
alive, then the bleeding has probably stopped. But plenty of other grim
prospects face the survivor, from rebleeding to brain swelling, from seizures
to white strokes. This section takes a closer look at these risks.
Rebleeding
In the hospital, the doctors’ first concern is to prevent the aneurysm from
bleeding again. As many as 30 percent of aneurysms rebleed, and when they
do, the result is often fatal or causes severe disability. The symptoms of
rebleeding are much like those of the first bleed. Needless to say, if the
patient is still unconscious from the first bleed, the symptoms may not be
apparent. Rebleeding is a greater likelihood the first day of the stroke.
Thereafter, the risk of rebleeding reduces each day after the stroke.
107
Chapter 6: Red Stroke (SAH): Bleeding Outside the Brain

Brain swelling
Two types of brain swelling threaten the SAH patient: hydrocephalus (hy drow
SEFF uh luss) and brain edema (uh DEEM uh). Both cause the pressure inside
the skull to increase. Increased pressure makes it harder for blood to flow
into the brain, which can cause further brain injury — and greater likelihood
that the aneurysm will start bleeding again. The good news: Both hydro-
cephalus and brain edema are treatable.
Hydrocephalus
Normally, fluid flows from cavities inside the brain out to the subarachnoid
space. The fluid is generated inside the brain and percolates out through
small openings into the subarachnoid space. When there is a lot of blood
inside the subarachnoid space, the blood can clot and plug these openings.
If it does, then the fluid inside the brain has no place to go. It builds up in the
cavities and presses the brain tightly against the skull. Sometimes this condi-
tion improves on its own. Otherwise, drowsiness and inability to move the
eyes may develop as the brain is crushed against the skull. Eventually, the
swelling can result in death.
Brain edema
The brain tissue itself can swell up when it is injured. This usually occurs in
two situations. When the aneurysm bursts with bleeding into the substance
of the brain, you get the same kind of brain swelling that you get with red
stroke brain hemorrhage. The blood in the brain draws white cells and fluid
as a response to the injury — similar to your ankle swelling after you sprain
it. The swelling goes down as the blood is cleared out by the white cells.
Edema is also a complication of severe spasm of the arteries irritated by the
blood in the subarachnoid space. The brain swells because a white stroke
has occurred. If the white stroke caused by spasm of arteries is so severe
that there is brain edema, then the injury is very severe. Because the edema
comes from dying brain cells, this type of edema is very hard to treat.
Heart problems
SAH sometimes causes heart problems. The heart is controlled by areas deep
in the base of the brain, where most aneurysms are found. Perhaps the blood
injures the brain’s control mechanism for the heart. One of the heart prob-
lems that may develop is abnormal rhythm. The heart skips beats or con-
tracts in a frantic, disorganized rhythm that pumps no blood. This can be
fatal. Evidence of injury to the heart resembling a heart attack is also found
in some people with subarachnoid hemorrhage.
108
Part II: Types of Stroke 

Seizures
You have a 25-percent chance of having a seizure in the first 24 hours after a
subarachnoid hemorrhage. Most seizures occur immediately after the bleed-
ing starts. Brain seizures are thought to be caused by the blood irritating the
surface of the brain. When blood escapes from blood vessels, it provokes an
intense response to the organs and internal mechanisms it contacts. Seizures
result in the case of contact with the brain; spasms occur when the blood
contacts the outside of the brain arteries.
Among all the complications from subarachnoid bleeding, seizures are proba-
bly the least disabling — patients who suffer SAH strokes are prone to experi-
ence seizures after their release from the hospital. They are dramatic and
frightening, but do not seem to predict a bad outcome if everything else goes
well. Drugs can successfully treat and prevent further seizures.
White strokes
For reasons no one understands, arteries inside the blood-filled subarachnoid
space may go into spasm. This means that the muscles in the wall of the artery
constrict and make the artery smaller. If the spasm is severe, the blood flow
can be cut off completely. As you probably know by now, decreased blood flow
in an artery can cause a white stroke someplace in the brain downstream. Red
strokes, then, may lead to white strokes.
Spasm of brain arteries is the major cause of brain injury and death after you
make it to the hospital. This spasm occurs in about 30 to 40 percent of SAH
patients. It starts to occur between 3 and 21 days after the stroke, usually
between days 4 and 14.
For a few days after admittance to the hospital, the patient may start to
improve, as with most strokes. However, after six or seven days, vasospasm
of the brain arteries may cause a new stroke of the white type that paralyzes
the face, an arm, or a leg and makes language difficult. This stroke is some-
times more devastating than the original red stroke.
Behavioral changes
Aneurysm ruptures almost always occur at the base of the brain. When an
aneurysm bursts toward the front of the brain, you can expect behavioral
changes because the resulting vasospasm of the large arteries here supply
the front part of the brain that controls behavior.
109
Chapter 6: Red Stroke (SAH): Bleeding Outside the Brain

The stroke sufferer may not notice the changes. Family members may find
him or her more emotional, both laughing and crying more. They may report
a change in personality.
Other behavioral changes may be less noticeable at first, especially in the
hospital. However, once home, the patient may have difficulty performing
tasks that were manageable before the stroke. Balancing a checkbook, filing
taxes, or sending out birthday presents to grandchildren may be too much
for the stroke survivor. Though free of any obvious disability, the individual
must make more of an effort to concentrate and complete routine tasks. This
may put a lot of pressure on relationships with family and friends.
The good news is that there is good treatment available that can reduce the
extent of brain injury to some extent. Since behavior changes can occur with
all the different types of stroke, how to cope with this problem is discussed
later in Chapter 17.
The end result
Without treatment, the outlook after subarachnoid hemorrhage is pretty
grim. Even if you live to make it to the emergency room, the death rate
approaches 25 percent over the next three months because of the risk of
rebleeding and artery spasm, which may lead to further red and white
strokes. About 40 percent of patients will have some impairment due to
resulting brain injury. Treatment, then, becomes an urgent priority.
Treating SAH Strokes
Subarachnoid hemorrhage is one of the worst types of stroke. It typically
happens to younger individuals than other strokes — most SAH victims are
55 to 60 — and it is usually entirely unexpected. This form of red stroke
results in more fatalities than other types of stroke, and the resulting brain
injury among survivors can be more severe. So far, no treatments are avail-
able for help in the first few minutes after the aneurysm bursts. This type of
stroke gets people’s attention, and most victims are taken to the emergency
room immediately by ambulance.
The good news is that, if the patient survives the initial onset, SAH is one of
the most treatable forms of stroke. A stroke team may make the initial evalua-
tion, but when it comes to treating red stroke — especially SAH red stroke —
a neurosurgeon will be called in. This is because some of the most critical
treatments for subarachnoid bleeding involve surgical procedures to the
brain. Other treatments for SAH complications such as brain swelling and
artery spasm may involve drugs.
110
Part II: Types of Stroke 

Not every hospital has a neurosurgeon or the facilities needed to manage
subarachnoid bleeding. In this case, the patient is transported immediately
to another hospital for admission. Sometimes, the stroke victim may be stabi-
lized in an intensive care unit for a short time before transfer is arranged.
Measuring the severity of the stroke
Many treatment decisions depend on an estimate of the severity of the
stroke. Treatment always means some risk, and some treatments for SAH
stroke have pretty high risks. It’s no surprise, then, that treatment may be
postponed or avoided if the stroke is less severe.
How bad is the brain injury?
Neurosurgeons give subarachnoid bleeds a score from one to five. One is the
best, five the worst. The major determinant of the score is how alert and
awake the patient is. One means awake, alert, and no signs of brain injury
such as a paralyzed arm or abnormal eye movements. Five means essentially
deeply unconscious.
How bad is the bleeding?
A CT scan can provide a good estimate of the extent of bleeding in the sub-
arachnoid space. The presence of thick, dense blood clots and blood predict
a more severe stroke. Blood spreading into the internal brain cavities is also a
bad sign. Early brain swelling seen on the first CT scan is also bad news.
Blood localized in just one area is better. But if more blood shows up in later
CT scans, this predicts a difficult time controlling the bleeding.
Emergency treatment
Subarachnoid bleeding often affects brain stem. If you’ll recall, this is where
all the body’s vital functions are regulated. It is the Houston Mission Control
for the body we’re talking about here, and when things go awry, a lot of bad
things can happen. In SAH, the heart rhythm is most commonly affected.
Blood pressure can also be affected with unexpected increases or drops in
pressure. As prevention, emergency personnel utilize as much medical tech-
nology as needed, connecting the patient to tubes, wires, and catheters that
can maintain those vital functions — perhaps even breathing — until the
brain’s central control system recovers and takes over again. If the patient is
conscious, he or she will hear plenty of beeps, hums, and intense technical
discussions as physicians evaluate the case. Blood tests, cardiograms, X-rays,
CT scans, and special X-rays to look at blood vessels may all be scheduled in
short order.
111
Chapter 6: Red Stroke (SAH): Bleeding Outside the Brain

All this expensive machinery and testing may seem futile. After all, if an SAH
stroke is so severe, perhaps death — or a life with severe brain injury — is
inevitable. Why bother? For some types of stroke, that may be an appropriate
question. However, victims of subarachnoid hemorrhage are generally
younger, and a good recovery is possible with treatment.
I encourage stroke patients and their families to go for a full-court press —
the odds are too good to pass up the possibility of a good outcome. Tough
decisions to pull tubes and unplug machines should be put off for a few days
in most cases.
Finding the aneurysm
After the SAH sufferer’s condition is stabilized, he or she is put through tests
to find the aneurysm that caused the bleeding. The methods for finding
aneurysms are changing. The tried-and-true test, called an angiogram (ANN
jee oh gram), injects a dye under high pressure into the brain arteries.
Virtually all aneurysms can be identified this way, but a few patients may be
injured by it.
Figure 6-3 is not a picture of some strange plant. It is an angiogram of the
blood inside the blood vessels of someone who has a half-inch diameter
spherical aneurysm at a branch of one of the arteries to his brain. The
aneurysm is inside the skull but outside the brain in the subarachnoid space.
You can’t see either the brain or the skull. All you can see is the dye that has
been injected into the brain arteries. Usually an angiogram is only done after
an aneurysm ruptures and bleeds to cause a stroke. The purpose of the
angiogram is to plan sealing the aneurysm so it doesn’t leak again.
Safer tests have been developed. New tests use special CT (X-ray) or MRI
angiograms. The downside is they miss 5 to 15 percent of aneurysms. If confi-
dence in the accuracy of these new techniques continues to develop, fewer
patients will need the older, more risky and uncomfortable angiogram.
Usually, just one aneurysm is found. Sometimes more than one is discovered.
The odds of having two or more aneurysms are about one in four. Often, the
aneurysm that bled can be identified, but sometimes this can’t be proven.
What to do about extra, unruptured aneurysms is uncertain. I can tell you
that the bigger the aneurysm, the more likely it will rupture and bleed. If it
is more than a centimeter (the size of a small marble), some doctors would
recommend sealing it off from its artery so it can’t bleed if it is easy to reach.
Remember, these waters are full of dangers from surgery and radiological
procedures. They are not well charted. Taking the opportunity to get a
second or third opinion gives you more chances at a good outcome.

Part II: Types of Stroke 

Occasionally, no aneurysms are found. Not all subarachnoid bleeding is caused
by aneurysms. In fact, 15 percent of subarachnoid bleeding has an unusual or
rare cause. If an aneurysm isn’t found, the patient may be at risk for further
bleeding, and artery spasm can still be a risk.
Sealing off the aneurysm
No one denies that it’s a good idea to seal off the ruptured aneurysm so it
can’t rebleed. Almost all agree that it should be done earlier rather than
later, circumstances permitting. But when it comes to how to seal off the
aneurysm, the debate heats up. Neurosurgeons have two choices: clips or
coils, two simple and similar words for two vastly different procedures.
Clips pinch off the aneurysm
Clips are the traditional means for sealing off aneurysms. The procedure for
placing a clip (it looks like a tiny ice tong) around the base of an aneurysm
requires cutting a hole in the skull, lifting the brain up out of the way, and
threading the clip between dozens of tiny blood vessels to reach around
and pinch off the neck of the aneurysm. After surgery, your head is usually
wrapped in a bandage that looks cool to your grandchildren, and you get the
most expensive and complete haircut of your life.

Chapter 6: Red Stroke (SAH): Bleeding Outside the Brain

Clipping is not a job for amateurs. One slip and disastrous bleeding from a
torn blood vessel can destroy any chance of a good recovery. Even the most
experienced neurosurgeons encounter problems in a significant number of
cases. The risk is generally considered worthwhile, though, because clips
have a good track record for preventing rebleeding. Not all aneurysms can
be clipped, however.
Coils: No holes in the skull required
Coils are the new guys on the block, and their use is increasing. One large
clinical trial suggests that when they can be used, coils may be the safest
and most effective way to go. With coils, all the action takes place inside
the blood vessels. No holes in the skull. No fashionable haircut or bandage-
wrapped head.
Typically, radiologists who specialize in brain procedures put coils in. They
almost always work in close cooperation with neurosurgeons. If a coil fails, a
clip may be required. Some neurosurgeons are doing coiling themselves.
The straightened coil is introduced through a plastic tube inserted into a
large artery in the groin. The physician weaves the tube through the body,
turning and twisting along the blood vessels until the end of the plastic tube
is actually inside or right at the mouth of the aneurysm in the brain area.
Then the straightened coil is pushed out into the aneurysm. It springs back
into its coiled shape inside the cavity of the aneurysm. The coil is made of a
material — platinum, for instance — that causes the blood to clot around it.
In this way, the clot seals off the aneurysm from the inside.
The coiling procedure can also result in serious complications if the aneurysm
ruptures again or a hole is accidentally punched in an artery. But these com-
plications are generally less frequent than the complications from clipping.
Clipping also avoids all the complications of cutting a hole in the skull and 
lifting the brain out of the way. Because this method is the newer of the
two, it’s not certain yet whether coiling will last as long as clipping. Not all
aneurysms can be coiled, but more can be coiled than clipped.
Which method is best?
I’m glad I’m not a surgeon. Surgeons know what they are doing and yet they
have to put up with someone like me, who is always second-guessing them.
They understand that experience is critical, and that experienced surgeons
have the best results — whether it be by clip or coil.
Yet you still hear “Get a second opinion.” This doesn’t necessarily mean get a
better opinion or get a different surgeon. It just means that every case is unique,
and each one is worth some discussion among experts to be sure the best pro-
cedure is chosen.
114
Part II: Types of Stroke 

It is important to seal the aneurysm quickly, so there isn’t much time to con-
sider all the alternatives. A hospital that offers only one approach may have
to refer patients to another hospital for the other method. But the major
determinant of success is the rate of complications of the procedure to place
the device. Coils usually have a lower rate of complications.
My advice? Be sure both a neurosurgeon and radiologist have a chance to
offer opinions, especially in the case of more than one aneurysm. Experience
is important for success in both clipping and coiling. It’s better to go with the
most successful experience, regardless of coil or clip.
Relieving brain swelling
Treatment depends on which of the two types of swelling occurs. For persis-
tent severe hydrocephalus, the fluid is vented out of the brain through a small
plastic tube about the size of a ballpoint pen refill. It is threaded through a
half-inch hole in the skull and pushed right through the brain into the cavity
filled with fluid. What? Pushed through the brain? Believe it or not, yes, and it
is done with almost no risk of brain injury. The tube is very soft, pushing
aside blood vessels rather than breaking them (in most cases).
Brain edema is treated with drugs and hyperventilation (rapid breathing). If
the swelling is severe, the success of the treatment may be monitored by
screwing a pressure gauge into the skull to measure the pressure inside. This
pressure is significant for a number of reasons, the most important being that
high pressure can slow the flow of blood to the brain.
Dealing with artery spasm
It’s possible to reduce the risk of spasm of brain arteries following subarach-
noid bleeding. If the aneurysm has been coiled or clipped, the risk of bleed-
ing is decreased. Therefore, the blood pressure can be allowed to rise to the
higher levels required to push blood through narrow arteries. Maintaining
good hydration with careful management of fluids is critical.
Drugs that prevent artery muscles from contracting, called calcium channel
blockers, have been shown to improve the outcome from subarachnoid hem-
orrhage by reducing severity of vasospasm. The most common drug used is
nimodipine. The pills are usually given six times a day for three weeks.
Artery spasm may occur despite maximum efforts to prevent it. When signs of
brain injury become apparent, another stroke is happening. This time, though,
it’s a white stroke — caused by lack of blood flow rather than bleeding. Several
treatments address this problem. No good evidence exists to prove that the
treatments actually help.
115
Chapter 6: Red Stroke (SAH): Bleeding Outside the Brain

One treatment is to increase the blood pressure and put a lot of fluid into the
veins to thin the blood and force the most blood possible through the narrow
arteries. This treatment has its risks. It puts a tremendous strain on the heart
and kidneys. If you have diabetes, heart disease, or are simply in poor shape,
the stress can cause heart attack and heart failure.
Some centers are trying another unproven treatment to open up arteries in
spasm by pushing plastic tubes through the narrowed arteries. In some
cases, it seems to work well. In others, there have been problems — mostly
bleeding when the plastic tube tears open an artery.
I don’t have any really good advice to offer once artery spasm starts. The
treatment varies widely, and there is little knowledge from clinical trials that
allows one to know whether the different treatments really are good for you.
Predicting SAH Stroke:
It’s a Family Affair
Brain aneurysms tend to run in families. About 20 percent of patients who have
subarachnoid bleeding from an aneurysm have a family member who has evi-
dence of an aneurysm. Should everyone in your family be tested to see if they
have aneurysms? And if aneurysms are discovered, what do you do about it?
The answers to these questions are still somewhat uncertain.
Most aneurysms never rupture. If there is a family history of aneurysms rup-
turing in more than one person, then there is more reason to consider evalu-
ating other family members.
With an unruptured aneurysm, there is more time to think things over and
get additional data and recommendations from several physicians. In general,
the real worries are about the minority of aneurysms that are a centimeter
in diameter or greater. Many agree that smaller aneurysms can be monitored.
Coiling or clipping larger aneurysms comes with an undeniable risk. However,
once an aneurysm grows to the one-centimeter size, the risk of rupture
increases significantly and grows over time.
If ongoing measurements of the aneurysm show growth, then this might
move me toward taking the risk of the coiling or clipping operation. If the
aneurysm looked “easy” to coil, then that should also increase interest in
having it sealed off.
116
Part II: Types of Stroke 

It is important to note, though, that if you decide to postpone sealing an
aneurysm, you have a responsibility to get regular tests to see whether it is
enlarging. You should also take measures to reduce other risks as well. Stop
smoking, obviously. Get your blood pressure down through diet or medica-
tion. If you are a woman, avoid taking estrogen or birth-control pills and take
extra precautions to control your blood pressure during pregnancy.
I know, I know. Eat right, exercise, stop smoking. That’s a lot to ask from
someone who’s just received the bad news that they have aneurysms that
could result in a devastating red stroke. But trust me. You do not want to
hear that “pop” in your head, or find yourself reeling from a sudden and
severe headache, or lose consciousness — or your life — before you even get
to the emergency room. These necessary precautions are a small price to pay
to improve your odds of a stroke-free future.
Chocolate, as far as I know, is not a risk factor for SAH.

Chapter 6: Red Stroke (SAH): Bleeding Outside the Brain
Headache reveals aneurysm
A 56-year-old company president was playing
handball when he began to experience a severe
headache. He couldn’t ever remember such a
severe headache, but he did remember that his
grandmother and fathers had died of a stroke. He
stopped playing and sat down. The headache got
worse. His friend called 911, and an ambulance
took him to a nearby emergency room. In the ER
he was a little confused and frightened but
remained conscious. A CT scan of his head
was normal. An MRA (magnetic resonance
angiography) scan was inconclusive. However,
6 hours later, a lumbar puncture spinal tap did
show the presence of blood in the usually clear
cerebrospinal fluid. Special testing showed the
yellow tinge to the fluid that indicated the bleed-
ing was not due to the lumbar puncture proce-
dure itself and had been present for several
hours.
An angiogram was performed the next morning,
and a small half-inch aneurysm was identified.
Several physicians discussed possible treat-
ments. Finally, because of the position of the
aneurysm, a coil was placed to close it off so
that it would not rupture in the future. He was
scheduled for a repeat angiogram in one year.
He was back to work within two weeks.

 Recognizing stroke dementia
 Testing for stroke dementia
 Preventing small strokes and dementia
You may be having a stroke right now and not even realize it! In fact, evi-
dence supports that individuals can suffer a series of small white strokes
over time and never even notice anything, or have only slurring of speech,
or vague numbness or clumsiness on one side after an episode. But the bad
news is that the cumulative damage from these undetected strokes may lead
to dementia.
Typically linked with aging, dementia is a condition in which damaged brain
tissue results in severely impaired memory, cognition, and loss of other brain
function, which becomes progressively worse with time. Alzheimer’s disease
is a form of dementia. There are many causes of dementia, but approximately
10 to 20 percent of cases are the result of a series of small strokes. When
small strokes are the cause, we refer to the dementia as vascular cognitive
impairment. Many of the strokes that cause vascular dementia are the small-
est and least noticeable of all strokes, but — make no mistake — they’re still
a serious problem.
It’s challenging to get accurate data about the prevalence of stroke-caused
dementia. These small strokes typically go unreported — no trip to the ER,
no diagnosis. But it’s estimated that this type of white stroke makes up about
25 percent of all white strokes. And those who suffer from one are looking at
a one in ten chance of suffering another stroke within the year.

In this chapter, I explain exactly how a series of small, imperceptible strokes
can lead to dementia, how to recognize stroke-caused dementia, and — most
importantly — how to reduce the risk of vascular dementia.
Is There a Bright Side
to Stroke Dementia?
Here’s the good news about vascular dementia: You can take steps to
prevent it!
Many in the medical world are concerned with the aging process of the brain
and how to slow it — no one has yet figured out how to do this. Some are
hung up on Alzheimer’s disease, and much of our research and energies are
focused on this devastating condition. But we’ve acted as if solving
Alzheimer’s will solve all the problems with the aging brain. It’s becoming
clear that it won’t. In fact, there isn’t even a test that can tell whether an indi-
vidual has Alzheimer’s with any certainty. And you can’t treat Alzheimer’s
disease, at least not yet.
But you can treat your blood-vessel problems. Doctors are discovering that
the blood vessels have a great deal to do with the health of the aging brain.
Disease of the blood vessels may not be the entire problem, but it is part of
the problem. A big part. And good care of blood vessels could help prevent the
problem.
If you want to scrape every bit of quality you can out of your life, don’t waste
time worrying about what you can’t treat; tackle what you can treat. High
blood pressure and high cholesterol in your blood can injure your brain. Treat
these conditions aggressively.
If you are experiencing memory loss or other symptoms of brain impairment,
you may have Alzheimer’s. Or you may have had a series of small strokes.
Instead of getting discouraged and giving in to loss of brain power, take steps
to protect your brain from further deterioration by reducing your blood pres-
sure and cholesterol, among other things. (See the section “Preventing Stroke
Dementia,” later in this chapter.) Even if the symptoms are due to
Alzheimer’s, it’s been shown time and again that Alzheimer’s patients do
better if they don’t have high blood pressure, diabetes, or high cholesterol.
So, no matter how you look at it, assuming a proactive role in taking care of
your blood vessels can’t hurt.
120
Part II: Types of Stroke 

Small Strokes and Dementia
We’ve been talking about “small” strokes. Indeed, it’s possible and perhaps
even more common than we realize for individuals to have a small stroke —
or many small strokes — and never know it. But let me emphasize this:
Doctors don’t like to give you the bad news. If you have a stroke and ask
your doctor about it, you may hear something like, “It was only a small
stroke.” Well, no stroke is insignificant. A small stroke can be just as danger-
ous to your health as a big stroke.
Small strokes, small blood vessels
Blood clots and blood vessels come in all sizes. So far in this book, I have
talked about white strokes that occur when large clots block large blood 
vessels. This type of stroke definitely lets you know it’s happening. You feel
weakness or numbness in an arm or leg. You are unable to talk or communi-
cate; you have difficulty understanding others — dramatic symptoms you
can’t fail to notice. These attention-getting white strokes — large-clot, large-
artery blockages — send you to the emergency room.
But in addition to the larger arteries at the base of your brain, there are tiny
blood vessels that carry the blood to and from the brain. These miniscule
vessels are like fine, hollow hairs. They perforate right into the substance of
the brain and carry blood deep into the core.
The pressure is on
Because these delicate vessels come right off the larger main arteries at the
base of the brain, they are subjected to very high blood pressure, which
causes a lot of wear and tear over time. Most of the wear and tear occurs in
blood vessels near the origin of the arteries, where the pressure is highest.
The result of this high-pressure wear and tear is plaque — hard deposits of fat
and scar tissue near the mouth of these small arteries. This process is called
hardening of the arteries, or atherosclerosis. The vessels get stiff and hard. The
nodules of atherosclerosis can narrow these small vessels so that little blood
can flow past them. When blood clots form at these hard, rough spots, the
whole small artery becomes plugged. Atherosclerosis can also attack larger
arteries. It can lead to heart attack when the coronary arteries are attacked,
and stroke when the carotid arteries in the neck are blocked. This hardening
process and the blockage it produces is thought by most to be the most
common cause of small strokes. Small vessel atherosclerosis (microatheroma)
is worse in patients with high blood pressure, elevated LDL, and diabetes.
121
Chapter 7: Dementia (Vascular Cognitive Impairment)

Deep in the brain, grape-sized holes
Whether caused by atherosclerosis or thickened artery walls, clots in the
small, penetrating arteries of the brain can lead to injuries deep inside it.
When they heal, the injured space is cleared out and a pocket of clear fluid is
left in its place. The size of these small white stroke areas of infarction may
be as tiny as a grain of rice or as large as a grape.
So what is it about this high-blood-pressure environment that can produce so
many small strokes and so much blood vessel scarring with atherosclerosis
in the brain? Remember, there are hundreds of branches of tiny vessels coming
off the larger arteries at the base of the brain. They are all similarly affected by
the flow of the blood. If an individual has risk factors such as high blood pres-
sure, high cholesterol, smoking, and diabetes, all the vessels — not just one or
two — are at risk.
This translates to the following: Have one small stroke deep in your brain and
you’re likely to have another.
The end result: A shrinking brain
After years of high blood pressure, even one small stroke every couple of
months has a major impact on the brain. Most of the damage occurs in the
deep core areas of the brain, which rely on small, penetrating arteries for
their blood supply. In severe cases, there are so many little holes that the
brain begins to look like a sponge. The brain itself shrinks, drawing away
from the skull. The normal fluid reservoirs enlarge. In advanced cases, a CT
scan or MRI scan shows that the brain has begun to shrink and the ventricles
are enlarged (see Figure 7-1).
The small infarctions shown in the figure are called lacunes. As more and
more accumulate over time, the patient becomes more and more impaired.
In this MRI scan, the bone appears dark like the fluid in the ventricles and
the area of infarction. This scan is early in the process. The ventricles are not
much enlarged, and the brain has only just begun to atrophy, mostly on the
sides where you can see more dark fluid around the convolutions than in
the front of the brain.
A shrunken, spongy brain can function surprisingly well. Every day, a CT scan
somewhere reveals a brain that shouldn’t be expected to rub two sticks
together, yet the patient is active, productive, and functional. This is a tribute
to the adaptability of the brain. And also to luck.
But, trust me, you don’t want to take the chance. There is almost no doubt
that the cumulative effect of small strokes is to impair the brain, causing vas-
cular dementia.
122
Part II: Types of Stroke 

Recognizing Stroke Dementia
How can you tell whether someone is suffering from stroke-caused dementia?
It’s often easy to miss the signs — or confuse it with the normal loss of
mental acuity with aging or to assume that Alzheimer’s is the cause. Here
are some warning signals of brain failure:
 Loss of memory
 Confusion in complex situations
 Loss of control of emotions
 Problems with communication or expressing self
 Trouble paying attention
 Difficulty following a conversation
 Struggling to work finely with hands
 Disorganization in plans

Chapter 7: Dementia (Vascular Cognitive Impairment)

 Failure to recognize things seen
 Straining with calculations
 Inability to solve problems
 Loss of interest in activities that were once important
All too often, we jump to the conclusion that many or most of these warning
signals are signs of Alzheimer’s. They might be, but they are the same symp-
toms suffered by individuals who’ve experienced small white strokes.
Then again, we have to expect some loss of mental function as a normal part
of aging. Although lots of older people are likely to experience a few or more
of the symptoms just listed, the symptoms are typically not very severe and/or
occur infrequently. So between these two extremes, how do we recognize and
distinguish stroke-related dementia? Sometimes it’s a challenge.
Dementia is a gradual process
The onset of dementia is often so gradual it’s hard to recognize at first. Day-
to-day or even week-to-week changes may go unnoticed. But the changes
month to month and year to year are more apparent, particularly to those
who haven’t seen the afflicted individual in a while.
Sometimes, especially around holidays like Thanksgiving, family members get
together for the first time in months or even a year. It may be clear to those
who haven’t seen Mom for awhile, that something is wrong when she lets the
turkey burn to a crisp. Or that Dad isn’t his old self when he forgets how to
play chess.
The normal loss of mental function that occurs with aging is gradual, too. But
dementia accelerates the mental changes of normal aging. Comparatively,
dementia is much faster and more extreme. It is thought that everyone over
the age of 90 has some degree of dementia, but this is considered a normal
part of aging. When we figure out a way to slow this down in the future, any
mental changes with aging may be considered abnormal.
Loss of memory: The hallmark symptom
Memory loss, particularly short-term memory, is the most noticed symptom
of dementia. This may be because memory is one of the most complicated
and sophisticated functions of the brain. Memory involves integrating infor-
mation from all over the brain.
Do you know how the long-distance telephone network is organized?
Whenever you place a call, you might think that the connection follows
124
Part II: Types of Stroke 

the shortest pathway to the phone you are calling. But actually, your call to
Illinois from New York may go through California, depending on which phone
lines are busy or under repair. You dial. You talk. You never notice the many
problems that divert your call out of the shortest pathway. As more and more
lines become busy or broken, the time it takes to connect may be longer and
longer. Eventually, when all the lines into Illinois are broken, you may not be
able to call your friend in Chicago anymore.
Similarly, the failing brain may re-route the traffic of memory until, after more
and more injuries, you can’t recall a particular memory at all. What you experi-
ence is slower service from your brain, then one day something you think you
should know is suddenly gone altogether. It’s not so much gone as inaccessible.
Loss of other brain functions
The dementia caused by several strokes is likely to have a pronounced effect
on movement and language — more so than Alzheimer’s disease. Just like the
sudden and dramatic types of stroke that send you to the emergency room,
small strokes cause similar damage only at a less perceptible level. So, in
addition to problems with thinking and memory, a series of small strokes may
leave you with hand weakness or difficulty speaking. You may begin to have
trouble walking or driving. Balancing the checkbook may become a challenge.
Emotions may be harder to control. Because the brain is not receiving all the
information it is used to, the sufferer may become less trusting and more sus-
picious of others.
Diagnosing Stroke-Related Dementia
If you have a stroke, you call 911 and go to the emergency room because of
the sudden and dramatic signs that define a stroke. How, then, would some-
one with the gradual downhill course of stroke dementia end up in the emer-
gency room for treatment? Well, he or she could have a big stroke instead of
one more small one. In that case, they would probably be treated just like any
other stroke patient in the emergency room — until tests showed that the
patient had had a lot of other strokes already. Sometimes, family members or
friends who haven’t seen you in several months may visit and recognize that
something is seriously wrong and insist on taking you to the doctor or even
the emergency room. It may be sorted out that the problem is longstanding.
No treatment may be recommended. A follow-up appointment with a physi-
cian may be suggested.
The problem is that the appointment is not considered an emergency and, if
you feel better later, you may cancel. An opportunity to identify the problem
and start preventing further brain damage may be lost.
125
Chapter 7: Dementia (Vascular Cognitive Impairment)

Checking in for a check-up
It’s unlikely that you’ll discover in the emergency room that your failing
memory is due to small strokes. There may not be a crisis event that provokes
you to go to the ER — at least not for a long time. But the sooner you identify
small strokes as the cause of your memory loss and other impairments, the
earlier you can forestall further damage.
Maybe you forget why you’re in the grocery store. Maybe your spouse has
been noticing that you fail to remember plans you’ve made. Perhaps your
children have expressed concern about you after a recent visit. You confused
the names of your grandchildren, or just forgot them.
If you have any evidence that your memory and brain power may be failing —
especially if you also suffer from high blood pressure, high cholesterol, or
diabetes — make an appointment for testing. Are you just going to sit there
while your memory fades and you keep having these funny spells? Boxing is
a sport that virtually guarantees brain injury. If you know you’re at risk for
stroke and don’t do anything about it, that’s a little like boxing without the
chance of the prize.
Tools for identifying small stroke damage
A big stroke is a lot easier to diagnose than stroke dementia, because so
many things can cause dementia. The good news is that many of these things
are treatable. Other causes of dementia include depression, thyroid disease,
vitamin B-12 deficiency, and diabetes.
Although some doctors get a little hung up trying to rule out Alzheimer’s, it
may be more productive to test for the many treatable causes of vascular
dementia as well.
Looking at the pictures
MRI scans and CT scans may show the tracks that small strokes leave behind.
They aren’t all as obvious as the ones in the CT scan shown back in Figure 7-1.
Sometimes, just some increased darkness (or lightness) around the brain ven-
tricles is the only indication of brain damage. Often the brain looks shrunken,
and the ventricles — the series of connecting cavities — are larger.
If the scan is normal — no scars, shadows, or signs of shrinkage — then there
is sure to be more talk of Alzheimer’s and more tests to be sure there isn’t a
treatable cause of the problems you are having.
126
Part II: Types of Stroke 

Psychological tests: Are they worth it?
Sometimes, a doctor may recommend a battery of psychological tests to get
an estimate of how severe the brain failure is. These tests are expensive and
can take a lot of time. Some love taking these tests — others find them upset-
ting, fearing that they can reveal some psychological trait that can get them
committed (they can’t).
I’m not a big proponent of such tests for determining small stroke damage.
Except for depression and some other psychiatric problems, I don’t believe
that psychological testing can do much to diagnose the problems. But if you
agree to any formal psychological testing, you might state up front that you
don’t want it to last more than an hour. Most of the really important testing
can be done in an hour.
Ruling out other causes with blood tests
Blood tests can be very important in identifying and confirming other causes
of dementia, such as vitamin B-12 deficiency, syphilis, AIDS, brain fungal
infections, and thyroid disease. These treatable causes of dementia are not
common, but if you have one of them, a blood test can reveal it.
Don’t forget that many people have Alzheimer-like problems and risk factors
for stroke dementia. Just because you may have one or both of these, it doesn’t
mean you don’t have another treatable medical or psychiatric problem that
makes the symptoms worse. Your first priority is how well you think, not why
you don’t think well. Anything you can do that might possibly make your con-
dition better without a lot of risk is probably worthwhile.
The blood tests include
 CBC, a complete blood count
 Electrolytes in the blood such as sodium and potassium, as well as 
glucose
 Chemistry panel, 12–18 blood tests to see how your liver and kidneys
are functioning
 Thyroid tests
 Diabetes tests
 Vitamin B-12 tests
 Blood tests for specific infections including syphilis, AIDS, and rare brain
fungus infections
 Sedimentation rate, a non-specific test to determine whether you have
an infection that is not obvious or some abnormal immune function
127
Chapter 7: Dementia (Vascular Cognitive Impairment)

Spinal tap
The spinal tap was mentioned with regard to subarachnoid hemorrhage in
Chapter 6. The procedure can be done in an office. It is also called a lumbar
puncture. Done by an experienced physician, it is usually a relatively pain-free
and simple process. However, there can be serious headaches afterward, and
serious infections are possible though very rare. The idea is to get some of the
clear cerebrospinal fluid that surrounds the brain and fills its ventricles. This
fluid can be analyzed to see if there is evidence of infection or inflammation.
Fortunately, you can get the fluid from inside the spine in the lumbar region
at about the level of your belly button. You usually lay on your side and a
long needle is slowly pushed between the bones until the cavity containing
the fluid is pierced. The fluid is withdrawn and the needle removed. The
needle is three inches long. To someone who doesn’t like needles, it looks
more like a knitting needle although it’s no thicker than the needles used to
start intravenous lines in your arm.
If my thinking and memory were going seriously bad, I think I would want to
have a spinal tap as well as blood tests. These are usually described as difficult
and potentially risky (and they can be). But before I surrendered to diagnosis, I
would want to be sure there wasn’t some rare infection or other inflammatory
process going on. A spinal tap is the only opportunity to detect these.
Be sure special spinal fluid cultures for fungi and tuberculosis are ordered.
Second opinion
You might think I only recommend second opinions for surgical problems. Not
so. For a difficult diagnosis like dementia, I suggest it may be worthwhile to
get more than one opinion. Most cases of dementia are accurately diagnosed,
and most are Alzheimer’s, but many doctors know of some case that was
missed for years before the correct cause of the dementia was determined.
I suggest taking the opportunity to see two doctors in different specialties
before a final diagnosis is accepted. Neurology and gerontology are two such
specialties.
Addressing the risk factors
If you believe your memory impairment may be the result of small strokes
and you don’t already know if you have some of the risk factors — particu-
larly high blood pressure, high cholesterol, diabetes, or atrial fibrillation (an
irregular heartbeat determined from an EKG) — now’s the time to find out.
It’s pretty easy to test for these conditions: Have your blood pressure taken.
128
Part II: Types of Stroke 

Add simple blood cholesterol and blood lipid tests (for diabetes) to the bat-
tery of other blood tests you’re taking to rule out other causes. And, for atrial
defibrillation, have an ultrasound test of your carotid artery — the artery in
your neck. This test will indicate if the blood is ineffectively pumping to your
brain.
So what if you discover that you have any or all of these risk factors? And you
rule out other potential causes of dementia? Plus your CT or MRI scan shows
some damage or brain shrinkage? Chances are likely that your doctor may
conclude that you have been suffering from small stroke dementia — and
that, unless things change, you’re likely to experience more small strokes and
problems with brain impairment.
Preventing Stroke Dementia
As with most white strokes, the damage caused by a small white stroke tends
to improve some on its own, especially with good rehabilitation. You can
treat small strokes as you treat large strokes. The problem is, as I pointed out
previously, it’s rare to have just one small stroke. The more strokes you have,
the greater the problems. So the best action is to do everything you can to
prevent them. And, yes, you prevent small strokes the same way you prevent
large strokes. Read Chapter 8 for more about how to reduce your risk of
stroke. Here’s a quick review of the tried-and-true stroke-preventing steps:
 Lower your blood pressure: Just picture the damage that pulsing blood
can cause to the small arteries of your brain: plaque deposits and scarred
and thickening walls. It should make you want to do everything you can to
keep your blood pressure in check. In addition to checking your blood
pressure regularly — and going on medication to lower it if your situation
demands it — you can make some adjustments to your lifestyle to help,
too. Evaluate your diet and reduce or cut out salt, which can aggravate
high blood pressure. Regular exercise can also help.
 Fight blood clots with drugs: Aspirin and a drug called clopidogrel are
anticoagulants or blood thinners — they slow down the formation of
blood clots and may help prevent stroke. If you have atrial fibrillation,
your irregular heartbeat puts you at an even higher risk for stroke.
Warfarin is a treatment for this condition. It involves frequent blood 
testing, however, and careful adjustment of the dosage to prevent severe
bleeding. But it sure beats having a stroke.
 Get in shape: Diet and exercise can’t hurt. Obesity can aggravate many
conditions that lead to strokes, including diabetes, heart disease, high
cholesterol, and high blood pressure. By keeping your weight down with
regular exercise and a healthy diet with minimal fats and sodium, you
may improve the other conditions — and lower your risk of stroke.
129
Chapter 7: Dementia (Vascular Cognitive Impairment)

 Bring down your cholesterol and lipids: The more fat in your blood,
the higher your chances of atherosclerosis. The first place to look for
reducing your blood cholesterol and lipids is your diet. Whether fast-
food favorites (French fries) or all-American classics (T-bone steak or
Southern fried chicken), your choice of sustenance may be increasing
your risk of stroke. Your condition may require some radical dietary
changes. Your doctor can tell you what your total fat intake should be.
But eating right may not be enough. If a low-fat diet doesn’t reduce your
blood lipids and cholesterol, you may need the help of medication. If
your doctor thinks you should be taking statin drugs, then don’t put off
starting drugs for months and months while you struggle to do what
most other people find almost impossible to do.
More and more doctors are prescribing lipid-lowering drugs for prevent-
ing stroke. There is some evidence to suggest they help prevent stroke
in patients with high blood pressure or diabetes, but definitive proof of
their ability to prevent vascular cognitive impairment is not at hand.
Lipid-lowering drugs are not generic at this time. Cost is high, so you
had better think of this as a long-term investment. Read more about the
pros and cons of statins in Chapter 10.
 Get your diabetes under control: Do the best job you can of controlling
it. Get your weight down. Exercise. Take your medication. Test your glu-
cose frequently. Have regular check-ups. A lot of advances have been
made in treatment for diabetes in the past few years — make sure you’re
taking advantage of them.
 And please don’t tell me you still smoke: Those chemicals in cigarette
smoke travel through your blood vessels, you know, to your heart and
your brain. One of them — nicotine — causes blood vessels to constrict.
Others cause the blood to thicken, and many do damage to the inside
walls of the vessels. Not exactly what you want to happen if you’re prone
to stroke.
130
Part II: Types of Stroke 
The word on wine
There’s a lot of publicity out there that a glass of
wine every day may actually reduce the risk of
stroke and heart disease. It’s amazing to hear
that something enjoyable might actually be
good for you. I haven’t yet seen any clinical
trials that show that drinking a glass of wine per
day makes any real difference. Alcohol has a lot
of other effects that are not accounted for in the
studies I have seen. I would be especially con-
cerned about your trying this if you have any
liver problems, problems with numb feet or
hands, or history of problems with alcohol. Until
I see solid proof that it is good for the brain, I’m
afraid I will tend to think alcohol is not good for
the brain.

Planning for When You Can’t Remember
If you are beginning to lose memory or other brain functions, it’s time to get
your life in order. If your condition keeps getting worse, you won’t be making
good decisions and will need someone else to act on your behalf. Now is the
time to decide who you want to call the shots if you can’t.
I am not the person to be telling you how to plan your financial and medical
future. However, I do know from experience that your failure to make ade-
quate plans, even in the simplest case, can cause you and your family an
amazing amount of stress and even animosity.
Have you given or do you plan to give someone power of attorney and med-
ical power of attorney? Do you have a will? If there is a chance you are going
to lose your mental competence or the ability to make decisions, then you
should make these arrangements now, when there is little doubt about your
competence to do so.
Your children or even your spouse may hesitate to bring up questions about
what your intentions are for your home or other real estate and investments
should you have to go into a nursing home or other long-term care situation.
Get an expert in planning for this possible outcome. Planning for a time when
you cannot plan is extremely difficult — perhaps even more so than planning
for a funeral. But it’s an important obligation. While you are still able to, take
as much responsibility for your future as you can, so that if the time comes,
the job of your loved ones will be easier.
131
Chapter 7: Dementia (Vascular Cognitive Impairment)
Blood pressure: To treat or not to treat?
There is some controversy about the value of
lowering blood pressure in those who’ve suffered
several small strokes. Does lower blood pressure
result in fewer strokes? In general, there is good
reason to believe it does. Blood pressure seems
to cause both types of small artery problems: wall
thickening and atherosclerosis.
If you have had a major stroke or a transient
stroke, at least one clinical trial has shown that
lowering your blood pressure, even if it is within
“normal” or “high normal” limits, is a good idea.
This trial, however, did not focus on patients
who had small strokes.
Some experts speculate that higher blood pres-
sure may help force more blood through small,
narrow arteries, thus preventing further brain
injury. The assumption is that blood pressure has
already done most of the damage it can do. So it
might be better to treat the problem rather than
the cause. Right now, we don’t have any defini-
tive studies that support lowering normal or even
“high normal” blood pressure. So you’ll find most
physicians will encourage small-stroke patients
to lower their high blood pressure.

Preventing Stroke

In this part . . .
T
here are ways to increase your chances of avoiding a
stroke, and that’s what this part is all about. These
three chapters are devoted to reducing risk of stroke in
the future — whether or not you’ve already suffered one.
The two most important factors are avoiding high blood
pressure and reducing the amount of cholesterol in your
blood. And there are other steps you can take to help
avoid stroke — all of them are thoroughly covered in
these chapters.

 Lowering your blood pressure to reduce stroke risk and improve health
 Exploring medications that treat blood pressure
H
igh blood pressure, or hypertension, means high stroke risk. Treatments
that reduce high blood pressure reduce the risk of stroke by 40 percent.
It can’t get much simpler than that. If you’ve had a stroke or transient stroke,
reducing your blood pressure will decrease the chances of having another
stroke.
High blood pressure is a national epidemic. At least 40 million Americans
have high blood pressure — at least 140/90. The older you are, the more
likely you are to have high blood pressure, particularly if you are black. Until
age 50, men are more likely than women to have high blood pressure. After
the age of menopause, women are more likely than men to be hypertensive.
Some estimate that 40 percent of those who suffer from high blood pressure
don’t even know they have it. In a society where stress, obesity, and a land-
scape of convenience-food offerings high in sodium work against healthy
blood pressure, it may be no surprise that hypertension is on the rise. But
what is surprising is that so many folks don’t know they have the condition
when it is so easy to test blood pressure. Even if they receive a bad blood-
pressure report card from their doctor, some still don’t do anything to treat
the condition.
Maybe it’s because high blood pressure kills so slowly. It might be years
before you suffer the consequences: damaged blood vessels, heart disease,
stroke. In the meantime, you may continue to add up the work stress and
salted French fries and cut out most physical activity. And all the while, your
blood is pounding through your vessels at a high-pressure capacity, battering
and scarring the walls and building up atherosclerotic plaque.

Treating your blood pressure early is like investing in retirement. The earlier
you start, the healthier your future will be. Monitoring and controlling your
blood pressure at 30 will reap greater health rewards than if you begin at age
60. Injury to your blood vessels begins early and gets worse with time. So
preventing high blood pressure before the wear and tear begins will serve
you well.
That said, treating blood pressure later is better than never. Even if you are
older and have suffered a heart attack or stroke, the steps you take to reduce
your blood pressure may save your life. Read on to learn just exactly how
blood-pressure problems lead to stroke — and how you can take control of
your condition and reduce your risk.
Stalking the Silent Killer
High blood pressure is sometimes called the silent killer. You can have high
blood pressure for years before you have any sign of problems. As the heart
strains to push the blood at high pressure through arteries, it enlarges, and
the arteries start to show signs of wear. Although you can have atherosclero-
sis (a build-up of plaque on the blood vessel lining) without having high
blood pressure, atherosclerosis is usually much worse and gets worse faster
when accompanied by high blood pressure. And as I have said throughout
the book, high blood pressure is the number-one risk factor for stroke, and
atherosclerosis can cause stroke by formation of blood clots (Figure 8-1).

Part III: Preventing Stroke 

After several years of untreated high blood pressure, you may notice some
changes: You may suffer from headaches and dizzy spells, or you may have
more frequent nosebleeds. As the atherosclerosis worsens, you may develop
poor circulation in your feet.
The condition of your brain generally reflects the poor condition of your
heart and blood vessels. As your vessels are repeatedly injured and continue
collecting cholesterol and calcium in atherosclerotic plaques, clots form at
these sites . . . clots that may be breaking free and traveling downstream to
the brain to cause a stroke. You may begin to have trouble thinking and
remembering as small brain arteries battered by high blood pressure fail.
These arteries, weakened over the years, may even burst, causing a red
stroke.
Understanding blood pressure
Young blood vessels are quite rubbery. When the heart beats, the blood is
forced into the blood vessels under pressure. Like a thick-skinned tree-shaped
balloon, the vessels stretch out and expand a little as the blood moves through
them. When your heart beats, blood is forced through the vessels at the maxi-
mum pressure, called systolic blood pressure. Between heartbeats, the tight 
rubbery girdle of the blood vessels squeezes back down on your blood and
keeps it moving through your arteries. Your blood pressure never drops to
zero between heartbeats because of your elastic blood vessels. The lowest
pressure is called the diastolic blood pressure.
As you get older, atherosclerosis and age make your blood vessels less elastic.
That means it is harder for your heart to keep the average pressure up. The
result? The heart has to beat much harder, creating a higher systolic pressure
and a lower diastolic pressure. What’s interesting is that older people with
high blood pressure have a high systolic pressure, whereas younger individu-
als with high blood pressure have a high diastolic pressure.
Defining high blood pressure
Blood pressure is recorded as two numbers: the highest (systolic) pressure
during a heartbeat over the lowest (diastolic) pressure between beats. For
instance, your doctor may tell you that your blood pressure is 120 over 80 and
write it down as 120/80. (That, by the way, would be good news for you — as
this is an average blood pressure reading.) The highest number, the systolic
pressure, is given first. If you accidentally reverse it, doctors will smile at you
like you said goodbye instead of hello.
137
Chapter 8: High Blood Pressure

If your blood pressure is consistently high after several measurements when
you are not being treated, then you have high blood pressure. But what is
considered high blood pressure? Well, various levels of blood-pressure read-
ings set off different alarms:
 Pre-hypertensive: If your blood pressure is higher than 120/80 but lower
than 140/90, then you are said to be pre-hypertensive and likely to develop
hypertension if you don’t take measures to stave it off. National guide-
lines recommend that you walk more, lose weight, and reduce sodium in
your diet.
 Bad and really bad: If your blood pressure is higher than 140/90 but
lower than 160/100, you have Stage 1 high blood pressure (bad). If your
blood pressure is higher than 160/100, you have Stage 2 high blood pres-
sure (really bad).
Averaging your blood pressure
Some doctors think the important number is the average blood pressure.
You can estimate your average blood pressure by finding the difference
between the highest and lowest blood pressure and adding one third of that
to the lowest blood pressure.
(You can see that this means that the lower blood pressure is twice as influ-
ential in determining your average blood pressure. Don’t you hate it when I
say “you can see” and it isn’t obvious at all? Well, I leave it to the engineers
and accountants to check my math.) The point is that the diastolic blood
pressure is a better measure of how much work your heart is doing to keep
your blood pressure as high as it is and a better estimate of how much wear
and tear there is on your blood vessels.
138
Part III: Preventing Stroke 
Can blood pressure be too low?
It is possible that low blood pressure can put you
at risk. Doctors worry that if you’ve had a stroke,
your blood vessels may not be as flexible and
may be narrowed by a great deal of atheroscle-
rosis. Hence you may need more blood pressure
to force your blood into your brain. Lowering your
blood pressure too much, though, might cause
brain injury from low blood flow.
We just don’t know for sure what the lower limit
is. It probably varies from person to person.
Many believe that the lowest blood pressures
aren’t measured because they occur when you
are asleep. You might discuss this with your
doctor to see if 24-hour blood pressure moni-
toring might change the way your blood pres-
sure is treated. If so, the cost might be worth it.

Getting your blood pressure checked
It’s simple to determine whether your blood pressure is high. You’re familiar
with the little Velcro sleeve the nurse slips on your upper arm. As the nurse
presses the rubber pump, the sleeve tightens, and you watch the needle
swing up and tick down before it rests at the magic number.
You don’t have to wait till your next doctor appointment to check your blood
pressure — just walk into your local drugstore, sit down at the blood pressure
booth near the pharmacy counter, and take your blood pressure yourself.
Don’t cross your legs when you are taking your blood pressure. Just crossing
your legs can sometimes raise your blood pressure a few points. I don’t
know why.
If you’re taking care of someone who can’t make it to the drugstore, you can
buy your own machine. Best things about getting your own machine:
portable, private, easy to use, and available for daily use in a convenient
place. Disadvantages: the cost and inaccuracy if you get the cuff in the wrong
place or don’t get the machine set up correctly.
Battling a life-long threat
So far, most cases of hypertension are never cured. Blood pressure is con-
trolled, not fixed. It is absolutely amazing to me that so many people take
one bottle of blood-pressure pills, find out their blood pressure is better, and
stop, thinking the job is done. They act as if it was an infection that has been
treated.
This isn’t the way it works. You need to take blood-pressure medication every
day for the rest of your life — unless you have an unusual, treatable cause of
the high blood pressure, or a miraculous new treatment is found. Your efforts
will be well worth it in preventing not just heart attack and stroke, but a
number of other life-threatening health conditions (Table 8-1).

Chapter 8: High Blood Pressure

Who’s at Risk for High Blood Pressure
High blood pressure isn’t the result of a single cause. Some circumstances
you can’t control — your age or your family history, for example. Others may
require lifestyle changes or medical solutions. In any event, you’ll benefit by
knowing the range of conditions that may lead to high blood pressure.
Keeping it in the family
If you have high blood pressure, chances are pretty good that someone else
in your family does, as well. If you don’t have high blood pressure, and a
family member does, then, regardless of your age, it’s important for you to
check your blood pressure now and keep a close watch on it through the
years. It is also good motivation to start exercising and keeping your weight
under control now. This can help delay the onset of high blood pressure and
all its problems.
Whether you are hypertensive or doing what you can to prevent high blood
pressure, you can benefit from the experiences of your family members. They
may have tried different drugs, diets, or exercise programs. The drugs and
diets that they find work best may also work best for you. Their experience
is particularly valuable because of their genetic relationship to you.
African Americans
African Americans as a group have a very high rate of high blood pressure. It
starts when they are younger, and they have very high rates of heart attack
and stroke — higher than other groups with the same blood pressure. The
reasons for these differences are not known. For example, it is estimated that
about 36 percent of African Americans have high blood pressure compared to
25 percent of white Americans. African Americans have approximately 50 per-
cent more strokes than white Americans.
African Americans have a higher prevalence of other risk factors, including
diabetes and obesity. There are differences in the care that they receive and
differences in culture and diet. These explain part of the increased stroke
rate in African Americans, but not all of it.
Fortunately, African Americans can be successfully treated for their high
blood pressure. Ask your doctor about different medications. Successful
treatment can usually be achieved with persistence.
140
Part III: Preventing Stroke 

Diet and lifestyle
Extra fat requires your heart to pump extra blood. Time and again, studies
support that losing weight reduces blood pressure. There is a problem,
though: Many people who are overweight have difficulty losing weight. They
may postpone starting medication too long, thinking they will eventually get
their weight under control. In the meantime, the high blood pressure is injur-
ing their arteries.
I am not saying that you should start taking pills and stop worrying about your
weight. Carrying extra weight can also increase the likelihood that you will
develop diabetes and high cholesterol. I am saying that treating your high
blood pressure is critical even before you reach your ideal weight. Additionally,
people within normal weight ranges have high blood pressure, so there is no
guarantee that losing weight will get your pressure under control.
Adding unhealthy sodium through table salt
Fast-food fries are the worst of all foods. Not only are they high in calories
and the worst of all kinds of fats — trans fats — but they also contain massive
amounts of table salt, which can raise blood pressure. Salt that you eat goes
into your bloodstream and is excreted by your kidneys. When the concentra-
tion of salt increases in your blood, water is drawn into the blood from other
tissues to dilute the salt until your kidneys have time to excrete it. The extra
blood volume and extra work for the kidneys increases your blood pressure.
Try restricting salt to see if your blood pressure comes down. If you are living
with someone on a low-salt diet, join in. You get used to the change of taste in
just a few weeks. Throw away your salt shaker and substitute healthy herbs
and spices to enhance the flavors of your food. Your taste for salt will
sharpen as you reduce the amount you add to your food at the table.
Neglecting potassium and calcium in the diet
Diets high in potassium promote better health and may result in lower blood
pressure.
Good sources of potassium are fruits such as cantaloupe, bananas, apricots,
and oranges, as well as dairy products, lean meats, and dried legumes.
Interestingly, salt substitutes often include potassium. So you can kill two birds
with one stone when you’re trying to improve your blood-pressure readings.
Just like potassium, calcium can help reduce your blood pressure. Key sources
of calcium are dairy products — some experts would remind you to use low-fat
dairy products such as skim milk or yogurt. You can also find calcium in sar-
dines, certain grains and legumes, and even vegetables such as broccoli.
Calcium helps maintain bone and muscle tissue — particularly important as
you recover from stroke.
141
Chapter 8: High Blood Pressure

Alcohol: A little is good, a lot is bad
Those who have one drink of alcohol per day have a reduced risk of stroke
and heart attack. That doesn’t mean that if you don’t drink you should start —
it’s never been shown in a clinical trial that adding one glass of alcohol per day
will help those who drink less. But for those who enjoy alcohol in moderation,
at least this is one pleasure in life that may not be bad for you.
Key word being moderation. More than two to three drinks of alcohol per day
can add to your risk of high blood pressure. In addition, if you have a brain
injured by stroke, you shouldn’t be drinking that much, anyway. Alcohol can
be much more intoxicating for those with injured brains. And, of course, alco-
hol is known to directly injure the brain when consumed in large quantities. If
you are drinking too much now, after a stroke, look hard at whether you are
depressed. Antidepressants work much better than alcohol and don’t raise
your blood pressure.
Would you believe bad kidneys?
Problems with your kidneys may raise your blood pressure. They play a
major role in controlling your blood pressure by controlling the volume of
blood and the amount of sodium and potassium in the blood. Any disease
of the kidneys may affect blood pressure. It is particularly critical if you are
young and have especially high blood pressure to check out your kidneys.
One cause of high blood pressure that may be treatable is narrowing of the
artery that takes blood to one kidney or the other. The usual cause is a plaque
of atherosclerosis in the main artery to one or both kidneys. If the blood flow
through one of the kidneys is reduced too much, your blood pressure can go
very high. Doctors can often open up the arteries with catheter tubes and
small balloons inside your arteries. A metal stent is left in place to keep the
artery open. If that doesn’t work, surgery is possible.
Identifying other medical problems
Some cases of high blood pressure are caused by uncommon medical prob-
lems. You may want to have blood tests to see if you have any of the diseases
listed here. The tests are expensive and odds are you probably don’t have
the diseases. If severe enough to cause high blood pressure, these conditions
usually manifest in other symptoms as well.
142

Disease
Cause
Hyperthyroidism
Too much thyroid hormone
Pheochromocytoma
A small adrenal gland tumor
Hyperaldosteronism

One of these conditions, pheochromocytoma, can be very elusive and hard to
diagnose. High blood pressure unresponsive to treatment may be the only
symptom.
Drugs that may lead to high

Many medications contain chemicals that can raise blood pressure. Here a
few of the most common offenders:
 High doses of aspirin and similar drugs
 Decongestants
 Diet aids
 Steroids

Chapter 8: High Blood Pressure
Sleep apnea: Sign of high blood pressure
We are just beginning to learn about sleep
apnea, a condition associated with loud snoring
and gasping during sleep. In some individuals,
the back of the throat collapses when they sleep,
and blocks the air pathway to the lungs. The
result is long periods of time between breaths.
This condition is aggravated by excess weight.
Patients with sleep apnea often have high blood
pressure. It’s not known whether treatment will
reduce blood pressure, but some people feel
much better when they use a mask attached to
pressure breathing machines at night. Some
surgeons offer treatments for sleep apnea. Be
especially diligent about seeking a wide range
of second opinions before agreeing to such
surgery — especially if you have already had a
stroke.

You’re wise to consider and list all medications — including diet supplements,
diet aids, and vitamins — you take. Even the medicated salve that you rub on
your sore muscles goes on the list. Birth-control pills, Viagra — the whole
medicine cabinet. Then show the list to your doctor who is working with you
to manage your stroke risk and every doctor who prescribes medication for
you. It is important to have a complete list not only in relation to your high
blood pressure, but because such supplements may interact in an undesirable
way with other medications you may be prescribed.
Lowering Blood Pressure
to Reduce Stroke
What are the benefits of treating blood pressure? For people who have never
had a stroke, treating blood pressure cuts the risk of stroke nearly in half. In
older patients, treating people with systolic high blood pressure reduces
the chances of dementia (see Chapter 7) by half. If you’ve had a stroke, the
chances you will have a second one are reduced by 30 percent if you treat
your high blood pressure.
There isn’t much good data on how much to lower the blood pressure. Most
evidence shows that the lower, the better. However, in the majority of stud-
ies, the average reduction in blood pressure has been only about ten points.
If there isn’t a treatable cause of high blood pressure (hyperthyroidism, for
example), there are two basic ways to lower your blood pressure:
 Diet and exercise
 Medication
Because they don’t treat the cause of the high blood pressure, these treat-
ments have to be continued as long as you live — or until someone figures
out a treatment that permanently fixes the problem. Regular and frequent
monitoring of your blood pressure helps ensure that your treatment program
is working. If you are taking medicine for blood pressure, you should still
exercise and eat a healthy diet.
Control through diet and exercise
If you’re overweight, consume an unhealthy menu of high-sodium and high-
fat foods, and you avoid regular exercise, you may be able to lower your
144
Part III: Preventing Stroke 

blood pressure by making some positive lifestyle changes. Even if you are
recovering from a stroke, you can follow these recommendations:
 Exercise enough to make you breathe faster.
 Get your weight under control.
 Eat more fruits high in potassium (such as cantaloupe, bananas, apri-
cots, and oranges).
 Restrict your sodium intake by cutting back on table salt.
 Consume low-fat dairy products to increase your calcium.
 Enjoy alcohol up to one or two drinks per day but avoid more.
 Avoid cold tablets and diet drugs that have warnings about high blood
pressure.
Control with medication
Because I’m a doctor, you may think I am too quick to turn to drugs to lower
blood pressure. The truth is, too many who suffer from high blood pressure
are too slow to start treating it in the most successful manner possible.
Although diet and exercise may help lower blood pressure, they alone are
often not as effective as medication. This may be because people can’t keep
up the effort, or their lives don’t really allow for them to — or because the
underlying cause is not related to their diet.
But taking medication does require you to be responsible. You must take
the prescription as directed and get needed testing on time to make sure the
drug is working and not causing dangerous side effects. If your blood pres-
sure is especially difficult to control — not uncommon — you may need to
take two or more drugs to get your pressure below 140/90. If so, then you
have to be aware of all the possible ways the two drugs can cause problems
together that they wouldn’t cause alone.
Lowering blood pressure too much
Drugs can reduce your blood pressure too far. As I go through the different
types of drugs in the following sections, I won’t repeat this warning for each
different type. If your blood pressure is too low, then you will feel light headed
or weak. When you stand up suddenly, your blood pressure may drop so low
that you faint or almost faint. If you are having these symptoms, call your
doctor. You’ll probably be told to stop taking the medicine. This doesn’t mean
forever, though. This means you change the type of medicine or the dose
before trying again to adjust the prescription to your system.

Chapter 8: High Blood Pressure

Don’t stop taking blood-pressure medicine suddenly without checking
with your doctor. Your blood pressure may “rebound” or shoot up higher
than ever as the restraint of the drug is suddenly released — this can be 
dangerous.
A trial-and-error process
A lot of people are concerned about taking medicine. If you are one of them,
don’t overreact to failure by quitting. Getting your blood pressure under con-
trol is a trial-and-error process that may require a lot of telephone calls and
visits to your doctor. Be sure you have a doctor you can work with and who
is patient with your sensitivity. Make sure you have a clear channel of com-
munication. You should be able to talk to either a doctor or nurse when you
call to report a problem serious enough to make you think you should stop
the drug.
For men only
A possible side effect with almost all blood-pressure medications is impo-
tence. If you are an older man, especially if you have just had a stroke, prob-
lems getting and keeping an erection can already be an issue. Any preexisting
problems may potentially get worse when you start blood-pressure medica-
tion. Usually, any problems can be resolved by either adjusting the dose or
changing the drug — bring up the issue with your doctor.
Drugs for Lowering Blood Pressure
Most doctors will start treating high blood pressure with one of two inexpen-
sive and effective drugs that have very few side effects and are well-tolerated
by most people with high blood pressure. These drugs are the diuretics and
beta blockers. But there are dozens of alternatives. Eventually you can find a
drug or combination of drugs that works for you.
If you have just had a stroke or have other problems with your memory, you
may need a system to be sure you don’t miss a dose — or take a double dose.
Even people with good memories can benefit from such a system. Those little
plastic containers that allow you to set out your pills for a week at a time are
very useful for this — you’ll find them at any drugstore. Keeping written
records works as well, especially when you are taking several medications
several times a day. That way you can check the list before you take each set
of pills.

Part III: Preventing Stroke 

Thiazide diuretics: Water pills
Thiazide diuretics are a class of drugs that decrease blood pressure by
increasing the amount of salt excreted by the kidneys. The salt, eliminated
through your urine, takes a lot of water with it. You will find yourself headed
to the bathroom more frequently. To avoid dehydration and constipation, you
will need to start drinking more water. You may be waking up in the middle
of the night unless you take your dose in the morning. Of the many thiazides,
hydrochlorthiazide is the most common. Doses of 12.5 milligrams to 25 mil-
ligrams are safest. If the dose gets higher, be sure you don’t want to change
to another drug. If 25 mg works well, ask your doctor if you can try 12.5 to
see if you can get the same result.
You want to take the lowest effective dosage to minimize potential side
effects. Thiazides may potentially do any of the following:
 Deplete potassium: Symptoms of low blood potassium are not anything
special — something vaguely like the flu. Regular blood tests can catch
this problem easily, but it is so uncommon at low doses that many doc-
tors will only check if you already show symptoms. If you start thiazides
and then find yourself feeling run down, tired, and weak, be sure to men-
tion this to your doctor and ask if you need a blood test for potassium.
 Aggravate diabetes: This usually occurs only when higher doses are
used. Checking your blood regularly can help detect these problems.
 Raise cholesterol levels: At higher doses, blood-pressure medications
may increase cholesterol levels in the blood. Routine blood tests are
important to monitor.
 Constipation and dehydration: Drink more water to avoid these
common side effects.
 Interact with other drugs: Before beginning a thiazide prescription, be
sure to let your doctor know if you are taking digitalis, coumadin, lithium,
vitamin D, gout drugs, or drugs for diabetes. The doses of these drugs
may have to be changed if you must take them when you are on thiazides.
Beta blockers: The anti-adrenalin
Beta blockers are drugs that work on your nervous system to lower blood
pressure. They have the opposite effect of adrenalin, reducing the pulse rate
and the forcefulness of heartbeats. Beta blockers have been shown to be par-
ticularly beneficial for patients who have had heart attacks and evidence of
severe atherosclerosis.
147
Chapter 8: High Blood Pressure

If you are a bundle of nerves living under constant stress and pushing your-
self too hard, beta blockers, accompanied by an exercise program, may be
the course for you. Although they are not sedatives or muscle relaxers, beta
blockers blunt some of the physical aspects of anger and tension. You may
find yourself more relaxed when giving speeches and more in control when

Reducing blood pressure is 
a life-long commitment
A 54-year-old man went to his physician because
his daughter had told him he should have a
colonoscopy for early detection of colon cancer.
During his exam, he mentioned he had had a
spell a month or two earlier in which the left side
of his face and left arm felt numb. He felt a little
dizzy at the time and then the spell cleared up
within minutes. The doctor checked his blood
pressure: 155/102. The doctor asked him if he had
tested for high blood pressure before. The man
said he did years ago, but he had changed his
diet and it had returned to almost normal. He
didn’t go back to see his doctor and had not had
his blood pressure checked for several years.
His business was very demanding and stressful
and he just didn’t have time. He was referred to
a neurologist, who ordered an MRI scan. The
scan showed several small strokes at the base
of the brain and in its central core. His examina-
tion was normal and he had no recollection of
any other spells. The neurologist listened to his
neck and ordered an ultrasound test to see if
there was narrowing of any major brain arteries.
There was a thick plaque of atherosclerosis in
his carotid artery but it was not thick enough to
require surgery. He returned to his regular
doctor.
He was started on thiazide diuretics, 25 mil-
ligrams per day, and advised to check his blood
pressure every day for the next week before
returning to his physician’s office. His blood
pressure declined over the ensuing week to
142/94. He continued the same dose for another
two weeks. His blood pressure remained high
at 144/92. His doctor then prescribed a low 40-
milligram dose of propranolol twice per day.
Two weeks later, his blood pressure was 138/86.
His pulse rate was 66. The doctor increased his
dose to 80 milligrams two times per day. Two
weeks later his pulse rate was 60 and his blood
pressure 130/80. He continued on this regimen.
In the meantime, the doctor had found that he
had elevated blood cholesterol and low HDL. He
was started on statins and referred to a cardi-
ologist for a full work-up.
The man became annoyed at all the time his
medical care was taking. He felt his business
needed him at the moment and that he would
start taking better care of himself after the cur-
rent crisis was over. He canceled his cardiolo-
gist appointments for several months and failed
to renew his prescriptions. One morning while
getting the newspaper, he started having
unusual left-side chest pain. He went to the
emergency room. No evidence of a heart attack
was found, but his blood pressure was 162/108.
He was referred back to his doctors to resume
treatment of his blood pressure. This time he
went to his appointments.

tempers might otherwise flare. While on beta blockers, feelings of frustration,
fear, or anger may not translate as readily into the physical signs of high
pulse rate, red face, or dry mouth.
Beta blockers can have side effects, however. They can aggravate asthma,
increasing the frequency and severity of attacks. They can interfere with the
normal rhythm of the heart. Because they take some of the force out of your
heartbeat, they can cause fatigue and limit your ability to exercise.
Rebound high blood pressure is a risk if you suddenly stop your beta-blocker
medication. If the dose is too high or you accidentally take an extra tablet,
your pulse rate may drop too low, a dangerous situation. The pulse rate
shouldn’t get too far below 60. Unfortunately, beta blockers can also blunt
your body’s normal reaction to low blood sugar — sweating and anxiety. This
can be dangerous for you if you are a diabetic taking insulin because you may
not be able to tell when your blood sugar is dangerously low.
ACE inhibitors: New kids on the block
Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors are relatively new drugs.
They are free of many of the side effects of thiazides and beta blockers, but
clinical trials indicate they may be less effective than other drugs in lowering
blood pressure. They have been shown to be particularly effective in the
treatment of heart failure and can be a desirable alternative to beta blockers
or thiazides — especially for diabetics and patients with kidney disease.
Be aware that there are some potentially serious side effects. ACE inhibitors
can raise the level of potassium in your blood (opposite of thiazides, which
lower the level). Having plenty of natural potassium in your diet is usually
good, even when taking ACE inhibitors. Special potassium supplements and
salt substitutes may not be such a good idea, though, when combined with
ACE inhibitors. Check with your doctor.
Potassium in your diet does not usually raise your blood potassium levels
because healthy kidneys keep it under control. But high potassium levels in
your blood can be dangerous. This high-potassium reaction is more common
in patients with kidney disease and heart failure. The best way to monitor it
is to check blood levels of potassium after starting the drug. Other than slow,
possibly irregular, pulse, there are no symptoms. ACE inhibitors have another
unusual side effect: In a number of people, the drugs cause a chronic dry
hacking cough. Some people hardly notice it; others can’t stand it.
As with any blood-pressure medication, check your blood pressure frequently
after starting the drug to be sure it’s not too high or too low. ACE inhibitors
can cause a rapid drop in blood pressure, particularly if you are dehydrated.
149
Chapter 8: High Blood Pressure

Calcium antagonists and other drugs
Calcium antagonists — or calcium channel blockers — were introduced after thi-
azides and beta blockers, but before ACE inhibitors, for the purpose of treating
the most difficult cases of high blood pressure that seemed to remain resistant
to other medications. They work by directly inhibiting the contraction of the
muscles in the blood vessels. The result is blood vessels that have larger diam-
eters and are easier for the blood to pass through. That means it takes less
pressure to move the blood. Calcium channel blockers can cause headache
and flushing. Occasionally they lead to mild swelling of the legs. Like ACE
inhibitors, they work well for patients with diabetes or kidney disease.
If a case of high blood pressure is extremely resistant to treatment, other
drugs may be prescribed. It’s beyond the scope of this book to describe all
the medications that can be used in these difficult cases. The more difficult
the treatment, the more important it is for you to get regular blood tests and
to check your blood pressure frequently.
High blood pressure may be called the silent killer — but its devastation is
anything but quiet. When nearly a third of the adults in the United States
have high blood pressure, and 40 percent of them are unaware of it, the
potential damage this insidious villain can inflict is frightening. Whether
you’re recovering from a stroke — or you’re just committed to preventing
one — perhaps the most important and easiest step you can take to protect
yourself is to keep tabs on your blood pressure. If it’s high, follow a course of
diet and medication to lower it to a healthy level — and eliminate that silent
killer so that it is no longer a threat.

F
at gets a bad rap in the press. True, it’s not good to carry around an extra
20 pounds, nor should you indulge in a bacon cheeseburger and fries too
often. Fact is, though, fat is an important part of our diet and an essential com-
ponent of our bodies. We require some reserves of fat in our body and we need
to keep that store supplied by calories taken in the form of fat.
But too much fat — in our diet and, subsequently, in our body and blood —
leads to serious health consequences, not the least of which is stroke. In a
nutshell, if the body’s cholesterol level is too high, atherosclerosis develops
(check out the glossary for more on this condition), which can lead to heart
attack and stroke. A fat-heavy diet — too many pork chops and four-egg
omelets — can certainly weigh down your blood with dangerously high levels
of a fat called cholesterol. But in some people, the propensity for high blood
cholesterol can’t be controlled by diet, and drugs may be required to lower
the cholesterol to a safe level.
What makes cholesterol such a villain? Is cholesterol all bad? How do we go
from pizza to white stroke? What’s fat got to do with blood clots in the brain?
That’s what this chapter’s all about.
Fat and the Body
Researchers continue to explore the relationship between fat and atheroscle-
rosis, heart disease, and stroke. Newspapers and magazines bombard us with
information. Sometimes, small studies showing a possible trend, without
definitive results, are widely published.

The result is that doctors and patients have jumped to conclusions that
haven’t been borne out in clinical trials. Some studies have showed that people
who ate more cholesterol had more heart disease. It took a long time before
trials were done to see what happened when people intentionally reduced the
cholesterol in their diet compared to those who didn’t. The trials didn’t show a
consistent difference. Now more trials are beginning to build a solid foundation
that outlines the opportunities available to you as a stroke patient and some-
one at risk of atherosclerosis and heart disease.
What we have learned with a great deal of confidence is that the amount and
type of fat in your blood is more important than the amount of fat that you
eat. And the amount of fat you eat is less important than the type of fat you eat.
Fat: Slow-burning fuel
The way fat in your diet is turned into fuel for your daily energy needs is
pretty interesting. And complicated. Basically, a carefully controlled, slow-
burning fire from within combines oxygen with fuel to produce heat, water,
and carbon dioxide.
We breathe in oxygen and breathe out carbon dioxide. We consume food and
excrete the unusable “ashes” of our internal fires. The more complex sugars
and starches in our diet are rapidly converted to glucose and similar simple
sugars. These act as quick-burning, readily converted fuel throughout our
systems — sort of like gasoline. Proteins burn more slowly, perhaps like coal,
with many complex reactions.
The fats are the slowest-burning form of fuel. They are akin to petroleum oil,
perhaps — highly concentrated, complex stores of energy. Pound for pound,
fat contains twice the energy of sugar or protein. Fat’s form of energy, how-
ever, isn’t immediately available. Fats have to be refined and processed in
your cells before their energy can be recovered and used.
So what happened to that salted butter that drenched your large popcorn at
the movies last night? Or the egg-and-sausage biscuits you packed away for
breakfast this morning? Or the pizza with extra cheese you grabbed for dinner?
Here are the gruesome details.
Breaking down fat in the digestive system
Converting the fat we eat requires special digestive enzymes that are made in
the liver and pancreas. The liver is essentially a large chemical processing
unit that handles most of the complex reactions involved with the digestion
of food and the removal of many toxins from the blood. The pancreas is also
152
Part III: Preventing Stroke 

a digestive organ but is more specialized. It makes insulin to control blood
glucose levels and also makes powerful digestive enzymes to dissolve and
break down the fats that we eat.
The fat in our food doesn’t dissolve very easily. Ever try to clean up grease
spilled on the floor? As you attempt to wipe, it smears around. Water alone
doesn’t help. You have to add soap. The soap dissolves some of the fat and
forms little globules with grease in the middle and soap around the outside
in a protective shell that will dissolve in water. What you get is a slurry of
water made cloudy with tiny spherical globules of soap-ringed grease.
Something similar happens in the lower part of the stomach as food leaves
to enter the small intestine. The soap used by the body is called bile. The
liver produces bile, which breaks the fat into small globules and works with
the lipase from the pancreas to reduce the fat molecules to their constituent
parts so that they can be absorbed by the small intestine. The small intestine
churns the fat together with the bile and slowly absorbs the fat.
Fat begets fat. Special fat receptors in the stomach slow down the release
of fatty food into the intestine — so that the intestines don’t overload the
bloodstream with large amounts of fat. Slowing the digestion in the stomach
brings its own problems. Food left for hours ferments and irritates the 
stomach. Your grumbling stomach wants solace. You feel hungry (ever
crave a few scoops of ice cream hours after you eat pizza?). Fat in your
system is unique in that it encourages you to eat more.
The stomach churns the fat into small globules that can also be readily
attacked by lipases, enzymes produced by the small intestines and the pan-
creas. Lipases take the large fat molecules in our bacon burgers and omelets
and break them down into simpler fat molecules, which are smaller and can
pass through the membranes of cells lining the intestines and then into the
bloodstream to pass through the liver or directly to the heart. Along the way,
tiny fat globules are coated with special proteins that work a little like soap
to keep the fat dissolved in the blood. This system is highly efficient — about
95 percent of the fat you take in makes it into your bloodstream!
Getting to Know the Two Types of Fat:
Cholesterol and Triglycerides
Before I go further into fat’s journey through the bloodstream, allow me to
introduce you to the two major forms of fat we find in the body and in the
food we take into our body:
 Cholesterol
 Triglycerides
153
Chapter 9: Fat and Stroke Risk

Cholesterol is waxy
Cholesterol is manufactured in our body — almost four-fifths of the choles-
terol in your blood is homemade right in your liver. We also take in choles-
terol when we eat meat, cheese and dairy products, and eggs.
Cholesterol is a waxy form of fat, quite firm and water-repellent. It is present
in all cells as part of the outer cell membrane, with the highest concentration
in the sheath that wraps around nerve fibers. This fat called cholesterol has
some special functions: It forms the molecular backbone of several hormones,
including estrogen and testosterone. And it is a fundamental component of 
vitamin D and the bile we need to emulsify fats when they are digested.
The processing of fats varies from person to person, depending on diet and
genetics. Some individuals have unusually high levels of cholesterol in their
blood despite consuming a cholesterol-free diet. This can usually be traced to
an inherited abnormal enzyme or molecular abnormality.
The amount of cholesterol you should allow in your diet each day is a scant
300 milligrams, one-third of a gram. So it depends on what you eat: A boiled
egg, for example, contains about 225 mg of cholesterol; a chicken breast,
around 60 mg. As vital as it is to your cells, you can eat only a small amount
of cholesterol before it becomes a threat to the health of your blood vessels.
Triglycerides are greasy or oily
Triglycerides are the most common type of fat in our diet and in our bodies.
Think of vegetable oil, olive oil, and shortening. Salads are dressed with
them, potatoes are fried in them, foccacio is dipped in them.
There are three classes of triglycerides:
 Saturated: Solids, such as shortening and butter
 Unsaturated: Liquid, such as vegetable and fish oils
 Trans: Begin as unsaturated, but hydrogen is added for processing and
longer shelf life (such as hydrogenated vegetable oil in peanut butter)
Unsaturated fats are the most benign of the triglycerides. In fact, these fats
can be downright good for you (more about that in the next section).
But watch out for saturated and trans fats. These forms of fat cause the body to
produce more cholesterol, increasing the risk of atherosclerosis and, subse-
quently, heart disease and stroke.
154
Part III: Preventing Stroke 

Dieticians recommend that all the fats combined provide only 25 to 35 per-
cent of the calories in our diet. This generally means we should eat no more
than 60 to 100 grams — 4 to 8 tablespoons — of fat per day, depending on
body size and how much food we consume. Candy bars, donuts, cookies, and
hotdogs can, by themselves, contain a tablespoon or two of fat.
So, to summarize: Cholesterol, needed by the body in small amounts, is primar-
ily produced by your body, though you can raise your cholesterol level by 
consuming more cholesterol — found in animal products. Or you can increase
your cholesterol by eating some forms of triglycerides — specifically saturated
and trans fats — which cause your body to produce more cholesterol. Now,
how does all that fat get around your body?
Fat Transporters: HDL, LDL, and Others
The bloodstream is a highway-transport system that carries fats to their des-
tination. But it’s a water-based system, and water and fats just don’t behave
well when they get together. So to keep peace, special transport proteins
serve as bodyguards, accompanying fats on their journey. Without these
bodyguards, the fats and the water in the bloodstream would “mix it up,”
causing all sorts of traffic jams and congestion in your blood vessels.
To prevent that, here’s what happens: After they are processed in the intes-
tine and absorbed into the intestinal cells, fats are packaged in small droplets
protected by the proteins. These fat-protein packages are called lipoproteins.
There are four types of lipoproteins. Their long names are real tongue-
twisters, but you may already be familiar with their nicknames.
HDL: The good
HDL, which stands for high-density lipoprotein, is recognized as the good fat
transporter. HDL’s smooth surfaces do not stick to the blood vessels — thus,
no clogging of the thruways and risk of blood clots. Another favorable attribute
is that HDL collects cholesterol from other tissues and brings it back to the
liver for processing and excretion. This lipoprotein, then, not only reliably 
carries its passengers to their destinations, it finds the bad guys and turns
them in for deportation.
The functions of lipoproteins circulating in the blood are very complex, and
the relationship of blood vessel health, heart disease, and stroke is not com-
pletely understood. Study after study, however, supports the finding that
people who have more HDL in their blood have less heart disease and stroke.
155
Chapter 9: Fat and Stroke Risk

LDL: The bad
If HDL is good, then LDL — low-density lipoprotein — is recognized as the bad fat
transporter. LDL has earned its reputation for a few reasons. It is the major car-
rier of cholesterol through the blood vessels. LDL doesn’t hold tightly to the
cholesterol or triglycerides that they carry, depositing them throughout the
body’s tissues. LDL’s outer surfaces are coated with proteins that stick to blood
vessels and attract a lot of mean friends, including white blood cells and
platelets that get into the fray and invite their own friends. The result is a waxy
plaque of atherosclerosis that begins to enlarge as more LDL collects at the site.
VLDL: The ugly
These very-low-density lipoproteins are fat trucks that contain little protein
but are loaded with triglycerides delivered to fat and muscle cells for storage.
VLDL particles are formed in the liver from excess fat or sugar in the diet.
They have a triglyceride core with a thin layer of protein. VLDL breaks up
easily, and the fragments of their wrecks expose blood vessels and other tis-
sues to the toxic effects of their hard, fat cores.
Chylomicrons
Chylomicrons are fat and protein particles that transport both cholesterol and
triglycerides from the intestine directly to the rest of the body. The source of
HDL, LDL, and VLDL particles is the liver. The small intestine is the source of
chylomicrons. Unlike most food you eat, fat carried by chylomicrons
bypasses the liver and goes directly to the rest of your body where the oils
and hard fats are removed for storage in fat or muscle cells.
Chylomicrons are largely triglyceride fats and, as such, not healthy. They
increase your risk for heart disease, although the relationship to stroke is not
as clear. They are controlled the same ways that LDL is. When LDL is elevated,
the triglycerides are often elevated, too. The focus among doctors now is gen-
erally to focus on lowering the LDL cholesterol while keeping an eye on the
chylomicrons/triglycerides to be sure they come down as well.
The stroke connection
So what does all this have to do with stroke? These fats and their bodyguard
lipoproteins can irritate the sensitive lining of your blood vessels. This leads
156
Part III: Preventing Stroke 

to atherosclerosis. Once irritated, the blood vessels can become increasingly
inflamed, scarred, and overlaid with potholes and patches. Eventually, the
atherosclerotic plaque ruptures and blocks the vessel entirely or becomes so
rough that stroke-causing clots form there. Either way, white stroke can
result.
Testing for Fat Trouble in Your Body
How do you know you’re at risk for stroke because of high cholesterol? Not
necessarily from the numbers on your bathroom scale — though if you’re
carrying a spare tire around your waist, that may be a bad sign. But getting a
sense of the shape you’re in is a starting point. Checking your blood for levels
of cholesterol and its components is the next step.
Your weight is not always an accurate indicator of your cholesterol level.
Thin people can have high cholesterol, and overweight individuals may have
healthy cholesterol readings. That said, weight is often an indicator for heart
disease, and a suggestion that cholesterol may need to be investigated.
Body mass index
The following Body Mass Index (BMI) table is a tool to help you assess your
health risk due to your weight. Find your height on the left and scan across to
find your weight. The figure at the top of your weight’s row is your body mass.
If your body mass is greater than 24, you are officially at higher risk of heart
disease, diabetes, and stroke. (Desirable values are in gray. Values lower than
18 are unusual and may not be healthy for some people. Check with your
doctor.)
157
Chapter 9: Fat and Stroke Risk
Pears take heart
Shape may be another clue that the heart and
brain are at risk because of weight. Studies indi-
cate that “apples,” individuals who carry weight
at the waist or higher, may have a greater risk
for heart attack, diabetes, and stroke than those
who tend to put on weight around their hips.
“Pears” may fret about their bottom-heavy fig-
ures, but they’re apt to be healthier than their
“apple” counterparts. Even if your BMI is 24 or
lower, you may be at higher risk if you are a man
with a waist larger than 40 inches or a woman
with a 35-inch or larger waist.

Testing your blood for cholesterol
The most accurate way for determining your blood lipid levels is to have
your blood tested under fasting conditions (see next section for more).
Typically, a single blood sample can be used to measure cholesterol and
triglycerides, as well as the three lipoproteins in your cholesterol. The results
help you and your doctor estimate your cardiovascular risk.

Part III: Preventing Stroke 

If your cholesterol or LDL levels continue to cause concern despite adequate
treatment, further testing may be done. Although it’s a more expensive and
complicated test, lipoprotein phenotyping may be needed to determine exact
levels of each of the four lipoproteins. The test can help identify inherited
tendencies toward high cholesterol levels.
Although not related to lipid levels, two other tests for determining stroke
risk are often done from the same blood sample: homocysteine and C-reactive
protein tests. These two elements, when present at certain levels, predict
increased risk of stroke. When blood vessels are injured or irritated, white
blood cells, platelets, and other components of the blood signal a problem to
the rest of the body. When the liver receives the signal, it produces C-reactive
protein. You want your test results to show 10 or fewer micromoles per liter
for homocysteine — and you don’t want to see any measure of C-reactive pro-
tein in your blood.
Fasting before your blood test
All the interpretations of the blood lipid test results are based on the assump-
tion that you eat nothing for 12 hours prior to the test. It is not the goal to
analyze the fat content of your food, but to estimate the load of fat you carry
in your blood between meals.
159
Chapter 9: Fat and Stroke Risk
Drugs that affect your blood test
Prior to a blood test for lipids, follow your physi-
cian’s restrictions on diet, exercise, and med-
ication use. Some substances can affect
the accuracy of test results. Increased choles-
terol levels may be reported if you take the 
following:
ACTH
anabolic steroids
beta-adrenergic 
corticosteroids
blocking agents
epinephrine
oral contraceptives
phenytoin
sulfonamides
thiazide diuretics
vitamin D
Lower values for cholesterol may result from
taking the following:
Allopurinol
androgens
Captopril
chlorpropamide
Clofibrate
colchicine
Colestipol
erythromycin
Isoniazid
lovastatin
MAO inhibitors
neomycin
niacin (vitamin B3)
nitrates
Tell your doctor about all prescription and over-
the-counter medications you are taking. By the
same token, don’t skip taking prescribed medi-
cine the morning of your blood test without
checking with your physician.

You’ve read how almost every bit of fat in the diet gets into the bloodstream
one way or another. And how fat in the stomach slows down the digestive
process. It takes up to 10 hours to clear all the fat from your last meal out of
your blood. If you forget and eat something, don’t bother to have the tests
done — you may as well throw the results away because only the HDL and
total cholesterol levels will be close to accurate. You need the LDL values.
Just in case you were thinking of really starving yourself to have a good test,
you shouldn’t wait more than 14 hours or the results may be changed by
your body’s response to the prolonged fasting.
Interpreting blood test results
Upon review of your blood test results, your doctor will take into account
your unique set of circumstances to evaluate and offer an action plan. But
“normal” ranges of blood lipids help provide guidelines for patients and pro-
fessionals alike. Your treatment plan will depend on a great many factors
including your age, your prior history of heart disease and stroke, whether or
not you have diabetes, and other risk factors. There are guidelines but they
are not simple to read, and they are updated as new information is gained
from ongoing clinical trials.
Desirable values for cholesterol, triglycerides, and the lipoprotein breakdown
are as follows:
Test
Desirable Value
Cholesterol, total
100–199 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter)
Triglycerides
0–149 mg/dL
HDL
40–59 mg/dL
LDL
0–99 mg/dL
VLDL
5–40 mg/dL
160
Part III: Preventing Stroke 
What fat food looks like in your bloodstream
If you eat a fat-heavy meal and then draw blood
a few hours later, the blood will settle into three
layers — a fat parfait, if you will: red cells at the
bottom; a thin, faint-yellow layer of white blood
cells in the middle; and, on top, a milky layer of
serum cloudy with the fat from the meal.
Sometimes there can be so much fat that the
top layer looks like whipped cream. It takes four
to six hours to clear this fat out of your blood.
This is one reason to fast before blood tests
that measure cholesterol and other fats in the
bloodstream.

Total cholesterol
When talking about blood lipids, people are no doubt most familiar with the
target for total cholesterol, the sum of all the lipoprotein components. The
desirable range is below 200 milligrams per deciliter. Levels greater than 240
predict a very high risk of stroke and heart disease. Until menopause, women
tend to have lower levels of cholesterol than men the same age. Values for
both men and women tend to increase with age. Pregnancy, when cholesterol
levels tend to be high, is an exception.
Triglyceride levels
Normal levels are less than 150 mg/dL (milligrams per deciliter). Higher
values mean higher risk for stroke and heart disease. Very high levels of
triglycerides require treatment similar to that for high LDL.
HDL levels
Remember, HDL is the good fat transporter, so a higher range of this lipopro-
tein is positive news. An HDL reading above 40 is desirable; at 60 or above
is even better. At this level, some think the HDL will start carrying excess
cholesterol out of the body, reducing the likelihood of atherosclerosis inside
your blood vessels. Some recommend that for women 45 and older, the target
HDL should be 60.
LDL levels
A desirable level of LDL — the bad fat transporter — is 99 milligrams or
lower. Whether this or another level of LDL is your treatment goal depends
on the plan you work out with your doctor. An LDL level above 190 is a red-
light condition for your heart and brain.
Cholesterol-to-HDL ratio
Some research indicates that the ratio of the cholesterol level to HDL level
also predicts the occurrence of stroke and heart disease. Divide the choles-
terol level by the HDL level. According to the American Heart Association,
the level of total cholesterol should not be more than five times the level of
HDL (a ratio of 5:1).
I don’t hear this ratio used as much by physicians, who tend to look sepa-
rately at the cholesterol and HDL levels. Using the ratio might let a few
feel better about their high cholesterol over 200 if their HDL level was 
high.
161
Chapter 9: Fat and Stroke Risk

Diet and Cholesterol Control
Following a diet low in cholesterol and saturated and trans fats is a smart
move. But it may not be enough to get your blood lipids to a safe level if you
have an inherent predisposition to high cholesterol — or you simply have a
hard time passing up the fried chicken and gravy.
Eating right versus eating less
Eating right and eating less are too different issues. Eating right to reduce
your cholesterol levels and decrease stroke risk means changing the type and
the amount of fat in your diet. It means replacing saturated and trans fats in
your diet with unsaturated fat. It means checking your blood levels of HDL
and LDL and making sure they are in or moving toward the healthy range.
These days, many people are appropriately concerned about their weight.
Obesity by itself increases risk of stroke and heart disease. Obesity can cause
and aggravate high blood pressure. Obesity also increases risk of diabetes,
which injures blood vessels and accelerates the process of atherosclerosis,
leading to stroke and heart attacks.
It’s not a bad strategy to eat less and eat right. I suggest, however, trying to
keep your weight down, but giving a priority to keeping the LDL and total
cholesterol in your blood in the healthy range.
162
Part III: Preventing Stroke 
Causes of high cholesterol
Diet
Genetic factors
Liver disease or hepatitis caused by alcohol or
infection
Hypothyroidism
Kidney disease
Uncontrolled diabetes
Bile-duct obstruction of the liver usually due to
gall bladder problems
Inflammation or infection of the pancreas

What’s the right diet?
For anyone who wants to control their blood lipids, I recommend one of two
courses: If you’re diabetic, follow a diabetic diet that not only controls the fats
in your diet but also controls the total number of calories, avoiding rapidly
absorbed sugar (see the nutrition page at the American Diabetes Association
Web site at www.diabetes.org). If you’re not diabetic, follow the American
Heart Association diet recommendations, which include limiting saturated
and trans fats, substituting low-fat dairy products for their whole-milk coun-
terparts, and eating a greater proportion of calories in fruits, vegetables, and
grains. (For complete dietary guidelines, visit www.americanheart.org.)
Some scientists praise the Mediterranean diet, which focuses on vegetables,
legumes, fruits, nuts, grains, and fats from olives and vegetable oils as well as
a relatively high emphasis on fish. Studies show that following an eating plan
traditional to many Mediterranean countries may result in lower cholesterol
levels and reduced rate of heart disease. This makes sense: More unsaturated
fat in the diet is consistently associated with lower LDL and higher HDL
levels in the blood.
163
Chapter 9: Fat and Stroke Risk
Cholesterol’s the likely culprit
A 66-year-old woman was fixing breakfast for
her husband one morning. She sat down with a
cup of coffee as she waited for the eggs to boil.
Her husband heard the crash of her cup drop-
ping to the floor and came into the kitchen to
find his wife dazed, her face contorted unnatu-
rally. She had difficulty speaking, producing
strangled sounds when she tried to talk. He
couldn’t tell if she understood him. She was not
moving her right arm. He called 911 and tried to
get her to lie down, but she was afraid to walk.
In the emergency department, she was diag-
nosed with a white stroke. After a CT scan
showed no bleeding, she was treated with TPA.
An hour later she seemed a little better. The next
morning she could talk and understand her hus-
band, but still had some weakness of the right
hand. Tests were run to determine the cause of
her stroke. She did not have diabetes, high
blood pressure, or atrial fibrillation of the heart.
She did have moderate atherosclerosis of the
carotid artery to the brain. Her LDL cholesterol
was high at 139 and her good HDL cholesterol
was low at 36. Her body mass index was some-
what high at 28. She returned home three days
later. Her doctors prescribed aspirin and the
statin drug Atorvistatin, 10 milligrams per day.
She was also advised to lose weight and was
scheduled for follow-up blood tests and an
office visit two weeks later.

I hesitate to mention the Atkins diet — you know: low-carb and lots of animal
proteins. If you’re on this bandwagon, I recommend that you test your blood
cholesterol levels frequently. I also suggest discussing this with your doctor. I
really don’t know of any good clinical trial data supporting this diet, even
though plenty of people have bought into it. But if periodic blood tests indi-
cate that the diet is increasing your bad LDL cholesterol, I’d say the
increased risk of heart disease and stroke far outweigh the benefit of what-
ever weight loss you’ve experienced.
Monitoring your efforts with blood tests
When you make changes to your diet with the goal of reducing cholesterol, reg-
ular blood tests are an important measure of your success. You wouldn’t diet
to lose weight without getting on the scale at regular intervals, would you?
Keeping Fats in Check with Statin Drugs
As I mentioned earlier, deciding whether you should take statins is a compli-
cated process involving a detailed knowledge of your risk factors and the
levels of the different lipids in your blood. Some doctors may be very 
conservative, and others very eager, to use statins. These drugs have
already saved thousands of lives in the short time they have been available.
But there are serious side effects in some individuals. You don’t want to
take statins if you don’t need to. I can’t write down a simple formula for
you to figure it out on your own because it isn’t simple if done right. See
your doctor. This may be one situation where you want a second opinion
about a medical opinion. The opportunity is there to discuss your plan
with more than one expert.
Despite your best efforts, diet and exercise can only do so much to lower
your cholesterol. If, after three months, you aren’t making headway toward
reducing cholesterol, and your body mass index isn’t coming down, then
don’t delay seeking medical treatment to reduce cholesterol.
The skinny on statins
Drugs called statins can reduce your chances of having a white stroke. More
than 26 clinical trials have tested the effect of different statin drugs. When
taken together, all these trials estimate that statins could reduce your risk of
164
Part III: Preventing Stroke 

stroke by 20 percent. If you’ve had a stroke, the reduction would probably be
greater. There is also some indication, but no scientific proof, that statins
may reduce the number of fatal strokes by approximately 9 percent.
These is also good clinical trial evidence that statins actually lead to a reduc-
tion in the thickness of some atherosclerotic plaques — these drugs seem to
partially reverse atherosclerosis — pretty amazing. Here are some common
statin drugs:
Commercial Name
Generic Name
Lipitor
Atorvastatin
Zocor
Simvastatin
Pravachol
Pravastatin
Lescol
Fluvastatin
Mevacor
Lovastatin
How statins work
Statins stop your liver from making cholesterol. They don’t stop you from
eating cholesterol, though. Diet and taking statins have to work together to
some extent. Don’t assume you can go back to bacon and eggs for breakfast
the day you take your first pill. Continue to avoid trans and saturated fats
while taking a statin drug.
In addition to lowering LDL cholesterol, evidence supports that statins may
reduce inflammation that causes atherosclerosis, though this is still under
study. It also appears that statins may reduce C-reactive protein levels in the
blood of some people with serious heart disease and stroke. C-reactive pro-
tein is a marker of blood-vessel inflammation, and high levels in the blood
predict heart attacks and stroke.
Statins, as with any major drug, stimulate a bit of controversy. Although we
don’t really know about their long-term effects yet, the benefits seen in the
trials are pretty hard to dispute.
Side effects of statins
Nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and muscle ache are some of the more
common side effects of statin drugs. There are two serious side effects, 
however.
165
Chapter 9: Fat and Stroke Risk

Liver damage
This is usually seen by an elevation of substances in the blood that indicate
liver injury. See why it’s important to get your blood tested regularly? Six to
twelve weeks after you start the drug and then every four to six months is
recommended by some. A mild increase in these substances does not neces-
sarily mean you have to stop taking the drug. Yet. It does mean you may have
to lower the dose and check your blood more every couple of weeks for a
while. If a serious liver problem does develop, or the liver tests remain ele-
vated, stopping the statins usually reverses the problem.
If you are going to take statins, then you need to follow your doctor’s instruc-
tions and get blood tests done when recommended. Otherwise, warning of
serious side effects may be missed.
Other drugs that reduce cholesterol can make liver problems worse. One of
these drugs is gemfibrozil (Lopid). In high doses, the B vitamin niacin does a
pretty good job of lowering cholesterol, but beware adding it to statins. I
haven’t read anything to indicate that consuming daily or B-complex vitamins
cause this effect.
Muscle injury
This is less usual than liver damage. It is common for statins to cause a vague
muscle pain. However, if the pain gets worse and the muscles become tender,
the muscle cells can start to die. This places a lot of breakdown products
from the dying muscle into the bloodstream that in turn starts a potentially
deadly problem, leading to kidney failure and death. The problem is wors-
ened by the following drugs: gemfibrozil (Lopid), erythromycin, drugs to kill
fungus infections, and nefazodone (Serzone), an antidepressant.
Do’s and don’ts for taking statins
Here’s a handy list of things to keep in mind about statins:
 Eliminate grapefruit juice from your diet: Grapefruit juice, and only
grapefruit juice, has an unexplained effect on the metabolism of several
drugs, statins included. Don’t drink it: Grapefruit juice will cancel the
effect of the drug.
 Take statin drugs at night: Your liver makes cholesterol at night. For
maximum effect, take statin drugs late in the day.
 Get your blood tested regularly: You need to monitor the results of the
statin drugs. Check blood lipids, liver function, and, if needed, muscle-
breakdown products.
166
Part III: Preventing Stroke 

 Avoid certain medications: If you’re on statins, you should not be taking
certain medications, including drugs that kill fungal infections, the
antibiotic erythromycin, gemfibrazol (Lopid), the antidepressant
Serzone, or high doses of the B vitamin niacin.
 Be alert to certain side effects: If you notice unusual muscle aches and
pains, report these to your physician at once.
Statins beat out most cholesterol-lowering
drugs
There are other drugs used for lowering LDL and raising HDL. High doses of
the B vitamin niacin, for example, can do a remarkable job of lowering choles-
terol levels in your blood. Like statins, niacin can put stress on your liver. But
statins have proven to be the most effective means of keeping cholesterol in
check, and, thus, are most often recommended by physicians.
Among the many risk factors that predict stroke, high cholesterol levels in
the blood is one of the easiest to address. If you’ve determined through
blood tests that your lipid levels are not optimal, your course of action is
fairly clear and easy to follow. By changing your diet to reduce the intake of
high-cholesterol as well as saturated and trans fats and/or taking statin
drugs, chances are your subsequent blood tests will show some improve-
ment. And you can feel pleased that you’ve taken steps to reduce the risk of
atherosclerosis and subsequent stroke in the future.

P
reventing stroke is working. Since 1972, your chances of dying from
stroke have declined by 50 percent. A lot of people have seen the oppor-
tunities that come from making an effort to prevent stroke. The result has
been longer and healthier lives. Since 1970, the treatment of heart disease
and stroke has added an average of 6 years to the length of an average
American’s life. This chapter isn’t an invitation to be a rugged lonely individu-
alist. This chapter is an invitation to join a growing majority of people who
are seeing the opportunities available to them.
There is a reason there are blood pressure machines in almost every phar-
macy in the U.S. They weren’t there in 1970. There is a reason McDonald’s
has made significant efforts to reduce the fat in the food it serves. There is a
reason fewer people are smoking than ever before. The reason is that people
realize that the benefits from taking advantage of the opportunities listed
here are real and worthwhile.
I believe I’m doing better at protecting my health because, by writing this
book, I am reminding myself every day that I don’t want to end up with
dementia or become otherwise disabled by something I could have pre-
vented. I made it to 50. Maybe I can live into my 90s and still remember my
kids’ names. The possibility that I might not make it motivates me to do
everything I can to ensure the health of my brain for the next 40-plus years.
In the previous two chapters, I covered two major stroke risks: high blood
pressure and high cholesterol. I devoted entire chapters to these topics
because treating them effectively — or better yet, preventing them — is so
critical to preventing stroke. The risk factors discussed in this chapter are of

no less concern, however. I offer advice on treating these conditions or avoid-
ing them altogether, steps that will help you reduce your risk of stroke or suf-
fering from further strokes.
This chapter concludes with a worksheet and action plan designed to help
you launch a journey on the road to a stroke-free future. Are you reading this
book because someone you love has had a stroke? The advice here is just as
valuable to you. And it’s pertinent whether you’re 60 . . . or 30.
Prevention is the focus of this chapter. Prevention is something our health-
care system does not invest much in. Our society’s approach to our health is
to wait until something bad happens — and then act. This is a poor way to
deal with stroke and heart disease because by the time something bad hap-
pens, damage to your blood vessels — and brain — has already occurred.
Therefore, I charge you with taking an active role in taking care of yourself.
No one else is going to do it. The opportunities are there, but they are not
going to force themselves into your life.
Reviewing the Major Risks
Many of the risks for stroke are linked together — one condition aggravates or
causes another, like dominoes in your vascular system. High blood pressure
puts more wear and tear on blood vessels and seems to worsen atherosclero-
sis, probably because the plaque formation has something to do with the heal-
ing process that occurs when the lining of an artery is injured. Atherosclerosis
is further aggravated by diabetes. High blood glucose levels seem to lead to
injuries in the blood vessels. Diabetes also injures the heart muscles, resulting
in more sources of clots to break loose and injure the brain.
Accepting what you can’t change
Some risks factors you can’t control. Factors such as family history, age, sex,
and race — and whether you’ve had a previous stroke — are situations you
simply must accept. Your family history, for example. Because of genetics,
lightning does strike twice in the same family. You can’t change the fact that
your parents, grandparents, aunts, and uncles all have or had high choles-
terol and that you’re likely to be predisposed to the same, but you can take
steps to watch your diet and treat your condition with medication.
 Family history: A family history of stroke increases the likelihood of
stroke for an individual. The fact that many of the risk factors for stroke —
hypertension and atherosclerosis, for example — are also hereditary
makes family history an increased concern.
 Age: Your risk of stroke increases with age. At least 70 percent of strokes
occur in people age 65 and older.
170
Part III: Preventing Stroke 

 Gender: Men are more likely to suffer from stroke than women. But
women may increase their likelihood if they smoke and take estrogen or
birth control pills. More women die from stroke than men, but this is
partially related to the longer life span of women and the fact that they
are older (and more likely to die) when they have their first stroke.
 Race: African Americans and Latino Americans have strokes at double
the rate (or more) of whites of the same age and sex. This difference is
not entirely explained by higher incidence of high blood pressure and
diabetes. There is good evidence that the other risk factors are the
same. This means that blacks and Hispanics have even more to gain
from the effort to prevent stroke.
 Previous stroke: If you’ve had one stroke, your chances of experiencing
another (about 5 percent per year — the first year may be higher) are
about ten times higher than if you’ve never had a stroke (about 0.5% per
year, depending on your age).
Zeroing in on what you can change
Other risks are treatable or preventable. Here’s a quick overview of these fac-
tors before I examine them more closely and explore how to eliminate,
reduce, or treat them.
 Hypertension: High blood pressure, the most important factor deter-
mining the likelihood that you will have a stroke, is examined in detail in
Chapter 8.
 High blood lipids and cholesterol: This issue is so complicated, I’ve
devoted an entire chapter (Chapter 9) to blood fat and cholesterol and
how to combat its devastating effect on the blood vessels.
 Heart and vascular disease: The numbers tell the story. Studies support
that individuals who have heart disease are twice as likely to suffer a
stroke as those who don’t. The conditions vary and can often be con-
trolled through medication, as well as diet and lifestyle changes.
 Smoking tobacco: Smoking cigarettes increases your chances of stroke
by a factor of four. Plus it increases your chances of heart attack and
emphysema as well. This condition, however, has one of the most effec-
tive, if not most difficult, treatments: Simply stop doing it! Stopping
smoking for a year returns you to the same stroke risk as a nonsmoker
your own age.
 Diabetes: Unfortunately, diabetes can’t be eliminated, but it can be con-
trolled with medication. The accompanying conditions of high blood
pressure and obesity can also be controlled in order to reduce risk.
 Obesity: Individuals who are obese are more likely to have hyperten-
sion, diabetes, high cholesterol, and heart disease. Control is achieved
through diet and exercise.
171
Chapter 10: Other Risk Factors and Prevention

 Oral contraceptives and estrogen replacement: Both these common
drugs increase the tendency of blood to clot. Hence, the increased risk
of white strokes caused by blood clots. Doctors were surprised when
they learned that birth-control pills, especially when combined with 
cigarette smoking, also increased a woman’s chance of red stroke from
rupture of a subarachnoid hemorrhage.
 Drug and alcohol abuse: Heavy drinking increases your risk of heart
disease and stroke. Light and moderate drinking are associated with a
decreased rate of both stroke and heart disease. These facts have been
known for years, but it hasn’t been confirmed by a clinical trial that
adding light or moderate drinking to a nondrinker’s life will decrease
stroke risk. Experts haven’t really figured this one out. What’s clear is
that if you are already having a glass of wine with your dinner every
night, there is no apparent reason to stop.
Tobacco and Stroke
How bad for you is smoking tobacco? Here’s what the Surgeon General says:
Smoking is the biggest preventable cause of death in the United States. In the U.S.,
roughly 440,000 people die each year from smoking-related illnesses. Treating
the effects of smoking puts a chokehold on our nation’s health costs — we’re
talking in the range of $70 billion per year. And yet each day nearly 4,000 young
people under the age of 18 light up for the first time, according to some esti-
mates.
Smoke and blood
Remember the old song, “Smoke gets in your eyes”? A sad little ballad. But
what’s even sadder is when smoke gets in your blood. In Chapter 1, I spelled
out how smoking can lead to stroke: that thousands of damaging chemicals —
including nicotine and carbon monoxide — travel from your lungs to your
bloodstream and then do their damage throughout your system. These sub-
stances cause blood vessels to constrict (there goes your blood pressure!),
reduce oxygen (forcing the heart to work harder), scrape the inside of the
blood vessels (forming plaques), and make blood “stickier” (leading to more
vessel damage and paving the way for atherosclerosis and clots).
Many large studies have compared smokers and nonsmokers. Those who
smoke consistently have more strokes and die more often from them, consis-
tently have more white strokes and red strokes caused by subarachnoid hem-
orrhage, and consistently have strokes when they are younger. One study of
more than 300,000 people showed that those who smoked were more than
twice as likely to have a stroke.
172
Part III: Preventing Stroke 

And what about all the small strokes no one notices or does anything about?
Vascular dementia is increased in smokers (read more about this in Chapter 7).
And who knows how bad the impact of smoking really is — it’s likely that many
smokers have brain injury that wasn’t severe enough to be noticed or reported
to the doctor.
And here’s an alert to those who live with a smoker: You might as well con-
sider yourself a light smoker. Your risk of having a stroke is about 30 percent
more than a nonsmoker who doesn’t inhale someone else’s smoke.
Treatment plan: Quit today!
The plan of action to reduce stroke risk caused by smoking is: Stop! There are
programs to help you stop smoking. There are approved drugs to help you
get over your dependence on nicotine. If you smoke, then chances are very
good that you’ve tried to stop. The pain of stopping is immediate and the
benefits seem a little vague when you are in withdrawal. You need to find
what is motivating you to smoke and tackle that.
They say most people start because of social pressure and advertising. Well,
it might work the other way, too. Does pressure from other people motivate
you? Do your children lose respect for you? Does smoking make it more diffi-
cult to get along with your spouse? Do you want to find out whether your
kids ever do have any children of their own? Do you want white teeth? Do
you have enough wrinkles? Are you more afraid of lung cancer than having a
stroke? Or are you more practical? Do you want to be sure you don’t burn the
house down? Are you tired of always coughing and your kids always having
runny noses and coughs? Do you want to save money?
There are quite a few approaches to stopping smoking, including structured
programs that offer various tools for quitting, including medication, psycho-
logical support, group support, and behavior-modification techniques. Some
can be expensive — but isn’t your life worth it? The following are a number
of strategies and tactics for your stop-smoking campaign. Use one, a few, or
many — whatever it takes.
 Drugs: Some drugs help reduce the craving for tobacco. The drug that
seems to double the success rate for smoking cessation is called
Bupropion, also known as Zyban or Wellbutron. It is also used as an anti-
depressant. When combined with nicotine patches, it does a little better.
There are significant relapse rates, but some people who have not been
able to quit in any other way have succeeded with these prescription
drugs. Because of the tendency toward depression after stroke, an anti-
depressant isn’t a bad idea. If you have had seizures, then your doctor
may not prescribe antidepressants, as Bupropion and other antidepres-
sants increase the risk of seizures.
173
Chapter 10: Other Risk Factors and Prevention

 Patches and nicotine gum: Nicotine patches and gum help you meet your
craving for nicotine without all the associated habits of smoking. Just the
habit of lighting up after a meal or during stressful times can be hard to
break. Without the additional stress of nicotine craving, you may be more
successful at getting yourself out of the behavioral rut you are in.
 Behavior modification: Whereas some attack their smoking habit by quit-
ting cold-turkey, others sneak up on a smoke-free life one cigarette at a
time by gradually reducing their consumption of cigarettes. One variation
of the gradual slow-down is the increasing difficulty approach. You smoke
fewer, but you concentrate on not buying cigarettes, delaying smoking by
five minutes, then ten minutes, then longer and longer. The craving dimin-
ishes as you learn to control it for longer times. Other tactics in behavior
modification include prohibiting yourself to smoke in certain places —
your house, for example — or at certain times, such as after dinner.
 Substitution: You may succeed by using gum, toothpicks, and activities
that use your hands. Then, of course, there is eating — not a good use of
substitution. Eating instead of smoking is something that doctors hear a
lot about. You can choose to eat or smoke — you can also choose to go
walking and do neither.
 Social-engineering approach: Avoid others who smoke and the places
where smokers congregate. This is getting easier and easier as cities,
states, and nations put more limitations on smoking in public. Telling
others you are stopping will also help you keep your commitment. Others
may help you by not offering you cigarettes or by giving you suggestions
about how to stop. You can really use the community approach by joining
a group of people interested in not smoking.
 Visualization: It works for some. Imagining black ugly lungs, piles of cig-
arette butts, and wrinkled faces motivates the young and beautiful.
The good news for smokers
Tricked you! There is no good news about smoking cigarettes. But there is
good news for smokers committed to quitting. Good evidence supports that
stopping smoking will reduce your risk of stroke, even if you have been smok-
ing for decades or have had one or more strokes. The benefits of breathing
better, not coughing as much, and not getting as many infections are always
immediate and increase your health and well-being.
I haven’t ever smoked or stopped smoking myself, so it’s not easy for me to
understand the challenge for smokers. I do remember a lecture by a heart
surgeon who stopped smoking years before. He said the desire to smoke
never went away. Years after he had stopped, he once got off the elevator on
the wrong floor and followed someone down the hall who was smoking a
Camel cigarette. “It just smelled so good,” he said.
174
Part III: Preventing Stroke 

Quitting cigarettes is hard. Some say it is the hardest thing they’ve ever dealt
with. Most people have to try more than once before they succeed.
Of course, everyone stops smoking eventually.
Every cigarette you don’t smoke is an improvement in your health. High blood
pressure, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and your age are intrinsic parts of you
that you may have been born with. You found cigarettes and brought them into
your life. You can send them away. It isn’t easy, but your lungs, your heart, and
your brain will thank you. Good luck — I hope you succeed.
Heart and Vascular Disease
If you have had heart disease, you are more likely to have a stroke in the
future. If you have had a stroke, you are more likely to have a heart attack in
the future. Once again, we see how interrelated the heart and the brain are to
each other. The reasons and level of risk vary based on the type of heart dis-
ease. Several heart diseases are connected to stroke because heart disease
produces conditions that increase blood clotting, which results in stroke.
Treatment almost always includes some medication to slow blood clotting.
Atrial fibrillation
This is a condition in which the contractions of the upper chambers of the
heart (the atria) are irregular and result in inefficient pumping of blood. This
leads to pooling of the blood in the heart chambers and elsewhere, which
results in blood clots that can cause severe white (ischemic) strokes.
If you have atrial fibrillation, you should be treated for it. Aspirin or warfarin
are the standard treatments, with warfarin usually preferred. The risk of
stroke from atrial fibrillation adds up at about 5 percent per year. You can’t
let this go on very long before you are more likely to have a stroke than you
are to win a coin toss.
Heart attack
If you have a stroke and you have had a heart attack in the past, then it is a
good idea to look at the heart to see if it contains any blood clots that might
break loose and cause further strokes. This can usually be done with ultra-
sound imaging. No invasive procedures are needed in most cases.
175
Chapter 10: Other Risk Factors and Prevention

Having a stroke means you might also have a heart attack. A cardiologist (heart
specialist) or other doctor can look for conditions you should treat to prevent
a heart attack. For example, a stress test might show that one of the arteries to
your heart is almost completely blocked. This might be treated with a stent
to hold the artery open. Drugs that prevent stroke by slowing down clotting
and reducing cholesterol in the blood also help prevent heart attacks.
Heart valve disease
If you have a mechanical (artificial) valve, your risk for stroke is significantly
increased. If you do have a stroke, it is critical to communicate and coordinate
your care between your heart specialist (cardiologist) and your stroke special-
ist. First, because you are undoubtedly on an anticlotting medication — possi-
bly warfarin. But it may be at a different dosage than required for your stroke
condition. Your clotting control will have to be reevaluated after the stroke,
and your medication may need adjustment. Additionally, the valve itself must
be checked.
Treating slow blood clotting
In terms of our concern about heart disease and the link to stroke, our main
course of action is to treat for the prevention of the clotting caused by the
condition. And I’ve already discussed that treatment in several chapters —
the prescription of two types of blood-thinning drugs: antiplatelets and antico-
agulants. Aspirin and drugs like aspirin thin blood by deactivating blood cells
called platelets that stick together and plug leaks in blood vessels. Warfarin is
a common drug often prescribed; its commercial name is Coumadin. Warfarin
stops clotting by depleting your body of a key ingredient needed to make the
glue that sticks a clot together.
In most types of heart disease and after white stroke, transient or permanent,
aspirin or a drug like aspirin is the best choice for preventing blood clot for-
mation. For atrial fibrillation and artificial heart valves, warfarin may be the
best alternative.
Aspirin
Aspirin is the most commonly used drug to prolong the time it takes for a clot
to form. Many physicians prescribe one 325 milligram full-size aspirin per day
to prevent stroke. Others swear by the 81 milligram small-size aspirin.
If a patient can’t tolerate the irritation to the stomach that aspirin often causes,
the doctor may prescribe another antiplatelet drug. One of these drugs is 
clopidogrel (trade name is Plavix). Another is a combination of a low-dose
aspirin and a drug called dypiramidole (Aggrenox). Trials have shown both
of these drugs beating aspirin.
176
Part III: Preventing Stroke 

Warfarin
An aspirin every day is really simple and easy and works in most situations.
Warfarin has been proven better than aspirin when it comes to preventing
blood clots that form in the heart — for patients with atrial fibrillation or
heart valves, for instance. Warfarin, also known as Coumadin, prevents clots
by depriving the body of vitamin K, a substance in green leafy vegetables that
helps blood clot. When prescribing warfarin instead of aspirin, your physi-
cian will take into consideration the risk factors you have for stroke and your
age. If you have had a prior heart attack, high blood pressure, diabetes, or
are age 75 or more, then you have more to gain from taking warfarin.
But warfarin does carry risk. Taking warfarin is a major undertaking. Done
right, it can save your life. Done wrong, it can result in a major — possibly
fatal — red stroke brain hemorrhage. Careful monitoring of the use of war-
farin is critical to its success in reducing risk of white stroke.
Blood clotting
Two much clotting leads to heart attack, stroke, and the lung clot called a pul-
monary embolism. All of these can kill you. But too little clotting can result in
bleeding in the stomach or intestines, in the eye, or around your just-brushed
teeth. If your blood is too thin and doesn’t clot well, you could be at high risk
for brain bleeding — red stroke.
Taking any blood-thinner can lead to easy bruising or bleeding gums. But
taking too much warfarin can cause widespread severe bleeding. It is critical
to monitor the dosage of warfarin carefully in order not to shift the balance
from preventing the risk of white stroke to increasing the risk of red stroke.
The blood test that measures the time it takes for your blood to clot is called
the prothrombin time or protime (PT). PT is the key to fitting your dose of war-
farin to your needs. The results of the PT test are given as a ratio, which can
be thought of as the relative time it takes the blood to clot. The technical
term for the ratio is the International Normalized Ratio (INR). If the INR is
three, then it takes, roughly, three times as long as normal for your blood to
clot. If the INR is 1.5, then bleeding from a cut that normally would stop on its
own in five minutes would take 7 or 8 minutes to stop.
Your doctor will set a target for your INR and adjust your dose of warfarin to
reach and stay at that target amount. Reaching target is difficult because
there is so much variation from person to person. Also, it takes two or three
days for the dose of warfarin to take full effect. This means the INR from a
blood test reflects the response to the warfarin you took two or three days
ago. Fortunately, you don’t have to worry too much about this. Your doctor
has a lot of experience figuring out the best dose. You need to be patient
because it can take a week or two.
177
Chapter 10: Other Risk Factors and Prevention

What you can do to help warfarin do its job
You should be proactive in supporting a positive treatment experience. Here
are some steps you can take to help your doctor achieve the optimal pre-
scription for you:
 Take your medicine the same time every day and eat similar meals to
the extent possible. The best time to take warfarin is before dinner.
 Consider how often and how consistently you eat leafy green vegetables.
They are good for you, but they provide a lot of vitamin K, which counter-
acts the effect of warfarin. Eating a lot of leafy greens one day, then none
for the next few days can make it hard to get consistent INR readings.
 Adhere to your dosage instructions. The usual dose of warfarin is
between 2 and 5 milligrams once per day. Making a commitment to
taking the drug requires diligence on your part. If you forget to take your
meds or the right dosage, then warfarin is not for you. Better to take
aspirin, which doesn’t need to be monitored so carefully.
 Watch for signs of bleeding (check your gums after brushing your teeth)
and bruising.
 Be sure to make your appointments for checking the PT time to keep
your blood from getting “too thin.” If you need a dosage adjustment,
better to make it sooner rather than later.
178
Part III: Preventing Stroke 
Heart failure
When any disease involving the heart becomes
so severe that the organ can’t do its job, the
result is heart failure. There are several causes
of heart failure. One of the most common is a
heart attack, which injures the heart and leaves
it too weak to keep up with all the work it needs
to do. Every time a healthy heart beats, it
squeezes out about 55 percent of the blood in
the largest chamber of the heart (the left ventri-
cle). If you have heart failure, your heart only
manages to get out 40 percent or less. When
this happens, fluid can build up around the
ankles and in the lungs, making it more difficult
for you to walk and to breathe. Other symptoms
you might have are coughing, waking up at
night short of breath, and chronic fatigue.
Causes of heart failure include atrial fibrillation,
pneumonia and other infections, heart attack,
anemia (low red blood cell count), heavy alco-
hol consumption that injures heart muscle, and
poorly treated or untreated high blood pressure.
Heart failure is thought to promote clotting
inside the heart and stroke similar to the way
atrial fibrillation causes clotting and stroke. A lot
of patients with heart failure have atrial fibrilla-
tion. Those who do should be on warfarin, usu-
ally. Other heart failure patients should be on
aspirin or warfarin.
Heart failure leads to increased clotting and an
increased risk for stroke. That risk increases
depending on the level of heart failure. Every
year about 2 percent of the hundreds of thou-
sands of mild heart failure patients have a
stroke. The percentage rises to 4 percent with
severe heart failure.

Controlling Diabetes
In a nutshell, diabetes is a condition in which the body does not produce or
use insulin properly. Diabetes can lead to cataracts in your eyes, decreased
vision because of injuries to the retina, kidney disease, and nerve damage.
And stroke.
Insulin reduces the amount of the sugar called glucose in your blood. Too
much insulin, and your blood glucose drops so low that your brain stops
working and you can lose consciousness and die. Too little insulin and your
blood can be so filled with glucose that it injures cells. In diabetes, either
your pancreas stops making enough insulin or your body stops responding to
insulin. The result is the high levels of the glucose in your blood that are the
hallmark of diabetes.
What does diabetes have to do with stroke? Diabetes makes blood vessels
more prone to injury. It is as if diabetic arteries do not endure the wear and
tear of life as well as nondiabetic arteries. The effects of major risk factors for
stroke — atherosclerosis and high blood pressure — are increased in diabet-
ics. See the domino effect here? A case of multiple-risk factors conspiring to
set you on the path to stroke.
The doctors who treat diabetes have a large number of tools in their medical
bags to find the perfect combination of treatments that work for you. Work
closely with your doctor. The more you know about the different drugs and
the principles of management, the better the two of you will be able to work
to keep your blood glucose under control.
As with many drugs, antidiabetics cause interactions with other drugs.
Simply changing doses may resolve any problems, but it’s critical to commu-
nicate any and all prescriptions to the physician treating your diabetes.
These drugs include aspirin, acetaminophen, ibuprofen, sulfa drugs, some
antibiotics, warfarin and its cousins, a drug called probenecid given for gout,
and beta blockers used to treat blood pressure and many other conditions.
And then there are the vitamins and herbal supplements that you prescribe
for yourself. Put these on your list of medications as well.
Diabetes increases your risk of stroke. The closer you keep your blood glu-
cose to normal levels, the healthier your arteries will be. The more tightly
you control your blood glucose, the more careful you will have to be in man-
aging your diabetes. You will have to convince your doctor that you can pay
attention and follow instructions precisely.
And don’t get so focused on your diabetes that you forget other important
risk factors. When you have diabetes, you have a lot to gain in terms of stroke
prevention by treating high blood pressure and stopping smoking and getting
179
Chapter 10: Other Risk Factors and Prevention

your blood lipids in good shape. Diabetes makes virtually all other risk fac-
tors for stroke worse. Cerebrovascular dementia, in particular, is worse with
diabetes and high blood pressure combined.
Fighting Obesity with Diet and Exercise
America is in the middle of a national obesity epidemic that is threatening
recent progress in combating high blood pressure and atherosclerosis. And
these lead to more heart attacks and strokes as we age.
The principle of weight gain
I can tell you the one basic principle that explains all the extra fat tissue you
have on board. Here it is:
The amount of weight you gain is equal to the difference between the amount
of energy you consume and the amount of energy you expend.
You lose weight by a combination of two strategies: First, you exercise more
to build muscle mass and burn energy from fat reserves. The greater muscle
mass is always burning glucose, even when you are resting. Just like your
brain. Second, you consume less energy. Energy is measured in calories.
Calories come from food. Need I say more?
Changing your eating habits
If you are overweight, it’s likely an effort that took years to achieve. You have
developed eating habits that help you sustain — and perhaps continue to add
to — your extra pounds. I don’t have to tell you about the miracle diets that
pack the shelves in your local bookstore. There are all kinds of quick-fix cures
that promise the pounds will melt away like ice cream in the Sahara. I’m not
going to endorse, promote, or give space to one particular diet over another
in this book.
I am going to urge those of you who need and want to lose weight to consider
it a long-term commitment. Research the topic, give it some soul-searching,
evaluate your lifestyle values, explore various eating plans, talk to your
doctor or a nutritionist — and find an eating plan that you feel you can stick
with and incorporate into your life. Eating is a lifelong activity. And how you
eat is a habit you can change to promote healthy weight.
180
Part III: Preventing Stroke 

I mention diets in Chapter 9. Let me reiterate the importance of monitoring
critical numbers when you are changing your diet. You don’t want to lose
weight at the cost of high cholesterol in your blood, smoking cigarettes, and
raising your blood pressure with diet pills and loads of salt. Measure your
weight, check your blood pressure frequently, and work with your doctor to
get the cholesterol in your blood tested.
Seeing through the advertising hype
Let me offer this advice, too: Turn off the TV and take a walk! In a culture like
America’s, the average person confronts immense forces when he or she
decides to eat less. Billions of dollars are spent to sell you food. These adver-
tisers are smart. They don’t just sell food — they sell love. They offer conve-
nience, warm family gatherings, popularity, cost-savings, even health, beauty,
and romance through food. Who wouldn’t be persuaded to drive to the near-
est chain restaurant after viewing happy, fit, attractive people downing huge
quantities of fat-soaked food — at a special price? Obesity is sold every day
by a huge gamut of corporations who want you to buy their products.
That isn’t to say you and I aren’t part of the problem. It’s a lot easier to sell us
fat, sugar, and salt than carrots, lettuce, and pinto beans. Campaigns to get
folks to stop smoking have been relatively successful. Campaigns to reduce
obesity are beginning to launch right now. We need them. But until they reach
the same saturation as the restaurant and junk food advertisers, you’ll have
to rely on your own discriminating skills to control the advertisers’ power
over your purchases and eating habits.
Exercising as a life-long habit
The other strategy for weight loss is to expend more energy. In a word, exer-
cise. Ugh! I walk to work about twice a year, but I probably think about it
every day . . . at least at this one extra long stoplight. Treadmills and elliptical
exercise machines? Extremely boring for me. I have been able to get some sit-
uated so I could watch a movie on a DVD player. That makes it easier.
You can probably tell that I am not one of those people who practically live in
workout attire. My point in sharing my personal exercise aversions is that for
most of us, exercise is an effort. Our jobs and lives don’t require much physi-
cal exertion, so we have to incorporate such activity into our routines. And
for many of us, it’s not something we look forward to.
My advice, as it was for eating less, is to explore exercise seriously. Read
up, talk to your doctor, meet with a personal trainer. Consider the spectrum
of physical activities — from pilates to power-walking, from handball to
horseback riding — and find something you can incorporate into your rou-
tine as a life-long habit. Something you can enjoy.
181
Chapter 10: Other Risk Factors and Prevention

Exercise doesn’t have to be complicated — you don’t have to buy expensive
machinery, join a pricey fitness center, or take classes to learn a new sport.
Your route to weight loss can be as simple as walking for 45 minutes a day in
your neighborhood. The great benefit of walking is that you can take it any-
where. If you’re traveling, you don’t have to worry about packing extra equip-
ment. If it’s raining, you can find a mall to walk in. And it’s as easy to do alone
as it is in the company of a friend.
Making a Plan for Reducing Stroke Risk
Now that I’ve reviewed the various risks that may result in stroke, I want to
pull everything together into a manageable action plan. I suggest a two-part
strategy for tackling the situation. First, take steps to address medical prob-
lems that offer the greatest threat — with the result that the treatment offers
the greatest benefit:
 Stop smoking.
 Get treatment for high blood pressure.
 Take medication for slowing blood clotting.
 Control your blood cholesterol.
The second part is to act before things get bad. If you wait to treat your
blood pressure until you have a heart attack or a stroke, that’s too late. Blood-
pressure tests and cholesterol screenings are routine parts of exams. Even if
you are a young adult reading this book out of concern for a parent or grand-
parent who has suffered a stroke, you are getting information about your
blood pressure and blood lipid levels that you could put to good use now.
At your last check-up, you may have learned that your blood pressure or
your cholesterol levels were on the high side of normal. Your doctor may
have said something like, “Well, it’s a little high, but we don’t need to con-
sider medication at this point. Just watch out for it.”
I say this is the time to take action! You are already very late in starting to
prevent heart attack and stroke if you hear things like the remark in the pre-
ceding paragraph. You don’t have to let your arteries harden until you have
blood pressure so high it requires medication. Today you eat pizza, chocolate
shakes, and French fries; tomorrow you take blood-pressure pills and spend
hours in doctor’s offices. Work with your doctor now to learn everything you
can to prevent high blood pressure, atherosclerosis, diabetes, and other risk
factors from ever getting out of control. It’s possible. This is an opportunity
for you to do something now that is guaranteed to pay off for you in the
future.
182
Part III: Preventing Stroke 

Collecting the evidence
It’s a great idea to establish a relationship with a physician that allows you to
work together to anticipate health problems and start treating them early. If
you’ve already had a stroke, you may already have a file drawer full of med-
ical information. Certain data is important — whether or not you’ve had a
stroke — in order for you to effectively monitor your condition.
 Blood-pressure tracking: Know your blood pressure and keep track of
your readings. You don’t have to visit the doctor every day to keep tabs
on this critical bit of information. This detective work can be done at a
free machine in a drug store. Or buy your own machine. Best things
about getting your own machine: portable, private, easy to use, and
available for daily use in a convenient place.
Blood pressure is usually measured once a day, yet you live with it 24
hours a day. It is usually higher in the morning and lowest during sleep.
Your blood pressure may not go down as much at night as it should. It
may be wise to track it several times a day for a period of time — your
own machine makes this affordable and practical.
 EKG reading: EKG stands for electrocardiogram. This test indicates irreg-
ular heart rhythm or heart disease. It also tells whether you have had a
(silent) heart attack or if your heart is enlarged due to a failing heart.
 Cholesterol level: This one requires drawing a bit of blood. A lipid panel
will tell you about the different types of cholesterol, and whether yours
is normal or high. A lot of emphasis is placed on LDL and HDL choles-
terol, the bad and the good, respectively. Let your doctor tell you the
best levels for you — right now the recommendations vary considerably
depending on your medical condition. Be sure you know the numbers
and have agreed on a target level to reach with your doctor.
 Diabetes testing: A blood sugar test screens for early diabetes. Don’t
forget to stop eating 12 hours before the morning of the test. This usu-
ally means nothing after dinner the night before and only water in the
morning — without water, you may be dehydrated the morning of your
test. Get instructions from your doctor about which of your morning
pills you should take. This is especially important if you are diabetic.
 Other tests: You may also want to get tests of liver and thyroid function
and indicators of muscle injury to determine possible drug side effects.
 Ultrasound for atherosclerosis: Atherosclerosis of the carotid artery is an
important risk for stroke. The ultrasound tests pose little risk of injury.
You’ll learn whether one or both of the carotid arteries are blocked with
plaque and find out more about your heart. An arteriogram might give
more complete information, but that involves punching holes in you,
which increases risk of stroke and of injury to your blood vessels.
183
Chapter 10: Other Risk Factors and Prevention

If you have a carotid or transcranial ultrasound test, be sure someone
else outside the laboratory evaluates the results. Some labs are pretty
much referral centers for a particular surgeon or group of surgeons. This
is somewhat like taking your car to the dealer to change the oil and
being told you need $500 in repairs. Get a second opinion before you go
ahead with any procedures to fix your arteries.
 Chest X-ray: This test can give more evidence about your heart.
 CT or MRI scan: If you’ve already had a CT or MRI scan of your brain, then
collect the reports so that you have a record of your brain’s condition.
Stroke prevention checklist
Now that you’ve gathered the important information about your health, the
next step is to consolidate it in a way that allows you easy access. Doing this
can help you better monitor your condition and work to prevent future stroke.
A fairly comprehensive checklist is in the next section. I have put it in a format
that allows you to use the form in this book (if you have a really sharp pencil).
Or you can photocopy it and mark on the copy for practice. The following
checklist is the foundation of your “prevention file,” something to which you
will attach a lot of papers that will monitor your efforts. Take it with you to
check-ups to keep track of progress in your stroke prevention status.
Setting your prevention goals
Your stroke prevention checklist may be a work in progress, but it will help
launch your prevention plan immediately. Add a conversation with your
physician to identify what further information is needed and to determine
what the evidence is telling you so far — and you’re ready to begin. Here are
some tips for mapping out a successful plan:
 Write it down: Complex form or a simple list. The point is to commit
your goals to paper, whether it’s a single item or lengthier.
 Establish a timeline: If you list “Lose 30 pounds” as one of your goals,
determine a deadline goal for achieving that goal. Be realistic.
 Break it down into steps: If you jot down “Stop smoking in six weeks”
but stop there, chances are you’ll still be stubbing out cigarettes two
months from now. But if you break it down into manageable steps, it’s
easier. Your breakdown may include steps such as, “Week One: Get a
patch,” “Substitute a walk for a cig break at work immediately,” “Week
Two: Reduce per-day cigarette consumption by half,” and so forth.
 Keep your list close at hand: Tape it to the refrigerator. Post it on your
bulletin board. Reduce it, laminate it, and stick it in the driver’s-license
slot of your wallet. The point is to keep your goals in front of you.

Working toward a stroke-free future
Sometimes, for those at high risk for stroke, the prospects for a healthy
future may seem bleak — especially when considering risks that you have no
control over. If you’ve had a stroke, you can’t rewrite history after all. Your
family history, your age, your gender: These factors you can’t change.
But here’s the good news: Some of the most significant risk factors — high
blood pressure, high cholesterol, and use of tobacco, among others — can be
controlled through effective treatment or change in lifestyle. You can reduce
your risk of stroke by taking proactive steps to prevent or treat the related
risks. But it does take your active involvement and ongoing commitment.

troke is a major emergency, so the first thing to do 
is call 911 and get to the hospital emergency room.
Once there, doctors will scramble to find out which type
of stroke has occurred, because different strokes call for
different treatments. This part is full of advice for the
stroke victim and family members struggling with medical
treatment options. I cover the different tests that are likely
to be done, the drugs and surgeries available, and the
rehabilitation process to help speed recovery.

R
apid recognition of what’s happening and getting treatment as quickly
as possible are the best chances you have for recovery from stroke. The
problem is, sometimes it’s not so easy to tell that you’re having a stroke. For
example, you could be having a stroke if suddenly
 Your arm begins to feel numb, and you have a hard time controlling your
fingers.
 You can’t understand what others are saying to you.
 You have difficulty recalling or saying words.
Even though you may not feel any pain, the situation is very serious, and per-
manent disability is a real possibility. Some treatments that are effective in
reducing disability following a stroke aren’t as effective unless they are given
soon after the onset of stroke. One of the most effective treatments can’t be
started more than three hours after a stroke starts.
Once a stroke starts, part of your brain is dying. You have to get to a doctor
as soon as possible to prevent or limit permanent damage. You are not the
only one who has to rush. Doctors and nurses in the emergency room need
to act quickly to be sure you get the best treatment.
The truth is that many people are frightened or confused by their stroke
symptoms. Waiting to see if the paralysis goes away is a common response.
Many patients don’t make it to an emergency room for several hours. Some
come the next day because they don’t want to make a lot of fuss about what
may be nothing.

Others defer action because they’re worried about the expense of what may
turn out to be an unnecessary hospital visit. Quite a few people take the time
to call a family member or a physician’s office first before calling an emer-
gency number. All of these are natural reactions, but stroke symptoms are
serious and warrant swifter action.
If you suspect that you or your loved one is having a stroke, don’t wait. Get
thee to the emergency room immediately!
In this chapter, I take you through the process of responding to the emer-
gency of acute stroke — and stroke is always an emergency. I’ve broken the
process down into logical steps, from recognizing stroke symptoms to being
a proactive patient in the hospital and afterward.
At the end of the chapter, I present some practical pointers so you don’t feel
as helpless in the hospital system as you might otherwise feel. If your hospi-
tal and community are among the thousands that are prepared to treat stroke
rapidly, so much the better — but you can do things that may be even more
important.
Recognizing Stroke: Sudden 
Loss of Brain Power
The word stroke means a sudden or swift action — a golf stroke, a stroke of
luck, the stroke of a pen. Stroke, the disease, is also sudden — and requires 
a swift response. When you have a stroke, you suffer a sudden loss of part of
your brain function. You’re normal one moment and suddenly very different
only a minute or two later.
Usually there is no pain associated with a stroke. Now, that’s not true 100 
percent of the time. Sharp neck pain or very severe headache may be present
with a few strokes. But specific symptoms indicate that something is sud-
denly and clearly amiss with the brain. The key concepts bound together 
by the word stroke are
 The suddenness of the onset, within minutes.
 The brain as the source of the problem.
 The emphasis on loss of brain function.
Symptoms that say “stroke”
The Brain Attack Coalition, a group of national organizations to treat stroke,
has agreed on the following as the best description of the symptoms of stroke:
190
Part IV: Treating Stroke 

 Sudden numbness or weakness of face, arm, or leg, especially on one
side of the body
 Sudden confusion or trouble speaking or understanding speech
 Sudden trouble seeing in one or both eyes
 Sudden trouble walking, with dizziness, or loss of balance or coordination
 Sudden severe headache with no known cause
Stroke is defined by a loss of brain function. Symptoms such as nervousness,
trembling, and shaking are signs of increased brain activity — they are not
present in stroke.
What if you are incapacitated?
Of course, there’s often a catch-22 with regard to responding swiftly to stroke.
If you are the victim, the very symptoms that signal the stroke may also pre-
vent you from taking action. If you experience loss of feeling or paralysis or
cannot speak or find yourself in a state of confusion, you may not be able to
seek help. You may have to rely on family members, friends, or even
strangers to call for emergency help.
If you’ve suffered from stroke previously or suspect you are a candidate for
stroke, share important information about symptoms and discuss emergency
action plans with those near to you. You may want to share this chapter — or
the entire book, for that matter — with loved ones or friends.
What to do if someone is having a stroke
When someone is having a stroke, you will notice some peculiar behavior
immediately: The mouth may droop on one side of the face, as if the face is
slack on that side. This droop is often accompanied by slurred speech.
Talking becomes a struggle — often the sufferer can only get out a word or
two and then becomes mute.
If you only remember only one thing about stroke, make it this: Pay attention
to language. No one symptom occurs in all strokes, but speech problems are
among the most common telltale signs.
Bystanders may have to ask the person questions to get the full picture of
what’s happening: “Can you lift your arm? Can you make a fist? Do you know
what day it is?” If someone has any problem at all with these tasks, then he or
she may be suffering from stroke.
191
Chapter 11: Get Thee to an Emergency Room

The stroke victim may try to downplay the situation, assure concerned
bystanders that he or she is not in pain, or try to persuade everyone to wait
awhile before calling for help. In that situation, if you are the bystander, keep
calm and collected, but don’t delay. Take charge and take action. You are deal-
ing with a person who has an injured brain. Call 911. It’s the right thing to do
even if it is embarrassing, expensive, or turns out to have been unnecessary.
Here are the responsibilities of the stroke bystander:
 Know the signs of stroke and recognize them quickly.
 Call 911 or a similar emergency system.
 Note and remember the exact time when the stroke started.
 Go to the emergency room with the stroke victim or get someone else to
go who knows the patient and knows what happened. It’s as helpful to
ER personnel to be able to talk to someone who saw the stroke happen
as it is to talk to a family member.
192
Part IV: Treating Stroke 
All strokes are not the same
A stroke usually does not affect the entire brain;
typically, about 5 to 30 percent is affected. And
different strokes can affect different areas. This
means that one stroke doesn’t always look like
another, and different symptoms can appear in
different combinations for each stroke. The brain
is organized in such a way that different capabil-
ities are located in separate places. For example,
movement of the right arm is controlled from an
area of the brain just beneath the skull above the
left ear — likewise, the left arm is controlled from
a similar spot above the right ear.
Because stroke affects any one of hundreds of
blood vessels that supply blood with oxygen and
glucose to all the different parts of the brain, the
symptoms of a stroke can vary depending on
which blood vessels are affected.
Consider 600 stroke patients whose stroke was
caused by a blood clot blocking a brain artery.
They were seen right after the onset of their
stroke, and a systematic examination was done.
81 percent had difficulty speaking clearly.
68 percent lost feeling on one side.
65 percent had weakness of the face, arm, or
leg on one side.
58 percent had decreased vision on one side.
58 percent had trouble paying attention to one
side of their body.
52 percent had trouble using language.
52 percent had difficulty looking to the right or
left.
31 percent were drowsy or lacked alertness.
7 percent had difficulty with balance.
There are two lessons from this list that I would
like to emphasize: (1) Pay attention to language.
(2) There is no symptom of stroke that occurs in
all strokes.

Timing is everything
Bystanders or family members can be critically important in determining the
timing of the stroke. If you were not with the victim at the stroke’s onset,
remember when you first noticed the symptoms. If the person who had the
stroke can’t say when it started, try to find someone who can verify the last
time that he or she was normal.
As with heart attacks, most strokes start in the morning or early afternoon. If
a family member appears to have a stroke soon after waking up, the stroke
may have occurred during sleep. It can make the difference between getting
treated or not if you can show that someone was normal, if only for a few
minutes, after waking up. For example, consider an individual who gets up
and goes to the bathroom at 6 a.m., returns to bed, and is found paralyzed in
the right leg at 7 a.m. If you know that the individual went to the bathroom,
then you know that the earliest the stroke could have occurred was 6 a.m. 
If you don’t know or don’t remember that the patient was okay at 6 a.m., 
then you might think that the stroke started the night before — the last 
time that you saw the person being normal. For treating white stroke, to 
be safe, the doctor has to assume a stroke started that last time the patient
was known to be normal.
If you are present when a person has a stroke, or soon after, look at a clock.
To be given treatment in the emergency room, it may be necessary to know
when the stroke started. Ask the individual what he was doing when the
stroke started. “What show was on television? Did you wake up with the
stroke? When was the last time you felt normal?” If he or she can’t talk, ask
for a nod yes or no. The individual may be more willing to answer questions
from you than from unknown medical personnel.
Getting to the Hospital: The 
EMT Scoop and Run
Time flies when the brain is starving for glucose and oxygen (see Chapter 2).
If the heart stops, the brain can’t last more than five or ten minutes before
extensive injury destroys most of its functions. That’s why Cardio Pulmonary
Rescue (CPR) mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and chest compression are per-
formed when the heart stops.
With stroke, the heart is not affected and continues beating. Partial blood
flow continues, and the brain can survive longer — but every minute still
counts. That’s why it’s critical to call 911 immediately as soon as you suspect
a stroke is occurring.
193
Chapter 11: Get Thee to an Emergency Room

Some delay is inevitable in getting help for stroke. You may take a few min-
utes to recognize a stroke before taking action. The 911 call can take two to
five minutes to report critical information, including symptoms and a call-
back number. The arrival of Emergency Medical Technicians (EMTs) on the
scene varies with distance. So, even in the best circumstances, the patient
may not be in the care of medical personnel for 15 minutes or longer after 
the stroke is recognized.
With this time loss in mind, many EMTs employ a scoop and run approach
toward stroke emergencies, with the goal of spending minimal time at the
scene and getting crucial care as quickly as possible. In the ideal situation,
the EMTs at the scene conduct a brief neurological examination (checking
out the basics of how the brain and the nerves that control movement are
working). They ask questions, take blood pressure, and count the pulse 
rate. They may start oxygen, measure serum glucose (sugar content of your
blood), or perform a more detailed assessment of brain function. Then they
get the patient on a stretcher and into an ambulance. Minimal time on the
scene can be as little as 10 minutes, but 20 minutes is more realistic, even
with the most efficient emergency medical system (EMS) people who are
trained to respond to stroke.
194
Part IV: Treating Stroke 
A typical stroke scenario
A 76-year-old woman calls 911 and says,
“Something is wrong.” As she continues to talk,
the dispatcher can clearly hear the words she
speaks, but they are disorganized and make
little sense. He suspects stroke and dispatches
an ambulance to the woman’s home. On arrival,
the EMTs find that her doors are locked. A
supervisor approves breaking a window, and
the woman is found on the floor of her living
room by the telephone. The television is on.
She speaks to the EMTs, but her words don’t
make sense. She is bright and cheerful, but when
asked if she can stand up, she shakes her head
no. The EMTs notice that her right arm seems
weak. When asked when the stroke started, she
keeps repeating that she was watching a partic-
ular television show. “I thought . . . maybe
strange . . . strike . . . stroke, yes, stroke, maybe
stroke,” she manages to say. Apparently she had
crawled from her chair to the telephone to call
911. She is taken without delay to an emergency
department.
She arrives 45 minutes after the onset of her
stroke. Nearly 25 minutes later, after blood tests,
evaluation by a team of stroke experts, and a CT
scan of her brain that shows her stroke was prob-
ably caused by a blood clot, she is given the drug
TPA, a drug used to dissolve the clot that caused
the stroke. If her arrival at the emergency depart-
ment had been delayed, she would not have had
the opportunity of being treated with TPA.
Several hours later, she has improved somewhat,
but still has difficulty understanding language and
speaking. Four days later, she is discharged to 
a rehabilitation center, walking with a limp and
still having difficulty with communication. (See
Chapter 13 for more about rehabilitation.)

Unnecessary time may be spent filling out forms and preparing the patient
for travel unless some routine procedures are skipped. Special stroke proto-
cols (rules of procedure) allow EMTs to spend minimal time at the scene and
encourage them to get the patient in the ambulance and moving toward the
hospital as soon as possible. In addition, the EMTs may communicate with an
emergency physician or a hospital stroke team member while on the way to
the hospital. This communication helps the hospital prepare for the rush of
activity needed to evaluate stroke in the ER.
Deciding on a Hospital
As the EMTs close the ambulance door, the next critical decision is where to
go — the nearest hospital? Or a hospital offering special services for stroke
patients, even if it’s farther away? Does the ambulance driver have standard
instructions regarding where to take stroke patients? What are the criteria for
a good stroke care center?
Of course, you don’t want to be asking these questions while racing the clock.
That’s why the more you can arm yourself with information about your com-
munity’s stroke resources ahead of time, the better off you’ll be in a stroke
emergency.
195
Chapter 11: Get Thee to an Emergency Room
Determining stroke severity by number
Doctors, nurses, and EMTs use a simple scale,
the National Institute of Health Stroke Scale
(NIHSS), to measure how severe a stroke is. It is
not foolproof, but it’s accurate for most cases
and helps medical personnel plan hospital care,
and it provides a good predictor of how well the
patient will recover. Shorter versions are avail-
able for EMTs if they need it to save time.
If you have had a stroke, you may overhear hos-
pital staff talking about your condition in terms
of numbers: “The NIHSS was 16 at the time of
admission, but it improved to 5 overnight.” This
scale starts at 0 for someone who is normal, and
ends at 42 for a person with the worst possible
stroke. A score from 1 to 9 is a mild stroke; from
10 to 19 indicates a moderate stroke; and 20 or
above is a severe stroke (scores above 25 are
unusual).
The NIHSS measures 15 different factors, ranging
from whether you are awake and alert to whether
you have good strength in your hands. For
instance, if you can’t say what month it is, or your
age, then that costs you a point for each missed
question. If you are drowsy and keep drifting off to
sleep, that adds a point or two. (You won’t be the
first one to look in the mirror one morning and real-
ize that your NIHSS might already be 1 or 2.) If your
face droops on one side and has reduced move-
ment, a point or two will be added depending on
how weak the face muscles are.
The big points come from paralysis of the arms
and legs. If your leg falls to the bed after being
lifted by the tester, then that adds 3 points — 4
if you can’t move the limb at all. Lesser degrees
of weakness are more common. Speech prob-
lems can add up to 3 points. You get the idea.

A book cannot address this issue definitively because every response is influ-
enced by local resources, geography, and politics. For example, the EMS ser-
vices in your community may follow certain procedures in terms of which
hospital they deliver stroke victims to. Your town may have a hospital that 
is well known for its stroke care. But following are some considerations for
selecting a hospital.
Several national groups have started to establish guidelines (not standards,
which are established locally) for determining which hospitals are qualified
to claim status as a primary stroke center. Primary in this case means “the first
place to go.” Each hospital can read the published guidelines and decide
whether it wants to do what is necessary to meet the guideline criteria. Not
every community has such a center, and some have several.
Guideline requirements for primary stroke centers have been kept as simple
as possible in order to maximize the number of qualified stroke centers. To
deliver the best possible care, the first hospital you are taken to should be
able to rapidly evaluate and treat stroke within 60 minutes of your arrival at
the emergency room door.
The most widely known stroke guidelines are those published by the Brain
Attack Coalition. Its guidelines make suggestions regarding resources and
organization of a primary stroke center. To be a stroke center, a hospital 
must have
 Good EMS services that can communicate with the hospital when a
stroke patient is en route
 An emergency department
 Laboratory testing capabilities
 A CT scan
The good news is that these resources are generally available in at least one
area hospital.
Unfortunately, you don’t have time to start comparing hospitals after your
stroke symptoms start. Before your next stroke, you may want to call around
and check at various hospitals in your community to determine which has 
a capable stroke center. Remember, time is important. A competent center
ten minutes from your house may do you more good that a nationally known
center two hours away. If you have time, you should also look for other 
criteria, which may be less common. A good stroke center should also
 Have a special stroke response team, adding specially trained personnel
to the resources already available for stroke patients in the emergency
department.
196
Part IV: Treating Stroke 

 Require administrative and financial backing of the institution. Call the
hospital administrator’s office and ask how the hospital supports its
stroke team.
 Support its stroke personnel with ongoing training.
In addition to these factors, ongoing monitoring of quality is important for a
good stroke center. For example, hospital administrators might monitor to
ensure an acceptable response time from admission to treatment; 60 minutes
is considered a widely attainable goal, but most centers with an experienced
stroke team aspire to a quicker response. However, with changes in person-
nel and the passage of months and years, the average time to treatment may
slow down rather than speed up. Periodic quality control reviews help sus-
tain high levels of stroke care performance.
Advocating for the Stroke 
Patient in the ER
If you’ve ever taken a child or family member to the emergency room, then
you’ve probably experienced a long wait, with the few minutes you actually
spend with medical personnel spread out over several hours. The roughly
4,000 emergency rooms in the United States are increasingly crowded —
emergency physicians can afford to spend only a small amount of time with
each patient. For major emergencies — such as major trauma, heart attack,
and stroke — other physicians are needed to back up the emergency 
physician.
Stroke is a major emergency. It’s the brain! Because the stroke patient may 
not be in a position to speak up, it may be up to the family member or friend
to make sure the individual is given the attention he or she needs.
If you are accompanying a stroke victim in the ER, don’t be shy. He or she
needs you to serve as advocate. Don’t leave the person unattended while 
you fill out forms or explain insurance. Your first duty is to be sure the 
stroke patient is in the hands of someone who understands the severity 
of the situation.
If you are confident that the stroke started less than three hours before, your
role is even more critical. Your responsibilities are to
 Report accurately what happened.
 Describe the patient’s previous condition and any medications being
taken.
197
Chapter 11: Get Thee to an Emergency Room

 Determine whether the hospital has a stroke team and whether that
team has been activated.
 Ask if personnel can treat the stroke with drugs to dissolve a blood clot.
If the hospital personnel will not treat the patient with drugs, the facility may
not have the stroke expertise or the CT scan to determine whether rapid
treatment is needed for the patient. Or there may be other reasons. In any
case, you, as the patient’s advocate, might suggest that the patient be trans-
ferred elsewhere.
The bottom line is that the person you are with is likely to be better off if a
team of stroke physicians or an expert in stroke has been contacted and is
managing the care.
If you’re with a stroke patient in the hospital ER for more than five minutes
without attention, something is wrong. If it has been less than two hours
since the stroke started, then something is really wrong. Ask someone to see
the patient and determine what kind of stroke the patient has and whether
there is any treatment. Ask if the patient can receive the clot-busting drug
(TPA), and, if not, why not. Two hours is important because TPA can’t be
started more than three hours after the stroke started, and it may take up 
to an hour to get the patient evaluated before starting treatment.
Understanding ER Stroke Strategy
For the stroke victim, the race against time continues in the emergency
department. The next hour is called the “golden hour” because during that
time the opportunity is greatest to prevent or limit permanent damage. Don’t
expect the doctors to stop and spend 20 minutes talking to the family. This is
not the time. Brain is dying and the stroke response team must focus every
minute on determining the cause of the stroke to treat as quickly as possible.
This is the challenge for the doctors: No treatment can save brain that is
already permanently damaged — and after three hours of stroke onset, 
most of the damage is done. This is why it is critical to begin treatment 
immediately.
But there are four major types of stroke, and each type must be treated
accordingly. In some cases, the wrong treatment could be fatal.
Therefore, the strategy for treating the stroke patient in the ER is this:
1. The doctors must quickly have some tests done to help decide what type
of stroke the patient is suffering from.
2. They must treat the patient appropriately according to the type of
stroke to keep the stroke from causing further irreparable damage.
198
Part IV: Treating Stroke 

Name that stroke
The doctors’ observations and test results indicate which of the four main
types of stroke the patient is experiencing. Detailed information is in
Chapters 3 through 7, but the following is a brief recap:
 Acute ischemic stroke. Also known as cerebrovascular accident or CVA.
This type of stroke is one of two types of white stroke caused by a blood
clot plugging one of the brain arteries. Part of the brain isn’t getting
enough blood and, in time, it could be permanently injured. Nearly 
80 percent of all strokes are this type.
 Transient ischemic stroke. Also known as a transient ischemic attack
or TIA. This is another type of white stroke, also caused by a blood 
clot. But in this case the clot dissolves and the symptoms clear up a 
few minutes after they start. Although danger isn’t as immediate, tran-
sient ischemic strokes are often followed by the permanent type —
sometimes within hours, other times within a day or two.
 Intracerebral hemorrhage. Also known as ICH. This type of red stroke
involves bleeding into the brain from a broken artery. This is the second
most common type of stroke.
 Subarachnoid hemorrhage. Also known as SAH. This type is also known
as a red stroke, but unlike the ICH, the bleeding is around the brain
instead of in the brain. SAH is caused when a weak spot — also called an
aneurysm — in the large blood vessel outside the brain begins escaping
at high pressure.
Performing basic tests
Some clues help doctors determine which kind of stroke the patient is experi-
encing. For example, a severe headache with stiff neck is evidence of a sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage. If all the symptoms have cleared up, then the doctors
may conclude that the patient suffered from a transient ischemic attack. The
team will run several tests, however, to confirm the type of stroke and to
determine the best course of treatment.
Here are the basic tests and procedures that emergency department doctors
perform for all strokes:
 Measure blood pressure, breathing rate, and temperature.
 Start an intravenous (IV) line for giving fluids and drugs into a vein.
 Draw blood for tests. This will help determine whether the patient has
any conditions that would preclude certain treatments.
199
Chapter 11: Get Thee to an Emergency Room

 Perform an electrocardiogram (EKG) to determine if the heart is okay.
This test can quickly detect many common heart problems, which might
have caused the stroke.
 Perform a CT scan to detect bleeding in or around the outside of the
brain. A CT scan can determine whether the stroke is red or white. CT
scans are computer-controlled X-rays that allow you to see the brain
within the skull. For reasons only a radiologist could explain, a CT scan
is also called a cat scan in the ER. It has nothing to do with cats and
everything to do with making a rapid decision about whether bleeding 
is the cause of stroke.
It isn’t always clear whether a stroke has occurred until other tests are done.
Sometimes an MRI scan is helpful in determining what is causing the stroke
symptoms.
In the case that a patient has complained of a severe headache with stiff 
neck — but the CT scan does not show any bleeding to support evidence 
of a subarachnoid hemorrhage — the doctors may decide to perform another
test called a lumbar puncture, or spinal tap. The doctors concern here is not
to mistake a small warning bleed for a migraine headache. If the spinal tap is
negative, then there is much less likelihood of a brain aneurysm. The patient
can be sent home with a possible migraine. Although this is not a common
situation — less than 1 percent of stroke cases — it’s important to make sure
this is not a small bleed from an aneurysm that warns of an impending major
rupture and subarachnoid hemorrhage (see Chapter 6 for more details).
Table 11-1 summarizes the tests done for stroke patients in the ER.
Table 11-1
Tests Done for Stroke Patients in the ER
All Patients

Spinal tap (lumbar puncture) if subarachnoid hemorrhage is suspected but not
found on CT scan
MRI if CT scan does not clearly show cause of stroke

Part IV: Treating Stroke 

Treating White Strokes
Remember, there are two types of white strokes (the blood-clotting kind): the
acute ischemic stroke and the transient ischemic stroke. With the first kind,
the doctors want to re-open the plugged vessel by dissolving the blood clot
and restoring blood flow quickly before the brain is permanently injured.
The treatment that does that job is tissue plasminogen activator, better known
as TPA — the only FDA-approved treatment for white strokes.
But . . . there are some buts regarding the use of TPA. If you find yourself diag-
nosed with a white stroke and you are not given TPA as a course of treatment
in the ER, it could be because of one or more of these reasons:
 There are risks associated with TPA: It can cause serious, even fatal,
brain bleeding (turning a white stroke into a red stroke) in about 6 per-
cent of patients who receive it — most often people older than 75 who
suffer a severe stroke.
 Three or more hours have passed since the onset of the stroke:
Because the damage to the brain has already been done, the risks 
of TPA use may outweigh any potential benefit.
 Your medical history or condition puts you at higher risk: For exam-
ple, you may have had surgery in the past two weeks. Or your blood
may not clot normally.
 The hospital can’t do it: Your particular hospital may not have a spe-
cially trained stroke response team or be equipped to administer TPA
and monitor it carefully.
201
Chapter 11: Get Thee to an Emergency Room
This is a spinal tap
Although it sounds scary and has a bad reputation
(not helped by its namesake faux rock band or
their mockumentary), a spinal tap is a very safe —
and relatively painless — procedure (occasion-
ally a spinal tap will give you a headache, but usu-
ally not). A needle is placed in the middle of the
back just above the hips. The same cerebrospinal
fluid (CSF) that circulates around the brain also
goes down through the spine surrounding the
spinal cord and nerves. The fluid is normally as
clear as water. A tablespoon or two of this fluid is
removed through the needle and tested for the
presence of any blood. If a subarachnoid hemor-
rhage has occurred, the fluid is pink or red with
blood. Sometimes the blood can be pink due to
inadvertent bleeding caused by the needle punc-
ture, but there are tests to determine if the blood
is fresh or several hours old.

So, not everybody can take TPA. The following are some of the characteris-
tics of patients who can benefit from TPA:
 The stroke causes significant disability and is not considered a minor
stroke.
 The stroke is not rapidly improving.
 The symptoms of stroke should not be suggestive of bleeding from a
ruptured aneurysm (SAH stroke).
 The stroke onset is less than three hours before beginning treatment.
 No major head injury or prior stroke in previous three months.
 No heart attack in previous three months.
 No bleeding from the stomach, bowels, kidneys, or bladder in the previ-
ous 21 days.
 No major surgery in previous 14 days.
 No history of previous intracranial hemorrhage.
 Blood pressure not elevated (systolic should be less than 185, diastolic
less than 110).
 No evidence of active bleeding or recent injury causing a fracture.
 The blood should clot normally.
 Blood glucose concentration must not be excessively elevated.
TPA can be dangerous and requires fairly intense patient monitoring after it 
is given. Not all hospitals are equipped to do this. It is not unusual for physi-
cians at one hospital to call a nearby major stroke center to seek advice or 
to transfer a patient there.
In the U.S., only about one-tenth of the patients who get to the ER in time 
to receive TPA actually do receive it. If TPA can’t be given, doctors can take
other measures to ensure the best possible outcome for a patient. Stroke
patients tend to be older and, therefore, have other medical conditions such
as diabetes and high blood pressure. Careful treatment of conditions such 
as these immediately after a stroke can improve the recovery from stroke.
Now, the second type of white stroke — transient ischemic stroke (also
known as transient ischemic attack or TIA) — is a stroke of a different color,
although it is also caused by a blood clot. TPA is not an appropriate treat-
ment for TIA because the symptoms clear up so quickly, and the immediate
brain risk is not as great.
202
Part IV: Treating Stroke 

A drug to reduce the chances of further blood clot formation may be started
right away. This may be something as simple as a tablet of aspirin. Even
though the patient has returned to normal, it’s important to see what caused
the blood clot. This can be determined during a stay in the hospital, or in
some cases, as an outpatient.
If your stroke symptoms go away after a few minutes, you have likely suffered
a TIA, which poses no immediate danger. You can feel lucky — but the danger
is not gone. In fact, you can consider your TIA a valuable early warning sign.
Get to the doctor — even to the emergency room, if necessary — for immedi-
ate evaluation. Many patients with transient stroke are back with a perma-
nent stroke within hours or days. You should be tested as soon as possible.
Surgical procedures and medical treatments are available that can reduce the
risk of further stroke (see Chapter 4).
Treating Red Strokes
With a red stroke (see Chapters 5 and 6), patients are either admitted to an
intensive care unit (ICU) or a special stroke unit for care. They usually leave
the ER as soon as a hospital bed can be found for them.
Remember, the red stroke known as intracerebral hemorrhage — or ICH — 
is caused by bleeding within the brain. ICH is a very deadly form of stroke.
Severe brain bleeding stops the patient from breathing and requires that
tough decisions be made. The patient may need to be put on a ventilator to
breathe in the ER. If the patient needs a ventilator, the chances of survival are
very slim. At that point, the presence of someone who knows the patient’s
wishes about taking extreme measures to prolong life can be very important.
The goal of treatment is to stop the bleeding as soon as possible.
Unfortunately, very little can be done other than lowering excessively high
blood pressure, which has to be performed very carefully. Actions can be
taken to help reduce brain swelling if that is a problem. A neurosurgeon may
be called to evaluate the patient. Sometimes the blood inside the brain can
be removed, and the patient does well, but the general rule is that surgery
doesn’t make that much difference. You have to trust the surgeon’s judgment
on this tough decision.
The other type of red stroke — subarachnoid hemorrhage or SAH — is
brought on by bleeding outside the brain. Fifty percent of patients with this
type of stroke don’t even live to get to the hospital. For those who survive,
the treatment — surgery to patch the aneurysm and stop the bleeding — is
not started until the patient is in a hospital bed, often in a special ICU. Not all
hospitals have neurosurgeons who can treat SAH strokes. In that case, the
patient is usually transferred to another hospital, either from the ER or the
next day from the hospital.
203
Chapter 11: Get Thee to an Emergency Room

One major concern with SAH is that the bleeding will start again. A second
hemorrhage is often fatal. Surgeons or radiologists can repair the weak spot
where the vessel ruptured. Usually, the sooner this is done the better, often
within the first day or two, and there are some drugs that prevent the blood
around the brain from causing further injury. These drugs are usually started
during the first day in the hospital rather than in the ER (see Chapter 5).

Part IV: Treating Stroke 
What you should know about your 
community’s stroke center
If you suddenly find that one side of your body is
paralyzed, it is clearly too late to research your
community’s emergency response. If you find
yourself unable to find words or communicate,
it is not the time to be asking around about the
best hospital for stroke care. But if you’re read-
ing this book, you no doubt have concerns
about the likelihood that you or someone close
to you may experience stroke.
In that case, the news is good. You have time to
learn more about the services your community
offers for stroke victims. Now is the time to call
your Emergency Medical Service (EMS) —
using the non-emergency line — and ask about
how they respond to stroke. Call your favorite
hospital to see if it is a designated stroke center.
Here are some questions you should ask:
 Do EMS personnel receive special training
to respond to stroke?
 Do they follow special EMS stroke protocols?
 Do EMS personnel communicate with the
destination hospital when a stroke patient
is on the way?
 Are hospitals that do not have stroke
response teams bypassed?
 Are any hospitals in the area designated as
primary stroke centers?
 Is there a designated stroke team at the
hospital of your choice? If so, who are they
and how often do they meet to evaluate
their performance?
 Does the emergency department have spe-
cial protocols for stroke?
 Does the hospital have a stroke unit with
specially trained nurses?
 Does the hospital meet or intend to meet
standards being set by Joint Commission on
Accreditation of Healthcare Organizations?
If you want to bore down into the details, I 
suggest looking at the Web site of the Joint
Commission on Accreditation of Healthcare
Organizations. It describes primary stroke center
standards and lists certified hospitals. Like many
Web sites, the JCAHO site is not that well orga-
nized. I suggest going right to the Search option
at the top of the page and searching for stroke.
The page that describes the “Primary Stroke
Center” program takes you to a list of Disease-
Specific Certified Organizations.

There are several diseases that can cause symptoms that look like stroke and
feel like stroke but are not stroke. Some migraine headaches have fooled doc-
tors and patients alike. Likewise, diabetes and occasionally epileptic seizures
have been confused with stroke. Sometimes during an illness like pneumonia
or a bladder infection, the brain decompensates. The symptoms of an old
stroke may return even if there is no new brain injury. It’s as if the stress of
the new problem causes the brain to forget what it learned to compensate for
the disabilities of the old stroke. There are tests that can usually detect one
of these other causes of stroke symptoms that are not really strokes:
 If the patient has other illnesses or has had one or more prior strokes,
the situation may be unclear in the ER. About 30 percent of patients who
come to the ER with stroke symptoms are found to have an old prior
stroke. This can make it difficult to figure out what is going on.
 If the stroke symptoms are thought to be caused by an imbalance in
blood chemicals such as blood sugar, then these imbalances can be 
corrected.
 If another cause is suspected, such as a migraine headache that can
cause paralysis, then the migraine can be treated in the ER.
 If the symptoms continue to cause paralysis or another, new disability,
then the patient is usually admitted for observation and further testing.

Treating Stroke in the Hospital
In This Chapter
 Warding off further strokes
 Exploring the cause of your stroke
 Addressing brain problems
 Avoiding blood clots to the legs
 Confronting other problems in the hospital
 Getting ready for your discharge
You’ve heard the expression, “We’re not out of the woods yet.” When you
find yourself in a hospital bed after stroke, this familiar saying couldn’t
be more apt. You made it through the initial stroke trauma, surviving the trip
to the emergency room. The immediate threat to your life may have been
contained and your condition stabilized. But whether you suffered a white
(ischemic) stroke, intracerebral stroke, or subarachnoid hemorrhage, you’re
not out of the woods yet. One-fifth of all stroke patients do not survive their
initial hospitalization. Although death may not occur in the first hour or day
after stroke, brain swelling and other threats often kill patients within a few
days of their stroke onset.
The news isn’t all grim, however. Modern hospitals offer wonderful resources
for stroke victims. In hospitals of 20 and 30 years ago, you might have stayed
for weeks after stroke. Today, treatments are intense and expensive — and
more effective than in the past. You are out of the hospital usually in days
instead of weeks. Good evidence indicates that the result is better survival
from stroke and fewer second strokes.
This rapid and intense approach may present challenges to the patient and
family, who need time to adjust and to gather critical information before they
must return home to confront life after stroke on their own. In the few days
available, it is important to learn everything possible so you can take care of
yourself when you get home. You must absorb a tremendous amount of infor-
mation and prepare for profound changes.

208
Part IV: Treating Stroke 
While you were in the emergency room, the overall goal was ensuring your
survival from stroke. In that process, emergency physicians attempted to
determine what type of stroke you had so they could begin treatment as 
soon as possible and stabilize your condition. Now you’re ready for the next
phase — your hospital stay.
Because many of the medical problems are the same for each type of stroke,
this chapter is written for all types of strokes. After the emergency room,
most of the problems encountered in the hospital are those shared by all
injured brains. A range of challenges might develop during the first few days
after a stroke — some directly connected to the injured brain (brain swelling,
for example), and others leading to a related outcome such as swallowing dif-
ficulties or blood clots in the leg. In the hospital, however, you are under the
care of experts who have the diagnostic and treatment resources to deal with
these issues and do their very best to see you out of the woods.
Preventing Further Strokes
Having had one stroke, you are vulnerable to more. The goal of your doctors
becomes preventing another stroke from causing more brain injury while you
are in the hospital.
By the time you reach your hospital bed, your doctors will probably know
what type of stroke you had. However, further testing is needed to gain more
information about exactly what caused the stroke, how it should be treated,
and what can be done to prevent future strokes. Depending on what the tests
show, you may need surgery or drugs to keep you safe from another stroke.
Testing to determine the cause of stroke
In the emergency room, the physicians test to find out what sort of stroke —
white, subarachnoid, or intracerebral — you had so they can take steps to
stop the damage and protect your brain. After that, your doctors test to
better understand what caused the stroke — whatever the type — in the first
place. Several tests help determine the cause of stroke.
Finding narrowed arteries with carotid ultrasound
If you were diagnosed with a white (ischemic) stroke, your doctors may give
you a carotid ultrasound to determine whether you have narrowing of either
carotid artery. In this test, sound waves are bounced off the moving blood in
the carotid artery to see if the artery has any obstruction. This involves cov-
ering your neck with a wet jelly and sliding a wand over the area.

The results are usually given as a percentage of blockage in the artery.
Although standard measurements have been established, they vary and 
hospitals don’t seem to consistently follow the same ones. You would be 
surprised at how much the readings can vary from one hospital to another.
Overall, though, you can count on the test to identify blockage and tell you
roughly how serious it might be.
The more obstructed your carotid artery, the more you stand to benefit 
from surgery to remove the atherosclerosis blocking your artery. (Read more
about atherosclerosis in Chapter 9.) If you’ve had a white stroke and have
more than 70-percent obstruction on the same side as the injured brain (the
opposite side of the weak face, arm, or leg), strong clinical-trial evidence 
suggests that you have much to gain from surgery.
This all depends on whether the surgeon has a good track record for per-
forming this surgery without complication. Often, any surgery on the carotid
artery is delayed until you’ve substantially recovered from your stroke. But
with a transient or mild stroke, surgery may be done right away.
Looking for atherosclerosis with a cerebral angiogram
Some surgeons prefer an angiogram (or arteriogram) before proceeding with
carotid endarterectomy. This procedure is uncomfortable and carries a small
risk of causing another stroke. A long, thin, plastic tube is inserted into a
large artery in your groin area and pushed upstream to the mouth of the
carotid artery in your chest where it branches off to head into your neck and
on to the brain. At that point the tube is manipulated into the carotid artery
and dye is injected under pressure while a series of X-rays is taken. You are
typically awake for this procedure, but sedated to reduce your anxiety. Some
people say the dye going into the brain is very uncomfortable.
A brain angiogram is not needed for every patient. They are most commonly
done in patients who have SAH to look for an aneurysm. They are also done
in patients with white stroke if ultrasound or magnetic resonance tests (MR
angiogram) show atherosclerosis blocking flow in an artery.
Tracking down plaque with a transcranial doppler ultrasound
The transcranial doppler test looks for atherosclerotic plaques in the larger
brain arteries inside your skull. Transcranial means “through the skull.” This
test uses a special high-intensity sound wave to “see” through the bone of
your skull. Otherwise, it is similar in principle to the carotid ultrasound test.
Although the test often determines that plaque is partially blocking an artery
in the brain and is indeed the cause of the stroke, unfortunately, there is no
surgical treatment to re-open the artery like carotid endarterectomy (see
above). This narrow area is called a stenosis of the artery. Some experts rec-
ommend opening up these narrowed areas from inside. As yet, there isn’t
209
Chapter 12: Treating Stroke in the Hospital

much data to support the benefits of this procedure. Aspirin probably works
as well or better than warfarin to prevent future stroke when there is narrow-
ing of a brain artery inside the skull. (Aspirin is better than warfarin in almost
all cases except with a blood clot in the heart or atrial fibrillation.)
The transcranial doppler test is also used when you have a red stroke due to
SAH. The doppler can tell if vessels are going into spasm in reaction to all the
bleeding, and immediate treatment can be given.
Reducing the risk of another white stroke
Four critical steps can help prevent a second white stroke:
1. Take a drug to slow down your blood clotting.
2. Have carotid endarterectomy to check for blockage.
3. Learn the signs and symptoms of stroke so you can get to the emergency
department faster in the future.
4. Control your high blood pressure better, get your cholesterol down, stop
smoking, and control diabetes.
Checking your heart
If you’ve had a white (ischemic) stroke (or a red — intracerebral — stroke,
for that matter), you don’t just have high risk of another stroke. You also have
high risk of heart disease. An exam by a cardiologist during your hospital
stay is critical in determining the status of your heart and blood vessels. An
electrocardiogram (EKG) is an easy and virtually pain-free test. The suction
cups some doctors still use on your chest wall may leave bruises, but besides
that, the test is just another small event in the complex day of the recovering
stroke patient.
Your doctor might schedule a stress test of your heart, which consists of a
fast walk on a treadmill. This can be a bit of hard work if you haven’t been
doing regular aerobic exercise. Obviously, any disability from your stroke 
will have to be taken into account. If you have a paralyzed arm or leg, you
can’t take the test without some special help and equipment.
Checking your cholesterol level
Blood tests tell you and your doctor whether you need any cholesterol-lower-
ing drugs. If your cholesterol level is high, reducing the amount of fat in your
blood — through drugs and diet — can help prevent stroke. What is defined as
“high” cholesterol has been a changing number in recent years. Your doctor
will help you figure out what to do in your individual situation. For example, it
is thought to be more worthwhile to treat cholesterol aggressively with drugs if
you have other risk factors such as diabetes and high blood pressure.
210
Part IV: Treating Stroke 

Considerations for diabetics
Are you diabetic? This might be a good time for evaluation by an endocrinolo-
gist who specializes in diabetes. Controlling your glucose can have a lot 
of benefits for your health. Clinical trials have not proven that managing 
glucose levels better will reduce your chances of stroke, but uncontrolled
diabetes makes all the other risk factors worse for you. There are many 
other benefits of good control of your glucose: for your eyes, kidneys, and
presumably many other parts of yourself.
Preventing future ICH red strokes
High blood pressure is the most common cause of intracerebral (ICH) red
strokes — those that bleed within the brain. If you are over 50 or 55 and have
high blood pressure, the cause of your stroke is usually just that. If you are
especially young and do not have high blood pressure or another reason that
explains your red stroke, then further tests may be conducted. A cerebral
angiogram is a likely procedure to be scheduled. MRI scans might pick up the
presence of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) and some other abnormali-
ties of blood vessels.
After your intracerebral stroke, you may have had surgery to remove part 
of the clot. If that’s the case, you’ll receive some very specific instructions
before you are discharged from the hospital. You can also count on making
office visits to your neurosurgeon for at least a few months after the surgery.
Avoiding further SAH red strokes
You prevent the recurrence of bleeding from brain aneurysms by either clip-
ping them off from outside through the skull (a big deal) or by coiling them
off from the inside (still a big deal, but perhaps a little safer). Before such
surgery, doctors are likely to run a series of MRI studies and an angiogram to
accurately locate the aneurysm. Sometimes it’s hard to tell which aneurysm
actually did the bleeding when two or more are found.
During your time in the hospital, your doctors will likely talk about some
important steps to take at home: treating your blood pressure, for instance.
Those who have suffered a subarachnoid hemorrhage will undoubtedly be
reminded of the high risks of smoking. For women, the increased risk of sub-
arachnoid hemorrhage from the use of estrogen will probably also be dis-
cussed. You may be instructed to avoid birth-control pills or estrogen.
For female readers: If you are not on birth-control pills or hormone-
replacement therapy (estrogen) when you are admitted to the hospital 
with your stroke, your doctors may neglect to explain the risks of estrogen
211
Chapter 12: Treating Stroke in the Hospital

related to red stroke. But the risk remains whether you take estrogen 
currently or start up after your stroke. You’ll want to share the information
about your stroke history to all your doctors — including your gynecologist.

Asking for a second opinion
A 33-year-old woman jogging in the park was
seen staggering, stopping, and putting her hand
on the back of her head before falling to the
ground. She was taken by ambulance to a nearby
emergency room, where she remained uncon-
scious. Within 30 minutes, a CT scan was com-
pleted. The emergency physician told the
woman’s husband that he believed she may have
had a brain hemorrhage based on seeing blood
filling the subarachnoid space around the base of
the brain. He explained that final diagnosis
depended on a radiologist and neurosurgeon.
The neurosurgeon and the radiologist concurred
with the emergency physician and diagnosed a
subarachnoid hemorrhage. The neurosurgeon
advised that the woman be sent to a large hospi-
tal in a major nearby city for treatment of the prob-
able aneurysm that had ruptured. The woman
was delivered to and admitted to the neuro-
surgical intensive care unit. Her blood pressure
was monitored overnight, her headache pain was
controlled, and she was given drugs to prevent
her arteries from closing shut (this closing is
called vasospasm). Her husband spent the night
researching subarachnoid hemorrhage on his
laptop in his hotel room.
The neurosurgeon met with the husband imme-
diately and advised an angiogram first thing to
determine whether blood clots were present in
his wife’s brain. The doctor explained that the
procedure, which involved injecting dye into her
arteries, had some risks, but that the diagnosis
was critical. The husband agreed and was com-
forted that his wife opened her eyes and looked at
him in the ICU during his short visit. After the
angiogram, he found her sleeping peacefully. She
had a big bandage on the crease where her left
leg met her torso at the site where the radiologist
inserted the plastic tubes for the angiogram.
An hour later, the neurosurgeon told the hus-
band that the test showed a brain aneurysm
that bled and that it should be closed off soon.
The surgeon recommended that it be done with
a small clip. The husband listened and said, “Tell
me again what could go wrong.” The surgeon
repeated the risks: another stroke, infection,
death. Concerned about these possibilities, the
husband asked if there were other options.
Three more doctors diagnosed the patient:
another surgeon, a neurointerventionist, and a
neurologist. After assessing the options, the
husband finally decided on a different proce-
dure — in which the neurointerventionist would
try to close the aneurysm with coils placed from
the inside during another angiogram-like pro-
cedure. The husband preferred the uncertainty
of how long the coil would last over the risk of
the surgical complications with the clip. If the
coiling effort failed, then surgery would be con-
sidered. The neurointerventionist performed the
procedure that afternoon without any incident.
Several days later, the woman began to get
drowsy and her right-hand weakness and speech
problems suggested a white stroke. Another
emergency angiogram showed that some of her
brain arteries were in spasm and much narrower
than usual. Treatment for the vasospasm was
begun. Three weeks later, the woman was dis-
charged from the hospital. She was still a little
clumsy with her right hand and had some diffi-
culty finding words from time to time. She was
considered to have a moderate disability at the
time.

Monitoring for Brain Swelling
Brain swelling is a very serious complication of stroke and can occur for a
number of reasons. If you have a white stroke, the brain area injured by a lack
of blood will begin to swell. In red stroke, the brain swells because of the
extra blood from the bleeding. In addition, the blood can block the flow of
fluid in the ventricles and the backed-up fluid expands the brain. Finally, any
blood inside the substance of the brain causes inflammation and swelling.
Regardless of the cause, the swelling presses the brain against the inside of
the skull. This increased intracranial pressure makes a person drowsy and
can even put someone in a coma. Doctors can measure the pressure by
drilling a hole in the skull and putting in tubes or other devices. Placing a
tube in one of the fluid cavities of the brain can relieve the pressure if the
outflow of fluid is blocked. Other treatment measures include raising the
head higher than the body, using a ventilator to cause rapid breathing, con-
trolling blood pressure, and giving drugs. None of these treatments works
very well or for very long.
213
Chapter 12: Treating Stroke in the Hospital
Brain swelling from white stroke
A 63-year-old man was sitting at home watching
television when he noticed that he couldn’t move
his left arm. In fact, the left arm looked funny to
him, like it was someone else’s. He checked it a
little while later. By the time the show ended it
seemed a little better. He walked upstairs to bed
and realized that his arm hung straight down and
his hand wouldn’t grip the banister. While getting
ready for bed, his symptoms cleared, and he
went to sleep relieved. His wife woke beside him
at 5 o’clock in the morning to find him breathing
noisily. When she tried to wake him up, she
noticed his eyes were looking to one side and he
didn’t move his left arm or leg. He could speak
but seemed dazed and confused.
In the emergency room, a CT scan showed a
massive white stroke on the right side of the brain
with evidence of brain swelling. He was admitted
to an intensive care unit. Later that day he was
more responsive, but completely paralyzed on his
left side. The next morning, he was worse and
breathing irregularly. A new CT scan showed that
the swelling of the brain had increased.
Doctors explained to the family that the brain
swelling could kill him; that treatments often did
not work and that if they did, he might be left
with a major disability. The family authorized the
doctors to treat the man, as there was a rea-
sonable chance he could speak if he survived.
The doctors started drugs and procedures to
minimize the swelling. The next day his condi-
tion worsened. A CT scan showed that there
had been bleeding in the area of the white
stroke infarction. He died the same day.
There is no way to be sure that this fatal stroke
could have been avoided if he had come to the
emergency department the night before, but
chances are pretty good that the severity of the
situation might have been recognized. If he had
been hospitalized and observed carefully, he
might have been a candidate for treatment to
open up the blood vessels to the brain.

Doctors often can’t control the rise of pressure inside the skull. The result is
that the brain first shifts to one side and then begins to press down against
sharp edges in the skull at the base of the brain. These sharp edges cut into
critical areas of the brain that keep you alive. Brain swelling and subsequent
damage is one of the most common causes of death in white or red strokes.
Responding to Seizures
During the trauma of stroke, the lack of oxygen and injury to the brain puts
its protective systems out of balance. The result can be a seizure. A very
small percentage of stroke patients (1 or 2 percent) may have a seizure while
in the hospital. The shaking often starts in an arm or leg and then rapidly
spreads to include the whole body.
Seizures are usually treatable and typically do not happen again if anti-
seizure medications are started. Several medications are available, including
ophenytoin (Dilantin) and carbamazepine (Tegretol). If you have a seizure in
the hospital, your family should call for help. In the meantime, they can turn
you on one side or the other to prevent you from inhaling into your lungs any
saliva or vomitus in your mouth. You have heard of putting a stick or spoon
in the mouth of someone who is seizing. Don’t do it unless you know exactly
what you’re doing. Someone sticking anything in your mouth while you are
having a seizure is a risk to your teeth and their fingers. Sometimes, just an
arm or some other part of you will be shaking from a small partial seizure.
You may even be awake and alert. You still need to call someone to see
what’s going on. A major seizure could be starting soon.
Of course, if you have had seizures before your stroke, this increases your
odds of having seizures after a stroke.
Other Problems in the Hospital
A lot of other troubles and complications can occur while a patient is hospi-
talized. This section outlines some of these.
Blood clots in the legs
You’ve probably read about “coach class syndrome,” a condition that strikes
passengers of long airline flights. Sitting in a cramped position with their legs
pressed down into the seats for long periods of time puts flyers at risk of
developing blood clots in the veins of the legs. This same situation — sitting
or lying in a bed for days — puts hospital patients at risk for clots in the legs,
a situation that can prove fatal.
214
Part IV: Treating Stroke 

How leg clots are a risk
The blood in your leg veins is moved along slowly toward the heart in part by
the gentle squeezing whenever you contract the leg muscles. The veins have
tough but thin walls that are easily squeezed by muscles. They are likewise
easily distended by blood seeping into them from the tiny capillaries that
connect to arteries. Because the legs are typically in a position lower than
your head, blood is more likely to collect there — and clot — when you are
inactive. Once a clot begins to form in the leg veins, it stimulates the forma-
tion of more clots. Large clots as thick as one of your fingers can form inside
the largest veins deep in the thighs and calves.
These large clots are a danger in a few different ways. First, they can attach
themselves to the sides of the vein and become painfully inflamed. This con-
dition is called thrombophlebitis.
Or the clot can break off and travel through the veins toward the heart. Like
tiny streams meeting in the plain to form a small river, veins converge and
become larger as they travel toward the heart. Once a clot breaks loose in a
vein, it is bound to reach the heart where it can either block the heart and kill
you immediately or go through the heart into the lungs. Think back to high
school, when you learned that the right side of the heart takes blue blood
without oxygen from the veins and pumps it through the lungs, where it turns
red as it picks up oxygen and goes into the left side of the heart where it is
pumped out into the body.
Pulmonary embolism: When clots hit the lungs
If the clot is small enough to pass through the right side of the heart without
causing damage, its next stop, as it transfers to the outgoing transportation
system — the arteries — is the lungs. Small clots block only small bits of
lung, and blood flows through alternate pathways.
But intermediate or large clots headed to the lungs can completely block off
blood flow. The whole blood-pumping mechanism can shut down with disas-
trous results — often sudden death. The name for this whole process is pul-
monary embolism. Pulmonary refers to lungs. The embolus is the clot flying
from the heart and slamming into the lung’s smaller vessels.
If your doctors don’t treat you to prevent these clots, and you are bedridden,
chances are 25 to 50 percent that clots will form. You know now that the clot
is inevitably going to reach the heart, where it typically moves through with-
out damage but can then move on to the lung and result in a pulmonary
embolism. Death is a real possibility.
Treatments for preventing blood clots in the legs
Obviously, the best thing to do is to keep the clots from forming in the veins
in the first place. Shifting your position stirs the blood and moves it toward
the heart, keeping it from forming blood clots. So get moving! The last thing
215
Chapter 12: Treating Stroke in the Hospital

you may feel like doing — after all you’ve been through — is to get up and
take a walk down the hospital corridor. Or, if you’re unable to do that, do
simple leg exercises from your bed every hour or so. But I hope you’ll under-
stand after my explanation here that the floor nurse is not really a heartless
drill sergeant intent on making your stay as unpleasant as possible — he or
she is, in reality, looking out for your welfare when he or she insists on get-
ting you to “shake a leg.”
Doctors can also do the following to prevent leg clots:
 Treat you with drugs, such as heparin, to make your blood less likely to
clot. These medications can be administered orally or as injections
under the skin or in a vein.
 Place elastic stockings that squeeze the veins and move the blood.
 Insist that you regularly work your legs against that annoying board at
the end of the bed, designed to keep you flexing and extending your
ankles and keep the blood moving and your calf muscles stretched out.
Struggling with difficulty swallowing
After a stroke, it’s not unusual to have some difficulty swallowing. Stroke 
can cause weakness of the muscles of your mouth and throat, just as it can
make an arm or leg weak. Manifestations include drooling, a newly hoarse
and gurgly sound to your voice, difficulty with coughing, getting food trapped
in your mouth, trouble with chewing, and difficulty swallowing anything. In
fact, 30 percent of stroke patients experience these problems.
Choking, lung infection, and other dangers
With all these challenges, what often happens is food or liquid passes into
the airway rather than the esophagus and stomach. In short, liquid or solids
end up in your lungs. This is not good. In fact, it can kill you. Better hope that
someone is there and the Heimlich maneuver works for you if this happens.
Fortunately, death due to choking isn’t the most common problem caused 
by difficulties with swallowing. Malnutrition gets that dubious honor. For a
while, you feel like you’re trimming down, but then when you begin to see
emaciation in the mirror, you recognize you’re not eating enough. Poor nutri-
tion makes you weak and limits your ability to recover from stroke.
Another common result from swallowing difficulties is lung infection or pneu-
monia. All that food and liquid in your airway carries bacteria into your lung,
which can lead to a serious chest infection. Get ready for a lot of chest X-rays
and antibiotics. Even with all the best efforts of modern medicine, pneumonia
still kills about one-third of all patients who die from stroke in the first year.
Most of these deaths occur after people leave the hospital and are bedridden
in their home or a nursing home.

Testing for swallowing problems
While you are in the hospital, your doctors are likely to test you for swallow-
ing problems right away — before starting you on a regular diet. If you choke
while drinking water, then it is likely that you will have problems with food
and other liquids as well. If you can’t swallow properly, you still have to eat.
Many swallowing difficulties go away in a few days. Because you have to eat
in the meantime, you may have a tube put through your nose and down the
back of your throat into the esophagus and stomach. Not very comfortable 
at first, but more comfortable than pneumonia or not eating or drinking 
anything. You will gag and cough as the tube is passed into the back of your
throat through your nose, but then think of the convenience of not having 
to chew your food.
If your swallowing problem is not too severe, a speech therapist can show
you ways to swallow without choking. You may need a special swallowing
test to diagnose exactly which muscles are weak and to help guide the ther-
apy. You want to know its name? Video fluorography and/or barium swallow.
Read more about swallowing difficulties in Chapter 16.
Monitoring your heart
Your heart needs your brain to keep going. When the brain is injured, the
heart can’t really be trusted to keep things under control by itself. It can lose
track of its rhythm and that can literally stop you dead in your tracks. You
are also more prone to have a heart attack just after you have had a stroke.
Chances are good that you’ve already been checked for that in the emer-
gency department once you got to the hospital.
For severe strokes or those that affect the brainstem or deeper portions 
of the brain that control the heart, doctors may continue to monitor heart
rhythm during your stay. If an abnormal rhythm starts, they may administer
drugs to get it beating normally. Dangerous rhythms are most common
during the first 24 to 48 hours after a stroke. They are particularly common
after a red stroke.
Blood pressure is usually controlled by the brain. Given a brain injured by
stroke, blood pressure can be unstable, especially when the patient starts
getting active again after the first few days in bed. Getting up to get to the
bathroom or on your feet in physical therapy, blood pressure can drop. You
can count on doctors and medical personnel keeping a close and frequent
eye on your blood pressure while you are in the hospital. The worse your
brain injury, the more frequently your blood pressure will be measured.
217
Chapter 12: Treating Stroke in the Hospital

Bleeding stomach ulcers
A small percentage of stroke patients bleed from stomach ulcers. A stay in
the hospital isn’t a day at the beach for your stomach, and I’m not talking
about hospital food. Plenty of treatments and procedures give the stomach 
a hard time. For example, a stomach tube can cause the stomach to bleed.
Certain drugs — heparin, aspirin, or steroids — can result in bleeding. In fact,
just the stress of being in a hospital can cause an ulcer that bleeds. If you
have a history of stomach ulcers or pain, your doctors may give you drugs 
to reduce the injury to the stomach while you are in the hospital.
Avoiding pressure sores
Pressure sores aren’t that common anymore. Also known as bed sores, these
painful skin ulcers result when patients who are unable to move themselves
are left lying in the same position for long periods of time. Hospital staff are
well aware of the importance of keeping patients moving, not just to avoid
bed sores but to reduce the risk of blood clots in the legs. That said, a few
guidelines will help ensure that you avoid skin irritations from lying in bed.
 Don’t lie on your weak or numb side — the side of your body affected by
the stroke.
 Avoid being moved by shoving, dragging, or pulling on your weak side.
 If family members or friends are attempting to assist you, great — but
they may need some training from the floor nurse or attendant.
If you are a family member, take this time to learn how to lift, support, or
assist your loved one in getting around. Watch what the nurses do and learn
to do it yourself. You’ll be doing it at home, unless you hire a full-time nurse.
Small injuries can rapidly become major sores. If splints are applied to your
arms or legs, leave them there. Cooperate with nurses to be sure you move
around and reposition yourself. And assist by eating and keeping hydrated 
by taking in adequate fluids. This will keep your skin healthy and able to heal.
Once they develop, pressure sores are not easy to treat. Severe sores can
require plastic surgery. It they get infected, you’ll require antibiotics — 
possibly intravenously, possibly prolonging your time in the hospital.
Preparing for Life After Stroke
While you are in the hospital recovering from stroke, you and your family
have a short time to absorb and tap into valuable information and resources
that will aid in your adjustment to living with stroke after your discharge.
218
Part IV: Treating Stroke 

This comes at a time when all you want to do is rest and recover from the
shock of stroke. But if you’re going to get the most out of your hospital time,
you need to become a good listener and note-taker.
Getting the most out of your hospital stay
These steps will help you optimize your hospital experience:
 Take advantage: The hospital staff is there to help you plan for after you
leave the hospital. They have a lot of experience with stroke patients —
welcome their input and seek out their advice and knowledge.
 Work hard: I’ve said it in earlier chapters, but the sooner you start ther-
apy, the better your odds for recovery. Cooperate with the hospital 
therapists to develop a post-hospital plan and learn as much as you 
can about becoming as independent as possible.
 Observe: Watch how the nurses take care of you. You and your care-
taker can start practicing some of what you learn — whether it’s tips 
for getting out of bed into a chair or strategies for bathing.
 Gather — and give — information: Keep a list of tests done and their
results, drugs prescribed, and all the medical issues that have arisen. Be
sure that the physicians caring for you know your prestroke medical his-
tory. Doctors often don’t have access to all your old records, and even if
they did, may not take time to dig through them.
 Plan with your family: Anticipate the daily and weekly schedule after
you return home. Talk about the help you’ll need and how you’ll get it.
Set up a schedule. Make arrangements. You have much to gain by
launching a strong plan for dealing with the challenges of the future.
Getting hold of your discharge summary
Ensuring that you have thorough, accurate, and up-to-date discharge informa-
tion is critical to transitioning to life after stroke. You’ll need this detail for
yourself and your follow-up physicians and therapists. Preparing the docu-
ment called the discharge summary is the responsibility of the primary dis-
charging doctor. Hospitals can usually prove that they handed the discharge
instructions to the patient or caregiver as they left the hospital. But for what-
ever reason, these important instructions often get lost.
Don’t leave as if escaping from jail. If the nurses are in a hurry, ask them to
please sit and talk with you. Insist on getting all the information and instruc-
tions written down. Have a family member or friend take notes. Get a phone
number. No matter how obvious, write it down. Be sure you have all the pills
you need to take or a prescription. Following these instructions can have a
219
Chapter 12: Treating Stroke in the Hospital

significant and positive impact on your future health. Accurate discharge info
is of extreme importance. Just imagine if the following errors or omissions
resulted from poorly executed papers:
 You had a white stroke and aspirin or an equivalent is not on the list.
 Blood-pressure medications have been changed or deleted.
 A medication that you have taken for years is not on the list.
 Warfarin is on the list, but the need for blood tests is not mentioned.
 There are no medications listed to lower your cholesterol.
 No follow-up appointments are mentioned.
A hospital stay is extremely important to help you recover and adjust to your
circumstances. Take the care to collect information, tap into the expertise
that surrounds you, make contacts, ask questions, and observe during this
time.

W
hen it’s time for the stroke patient to be discharged from the hospital,
the doctors may recommend one of three courses of action:
 Patients who have mild or little damage may be able to return home
immediately.
 Those suffering from severe damage with little hope of recovery of their
independence may be referred to a nursing home.
 Individuals likely to benefit from rehabilitation therapy — and that’s as
many as 20 to 30 percent — will probably be directed to a rehabilitation
center.
Approximately 50 percent of stroke patients need some kind of rehabilitation.
Those who don’t get it in a rehab center have to arrange for it at home or in a
nursing home. 
The term rehab may conjure up images of celebrities escaping to luxurious
private facilities where they lounge around landscaped grounds, wear
designer robes, and dine on gourmet fare prepared by famous chefs. In truth,
a rehabilitation center is not a place where the stroke survivor is pampered
and waited on hand and foot. Instead of spa resort, think back-to-school. Yes,
the rehabilitation center is more of an educational institution offering a crash
course in skills that will help the stroke victim regain independence and lead
a fuller life.

In many cases, the rehabilitation center is a boarding school — the “stu-
dents” eat, sleep, and learn there during the course of treatment. Though 
the average term of stay is short, from one to four weeks depending on 
stroke severity, the program is intense and requires active participation 
and commitment, not just from the stroke victim but from family members 
or caregivers, too.
In this chapter, I offer the “course outline” for the rehabilitation process. 
I discuss who might make a good candidate for therapy, explain the strategy
behind rehabilitation, introduce the rehab team, outline a typical daily sched-
ule, and offer information on Medicare, Medicaid, and insurance coverage 
of rehab.
Who Should Go to Rehab
If you want a clear answer about who should and should not go to a rehabili-
tation program, you will search in vain. The answer depends on many 
different factors: doctor recommendation, severity of stroke and the damage
incurred, level of care that can be provided in the home, and, no less impor-
tant, the attitude and openness of the stroke patient and the family toward
the rehab experience.
Home, sweet home?
After a stroke, most patients are anxious to leave the hospital and return
home to familiar surroundings and routine — it’s a natural inclination to get
back to normal as quickly as possible. But in their haste to get out of the hos-
pital, many stroke patients may find themselves struggling to adjust to new
limitations, and their caretakers may be ill-equipped to help. A wife may sud-
denly find herself struggling to help her husband get in and out of bed, take a
bath, and use the toilet. A husband might need to take time off work to attend
to his wife’s needs, including feeding and clothing her. Out of loyalty, family
members may fail to express their doubts about their ability to handle a
person with brain injury. Or they may simply be unaware of how changed a
family member can be after a stroke.
I strongly encourage stroke patients and their families to be open to rehabili-
tation therapy if that is what the doctors recommend. Although you may
intend to refuse anything but the shortest possible route home, you really
should first consider the recommendations and the potential benefits of time
in a rehab program. 
222
Part IV: Treating Stroke 

“Why can’t I have rehab in my own home?” you may ask. Of course, with
unlimited resources, you can turn your home into a rehabilitation center and
have the appropriate specialists come to you. However, this turns out to be
very difficult. Scheduling difficulties, space limitations, and lack of equipment
may be a few challenges. Even more critical, you’d miss out on the interac-
tion with other patients and families in the same predicament. 
If I’ve successfully persuaded you to accept a doctor’s recommendation for
rehab, then my next goal is to convince you that it’s equally important for
family members — particularly a close partner such as a husband or wife —
to be involved in every step of the program, too.
What the doctor looks for
The rehabilitation doctor considers several factors when recommending a
stroke victim for a rehabilitation program. Three factors favor your going to
rehab: 
 Stroke severe enough to limit independence, but not severe enough to
make it unlikely you can improve
 Physical strength to endure three or more hours of physical therapy
every day
 Capability to learn and benefit from the rehab experience
The doctor is more likely to suggest a nursing home rather than a rehabilita-
tion center if the patient
 Has had a prior stroke
 Is very frail from other medical problems
 Can’t make it to the bathroom without help
 Has serious problems with memory or thinking
 Is unable to understand or cooperate with therapists
 Requires constant medical monitoring
 Is unlikely to be able to return home after maximum rehabilitation
How much rehabilitation is needed?
Most stroke patients who go into a rehab center stay for weeks — not
months. (Though many have told me later that they wished they could have
223
Chapter 13: Rehabilitation

stayed longer.) But each stroke patient is unique and, consequently, will
follow different programs with different time requirements. 
For example, patients with mild deficits may need only one or two weeks at
the rehabilitation center. On the other hand, if the patient is paralyzed on the
right side and has difficulty speaking and understanding language, he or she
may require three weeks of rehabilitation before returning home. If the weak-
ness is on the left side, the patient may not have speech difficulties, but may
have trouble paying attention long enough to accomplish anything. Also, this
patient may be more likely to fall, because the brain doesn’t take notice of 
the fact that the left arm or leg isn’t working. In this case, a longer stay — 
perhaps four weeks — in rehabilitation may be needed (if appropriate). An
experienced doctor can usually make a good guess about the time that will
be needed in rehab. However, the initial plan can be changed based on how
things actually work out, which may vary from original predictions.
The Rehab Strategy
As I said earlier, the goal of rehabilitation is to help the patient adjust to life
after stroke as much as possible — regaining function as capacity allows,
adapting to limitations by developing new skills, and learning to use tools 
to help compensate — all with the purpose of helping the stroke survivor
return home and lead an independent life.
Keeping muscles ready for recovery 
When your left or right side is paralyzed by a stroke, the inactivity of the
muscles on the affected side can cause serious problems — without use, par-
alyzed limbs draw up tightly into awkward positions that become permanent
as muscles form tight, unstretchable bands called muscle contractures.
To keep muscles ready for action as the brain recovers, the muscles must be
kept flexible and strong. Daily stretching and strengthening exercises keep
muscles fit and supple. This is preventive maintenance for future recovery.
Even if no function returns, it is still important.
Making do with what’s left: Substitution
Most time in rehab is spent learning to use what you have in order to replace
what you’ve lost.
This involves instruction and practice, but it may also require specially fitted
braces and simple tools to help with some tasks. The recovering brain can’t
224
Part IV: Treating Stroke 

shut down and wait to heal before resuming its work. It has to keep things
running the best it can. First comes survival, and for this the parts of the
brain distant from and not connected to the injured area have to take on new
activities previously managed by the injured part of the brain. Think of this
as substitution.
Here are some examples of how the stroke survivor substitutes:
 Your right hand is partially paralyzed, and you cannot yet hold a pen.
You try writing with the left hand; it is clumsy but it gets the job done. 
 Your left leg is too weak to support you. By using your right arm and leg
for strength, you learn to get out of bed and into a wheelchair. Not as
good as walking, but it gets you where you need to go.
 Your right foot points down when you take a step. You wear a foot brace
that keeps your foot at 90 degrees from your leg. This makes it easier to
walk and keeps a contracture from happening to your calf muscle. The
brace substitutes for your calf in raising up your foot when you walk.
 Your right hand is weak and can’t hold a spoon or fork effectively. You
use special utensils to make it easier to get the food into your mouth. 
Brain recovery: Use it or lose it
During the days and weeks following stroke, the brain does actually generate
a few new cells. And some injured brain cells may learn to activate new 
connections that bypass the injured neurons and begin functioning again. In
this process, some lost abilities may return. Most of this biological recovery
seems to be finished after three months, although there may be some ongo-
ing recovery for a year or more.
But here’s the exciting news: Some evidence indicates that exercising these
injured cells may increase the speed and extent of recovery. Here’s how it
works: First, the injury from stroke is variable and patchy, depending on the
way the blood flows and the access of blood supply near the injured tissue.
True, stroke completely destroys some brain cells. But those that are only par-
tially injured can partially recover. Growth of new blood vessels may be stimu-
lated; formation of new connections to other brain cells may be fostered. 
And what is it that stimulates these new, healthy connections? Using those
brain cells. Exercising the arm or leg weakened by stroke or repeatedly grasp-
ing a pen in a weakened hand. Physical activity appears to be important 
in stimulating those injured cells to recover, especially during the first few
months after the stroke — although significant improvement has been
observed in a small percentage of patients 6 and even 12 months after a
stroke. Such early effort also has the effect of increasing muscle strength 
and reducing the possibility of contractures, which is the first rehab tactic.
Sometimes the improvement is small — but even small changes in hand
strength can have a large impact on your ability to gain independence. 
225
Chapter 13: Rehabilitation

In previous decades, the major goal for rehabilitation was to focus on substi-
tution while avoiding intense therapy that might put too much stress on the
recovering brain. These days, most experts agree that physical activity pro-
motes brain reorganization and enhances recovery.
Preventing additional strokes
Another critical rehab goal is to prevent future strokes. Those who have
already suffered a stroke are the likeliest to have a stroke. It’s critical to do
everything possible to avoid another one. See Chapter 10 for a list of preven-
tive steps. Your medical care and evaluation needs to continue after you
leave the hospital for rehab. This includes taking medications, continuing
tests to determine the cause of your stroke, adjusting your blood-pressure
medications, getting your cholesterol under control, and more. Stroke pre-
vention should not wait for you to “settle down” after your stroke. A second
stroke is more likely in the weeks immediately after a first stroke. If you let
down your guard, you miss the opportunity to prevent stroke. 
226
Part IV: Treating Stroke 
A rehab success story
A man in his 50s, a computer programmer, had
a right arm and leg stroke that spared his com-
prehension of speech but limited his ability to
speak clearly. After his hospital treatment was
completed, he was admitted to a rehabilitation
center. His rehabilitation nurse explained that
she was there to encourage him to reach his
maximum potential. He diligently followed his
program, a unique plan designed to deal with
his particular stroke symptoms.
The first days on the unit, he was moved in a
wheelchair, but he quickly graduated to a
walker. He worked hard in the facility’s gym.
Each day he received three hours of therapy
directed at the practical issues of living, such as
eating, brushing his teeth, buttoning shirts, and,
eventually, typing. In addition, he participated in
programs to help reconnect him to people. He
was taken on trips into the community, includ-
ing restaurants, department stores, and grocery
stores. His nurses urged him to be as indepen-
dent as he could.
At the same time, a social worker began to make
arrangements for his return home. These
arrangements included continuation of the phys-
ical therapy and actual modifications to the layout
of the furniture in the home and moving in special
equipment to help improve his independence.
After one month in the rehabilitation center, he
was able to return to both his home and his job.
His recovery was attributed to his ability to under-
stand language, his eagerness to cooperate with
his therapists, and his high spirits. 

The rehab curriculum
Enrolling in a rehabilitation center is a full-time commitment — you are 
“in school” 24 hours every day. Rehabilitation nurses oversee patient care
around the clock and work closely with patients to encourage self-care 
and attention to personal hygiene. 
Although all stroke rehab patients are encouraged to follow a similar level 
of commitment and diligence, each patient receives a custom “curriculum”
based on unique needs, deficits, and goals. Specific sessions with various
227

Things may get worse before they get better
A 78-year-old man experienced the sudden
onset of numbness, weakness, and slurring of
speech. His wife recognized the symptoms and
called 911. While in the hospital, he then had a
second stroke. After eight days, he was trans-
ferred to a rehabilitation unit. Upon admission,
he was unable to walk because his right leg
would not support his weight, and his ability to
move his right arm and hand was limited. His
speech had improved to the extent that he could
participate in a short conversation. 
After three weeks, physical therapy enabled
him to move from chair to bed and to walk with
the help of one person and a walker; the occu-
pational therapy helped him dress himself. With
plans to continue rehabilitation one day a week,
he was discharged. He and his wife were both
eager for his return home. 
But things did not go well: Shortly, he gave up
using the walker and returned to a wheelchair.
His wife started helping him wash and dress. He
began spending more time in one room, lying on
a couch. Other than a weekly outing with a friend,
he refused to leave home, feeling he was too
much of a burden to his wife. 
He continued to go for weekly physical therapy
but didn’t use what he learned there at home. He
was now afraid of falling and no longer felt com-
fortable and secure in his home. After two
months, his hand movement still did not improve,
yet he learned a way to play cards using a holder
rigged up by a friend. This improved his motiva-
tion to begin dealing with the other impairments
caused by his stroke. When his wife was sick, his
daughter had to move in with him to care for him
until his wife recovered.
Everyone has to adjust to the consequences of
stroke in his own way. Working through the
depression and discouragement is not easy for
anyone. Renegotiating relationships and depen-
dencies takes time and patience on everyone’s
part. Setting expectations at a reasonable level
is as difficult for the patient as it is for the family.
Eventually, almost all patients and families come
to terms with stroke disabilities and are able to
get on with their lives. The message of this book
is not that you should recover completely from
your stroke or that you should do this or that.
The message is more that there are a lot of
opportunities to help you recover, however you
choose to do it. Success is usually wrought out
of multiple hard knocks and failures.

specialists are scheduled in most units. A typical day’s schedule might be 
as follows:
6:00 – 7:00 a.m.
Morning dressing in your room 
7:00 – 8:00 a.m.
Breakfast in a dining room with others
9:00 a.m. – noon
Sessions with therapists
Noon – 1:00 p.m.
Lunch in a dining room with a group
1:00 – 4:00 p.m.
Sessions with therapists
5:00 – 6:00 p.m. 
Dinner in a dining room with a group
Some centers run on five-day schedules, others on six-day schedules. Patients
may be encouraged to wear their own loose-fitting clothes for exercising, a
sweater or jacket, pajamas, and comfortable shoes. Depending on individual
limitations, patients may be encouraged to get themselves around in the unit
to the various activities and meals. This is a good place to really push hard to
see how much you can do on your own. It is safe, and the people about can
suggest ways to work around difficulties.
Furthermore, there is good evidence that the harder and sooner you push,
the better the brain may recover lost capabilities. Pushing your limits stimu-
lates your brain to recover. The more you try, even if you don’t succeed, the
better you will do in the long run. 
Meet the Rehab Faculty
Rehabilitation is a team effort. The players include the stroke survivor, family
members or caretaker, and the trained experts who work with the rehab pro-
gram. A physician — either a physiatriast (a specialist in rehabilitation medi-
cine) or a neurologist (a specialist in the nervous system and its diseases) —
usually heads up the team. The rest of the team focuses on various therapies,
physical needs, and transition from rehab to the real world. Let’s meet some
of the key players.
Physical therapists: Helping with mobility
When most of us think of rehabilitation, we think of physical therapy. And,
indeed, the physical therapist plays a crucial role in the recovery of a stroke
patient, working with a patient to increase general strength, condition mus-
cles, develop endurance, and help the patient regain as much function and
independence as possible through enhanced mobility.
228
Part IV: Treating Stroke 

In an intense program, you may spend three hours six days a week with a
physical therapist. An hour every weekday is more usual. Not everyone has
the strength and endurance to tolerate even an hour. The exercises depend
on the disability and come in three parts: teaching, practicing, and home-
work. If the difficulty is with walking, for instance, you will be re-taught how
to walk, you will practice what you are taught with a therapist present, and, 
if useful, you will be given suggestions about how to practice and keep new
skills when you are back in your room on your own.
After stroke, some patients neglect and ignore the parts of their body dam-
aged or paralyzed by stroke, making it difficult to eat, dress, wash, or move.
The physical therapist addresses the mobility aspects of this neglect and
assists the patient with exercises that involve walking, standing, transferring
from chair to bed, and using a wheelchair or walker. The physical therapist
also identifies needs for braces and other special equipment.
Occupational therapists: Everyday skills
You might think an occupational therapist has something to do with employ-
ment. Actually, occupational therapists teach stroke patients ways to perform
the simple tasks of everyday living — cooking, eating, dressing — through
individually designed exercises and the use of special tools. The occupational
therapist is familiar with the patient’s impairments and teaches the patient
how to dress, eat, bathe, groom, use the toilet, and perform other routine
tasks. It’s surprising how hard these simple tasks can be when you have only
one good hand or if you are sitting in a wheelchair.
The occupational therapist not only helps the stroke patient with therapeutic
exercises that strengthen and increase range of motion, but also teaches the
patient new ways of approaching tasks and suggests special tools or equip-
ment to help achieve success. An hour with an occupational therapist can 
be very tiring. Listening and learning take a lot of effort. Practicing new skills
can fatigue your brain. Practicing on your own after you have rested really
locks in what you have learned and speeds your progress remarkably. 
If there is anything that is good about stroke, it is that stroke usually leaves
one side or the other normal. Occupational therapists are magicians at 
teaching you how to do with one hand what usually takes two hands. Long-
handled tools can pick up items dropped on the floor, special spoons are
easily gripped without spilling, zipper pullers, and slight of hand tricks will
handle buttons on shirts. Where there is a will, there is a way. The occupa-
tional therapist is your opportunity to learn how to get everyday tasks done
once you decide to do them.
229
Chapter 13: Rehabilitation

Speech therapists: Bridging gaps 
Speech therapists (also called speech language pathologists) focus on speech,
but also address other communication-related problems, including swallow-
ing and breathing, understanding, hearing, and vision (reading). They may
evaluate the patient’s risk of choking or inhaling food while eating by running
tests to determine whether the throat muscles are working properly. They
might work with patients to improve the clarity of their speech and teach
them methods to overcome problems with memory and thinking. 
Speech therapists also address problems related to aphasia (ay FAY zha), the
inability to understand language, which is common among stroke patients.
The word aphasia is thrown around quite a bit, and you will surely hear it if
you or a family member suffer stroke-related language problems. It does not
refer to grammar or a stutter or slurred speech, but to problems that arise
when part of the brain that spent years learning a language is not functioning.
Hence, someone in your own family can sound as if he or she is speaking a
foreign language. Or a patient may be able to understand spoken language
fairly well, but written words are unrecognizable or have no meaning. The
speech therapist helps the patient find a communication method that works
until the language understanding improves (as it often does).
An hour with a speech therapist is spent learning the components of
processes most of us have never thought much about. How does your tongue
move when you are saying the word liquid? How do your lips move when you
say baseball? What exercises would be helpful if you wanted to learn to speak
more clearly? Relearning speech is made more difficult because practicing
speaking involves another person. You have to show your disability to others
and face their reactions as well as cope with relearning to speak. Often you
find yourself preferring one person or another to practice with. You are lucky
if you can find one who will wait while you struggle to get words out right.
Working around aphasia is like finding secret passages in an old house.
Stroke patients with aphasia often seem to know what they want to say, but
only communicate the frustration of not being able to say it. Eventually,
though, the brain begins to figure out how to get messages out, and the path-
way is often unusual. Sometimes words come out in other languages that you
know, or through writing. Showing someone pictures may bring out a word
unavailable from memory. Solving language comprehension problems and
learning to express yourself with limited language skills is daunting. 
Nurses: Medical management
While in the rehabilitation unit, medical management of the patient’s stroke
continues. Rehab nurses monitor blood pressure and other vital signs 
and administer medication. They also participate in the rehabilitation 
230
Part IV: Treating Stroke 

program — sometimes in ways that may surprise you. For instance, they may
expect you to do more for yourself than their counterparts in the hospital
did. Instead of bringing dinner bedside and feeding you, the rehab nurse may
encourage you to go to the dining room, even if it means struggling out of bed
and using a walker to get there. This is part of the program.
Social workers: Making sense of it all
Social workers facilitate the transition from rehab to the real world, helping
families plan for services they’ll need upon the patient’s return home — or
transfer to a nursing home. They have the difficult job of trying to make the
whole medical-care system work for the patient. They help you understand
what help you can expect from your insurance and your community, includ-
ing your employer, if you have one. Their goal is to get you out of the hospital
and into a situation where you can be as independent as possible and still
maintain your health. Often they face a significant challenge as needs fre-
quently outstrip the resources available. 
A social worker might arrange for special equipment to be used in the home,
schedule outpatient nursing and rehabilitation home visits, and connect you
to support groups. Social workers are also concerned with the social process
of reintegrating the patient with family and community after rehabilitation.
Other specialists involved in the rehab program may include the following:
 Neuropsychologists measure changes in your cognitive abilities and
your personality. They can suggest ways to deal with many cognitive
problems, including difficulty with memory.
 Vocational rehabilitation counselors work with you and your current
employer to get you back to work, either at your old job or a new one.
 Dieticians help work around medical problems related to diet. This can
range from counseling a diabetic to helping someone with difficulty
swallowing.
 Orthotists fit braces and other assist devices. 
Family and other caregivers
Family members and caregivers can learn important information and skills
from taking part in the rehab experience. Skills include knowing how to help
you move from a wheelchair to and from a car and to assist with range-of-
movement exercises and bathing — and knowing what they are expected to
231
Chapter 13: Rehabilitation

attempt on their own and what they should be letting you do. The experts on
the rehab team can do a much better job of making things work out for you
when you return home if they know who will be available to help. 
It is also important that the stroke experience not have adverse effects on the
health of family members or caregivers. By participating in group discussions
and interacting with the staff, loved ones have an opportunity to address
doubts and uncertainties about their ability to provide the emotional and
physical support required by the patient — before they find themselves in 
a difficult or impossible situation that makes them depressed or ill.
Paying for Rehabilitation
Just as private schools and universities carry a high price tag, most rehabili-
tation centers charge fees that all but the most affluent might find staggering.
Some rehabilitation units are run as profit-making businesses, and although
they may provide excellent care and services, you have to be sure you can
afford the care. You may want to consult with other family members and
physicians to see if there are alternatives that could attain the same goals
with lower out-of-pocket costs. Fortunately, most stroke victims can seek
financial support through government programs or private insurance. 
Medicare and Medicaid
Medicare is the federal health-insurance program for U.S. citizens 65 years or
older and for certain Americans with disabilities. Medicare has two parts:
 Hospital insurance (known as Part A): Helps pay for home health care,
hospice care, inpatient hospital care, and inpatient care in a skilled nurs-
ing facility.
 Supplementary medical insurance (known as Part B): Helps pay for
doctors’ services, outpatient hospital services, durable medical equip-
ment, and other services and supplies not covered by Part A.
Social Security Administration offices across the country take applications
for Medicare and provide general information about the program. 
In some cases, Medicare helps pay for outpatient services from a Medicare-
participating comprehensive outpatient rehabilitation facility. Covered 
services include the following: physicians’ services; physical, speech, occu-
pational, and respiratory therapies; counseling; and other related services. 
A physician must certify that skilled rehabilitation services are needed and
must refer a stroke patient. This ensures that an expert in the care of stroke
patients thinks the effort and time are worthwhile.
232
Part IV: Treating Stroke 

Medicaid is a federal program operated by the states. The states determine
eligibility and scope of health services offered and provide healthcare cover-
age for some low-income people who cannot afford it. Others who might be
eligible are older, blind, or disabled individuals, or individuals in families with
young children.
Medical insurance
You pick your insurance company before you have a stroke, not after. Now
you have to figure out what you bought. There are a slew of private medical
and health-insurance products, as well as health maintenance organizations
(HMOs). They all handle coverage for stroke rehabilitation in their own way
and vary to some extent, depending on the level of insurance and the particu-
lar benefits of the individual companies offering the insurance. 
What care you get may depend to some extent on what is offered by your par-
ticular plan. While some plans provide for in-hospital rehabilitation, others
emphasize in-home or outpatient programs. Talk with your care provider and
your insurance company to determine what is best for you.
All insurance programs have limits, and some stop paying as soon as the
patient stops making progress. Often, the hospital’s social service depart-
ment can answer questions about insurance coverage. Some decisions are
based on opinion. If you feel the wrong decision has been made, there are
often ways you can get the decision changed by communicating directly 
with the insurance company and your doctors. Be a squeaky wheel.
Graduating: Life After Stroke
Congratulations! It’s graduation day — and you’re ready to leave the rehabili-
tation center. Stroke survivors and family caregivers alike have looked for-
ward to this day when home life can resume — if not “just like before,” at
least with the knowledge that they’ve gained new skills in order to adapt to
life after stroke.
Like any educational program, the time you invest in rehab is worth only
what you take home with you. For that reason, whether you’re the stroke 
survivor or the caregiver, be sure you clearly understand what you must 
do to continue the efforts you’ve started. It is part of the procedure in rehab
units to meet with the patient and family and discuss a follow-up plan. This 
is important stuff. Often, with the excitement of going home or the rush to 
get moving before the car gets towed from the front of the hospital, papers
get lost and important advice is not heard. 
233
Chapter 13: Rehabilitation

The following checklist covers most of the critical issues that should be dis-
cussed as you prepare to leave the rehab facility. Use it as a “crib sheet” for
your final meeting with the rehab doctor. Try to get detailed answers to each
of the questions and then share this list with all family members — not just
your spouse or caretaker. It is important for everyone involved to know what
is expected of them. The family shares responsibilities for monitoring the suc-
cess of the transition home and the stress on the patient and the caregiver.
 List of all known medical problems
 List of all medications and purpose of each, with accurate descriptions
of the doses
 Name of a rehabilitation person who can be called if there are problems
 Schedule of outpatient and in-home visits clearly written out in one
place
 List of equipment expected to be supplied at home and a telephone 
contact
 Schedule for family members not in the home to check in with caretaker
and patient
 Name and phone number of a doctor to call for medical problems
 Instructions to call 911 if there is a second stroke
Make copies of the preceding list and distribute to all family members and
caregivers.
The goal of the rehab unit team is not to take care of you. It is to train you to
take care of yourself and to make the best use of your support system. With
the intention of helping you, the team may have presented you with some
tough challenges and difficult situations. But as you’re ready to return to
your community — home, social world, and work — you’ve gained an educa-
tion that will help you not just survive but thrive as a survivor of stroke.

L
ife after stroke involves learning new ways of living
and coping. There are limitations and challenges to
be surmounted, and changes to familiar routines and
plans have to be considered. These chapters cover return-
ing home after the hospital, thinking about residential
placement, dealing with the financial stresses, and con-
fronting the hard choices and issues families have to face.
It’s important to not try to do everything yourself — be
willing to ask for help. There is a lot of help to be had 
out there, and accepting it can help ease the pain for
everyone.

I
n this chapter, I address many of the issues you face after you return 
home and begin to adjust to life after stroke. During this transition time,
you are confronted with a number of new challenges and responsibilities.
One of those demands is to continue therapy either at home or at an outpa-
tient facility. Another is to assess your capabilities. As you continue to
improve and to know better what you can and can’t do, you can begin to 
plan for the long-term.
An important part of the planning is to have some sort of estimate of how 
different your condition will be in six months to a year from the onset of
stroke. By now you may have asked this many times of physicians, thera-
pists, and other stroke patients. They really don’t know an exact answer, and
each person you talk to may offer different descriptions of your future. I offer
you some information so you can form your own estimate of how you will do.
This may allow you to do a better job of planning your approach to your new
life after stroke.
The good news is that unless you have a second stroke, or another medical
condition intervenes, you can be reasonably certain that your stroke symp-
toms will lessen gradually with time. How much depends on
 The severity of injury due to the stroke
 Your health in general and whether you suffer from conditions such as
heart disease, cancer, or dementia

 Your efforts to prevent a second stroke
 What rehabilitation efforts you make to protect and enhance your 
recovery
Avoid the Three-Stroke Rule
It’s a good idea to do everything you can to prevent a second stroke. The rule
is: Three strokes and you’re out. In a study of 150 or so stroke survivors in
one town, 80 to 90 percent had had only one stroke; 10 percent had two
strokes; and a few had three strokes. None had more than three strokes.
Presumably, those that did were dead.
As to the type of stroke among those who survived a year or more, 90 percent
experienced the white type, and 10 percent suffered from red strokes. About
half of the stroke survivors had some kind or residual paralysis, close to 20
percent had some sort of language problem, and 10 percent had both paraly-
sis and language problems. Another 15 percent had difficulty speaking, while
15 percent had lost part of their vision to one side, and 25 percent had loss of
sensation on one side.
By the way, I have to repeat the obvious: If you do have another stroke, how-
ever small it is, call 911 and get to an emergency room right away. Don’t call a
family member. Don’t call your physician. Call 911. It’s your brain.
Recovering Slowly but Surely
Another study reflects the positive outlook for stroke recovery: The patients
left the hospital at approximately seven to ten days after their stroke. When
they were examined three months later, almost all showed some improvement.
Consider language recovery: More than half of the patients with language
problems showed some degree of improvement by three months, and 25 
percent of those had improved their language abilities to normal levels. This
is the good news. On the downside, 1 out of 20 of those who left the hospital
with no language problems became worse and developed language problems
in the next three months due almost entirely to subsequent strokes.
Approximately 70 percent of patients leaving the hospital had no weakness in
their right arms. Three months later, that had increased to 75 percent. And of
the 30 percent who did have some degree of right-arm weakness, half or more
238
Part V: Living with Stroke 

showed some degree of improvement. More good news: 25 percent of those
with some degree of right-arm weakness had no weakness three months after
leaving the hospital. However, as with language, a few patients, 1 or 2 percent
of them, got worse — possibly because of a second stroke, failure to maintain
strength by exercising, or because they developed pain or stiffness.
In general, patients who continue to improve greatly outnumber those who
lose ground during the three months after leaving the hospital. Typically, this
holds true for face and leg weakness, although slight weakness in the face is
sometimes more noticeable than slight weakness in the arms or legs. In gen-
eral, if you maintain your muscle tone and flexibility, you can look forward 
to a slow but steady improvement in the strength of your weak arm or leg 
following your return home.
It is fortunate that the most severe stroke impairments — living in a nursing
home or becoming dependent on a caregiver for mobility or normal everyday
maintenance — are the least common outcome from stroke. There is no dif-
ference in recovery rates between men and women.
Rewiring the Brain
What is your brain doing to help out? Here’s good news that may be surprising
to people who thought the brain stopped growing at age 20: After an injury
such as stroke, the brain reorganizes itself to adjust for deficits caused by the
injury. Special brain-imaging studies show that after an injury, the brain can
rewire itself and form new connections between brain cells, transferring the
work of the injured area to some other, usually nearby, part of the brain.
Research shows that the brain forms more new connections if the patient 
is more active. For example, if you work six hours a day to move your weak
hand, you will get more return of function than if you work three hours a 
day. This is not because the muscles are stronger, but because the brain
makes new connections and regains the control that was lost due to the
stroke. More good news: The more effort you make to “exercise” your brain,
the better your brain will respond by rewiring its connections.
This is why rehabilitative efforts are so critical in the first few months after
stroke — to help speed up and increase the extent of brain recovery from
stroke. (See Chapter 13 for more information about this amazing brain 
function.)

Chapter 14: Returning Home: Adapting to a New Life

New Disabilities Will 
Affect How You Live
So far I have been talking about specific brain functions that are changed by
stroke. Let’s look at how stroke can affect how you live. The following table
shows the percentages of stroke patients who exhibit various limitations
common to stroke. The numbers refer to the percentage of all stroke patients
who develop a new disability that was not already present before their
stroke.
Decreased ability to do household tasks
36%
Decreased socialization outside the home
31
Decreased ability to use outside transportation
31
Decreased vocational function
27
Decreased interest in hobbies and other pursuits

Dependency in the activities of daily living
23
Dependent in mobility
16
Decreased socialization at home
15
Move to a nursing home
13
Stroke changes your personality
You may notice something about the disabilities listed in the preceding table.
Some of them have no direct relationship to the physical impairments caused
by stroke. Decreased interests and reduced socialization, for example, are
common problems after stroke. This could be a side-effect of problems with
language and difficulty with transportation. But the data illustrate an impor-
tant lesson for the stroke survivor and family: Stroke causes social impair-
ments as well as physical limitations.
It may come as no surprise that caregivers and spouses often report that it’s
no picnic to live with a loved one after he or she suffers a stroke. More than
60 percent of those who’ve experienced taking care of a stroke survivor
describe the loved one as less patient, for example. The following table lists
the percentage of patients who lose some good personality traits.

From caregiver reports, it seems that about half of stroke survivors appear 
to be more bored, unhappy, worried, and frustrated than they were prior to
their stroke. Further, but to a lesser extent, caregivers describe stroke sur-
vivors as exhibiting more dissatisfaction, irritability, and unreasonableness
after their stroke than before.
The long and the short of it is that emotional and behavioral changes put
more stress on the people living with the stroke victim than the physical
impairments do. These changes can also slow and diminish recovery from
stroke.
Stroke survivors may not be sensitive to the fact that their frustrations and
impatience may manifest in behaviors that negatively affect loved ones.
Think about it: You used to be able to brush your teeth with your right hand.
Now, when you try, the toothpaste gets all over the sink. You get impatient
and frustrated. You may yell, cry, throw things. Then you begin to notice that
everyone in your family seems to be avoiding you — or tip-toeing around you
during these times. For help for the caregiver, see the “Taking care of the
spouse or caregiver” section later in this chapter.
It’s hard to become more patient or easygoing. However, part of adjusting to
life after a stroke is learning to live with your new limitations. Hopefully the
information provided in this chapter will help you develop some realistic
expectations for the future. I can’t say the predictions made here will be any
better than the weatherman’s are at telling you whether it is going to rain on
a particular day, but at least it’s a start. If I accurately conveyed the data to
you, you should think that the future is mostly sunny or at worst partly
cloudy with only a 20- to 30-percent chance of rain.
In more than 90 percent of strokes, the weather in three months will be better
than it is today.
Part of the improvement that is possible after stroke comes from learning
new ways to do things, part comes from the brain rewiring itself, and part
depends on your accepting the changes and getting on with the rest of your
life.
241
Chapter 14: Returning Home: Adapting to a New Life

Don’t mess with depression
Depression. Suspect it is there. Hunt it down. Treat it before it wastes more of
your time.
Depression, from moderate to severe, affects nearly half of stroke patients
who return home. The depression usually doesn’t last longer than seven or
eight months, but if untreated, it can slow the recovery process dramatically.
You might already be thinking, “Who wouldn’t be depressed after a stroke?”
To some extent, depression after stroke is due to the unhappy situation and
is a normal reaction. However, that doesn’t fully explain it. Fortunately,
depression is now treatable. The only difficulty is facing up to its presence,
having the temerity to talk about it with a physician, and then getting it
treated, sometimes by taking anti-depressant medication. As with blood 
pressure, a number of affordable, generic drugs treat depression.
“I take enough pills,” you may think. “Besides, life is hard — I can’t expect to
be happy all the time. I should tough this out, struggle through.” This attitude
is all well and good when you’re talking about confronting physical limita-
tions and facing post-stroke difficulties. However, by neglecting to address
depression, you may be holding yourself back from successfully adjusting to
your new life — and you may even deprive your brain of the opportunity to
restore some function. (Review the “Rewiring the Brain” section earlier in this
chapter.)
Depression is more than unhappiness. People who are not depressed can be
unhappy. Depression is a state of mind — a state of brain, you might say —
involving a general decline in energy. The symptoms can be fatigue, lack of
interest, social withdrawal, and irritability. Do these sound familiar? They are
the very symptoms that make people who live with you unhappy and frus-
trated. They are the same symptoms that lead to canceling therapy appoint-
ments, not trying as hard as you can, and forgetting to do your range-of-motion
exercises three times per day. Treating depression can be a key to moving for-
ward in your recovery from stroke.
How do you find out if you are depressed? You can start by asking the people
you spend time with — family members, caregivers, therapists. Many nurses
are particularly good at picking up on depression. Be aware, though, that
some individuals may not be frank with you. This is particularly true among
those who have an emotional or social connection to you. Even a spouse —
especially a spouse — may fear a confirmation of depression may make you
even further depressed.
242
Part V: Living with Stroke 

Approach the issue of depression with a spouse or loved one when you 
have time to delve deeper and explain that it is important to know whether
you seem depressed. Under such circumstances, you are more likely to get
honest and objective feedback. But even if your loved one conveys that you
don’t “seem” depressed, yet you feel unhappy inside, anxious, or empty, 
then it is critical to consult a physician.
Likewise, caregivers or family members should pursue a conversation with a
stroke survivor if they suspect depression is an issue. This may be difficult —
as I discussed earlier, stroke sufferers are often impatient and angry as they
adjust to their condition. Initiate a conversation during a “neutral” moment —
not when the individual has just shoved his or her walker to the floor in frus-
tration. If you are unable to communicate successfully, share your concerns
with your loved one’s physician.
You may ask, “Isn’t it the physician’s job to diagnose depression?” Certainly 
if a doctor suspects depression, he or she will explore the possibility with 
the patient. But to diagnose a condition, the physician must have the critical
information. A doctor could not, for example, be expected to diagnose high
cholesterol without the appropriate blood tests. No blood test, urinalysis, or
X-rays currently exist that detect depression. Although a physician may be
able to recognize signs of depression in a brief follow-up exam, often these
appointments are rushed and focus on more immediate physical concerns.
I would like to believe that most physicians look for signs of depression in
their stroke patients — but to ensure that any issues of depression are
addressed, it is critical that either the stroke patient or family member raise
such concerns with the doctor.
Taking care of the spouse or caregiver
A stroke can have a big impact on the spouse or caregiver. Those close to the
stroke survivor are also extremely vulnerable to depression and emotional
problems resulting from dramatic changes in their loved one — and from the
impact on their own lives. Stroke survivors should certainly be encouraged
to be aware that family members suffer from the stroke, too. But they may
not be in a position to ease the burdens of their caregivers. To some extent,
caregivers have to learn that looking out for their own psychological well-
being has benefits for both themselves and the person they are caring for.
Someone who is depressed isn’t likely to do a good job taking care of some-
one who is disabled.
If you are a spouse or primary caregiver to a stroke victim, be sure that you
are taking care of yourself. You, too, have suffered a traumatic, life-altering
243
Chapter 14: Returning Home: Adapting to a New Life

experience and must be alert to its impact on you. Although there’s nothing
you can do to change the facts or the limitations and demands stroke places
on your loved one and yourself, you must take measures to protect your
health and emotional well-being.
Stroke support groups are outstanding resources for caregivers. By gathering
with other caregivers and family members of stroke victims, you benefit from
talking about your problems and getting reassurance from the experiences of
others. These support-group meetings may also alert you to valuable infor-
mation or concerns you may not have been aware of.
Enlist the help of others, either in your household or beyond. Adult children
and even teenagers need to know how important it is for them to spend time
helping the stroke survivor — and thereby giving you a needed break. And
don’t neglect your social life! Most stroke patients tend to be less outgoing
during the transition period. This can also isolate the caregiver from previous
friends and limit opportunities to socialize. You need to consider your own
needs in your daily schedule.
Taking care of a stroke victim full-time may be too much for even the most
loving spouse. Asking for professional help may be in the best interests of 
all. But that doesn’t have to mean a nursing home. Daytime care centers may
offer services to the stroke patient while the family member runs necessary
errands, gets out for a lunch with friends, or spends time with children or
grandchildren.
Ongoing Medical Therapy
You’ve had one stroke. You certainly don’t want another. Yet the risk that 
you will have a stroke or a heart problem is very high. Second strokes are 
far more likely to happen in the first few days and weeks after the first stroke.
Doctors know a lot about preventing stroke — many clinical trials have
shown that available drugs and other treatments really work. You need to 
do everything you can to prevent stroke, too. This requires taking your 
prescribed medications and pursuing ongoing medical follow-up with 
stroke experts.
Starting meds: Time is of the essence
The transition from hospital to home can be a particularly critical time. It is
essential to continue the treatment started in the hospital. If you have just
244
Part V: Living with Stroke 

arrived home from the hospital, you should have a list of recommended med-
ications and corresponding prescriptions. If you don’t, track down this infor-
mation immediately. Call the hospital and speak to your doctor or nurse.
Enlist a social worker, a family member, or a pharmacist to help you obtain
this information.
Except in unusual cases, the staff at your doctor’s office does not understand
the urgency of immediate medication. They may suggest you schedule an
appointment and ask you to come back in a week or two. That won’t do. If
your doctor is busy and not an expert in stroke, the importance of continuing
to take your medication may be lost.
It is also important to watch for side effects of new drugs after you get home.
Any new symptoms or discomforts that you experience may be due to med-
ication side effects rather than your stroke. Read package labels so you have
some idea what to look for.
Often, your first medical appointment after returning home may be several
weeks away. I repeat my caution in the previous paragraph because I have
heard so many times the same excuse for not taking medicine. Don’t wait till
later to start taking medications recommended in the hospital. You should fill
prescriptions from the hospital the very first day and not miss a single dose.
The chances are very slim that you don’t need to be taking any medication.
Except in rare circumstances, most stroke patients require some preventive
therapy to reduce the risk of a second stroke. You should probably be taking
medications to control blood pressure and possibly serum lipid levels. You
may need medication to control your diabetes if you have it. Aspirin, war-
farin, or other drugs are usually necessary to help keep your blood from 
clotting too much.
You and your family are pretty much on your own now. You will need to look
out for yourself. A nurse is not going to walk into your bedroom and hand out
medicine three times a day. You must take a proactive role to ensure that you
have the best possible recovery from stroke.
245
Chapter 14: Returning Home: Adapting to a New Life
Birth-control pills and stroke risk
Female stroke sufferers who’ve been taking birth-
control pills or other prescriptions with estrogen
should discuss discontinuing this medication with
their doctors. Estrogen, also common in hormone
replacement therapies for menopause, increases
the risk of all types of stroke.

Monitoring blood pressure changes
If you are taking drugs for blood pressure, now would be a good time to get
one of those blood pressure machines. After you return home from the hospi-
tal, the change in your activity and diet may affect your blood pressure. Your
stroke may also make it harder for you to stop by your drug store to test your
blood pressure. Blood pressure machines — the ones that display the blood
pressure on a digital readout — are affordable these days.
Take your blood pressure and pulse rate every morning and evening at the
same time and in the same place. The reading should stay relatively constant.
You can call your doctor’s office to have the results evaluated. If you get light-
headed when you stand up, the pressure may be too low. Check with a physi-
cian. Keep the records and take them with you to your next appointment.
Watching out for dehydration
For a variety of reasons, stroke sufferers often don’t eat or drink enough.
Perhaps it’s physically difficult for you to hold a fork or raise a glass. Maybe
you’re experiencing loss of appetite due to depression.
But with stroke, dehydration becomes an even greater concern. Here’s why:
The lack of activity following stroke puts you at risk of forming blood clots in
your legs. Most strokes are caused by blood clots. Without enough fluids in
your system, your blood is likely to become thicker and more prone to clot-
ting, not to mention making you more susceptible to infection and other 
disease.
Even if you suffer from a poor appetite, be sure to drink plenty of water!
Even if it sends you to the bathroom more than you want, drink two to three
full glasses of water every day between meals.
How can you tell if you’re drinking enough water? Your urine will be a light
yellow or straw color, rather than dark yellow. This rule works well unless
you are taking vitamins that turn the urine dark.
And don’t skip meals, especially breakfast. It is not known why, but morning
is the most common time for a stroke to start. Why take chances? Drink a full
glass of water when you take your medication before breakfast. And beware:
The coffee or tea you drink with breakfast not only increases your blood
pressure a little, it may actually dehydrate you, as well.
246
Part V: Living with Stroke 

Seeing Your Physician
Did you know that a lot of people stop taking their blood pressure medicine
when they find out the medicine has brought it down to normal? I guess they
don’t realize that they have to keep on taking it for the pressure to stay down.
I know of a Fulbright scholar who stopped taking his statin drug after he was
told that his cholesterol levels had returned to normal. He had a heart attack
and was found to have extremely high levels of fat in his blood several years
later.
I don’t know whether seeing a physician would prevent you from making 
mistakes like these. I do think that having a stroke is a sign that your health is
more precarious, at least for a period of time. I also know that recovery from
stroke can take a year or more. Therefore, monitoring your medical condition
during this time is key to avoiding setbacks and ensuring that you are making
satisfactory progress in your recovery.
Be sure you’ve scheduled an appointment with your doctor soon after your
return from the hospital. And be prepared to schedule visits more frequently
than you would under normal, “nonstroke” conditions. After a stroke, you
should have your risk factors evaluated more often.
You may want to see a stroke specialist in addition to your regular doctor —
especially if your doctor has expressed that he or she is not familiar or com-
fortable with treating stroke symptoms. From the medical system point of
view, it’s a good idea to stick to a doctor who manages and integrates all of
your care. You can be referred to see a stroke specialist once or twice a year.
The quality of the office staff can be as important as the quality of the physi-
cian. If the staff is brusque, uninterested, makes clerical errors, and doesn’t
247
Chapter 14: Returning Home: Adapting to a New Life
Did you smoke before your stroke?
A lot of smokers who were not permitted to smoke
in the hospital are eager to celebrate the return
home with a cigarette. First thing they do after
arriving home — if they haven’t already done so
on the drive home — is light up. Don’t start smok-
ing again. You really don’t want another stroke.
And there is no doubt that using tobacco in any
form at least doubles your chances of stroke.
Stopping smoking rapidly reduces your chances
of a second stroke. Within a year of stopping
smoking, your chances of stroke are equal to a
nonsmoker. You stopped smoking while you were
in the hospital. The hardest part is done. Now just
keep on not smoking. One of the first things you
should consider doing is removing everything
smoking-related — cigarettes, matches, lighters,
and ashtrays — from your home.

return phone calls, try another physician’s office. Often, physicians may have
nurses that help with telephone calls. If you can’t reach a physician, ask to
speak to a nurse. If you still think you are getting the runaround, then one last
resort might be to talk to the office manager. Sometimes it helps if a family
member calls for you.
Checking up on your stroke
Here’s another important reason to schedule that doctor’s appointment soon
after your return home: Critical testing to determine the cause of your stroke
may still be needed if it wasn’t done in the hospital. You may need to check
whether fat deposits called atherosclerosis are slowing blood flow to your
brain. You may need a CT scan or an MRI scan to see how much brain damage
occurred during your stroke. It also may be helpful to know exactly where the
damage is. Your doctor may advise an electrocardiogram (EKG) to determine
whether you have an intermittently irregular heart rhythm — called atrial 
fibrillation — that is an elusive cause of stroke.
In addition to testing for cause of stroke, your physician will monitor your
recovery progress and review other medical conditions that may affect your
risk. Checking blood pressure, drug levels and side effects, surgery scars, and
rehabilitation progress are all part of the doctor’s job. If you need more ther-
apy or different kinds of therapy, the doctor may make recommendations and
arrangements. The physician may even arrange for your driving ability to be
tested.
Bringing up other problems
Although you may be inclined to disregard other health issues not related to
stroke, don’t hesitate to discuss all medical concerns with your doctor. First,
they may indeed be related to your stroke, even if in some indirect way. And,
secondly, if not taken care of, they may have an impact on your stroke.
Are you having problems with sex or incontinence? Mention them. These
conditions can usually be successfully treated. Many of the drugs for blood
pressure can cause impotence in men, and anti-depressants can decrease
interest in sex for men and women. The same drugs and others can affect uri-
nation and bowel movements.
If you’re uncomfortable talking about these issues in front of a nurse or
spouse, ask to speak to the doctor alone. But don’t neglect the problem. It’s
just not necessary for you to suffer if help is available.
248
Part V: Living with Stroke 

Loss of hearing is also another seemingly unrelated problem that could have
a detrimental impact on your stroke condition — if only because you may
miss out on hearing important information or advice from your doctor. If you
suspect you have some hearing loss, ask to have your hearing tested.
The patient’s role in doctor appointments
What is the patient’s responsibility in the doctor-patient dynamic? Keeping
appointments with physicians is a good start! Additionally, be sure to take all
necessary information — including medical records — with you when you go.
Many medical offices simply do not do a good job of this.
Here is a checklist of some of the records and information you might bring to
your appointment:
 Brain scan reports
 Electrocardiogram
 Hospital discharge summary
 Laboratory results
 Blood pressure record
 Accurate, up-to-date list of medications — better yet, the bottles 
themselves
 List of unusual symptoms you may have had
As you undergo further testing, continue to keep track of lab reports and
keep copies of MRI and CT scans, as well as X-rays. If you go to the hospital
for a different reason, keep records of that. You may want to remind any ther-
apists you have seen that you have an appointment and encourage them to
contact your physician with their questions and reports.
Continuing Rehabilitation 
Therapy at Home
Don’t wait to start recommended physical therapy, speech therapy, and occu-
pational therapy. You may feel like you deserve a rest, but don’t take a week
or two off from your exercises, thinking you will start later.
The more you do, and the earlier you do it, the better your recovery 
from stroke.
249
Chapter 14: Returning Home: Adapting to a New Life

You need the therapy recommended to start right away. Chances are, you
already began rehabilitation while in the hospital. Don’t lose momentum! You
may actually be stronger when you come home from the hospital than you
will be after you slack off for a few days and lose the conditioning you got at
the hospital.
You should be taking some kind of therapy if
 You have difficulty speaking or understanding language.
 You have clumsiness or weakness in a hand or arm.
 You have difficulty walking or keeping your balance.
Rehabilitation is so important that it is paid for by most insurance policies or
through Medicare, at least for the first few weeks after stroke. It’s not fun, and
arranging for therapy after returning home may be difficult, but the fact is it is
critical. Your rehab also presents an opportunity for someone else to check
up on your progress.
Rehabilitation’s Catch-22
You will likely be scheduled to return to an outpatient facility for therapy.
Some people don’t go. You can imagine the reasons. For one thing, just get-
ting in the car and driving to an appointment is now a major challenge.
Maybe you shouldn’t even be driving. But here’s the Catch-22: The more you
need therapy, the harder it is to get to it — because your mobility is limited,
because it requires a strong helper to get you in the car, or because your
wheelchair doesn’t fit in the trunk.
Trust me: You’ll be faced with times and circumstances that will discourage
you so much you’ll want to throw in the towel. This is exactly the time when
it’s essential to double your effort! And if you simply can’t do it, then call for
help and make some changes. Rehabilitation gives you more than just the
therapy you need — it gives you the same skills that get you out into the
community as you rebuild your life. It presents you with the tools you need
to travel away from your home and out into your world.
In-home therapy is an option
If you’re not able to find help in getting to your therapy sessions, you may
need to make arrangements for the therapist to come to you — at least for
the first few visits. However, in-home sessions pose problems of expense and
250
Part V: Living with Stroke 

efficiency. The therapist’s time is not well used when he or she is commuting
to and from your home — and you may find you’ll spend a lot of time coordi-
nating, scheduling, and rescheduling appointments.
The important point is that you should not be coming home with the idea
that you are just going to rest and recover. It will slow down your recovery if
you don’t start the treatment you need right away. Continue your therapy,
either at an outpatient facility or in your own home.
Returning to Work
If your stroke was serious enough to put you in the hospital, then it’s proba-
bly a bad idea to go from the hospital one day and back to your job the next.
You may do it with no problem. On the other hand, your stroke can change
you in ways you are not yet aware of, and you probably don’t want to find
that out in front of your boss or co-worker. The psychological and physical
changes after a stroke are often not as apparent to the person with the stroke
as they are to others. Test yourself. Spend some time with your family, make
sure you can read as well as you used to, go up and down the stairs, and
remember phone numbers or names of all the people at work.
Testing the waters slowly
Don’t get me wrong. It is a good idea to get back to work. The movement,
socialization, and discipline of old habits on the job are good for the recover-
ing brain. But it’s better to test how deep and warm the water is before diving
in. Stick a toe in first — or you may find yourself drowning in a flood of work.
You probably don’t want to start too much and then have to back off.
251
Chapter 14: Returning Home: Adapting to a New Life
Range-of-motion therapy
If you have a weak arm or leg, then you’ve
already been taught about the importance of
range-of-motion therapy to avoid contracture.
The muscles in the weak arm or leg will gradu-
ally shorten and tighten if you don’t stretch them
out fully several times (at least three times) per
day. This is the absolute least you should
demand of yourself every day. If you can’t
stretch every weak muscle out, then someone
living with you needs to do it for you. If that’s not
possible, then you should probably be in a nurs-
ing home. Failure to do these range-of-motion
exercises can result in a deformed arm or leg
and decreased ability to walk or use the hand.

Even if you have or soon will fully recover from your stroke, you may fatigue
easily for the first few weeks or months after a brain injury. Consider return-
ing to work on a limited schedule. You may try half days for a week, for exam-
ple. Many patients are surprised how exhausted and tired they become after
the first full day back on the job.
If you are limited in some ways, then you will have to negotiate some changes
at work, either with special furniture or equipment or by a reassignment of
duties. Some employers react differently than others and may be more or less
able to accommodate your needs.
How well others accept your limitations will to a large extent depend on how
well you accept them yourself. What little homily does this bring to mind?
How about “Smile and the whole world smiles with you”?
Accepting job limitations
If the return to work is not going smoothly, you may need to evaluate chang-
ing your job duties and responsibilities. Most employers are willing to meet
someone halfway if they are willing to make the extra effort to change or
learn new skills. A lot of people define who they are by their job. This makes
job change difficult. Employment counselors can work with you and your
employer to adjust to these changes and create a work environment that’s
beneficial to all.
It’s hard for me to say this, but depending on your age, this may be a good
time to retire, especially if you were thinking about retiring before your
stroke. If you had plans for travel — something you really wanted to do after
you retired — then the time to do it may be now, while you can still get
around and have the resources. If it makes you angry to read that, then I apol-
ogize. But if you would really rather be somewhere else while you are work-
ing, then you need to look into this.
You may have to work to survive, but you are different after your stroke and
may be happier in a different type of job. Most people who were employed
before their stroke are not employed a year after their stroke. To a large
extent, this is because most people who have a stroke are older than 60. You
may be set to retire, but have apprehension about giving up the security of a
job. Take a breath and listen to your family and their concerns. Listen to
those you live with. And watch yourself to be sure you are doing what you
should to take care of your stroke. Again, are you taking your medicine every
day? Are you getting to the rehabilitation center if that is recommended?
(You aren’t smoking again are you?) Are you sleeping well and making sched-
uled visits to your physician? Are you getting some exercise? If you are not
doing the things you should, then your job may be getting in the way of your
brain’s recovery from stroke.
252
Part V: Living with Stroke 

Driving
If you were used to driving yourself around before you had your stroke, you
have to face the reality that you might be a risk to yourself and others.
Another reality is that you may not be the best one to decide whether you
should drive. In fact, you may have no doubts that you can drive and do it
well. This could be the truth — in which a formal test should be no problem.
Or it could be a result of the stroke that you don’t recognize your own limita-
tions. This is quite common. Whether you give them the opportunity or not,
your family has a responsibility to you and others to keep you off the road if
you might be dangerous.
I suggest that you not drive until you can pass a professional driving evalua-
tion. Some states provide this through the state licensing agency. In others,
you have to make your own arrangements.
Not driving can isolate you. You will have to depend on your caregiver or
make adjustments to maintain your connections. It’s a lot easier than dealing
with the results of a bad automobile accident that you caused.
Get Organized and Motivated
I asked a nationally known expert in stroke rehabilitation what was important
to make the best possible recovery from stroke. She had one piece of advice
for a successful effort: “Get organized.”
A psychologist I know once worked at a university. It fell to him to teach a
course in study skills for students who had low grades. After a few sessions
with them, it dawned on him that he should test them to see how much they
already knew. He gave them a test and found out that almost all of the bad
students knew what it took to be good students. It wasn’t that they didn’t
know how to be good students. They just didn’t do it.
Finding new ways to get organized
I don’t know how to tell you the way to get yourself organized and to persist
on the rehabilitation effort it will take to get the maximum recovery from
your stroke. But I would guess that you already know how to do it. Writing
down goals and making lists works for some people. Being competitive works
for others. I suppose some people actually enjoy doing things the right way
and doing what is recommended — you know, the people who read the direc-
tions on the soup can.
253
Chapter 14: Returning Home: Adapting to a New Life

On the other hand, stroke can change your personality in subtle ways. You
need to take stock of your new self and find a different approach toward get-
ting the work of rehabilitation done. For starters, get inspired: Read some of
the stories in the Part of Tens at the end of this book. George Frederik Handel
moved to Germany from England and wrote his masterpiece “Messiah” while
he was recovering from his stroke. I don’t know how he found the strength to
do this, but he did. And I’m glad he did.
Minding the basics
Did you take all your medication yesterday? Did you eat all your meals? Did
you drink water between meals? If you have a weak arm or leg, did you do
range-of-motion exercises yesterday? Did you make it to all your scheduled
therapy sessions this week?
If you are having trouble keeping on target, I suggest you go back to the
basics. I apologize for reminding you of what my psychologist friend would
guess you already know. However, it may be worthwhile to jog your memory.
Rehabilitation works like any human enterprise. You are going to be much
more successful if you have goals and lists and schedules of activities that
will help you accomplish these goals. Will this be the time that you get a cal-
endar, a pencil, a notebook, and a few sheets of paper and decide that you are
going to be the good student? After all, this is not a class in geography or
something else you doubt you will ever use. This is your brain. You can’t give
up on your brain.
Write down what you want to accomplish in the rest of your life and what you
need to do to get it done. Having a little more trouble remembering things?
List your medications, the dosage, and how often you take them. Fill out
schedules of doctors’ visits and therapy sessions. Plan your day in the morn-
ing and follow the plan. A stroke may give you the opportunity to simplify
your life in ways that you have thought about but postponed for years. And,
of course, it helps to talk about these things with the people who live with
you or help you.
Forming new habits: Give it 40 days
Hate lists? Hate schedules? Here’s another approach you might take to give
your brain a chance. Not doing things is actually a habit. How about changing
that habit? I’m told you can form a habit of doing things in about 40 days.
Some say more, some say fewer, but 40 days is a good estimate. If you can do
something every day for 40 days, then it becomes a habit, and you don’t need
254
Part V: Living with Stroke 

a list or a schedule or someone to remind you. It’s just something you do. So
pick a thing or two and start to form a habit. I suggest taking pills or doing
range-of-motion exercises, because they are really important from the first
day you return home. The more your stroke has changed you, the more new
habits you will need.
Truth is, you will probably do some of the things, but it will be tough to do all
of them every time. The more you do, the better your physical recovery will
be, the easier you will adapt to your remaining limitations, the better your
relationships with family and friends will be, and the quicker you will adjust
to a fulfilling life after stroke.

When You Can’t Go Home Again
In This Chapter

 Living a new life in a new home
S
ome strokes are so severe that the patient can’t return home. In these
cases, the stroke victim isn’t likely to be in a position to investigate alter-
natives, evaluate nursing homes, or even make the decision that a nursing
home or assisted-living facility is the best choice. So in this chapter espe-
cially, the “you” I am speaking to includes the caretaker or loved one — an
individual who has also suffered from the devastation of stroke.
When a stroke first happens, the medical care system steps in to help. As the
hospitalization reaches the second or third day, that same system applies
pressure to get the stroke patient out of the hospital — whether to an inpa-
tient rehab facility, home, or nursing home or assisted living facility. Perhaps
well before you have adjusted to this unexpected and traumatic event, you
will be encouraged (to put it generously) to find another place for the stroke
victim in short order — whether or not your family is emotionally or finan-
cially ready.
This encouragement is well meant. You will almost always find the hospital
personnel to be concerned for your welfare. They know, however, that few
families are ready to deal with a serious stroke disability. Without some
gentle pressure, most families would delay or postpone making important
decisions.
Whether through the recommendations of the doctors who are attending to
the stroke patient or through the realization that you are ill-equipped to pro-
vide the necessary care at home, a nursing home or assisted living facility is an
option that must be considered whenever a stroke causes significant disability.

In this chapter, I aim to guide you through the difficult process of deciding
whether a care facility is the right choice, gathering the resources to fund
that choice, and finding the right place for your loved one.
Within a matter of days of admission to the hospital, you will receive a clear
message that the hospital wants the patient out as soon as he or she is med-
ically stable. The family must make important decisions rapidly. Rehab?
Home? Nursing facility? Whatever the eventual outcome, at this early point
you should advocate for the most rehabilitation now. Scrutinize your health-
insurance benefits plan and argue for the best and longest coverage possible.
Coming to Grips with Your Situation
“Why can’t we just go home?”
This question often arises from the stroke sufferer, who may be confused,
frustrated, frightened, and desperate for a return to life before stroke. It is an
equally painful moment for family members, who are likely grappling with
similar feelings of fear, confusion, and uncertainty.
Promises and guilt
You may feel bound by a promise made long ago to take care of your loved
one at home if he or she ever became incapacitated. But how could you have
imagined that this would mean assisting with nearly everything, including
bathing, dressing, and using the toilet? Caring for someone with brain injury
is a full-time job — one that would be difficult work for someone who is
young and energetic and head-over-heels in love. If you are now 72 years old
and have your own medical problems, it may well be a psychological and
physical impossibility to take good care of your disabled spouse.
Stroke makes it even harder because in many cases the sufferer is affected in
ways that only a close family member can recognize. Emotions are changed;
personality is affected. Some family members say it’s as if they’re living with a
stranger. The stroke victim may be more difficult to manage — perhaps head-
strong, emotional, or depressed.
Keeping the spirit of your promise
When you promised never to put your spouse in a nursing home, what you
meant was that you wouldn’t just walk away in a time of need. You meant that
your love would be constant and you would care for your spouse in the best
way possible. Truth is, a nursing home or assisted-living facility may be
258
Part V: Living with Stroke 

essential if you are going to live up to what you meant when you made your
promise. Any doctor can tell you about cases in which the lives of both care-
taker and stroke survivor are threatened by the stress of attending to a seri-
ously ill spouse.
Remember when your children promised they would feed the puppy every
day if you would let them keep it? Or how much more difficult having a new
baby in your lives turned out to be than you even suspected — that half the
stress was simply dealing with a being who couldn’t listen to reason or follow
your schedule? Now, imagine that your baby is as big as you and will be with
you for the rest of your life. If you’re dealing with a spouse with brain injury,
you don’t have to imagine.
Nursing home: Often the 
most loving decision
If the stroke victim is severely aphasic (language problems), has difficulty get-
ting out of bed, and suffers from incontinence, poor memory, or dementia,
the safest, most loving place may be a care facility with experienced staff.
Similarly, the amenities of assisted living can maximize the independence of
some people who have less severe disabilities. Nursing homes are expensive
because caring for a disabled stroke patient takes a lot of psychological and
physical effort — beyond the capability of many adults. It concerns me that
too many stroke sufferers are cared for at home because the cost of nursing
home care is so high.
Getting Your Game Plan Together
As I write this book, I try to put myself in the places of the stroke victim and
family members. I keep running into a lot of emotional and philosophical hur-
dles. The resources available for stroke care are limited compared to the
need. A couple’s life savings can be consumed in a few months. The strain
placed on a relationship can be almost unbearable. Adult children find their
lives turned upside down as they confront a new relationship with a parent
who needs their care.
I have struggled with these challenges in my own family. I wonder if I could be
doing better as I balance the needs of my own life, my children’s interests,
and a parent in a nursing home. And like many in this situation, I wrestle with
“if onlys.” If only the illness hadn’t happened. If only there was a cure. If only 
I had known this would happen.
Eventually, though, you and I have to put aside all thoughts about how things
could be or should be and deal with how things are. So for the rest of this
259
Chapter 15: When You Can’t Go Home Again

chapter I will assume that you have realized you can’t change the medical
care system fast enough to meet your needs. You can’t go back and buy
insurance you don’t have now or save money you haven’t saved. Just accept
where you are right now and deal with that. To survive these overwhelming
challenges — and you will survive them — it’s critical to get your game plan
together. Because each situation is so unique, I can’t map out that plan for
you in all its detail. I can only give you some tips and suggest some general
strategies.
Deciding to put a loved one in a nursing home is no small problem. Especially
on top of the overwhelming trauma you’ve just experienced. It is an effort
that you may have to manage on your own — and you can do it.
With a severe disability you have a big problem. The best way to solve a big
problem is to break it down into small problems and solve them in turn. Here’s
how I suggest approaching the problem of where to live after a severe stroke:
 Define your care needs.
 Determine your resources.
 Choose the facility that best meets your needs and resources.
Defining Your Care Needs
Does your loved one need nursing-home care? Evaluations from hospital staff
are helpful in determining this. You want to get a clear understanding about the
brain injury suffered and the likelihood of rehabilitation. After you understand
260
Part V: Living with Stroke 
Hiring a care manager
If you feel incapable of assessing your loved
one’s needs, analyzing your resources, and
deciding on a care facility, then consider hiring
a care manager to help you navigate the
process. A care manager can research your
options, determine what you can afford, help
find financial aid if that’s necessary, and facili-
tate communication among family members.
A good care manager looks for resources and
works with the family to reach a consensus on
what can be done. Care managers are not just
for the wealthy, as they often offer advice that
optimizes limited resources. They can be paid
by the hour and will work with hospital social
workers to find the best options for each family.
A good care manager knows where the system
is flexible and helps you get the most for your
dollar. This is like hiring someone to do your
taxes for you — the service may well pay for
itself. Care managers are not regulated, so be
sure to get one who has good references.

the expectations for the stroke patient, then ask the hard questions: Does
this mean my husband can’t bathe himself? Will I have to feed my wife? Will
my spouse need close attention while I’m at work every day?
Incontinence and inability to eat, walk, or get up from a bed or a chair are just
some of the physical limitations you might anticipate. Depression, anger, and
frustration are behavior problems that predict things won’t go well at home.
Stroke can make a person impossible to manage because of angry outbursts,
refusal to cooperate, or overwhelming despondency.
Once you understand the limitations your family member is likely to experi-
ence, then you want to anticipate which situations you can handle — and
which you can’t. Are you capable of getting your husband in and out of the
shower? Will you be able to prepare meals and feed your wife three times a
day? Are you prepared to attend to the most intimate and personal needs of
your parent?
Sometimes a nursing home is a temporary or transitional alternative before 
a return home. Some stroke sufferers need a little more time to regain their
strength or benefit from additional therapy. A short-term nursing-home stay
may also allow the family to prepare the home for the patient’s return.
It helps to list these situations and rank them in order of your comfort level
with attending to them. You might have a few rankings, ranging from “No
assistance needed” to “Impossible even with my help.” Table 15-1 is one
example of a helpful list and ranking system.

Go over the list of situations in Table 15-1 and consider the four scenarios
offered in the first four columns: First, the stroke patient is capable of this
activity and doesn’t need help. Second, the patient may need help, but you
feel comfortable helping. Third, you know you’d have to help, but would be
very taxing on you. Fourth, you know you couldn’t manage this.
Fill in these boxes with checks, then move to the final two columns and put
an X under “Home” or “Care Facility.” For each row, if you put an X in the “No
Help Needed” or “I Can Help” categories, then place an X under “Home.” If
262
Part V: Living with Stroke 

you checked “Difficult” or “Impossible,” you probably want to put an X under
“Care Facility.”
Tally up the results when you’re done — and you will have a pretty good idea
whether your loved one will be better off in a care facility. A single X in the
last column might be enough to make the decision for you. If you have three
or four Xs under “Care Facility,” there may really be no choice for anyone.
In some situations, the choice may not be that clear. There may be financial
issues (which I address in the next section). The caretaker may also need
money or retirement benefits to survive. Here are some other considerations.
Plan for today’s needs
Don’t make inadequate plans hoping the stroke patient will get significantly
better. Plan for things staying the way they are. Accept the prognosis from
your doctors, nurses, and therapists regarding your loved one’s limitations.
They may be wrong, but they have more experience than you do.
They are not likely to be overstating the problem. Doctors, particularly, may
be overly optimistic. Perhaps this is because they don’t want you to give up
and refuse treatments that will help.
Allow for changing needs
Avoid long-range commitments at first. Stroke disabilities do usually improve
somewhat over time, but stroke patients also suffer brain injuries that may
not become apparent until the patient is out of the hospital. Serious prob-
lems with thinking and controlling emotions can be overlooked or attributed
to being away from home. Patients often have other medical problems that
may get worse after a stroke. Most changes occur in the first months after
leaving the hospital. Year-long commitments to a particular residence or pro-
gram may not be flexible enough to meet your changing needs.
Include caregiver priorities
The patient isn’t the only one disabled by the stroke. The primary caretaker
and the whole family may find their time and energies diverted into coping
with the stroke. It’s like waking up one day and the grocery store is gone.
Either you hire someone who knows how to raise a garden, or you have to
263
Chapter 15: When You Can’t Go Home Again

grow your own food — even if no one ever taught you how. Of course, other
family members may want to help, but the primary caregiver may have other
priorities that mustn’t be neglected. This could be raising children who are
still home, for example, or maintaining your employment. Caregiver priorities
also belong on the list of considerations — and quite high up.
Determining Your Resources
Nursing and assisted-living facilities cost money, ringing up somewhere
between $54,000 and $90,000 a year. And that’s not including medications and
treatments. Don’t waste time pondering choices you don’t have. Wanting to
do something is a lot different then being able to do it. You’ve identified the
critical services you need, and now your goal is to determine your available
resources. This boils down to what you can afford using insurance, disability,
savings, Social Security benefits, Medicare, or other income.
The person who has always managed the family finances may be the person
in the hospital bed. That means you have to go through unfamiliar files and
bank records at home to find all the possible resources. It also means that
you may have to take control of something you have never dealt with before.
Make a list of assets
To the list of care needs you made, add another sheet of paper to your clip-
board and start listing all the financial resources that could fund the patient’s
care. Get it all down — from your insurance benefits to retirement funds to
savings accounts.
The hospital social worker is a valuable source of information regarding
financial possibilities you may not be aware of (see nearby sidebar for more).
A good social worker can usually size things up in a few minutes by looking at
the doctor’s notes and seeing the condition of the patient. Take this as your
starting point. Go over your clipboard’s list of needs with him or her.
You may need to do some homework. Do you understand all the intricacies of
your private insurance? Do you have a long-term care plan that covers nurs-
ing home care? If so, does it cover all costs or only a percentage? Does it stip-
ulate a minimum- or maximum-length stay? Are there other limitations and
criteria? If Medicare is on your list, are you sure you are eligible? Do you
understand what it covers and what you are expected to pay for?
Medicare is a government program that provides health care for individuals
65 and older, as well as for individuals with certain disabilities. But it doesn’t
cover all types of medical services, nor does it cover qualified services at 
264
Part V: Living with Stroke 

100 percent cost. As of this writing, Medicare covers nursing home costs for
20 days, once you pay the deductible (in 2005, the deductible is $912) and if
your case meets certain criteria. For the next 80 days of nursing home stay,
Medicare covers a percentage, but you pay a coinsurance fee. According to
www.medicare.gov, coinsurance is $114 a day in 2005.
When you can’t afford the care you need
If you’re fortunate, your research will reveal that you and your spouse have
the resources to fund the needed care. Perhaps you wisely purchased a long-
term disability policy that offers maximum coverage for nursing-home care.
Maybe you have a very healthy retirement plan that will support your current
lifestyle and care for your spouse as well.
You’re lucky. More often than not, a severe stroke and its outcome can quickly
and easily deplete any and all resources. When you finish evaluating your
financial status, you may find that although you have some resources, you
can’t afford the level of care that you’ve determined is necessary — for as
long as you’re likely to need it. Should you give up, then? Assume you’ll have
to handle the care in your home? Not necessarily. You just have to be more
resourceful.
Managing on your own
The fewer resources you have, the more you must do on your own. If you can’t
afford to hire a care manager (be sure to look into it because with all their
advice they can pay for themselves sometimes), you or someone in the family
will learn how to wade through all the Social Security claims, insurance pro-
grams, and medical bills. You’ll become adept at cajoling, demanding, and
265
Chapter 15: When You Can’t Go Home Again
Social workers are valuable resources
The role of the hospital social worker is to help
families navigate through the complex medical
care system — from assessing what insurance
will cover to finding workable solutions to
finance shortfalls. A good social worker is inti-
mately familiar with the resources available —
from rehab centers to nursing home facilities —
and the best ways to access them.
Hospital social workers are overworked these
days, so you want to maximize the few minutes
you may have with them. Have as much of your
homework done ahead of time — gather all the
information about your loved one’s needs and
the resources you have and provide it for them.
Prepare questions. Take notes. Then go over
your notes at the bedside while your loved one
is asleep or off getting a test. Prepare more
questions. The more answers you can gather
from your social worker before you leave the
hospital, the better. If your social worker is inex-
perienced or unhelpful, ask for another one.
Most hospitals employ more than one.

reading a lot of fine print. On your own means a lot of research, connecting
with other patients, spending hours on the telephone, and making countless
trips to different institutions.
On your own may also mean reducing your expectations from “would likes”
to “must haves.” Where is the best place to invest your limited resources?
Maybe instead of placing your loved one in the nursing home permanently,
you arrange for a few months in the facility until you learn how to take care of
your spouse at home or arrange to have another relative come to help you.
Medicaid is a government program for low-income people. It pays for some
health services, including long-term nursing home care. Medicaid eligibility
and coverage is state-based and varies from state to state. To be eligible for
Medicaid, you basically have to be depleted of all your assets. I hope you
don’t have to consider this sort of help, but be aware that it exists. For more
information about Medicaid, visit the Web site at www.cms.hhs.gov.
Asking for and accepting help
Accept help from anywhere and anyone. I’m not just talking about financial
help, but informational and emotional support as well. You may get financial
advice from a neighbor who is an accountant. Or an adult child has a health-
ier investment portfolio than you’d imagined. Overcome the tendency to
keep the stroke private. Spread the news about the problems you are dealing
with. You will get more help than you expect.
Stroke support groups
Find out about stroke support groups. Going to meetings is good, but even a
phone call can connect you with other stroke caretakers who have faced sim-
ilar challenges. You can get advice about nursing homes, special programs in
your city or state, and tips about what to do and how not to waste time or
money. Social workers or nurse care managers can connect you to stroke
support groups.
266
Part V: Living with Stroke 
An inadequate system
The realities of chronic long-term care for the
disabled are grim indeed. Medical insurance
and social-welfare programs do not provide
enough resources to care for all those whose
brains are injured by stroke. The programs
cannot always accommodate those with unusu-
ally severe financial or medical problems.
To complicate matters further, many eligibility
standards for such programs emphasize the
physical impairments of mobility and employa-
bility. In stroke, a major portion of the disability
involves the patient’s inability to communicate,
think, and control emotions. Many stroke
patients develop a form of dementia (see
Chapter 7). These “mental” changes often do
not qualify for coverage or care in a nursing
home or assisted living facility.

Making the best of a bad situation
Here’s the bottom line: The medical care system struggles to spread a few
resources among a huge number of people with needs far beyond its capability.
The last thing you as family members want to do is blame each other for the
inadequacies of the system. That only adds to the difficulties. It’s not you — it’s
the system. You have to look out for yourselves. My best advice is to do all
you can to understand the system in all its complexity so that you can take
advantage of every possible bit of help.
And having learned first-hand of this really difficult situation that many if not
most of us will face in our lifetime, you might ask, “Isn’t it our responsibility
to demand that our society do a better, fairer job of addressing this problem
in the future?” I think you might be right. Getting involved in healthcare reform
can help you feel good that you are helping better things for everyone.
Considering Nursing-Home Care
A skilled nursing facility offers complete care. Such places are set up to
handle patients who are bedridden and require 24-hour assistance. Skilled
nursing facilities are carefully regulated by the states. Many are certified for
Medicare and Medicaid.
Whether you’re anticipating a short stay or a permanent placement in a nurs-
ing home, the search for the best facility is important. The care and well-
being of a loved one is at stake, and there are many factors to consider —
from location to cost to quality of the professionals who work there.
Visit any nursing home you are considering. For an apples-to-apples compari-
son, it’s important to gather the same information about each nursing home. I
like lists (can’t you tell?). Make a list of the factors you are comparing: cost,
staffing, food, location, and the like. Take your list with you. And ask lots of
questions of the staff persons you meet. Don’t be shy — they’re not going to
volunteer their shortcomings.
Investigating costs
The cost of nursing-home care runs about $150 to $250 dollars a day. That’s
$4,500 to $7,500 per month. That doesn’t include the cost of medications,
which are added to the bill. There are different cost levels depending on the
work required for the nurses and aides. Check whether you’re locked into a
minimum stay. Also, verify whether the facilities are Medicare or Medicaid
certified if that’s important to your needs.
267
Chapter 15: When You Can’t Go Home Again

Location, location, location
Choosing a nursing home that is accessible to family is important. For the
stroke patient who’s lived alone and far from family, it may mean moving to
another city or state to be near children who can visit regularly. For others, 
it may mean selecting a facility that is within a short drive of a spouse for
daily visits.
Also, keep in mind that the stroke patient may be back in the hospital or
emergency room more than once or twice a year. In that case, you’ll also want
to consider the distance between the nursing home and a preferred hospital.
And if you plan to retain a particular stroke specialist and anticipate the need
for frequent office visits, then proximity to the doctor’s office is a considera-
tion. (See if your specialist works with a particular nursing home, possibly
even making “house calls” to that facility.)
Meeting the medical and professional staff
Ask how often the nursing-home doctor sees the patients. Find out that
physician’s specialty. If you can, try to meet the doctor. Ask families of
patients about the doctor. How easy is it for the family to meet with the
doctor?
Nurses are also a critical consideration. You absolutely must talk to someone
on the nursing staff during your exploratory process. A stroke patient is
bound to have a number of medical problems. It’s a given that doctor visits
will be much less frequent than contact with nurses — so you want the most
knowledgeable nurses possible on staff. If different nurses are on shift every
day, it becomes very hard to monitor changes in a patient’s condition. (For
example, they may not recognize that a patient has had a second stroke if
they haven’t been on shift for the past week.) Are the nurses trained in the
needs of stroke patients? Do they know the importance of range-of-motion
exercises needed to keep paralyzed limbs flexible and braces to increase
mobility and prevent muscle atrophy?
Some stroke patients require regular physical therapy. Find out if physical
and occupational therapies are part of the program. Ask about additional
cost. Meet with the therapists on staff if you can.
Don’t overlook the nonmedical staff at the nursing homes. The aides and
assistants who attend to the residents play an important role in their welfare.
Staffing is a difficult problem for most facilities. The for-profit nursing homes
tend to have tighter management but may hire less qualified aides or be
understaffed.
268
Part V: Living with Stroke 

Be sure to meet with or at least observe the aides and support staff as they
interact with patients. Do they seem caring, compassionate, and attentive? As
they walk through the halls, do they greet and talk to patients? Do they listen
and show respect? Or do they seem frazzled and irritated?
Sizing up the place
Quality of care is, of course, the most important consideration when choos-
ing the right nursing facility. But other factors carry a lot of weight, too. A
thorough visit to each facility will help you size up the place. Be sure to
investigate the following:
 Food: Institutional food is easy to complain about, but there are different
levels of quality. Check that the menu offers variety — or that it at least
serves choices that the stroke patient finds appetizing. Are there alterna-
tives if the patient has dietary restrictions beyond the basic medical pre-
scriptions? (Are there vegetarian options, for example?) Visit during
mealtime and even taste the food, if you can. Remember, though, you’re
in a nursing home — not an upscale restaurant. Make sure your expecta-
tions are realistic.
 Cleanliness: Scrutinize the hallways and common rooms, the dining
room, the bathrooms. Check out a private room or two. Do floors and
fixtures appear to be scrubbed regularly? Does the facility smell clean?
Do you see maintenance staff emptying trash cans before they overflow?
 Rules: Find out the rules and times for visiting. Can you visit any time,
day or night? Flexibility and a liberal visitation policy may be important
to family members who work or live some distance away. Limited visit-
ing hours could prove unworkable. Ask about regulations on patient
activity, as well. Excessively restrictive policies, such as curfews, bed-
times, dining hours, and more could prove frustrating to a resident with
greater abilities and independence.
 Care-planning meetings: Find out how often care-planning meetings are
held and whether your family members can arrange to attend.
 Complaints: How are problems resolved? Most nursing homes must list
formal complaints and make them available for review.
 The social scene: If the stroke patient’s thinking is fine — and even if it
isn’t — chances are that the social climate will have some importance in
a successful transition to nursing-home life. Are there other stroke
patients at the facility? Are there opportunities that bring residents
together for some social activity — whether simply watching a movie or
gathering for a celebration?
269
Chapter 15: When You Can’t Go Home Again

Getting a second opinion
Before signing on the dotted line, check with your area’s regional support
center of the government Administration on Aging (visit www.aoa.gov to find
how to contact your support center). This agency has an ombudsman office
where you can get help and advice about nursing homes in the area. Call to
find out if there are any specific complaints registered against the facility.
You can also talk to other residents and their families. Ask questions of the
other families you see visiting patients. Often they will sit in a lounge or out-
side in the sun with their family member. Approach them about problems,
the friendliness of the staff, what they would change, and anything else that
seems important to you.
Evaluating Assisted-Living Facilities
Assisted-living facilities go by a number of different names: personal-care
homes, adult homes, retirement residences, and group homes, to name a few.
Such places are for those who can’t live independently but who don’t require
daily nursing care. These facilities may offer help with bathing, dressing,
meals, and housekeeping. They also offer a safe environment for individuals
who are beginning to lose their memory.
Assisted-living centers may offer more than nursing homes in the way of a
social life for their residents, though they still provide nursing care and staff
to help with medication and monitor conditions such as stroke and diabetes.
They may not be as tightly regulated as nursing homes, so there may be
greater disparity in quality of services and facility. A careful inspection is
equally important when considering an assisted-living facility — to be sure
your needs match with their services.
Just as with a nursing home, you want to devote the same careful attention to
the quality of the medical services and the experience of the staff. Compare
feedback from residents and families about their experiences. Examine the
facility for cleanliness. Chat with the staff and observe how they interact with
residents. Visit the dining room. (See previous section on nursing homes for
what to check for.) There are differences.
Cost is still significant
Assisted living is a lot like renting an apartment. The rent varies based on
location and convenience, as well as on the quality of the services. You might
pay $2,500 to $5,000 per month, depending on what you get. It is important to
keep your focus on your prioritized list of needs. One place can cost a lot
more because it has good staff with low turnover and good credentials.
270
Part V: Living with Stroke 

Another may cost more because of the fine-quality furniture and gourmet
food. Medications, medical services, special group outings, and activities
may add to costs. Be sure you understand what is included in the basic fees.
Transportation to appointments
Unlike a nursing home, an assisted-living facility doesn’t provide around-the-
clock medical attention and a 24-hour professional staff. Residents likely have
medical appointments and therapy sessions offsite. A stroke patient will cer-
tainly need to visit doctors and physical therapists regularly. Find out whether
the facility offers a driving service to get residents to appointments or arranges
for therapy sessions on site. Ask about costs for these services — if not, be
sure it’s realistic for a family member to serve as chauffeur.
A community as well as a home
More so than nursing homes, assisted-living facilities promote themselves as
communities. This aspect is more critical to the well-being or recovery of a
stroke patient than the colors of the curtains and the furniture in the lobby. 
A major problem with stroke is depression and withdrawal. An attractive
social program may get the patient to interact with others.
Ask about eating arrangements — they can vary widely. Some facilities pro-
vide small cooking areas where residents can prepare one or more meals per
day. Most provide three meals per day in a dining room — another opportu-
nity for social interaction.
Check out the rules, which can be surprising for those not used to communal
living. In a small community, everyone has to agree to rules of behavior.
Dealing with the bad stuff
Because assisted-living facilities are not closely regulated, it is harder to dis-
cover problems, and resolving them is not as easy. You should at least ask
about the process for resolving complaints and working out ways to meet
special needs that aren’t currently anticipated. This is one thing you should
definitely talk to others at the facility and their family members about.
Life in a New “Home”
Adjusting to life in a nursing home or even an assisted-living facility is a 
challenge. For the stroke survivor, it may mean withdrawal and a dip into
271
Chapter 15: When You Can’t Go Home Again

depression. For the spouse waking up to an empty house every morning, it
may mean feelings of guilt and the burden of daily visits.
It is crucial to make progress toward recovery from stroke during the early
days. It is the rare stroke survivor who actively seeks out treatment and
strives to do more each day. The family member can also play an important
role, serving as advocate for the resident on a daily basis. Try to visit once a
day for at least the first two weeks of your loved one’s stay.
Getting to know the nursing staff
You can assume most good nurses are thinking about quitting. These facili-
ties demand a lot. The nurses are often overworked. The few times you may
see them at the station, they may be catching up on paperwork. When you
visit, find out who is on duty — it may not be the person at the station, but
the individual down the hall.
Understanding the pressures of the nursing staff helps you utilize their skills
and expertise to your loved one’s advantage. Nurses cannot wait hand and
foot on you and your family. They give medications, monitor vital signs, and
test blood glucose in diabetics. They check for bed sores and make sure
patients are eating and drinking. Too many patients and family members
assume that the staff is there to resolve the patient’s dissatisfaction with the
dinner entrée or fix the television reception.
Make it your goal to get to know all of the staff by name — especially the
evening and night staff. For stroke patients, most bad things happen at night
or early in the morning. You want to do everything possible to be sure that
the staff gets to know your loved one so that any changes can be noted.
I recommend taking pictures of the staff with your digital camera. Print them
and tape them on the wall in the patient’s room, writing the staff names on
each. This way you get to know the staff, and it lets them know you think
they are important. While you’re at it, put up pictures of you, the patient, and
family members, too. The staff can use these as conversation starters for an
otherwise withdrawn or uncooperative stroke patient.
Keep two phone numbers with you at all times: the numbers of the nursing
station and the stroke patient’s room. They can save a life. I suggest calling
both of the phones from your cell phone while you are visiting in the nursing
home. That way, you can hear the phones ring, see who answers, and have a
picture in your mind of what is happening when you call from your home or
office. You don’t want the office number that rings in the manager’s suite. You
want the number for the nurse who is on duty during the day and night.
Don’t abuse the nursing station number, though. Until you establish a degree of
comfort with the staff, use it only when you have important medical concerns.
272
Part V: Living with Stroke 

Advocating for the stroke patient
It takes a lot of time and energy to visit a nursing home. Your visit can pro-
duce a number of benefits, though. First, it brightens your loved one’s day.
Second, it can help you to evaluate and improve the care your stroke sur-
vivor is receiving.
Asking the stroke patient what is going on in the nursing home is not the best
approach, however. By communicating that you are expecting problems, you
may create them. Instead, do your “checking up” with the staff. That doesn’t
mean you shouldn’t keep your ears open to any new or unusual problems.
But listen to complaints about the food and the slow response of the staff
patiently, as you would listen to complaints about the weather — something
you really have no control over.
Watch out for bed sores and bruises
You do need to check the patient’s physical condition to be sure there are no
bed sores or serious scrapes or bruises. Look for indications of falls or other
injuries. Ask about anything that seems unusual. However, you have to use
some judgment. Someone who is disabled is naturally more prone to bumps
and falls that can’t always be prevented. And many stroke patients are on
aspirin and therefore bruise more easily.
You may be uncomfortable checking out your loved one’s backside, but insist
and do it regularly. This is especially important in cases of weakness or numb-
ness on one side. A patient may be left sitting in the same position for hours.
With a stroke-numbed side, the individual may not feel the discomfort of
pressure and fail to move or adjust. Pressure sores are the dangerous result.
273
Chapter 15: When You Can’t Go Home Again
When problems arise
Your loved one reports that the nurse didn’t
bring medication on time. Maybe it’s something
more personal — perhaps the patient had an
accident because no one was available to
assist with getting to the bathroom. You’re
upset, of course, and you head for the nurses’
station to find out what’s going on.
Take a deep breath. If you’re angry, wait until
you are calm. You don’t need two strokes in the
family. Then try to talk with that staff member
before you complain to a supervisor. Listen to
the person. I have seen that stroke survivors
can easily get mixed up or perceive the situa-
tion in the entirely wrong way. Even if the com-
plaint is legitimate, you’re unlikely to do your
loved one any service if you scream, yell, and
threaten the nurse in question. Conveying that
you are a reasonable and understanding indi-
vidual who is proactively looking out for your
loved one will go a lot further in establishing the
best care.

Keep tabs on medications and changes
Find out what medications are being given and when. Double-check this with
the information you received at the hospital and confirmed with your physi-
cian. Almost all stroke patients should receive treatment to lower blood pres-
sure. Patients who suffered a white type of stroke (see Chapter 3) should be
on aspirin or an equivalent drug to reduce the risk of blood clots. Blood lipids
should be controlled with medication in many patients.
The nursing-home doctor may have a different approach to stroke prevention
or managing other diseases. This difference may be an improvement in care.
However, you should understand why any changes are made.
If you have medical power of attorney, you can arrange to be notified when-
ever any medical care or medication change is advised.
Vary your visiting time
Time your visits so you can get to know all the staff. If you have a predictable
time to come, the staff will help your stroke survivor get ready. However, an
unexpected visit in the morning or later in the evening may give you more
insight into what is really going on. Also, visiting at different hours keeps the
staff on their toes.
As you get to know the staff, ask them about any problems or things that are
needed. This gives you important information and will keep them alert and
observing, wanting to have something to say the next time you see them.
Monitor therapy
Be sure therapy is being given. Therapists may come in the door, try to inter-
act with the patient, and be rebuffed. Your gentle stroke survivor may be bel-
ligerent and refuse treatment when you are not around. Ask the nurse to read
the notes or call the therapists to be sure they are getting the cooperation
they need. You can see for yourself if lack of therapy is a concern. Check out
weak or paralyzed arms and legs — can you move the joints through their full
range? Do this every time you see the patient. If the muscles tighten up, seri-
ous and painful deformities can develop in a very short time.

aralysis. Speech and language impairment (aphasia). Difficulty walking.
Loss of memory. As if the major insults caused by stroke weren’t enough,
it often results in related challenges for the victim. Challenges that make the
recovery and adjustment processes all the more frustrating.
Take driving, for example. You may have diligently adhered to your physical
therapy and recovered some use of your affected arm and leg. You may now
be able to walk and move unattended — yet when it comes to getting behind
the wheel, you still can’t quite drive safely.
In this chapter, I focus on some of the issues that make recovery or adjust-
ment to life with stroke just a little more of a challenge: painful muscle
spasms and contractures, driving limitations, depression and other psycho-
logical conditions, swallowing difficulties, and incontinence.
Taken together, the problems from a stroke can be frustrating and at times
overwhelming. If you can find the emotional strength to confront them one by
one — the divide and conquer approach — you will discover that they are
indeed conquerable. You can take steps to make a difference and find com-
munity resources for help with even the most difficult challenges.

Muscle Spasticity
Perhaps you’ve seen stroke victims with an arm bent at the elbow, the wrist
pulled in and the fingers forming a clenched fist. Even several months after a
stroke, this may be the normal resting position of the hand. Maybe you are
the survivor of the stroke and you’ve experienced this, or you’ve noticed
your leg bouncing up and down with absolutely no input from you.
Sometimes stroke survivors develop a condition known as muscle spasticity.
It typically kicks in several months after the stroke and affects approximately
20 percent of stroke patients. What happens is this: Muscles that are weak
become tense and contract abnormally, resulting in severe and painful
spasms. Spasticity does not seem to be related to severity of stroke.
With stroke and muscles, you are likely to think more of paralysis than of
overactive muscles. But overactivity is exactly what is happening with spas-
ticity. Here’s what’s going on: Say you’re at the doctor, and she taps your
knee tendon with her hammer. Nerves from the tendon carry electrical sig-
nals to the spinal cord. A normal brain receives these signals and reduces the
speed and strength of the built-in rate of the electrical activity transferred
back to the muscles. So, when you feel the hammer’s tap on your knee (at a
certain location on your tendon), your muscles move your leg in a slow and
smooth manner. With an injury to the brain, your spinal cord is in charge.
Instead of a smooth and controlled kick of your leg, the leg jerks rapidly and
can swing widely. This isn’t a good excuse for kicking your neurologist. You
are likely to become hyper-reflexic in your weak arm and leg.
Injured brain and uncontrolled muscles
If a brain has been damaged by stroke, it may not be communicating cor-
rectly with the muscles. Muscles are still wired into the spinal cord, so there
are still reflexes, but they are not controlled — as before — by the brain.
Instead, signals are immediately transferred to the nerves near the muscles,
and they react vigorously, out of control. In other words, spasticity occurs
when your reflexes get out of control.
It doesn’t take a doctor’s reflex hammer to cause a spastic reaction — the
touch of a hand, a brush against furniture, constant contact with clothing,
even an ingrown toenail or bladder infection can be enough to stimulate the
muscles and cause spasms. The result is increased tension in all muscles,
which inevitably can interfere with walking, hand movement, even talking.
It may surprise you to hear that spasticity is a condition of increased muscle
tone. Now, increased muscle tone — as those of you who work out with
weights appreciate — isn’t bad, even for the stroke survivor. Tight muscles
may keep an injured leg straight and help someone walk.
276
Part V: Living with Stroke 

But the tight muscles associated with spasticity can be painful and disabling.
The sensation of spasticity is not unlike those “charlie horse” spasms that
have sent many of us into painful hopping antics as we try to stretch and
relax the muscle. With spasticity, these painful spasms are more frequent and
harder to control.
An arm that has spasticity will be hard to bend back and forth. Because of
increased muscle tone, the muscles resist any movement. Usually either the
set of muscles that retract a limb or extend it win out over the opposite set,
and without stretching and exercise, the arms, for example, may be pulled
into a flexed, curled-up position. The legs tend to extend straight.
Contractures: When muscles “freeze”
Serious problems can develop when muscles become frozen in position and
can’t be straightened out. These rigid muscles are called contractures. Unless
a person diligently stretches out these tight muscles, sometimes against a lot
of resistance, they may become frozen in unusual postures. A paralyzed hand
tightened into a ball and an elbow and shoulder pulled against the body make
proper hygiene a challenge. The crevices and spaces created by the
deformed postures are difficult to keep clean, leading possibly to infection
and injury to skin and bones. And, obviously, it can be painful.
Recognizing and treating spasticity
Spasticity — uncontrolled, violent muscle movement caused by brain injury —
can cause a host of symptoms for the stroke survivor:
 Stiffened, “frozen” joints that are difficult to move, making even simple
tasks a chore, especially those that require fine movements
 Uncontrollable and painful muscle spasms that can interfere with sleep
 Problems with walking, legs crossing uncontrollably
 Exhaustion from extra effort to walk, move, and undertake most tasks
 Deformed limbs that can restrict movement and create hygiene chal-
lenges, leading to bed sores and serious infections
In the final assessment, spasticity can make someone more dependent. The
inability to control muscles can make everyday activities difficult, from dress-
ing to grooming, from writing to eating. This often means relying on others
and further loss of independent living. Muscle spasms tend to occur at night,
meaning spasticity can interfere with sleeping.
The disability from spasticity creates emotional effects as well. Because it
can affect your appearance and, by constricting throat muscles, even the
277
Chapter 16: Challenges During Recovery

sound of your voice, spasticity may make you more withdrawn and less will-
ing to go out into the world. And that only aggravates the depression that so
often follows stroke.
Treatments for spasticity are numerous, but let me warn you, some are
extreme — and permanent . . . cutting or poisoning nerves so that tense mus-
cles can relax, for example. You certainly don’t want to use those options
until you are sure that the benefits outweigh the risks, and all other treat-
ments have failed. Spasticity treatments work to some extent and can help
free up frozen or painful joints. Perhaps the best solution is a very careful
combination of several treatments designed to fit your needs exactly.
Physical therapy
Physical therapy may be the most important step you can take to overcome
spasticity. It involves working with a physical therapist who knows how to
work your muscles so that they stay loose and controllable. Stretching is crit-
ical to keeping your muscles flexible and at their full length. Physical thera-
pists also work with you to strengthen your muscles. Strength becomes
important as brain function begins to return — when muscle function
returns, you want to be strong enough to do some work.
Therapists teach you important exercises so that you can do them on your
own. You’re unlikely to be in a situation in which you can work with a thera-
pist two or more times a day — the minimum amount of time necessary to
maintain flexibility. You must do this yourself, perhaps with the assistance of
a friend or family member.
Wearing braces or splints
Braces and elastic splints can keep muscle contractures from forming and
help stretch out muscles. One of the most common braces is a footdrop brace
that keeps the ankle flexible by preventing the calf muscle from overpowering
the muscles that bend the ankle. Of course, you have to actually wear the
braces regularly for them to work. Follow the instructions, and you will pre-
vent deformity and pain. If you already suffer from contractures of muscles,
braces can help reverse the deformity.
Controlling the reflexes that start spasms
You can avoid spasms to some extent by avoiding stimuli that set off the
reflexes in the first place. Tight clothing, a bladder infection, or resting a 
limb on a hard edge can start a spasm.
278
Part V: Living with Stroke 

When you have a spasm, see if you can determine what stimulus caused it. If
you can do that, then you can reduce the spasms by eliminating the stimulus
that causes them.
If you get really good, you can use spasticity by setting off muscle spasms at
the right time and using their force to help move yourself. Sometimes you
can shorten muscle spasms by bearing down on the leg or arm that is in
spasm by pushing down with your hand or foot either on the floor or on a
table. Ask your physical therapist for more ideas about using such a tech-
nique in your particular case.
Controlling spasticity with drugs
Four drugs are used to reduce spasticity, each with side effects and draw-
backs that you should consider before taking. Some are very addictive. All
must be followed carefully without changing the dosage or stopping suddenly
without a physician’s guidance. You may need to get blood tests in order to
ensure that you can safely take them.
Baclofen
Baclofen (Liorisal) often helps reduce painful muscle spasms by loosening
muscles so they move more easily and stretch farther. Baclofen has some
side effects: fatigue, drowsiness, mental confusion, and lightheadedness, and
these are further aggravated if you drink alcohol while taking baclofen. With
higher doses, your muscles may seem weaker and too loose and floppy. Work
with your doctor to adjust the dosage so it works best for you.
Don’t stop taking baclofen suddenly — or you may experience serious side
effects, ranging from stiff muscles to increased and more painful spasms —
even seizures.
Diazepam (Valium) and clonazepam (Rivotril)
These are both in an addictive class of drugs called benzodiazepines. They
relax the muscles and they have multiple uses, from relieving anxiety to stop-
ping epileptic seizures. If they work well for you, you may notice fewer
muscle spasms and greater ability to straighten your arm or bend your knee.
Your muscles may feel loose and more relaxed. As a matter of fact, you may
feel pretty relaxed yourself. You may sleep more and experience lower blood
pressure. You may also feel a little “hung over” and unsteady. The muscle
relaxation may come at the expense of a loss of strength.
Sudden withdrawal from either drug can lead to epileptic seizures. Overdoses
can stop you from breathing. And if that’s not enough, they can turn off your
memory. The fact that they can also upset your stomach seems like a minor
279
Chapter 16: Challenges During Recovery

problem at this point. Bottom line: Benzodiazepines are not advised for regu-
lar use and are best considered for special occasions when you may be anx-
ious and you want your muscles to behave.
Dantrolene
Dantrolene changes the way muscles contract. It improves the range of move-
ment of paralyzed muscles and decreases muscle tone, resulting in fewer
painful spasms and looser muscles. Dantrolene also causes dizziness and
drowsiness, not to mention diarrhea and possible injury to the liver. Before
you start dantrolene and while you are taking it, to monitor your liver your
doctor will undoubtedly recommend blood tests before and during usage.
Tizanidine
Tizanidine is the new kid on the block. This medication appears to reduce
muscle spasms while not weakening the muscles. Side effects include dry
mouth, drowsiness, low blood pressure, and possible liver injury. Like dantro-
lene, this drug requires blood testing to protect your liver in case you should
be susceptible to injury. Some people have reported hallucinations with
tizanidine.
Botox
Muscles contorted by spasticity can be temporarily paralyzed for a few
months by injecting them with botulinum toxin, better known as botox. The
result is a muscle that can’t contract at all, and the risk is that your muscle
will be weaker, leaving you more disabled. Fortunately, the effects of a botox
injection are not permanent, although they can shut down a muscle for sev-
eral months. During those months, the muscle can shrivel from lack of use,
and once the botox wears off, you may have to rehabilitate the muscle before
it is useful again. Botox is best used in one or two small muscles that cause
you a lot of pain or interfere with your recovery from stroke.
Surgery: Cutting and fusing
After years of spasticity without any significant improvement, you may have
to resort to surgical procedures such as cutting tendons and fusing joints.
Surgical procedures are usually irreversible and may have good or bad results.
You need to be confident that the good results will outweigh the bad. Different
surgeons approach the problems differently. Neurosurgeons may recommend
destroying nerve cells in the spinal cord that contribute to spasticity, whereas
others may take aim directly at the muscles and joints. These procedures are
280
Part V: Living with Stroke 

not done that often, and there is little established proof of their effectiveness
or long-term benefits.
For the treatment of a neurological problem, I highly recommend that you get
a consultation with a neurologist before you go ahead with any procedure.
Since there are many different ways surgeons can treat a problem, you may
also want to consult with someone other than a surgeon. A neurologist can
give you independent advice on whether surgery is worthwhile. I also suggest
that you talk to patients who had the surgery several years before. Be careful.
Surgeons have good intentions, good training, and good reason to recom-
mend surgery as the right thing for you. But they don’t have the data to
prove their claims in this case, and you need to be aware of that. Have the
courage to seek other opinions, especially from your neurologist.
Depression and Other 
Psychological Changes
After a stroke, your brain is different. And because your personality, emo-
tions, and thoughts are wrapped up inside it, they may be different, too. The
stroke may have affected who you are and the way you behave. One of the
most common outcomes of stroke is increased emotionality. Sometimes it is
revealed with excessive laughing, but more often negative emotions such as
sadness and anger predominate.
The change in who you are may not be apparent to you, the stroke survivor.
In fact, you might not even be interested in whether you have changed — you
may just want to be sure breakfast is on the table when you are hungry. Lack
of interest in the social aspects of life is another common outcome of stroke.
Sometimes the disinterest you show can be painful to others who are used to
your participation and interest in their lives.
The spark, the wit, the special characteristics that made you you may be
gone. Others who love you may be searching for the old you, and the new
you may not even be aware of what these people expect and hope to see.
This can lead to some unhappy situations, particularly if your stroke has
made it more difficult for you to control your frustration and anger.
It is useful to know that some of these changes are worse in the first few
months after a stroke and that with some encouragement, old patterns of
behavior may return to a limited extent. Don’t give up too soon.
281
Chapter 16: Challenges During Recovery

Personality changes and more
It’s not just your personality and interest that may be affected. After a stroke,
you may not do as good a job of planning and looking out for yourself. You
may have trouble inhibiting some of your impulses if the cerebral cortex, the
part of the brain that controls such impulses, has been partially destroyed.
The impulsiveness that makes you more emotional can also make you less
likely to spend the time and thought needed to make a good decision.
This is not always as bad as it sounds. I have heard wives say that they like
their husbands better after a stroke because they are more relaxed and easy-
going. Children have reported that their mother had a better sense of humor
and was warmer and more affectionate after stroke. Nevertheless, be aware
that your thinking may not be as clear as you believe — you may want to
seek the advice of others when making decisions more so than in the past.
And let’s be completely honest here: Once you’ve had one stroke you may
have plenty of life left, but it is still time to start planning to turn some things
over to your spouse or the next generation. Maybe you have already taken
care of these things. That would be great. But you may not be as sharp and
insightful after a stroke as you were before, and you may not know it.
Depression: Hiding behind other emotions
The matter gets even more confused by the high incidence of depression
after a stroke. You can’t really tell how well you are thinking and planning and
controlling your emotions after a stroke until you have taken care of any
depression that may be present. Depression can make you more emotional,
more impulsive, and less apt to plan well and analyze problems. Again, you
may not be aware you are depressed.
I have heard people say, “Of course I’m depressed, I was just disabled by a
stroke. Do you expect me to be happy?” My answer is: “Yes.” After a reason-
able period of adjustment, most people recover their good spirits and get on
with an admittedly more limited life. If they don’t, one possible reason is
depression. Like all depression, it can hide beneath anger and social with-
drawal. Usually someone else points out that a stroke patient seems
depressed. But there’s no reason that you can’t just say, “I feel depressed.”
Once it’s out in the open, depression is relatively easy to deal with.
Counseling and antidepressants are two very effective treatments.
Testing for depression
How do you solve these difficult problems where you can’t even see the dif-
ference in yourself or know for sure whether you are depressed? The ideal
282
Part V: Living with Stroke 

solution is to have full neuropsychological and psychiatric evaluations.
These are not as expensive as MRI or CT scans and they can tell relevant
information about yourself. Just like blood tests for diabetes, tests can mea-
sure depression. It may not seem as accurate as some chemical test done on
your blood, but the results are very consistent and help predict how some-
one will progress in the future. Tests can also give a physician insight into the
best possible approaches for dealing with a stroke survivor’s problems.
Will you be proven mentally incompetent and taken away to a nursing home
if you let someone give you a psychological test? Not unless you were already
bound in that direction. It’s not unusual for the results to help family mem-
bers recognize that the old man isn’t as bad off as they thought! With a little
treatment, he might begin to show some of his old spark for life.
And you don’t have to worry that the whole world will know about your
mental state. Test results, as in other medical matters, are kept private. The
results of the testing should be confirmed by the impressions of the neuro-
psychologist or psychiatrist. Otherwise, further testing or evaluation may be
recommended to understand the results. Just like a cholesterol test, some
preparations help ensure sound results from the evaluation. Get a good
night’s sleep and avoid taking the tests if there are specific and acute stres-
sors in your life at that moment — so that you can get the most accurate
assessment. Nobody thinks psychological tests are the only deciding factor.
Many doctors trust their intuition more than tests and will change their clini-
cal diagnosis only if there is clear supporting evidence.
In addition to tests for depression, I suggest some tests to pin down some of
the more practical problems that come from stroke and may add to your
depression. These include tests of manual dexterity, decision making, lan-
guage, memory, and your ability to recognize different objects that you see.
In addition, it would be helpful to have your eyesight and hearing tested.
Stroke can affect your vision without any obvious difference to you. If you
were hard of hearing before your stroke, it may be more difficult for your
stroke-stressed brain to make the extra effort it takes to understand conver-
sation. Hearing aids that you didn’t really need before your stroke can make a
significant difference after your stroke.
Treatment often leads to happy outcomes
Once you identify depression, you can take action to treat it. And the good
news is, depression is one of the most treatable outcomes of stroke! If you
were struggling with poor hearing or poor vision, you’d certainly take mea-
sures to correct these problems — getting a hearing aid or glasses. Likewise,
depression is a medical condition that ought to be treated.
Too often, individuals self-treat depression — with alcohol, sleeping pills,
withdrawal, and other means that are not only ineffective, but may worsen
283
Chapter 16: Challenges During Recovery

the problem. Many are resistant to taking antidepressants — for various rea-
sons. But drugs like Prozac and other SSRIs have been in use for more than 20
years. They are not addictive and do not cause you to hallucinate or act silly.
Millions of depressed people have taken them and gained more productive and
happy lives. I hesitate to mention a specific medication because there are so
many. For someone who is older or has brain injury, the general principle is to
start with low doses and slowly increase dosage until there is a good response.
The bottom line is that you have a lot to gain from a psychological evaluation
after a stroke. Physical and occupational therapy help you handle certain prob-
lems caused by stroke. Why not undertake therapy for the rest of your stroke-
injured brain, as well? Going with your spouse or family to a psychiatrist isn’t
unreasonable, particularly if you have had a change of personality — even if
you aren’t depressed, your spouse may be.
Adapting to Driving Limitations
How would you feel about heading out into traffic knowing that someone
backing out of his driveway couldn’t connect the sound of your honk with its
message? Or that the woman at the stoplight didn’t have the spatial cognition
to make a left turn from a multilane intersection? Or the man in the SUV no
longer understood what an octagonal red sign stood for? If you’ve had a
stroke, one of these drivers could be you!
284
Part V: Living with Stroke 
Reading the signs
Whether you have doubts about your driving
ability after stroke — or you’re confident that
you are completely competent behind the
wheel, please stop to consider these warning
signs that you may need to hand in the car keys:
You feel afraid while driving.
Passengers act afraid while you are driving.
You’ve had several near-miss accidents.
You’ve been finding dents and scrapes on your
car and property.
You have difficulty getting on and off highway
entrances and exits.
You are the object of frequent honking.
Friends or relatives avoid a ride with you.
You get lost easily.
You find yourself stopping at green lights (my
personal favorite).
You drift into other lanes (very common in stroke
patients).

Driving may be your means to socialize and work, a necessity for acquiring
food and clothing, and a connection to your family. It’s a cherished privilege
for many who value the independence it affords. But if you’ve suffered a
stroke, the damaged parts of your brain may affect your ability to drive —
even if you appear to have recovered and are successfully functioning at
home and work. Most seriously, you may have experienced damage that pre-
vents you from even recognizing that you have problems driving! I hope it is
obvious to you, however, that you don’t want to drive unless you are undeni-
ably capable and don’t pose a risk to yourself or others by doing so.
Here’s my advice about driving after you’ve had a stroke: Don’t drive — no
matter how minor your stroke — until a physician has thoroughly checked
you out and determined that you still have the ability to drive safely. You can
appear and behave completely normal to most people and still have disabili-
ties that make you a danger to yourself and others on the road.
Getting evaluated for driving
Two concerns should stop you from getting behind the wheel until you’ve
been evaluated: The first is whether you are likely to have a stroke while you
are driving. If you still have transient symptoms of stroke even as little as
once a day, you need to see your doctor — but you also need someone else
to drive you there. You don’t belong behind the wheel if another stroke is
likely to occur while you’re there.
The second problem is the existing brain injury caused by your stroke. Some
changes are obvious. If you are paralyzed on your right side, you probably
can’t summon up the physical effort to drive without special equipment, and
may not even be capable then. You may also have subtle but critical impair-
ments that affect your driving. Your ability to make quick decisions, react to
sudden changes, and concentrate on the driving task can all be severely lim-
ited by stroke. These limitations may not be obvious to you. Sometimes well-
intentioned caretakers know there are problems with your driving but don’t
say anything because they don’t want to discourage you.
When it comes to driving after a stroke, no laws require you to be tested or to
ensure that you haven’t lost important brain function necessary for the high
levels of coordination needed for driving. If you are older, the system may
catch you because older drivers are required to have more frequent driving
tests in some states. In other cases, you may be free to drive even when it is
obvious to you or others that you are a road risk.
285
Chapter 16: Challenges During Recovery

Because no laws require stroke victims to prove their driving skills, there
isn’t an official test that you can take to know you’re “safe.” The best course
is to talk to your occupational therapist who may be able to recommend a
road test that will identify problems.
Following are Web sites for some potentially helpful organizations. AARP and
AAA provide online driving tests, although most are directed at the older driver
rather than the disabled stroke patient. Find an occupational therapist who will
assess your driving skills and help with your rehabilitation as necessary.

Identifying driving alternatives
If your endeavors to assess your driving skills prove that you are not fit to sit
behind the wheel, then turn in your keys and start solving your transporta-
tion problems. Of course, you may be lucky enough to have a caretaker who
can drive. Otherwise, you may have to call on children, family, friends, and
volunteer groups to help get you around. Some local groups may be able to
help you with transportation. You will probably have the best luck if you
explore the organizations you are already associated with, including your
community, place of worship, or local government.
Finding yourself “grounded” can threaten your stroke recovery if you don’t
take action to get out in the world. If you are completely isolated and alone,
consider moving to a community where an automobile is not required for
everything you do. If you are in a supportive community, the increased inter-
action that getting yourself around requires is probably healthy and will help
prevent the depression and withdrawal that often accompany stroke.
Stroke can impair your driving in ways that are not readily apparent to you or
your caretaker. By being tested and trained to drive with your disability, you
reduce the risk of a serious automobile accident. Occupational therapists can
evaluate your driving — as well as vision, hearing, reaction time, and concen-
tration — and provide appropriate training to increase your driving safety. In
286
Part V: Living with Stroke 

some cases, everyone concerned will be relieved if you just face reality and
turn in your keys. Finding alternatives for transportation can actually increase
your contact with other people and speed your recovery from stroke.
Dealing with Incontinence
Incontinence — fecal or urinary, occasional or frequent — is a real problem
for 10 to 40 percent of stroke patients. For a number of reasons, stroke
patients may lose the ability to control their bladders or bowels. Incontinence
happens when you can’t get the signal to your bladder or bowel to wait a bit
until you get to the toilet. Or, even if you do have what would normally be ade-
quate control, your stroke has decreased your ability to get to a toilet. In most
cases it is a little bit of both — you have trouble getting to a toilet and your
brain doesn’t have the ability to control strong urges. Treatment of both fecal
and urinary incontinence involves taking action before the signal to go gets
too strong. That way you have more time to get yourself to the toilet and you
don’t need as much effort from your brain to keep things under control.
Incontinence is more common with severe stroke. Problems with both types
of incontinence tend to clear up within three months of the stroke. But when
they don’t, serious, longstanding problems are often reasons for deciding to
admit someone to a nursing home. Even the most dedicated caretaker cannot

Discovering a “blind spot” the hard way
Upon stopping at a routine fender bender, a
policeman found that the 65-year-old man who
apparently ran into a parked car was confused
and claimed he hadn’t seen the car. Another
driver who saw the accident told the policeman
that the man had been driving far to the right
side for a block or more before hitting the car. He
had not been weaving or changing lanes errati-
cally. “It was like he just didn’t see the parked
car.” The policeman called a tow truck and
offered to drive the man home. The man didn’t
mention that he had had a slight stroke a month
ago and this was his first time back on the road.
Because he was concerned, he had his wife
drive him to an ophthalmologist appointment.
The ophthalmologist found damage to his
peripheral vision on his right side — a “blind
spot.” The doctor explained how stroke can
affect vision and that he may not be aware of
the loss.
The ophthalmologist advised the man to stop
driving for the time being and seek out an expert
on driving for the visually impaired. The doctor
said he doubted, however, that the man would
ever be able to drive safely unless his vision
was corrected. He asked the man to return for
more testing in three months.

maintain standards of hygiene if your mobility is limited and you remain
incontinent for an extended time.
Certainly, incontinence is likely to prevent you from being sent home from
the hospital with a family caretaker. If you are incontinent after your stroke,
there’s a possibility you may have had problems with incontinence before
your stroke, but could handle them yourself. The disability from your stroke
may not have caused your incontinence — but it may reduce your ability to
cope with the problem.
Mentioning the unmentionable: 
Fecal incontinence
Why not tackle the tough things first? We all dread losing control of our
bowels more than our bladders. I’m sure it comes as no surprise that one of
the biggest problems you’re bound to face with fecal incontinence is the diffi-
culty in talking about it and seeking help. To give in to your modesty is possi-
bly to fail to find out some really useful information — and a solution to an
embarrassing problem.
I’ve got some good news, though. Once you swallow your pride and disclose
your condition to a professional, you’ll discover that to a great extent, fecal
incontinence can be reduced and controlled. But first, know that much of the
fecal incontinence due to your brain injury usually clears up in a few weeks.
While other stroke symptoms continue to improve, fecal incontinence can
actually worsen even though it’s potentially treatable. Mentioning the unmen-
tionable is a good idea because you can learn about potential treatments and
effective ways to deal with the problem.
The part of the brain associated with bladder and bowel control is your
frontal lobes, the same area that controls your emotions. Another area associ-
ated with incontinence is in the right side of the brain above your ear. If you
have brain injury here, you have trouble knowing that you are disabled. You
are unaware of problems moving your left arm or left leg and tend to deny
knowledge of any problem if you are asked. This failure to respond to normal
stimuli may be part of incontinence.
How common is it?
Like most medical conditions, when you start talking about fecal inconti-
nence, you find it’s more common than you might have suspected. A couple
of studies have indicated that fecal incontinence, either frequent or occa-
sional, occurred in about 30 percent of stroke patients in the first seven to
ten days after stroke. This improved to only 10 percent at three months to a
year. There was a slight increase to 15 percent by three years. It is most
common in stroke patients who have some degree of dementia.
288
Part V: Living with Stroke 

Regaining bowel control
Although some of the steps for overcoming incontinence are fairly basic, you
are likely to optimize your success if you get professional guidance. Not all
methods work for all stroke patients, and it takes some experience to know
what will work best for you and your situation. There are visiting nurses who
specialize in this problem, national associations that have volunteers, and
doctors who take the problem very seriously. And you needn’t worry — none
of them drive up to your house in white trucks labeled “Incontinence, Inc.”
Four fundamental approaches will help you improve or regain control of 
your bowels:
 Watch what you eat and drink: Your diet may be having an effect on
your incontinence issues. Your diet may make you constipated, which,
as you’ll read below, leads to a lot of urgency and incontinence. A low-
fiber diet and dehydration tend to make you constipated. Eat plenty of
fiber and drink lots of water.
 Avoid constipation: The link between fecal incontinence and constipa-
tion may seem surprising, but when you don’t have regular bowel move-
ments, liquid stool begins to leak out. Don’t postpone going to the toilet
when you need to. For the stroke patient, constipation may be caused by
medication you are on that may also slow colon activity. The medical
term for such drugs is anticholinergic. Some antidepressants, medica-
tions that prevent nausea and dizziness, and some drugs to ease anxiety
and help you control your emotions might be anticholinergic. Diuretics
used to treat heart failure and high blood pressure can also cause con-
stipation. Take your complete list of medications to your physician to
see whether any have these effects.
 Address problems of mobility: Poor mobility can result in fecal inconti-
nence. It may simply be too hard to get to the bathroom or bedside com-
mode in time. If you have trouble communicating or recognizing that you
have to move your bowels, then of course you can’t get the help you need
to get to a toilet. A program of physical therapy may help. A refresher
course for you and your caretaker may improve your mobility. In addition,
some rearrangement of furniture or new equipment may be helpful.
 Bowel training: By taking yourself to the toilet to empty your bowels on
a regular basis, you can prevent your bowels from emptying when you
don’t want them to. Initially, this training program has you on the toilet
quite frequently. Then, as you succeed in being continent, you increase
the time between trips to the toilet. Like mental weight-lifting, this grad-
ually increases your brain’s ability to control your bowel movements.
Your fecal incontinence may be aggravated by another disability caused by
stroke. These disabilities can make it difficult for you to get to the toilet or to
communicate your need for assistance to others. Measures outlined in the rest
of the book that enhance stroke recovery may also help with fecal incontinence.
289
Chapter 16: Challenges During Recovery

Particularly important are good nutrition to maintain strength, good vision
and hearing, relief of pain by keeping muscles flexible, good communication,
and treating depression and anxiety.
If you are noticing that incontinence is getting worse, it is probably a sign of a
solvable problem. You may have lost some of your muscle conditioning, you
may be losing ground in your mobility, or you may have a bladder infection.
Consult your doctor or an expert about your particular case.
Nursing home solution
One thing is for sure, if you and your caretaker cannot handle the problem
well, poor hygiene rapidly leads to other major health problems. You will
likely end up back in the hospital or in a nursing home. Fecal incontinence is
also a serious burden for a caretaker, greatly increasing the chances of
depression and physical exhaustion. If you can’t get the problem resolved
fairly quickly, a temporary or permanent move to a nursing home has to be
considered sooner rather than later.
Overcoming urinary incontinence
Urinary incontinence following a stroke is more common than fecal inconti-
nence. Some researchers report that 40 percent of stroke patients have occa-
sional or frequent urinary incontinence at seven to ten days after their
stroke, 19 percent at three months, and 15 percent at two years.
The front lobes of the brain control the bladder. When they are injured by
stroke, you lose awareness of your bladder function. The bladder still func-
tions, but it operates in an automatic mode managed by your spinal cord,
which doesn’t care where you are or what you are doing when it empties
your bladder. Urinary incontinence related to stroke-caused brain injury usu-
ally clears on its own in the first month after the stroke. If the incontinence
persists, then you’ve got to investigate whether something else in addition to
brain injury is going on.
First, check whether you have a bladder infection. Usually a urine test does
the trick. Antibiotics may treat both the infection and the incontinence. If
your problem isn’t due to a bladder infection, you still might have other blad-
der problems, such as side effects from medications. An evaluation by a urol-
ogist is worthwhile at this point. Take a list of your medications. If the
urologist finds that bladder function is normal, ask about medications that
could be used to help you control your bladder. There are several and they
may be effective for you. One may temporarily slow down your urine produc-
tion so you can make it through the night. Another may increase the tone of
the muscles that control your bladder.
In a bladder training program, you take yourself to the bathroom on a fre-
quent basis, say every hour until you stop being incontinent. Then, as you
290
Part V: Living with Stroke 

gain control for a short interval, you increase the time between trips to the
toilet, building bladder muscle strength and re-teaching your brain to take
control. By taking control of your bladder’s schedule, your brain and bladder
are able to re-learn how to keep you dry.
The National Association for Continence (www.nafc.org) has some good
information on its Web site. You can also check around for a local nurse spe-
cialist continence advisor. And there are products on the market, such as
incontinence pads and pants, that can go a long way toward limiting the
inconvenience of incontinence. Some find a laundry service to be invaluable.
For men, a catheter can work for some. Not for the long term, but it can get
you through long car or plane rides. In men previously able to cope with the
problems of an enlarged prostate gland, a stroke makes things more difficult.
Again, a urologist’s evaluation can be important here.
Sometimes a bladder catheter that has been in place for a long time can cause
urinary incontinence. Since they don’t have to work when a catheter is in
place, the bladder muscles that control urination become weak. When the
catheter is finally removed, the muscles can’t work and you become inconti-
nent. Bladder training works well in this case, because the solution is simply
to get your bladder muscles back in good shape.
If you can’t get your urinary incontinence under control, the constant wet-
ness and skin irritation can lead to serious problems. Repeated bladder infec-
tions, skin breakdown and ulcers, and skin infections can result. In addition,
it is a great deal of physical and emotional work for your caretaker. If you
have other serious disabilities, it may just be too much for you and your care-
taker to handle on your own. A nursing home might be the best solution.
Swallowing Difficulties
A week after a stroke, about 10 percent of stroke patients choke when eating.
Approximately 30 percent experience abnormal swallowing. This adds up to
40 percent of stroke patients with an increased rate of death, due in part to
pneumonia from food that is inhaled into the lungs. Signs of trouble:
 Choking or coughing while eating
 Slow chewing and swallowing
 Food stuck in mouth
 Chest congestion
 Gurgle-like sound to the voice
291
Chapter 16: Challenges During Recovery

If these are problems after a stroke, some of the muscles controlling your
swallowing, breathing, and chewing may have been affected. If you are having
swallowing difficulties, find treatments and make diet changes in order to pre-
vent life-threatening results. It is important to act quickly if you have swallow-
ing problems. Notify your doctor immediately.
A speech therapist can determine possible causes of the problem. Treatments
include teaching throat muscle-strengthening exercises and different head and
neck positions that make it easier to swallow. More serious problems may
require special food preparation or even a feeding tube until the throat recov-
ers strength. If you have problems swallowing, you may also lose weight and
become dehydrated. Long-term feeding tubes occur in rare cases, usually
when other problems are associated with feeding. This is a complex medical
decision and requires communication between multiple doctors.

Taking Care of Family
In This Chapter
 Recognizing how stroke affects all families
 Admitting when the family needs help
 Taking care of the caregiver
 Pulling together rather than pulling apart
 Setting important priorities
T
hroughout this book, I’ve emphasized that stroke affects everyone in
your family. In this chapter, it is the key message. I devote an entire chap-
ter to the topic because family plays such a pivotal role in the recovery and
adjustment of the stroke survivor. Certainly, the relationship between the
patient and the caregivers is dynamic and symbiotic. A difficult stroke patient
can cause a family member to become ill, stressed, and incapacitated. And a
poorly functioning caregiver can result in problems for the stroke survivor.
It is critical, in my view, to take good care of the family — so the family can
take good care of the stroke patient. This chapter is meant to help the stroke
survivor see “life after stroke” from the perspective of the family — whether
it’s a devoted spouse who has been by your side throughout the ordeal or
adult children who may live far away and are now making changes in their
lives to care for you.
If you are one of the lucky 35 percent of stroke patients who return home
with little or no disability, you can take your stroke as a wake-up call. A time
to make lifestyle changes to reduce your chances of future stroke. A time to
take steps to provide for yourself and your family, in case you don’t avoid
another stroke. A time to get your life in order. Yes, time to think about
uncomfortable subjects such as wills and power of attorney and DNR (do not
resuscitate). Your family should have as little to worry about as possible.
And if you have found yourself more than a little debilitated by your stroke
and are beginning your journey toward recovery and adaptation to your limi-
tations, these things are more important than ever. This chapter helps you
understand the stress and pressure that your family is experiencing as they
travel this difficult road with you. I explore the importance of keeping the

family healthy — both emotionally and physically. I offer suggestions on what
the family can do to make everyone’s life easier and to reduce stress and
upheaval. And I show you ways that you — yes, you, the stroke survivor —
can take care of your family! Read on.
Stroke Affects Every Type of Family
You can count on the fact that your stroke will have an impact on all the
members of your family — no matter what sort of family you have. Although
the challenges may be different, depending upon your age, marital status, and
other factors, you can still expect stroke to change your life and the lives of
those close to you. Just consider the following scenarios:
 You are one half of an older couple: You have adult children who live
away. You may be surprised by the financial bind you and your spouse
find yourselves in after stroke. If you are seriously disabled, and your
spouse can’t take care of you alone, you may have to consider getting
help in the home or going into a nursing home, both of which may be
more than you can afford. The caregiver may continue to shoulder the
burden of all your care and risk serious emotional and health problems.
Depression, guilt, shame, and other feelings can develop without active
intervention.
 You are an older person who lives alone: Now, you need help in the
home or must move to a nursing home. You are considering moving in
with one of your adult children, even though very few families can pro-
vide the quality of care that is necessary for a stroke survivor. Your
adult child may have to give up employment and neglect his or her own
children to take care of you. An occupational therapist could evaluate
the situation to determine the feasibility of home care from your family.
But be prepared that these situations often don’t work out.
 You are part of a family with children at home: You may have earned
some or all of the family income. Now, your spouse may have to become
the primary breadwinner — perhaps even taking a second job if you
relied on two incomes before — plus take on the full responsibility of
caring for the kids. Plus now there’s you to take care of. Despite all your
love and commitment, stroke can be a major threat to any marriage. You
may have to turn to your or your spouse’s parents for help.
Whatever your family situation, your stroke disability means that now you
can’t do everything you once did. Someone else has to do the work for you.
That someone else is almost always a family member.
The physical work may be significant. But what stresses a family member the
most is the emotional work. Even if your spouse seems to be taking on the
brunt of your stroke disability, other relationships change as your increased
294
Part V: Living with Stroke 

dependence requires adjustments in the way your spouse spends time. Your
caregiver may insist that he or she is managing just fine — and you may find
that all your needs are met while the house stays spic-and-span and every
aspect of your lives seems under control.
Checking for signs of stress
A smooth-running household and your attentive care is no guarantee that
your partner isn’t experiencing overwhelming stress. Check for these signs of
stress in your spouse and in your household:
 Your caregiver does not act like the same person.
 Your caregiver never talks about problems and difficulties.
 No one laughs. The family has lost its sense of humor.
 Family members are defensive about whether they are “doing enough”
for you.
 Family members criticize each other.
 Your caregiver has emotional outbursts that are not typical of his or 
her personality.
 Your caregiver doesn’t talk to you as frequently or in the same manner
he or she used to.
 Family members visit you less often or for shorter periods of time.
 Your caregiver has forsaken his or her former social schedule or per-
sonal routines.
295
Chapter 17: Taking Care of Family
Wisdom from the trenches
Because stroke is new to most families, it’s not
surprising that it takes a while to adjust. Over
time, family members have shared amazing
insights with me — and I pass them on to you.
Time and again, I’ve heard individuals say, “If
only I’d known in the beginning that. . . .”
It’s easy to underestimate the impact of your
stroke if you just look at the physical disabilities.
If you go home from the hospital or rehabilita-
tion unit after a stroke, you are not prepared for
how difficult your life and your caregiver’s life
can become.
There are completely unexpected and serious
financial burdens caused by stroke disability.
Your caregiver often tries to cover up for you,
understating the problems both of you are
having.

If you answer yes to even a few of these situations, you can assume that your
family members are experiencing stress. If you are still in the early days after
your stroke, continue to monitor the family situation, taking a “pulse” every
week to see if things are changing — for better or worse.
It will take some time for you and your family to realize the full implications
of your stroke. Expect some emotional peaks and valleys as you all adjust to
the new limitations and demands of your disabilities. In the beginning, every-
one may rally and put forth a positive front. This may be followed by an emo-
tional dip. As the weeks and months pass, and your lives don’t return to
normal, the stress may build. In some cases, family members may become
depressed and physically ill.
Struggling with the “new you”
The changes you are experiencing from your stroke have an impact on your
family. Some are more challenging than others. Again, the changes that often
cause the most stress for your family are not your physical limitations, but
the changes to your personality or emotional state.
Stroke often causes personality change
It is common for stroke to decrease executive function, which is a fancy way
of saying you are no longer a responsible decision-maker. Executive function
refers to your ability to make decisions under pressure, to concentrate for
periods of time, and to hook different ideas together in order to come up with
a unifying concept or decision. You may be smart and have intact memory.
You just can’t use your intelligence and memory in a practical way to make
plans and get anything done.
If the change is obvious, doctors or nurses may mention it. Medical profes-
sionals often offer hope that you’ll return to your old self in time. Sometimes
that happens, but often it doesn’t. If the personality change is still present
after a month or two, then you probably aren’t ever going to be quite your
old self. And you are likely not even aware of the “new you.” So your family
has to deal with this, as well, finding you unpredictable and, in some cases, a
stranger to them.
Sometimes, but not usually, your family members may enjoy the new, more
carefree you. But they may now worry about leaving you alone or letting you
drive. They may be uncomfortable about treating you like a child, perhaps
forbidding you to drive if you’re not capable or insisting that you do the exer-
cises your physical therapist gave you. They may even hesitate to talk about
your changes among themselves, feeling that they’re being disloyal or disre-
spectful somehow.
296
Part V: Living with Stroke 

Stroke causes depression
Though it is one of the most treatable outcomes of stroke, depression is often
undiagnosed or ignored for a variety of reasons. (See Chapter 16 for more on
depression.) Too many families assume that depression is just something
they have to learn to live with — or they consider it a character weakness
that they should have the strength to overcome. Of course, in the family
dynamic, the depression of the stroke survivor has an impact on the spouse
and other members of the family. And it is common for other family members
to suffer from depression, too.
Stroke causes dementia
You may not have the memory and smarts that you used to have before your
stroke. You may fight against showing the limitations you sense in your memory
and ability to figure things out. Your family may be hesitant to mention them.
If you can manage to bring the problem out in the open, there is quite a bit
you can do to help with the memory problems. See Chapter 7 for more.
Stroke can make you unaware of your disabilities
Stroke damages your brain’s ability to recognize the full significance of your
disability. This is most obvious with strokes that injure the right brain and
paralyze or weaken your left side. Your apparent lack of concern for your
serious situation can be particularly difficult for your caregiver and family.
They may interpret your attitude as a sign you’ve given up or just don’t care.
If they do not understand that this is something you can’t help, they may
express resentment or frustration toward you.
When a loved one is changed by stroke, families find themselves in foreign
territory, dealing with a “stranger.” Reactions may range from extreme polite-
ness and heroic martyrdom to boiling resentment and emotional withdrawal.
A concerted family effort to pull together as a team will do a lot to help create
a healthier environment for them — and you. By overlooking or avoiding a
problem, the opportunity to intervene and improve your recovery from
stroke may be lost.
Admitting When the Family Needs Help
Self-sufficiency is a wonderful part of the human spirit and is nourished and
highly valued in our culture. This same pride, though, can make you unneces-
sarily miserable. Your independent spirit may blind you to how badly you
need help and make it difficult for you to ask for help.
297
Chapter 17: Taking Care of Family

Recognizing your limitations
Don’t get me wrong: I’m not telling you to give up, lean back, and let others
wait on you hand and foot. The greatest success comes from stroke survivors
who fight the hardest to win back everything that has been taken from them.
And they usually have to do it themselves. Yes, you are alone to a large
extent. But it basically boils down to the message imparted in the Serenity
Prayer: having the courage to change what you can, the humility to accept
what you can’t, and the wisdom to know the difference.
This is valuable advice not just for you, but for your family members, too. Just
as you will benefit from recognizing that you can get yourself from bed to bath-
room if you continue your physical therapy, but you can’t drive responsibly,
your spouse will benefit from learning those same distinctions. A 70-year-old
woman may be able to help her husband dress and get to the breakfast table,
but she can’t lift him into the car. An adult child may be able to attend to his
disabled father regularly and arrange for visiting nurses, but he can’t take on
the responsibilities of his father moving in with the family.
In order to deal with these situations effectively, you need an objective
assessment of how you are doing. If you and your caregiver are getting along
well and even improving in your function and happiness every day, then go
on doing it yourself. But if an honest assessment says that overall you are
doing worse, then it’s time to ask for help, and the sooner the better.
Evaluating your situation
This evaluation is probably best made by someone else — perhaps a profes-
sional who is both knowledgeable and more objective. But if you have always
been the independent type, then you will probably be making your own assess-
ment. Again, I advise you that your stroke may have left you with some limita-
tions in your self-awareness. You benefit from involving your caregiver and
other family members, perhaps even friends, your doctor, and the other
health professionals who are aware of your situation.
You may have to ask some hard questions of yourself and others: Are you a
difficult patient? Have you been angry, emotional, demanding, or otherwise
hard to be around? Are you critical of your caregiver and others in the house-
hold? Do you have unreasonable expectations? Are you following the advice
of the health pros and doing your exercises and taking medications? Is your
caregiver able to meet your needs consistently? Is your caregiver meeting his
or her needs as well?
The answers to these questions will give you a good idea of whether you
need help. If you are not getting better, then you are risking your remaining
independence by continuing to try and go it alone. You can do a lot to get back
on the path to recovery, but you and your family may need to ask for help.
298
Part V: Living with Stroke 

Taking Care of the Caretaker
Caregivers run a serious risk of burnout. Taking care of a stroke patient can be 
a 24-hour job with no time off — and no benefits. Often, the task demands
more than the individual can handle — lifting a larger person from a bathtub,
for example. The stroke survivor may be emotionally difficult, too. Mix all this
with a little financial anxiety and the social isolation that often occurs when a
spouse is disabled, and you have an unhealthy situation, indeed. Caregiving
can result in feelings of anger, resentment, abandonment, fear, and guilt. Care-
giving can lead to depression. Caregiving can lead to susceptibility to illness.
Preventing caregiver burnout
Enough. I’m sure you’ve got the idea. What can be done? Plenty! When 
the stroke survivor and the caregiver become aware of the risks in their 
situation — and that the challenges are nobody’s fault — they can work
together to find solutions. Here are just a few recommendations:
 Invite help from friends and family: Arrange to have friends and family
visit and spend time with the stroke patient so that the caregiver can
have some free time, whether for a couple hours or an afternoon.
 Find a daycare facility: Yes, daycare for adults. They do exist and
they’re for adults with various disabilities. A primary benefit of such
facilities is to offer caregivers a fallback so that when they must attend
to other responsibilities or simply need a little R&R, they can feel
assured that their loved one will get quality care in their absence.
 Join a stroke support group: In most larger communities, there are
stroke clubs that provide a chance for you to meet others with similar
challenges. It isn’t the type of social life that you imagined for yourself
before your stroke — but it gives you a chance to learn more and give
your caregiver a little free time.
 Turn to adult children: Families often face discomfort with the role-
reversal that occurs when children must assume responsibility for par-
ents. But if your spouse-caregiver is overwhelmed with the demands of
your care, it’s critical to call on the kids for help. Whether it’s simply a
request to help spare a parent from around-the-clock care or some addi-
tional coverage so the caregiver can take a much-deserved vacation,
you’ll probably find that most children are eager for a way to help out.
 Connect with other caregivers: Check with the local stroke support
group or contact the National Stroke Association (www.stroke.org) or
American Stroke Association (www.strokeassociation.org) and find
out if there is a representative near you who can help. Call the hospital
that took care of your stroke and ask if they provide any way for your
caregiver to meet others in the same situation. By connecting with
299
Chapter 17: Taking Care of Family

others in similar situations, your caregiver may discover tips on coping
and will have an opportunity to commiserate and find support among
people with like experiences.
 Renew friendships and activities: Encourage your caregiver to maintain
or renew connections, social activities, and personal interests. It’s typi-
cal for a stroke to overwhelm the routines and rhythms of a family’s
lives. After weeks of upheaval, a caregiving wife may suddenly realize
she’s missed the weekly yoga class or book club gatherings that she
once loved. An adult child may find that he’s missed his son’s entire
soccer season because of responsibilities to his disabled mother. It’s
critical for the caregiver to maintain some sense of “ordinary” and plea-
sure in his or her life. This also helps reduce the risk of isolation.
 Get caregiver training: Arrange for a professional nurse to visit the
home, train the caregiver, and reevaluate the caregiver’s ability to
handle all the work required. This may enlighten the caregiver to new
and efficient ways to deal with some of the responsibilities.
 Get a good long-distance plan: Or whatever it takes to open up as many
communication channels as possible for the caregiver. Whether it’s a
call from a cousin in California or daily e-mail from grandkids in Grand
Rapids, contact with other loved ones keeps the caregiver from feeling
isolated and alone.
 Make a doctor appointment: Insist that your caregiver get frequent
medical check-ups and perhaps some type of counseling to track his or
her mental health. It’s important to be alert to the possibility of depres-
sion, which is a major treatable problem (see Chapter 16).
What if the caregiver needs medical care?
What will happen if your caregiver is temporarily disabled by an illness? A
frank discussion opens an opportunity to anticipate difficulties and take steps
to make two lives less stressful. Knowing that you have a contingency plan in
case your caregiver becomes sick may give both of you peace of mind — and,
in turn, reduce anxiety that can lead to illness.
Here are a couple of options that you may not want to hear about. Nursing
homes can take residents on a short-term basis. If your caregiver becomes ill,
you could stay in a nursing home for a month or two — and give your spouse
a chance to regain his or her health. Another option might be assisted living.
Both of you could move into an assisted-living community where you could
receive the help you need without your being dependent on your spouse.
Neither has to be a permanent situation.
300
Part V: Living with Stroke 

For caregivers only
Change for the better often starts when things seem the worst. Insist on stay-
ing healthy, both mentally and physically. Insist on getting help. And take the
following advice:
 Set limits and be sure and take time off.
 Take things a day at a time.
 Get some sleep.
 Keep a list of things you need done, and when others offer help, give
them something on the list.
 Maintain a support system of friends and family.
 Mind your health and finances.
 You’re not perfect — just do your best.
 Join a support group.
Pull Together, Not Apart
Sometimes people get the craziest ideas in their heads — such as a 75-year-
old woman believing she should be able to do all the work of three full-time
nurses and be pleasant and eager to start over again every day. Or a stroke
survivor thinking he can resume a job without missing a day of work or
having trouble dealing with the stress of the workplace.
How has your stroke affected the way others in your family feel that they 
are doing? Are they feeling that they have new expectations that they aren’t
living up to? Perceived criticism from you or others can make other members
of your family miserable. One of the characteristics of stroke patients is that
they are impatient. They can be more critical of themselves and others and
can become frustrated more easily.
Rather than a lot of introspective psychological analysis, family therapy, or
expensive testing for your family, I suggest a more practical approach for
starters. The psychologists and counselors can step in later if you don’t make
any headway. I propose that the family begin by pulling together as a team
and developing a game plan for managing life after stroke. Schedule a meet-
ing. If you can’t work well enough together to run your own meeting, get a
nurse in the hospital or someone else to facilitate the group.
301
Chapter 17: Taking Care of Family

Choose a captain — most likely not you, the stroke patient, but perhaps your
spouse or an adult child — to take charge, organize the huddles, and delegate
responsibilities. And do these things:
 Gather all facts on your physical, cognitive, and emotional problems.
 Identify the extra work, both physical and emotional, for everyone to
deal with the problems.
 Prioritize needs.
 Review your resources.
Here’s a starting list of tasks that may need to be assigned to various mem-
bers of your new team:
 Arrange for a nursing home or assisted living, if necessary, or make
alterations in the home for the stroke patient.
 Prepare food, clean house, do laundry, help dress, bathe, and transport.
 Schedule follow-up medical care and rehabilitation consultations at
home or, more likely, in a clinic. This includes special evaluations by 
a neuropsychologist or an occupational therapist.
 Plan for transportation.
 Manage medical insurance and pay required doctor and hospital bills.
 Purchase medications and administer medications on schedule.
 Make an overall financial plan for life after stroke, including updating a
will, creating a power of attorney, and making any medical decision-
making delegations. This includes managing investments, borrowing
money, setting up trusts, and dealing with Social Security.
 Manage the care of the caregiver, scheduling social outings, family visits,
and telephone contacts.
 Contact stroke clubs, community centers, your place of worship, and
other community resources to participate or volunteer to help.
 Evaluate progress in all areas and modify plans as necessary. This can
be done at regular group meetings or by telephone.
That last item is important. Success requires diligence and sticking to the
plan. If you start to fall behind, get depressed or discouraged, or start to lose
ground for medical reasons, someone has to take responsibility for evaluat-
ing progress and making changes in the overall plan.
Another option, if there are resources, is to hire a temporary or permanent
case manager who can do many of these tasks, including making evaluations
and arranging family meetings. Costs for case managers vary quite a bit, so be
sure you understand who will be doing what before you sign an agreement.
302
Part V: Living with Stroke 

Here are some facts that are important to know when a family starts to deal
with your stroke:
 Stroke changes the role of everyone in the family. The bigger the stroke,
the bigger the change.
 To work together, the family has to talk together. It takes someone to
organize talking together.
 The best way to get the work done is to break it up into pieces and find
someone or some way to accomplish each task.
 Kids, even teenagers, can help.
 Your estimate and your caregiver’s estimate of what you can do are often
overly optimistic. What your stroke requires should be based on an actual
list of what someone has to do for you each day for a week or two.
Financial Realities
If you were the breadwinner of the family — or your income was critical to
your family’s budget — you may be worried about finances along with every-
thing else. If you can’t work, how are you going to pay the mortgage? Even if
you plan to return to work eventually, how will your family adjust to the
reduced income in the meantime? And how will you handle all the medical
expenses piling up from your hospitalization?
You may be lucky — you may have a great insurance plan that will pay for all
or most of your care. You may not be the primary breadwinner in your family
after all. Or, best of all, your disability may be so neglible you anticipate
returning to work without missing a beat.
But if you’re like most stroke survivors, you’ll experience at least some finan-
cial impact from your stroke. Now, I don’t claim to be a financial expert — I’m
a doctor, after all — but I do know that the processes of collecting insurance,
dealing with employers, and settling the accounts of someone with a major
disabling illness is profoundly complicated.
Ask for guidance from a pro
Your family may have to turn to a professional to help you sort out all your
options. I know, I know . . . you’re concerned about your limited resources,
and I’m suggesting that you pay someone to help you? Trust me, if your
family feels as if they’re drowning in financial paperwork and can’t make
sense of the various resources, your investment will garner a great return.
303
Chapter 17: Taking Care of Family

Here are some materials your financial advisor may request in order to help
you make some decisions:
 All recent bills, paid and unpaid
 Insurance policies
 Social Security information
 Recent income tax returns
 Paychecks/stubs
 Investment documents
 Bank account information
 Loan statements
 Mortgages and deeds
Sharing your financial 
picture with the family
Always a touchy subject, money can be a difficult issue to discuss with the
family. But it’s critically important to talk about it with family members —
especially if your financial picture is changing because of the stroke. The
child who was thinking they might finance a house with their inheritance
from you needs to know that your money may not be available if you require
a long stay in a nursing home.
Trust may become an issue for you, particularly if your stroke has made you
suspicious or overly emotional. Once you are disabled by stroke, the fact is,
you just won’t have as much control over your life as you would like.
It’s a good idea for you and your spouse or other household members to
develop a new budget for your life after stroke. Sometimes the budget may
seem impossible and require drastic changes. Getting a reverse mortgage, for
example, essentially lets you sell your house in slow motion to pay for med-
ical care and nursing care. However it comes about, a good realistic financial
plan can help you recover from stroke. Devote the time and energy to getting
a plan developed and sharing it with your whole family.

You Can’t Take It with You: 
Wills and Wishes
What if you had not survived your stroke? Would your family have known
where to find important papers regarding financial issues, burial matters, and
property concerns? Do you have a will? Do you have medical directives in
place so that others can make medical decisions for you when you can’t?
Have you updated the beneficiaries of your life insurance policy?
You have just survived a close call. Many strokes are fatal. Your predicted 
life span is shorter now. If you have any doubts, check on the price of life-
insurance coverage. And your chances of another stroke are now much
higher than they were before.
Now’s the time to confront that uncomfortable issue no one likes to think
about: your own demise. Of course, you are going to do everything in your
power to reduce your odds of another stroke — and I have faith that you will
succeed. But you will feel better if you help to plan for a secure future for
your family — in case you are not in the picture. Unless you are an Egyptian
pharoah, you can’t take it with you.
Get your affairs in order
Be sure you have the following in place:
 An up-to-date will
 A living will, if you want one
 A durable power of attorney
 Assignment of healthcare decisions to a family member
 A trust, if you need one
There are experts in elder law, attorneys, who can help you. The more
experts you get to help you, the more likely it is that you will be able to take
advantage of every program you are eligible for.

Appreciate the power of family
I admit I’ve dumped some gloom and doom on you in this chapter on family
matters — but let me take a moment to counter some of the negative by
focusing on the power of family. One of your greatest assets as a stroke sur-
vivor is your family support system. Sure, it isn’t infallible and of course it
can be distressed by too much pressure. But your family may be instrumental
in optimizing your recovery. Here are some family strengths:
 A family increases the effectiveness of problem-solving and results in a
better solution for everyone.
 A family provides emotional support for each other and, as a result, the
group together is happier, more productive, and has more stamina than
they would were they separate.
 A family can set priorities and establish reasonable standards and allow
its members to feel they are doing their parts. Unreasonable expecta-
tions and criticisms can be brought out into the open and dealt with
directly.
Your stroke disability presents immense challenges to your family. Good com-
munication, a clear delineation of responsibilities, and recognizing when you
need help increase the likelihood that you and your family will successfully
adapt to life after stroke. If I am successful in communicating the key message
in this chapter, then it will result in better care for you.

Leaving a health-oriented legacy for your kids
You have wills and powers of attorney to take
care of your legal and financial legacy. The only
way you have to protect your genetic legacy is
to educate the rest of your family on what they
can do to avoid or postpone having a stroke or
heart disease themselves. Do your kids smoke?
Have they checked their blood pressure? Do
they get exercise and watch their blood lipid
levels? Good health could be the most valuable
part of your estate. Maybe they didn’t listen to
you when they were teenagers. Maybe your
recent stroke experience and a few years of
maturity have made them better listeners.

steps to improve your personal stroke care and prevent
stroke. Finally, the last chapter provides a glossary of
terms that serves as a helpful and quick reference to the
bits of unavoidable technical jargon I have had to include
in the book.

Ten Ways to Help Your Community
Manage Stroke
In This Chapter
 Encouraging your community to develop resources to combat stroke
 Informing others about stroke risks and opportunities to prevent stroke
A
fter a stroke, you may be inclined to turn inward. One of the best strate-
gies to energize your recovery is to turn outward to others in your com-
munity. Not only can your community help you recover from a stroke, you
can help others avoid stroke — by parlaying your experiences and knowledge
into actions that educate friends, neighbors, and colleagues and help
improve stroke treatment in your community.
Join a Group for a More Powerful Voice
Although stroke is the third-leading cause of death in the United States — not
to mention a major cause of serious disability — stroke does not get the same
national attention as Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease, heart disease,
or cancer. Add your voice to increase the volume and bring needed attention
for more resources and support. Local, state, and national organizations are
in place to fight stroke in the United States and Canada.
Local stroke clubs and support groups
The stroke support group or stroke club in your community offers a pathway
out of the isolation that often afflicts a stroke patient. These organizations 
are often based in hospitals. Some are free-standing groups and others are

affiliated with national organizations such as the American Heart Association
(www.americanheart.org).
Involvement in a stroke support group can be critical to the caregiver, who is
often struggling to juggle the demands of the stroke survivor as well as his or
her own needs. The support system provides knowledge, tips, and tools for
emotional survival, not to mention a network of people familiar with the
stresses of caregiving. In addition to meetings, the caregiver benefits from
phone contact, visits, social events, and new friendships.
Stroke clubs often sponsor stroke awareness events, arrange free risk-factor
screening clinics, and work to promote better stroke care in your community.
Meetings often include talks by local medical-care professionals who have a
special interest in stroke.
Regional, state, and national organizations
Several organizations at the national level offer services and resources that
reach down to local communities, though the availability varies by state and
city. The American Stroke Association and the National Stroke Association
are two voluntary organizations at the national level. You can join each of
these organizations and participate in national programs to increase stroke
education, promote research, and help stroke survivors and caretakers alike.
The groups sponsor research and publish helpful information. Both provide
extensive information for patients and professionals. You do not have to be a
member to benefit from the information on their Web sites.
 American Stroke Association (www.strokeassociation.org) — closely
affiliated with the American Heart Association
 National Stroke Association (www.stroke.org)
Some government organizations that offer valuable resources are
 National Institutes of Health (www.nih.gov)
 Centers for Disease Control (www.cdc.gov)
 National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (www.ninds.
nih.gov)
An unusual regional organization, the Stroke Belt Consortium, exists in the
southeastern United States to address the needs of this high-risk area for
stroke. You will certainly find the information on its Web site, www.stroke
belt.org, helpful.

Share Knowledge with 
Friends and Family
The only thing many of your friends and family may know about stroke is that
they don’t want one. You can teach them to recognize signs and symptoms 
of stroke and — better yet — help them prevent stroke. Through your experi-
ences, you may persuade them to take steps to reduce their own stroke risk
and learn what steps to take if someone they love is suddenly stricken with 
a stroke.
Think about it: As a stroke survivor, you have gained an advanced education
in stroke and its prevention and care. Why not put your hard-earned knowl-
edge to good use and teach others? From “Emergency Room 101” to graduate
classes in blood pressure and cholesterol care, you have a lot to offer your
friends and family.
Simply telling the story of your stroke and how it has affected you can have a
profound impact. Your friends and colleagues may not pick up on the scary
public service announcements in newspapers or TV — but I’ll bet the story
you share with them will stick and be forwarded to people they know. You
can also encourage them to be aware of the need for good stroke care in your
community and the importance of building community resources. Your efforts
may even persuade them to volunteer to help families struggling with stroke.
Work with Local Hospitals
As the average age of the population increases, more and more people will
suffer from stroke. At the same time, hospitals are cutting out every unneces-
sary expense in order to remain financially healthy. To make matters more
complicated, stroke treatment has advanced so dramatically in the past
decade that many hospitals are just now beginning to catch up.
You can, however, wield some influence over your local hospitals’ budget-cut
or development decisions. Community support is important to hospitals. By
communicating your expectations of high-level stroke care, hospital adminis-
trators are more likely to take positive action.
Contact your hospitals to find out about special services and programs for
stroke treatment. Compare their interest and commitments to providing the
best care. Questions to ask each hospital include the following:
311
Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Help Your Community Manage Stroke

 Does the hospital have a special stroke unit with nurses trained and
experienced in the care of stroke patients?
 Is the emergency room prepared to respond rapidly to stroke according
to national guidelines for acute stroke centers? Which guidelines does
the hospital follow?
 Is there an acute stroke-response team available on short notice to take
care of stroke patients soon after they come to the emergency room?
 Is the hospital certified by the Joint Commission on Accreditation of
Healthcare Organizations (JCAHO) as a Primary Stroke Center? (JCAHO
is on the Internet at www.jcaho.com.)
 Does the hospital serve as a resource for patients after they are dis-
charged following a disabling stroke? How?
Write letters to let hospitals know what you expect. Right now, hospital
administrators and governing boards need to hear that you want and expect
the best possible stroke care. Even if the local hospitals may have good
stroke resources, they still need to hear from you in order to keep them fully
staffed and up to standards. This is one area where a written letter may have
more impact than a telephone call, which can be referred to a customer ser-
vice representative who may not even make note of the content of your call.
If your letter isn’t answered, write another or call until you get a response.
Check into Emergency Medical Services
It doesn’t do any good to have a great hospital for stroke if your local emer-
gency medical service won’t get you there quickly. How good is your local 911
service? The following questions will help determine how good your local 911
is for stroke:
 Are the dispatchers who answer the phones trained to recognize stroke?
 Does the service follow special stroke protocols that allow them to get a
stroke patient moving more quickly to a hospital? (Sometimes this is
called scoop and run.)
 If a stroke occurs, does the service take the patient to a special stroke
center with an established record for rapid treatment of stroke?
 Are the ambulance crews trained to recognize stroke and the need for
rapid transport to a stroke center? How much stroke training do they
get? How frequently is it repeated?
Whom should you contact at the emergency service? I would suggest the
emergency response director. However, if there is a governing board or
312
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

county government agency, they may also need to receive a letter from you.
Again, I’d recommend writing first. If you don’t get a response, follow up with
another letter or a phone call.
Educate Schoolchildren About Stroke
Several studies have indicated that what children learn in school gets passed
on to their parents and the rest of their family. I’ve heard from many former
smokers who reported that their impetus for quitting was their school-aged
child who brought home the lessons learned in class. Many schools teach
children the basics of heart resuscitation. Shouldn’t they teach the impor-
tance of recognizing a stroke and calling 911, too? Would children knowing
about the risk factors of stroke make our whole population healthier?
Many grade-school and high-school teachers welcome classroom visits from
medical experts and patients on pertinent topics. Do you have children or
grandchildren in the local school system? Are the kids learning about high
blood pressure? Smoking? The brain? Check with the school administrators,
the head of the science or health department, or the school board. Perhaps
you could volunteer to speak to classes about your own struggle and recov-
ery from stroke. Stroke is interesting from a scientific point of view because it
teaches something about how the brain works.
Start Your Own Stroke Recovery Group
No stroke club or support group in your community? Why not start your own
network of fellow stroke patients? You or your caregiver can serve as the hub
of an effective group that deals with stroke in your own circles. Many people
initially depressed and overwhelmed by stroke have found a path to sanity
and a meaningful life by turning outward to help others.
How to get started? I have some ideas:
 Let the social workers and discharge planning nurses at hospitals know
that you are willing to talk to any stroke patient or caregiver.
 Offer to share advice about nursing homes, adapting the home for the
stroke survivor, and other recovery issues with other stroke patients.
 Let your church, synagogue, mosque, or place of worship know that you
are willing to be a resource for any family with a stroke disability.
 Contact your local business clubs or other community-service organiza-
tions to find out if you might approach members who’ve suffered a stroke.

Chapter 18: Ten Ways to Help Your Community Manage Stroke

Suggest News Stories About 
Stroke Champions
People working hard to prevent or help others cope with stroke deserve
some public recognition and acclaim. Collect interesting stories about stroke.
Find out about doctors and nurses who’ve championed improvement in
stroke care and are encouraging other doctors and nurses to take stroke
more seriously. Gather tales of patients who’ve made amazing recoveries and
caregivers who’ve supported them. Seek out news about hospitals that have
recently received stroke certification or a local EMS service that has started a
new stroke-education program.
These are great news stories! Let the local newspapers know if no one else
has. Perhaps a local radio and television station would take an interest in
stroke as a topic for a discussion panel or short news story. Maybe the news-
paper might consider a feature article on “a day in the life” of a stroke
patient, nurse, emergency room doctor, or caregiver.
Get Your Community to Participate 
in Stroke Research
Medical research is costly and slow. Yet it is critical to the advancement of
treatment and prevention of stroke. Often, lack of money, conflicting priori-
ties, and politics may mean that important research in stroke is neglected in
your community.
From hospitals and nearby medical schools, you can learn whether any
stroke research is being conducted in your community. None? Check the Web
site for Washington University in St. Louis (www.strokecenter.org) — it
lists the many ongoing clinical trials in stroke throughout the world. Stroke
research evaluates new ways to prevent and treat stroke as well as enhance
recovery. Not all research involves clinical trials. The goal of many important
research projects is to understand or diagnose stroke better.
You can encourage hospitals and doctors to start more research. Insist that
working to make things better for stroke patients is part of being a leading
stroke hospital or doctor. Communicate that you want the latest treatments
available in research protocols. It can’t hurt. Most new treatments don’t work
out, but patients in clinical trials receive the best possible care. Your voice
may be the one that helps a hospital board or individual doctor decide that
they want to make a difference in how stroke is treated.
314
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Volunteer for Stroke Research
You yourself can volunteer to be part of a research project. Research projects
are available across the country. Numerous trials and studies seek patients
who have had a stroke. Some offer a chance to receive new treatment to pre-
vent a second stroke.
Contact doctors at stroke centers in your area and ask if there are any ongo-
ing trials. If not, are they aware of other trials that you might be eligible for? 
If they are doing trials but not one that you are eligible for, ask them if they
would be interested in joining a study that you are eligible for.
If you’re a stroke survivor with other family members who’ve suffered a stroke,
you may be a valuable national resource in the fight against stroke! Seek out a
stroke study involving family history. This is one of our best hopes for gaining
a true understanding of the causes and potential treatments for stroke.
Don’t agree to participate in a trial until you have fully understood the risks
and potential benefits. Doctors involved in such trials are required to explain
the uncertainty and risks to you. Ask as many questions as you want and take
the time to rally family support before you agree to be part of a trial. Be sure
that you intend to stick with the trial before you sign up. It is important that
everyone who starts a trial finishes.
Make Sense of Health Policy
How capable is your community in responding to the needs of stroke
patients? Is a reasonable quality of care available to those who need it at a
price they can afford to pay? Are there enough certified nursing homes in
your area? Have stroke patients and their families suffered unnecessarily in
your community? Are community resources sufficient to handle the demands
of stroke sufferers? If not, is your community taking steps to meet these
needs? Who is planning for the healthcare needs of your community?
By becoming informed on the problem of stroke as a community responsibil-
ity, you and your family can participate in forming new plans and policies.
And then run for Congress. Why not?

 Finding inspiration in the stories of notable stroke survivors
A
president. An Academy Award winner. A writer. A musician. A beauty
queen. These are just a handful of the remarkable people who’ve 
survived — and thrived — after stroke.
As you now know, stroke can have devastating consequences. But these con-
sequences can also be overcome. There are thousands of remarkable stories
from individuals who’ve experienced stroke and gone on to create, produce,
lead, contribute, and inspire. I hope these portraits inspire you.
President Woodrow Wilson Overcomes
Stroke and Leads a Country
Several strokes and evidence of transient ischemic attack (TIA — see Chapter 4)
didn’t detour Thomas Woodrow Wilson from his path toward the ultimate
leadership position. Despite evidence of stroke more than 16 years earlier,
Wilson persevered to become president of Princeton University, governor of
New Jersey, and then was sworn in as the 28th president of the United States
in 1913.

In 1896, at age 39, Wilson suffered what many believe was his first stroke
while he was a professor at Princeton. The stroke weakened his right hand
and arm and also decreased the sensation in his right hand. The weakness
improved with time and he persisted in his career. Four years later he became
president of Princeton University. It is believed that he suffered further
strokes in 1904 and 1906; one further weakened his right arm, the other
affected the vision in his left eye.
The symptoms from these three strokes suggest that Wilson may have had
blood clots in the left carotid artery that were breaking free to injure the
brain and eye on the left side. (Remember that left-sided brain problems
most often cause right-sided symptoms.) It is speculated that after the 1906
episode, Wilson enjoyed a stroke-free period for a few years, although some
sources indicate he complained of serious headaches during this time. This
has raised speculation that he may have had severe and uncontrolled blood
pressure in addition to atherosclerosis of the left carotid artery.
In 1910, he was elected governor of New Jersey. In 1912, he began campaign-
ing for the office of President of the United States. During the campaign, Wilson
had right hand and arm transient problems that suggest TIAs to many who’ve
reviewed his medical history. He won the election, but a month after he took
office he may have had his first stroke on the right side of his brain — this
time, his left hand and arm were weakened.
After re-election in 1916, he continued to suffer from severe headaches — 
and likely had more transient strokes. At the time, the significance of tran-
sient strokes was not known, nor was high blood pressure known as a cause
of stroke.
But a physician with the knowledge we have today might have predicted the
devastating stroke that hit Wilson in 1919. After a series of events suggesting
right-brain problems, he finally had a massive right-brain stroke that left him
completely paralyzed on the left side, though still able to speak. As is often
the case with left-brain strokes, he denied that he had even had a stroke.
Wilson finished his term of office without the public ever realizing his serious
condition. He is thought to have become more withdrawn and depressed. He
retired to private life in Washington, where he died five years later in 1924. In
the meantime, his care was managed by his wife.
Although Wilson was repeatedly struck down by stroke over a period of 13
years, he fought back successfully time after time. He lived a productive life
despite the problems and earned a place in American history.
Other Presidents who have had strokes include John Quincy Adams, Franklin
Roosevelt, Richard Nixon, and Gerald Ford.

Miss America Jacqueline Mayer
Discovers a Different Kind of Beauty
Who could have imagined that the 20-year-old college student who won the
Miss America pageant in 1963 would be struck down at the age of 28 — with a
massive stroke? In 1970, the young mother woke one morning to discover she
couldn’t move or speak. Jackie Mayer survived the near-fatal experience, and
began a long, arduous seven-year journey that required relearning how to
speak, walk, and even tie her shoes. Her rehabilitation was intense and even
when she regained the ability to overcome almost all of her disability, her
public appearances required an athletic endurance and a high level of self-
discipline.
As she recovered, she turned outward and became a national spokesperson for
the National Stroke Association. She shot a video, A Different Kind of Beauty, to
increase stroke awareness, for the American Heart Association. Mayer wrote a
regular column for the National Stroke Association’s Be Stroke Smart publica-
tion. She served on the National Advisory Council of the National Institute of
Neurological Disorders and Stroke in Washington and has received awards for
her work in stroke. She still works as a motivational speaker. Learn more about
her story at her Web site, www.jackiemayer.com.
To win the Miss America pageant and then be seriously disabled by stroke
may have seemed a crushing defeat. Mayer has exhibited remarkable inner
strength to undertake the physical and emotional work needed to recover
from such a severe stroke. That she then devoted much of her life to helping
others with stroke only adds to the greatness of her achievement.
Composer  George Frideric Handel 
Writes “Messiah” After Stroke
George Frideric Handel enjoyed a long and fruitful career as a composer of
operas and oratorios. But it wasn’t until after a stroke at age 52, which left 
his thinking impaired and his right hand paralyzed, that he wrote his most
renowned work, Messiah. Despite deep depression over his condition, Handel
was able to recover the use of his hand. And regardless whether his thinking
remained diminished by stroke, he clearly had the wherewithal to continue
writing great music.
319
Chapter 19: Five Remarkable Stroke Recoveries

The composer was born in 1685 in Germany and exhibited a gift for music at
an early age. At the age of 18, in 1703, he began his musical career as a violin-
ist for the Hamburg Opera. His first two operas were produced before he was
20. His study and work took him to Florence, Rome, Naples, and Venice before
he moved to England, where he became a royal favorite. In 1714, he was com-
missioned to write Water Music, for wind and strings. His acclaim as a com-
poser grew.
In 1737, Handel suffered a stroke. He retreated to Aachen, Germany, where 
he recovered the use of his hand. He was changed by his stroke and lived 
a secluded life, depressed and troubled by multiple ailments. Yet in his 
return to England, he began writing the English choral works that eventually 
re-invigorated his creative life. This period culminated in his writing of the
oratorio Messiah in 1741 in roughly three energy-charged weeks. With this
success, he returned to a full life of music. He had a second stroke and then
became blind in 1752, but continued to produce musical works. He died in
1759 and is buried in Westminster Abbey in London.
Writer Ken Kesey Found TPA the 
Drug of Choice After Stroke
American novelist Ken Elton Kesey became as well known for his Acid Test
parties and Merry Pranksters cross-country antics as he was for his books
One Flew Over the Cuckoo’s Nest and Sometimes a Great Notion. At the height
of his popularity, Kesey, born in 1935, bridged the gap between the 1950s
Beat Generation and the 1960s hippie culture of California. Yet when Kesey
suffered a stroke at 62, TPA — not LSD — was the drug that saved him.
In 1997, Kesey had a stroke and was treated with TPA — which had only been
approved a year earlier. He responded to treatment and regained the use of
his right arm, which had been paralyzed by the stroke. The stroke research
community still remembers his much-publicized description of TPA as Drano
for the Brain-o.
Thanks, most likely, to TPA, his disability from stroke was minimal. In fact,
rather than slowing him down, the stroke inspired him with new energy that
lead to a final burst of creativity, including a bus tour of the United Kingdom
with some 30 passengers, performing a traveling version of his play Where’s
Merlin? before he died of cancer in 2001.

Actress Patricia Neal Recovers 
to Earn an Oscar Nomination
A year after winning an Academy Award for her role in the movie Hud, actress
Patricia Neal experienced a stroke so devastating that it put her in a coma
that lasted 21 days. Actually, she had three strokes in a single day. She was
pregnant at the time. Miraculously, she survived, gave birth to a daughter six
months later, and went on to star in movies — and even received another
Oscar nomination. Hers is one of the better known stories of remarkable
recovery and return to a full life after stroke.
Neal was 39 in 1966, when she developed a terrible headache followed by dis-
orientation and vomiting. She had a stroke that sent her to the emergency
room, where she had another and finally a third one that same day. These
strokes were caused by subarachnoid hemorrhage. After surgery to clip the
burst aneurysm, she fell into a coma. She wasn’t expected to survive.
Three weeks later, she came out of the coma, paralyzed on her right side,
unable to speak or understand conversation, and with double vision. She had
to relearn to speak and walk. Her husband, writer Roald Dahl, worked closely
with her to develop a rehabilitation program that kept her occupied every
minute of every day. This helped her to direct her anger and frustration into
the drive and determination to make her mind and body do the work neces-
sary for recovery.
She gave birth to a daughter six months after her stroke. Her recovery contin-
ued during this time. She battled depression and setbacks, but persevered
and gradually began to appear in public once again. In 1968, she starred in
the movie The Subject Was Roses and was nominated for an Academy Award.
Neal has appeared in many movies and television performances. She has also
been an active spokesperson for stroke — in 1978, she helped to dedicate the
Patricia Neal Rehabilitation Center, in her hometown of Knoxville, Tennessee.

Ten Opportunities 
to Prevent Stroke
In This Chapter
 Taking steps to prevent (another) stroke
 Reviewing the most critical stroke risks
M
edical researchers have identified a lot of valuable information that
can help you prevent stroke. In this chapter I present you with a short
list of these opportunities. The value of most of them is confirmed by testing
in clinical trials, whereas others are based on consistent observations com-
paring people who have had a stroke with those who haven’t. Some of it is
just common sense. Because heart disease and stroke share many risk fac-
tors, there are more benefits than just preventing stroke if you choose to take
advantage of one of these opportunities.
I’ve written most of the ten items below on the assumption that you have
already had one or more strokes and want to avoid more. To a great extent,
many of the recommendations, particularly those dealing with blood pres-
sure and cholesterol, are valuable even if you are smart enough to be trying
to prevent your first stroke.
The choice is yours.
Gathering Information
Any effort to reduce your chances of stroke begins with gathering data. This
step may seem like a chore that forces you to face facts you wish weren’t true.
But it’s a critical step in preventing future strokes. By having all the information
about your health status and stroke history in one place, you will undoubtedly
prompt more efficiency from physicians and healthcare professionals who can
then propose the best treatments and maintenance plan for you.

Most of the critical data is already available in your medical records.
Assembling this data may require patience, phone calls, signing forms, and
waiting in line.
You need copies of the actual laboratory and X-ray reports, not just some-
one’s summary of the report.
If you’ve been in the hospital recently, a copy of the discharge summary as
well as all test reports is very useful. Summarizing the results on a single
sheet, which includes the numerical value of the test result in addition to the
date it was obtained, can be very helpful. Get it before leaving the hospital.
Having made of list of information already available and medications you are
taking, you can then decide if important information is missing and track it
down with the help of your doctor.
At the minimum, a recent accurate measurement of the following should be
available to you if you are going to take maximum advantage of the opportu-
nities available to you (also see the Cheat Sheet at the front of this book for a
handy list you can take with you).
 Weight
 Height
 Abdominal girth (waist measurement)
 Blood pressure
 HDL and LDL cholesterol levels after eight hours of fasting
 Glucose tolerance test
 Electrocardiogram
 Chest X-ray
 Carotid ultrasound
 Hemoglobin and hematocrit
 Cardiac stress test
Treating High Blood Pressure
First, it’s important to accurately measure your blood pressure at different
times of day and in different circumstances. Then, some simple steps help
reduce your blood pressure. These include exercising, minimizing stress,
reducing caffeine, and possibly lowering the amount of salt in your diet. You
can also analyze where stress comes in your routine and see if there is any-
thing you can do about it.
324
Part VI: The Part of Tens 

Example? Commuters who drive to work are found to have higher blood pres-
sure than those who ride with them or take public transportation.
Taking medication to reduce high blood pressure has been shown to be effec-
tive time and again for reducing stroke risk. Some medications have fewer
side effects, and others are less expensive. Review Chapter 8 for more about
blood pressure meds and their effects.
I’m surprised at how often people choose not to take the opportunity to treat
their blood pressure. Such treatment is one of the best ways to prolong your
life and increase your ability to enjoy it.
Preventing Blood Clot Formation
Numerous trials among sufferers of white stroke have shown that medication
helps reduce the likelihood that more blood clots will form inside your heart
and the arteries of the brain.
Aspirin is the most commonly recommended drug. Aspirin is inexpensive and
generally well-tolerated in the low doses now generally recommended, either
one regular (325 milligrams) or one small tablet (100 or 81 milligrams) every
day. Side effects include easy bruising and stomach pain with bleeding ulcers.
You may not tolerate aspirin — or your doctor may recommend a medication
found to be more effective than aspirin. Two common alternatives are clopi-
dogrel, known by the trade name Plavix, and Aggrenox, a combination of a
very small dose of aspirin with a drug called dypyridamole. Warfarin may be
another medication suggested by your doctor for preventing blood clots —
particularly if you have atrial fibrillation or a heart valve. But warfarin is not
only more expensive, it entails some risks that require frequent blood testing.
Bottom line: It’s important to take the necessary steps to prevent blood clot-
ting if you’re at risk for stroke. Medication is critical in helping with this
effort. Whether your doctor recommends a low dose of aspirin or one of the
other medications, be sure you understand the precautions and follow the
dosage guidelines as given.
Reducing Cholesterol in Your Blood
Evidence supports this: People who exercise regularly and follow certain
diets have healthier levels of cholesterol in their blood. Diet and exercise
may reduce the “bad” cholesterol and increase the “good” (see Chapter 9 for
a complete explanation of these fats in the bloodstream). New information is
beginning to focus on the especially harmful effects of trans fats — processed
325
Chapter 20: Ten Opportunities to Prevent Stroke

foods such as solid margarine that have been hydrogenated for longer shelf life.
The FDA is requiring the inclusion of data about trans fat on food packaging.
Diet and exercise may not result in healthy cholesterol levels for everyone.
Taking statin medications has been shown to be effective in preventing stroke
and heart disease in those who have high levels of LDL. Statins are expensive
and may have some serious side effects. Routine testing for liver problems is
critical, as is being alert to muscle pain, which may be a sign of an adverse
reaction to these drugs. Repeated testing of your blood cholesterol levels
should be done to determine if you are taking the correct dose for you.
Treating Atrial Fibrillation
A simple electrocardiogram (EKG) will determine whether you have an irregu-
lar heartbeat, called atrial fibrillation. This condition is tied to stroke risk —
the uncoordinated contractions result in ineffective pumping of blood, which
can lead to pooling and clotting of the blood and, subsequently, stroke.
If you do have atrial fibrillation, your doctor will likely recommend that you
take the blood-thinning drug warfarin instead of an aspirin every day. Many
clinical trials have demonstrated that warfarin is an effective treatment for
atrial fibrillation — but there are risks.
If you take warfarin, do so with a great deal of attention to detail. Your diet,
the time of day that you take the medication, and other medications can all
affect the extent to which warfarin works. Taking warfarin is like driving on a
road with curves. You have to pay attention or you may drive off the road —
on one side or the other. With warfarin, a slight swerve (forgetting to take it
or taking it too soon) can cause bleeding from blood too thin, or stroke with
blood too thick.
“Steering” your warfarin dose requires strict adherence to your doctor’s
instructions as well as frequent blood tests. It’s also critical to alert your
doctor of unusual bleeding or bruising between tests. And even subtle
changes to your diet — more green, leafy vegetables, for example — may
have an impact. (Read Chapter 10 for more on warfarin risks.)
Checking Out Your Carotid Arteries
If you’ve had a stroke, be sure that one of your carotid arteries isn’t partially
blocked and about to close off completely. A carotid ultrasound test is easy
to undergo, and it’s a very accurate measure of whether your artery needs

neck — similar to when you lie down with one of your ears pressed into a
pillow. This is the blood rushing past the narrow spot in the artery.)
If you do learn of a blockage, your doctor will likely recommend a carotid
endarterectomy, a procedure that will clear the artery of blockage. Before
doing so, get a second opinion. I believe the best second opinion comes for a
stroke expert who is not a surgeon. Also, make sure your surgeon does this
procedure often and has good results. Ask for numbers, not just percentages.
Be especially wary if you are told your condition is too much of an emer-
gency to get a second opinion.
Eating Right and Staying Hydrated
Ensuring that you are fueling yourself with a healthy diet and taking in plenty
of fluids can have a direct impact on your risk of stroke. As discussed in
Chapter 9, a diet high in certain kinds of fats (hydrogenated oils, high-fat
dairy products, and, yes, those thick slabs of steak you adore) can lead to
unhealthy cholesterol levels — which means greater risk of heart attack and
stroke. A meal plan steeped in highly salted foods results in a sodium level
that can aggravate high blood pressure. Additionally, a diet that adds pounds
to your frame also adds stress to your heart. Eat moderately and watch the
fats and sodium. When you are dehydrated, your kidneys don’t have the
water they need to function at their best, and your blood may become more
concentrated. Your hydration is worst in the morning after your overnight
fast. Skip the ham and eggs, but don’t skip breakfast and a morning drink of
water or juice.
Stopping Smoking
What more can I say about tobacco use? If you always thought lung cancer
was your greatest risk from smoking, I hope you now know that far more
cases of emphysema, heart attack, and stroke result from smoking. Indeed,
one of the most dramatic changes you can make to improve your health is to
toss the cigarettes.
You’ll save money. Your clothes will smell better. Your lungs will be clearer.
You’ll reduce your stroke risk. Quit today.
Exercising Your Muscles and Your Brain
I don’t know of any clinical trials that show that you will have fewer strokes if
you exercise. I don’t know if you will stay smarter longer than you would
327
Chapter 20: Ten Opportunities to Prevent Stroke

have otherwise if you exercise your brain. However, plenty of anecdotal evi-
dence suggests that people who exercise their muscles and their brains are
less likely to become demented or to have strokes.
For many, exercise is a good relief from stress and can encourage you to eat
healthier food. There is no doubt that exercise helps you keep your weight
down if you tend to be too heavy.
Exercise is hard to overdo, but it is possible. A regimen that’s too difficult is
not likely to last. If you hate to exercise and have started and failed before, I
suggest trying walking. If you stay out of the way of cars, it is generally safe
and results in fewer injuries than running.
A weight-training program managed by a physical therapist or experienced
trainer can also be very helpful.
Writing Up a Maintenance Plan
Of course, you plan to follow some new guidelines to protect your health and
prevent stroke — but such a stroke-prevention plan will work much better if
you write it down and have it to refer to as you progress. It will work even
better if you share your plan with your family and others who live with you.
Your maintenance plan should be developed with the involvement of your
stroke physician. By working together to create a written outline, you’ll
ensure mutual understanding of what steps must be followed to protect you
from future stroke problems.
Of course, writing down the plan is only the first part of the process — you’ll
have to follow the plan diligently to enjoy the results. Consistently taking
medications, getting blood tests when you need them, and having check-ups
in time to catch problems early can take considerable effort. Evidence
strongly supports that the effort is worthwhile.
After a stroke, you are at great risk of having another stroke, not to mention
some kind of heart disease. Although you can’t change your stroke history,
you can proactively work to stave off future and possibly more disabling
strokes. Plenty of research supports that taking certain steps — eliminating
smoking from your life, lowering your blood pressure, reducing your choles-
terol level, to name a few — increases your chances to prevent stroke and
prolong your life. These opportunities have as much to offer you as seat belts
in your car or looking both ways when you cross the street. It’s your choice.

Glossary
T
hese terms pertaining to stroke are presented in alphabetical order, so
please don’t get frustrated if the definition of one item refers to a term
that isn’t addressed until later. Not everything is covered here. If the term
you seek is not here, check the index.
Acute stroke: A stroke is acute as it is still in the process of changing in the
first hours and days after the onset of the symptoms. The acute phase of
stroke, especially the first few minutes and hours, is when the injury is still
not complete, and treatments have the best chance of minimizing damage.
Amyloid angiopathy: A relatively uncommon cause of intracerebral hemor-
rhage stroke, occurring mostly in those who are in their 70s or older, result-
ing from an accumulation of a protein called amyloid in brain arteries, which
rupture and bleed.
Aneurysm: The stretching out of the rubbery wall of an artery into a balloon-
like bulge. This is typically the result of damage or weakness and can lead 
to rupture.
Angiography: A procedure that diagnoses the presence of blood clots in
blood vessels, involving the injection of a dye through the groin area, which
travels up to the brain, and the X-ray photographing of the brain’s blood ves-
sels concerned.
Anticoagulant: A drug or agent whose main effect is to prevent the blood
from clotting.
Aphasia: Condition that affects and causes deficits in language — including
the inability to speak, understand, write, and/or read — as a result of brain
damage, including damage caused by stroke.
Artery: A blood vessel that carries blood away from the heart to other parts
of the body.
Atherosclerosis: A condition in which scar tissue builds up in the arteries as
a result of years accumulating fat from the blood, scar tissue, and calcium.
The scar tissue is called atherosclerotic plaque and it can block blood ves-
sels. Because it is a rough spot on the inside of the blood vessel, blood clots
may form there. These clots themselves can block the artery where they
form or they can break off and travel through the bloodstream to the brain,
causing damage or bleeding along the way. Atherosclerosis is also called
hardening of the arteries.

Atherosclerotic plaque: Scar tissue in the arteries that builds up and can
cause atherosclerosis.
Atrial fibrillation: The abnormal and uncoordinated contractions of atria, or
upper chambers of the heart, which leads to the ineffective pumping of blood
by the heart.
Berry aneurysm: An aneurysm that forms in the subarachnoid space under-
neath the brain, usually at a branch point — also referred to as a saccular
aneurysm. When these aneurysms burst, they cause subarachnoid hemor-
rhage (SAH), a type of red stroke.
Blood clot: The resulting mass that occurs when blood tissue begins to col-
lect and “harden.” When this occurs inside blood vessels, it can stop blood
flow and lead to heart attack and stroke.
Brain stem: The base of the brain, found at the top of the spinal cord and
responsible for many of the brain’s primary functions.
Carotid artery: A large artery in the neck that carries blood to the brain,
often found to be involved in stroke.
Carotid endarterectomy: A surgical procedure that removes blockages such
as plaque or blood clots from the carotid artery.
Cerebrospinal fluid (CSF): The clear fluid that surrounds the brain inside the
skull and the spinal cord inside the spinal column.
Cholesterol: A waxy substance found in foods that come from animal
sources, such as milk, meat, and eggs. It is also manufactured inside the
human body. There are two types: low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol
and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol. See Chapter 9 for more.
CT scan: Also referred to as a CAT scan or computerized axial tomography
scan. A diagnostic tool that takes special images of the inside of the head, 
as a series of 12 to 20 pictures usually printed by a computer on a single
sheet of X-ray film. A CT scan can be valuable in determining whether a
stroke is caused by bleeding (involved in types of red stroke) or blockage
(white stroke).
Dementia: An unfortunately named condition in which damaged brain tissue
results in severely impaired memory and loss of brain function, which
becomes progressively worse with time.
Diabetes: A condition in which the body is incapable of producing or assimi-
lating insulin, which is needed to produce energy. Diabetes can increase the
possibility of cardiovascular disease.
330
Stroke For Dummies 

Diastolic blood pressure: The measurement of blood pressure taken when
the heart relaxes between heartbeats. The “lower number” of your blood
pressure reading.
Electrocardiogram: Also called EKG or ECG. A test that measures the health
of the heart.
Embolus: A piece of solid material floating in the bloodstream which travels
along branching blood vessels until it gets stuck and stops blood flow. If the
embolus gets stuck in a brain artery, it causes a stroke. Usually an embolus
that reaches the brain is a blood clot that has formed in the heart or on a
rough spot on a blood vessel.
Hemorrhage: Excessive or uncontrolled bleeding from a ruptured blood
vessel. The less blood is clotting, the harder it is to stop hemorrhage.
Hemorrhagic conversion of infarction: A rare condition in which an artery
injured by ischemia — or lack of blood flow (white stroke) — breaks and
bleeds into the area of infarction — or dead brain tissue. Sometimes this
bleeding has little impact. Other times, this bleeding can be so severe that it
causes further disability and even death. Hemorrhagic conversion occurs
more often in people taking drugs or having diseases that interfere with the
ability of blood to clot.
High blood pressure: A condition in which the heart has to work too hard to
pump enough blood through the arteries. See Hypertension.
High-density lipoprotein (HDL): One of the fat transporters that carries cho-
lesterol and triglycerides in the body, often referred to as “good” cholesterol
because it carries fats to the liver where they are processed and excreted
from the body.
Hypertension: Also called high blood pressure. A chronic condition in
which the pressure of the blood flowing through blood vessels is above the
normal range, which is typically 140/90 or greater. Hypertension is the
number-one risk factor for stroke.
Infarction: Death of cells caused by lack of blood. In the case of stroke,
infarction is typically the result of blockage of blood flow in the brain
because of a blood clot.
Intracerebral: One of those fancy doctor terms, in this case meaning nothing
more than within the brain.
Intracranial: The space inside the large skull cavity occupied by the brain, as
well as the leathery brain covering called the dura mater, the subarachnoid
space, and the blood vessels and nerves going to and from the brain.
331
Glossary

Intracerebral hemorrhage: Bleeding from an artery within the brain — not in
the subarachnoid space around the brain.
Ischemia (ih SKEEM ee uh): Decreased blood flow to an area of the body,
causing cells in that part of the body to starve due to lack of the oxygen and
glucose the cells are supposed to be getting from the blood. Unlike much of
the rest of the body’s cells, the brain doesn’t tolerate ischemia very well —
even minutes without blood can cause brain damage or even death.
Ischemic stroke: Stroke caused by lack of blood flow (ischemia) — usually
because a blood clot has blocked a blood vessel in the brain. (In this book, I
often refer to ischemic strokes as white strokes.)
Lipid: A fat found in the blood.
Low-density lipoprotein (LDL): One of the fat transporters that carries lipids
in the body, often called the “bad” cholesterol because it deposits fats
throughout the body and causes atherosclerotic plaque, which can lead to
stroke. Studies indicate that lower levels of LDL in the blood mean lower risk
for atherosclerosis, heart disease, and stroke.
Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan: A procedure done with a diagnos-
tic machine that uses a magnetic field and radio waves to produce images of
what’s inside the body. MRI scans have been important in diagnosing types of
stroke because the pictures are clear and help detect certain types of stroke
earlier than other tests.
Microaneurysm: An aneurysm that forms in the very small arteries deep
inside the substance of the brain. They are only a millimeter or so in diam-
eter and are related to hypertension and diabetes.
Neurologist: A doctor who specializes in studying and treating problems with
the brain and nervous system.
Occupational therapist: A healthcare professional trained to help individuals
who suffer disabilities due to stroke or other conditions by teaching them to
become independent in their daily activities, whether in the home or at work.
Physical therapist: A healthcare professional trained to help individuals who
have disabilities due to stroke or other conditions by teaching them to walk
again, use a wheelchair, and perform other physical functions.
Plaque: Deposits of fat and other components that build up in the blood ves-
sels and cause damage and blood clots.
332
Stroke For Dummies 

Red stroke: A term perhaps unique to this book that describes strokes
caused by bleeding, referring to intracerebral hemorrhage and subarach-
noid hemorrhage. I believe this helps visualize and understand what’s hap-
pening with these types of strokes, but your doctor may not know what
you’re talking about if you say red stroke, so it’s a good idea to also become
familiar with the correct terms given in the preceding sentence.
Saturated fats: A fat that is typically solid and found mostly in animal prod-
ucts, such as meat and butter. Eat too much saturated fat, and you increase
your risk of stroke.
Social worker: A healthcare professional trained to help individuals, includ-
ing stroke patients and their families, cope with their situation and pursue
helpful resources.
Sodium: A mineral found in many foods, and in high levels in table salt, that
in excess can aggravate high blood pressure. High blood pressure is the
leading risk factor for stroke.
Spasticity: A condition, linked to stroke as well as other diseases and disabili-
ties, in which limb muscles contract uncontrollably and painfully. See
Chapter 16 for more on spasticity and potential treatments for it.
Spinal tap (lumbar puncture): A fictional rock band that was the subject of a
film called. . . . Okay, actually, in this book anyway, it refers to a test to deter-
mine cause of stroke that involves using a needle to extract spinal fluid from
the lumbar area of the spinal column. Like most rock bands, though, its repu-
tation is much worse than its bite. The procedure is usually no more painful
than having blood drawn from your arm.
Statins or statin drugs: Very handy drugs that are known to simultaneously
raise levels of HDL (“good” cholesterol) in the blood as they lower LDL
(“bad” cholesterol).
Stroke: The sudden interruption of the blood supply to the brain caused by a
blockage of a blood vessel or the rupture of a blood vessel.
Subarachnoid hemorrhage: Bleeding from a ruptured vessel in the subarach-
noid space, which is between the skull and the brain.
Subarachnoid space: The narrow area between the skull and the brain that is
filled with a clear fluid called cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Nerves and blood
vessels traverse this space on their way to and from the brain.
333
Glossary

Systolic blood pressure: A measure of blood pressure when the heart is 
contracting — or forcing the blood in the arteries at its maximum level. The
higher number in your blood pressure reading.
Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA): A clot-dissolving drug approved for
treatment of ischemic stroke when diagnosed and implemented within three
hours of the time that stroke symptoms began. TPA is proven to prevent dis-
ability, but it can cause intracerebral hemorrhage.
Transient ischemic attack (TIA): An ischemic stroke that doesn’t last long
enough to cause apparent permanent damage or infarction.
Triglyceride: A common type of fat found in the diet (vegetable oil, olive oil,
and shortening) as well as our body. High triglyceride levels in the body indi-
cate risk of diabetes.
Vascular dementia: A form of dementia caused by a series of small strokes.
Vein: A blood vessel that carries blood to the heart from various parts of 
the body.
Ventricles of the brain: The four cavities that divide the brain. Ventricles are
filled with fluid that flows from one ventricle to another as well as into the
subarachnoid space surrounding the brain. If the flow is blocked by a clot or
bleeding, pressure builds up in the ventricles and can crush the brain against
the inside of the skull. (It is only a coincidence that the heart has four ventri-
cles as well, two on the right side of the heart and two on the left.)
Warfarin: A drug used to prevent blood clotting, often prescribed to sur-
vivors or others at high risk for ischemic stroke.
White stroke: I made this term up because I think the name ischemic stroke
is hard to read, hard to say, and hard to remember. The brain gets whiter
when its blood supply is cut off. Ischemic stroke just means that the brain
isn’t getting enough red blood. I thought it would help you remember the
cause of ischemic stroke, so I have used this term in this book. You may not
find it used anywhere else, at least not yet. The more I have used the term,
the more I like it. You can thank a friend of mine, Eugene Passamani, a cardiol-
ogist who first told me strokes are like wine — either red or white.
