The Springer book series History of Physics publishes scholarly yet widely accessible 
books on all aspects of the history of physics. These cover the history and evolution 
of ideas and techniques, pioneers and their contributions, institutional history, as well 
as the interactions between physics research and society. Also included in the scope 
of the series are key historical works that are published or translated for the ﬁrst time, 
or republished with annotation and analysis. 
As a whole, the series helps to demonstrate the key role of physics in shaping 
the modern world, as well as revealing the often meandering path that led to our 
current understanding of physics and the cosmos. It upholds the notion expressed 
by Gerald Holton that “science should treasure its history, that historical scholarship 
should treasure science, and that the full understanding of each is deﬁcient without the 
other.” The series welcomes equally works by historians of science and contributions 
from practicing physicists. 
These books are aimed primarily at researchers and students in the sciences, 
history of science, and science studies; but they also provide stimulating reading 
for philosophers, sociologists and a broader public eager to discover how physics 
research – and the laws of physics themselves – came to be what they are today. 
All publications in the series are peer reviewed. Titles are published as both print-
and eBooks. Proposals for publication should be submitted to Dr. Angela Lahee 
(angela.lahee@springer.com) or one of the series editors.

Chapter 1 
Introduction 
This chapter introduces the problem with the concept of energy and gives an overview 
of how it will be dealt with. In presenting the problem, physicists appear ﬁrst, who 
from the end of the nineteenth century to the present day tell us that we have no 
answer to the question of what energy is. This is followed by disagreements between 
physicists, as some deﬁne or characterize energy and others criticize these theses. 
Finally, the authors will be considered who use the substance metaphor. Some of 
these know that energy is not a substance but talk about it as if it were, because they 
cannot ﬁnd anything better. To ﬁnd a solution to the problem, it would be necessary 
to determine what it consists of. To do this, it is important to capture its origin and 
how it developed. The introduction gives an overview of the chapters where this is 
done, as well as of the ﬁnal chapter, which answers the question of the book. 
1.1 
The Problem 
The History of Science teaches us that energy was discovered in the 1840s. Towards 
the end of the century the concept of energy became a problem. This problem has 
never been solved. This is the reason for the present book. 
In the 1880’s, Max Planck participated in a competition whose aim was to clarify 
the concept of energy. For this purpose, he wrote a book The Principle of Conserva-
tion of Energy (1887) in which, however, he pointed out a problem with the energy 
concept that he could not solve. This was the following. According to physics, the 
energy of an isolated system remains constant. Therefore, if energy is a substance, as 
it was understood, it must be somewhere in the system. It is, however, impossible to 
localise the energy in the system (Planck, 1921, p. 117). Hence, Planck considered 
that this concept of energy one day should be overcome (ibid. p. 118). 
A few years later, the already well-known physicist Heinrich Hertz (1894) argued 
categorically: it is not logically permissible to take energy as a substance, since the

Introduction
properties of energy contradict the properties of a substance. He justiﬁes. The quantity 
of a substance does not depend on the existence of other bodies. The potential energy 
of a body does depend on other bodies. Whereas the quantity of a substance is always 
a positive quantity, the potential energy of a system can be negative. Hence, energy 
should not be taken as a substance. A few years later, the French mathematical 
physicist Henri Poincaré came to the conclusion that “it is impossible to ﬁnd a 
general deﬁnition” of energy. (Poincaré, 1901, p. 488) The reason was as follows. 
In each case of energy transformation, it was well known which energy forms were 
involved. Coming up with a concept of energy that encompassed all forms was, 
however, impossible. 
In the twentieth century physics, new theories and forms of energy appeared. 
Despite this development, the Nobel laureate Richard Feynman points out ‘It is 
important to realize that in physics today we have no knowledge of what energy 
is’ (Feynman et al., 1963, Sect. 4–1).1 Towards the end of the century, the ﬁrst of 
Bergmann and Schaefer’s eight volumes of Experimental Physics not only reinforces 
this idea, but also adds that a physicist is in the same situation as a layman when 
it comes to the question of what energy is (Bergmann & Schaefer, 1998, p. 616). 
According to Dransfeld et al. (2001, p. 109) ‘we do not really know what energy is’. 
Other physicists have corroborated this same difﬁculty (Anderson, 2017; Çengel & 
Boles, 2002; Hecht, 2000). 
Although there has been a problem with the concept of energy for decades and 
some physicists even say that we do not know what it is, other physicists deﬁne it. 
This deﬁnition, which tells us that energy is the capacity of doing work, has been 
criticised.2 The point is, however, not the criticism of the deﬁnition but rather the 
fact that energy is deﬁned by some physicists whereas others claim that we do not 
know what it is. One could expect that if energy is deﬁned, we know what it is and, 
if we do not know, no deﬁnition can be given. 
Some physicists do not use this deﬁnition of energy but instead the concept of 
energy which stems from the principle of the conservation of energy. This principle 
tells us that energy cannot be created or destroyed but only transformed. Trying to 
understand energy based on these properties, we can be led to think that energy is 
something that exists because we cannot destroy it and it would be meaningless to 
say that we cannot destroy what does not exist. As energy can only be transformed, 
we are led to think that energy appears in one form and later in another form. This 
reinforces the idea that energy is something that exists and manifests itself in different 
forms. 
Is energy something that exists? Physicists diverge regarding this question. Some 
contemporary physicists take energy as a substance, as we shall see Sect. 5.2, whereas 
others are sure that energy is not a substance (Arons, 1999; Duit, 1987; Feynman 
et al., 1963; Hudson & Nelson, 1982). Contemporary physics, chemistry and biology 
textbooks express energy through the substance metaphor: energy can ﬂow, be stored,

experts in Appendix N.

transported, lost, can change its form, etc. (Lancor, 2014). Some experts in physics 
education propose to use the substance like metaphor in the teaching of energy 
(Brewe, 2011; Fortus et al., 2019; Scherr et al., 2012). Harrer claims that we have no 
alternative to the metaphorical expression of energy: “scientists were and are only 
able to investigate the multifaceted concept of energy by using models that employ 
conceptual metaphors” (Harrer, 2017, p. 454). 
If the concept of energy is so difﬁcult that we are doomed to express it only 
metaphorically, one wonders how it could have been discovered in the 1840s, when 
none of the discoverers (recognized as such by the History of Science) was a physicist. 
Did they discover something so important to science, as the principle of conservation 
of energy is but also so difﬁcult that physicists even today do not know what it is? 
It seems to be so. Nevertheless, a short reﬂection leads us to another question. If we 
do not have a clear idea of what energy is, how can we say that what they discovered 
was energy? In fact, if what they discovered was energy, we only need to focus on 
what they discovered to know what energy is. As a matter of fact, research into the 
history of energy has been going on for decades3 and we still have no answer to the 
question of what energy is. Under these circumstances, we ﬁrst need to know what 
was discovered. This is the subject of the next chapter. 
1.2 
Overview of the Book’s Development 
In Chap. 2, four authors, who are usually taken as discoverers of energy by histo-
rians of science, will be addressed: Robert Mayer, James Joule, Ludvig Colding and 
Hermann von Helmholtz. Each of these authors defended a thesis contrary to the 
prevailing theory of heat, in which none of them was an expert. According to this 
theory, heat is a substance. This thesis had an experimental basis: experiments had 
shown that the quantity of heat was invariant in nature. Each of those four authors 
argued that the amount of heat does vary. The experimental basis of this argument 
lies above all in a ﬁnding by Mayer and Joule. These showed that the quantity of heat 
varies and this variation is correlated with the mechanical action involved. Indeed, 
they determined the number of mechanical units it takes to obtain one thermal unit. 
If this result is taken into account, the amount of heat varies and then heat cannot be 
a substance. 
This conclusion created a new question: if heat it is not a substance, what is it then? 
Regarding this question, the four authors differed from each other. Mayer argued that 
heat is a form of force; Joule said that heat is motion; Colding argued that it is a force

Introduction
of nature; Helmholtz defended that heat is motion. The idea that heat is motion still 
agrees with the theory of heat of the time in the extent to which heat as motion was 
taken as an alternative to heat as a substance. (Indeed, some physicists and chemists 
argued that heat was a substance,4 others that it was motion,5 and still others were 
in doubt about these two theses.6 ) Heat as a form of force was new, it was strange 
to the heat theory of the time. According to whether they adopted the concept of 
heat as motion or heat as force, the same phenomena were seen as ‘conversion’ or 
‘transformation’ respectively. If heat is a form of force and if, for instance, heat is 
produced by a mechanical action, this phenomenon was considered a transformation 
of one force into the other. If heat is motion, the same phenomenon was considered as 
a conversion of one kind of motion into another. For those who take heat as motion, 
the kind of motion was a further question. Thus, in the 1840s, different theories for 
the same phenomena appeared. 
Chapter 3 begins with the question that arises among experts in the theory of heat 
in the late 1840s. On the one hand, there was an experimental ﬁnding: the value 
of the mechanical units necessary to obtain one thermal unit, what was called the 
mechanical equivalent of heat. According to this experimental research, heat can be 
produced by mechanical action or the other way around. In the ﬁrst case, the quantity 
of heat increases and in the second, it decreases. Since the quantity of heat can vary, 
it cannot be a substance. On the other hand, there was a theory of heat based on 
the concept of heat as a substance, Carnot’s theory of heat. Abandoning this theory 
because of those experimental results was out of the question, according to William 
Thomson (later Lord Kelvin) in 1849, because Carnot’s theory was complete and to 
abandon it would create difﬁculties. 
A new input comes then from Clausius (1850). He solves the incompatibility 
between Carnot’s theory and Joule’s experiments and presented the two laws of ther-
modynamics. One law assumes Joule’s experiments and the other, Carnot’s contri-
bution slightly modiﬁed. In 1851, Thomson accepts the thesis that heat is motion 
and creates a new concept: the mechanical activity of a body. ‘Mechanical activity’ 
comprises what a body can do from a strictly mechanical point of view and what it 
can do by virtue of its heat. (Heat could be subsumed by ‘mechanical activity’ since 
heat had become a kind of motion.) This concept of mechanical activity is called, by 
Thomson, the mechanical energy of a body. This is how ‘energy’, an erudite term 
for activity, was introduced into the heat theory. 
Since mechanics was divided into statics and dynamics, Thomson (1852) system-
atizes the reserves of mechanical energy available to mankind into reserves of the 
static kind and reserves of the dynamic kind. In 1853, Rankine adopted Thomson’s 
deﬁnition of mechanical energy but changes his systematization of the reserves. 
Instead of ‘dynamic’, Rankine uses ‘actual’ and what was ‘static’ becomes ‘poten-
tial’. This is not only a change of name, because whereas the static ended with the

beginning of motion, potential energy varies continuously with the dynamic. Thus, it 
could be said that if one of them increases, the other decreases in the same proportion. 
This couple actual and potential, which has its origin in Aristotle’s philosophy, is 
the origin of what we call kinetic and potential energy. 
Several of the concepts considered above were included in textbooks. In Maxwell’s 
Theory of Heat, Rankine’s deﬁnition of energy, Thomson’s deﬁnition of mechanical 
energy of a body, Rankine’s forms of energy (kinetic and potential) and Mayer’s 
forms of energy (his term ‘force’ was translated by ‘energy’) appear together but 
without referring to the authors’ name. Thus, what were different points of view on 
energy appeared as characteristic of energy. Mayer’s forms of energy and Rankine’s 
were not seen as different theses about energy but simply forms of energy, which 
means then that there were two kinds of forms of energy. Understanding energy with 
all these eclectic associations became difﬁcult. 
Chapter 4 is devoted to a new phase of the concept: energy becomes a substance. In 
1873, Maxwell published his Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism. This book will 
play a role in the history of the concept of energy. Accepting Maxwell’s concept of 
electromagnetic ﬁeld, Poynting arrives at the idea that energy moves through space. 
This thesis stems from an interpretation of the algorithm used by him to account for 
electromagnetic phenomena (Poynting, 1884). He himself points out, however, that 
experimental work, which could corroborate or deny the thesis, was still lacking. Even 
though without experimental support, Lodge (1885) defends the thesis that energy 
moves in space and transfers from one body to another or between bodies and the 
ether. This conceptual framework is not only applied to electromagnetic phenomena 
but also to the falling of a stone or the motion of a pendulum. A pendulum oscillates, 
Lodge explains, because energy comes from the aether to the bob of the pendulum 
and back from the bob to the aether, depending on whether the bob is going up or 
down. The concept of aether lost its signiﬁcance in the twentieth century physics. 
Lodge’s theory appears in contemporary textbooks reduced to the idea that energy 
is something that is possessed by bodies and transferred between them. 
Another reiﬁcation of energy comes from Ostwald, who was the Chemistry Nobel 
Prize winner in 1909. He takes up Mayer’s theory but unlike him he substantializes 
energy. Energy becomes the real thing. Ostwald explains, it is the real thing because 
it is the cause of events and their content. Matter and spirit are subsumed by this 
concept of energy: there is no matter and no spirit but only energy. The generalization 
of energy to the various ﬁelds of human activity, including ethics, is rooted here. 
When in the light of this historical background, one looks at contemporary text-
books on general physics (bachelor level), what will be done in Chap. 5, one realizes 
that contemporary concepts of energy and principles of conservation come from 
different theses on the subject that appeared in the nineteenth century. This in itself 
is no objection. On the contrary, it would be nonsense to waste the work done in the 
nineteenth century. The point at issue is only that the theses are not compatible with 
each other. Sometimes they are even contradictory. In order to clarify these diver-
gences, contemporary theses are linked to their origin in that chapter. This enables 
us to verify whether a given thesis was well-founded when it was presented for the 
ﬁrst time or in the course of time.

Introduction
The historical texts that are addressed in the following chapters serve to capture 
the origin of the problem with the concept of energy and how it developed. The 
analysis of these texts is presented in such a way that the reader can follow it step 
by step. The ﬁnal chapter presents the result of this study. This shows where the 
problem presented above lies. This is also the solution we need, because on this basis 
the divergences between physicists are then explained and conceptual difﬁculties 
with energy are overcome. What can be done from this point on is an open question. 
Topics from the history of energy that are not in the problem line but are useful for 
understanding the texts under analysis are dealt with in the appendices. The same goes 
for consequences of the problem of the concept of energy in education, where experts 
have recorded student misconceptions and criticized textbooks. Speciﬁc questions 
concerning the historiography of energy will also be addressed in the appendices.

What Was Discovered in the 1840s? 
This chapter analyzes the texts of the authors considered to be the discoverers of 
energy: Robert Mayer, James Joule, Ludvig Colding and Hermann von Helmholtz. 
Although they have in common that they defend a thesis on heat that was contrary to 
the science of the time, they differ in their interpretation of the experiments, namely 
on the nature of heat, and in the theories they developed. This diversity was mitigated 
when they began to appear as having discovered the same thing. The present analysis 
aims to provide a sharper idea of the authors by focusing on the texts of each of them 
and making a systematic distinction between experiments and interpretations. After 
that, some of their theses will be compared with each other and with the current 
principle of conservation of energy. 
2.1 
Robert Mayer 
Mayer was a physician in clinical activity. The idea of conservation of energy comes 
to him from this practice. He tells us that on a boat trip to Indonesia, where he was 
the doctor on duty, he performed phlebotomies on all the crew members, because 
they all had a lung infection. He was amazed at the clear color of the venous blood.1 
The venous blood was much clearer than he knew from his clinical experience in 
Central Europe. He then concluded that there was a relationship between blood 
color and ambient temperature. The venous blood was darker in Central Europe

erheblicher Krankheitsfall vorgekommen; wenige Tage aber nach unserer Ankunft auf der Rhede 
von Batavia verbreitete sich epidemisch eine acute (katarrhalisch-entzündliche) Affection der 
Lungen. Bei den reichlichen Aderlässen, welche ich machte, hatte aus der Armvene gelassene 
Blut eine ungemeine Röthe, so, dass ich der Farbe nach glauben konnte, eine Arterie getroffen 
zu haben. […] Bei einer reichlichen Aderlässe, welche ich zwei Monate nach unserer Ankunft in 
Java an einem kräftigen, von einer Leberentzündung befallenen Matrosen anstellte, fand ich eine 
normale schwarze Farbe des Blutes” (Mayer, 1845, pp. 84–5) (Appendix C).

because maintaining body temperature required more oxygen consumption than in a 
tropical zone.2 Thus, emerged the idea that became the germ of energy: for something 
to happen (keep the body temperature in a colder area), something has to be done 
(consume more oxygen). ‘Nothing comes from nothing,’ ‘nothing becomes nothing,’ 
‘cause equals effect’. These are the ways he expresses that idea in his published texts. 
At that time, the word ‘energy’ existed in the lexicon but not as a scientiﬁc term. 
It meant ‘activity’.3 Mayer did not use the term energy but rather ‘force’. So, he tells 
us about the indestructibility and transformability of force. This characterization of 
force is transferred to energy shortly after the appearance of this term in the heat 
theory, which occurred in 1851. 
2.1.1 
1842: Heat, Motion and the Equivalent 
In 1842, Mayer publishes his ﬁrst article “Observations on the forces of inorganic 
nature” in the German journal, Annals of Chemistry and Pharmacy. This paper 
addresses two questions: what is to be understood by forces; and how they relate 
to each other.4 The answer to the ﬁrst is “forces are causes.” This statement is not 
justiﬁed. It plays, however, an important role. It serves to apply to forces a classical 
proposition about causes, “causa aequat effectum” (cause equals to effect).5 The 
properties that he draws for causes on the basis of this proposition will then hold true 
for forces. (These properties will be adopted for energy later.)
2 “Aus den bisher betrachteten Gesetzen folgt mit Nothwendigkeit, dass der Temperaturunterschied 
zwischen der Eigenwärme des Organismus und der Wärme des umgebenden Mediums in einer 
Grössenbeziehung mit dem Farbenunterschiede beider Blutarten, des Arterien- und des Venen-
blutes stehen müsse. Je grösser dieser Temperaturunterschied, oder die Kraftproduktion, um so 
grösser muss auch der Farbenunterschied, und je kleiner der Unterschied der Temperatur, um 
so kleiner auch der der Farbe seyn. Dieser Farbenunterschied ist ein Ausdruck für die Grösse 
des Sauerstoffverbrauches, oder für die Stärke des Verbrennungsprocesses im Organismus” (ibid. 
pp. 85–6). 
3 Energy etymologically means activity. The term was used in the eighteenth century. The psycho-
logical sense, for example, was lexicalized in 1798 (Delon, 1988, p. 45). In 1807, Thomas Young 
proposes to use ‘energy’ to deﬁne the quantity, which was called living force, i.e. mass times the 
square of velocity (Young, 1807 pp. 78–9). Throughout the ﬁrst half of the nineteenth century, 
the term energy appears in German, French and English scientiﬁc texts with the sense of activity: 
Seebeck uses it in his lessons (Seebeck, 1822–23, p. 265); Ampère speaks of energy around the 
same time (Ampère, 1822, p. 60); Faraday uses it in 1832 (Faraday, 1832, p. 133, § 34). Mayer uses 
the term in various contexts: he speaks of energy of mechanical effects, (Mayer, 1845, p. 28) energy 
of oxidation processes, (ibid. p. 79); the energy of heat or heat radiation. (ibid. 1848, pp. 23–5) 
Thomson also uses the term in a footnote in the 1849 article on Carnot’s theory, in which he asks the 
question: since nothing can be lost in natural operations, no energy can be destroyed, what about 
heat that produces no mechanical effect? (Thomson, 1849, p. 545). 
4 “Der Zweck folgender Zeile ist, die Beantwortung der Frage zu versuchen, was wir unter “Kräften” 
zu verstehen haben, und wie sich solche untereinander verhalten” (Mayer, 1842, p. 233). 
5 “Kräfte sind Ursachen, mithin ﬁndet auf dieselbe volle Anwendung der Grundsatz: causa aequat 
effectum” (ibid. p. 233). 

2.1 Robert Mayer
11
If the cause is equal to the effect and this effect is, in turn, the cause of another 
effect, then the ﬁrst cause is equal to this second effect (C = E and E = E2, so C  = 
E2). This second effect can, in turn, become the cause of another effect and so on. 
Therefore, C = E = E2 = E3 = …. In this sequence, no element can be greater or 
less than any other. From this Mayer derives a property of causes, that causes are 
indestructible.6 
So far, we have talked about cause and effect in general. Let us now focus on a 
relationship in which we have a given cause and a given effect. Here we realize that 
the cause differs from the effect. We have already admitted, however, that the cause 
is equal to the effect. Hence, we have for our special case of given cause C and given 
effect E, that C = E. We know, however, that C and E differ from each other. Mayer 
makes the two sides compatible as follows: C transforms into E. From here comes 
another property of causes: causes are transformable. 
Now we can return to the initial proposition, “forces are causes.” Since forces 
are causes, the properties of causes apply to forces. Causes are indestructible and 
transformable. Therefore, forces are indestructible and transformable. The following 
then follows. If in a given phenomenon, we have a force F1, which corresponds to 
the cause, and a force F2, which corresponds to the effect, then we can write F1 = 
F2, by virtue of indestructibility, and say that F1 is transformed into F2, by virtue of 
the transformability of forces. 
So far, we have had a theory. How does it apply to phenomena? To deal with 
phenomena, Mayer goes back to the cause-effect relationship. First, he seeks to 
determine whether in a given phenomenon there is a causal relationship. If so, if A 
is the cause of B, then A and B are forces. Then, it holds for A and B what we have 
seen for forces. Let us move on to the phenomena addressed in the paper. 
Motion 
Mayer begins by telling us, how to understand cause and effect in phenomena of 
lifting and falling of bodies. The lifting and falling of a body is understood as follows: 
there is a cause that lifts the body, therefore a force; the body lifted is also a force, 
called the falling force; its effect, the downward motion, is also a force.7 Therefore, 
Mayer continues, they transform into each other.8 
6 “Hat die Ursache c die Wirkung e, so ist  c = e; ist  e wieder die Ursache einer andern Wirkung f , 
so ist e = f , u.s.f. c = e = f … = c. In einer Kette von Ursachen und Wirkungen kann, wie aus 
der Natur einer Gleichung erhellt, nie ein Glied oder ein Theil eines Gliedes zu Null werden. Diese 
erste Eigenschaft aller Ursachen nennen wir ihre Unzerstörlichkeit” (ibid. p. 233). 
7 “Eine Ursache, welche die Hebung einer Last bewirkt, ist eine Kraft; ihre Wirkung, die gehobene 
Last, ist also ebenfalls eine Kraft; […] da diese Kraft den Fall der Körper bewirkt, so nennen wir 
sie Fallkraft” (ibid. p. 235). 
8 “Fallkraft und Fall, und allgemeiner noch Fallkraft und Bewegung sind Kräfte, die sich 
verhalten wie Ursache und Wirkung, Kräfte, die in einander übergehen, zwei verschiedene 
Erscheinungsformen eines und desselben Objectes” (ibid. p. 235).

Quantitative 
The falling force is given by the product of the mass of the body and by the height 
it is at (written with Mayer’s symbols, md).9 Due to the relationship between height 
and falling velocity established in the seventeenth century, the height is equal to the 
square of the velocity (with Mayer’s symbols d = c2).10 Now, since the force of fall 
equals mass times height (md) and height equals the square of velocity (d = c2), it 
follows that the force of fall equals mass times the square of velocity (md = mc2) 
(Mayer, 1842, p. 236). 
Since, according to Mayer’s theory, force is indestructible, it follows that the 
quantity ‘mass times the square of velocity’ is conserved. The conservation of this 
magnitude, called ‘living forces’, was defended by Leibniz (1686) (Appendix B). 
Mayer argues then that the principle of conservation of living forces is based on his 
law of the indestructibility of causes.11 
Connection with the science of that time 
In the Mechanics of that time, weight was said to be a force and the cause of falling. 
Mayer argues against this thesis. The lifting of the weight is no less necessary to 
the fall than weight. Therefore, weight cannot be seen as the cause of falling.12 
From the point of view of his own theory he argues: designating weight by force 
contradicts the characteristics of force—being indestructible and transformable— 
because weight does not decrease with the fall.13 Thus, he claims that weight is a 
property14 and that the force of falling consists in the spatial difference of ponderable 
objects.15 
9 “Die Größe der Fallkraft v steht […] mit der Größe der Masse m und mit der ihrer Erhebung d, in 
geradem Verhältnisse; v = md” (ibid. p. 236). 
10 “Geht die Erhebung d = 1 der Masse m in Bewegung dieser Masse von der Endgeschwindigkeit 
c = 1 über, so wird auch v = mc; aus den bekannten zwischen d und c stattﬁndenden Relationen 
ergiebt sich aber für andere Werthe von d oder c, mc2 als das Maß der Kraft v” (ibid. p. 236). 
11 “also v = md = mc2; das Gesetz der Erhaltung lebendiger Kräfte ﬁnden wir in dem allgemeinen 
Gesetze der Unzerstörbarkeit der Ursachen begründet” (ibid. p. 236). 
12 “Um daß ein Körper fallen könne, dazu ist seine Erhebung nicht minder nothwendig, als seine 
Schwere, man darf daher auch letzterer allein den Fall der Körper nicht zuschreiben” (ibid. p. 236). 
13 “gerade das, was jeder Kraft wesentlich zukommen muß, die Vereinigung von Unzerstörlichkeit 
und Wandelbarkeit, geht jedweder Eigenschaft ab […] Heißt man die Schwere eine Kraft, so denkt 
man sich damit eine Ursache, welche, ohne selbst abzunehmen, Wirkung hervorbringt, hegt damit 
also unrichtige Vorstellungen über den ursächlichen Zusammenhang der Dinge” (ibid. pp. 235–6). 
14 “Indem man die Schwere als Ursache des Falls betrachtet, spricht man von einer Schwerkraft 
und verwirrt so die Begriffe von Kraft und Eigenschaft […] zwischen einer Eigenschaft und einer 
Kraft, zwischen Schwere und Bewegung läßt sich deßhalb auch nicht die für ein richtig gedachtes 
Causalverhältniß nothwendige Gleichung aufstellen” (ibid. pp. 235–6). 
15 “räumliche Differenz ponderabler Objecte ist eine Kraft; da diese Kraft den Fall der Körper 
bewirkt, so nennen wir sie Fallkraft” (ibid. p. 235).

Heat and motion 
Mayer approaches phenomena involving heat and motion in the same way as the 
previous ones. First, he tries to make sure, whether a cause-effect relationship can 
be established between both motion and heat.16 He concludes from his observation 
that such a relationship exists. Then heat and motion are taken as forces. 
Among his observations that led him to that idea, one was particularly important. 
He reports an experiment that he had carried out: a vigorous agitation of the water in 
a test tube raised its temperature by 12° centigrade. This experiment about which no 
details are given, was decisive for Mayer’s thesis. One sees that motion disappears 
and heat appears. It can be said that the motion performed had an effect. Then motion 
can be seen as the cause of the heat. In light of this experiment and “many” other 
cases (he refers to everyday observations), Mayer argues that he prefers to admit that 
heat comes from motion, rather than admit that there is a cause without effect or an 
effect without cause.17 Steam engines provide Mayer with an example of the reverse 
causation, from heat into motion.18 Having admitted the cause-effect relationship 
for motion and heat, motion and heat are then forces. Mayer then moves on to the 
numerical determination of this relationship, which has the following experimental 
basis. 
Quantitative 
It was known at that time that if a gas is heated and the piston of the container in 
which the gas is, is movable, the volume increases but the pressure remains the same. 
On the contrary, if the piston does not move, the pressure increases but the volume 
does not change. It was also known that the heat required to raise the temperature of 
a certain amount of atmospheric air when the piston is moveable was greater than 
the heat required to raise the same amount of air from the same temperature when 
the piston is ﬁxed (Fig. 2.1). Now, since in the ﬁrst case, there is movement (the gas 
moves the piston), and in the second, there is not, but in the ﬁrst case more heat is 
required than in the second, Mayer relates this excess of heat to the movement made.
Using the experimental values available at that time, Mayer was able to determine 
which quantity of heat corresponds to that motion. Now, he made another step. If to 
a quantity of heat corresponds a certain mechanical value, then to the thermal unit 
corresponds x.Thus,hearrivedatthemechanical equivalent of heat. This is expressed
16 “Um uns über dieses Verhältniß zu vergewissern, müssen wir die Frage erörtern, hat nicht in 
den zahllosen Fällen, in denen unter Aufwand von Bewegung Wärme zum Vorschein kommt, die 
Bewegung eine andere Wirkung als die Wärmeproduktion und die Wärme eine andere Ursache als 
die Bewegung?” (ibid. p. 237). 
17 “Ist es nun ausgemacht, daß für die verschwindende Bewegung in vielen Fällen (exceptio 
conﬁrmat regulam) keine andere Wirkung gefunden werden kann, als die Wärme, für die entstandene 
Wärme keine andere Ursache als die Bewegung, so ziehen wir die Annahme, Wärme entsteht aus 
Bewegung, der Annahme einer Ursache ohne Wirkung und einer Wirkung ohne Ursache vor” (ibid. 
p. 238). 
18 “umgekehrt dienen wieder die Dampfmaschinen zur Zerlegung der Wärme in Bewegung oder 
Lasterhebung. Die Locomotive mit ihrem Convoi ist einem Destillirapparate zu vergleichen; die 
unter dem Kessel angebrachte Wärme geht in Bewegung über” (ibid. p. 239).

heatsource 
Fig. 2.1 The center container represents the initial situation of the gas in the container. Placed on 
the heat source, the gas heats up and expands (on the left). In this case, the pressure is constant. If 
the plunger is ﬁxed (right), the gas heats up without changing its volume
as follows: heating a given quantity of water by 1° centigrade, more exactly from 0 
to 1 °C, corresponds to the falling of a body of equal mass from a height of 365 m.19 
(In current units, it is 1 cal = 3.58 J.) 
Conclusion 
In Mayer’s dealing with phenomena, we have two steps: 
– Determine whether there is a cause-effect relationship; 
– Establish the quantitative relationship between the magnitudes involved. The 
mechanical equivalent of heat is a consequence of this relationship. 
The attribution to a phenomenon of the cause-effect relationship is based on obser-
vation. Mayer makes sure that he can establish a relationship between observable 
elements of the phenomenon at stake. A body at some point, if dropped, falls. This 
is the reason for attributing the cause-effect relationship to this phenomenon. In the 
other case, he stirred water and the water heated up. Thus, the motion is cause and 
the heat, effect. The steam engine received heat from the furnace and produced a 
pendulum motion at the top. So, heat was the cause and motion, the effect. When 
the cause-effect relation applies to a phenomenon, then it follows that ‘cause = 
effect’ applies. Now, when he deals with phenomena, he had already introduced
19 “Unter Anwendung der aufgestellten Sätze auf die Wärme- und Volumensverhältnisse der 
Gasarten ﬁndet man die Senkung einer ein Gas comprimirenden Quecksilbersäule gleich der 
durch die Compression entbundenen Wärmemenge und es ergiebt sich hieraus,—den Verhältniß-
exponenten der Capacitäten der atmosphärischen Luft unter gleichem Drucke und unter gleichem 
Volumen = 1,421 gesetzt, daß dem Herabsinken eines Gewichtstheiles von einer Höhe circa 365m, 
die Erwärmung eines gleichen Gewichttheiles Wasser von 0˚ auf 1˚ entspreche” (ibid. p. 240).

the concept of force, so ‘force (cause) = force (effect)’ applies. This justiﬁes then 
Mayer’s equalization of the quantities representing force-cause and force-effect: 
– mass times height (force-cause) with the product of mass by the square of velocity 
(force-effect); 
– the difference between the values of the heats at constant pressure and constant 
volume (force-cause) with weight times height (force-effect). 
2.1.1.1
Concerning the Principle of Conservation of Energy 
Determinative for the acceptance of the principle of the conservation of energy was 
the mechanical equivalent of heat as we shall see. Mayer determined it for the ﬁrst 
time in history in this article. 
The usual formulation of the principle of the conservation of energy says: energy 
can neither be created nor destroyed, but only transformed. If energy cannot be 
destroyed, then it is indestructible; if it is transformed, then it is transformable. Here 
we have the characteristics of Mayer’s force: indestructibility and transformability. 
‘Indestructibility’ tells us that the quantity of force does not change. With regard 
to transformability, Mayer felt the need to clarify it. Motion turning into heat tells 
us nothing about the nature of heat. He does not consider for example that heat is 
motion, what it would mean to know something about the nature of heat. On the 
contrary, he even intends to conclude the opposite, that is, that motion disappears to 
give way to heat,20 which corresponds to what is observed. 
In sum, the concept ‘force is indestructible and transformable’ was created by 
Mayer but it was not designed to convey knowledge about the phenomena at stake 
that is beyond the observable or measurable data. The nature of heat, which refers to 
a deep knowledge of phenomena, is not at issue. 
2.1.2 
1845: Forms of Force and the Equivalent 
In 1845, Mayer published a book at his own expense, The Organic Movement in 
Connection with Metabolism. Forces are now systematized into ﬁve forms: falling 
force, motion, heat (which already appeared in the 42 article), magnetism and elec-
tricity, separation and chemical bonding. The task of physics would then be to prove 
the “metamorphoses” of the 5 forms through 25 types of experiments.21 Completely
20 “So wenig indessen aus dem zwischen Fallkraft und Bewegung bestehenden Zusammenhange 
geschlossen werden kann: das Wesen der Fallkraft sey Bewegung, so wenig gilt dieser Schluß für 
die Wärme. Wir möchten vielmehr das Gegentheil folgern, daß um zu Wärme werden zu können, 
die Bewegung […] aufhören müsse, Bewegung zu seyn” (ibid. p. 239). 
21 “An die Aufstellung von fünf Hauptformen der physischen Kraft reiht sich die Aufgabe, die 
Metamorphosen dieser Formen durch fünfundzwanzig Experimente zu beweisen” (Mayer, 1845, 
p. 34). 25 corresponds to the number of possible transformations between the various forms, which 
gives 20 in total, plus 5 arising from changes with maintenance of form.

new compared to the article of 42 is the generalization of the concept of force to 
the organic domain.22 New is also the classical dictum:”Ex nihilo nil ﬁt. Nil ﬁt ad  
nihilum” (Nothing comes from nothing. Nothing becomes nothing) (ibid. p. 5). This 
statement is, however, equivalent to ‘causa aequat effectum’. As in 1842, the cause 
is said to be force and so is the effect. The force remains in quantity and only the 
form can vary.23 Let us move on to phenomena. 
Motion into motion 
A white ball collides frontally and elastically with a red ball. The white ball loses 
its motion and the red ball moves on with the velocity of the white one.24 The 
interpretation given is as follows: the motion of the white ball was the one that spent 
and originated that of the red one, it transformed into the latter.25 The conservation of 
the quantity of force is justiﬁed in the following terms: the motion of the white ball is 
a force; the motion of the red ball is its effect; therefore, it is the same as the motion 
of the white ball. Thus, there was transformation, from motion into motion, and the 
quantity of force remained the same. In this way Mayer subsumes the conservation 
of the living forces for the elastic collision in his theory.26 
The Leibnizian principle of living forces is subsumed as in the 1842 paper (Mayer, 
1845, pp. 7–9). The relationship between motion and heat is treated anew in this book 
but with more detail than in the 42 paper. The calculation which had led to the value 
of the mechanical equivalent of heat, is now made explicit as follows. 
Heat and motion 
The experimental basis is the same as in the paper addressed above. To increase the 
temperature of a given quantity of gas without changing its volume, we need a certain 
amount of heat x, says Mayer (Fig. 2.2). In order to obtain the same temperature 
increase without changing the pressure, (allowing for a change in volume) a greater 
amount of heat is needed, be it x + y.27 Since in one case there was a volume variation 
and in the other there was not, and the amounts of heat used for the same temperature
22 “ Es giebt in Wahrheit nur eine einzige Kraft. In ewigem Wechsel kreist dieselbe in der todten 
wie in der lebenden Natur. Dort und hier kein Vorgang ohne Formveränderung der Kraft!” (ibid. 
p. 6). 
23 “Die Wirkung ist gleich der Ursache. Die Wirkung der Kraft ist wiederum Kraft. Die quantitative 
Unveränderlichkeit des Gegebenen ist ein oberstes Naturgesetz, das sich auf gleiche Weise über 
Kraft und Materie erstreckt” (ibid. p. 5). 
24 “Stösst der weisse Ball den Rothen central an, so verliert der Weisse seine Bewegung und der 
Rothe geht mit dessen Geschwindigkeit fort” (ibid. p. 7). 
25 “Die Bewegung des Weissen ist es, welche aufgewendet die Bewegung des Rothen hervorge-
bracht, oder sich in die letztere verwandelt hat” (ibid. p. 7). 
26 “Die Grösse der Kraft aber, oder die sogenannte “lebendige Kraft der Bewegung” ist vor und 
nach dem Stosse constant geblieben” (ibid. p. 7). 
27 “Angenommen, ein Kubikzoll Luft von 0° und 27 Zoll Quecksilber Druck, sey durch die 
Wärmemenge x bei constantem Volumen um 274 °C. erwärmt worden […] Ein andermal aber 
werde unser Cubikzoll Luft nicht unter constantem Volumen, sondern unter constantem Drucke 
der 27zölligen Quecksilbersäule von 0 auf 274˚ erwärmt. Diessmal ist eine grössere Wärmemenge 
erforderlich als zuvor; es sey dieselbe = x + y” (ibid. p. 12).

Fig. 2.2 Illustration of the 
experimental set up on which 
Mayer based his calculations. 
In both recipients, the 
temperature of the air 
increases by 1 °C. In the ﬁrst 
case, the volume is constant, 
in the second, the pressure is 
constant. (The height h is not 
as large as represented.) 
increase are in one case x + y and in the other case only x, Mayer relates the difference 
between the heats used in the two cases, that is y, to the mechanical effect produced.28 
The determination of the value of y is based on experimental results of the time. 
Let us move on to the ﬁgures. For calculation purposes, Mayer uses 1 cm3 of 
atmospheric air at 0 °C and at the pressure of 76 cm of mercury. Heating the gas 
from 1 °C at constant pressure leads to a volume increase of 1/274 of the initial 
volume, which in this case means 1/274 cm. 
As the gas lifts the air above the piston and this air balances a column of mercury 
76 cm high (Fig. 2.3), the weight supported by the gas is equal to that of this column 
of mercury, i.e., 1033 g.
The product of the weight lifted by the height (falling force) is equal to 
1033 ti mes StartFraction 1 Over 274 EndFraction equals 3.77 g cm
1033  times St artFraction 1 Over 274 EndFraction equals 3.77 g cm
This mechanical effect is caused by the difference between the heat necessary to 
increase the temperature at constant pressure (x + y) and constant volume (x). The 
value of this difference (0.000347–0.000244) is 0.000103° of heat. Now, if 0.000103° 
of heat corresponds to 3.77 g cm, then 1° corresponds to a given value

Mayer says, 1° corresponds to the mechanical effect of a gram at a height of 
367 m.29 
28 “Bei der Vergleichung dieser Vorgänge sehen wir in beiden die Luft von 0 auf 274° sich erwärmen 
und zugleich von einem Volumen auf zwei Volumina sich ausbreiten; im ersten Falle war die 
erforderliche Wärmemenge = x, im zweiten = x + y; im ersten Falle war der gelieferte mechanische 
Effekt = 0, im zweiten = 15 [Gewicht] […] und 1” Höhe” (ibid. p. 12). 
29 “Ein Kubikcentimeter atmosphärische Luft bei 0° und 0 m,76 Barometer, wiegt 0.0013 Gramme; 
bei constantem Drucke um 1 ˚C. erwärmt, dehnt sich die Luft um 1/274 ihres Volumens aus und 
hebt somit eine Quecksilbersäule von einem Quadratcentimeter Grundﬂäche und 76 cm Höhe um

To give the result in actual units, we have to change centimeters to meters 
(366.02 g m), grams to kilograms (0.36602 kg m) and multiply by the accelera-
tion of gravity (g = 9.8 m s−2) to get weight. This gives 3.59 J. If we use the value 
given by Mayer, we obtain 0.367 times 9.8 e quals 3.6 upper J. 
Electricity and motion 
Let us move on to the connection between electricity and mechanical force. This 
connection is exempliﬁed by an electrophorus. This is the apparatus pictured in 
Fig. 2.4, consisting of a base, a conducting plate and an insulating grip. The base 
could be made of glass or resin (Appendix E) and must be electriﬁed by friction.
The upper part of the electrophorus, the plate, produces an electrical effect under 
certain conditions (if we bring a ﬁnger close, we get an electric shock). By lifting 
the plate, we can obtain a new effect (another electric shock). By letting the upper 
part go down to its initial position, we get another electric effect, and so on. Mayer 
puts forward the following reasoning. If the base is not electricized, the weight of the 
plate has a certain value P (Fig. 2.5a). If the base is electricized, it attracts the plate.
1/274 cm. Das Gewicht dieser Säule beträgt 1033 Gramme. Die speciﬁsche Wärme der atom-
sphärischen Luft ist bei constantem Drucke, die des Wassers = 1 gesetzt, nach Delaroche und 
Bérard = 0.267; die Wärmemenge, die unser Kubikcentimeter Luft aufnimmt, um bei constantem 
Drucke von 0 auf 1˚ zu kommen, ist also der Wärme gleich, durch welche 0.0013 × 0.267 oder 
0.000347 Gramme Wasser um 1˚ erhöht werden. Nach Dulong […] verhält sich die Wärmemenge, 
welche die Luft bei constantem Volumen aufnimmt, zu der bei constantem Drucke, wie 1:1,421; 
hiernach gerechnet ist die Wärmemenge, die unseren Kubikcentimeter Luft bei constantem Volumen 
um 1°erhöht, = StartFraction 0.000347 Over 1.421 EndFraction
StartFraction 0.000347 Over 1.421 EndFraction
= 0.000244 Grad. Es ist folglich die Differenz y = 0.0003470 – 0.000244 
= 0.000103 Grad Wärme, durch deren Aufwand das Gewicht P = 1033 Gramme auf h = 1/274 cm, 
gehoben wurde. Durch Reduktion dieser Zahlen ﬁndet man nun 1° Wärme = 1Grm. auf 367 m […]

To balance it in this case, we need a larger counterweight, be it P + h (Fig. 2.5b). 
Now, we can get an electric effect, z. To lift the plate, we need a force greater than P 
+ h, say  P + h + x (Fig. 2.5c). 
When raised, another electrical effect, z', can be obtained. In each process (down— 
electric shock, up—electric shock) a force x is expended and effects z and z' are 
obtained. Since a force x is expended and an electrical effect z + z' is gained, Mayer 
puts30 
x equals z
 plus z prime
In his terminology, the mechanical effect turned into electricity.31 The argument 
is as follows:
30 “[…] Auf der Unterscheibe liegend ist der Deckel im Stande einen elektrischen Effekt auszuüben; 
dieses ist geschehen, derselbe ist bestimmt worden und = z gefunden. Jetzt ist die Anziehung noch 
verstärkt und zur Hebung des Deckels bedarf es eines noch grösseren Gegengewichtes; das Produkt 
desselben in seine Höhe wird > Ph + p; es sey = Ph + p + x. Auf h erhalten wir den zweiten el. 
Effekt z’ u.s.f. Bei jeder Senkung ist nun das gewonnene Produkt = Ph + p, bei jeder Erhebung 
aber das verlorene Produkt = Ph + p + x. Während wir also jedesmal einen mechanischen Effekt 
= x aufwenden, gewinnen wir den el. Effekt z + z’. So ist folglich: x = z + z’” (ibid. pp. 23–4). 
31 “der mechanische Effekt ist in Elektrizität verwandelt worden” (ibid. p. 24).

– the electricity in the lower part of the electrophorus remains constant, so it cannot 
have given rise to the electrical phenomena; 
– on the other hand, a mechanical effect took place; 
– therefore, either one admits that the mechanical effect had no consequence and 
the electrical effects came out of nothing—a ‘double paradox’—or, admitting 
that ‘nothing comes from nothing’, one concludes that the mechanical effect was 
transformed into electricity.32 
Another example of the transformation of mechanical effect into electricity is 
given by electricity obtained by friction.33 Mayer remarks that in such a case, the 
heat of friction is missing.34 Therefore, where friction produces electricity, it does 
not produce heat. 
Chemical separation and junction 
The ﬁfth of the main forms of force is said to be chemical difference or chemically 
separate existence.35 This form of force is introduced through an analogy with the 
force resulting from lifting a body: just as the ‘mechanical separation of the earth’— 
that is, a body at a certain height from the ground—represents a force, so does 
chemical separation. The argument for the analogy is as follows: by the expenditure 
of the force of mechanical separation—thus by the fall—heat is produced; by the 
joining of some substances heat is also produced.36 
One of the examples given is that of the joining of 1 g of hydrogen with 8 g of 
oxygen. The developed heat, known at the time (34,743°) is compared to the heat 
resulting from a falling body. It is equivalent to the heat resulting from a falling body 
‘weighing’ two grams, coming from the limit of the action of attraction to the ground 
(34,700°).37 
32 “Aus Nichts wird Nichts. Die Elektrizität des Harzkuchens kann, da sie sich unvermindert 
erhalten hat, die fortlaufende Summe el. Effekte nicht hervorgebracht haben; der bei jedem Turnus 
verschwundene mechanische Effekt kann nicht zu Null geworden seyn. Was bleibt übrig, wenn man 
sich nicht in einem doppelten Paradoxon gefällt? nichts, als auszusprechen: der mechanische Effekt 
ist in Eletrizität verwandelt worden” (ibid. p. 24). 
33 “Die Erzeugung der Reibungs-Elektrizität erfolgt ebenfalls unter dem Aufwande von mechanis-
chem Effekt” (ibid. p. 25). 
34 “Bekannt ist auch, dass bei der Bildung von Reibungs-Elektrizität die Reibungswärme fehlt” 
(ibid. p. 25). 
35 “Das chemisch-getrennt Vorhandenseyn, oder kürzer: die chemische Differenz der Materie ist 
eine Kraft” (ibid. p. 28).  
36 “Den räumlichen Abstand der Masse, in specie der Erde und eines Gewichtes, haben wir oben als 
eine Kraft kennen gelernt. Ein Gramme-Gewicht in unendlicher Entfernung—oder wie wir kürzer 
sagen wollen: in mechanischer Trennung von der Erde, stellt eine Kraft dar; durch den Aufwand 
dieser Kraft, d. h. durch die mechanische Verbindung beider Massen, wird eine andere Kraft erzeugt: 
die Bewegung eines Gramme-Gewichtes mit der Geschwindigkeit von 34450’; durch den Aufwand 
dieser Bewegung lässt sich ein Gramme Wasser um 17356° erwärmen. Die Erfahrung lehrt nun, dass 
derselbe Effekt, wie bei der mechanischen Verbindung, eine Wärmeentwicklung nemlich, erzielt 
wird durch die chemische Verbindung gewisser Materien” (ibid. pp. 26–8).

nach Dulong = 34743˚ angenommen) mit 8 Gramme Sauerstoff ist äquivalent der mechanischen

Organic phenomena 
Most of the 1845 book is devoted to living beings. Organic phenomena are treated 
analogously to inorganic ones, as we shall see. Plants perform a given activity, but 
only if they have sunlight. Thus, their activity does not arise from nothing.38 In 
the case of animals, continues Mayer, the chemical force of food and the oxygen 
absorbed by breathing is at the origin of the movements they perform and the heat 
they develop.39 This would justify why a person in activity needs more chemical 
force than a person at rest. Mayer gives numerical examples from studies carried out 
at the time: the amounts of feed for horses at rest and in motion were different40 ; the  
feeding of prisoners, who are at rest, soldiers in the barracks or workers under great 
physical exertion differed.41 The available data therefore showed that with increased 
activity more chemical force is needed. 
The similitude in the treatment of the organic and inorganic may be sharper, as 
the following. Just as the heat supplied to a gas at constant pressure, say x, serves to  
increase the temperature of y and have a mechanical effect of z, so the heat corre-
sponding to the oxidation process taking place in muscles, say x', is equivalent to 
the heat released, y', and the mechanical effect produced, z'. In one case, therefore, 
it holds 
x equals 
y plus z
Verbindung von 2 Gramme Gewicht mit der Erde; die Wärmeentwicklung bei beiden ist = 34700˚” 
(ibid. p. 28). 
The meaning of ‘coming from the limit of action of attraction to the ground’ is the following: 
“Der Begriff einer unendlichen Entfernung ist hier im physischen und nicht im mathematischen 
Sinne zu nehmen, und unter demselben “die physische Grenze der Anziehungssphäre” der Erde zu 
verstehen [...] Setzt man beispielsweise statt einer unendlichen Entfernung von der Erde eine von 
10000 Erdhalbmessern, so genügt eine solche für die hier betrachteten Fälle vollkommen” (ibid. 
p. 27). 
38 “Die Erschaffung einer physischen Kraft, schon an und für sich selbst kaum denkbar, erscheint 
um so paradoxer, wenn man die Erfahrung berücksichtigt, dass die Pﬂanze einzig mit Hülfe des 
Sonnenlichtes ihre Leistung zu vollbringen im Stande ist” (ibid. p. 40). 
39 “Die chemische Kraft, welche in den eingeführten Nahrungsmitteln und in dem eingeathmeten 
Sauerstoffe enthalten ist, ist also die Quelle zweier Kraftäusserungen, der Bewegung und der Wärme, 
und die Summe der von einem Thiere producirten physischen Kräfte ist gleich der Grösse des 
gleichzeitig erfolgenden chemischen Processes” (ibid. pp. 45–6). 
40 “Ein starkes Pferd, das Tag für Tag der Ruhe pﬂegen darf, wird mit 15 […] Heu und 5 […] Hafer 
reichlich genährt; hat aber jezt das Thier, wie oben angenommen wurde, täglich 12'960000 […] 1’ 
hoch zu heben, so kann es bei dieser Nahrung offenbar nicht bestehen. Wir legen ihm, um es in 
gutem Stande zu erhalten, 11 […] Hafer […] zu” (ibid. p. 51). 
41 “Nach Liebig […] erhalten die Gefangenen im Arresthause in Giessen, denen jede Bewegung 
mangelt, täglich 17 Loth (64 Lth. = 1 Kil.) Kohlenstoff. […] Ein kasernirter Soldat geniesst täglich 
[…] 29 Loth Kohlenstoff. Gönnen wir aber unserem Arbeiter zur Vollbringung seiner schweren 
Leistung noch weitere 8 Loth, so wird er täglich 36 Loth einführen […] Davon verwendet er zu 
mechanischem Effekte […]” (ibid. p. 52).

In another passage, the elasticity of a gas is analogized to the irritability of muscles: 
without heat, the gas has no elasticity; and without a chemical process, there is no 
irritability. The reason for this analogy is this: where nothing is, nothing can be 
transformed either.43 
Conclusion 
In dealing with phenomena, Mayer establishes a causal relationship between observ-
ables; and establishes an equivalence between the quantities that express the terms 
of this relationship. If he does not have numerical data, the equivalence is expressed 
formally (as in the case of the electrophorus). The justiﬁcation for equivalence is given 
by the principle ‘nothing comes from nothing and nothing becomes nothing’.44 This 
principle being valid, one cannot admit ‘a plus or a minus’  in any of the members 
of a cause-effect relationship, says Mayer.45 The approach to biological processes is 
based on this same principle. It implies, he claims, that there is only transformation 
of force or matter, but never creation.46 
42 “Wenn zu einer unter constantem Drucke sich beﬁndenden Gasart eine bestimmte Menge von 
Wärme= x hinzutritt, so wird ein Theil dieser Wärme zur Temperaturerhöhung des Gases verwendet, 
und dieser Theil = y besteht als freie Wärme fort, ein anderer Theil wird “latent” und bringt den 
mechanischen Effekt = z hervor. Es ist nun x = y + z. 
Setzen wir den in den Cappilaren eines Muskels vor sich gehenden Oxydationsprocess, oder die 
diesem entsprechende Wärme = x’, die wirklich entwickelte freie Wärme = y’, und den gelieferten 
mechanischen Effekt = z’, so ist wieder x’ = y’ + z’” (ibid. pp. 98–9). 
43 “Da die Elasticität der Gase und die Irritabilität der Muskeln Eigenschaften sind, die sich auf die 
Metamorphose gegebener Kräfte beziehen, so ist die Existenz dieser Eigenschaften nothwendig an 
die Existenz der respectiven Kräfte geknüpft. Wo nichts ist, da lässt sich auch nichts umwandeln. 
Ohne Wärme ist keine Elasticität, ohne chemische Differenz, oder ohne chemischen Process, keine 
Irritabilität denkbar” (ibid. p. 100). 
44 “Aus dem Angeführten geht zur Genüge hervor, dass die höchst werthvollen Versuche der 
genannten Naturforscher, weit entfernt, eine Widerlegung des Grundsatzes: ex nihilo nil ﬁt zu 
enthalten, vielmehr die angefochtene Wahrheit auf dem Erfahrungswege bestätigen” (ibid. p. 49). 
“Ein gewandter Schmied bringt ein kaltes Stück Eisen durch Hämmern in’s Glühen; diese Wärme 
aber entsteht auf Kosten der Temperatur seines Armes. Ex nihilo nil ﬁt” (ibid. pp. 95–6). 
45 “Sammelt man die in einer gewissen Zeit von einem Thiere gelieferten mechanischen 
Kraftäusserungen, verwandelt dieselben […] in Wärme, und addirt hiezu die in gleicher Zeit von 
dem Körper unmittelbar entwickelte Wärme, so wird man genau die Wärmemenge erhalten, welche 
dem stattgehabten chemischen Processe an und für sich entspricht. Auf der einen oder der anderen 
Seite ein Plus oder Minus anzunehmen, verbietet das Gesetz des logischen Grundes Ex nihilo nil 
ﬁt; nil ﬁt ad nihilum” (ibid. p. 46). 
46 “Der Verfasser glaubt daher auf das Einverständniss seiner Leser rechnen zu dürfen, wenn er der 
folgenden Untersuchung als axiomatische Wahrheit den Satz unterlegt: dass während des Leben-
sprocesses nur eine Umwandlung, so wie der Materie, so der Kraft, niemals aber eine Erschaffung 
der einen oder der anderen vor sich gehe” (ibid. p. 40).

‘Transformation’ is the term generally used, although ‘metamorphosis’ also 
appears, with the same sense, sometimes even with the same referent.47 These terms 
do not explain, however, the underlying natural process. He stresses, the transforma-
tion of chemical force into mechanical effect, which is manifested in the action of 
muscles, occurs in a secret way to us.48 With ‘transformation of heat into mechanical 
effect’ a ‘fact’ is expressed, he says, but in no way did he explain the transformation. 
He clariﬁes this with an example. 
A piece of ice turns into water. This is a ‘fact’. It is a fact of observation: we had ice 
and now we have water. The observation fact, he adds, does not depend on questions 
about how and why this happens. Therefore, by saying that ice turned into water, one 
is not adding something about the melting of ice that is not observable. However, 
there is more. Mayer distances himself from such questions. He says that these are 
fruitless questions, proper to poets and philosophers of nature.49 Thus, according to 
what he said about transformation and the dichotomy between positive knowledge 
and matters of fantasy, Mayer distances himself from an explanation of phenomena. 
Therefore, transformation does not explain the natural processes involved. The term 
is used to relate observables, which in phenomena are viewed as cause and effect. 
2.1.2.1
Concerning the Principle of Conservation of Energy 
The principle of conservation of energy tells us that energy can neither be created 
nor destroyed but only transformed. We may understand that an entity that cannot 
be destroyed or created must exist for ever. As energy is this entity then energy is 
conserved. Thus, the principle of conservation of energy justiﬁes this conservation 
through its content. 
Mayer formulated the principle, which he calls axiom, as follows: 
Bei allen physikalischen und chemischen Vorgängen bleibt die gegebene Kraft eine constante 
Grösse (ibid. p. 32) 
‘In all physical and chemical processes, the given force remains a constant magnitude.’ 
If we replace force by energy, only to make the proposition more accessible to 
comparison, Mayer’s principle states:
47 When for example the 25 experiments for the ﬁve main forms of forces are referred to, the 
experiments are presented as metamorphoses (Metamorphosen) and in the speciﬁcation of the 
experiments appears transformation (Umwandlung, Verwandlung) (ibid. pp. 34–5). 
48 “Die Action des Muskels, die Umwandlung von chemischer Kraft in mechanischen Effekt, 
wird auf geheimnissvolle Weise durch einen Contact-Einﬂuss bedingt, der erfahrungsgemäss dem 
Nervensysteme zukommt” (ibid. pp. 106–7). 
49 “Wenn hier eine Verwandlung der Wärme in mechanischen Effekt statuirt wird, so soll damit 
nur eine Thatsache ausgesprochen, die Verwandlung selbst aber keineswegs erklärt werden. Ein 
gegebenes Quantum Eis lässt sich in eine entsprechende Menge Wassers verwandeln; diese That-
sache steht fest da und unabhängig von unfruchtbaren Fragen über Wie und Warum und von 
gehaltlosen Speculationen über den letzten Grund der Aggregats-Zustände. Die ächte Wissenschaft 
begnügt sich mit positiver Erkenntniss und überlässt es willig dem Poëten und Naturphilosophen, 
die Auﬂösung ewiger Räthsel mit Hülfe der Phantasie zu versuchen” (ibid. p. 10).

‘In all physical and chemical processes, energy is a constant magnitude.’ 
If energy is a constant magnitude, then it can be said that energy is conserved. The 
principle of the conservation of energy based on Mayer’s axiom would then state: 
‘energy is conserved’. In this form, there is no entity with the properties of energy 
that justify that energy is conserved. Consequently, there is no ontological issue. 
In sum, the principle of conservation of energy tells us why energy is conserved. 
As this is due to an entity called energy, we are led to ask the question of what this 
entity is. Mayer’s principle tells us that energy is conserved but it does not justify 
this content by means of the being of energy. Without this being, we do not ask about 
it. 
2.1.3 
1848: Solar Heat and the Equivalent 
In 1848, Mayer publishes a second book at his own expense, Contributions to Celes-
tial Dynamics. A Popular Presentation. The subject of the book is the origin of solar 
heat. Mayer defends the thesis that solar heat comes from falling bodies on the surface 
of the Sun. The argument develops as follows. First, he considers the possible sources 
of heat. Second, he estimates the magnitude of the heat coming from the sun. On the 
basis of this value, he eliminates the possible sources of heat one by one, leaving the 
falling bodies at the end. In this explanation, the mechanical equivalent of heat plays 
a crucial role. It allows him to go from a mechanical phenomenon to a quantity of 
heat. 
If there were solar heat emission without renewal, there would be a cooling of 
the star of 9000 °C in 5000 years, according to Mayer’s calculations.50 Since this 
does not occur, there will have to be renewal of the heat. Renewal could happen 
chemically or mechanically.51 
Exclusively by chemical means—the sun being considered as a great heap of 
coal—Mayer continued, the star could not emit for more than 46 centuries.52 Once 
the chemical path had been excluded, the mechanical path remained. Renewal could
50 “Wird nemlich die Wärme-Capacität der Sonnenmasse, dem Volumen nach gerechnet, gleich 
der des Wassers […] und denkt man sich zugleich den Wärmeverlust, den die Sonne durch 
Strahlung erleidet, auf ihre ganze Masse gleichförmig vertheilt, so ergibt sich für dieselbe eine 
jährliche Abkühlung = 1°, 8, wonach die Sonne in der geschichtlichen Zeit von 5000 Jahren eine 
Temperaturabnahme von 9000° erlitten haben müsste” (Mayer, 1848, p. 8).  
51 “Als algemeines Naturgesetz, von dem keine Ausnahme statt ﬁndet, gilt der Satz: dass zur Erzeu-
gung von Wärme ein gewisser Aufwand erforderlich ist. Dieser Aufwand, so verschiedenartig er 
sonst seyn mag, lässt sich immer auf zwei Hauptkategorien zurückführen; es besteht derselbe 
nemlich entweder in einem chemischen Material oder in einer mechanischen Arbeit” (ibid. p. 3). 
52 “Liegt dieser Wiederersatz in einem chemischen Processe? Nehmen wir, um dieser Vermuthung 
so viel nur möglich einzuräumen, die ganze Sonnenmasse für einen Klumpen Steinkohlen, wovon 
jedes Kilogramm 6000 Wärmeeinheiten durch Verbrennung liefert, so wäre die Sonne nicht weiter 
als 46 Jahrhunderte lang im Stande durch ihren Brand den genannten Wärmeaufwand zu bestreiten” 
(ibid. p. 8).

then happen by friction, by the living force of the sun’s rotation, or by collision, 
the falling of bodies on the sun. The hypothesis of renewal by friction is excluded 
because Saturn rotates faster than the sun and emits no such heat.53 The second 
hypothesis is also ruled out. The living rotational force of the sun would only cover 
183 years of heat expenditure.54 Finally, the third hypothesis holds: the renewal of 
solar heat comes from falling masses attracted by the sun.55 
The argument in favor of this thesis is based on observations available at the 
time and the mechanical equivalent of heat. First, Mayer argues that the number of 
celestial bodies—planets, moons, comets and asteroids—is inestimably large. In this 
regard he recalls a statement by Kepler, ‘there are more comets in the sky than ﬁsh in 
the ocean’56 and the large number of the bodies named asteroids by Arago.57 Then, 
he uses a fact from astronomical observations: there are bodies, whose path diameter 
around the sun decreases. Mayer infers, that the smaller the bodies, the faster their 
trajectory decreases,58 and then concludes that heavy substances fall on the solar 
surface.59 
53 “Es wurde die Vermuthung ausgesprochen, die Axendrehung der Sonne könnte das ursäch-
liche Moment von ihrem Strahlen seyn […] Einen raschen Umschwung für sich allein, ohne 
Reibung, ohne Widerstand, kann man sich nicht als die Ursache einer Licht- und Wärmeentwick-
lung denken, zumal da die Sonne sich keineswegs durch ihre Umdrehungsgeschwindigkeit vor 
den übrigen Körpern des Planetensystems auszeichnet […] Der äussere Ring des Saturns über-
trifft den Sonnenäquator in seiner Rotations-Geschwindigkeit um mehr als das zehnfache. Nichts 
destoweniger wird aber weder an der Erde, noch am Jupiter, noch am Saturnusringe eine Licht- und 
Wärmeerzeugung wahrgenommen” (ibid. pp. 8–9). 
54 “[…] so geht aus dem bisherigen hervor, dass der ganze Rotations-Effect der Sonne, wenn durch 
ihn der Wärmeverbrauch gedeckt werden sollte, in hundert drei und achtzig Jahren verzehrt seyn 
müsste” (ibid. p. 10). 
55 “[…] so haben diese wandernden Himmelskörper in der Peripherie des Sonnensystemes ihre 
Wiege, im Centrum ihr Grab […] Alle diese Massen stürzen mit einem heftigen Stosse in ihr 
gemeinsames Grab. Da nun keine Ursache ohne Wirkung besteht, so muss auch jede dieser kosmis-
chen Massen, ebenso wie ein zur Erde fallendes Gewicht, durch ihren Stoss eine, ihrer lebendigen 
Kraft proportionale Wirkung, eine gewisse Menge von Wärme, hervorbringen” (ibid. p. 12). 
56 “Im Raume des Sonnensystemes bewegen sich ausser den jetzt bekannten 14 Planeten und deren 
18 Trabanten noch eine sehr grosse Zahl anderer Himmelsmassen, von welchen die Kometen 
zunächst Erwähnung verdienen. 
Kepler’s berühmter Ausspruch “es gibt mehr Kometen im Himmelsraume, als Fische im Ocean” 
gründet sich auf die Thatsache […]” (ibid. p. 13). 
57 “Neben den Planeten, Monden und Kometen gibt es aber in unserem Sonnensysteme noch eine 
weitere Kategorie von Himmelskörpern. Es sind dieses geballte Massen […] denen Arago den 
passenden Namen “Asteroiden” gegeben hat. Wie die Planeten und Kometen, so folgen auch sie 
den Gesetzen der Schwere und umkreisen in elliptischen Bahnen die Sonne” (ibid. p. 14). 
58 “Es ist der Natur der Sache angemessen, dass die Planeten, ihrer ausnehmenden Grösse und 
Dichtigkeit wegen, eine nur sehr langsame und bis jetzt unmerkliche Verminderung ihrer Bahn-
durchmesser erfahren. Dagegen müssen sich die kleinen kosmischen Massen unter sonst gleichen 
Umständen in dem Masse der Sonne rascher nähern, je kleiner ihr körperlicher Durchmesser ist” 
(ibid. p. 15).

denseyn der Zodiakallicht-Materie einerseits und der Existenz eines widerstandleistenden Aethers

The effect of the impacts on the solar surface would depend on the mass of the 
bodies, but still on their velocity.60 Mayer calculates the minimum and maximum 
velocity with which a body hits the solar surface. Using the mechanical equivalent of 
heat, he concludes then that an asteroid gives the sun between 4600 and 9200 more 
heat units per fall than an equal mass of coal.61 
Another argument for Mayer’s thesis is derived from the diathermic energy of 
radiation. Experiments had shown that the higher the temperature of the source, the 
greater the radiation that penetrates space.62 From this he infers that the solar surface 
must be at a much higher temperature than is reached in combustion.63 A heat of the 
order of magnitude of that calculated for the solar source, however, could be obtained 
from falling asteroids.64 Mayer then calculates the amount of matter that should fall 
on the star per minute to be between 94,000 and 188,000 billion kilograms.65 This 
might seem like a large ﬁgure, but given the solar surface area, it would represent an 
increase of 15–30 g per square meter.66 Mayer then recalls that a light rain for one 
hour amounts to 17 g per square meter.67 
andererseits ergibt sich mit Notwendigkeit, dass fort und fort wägbare Substanzen auf der 
Sonnenoberﬂäche anlangen müssen” (ibid. p. 16). 
60 “Der Effect aber, den diese Massen dort ausüben, hängt offenbar von ihrer Endgeschwindigkeit 
ab” (ibid. p. 16).  
61 “Nach der am Schlusse des 2ten Capitels gegebenen Formel ist der Wärme-erregende Effect 
beim Stosse = 0˚,000139 × c2, wo c die Geschwindigkeit des stossenden Körpers nach Metern 
gerechnet ausdrückt. Da nun die Geschwindigkeit eines Asteroids beim Zusammenstossen mit der 
Sonne 445 750 bis 630 400 m beträgt, so ist der Effect = 27 ½—bis 55 Millionen Grad Wärme. 
Eine Asteroid-Masse gibt also bei ihrem Sturze auf die Sonne 4600 bis 9200 mal so viel Wärme, als 
eine gleich grosse Menge Steinkohlen (à 6000 Calorien) durch Verbrennen liefert!” (ibid. p. 20). 
62 “Dagegen wächst die diathermane Energie der Strahlen fortwährend, wie die Temperatur der 
Quelle höher wird” (ibid. p. 23). 
63 “Dieses Erfahrungsgesetz, dass die Raum-durchdringende Energie der Wärmestrahlen im allge-
meinen zunimmt, wenn die Temperatur ihrer Quelle eine höhere wird, lehrt, dass auf der 
Sonnenoberﬂäche eine weit grössere Hitze herrschen muss, als der heftigste Verbrennungsprocess 
hervorzubringen vermag” (ibid. p. 24). 
64 “Vergleicht man diese künstlichen Feuer mit der von einem auf die Sonne stürzenden Aster-
oide hervorgebrachten Hitze, so ﬁndet man die letztere (auch abgesehen von der im Vergleiche zum 
Wasser wahrscheinlich ziemlich geringen Wärme-Capacität der Asteroid-Massen) 7- bis 14 000 mal 
grösser, als selbst die Hitze eines Knallgasgebläses, woraus sich denn die ausserordentliche diather-
mane Energie der Sonnenstrahlen, die unermesslich grosse Ausstrahlung der Sonnenoberﬂäche und 
die extreme Hitze im Focus der Brennspiegel leicht ergibt” (ibid. p. 25). 
65 “Da nun […] 1 K˚ Asteroid-Masse 27 ½—bis 55 Millionen Wärmeeinheiten gibt, so folgt 
daraus, dass die Quantität der auf die Sonne niederstürzenden kosmischen Materien in jeder Minute 
zwischen 94 000- und 188 000 Billionen Kilogramme betragen muss” (ibid. p. 29). 
66 “Da nun das Quantum der in 1 min auf die Sonne stürzenden Asteroid-Massen 94 000-bis 188 
000 Billionen Kilogramme beträgt, so folgt hieraus für 1 QuadratMeter Sonnenoberﬂäche eine 
Massenzunahme von durhschnittlich 15 bis 30 Grm. per Minute” (ibid. pp. 31–2). 
67 “Um diesen Vorgang […] erinnere man sich, dass ein schwacher Regen in einer Stunde eine 
1 mm hohe Wasserschichte gibt (während starke Gewitterregen leicht das 10 bis 15 fache Quantum 
liefert) welches für 1 Quadrat-Meter Oberﬂäche in einer Minute 17 Grm. ausmacht” (ibid. p. 32).

Conclusion 
Mayer defends the thesis that the heat of the sun originates from falling bodies on 
the solar surface. The mechanical equivalent of heat provides him with the tool of 
calculation, which allows him to go from a mechanical to a thermal value. In the 
remaining, he shows that it is plausible to admit that there is an innumerable set 
of bodies that fall on the sun; and that his explanation is more adequate than the 
alternatives. 
2.1.4 
1851: On the Mechanical Equivalent of Heat 
In 1851, Mayer publishes a third book at his own expense,RemarksontheMechanical 
Equivalent of Heat. This is a historical–philosophical defense of the mechanical 
equivalent of heat. He takes some scientiﬁc results from the past and shows that 
the essential thing in research was quantitative determination. Finally, he comes to 
the topic ‘heat’: it was not explanations of the nature of heat, but a number—the 
mechanical equivalent of heat—that improved knowledge of caloriﬁc phenomena. 
The golden rule of research consists, according to Mayer, in trying to know the 
phenomena before trying to explain them by ultimate causes.68 In order to know the 
phenomena, one must investigate until a numerical relationship can be determined. 
Herein lies the foundation of research, according to the author.69 
Free fall is the ﬁrst topic of the argument: the task of science was to establish a 
numerical relationship between height, time of fall, and ﬁnal velocity. Experimental 
research led to the result.70 The ascent of liquids by suction is another topic. It was 
not the explanations about the qualities of vacuum that led to the knowledge of the 
phenomenon, but the measurement.71 The knowledge of combustion processes has
68 “Die wichtigste, um nicht zu sagen einzige Regel für die ächte Naturforschung ist die: einge-
denk zu bleiben, dass es unsere Aufgabe ist, die Erscheinungen kennen zu lernen, bevor wir nach 
Erklärungen suchen oder nach höheren Ursachen fragen mögen. Ist einmal eine Thatsache nach 
allen ihren Seiten hin bekannt, so ist sie eben damit erklärt und die Aufgabe der Wissenschaft ist 
beendigt” (Mayer, 1851, pp. 5–6). 
69 “Die Regel, nach welcher verfahren werden musste, um die Fundamente der Naturkunde in 
der denkbar kürzesten Zeit zu legen, lässt sich in wenige Worten fassen. Es müssen nämlich die 
nächstliegenden und häuﬁgsten Naturerscheinungen mittelst der Sinnwerkzeuge einer sorgfältigen 
Untersuchung unterworfen werden, die so lange fortzuführen ist, bis aus ihr Grössenbestimmungen, 
die sich durch Zahlen ausdrücken lassen, hervorgegangen sind. 
Diese Zahlen sind die gesuchten Fundamente einer exacten Naturforschung” (ibid. p. 7). 
70 “Unter allen Natur-Processen ist der freie Fall eines Gewichtes der häuﬁgste […] die Aufgabe 
besteht nun darin, die zwischen der Fallhöhe, der Fallzeit und der Endgeschwindigkeit stattﬁndenden 
Grössenbeziehungen aufzuﬁnden und in bestimmten Zahlen auszudrücken. Bei der Ausführung 
dieser Experimental-Untersuchung […]” (ibid. p. 7). 
71 “Eine zweite […] alltägliche Erscheinung ist das Aufsteigen von Flüssigkeiten in Röhren beim 
Saugen. Auch hier gilt es wieder, sich nicht durch das velle rerum cognoscere causas zu nutzlosen 
und also schädlichen Speculationen über die Qualitäten des Vacuums u. d. gl. in die Irre führen 
zu lassen […] Sollte etwa die Saugwirkung eine messbare Grenze haben? - Sobald wir einmal

also been numerically determined, this time by weighing the products before and 
after a process.72 Finally the question, what about the heat developed by friction, 
inelastic collision or by pressure of gases?73 Here too, the task was not accomplished 
with heat-substance, heat-aether, heat-atoms.74 Rather, it was measurements of the 
work expended and the heat developed that made it possible to establish a relation-
ship between the two.75 The number, which establishes the relationship between the 
quantities of one and the other, is the mechanical equivalent of heat.76 
Conclusion 
Mayer’s last book, on the mechanical equivalent of heat, highlights the role of the 
equivalent for scientiﬁc knowledge. First, when he shows that in several domains of 
science, it was the numerical relationship that brought progress. Second, when he 
refers to our conditions of knowing nature. He pointed out that our knowledge is 
limited: we do not know the real causes of phenomena; we do not know what force 
is; we know nothing about the essence of heat. The transformation of one force into 
another, which could reﬂect intricacies of phenomena, is explicitly understood as an 
expression of a mere numerical relationship.
anfangen, in dieser Richtung zu experimentiren, so kann es uns nicht mehr entgehen […] Diese 
Zahl ist ein zweiter Hauptfeiler im Gebäude des menschlichen Wissens” (ibid. p. 8).
72 “Von jeher mussten die Verbrennungserscheinungen die Aufmerksamkeit der Menschen in beson-
derem Grade in Anspruch nehmen. Um sie zu erklären, stellten die Alten ihrer naturphilosophischen 
Methode gemäss ein besonderes, nach oben strebendes Feuerelement auf […] Auch hier sind es 
Grössenbestimmungen, Zahlen allein sind es, die uns den Ariadne-Faden in die Hand geben. Wollen 
wir erfahren, was bei den Feuererscheinungen vorgeht, so müssen wir die Stoffe vor und nach ihrer 
Verbrennung wägen […]” (ibid. pp. 11–2). 
73 “Wir wissen aber längst, dass in einer Unzahl von Fällen Wärme auftritt, wo kein chemis-
cher Process statt ﬁndet; so namentlich bei jeder Reibung, beim unelastischen Stosse und beim 
Zusammendrücken luftförmiger Körper” (ibid. p. 12). 
74 “Die Geschichte lehrt, dass auch hier die scharfsinnigsten Hypothesen von dem Bestande und der 
Natur eines besonderen Wärme “stoffes”, von einem bald ruhenden, bald schwingenden “Wärme-
Aether”, von “Wärme-Atomen”, die in den zwischen den Massen-Atomen beﬁndlichen Räumen 
ihre Rolle spielen sollten, u. s. w., die Aufgabe nicht zu lösen vermocht haben” (ibid. pp. 12–3). 
75 “Es müssen wieder Grössenbestimmungen vorgenommen, es muss gemessen und gezählt werden. 
Wenn wir in dieser Richtung vorgehen und die auf mechanischem Wege entwickelte Wärmemenge, 
sowie die dazu verbrauchte Arbeitskraft messen, und diese Grössen mit einander vergleichen, so 
ﬁnden wir sofort, dass dieselben in der denkbar einfachsten Beziehung, d. h. in einem unverän-
derlichen, geraden Verhältnisse zu einander stehen […] Diese Thatsachen in kurze, klare Worte 
gefasst, sagen wir: Wärme und Bewegung verwandeln sich in einander” (ibid. p. 13). 
76 “das Gesetz der unveränderlichen Grössenbeziehung zwischen der Bewegung und der Wärme 
muss auch numerisch ausgedrückt werden. Indem wir die Erfahrung hierüber befragen, ﬁnden wir 
[…] Diese Zahl ist das mechanische Aequivalent der Wärme” (ibid. pp. 13–4). 

2.2 James Joule

2.1.5 
Conclusion 
Mayer determined the mechanical equivalent of heat in 1842 and 1845, used it in the 
explanation of the solar heat and wrote a book on it. This value is obtained from an 
equation of the form 
alpha m e c h a n i c a l u n i t s equals beta t h e r m a l u n i t s period
This equation, in turn, is obtained from a phenomenon for which a cause-effect 
relationship holds. This relationship, in general, is established by an observer of a 
phenomenon. With regard to electricity, Mayer arrives at the expression x = z + z0 
(where x stands for the mechanical part and z + z0 for the electric). If he had the 
values of the mechanical and electrical parts, he could have written an equation in 
the form of 
alpha m e c h a n i  c a l u n i t s equals gamma e l e c t r i c u n i t s period
On the basis of this, he could have calculated the mechanical equivalent of elec-
tricity, just as he did for the mechanical equivalent of heat. This comparison is 
legitimated since both heat and electricity are forms of force. 
Mayer created a theory. In this theory, force is the central concept. This concept 
is related with the cause-effect relationship: in a phenomenon, cause and effect are 
called forces. The properties of force—indestructibility and transformability—stem 
also from this relationship (1842). He was aware that his theory needed an experi-
mental basis. This basis was provided by the mechanical equivalent of heat, as he 
specially highlighted in the 1851 book. 
2.2 
James Joule 
James Joule was not a physicist and had no academic training. His hobby was to 
perform experiments. In 1838, he published a paper in the journal Annals of Elec-
tricity, in which he presents a machine that produces electricity through motion 
(Joule, 1838).77 In 1840, he establishes a quantitative relationship between elec-
tricity and heat.78 The ﬁrst Joule’s paper that will interest us deals with experiments 
which involve motion and electricity, as in the 1838 apparatus, and electricity and 
heat, as the 1840 experiment. His focus is now on the relationship between motion 
and heat. 
This relationship between motion and heat was important at that time due to the 
following. According to most physicists of the time, experiments had shown that
77 Between 1838 and 1840, he worked on electromagnets and motors (Joule, 1884).

Martins and Silva (2021).

What Was Discovered in the 1840s?
the quantity of heat did not vary. (I.e., if one body gets hotter another gets colder.) 
If the quantity does not vary, then heat is something that subsists. For this reason, 
heat was taken as a substance. If heat is taken as a substance because its quantity 
does not vary, it follows that if the quantity of heat varies, heat cannot be taken as a 
substance. Therefore, if Joule showed that the amount of heat varies, heat would no 
longer be a substance. The prevailing thesis about heat would collapse. What would 
heat be if it were not a substance? The alternative at that time was to take heat as 
motion. In fact, neither the proponents of the thesis ‘heat is motion’ had observed 
the motion that heat was said to consist of nor the proponents of the thesis of heat as 
a substance had observed such a substance. Heat as a substance and heat as motion 
were interpretations of the experiments. Hence, the fundamental question was only 
whether the amount of heat is conserved or not, which is also the one that could have 
an experimental answer. 
Joule tries to show through a series of experiments that the quantity of heat varies 
in phenomena so that heat cannot be a substance, but it is rather a kind of motion. The 
ﬁrst experiments performed with this purpose were in 1843. In 1845, he conducted 
a series of experiments with gases, whose purpose was to show that there is a corre-
lation between heat and motion. In this same year, Joule conducted water friction 
experiments. These experiments were retaken in 1847 and 1849 and became Joule’s 
most famous experiment: the paddle wheel experiment. Again, Joule correlates the 
mechanical action with the developed heat. 
2.2.1 
1843: Motion, Heat and the Equivalent 
The 1843 experiments were performed with a machine that had the peculiarity of 
producing electric current by means of the movement of a magnet. Since current is 
produced by moving the magnet, the machine was called a magneto-electric machine. 
This current was called magneto-electricity (Appendix H).79 This current, in turn, 
produces heat. Therefore, the machine provides the sequence: motion, electricity, 
heat. What matters are the ends of the sequence. Electricity was just a medium. 
The article begins by asking the question, whether the heat from the magneto-
electricity arises by transfer or by generation.80 This question is linked to another 
one: if heat is a substance or a state of vibration. For if heat is not a “substance” but 
a “state of vibration,” says Joule, there is no reason why it should not be induced 
by a purely mechanical action, as he understood the magneto-electric machine to
79 At that time, it was not known whether the electricity from this machine was like electricity from 
other sources, so they gave names to the electricity (Appendix H). 
80 “it must be admitted that hitherto no experiments have been made decisive of this very interesting 
question; for all of them refer to a particular part of the circuit only, leaving it a matter of doubt 
whether the heat observed was generated, or merely transferred from the coils in which the magneto-
electricity was induced, the coils themselves becoming cold” (Joule, 1843, p. 123).

Fig. 2.7 Moving the crank, the axis (b) rotates and makes axis a to rotate. Perpendicular to 
axis a is an electromagnet immersed in a tube with water. This electromagnet moves close to 
an electromagnet, which is not shown (Joule, 1843, p. 125) 
be.81 From the various series of experiments in this study, Joule concluded that the 
magneto-electric machine can generate and destroy heat. Therefore, the amount of 
heat varies. If the quantity of heat varies, the question about the nature of heat is 
solved: heat cannot be a substance. Not being a substance, heat is motion. 
Joule did not stop there. He intended to determine how much mechanical action 
is required to obtain one unit of heat. He then takes up some of the experiments 
performed in order to determine the mechanical value of heat. Let us move on to 
these experiments. 
The magneto-electric machine consists of three relevant elements (Fig. 2.6): 
1. a magnet or an electro-magnet82 ; 
2. a small electro-magnet in comparison with the previous one; 
3. a crank that brings the smaller electromagnet into rotation. Due to this rotation, 
electrical current is developed. 
Elements 2 and 3 are represented in Fig. 2.7.
81 “It is pretty generally, I believe, taken for granted that the electric forces which are put into play by 
the magneto-electrical machine possess, throughout the whole circuit, the same caloriﬁc properties 
as currents arising from other sources. And indeed when we consider heat not as a substance, but  
as a state of vibration, there appears to be no reason why it should not be induced by an action of 
a simply mechanical character, such, for instance, as is presented in the revolution of a coil of wire 
before the poles of a permanent magnet” (ibid. p. 123). 
82 An electro-magnet is a device that works as a magnet but is driven by a battery.

Fig. 2.8 The axis is wrapped by a double thread, which unfolds in diametrically opposite directions, 
each passing through a pulley and bearing weights at the ends (ibid. p. 150) 
From the experiments carried out, Joule concluded that motion creates heat. As 
heat could be increased through the magneto-electric machine and this functions by 
means of motion, Joule tried to determine a proportion between the heat evolved and 
the mechanical power at stake. To estimate this mechanical power, he replaced the 
crank with the system represented in Fig. 2.8.83 
The weight and height of the bodies make up the value of the mechanical power. 
This value is equated with the value of the heat evolved. Thus, he arrives at an 
equation of the form 
alpha m e c h a n i c a l u n i t s equals beta t h e r m a l u n i t s period
As he then knows that α mechanical units correspond to β thermal units, he is 
able to calculate how many mechanical units correspond to one thermal unit. This is 
the mechanical value of heat. Let us have a look at the ﬁgures. 
The machine moves with a velocity of 600 rotations per minute. For this motion, a 
weight of 5 lb. 3 oz (2.35301 kg) in each scale is necessary. These falling bodies have 
two effects: the 600 rotations per minute and the current produced. Joule is interested 
in the heat that comes from electricity. To get it, he takes out of the total mechanical 
action what is spent to maintain the 600 rotations per minute. To obtain this latter 
value, he set the machine in motion with 600 rotations per minute without producing 
electricity. Under these conditions, it needs only 2 lb. 13 oz (1.27573 kg).84 The 
difference between these two weights is then taken as the weight which contributes 
to the heat produced,
83 “The axle b [...] was wound with a double strand of ﬁne twine, and the strings [...] were carried 
over very easily-working pulleys, placed on opposite sides of the axle [...] By means of weights 
placed in the scales attached to the ends of the strings, I could easily ascertain the force necessary 
to move the apparatus at any given velocity” (ibid. p. 150). 
84 “when the battery was thrown out of communication with the electro-magnet, and the motion 
was opposed solely by friction and the resistance of the air, only 2 lb. 13 oz. were required for the 
same purpose” (ibid. pp. 150–1).

The ﬁnal value of heat evolved is determined. It is equivalent to the heat neces-
sary for heating a pound of water by 2.74°F (690.929 cal).85 Thus, if 2455.75 lb.ft

Joule said that the mechanical value of heat is equal to the weight of 896 pounds 
which fall from the height of one foot.87 Two other experiments gave the results of 
1001 and 1040 lb.ft.88 
The next series of experiments provides him with the reason for another thesis: heat 
can be destroyed through the magneto-electric machine. The experimental conﬁg-
uration that supports this statement differs from the previous because it includes a 
battery. (As the battery had been discovered by Volta, its current was called voltaic 
electricity.) This current generates heat. Joule determines the heat generated by this 
electricity alone and the heat generated when both kinds of electricity are involved. 
Comparing the results, he argues that the quantity of heat due to voltaic electricity can 
be decreased or increased when both kinds of electricity are involved. If it decreases, 
he claims that heat was destroyed; if it increases, heat was created. Let us see how 
he arrives at these conclusions. 
Joule connects element 2 (Fig. 2.6) with a battery and measures the heat developed 
by this current, when no magneto-electricity is involved. In this case, the machine is 
at rest. To obtain this situation, one simply removes the large electromagnet (element
85 “2°.46 × 1.114 = 2°.74; and this has been obtained by the power which can raise 4 lb. 12 oz. to 
the perpendicular height of 517 feet” (ibid. p. 151). 
86 About the conversion of units: 1 lb. = 0.453592 kg, 1 ft = 0.3048 m, 1 BTU = 252.164 cal. 
Therefore, S tartF ra ction 1 lb period dot 1 ft Over 1 BTU EndFraction equals 0.000548 kg m slash cal
Start Fraction 1 lb period dot 1 ft Over 1 BTU EndFraction equals 0.000548 kg m slash cal. Thus, 0.000548 × 9.8 = 0.00537 J/cal. Thus, multiplying 
the value of the mechanical equivalent of heat determined by Joule by 0.00537, we obtain this value 
in modern units. 
87 “1° of heat per lb. of water is therefore equivalent to a mechanical force capable of raising a 
weight of 896 lb. to the perpendicular height of one foot” (ibid. p. 151). 
88 “Two other experiments, conducted precisely in the same manner, gave a degree of heat to 
mechanical forces represented respectively by 1001 lb. and 1040 lb.” (ibid. p. 151).

1, Fig. 2.6). When, in a second step, the electromagnet is added again, the machine 
starts to work by itself, as if it were an engine. When this motion is ﬁnished, the heat 
is determined. The heat developed is less than when the machine was at rest. From 
this Joule concluded that the magneto-electrical machine can destroy heat. Let us 
move on to the ﬁgures. 
When the machine works as an engine,89 there are two effects to consider: the 
rotational motion and the electricity produced. To separate these effects, Joule puts 
the machine in motion with the same number of revolutions per minute, without 
producing electricity. Thus, he determines the value of the mechanical effect. As in 
the previous cases, the product of the weights used by the height covered is taken as 
the mechanical power of the machine. This value was 2.25 lb. × 275 ft = 618.75 lb.ft. 
The quantity of heat developed, when the machine works as an engine is of 1.191° 
calculated along the lines of the previous ones and also referred to a pound of water 
(ibid. p. 153). The quantity of heat developed in the circuit when the electromagnet 
is at rest is 1.794 (ibid. p. 153). As this value is higher than the previous one, Joule 
concludes that the difference (1.794–1.191 = 0.603) has been converted into mechan-
ical power (ibid. p. 153). Now, since this heat difference corresponds to a movement 
that could be created by a mechanical power of 618.75 lb.ft, to the thermal unit 
corresponds

StartF
raction 2. 25 asterisk 275 Over 0.603 EndFraction equals 1026.12 lb period ft slash BTU
Joule concludes that the drop of 1026 lb. from the height of a foot is the mechanical 
power required to raise the temperature of a pound of water 1°F.90 Another experiment 
carried out in the same way provides the value of 587 lb.ft (ibid. p. 153). 
In these experiments, in which the machine works as an engine, the electromagnet 
rotates in one and the same direction. Joule will now force it to rotate in the opposite 
direction. To do this, he needs an external action. He uses again the falling bodies 
and follows the same steps as previously. In order to set the machine into motion 
now, 6 lb. 4 oz in each scale are required (ibid. p. 152) 
upper W  Sub scr ipt  t ot al Base line equals 2 times 6 lb period 4 oz equals 12 period 5 lb period
As in the previous experiment, he takes from this total weight what is exclusively 
mechanical, to ﬁnd out what can be attributed to heat. To do this he puts the machine 
to work as a mere mechanical machine. The weights necessary for that are 2 lb. 8 oz 
in each scale (ibid. p. 152). Therefore, 
upper W Su bsc rip t mec h Ba seline equals 2 times 2 lb period 8 oz equals 5 lb period
89 “An experiment was now made, using the same apparatus as an electro-magnetic engine” (ibid. 
p. 153). 
90 “Hence 0°.603 has been converted into a mechanical power equal to raise 2 lb. 4 oz. to the height 
of 275 feet […] one degree per lb. of water may be converted into the mechanical power which can 
raise 1026 lb. to the height of one foot” (ibid. p. 153). 

2.2 James Joule

The difference between weights Wtotal and Wmech (equal to 7.5 lb) indicates the 
weight related to heat production. As the scales cover the distance of 551 ft,91 the 
mechanical power used in producing that quantity of heat is equal to 
7 p eri o d 5 lb  pe riod tim es 55 1 ft equals 4132.5 lb period ft
Let us consider the corresponding heat. Joule determines the heat developed and 
arrives at 9.92° (ibid. p. 152). When element 2 (Fig. 2.6) is at rest, the heat developed 
is equivalent to 5.38° Fahrenheit per pound of water. The difference between the heat 
in motion and at rest is therefore 9.92–5.38 = 4.54. Now, if at 4.54° corresponds to 
a mechanical power of 4132.5 lb.ft (ibid. p. 152), it follows that to one thermal unit 
corresponds

Start
Fraction 4 132.5 Over 4.54 EndFraction equals 910.242 lb period ft slash BTU
Joule concludes that the heat required to raise a pound of water by 1°F is equivalent 
to 910 lb. raised to the height of a foot.92 A last series of experiments is performed 
with an iron cylinder, previously coated with copper as element 2 (Fig. 2.6), the 
revolving piece (ibid. p. 154). The heat generated and the mechanical power are 
determined as in the previous cases. From ﬁve experiments thus performed Joule 
concludes: 1° of heat per pound of water can be generated by the expenditure of 
mechanical power capable of raising 742 lb. to the height of one foot (ibid. p. 156).

Two other experiments conducted along the same lines, only with a less powerful

Conclusion 
Joule used falling bodies to determine the mechanical action. This action sets the 
machine in motion and produces heat. Joule wants to know the value of the action 
that produces heat. To do this, he takes the total of the action and subtracts that which 
serves to set the machine in motion as a mere mechanical object. From this comes

From such equations he calculates the mechanical value of the heat. 
When the heat of magneto-electricity and voltaic electricity are at stake, he 
subtracts their respective values

Thus, the ﬁnal expressions have the form

If 
left parenthesis w e i g h t times h e i g h t right parenthesis Subscript t o t a l Baseline minus left parenthesis w e i g h t times h e i g h t right parenthesis Subscript m e c period
is positive, Joule says that the mechanical power has been converted into heat; if that 
value is negative, he says that heat has been converted into mechanical power. In all

cases, the equation states 
alpha u  n i t s o f m e c h a n i c a l p o w e r equals beta d e g r e e s o f h e a t period
Based on this, he calculates how many mechanical units correspond to one thermal 
unit. This is the mechanical value of heat. 
Let us move on to the interpretation of the phenomena in relation to the heat 
theory. From the experiments which were performed in the ﬁrst part of the paper, 
Joule concluded that heat can be created or destroyed. Therefore, heat cannot be a 
substance. If it is not a substance, it must be motion, according to the dilemma of 
that time. As heat is then a kind of motion and the caloriﬁc effects of the magneto-
electricity are produced through motion, a motion causes another motion. A quantity 
of one kind is converted into the other. The conversion factor was experimentally 
determined. The thesis of the heat as motion was not new but Joule’s novelty was 
signiﬁcant (Appendix I). 
2.2.2 
1845: Gas Experiments and the Equivalent 
In 1845, Joule published the article ‘On the temperature changes produced by rarefac-
tion and condensation’. This consists of 3 series of experiments that aim to show the 
correlation between motion and heat. In the ﬁrst series, the amount of gas in a 
container is increased by mechanical action and the temperature of the gas rises. In 
the second, the gas leaves one of the containers and enters another, without external 
mechanical action. The temperature of both containers taken together remained 
constant. In the third, the gas leaves a container to perform mechanical action and 
the temperature of the gas goes down. Thus, we have: 
– with condensation, heat increases; 
– with rarefaction followed by condensation, heat is maintained; 
– with rarefaction, heat decreases. 
Now condensation and rarefaction are connected with mechanical actions. There-
fore, increase and decrease of heat are correlated with mechanical action on the gas 
or by the gas. If there is condensation and rarefaction without mechanical action, the 
quantity of heat does not change. So mechanical action and heat appear correlated 
with each other. 
Condensation experiments 
The condensation experiments were performed with the mechanism shown in 
Fig. 2.10. A copper receiver is immersed in water. The air is compressed through the 
pump until approximately 22 atmospheres are reached.93 
93 “The pump and copper receiver were immersed in 45 lb. 3 oz. of water, into which the very sensible 
thermometer above described was then placed [...] The pump was then worked at a moderate degree

Fig. 2.10 A copper receiver (R) is immersed in water. The other container (G) contains pieces of 
calcium chloride intended to dry the air (Joule, 1845b, p. 173) 
Calculating the force involved in condensing the gas and the heat developed, Joule 
puts them into the equation: to such a force corresponds such a heat, as he had done 
in the 1843 paper. He calculates then the mechanical equivalent of heat and arrives 
at the result: to raise by 1° F the temperature of a pound of water a force, capable of 
raising 823 lb. to the height of a foot, is required.94 The second series of condensing 
experiments leads to a mechanical equivalent of heat equal to 795 lb.ft.95 
Rarefaction Experiments 
A certain amount of gas, which was at considerable pressure, is released. This gas is 
used to perform a motion, as shown in Fig. 2.11.
of speed until about twenty-two atmospheres of air, dried by being passed through the vessel G full 
of small pieces of chloride of calcium, were compressed into the copper receiver” (Joule 1845b, 
p. 176). 
94 “a mechanical force capable of raising 823 lb. to the height of one foot must be applied in the 
condensation of air, in order to increase the temperature of a pound of water by one degree of 
Fahrenheit’s scale” (ibid. p. 179). 
95 “The mechanical force spent in the condensation is represented in this instance by […] Hence the 
equivalent of a degree of heat per lb. of water, as determined by the above series, is 795 lb. raised 
to the height of one foot” (ibid. p. 180). 

2.2 James Joule

Fig. 2.11 A bottle with compressed air is immersed in a cylinder with water. When released, the 
gas is led into a container of water (ibid. p. 183). 
When the stopcock is opened, the gas expands and is led into a container of water. 
The gas inlet forces the water out, which in turn raises the water level in the tub.96 It 
‘pushes’, therefore, a column of air at ambient pressure. 
Joule determines the decrease in heat due to the expansion of the gas and calculates 
the work in moving the water as a result of the expanded air.97 From the relationship 
between heat lost and work done a value for the mechanical equivalent of heat is 
obtained: 820 lb.ft.98 The second and third series, which differ from each other by 
the quantities of air used, provide the values: 814 and 760 lb.ft.99 
These three latter values are considered more reliable than the results obtained in 
the condensation experiments. Therefore, Joule takes the average of these,

96 “The receiver was ﬁlled with dry compressed air, and a coiled leaden pipe, ¼ of an inch in 
internal diameter and 12 yards long, was screwed tightly upon the nozzle […] The whole was 
then immersed into an oval can […] and was also covered at top as perfectly as possible. Having 
ascertained the temperature of the water […] the stopcock was opened and the air made to pass 
from the receiver through a pneumatic trough into a jar […] After the air in the receiver had been 
reduced to the atmospherical pressure, the water was again well stirred and its temperature noted” 
(ibid. pp. 183–4). 
97 “The cold produced was diffused through 21.17 lb. of water, 14 lb. of copper, 8 lb. of lead, and 
7 lb. of tinned iron. Hence we ﬁnd that a quantity of cold was produced in the experiments sufﬁcient 
to cause the temperature of a lb. of water to decrease by 4˚.085. At the same time a mechanical 
force was developed, which could raise a column of the atmosphere, of an inch square at the base, 
to the altitude of 2723 inches; or, in other words, could raise 3352 lb. to the height of one foot” 
(ibid. pp. 184–5). 
98 “For each degree of heat lost there was therefore generated a force sufﬁcient to raise 820 lb. to 
the height of one foot” (ibid. p. 185). 
99 “On reducing the results of these experiments in the manner before indicated, we ﬁnd that in the 
experiments of Table V. 814 lb., and in those of Table VI. 760 lb. were raised to the height of a foot 
for every degree of heat per lb. of water lost” (ibid. p. 185).

Fig. 2.12 Container R is 
ﬁlled with dry air at 
considerable pressure (about 
22 atmospheres) and E has 
been exhausted (ibid. p. 180) 
as the value for the mechanical equivalent of heat (4.29 J).100 
The next experiments do not serve to provide values of the equivalent. They do, 
however, serve to complement the correlation between mechanical action and heat: 
when there is rarefaction and condensation without mechanical action, the quantity 
of heat in the system remains constant. 
Rarefaction and condensation 
The apparatus used (Fig. 2.12) consists of two copper receptacles connected together 
by a stopcock.101 One is ﬁlled with dry air at considerable pressure (about 22 atmo-
spheres) and the other has been exhausted. This set is immersed in a container of 
water, whose initial temperature is carefully measured. Opening the stopcock causes 
then the rarefaction in one container and condensation in the other. The temperature 
of the water is measured again.102 The temperature variations are negligible in the 
various experiments. Joule considers the zero variation to be the correct value.103 
100 “The mechanical equivalents of heat determined by the various series of experiments given in 
this paper are 823, 795, 820, 814, and 760. The mean of the last three, which I take as least liable 
to error, is 798 lb.” (ibid. p. 187). 
101 “I provided another copper receiver […] which had a capacity of 134 cubic inches. Like the 
former receiver, to which it could be connected by a coupling nut, it had a piece D attached, in the 
centre of which there was a bore 1/8 of an inch diameter, which could be closed perfectly by means 
of a proper stop-cock” (ibid. p. 180). 
102 “Having ﬁlled the receiver R […] with about 22 atmospheres of dry air, and having exhausted 
the receiver E by means of an air-pump, I screwed them together, and then put them into a tin can 
containing 16½ lb. of water. The water was ﬁrst thoroughly stirred, and its temperature taken by the 
same delicate thermometer […] The stopcocks were then opened by means of a proper key, and the 
air allowed to pass from the full into the empty receiver until equilibrium was established between 
the two. Lastly, the water was again stirred and its temperature carefully noted” (ibid. pp. 181–2). 
103 “we arrive at the conclusion, that no change of temperature occurs when air is allowed to expand 
in such a manner as not to develop mechanical power” (ibid. p. 182).

41
Fig. 2.13 Joule inverted the 
receivers and immersed 
them, as well as the 
connecting-piece, into 
separate cans of water (ibid. 
p. 183) 
Joule then develops a strategy to determine the heat change in each container 
and around the stopcock. Each of the cylinders and the vicinity of the stopcock are 
immersed in disjoint recipients, as shown in Fig. 2.13. 
In each of the water containers, the temperature of the water before and after the 
gas expansion is measured. The temperature has decreased in the container where R is 
immersed and increased in the other two. The sum of the variations in the containers 
where R and E are immersed is close to zero (−2°.36 + 2°.38 = 0.02º).104 
Conclusion 
Joule establishes a correlation between heat and mechanical action based on the 
following: 
– when mechanical action is done on the gas, heat is obtained 
– when mechanical action is done by the gas, the gas loses heat 
– when no mechanical action is involved, there is no heat gain or loss. 
Based on the former two series of experiments, Joule determines the mechanical 
equivalent of heat. As in the 1843 paper, Joule shows the correlation between heat 
and mechanical action and determines the factor of conversion. 
2.2.3 
1845–50: Paddle Wheel Experiments 
and the Equivalent 
In June 1845, at the meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of 
Science, Joule made known another way of determining the mechanical equivalent
104 “One of the receivers had 2828 cubic inches of dry air condensed into it, while the other was 
vacuous. After equilibrium was restored by opening the cocks, I found that 2°.36 of cold per lb. of 
water had been produced in the receiver from which the air had expanded, while 2°.38 of heat had 
been produced in the other receiver, and 0°.31 of heat also in the can in which the connecting-piece 
was immersed, the sum of the whole amounting nearly to zero” (ibid. p. 183).

More detailed is the author’s synopsis in a letter to the editors of the Philosophical 
Magazine, published by the journal that year (Joule, 1845a). At the 1847 meeting 
of the British Association in Oxford, Joule presented a paper on the mechanical 
equivalent of heat, whose experiments are analogous to those of 45.106 In the 1850

ments […] I have now repeated the experiments under more favourable circumstances, and with a 
more exact apparatus, and have moreover employed sperm-oil as well as water with equal success”

the paddles to rotate, but to hinder the rotational motion of the water. Some of the 
ﬂuid hits plates solidly attached to the walls of the container.107 
The paddle wheel is set in motion as follows. The axis of the paddle wheel is 
wrapped by a double wire, which is distributed between two diametrically situated 
pulleys. At the end of the wire passing through each pulley are suspended bodies, 
whose weight moves the paddle wheel.108 
The experiment consists of dropping the bodies and measuring the temperature 
of the water before the bodies are dropped and at the end of the motion. The bodies 
motion occurs 16 times (1845) or 20 times (1847, 1850). As the wheel moves by 
virtue of the falling weights, Joule establishes a relationship between the mechanical 
power involved and the heat developed. The mechanical power is given by the weight 
and height of the bodies (as in 1843). The heat developed is calculated by means of the 
change in water temperature. Equating both mechanical power and heat developed, 
the mechanical equivalent of heat is calculated. 
In 1845, the result was: 1°F, developed in water by friction, is equivalent to 890 
pounds of the height of a foot.109 In the 1847 experiment, Joule used water and 
whale oil. The mechanical equivalent of heat with water was 781.5 lb.ft and with 
oil 782.1 lb.ft. The average of these two values (781.8 lb.ft) was adopted as the 
mechanical equivalent of heat.110 In an article in the Comptes rendus, Joule gives 
an account of the values of the mechanical equivalent of heat obtained in earlier 
experiments, with distilled water and whale oil. The results are presented in French 
units: 428.8 g at the height of 1 m is equivalent to the amount of heat needed to raise 
the temperature of 1 g of water by 1° centigrade. In the case of whale oil, 429.1 g
107 “The apparatus exhibited before the Association consisted of a brass paddle-wheel working 
horizontally in a can of water. Motion could be communicated to this paddle by means of weights, 
pulleys, & c.” (Joule, 1845a, p. 203). 
108 “The paddle moved with great resistance in the can of water, so that the weights (each of four 
pounds) descended at the slow rate of about one foot per second. The height of the pulleys from the 
ground was twelve yards, and consequently, when the weights had descended through that distance, 
they had to be wound up again in order to renew the motion of the paddle. After this operation had 
been repeated sixteen times, the increase of the temperature of the water was ascertained by means 
of a very sensible and accurate thermometer” (ibid. p. 203). 
109 “A series of nine experiments was performed in the above manner […] After reducing the result 
to the capacity for heat of a pound of water, it appeared that for each degree of heat evolved by the 
friction of water a mechanical power equal to that which can raise a weight of 890 lb. to the height 
of one foot had been expended” (ibid. p. 203). 
110 “The equivalent of a degree of heat in a pound of water was therefore found to be 781.5 lb., 
raised to the height of one foot” (Joule, 1847a, p. 280). “the equivalent deduced from the friction of 
sperm-oil was 782.1, a result almost identical with that obtained from the friction of water” (ibid. 
p. 281). “The mean of the two results is 781.8, which is the equivalent I shall adopt until further 
and still more accurate experiments shall have been made” (ibid. p. 281).

lifted from 1 m.111 Furthermore, he presents a result of a similar experiment, but 
performed with mercury. The result was 432.1 g at the height of 1 m.112 
In the 1850 article, the frictions are performed with water, mercury and cast iron. 
From the experiments with water, the value of the mechanical equivalent heat was 
773.64 lb.ft.113 The experiments with mercury were carried out in two series. The 
ﬁrst led to the value of 773,762 and the second, performed with fewer weights, led 
to 776,303 lb.ft.114 From the experiments with cast iron, a value of 776.997 was 
obtained and in the second series, with less weights, 774.88 lb.ft.115 The experiments 
with water are considered the most reliable. Hence the value of the equivalent in 
vacuo for the friction of water, 772.692, is adopted as the mechanical equivalent of 
heat.116 
Joule ended this paper with three propositions but the third one was suppressed in 
accordance with the wish of the Committee who reviewed the paper. The published 
conclusions are the following: 
“1st. That the quantity of heat produced by the friction of bodies, whether solid or liquid, is 
always proportional to the quantity of force expended. And, 
2nd. That the quantity of heat capable of increasing the temperature of a pound of water 
(weighed in vacuo, and taken at between 55° and 60°) by 1°F requires for its evolution the 
expenditure of a mechanical force represented by the fall of 772 lb. through the space of one 
foot” (ibid. p. 328).
111 “Quand l’eau était agitée par l’action d’une roue à pannes agissant dans le liquide […] La force 
mécanique capable d’élever un poids de 428.8 grammes à la hauteur de 1 mètre fut ainsi trouvée être 
l’équivalent d’une quantité de chaleur nécessaire pour élever la température de 1 gramme d’eau par 
1 degré centrigrade. J’ai aussi fait des expériences semblables sur la friction de l’huile de baleine 
[…] le développement de 1 degré de chaleur par gramme d’eau était égal à 429.1 grammes soulevé 
de 1 mètre” (Joule, 1847b, pp. 283–4). 
112 “Poursuivant mes recherches, j’ai aussi employé du mercure comme liquide frotté” (ibid. p. 284). 
“Par conséquent, la chaleur capable d’augmenter la température de 1 gramme d’eau de 1 degré 
centrigrade est égale à une force mécanique capable d’élever un poids de 432.1 grammes à 1 mètre 
de hauteur” (ibid. pp. 285–6). 
113 “773.64 foot-pounds will be the force which, according to the above experiments on the friction 
of water, is equivalent to 1° Fahr. in a lb. of water” (Joule 1850, p. 312). 
114 “773.762; which is therefore the equivalent derived from the above experiments on the friction 
of mercury” (ibid. p. 318). “776.303 will therefore be the equivalent from the above series of 
experiments, in which the amount of friction of the mercury was moderated by the use of lighter 
weights” (ibid. p. 321). 
115 “776.997 will therefore be the equivalent derived from the above experiments on the friction of 
cast iron. The next series of experiments was made with the same apparatus, using lighter weights” 
(ibid. p. 325). “774.88 will therefore be the equivalent as derived from this last series of experiments” 
(ibid. p. 327). 
116 “I consider that 772.692, the equivalent derived from the friction of water, is the most correct, 
both on account of the number of experiments tried and the great capacity of the apparatus for heat” 
(ibid. p. 328).

Conclusion 
At the beginning of a paddle wheel experiment, the bodies are at a certain height and 
the water is a certain temperature. At the end, the bodies are down and the temper-
ature of the water has increased. Thanks to these data the following relationship is 
established 
w e i g h t time s h e i g  h t equals beta u n i t s o f h e a t period
If α units of mechanical power correspond to β units of heat, to one unit of heat 
corresponds x, the value of the mechanical equivalent of heat. 
All this leads to the two propositions of Joule’s conclusion quoted above. The 
third proposition, which was not published, stated: ‘friction consisted in the conver-
sion of mechanical power into heat’.117 Indeed, this statement cannot be proved by 
those experiments. The process of conversion, if it takes place, must have happened 
within the can. However, no observation is made to verify what happened within 
it. The temperature of water is read off when the weights are down and there is no 
conversion anymore, if there were any. In fact, what really happened within the can 
is also not important for the ﬁnal result: no speciﬁc information of the process of 
conversion is used. If the phenomenon does not consist of a process of conversion, 
the established relationship between heat and mechanical power is not disturbed. 
‘Conversion’ is therefore an interpretation of the phenomenon. Thus, it is under-
standable that Faraday, who reviewed the paper (Smith, 1976), did not accept the 
third conclusion. 
2.2.4 
Conclusion 
In all of Joule’s articles (1843–50) there are two important topics: the mechanical 
equivalent of heat and the thesis ‘heat is motion’. Joule designed and performed 
experiments by means of which he was able to measure the mechanical power and 
heat evolved. He established the numerical relation between both magnitudes and 
determined the mechanical equivalent of heat. In the course of time, he understood 
that the values of the equivalent could be more precise than in 1843 and 1845. The 
aim of the 1850 paper was to determine more accurately the mechanical equivalent 
of heat.118 (Fig. 2.16).
The other recurrent topic in Joule’s articles concerns the theory of heat. Contrary 
to the thesis in use at that time, that heat is a substance, Joule argues that heat is
117 “A third proposition, suppressed in accordance with the wish of the Committee to whom the 
paper was referred, stated that friction consisted in the conversion of mechanical power into heat” 
(ibid. p. 328). 
118 “[…] left no doubt on my mind as to the existence of an equivalent relation between force and 
heat; but still it appeared of the highest importance to obtain that relation with still greater accuracy. 
This I have attempted in the present paper” (ibid. p. 302).

motion. This thesis appeared in 1843 and is maintained in all other papers. The 
1850 article is symptomatic in this regard. This writing opens with a quotation of 
Locke: “Heat is […] motion” and another of Leibniz: “The force of a moving body 
is proportional to the square of its velocity”.119 Rumford is quoted because he said, 
heat is motion.120 Davy’s experiment of rubbing two pieces of ice together is also 
referred to.121 Joule’s thesis was not new, but his contribution to its acceptance—the 
mechanical equivalent of heat—was decisive. 
2.2.5 
Mayer and Joule 
Mayer and Joule knew that at the time the thesis ‘heat is substance’ was valid. This 
thesis had experimental support. Based on experiments conducted over the years, 
most of the authors argued that the amount of heat did not vary.122 
119 ““Heat is a very brisk agitation of the insensible parts of the object, which produces in us that 
sensation from whence we denominate the object hot; so what in our sensation is heat, in the object 
is nothing but motion.”—Locke. 
“The force of a moving body is proportional to the square of its velocity, or to the height to 
which it would rise against gravity.”—Leibnitz”” (ibid. p. 298). 
120 “For a long time it had been a favourite hypothesis that heat consists of “a force or power 
belonging to bodies”, but it was reserved for Count Rumford to make the ﬁrst experiments decidedly 
in favour of that view [...] “It appears to me,” he remarks, “extremely difﬁcult, if not quite impossible, 
to form any distinct idea of anything capable of being excited and communicated in the manner the 
heat was excited and communicated in these experiments, except it be motion”” (ibid. pp. 298–9). 
121 “By rubbing two pieces of ice against one another in the vacuum of an air-pump [...] This 
experiment was the more decisively in favour of the doctrine of the immateriality of heat, inasmuch 
as the capacity of ice for heat is much less than that of water. It was therefore with good reason that 
Davy drew the inference that “the immediate cause of the phenomena of heat is motion, and the 
laws of its communication are precisely the same as the laws of the communication of motion”” 
(ibid. p. 300). 
122 There were two main theses concerning the nature of heat. According to Rumford (1798, p. 99) 
or Davy (1799, p. 13–4), heat was motion. According to Carnot (1824, p. 10–1, 28) or William

The quantity of heat does not vary
Heat is a substance 
Both Mayer and Joule show that motion gives rise to heat (increasing in quantity) 
and heat gives rise to motion (decreasing in quantity). Since the quantity of heat 
varies after all, “heat is a substance” is no longer valid. With the collapse of this 
thesis, there is room for another thesis on the nature of heat, that is, the question 
arises, what is heat then? Mayer and Joule forge their own concepts of heat. In both 
concepts, heat and motion appear related. For Mayer, they are both forces. Motion 
and heat are forms of force. For Joule, they are both motions. Heat is a kind of motion. 
Experimental
Conceptual 
The quantity of heat does not vary
Heat is substance 
The quantity of heat varies
Heat is a form of force 
Heat is motion 
The terms that each of them uses for phenomena involving heat and motion are 
consistent with these concepts. Mayer uses transformation. This term tells us that 
there is a change of form. Now, since heat and motion are forms of force, the term 
transformation is consistent in cases where one gives rise to the other. Joule uses 
conversion. Now since heat is a type of motion, if motion gives rise to heat or 
inversely, we have one type of motion converting to another. 
Joule’s thesis on heat ﬁts the dilemma of the time: whether heat should be a 
substance or motion. Therefore, showing that heat could not be a substance, it 
remained to be a motion. Mayer’s thesis does not ﬁt. He stressed in his very ﬁrst 
writing that he did not argue that heat was motion. In the last book, he denies that 
there was any knowledge about the nature of heat. For Mayer, heat is one of the ﬁve 
forms of force. 
The mechanical equivalent of heat is the especially important point of conver-
gence. Mayer determined it in 1842 and 1845. Joule determined this in 1843 and in 
the following articles based on experiments that he himself designed and carried out 
(Fig. 2.17).
2.3 
Ludwig Colding 
Ludwig Colding was an engineer, newly graduated, unemployed, who got a grant to 
do a research work. He took this opportunity to prove an idea he had had for a long 
time and could not get rid of the forces of nature do not perish. Now, by observation,
Thomson (1849, p. 315), heat was a substance. Some authors had posed the question, “what is 
heat?”, in connection with their experimental works during the ﬁrst part of the nineteenth century. 
This was the case of Haldat (1807, p. 214), Berthollet (1809, p. 447), in cooperation with Pictet and 
Biot, Colladon and Sturm (1828, p. 161). Joule’s research concerns this question: heat is either a 
substance or motion (see Appendix A).

we realize that if a force acts on a particle and causes a movement, this propagates to 
the surrounding environment eventually becoming imperceptible.123 But this is no  
reason, Colding continues, to say that something has been lost without any effect. 
Rather, he thinks that it is in the very nature of things, that the forces we perceive as 
having disappeared, act in a different way.124 
Colding tries to make this idea a general law of nature.125 To achieve this goal, he 
does not do research on various forces but focuses on the disappearance of mechanical 
force and the appearance of heat. The result of his research was presented to the 
Danish Society of Sciences in 1843. The paper Theses on force was published in 
1856. 
2.3.1 
1843: Force, Heat and the Proportionality 
In 1843, Colding defends the thesis that forces of nature are imperishable. He 
begins the paper by mentioning several studies that corroborate his thesis. These
123 “When certain moving forces act on a material particle […] a quantity of motion is created, 
proportional to the acting force. This quantity of motion, in turn, is transmitted to the surrounding 
material particles and propagated from them in the same manner, without cessation, so that within 
a short time the originally introduced quantity of motion is distributed through such a large mass 
that no perceptible trace of this activity remains” (Colding 1856, p. 1).  
124 “it does not seem to me that there is any justiﬁcation for assuming that some activity may be 
gradually lost in matter without in any way appearing as perceptible effect in its original amount; it 
seems to me even more in the nature of things that those forces which seemingly vanish must again 
appear, acting in other ways. This thought occurred to me long ago, and I have never been able to 
discard it” (ibid. p. 1). 
125 “I have […] become so convinced of the validity of this thesis that I will attempt to propose 
as a general law of nature: when a force seems to disappear it merely undergoes a transformation, 
whereupon it becomes effective in other forms” (ibid. p. 1).

Fig. 2.18 Colding’s apparatus from the front, side and top viewpoints. The apparatus consists of 
two parallel brass bars, a little over two meters long, on which a small “sled” slides (Colding, 
1856)127 
are compression experiments (with gases, liquids and solids), friction experiments 
and experiments on breaking iron rods (Colding, 1856, p. 1–2) The results of these 
studies, however, are not sufﬁcient to prove his thesis. Hence, he undertakes some 
laboratory work. The experiments carried out consist of moving a small sled over 
bars and determining the variation of heat as a function of the weight of the sled.126 
This mechanism, represented in Fig. 2.18, is analogous to Coulomb’s in the study of 
mechanical machines. 
The sled carries balls, the number of which allows its weight to vary.128 It is pulled 
by hand thanks to a string attached to it at one end.129 The distance covered by the 
sled is the same in all experiments. The course is performed twice with roughly the 
same speed.130 The expansion of the ribbons at the bottom of the sled and the bars 
of the rail provide an indication of the heat developed. An instrument, which reacts 
to the variation of length and gives an account of the variation of heat, is attached to 
the sled and another one to one of the bars.131 
126 “However, since the results which emerge from the indicated experiments are quite insufﬁcient 
for deciding whether the proposed law is correct or not, and since to my knowledge other signiﬁcant 
experiments on the evolution of heat from friction are not available for deciding this, I have myself 
undertaken […] a series of experiments with various solid bodies subjected to different pressures 
and speeds. Still, these experiments should only be regarded as preliminary […] since the apparatus 
which I have utilized is not sufﬁciently accurate” (ibid. p. 3). 
127 On Colding’s apparatus, although constructed about 1844, see Kragh (2009, p. 9).  
128 “The pressure is produced by a sled-load […] and the force necessary to pull the sled is obtained 
from a dynamometer” (ibid. p. 4). 
129 “The sled is pulled by hand with the aid of a rope and is guided by lists of wood along the sides 
of the track” (ibid. p. 4). 
130 “The speed with which the track was traversed was approximately 2 feet per second in all 
measurements” (ibid. p. 4). 
131 “Consider an apparatus similar to that used by Coulomb in his investigation of friction; namely, 
a sled whose runners are ﬁtted with underlying metal strips which are to be examined in regard to 
the heat produced by friction. The track on which it slides is overlaid with a similar pair of rails. If 
the sled, loaded with cannon balls, is moved from one end of the track to the other, these surfaces 
will expand because of the heat from friction, and if the expansion of the sled runner as well as the 
track is measured with a delicate sensing lever, one can read off the quantity of heat evolved by 
the friction, since the quantity of heat […] can be taken to be proportional to the degree of heat, or 
expansion […]” (ibid. p. 3).

Colding performs 10 series of experiments. The difference between them is the 
weight of the sled and the materials used for the ribbons: brass, zinc, lead, linden 
wood, linden wood wrapped in ﬂannel and iron (ibid. p. 6–11). In all the series, the 
driving force employed to pull the sled is measured thanks to a dynamometer, and 
the heat developed, through his sensors. Let us consider the ﬁrst three series. 
In the ﬁrst, the weight of the sled was 88.75 lb. (44.375 kg). Thirty-two measure-
ments were taken, as a result of which the average value of the force and the heat 
developed was calculated: 30.3 lb. for force and 2° of heat. 
In the second series, the sled weighed 53.5 lb. (26.75 kg). Fifty measurements 
were taken and the average values were: 19.7 lb. for force and 1.32° of heat. 
In the third series, the weight of the sled was 31 pounds. Fifty-six measurements 
were taken, with the results: 11 pounds for force and 0.72° of heat (Table 2.1). 
Colding improves the presentation of the results by expressing the values of force 
and heat through the latter values, 11 and 0.72 respectively. Thus, the ratio between 
30.3 lb. of the ﬁrst series and 11 lb. is 2.75; and the ratio between 2° of heat and 0.72 
is 2.77. Analogously, for the second series: 
StartFraction 19.7 Over 11 EndFraction equals 1.79 and StartFraction 1.32 Over 0.72 EndFraction equals 1.83 period
Sta rtFract ion 19.7 Over 11 EndFraction equals 1.79 and StartFraction 1.32 Over 0.72 EndFraction equals 1.83 period
Start Fraction 19.7 Over 11 EndFraction equals 1.79 and StartFraction 1.32 Over 0.72 EndFraction equals 1.83 period
Putting the data together, we have (Table 2.2). 
The results of the remaining series are presented in the same way. Displayed in 
ascending order, we have (Table 2.3, Fig.  2.19)132 :
Given these values, Colding concludes that the amount of heat developed is propor-
tional to the motive force lost.133 This result, together with the studies on the relation 
of lost force and gained heat referred to in the beginning, satisfactorily conﬁrm
132 Besides these results, there are three more, which the author does not consider valuable. 
133 “From these two series of ratios it is clear that we are justiﬁed in concluding that the quantities 
of heat evolved are in every case proportional to the lost moving forces” (ibid. p. 12).

his thesis, says Colding, ‘when a force seems to disappear it merely undergoes a 
transformation and reappears in other forms’ (ibid. p. 13). 
2.3.2 
Conclusion 
Colding assumes that the forces of nature do not perish. Therefore, what disap-
pears reappears in another form. Experiments are conducted to corroborate this idea. 
Observation shows that forces disappear, but Colding argues, they do not destroy 
themselves but are transformed. The elements of this transformation are observable, 
such as mechanical action and heat. A way of equating this relationship is proposed: 
if the mechanical action is quantitatively representable by q, the effect must be set 
equal to q. Using this expression, we would arrive at an equation of the form 
q left parenthesis m e c h a n i c a l u n i t s right parenthesis equals upper Q left parenthesis u n i t s o f h e a t right parenthesis period
Colding did not write an equation like this, which could have provided him with a 
value of the mechanical equivalent of heat. What he concludes from his experimental 
work is that

Taking into account the thesis of imperishability of the forces of nature and this 
result, one realizes that the contribution of the result to the thesis lies in the following. 
The more force one applies, the more heat appears. Therefore, the increase in force 
was not lost; it appeared as heat. If Colding had employed more force and the heat 
developed was the same, he would have no argument to defend imperishability. His

experimental work satisﬁes, therefore, a necessary condition for the validity of the 
imperishability of the forces of nature. 
2.3.2.1
Mayer and Colding 
Mayer advocates the indestructibility of force. Colding advocates the imperishability 
of the forces of nature. Mayer’s indestructibility is based on the indestructibility of 
causes, and this, in turn, is based on the equality of cause and effect. Colding’s 
imperishability is a conviction: it is an idea he has had for some time. Whether 
Mayer’s causal relationship holds for a given phenomenon or not is decided by 
means of observation. To use Colding’s imperishability with regard to a phenomenon, 
we need to know what a force of nature is, which is not deﬁned. Both Mayer and 
Colding use the term transformation to justify what is different but correlated in a 
phenomenon, such as heat and motion. 
Mayer determined the mechanical equivalent of heat. Colding presents a propor-
tionality between motive force and heat. Mayer’s force has been translated by energy. 
Colding’s force cannot be. This is the force that is measured by a dynamometer.134 
2.3.2.2
Joule and Colding 
Joule determined the mechanical value of heat in 1843. Colding performed a series 
of experiments but did not determine it, even though he had theoretically operational-
ized the relationship of magnitudes that could have led to the mechanical equiva-
lent of heat. Joule interpreted the result as a consequence of the indestructibility of 
natural powers.135 This is analogous to Colding’s imperishability of the forces of 
nature. Colding’s imperishability played a role in his research. Joule came up with 
the indestructibility of natural powers after the research had been done.

Hermann von Helmholtz 
In 1847, Hermann von Helmholtz was a practicing physician. That year he presented 
a paper to the Physical Society of Berlin entitled On the conservation of force, which 
was published in the same year at his own expense. In this short book, he argues 
that there are two ultimate forces in nature, whose sum remains constant. (This is 
the sense of conservation of force in the title of the book.) One of these forces is 
called tension force and the other living force. Tension force is for example a body at a
134 Based on the data presented in Table 2.3, Dahl calculated a value for the mechanical equivalent 
of heat (Colding, 1972, p. 178–9). See also Kragh (2009, p. 9).  
135 “the grand agents of nature are, by the Creator’s ﬁat, indestructible; and that wherever mechanical 
force is expended, an exact equivalent of heat is always obtained.” (Joule, 1843, p. 158).

certain height above the ground; the falling motion is living force. A body at a certain 
height that is dropped is not only an example. It is the model of the conception. Heat, 
electrical and electromagnetic phenomena are conceived in the same way: as if there 
were particles, which acted on by tension forces go into motion. Of course, in thermal 
phenomena or electrical circuits, we do not observe such forces. In such cases, they 
can be imagined. In fact, Helmholtz needs no more than this possibility of imaging 
motion and tension forces, because when it comes to dealing with a phenomenon, he 
tells us what is to be taken as a tension force and living force in that phenomenon. 
Since we thus know what corresponds to both forces, the motion of the particles is 
superﬂuous. In a second step, Helmholtz puts the forces in an equation. So, if one 
increases, the other decreases in the same proportion. To support this, he presents 
two arguments. First, these forces have a reciprocal causal relationship; second, the 
motive force and the resultant motion are equivalent. This latter proposition, which 
is taken as a principle, is drawn from the idea, ascribed to Carnot and Clapeyron136 : 
it is impossible to get a lasting motive force out of nothing. Let us see how this works 
in phenomena. 
2.4.1 
1847: Conservation of Ultimate Forces 
Free fall is the ﬁrst phenomenon in analysis. Based on the principle just mentioned, 
the free fall motion (which is taken as a force) requires a motive force. This motive 
force is taken equivalent to the weight and height at which the body was at the 
beginning of the fall. The motive force is called force of tension and the other, vis 
viva (living force). By living force is not designated the magnitude mv2, as we saw  
before, but half of it.137 Thus, the equality between the forces comes in the form, 
one half m v squared equals w e i g h t dot h e i g h t
one ha lf m v squared eq
uals w e i g h t dot h e i g h t
Weight is given by the mass of the body and acceleration due to gravitation,138 
one half m v squared equals m g h
one ha lf m 
v squared equals m g h
136 “Wir gehen aus von der Annahme, dass es unmöglich sei durch irgend eine Combination von 
Naturkörpern bewegende Kraft fortdauernd aus nichts zu erschaffen. Aus diesem Satze haben schon 
Carnot und Clapeyron eine Reihe […]” (Helmholtz 1882, p. 17). 
137 “Der besseren Uebereinstimmung wegen mit der jetzt gebräuchlichen Art die Intensität der 
Kräfte zu messen, schlage ich vor, gleich die Grösse 1/2 mv2 als Quantität der lebendigen Kraft zu 
bezeichnen, wodurch sie identisch wird mit dem Maasse der Arbeitsgrösse” (ibid. p. 18). 
138 “Die Arbeitsgrösse, welche gewonnen und verbraucht wird, kann bekanntlich ausgedrückt 
werden als ein auf eine bestimmte Höhe h gehobenes Gewicht m; sie ist dann m g h, wo  g die 
Intensität der Schwerkraft. Um senkrecht frei in die Höhe h emporzusteigen braucht der Körper m 
die Geschwindigkeit v equals StartRoot 2 g h EndRoot
√
v equals StartRoot 2 g h EndRoot; und erlangt dieselbe wieder beim Herabfallen. Es ist also ½mv2 
= mgh” (ibid. p. 18).

The next step consists in generalizing the principle to central forces.139 The vari-
ation of the living force of a body or atom, more exactly, the difference between the 
living force at the end of the path and at the beginning, is attributed to the acting 
forces. Thus, we have

where ϕ stands for the acting force and r for the distance between the bodies.140 The 
equation is then read as follows: the increase in the living force of a moving point 
under the inﬂuence of a central force is equal to the sum of the tension forces.141 
Thus, the sum of the living and tension forces is constant, which is the content of the 
principle of conservation of force.142 
139 “Wir wollen dem besprochenen Gesetze für die Fälle, wo Centralkräfte wirken, nun noch einen 
allgemeineren Ausdruck geben” (ibid. p. 21). 
140 The minus sign of the integral is conventional: the intensity of the force is taken as positive in 
attraction and negative in repulsion. If the ﬁnal velocity is greater than the initial velocity then the 
difference between the two is positive. The ﬁnal distance R is smaller than the initial r because 
the moving body was farther away from the body that is attracting it and has moved closer. If 
the primitive of ϕ(R) is less than that of ϕ(r), then the minus sign before the integral becomes 
necessary. If the primitive of ϕ(R) is greater than that of ϕ(r), the minus sign is not necessary, but 
the tension force decreases with the distance. Helmholtz took the former option. “Ist ϕ die Intensität 
der Kraft, welche in der Richtung von r wirkt, wenn sie anzieht, als positiv, wenn sie abstösst, als 
negativ gesetzt [...] wenn Q und R, q und r zusammengehörige Tangentialgeschwindigkeiten und

dem Verlust der letzteren. Es ist also stets die Summe der vorhandenen lebendigen und Spannkräfte 
constant. In dieser allgemeinsten Form können wir unser Gesetz als das Princip von der Erhaltung 
der Kraft bezeichnen” (ibid. pp. 24–5).

The presentation of this principle in Mechanics143 is followed by the defense of 
its validity for the other domains of Physics. The sections of the book concerning 
these domains are signiﬁcantly titled: “force equivalent of heat”, “force equivalent of 
electrical phenomena” and “force equivalent of magnetism and electromagnetism”. 
The ﬁnal part of the book, on living beings, has no title. 
The force equivalent of heat 
The term ‘force equivalent of heat’ could lead one to think of the quantity of force 
equivalent to a given amount of heat. If that quantity were the thermal unit, then it 
would be the mechanical equivalent of heat. This is not the case. ‘Equivalent force of 
heat’ refers to the way force is viewed in heat phenomena, i.e., what is to be taken as 
tension force and as living force in these phenomena. This point of view presupposes 
that heat is motion, which contradicted most physicists of that time for whom heat 
was a substance. Helmholtz will understandably counter-argue the thesis of heat as 
a substance. He will also argue against this thesis that force is not conserved. Let us 
start with these counterarguments. 
Helmholtz addresses the cases in which absolute loss of force was admitted: 
inelastic collision and friction.144 His argument goes as follows. In the collided 
body, there is a change in shape and a change in density, thus an increase in the force 
of tension. Furthermore, when the collision is repeated, as for example when a metal 
is hit with a hammer, heat is detected. On the other hand, some of the effect passes 
into the air as sound.145 In friction, besides the change of shape and the displacement 
of particles on the surface, there are thermal and electrical changes.146 In short, to 
the absolute loss of force in inelastic collision and friction, Helmholtz counterposes 
effects arising from these phenomena. He is not interested in the various effects, but 
in the heat effect. 
He then asks the question of whether in a loss of mechanical force a certain 
amount of heat arises. The answer to this is in the afﬁrmative. The argument put 
forward comes from Joule’s water friction experiments from 1843 and 1845.147 (The 
value of the mechanical equivalent of heat as determined by Joule is called into
143 “Wir gehen jetzt zu den speciellen Anwendungen des Gesetzes von der Constanz der Kraft über. 
Zuerst haben wir diejenigen Fälle kurz zu erwähnen, in denen das Princip von der Erhaltung der 
lebendigen Kraft bisher schon benutzt und anerkannt ist” (ibid. p. 27). 
144 “Diejenigen mechanischen Vorgänge, bei welchen man bisher einen absoluten Verlust von Kraft 
angenommen hat, sind: (1) Der Stoss unelastischer Körper […], (2) Die Reibung” (ibid. pp. 31–2). 
145 “Derselbe ist meist mit einer Formveränderung und Verdichtung der gestossenen Körper 
verbunden, also mit Vermehrung der Spannkräfte; dann ﬁnden wir bei oft wiederholten Stössen der 
Art eine beträchtliche Wärmeentwickelung, z. B. beim Hämmern eines Metallstückes; endlich wird 
ein Theil der Bewegung als Schall an die anstossenden festen und luftförmigen Körper abgegeben” 
(ibid. pp. 31–2). 
146 “sowohl an den Oberﬂächen zweier sich über einander hinbewegender Körper, als im Innern 
derselben bei Formveränderungen […] Auch bei der Reibung ﬁnden meistens geringe Verän-
derungen in der moleculären Constitution der Körper […] Ausserdem ﬁnden aber stets auch 
thermische und electrische Aenderungen statt” (ibid. p. 32). 
147 “Zur Lösung der ersteren Frage sind erst wenige Versuche angestellt. Joule hat die 
Wärmemengen untersucht, welche bei der Reibung des Wassers in engen Röhren und in einem

question, but the existence of an equivalence between mechanical power and heat is 
admitted.148 ) 
He then asks the question: to what extent can an amount of heat correspond to a 
mechanical force? There is no direct answer to this question. Helmholtz goes on to 
attack the heat substance thesis instead. The theory of heat as a substance must neces-
sarily admit that the amount of heat remains constant. In that case, the production of 
work must originate in the expansion of the substance, says Helmholtz.149 This thesis 
is not directly denied. He rather goes on to show that the heat-substance concept is 
not adequate for the explanation of thermal phenomena in general. The explanation 
of heat arising from friction is the ﬁrst difﬁculty pointed out in that theory. The 
heat-substance theory would have to admit that the heat comes from outside.150 This 
explanation has, however, no experimental proof, Helmholtz argues.151 
An alternative to this explanation, due to Berthollet, is to admit that the heat 
of friction is originated by the compression of the surface and the rubbed parts. 
Helmholtz counterargues, this explanation is contradicted by several experiments, 
such as the melting of ice by friction performed by Davy.152 
Another counterargument looks at the material theory of heat from another point 
of view: the amount of heat can absolutely be increased through motion. (If it can be 
increased, then the amount of heat varies. Therefore, heat cannot be substance). Here 
the experiment with the magneto-electric machine (Joule, 1843) is adduced. As long 
as there is motion of the magnet in the vicinity of the coil, there is electric current, 
which gives rise to heat.153 Now, continues Helmholtz, heat cannot come from the 
parts of the machine, since it can be produced indeﬁnitely.154 Therefore, concludes

148 “Indessen entsprechen seine Messungsmethoden zu wenig der Schwierigkeit der Untersuchung, 
als dass diese Resultate irgendwie auf Genauigkeit Anspruch machen könnten; wahrscheinlich sind 
diese Zahlen zu hoch, weil […]” (ibid. p. 33). 
149 “Die materielle Theorie der Wärme muss nothwendig die Quantität des Wärmestoffs als constant 
ansehen; mechanische Kraft kann er nach ihr nur durch sein Streben sich auszudehnen erzeugen. 
Für sie kann das Kräftäquivalent der Wärme also auch nur in der Arbeit bestehen, welche dieselbe 
bei ihrem Uebergang aus einer höheren in eine niedere Temperatur leistet; in diesem Sinne haben 
Carnot und Clapeyron die Aufgabe bearbeitet […]” (ibid. p. 33). 
150 “Um die Reibungswärme zu erklären, muss die materielle Theorie entweder annehmen, dass 
dieselbe von aussen zugeleitet sei, nach W. Henry, oder dass dieselbe nach Berthollet durch 
Compression der Oberﬂächen und der abgeriebenen Theile entstehe” (ibid. pp. 33–4). 
151 “Der ersteren Annahme fehlt bisher noch jede Erfahrung” (ibid. p. 34). 
152 “die zweite […] scheitert ganz bei der Reibung von Flüssigkeiten und bei den Versuchen, wo 
Eisenkeile durch Hämmern glühend und weich gemacht, Eisstücke durch Reibung geschmolzen 
werden” (ibid. p. 34).  
153 “Derselbe Fall ﬁndet bei den magnetelectrischen Maschinen statt; so lange Magnet und Anker 
gegeneinander bewegt werden, entstehen electrische Ströme, welche im Schliessungsdraht Wärme 
erzeugen” (ibid. p. 35). 
154 “Es kann hier offenbar aus den die Maschine constituirenden Körpern in das Unendliche Wärme 
entwickelt werden, ohne dass dieselbe irgendwo verschwände” (ibid. p. 35). 

2.4 Hermann von Helmholtz

Helmholtz, heat phenomena cannot be explained by a substance, to which he adds, 
they must be explained as motion.155 
About the motion of which heat would consist, an idea is given, but announced 
as a mere hypothesis.156 Indeed, it is not necessary to specify the kind of motion 
that heat consists of. It is enough for Helmholtz that heat phenomena can be thought 
of as motion.157 Let heat then be a kind of motion. How can the ultimate forces of 
nature, tension forces and living forces be understood then? The quantity of heat, 
says Helmholtz, is to be understood as the sum of the living forces of heat motion 
and the forces of tension in the atoms. (Atoms were not observable. Therefore, there 
were no experimental conditions to test the thesis.) The heat connected to the living 
forces would correspond to the so-called free heat (the heat that is detectable by a 
thermometer) and the heat connected to the tension forces, to the latent heat.158 
Finally, Helmholtz highlights the explanatory power of the theory. The conser-
vation of force could account for the phenomena of heat conduction and radiation, 
among others, that until then had been explained by the conservation of the quantity of 
heat-substance.159 The theory would also explain the phenomena of the appearance of 
heat in chemical processes. The argument is: the forces of chemical attraction (tension 
forces) would give rise to motion, whose amount of living force would manifest itself 
in the heat arising.160 The theory would also be able to subsume the disappearance 
of heat where there is the production of work. Here Joule’s (1845a, b) experiment, in
155 “Aus diesen Tathsachen folgt nun, dass die Quantität der Wärme absolut vermehrt werden könne 
durch mechanische Kräfte, dass deshalb die Wärmeerscheinungen nicht hergeleitet werden können 
von einem Stoffe, welcher durch sein blosses Vorhandensein dieselben bedinge, sondern dass sie 
abzuleiten seien von Veränderungen, von Bewegungen” (ibid. p. 35). 
156 “Wenn es erlaubt ist einen Versuch zu machen den Begriff dieser Bewegung noch bestimmter 
zu fassen, so scheint im Allgemeinen eine der Ansicht von Ampère sich anschliessende Hypothese 
dem jetzigen Zustand der Wissenschaft am besten zu entsprechen. Denken wir uns die Körper aus 
Atomen gebildet [...]” (ibid. p. 35). 
157 “auch ist für unseren Zweck die Einsicht der Möglichkeit hinreichend, dass die Wärmeerschei-
nungen als Bewegungen gefasst werden können” (ibid. p. 36). 
158 “Das, was bisher Quantität der Wärme genannt worden ist, würde hiernach der Ausdruck sein 
erstens für die Quantität der lebendigen Kraft der Wärmebewegung, und zweitens für die Quantität 
derjenigen Spannkräfte in den Atomen, welche bei einer Veränderung ihrer Anordnung eine solche 
Bewegung hervorbringen können; der erstere Theil würde dem entsprechen, was bisher freie, der 
zweite dem, was latente Wärme genannt ist” (ibid. p. 35). 
159 “Die Erhaltung der Kraft würde bei dieser Bewegung so weit stattﬁnden, als bisher die Erhaltung 
der Quantität des Wärmestoffes erkannt ist, nämlich bei allen Erscheinungen der Leitung und 
Strahlung aus einem Körper zu dem andern, bei der Bindung und Entbindung von Wärme durch 
Aenderung des Aggregatzustandes” (ibid. p. 36). 
160 “Es bleibt die Wärmeentwickelung durch chemische Processe. Man hat dieselbe bisher für ein 
Freiwerden von Wärmestoff erklärt […] Nach unserer Vorstellungsweise würde die bei chemischen 
Processen entstehende Wärme die Quantität der lebendigen Kraft sein, welche durch die bestimmte 
Quantität der chemischen Anziehungskräfte hervorgebracht werden kann, und das obige Gesetz 
würde der Ausdruck für das Princip von der Erhaltung der Kraft in diesem Falle werden” (ibid. 
pp. 36–7).

which compressed air is released and causes water to move, is adduced.161 Helmholtz 
still stresses that Clapeyron’s predictions, which were conform to measurements, are 
in agreement with those of Holtzmann, who establishes a relationship between heat 
and mechanical effect (Appendix F).162 
Force equivalent of electricity 
In the section ‘force equivalent of electricity’, we learn what is to be understood by 
tension force and living force in electrical phenomena. In the case of two charges, 
the intensity of the central force between them is proportional to the charges and 
inversely proportional to the square of the distance. The variation of the living force, 
when they are brought from a certain distance to another, is given by the tension 
force.163 
Let us move on to one of the examples with electric current, the phenomenon 
discovered by Peltier. If electric current ﬂows through two metals that are welded at 
the ends, it turns out that at the weld locations, there is heating or cooling. How can 
this phenomenon be looked at according to the law of conservation of force? If this 
law holds, there must be tension force and living force. Helmholtz considers that the 
heat from the battery corresponds to the tension force, and the heat in the circuit to 
the living force. The heat coming from the battery (chemical action) is given as AJdt, 
where A stands for electromotive force, J for current intensity and dt for a short time 
interval. (We will not penetrate into the meaning of this expression. We are interested 
in how Helmholtz constructs an equation with these terms and what he does with it.) 
The heat appearing in the circuit due to the current is given by Joule’s or Lenz’s law, 
i.e., WJ2dt, where W represents resistance. The quantities of heat at the ends (where 
the metals are welded) are given as q1dt and -q2dt. The law of conservation of force 
leads to an equation, in which the ﬁrst member concerns the force of tension and 
the second, the living force. In the ﬁrst, the heat coming from the battery (force of 
tension) appears and in the other, the heat of the remaining circuit (living force),

Thus, we have
161 “Ob bei der Erzeugung mechanischer Kraft Wärme verschwinde, was ein nothwendiges Postulat 
der Erhaltung der Kraft sein würde, ist noch niemals gefragt worden. Ich kann dafür nur einen 
Versuch von Joule anführen, der ziemlich zuverlässig zu sein scheint. Derselbe fand nämlich, dass 
die Luft bei dem Ausströmen aus einem Behälter […] das umgebende Wasser um 4˚.085 F. erkältete, 
sobald sie in die Atmosphäre ausströmte, also deren Widerstand zu überwinden hatte” (ibid. p. 37). 
162 “übrigens folgt seine [Clapeyron] speciellere Formel für Gase, welche allein durch Vergleichung 
mit der Erfahrung unterstützt ist, auch aus der Formel von Holtzmann” (ibid. p. 39).

From this equation Helmholtz draws a consequence. Whether this consequence 
holds or not, he did not know. He claimed, more experimental research was needed.165 
In sum, Helmholtz teachs us how to distinguish between force of tension and 
living force regarding the Peltier effect. The source of the circuit is taken as the 
former and all the rest as the latter. The law of force conservation provides the 
equality between them. At the end, this approach has a heuristic function. Whether 
or not the consequences of the law hold true would have to be tested. 
Force equivalent of magnetism and electromagnetism 
The ﬁrst topic in this ﬁeld is analogous to the ﬁrst of the electricity section. Instead 
of two charges, we have now two magnets. The central force between two magnetic 
poles is proportional to their intensity and inversely proportional to the square of the 
distance, symbolically, 
phi  equals minus StartFraction m 1 m 2 Over r squared EndFraction
phi
 equals minus StartFraction m 1 m 2 Over r squared EndFraction
The variation of the living force is linked with the force of tension in the same 
way mutatis mutandis as we have seen for electric charges.166 
Let us now consider the motion of a magnet under the inﬂuence of electric current. 
In this case, we have a battery, which is at the source of the current, and the other part 
of the circuit, where the current ﬂows, and a magnet, which moves. Helmholtz tells 
us what concerns force of tension and living force and then applies the conservation 
of force,

He puts what concerns the battery on one side of the equation and the rest, on 
the other. The heat that develops in the battery and in the circuit during a short time 
interval dt were known, namely AJdt and J2Wdt (as seen above). Now Helmholtz 
expresses these quantities in mechanical terms, by multiplying them by the mechan-
ical equivalent of heat. Thus, symbolizing this by a, we have  aAJdt, for the battery 
(force of tension), and aJ2Wdt, for the ﬂow of the electric current (living force). The 
term relating to the magnet (living force) is given by upper J StartFraction d upper V Over d t EndFraction d t
upper J StartFraction d upper V Over d t EndFraction d t, where V is the potential 
with respect to the unit current. Putting the terms together we have167

In sum, the sense of force equivalent in electromagnetism is analogous to what 
we saw for electricity. The ‘force equivalent’ is what in this kind of phenomena 
corresponds to the tension force and to the living force. The law of conservation of 
force gives us the equation between the two forces. This equation has then a heuristic 
function. 
On living beings 
The ﬁnal and briefest part of the book concerns living beings. Plants have a large 
amount of chemical tension forces and absorb only one form of living forces during 
growth, the radiation from sunlight. There were no indications, however, to express 
the equivalent of force in this ﬁeld.169 Regarding animals, there were more indica-
tions. They expend a certain amount of chemical tension forces and produce motion

and heat, but still the indications were not precise enough for the discussion of the 
conservation of force, according to Helmholtz.170 
Conclusion 
In dealing with phenomena, Helmholtz has a conceptual framework that he applies 
to the observable and non-observable phenomena. By observable I mean the falling 
motion, the two electric charges or the two magnets poles considered above. In cases 
such as electric currents or heat phenomena, tension forces and living forces are 
not observable. In such cases, Helmholtz uses observables and interprets them, e.g. 
the battery that powers the circuit is subsumed by tension force and what follows 
by living force; latent heat corresponds to the tension force and sensible heat to the 
living force. The justiﬁcation for using this conceptual framework is provided by the 
theoretical construction presented at the beginning of the book, which comes next. 
Foundation of the approach 
The core of Helmholtz’s approach lies in the thesis, there are two ultimate forces in 
nature whose sum is constant. The argumentation behind the thesis starts as follows. 
The task of the theoretical part of science consists of the search for the ultimate 
causes of phenomena, according to the law of causality.171 This means that if the 
causes by which phenomena are explained are changeable, one must continue the 
search until the ultimate causes are found.172 
What are the ultimate causes? 
To characterize ultimate causes, Helmholtz starts from the relation of the subject of 
scientiﬁc knowledge to external objects, that is, how objects in science are regarded 
from this primordial point of view. Science, Helmholtz continues, considers the 
objects of the external world according to a double abstraction, matter and force.173 
Matter as such has no effect on our sense organs. The effects that objects have on
170 “Für die Thiere haben wir schon einige, nähere Anhaltpunkte. Dieselben nehmen die compli-
cirten oxydablen Verbindungen, welche von den Pﬂanzen erzeugt werden, und Sauerstoff in sich auf, 
geben dieselben theils verbrannt als Kohlensäure und Wasser, theils auf einfachere Verbindungen 
reducirt wieder von sich, verbrauchen also eine gewisse Quantität chemischer Spannkräfte und 
erzeugen dafür Wärme und mechanische Kräfte […] so reducirt sich die Frage nach der Erhaltung 
der Kraft ungefähr auf die […] Diese Frage kann nach den Versuchen von Dulong und Despretz 
wenigstens annähernd bejaht werden” (ibid. p. 66). 
171 “Der theoretische Theil derselben sucht dagegen, die unbekannten Ursachen der Vorgänge aus 
ihren sichtbaren Wirkungen zu ﬁnden; er sucht dieselben zu begreifen nach dem Gesetze der 
Causalität” (ibid. p. 13). 
172 “Das endliche Ziel der theoretischen Naturwissenschaften ist also, die letzten unveränderlichen 
Ursachen der Vorgänge in der Natur aufzuﬁnden” (ibid. p. 13). 
173 “Die Wissenschaft betrachtet die Gegenstände der Aussenwelt nach zweierlei Abstractionen: 
einmal ihrem blossen Dasein nach, abgesehen von ihren Wirkungen auf andere Gegenstände oder 
unsere Sinnesorgane; als solche bezeichnet sie dieselben als Materie […] Wenn wir also den Begriff 
der Materie in der Wirklichkeit anwenden wollen, so dürfen wir dies nur, indem wir durch eine zweite 
Abstraction demselben wiederum hinzufügen, wovon wir vorher abstrahiren wollten, nämlich das 
Vermögen Wirkungen auszuüben, d. h. indem wir derselben Kräfte zuertheilen” (ibid. p. 14).

us are forces.174 It is therefore erroneous, Helmholtz continues, to consider matter 
real and force not.175 Matter and force are abstractions.176 Furthermore, they are 
inseparable,177 because it is by means of force that we infer the existence of matter.178 
From this follows a ﬁrst speciﬁcation of the task of theoretical science. Since the 
existence of matter is inferred from force, the search for ultimate causes is the search 
for immutable forces.179 Now, by the sense of force, immutable forces is what reaches 
our sense organs in an invariable way in time. But by the same sense of force, what 
reaches us in a constant way reﬂects what is permanent in matter. Thus, Helmholtz 
takes ‘immutable forces’ to mean ‘indestructible qualities of matter’. These qualities 
had been determined by chemistry. The indestructible qualities of matter are the 
elements.180 
If we think of the world, says Helmholtz, as consisting of elements, which by 
themselves do not change, any change in the world has to be spatial. It is therefore 
movement.181 Since any change can only come from motion, phenomena must be 
traced back to movements of matter. The driving force of these motions can only 
depend on spatial relations.182 To characterize these driving forces, Helmholtz imag-
ines a bounded space where there are at least two bodies.183 The change in the spatial
174 “Das Dasein der Materie an sich ist uns also ein ruhiges, wirkungsloses […] Qualitative Unter-
schiede dürfen wir der Materie an sich nicht zuschreiben, denn wenn wir von verschiedenartigen 
Materien sprechen, so setzen wir ihre Verschiedenheit immer nur in die Verschiedenheit ihrer 
Wirkungen d. h. in ihre Kräfte” (ibid. p. 14). 
175 “Ebenso fehlerhaft ist es, die Materie für etwas Wirkliches, die Kraft für einen blossen Begriff 
erklären zu wollen, dem nichts Wirkliches entspräche” (ibid. p. 14). 
176 “beides sind vielmehr Abstractionen von dem Wirklichen, in ganz gleicher Art gebildet; wir 
können ja die Materie eben nur durch ihre Kräfte, nie an sich selbst, wahrnehmen” (ibid. p. 14). 
177 “Es ist einleuchtend, dass die Begriffe von Materie und Kraft in der Anwendung auf die Natur 
nie getrennt werden dürfen” (ibid. p. 14). 
178 “Die Gegenstände der Natur sind aber nicht wirkungslos, ja wir kommen überhaupt zu ihrer 
Kenntniss nur durch die Wirkungen, welche von ihnen aus auf unsere Sinnesorgane erfolgen, indem 
wir aus diesen Wirkungen auf ein Wirkendes schliessen” (ibid. p. 14). 
179 “Wir haben oben gesehen, dass die Naturerscheinungen auf unveränderliche letzte Ursachen 
zurückgeführt werden sollen; diese Forderung gestaltet sich nun so, dass als letzte Ursachen der 
Zeit nach unveränderliche Kräfte gefunden werden sollen” (ibid. p. 14). 
180 “Materien mit unveränderlichen Kräften (unvertilgbaren Qualitäten) haben wir in der 
Wissenschaft (chemische) Elemente genannt” (ibid. p. 15). 
181 “Denken wir uns aber das Weltall zerlegt in Elemente mit unveränderlichen Qualitäten, so sind 
die einzigen noch möglichen Aenderungen in einem solchen System räumliche, d. h. Bewegungen” 
(ibid. p. 15). 
182 “die äusseren Verhältnisse, durch welche die Wirkung der Kräfte modiﬁcirt wird, können nur 
noch räumliche sein, also die Kräfte nur Bewegungskräfte, abhängig in ihrer Wirkung nur von 
den räumlichen Verhältnissen. Also näher bestimmt: Die Naturerscheinungen sollen zurückgeführt 
werden auf Bewegungen von Materien mit unveränderlichen Bewegungskräften, welche nur von 
den räumlichen Verhältnissen abhängig sind” (ibid. p. 15). 
183 “Räumliche Verhältnisse sind nur möglich gegen abgegrenzte Raumgrössen, nicht gegen den 
unterschiedslosen leeren Raum. Bewegung kann deshalb in der Erfahrung nur vorkommen als 
Aenderung der räumlichen Verhältnisse wenigstens zweier materieller Körper gegen einander” 
(ibid. p. 15).

relationship of these bodies can only be approximation or distancing, according to 
Helmholtz184 If the change can only be approximation and distancing, it is under-
standable that Helmholtz comes to the conclusion that the forces that cause motion 
are either attractive or repulsive.185 
Thus, Helmholtz arrives at the complete characterization of the task of theoretical 
science: explanation of phenomena by means of attractive or repulsive forces, which 
are directed along the line connecting the masses and dependent on distance between 
these.186 
The task of physics is then to explain phenomena by these forces, called ultimate 
forces. In the case of falling bodies, the ultimate forces are found by observation in 
the sense that the body at a certain height (tension force) and the falling motion (living 
force) are observable. In the case of heat this is no longer the case. If one, however, 
admits that ultimate forces exist (which is justiﬁed conceptually) and accepts the 
task of physics (to explain phenomena by ultimate forces), it remains to imagine 
what is going on in the phenomena. This imagining act plays, however, a secondary 
role. It does not matter what motion the heat consists of but rather that heat can be 
thought of as motion. The same holds mutatis mutandis for the other cases. Indeed, 
we are taught about the correspondence between the ultimate forces and observable 
components of phenomena (battery, magnet, etc.). Hence, we have what we need to 
apply the law of conservation of force. 
The advantages of Helmholtz’s approach, following the author, is in the greater 
explanatory capacity of thermal phenomena in comparison with the theory of substan-
tial heat and in the heuristic character of the equations he arrived at concerning 
electricity and electromagnetism. 
2.4.2 
Conclusion 
Helmholtz assumes that no lasting force can exist out of nothing. Therefore, the 
force has to come from something. What forces exist and where they come from 
appears in the philosophical foundation of the theory. The forces that exist are taken 
from a thought experiment: two (chemical) elements isolated from the rest. This
184 “Bewegungskraft, als ihre Ursache, also auch immer nur erschlossen werden für das Verhältniss 
mindestens zweier Körper gegen einander, sie ist also zu deﬁniren als das Bestreben zweier Massen, 
ihre gegenseitige Lage zu wechseln” (ibid. p. 15). 
185 “Eine Bewegungskraft, welche sie gegen einander ausüben, kann deshalb auch nur Ursache zur 
Aenderung ihrer Entfernung sein, d. h. eine anziehende oder abstossende […] Die Kräfte, welche 
zwei Massen auf einander ausüben, müssen nothwendig ihrer Grösse und Richtung nach bestimmt 
sein, sobald die Lage der Massen vollständig gegeben ist. Durch zwei Punkte ist aber nur eine 
einzige Richtung vollständig gegeben, nämlich die ihrer Verbindungslinie; folglich müssen die 
Kräfte, welche sie gegen einander ausüben, nach dieser Linie gerichtet sein, und ihre Intensität 
kann nur von der Entfernung abhängen” (ibid. pp. 15–6). 
186 “Es bestimmt sich also endlich die Aufgabe der physikalischen Naturwissenschaften dahin, 
die Naturerscheinungen zurückzuführen auf unveränderliche, anziehende und abstossende Kräfte, 
deren Intensität von der Entfernung abhängt” (ibid. p. 16).

experience does not allow internal change of the bodies because they are elements, 
nor does it allow rotation or translation of the elements outside the direction that 
connects them. What can be observed in such a case are movements of the elements 
toward or away from each other. From these movements Helmholtz infers that they 
are caused. (This is justiﬁed: these movements represent a force (vis viva) and by the 
adopted principle a lasting force must have a cause.) As there are only two elements, 
these must have the ability to attract or reject. If the elements have this ability, then 
the thought experiment can only have the result that it has. Therefore, it is not the 
thought experiment that leads us to believe that there can only be two ultimate forces 
in nature, but that these are presupposed in advance. 
Admitted the ultimate forces, Helmholtz moves on to the application to 
phenomena. He tells us, the battery in a circuit represents or has tension force. We 
cannot observe the parts of the battery between which the tension would exist, and 
we have no other indications from the author about this. This assigning of ‘tension 
force’ to the battery and ‘living force’ to the rest of the circuit has a role, however. It 
allows us to write equations of the form
normal u pper D e lta t e n s i o n f o r c e equals normal upper Delta l i v i n g f o r c e period
These equations then play a heuristic role. From them, Helmholtz derives new 
information about the phenomena. In one case it was conﬁrmed, in the other, not. 
(Bevilacqua, 1993, pp. 331–2). 
2.4.2.1
Mayer and Helmholtz 
Mayer assumes that cause equals effect. It is up to the observer to determine, whether 
a causal relationship exists in a given phenomenon. If there is, then cause and effect 
are forces, whereby 
f o r c e left  p arenthesis c a u s e right parenthesis equals f o r c e left parenthesis e f f e c t right parenthesis
Helmholtz arrives at an equation of this form through the ultimate forces,
normal u pper D e lta t e n s i o n f o r c e equals normal upper Delta l i v i n g f o r c e period
What each of them takes from the equations is different. From the equation in 
terms of heat and motion, Mayer takes the mechanical equivalent of heat. Helmholtz 
does not calculate the equivalent. He uses the equations for heuristic purposes. 
The mechanical equivalent of heat is the foundation of Mayer’s conservation of 
force. Transformation of force is also referred to the equivalent: it is the expression 
of a relation of quantities. Helmholtz has no experimental foundation of his idea of 
conservation of ultimate forces in the cases where these are non-observable. 
Helmholtz needs the conjecture ‘heat is motion’ to generalize to heat forces of 
mechanical character. Conjectures also appear in electricity and electromagnetism.

Mayer’s forces are observable. They are heat that can be measured, electrical effects 
that can be detected, the joining of chemicals in given quantities, etc. Hence, Mayer 
has several forms of force, whereas Helmholtz has the two ultimate forces. 
2.4.2.2
Joule and Helmholtz 
Helmholtz used Joule’s experiments to show that heat is motion. On this point they 
both agree, heat is motion. Joule even suggests the hypothesis of a kind of motion of 
which heat would consist. The proper motion of heat is of no interest to Helmholtz. 
For him, it is enough that heat can be thought of as motion. This is sufﬁcient, although 
also necessary to generalize to heat the forces of motion and tension. 
Joule performed experiments to show that heat was motion, but still and mainly to 
arrive at equations that allowed him to determine the mechanical equivalent of heat. 
Helmholtz is a user of the mechanical equivalent of heat. The equivalent serves him 
to argue against the thesis ‘heat is a substance’ and to arrive at equations that play a 
heuristic role.

Chapter 3 
A New Concept 
This chapter begins with the question that arises among experts in the theory of 
heat in the late 1840s: how to make this theory compatible with the new ﬁndings. 
Clausius resolved this issue. Thomson adhered then to the thesis that heat is motion 
and created the concept “mechanical energy”. This concept not only covers what 
was properly mechanical, but also the activity due to heat, which had become a kind 
of motion. This is how the term energy appeared in the heat theory. A year later, 
Thomson distinguishes between static and dynamic reserves of mechanical energy, 
which led to the distinction between potential and kinetic energy. It is, ﬁnally, shown 
how the different theses on energy that had appeared since the 1840s emerge as 
characteristics of energy in the 1870s. This accumulation of meanings of the term 
energy made it more difﬁcult to understand the concept. 
3.1 
Carnot’s Theory and Joule’s Experiments 
During the 1847 meeting of the British Association for the Advancement of Science 
in Oxford, William Thomson learned about Joule’s experimental work. The following 
year he published a paper in which he took a position on Carnot’s theory and Joule’s 
experiments. He accepts Joule’s interpretation in cases where work gives rise to heat; 
but not in the reverse case, heat converting into work. He writes: “the conversion of 
heat (or caloric) into mechanical effect is probably impossible*”. To this he adds a 
footnote: 
“This opinion seems to be nearly universally held by those who have written on the subject. 
A contrary opinion however has been advocated by Mr. Joule of Manchester; some very 
remarkable discoveries which he has made with reference to the generation of heat […] 
seeming to indicate an actual conversion of mechanical effect into caloric. No experiment 
however is adduced in which the converse operation is exhibited” (Thomson, 1848, p. 315).

A New Concept
He explains. The production of mechanical effect through heat, as happened in 
steam engines, was not to be seen as conversion, but as “transmission” of heat.1 He 
exposes the sense of transmission through an analogy with falling water. Just as in 
a windmill, falling water gives rise to a mechanical effect, the passage of heat from 
the hot source to the cold source through the machine gives rise to a mechanical 
effect. The analogy continues: just as the falling water can be raised to its original 
height by outside work, so heat can be taken from the cold body and returned to the 
hot body by outside mechanical action.2 This analogy, which already appeared in 
Carnot’s book, takes heat as a substance. 
There is something else that speaks for this theory. The 1848 article presents a new 
result based on Carnot’s theory of heat: an absolute thermometric scale. In opposition 
to thermometry based on the volume variation of ﬂuids, Thomson proposes a scale 
independent of substance.3 This is founded on Carnot’s theory by the following. 
Since according to Carnot, to a given temperature difference corresponds an amount 
of work, regardless of the substance used, then a mechanical effect can be used to 
deﬁne the temperature difference.4 This is what Thomson uses. To a temperature 
difference of 1 degree (between any two values) he makes correspond the same 
mechanical effect.5 
When Thomson wrote this paper, he had not yet read Carnot’s (1824) book, 
Reﬂections on the Motive Power of Fire. He knew of it indirectly, through an 1834
1 “In actual engines for obtaining mechanical effect through the agency of heat, we must conse-
quently look for the source of power, not in any absorption and conversion, but merely in a 
transmission of heat” (Thomson 1848, p. 315). 
2 “Carnot […] demonstrates that it is by the letting down of heat from a hot body to a cold body, 
through the medium of an engine (a steam-engine, or an air-engine for instance), that mechanical 
effect is to be obtained; and conversely, he proves that the same amount of heat may, by expenditure 
of an equal amount of labouring force, be raised from the cold to the hot body (the engine being 
in this case worked backwards); just as mechanical effect may be obtained by the descent of water 
let down by a waterwheel, and by spending labouring force in turning the wheel backwards, or in 
working a pump, water may be elevated to a higher level” (ibid. p. 315). 
3 “Although we have thus a strict principle for constructing a deﬁnite system for the estimation of 
temperature, yet as reference is essentially made to a speciﬁc body as the standard thermometric 
substance, we cannot consider that we have arrived at an absolute scale, and we can only regard, 
in strictness, the scale actually adopted as an arbitrary series of numbered points of reference 
sufﬁciently close for the requirements of practical thermometry. In the present state of physical 
science, therefore, a question of extreme interest arises: Is there any principle on which an absolute 
thermometric scale can be founded?” (ibid. p. 314). 
4 “The relation between motive power and heat, as established by Carnot, is such that quantities of 
heat, and  intervals of temperature, are involved as the sole elements in the expression for the amount 
of mechanical effect to be obtained through the agency of heat; and since we have, independently, a 
deﬁnite system for the measurement of quantities of heat, we are thus furnished with a measure for 
intervals according to which absolute differences of temperature may be estimated” (ibid. p. 315). 
5 “The characteristic property of the scale which I now propose is, that all degrees have the same 
value; that is, that a unit of heat descending from a body A at the temperature T° of this scale, to 
a body B at the temperature (T−1)°, would give out the same mechanical effect, whatever be the 
number T. This may justly be termed an absolute scale, since its characteristic is quite independent 
of the physical properties of any speciﬁc substance” (ibid. p. 316).

article by Clapeyron.6 He did, however, obtain a copy of the book and wrote another 
article on the theory the following year: An account of Carnot’s theory. 
This article begins by stating the two questions to which a complete theory of 
heat must answer: 
– how one can produce mechanical effect from heat; 
– how one can estimate the amount of heat required for a given effect.7 
Now, says Thomson, Carnot’s theory answers both questions: 
– the thermal agent by which mechanical effect is obtained consists of the transfer 
of heat from one body to another of lower temperature8 ; 
– the perfect thermal machine, the machine imagined by Carnot, allows us to esti-
mate the heat for a given mechanical effect.9 Now, Thomson points out, citing 
the Reﬂections, that the amount of heat in a cycle remains invariant.10 With this 
is connected the idea of heat being a substance. Being a substance, it could not 
be generated by any physical process.11 This is in contrast to Joule’s experi-
ments, Thomson continues, referring to the heat generated by the magneto-electric 
machine.12 Nevertheless, he still considers Carnot’s theory to be adequate and
6 “Réﬂexions sur la Puissance Motrice du Feu […] Having never met with the original work, it 
is only through a paper by M. Clapeyron, on the same subject […] 1834 […] that the author has 
become acquainted with Carnot’s theory” (ibid. p. 313). 
7 “The questions to be resolved by a complete theory of the subject are the following: (1) What is 
the precise nature of the thermal agency by means of which mechanical effect is to be produced, 
without effects of any other kind? 
(2) How may the amount of this thermal agency necessary for performing a given quantity of 
work be estimated?” (Thomson, 1849, pp. 541–2). 
8 “The thermal agency by which mechanical effect may be obtained, is the transference of heat from 
one body to another at a lower temperature” (ibid. p. 544). 
9 “A perfect thermo-dynamic engine of any kind, is a machine by means of which the greatest 
possible amount of mechanical effect can be obtained from a given thermal agency […] it is of 
primary importance to discover the criterion of a perfect engine. This has been done by CARNOT 
[…] A perfect thermo-dynamic engine is such that […] if an equal amount be spent in working it 
backwards, an equal reverse thermal effect will be produced” (ibid. p. 545). 
10 “Now the ordinarily-received, and almost universally-acknowledged, principles with reference to 
“quantities of caloric” and “latent heat,” lead us to conceive that, at the end of a cycle of operations, 
when a body is left in precisely its primitive physical condition, if it has absorbed any heat during one 
part of the operations, it must have given out again exactly the same amount during the remainder 
of the cycle. The truth of this principle is considered as axiomatic by CARNOT” (ibid. p. 542) (See 
Carnot, 1824, p. 37). 
11 “all those assumptions depending on the idea that heat is a substance, invariable in quantity; not 
convertible into any other element, and incapable of being generated by any physical agency” (ibid. 
p. 543). 
12 “The extremely important discoveries recently made by Mr JOULE of Manchester, that heat is 
evolved in every part of a closed electric conductor, moving in the neighbourhood of a magnet, and 
that heat is generated by the friction of ﬂuids in motion, seem to overturn the opinion commonly 
held that heat cannot be generated, but only produced from a source, where it has previously existed 
either in a sensible or in a latent condition” (ibid. p. 543).

thus, its fundamental principle, the invariability of the quantity of heat.13 He gives 
an account of Joule’s claim, to abandon Carnot’s theory, but notes that this would 
give rise to numerous difﬁculties.14 He then concludes that more experimental 
research is needed.15 
In short, Joule maintained that he had proved the conversion of heat into work and 
work into heat. Thomson only accepts the latter. By virtue of this, rejecting Carnot’s 
theory would be a mistake because this is a complete theory of heat. 
Carnot theory and Joule experiments become compatible 
In 1850, Clausius makes Carnot’s theory and Joule’s experiments compatible. He 
agrees that there is no experimental proof of the conversion of heat into work. He 
argues, however, that the experiments of the 1840s had shown that one could produce 
heat through work. (With this Thomson agreed.) Now, if heat could be produced 
through work, then heat could not be a substance. By the alternative of the time— 
heat being a substance or motion—it remained that heat was motion. What kind of 
motion was heat then? This did not matter to Clausius. It was enough for him that 
heat could be thought of as motion. Admitting heat as motion does not result in the 
rejection of Carnot’s theory. Clausius develops then a theory of heat based on Carnot 
and Joule. 
The ﬁrst fundamental proposition of this theory tells us that the mechanical 
equivalent of heat is valid: 
“whenever work is expended, a certain amount of heat appears and vice versa, a certain 
amount of heat is capable of giving rise to a given amount of work”,16 which originates from 
Joule. 
The second states that “the production of work corresponds as an equivalent to 
the passage of heat from a hot body to a cold body”,17 which originates from Carnot.
13 “the fundamental axiom adopted by CARNOT may be considered as still the most probable basis 
for an investigation of the motive power of heat” (ibid. p. 544). 
14 This is also Carnot’s point of view: “les quantités de chaleur absorbées ou dégagées dans ses 
diverses transformations sont exactement compensées. Ce fait n’a jamais été révoqué en doute […] 
Le nier, ce serait renverser toute la théorie de la chaleur, à laquelle il sert de base.” (Carnot, 1824, 
p. 37). 
15 “It might appear, that the difﬁculty would be entirely avoided, by abandoning CARNOT’s funda-
mental axiom; a view which is strongly urged by Mr JOULE […] If we do so, however, we meet 
with innumerable other difﬁculties—insuperable without farther experimental investigation, and an 
entire reconstruction of the theory of heat, from its foundation. It is in reality to experiment that we 
must look—either for a veriﬁcation of CARNOT’s axiom, and an explanation of the difﬁculty we 
have been considering; or for an entirely new basis of the Theory of Heat” (ibid. p. 545). 
16 “daß in allen Fällen, wo durch Wärme Arbeit entstehe, eine der erzeugten Arbeit proportionale 
Wärmemenge verbraucht werde, und daß umgekehrt durch Verbrauch einer ebenso großen Arbeit 
dieselbe Wärmemenge erzeugt werden könne” (Clausius, 1850, p. 373). 
17 “Carnot hat, wie schon oben erwähnt wurde, angenommen, daß der Erzeugung von Arbeit als 
Aequivalent ein bloßer Uebergang von Wärme aus einem warmen in einen kalten Körper entspreche, 
ohne daß die Quantität der Wärme dabei verringert werde. Der letzte Theil dieser Annahme, nämlich 
daß die Quantität der Wärme unverringert bleibe, widerspricht unserem früheren Grundsatze, und

(These two propositions would become ‘the laws of thermodynamics’.) In the 
course of the study, Clausius shows how to approach thermodynamic phenomena 
based on these principles. 
He also shows the convergence of Joule and Carnot regarding the mechanical 
equivalent of heat. Clausius argues as follows. According to Joule’s experiments, 
the mechanical equivalent of heat is 460, 438 or 425 kg m. The conformity of 
these values to each other justiﬁes the ﬁrst fundamental proposition (the equiva-
lence between work and heat) (Clausius, 1850, pp. 523–4). According to Carnot’s 
theory, the equivalent of work to the unit of heat is 421 kg m. The convergence of this 
value with the mechanical equivalent of heat proves the truth of Carnot’s fundamental 
law in the form given by the second fundamental proposition.18 
3.2 
Thomson’s Mechanical Energy 
March 1851: some of Thomson’s views had changed. He embraces the dynamic 
theory of heat: heat is motion. The article, On the dynamical theory of heat; with 
numerical results deduced from Mr. Joule’s equivalent of a thermal unit […] begins 
with a historical reference: Humphrey Davy had been the founder of the dynamic 
theory of heat. This is justiﬁed by Davy’s experiment of melting two pieces of ice by 
friction and two passages of the same text: caloric does not exist, heat is motion.19 
This is followed by a reference to Mayer and Joule: 
“The recent discoveries made by MAYER and JOULE, of the generation of heat through 
the friction of ﬂuids in motion, and by the magneto-electric excitation of galvanic currents, 
would, either of them be sufﬁcient to demonstrate the immateriality of heat; and would so 
afford, if required, a perfect conﬁrmation of SIR HUMPHREY DAVY’s views” (Thomson, 
1851a, p. 261). 
Clausius’ article, as well as Rankine’s, are referred to by Thomson as recent 
contributions to the dynamic theory of heat: the authors would have reached consid-
erable conclusions, through reasoning analogous to Carnot’s, but based on a principle 
contrary to his fundamental axiom (ibid. p. 262).20 
muß daher, wenn wir diesen festhalten wollen, verworfen werden. Der erste Theil dagegen kann 
seinem Hauptinhalte nach fortbestehen” (ibid. p. 500).
18 “die Uebereinstimmung derselben mit der Zahl 421 bestätigt in gleicher Weise die Richtigkeit 
des Carnot’schen Grundsatzes, in der Form, welche er durch die Verbindung mit dem ersteren 
Grundsatze angenommen hat” (ibid. p. 524). 
19 “SIR HUMPHREY DAVY, by his experiment of melting two pieces of ice by rubbing them 
together, established […] he concludes that heat consists of a motion excited among the particles 
of bodies […] The Dynamical Theory of Heat, thus established by SIR HUMPHREY DAVY is 
extended […]” (1851a, p. 261). 
20 Rankine imagined the following: “each atom of matter consists of a nucleus or central point, 
enveloped by an elastic atmosphere, which is retained in its position by attractive forces, and that the 
elasticity due to heat arises from the centrifugal force of those atmospheres, revolving or oscillating 
about their nuclei or central points” (Rankine, 1850, p. 276). This paper was published in 1851. I

A New Concept
Next, Thomson lays out the fundamental principles of the heat theory. These are 
two propositions, the ﬁrst said to be Joule’s and the second, Carnot and Clausius’.21 
The ﬁrst one establishes the correspondence between heat and mechanical effect.22 
The second proposition tells us that the reversible machine is the one that produces the 
maximum possible work among all those working between the same temperatures.23 
Conclusion 
Thomson’s point of view had changed compared to his 1849 paper. Admittedly, 
Rankine’s and Clausius’ articles had been published but none of them satisfy 
Thomson’s requirement of 1849, the need for experimental evidence. This difﬁculty 
does not, however, cease to be present in 1851. In a footnote, he points out that the 
conversion of heat into work possessed only theoretical arguments; the experimental 
proof that doing work brings about a decrease in heat was lacking.24 
Thomson claims that the discoveries made by Mayer and Joule would afford 
a conﬁrmation of Davy’s views, who is presented as the founder of the dynamic 
theory of heat. It is true that heat is not matter for Mayer, just as it is not for Davy. 
However, the reasons are different. For Mayer, heat is a force and a force is not matter 
because matter is characterized by being ponderable and impenetrable and force by 
the opposite (Appendix D). Therefore, heat being a force, it could not be material. 
Davy’s point of view was different. At that time, heat was either a substance or motion. 
Now, heat could not be a substance, because it could be created by the friction of
will use this version as it is more complete. On the quantity of heat, he wrote: “According to this 
hypothesis, quantity of heat is the vis viva of the molecular revolutions or oscillations” (Rankine, 
1851, p. 510); and on the temperature: “the condition of equilibrium of heat is, that the square of the 
velocity of vortical motion, divided by the coefﬁcient of atmospheric elasticity, shall be the same for 
each atom. Of this quantity, therefore, and of constants common to all substances, temperature must 
be a function” (ibid. p. 521). The temperature function is also given explicitly (see ibid. p. 523). 
21 “The whole theory of the motive power of heat is founded on the two following propositions, 
due respectively to JOULE, and to CARNOT and CLAUSIUS” (Thomson, 1851a, p. 264). 
22 “Prop. I. (JOULE).—When equal quantities of mechanical effect are produced by any means 
whatever, from purely thermal sources, or lost in purely thermal effects, equal quantities of heat are 
put out of existence, or are generated” (Thomson, 1851a, p. 264). 
23 “Prop. II. (CARNOT and CLAUSIUS).—If an engine be such that, when it is worked backwards, 
the physical and mechanical agencies in every part of its motions are all reversed; it produces as much 
mechanical effect as can be produced by any thermo-dynamic engine, with the same temperatures 
of source and refrigerator, from a given quantity of heat” (ibid. p. 264). 
24 “in a letter which I received from Mr JOULE on the 8th of July 1847. “In PELTIER’S experiment 
on cold produced at the bismuth and antimony solder, we have an instance of the conversion of 
heat into the mechanical force of the current,” which must have been meant as an answer […] but 
it would require a proof that there is more heat put out of existence at the heated soldering than is 
created at the cold soldering, to make the “evidence” be experimental. That this is the case I think 
is certain, because the statements of § 16 […] but it is still to be remarked, that neither in this nor in 
any other case of the production of mechanical effect from purely thermal agency, has the ceasing 
to exist of an equivalent quantity of heat been demonstrated otherwise than theoretically. It would 
be a very great step in the experimental illustration (or veriﬁcation, for those who consider such 
to be necessary) of the dynamical theory of heat, to actually shew, in any one case, a loss of heat” 
(Thomson, 1851a, pp. 267–8). 

3.2 Thomson’s Mechanical Energy

blocks of ice. Therefore, it would have to be motion. Moreover, the statement ‘heat 
is motion’ is not valid for Mayer, because this would mean that we know the essence 
of heat, which, according to him, is unknown. Regarding to Joule, the situation is 
different. Like Davy, Joule also argued that heat was motion, because it could not be 
a substance; and it could not be a substance because its quantity varies. 
The idea that Davy is the founder of the dynamic theory of heat due to the ice piece 
friction experiment is not justiﬁed. Indeed, Rumford had argued in 1798, based on 
the friction of metals, that heat could not but be motion. Furthermore, Davy changed 
his views shortly after the publication of the 1799 paper.25 
A new concept emerged 
In December 1851, Thomson publishes another paper on the dynamic theory of heat. 
Here a concept of energy appears. More exactly, he deﬁnes “mechanical energy of 
a body in a given state”. Let us consider the steps that lead to the deﬁnition, which 
allows us to understand what this concept means. 
A body that emits heat or changes its volume against resisting forces does work 
on the outside.26 To the extent that a body performs a mechanical effect on the 
environment, it changes its own work reserve in the same proportion, says Thomson.27 
(With this statement, Thomson assumes conservation of magnitude.) If there is a 
body-work reserve, as Thomson says, it makes sense to ask what work a body has in 
reserve. The total work reserve of a body or, what is the same, the mechanical value 
of all the effects that a body can produce is called the total mechanical energy of the 
body.28 What is then the total value of those effects? This was not determinable: 
“in our present state of ignorance regarding perfect cold, and the nature of molecular forces, 
we cannot determine this “total mechanical energy” for any portion of matter” (Thomson, 
1851b, p. 475). 
As the problem is due to the lack of knowledge about the state of absolute zero, 
Thomson deﬁnes mechanical energy by reference to a standard state. The mechanical 
energy of a body in a given state is then understood to be the mechanical value of the 
effects which the body would produce if it passed from that state to another state, 
taken for standard state or, inversely, the mechanical value required to bring the body
25 “Less than 2 years after, namely in December, 1800, referring to these productions, he [Davy] 
designates them, “my infant chemical speculations”; and, considering them chieﬂy in the light of 
mere speculations […]” (Davy, 1839–1840, II, p. 3). 
26 “A body which is either emitting heat, or altering its dimensions against resisting forces, is doing 
work upon matter external to it. The mechanical effect of this work, in one case, is the excitation 
of thermal motions, and in the other, the overcoming of resistances” (Thomson, 1851b, p. 475). 
27 “The body must itself be altering in its circumstances, so as to contain a less store of work within 
it, by an amount precisely equal to the aggregate value of the mechanical effects produced” (ibid. 
p. 475). 
28 “The total mechanical energy of a body might be deﬁned as the mechanical value of all the effect 
it would produce, in heat emitted and in resistances overcome, if it were cooled to the utmost, and 
allowed to contract indeﬁnitely or to expand indeﬁnitely according as the forces between its particles 
are attractive or repulsive, when the thermal motions within it are all stopped” (ibid. p. 475).

A New Concept
from the standard state to the state in question.29 (Thomson admits that the passages 
in one direction and the other are equivalent.) 
In order to obtain a mathematical expression, Thomson refers the reader to the 
March communication. He said then, suppose a mass under a given pressure p, whose 
volume v expands to v + dv and the temperature changes from t to t + dt, the amount 
of work done will be 
p  d v
and the amount of heat that must be given off will be given by 
uppe r M d v plus upper N d t period
Using the mechanical equivalent of the thermal unit, symbolized by J, Thomson 
expresses heat in mechanical units and determines the total external effect as30 
min us up pe r J lef t  parenthesis upper M d v plus upper N d t right parenthesis plus p d v period
Now, if this expression is the measure of the total external effect produced by the 
body and the body’s reserve of work varies with this effect in the same proportion, 
it follows that the variation of the body’s work is the inverse of the effect produced 
by the body. Therefore, the change in mechanical energy of a body, symbolized by 
‘de’, is,31 
d e  e quals up er J le ft

29 “the “mechanical energy of a body in a given state,” will denote the mechanical value of the 
effects the body would produce in passing from the state in which it is given, to the standard state, 
or the mechanical value of the whole agency that would be required to bring the body from the 
standard state to the state in which it is given” (ibid. p. 475). 
30 “Let us suppose a mass of any substance, occupying a volume v, under a pressure p uniform in 
all directions, and at a temperature t, to expand in volume to v + dv, and to rise in temperature to 
t + dt. The quantity of work which it will produce will be p dv; and the quantity of heat which 
must be added to it to make its temperature rise during the expansion to t + dt may be denoted 
by M dv + N dt. The mechanical equivalent of this is J (M dv + N dt), if J denote the mechanical 
equivalent of a unit of heat. Hence the mechanical measure of the total external effect produced in 
the circumstances is (p − J M)  dv − J N  dt” (Thomson, 1851a, p. 269). 
31 “The volume and temperature being denoted respectively by v and t, let  e be the mechanical 
energy, p the pressure […] M dv + N dt may express the quantity of heat that must be added to the 
ﬂuid mass, to elevate its temperature by dt, when its volume is augmented by dv. The mechanical 
value of the heat added to the ﬂuid in any operation, or the quantity of heat added multiplied by J 
(the mechanical equivalent of the thermal unit), must be diminished by the work done by the ﬂuid 
in expanding against resistance, to ﬁnd the actual increase of mechanical energy which the body 
acquires. Hence […] we have de = […]” (Thomson, 1851b, p. 476). 

3.2 Thomson’s Mechanical Energy
75
Conclusion 
Thomson introduces the concept of mechanical energy. This energy is attached to 
a body: it is its amount of work in reserve. This reserve is potential in the classical 
sense. It is something that the body can do, but not that it necessarily does. If it does, 
its reserve changes and changes in the same proportion as the work done outside the 
body. This means that the quantity of work in the system ‘body and its neighborhood’ 
is conserved during a change. Thus, the idea of conservation is presupposed in this 
deﬁnition. 
The deﬁnition of mechanical energy also depends on the mechanical equivalent 
of heat. Without this value it would not have been possible to express heat in terms of 
work. The quantitative expression of the variation of the mechanical energy would 
not have been written as it was (previous equation). 
3.2.1 
Thomson’s Stores of Mechanical Energy 
In 1852, Thomson publishes a paper on mechanical energy, where he defends the 
thesis that there is a universal tendency to its dissipation. The argument is based 
on Carnot’s machine, thermodynamics phenomena and Creative Power. According 
to Carnot’s proposition (within the framework of the dynamic heat theory), there 
is a loss of mechanical energy if the transformation is not performed by a perfect 
machine.32 As a matter of fact, perfect machines do not exist. Therefore, that loss 
will always take place. Now, Thomson adds that only Creative Power can create 
or annihilate mechanical energy. Thus, it follows then that the loss of mechanical 
energy available for man is not really a loss. It consists of a transformation, but this 
is dissipative.33 
To explain the nature of this transformation, Thomson divides the reserves of 
mechanical energy into static and dynamic.34 Examples of the ﬁrst kind are: a quantity 
of weights at a certain height, an electrically charged body, a quantity of fuel; and 
of the second kind, masses in motion, a volume passed through by waves of light 
or radiant heat, thermal motion of particles in a body (not inﬁnitely cold).35 With
32 “The object of the present communication is to call attention to the remarkable consequences 
which follow from Carnot’s proposition, established as it is on a new foundation, in the dynamical 
theory of heat; that there is an absolute waste of mechanical energy available to man” (Thomson, 
1852a, p. 139). 
33 “As it is most certain that Creative Power alone can either call into existence or annihilate 
mechanical energy, the “waste” referred to cannot be annihilation, but must be some transformation 
of energy” (ibid. p. 139). 
34 “To explain the nature of this transformation, it is convenient, in the ﬁrst place, to divide stores 
of mechanical energy into two classes—statical and dynamical” (ibid. p. 139). 
35 “A quantity of weights at a height, ready to descend and do work when wanted, an electriﬁed 
body, a quantity of fuel, contain stores of mechanical energy of the statical kind. Masses of matter 
in motion, a volume of space through which undulations of light or radiant heat are passing, a body

A New Concept
this distinction, a transformation would be non-dissipative, if the mechanical energy 
could be restored to its initial condition. 
In transformations between work and heat a restoration only takes place with the 
perfect machine.36 Thomson exposes the consequences of this. If heat, for example, is 
caused by friction, restoration is not possible.37 In the diffusion of heat by conduction 
or in the absorption of radiant heat or light, restoration is equally impossible.38 
Moreover, Thomson also admits that restoration is probably impossible even for 
organized matter.39 The consequence of this would be that our life on Earth would 
be limited in time.40 [This idea had a great repercussion on the society of the second 
half of the nineteenth century (Neswald, 2006; Kragh, 2008).] 
Conclusion 
The thesis of universal dissipation of mechanical energy starts from three main 
elements: Creative Power, the Carnot machine and thermodynamic phenomena. 
Since the perfect thermodynamic machine does not exist, the processes are irre-
versible. This means that the value of the mechanical effect at the beginning and end 
of a process is different. In accordance with the deﬁnition of mechanical energy, it 
has to be said, that the mechanical energy available to man decreases. It is assumed 
that only Creative Power can annihilate or create mechanical energy. Then, there 
can be no diminution of energy. Thomson reconciles the two aspects through the 
dissipative transformation. 
In this article, Thomson provides a justiﬁcation for the conservation of energy, 
which he has presupposed in the previous paper: creation or annihilation of energy 
can only be accomplished by Creative Power, assuming, which Thomson has to, 
that Creative Power is not changing the amount of mechanical energy on its own. 
Thomson does not tell us, however, how he arrived at this idea. It is true that the idea 
is not new, since Joule had argued in 1843 that “the grand agents of nature are, by
having thermal motions among its particles (that is, not inﬁnitely cold), contain stores of mechanical 
energy of the dynamical kind” (ibid. p. 139).
36 “When heat is created by a reversible process, (so that the mechanical energy thus spent may 
be restored to its primitive condition) there is also a transference […] of a quantity of heat” (ibid. 
pp. 139–140). 
37 “When heat is created by any unreversible process (such as friction,) there is a dissipation of 
mechanical energy […]” (ibid. p. 140). 
38 “When heat is diffused by conduction, there  is  a  dissipation of mechanical energy, and perfect 
restoration is impossible. 
IV. When radiant heat or light is absorbed, otherwise than in vegetation, or in chemical action, 
there is a dissipation of mechanical energy, and perfect restoration is impossible” (ibid. p. 140). 
39 “Any restoration of mechanical energy, without more than an equivalent of dissipation, is impos-
sible in inanimate material processes, and is probably never effected by means of organised matter, 
either endowed with vegetable life, or subjected to the will of an animated creature” (ibid. pp. 141–2). 
40 “Within a ﬁnite period of time past the earth must have been, and within a ﬁnite period of time 
to come the earth must again be, unﬁt for the habitation of man as at present constituted” (ibid. 
p. 142).

the Creator’s ﬁat, indestructible” (Joule, 1843, p. 442) and again in 1845 and 1847.41 
Nevertheless, he also did not say where he knew this from. Therefore, Thomson’s 
thesis on the conservation of mechanical energy has no scientiﬁc argument. 
3.2.2 
Concerning the Concept of Energy 
The distinction between static and dynamic reserves of mechanical energy introduced 
in this paper matters because it will lead to the distinction between potential and 
kinetic energy. Thomson’s distinction is based on observation, when he tells us that 
a grave at a certain height from the ground has mechanical energy of the static kind, 
and if the body is in motion, it has dynamic mechanical energy. When he however 
states that a not absolutely cold body contains a reserve of mechanical energy of 
dynamic type, the characterization has another foundation, heat being conceived as 
motion. It is this concept that has, as a consequence, that a body that is not absolutely 
cold has thermal motions between its particles. These movements are not observable. 
In sum, the division of mechanical energy into a static and dynamic type is based on 
observation and conjecture.42 
3.3 
Rankine’s Actual and Potential Energy 
In 1853, Rankine publishes the article On the general law of the transformation of 
energy. The term energy comes naturally from Thomson. From him also comes the 
distinction between mechanical energy of a static and dynamic type, which, however, 
Rankine will signiﬁcantly alter. After presenting these concepts, Rankine draws the 
reader’s attention to the point that the principles and reasoning of the article may 
seem “abstract and metaphysical”.43 
41 Criticizing Clapeyron about the “loss of vis viva”, Joule wrote: “Believing that the power to 
destroy [vis viva] belongs to the Creator alone, I entirely coincide with Roget and Faraday in the 
opinion, that any theory which, when carried out, demands the annihilation of force, is necessarily 
erroneous” (Joule, 1845b, p. 189). 
In 1847, he wrote: “absolute destruction of living force cannot possibly take place, because it is 
manifestly absurd to suppose that the powers with which God has endowed matter can be destroyed 
any more than that they can be created by man’s agency” (Joule, 1847, p. 269). 
42 In another article from the same year, in which Thomson used the distinction of mechanical 
effects into static and dynamic, it also appears that observation and conjecture are the basis of the 
characterization. “The elevation of temperature produced in a body by the incidence of radiant heat 
upon it is a mechanical effect of the dynamical kind, since the communication of heat to a body 
is merely the excitation or the augmentation of certain motions among its particles” (Thomson, 
1852b, p. 109). 
43 “Abstract and metaphysical as the principles and reasoning of this paper may appear, they are of 
immediate practical utility” (Rankine, 1853, p. 110).

A New Concept
By energy is meant any affection of substance which constitutes a power capable 
of overcoming resistance or is measurable as such (Substance means a body or a 
set of bodies, as we will see later). The term energy now includes not only motion, 
mechanical power, chemical action, heat, light, electricity, magnetism, but also all 
known or unknown powers which are convertible into them or measurable by them.44 
Thomson’s concept ‘mechanical energy’ is no longer used by Rankine but only 
‘energy’. The distinction of mechanical energy into ‘static and dynamic’ is replaced 
by the distinction of energy into ‘potential and actual’.45 By actual energy is meant 
the affection of the substance, which is measurable, transferable or transformable 
and whose presence induces a change of state of the substance.46 Potential energy 
is deﬁned by the elements of measurement, namely, the force or effort giving rise 
to a change and the quantity changed.47 Thus, for example, if a certain pressure is 
exerted on a certain volume of gas, the pressure is seen as the effort tending to make 
a change and the volume which tends to be changed. Thus, if the volume of the gas 
is changed by a small value dV, then the potential energy is given by the product 
P.dV, where P represents the pressure.48 
If a change occurs, the actual energy disappears, being replaced by potential energy 
and, conversely, if the latter disappears, actual energy reappears in the same propor-
tion.49 This is the Rankine content of the conservation of energy: if one disappears, 
the other reappears in the same proportion. He admitted the conservation as known. 
It is now presented as the constancy of the sum of the Universe’s energies, actual
44 “In this investigation the term energy is used to comprehend every affection of substances which 
constitutes or is commensurable with a power of producing change in opposition to resistance, and 
includes ordinary motion and mechanical power, chemical action, heat, light, electricity, magnetism, 
and all other powers, known or unknown, which are convertible or commensurable with these” (ibid. 
p. 106). 
45 “All conceivable forms of energy may be distinguished into two kinds; actual or sensible, and 
potential or latent” (ibid. p. 106). 
46 “Actual energy is a measurable, transferable, and transformable affection of a substance, the 
presence of which causes the substance to tend to change its state in one or more respects” (ibid. 
p. 106). “by the occurrence of which changes, actual energy disappears, and is replaced by Potential 
energy” (ibid. p. 106). 
47 “Potential energy, which is measured by the amount of a change in the condition of a substance, 
and that of the tendency or force whereby that change is produced (or, what is the same thing, of 
the resistance overcome in producing it), taken jointly” (ibid. p. 106). 
48 “Let V denote one measurable state, condition, or mode of existence of the substance under 
consideration, whose magnitude increases when the kind of potential energy in question is 
developed. 
Let U denote this potential energy. 
Let P be the tendency or force whereby the state V tends to increase, which is opposed by an 
equal resistance. 
Then when the state V undergoes a small increase dV, the potential energy developed or given 
out is dU = PdV” (ibid. p. 106). 
49 “If the change whereby potential energy has been developed be exactly reversed, then as the 
potential energy disappears, the actual energy which had previously disappeared is reproduced” 
(ibid. p. 106).

and potential.50 The novelty of the paper is then the law of energy transformation, 
which concerns the actual and potential energy51 : 
“we obtain, for the total energy, actual and potential, acquired by the substance, in conse-
quence of the changes of total actual energy from Q to Q + dQ, and of state, from V to V 
+ dV, the formula 
d ps i  equ a ls sigma summation d upper Q minus sigma summation d upper U
This equation is the complete expression of the law of the transformation of energy, from 
any one actual form Q to any one potential form U, developed by increase of the state V” 
(Rankine, 1853, p. 108–9). 
In a second step, Rankine includes various forms of actual and potential energy. 
He writes then: 
“This equation is the complete expression of the law of the mutual transformation of actual 
and potential energy of all possible kinds” (ibid. p. 109). 
Here we have two forms of energy—actual and potential—and many kinds of 
energy—heat, electricity, electromagnetism, etc. All these kinds of energy consist of 
those two forms. 
Conclusion 
In 1853, Rankine takes conservation of energy for granted. His novelty concerns the 
transformation of energy. This transformation occurs between two forms of energy 
which have a quantitative reciprocal relationship: if one increases, the other decreases. 
For this reason, they also justify the conservation of energy. 
The designations of the energies can be related to the Aristotelian theory of act and 
potency. According to this, ‘actual’ refers to what is acting, happening and potential, 
to what may happen. Rankine’s use of the terms actual and potential conforms to 
this sense. 
3.3.1 
Thomson Adopts Rankine’s Concept 
In the next year, Thomson adopts Rankine’s concepts. A body has mechanical energy, 
says Thomson, when it is in motion or able to go into motion without external assis-
tance.52 The former can be called dynamic or actual energy and the latter potential
50 “The law of the conservation of energy is already known, viz. that the sum of the actual and 
potential energies in the universe is unchangeable” (ibid. p. 106). 
51 “The object of the present investigation is to ﬁnd the law of the transformation of energy, according 
to which all transformations of energy between the actual and potential states take place” (ibid. 
p. 106). 
52 “Any piece of matter, or any group of bodies, however connected, which either is in motion, or 
can get into motion without external assistance, has what is called mechanical energy” (Thomson, 
1854, p. 34).

A New Concept
energy.53 The term ‘potential’ has been completely adopted by Thomson. The term 
‘actual’ has dynamic as a variant. (It is the latter term that will lead to ‘kinetic’, 
giving rise to what we still use, potential and kinetic energy.) Let’s move on to the 
interpretation of phenomena. 
“A stone at a height […] has potential energy. If the stone be let fall, its potential energy is 
converted into actual energy during its descent, exists entirely as the actual energy of its own 
motion at the instant before it strikes, and is transformed into heat at the moment of coming 
to rest on the ground” (Thomson, 1854, p. 34). 
In the 1852 paper, a stone at a certain height had mechanical energy of a static 
kind; when dropped it was left with a reserve of mechanical energy of a dynamic 
kind. The change from static to dynamic energy occurred with the beginning of the 
movement, because once in motion, there is no longer static energy. In 1854, this 
changed. If dropped, the potential energy of the stone converts to actual energy during 
the descent. This differs from the previous characterization since energy of static kind 
did not convert into dynamic during the descent. It ended when the stone went into 
motion. Hence, if Thomson had maintained energy of a static kind, he would not 
have been able to speak of conversion. ‘Static’ has no gradation. The stone is either 
at rest or not. Dynamic, on the contrary, can be used during the motion. 
The mechanical equivalent of heat (Joule, 1850) is interpreted through the new 
terminology: the actual or dynamic energy of heat capable of raising the temperature 
of a pound of water by 1°F is an exact equivalent of the potential energy of a pound 
of matter at a height of 772 feet.54 
Based on Joule’s experiments, Thomson says, set off his “speculations.”55 Here 
are two examples of speculations mentioned in the paper: war and the principle of 
the Universe. The potential energy of war would be contained in the reserves of 
gunpowder, which artillery and infantry use, and in supplies for men and horses. The 
artillerymen, pedestrians and other participants are seen as means or tools, through 
which the potential energy is used for the intended purposes.56 As in 1852, Thomson
53 “The energy of motion may be called either “dynamical energy” or “actual energy”. The energy 
of a material system at rest, in virtue of which it can get into motion, is called “potential energy.”” 
(ibid. p. 34). 
54 “Mr Joule, by a series of well planned and executed experiments, ascertained that a pound of 
water would have its temperature increased by 1° (Fahrenheit) if it kept all the heat that would be 
generated by its descent through 772 feet; that is, the “actual” or “dynamical” energy of as much 
heat as raises the temperature of a pound of water 1° is an exact equivalent for the potential energy 
of a pound of matter 772 feet above the ground” (ibid. p. 35). 
55 “These researches, with the theory of animal heat and motion […] due to the same penetrating 
investigator [Joule], have afforded to the author of the present communication the chief groundwork 
for his speculations” (ibid. p. 35). 
56 “The potential energy of war is contained in the stores of gunpowder and food brought into the 
ﬁeld. The gunpowder carried by artillery and infantry contains all the potential energy ordinarily 
brought into action by those two arms of the service. The men’s food, and the forage for the horses, 
contain the stores of potential energy drawn upon in a charge of cavalry. Artillerymen, foot soldiers, 
sailors, steamers with their engines, guns swords, are only means and appliances by which the 
potential energy contained in the stores of gunpowder and food is directed to strike the blows by 
which the desired effects are produced” (ibid. p. 35). 

3.3 Rankine’s Actual and Potential Energy

believes that there will be an end to life in the world.57 He now puts forward a 
hypothesis of the beginning of the universe: in the beginning, there would have been 
only the potential energy of gravitation, which would therefore be the antecedent of 
motion, heat and light of the Universe.58 
Conclusion 
Thomson adopted the term potential energy, which replaces his static mechanical 
energy and opens up the possibility of a transformation of energy between potential 
and actual forms. He also adopted the term actual, but alongside the term dynamic. 
Thomson interpreted Joule’s paddle wheel experiment by means of the new 
terminology. He wrote: 
“the “actual” or “dynamical” energy of as much heat as raises the temperature of a pound of 
water 1° is an exact equivalent for the potential energy of a pound of matter 772 feet above 
the ground” (ibid. p. 35). 
Let’s go back to Joule’s result to analyze how it ﬁts into the new terminology. 
Joule wrote: 
“the quantity of heat capable of increasing the temperature of a pound of water (weighed in 
vacuo, and taken at between 55° and 60°) by 1°F requires for its evolution the expenditure of 
a mechanical force represented by the fall of 772 lb. through the space of one foot” (Joule, 
1850, p. 82). 
This was the result he obtained with his machine. If this is in motion, we can 
observe two falling bodies and the movement of the paddles that agitate the water. 
The falling bodies have a certain speed, which Joule determined.59 Therefore, we 
can write down the actual/dynamic energy of these bodies. Therefore, we have the 
actual/dynamic energy of these bodies and that which corresponds to the heat that 
raises a pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. If we accept these two actual/ 
dynamic energies, then the potential energy of a pound of matter 772 feet above the 
ground is not an exact equivalent of the actual or dynamic energy that corresponds 
to the heat of 1°F, as Thomson said. 
3.3.2 
Concerning the Concept of Energy 
The interpretation of phenomena in terms of actual and potential energy in the 
non-speculative part of the article—the stone, the ﬂow of water, Joule’s experi-
ment—shows that the terms transformation and conversion are used synonymously. 
This undifferentiated use of the terms eliminates the distinction between the term
57 “we ﬁnd that the end of this world as a habitation for man, or for any living creature or plant at 
present existing in it, is mechanically inevitable” (ibid. p. 37). 
58 “the potential energy of gravitation may be in reality the ultimate created antecedent of all the 
motion, heat, and light at present in the universe” (ibid. p. 40). 
59 “Velocity of the weights in descending, 2.42 inches per second.” (Joule 1850, p. 65).

connected to forms of energy, which comes from Mayer, and that connected to heat 
as motion, which comes from Joule. This favors the path to eclecticism, as we shall 
see. 
3.4 
The Science of Energetics 
In 1855, Rankine lays the foundations of an energy-based science. The article, 
Outlines of the science of energetics, consists of two parts: the ﬁrst is about theo-
rizing in physics (what kinds of theories exist), and the second part is dedicated to 
science of energetics. I will begin with the latter. This science is presented through 
basic concepts and axioms. These concepts, however, differ from what was used in 
the domain. Some known propositions about energy appear in a new form as they 
are expressed through the new terminology. The intellectual effort that is required of 
anyone joining the energetics is justiﬁed by the philosophy of science presented in 
the ﬁrst part of the article. 
The object of energetics is material bodies and physical phenomena in general.60 
The basic concepts used are of Aristotelian origin: substance and accidents. Work, 
energy and energy forms are then deﬁned by means of these concepts. 
‘Substance’ is the term used to refer to a body, a part of a body or a set of bodies.61 
‘Accident’ refers to any variable state of a substance.62 Accidents can be: 
– absolute or relative, 
– homogeneous or heterogeneous, 
– active or passive. 
An accident is said to be absolute or relative, according to whether the variable 
state of the substance depends on the condition of each part or on a relationship 
between parts of a substance.63 They are homogeneous or heterogeneous, depending 
on whether or not they can be reduced to a unit or quantity.64 Accidents can be 
active or passive according to whether they tend to vary an accident or are the varied 
accident. We turn next to the use of these terms. 
Work is understood as the variation of a passive accident through an active one. 
Thus, for example, if the work consists of force times displacement, force is the active
60 “a science whose subjects are, material bodies and physical phenomena in general, and which it 
is proposed to call the SCIENCE OF ENERGETICS” (Rankine, 1855, p. 214). 
61 “The term “substance” will be applied to all bodies, parts of bodies, and systems of bodies” (ibid. 
p. 214). 
62 “The term “accident” will be applied to every variable state of substances” (ibid. p. 214). 
63 “consisting in a condition of each part of a substance, how small soever, (which may be called 
an absolute accident), or in a physical relation between parts of substances, (which may be called 
a relative accident)” (ibid. pp. 214–215). 
64 “Accidents may be said to be homogeneous when the quantities expressing them are capable of 
being put together, so that the result of the combination of the different accidents shall be expressed 
by one quantity” (ibid. p. 215). 

3.4 The Science of Energetics

accident and displacement is the passive. If work is given by pressure times volume, 
pressure is the active and volume the passive accident. In general, the magnitude 
work is given by the integral 
up pe
r 
W
 eq
ual
s integral Underscript x 0 Overscript x 1 Endscripts upper X d x
where x denotes the passive accident; 
X is the active accident or effort, which causes the passive accident to vary; 
W stands for the work done in increasing x, from  x0 to x1 (Rankine, 1855, pp. 216–7). 
The terms substance and work are used to deﬁne energy. Energy means the state 
of a substance capable of performing work.65 If the capacity to do work depends 
on the substance itself (it is an absolute accident), it is called actual energy; if this  
capacity of the substance to do work depends on other substances (it is a relative 
accident) it is called potential energy.66 Once the terminology has been presented, 
Rankine moves on to the axioms. 
Axioms 
The science of energetics is based on three axioms. The ﬁrst states: 
“All kinds of Work and Energy are Homogeneous.” (ibid. p. 218). 
Given the deﬁnition of homogeneous accidents—these can be reduced to a unit 
or quantity—the axiom tells us that work and energy are expressed by the same 
magnitude. The consequence Rankine draws is that “any kind of energy may be 
made the means of performing any kind of work” (ibid. p. 218). 
The second axiom states: 
“The Total Energy of a Substance cannot be altered by the Mutual Actions of its Parts” (ibid. 
p. 219). 
If the energy of a substance cannot be altered by its parts, then, without external 
action, its energy is conserved. Rankine concludes from the axiom that “all work 
consists in the transfer and transformation of energy alone” (ibid. p. 219). 
The third axiom states: 
“The Effort to Perform Work of a Given Kind, caused by a Given Quantity of Actual Energy, 
is the Sum of the Efforts caused by the Parts of that Quantity.” (ibid. p. 220).
65 “The term “energy” comprehends every state of a substance which constitutes a capacity for 
performing work” (ibid. p. 217). 
66 “’Actual energy’ comprehends those kinds of capacity for performing work which consist in 
particular states of each part of a substance […] that is, in an absolute accident, such as heat, 
light, electric current, vis viva. […]  “Potential energy” comprehends those kinds of capacity for 
performing work which consist in relations between substances, or parts of substances; that is, in 
relative accidents” (ibid. p. 217). 

84

A New Concept
One part of the axiom tells us that the effort to do work is the sum of the efforts. 
The other part concerns the origin of these efforts. Let us consider an example. One 
kind of work is pressure times the volume on which the pressure acts. Pressure is 
therefore an effort. Applying the axiom, we have that pressure is caused by a given 
quantity of actual energy. Thus, we have that actual energy is at the origin of the 
pressure that creates potential energy. It follows that actual energy gives potential. In 
this way, the axiom appears related with the law of transformation of energy. Indeed, 
according to Rankine, the axiom is equivalent to this law (1853).67 
In the last section of the article, it is noted to the reader that the results of the 
sections do not come from speculation, but from the generalization of a method of 
reasoning that would have already been successful in some particular domains of 
physics.68 This is explained in Rankine’s philosophy of physics, outlined in the ﬁrst 
part of the article, as follows. 
According to Rankine, the advance of scientiﬁc knowledge takes place in two 
phases: 
– observation of phenomena and their relationships; 
– establishment of the principles from which laws can be deduced for a class of 
phenomena.69 
A set of principles with their systematically deduced consequences is called a 
physical theory.70 In the construction of a theory, Rankine continues, two methods can 
be distinguished, the abstractive and the hypothetical.71 The abstractive is character-
ized by describing phenomena and assigning names or symbols based on perception. 
(This is the method adopted for the science of energetics.) Following the hypothetical 
method, the class of phenomena that is the object of the theory is deﬁned according to
67 “A law equivalent to this axiom, under the name of the “GENERAL LAW OF THE TRANS-
FORMATION OF ENERGY,”” (ibid. pp. 220–1). 
68 “It is to be observed, that the preceding articles are not the results of a new and hitherto untried 
speculation, but are the generalised expression of a method of reasoning which has already been 
applied with success to special branches of physics” (ibid. p. 227). 
69 “An essential distinction exists between two stages in the process of advancing our knowledge 
of the laws of physical phenomena; the ﬁrst stage consists in observing the relations of phenomena 
[…] The second stage consists in reducing the formal laws of an entire class of phenomena to the 
form of a science” (ibid. p. 209). 
70 “in discovering the most simple system of principles, from which all the formal laws of the class 
of phenomena can be deduced as consequences. 
Such a system of principles, with its consequences methodically deduced, constitutes the 
PHYSICAL THEORY of a class of phenomena” (ibid. p. 209). 
71 “Two methods of framing a physical theory may be distinguished […]. They may be termed, 
respectively, the ABSTRACTIVE and the HYPOTHETICAL methods” (ibid. p. 210). 

3.4 The Science of Energetics
85
a conjecture about its nature.72 This conjecture, in turn, may be objective or subjec-
tive, according to whether it is something that may exist but is imperceptible to us, 
or is simply a means of expressing phenomena. Mechanics is given as an illustration 
of a physical theory of abstractive method.73 
Indeed, mechanics is not only the example of a theory of abstractive method, 
but also the only complete physical theory, according to Rankine. Herein lies the 
reason for the adoption of mechanical hypotheses in other physical theories.74 These 
hypothetical theories proved useful in some areas, because they allowed complex 
phenomena to be reduced to simple laws of mechanics. Nevertheless, they also had 
drawbacks, namely, Rankine continues, by diverting attention away from phenomena 
not consistent with the hypotheses adopted.75 This criticism is illustrated by the 
little attention given to frictional heat in the heat-substance theory, the phenomenon 
was not in line with the hypothesis.76 All this justiﬁes the author’s choice in the 
construction of science of energetics.77 Instead of imagining movements and forces 
that are hidden from us, he considers properties in various sets of phenomena in order 
to arrive at general principles.78 
Conclusion 
Rankine tells us that he did not adopt the hypothetical method in his construction of 
the science of energetics. This means that he does not imagine movements and forces 
that are hidden from us. It follows that we are not allowed to interpret actual and 
potential energy as being hidden particle motions and forces. It turns out that actual 
and potential energy comes from mechanical energy of dynamic and static kinds,
72 “According to the ABSTRACTIVE method, a class of objects or phenomena is deﬁned by 
describing […] and assigning a name or symbol to, that assemblage of properties which is common 
to all the objects or phenomena composing the class, as perceived by senses, without introducing 
anything hypothetical. According to the HYPOTHETICAL method, a class of objects or phenomena 
is deﬁned, according to a conjectural conception of their nature” (ibid. p. 210). 
73 “The principles of the science of mechanics, the only example yet existing of a complete physical 
theory, are altogether formed from the data of experience by the abstractive method” (ibid. p. 210). 
74 “The fact that the theory of motions and motive forces is the only complete physical theory, has 
naturally led to the adoption of mechanical hypotheses in the theories of other branches of physics” 
(ibid. p. 211). 
75 “It is well known that certain hypothetical theories […] have proved extremely useful […] The 
neglect of the caution already referred to […] and a tendency has, consequently, often evinced itself 
to explain away, or set aside, facts inconsistent with these hypotheses” (ibid. p. 212). 
76 “Thus, the fact of the production of heat by friction, the basis of the true theory of heat, was long 
neglected, because inconsistent with the hypothesis of caloric” (ibid. p. 212). 
77 “Besides the perfecting of mechanical hypotheses, another and an entirely distinct method 
presents itself for combining the physical sciences into one system; and that is, by an extension of 
the ABSTRACTIVE PROCESS in framing theories” (ibid. p. 213). 
78 “Instead of supposing the various classes of physical phenomena to be constituted, in an occult 
way, of modiﬁcations of motion and force, let us distinguish the properties which those classes 
possess in common with each other […] So shall we arrive at a body of principles, applicable to 
physical phenomena in general” (ibid. p. 213).

A New Concept
which are mechanical concepts. Here the question of whether actual and potential 
energy are to be interpreted as conjecture or not arises. 
In 1855, potential and actual energy are based on the concept of accident. Accident 
is just a variable state of a substance. So actual and potential energy are variable states 
of a substance. The further question of whether there are hidden particle motions and 
forces, does not arise because it is outside of what is deﬁned by accident. Moreover, 
it would be a mechanical conjecture, which is characteristic of the hypothetical 
method and contrary to the abstractive method that Rankine claims to have followed. 
Furthermore, this interpretation is also in accordance with the characterization of the 
terminology of energy science: it is purely abstract.79 Thus, the conjectural character 
of actual and potential energy does not hold for Rankine. 
Helmholtz and Rankine 
Helmholtz defended the conservation of ultimate forces, the tension force and the 
living force. The decrease in one implies the increase of the other in the same propor-
tion. In some cases, as in free fall, the bodies are observable. In others, as in heat, 
Helmholtz conjectured that corpuscles behaved in the same way. 
Rankine generalizes actual and potential energy to all domains. He is not 
concerned with the conservation of energy, which he simply admits as known. Rather, 
he presents the general law of energy transformation, which includes only those two 
forms, whatever the domain. 
There is, therefore, a parallelism between the pairs ‘live force and tension force’ 
and ‘actual and potential energy’. If one of the terms of the pair increases, the other 
decreases so that either pair conforms to conservation. There is, however, also a 
difference. Helmholtz admits that the ultimate forces exist. According to Rankine’s 
philosophy, Helmholtz followed the hypothetical method in the construction of his 
theory. On the contrary, Rankine followed the abstractive. Actual and potential energy 
refers only variable states of a substance but not a mechanical conjecture. 
3.5 
Concerning Kinetic and Potential Energy 
The adjective kinetic in ‘kinetic energy’ was introduced by Thomson and Tait in 
an article, entitled Energy, published in a magazine aimed at the general public, 
Good Words, 1862. The authors explain that they prefer ‘kinetic’ energy to ‘actual’, 
because ‘kinetic’ indicates the form in which energy reveals itself, which is motion.80 
Moreover, its magnitude is calculated as a function of the mass and velocity of the
79 “The peculiar terms which will be used in treating of the Science of Energetics are purely abstract”. 
(ibid. p. 214). 
80 “[…] It had KINETIC or (as it has sometimes been called) actual energy. We prefer the ﬁrst term, 
which indicates motion as the form in which the energy is displayed” (Thomson and Tait, 1862, 
p. 602). 

3.5 Concerning Kinetic and Potential Energy
87
body.81 More exactly, it is given by half of the product of the mass and square of the 
velocity of the body.82 
In 1883, Thomson explained to us the reason for introducing the adjective 
‘kinetics’. He had intended to reformulate the terminology of Mechanics: to use 
the term ‘mechanics’ for the science of machines and ‘dynamics’ for the science of 
forces. The usual division of mechanics into statics and dynamics would necessarily 
have to be changed. The term dynamics was then replaced by kinetic. This had the 
consequence that the expression ‘actual or dynamic’ became ‘actual or kinetic’.83 
Thomson and Tait reduced then to ‘kinetics’ for the reason explained earlier. Another 
consequence of the reform concerns the concept ‘mechanical equivalent of heat’, 
which was called ‘dynamic equivalent of heat’. This change was not adopted by 
the scientiﬁc community. The expression ‘mechanical energy’ was not changed to 
‘dynamic energy’. It simply disappeared, Thomson and Tait speak only of ‘energy’. 
Once we get to the expression we use today, let us brieﬂy look at the conceptual 
development of these two forms of energy. Thomson created the concept of mechan-
ical energy and made a distinction between mechanical energy of the static kind and 
dynamic kind. Mechanical energy of a body in a given state refers to the work reserve 
of the body in that state. The work reserve was information for us humans because it 
told us what work could be counted on: it was mechanical energy available for man. 
The distinction between the static and the dynamic kind refers to bodies or parti-
cles which are at rest or in motion. In cases where movements were not observed, a 
conjecture was made (in heat, electricity, etc.): there is either rest or movement of 
the very small parts of bodies (A third hypothesis is inconceivable). 
Rankine realized that this is not just a way of systematizing the reserves of 
work. He introduces the concepts of potential and actual energy, which account 
for Thomson’s reserves of mechanical energy and the conservation of energy. Unlike 
Thomson, (1852a, b) Rankine (1853) establishes a quantitative relationship between 
actual and potential energy: if one increases the other decreases. With this increase 
and decrease in the same proportion, energy is conserved. His novelty is then the 
general law of energy transformation, as being the mutual transformation of actual 
and potential energies in all domains, heat, electricity, etc. 
The change from actual to kinetic performed by Thomson and Tait is only the 
result of a terminological reform. It does not change what Rankine had proposed but 
only emphasizes that actual energy is motion (Table 3.1).
81 “Kinetic energy depends on motion; and observation shows that its amount in each case is 
calculable from the mass which moves and the velocity with which it moves” (ibid. p. 602). 
82 “there is particular advantage in taking as the exact expression, one-half of the product of the 
moving mass and the square of its velocity in feet per second” (ibid. p. 602). 
83 In 1883, Thomson wrote: “A few years later, in advocating a restoration of the original and 
natural nomenclature,—“mechanics the science of machines,”—“dynamics the science of force,” 
I suggested (instead of statics and dynamics the two divisions of mechanics according to the then 
usual nomenclature) that statics and kinetics should be adopted to designate the two divisions of 
dynamics. At the same time I gave, instead of “dynamical energy,” or “actual energy,” the name 
“kinetic energy” which is now in general use to designate the energy of motion” (Thomson, 1884, 
p. 34).

Energetic Eclecticism 
In the 1870s, Maxwell published his Theory of Heat several times. This work brings 
together Rankine’s deﬁnition of energy, Thomson’s deﬁnition of mechanical energy 
and the energy conservation principle in Rankine’s and Mayer’s form. These authors, 
however, are not mentioned. If they had been, the reader would know that these 
authors have thought about the subject in different ways. Since the reader does 
not have this information, he is led to think that everything that is gathered from 
these authors about energy is characteristic of it. This is what is meant by energetic 
eclecticism. 
Energy of a body, according to Maxwell, means the capacity of the body to do 
work.84 (Here we have Rankine’s deﬁnition of energy.) The work that the body can 
do depending on its current situation is called intrinsic energy of the body.85 (This 
energy is Thomson’s ‘mechanical energy’.) Its absolute value, that is, the total energy 
of the body, is not determinable, because it would be impossible, says Maxwell, to get 
a Carnot machine working between the temperature of the body and absolute zero. 
(The total mechanical energy is not determinable, according to Thomson.) Thus, 
intrinsic energy is determined in applications with respect to a standard state.86 (This 
is Thomson’s standard state.) For this reason, the energy of a body can be negative, 
but Maxwell notes that this only means that the energy of the standard state is higher 
than that of the body; an actual negative energy would be impossible.87 
The principle of conservation of energy is introduced in the form, the sum of the 
potential and kinetic energy of all the bodies in a system will always remain the 
same.88 (This formulation of the principle comes from Rankine.) Maxwell notes,
84 “the energy of a body may be deﬁned as the capacity which it has of doing work” (Maxwell, 
1873, p. 90). 
85 “The Intrinsic energy of a body is the work which it can do in virtue of its actual condition, 
without any supply of energy from without” (ibid. p. 183). 
86 “we cannot determine experimentally the whole energy of the body. It is sufﬁcient, however, for 
all practical purposes to know how much the energy exceeds or falls short of the energy of the body 
in a certain deﬁnite condition—for instance, at a standard temperature and a standard pressure” 
(ibid. pp. 183–4). 
87 “If the body in its actual state has less energy than when it is in the standard state, the expression 
for the relative energy will be negative. This, however, does not imply that the energy of a body can 
ever be really negative, for this is impossible. It only shows that in the standard state it has more 
energy than in the actual state” (ibid. p. 184). 
88 “the sum of the potential and kinetic energy of all the bodies of the system will always remain 
the same. This principle is called the Principle of the Conservation of Energy” (ibid. p. 92). 

3.6 Energetic Eclecticism
89
however, that it cannot be said that all energy is kinetic or potential, although we are 
unable to conceive of other forms.89 In favor of the principle are the experiments: 
the principle has been shown experimentally correct in cases where energy takes the 
form of heat, magnetization, electricity, etc.90 The principle is not necessarily true, 
says Maxwell, but which one cannot but take into account. In its most general form, 
it states91 : 
“The total energy of any body or system of bodies is a quantity which can neither be increased 
nor diminished by any mutual action of these bodies, though it may be transformed into any 
of the forms of which energy is susceptible.” (Maxwell, 1873, p. 92–93). 
In this formulation, energy is a quantity. It is understandable then that Maxwell 
says that it can neither be increased nor decreased, instead of ‘can neither be created 
nor destroyed’. The latter refers to something that we cannot destroy, so it must 
exist, which is not proper of a quantity, which can only increase, decrease or remain 
constant. At the ﬁnal part of the formulation we read, however, ‘it may be trans-
formed’. To be transformed is not proper to a quantity, but rather refers to something 
that can go through metamorphoses. 
The transformation of energy is connected with the concept of heat. There is no 
reason to believe that heat is a substance, says Maxwell, because it can be generated.92 
However, there is reason to believe that it is a form of energy, because heat can be 
generated by work and work can be done by heat. Furthermore, he adds, there is a 
numerical relationship: for every unit of work that disappears, there is a given amount 
of heat.93 
Conclusion 
‘Forms of energy’ signals two meanings. On the one hand, we have kinetic and 
potential forms, which is linked to Rankine. On the other hand, we have the forms 
heat, electricity, magnetization, etc., which is connected to Mayer. 
Regarding the former, Maxwell remarks that ‘there may be other forms of energy, 
but we can only conceive of two, kinetic and potential’. This can be explained 
(Sect. 3.5). Kinetic is concerned with motion and potential subsumes rest. Now since
89 “We cannot even assert that all energy must be either potential or kinetic, though we may not be 
able to conceive any other form” (ibid. p. 92). 
90 “it has been proved by experiment to be true within the limits of error of observation, in cases 
where the energy takes the forms of heat, magnetisation, electriﬁcation, &c.” (ibid. p. 92). 
91 “the following statement is one which, if we cannot absolutely afﬁrm its necessary truth, is worthy 
of being carefully tested, and traced into all the conclusions which are implied in it” (ibid. p. 92). 
92 “The reason for believing heat not to be a substance is that it can be generated, so that the quantity 
of it may be increased to any extent, and it can also be destroyed, though this operation requires 
certain conditions to be fulﬁlled” (ibid. p. 93). 
93 “The reason for believing heat to be a form of energy is that heat may be generated by the 
application of work, and that for every unit of heat which is generated a certain quantity of mechanical 
energy disappears. Besides, work may be done by the action of heat […] Now when the appearance 
of one thing is strictly connected with the disappearance of another, so that […] we conclude that 
the one has been formed at the expense of the other, and that they are both forms of the same thing. 
Hence we conclude that heat is energy in a peculiar form” (ibid. p. 93).

A New Concept
a particle can only be in motion or at rest, a third state is not imaginable. Therefore, 
there is no other form of energy. 
The use of the concept of form in relation to heat, electricity, etc. leads to several 
forms of energy. Regarding heat and work, Maxwell points out that heat produces 
work and work gives rise to heat and this is the reason to believe that heat is a form 
of energy. Therefore, it is because heat appears in a production relationship which is 
interpreted as transformation of energy, that heat is taken as a form of energy. 
As neither the details of the interpretations nor the names of the authors of the 
approaches used are indicated, the reader is not led to think that different theses are 
involved. As these theses appear as characteristics of energy, the concept of energy 
becomes confuse.

Chapter 4 
Reiﬁcation of Energy 
This chapter is devoted to a new phase of the concept: energy becomes a substance. 
Based on Maxwell’s concept of the electromagnetic ﬁeld, Poynting defends the thesis 
that energy moves in space. His argument is only theoretical. Nevertheless, Lodge 
ﬁnds here a reason to reinforce his idea of energy: it exists in bodies and in the 
aether and can be transferred between them. Understandably, energy was understood 
as a substance. There were, however, physicists who criticized the concept. Planck, 
Hertz and Poincaré will be considered. The third and ﬁnal section of the chapter, 
“The Super Concept”, approaches a generalization of the concept of energy never 
seen in a scientiﬁc concept. This was Ostwald’s work.

Lodge’s Deﬁnition of Energy 
In 1879, Lodge sent a letter to the editors of the Philosophical Magazine: Attempt at  
a systematic classiﬁcation of the various forms of energy. He starts by criticizing the 
deﬁnition ‘energy is the power to do work’.1 The reason for the criticism is explained 
by the metaphor of capital: energy would have the power to perform work, as capital 
is purchasing power, but this power can only be realized if there are things to buy.2 
Lodge, therefore, criticizes the potentiality of the deﬁnition of energy (which came
1 The “deﬁnition of energy […] “the power of doing work” […] seems a little unhappy” (Lodge, 
1879, p. 279). 
2 “energy is power of doing work in precisely the same sense as capital is the power of buying goods. 
[…] money is a power of buying goods. It does not, however, necessarily confer upon its owner 
any buying-power, because there may not be any accessible person to buy from; and if there be, he 
may have nothing to sell. Just so with energy: it usually […] confers upon the body possessing it 
acertain power of doing work, which power it loses when it has transferred it” (ibid. p. 279).

from Thomson). To avoid this, he deﬁnes energy as the effect resulting from the work 
done on a body.3 The magnitude of energy is naturally given by the amount of work 
done in producing this effect.4 
Lodge arrives at the conservation of energy as follows. He starts from Newton’s 
third law, arguing that every relationship between two bodies is of the action-reaction 
type. Now if work is done on a body, the body gains energy. If the body itself does 
work, then he says that the body has done anti-work, which is equivalent to loss 
of energy. Since work and anti-work are equal in absolute value, Lodge continues, 
energy is conserved. This conservation is expressed in the form “energy is neither 
produced nor destroyed but is simply transferred”.5 It is transferred from one body 
to another. What if there are no bodies between these two? In those cases, the aether 
works as a transfer medium, as we shall see next. 
The forms of energy are justiﬁed by the variety of effects produced in the work 
done on bodies. Hence the types of energy will depend on the type of bodies. There 
are two main forms of energy: 
– the free movement of bodies; 
– tension between bodies.6 
The former form is called kinetic and the latter, potential, although the author 
preferred other designations.7 In the systematic classiﬁcation of energy forms, 4 
forms are indicated: translation, rotation, vibration, and tension. The table of forms 
of energy consists of 20 species, because Lodge considers 5 types of bodies. Four of 
these 5 types of bodies are systematized by size: planetary masses, ordinary masses or 
to our scale, particles or molecules, ultimate atoms. There is also “an unknown some-
thing, which is material enough to be capable of possessing energy, to disturbances 
in which electrical phenomena seem to be due, and of which probably an aspect has 
been called aether” (Lodge, 1879, p. 281). This entity will play an important role in 
the energy doctrine (Sect. 4.1.3). 
Thomson, Rankine and Lodge 
Thomson’s mechanical energy had a potential character: it was the body’s reserve 
of work available to humans, which could be used or not. Rankine expressed this
3 “Whenever work is done upon a body, an effect is produced in it which is found to increase the 
working-power of that body (by an amount not greater than the work done); hence this effect is 
called energy” (ibid. pp. 278–9). 
4 “it is measured by the quantity of work done in producing it” (ibid. p. 279). 
5 “But in every action taking place between two bodies the work is equal to the antiwork (§ 3); 
hence the energy gained by the ﬁrst body is equal to the energy lost by the second; or, on the whole, 
energy is neither produced nor destroyed, but is simply transferred from the second body to the 
ﬁrst” (ibid. p. 279). 
6 “Energy […] has two principal forms:—(1) The free motion of bodies relatively to one another; 
(2) The separation of bodies from one another against stress” (ibid. p. 280). 
7 “The energy possessed by matter in motion is called Kinetic. The energy possessed by matter 
exerting force is called Potential. It might with great propriety be called Dynamic energy; and it 
has been very conveniently called Static energy, in opposition to kinetic” (ibid. p. 281). 

4.1 Possession and Transfer of Energy

potentiality in the deﬁnition, energy is the ability of a body to do work. This capacity 
of the body is analogous to capital, which by itself does not do commerce. There-
fore, Thomson’s mechanical energy or Rankine’s energy are designations given to 
something that is potential. Lodge intends, however, to link the concept of energy 
with actual (not potential) phenomena. Hence, Lodge’s energy depends on the work 
done on the body. Regarding the measurement process, all three physicists agree that 
the measurement is to be made in units of work. 
Conservation of the amount of work in a phenomenon is assumed by Thomson in 
1851. Conservation of energy is admitted by Rankine in 1853. Lodge’s conservation 
is related to Newton’s 3rd law. This idea appears in the Treatise of natural philosophy 
by Thomson and Tait (1867, § 268) (Appendix L). 
Concerning the concept of energy 
Lodge’s article brought about a change in the terms by which energy is conceptu-
alized. ‘Conservation’ appears only once in the text: in Lodge’s metaphor, capital 
is conserved.8 The expression ‘conservation of energy’ appears in the summary of 
the paragraphs, which the author places at the end of the article.9 ‘Transformation’ 
appears only once in the text, relating kinetic and potential energy.10 The term that 
appears most often linked with energy is transfer or of the family. Another term 
linked to energy is possession, in the sense, bodies, matter and aether possess energy. 
By these data, energy is to be understood by means of the concepts possession 
and transfer. Here is the origin of the concept: energy is something that is in bodies 
and is transferred from one body to another. If it is transferred from one body to 
another, it is in motion. Now, in bodies, it is not being transferred. Therefore, we 
have no reason to say that it is in motion. Thus, one might be led to think that it is 
at rest. This idea of energy at rest and in motion led to a further distinction between 
what is in the body, for which the term ‘energy’ was used, and what is in motion, 
such as heat or work. This appears in twentieth and twenty-ﬁrst century textbooks 
(Chap. 5). 
4.1.2 
Poynting’s Algorithm 
In 1884, comes a paper by Poynting ‘On the transfer of energy in the electromagnetic 
ﬁeld’ which will be pivotal to Lodge’s thesis. The basic consideration is to look at a 
space where electric currents exist as a ﬁeld of energy transformation, which would 
appear in the forms electric, magnetic, but also as work or heat.11

kinetic to potential, or vice versâ” (ibid. p. 285).

certain points into the electric and magnetic kinds by means of batteries, dynamos, thermoelectric

Reiﬁcation of Energy
Since according to Maxwell, electric currents essentially constitute a certain distri-
bution of energy in and around the conductor, accompanied by transformation and 
movement of energy through the ﬁeld, Poynting poses the question of how energy 
moves in the ﬁeld.12 The contribution of the article lies in the general law of energy 
transfer. By this law, the energy ﬂows perpendicular to the ﬂow of the electric and 
magnetic lines of force, and the amount of ﬂow per unit area is a function of the 
electromotive intensity, the magnetic intensity, and the sine of the angle between the 
two.13 After the presentation of the law, the article develops into applications, the 
ﬁrst of which will be given as an example. 
Electric current ﬂows through a straight wire AB (Fig. 4.1). Before Maxwell, atten-
tion would have been focused on the conductor: energy was supposed to be carried 
by the current through the conductor.14 Following Maxwell and thanks to the transfer 
law, continues Poynting, the explanation becomes the following. The lines of electric 
force have the direction of the current along the conductor; the lines of magnetic force 
are perpendicular to it and go around the conductor; by the law of energy transfer, 
energy ﬂows from the outside to the inside.15 The algorithm used leads to the result 
i2R, where i stands for the current intensity and R the resistance. Now i2R is Joule’s
actions, and so on, while in other parts of the ﬁeld this energy is again transformed into heat, work 
done by electromagnetic forces, or any form of energy yielded by currents” (Poynting, 1884, p. 343). 
12 “According to MAXWELL’s theory, currents consist essentially in a certain distribution of energy 
in and around a conductor, accompanied by transformation and consequent movement of energy 
through the ﬁeld” (ibid. p. 343). “The aim of this paper is to prove that there is a general law for the 
transfer of energy, according to which it moves at any point perpendicularly to the plane containing 
the lines of electric force and magnetic force […]” (ibid. p. 344). 
13 “On interpreting the expression it is found that it implies that the energy ﬂows as stated before, 
that is, perpendicularly to the plane containing the lines of electric and magnetic force, that the 
amount crossing unit area per second of this plane is equal to the product

14 “Formerly a current was regarded as something travelling along a conductor, attention being 
chieﬂy directed to the conductor, and the energy which appeared at any part of the circuit, if 
considered at all, was supposed to be conveyed thither through the conductor by the current” (ibid. 
p. 343). 
15 “In this case very near the wire, and within it, the lines of magnetic force are circles round the 
axis of the wire. The lines of electric force are along the wire […] energy is therefore ﬂowing in 
perpendicularly through the surface, that is, along the radius towards the axis” (ibid. p. 350).

expression for the heat developed.16 Poynting’s interpretation is then the following: 
the surrounding energy ﬂows into the conductor and is transformed there into heat.17 
Conclusion 
The article deals with the transfer of energy, in the context of which expressions 
such as ﬂow, energy travel, or analogues arise. There are also expressions such as 
distribution of energy around the conductor, contained or resident energy. In these

17 “It seems then that none of the energy of a current travels along the wire, but that it comes in 
from the nonconducting medium surrounding the wire, that as soon as it enters it begins to be 
transformed into heat, the amount crossing successive layers of the wire decreasing till by the time 
the centre is reached, where there is no magnetic force, and therefore no energy passing, it has all 
been transformed into heat. A conduction current then may be said to consist of this inward ﬂow 
of energy with its accompanying magnetic and electromotive forces, and the transformation of the 
energy into heat within the conductor” (ibid. p. 351).

cases, a place of permanence of energy is indicated; in the previous ones, movements 
of energy. The result of both is that energy is something that is in one place and moves 
from one place to another. 
The idea is developed from the mathematical expression of the so-called law of 
energy transfer. The calculation leads to a vector. This is what Poynting relates to 
energy. The trajectory and motions of energy therefore have their origin in calculus. 
However, the calculus is not in itself a physical argument. Poynting also expressed 
reservations: experiments would have to be performed to prove if there is movement 
of energy. He is aware that his explanation is based on a “mental image”. He also 
states that it is necessary to accept Maxwell’s theory. For the author himself, this 
would therefore be theoretical work, to be complemented by experimental work. 
4.1.3 
Lodge’s Identity of Energy 
‘On the identity of energy’ is the title of Lodge’s (1885) paper, whose leitmotif was 
Poynting’s paper. According to Lodge, Poynting introduced the idea of continuity 
into the existence of energy.18 Now, he adds, one can follow an amount of energy 
to its emergency in another place and in another form.19 Herein lies the identity 
of energy.20 This idea, Lodge continues, represents an extension of the principle 
of conservation because the principle was based on the constancy of the quantity, 
whereas now we know the trajectory itself.The idea of an energy trajectory leads 
Lodge to focus on the means of energy transfer, as we will see. 
The new doctrine of conservation of energy, as he calls it, is based on two premises 
that support or explain that transfer: force is a component of an action-reaction 
relationship; and this relationship is always by contact.21 Here is how this is justiﬁed. 
If a body A performs work on B, B exerts a reaction, following Newton’s third law,
18 “In that paper he introduces the idea of continuity in the existence of energy […] whenever energy 
is transferred from one place to another at a distance, it is not to be regarded as destroyed at one 
place and recreated at another, but it is to be regarded as transferred, just as so much matter would 
have to be transferred; and accordingly we may seek for it in the intervening space, and may study 
the paths by which it travels” (Lodge 1885, p. 482). 
19 “The conservation of energy was satisﬁed by the total quantity remaining unaltered; there was 
no individuality about it: one form might die out, provided another form simultaneously appeared 
elsewhere in equal quantity. On the new plan we may label a bit of energy and trace its motion and 
change of form, just as we may ticket a piece of matter so as to identify it in other places under 
other conditions” (ibid. p. 482). 
20 “The energy may be watched at every instant. Its existence is continuous; it possesses identity” 
(ibid. p. 483). 
21 “the doctrine may be proved rigidly and instantaneously from two very simple premises, viz. 
Newton’s law of motion on the one hand, and the denial of action at a distance on the other” (ibid. 
p. 482). 

4.1 Possession and Transfer of Energy
99
and the connection between A and B is the means of energy transfer.22 If the two 
bodies are not actually in contact, Lodge admits ‘a something’ ﬁlling the space, which 
he presumes to be the aether, in which energy moves.23 In this way Lodge achieves 
contact between bodies in any situation and thus has a channel for the transfer of 
energy. 
One advantage of the new doctrine, according to Lodge, is to solve a typical 
difﬁculty of the previous theory, potential energy.24 If a stone falls, the potential 
energy is not to be thought of in the grave nor in the earth, but rather in the surrounding 
medium. It is this medium, he explains, that presses the stone and the earth toward 
each other.25 What was then said of the fall of a grave (energy gradually changes 
from potential to kinetic while remaining in the stone) is for the author meaningless.26 
The pendulum motion is another example. The potential energy of the medium is 
transferred to the moving bob, appears there as kinetic energy and is transferred back 
to the medium as potential energy.27 
The falling stone and the pendulum motion are the examples given of the trans-
formation and transfer of the two fundamental forms of energy, kinetic and potential. 
The justiﬁcation of these two forms is given as follows. Work consists of the product 
of two factors, force and motion.28 The two forms of energy correspond to each of 
the factors: potential corresponds to force and kinetic corresponds to motion.29 More 
exactly, potential energy corresponds to force combined with elasticity and kinetic
22 “The stress between A and B is the means of transferring energy from A to B, directly motion 
takes place in the sense AB. And the energy cannot jump from A to B, it is transferred across their 
point of contact” (ibid. p. 483). 
23 “A may be a molecule of matter, M may be the nearest molecule to it, and energy may be 
transferred from A to M, but not directly; A cannot act on M, cannot do work on it, because of the 
intervening gap. A can act on B, transferring its energy to B, B can act on C, C on D […] What B, 
C, D, …. L are, I do not presume to say; but of course one supposes them to be successive portions 
of the perfectly continuous space-ﬁlling medium Aether” (ibid. p. 484). 
24 “In the older and more hazy view of conservation of energy the idea of “potential energy” has 
always been felt to be a difﬁculty […] it was not easy or possible always to form a clear and 
consistent mental image of what was physically meant by it […] The usual ideas and language 
current about potential energy are proper to notions of action at a distance” (ibid. p. 484). 
25 “When universal contact action is admitted, the haze disappears; the energy is seen to be possessed, 
not by stone or by earth or by both of them, but by the medium which surrounds both and presses 
them together” (ibid. p. 484). 
26 “the common mode of treating a falling weight, saying that its energy gradually transforms itself 
from potential to kinetic but remains in the stone all the time, is, strictly speaking, nonsense. The 
fact is the stone never had any potential energy, no rigid body can have any; the gravitation medium 
had it however, and kept on transferring it to the stone all the time it was descending” (ibid. p. 486). 
27 “A pendulum exhibits the alternation of energy from the kinetic to the potential form and the 
accompanying transfer from matter to medium, at every half-swing” (ibid. p. 486). 
28 “Energy has two fundamental forms because work has two factors, force and motion, F, s” (ibid. 
p. 484). 
29 “The two forms of energy correspond to the factors in the product work. 
“Potential” energy correspond to F. 
“Kinetic” energy correspond to s” (ibid. p. 485).

energy, to motion combined with inertia.30 So, for example, a pillar supporting a 
structure exerts force, but has no potential energy; unlike an arrow bow, which not 
only exerts force, but because it has elasticity can also propel the arrow.31 This applies 
mutatis mutandis to motion. It is not enough for the body to be in motion. It must 
be able to produce work, which is attributed to the inertia of bodies.32 Both forms of 
energy are seen as potential work, requiring the other element to do work.33 
Conclusion 
Lodge’s contribution in this paper concerns the concept of energy. The terminology 
used is close to that of 1879. The term transfer or of the family usually appears linked 
to energy. Transfer and transformation are linked by the theory: whenever there is a 
transfer of energy, there is a change of form. Possession or of the family are terms 
expressing the relation of bodies or the medium to energy. The energy existing in the 
medium distinguishes the new doctrine from the previous one. 
The advantage of the new doctrine highlighted by Lodge is the explanation of 
potential energy. This concept was created by Rankine. The stone at a certain height, 
the example given by Lodge, has potential energy. This energy is given by the weight 
of the stone and the distance it is at. The weight of the body depends on the gravi-
tational action of the earth. Then the question was asked about where the potential 
energy is: in the body, in the Earth, or in both. Lodge answers, the potential energy 
is in the medium. This is what presses the body and the Earth towards each other. 
That question—where is the energy located—as well as Lodge’s answer presuppose 
that energy is substantial because being substantial is a necessary condition for it to 
be able to reside in a body, in the earth, in the medium. Therefore, the advantage 
pointed out only holds if one admits energy as a substance.34 
Energy in motion in space must be substantial. This idea of the motion of energy 
in space is based on the law of energy transfer in the electromagnetic ﬁeld.35 It turns
30 “Kinetic energy corresponds to motion combined with inertia, so that the motion shall continue 
even against some force […] Potential energy corresponds to force combined with elasticity (or 
something like it)” (ibid. p. 485). 
31 “A strained bow is exerting force and possesses energy. A pillar supporting a roof is exerting 
force, but possesses no energy […] Thus, then, for a body to possess potential energy we must have 
two things—the exertion of a force, together with a guarantee that that force shall be exerted over 
a certain distance; i.e. a continuance of the force even after motion is permitted” (ibid. p. 485). 
32 ““A body in motion possesses energy;” but is it so necessarily? […] Suppose it stops the instant 
you give it work to do—the instant you make it exert force. It is evident you must have not merely 
motion, you must have a guarantee of persistence of motion, the body must possess inertia” (ibid. 
p. 485). 
33 “Both forms of energy are potential work […] Kinetic energy requires the Force factor to do 
work. Potential energy requires the Motion factor to do work” (ibid. p. 485). 
34 In the same year, Tait defended the same idea: “In the physical universe there are but two classses 
of things, Matter and Energy” (Tait, 1885, p. 2).  
35 In the Treatise, Maxwell wrote: “When light is emitted, a certain amount of energy is expended 
by the luminous body, and if the light is absorbed by another body, this body becomes heated […] 
During the interval of time after the light left the ﬁrst body and before it reached the second, it must 
have existed as energy in the intervening space.” (Maxwell, 1873, § 782).

out, however, that according to Poynting, experimental evidence of the trajectories of 
energy would be lacking. Lodge did not carry out any experimental work. Therefore, 
what Poynting pointed out was missing, was still missing.

Planck 
In the middle of the 1880s, the Göttingen Philosophical Faculty denoted some confu-
sion about the concept of energy and the principle of energy conservation. Indeed, it 
poses the following question for competition: since Thomas Young, many physicists 
have attributed energy to bodies and, since William Thomson, there has been talk 
of a principle of conservation of energy valid for all bodies, by which one seems to 
understand what Helmholtz had expressed as the principle of conservation of force. 
Once the question was formulated, the following was required: a historical study 
of the semantic evolution of energy and its use in physics; an investigation into the 
forms of energy; and how the principle of conservation of energy can be formulated 
and proved as a general law of nature.36 
Planck competed in this award. The submitted work appears in book form in 1887, 
with the title The Principle of Conservation of Energy. The ﬁrst part of the book is 
devoted to the historical development of the concept; the second, to the deﬁnition 
of energy and proof of the principle of conservation; and the third and ﬁnal part, to 
the forms of energy: mechanical, thermal, chemical, electrical, and magnetic. The 
second part of the work provides the main object of the present study. 
Planck presents the following deﬁnition of energy: 
“we call energy (capacity to do work) of a system in a given state the value of all the effects, 
measured in units of work, which originate outside the system, when it passes from that state 
to another ﬁxed arbitrarily as the null state, whatever the mode of passage”.37 
In this deﬁnition, two parts can be considered: one concerns the meaning of energy 
and the other, the magnitude. By energy is understood the capacity of doing work. The
36 “Seit Thomas Young […] wird den Körpern von vielen Physikern Energie zugeschrieben, und 
seit William Thomson […] wird häuﬁg das Prinzip der Erhaltung der Energie als ein für alle Körper 
gültiges ausgesprochen, worunter dasselbe Prinzip verstanden zu werden scheint, was schon früher 
von Helmholtz unter dem Namen des Prinzips der Erhaltung der Kraft ausgesprochen war. Es 
wird nun zunächst eine genaue historische Entwicklung der Bedeutung und des Gebrauchs des 
Wortes Energie in der Physik verlangt; sodann eine gründliche physikalische Untersuchung, ob 
verschiedene Arten der Energie zu unterscheiden […] sei; endlich in welcher Weise das Prinzip der 
Erhaltung der Energie als allgemein gültiges Naturgesetz aufgestellt und bewiesen werden könne” 
(Planck, 1921, Preface to the ﬁrst edition). 
37 “bezeichnen wir die Energie (Fähigkeit, Arbeit zu leisten) eines materiellen Systems in einem 
bestimmten Zustand als den in mechanischen Arbeitseinheiten gemessenen Betrag aller Wirkungen, 
welche außerhalb des Systems hervorgebracht werden, wenn dasselbe aus seinem Zustand auf 
beliebige Weise in einen nach Willkür ﬁxierten Nullzustand übergeht” (ibid. p. 104). 

102

Reiﬁcation of Energy
magnitude is given by the value of the external effects of the system in units of work, 
when the system passes from a given state to the standard state. To give the value of 
the external effects in units of work, we need to have the mechanical equivalents of 
these effects.38 If the mechanical equivalent of the system effects in a given passage 
is unknown, we cannot account for this passage in terms of work.39 Planck suggests 
overcoming this difﬁculty in two ways. One is to recreate that passage and use this 
effect to produce work. The other is to produce that effect through work.40 If neither 
of these ways is feasible, the deﬁnition is useless, says Planck.41 
Those hypotheses assume that using work to produce the magnitude of which 
we do not know the mechanical equivalent is the same as using that magnitude to 
produce work. Here Planck struggles with the question of whether or not the amount 
of work depends on the process of transformation.42 To overcome this difﬁculty, 
Planck resorts to the principle of conservation of energy in the following form: the 
mechanical equivalent of the passage of the system from one state to the standard 
state does not depend on the mode of passage.43 Thus, the ﬁnal part of the deﬁnition
38 “Unter den “außerhalb des Systems hervorgebrachten Wirkungen” oder kürzer: unter den 
„äußeren Wirkungen” wollen wir alle am Schluß des Prozesses in der Natur eingetretenen Verän-
derungen verstehen, welche mit der Lage und Beschaffenheit der umgebenden, nicht in das 
System einbegriffenen Körper zusammenhängen, darunter also z. B. auch die Veränderung der 
Lage des Systems relativ zur Umgebung” (p. 104). “Was ferner den in der Deﬁnition gebrauchten 
Ausdruck: “Der in mechanischen Arbeitseinheiten gemessene Betrag” (kurz: Arbeitswert, mecha-
nisches Äquivalent) der äußeren Wirkungen betrifft, so hat derselbe natürlich nur unter der Voraus-
setzung einen bestimmten Sinn, daß entweder die äußeren Wirkungen an sich lediglich mechanischer 
Natur sind […] oder, falls sie von irgend anderer Art sind, daß dann ihr mechanisches Äquivalent 
schon anderweitig bekannt ist” (ibid. p. 105). 
39 “nehmen wir z. B. an, die äußeren Wirkungen beständen in der Erzeugung irgend einer eigen-
tümlichen Veränderung, etwa eines gewissen Agens, dessen Arbeitswert unbekannt sei, so läßt 
natürlicherweise die Deﬁnition zunächst im Stich” (ibid. p. 105). 
40 “man muß sich dadurch zu helfen suchen, daß man das neu erzeugte Agens auf irgend eine Weise 
wieder fortschafft, indem man es etwa zur Leistung mechanischer Arbeit oder zur Hervorbringung 
solcher Wirkungen verbraucht, die auf mechanisches Arbeitsmaß reduzibel sind […] dann stellt 
sich das mechanische Äquivalent einer Wirkung als diejenige Arbeitsmenge dar, in welche sich 
diese Wirkung verwandeln läßt” (ibid. p. 105). 
41 “Es ist aber auch sehr wohl der Fall denkbar, daß es überhaupt unmöglich ist, das neue Agens 
ganz in mechanische Wirkungen zu verwandeln, und in diesem Falle wird die für den Begriff des 
Arbeitswertes gegebene Erklärung, also auch die Deﬁnition der Energie, hinfällig” (ibid. pp. 105–6). 
42 “Hierbei bleibt es übrigens noch ganz dahingestellt, ob die Arbeitsmenge verschieden ausfällt, 
wenn die Verwandlung auf verschiedene Weise vorgenommen wird” (ibid. p. 105). 
43 “Die Energie eines materiellen Systems in einem bestimmten Zustand, genommen in bezug auf 
einen bestimmten anderen Zustand als Nullzustand, hat einen eindeutigen Wert, oder mit anderen 
Worten […] Der in mechanischen Arbeitseinheiten gemessene Betrag (das mechanische Äquivalent, 
der Arbeitswert) aller Wirkungen […] hat einen eindeutigen Wert, ist also unabhängig von der Art 
des Überganges” (ibid. pp. 110–1).

of energy, “whatever the mode of passage”, becomes valid.44 It is from this formu-
lation of the principle that, according to Planck, the deﬁnition of energy becomes 
complete.45 
From the principle, Planck draws a set of consequences. Some are exposed through 
a kind of algebra of passages of the system from one state to another. Among these 
consequences arises a second formulation of the principle of conservation of energy. 
Let us consider some of the consequences and the second formulation of the principle. 
Let A, B, C, D, … M, N be states of the system and A–B, B–C, etc. the processes 
that take the system from state A to B, from B to C, etc., represented by [AB], [BC], 
etc.. Planck ﬁrst proposition states that the energy of state A referred to state N, taken 
as the null state, is equal to the sum of the intermediate energies, i.e., [AN] = [AB] 
+ [BC] + … + [MN].46 
The additive constant that appears in the energy equation is expressed in the 
following terms. If the energy of a given state is referred to as the N state, the process 
will be given as [AN]. If the standard state is N’, the process will be given as [AN’]. 
Consequently, there is a difference, [AN]-[AN’] = [N’N], which accounts for the 
additive constant of the equation.47 There is something that depends on the choice 
of the standard state and not on the phenomenon. 
An especially interesting consequence is the one where [AB] = 0. Taking N 
as the standard state, one has [AN] = [BN].48 This means that in the passage 
[AB] no external work was performed. This is connected to the second formula-
tion of the conservation principle: the energy of the system without external action 
is conserved.49 
44 “In der Tat können wir in jedem Falle, wo aus irgend welchen Gründen unsere Deﬁnition nicht 
zum Ziele führt, uns immer noch auf eine andere Weise helfen, nämlich dadurch, daß wir den 
betreffenden Fall vorläuﬁg ganz von der Betrachtung ausschließen und die für ihn zugebende 
Deﬁnition des Energiebegriffes erst bei einer späteren Gelegenheit (S.113) nachholen, wo wir 
im Besitze verschiedener Sätze sein werden, welche die Berechnung des Wertes der Energie unter 
allen Umständen gestatten. Zu diesen Sätzen gelangen wir durch die Aufstellung des Prinzips der 
Erhaltung der Energie” (ibid. p. 110). 
45 “Wir können nun die hier abgeleiteten Sätze zugleich benutzen, um die allgemeine Deﬁnition 
des Energiebegriffs dadurch zu vervollständigen, daß wir sie auch auf diejenigen Fälle ausdehnen, 
[…]” (ibid. p. 113). 
46 “Die Energie des Systems im Zustand A, bezogen auf den Nullzustand N ist gleich der Summe 
der Energien in den Zuständen A, B, C, …, M, bezogen auf die respektiven Nullzustände: B, C, D, 
…, N” (ibid. p. 112). 
47 “Wenn wir die Energie eines materiellen Systems in einem bestimmten Zustand A einmal auf den 
Zustand N, dann auf einen anderen Zustand N’ als Nullzustand beziehen, so folgt aus der Relation: 
[AN] – [AN'] = [AN] + [N'A] = [N'N] […] Lassen wir daher bei der Bestimmung der Energie die 
Wahl des Nullzustandes ganz offen, so wird in dem Ausdruck der Energie nur eine gewisse additive 
Konstante unbestimmt gelassen” (ibid. p. 114). 
48 “Wenn speziell der Prozeß in der Weise vorsich geht, daß in der äußeren Umgebung gar keine 
Wirkungen stattﬁnden, dann ist [AB] = 0, also [AN] = [BN]: die Energie im Zustand A ist gleich 
der im Zustand B” (ibid. p. 115). 
49 “Die Energie eines materiellen Systems, in bezug auf einen beliebigen Nullzustand, ändert sich 
also nicht, wenn bei Ausführung irgend eines Prozesses keine äußere Veränderung eintritt, oder 
mit anderen Worten: wenn in dem System nur innere Wirkungen stattﬁnden. In dieser Form stellt

Reiﬁcation of Energy
This formulation of the principle leads to a conceptual question. Planck asks 
himself about how to think of the energy of the system in which energy is conserved.50 
He proposes to imagine energy as a kind of reserve, a ‘capital’.51 This conception 
would be very practical and of easy intuition, by virtue of the analogy with matter. 
Just as the sum of the total mass of a body is equal to the sum of the masses of its 
parts, the total energy of the system would be equal to the sum of the various forms 
of energy.52 
Although Planck sees the advantages of the analogy between matter and energy 
and sees therein the reason for the rapid development of the doctrine,53 the question is 
raised of whether it is legitimate to think of energy as a substance.54 There is at once 
a difﬁculty with this concept of energy. According to Planck, one cannot indicate a 
place for energy in a system.55 He then admits that the material concept of energy 
will one day be superseded. At that time, he justiﬁes it by its heuristic function, the 
search for new forms of energy56 and its intuitive character.57 
sich das Prinzip als das der Erhaltung der Energie dar, und diese Form ist es nun, die durch eine 
etwas veränderte Auffassung des Begriffes der Energie sich so ungemein bequem für die direkte 
Anschauung und fruchtbar für die weitere Behandlung erweist” (ibid. p. 115). 
50 “Dieser Satz führt uns dazu, die in einem System enthaltene Energie als eine begrifﬂich von den 
äußeren Wirkungen unabhängig bestehende Größe aufzufassen” (ibid. p. 116). 
51 “Nun haben wir uns die Energie als im System selbst beﬁndlich vorzustellen, als eine Art Vorrat 
(nach C. Neumann: “Kapital”), welcher durch innere Wirkungen unzerstörbar ist” (ibid. p. 116). 
52 “diese Auffassung ist für die unmittelbare Anschauung überaus bequem durch ihre Analogie mit 
dem Verhalten der Materie, die auch in verschiedene Formen überführbar, aber nach ihrer Quantität 
(Masse) unveränderlich ist. Ebenso wie die Gesamtmasse eines Körpers sich als die Summe der 
Massen der einzelnen in demselben enthaltenen chemischen Substanzen darstellt, so setzt sich die 
Energie eines Systems zusammen aus der Summation der einzelnen Energiearten” (ibid. p. 116). 
53 “Ohne Zweifel beruht zum großen Teil auf dieser Analogie die verhältnismäßig überraschende 
Leichtigkeit und die sieghafte Klarheit, mit der sich das Prinzip der Erhaltung der Energie binnen 
weniger Jahre die allgemeine Anerkennung eroberte und in der Überzeugung eines jeden festsetzte” 
(ibid. p. 116). 
54 “Man könnte hier die Frage aufwerfen, ob es denn wirklich für die gesunde Weiterentwicklung 
des Prinzips von Nutzen ist, in dieser Weise von der primären Deﬁnition des Begriffes abzuweichen 
und ihm eine spezielle substanzielle Deutung zu geben” (ibid. pp. 116–7). 
55 “die Unbestimmtheit liegt dann im Begriff der Energie, man kennt den Platz nicht, den man ihr 
anweisen soll, und hat auch kein Mittel, ihn zu ﬁnden” (ibid. p. 117). 
56 “[…] ist […] unverkennbar, daß mit der hier in Rede stehenden substanziellen Deutung des 
Begriffes der Energie nicht nur eine Vermehrung der Anschaulichkeit, sondern auch ein direkter 
Fortschritt in der Erkenntnis verbunden ist. Dieser Fortschritt beruht auf der Anregung zur weiteren 
physikalischen Forschung. Man wird sich nun nicht mehr damit begnügen, den Zahlenwert der 
Energie des Systems zu kennen, sondern man wird versuchen, die Existenz der verschiedenen 
Arten der Energie an den verschiedenen Elementen des Systems im Einzelnen nachzuweisen, und 
den Übergang in andere Formen und zu anderen Elementen ebenso verfolgen, wie die Bewegung 
eines Quantums Materie im Raum” (ibid. pp. 117–8). 
57 “Gewiß ist zuzugeben, daß diese (sozusagen materielle) Auffassung der Energie als eines Vorrats 
von Wirkungen, dessen Menge durch den augenblicklichen Zustand des materiellen Systems 
bestimmt ist, möglicherweise später einmal ihre Dienste getan haben und einer anderen, allge-
meineren und höheren, Vorstellung Platz machen wird: gegenwärtig ist es jedenfalls Sache der

Conclusion 
Planck wants to have a deﬁnition of energy, in which energy corresponds to something 
in phenomena. The deﬁnition does include a method of measurement but a difﬁculty 
arises with its application: one cannot always measure the mechanical equivalent. 
To overcome this obstacle, Planck resorts to the principle of conservation. However, 
in this way the deﬁnition is jeopardized: it needs a postulate; therefore, if the latter 
is false, the deﬁnition is useless. With the second formulation of the principle, that 
the energy of an isolated system does not vary, another difﬁculty arises, that of 
understanding energy. The need for a concept of energy capable of subsuming the 
idea that energy exists in the system leads one to think of it as a substance. If energy 
is a kind of substance, it should be possible to localize it in the system. Experiments, 
however, do not allow us to localize it. For this reason, Planck predicts that that 
concept of energy will one day be superseded. 
4.2.2 
Hertz’s Criticism 
In 1894, Heinrich Hertz’s Principles of Mechanics appeared. At the time, mechanics 
was the foundation of the whole of physics. Therefore, the foundation of mechanics 
itself, which was Hertz’s focus, was an important issue. He systematizes the 
mechanics of that time into two theories, which he calls images. The ﬁrst image is 
based on Newton’s laws and d’Alembert’s principle and the second image concerns 
the theory of energy. This is characterized by four primitive concepts—space, time, 
mass and energy—and one axiom—Hamilton’s principle. The concept of energy 
constitutes an obstacle to the acceptance of this theory. 
Energetics is not mature enough to provide a deﬁnition of energy, says Hertz.58 
According to the use given to the concept, however, he assumes that energy is 
conceived as a substance.59 A ﬁrst difﬁculty arises from the fact that the possible 
substance comes in such different forms as kinetic and potential energy.60 Another 
difﬁculty concerns the latter, because according to Hertz potential energy contradicts 
the character of substance61 :
physikalischen Forschung, diese Auffassung als die anschaulichste und fruchtbarste überall bis ins 
einzelne durchzubilden und ihre Konsequenzen an der Hand der Erfahrung zu prüfen” (ibid. p. 118). 
58 “zu einem befriedigenden und abschließenden Ergebnis scheint diese ganze Anschauungsweise 
noch nicht gelangt” (Hertz, 1894, p. 26). 
59 “Mehrere ausgezeichnete Physiker versuchen heutzutage, der Energie so sehr die Eigenschaften 
der Substanz zu leihen, daß sie annehmen, jede kleinste Menge derselben sei zu jeder Zeit an 
einen bestimmten Ort des Raumes geknüpft und bewahre bei allem Wechsel desselben und bei aller 
Verwandlung der Energie in neue Formen dennoch ihre Identität” (ibid. pp. 25–6). 
60 “Eine besondere Schwierigkeit muß auch von vornherein der Umstand bereiten, daß die angeblich 
substanzartige Energie in zwei so gänzlich verschiedenen Formen auftritt, wie es die kinetische und 
die potentielle Form sind” (ibid. p. 26). 
61 “die potentielle Energie […], welche eine selbständige Feststellung fordert, widerstrebt zugleich 
jeder Deﬁnition, welche ihr die Eigenschaften einer Substanz beilegt” (ibid. p. 26).

Reiﬁcation of Energy
– the quantity of a substance is necessarily a positive quantity, whereas the potential 
energy of a system can be negative62 ; 
– in the analytical expression of the quantity of a substance, an additive constant has 
as much signiﬁcance as the rest, whereas the additive constant in the expression 
of potential energy is not signiﬁcant63 ; 
– the content of substance in a given system depends on the state of the system, 
whereas the potential energy of a system depends on the existence of distant 
masses, which probably, Hertz adds, never had any inﬂuence on the system.64 
Conclusion 
The difﬁculty with energy lies in the following: it is conceived as a substance when 
it contradicts the very concept of substance. In conformity with Hertz’s criteria of 
evaluating a physical theory, energetics is logically non-permissible. 
4.2.3 
Poincaré’s Criticism 
Three years after the Principles of Mechanics, Poincaré wrote an article on this 
book. He corroborates the advantages of a mechanical theory based on the concept 
of energy over a theory based on force pointed out by Hertz: dispensing with atoms; 
and being less incomplete, by eliminating unnatural motions consistent with the 
classical theory.65 Hertz’s objections to the concept of energy are seen as being 
of a “quasi-metaphysical” order.66 However, Poincaré corroborates the difﬁculty in 
locating energy, for if the kinetic energy could be located in the mobile, it would no 
longer be clear where to locate the potential.67 He also refers to the arbitrary constant
62 “Die Menge einer Substanz ist eine notwendig positive Größe; die in einem System enthaltene 
potentielle Energie scheuen wir uns nicht, als negativ anzunehmen” (ibid. p. 26). 
63 “Bedeutet ein analytischer Ausdruck die Menge einer Substanz, so hat eine additive Konstante 
in dem Ausdruck dieselbe Wichtigkeit wie der Rest; in dem Ausdruck für die potentielle Energie 
eines Systems hat die additive Konstante niemals eine Bedeutung” (ibid. p. 26). 
64 “Endlich kann der Inhalt eines physikalischen Systems an einer Substanz nur abhängen von dem 
Zustande des Systems selbst; der Inhalt gegebener Materie an potentieller Energie aber hängt ab von 
dem Vorhandensein entfernter Massen, welche vielleicht niemals Einﬂuß auf das System hatten” 
(ibid. p. 26). 
65 “La théorie énergétique présente sur la théorie classique les avantages suivants: 
1o Elle est moins incomplète; c’est-à-dire que les principes de la conservation de l’énergie 
et de Hamilton nous apprennent plus que les principes fondamentaux de la théorie classique et 
excluent certains mouvements que la Nature ne réalise pas et qui seraient compatibles avec la 
théorie classique; 
2o Elle nous dispense de l’hypothèse des atomes, qu’il était presque impossible d’éviter avec la 
théorie classique” (Poincaré, 1897, p. 738). 
66 “Ce sont d’autres objections, d’ordre presque métaphysique, que Hertz développe le plus 
longuement” (ibid. p. 739). 
67 “D’autre part, pour matérialiser l’énergie, il faut la localiser; pour l’énergie cinétique, cela est 
facile, mais il n’en est pas de mème pour l’énergie potentielle. Où localiser l’énergie potentielle due

in the energy equation as something that ‘shocks the spirit’68 and shows, through an 
example, that energy can be negative.69 
In addition to his acceptance of Hertz’s objections, Poincaré has his own objection 
to the energy theory, which is the following. If there is a system of points, whose forces 
depend on distances, then there is a certain quantity accessible to experiment that 
remains constant. This quantity is given by the sum of two terms, continues Poincaré, 
where one depends only on the position of the points (potential energy) and the other 
is proportional to the square of the velocities (kinetic energy). The difﬁculty arises 
if the forces involved in the potential energy, also depend on velocity. 
Poincaré gives as an example of such a force, the one suggested by Weber: the 
action between two electric molecules also depends on velocity. If potential energy 
does not depend only on position but also on velocity, then it is not possible to sort 
out what depends on velocities or is independent of them. 
If one considers several forms of energy, Poincaré continues, the principle takes 
the form 
upper T plus upper U
 plus upper Q equals c o n s t a n t
where T represents the kinetic energy, U the potential energy of position, and Q 
the molecular internal energy, of chemical or electrical form. There is no objection, 
continues Poincaré, if the decomposition can be performed: T is proportional to the 
squares of the velocities; U does not depend on the velocities; and Q depends only 
on the internal state. Electriﬁed bodies provide, however, cases where this sorting is 
not possible. In such cases, says Poincaré, the principle of conservation of energy 
tells us that something remains constant, i.e., there is something that is constant, but 
this something has not the property of decreasing in one component and increasing 
in the others in due proportion. Thus, Poincaré concludes, in that way, the principle 
is a tautology because if there are laws of nature, something must remain constant.70 
4.3 
The Super Concept 
In 1908, Ostwald published The Energy. In this book, he presents the energetic 
interpretation of physical and chemical phenomena, but also of life, of the phenomena 
of the spirit and of life in society.
à l’attraction de deux astres? Est-ce dans l’un des deux astres? Est-ce dans les deux? Est-ce dans le 
milieu intermédiaire?” (ibid. p. 739).
68 “Comme nous disposons de la constante c, nous pouvons la supposer assez grande pour que 
l’énergie soit positive; il y a dejà là quelque chose d’arbitraire qui choque l’esprit” (ibid. p. 739). 
69 “Si l’énergie est pour ainsi dire matérialisée, elle devra ètre toujours positive. […] nous ne 
pouvons pas assurer que l’énergie demeurera toujours positive” (ibid. p. 739). 
70 “Il ne nous reste plus qu’un énoncé pour le principe de la conservation de l’énergie; il y a 
quelque chose qui demeure constant. Sous cette forme, il se trouve à son tour hors des atteintes de 
l’expérience et se réduit à une sorte de tautologie” (ibid. p. 739).

Reiﬁcation of Energy
In the introduction to the book, one reads, ‘energy embodies the real’. This is 
explained as follows: energy is real because it is active in what happens; and it is 
real because it constitutes the content of events.71 This has consequences. Ostwald 
explicitly claims that energy makes the concept of matter superﬂuous. The reason for 
this is that the properties attributed to matter can be given by the forms of energy. Thus, 
for example, bodies are said to have mass and weight. Now mass corresponds to one of 
the factors of the energy of motion and weight is a factor of the energy of gravitation. 
(The energy of motion is understood as the product of mass by the square of velocity72 
and the energy of gravitation as the product of weight by height.73 ) Ostwald calls them 
material factors, simply because they are related to what is understood as matter.74 
Mass and weight are in this context only examples. Energy of form,75 energy of 
volume,76 of surface, of distance and with space as the ﬁeld of activity of energies77 
provide Ostwald with an energetic expression for what was ascribed to matter. Hence, 
he goes on to dispense with this concept.78 In addition, he adds, the concept of energy 
is able to account for properties of bodies, such as heat or chemical properties, which 
for one reason or another are not part of the concept of matter.79 In sum, the concept of
71 “Die Energie ist daher in allen realen oder konkreten Dingen als wesentlicher Bestandteil 
enthalten, der niemals fehlt, und insofern können wir sagen, daß in der Energie sich das eigentlich 
Reale verkörpert. 
Und zwar ist die Energie das Wirkliche in zweierlei Sinn. Sie ist das Wirkliche insofern, als sie 
das Wirkende ist; wo irgend etwas geschieht, kann man auch den Grund dieses Geschehens durch 
Kennzeichnung der beteiligten Energien angeben. Und zweitens ist sie das Wirkliche insofern, als 
sie den Inhalt des Geschehens anzugeben gestattet” (Ostwald, 1912a, p. 5).  
72 “Nehmen wir als Beispiele dieMasse, den Extensitätsfaktor der Bewegungsenergie” (ibid. p. 112). 
“ist die Masse nicht etwa umgekehrt proportional der Geschwindigkeit zu setzen, sondern umgekehrt 
proportional dem Quadrat der Geschwindigkeit” (ibid. p. 119). 
73 “Es gibt also eine Schwereenergie oder Gravitationsenergie, und ihre Faktoren lassen sich leicht 
erkennen. Als Extensität erkennen wir alsbald die Gewichtsmenge […] Und als Intensität erkennen 
wir die Höhe, zu welcher das Gewicht gehoben wird” (ibid. p. 117). 
74 “Materielle Faktoren nenne ich die fraglichen Größen deshalb, weil durch sie der alte Begriff 
der Materie bedingt wird” (ibid. p. 111). 
75 “Da ein fester Körper seine Gestalt ändern kann, ohne sein Volum zu ändern, so liegt hier eine 
unterschiedliche, wenn auch ähnliche Art Energie vor, welche wir […] Formenergie nennen wollen. 
In der Physik ist diese Eigenschaft als Elastizität bekannt” (ibid. p. 114). 
76 “Hier haben wir die erste Energieart, die unserem Körper zukommt. Wir nennen sie Volumenergie, 
weil sie sich mit dem Volum des Körpers ändert” (ibid. p. 113). 
77 “Den Raum haben wir als das Betätigungsgebiet der Energien auffassen gelernt; es kann uns 
daher nicht wundernehmen, daß neben der Volum- und Formenergie, die den dreidimensionalen 
Raum erfüllt, auch noch eine Oberﬂächenenergie […] und eine lineare oder Distanzenergie besteht, 
welche sich in den Gravitationswirkungen geltend macht” (ibid. p. 118). 
78 “So sehen wir die Materie überﬂüssig werden, weil wir sie analysiert und ihre Bestandteile 
erkannt haben” (ibid. p. 124). 
79 “Den Wärmeinhalt der Körper pﬂegen wir nicht zur Materie zu rechnen, obwohl es sich ebenso um 
eine besondere Energieart handelt […] Es liegt dies daran, daß wir den Extensitätswert der Wärme, 
die Entropie, so gut wie gar nicht kennen” (ibid. p. 124). “Die chemische Energie […] gehört 
ebenso wie die vorher genannten Grundenergien zu dem eisernen Bestande eines jeden Körpers 
und hat ausgesprochen “materiellen” Charakter. Man muß es nur der Unkenntnis der chemischen 
Erscheinungen zu der Zeit, wo der Begriff der Materie festgestellt wurde, zuschreiben” (ibid. p. 125). 

4.3 The Super Concept
109
energy subsumes matter and properties of matter and is, consequently, more general 
than the concept of matter. 
Let us move on to the living being issue, where the main topic is the human being. 
From an energetic point of view, the living being is in a permanent exchange of 
energy with the outside.80 Taken as an energy system, chemical energy is the most 
fundamental energy of a living being. The food it uses is made up of chemical energy. 
Our muscles work thanks to chemical energy and even the mode of action of nerves 
is linked to this form of energy. Most likely, Ostwald adds, the very phenomena 
of memory have their origin in chemical relations.81 The author notes that he is 
approaching the issues with the means available to science,82 which in some cases 
were scarce, because the research was very recent.83 
His approach to psychic phenomena in general develops under two headings: 
on the one hand the traditional discussion between matter and spirit; on the other 
hand, the relation of spirit to the concept of energy. According to Ostwald, what 
is traditionally related with the spirit can be expressed in energetic terms84 : the  
impressions of the senses are seen as passage of energy; reception by the nerves 
is understood as transformation of energy; communication through the nerves is 
interpreted as propagation of energy.85 The energy of the nerves is said to be psychic 
energy, whose basis is chemical energy.86 Since psychic phenomena can be given
80 “Von unserem Standpunkte ist ein wesentliches, wenn auch nicht das zureichende Kennzeichen 
des Lebens die beständige Energiebetätigung” (ibid. p. 129). 
81 “Unsere Nahrungsmittel bestehen aus chemischer Energie […] Unsere Muskeln arbeiten mit 
chemischer Energie und ebenso ist die noch so geheimnisvolle Wirkungsweise der Nerven gleich-
falls mit dieser Energieart auf das engste verbunden. Vor allen Dingen aber beruht aller Wahrschein-
lichkeit nach eine besondere Eigentümlichkeit aller Lebenserscheinungen gleichfalls auf chemis-
chen Verhältnissen, nämlich die Erscheinung des Gedächtnisses im allgemeinsten Sinne, wie sie 
zuerst von E. Hering erkannt worden ist” (ibid. p. 134). 
82 “die Natur verfügt selbstverständlich über den gesamten Bestand an Möglichkeiten […] Unsere 
Erklärungsversuche müssen wir dagegen mit dem augenblicklich bekannten Bestand unserer 
Wissenschaft Machen” (ibid. p. 136). 
83 “Ich bin gern bereit, anzuerkennen, daß die Ähnlichkeiten zunächst nur sehr oberﬂächlicher Natur 
sind; doch muß andererseits erwogen werden, daß das Gebiet chemischer Erscheinungen, das hier 
in Betracht kommt, erst seit einem Jahrzehnt der systematischen Bearbeitung unterworfen worden 
ist, und daß daher nur kleine Teile desselben inzwischen bekannt geworden sind” (ibid. p. 135). 
84 “[…] glaube ich so auffassen zu dürfen, daß die geistigen Geschehnisse ebenso sich als 
energetische auffassen und deuten lassen, wie alle übrigen Geschehnisse auch” (ibid. p. 144). 
85 “Nun haben wir bereits gesehen, daß ein Sinneseindruck ganz allgemein beschrieben werden 
kann als ein Energieübergang zwischen der Außenwelt und einem Körperteil, der durch besondere 
Organisation empﬁndlich für kleine Energieunterschiede gemacht worden ist. Die Tatsache, daß 
verschiedenartige Energien, die auf den gleichen Apparat wirken, doch Empﬁndungen gleicher Art 
auslösen (z.B. Lichterscheinungen durch mechanische Einwirkung auf den Sehnerven), erfordert 
die Deutung, daß bereits im Sinnesapparat eine Umformung der äußeren Energie in eine andere 
Form stattﬁndet, welche durch den Nerv fortgepﬂanzt wird […] Wir wissen aber, daß irgendeine 
Energie fortgepﬂanzt wird […] Wir wollen also der Kürze wegen von Nervenenergie reden” (ibid. 
p. 145). 
86 “Wohl aber wissen wir, daß die Quelle dieser psychischen Energie chemischer Natur ist” (ibid. 
p. 153).

Reiﬁcation of Energy
in terms of energy and the author had already shown that the concept of matter was 
dispensable, the matter-spirit dilemma would no longer arise.87 Energetics is able to 
account for phenomena that were traditionally attributed to one or the other.88 
The last chapter of the book is entitled “the sociological energetics”. The subject 
is man in society. Energy emerges in complex organizational activities, but also 
in simple situations, as, for example, using a stick to reach something. Ostwald 
explains that through the stick’s form of energy, muscular energy is transformed and 
communicated there, where the stick reaches.89 Cutting objects, a knife or a sword, 
are other examples of transformers of energy. Here muscle energy is concentrated 
on a thin surface, increasing the intensity of the pressure.90 In accordance with the 
purposes and cultural development of societies, the means can be very complex: 
animals, men, machines, fuels, etc.91 Ostwald puts as a general task to the whole 
culture, to ﬁnd the transformation coefﬁcients of the most favorable energies.92 
This task appears with an ethical dimension in his book The Energetic Imperative 
(Ostwald, 1912b). This imperative simply states, don’t waste energy, harness it. 
This wording alone could lead one to think that it is a warning not to use energy 
unnecessarily. However, the imperative also concerns another part of human action. 
If, for example, in a teacher’s competition the jury chooses the candidate least able 
for the job, the jury is wasting energy in the sense of Ostwald. 
In the ﬁrst of the two parts of the 1908 book, a history of energetics is presented. 
Mayer was the ﬁrst energeticist. The history of energetics began in 1842, with Mayer’s 
ﬁrst writing. Nevertheless, there was a prehistory, so to speak, that takes Ostwald 
to the Greeks.93 Relevant points in the history of energy before 1842 were: Jean 
Bernoulli’s proposition about the balance of forces, where energy was understood as
87 “Es besteht […] gar nicht mehr die Aufgabe, zu ermitteln, wie Geist und Materie in Wechsel-
wirkung treten können, sondern es entsteht die Frage, wie sich der Begriff der Energie, der viel 
weiter als der der Materie ist, zu dem Begriff des Geistes stellt “ (ibid. p. 144). 
88 “für die mechanistische Weltauffassung besteht zwischen den physischen Erscheinungen als 
mechanischen einerseits und den geistigen andererseits eine unüberbrückbare Kluft; für die ener-
getische Weltauffassung besteht im Gegenteile ein stetiger Zusammenhang zwischen den einfachsten 
Energiebetätigungen, den mechanischen, und den verwickeltsten, den psychischen” (ibid. p. 156). 
89 “Nehmen wir das einfachste aller Werkzeuge, den abgebrochenen Baumast […] Durch die 
Formenergie des Stabes […] wird die Muskelenergie transformiert und dorthin übertragen, wo 
der Stab auftritt” (ibid. p. 161). 
90 “Eine andere Art von Transformatoren ﬁnden wir in den schneidenden Werkzeugen vor. Hier 
wird durch die schmale Druckﬂäche der Schneide eine Konzentration der Muskelenergie auf diese 
lineare Berührungsﬂäche und eine entsprechende Steigerung der Intensität des Druckes bewirkt” 
(ibid. p. 161). 
91 “Die nächste Stufe ist die Aneignung fremder Arbeit für eigene Zwecke […] ist die Verwendung 
anderer Menschen in solchem Sinne […] Die dritte Stufe in der Besitzergreifung fremder Energien 
ist endlich die der anorganischen” (ibid. p. 162). 
92 “Man darf wirklich als die allgemeine Aufgabe der gesamten Kultur die hinstellen, die Trans-
formationskoefﬁzienten der umzuwandelnden Energien so günstig wie möglich zu gestalten” (ibid. 
p. 165). 
93 “So kann man zwar angeben, daß die klare Feststellung allgemeinen Begriffes der Energie nicht 
früher als im Jahre 1842 erfolgt ist, und könnte somit, wenn man genaue geschichtliche Kapitelein-
teilungen liebt, die Geschichte der Energielehre oder Energetik von diesem Zeitpunkte ab beginnen.

4.3 The Super Concept
111
the product of force by the measured path94 ; the recognition of the impossibility of 
perpetual motion; and Mechanics that subsumed statics and dynamics through forms 
of energy, work and energy of motion, respectively.95 
The fourth chapter of the book is on “the mechanical equivalent of heat”. Mayer, 
whose article (1842) is transcribed (Ostwald, 1912a, pp. 52–8), considered mechan-
ical work and heat as forms of one and the same thing.96 Ostwald interprets this ‘same 
thing’ as a kind of substance, which, he adds, had been fundamental for his own 
research.97 Joule’s explanation of heat, consisting of a motion of particles of matter, 
atoms or molecules, is considered an ad hoc hypothesis.98 Helmholtz addressed the 
development of heat in animals as Mayer did, but used, however, Joule’s mechanistic 
hypothesis as his fundamental idea.99 (Ostwald’s objection to this hypothesis stems 
from the difﬁculty in explaining psychic phenomena mechanically.100 ) Rankine gave
Aber ebensowohl muß man zugeben, daß die ersten Ansätze zur Gestaltung dieses Begriffes […] 
bis zu den griechischen Mathematikern und Naturphilosophen zurückverfolgen lassen” (ibid. p. 9).
94 “Doch der klare Ausspruch des Prinzips, der sogar bezüglich der Bezeichnungsweise ganz modern 
ist, ﬁndet sich erst in einem Briefe, den Jean Bernoulli im Jahre 1717 an Varignon geschrieben hat. 
Die entscheidende Stelle lautet: “En tout équilibre de forces quelconques, en quelque manière 
qu’elles soient appliquées, et suivant quelques directions qu’elles agissent les uns sur les outres, 
ou médiatement, ou immédiatement, la somme des énergies afﬁrmatives sera égale à la somme des 
énergies négatives, prises afﬁrmativement.“ […] Als Energie wird ausdrücklich das Produkt der 
Kraft in dem durchmessenen Weg, letzterer in der Richtung der Kraft gerechnet, deﬁniert” (ibid. 
p. 16–7). 
95 “So deﬁnieren wir besser die Statik als die Wissenschaft von der Energieform, welche man Arbeit 
nennt, und haben sachgemäß zu fragen, ob für die Dynamik vielleicht eine ähnliche Deﬁnition 
vorhanden ist. Die Antwort lautet bejahend. Auch für dieses zweite Gebiet der Mechanik wird 
sich als Zentralbegriff eine bestimmte Energieart herausstellen, welche wir die Bewegungsenergie 
nennen werden” (ibid. p. 29). 
96 “Man müßte sich nur entschließen, zwei  so grundverschiedene Dinge, wie mechanische Arbeit 
und Wärme als zwei Formen desselben Wesens zu betrachten. Zwar ist die Physik, wie sie auf der 
Universität gelehrt worden war, himmelweit von einem solchen Gedanken entfernt” (ibid. p. 48). 
97 “Für unsere allgemeine Untersuchung ist das Wesentlichste, was Mayer geleistet hat, die 
substanzielle Auffassung dessen, was er Kraft nennt, d. h. der Energie” (ibid. p. 58). 
98 “Er [Joule] betrachtete das konstante Verhältnis zwischen Arbeit und Wärme, welches er durch 
seine Versuche bestätigt hatte, als ein Zeichen dafür, daß auch die Wärme im Grunde mechanischer 
Natur sei und daß sie, entsprechend einer bereits damals weit verbreiteten Anschauung, in einer 
Bewegung der kleinsten Teilchen der Materie, der Atome oder Moleküle, bestehe. Alsdann würde es 
sich bei der Umwandlung von Arbeit in Wärme um einen ganz ähnlichen Vorgang handeln, wie bei 
der Umwandlung von Arbeit in lebendige Kraft gewöhnlicher oder sichtbarer Art, und damit wäre 
das Äquivalentsgesetz “erklärt”. Allerdings ist diese Erklärung von derselben unbefriedigenden 
Beschaffenheit, wie alle ad hoc erfundenen Hypothesen” (ibid. p. 62–3). 
99 “Der dritte Forscher, welchem wir Wesentliches für die Ein- und Durchführung des Gesetzes 
von der Erhaltung der Energie verdanken, ist H. Helmholtz. Er ist  auf gleichem Wege wie  Mayer, 
nämlich durch Nachdenken über das Problem der Wärmeentwicklung im tierischen Körper, zu 
seinen Schlüssen gelangt […] Als Grundgedanken benutzt er den gleichen, wie Joule, nur daß er 
ihn mathematisch zu vertiefen weiß” (ibid. p. 64). 
100 “Daß die Natur auf die Mechanik bewegter Atome zurückzuführen sei, galt nicht als eine noch des 
Beweises bedürftige Hypothese, sondern als ein Postulat der wissenschaftlichen Forschung […] Erst

Reiﬁcation of Energy
an impetus to energetics, but he was also committed to the mechanistic hypothesis.101 
Hence, Ostwald does not consider him an energeticist. An imprint of this retrograde 
perspective had remained in the distinction between actual and potential energy.102 
Nevertheless, he recognizes Rankine’s merit of having observed that the various ener-
gies are given as products of two factors.103 (This remark by Rankine was crucial for 
Ostwald’s approach to matter and energy, which led to the elimination of the concept 
of matter.) 
Conclusion 
Ostwald used Mayer’s concept of energy (force), substantialized it, and generalized 
it to all scientiﬁc domains and to ethics. For this generalization, he uses the forms of 
energy (chemical, psychic, etc.) and the idea of an ‘energy transformer’. It is through 
this concept that he generalizes energy to ethics. If in a competition for teachers, the 
example given above, the candidate with the least capacity for the job is chosen, the 
worst energy transformer, among those available, was chosen. 
There is a reason for Ostwald’s interest in Energetics. He advocates this theory 
because the concept of energy is fundamental in scientiﬁc research. In a controversy 
with Boltzmann (1896a, b), he further points out that he defends energetics because 
the concept of energy had been crucial to his own research (Ostwald, 1896).104

Produkt zweier Faktoren darstellen lassen” (ibid. p. 100-1).

Trends in Contemporary Textbooks 
‘Trends in contemporary textbooks’ might lead one to think that the focus of this 
chapter is on physics teaching. Contemporary textbooks appear here, however, 
because they present deﬁnitions of the concept of energy and formulations of the 
conservation principle. It is these deﬁnitions and formulations that will be analyzed 
in the ﬁrst two sections of this chapter. (The principles will be addressed ﬁrst, because 
the most used concept of energy comes from the conservation principle.) The third 
section deals with the references to Mayer and Joule used by textbook writers when 
introducing the issue of energy. Throughout the chapter, connections between the 
propositions addressed and the corresponding ones from the nineteenth century are 
made. 
5.1 
Principles 
This section is titled ‘principles’ and not ‘principles of conservation of energy’ 
because not all principles that follow, which concern the heat-work relationship, 
use the concept ‘energy’. 
5.1.1 
Principle of Equivalence 
At the beginning of the twentieth century, ‘principle of equivalence’ was a common 
concept for the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. In 1919, Preston writes: 
“The modern science of thermodynamics is based on two fundamental principles […] The 
ﬁrst of these is the principle of equivalence”. (Preston, 1919, 667)1 
1 Voigt used the same idea: “Die so verallgemeinerte Energiegleichung kann als die exakte 
Formulierung des Satzes von der Äquivalenz von Wärme und Arbeit gelten” (Voigt, 1903, p. 78).

Müller and Pouillet (1926), preferred the concept ‘principle of equivalence’ to 
‘principle of conservation of energy’. For them, the latter was valid because the 
former was valid. Furthermore, they wrote: 
“Energy is regarded as indestructible. The principle of energy is therefore at ﬁrst not an 
empirical law, but a postulate, which is, however, quite consistent with the facts of experience 
(law of equivalence)”2 
‘Principle of energy’ in the quote refers to ‘principle of conservation of energy’, 
since energy is taken as indestructible, therefore, constant in quantity. This prin-
ciple as such does not come from experiments, according to these authors. Only 
the equivalence is based on experiments. The principle of equivalence has another 
advantage, according to these authors. Stating that heat and work are equivalent, it 
avoids assumptions about the nature of heat.3 Due to the advantages of the equiv-
alence principle, one would ask why consider the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics in 
terms of energy. There is only an epistemological reason for that: 
“Since the main aim of physical science is to obtain a uniform, simple overall picture, one 
is forced to go beyond the formal, purely descriptive principle of equivalence, even if in this 
step one has to leave the ground of immediate experience”.4 
The concept ‘principle of equivalence’ has fallen into disuse, although Allen and 
Maxwell still used it in 1962: 
“J. P. Joule was the ﬁrst to establish on a satisfactory experimental basis the Principle of 
Equivalence. This principle may be expressed by saying that when exchange occurs between 
work and heat, the ratio of the exchange is ﬁxed”. (Allen & Maxwell, 1962, p. 284) 
5.1.1.1
Historical Connection 
Clausius’ and Thomson’s ﬁrst law of the theory of heat established the validity 
of the mechanical equivalent of heat (Sect. 3.1). In the 1850s, a search begins to 
determine the mechanical equivalent of heat through new methods (Helm, 1898, 
p. 34; Kipnis, 2014, p. 2028). The convergence of the results obtained led to the idea 
that the equivalent was valid in general. This validity was expressed by ‘principle of 
equivalence’. 
The French physicist Émile Verdet taught in his courses: “The principle of equiv-
alence of heat and work is the ﬁrst fundamental principle of the mechanical theory
2 “Energie wird als unzerstörbar angesehen. Das Energieprinzip ist somit zunächst kein empirisches 
Gesetz, sondern ein Postulat, das sich allerdings mit den Erfahrungstatsachen (Äquivalenzgesetz) 
durchaus im Einklang beﬁndet”. (Müller & Pouillet, 1926, p. 126) 
3 Die “Formulierung des ersten Hauptsatzes, die von jeder Hypothese, etwa über die Natur der 
Wärme frei ist, besagt daher einfach: Wärme und mechanische Arbeit sind äquivalent” (ibid. p. 109). 
4 “Da nun gerade der Gewinn eines einheitlichen, einfachen Gesamtbildes das Hauptziel der 
physikalischen Wissenschaft bildet, ist man gezwungen, über das formale, rein beschreibende 
Äquivalenzprinzip hinauszugehen, wenn auch bei diesem Schritte der Boden der unmittelbaren 
Erfahrung verlassen werden muß”. (ibid. p. 126)

of heat”.5 The demonstration of the principle he gave is based on experimental 
determinations of the mechanical equivalent of heat (Joule, Hirn and Favre) and the 
convergence of the values obtained (Verdet, 1868, pp. 39–74). 
In the Thermodynamics course (1888–89), Poincaré has a chapter on the equiva-
lence principle. In the demonstration of the principle, he uses a set of experimental 
results on the mechanical equivalent of heat (Joule, Hirn and Violle) and shows that 
the values obtained conform to each other. It is this invariability of the equivalent, 
says Poincaré, that constitutes the demonstration of the principle.6 He continues, 
this principle has the advantage over the principle of conservation of energy of not 
making any assumptions about the molecular constitution of bodies.7 
5.1.2 
Perpetuum Mobile 
Some authors explained the principle of conservation of energy through the 
perpetuum mobile or even took the impossibility of perpetuum mobile as an 
expression of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. 
In the Treatise on Heat, Saha and Srisvastava present the principle of conservation 
of energy as the result of human experience, the impossibility of a perpetual motion 
machine. 
“It follows from a result of human experience which may be stated in this form: “It is 
impossible to design a machine which will create energy out of nothing and produce perpetual 
motion. Energy can only be transformed from one form to the other.”” (Saha & Srisvastava, 
1935, p. 434) 
The authors do not tell us how the impossibility of perpetual motion led to the 
principle of conservation of energy. Indeed, they use the idea of the impossibility of 
creating motion out of nothing and replace ‘motion’ with ‘energy’. 
In Wolf’s Elements of Physics, the impossibility of a perpetuum mobile is a way 
of expressing the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics: “the ﬁrst law can be expressed in the 
short form: A perpetuum mobile is not possible”.8 
5 “Le principe de l’équivalence de la chaleur et du travail est le premier principe fondamental de la 
théorie mécanique de la chaleur”. (Verdet, 1868, Vol. 7, p. 39)  
6 “Cette invariabilité de E constitue précisément le principe de l’équivalence”. (Poincaré 1892, 
p. 58) 
7 “Cette manière d’envisager ce principe, aujourd’hui généralement adoptée, présente l’avantage 
de ne faire aucune hypothèse sur la constitution moléculaire des corps”. (Poincaré 1892, p. 65) 
Poincaré arrives at the principle of conservation of energy from the hypothesis of central forces. 
Hence the reference to the hypothesis of molecular constitution in the quote. 
8 “Man hat für derartige Phantasiemaschinen den Namen geprägt. Daher wird schließlich der erste 
Hauptsatz auch gern in der kurzen Form ausgesprochen: Ein Perpetuum mobile ist nicht möglich”. 
(Wolf 1949, p. 273)

5.1.2.1
Historical Connection 
In 1775, the Academy of Sciences in Paris passed the resolution not to examine “any 
machine announced as showing perpetual motion” (Elkana, 1974, p. 30) Conserva-
tion of energy does not come, however, from this experience with machines. The 
only one of the four so-called discoverers (Chap. 2) who mentions the impossi-
bility of perpetual motion is Colding. However, he does not use the impossibility 
of perpetuum mobile to justify his thesis, but rather the opposite: “this thesis seems 
so pressingly necessary for a complete proof of the impossibility of a Perpetuum 
Mobile that without it every such proof must be regarded as false” (Colding, 1856, 
p. 14).9 
Expressing the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics through the impossibility of a 
perpetuum mobile leaves out an important aspect of the law, which is the mechanical 
equivalent of heat, for which, in fact, the law was created. 
5.1.3 
Principle of Conservation of Energy 
The most common formulation of the principle of conservation of energy uses 
three concepts that express properties of energy: uncreatable, indestructible and 
transformable. 
Hudson and Nelson (1982) write: 
“energy can only be changed from one form to another; it cannot be created or destroyed. 
This conclusion, based on experiment, is known as the law of conservation of energy”. 
(Hudson & Nelson, 1982, p. 95) 
If energy cannot be destroyed, then one could infer that energy is something real. 
The authors, however, point out that energy is not a substance: “Although it appears 
in many different forms, it is not a physical substance, but a calculated quantity” 
(ibid. p. 95). 
Breithaupt stresses that energy exists in different forms, which may lead one to 
think that it is something real: 
“Energy exists in different forms” 
“Energy can be transformed from any one form into other forms. Whenever energy 
changes from one form into other forms, the total amount of energy is unchanged. This 
general rule is known as the principle of conservation of energy”. (Breithaupt, 1999, p. 157) 
Hecht used ‘transformation’ and ‘transfer’ in the formulation of the principle: 
“Energy can neither be created nor destroyed, but only transferred from one system to another 
and transformed from one form to another”. (Hecht, 2000, p. 571)
9 Helmholtz assumed that it is impossible to get a lasting motive force out of nothing. Caneva 
addresses the relation of this principle to the impossibility of perpetuum mobile. (Caneva,  2021, 
pp. 1–4). Helmholtz, however, refers his principle to Carnot and Clapeyron (Sect. 2.4). 

5.1 Principles

This formulation could lead to the idea of energy as an entity. The author, however, 
points out that energy “does not have a separate existence. It does not spontaneously 
vanish at one place in the Universe and simultaneously appear at another” (ibid. 
p. 571). 
Dransfeld, Kienle and Kalvius write: 
“Energy can be neither produced nor destroyed but remains constant in every closed system. 
(Fact of experience!)”10 
This proposition concerns only the conservation of energy (no change in quantity). 
Further on, they include ‘transformation’: 
“Energy occurs in various forms, such as gravitational energy, kinetic energy, thermal 
energy, elastic energy, electrical energy, magnetic energy, chemical energy, nuclear energy, 
and radiant energy. In the processes taking place in nature, one form of energy is always 
transformed into another, but the sum of the component energies remains constant”11 
In Sears and Zemansky’s Physics, Young and Freedman present the law of 
conservation of energy as follows: 
“energy is never created or destroyed; it only changes form”. (Young & Freedman, 2004, 
p. 264) 
Çengel and Ghajar introduce the principle in this same way: 
“Energy can neither be created nor destroyed during a process; it can only change forms”. 
(Çengel & Ghajar, 2015, p. 11) 
5.1.3.1
Historical Connection 
The most common formulation of the principle of conservation of energy originates 
in Mayer’s 1842 paper (Sect. 2.1.1.1). Two points, however, are important to note. 
First, what was taken from Mayer are the properties of force—indestructibility and 
transformability—and not the principle he formulated: “In all physical and chem-
ical processes, the given force remains a constant magnitude” (Mayer, 1845, p. 32). 
Second, today’s formulation can mislead us to think of energy as substantial, whereas 
Mayer pointed out that force (energy) is not material. According to him, indestruc-
tibility concerns only the quantity of force and transformability was not designed to 
convey knowledge about the phenomena beyond what is observable (Sect. 2.1.2).
10 “Energie kann weder erzeugt noch vernichtet werden, sondern bleibt in jedem abgeschlossenen 
System konstant. (Erfahrungstatsache!)”. (Dransfeld et al., p. 109) 
11 “Energie kommt in verschiedenen Formen vor, wie z.B. als Gravitationsenergie, kinetische 
Energie, Wärmeenergie, elastische, elektrische, magnetische, chemische Energie, Kernenergie und 
Strahlungsenergie. Bei den in der Natur ablaufenden Prozessen wird immer eine Energieform in 
eine andere umgewandelt, wobei jedoch die Summe der Einzelenergien konstant bleibt”. (ibid. 
p. 109)

5.1.4 
First Law of Thermodynamics 
Tipler and Mosca formulate the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics, which they consider as 
“a statement of the conservation of energy”, as follows: 
“The change in the internal energy of the system equals the heat transferred into the system 
plus the work done on the system”. (Tipler & Mosca, 2004, p. 566)12 
The law is coupled with a remark regarding the use of the terms work and heat: 
“It is correct to say that a system has a large amount of internal energy, but it is not correct 
to say that a system has a large amount of heat or a large amount of work”. (ibid. p. 567) 
Some authors explain what internal energy consists of: 
“Internal energy U is the energy associated with the microscopic components of a system – 
the atoms and molecules of the system”. (Faughn et al., 2006, p. 253) 
“The internal energy of a substance is the sum of the molecular kinetic energy […], the 
molecular potential energy […] and other kinds of molecular energy”. (Cutnell & Johnson, 
2006, p. 243) 
Nevertheless, according to Chabay, Sherwood and Titus, 
“internal energy is a convenient catch-all term that denotes “forms of energy that we choose 
not to analyze in detail at the moment,” and not a fundamental form of energy”. (Chabay 
et al., 2019, p. 507) 
Hecht points out that “Internal energy cannot be observed; it cannot be measured 
as it presumably exists.” (Hecht, 2019, p. 500). 
5.1.4.1
Historical Connection 
In reorganizing the theory of heat, Clausius assumed the validity of the mechanical 
equivalence of heat. This becomes its ﬁrst law of thermodynamics. In the contem-
porary formulation of this law, the mechanical equivalent is only presupposed. The 
content of the law is given by means of the internal energy, which refers to Thomson’s 
mechanical energy of a body.13 
Thomson was interested in knowing the total amount of energy in a body. Since 
this was not possible, he deﬁned the mechanical energy of a body in relation to 
a standard state (Sect. 3.2). Maxwell called it ‘intrinsic energy’ (Sect. 3.6). This 
adjective clearly refers to the interior of the body. Contemporary authors keep the 
idea of the interior of the body, with the term internal energy. Whereas Thomson 
assumed that heat exists in a body, contemporary authors keep the word ‘heat’ for 
the relationship with the surroundings:
12 Similar formulations of the ﬁrst law can be found in other modern physicists (Kane & Sternheim, 
1988, p. 262; Halliday et al., 1997, p. 467; Wilson & Buffa, 1997, p. 386). 
13 ‘Mechanical energy’ refers nowadays to the sum of kinetic and potential energy in Mechanics. 
Some physicists also use the concept ‘principle of conservation of mechanical energy’ (Halliday 
et al., 1997, p. 160–161; Buffa & Wilson, 1997, p. 150; Serway & Beichner, 2000, p. 215). 

5.2 Concepts of Energy
121
“it is not correct to say that a substance contains heat. The substance has internal energy, 
not heat. The word “heat” is used only when referring to the energy actually in transit from 
hot to cold”. (Cutnell & Johnson, 2006, p. 243) 
The idea of energy in transit has nothing to do with Thomson.14 It refers to Lodge’s 
claim that energy is transferred between bodies or between bodies and the aether. 
The contemporary equation of the law is
normal u pper D elt
a upper E Subscript i n t Baseline equals upper Q Subscript i n Baseline plus upper W Subscript o n
where Eint refers to internal energy, Q to heat and W to work. (Tipler & Mosca, 
2004, p. 566) This goes back to Thomson and Clausius. The variation in Thomson’s 
mechanical energy is given as 
d e e q u al s
 upper J upper Q minus upper W
where J stands for the mechanical equivalent of heat (Sect. 3.2). Clausius said that 
this energy corresponds to his function U.15 This function is given as U = the heat 
existing in the body + the internal work. (Clausius, 1879, p. 27, eq. II; p. 31, Eq. 3) 
It appears in his equation (ibid. p. 31, eq. III) 
d up er Q eq
uals d upper U plus d upper W
where dQ stands for an indeﬁnitely small quantity of heat imparted to the body and 
W for work. 
5.2 
Concepts of Energy 
Some textbooks present the principle of conservation but do not an explicit deﬁnition 
of energy. Others deﬁne energy; and still others claim that we do not know what 
energy is. The concepts will be addressed in this order. 
5.2.1 
Indestructible and Transformable 
The principle that states that energy cannot be created or destroyed but only trans-
formed provides us with the properties of energy. Energy is that something which
14 Thomson could not agree with this meaning for the concept he had introduced (see Smith, 1998, 
p. 289). 
15 “The function U, ﬁrst introduced by the author in the above-mentioned paper [Clausius 1850], 
has been since adopted by other writers on Heat […] Thomson, in his paper of 1851 called it the 
mechanical energy of a body in a given state”. (Clausius 1879, p. 31)

is uncreatable, indestructible and transformable. Some physicists understand energy 
as a real entity with these properties (Sect. 5.1.3). Others have been careful to point 
out, however, that energy is not an entity (Feynman et al., 1963; Hudson & Nelson, 
1982; Hecht, 2000, among others). 
The authors who assume that energy is transformable, use the concept ‘forms of 
energy’ in the interpretation of phenomena. According to them, heat is a form of 
energy. 
Heat as a Form of Energy 
‘Transformation’ means change of form. Therefore, what appears at the beginning 
of a transformation of energy and at the end must be forms of energy. If motion gives 
rise to heat, for example, motion and heat are consequently forms of energy. There 
is, therefore, a conceptual reason to take heat as a form of energy. 
Nolting (2002) presents the idea concisely: “Heat” = “form of energy” (Nolting, 
2002 p. 148).16 The same idea appears in other textbooks: Hund (1956),17 Aktins 
(1986),18 Hänsel and Neumann (1993),19 Benenson et al. (2001)20 and Böge and 
Eichler (2002).21 
Cassiday, Holton and Rutherford show the link between ‘transformation’ and 
‘form’ of energy: 
“The disappearence of kinetic energy […] is accompanied by the appearance of heat. This  
suggests, though by no means proves, that the kinetic energy […] was transformed into heat. 
If so, heat must be one form of energy”. (Cassiday et al., 2002, p. 253) 
Criticism 
Some physicists criticize the concept of heat as a form of energy or simply adopt 
another solution. According to Allen and Maxwell (1962), who still used the principle 
of equivalence, heat as a form of energy was just a hypothesis. 
“When such an exact relation between mechanical energy and heat has been established by 
experiment, it is not difﬁcult to take a further step by introducing the hypothesis that heat 
is itself a form of energy, so that in the exchanges considered there is a transmutation from 
one form of energy to another”. (Allen & Maxwell, 1962, p. 285)
16 “Ein wesentlicher Bestandteil des Ersten Hauptsatzes ist deshalb die Aussage: “Wärme” = 
Energieform”. (Nolting, 2002, p. 148) 
17 “Die genauere Untersuchung dieser Erscheinungen führte zu der Ansicht, daß Wärme eine 
Energieform sei. Zunächst führte sie zu der Ansicht, Wärme sei Bewegung der kleinsten Teile 
der Körper und damit eine Form von Bewegungsenergie (F. Mohr 1837); später zu der Ansicht, 
Wärme sei eine Form der Energie […] (R. Mayer 1842)”. (Hund, 1956, pp. 49–50) 
18 “Wärme ist eine Form von Energie”. (Aktins, 1986, p. 233) 
19 “Robert Mayer erkannte als erster (1842), daß die Wärmemenge eine Form der Energie ist”. 
(Hänsel & Neumann, 1993, p. 222) 
20 “Heat is a particular form of energy connected with the temperature increase of a substance”. 
(Benenson et al., 2001, p. 678). 
21 “Wärme ist eine Energieform”. (Böge & Eichler, 2002, p. 83) 

5.2 Concepts of Energy
123
In Bergmann and Schaefer’s Experimental Physics (1998), the term ‘forms of 
energy’ is taken as somewhat misleading. They explain: the different ‘manifestations’ 
or ‘types’ of energy originate from different ways in which it is transported (work, 
heat, radiation) or it is associated with matter (kinetic, potential, chemical, electrical, 
etc. energy).22 
5.2.1.1
Historical Connection 
The divergence between physicists about the question of whether energy is a 
substance or not appeared in the nineteenth century. Planck had expected that the 
concept of energy as a substance would one day be overcome and Hertz argued that 
this concept is logically unacceptable. Nevertheless, Lodge and Ostwald claimed 
that energy is something real. 
The concept ‘forms of energy’ comes from Mayer’s forms of force. In 1845, he 
presents 5 forms of force and points out the 25 transformations with these forms: 
20 are transformations between different forms, as motion into heat, and 5 are 
transformations of the same form like motion into motion (Sect. 2.1.2). 
5.2.2 
Energy Transfer 
Preston tells us that energy moves through space and the aether was postulated to 
serve as a vehicle for energy. 
“Energy is again often stated to be only associated with matter, so that matter has been 
deﬁned as the vehicle of energy; this, however, does not hold according to our limitation 
of the word matter, for we know that energy in immense quantities is perpetually passing 
through space with the velocity of light [...] The ether, then, is the great vehicle of energy; 
and, indeed, it is chieﬂy on this account that the ether has been postulated”. (Preston, 1919, 
p. 80) 
Phenomena such as throwing a body in the air or the motion of a pendulum are 
seen as energy exchanges between bodies and the ether 
“An evident reply to the question of what becomes of the motion of a projectile rising 
upwards is that it passes into the ether. […] The oscillation from kinetic to potential, and 
from potential to kinetic, in the case of the pendulum is then, from this point of view, merely 
an interchange of energy of motion going on between the mass of the pendulum and the 
ether around it. […] The oscillation of energy, then, is from ether to matter, and from matter 
to ether, and on this oscillation all the physical life of the universe depends”. (ibid. p. 88)
22 “Es gibt im Grunde nur eine wohldeﬁnierte Größe Energie, die in einem Körper oder in einem 
Raumbereich vorhanden ist. Verschiedene “Erscheinungsformen” oder “Arten” dieser Energie 
beruhen entweder auf der unterschiedlichen Art und Weise, wie sie transportiert wird (Arbeit, 
Wärme, Strahlung) oder auf den verschiedenen Möglichkeiten, wie sie mit Materie verbunden sein 
kann (kinetische, potentielle, chemische, elektrische usw. Energie). Es ist daher etwas irreführend, 
von verschiedenen Energieformen zu sprechen, wie es oft geschieht. Denn es handelt sich immer nur 
um verschiedene Erscheinungsformen ein und derselben Größe Energie”. (Bergmann & Schaefer, 
1998, p. 136)

Trends in Contemporary Textbooks
In Westphal’s Physics, 26th edition, energy is distinguished from work because 
energy describes a state, whereas work refers to an event in time.23 According to 
Keller, Gettys and Skove (1993), work and heat are transferred energies: 
“Heat is energy transferred between a system and its environment because of a temperature 
difference between them [...] Work is energy transferred between a system and its environ-
ment by means independent of the temperature difference between them”. (Keller et al., 
1993, p. 423) 
Cutnell and Johnson (1997) understand heat as energy in motion: 
“Deﬁnition of Heat 
Heat is energy that ﬂows from a higher-temperature object to a lower-temperature object 
because of the difference in temperatures”. (Cutnell & Johnson, 1997, p. 359) 
According to Bergmann and Schaefer, energy and work are distinguished as 
follows: work is spoken of if energy is transported; energy is used if it is not in motion 
or is bound to a moving body.24 Breithaupt states that energy can be transferred from 
one body to another by two methods, heat and work: 
1. 
Work is energy transferred by means of a force moving its point of application. 
2. 
Heat is energy transferred by means other than a force. A temperature difference is 
said to exist between two bodies if heat transfer between the two bodies could occur 
(Breithaupt, 1999, p. 376). 
Tipler understands heat as energy that passes from one body to another.25 Çengel 
and Boles deﬁne heat as a form of energy that is transferred between two systems.26 
These authors associate work and heat with processes and energy with state.27 This 
has a consequence: “Systems possess energy, but not heat or work” (Çengel & Boles, 
2002, p. 127). According to Serway, heat is the transfer of energy between a system 
and its environment due to a difference in temperature (Faughn et al., 2006, p. 353). 
Halliday, Resnick and Walker also understand work as energy that is transferred. 
They highlighted, however, that this transfer is not to be understood as something 
material that went from one body to another.28 They explain the meaning of transfer
23 “Energie beschreibt einen Zustand, Arbeit ist ein zeitlich ablaufender Vorgang”. (Westphal, 1970, 
p. 39) 
24 “Der Begriff der Energie ist keineswegs nur ein anderes Wort für Arbeit. Erst wenn Energie in 
ganz bestimmter Weise transportiert wird, sprechen wir von Arbeit. Wenn sie dagegen ruht oder 
mit einem bewegten Körper fest verbunden ist, nennen wir sie schlicht Energie”. (Bergmann & 
Schaefer, 1998, p. 136) 
25 “Wärme ist die Energie, die von einem Körper auf einen anderen aufgrund einer Temperaturdif-
ferenz übergeht”. (Tipler, 2000, p. 539) 
26 “Heat is deﬁned as the form of energy that is transferred between two systems (or a system and 
its surroundings) by virtue of a temperature difference”. (Çengel & Boles, 2002, p. 124) 
27 “Both are associated with a process, not a state”. (ibid. p. 127) 
28 ““Arbeit” ist also Energie, die übertragen wird […] Der Begriff “übertragen” kann auch 
irreführend sein. Er bedeutet nicht, dass etwas Materielles in das Objekt hinein oder aus dem Objekt 
herausﬂießt; diese Energieübertragung darf man sich also nicht wie ﬂießendes Wasser vorstellen. 
Sie entspricht vielmehr dem elektronischen Geldtransfer zwischen zwei Bankkonten: Die Zahl in

through an electronic bank transfer. Therefore, according to this explanation, there 
is no real thing in motion. 
5.2.2.1
Historical Connection 
Lodge introduced the idea that energy is possessed by bodies and the aether and is 
transferred between them when there are events, such as the falling of a stone or 
the pendulum motion. Thus, we have energy at rest—possessed by bodies and the 
aether—and energy in motion—when it is transferred between bodies or between 
bodies and the aether. (This is the concept used by Preston.) As we have just seen 
above, some physicists have linked the term ‘energy’ with energy at rest (Lodge’s 
possession of energy by bodies) and ‘work’ and ‘heat’ with energy in motion (Lodge’s 
energy transfer). Halliday, Resnick and Walker also understand work as energy that 
is transferred but not in Lodge’s sense. 
5.2.3 
Capacity of Doing Work 
The deﬁnition of energy in the strict sense of the term deﬁnition that appears in 
textbooks tells us that energy is the capacity to do work or is the capacity that a body 
has to do work. 
In Voigt’s Thermodynamics, energy is understood as the body’s capacity to do 
work.29 Westphal deﬁnes energy as the capacity of doing work.30 Breithaupt uses 
the two deﬁnitions mentioned above: ﬁrst, 
“Energy is deﬁned as the capacity to do work”. (Breithaupt, 1999, p. 157) 
and later in the book, 
“Energy is the capacity of a body to do work”. (ibid. p. 376) 
According to Tipler, the concept of energy describes the capacity to do work.31 
Serway and Beichner understand energy as the capacity that a body has for performing 
work (Serway & Beichner, 2000, p. 183). 
This deﬁnition of energy has been criticized for decades.32 
dem einen Konto steigt an, während die Zahl in dem anderen Konto kleiner wird, obwohl zwischen 
den beiden Konten kein materieller Gegenstand ausgetauscht wird”. (Halliday et al., 2003, p. 154)
29 “Entzieht man dem Körper die an ihm aufgewandte und in der ursprünglichen Form verschwun-
dene Arbeit oder Wärme nicht in Form von Wärme oder Arbeit, so kommt sie eben der 
Arbeitsfähigkeit, der Energie des Körpers zu gute”. (Voigt, 1903, p. 78) 
30 “Da Energie Arbeitsfähigkeit, also latente, aufgespeicherte Arbeit ist, so messen wir sie in den 
gleichen Einheiten wie die Arbeit”. (Westphal, 1970, p. 39) 
31 “Der Begriff der Energie […] beschreibt die Fähigkeit, Arbeit zu verrichten”. (Tipler, 2000, 
p. 129)

5.2.3.1
Historical Connection 
The deﬁnition of energy through ‘capacity of doing work ‘ originates from Rankine. 
He wrote: 
“The term “energy” comprehends every state of a substance which constitutes a capacity for 
performing work”. (Rankine, 1855, p. 217) 
As Rankine’s concept of substance means a body or a set of bodies, the term energy 
refers to any state of a body in which it has this capacity. In contemporary textbooks, 
it is usually stated that ‘energy is the capacity to do work’. In this formulation, energy 
is the subject of the sentence, which may lead to the idea that energy has the capacity 
to do work. This wording, in turn, can lead one to think that energy is something 
real. 
5.2.4 
It Is not Known What Energy Is 
In his Lectures, Feynman drew his students’ attention to the following: “in physics 
today we have no knowledge of what energy is” (Feynman et al., 1963, Sect. 4.1). 
Keller, Gettys and Skove begin the chapter on the conservation of energy with three 
quotes where one is from Poincaré and one from Feynman. The latter has just been 
presented. The former tells us. 
“As we cannot give a general deﬁnition of energy, the principle of the conservation of energy 
simply signiﬁes that there is something which remains constant”. (Keller et al., 1993, p. 194) 
In Bergmann and Schaefer’s Experimental Physics, one reads “nobody knows, 
what energy really is”. They add, “The physicist is almost in the same dilemma as 
the layman”.33 Hecht writes: “there is no completely satisfactory deﬁnition of energy” 
(Hecht, 2000, p. 222). Nevertheless, he points out “energy is not an entity in and 
of itself – there is no such thing as pure energy”. (ibid. p. 223). Dransfeld, Kienle 
and Kalvius introduce the principle of energy conservation and ask the question 
“What actually is energy?” They answer: “we cannot answer it”.34 Çengel and Boles 
deﬁne thermodynamics as the science of energy.35 However the authors point out the 
difﬁculty in deﬁning energy: 
“Although everybody has a feeling of what energy is, it is difﬁcult to give a precise deﬁnition 
for it. Energy can be viewed as the ability to cause changes”. (Çengel & Boles, 2002, p. 2)
33 “Deﬁnition der Energie. Dabei stoßen wir gleich auf eine Schwierigkeit: Niemand weiß, was 
Energie wirklich ist. Der Physiker beﬁndet sich dabei fast im selben Dilemma wie der Laie”. 
(Bergmann and Schaefer 1998, p. 135) 
34 “Hier stellt sich die Frage “Was ist eigentlich Energie?” Doch wir können sie, ähnlich der nach 
dem Wesen der Kraft, nicht beantworten”. (Dransfeld et al., 2001, p. 109)

Halliday, Resnick and Walker point out the difﬁculty in deﬁning energy.36 
5.2.4.1
Historical Connection 
The prize competition of the Göttingen Philosophical Faculty, for which Planck wrote 
the book The Principle of Conservation of Energy, aimed at clarifying the concept of 
energy. It was precisely on this point that Planck failed. He gave no solution for how 
to understand the concept, but simply expected that the concept of his time would one 
day be overcome. Hertz was clearly saying that energetics was not advanced enough 
to deﬁne energy. Poincaré had two criticisms. He claims that it is impossible to give a 
deﬁnition of energy. He explains that this is impossible because we are unable to ﬁnd 
a deﬁnition that encompasses all energy forms.37 He also claims that the conservation 
principle holds, if one can sort energy into kinetic, potential and internal energy. If 
this sorting is not possible (he provides examples of this impossibility), the principle 
just tells us that something is conserved in nature. This is tautological, he concludes, 
because if there are laws of nature, something is conserved.38 
5.3 
Mayer’s and Joule’s Equivalents in Textbooks 
Some textbook writers refer to Mayer and Joule. The reasons for mentioning Mayer 
are that heat is a form of energy, the principle of conservation of energy and the 
determination of the mechanical equivalent of heat.39 The reasons for mentioning 
Joule are the mechanical equivalent of heat and his paddle wheel experiment, which 
is often illustrated. These illustrations differ, however, from each other.
36 “In der Tat ist der Begriff der Energie so weit gefasst, dass eine einfache Deﬁnition nur sehr 
schwer zu geben ist. Zunächst einmal ist Energie eine skalare Größe, die mit dem Zustand eines 
oder mehrerer Objekte in Zusammenhang steht. Diese Deﬁnition ist jedoch zu vage, als dass sie 
eine echte Hilfe sein könnte”. (Halliday, 2003, p. 152) 
37 “Nous connaissons beaucoup de formes de l’énergie, et rien ne nous prouve qu’il n’y en ait pas 
beaucoup d’autres qui nous sont inconnues. Dans chaque cas particulier, on voit bien ce que c’est 
l’énergie; mais il est impossible d’en trouver une déﬁnition générale”. (Poincaré, 1901, p. 488) 
38 “Il ne nous reste plus qu’un énoncé pour le principe de la conservation de l’énergie; il y a 
quelque chose qui demeure constant. Sous cette forme, il se trouve à son tour hors des atteintes de 
l’expérience et se réduit à une sorte de tautologie”. (Poincaré, 1897, p. 739)

Fig. 5.1 Replica of the paddle wheel and the container in which the paddles rotate 
5.3.1 
The Paddle Wheel Experiment 
Eisberg and Lerner (1983, p. 406) reproduced the original ﬁgure of the paddle wheel 
experiment (Joule, 1850). Hecht did not present the original ﬁgure, but his schema 
of the apparatus is conform to Joule’s illustration (Figs. 2.14 and 2.15). Other illus-
trations differ from Joule’s. To deal with this issue, I will start by showing a replica 
of Joule’s, 1850 paddle wheel (Fig. 5.1). 
In some illustrations in textbooks, the container appears without the internal obsta-
cles. (Tipler & Mosca, 2004, p. 565; Serway & Beichner, 2000, p. 605) The paddles 
are also depicted as rectangular surfaces. The idea is that these surfaces push the 
water, when they rotate, and the water becomes warmer due to this motion. Now 
Joule’s paddles are not that shape. These push the water but allow the water to 
collide with obstacles solidly attached to the walls of the container, as shown in the 
photo. 
This begs the question, what happens if we remove these obstacles from the recip-
ient? The difference is this. In Joule’s machine, the bodies that set the paddle wheel 
in motion fall with constant velocity (Fig. 5.2). In the machine without obstacles, 
the falling motion is accelerated (Fig. 5.3). This has the following consequence. The 
weight of the bodies in the Joule machine when in motion is equal to the weight of 
the bodies at rest, i.e., before the phenomenon takes place. The weight of the bodies 
in the other machines when in motion, is less than the weight of the bodies at rest. 
Now, the magnitude ‘weight times height’ is decisive for the amount of heat that 
machines produce. Joule used the weight of bodies in the laboratory to calculate the 
mechanical equivalent of heat. This weight is equal to the weight of the bodies as 
they drive the rotation of the axis that sets the paddles in motion. In other machines, 
this is not the case; the weight in motion is lower. There is, therefore, a signiﬁcant

Fig. 5.2 This graph displays the result of a typical run of the experiment: the proper acceleration of 
the bodies as a function of time. The machine was kept at rest for about 0.8 s and released at some 
instant between 0.7 and 0.9 s. The experimental points in the interval ~ 0.8 to 3 s correspond to 
motion. The dispersion of the data points during motion is a characteristic trend observed in all runs 
of the experiment. Despite this behavior (also caused by oscillations of the axis of the apparatus), the 
average acceleration measured during motion by the accelerometer is conform with the acceleration 
at rest. The present and the following experiments used the accelerometers incorporated in the Pasco 
Scientiﬁc Smart Carts (ME-1240 and ME-1241). The data recorded by the accelerometer sensor is 
communicated to a PC, equipped with the Capstone software, by Bluetooth

Krebs’ schema of Joule’s machine (Fig. 5.6) presents only two paddles.
In 1878, Joule performed a new determination of the mechanical equivalent of the 
heat through the paddle wheel mechanism (Fig. 5.7). The container is smaller than 
in the 1850 experiment and the number of paddles is also reduced. The result is not 
signiﬁcantly different from the 1850 result.
In 1879, Rowland performed a new determination of the mechanical equivalent 
of heat by means of a paddle wheel experiment. The idea is Joule’s in the sense that 
the temperature difference of the water due to friction by the movement of a paddle 
wheel is measured. The main difference with regard to Joule’s apparatus is that the 
friction has been optimized, i.e., the friction is not only due to the water hitting the 
internal parts (solidly connected to the container) but is also due to the water passing 
through small holes in these internal parts as well as in the paddles (Fig. 5.8). The 
value of the mechanical equivalent of heat is slightly higher than Joule’s.

Conclusion 
Some physicists took the equivalence between heat and work as a principle, the 
principle of equivalence. This proposition consists of an induction: it generalizes 
an experimental result, the mechanical equivalent of heat. This principle has the 
particularity of expressing the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics without using the concept 
of energy, which is why it was preferred by some physicists. 
The impossibility of a perpetuum mobile dates back to a resolution of the Paris 
Academy of Sciences in 1775, which did not play any role in the idea of conserva-
tion in the 1840s. On the contrary, the assumption of conservation was taken as a 
(theoretical) justiﬁcation for the impossibility of a perpetuum mobile. 
The common formulation of the principle of conservation of energy goes back to 
Mayer’s characteristics of force: indestructibility and transformability. The meaning 
of these characteristics has, however, changed in the course of time. Some physicists 
have taken energy to be an indestructible substance. Others, however, have high-
lighted that energy is not a substance. Such a divergence had already taken place in 
the nineteenth century. 
The formulation of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamic through the concept of internal 
energy of a body goes back to Thomson’s mechanical energy. It was this concept 
that opened the door to the idea that energy exists in a body. The distinction between 
what concerns to the body and the surroundings, highlighted in textbooks, no longer 
comes from Thomson, but rather from Lodge. Contemporary textbooks take heat as

transferred energy (Lodge’s concept) and point out that the body has no heat, whereas 
Thomson admitted that a body has heat. 
Depending on whether the authors use Mayer’s properties of energy or Lodge’s 
concept, they characterize heat as a form of energy or as energy transfer. Some 
authors use both ways, saying that heat is a form of energy and is transferred between 
systems. Beyond these concepts of energy, there is an explicit deﬁnition of it in some 
textbooks: energy is the ability to do work, which goes back to Rankine. Finally, 
there is a set of authors who argue that we do not know what energy is. 
The overview of textbooks in this chapter raises some questions: 
1. Some authors deﬁne energy, whereas others claim that we do not know what it is. 
Now, we might think that if we do not know what it is, we cannot deﬁne it. On the 
other hand, if the deﬁnition holds, there is no reason to say that we do not know 
what it is. It turns out that none of the textbook writers who claim that we do not 
know what energy is, show us where the deﬁnition of energy fails. Likewise, none 
of those who deﬁne energy show us that the others have missed something in the 
deﬁnition, which is why they do not accept it. This topic—energy is deﬁned, on 
the one hand, and no clue to a deﬁnition, on the other—leads to the question of 
why the concept of energy leads to such contrary views. 
2. Some authors teach that energy is neither created nor destroyed and understand 
that an entity with these characteristics exists. Other physicists deny that such a 
substance exists. We understand that at least one of these theses is false. What is 
the reason for such a divergence, which has persisted for over a century? 
3. The common formulation of the principle of the conservation of energy and the 
formulation of the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics through the concept of internal 
energy are based on the concept of energy. The principle of equivalence expresses 
the same relationship between heat and work without using ‘energy’. One asks 
then the question of whether energy is really necessary. 
These issues will be clariﬁed in the next chapter.

Chapter 6 
Conclusion 
The ﬁnal chapter brings together the results of this study and provides the answer 
to the book’s question, what is energy? The chapter begins with an overview of the 
evolution of the concept. The way in which the concept has changed over time and 
the diversity in contemporary times lead us to ask the question of whether there is 
something that cannot be changed, that is necessary to the concept. Two necessary 
conditions are then determined. Therefore, a concept that does not satisfy one of 
them cannot be an energy concept. In the next step, we arrive at an understanding of 
the concept of energy. Based on this, the reasons for the problems with the concept 
are explained. These problems that have arisen since the nineteenth century are thus 
overcome. 
The caloric theory was the dominant theory until the mechanical equivalent of heat 
was accepted. Berthollet, Haldat, Carnot, Clapeyron, among others, argued that the 
amount of heat remains constant in nature. This idea was based on experimental work 
(Gay-Lussac, Berthollet, Dulong, Delaroche, Bérard, among many others). Rumford 
and Davy, however, argued that heat is motion. This concept of heat was based on 
experiments, in which the quantity of heat varies with motion (Table 6.1). The answer 
to the question of whether heat is a substance or a kind of motion depends, therefore, 
on the answer to the question of whether or not the amount of heat is conserved 
(Appendix A).
Joule showed experimentally that the quantity of heat does change and deter-
mined the mechanical equivalent of heat. He took this ﬁnding as a new argument 
against the heat-substance theory. He claimed then that heat is motion. This thesis 
about the nature of heat is an interpretation of his experimental result; as ‘heat is a 
substance’ was an interpretation of certain experiments. Indeed, neither Berthollet, 
Haldat, Carnot, Clapeyron observed the heat-substance nor Rumford, Davy, Mohr, 
Joule observed the motion of which heat should consist. Whereas Joule took a posi-
tion about the nature of heat within the framework of the heat theory of the time, 
Mayer developed his own theory. Within the framework of this theory, heat is a form 
of force. Mayer was aware, however, that he was saying nothing about the nature of

heat. Heat being a form of force was, therefore, also an interpretation of phenomena 
(Table 6.2). 
These two aspects provide us with an insight regarding the incompatibility 
between Carnot’s theory and Joule’s experiments. Thomson recognized the value 
of Joule’s experiments but he did not accept his thesis on the nature of heat because 
it contradicted Carnot’s axiom, heat is a substance (conceptual component). Clausius 
overcame this incompatibility. He argued that to eliminate the concept of heat as a 
substance, it is sufﬁcient to prove that the amount of heat varies. (This concerns 
the experimental basis of the thesis ‘heat is a substance’.) The variation of the heat 
quantity had been demonstrated by the experiments in which motion gives rise to 
heat, said Clausius based on Joule’s experiments. Therefore, heat could not be a 
substance. From the dilemma of the time (either substance or motion), it followed 
that heat is motion. If heat is motion, the question of what kind of motion is heat, 
follows. Clausius was not interested in this question. (This concerns the conceptual 
component.) It was enough for him that heat could be thought of as motion [From 
this compatibilization arose the two laws of thermodynamics (Sect. 3.1)]. 
Thomson embraces the dynamic theory of heat in the following year. Within the 
framework of this theory, he introduces the term mechanical energy into the scientiﬁc 
vocabulary. He deﬁnes the mechanical energy of a body in a given state. This concept 
was not created to be applied to phenomena. It is, for example, meaningless to speak 
of ‘energy transformation’, energy being Thomson’s mechanical energy. Thomson’s 
concept refers to a pre-phenomenon situation, more exactly, what a body has as 
a reserve of work. It is, therefore, a concept that tells us how much work we can 
count on in a possible event. To account for this quantity, we need the mechanical 
equivalent of heat and to choose a standard state. This role of the equivalent is also 
clear in Thomson’s mathematical expression of the mechanical energy (Sect. 3.2). 
We can see then that the discovery of the mechanical equivalent of heat was necessary 
to Thomson’s mechanical energy. 
At the same time, Thomson claims that a body loses work if it does work on other 
bodies (i.e., in the case that a phenomenon takes place) and that the quantity of work 
it loses is the same that the surroundings gain. Admitting this, Thomson presupposes 
that the quantity of mechanical energy considering the system body-surroundings 
remains constant. This means that the quantity of work in this system is conserved.

Conclusion
139
In sum, the term energy introduced by Thomson refers to the work reserve of a body, 
uses the mechanical equivalent of heat and presupposes the conservation of energy. 
Based on Thomson’s concept of mechanical energy, Rankine developed the 
concept of energy as the capacity of a body of doing work. This concept retains the 
original idea: energy is something that concerns a possible event. Rankine does more. 
He alters Thomson’s stores of mechanical energy. A stone at a certain height from 
the ground represents a reserve of mechanical energy of the static kind, according to 
Thomson. With Rankine, it is potential energy. If the stone starts to fall, we no longer 
have the reserve of the static kind. With Rankine, the stone has potential energy 
throughout the whole motion. Moreover, it decreases during the motion in the same 
proportion as the other energy increases. In this way, Thomson’s reserves, modiﬁed 
by Rankine, come to satisfy the conservation of energy. [This is the origin of the 
principle of conservation of energy in the form: the sum of the kinetic and potential 
energy is constant (Sects. 3.5–3.6)]. 
With this approach, we have now two types of energy forms, which are related 
to the two types of forms of force. Rankine’s energies conform to Helmholtz’s 
ultimate forces: tension force and living force. The living force concerns motion 
and the tension force concerns the tendency to motion. If one increases, the other 
decreases in the same proportion. This is Helmholtz’s idea of the conservation of 
force (Sect. 2.4.1). According to Mayer (Sect. 2.1.2), there are ﬁve forms of force. 
Thus, in the 1840s we have a conservation with two forms of force (Helmholtz) and 
a conservation with ﬁve forms (Mayer) (Sect. 2.4.3.1). This situation reappears in 
the energy conceptual framework thanks to Rankine’s modiﬁcation of Thomson’s 
kinds of mechanical energy. We found a consequence of this in Maxwell’s Theory 
of Heat. He presents two formulations of the principle of conservation of energy: in 
one, the forms of energy are kinetic and potential (Rankine’s forms); in the other, 
they are electric, magnetic, etc. (Mayer’s forms). Regarding the former, Maxwell 
notes that we cannot guarantee that the forms are only these two, but, he adds, 
we cannot conceive of others (Sect. 3.6). Now we can understand this through the 
mechanical origin of those forms: one form concerns motion; the other includes rest 
(Thomson’s dynamic and static kind of mechanical energy); we do not conceive of 
a third mechanical state beyond rest and motion. Hence, there is no third form of 
energy. 
The potential character of Thomson’s mechanical energy and Rankine’s energy— 
the capacity of a body of doing work—is criticized by Lodge (Sect. 4.1.1). He argues 
then that energy is a real, existing thing. As we have seen, this real thing did not 
come from any experimental detection of it. One realizes, however, that his concept 
of energy can explain two things: 
1. energy in a body 
2. energy in an event. 
The idea of energy in a body is justiﬁed by Lodge’s claim that energy is possessed 
by bodies and by the aether. In order to account for the energy in an event serves 
the idea that energy is transferred between them. Let us continue. Something that 
can stay at rest (in a body or in the aether) and can move (between them) has the

characteristics of a substance. Thus, we understand that energy was taken as a real 
existing thing. In sum, we understand that energy became a real existing thing to 
satisfy uses of the term ‘energy’: 
• the use of energy with regard to an event, which comes from Mayer, and 
• the use of the term with regard to a body, which comes from Thomson’s mechanical 
energy of a body. 
Lodge’s reiﬁcation of energy appears reinforced by Poynting’s paper on the 
transfer of energy in the electromagnetic ﬁeld, according to which energy moves 
through space. If energy moved through space, then the energy transfer thesis would 
be corroborated. Poynting himself pointed out, however, that there was no proof that 
energy moves through space.1 Despite this, Lodge developed the idea that energy has 
an identity (Sect. 4.1.3). This identity of energy does not come, therefore, from exper-
iments. His concept of energy satisﬁes, however, those requirements: to account for 
energy in a body and energy in events. Thus, we can conclude that Lodge’s concept 
comes from his efforts in shaping a concept of energy in line with the uses of the 
term. (This concept is the basis of the common idea ‘heat is transferred energy’.) 
Planck’s deﬁnition of energy generalizes the concept of mechanical equivalence 
(Sect. 4.2.1). This deﬁnition raises, however, the question of whether it is possible to 
obtain a mechanical equivalent with regard to any physical change. Planck proposes 
different means to achieve this goal and ends as follows: if it is not possible to express 
a physical change in mechanical terms in a certain case, the deﬁnition of energy is 
useless in that case. He was, however, able to overcome this difﬁculty through his 
ﬁrst formulation of the principle of conservation of energy (Sect. 4.2.1). The problem 
for which he had no solution was the location of energy. If energy is constant in a 
system and energy is something real, it should be somewhere in this system, says 
Planck. It is not possible to pinpoint the place of energy. Hence, Planck predicted 
that this concept will one day be surpassed. 
Starting in the 1860s, physicists appeared who used the concept ‘principle of 
equivalence’ to express the validity of the mechanical equivalent of heat.2 Some 
of these physicists were reluctant to use the properties of energy expressed in the 
principle of conservation. Müller and Pouillet (1926) even pointed out that ‘energy 
conservation’ was a postulate, whose basis was the mechanical equivalent. For these 
authors, it was clear that the basis of the principle of conservation of energy was the 
mechanical equivalent of heat. Thus, one can understand their choice: to generalize 
the mechanical equivalent of heat, which was an experimental result, instead of 
resorting to a concept that was postulated. 
What we have seen so far enables us to conclude the following. The mechan-
ical equivalent of heat is the experimental basis of Mayer’s theory, Joule’s thesis,
1 This proof is necessary, since the fact that an algorithm leads to correct predictions is not a sufﬁcient 
reason to assert that the image based on it corresponds to reality. Indeed, different algorithms can 
predict the same experimental result and lead to different images of the phenomenon at stake 
(Coelho, 2021).

(Thomson), the energy transfer between aether and bodies (Lodge) are elements of 
the theoretical constructions. This distinction between that which is experimental 
and that which is interpretation of experiments plays a heuristic role with regard to 
contemporary approaches. 
The common formulation of the principle of conservation of energy states: 
“energy can neither be created nor destroyed but only transformed”. 
This principle characterizes energy as uncreatable, indestructible and trans-
formable. What is energy if based on these characteristics? Energy can be trans-
formed. As transformation means change of form, it follows that what appears at 
the beginning and at the end of a transformation process are forms of energy. Only 
then can we say: one form is transformed into another. As these forms are observable 
(measurable), we can infer that the entity behind the forms is real. This being real 
is reinforced by the other properties of energy. If we are unable to destroy energy, it 
exists, since it does not make sense to be unable to destroy anything that does not 
exist. Furthermore, energy is independent of us since we cannot create it. Therefore, 
what we cannot destroy exists independently of us. The formulation of the energy 
principle presented above can lead us, therefore, to the concept of energy as a real 
existing thing.3 This interpretation has no basis on the author who created these 
characteristics of energy. 
Mayer’s concepts of indestructibility and transformability refer to force and not 
energy. Nevertheless, the term ‘force’ used by Mayer refers to magnitudes that were 
and still are subsumed by the term energy.4 Hence, it is legitimate to replace force 
by energy, where this reason holds. Substituting force by energy, we say, following 
Mayer, that energy is ‘indestructible’ and ‘transformable’. Therefore, ‘energy cannot 
be destroyed’ and ‘energy can be transformed’, which is what appears in the energy 
conservation principle. 
Indestructibility was abstracted from the following sequence (Table 6.3).
If the quantity of cause (A) is represented by A, of cause (B), by B and so on, 
we have that A = B = C = … From this sequence of equations Mayer concludes 
that cause is indestructible. Indestructible means, therefore, that the initial quantity 
holds along the chain. When he moves on to phenomena and ﬁnds that a causal 
relationship applies to a phenomenon, he uses the term force. Now he uses force for 
both members of the equation. Thus, the cause is called force and so is the effect

3 Actually, studies have shown that contemporary textbooks take energy as a kind of a substance 
and students understand energy as a substance (Appendix N). 
4 Mayer’s ‘force of fall’ corresponds to potential energy; the force called ‘motion’ to kinetic energy; 
heat, a form of force, has become a form of energy.

With regard to ‘cause = effect’, he only changed the names. He had said that the 
cause was indestructible due to the sequence A = B = C = …. Then, he can also say 
that force is indestructible, what he did. He still stresses that force is “quantitatively 
indestructible” (Sect. 2.1.1). Therefore, force is indestructible regarding its quantity. 
There is, therefore, no entity that we cannot destroy. 
Transformability comes also from the same idea that cause equals effect and 
expresses a property for causes. This property is also ascribed to force. Approaching 
phenomena, Mayer comes to the causal relationship between heat and motion, 
assuming that heat is produced by motion or disappears to produce motion

Is there a deep meaning of transformation? Mayer highlighted in different occa-
sions that transformation has no ontological meaning (for example, Mayer, 1845, 
p. 10, 1851, p. 43). In the energy principle, however, ‘transformability’ contributes 
to the reality of energy in the way we have seen. 
The third property of Mayer’s energy is ‘imponderability’. This property had 
a special meaning at that time. Light, heat, electricity and magnetism were called 
imponderables (Muncke, 1829; Suckow, 1813). Taking matter as ponderable and 
impenetrable, Mayer distinguishes it from force which is characterized by the oppo-
site (Appendix D). Furthermore, Mayer pointed out that force is immaterial and 
stressed that there is no ‘immaterial matter’ (Mayer, 1845, p. 36). Therefore, Mayer’s 
energy cannot be a substance. 
In sum, Mayer’s properties of energy—indestructible, transformable and imma-
terial—do not support the reading of the principle of conservation of energy that 
takes energy as something real, a kind of substance. (All this discussion concerns 
the conceptual component of the energy theory.) 
Mayer arrived at the equation 
0.000103 t h e r m a l u n i t s equals 3.77 m e c h a n i c a l u n i t s 
based on experimental data. From this equation, he calculated the mechanical 
equivalent of heat

He called both sides of the equation ‘force’. In this way, heat and motion, which 
were completely different from each other, became homogeneous. The conceptual 
homogenization was practiced by all four authors considered to be energy discov-
erers. Joule homogenized heat and motion through the concept of motion. He took 
heat as motion. Thus, instead of substance (heat) and motion, there are two kinds of 
motion. Both being motions, the equations of form 
alpha t h e r m a l u n i t s equals beta m e c h a n i c a l u n i t s
were justiﬁed. From these equations, he took the values of the mechanical equiva-
lent of heat (Sects. 2.2.1–2.2.3). Colding homogenized heat and motion through the 
concept ‘force of nature’. Heat and motion were forces of nature. As he admitted 
that forces of nature do not perish, he concluded that motion is transformed into heat 
(Sect. 2.3.1). Helmholtz homogenized heat and motion by means of the ultimate 
forces of nature: living force and tension force. Hence, these two forces exist in heat, 
as well as in electricity, electromagnetism, etc. (Sect. 2.4.1). 
Let us go back to Mayer to continue our analysis of the energy concept. Mayer 
homogenized heat and motion by means of force. As he called ‘force’ both sides of 
the equation, he could say that force is indestructible. Since indestructibility concerns 
quantity, he could and did conclude that force remains constant (Sect. 2.1.2.1). The 
term ‘force’ was replaced by ‘energy’. The properties of Mayer’s force were trans-
ferred to energy. ‘Energy’ is then the new name given to both sides of the equation 
cause = effect. As one side of the equation is called energy and the other side also, it 
can be said for the same reason as before that energy is conserved. The authors who 
used the equivalence principle did not homogenize heat and work (Sect. 5.1.1). They 
had no concept that subsumes these. Therefore, they also lacked the corresponding 
quantity: the one that would encompass the quantities heat and work. They lacked, 
therefore, the quantity to be conserved. For this reason, they were even prevented 
from talking about conservation. Conclusion: we need to assign the same name to 
heat and work to have a principle of conservation. Without that, we do not have the 
quantity to conserve. 
Mayer’s axiom tells us that the quantity remains constant in phenomena (“In all 
physical and chemical phenomena” Sect. 2.1.2.1). What is the basis of this constancy? 
He said he stirred water vehemently and the temperature of the water rose. To ﬁnd 
out whether the energy is conserved in this agitation of water, we need to measure 
the water temperature at the beginning and at the end of the agitation, determine the 
heat involved and the mechanical power employed. However, these values still do 
not tell us whether there was conservation. To know this, we need to know in advance 
which mechanical quantity corresponds to a unit of heat. Only then can we verify 
whether the measured values in the water agitation satisfy this proportion. Only if 
they satisfy, can we say there is conservation. Therefore, the mechanical equivalent 
of heat is a conditio sine qua non of energy conservation.

Conclusion
Conclusion: from what we have just seen and from what we saw before, it follows 
that to say that energy is conserved we need two things: 
1. that the mechanical equivalent of heat is valid 
2. that we give the same name ‘energy’ to both sides of the equation. 
The mechanical equivalent of heat is also the basis of the principle of equivalence. 
So, I will use it to clarify what is at stake: 
1 cal eq uals 4  
period 186 upper J
The equivalence principle uses this result by focusing on the equality. This equiva-
lence is not only valid for a small number of types of experiments but is general. This 
generality is expressed by the term ‘principle’ in ‘principle of equivalence’ (This is 
how Verdet and Poincaré demonstrate the principle, Sect. 5.1.1.1). An alternative 
to this approach is to homogenize the members of the equation. Doing so using 
“energy”, 1 cal is a quantity of energy and 4186 J is a quantity of energy.

The equality of the quantities of energy is guaranteed from the beginning by 
the initial Eq. (6.3). It then follows, going on to the phenomena, that the quantity 
referring to a given aspect of the phenomenon (heat) is equal to the quantity referring 
to the other aspect (work). Since the quantity in the ﬁrst phase of the phenomenon is 
equal to the quantity in the other phase of the phenomenon, we say that the quantity 
is conserved in that phenomenon. As this is true in general, ‘principle’ is used in 
‘principle of conservation of energy’. What does this principle say? If we want to say 
what this principle tells us from what we have said so far, then we say: this principle 
tells us that the quantity of energy is conserved in phenomena. (This is Mayer’s 
formulation of the principle (Sect. 2.1.2.1). It raises no ontological problems, as we 
have seen.) 
When it was assumed that energy is indestructible, uncreatable and transformable, 
the justiﬁcation of the principle shifted to this entity, as seen above (see also Sect. 2. 
1.2.1). In fact, an entity with these characteristics—it always exists in the same 
quantity and adapts to what we observe (due to transformability)—forces us to accept 
the principle in the sense that we realize that it must be true. That this entity ‘energy’ 
was the consequence of a substantialization of energy, (Sects. 4.1 and 4.3) had already 
been forgotten (Sect. 5.1.1). That this substantialization was possible because the 
equivalence (6.3) was homogenized by the term energy, had not been borne in mind. 
(As we have seen, without the use of the same name ‘energy’ in both members of 
the equivalence, there is no conserved quantity.) Thus, the principle of conservation 
of energy, which originally said nothing more than that—the quantity of energy is 
constant in natural phenomena—began to indicate properties of energy that justify 
the principle itself. When the question was asked, what is this that is neither created

nor destroyed, difﬁculties arose that have lasted for more than a century (Chaps. 1, 
4 and 5). 
Synoptically, we have the following: 
1. mechanical equivalent of heat (this was the foundation of the theories of Mayer, 
Joule, Thomson, etc.) 
2. Homogenization (assigning the same name to both members of the equivalence. 
If the members have the same name, the quantities are the same.) 
3. Formulation of the principle: the quantity of the homogenization remains constant 
(if this quantity is energy, then the principle states: the quantity of energy is 
conserved) 
4. Energy is a substance (the result of reiﬁcation processes) 
5. Contemporary formulation of the principle: energy is neither created nor 
destroyed, but only transformed or transferred. 
About 1 and 2: The mechanical equivalent of heat does not imply homogenization, 
because the equivalence principle expresses the equivalent without homogenization 
(Sect. 5.1.1). Originally, the ﬁrst law of thermodynamics also expressed the mechan-
ical equivalent of heat without homogenizing (Sect. 3.1). From this, we understand 
that homogenization is not necessary, but it is an option. 
About 2: Homogenization was achieved in various ways: Mayer, by force; Joule, 
by motion, etc., as seen above. It follows that the means of homogenization is also 
an option. 
About 3: The quantity resulting from homogenization remaining constant 
expresses the principle of conservation in Mayer’s formulation (Sect. 2.1.2.1). 
About 4: For energy to be a substance, the quantity had to be conserved. Without 
conservation of quantity, there would be no substance. (This is analogous to what 
happened with heat. Heat was a substance because the quantity was constant; when 
the quantity was found to vary, the thesis collapsed.) 
About 5: This formulation of the principle of conservation of energy dispenses 
with the mechanical equivalent of heat as a basis. The latter becomes a consequence 
of the existence of energy. 
Understanding the processes of homogenization and reiﬁcation of energy allows 
us to overcome the problems posed by physicists since the nineteenth century. 
Planck’s problem consisted of the following. Since the energy of an isolated 
system remains constant, the energy should be somewhere in the system, as it was 
understood as a substance. However, it is impossible to localise the energy in the 
system (Sect. 4.2.1). 
In fact, the energy-substance was never located. Now we know why it was not. 
When we go to the origin (Mayer’s force), we realize that force (later energy) was 
the name given to the two members of the equivalence. ‘Energy’ is a homogenizing 
term. (It is one of these terms since other homogenizations have been carried out.) 
Moreover, homogenization itself, whatever term is used, is not necessarily imposed, 
as the equivalence (6.3) can be interpreted without it (Sect. 5.1.1). Thus, we realize 
that energy is a conceptual product, not part of nature. It is therefore understandable

146

Conclusion
that it is impossible to locate it in a system where energy is conserved, which was 
Planck’s problem. 
Poincaré defended that “it is impossible to ﬁnd a general deﬁnition” of energy, 
for the following reason (Chap. 1). In each case of energy transformation, it was 
well known which energy forms were involved. Coming up with a concept of energy 
that encompassed all forms was, however, impossible (Chap. 1, Sect. 5.2.4.1). This 
conclusion provides an answer to the following question: from the phenomena in 
which the forms of energy are identiﬁed, can I arrive at what is common to all 
forms? If so, that would be energy. The question makes sense but has no solution. 
The reason is this. The ‘forms’ were created to overcome a difﬁculty in the theory 
itself. Mayer said that cause is equal to effect. The cause could be heat and the effect 
motion. However, heat and motion are different. Therefore, to say that they were 
the same was contrary to what was observed. With the transformability of force, 
the problem has been overcome: the core is the same (force/energy), with only one 
variation (the form is different). Therefore, “energy form” is not something that is 
abstracted from the phenomenon. 
When energy became a real, existing thing, forms of energy began to be understood 
as manifestations of this reality. Therefore, it would have made sense to study the 
forms of energy to understand what energy is. It turns out, however, that energy has 
been substantialized intellectually (Sects. 4.1 and 4.3). Consequently, energy as a 
substance only exists as a concept. Therefore, the forms of energy in phenomena— 
potential, kinetic, thermal, electrical, etc.—cannot lead us to the core of what they 
would be a manifestation of, because that core does not exist. Thus, Poincaré’s 
conclusion is understandable: based on the energy forms, it is impossible to arrive 
at a deﬁnition of energy. 
Feynman points out that in physics today we have no knowledge of what energy 
is’ (Chap. 1, Sect. 5.2.4). This statement presupposes that there should be knowledge 
of what energy is by means of physics. But are the means of physics adequate to 
achieve this knowledge? Bergmann and Schaefer said that the physicist is almost in 
the same dilemma as the layman when it comes to the question of what energy is 
(Sect. 5.2.4). This shows that these authors could not ﬁnd the appropriate means in 
physics to deal with this question. In fact, the determination of the equivalent is a 
physical issue but the interpretation of the members of the equivalence that emerged 
in the nineteenth century is no longer. The process of substantializing energy that 
emerged at the end of the nineteenth century is not the subject of any chapter in 
physics. The fact that the principle of conservation of energy was replaced by the 
equivalence principle by some physicists and that the latter represents, therefore, an 
alternative to the former, is not known in physics today. If what could have led us to 
an understanding of energy is not part of physics, it is understandable that there is 
no knowledge in physics of what energy is, as Feynman said. 
Other physicists pointed out the same difﬁculty (Sect. 5.2.4) or criticized the 
concept. However, most physicists deﬁne energy and formulate the principle of 
energy conservation, as if energy existed (Sects. 5.2.1 and 5.2.2). For example, Drans-
feld et al. wrote: “Energy can be neither produced nor destroyed but remains constant 
in every closed system. (Fact of experience!)” (Dransfeld, 2001, p. 109, Sect. 5.1.3).

The ﬁrst part of the proposition presupposes homogenization, as seen above. The 
fact that we give the same name of energy to the two members of an equivalence is 
not a “fact of experience” (I recall that according to Müller and Pouillet the conser-
vation of energy was a postulate, not a fact of experience, Sect. 5.1.1). Therefore, the 
ﬁrst part of Dransfeld’s proposition is not a fact of experience. We know, however, 
that the principle of energy conservation is based on solid experimental work (this 
is the reason why physicists defend the principle). Taking this experimental work 
into account, we might think that we have found a justiﬁcation for the principle. In 
doing so, however, I am resorting to something that is not in the proposition. What 
the proposition says is that the fact of experience is this: energy is neither created 
nor destroyed. When the question is then asked, what experiment shows me that an 
entity with these characteristics exists, difﬁculties arise. Thus, we understand why 
physicists have defended the principle of energy conservation and its formulation 
has led to the problem with the concept of energy.

Appendix A 
Heat: Either Substance or Motion 
In the late eighteenth century and the ﬁrst half of the next, there were two conﬂicting 
theses on the nature of heat: ‘heat is a substance’ and ‘heat is motion’. For some 
authors, these theses were only hypotheses. 
Laplace and Lavoisier (1780) account for divergences on the nature of heat. There 
are authors who take heat as a ﬂuid that penetrates bodies, they say.1 For others, heat 
results from unobservable movements of “molecules of matter”.2 In this case, they 
add, heat would consist of the sum of the living force of the molecules of matter.3 
Lavoisier and Laplace decided then to opt for neither of those two hypotheses4 and 
added: “In the ignorance where we are on the nature of heat, it only remains for us 
to observe its effects carefully”.5 
Lavoisier, Morveau, Berthollet and Fourcroy had carried out a reform of the 
chemical nomenclature, in which the element ‘caloric’ appears. By “caloric” was 
meant a subtle ﬂuid that lies between molecules and is responsible for our sensation 
of heat.6 This could lead one to think that Lavoisier had adopted the hypothesis of 
heat being a substance. In the Traité Élémentaire de Chimie, he explains, however, 
that he had adopted the term ‘caloric’ because he thought of heat as being the effect
1 “Les physiciens sont partagés sur la nature de la chaleur. Plusieurs d’entre eux la regardent comme 
un ﬂuide répandu dans toute la nature, et dont les corps sont plus ou moins pénétrés”. (Laplace & 
Lavoisier, 1780, p. 10) 
2 “D’autres physiciens pensent que la chaleur n’est que le résultat des mouvements insensibles des 
molécules de la matière”. (ibid. p. 10) 
3 “la chaleur est la force vive qui résulte des mouvements insensibles des molécules d’un corps; elle 
est la somme des produits de la masse de chaque molécule par le carré de sa Vitesse”. (ibid. p. 11) 
4 “Nous ne déciderons point entre les deux hypothèses précédentes”. (ibid. p. 12)

ses effets”. (ibid. p. 14)

et matérielle, d’un ﬂuide très-subtil”. (ibid. p. 19)

of something and wanted to distinguish between cause and effect.7 To make this 
distinction, he used ‘caloric’ to denote the cause. He adds, however, that this concept 
has the advantage of adapting to any opinion, because caloric is not necessarily an 
actual matter.8 What is it then? It is a name that refers to the repulsive cause, whatever 
it may be, that drives molecules away from each other. (In this conceptual framework, 
the state of bodies resulted from a balance between two forces: the attractive one, 
which came from gravitation, and the repulsive one, which was then due to caloric.9 ) 
Pictet (1790) also gives an account of the divergence among physicists about the 
nature of heat. Some take heat to be a vibration of the particles that constitute bodies. 
These attribute the change in temperature to the variation in the intensity of the 
vibrations.10 For others, heat is a sui generis ﬂuid that penetrates bodies and dilates 
them.11 Pictet foresaw that the designation ‘caloric’ would be generally adopted.12 
Black’s lectures were published posthumously, in 1803. He taught that the theses 
‘heat is substance’ and ‘heat is motion’ are hypotheses. The fact that they prove 
adequate to phenomena is not a decisive argument because for Black, it is possible 
to adapt any theory to the phenomena.13 He goes one step further: he highlights the 
reasoning behind these hypotheses. 
He argues, for example, that Lord Verulam had concluded that heat is motion14 
because he had obtained heat by means of motion.
7 “Cette substance, quelle qu’elle soit, étant la cause de la chaleur, ou, en d’autres termes, la sensation 
que nous appelons chaleur […] on ne peut pas, dans un langage rigoureux, la désigner par le nom 
de chaleur, parce que la même dénomination ne peut pas exprimer la cause et l’effet”. (ibid. p. 19) 
8 “Nous [Morveau, Berthollet, Fourcroy, Lavoisier] avons en conséquence désigné la cause de 
la chaleur, le ﬂuide éminemment élastique qui la produit, par le nom de calorique […] elle [cette 
expression] a encore un autre avantage, c’est de pouvoir s’adapter à toutes sortes d’opinions; puisque, 
rigoureusement parlant, nous ne sommes pas même obligés de supposer que la calorique soit une 
matière réelle”. (ibid. p. 19) 
9 “les molécules des corps peuvent être considérées como obéissant à deux forces, l’une répulsive, 
l’autre attractive, entre lesquelles eles sont en équilibre”. (Lavoisier, 1864, p. 18) 
10 “les plus grands Physiciens de notre siècle ne sont point encore d’accord sur la nature du feu; 
les uns le regardant comme une simple modiﬁcation des corps, comme un movement de vibration 
des particules qui composent les aggrégés visibles, & ils attribuent les changements de température 
aux variations dans l’intensité de ces vibrations”. (Pictet, 1790, p. 3) 
11 “le feu selon d’autres Physiciens est un ﬂuide particulier, sui generis qui passe aisément au travers 
de tous les corps, qui est prodigieusement expansible, & qui, par une suite de son élasticité ou par 
quelqu’autre cause, dilate tous les corps qu’il pénétre”. (ibid. p. 3)

“This [his] conclusion is founded chieﬂy on the consideration of several means by which 
heat is produced, or made appear, in bodies; as the percussion of iron, the friction of solid 
bodies, the collision of ﬂint and steel”. (Black, 1803, p. 31) 
It is true that motion is needed to strike the iron and the iron gets hotter. But 
between this motion and the appearance of heat there is the striking of the iron, 
which is neglected in that interpretation of the phenomenon. 
Regarding the explanation about the communication of heat from the warm body 
to the cold body,15 Black points out the implicit analogy between the ordinary 
experience of communication of matter and motion and the communication of heat: 
“The vulgar opinion is, that the hot body has lost something which has been added to the 
other. And those who have attempted to reason more profoundly on the nature of heat, have 
agreed with the multitude in this point; and have supposed that heat is a positive quality, and 
depends, either upon an exceedingly subtile and active matter, introduced into the pores of 
bodies, or upon a tremor or vibration excited among their particles, or perhaps among the 
particles of a peculiar substance present in all bodies; which subtile matter, or tremulous 
motion, they have supposed to be communicated from the hot body to the colder, agreeably 
to our general experience of the communication of matter or of motion”. (ibid. p. 25) 
This explanation of the communication of heat has a premise: the warm body 
gives something to the cold body. One could also assume that the cold body is active. 
In that case, the cold body would give something to the warm body. This hypothesis 
also existed. Frigoriﬁc particles that came from the cold body were admitted.16 
Under these conditions, one wonders how to proceed in the study of phenomena. 
Black answers: “Our ﬁrst business must, therefore, necessarily be, to study the facts 
belonging to our subject” (ibid. p. 35). 
Rumford (1798) and Davy (1799) argued that heat was motion. Both conducted 
friction experiments. By rubbing two bodies together, they found that the amount of 
heat increased. If the amount of heat increased, heat could not be a substance. 
According to Haldat (1807), physicists were divided between two diametrically 
opposed theories held by reputable authorities. This is Rumford, who argued that 
heat was a vibratory movement analogous to sound and Berthollet, who had devel-
oped a refutation of Rumford’s thesis.17 Haldat conducts friction experiments. His 
research concerns the relationship of the heat developed with different materials,
15 “When we consider this communication of heat from hot bodies to colder ones, the ﬁrst question 
which may naturally occur to our mind, is, In what manner have these two bodies acted, the one 
on the other, on this occasion? Has one of them lost something, which the other has gained? And 
which of them has lost, or which has received?”. (ibid. p. 25) 
16 “they have supposed that there is in the ice, or cold iron, a multitude of minute particles, which 
they call particles of frost, or frigoric particles, and which have a tendency to pass from the very 
cold bodies into any others that are less cold”. (ibid. p. 26)

on n’avoit encore soumis à aucun examen approfondi ce fait si digne d’attention. M de Rumford 
[…] qu’elle avoit été produite par l’agitation des molécules communiquées à l’eau à la manière du 
son. Cependant cette conclusion, qui tend à renverser de fond en comble la théorie du calorique, n’a 
pas paru légitimement déduite des faits, et M. Berthollet l’a réfutée dans une note de sa Statistique 
chimique […] L’opinion des physiciens demeure ainsi ﬂottante entre deux théories diamétralement 
opposées et soustenues l’une et l’autre par des autorités respectables”. (Haldat, 1807, p. 214)

taking into account their density and the roughness of the surfaces. Regarding the 
primary question he asked in the paper, the nature of heat, he concluded that the 
experiments did not lead to an answer.18 Thus, on one hand, Haldat corroborates 
Berthollet’s thesis, the causes of frictional heat arise from the compression of the 
molecules of the bodies.19 On the other hand, he says, there are facts that seem to 
corroborate Rumford’s opinion.20 Nevertheless, since there are so many arguments 
in favor of the materiality of heat, Haldat chooses to maintain the theory until further 
clariﬁcation becomes available.21 
In the same year, Young defends a different thesis: “If heat is not a substance, it 
must be a quality; and this quality can only be motion” (Young, 1807, Lecture LII, 
p. 654). 
J. T. Mayer (1820) argues that there is no such thing as heat as a substance. Heat 
comes from the internal motion of bodies. He does not specify the type of internal 
motion but takes it as an effect of attractive and repulsive forces.22 
Colladon and Sturm (1828) perform compression experiments. They also point out 
that the appearance of the heat of compression is connected with the most important 
questions of physics and could lead to interesting conclusions about the nature of 
heat.23 
Kämtz argues that there are two hypotheses about the nature of heat: heat as a 
substance and as motion (Kämtz, 1839, pp. 428–9). 
Matteuci uses the term ‘caloric’ to designate the cause or force which has the 
effects we call heat. He points out, however, that we ignore the nature of this force 
or the cause of heat (Matteuci, 1842, p. 1).
18 “Si les expériences que je viens de décrire n’ont pas eu tout le succès que j’en attendois pour 
déterminer la cause productrice de la chaleur qui se dégage dans le frottement des corps, elles ne 
sont pas cependant dépourvues d’utilité, ce me semble […]”. (ibid. p. 220) 
19 “De toutes les causes soupçonnées d’inﬂuer sur la production de la chaleur dans nos expériences, 
aucune ne paroît plus puissante que la condensation des molécules du corps résultant de la pression 
nécessaire pour opérer le frottement. C’est aussi à cette cause que M. Berthollet a cru devoir 
l’attribuer; mais comme son inﬂuence n’a été déterminée que par le raisonnement, j’ai cherché à la 
constater par l’expérience”. (ibid. p. 219) 
20 “Ces faits opposés au résultat qu’il y avoit lieu d’attendre, rendent très difﬁcile l’explication des 
phénomènes caloriﬁques produits par le frottement. Ils sembleroient favoriser l’opinion de M. de 
Rumford”. (ibid. p. 221) 
21 “Cependant un si grand nombre d’argumens établissent tellement la matérialité du calorique, que 
l’on ne doit pas abandonner une théorie si féconde en explications utiles, avant que de nouvelles 
expériences aient éclairci totalement ce point important de doctrine”. (ibid. p. 221) 
22 “Es gibt gar keine solche eigene von der Materie eines Körpers selbst verschiedene Wärmematerie 
(Wärmestoff), sondern die Wärme rührt nur von einem gewissen Zustande der Körper, einer gewissen 
innern Bewegung ihrer Theile selbst her […] Oder endlich ist das Gefühl von Wärme nur der Erfolg 
eines geänderten Verhältnisses der Attractio- und Repulsivkräfte”. (Mayer, 1820, p. 233) 
23 “Die bei der Zusammendrückung der Körper auftretenden Wärmeerscheinungen haben seit 
einigen Jahren die Aufmerksamkeit mehrerer Mathematiker und Physiker auf sich gezogen. Die 
Kenntniß dieser Erscheinungen schließt sich an die wichtigsten Fragen in der Physik, und kann 
vielleicht zu höchst interessanten Folgerungen über die Natur der Wärme selbst und über die zwis-
chen ihr und den verschiedenen Körpern stattﬁndenden Beziehungen führen”. (Colladon & Sturm, 
1828, p. 161)

Conclusion: 
• Heat is a substance, according to Karsten (1790), Haldat (1807), Carnot (1824), 
Clapeyron (1834) Thomson (1848, 1849), among others, 
• Heat is motion, according to Rumford (1798), Davy (1799), Young (1807), J. T. 
Mayer (1820), Mohr (1837), Joule (1843), Helmholtz (1882), Clausius (1850), 
Thomson (1851), among others, 
• These two theses are only hypotheses, according to Laplace and Lavoisier (1780), 
Black (1803), Kämtz (1839). 
With the acceptance of the mechanical equivalent of heat, the thesis of heat as a 
substance fell away. Heat as motion remained. Some authors, however, shy away from 
the question about the nature of heat. As we have seen, the principle of equivalence 
had precisely the advantage for some physicists that it was not connected with the 
nature of heat.

Appendix B 
Vis Viva: Leibniz, Mayer and Helmholtz 
Mayer presents a quantitative relationship between falling force and force of motion. 
For this, he uses a relationship between falling height and velocity that came from 
the seventeenth century. In the study of falling graves, Galileo had arrived at the 
following result. In the ﬁrst unit of time, the body travels through a certain space. 
In the second unit of time, the body travels three times this amount of space. In the 
third unit of time, it covers ﬁve times, etc. (Table B.1). 
The velocity of the body in the ﬁrst unit of time is 1 because it is given by the 
distance covered (let us take equal to 1) divided by the time spent (one unit). At the 
end of the second unit of time, calculating in the same way, the total distance covered 
is 1 + 3 = 4 and the time spent is 2. Therefore, the average velocity is equal to 2. At 
the end of the third time unit, the distance traveled is 1 + 3 + 5 = 9. Therefore, the 
average velocity is 9/3 = 3. Thus, it can be said that the height is proportional to the 
square of the average velocity. This relationship was used by Leibniz. 
In 1686, Leibniz published the paper Brevis demonstratio erroris memorabilis 
Cartesii et aliorum circa legem naturae … (Leibniz, 1686). What was Descartes’ 
error, according to Leibniz? In 1644, Descartes held that the quantity of motion in 
the universe is constant (Descartes PP II, § 36). This meant that if one body loses 
motion, another body or bodies gain motion. According to Descartes, two bodies have 
an equal quantity of motion if the products of body’s mass and velocity are equal

A (m = 1, h = 4) equals the 
force of B (m = 4, h = 1)

(Descartes, 1973, Part II, § 36). Thus, to agree with the universal law of conservation 
of motion, the quantity of motion before a (elastic) collision is equal to the quantity of 
movement after collision (ibid. §§ 46–52).24 In 1669, Huygens shows that in elastic 
collisions, not only the quantity of motion but also the magnitude mv2 is conserved.25 
In 1686, Leibniz argues that this magnitude is conserved in nature in general (Leibniz, 
1971). His argument is as follows. A body with a mass of 4 units, at a height of 1 
unit has as much force as a body of mass 1, at a height of 4 units (Fig. B.1), in short, 
1 Subscript m a s s Baseline times 4 Subscript h e i g h t Baseline equals 4 Subscript m a s s Baseline times 1 Subscript h e i g h t
This equality is not justiﬁed in the article. It is admitted. It is used afterwards to 
move to an equality where the velocities of the bodies appear. (This is what Leibniz 
was interested in to overthrow Descartes’ law, which includes velocities). The average 
velocity of body A is equal to two units. The average velocity of body B is equal to 
one unit as seen above. Now, to maintain the admitted equality 
m  S ub scr ip t
 upper A Baseline h Subscript upper A Baseline equals m Subscript upper B Baseline h Subscript upper B
we cannot use the product of mass and velocity, as established by Descartes’ law, 
because this would give 
1 Subsc ript upper A Baseline times 2 Subscript upper A Baseline not equals 4 Subscript upper B Baseline times 1 Subscript upper B
but rather, Leibniz claims,
24 Impact was the most important phenomenon, because in the Cartesian universe there is no empty 
space. Therefore, there was no movement without impact. 
25 “La somme des produits faits de la grandeur de chaque corps dur, multiplié par le quarré de sa 
vîtesse, est toûjours la mesme devant & apres leur reencontre”. (Huygens, 1669, p. 180)

Hence, he argues that the magnitude mv2 is conserved.26 
Mayer neither used this equation nor Eq. B.1. Instead of this, he did the following. 
Taking weight and height as the cause of the fall and admitting that cause = effect, 
he justiﬁes the equality between mass times height (cause) and mass times the square 
of velocity (effect). It follows then for each of Leibniz’s bodies that

Therefore, 
m Sub

aseline v Subscript upper A Superscript 2 Baseline equals m Subscript upper B Baseline v Subscript upper B Superscript 2
since the falling force is equal in Leibniz’s bodies (B.1). As this was Leibniz’s 
conclusion and this is justiﬁable by means of Mayer’s claim—the quantity of force 
is indestructible, he argues that the conservation of living force is subsumed by his 
theory of force. 
Vis viva is one of Helmholtz’s ultimate forces. He uses, however, an algorithm 
according to which weight times distance gives ½ mv2. For this reason, he changes the 
meaning of living force: living force becomes ½ mv2 in his paper. There is, however, 
a difference between this velocity v and Mayer’s. Lebniz’s living force, which is the 
one that Mayer uses, is expressed by mv2, but this velocity is the average velocity 
over the path. This is not the velocity that Helmholtz uses. As we have seen, Leibniz 
calculated the velocity from all the distance traveled by the body and all the time 
spent. To determine the distance traveled, he took the distance traveled in the ﬁrst 
unit of time as a unit, as Galileo had done. Later, the distance traveled was given 
by ½ gt2. If we calculate the average velocity as Leibniz did, we get ½ gt. Then the 
square of this, which is what Leibniz uses, is ¼ (gt)2. 
Another expression of the velocity is given by the derivation of h = ½ gt2. From  
here comes v = gt. This is the velocity of the body at the end of time t, not the average 
velocity of the body. Comparing the two, we get ½ v2 = 2v2 ave. In short, Helmholtz 
does not halve Leibniz’s living force, because the velocity he uses is not Leibniz’s.27 
Some historians have argued that Mayer got it wrong, because he used mv2 instead 
of ½ mv2.28 This criticism stems from the fact that both velocities are represented by 
the same letter. In fact, Mayer is referring to Leibniz. What he used was, therefore,
26 He called this magnitude ‘living force’ (vis viva) later on (Iltis, 1971, p. 25). 
27 The confusion between the two velocities already existed in Coriolis (1829). He used the same 
algorithm as Helmholtz and also claimed that ½ mv2 should be called living force. Both Coriolis 
and Helmholtz interpreted that the living force was halved. 
28 The Germann editors of Mayer’s texts Weyrauch (Mayer, 1893) and Oettingen (Mayer, 1911) 
added the “corrected” expressions to the original equations.

Mayer and the Color of Venous Blood 
On a boat trip to Indonesia, Mayer performed phlebotomies on all the crew members 
and was amazed at the bright color of the venous blood compared to the color of the 
blood he knew as a European doctor. He then concluded that there was a relationship 
between blood color and ambient temperature (Sect. 2.1). 
Around the time of Mayer birth centennial celebration, Jentsch (1914) published 
a book in which the history of Mayer’s discovery is addressed and an article in the 
German journal Naturwissenschaften, in which he reviewed other papers of the time 
on the color of venous blood. He concluded that there was no proof that venous blood 
in the equatorial zone was brighter (Jentsch, 1916). In 1954, Farber published an 
article on blood color to address Mayer’s observation considering articles on venous 
blood color before Mayer’s time. He stresses an experimental ﬁnding by Crawford 
who had placed a dog in water at 44.44 °C and found that after half an hour the venous 
blood acquired the color of the arterial blood (Farber, 1954, p. 6). This ﬁnding may 
lead one to think that the tropical environment of Java would have had a similar effect, 
which contradicts Jentsch’s remark that there is no proof that the venous blood is 
brighter in the equatorial zone. Let us consider Crawford’s experiment. 
A dog with a temperature of 38.89 °C was immersed in water at a temperature 
of 45.55 °C. After half an hour, the dog’s temperature was 42.78 °C and the water 
temperature was 44.44 °C. At this point, blood was drawn from an artery and a vein. 
“The venous blood assumed very nearly the hue of the arterial, and resembled it so 
much in appearance, that it was difﬁcult to distinguish between them” (Crawford, 
1788, p. 309). (This contrast with the initial conditions of the experiment: “the colour 
of the venous blood is a dark modena red; and that of the arterial a light scarlet.” 
(ibid. p. 309) 
The result of this experiment corroborates Mayer’s observations, in that when the 
dog’s environment became warmer, the colors of the arterial and venous blood were 
not easily distinguishable. There are, however, signiﬁcant differences between the 
conditions of this experiment and those in which Mayer’s observation took place. 
In Crawford’s experiment, the dog’s temperature increased by 3.89 °C. If we take 
the dog’s initial temperature as its normal temperature and transfer this temperature

difference to the human being, this will mean an increase in body temperature from 
37 °C (considered the normal temperature) to around 40.89 °C. However, Mayer 
did not mention such a temperature increase. In addition, Crawford notes that the 
dog’s respiration became “very rapid” after 11 min and still more rapid after 13 (ibid. 
p. 308), while Mayer did not mention any change in the speed of breathing. 
In sum, although Crawford treated experimentally the variation in the color of 
venous blood due to the heat to which a body is subjected, the conditions of the 
experiment are signiﬁcantly different from the conditions under which Mayer made 
his observation. 
More recently, the doctor Rocha-Homem addressed Mayer’s clinical observa-
tion. She studied the color of venous blood and concluded that it may be brighter 
in some circumstances for metabolic reasons (Rocha-Homem, 2015). This could 
explain Mayer’s observation in a way that neither contradicts Jentsch’s research nor 
interferes with Crawford’s results.

Imponderability: A Property of Mayer’s Force 
In addition to the two properties of force—indestructibility and transformability— 
called essential, (Sect. 2.1.1) there is a third—imponderability, whose justiﬁcation 
is of a different kind. In nature, there are two sets of causes, matter and force, says 
Mayer. Matter is characterized by ponderability and impenetrability and force, by 
the opposite.30 In the author’s own synthesis, forces are quantitatively indestructible, 
qualitatively transformable and imponderable.31 
‘Imponderability’ occupied a prominent place in the science of that time. Some 
authors divided their works into two parts: the ﬁrst being concerned with ponderable 
matter, which roughly corresponds to Mechanics, and the second with imponder-
ables, which included heat, light, electricity and magnetism.32 In Fundamentals of 
Physics and Chemistry, Suckow (1813) entitled the second part of the book “On 
the imponderable fundamental substances of bodies”. Muncke organizes his book 
Theory of Nature, 1829, in the same way. The second part of this book is entitled 
“Imponderable powers”. 
Suckow’s ‘fundamental substances’ or Muncke’s ‘powers’ were said to be impon-
derable because experiments had shown that unlike other matter, they were weight-
less. It had been, for instance, veriﬁed experimentally that a hot body had no more
30 “Zwei Abtheilungen von Ursachen ﬁnden sich in der Natur vor, zwischen denen erfahrungsmäßig 
keine Uebergange stattﬁnden. Die eine Abtheilung bilden die Ursachen, denen die Eigenschaft der 
Ponderabilität und Impenetrabilität zukommt, Materien; die andere die Ursachen, denen letztere 
Eigenschaften fehlen, - Kräfte.” (Mayer, 1842, p. 234) 
31 “Kräfte sind also: unzerstörliche, wandelbare, imponderable Objecte” (ibid. p. 234). The intro-
duction in the text of the adverbs quantitatively and qualitatively is justiﬁed by the following passage: 
“Ursachen sind (quantitativ) unzerstörlich und (qualitativ) wandelbare Objecte” (ibid. p. 234). 
32 “UnwägbareStoffe; Imponderabilia. Diejenigen Potenzen, welche die Erscheinungen des Lichtes, 
der Wärme, der Elektricität und des Magnetismus hervorbringen, werden unwägbare Stoffe, Impon-
derabilien genannt, weil sie sich von den übrigen bekannten materiellen Substanzen dadurch 
unterscheiden, daß sie nicht gewogen werden können”. (Gehler, Vol. 5.2, p. 765)

weight than the same cold body.33 The imponderables were distinguished from the 
rest of matter by another property: they could not be enclosed permanently in a 
container. Hence, they were also called non-coercive.34 
According to Muncke (1830), in a review article, there was a tendency to consider 
powers as substances, but there was no basis for afﬁrming or denying this thesis.35 
The designation “imponderables”, he adds, does not explain the nature of heat, light, 
electricity or magnetism and it is even unclear whether the designation is appropriate 
for them.36

Appendix E 
The Electrophorus 
Electrophorus etymologically means ‘carrier of electricity’. The instrument consists 
of a base, where the so-called resin cake is located, an upper plate and a handle, 
which serves to lift the upper plate (Fig. E.1). The resin cake is made of a mixture 
of resin, turpentine and beeswax. The plate is made of a metallic substance and the 
handle of a non-conductive material. Instead of a resin cake a glass disc could be 
used. 
Here is a description of the instrument’s operation from the time. By rubbing 
the resin cake (or a glass disk) and placing the plate on it base, one could observe 
the following.37 If you touch it, you get a small spark. If you touch it with one

electrophorus, 1778: the 
resin cake (AB), upper plate 
(CD) and the handle (E). The 
pulleys are only for lifting 
the upper plate more easily 
37 “Man errege die E. des Kuchens durch Reiben. Ist derselbe, wie gewöhnlich, von einer harzigen 
Composition bereitet, so wird die Erregung am besten gelingen, wenn […] Bedient man sich einer 
Glasscheibe, so dient zur Reibung derselben am besten […]”. (Gehler, 1827, Vol. 3.2, p. 736–7)

ﬁnger and touch the cake pan with another, then you get a considerable shock.38 
After touching it with your ﬁngers, neither the plate nor the cake pan shows any 
sign of electricity.39 If you raise the plate to a sufﬁcient height and touch it again, 
you get one or more sparks, which will be stronger if you simultaneously touch the 
plate and cake pan.40 The process could be repeated many times. A single rubbing 
is sufﬁcient, under favorable conditions of air humidity, to keep the instrument in 
action for months. This is why it was called ‘perpetual carrier of electricity’.41 The 
designation perpetual electrophorus was suggested by Volta, who is credited with 
the discovery of the instrument in 1775.42 
Wilke had made known an analogous instrument, in 1762, with the difference that 
in place of the resin cake appeared a glass plate (Wilke, 1762). In 1778, he wrote an 
article on Volta’s electrophorus, which he explained by means of the theory he had 
developed for his own apparatus (Wilke, 1778). 
Volta’s apparatus became especially important because it allowed the visualization 
of positive and negative electricity. This was achieved by Lichtenberg. He found that 
the resin powder, if dropped on the cake, acquired shapes, which were essentially 
radial or circular depending on the type of electricity, positive or negative (Fig. E.2).
The electrophorus was an irreplaceable instrument in a laboratory of the time.43 
For the explanation of the observed phenomena, there were several theories, as 
reported in the review article in Gehler’s Physical Dictionary (Gehler, 1827). Mayer 
does not commit himself to any of the theories. In fact, he does not need the expla-
nations either, because the way he uses the instrument in his theory depends only 
on observable elements: the movement of the upper plate and the electrical effects 
referred to above (Sect. 2.1.2).
38 “Setzt man den Deckel […] auf die Basis, welche nicht isolirt ist, und berührt ihn, so erhält man 
einen kleinen schneidenden Funken, berührt man dagegen mit dem einen Finger die Form, mit dem 
andern den Deckel, so fühlt man einen erschütternden Schlag”. (ibid. p. 737) 
39 “Nach diesen Berührungen zeigt weder der Deckel noch die Form weiter einige Spuren von E.” 
(ibid. p. 737) 
40 “Hebt man hierauf den Deckel mit den Schnüren oder Glasstange isolirt auf, entfernt ihn 
genugsam von der Basis, und berührt ihn wieder, so erhält man einen oder mehrere stechende 
Funken […] Diese Funken sind stärker, wenn man den Deckel und die Form zugleich, als wenn 
man nur den Deckel allein berührt hat”. (ibid. p. 737) 
41 “Das […] Verfahren läßt sich, so oft man will, wiederholen, ohne daß der Kuchen etwas merk-
liches von seiner E. verliert, bis ihm endlich nach längerer Zeit Luft und Feuchtigkeit dieselbe 
entziehen. So kann man von einer einzigen Reibung oft Monate lang el. Funken erhalten, daher das 
Instrument der beständige Elektricitätsträger genannt worden ist”. (ibid. p. 738) 
42 “E come mercè un tal rifondere quella elettricità che la mia macchina conserva già da sè assai 
lungo tempo, si può rendere non che durevole per lunghissimo tratto, ma perenne, così al nome di 
Elettroforo, il più acconcio per una tal machina, ho aggiunto il predicato di perpetuo che a tutto 
buon diritto gli conviene”. (Volta, 1918, p. 178)

Appendix F 
Mayer and Holtzmann 
Holtzmann published a book in 1845—On the heat elasticity of gases and vapors— 
in which he presents a value for the relationship between heat and work. This value 
is close to the mechanical equivalent of heat determined by Mayer. Let us compare 
the algorithms of both and the conceptual approach to the phenomena in question. 
According to Holtzmann, heat is measured by its effects. These can be temperature 
rises, mechanical work, or both (Holtzmann, 1845, p. 7). If heat is measured through 
its effects and work is one of them, then heat can be measured by means of mechanical 
work. If heat is measured through work, then it makes sense to determine the unit of 
heat in terms of work. This is what Holtzmann is going to do. The unit of heat that 
he symbolizes by ‘a’ is given by the ratio between the work done by the gas and the 
heat given to the gas, (ibid. p. 8) 
a eq uals StartFraction p r e s s u r e times v a r i a t i o n o f v o l u m e Over h e a t g i v e n t o t h e g a s EndFraction
a equals Start Fraction p r e s s u r e times v a r i a t i o n o f v o l u m e Over h e a t g i v e n t o t h e g a s EndFraction
In determining the mechanical equivalent of heat, Mayer had also broken down 
the effect of heat into two: temperature rise and work. In this case, work was given by 
the product of weight and height (Sects. 2.1.1 and 2.2.2). The mechanical equivalent 
of heat (MEH) was given as 
u p p er 
M upper E upper H equals StartFraction w e i g h t times h e i g h t Over h e a t g i v e n t o t h e g a s EndFraction
upper M upper E upper H equals StartFraction w e i g h t times h e i g h t Over h e a t g i v e n t o t h e g a s EndFraction
The gas in question in both authors is atmospheric air. The heat given to the gas is 
expressed in both authors by the difference between speciﬁc heat at constant pressure 
and constant volume. In the calculation, both use the ratio between these heats S tartFraction upper C Subscript p Baseline Over upper C Subscript v Baseline EndFraction
StartFraction upper C Subscript p Baseline Over upper C Subscript v Baseline EndFraction. 
However, this ratio is equal to 1.415 according to Holtzmann (ibid. p. 12) and equal 
to 1.421 according to Mayer (1845, p. 15). Holtzmann’s ‘volume variation’ and 
Mayer’s ‘height’ do not differ signiﬁcantly because the volume change is due to the 
expansion of the gas. Now, if the gas expands, it pushes the piston to a certain height.

Appendix F: Mayer and Holtzmann
Thus, we understand that the coefﬁcient of expansion of the gas (0.003668) used 
by Holtzmann (ibid. p. 13) is close to the ‘height’ indicated by Mayer (0.00365). 
If we use Holtzmann’s algorithm but enter the Mayer values mentioned before, 
Holtzmann’s unit of heat becomes equal to 367 kg m.44 This is the value of the 
mechanical equivalent of heat determined by Mayer in 1845. 
Conclusion. Holtzmann’s unit of heat conforms to Mayer’s mechanical equivalent 
of heat. The difference between the authors is in the approach. In one case, what heat 
does in terms of work is considered. Here the agent is heat, which remains in the 
process. In the other, the heat disappears to give rise to work—heat is transformed into 
motion. With Holtzmann, heat can be a substance. With Mayer, it is not a substance 
but a form of force. In short, the conceptions are different, the determined value is 
the same.45

Appendix G 
Mohr and Mayer 
In 1837, Mohr wrote an article—On the nature of heat—in which he defends the 
thesis that, besides the chemical elements, there is an agent in nature. This is the 
force. 
The impetus for this article came from one by Melloni (1836), in which he shows 
the polarization of heat and explores the analogy between this and the polarization 
of light (Mohr, 1837, p. 419). With this idea of heat being analogous to light (ibid. 
p. 441), Mohr explains thermal phenomena by means of the concepts of frequency 
and amplitude. He connects frequency to the temperature detectable by the ther-
mometer: higher frequency means higher temperature (ibid. p. 427). If a given 
substance receives heat and the temperature does not increase, the increase in ampli-
tude with maintenance of frequency justiﬁes the heat received. The cooling of a gas 
in a rarefaction is explained by the increase of amplitude at the expense of frequency 
(ibid. p. 437). 
So far, heat is motion. Heat will also become force. Let us see how this is done. 
Mohr argues that what reacts to a force is also a force. Now, heat overcomes the 
cohesive force of the particles. Therefore, heat is a force.46 
It turns out that heat has other effects than mechanical. Seebeck (1822–23) had 
shown that heating the junction of two metals generates electric current (ibid. p. 443). 
Mohr looked at this phenomenon in the following way: heat appears as electricity. 
Since he then admits that heat gives electricity, he infers that there must be something 
common to both heat and electricity. Now, heat is force, as seen above. Therefore, 
electricity will also be force. Going through several other phenomena in this way, he 
comes to the conclusion that there must be a single force in nature that accounts for 
what all these phenomena have in common. This leads to the thesis mentioned at the 
beginning of this section:
46 “Die Wärme erscheint in unzähligen Fällen als eine Kraft. […] Die Wärme hebt ebenfalls die 
Kohäsion der Körper auf, was aber eine Kraft aufhebt, muss selbst eine Kraft seyn”. (ibid. p. 421)

Appendix G: Mohr and Mayer
“Besides the known 54 chemical elements, there is only one agent in the nature of things, 
and that is force; it can appear [..] as motion, chemical afﬁnity, cohesion, electricity, light, 
heat, and magnetism”. (ibid. p. 442)47 
According to Mayer, there is a force that pervades the organic and the inorganic. 
This force has ﬁve forms (Sect. 2.1.2). Some of these coincide with Mohr’s forces. 
If we take the concepts out of context, the theses seem similar. There are, however, 
major differences. Mayer starts from the equation ‘causa aequat effectum’. ‘Force’ 
is the name he gives to cause and effect. The constancy of force in nature, which is 
the core of his axiom, (Sect. 2.1.2.1) comes from that initial equation. Based on it, 
Mayer determines the mechanical equivalent of heat. A comparison between both 
Mayer and Mohr is made by Mohr himself. 
In 1868, when the energy theory was already important, Mohr wrote about his 
1837 paper. He does not claim for himself the credit for the discovery of energy, but 
he quotes several passages from his article that are in line with what was said about 
energy (Mohr, 1868, pp. 39–45; see also Mohr, 1869, pp. 82–4).

Appendix H 
The Magneto-Electricity 
The term ‘magneto-electricity’ has fallen into disuse. The phenomena called 
magneto-electric are today call ‘electromagnetic’. At that time, electromagnetism 
and magneto-electricity had opposite meanings. 
In 1820, Oersted showed that the passage of electric current had an effect on a 
magnetic needle (Oersted, 1920, p. 214). Because electric current comes ﬁrst and then 
the effect on the magnetic needle, Oersted called this phenomenon electromagnetic. 
A few years later, Seebeck showed that heating the junction of two metals gave 
rise to electric current (Seebeck, 1822–23, p. 265). Oersted proposed then to call 
this phenomenon thermoelectric.48 In 1831, Faraday veriﬁed that the movement of a 
magnet in the vicinity of a copper coil gave rise to electric current. Since in this case 
we have ﬁrst the movement of the magnet and then electric current, the phenomenon 
was called magneto-electric.49 Hence, Joule’s machine was called magneto-electric 
machine and the electric current thus produced, magneto-electricity. 
This way of designating this kind of phenomena, which was common at the 
time, gave an account of what was being observed. A pair of terms refers to what 
is observed and requires no further explanation. Can we say that a pair of terms 
refers to a conversion, for example, from heat into electricity? A necessary condition 
for this is that heat exists, and electricity exists. The weak point concerns elec-
tricity. At the time, physicists were faced with the question of whether “electricities” 
derived from different sources had identical nature (Faraday, 1839, p. 102). Indeed, 
the thermo-electric phenomenon created a new kind of electricity. The same holds 
for the magneto-electric phenomenon. In this context, it had been meaningless to 
talk about conversion of:
48 “Il faudra désormais distinguer cette nouvelle classe de circuits électriques par une dénomination 
signiﬁcative; et comme telle je propose l’expression de circuits thermo-électriques ou peut-être 
thermélectriques”. (Oersted, 1823, p. 199) 
49 “The various experiments of this section prove, I think, most completely the production of elec-
tricity from ordinary magnetism” (Faraday 1832, p. 138). “I propose to call the agency thus exerted 
by ordinary magnets, magneto-electric or magnelectric induction” (ibid. p. 139).

Appendix H: The Magneto-Electricity
• heat into electricity, because, if it were conversion, it should have been conversion 
from heat into thermo-electricity; 
• magnetism into electricity, because it should have been conversion from 
magnetism into magneto-electricity; 
• electricity into magnetic effect, because it should have been conversion from 
voltaic electricity into magnetism. 
In sum, the pair of terms that characterized these kinds of phenomena (electro-
magnetic, magnetic-electric, thermo-electric) had no connection with ‘conversion 
processes’ at that time.50 It is true that Mayer integrated these and other types of 
phenomena as ‘transformations’. ‘Transformation’, however, does not have the sense 
of conversion. These terms differ from each other from the ontological point of view 
(Sect. 2.2.5).

Heat Is Motion: Rumford and Joule 
Joule refers to Rumford in the post scriptum of the 1843 article (Joule, 1884, p. 157) 
and again in the 1850 paper, for having defended the thesis that heat is motion 
(Joule, 1850, p. 61). Indeed, the idea of heat being motion had already existed in the 
eighteenth century and was based on experiments (Appendix A). Joule’s thesis on 
the nature of heat was therefore not new.51 Let us consider Rumford’s experiment to 
judge on Joule’s novelty. 
Rumford’s experiment consists of inserting a metal piece to be drilled and the 
drill into a container with water and measuring the temperature of the water from 
time to time (Rumford, 1798, p. 90). The drill performs 32 revolutions per minute. 
The water temperature increases continually (Fig. I.1). 
Fig. I.1 The experiment 
started with the water at 60° 
Fahrenheit. After one hour, 
the water temperature was 
107°; after two hours, 200° 
and after two and a half 
hours, the water boiled (ibid.

Appendix I: Heat Is Motion: Rumford and Joule
Based on this experiment, the answer to the question in the article ‘what is heat’ 
was the following: 
“it appears to me to be extremely difﬁcult, if not quite impossible, to form any distinct idea of 
any thing, capable of being excited, and  communicated, in the manner the heat was excited, 
and communicated in these experiments, except it be MOTION”. (ibid. p. 99) 
Let us compare this to Joule’s experiments. Generating heat through the magneto-
electric machine, as Joule did, was new, just in the sense that Rumford did not even 
know the machine. However, magneto-electricity was just a means of producing heat 
through motion. Producing heat through motion was nothing new. The thesis—heat 
is motion—was not new either. There is, however, one new point. Joule not only 
talks about increasing heat by mechanical means, but also about decreasing heat. He 
wrote: 
“We have therefore in magneto-electricity an agent capable by simple mechanical means of 
destroying or generating heat”. (Joule, 1884, p. 146) 
All this appears in Part I of Joule’s paper. In the second, Joule takes up some of the 
previous experiments with a new purpose: to verify whether there is a proportionality 
between the mechanical action involved and the heat produced (Joule, 1884, p. 149). 
This second part, entitled “On the mechanical value of heat”, provides the novelty of 
the paper. This value was determined experimentally and made it possible to make 
predictions.

Appendix J 
Gay-Lussac, Dulong and Joule 
I recall that in 1845, Joule carried out gas experiments: condensation, rarefaction 
and rarefaction followed by condensation (Sect. 2.2.2). This type of experiment had 
already been carried out by Dulong and Gay-Lussac. The results obtained were in 
line with those of Joule. There is, however, a difference between these experiments 
and Joule’s. It concerns heat by friction. 
Dulong had conducted experiments in which the volume of a given amount of 
gas is suddenly reduced; and the reverse, the volume of a given amount of gas is 
suddenly increased. He presented the results of these experiments as follows: 
“It would thus be the case with compound gases as with simple gases, and we would be 
led to this general law remarkable for its simplicity, namely: 1. that equal volumes of all 
elastic ﬂuids taken at the same temperature and under the same pressure, being compressed 
or suddenly expanded by the same fraction of their volume, give off or absorb the same 
ABSOLUTE QUANTITY OF HEAT; 2. that the resulting variations in TEMPERATURE 
are inversely proportional to their speciﬁc heat at a CONSTANT VOLUME”.52 
These experiments conform to the caloric theory. Heat exists in bodies, therefore 
also in gases. When a gas is pressed, heat comes out.53 It is thus understandable 
that condensation gives rise to heat. If the gas has more space, it can receive heat. 
Therefore, it draws heat from its surroundings. Dulong shows that the heat absorbed 
in the latter case is equal to the heat released in condensation if the other items of 
the experiment are kept the same. 
In the condensation and rarefaction experiments, Joule immerses the oriﬁce 
through which the gas passes into water (Fig. J.1).
52 “Il en serait donc des gaz composés comme des gaz simples, et nous serions conduits à cette 
loi générale remarquable par sa simplicité, savoir: 1°; que des volumes égaux de tous les ﬂuides 
élastiques pris à une même température et sous une même pression, étant comprimés ou dilatés 
subitement d’une même fraction de leur volume, dégagent ou absorbent la même QUANTITÉ 
ABSOLUE DE CHALEUR; 2°; que les variations de TEMPÉRATURE qui en résultent sont en 
raison inverse de leur chaleur spéciﬁque à VOLUME CONSTANT”. (Dulong, 1829, pp. 155–6) 
53 Explaining the phenomenon through caloric theory would offer more information. In the present 
context, this information need not be considered.

Fig. J.1 the conﬁgurations of the condensation and rarefaction experiments show the stopcock 
immersed in the recipients where the temperature of the water is measured 
Therefore, the heat of friction will arise in both cases. In condensation, this heat is 
added to the proper heat of condensation, increasing the heat released. In rarefaction, 
the cooling is slightly counteracted by the heat of friction.54 
In sum, Dulong’s experiments are consistent with those of Joule, who in fact 
quotes him (Joule, 1845b, p. 187). The difference is that Joule includes the heat of 
friction, unlike Dulong. Thus, what is really in question is the heat of friction. Joule 
argues then that his concept of heat provides an explanation for the heat of friction, 
unlike the theory of heat as a substance.55 
Let us move on to the rarefaction followed by condensation experiments. Joule 
performed two types of experiments (Sect. 2.2.2). In one case, the containers in 
which the gas is at considerable pressure and the exhausted container are immersed 
in different water-ﬁlled vessels. The stopcock is immersed in a third vessel (Fig. J.2). 
In the other case, the two containers and the stopcock area are immersed in a single 
vessel. The former case is similar to Gay-Lussac’s experiments.
Gay-Lussac (1807) carried out experiments in which he determined the heat 
absorbed in rarefaction and released in condensation (Fig. J.3).
In these experiments, the pressures are much lower than in Joule’s experiments: 1, 
0.5 and 0.25 atm. If we take the value of the ‘lost’ heat in the rarefaction as negative 
and the ‘gained’ heat as positive, as Joule did, we have (Table J.1).
In Joule’s experiments we have 
negative 2 period 36 Superscript ring Baseline plus 2 period 38 Superscript ring Baseline equals 0.0 2 Superscript ring Baseline period
54 “These results are inexplicable if heat be a substance. If that were the case, the same quantity 
of heat would have been absorbed by the rarefaction […] as was evolved by the corresponding 
condensation”. (Joule, 1845b, pp. 185–6) 
55 Friction was the weakness of the theory (Rankine 1855, p. 212; Fox 1971, pp. 99–103).

Unlike Gay-Lussac, Joule also measures the temperature at the stopcock, 0.31 °F. 
If we add up the three values, we get then 
negative 2 period 36 Superscript ring Baseline plus 2 period 38 Superscript ring Baseline plus 0.31 Superscript ring Baseline equals 0.33 Superscript ring Baseline period
Joule uses these kinds of experiments to defend the correlation between heat and 
work: if there is no work, no variation of heat occurs. This correlation is demonstrated 
in the ﬁrst type of experiments (gas containers and stopcock are immersed in the 
same water). However, based on the results obtained when containers and stopcock 
are taken separately (0.33 °F), a slight temperature rise would be expected when the

containers and stopcock are immersed in the same water.56 Therefore, the argument 
could be: with rarefaction followed by condensation, the temperature difference is 
close to zero. (This is justiﬁed by the values − 2.36 + 2.38 as well as those obtained 
by Gay-Lussac.) The heat that occurs in the experiments with the objects immersed 
in the same water is due to heat by friction. 
In sum, each one of the three Joule’s experiments was not signiﬁcant since the 
results were predictable. Taken together, however, they corroborate the correlation 
between heat and work (Table J.2). 
Joule’s argument focuses on the heat by friction. He points out the advantages of 
the concept of heat as motion by explaining this kind of heat. His series of experiments 
gain further relevance with the calculation of the mechanical equivalent of heat.57

Appendix K 
Berthollet and Hirn 
Hirn and Berthollet have performed similar experiments about half a century apart. 
Berthollet (1809) interprets the results by means of the heat-substance theory. Hirn 
(1862) uses his experiment to determine the mechanical equivalent of heat. The point 
here is sui generis: If Hirn had performed Berthollet’s experiments and not performed 
only a part of them, he would not have arrived at the mechanical equivalent of heat. 
Let us start with Hirn’s experiment. A heavy bar is impacted by a moving bar 
(Fig. K.1). Between the two bars there is a piece of lead, as illustrated in the ﬁgure. 
After impact, the temperature of the lead piece increases. Hirn determines the work 
done in crashing the piece of lead and the heat developed. Putting the two values into 
an equation, he obtains the mechanical equivalent of heat (Hirn, 1862, p. 111) [This 
became a new method of determining the mechanical equivalent of heat (Kipnis, 
2014, 2028)]. 
Fig. K.1 This is the Hirn experimental schema. The larger of the two pieces, on the lefthand side, 
is 941 kg and the smaller (m) is 350 kg. (Hirn 1862, p. 108)

Appendix K: Berthollet and Hirn
In 1809, Berthollet, together with Pictet and Biot, carried out metal compression 
experiments for which they used a “balancier”.58 Instead of lead, they used gold, 
silver, copper, iron and bronze blanks. After impact, the metal piece was placed 
in a small container with water and the water temperature measured. They veriﬁed 
that the temperature increased. So far, Berthollet, Pictet and Biot’s result could be 
conform with Hirn’s. Unlike Hirn, they continued the experiment in the following 
way. They let the bodies return to room temperature and performed the experiment 
again.59 They put the metal piece in the water and measured the temperature. The 
water temperature increased, but less than in the ﬁrst run of the experiment. They 
performed the experiment in the same manner a third time. The increase of the water 
temperature was lower than in the second run of the experiment. In the fourth run, 
the water temperature increase was even less or not detectable (Berthollet, 1809, 
p. 444). From the fourth on, there was no change in the water temperature. There 
was impact but no heat appeared. The authors came then to the conclusion that there 
is a relationship between the compression of the bodies and the heat developed; and 
that if the dimensions of the bodies cannot be further decreased, no more heat is 
produced, no matter how strong the mechanical action is.60 
In sum, the work done is roughly the same in all previous experiments, but the 
amount of heat differs. If we were to use Hirn’s algorithm with Berthollet’s results, 
we would have the mechanical equivalent of the heat varying between zero and a 
maximum value—that of the ﬁrst experiment. 
One could argue that, in the second and subsequent runs of the experiment, we 
do not obtain the mechanical equivalent of heat because there is a certain factor 
that is not being taken into account. Admitting this argument, it follows that Hirn’s 
algorithm is incomplete because such a factor is not provided. 
Berthollet, Pictet and Biot could not have concluded that there is a relationship 
between work and heat. With the same quantity of work, they obtained different 
amounts of heat, including no heat. Under these circumstances, there was no reason 
to accept that heat is motion.
58 “Il y a quelques années que, dans l’espérance de jeter du jour sur l’origine de la chaleur, qui 
provient de la compression et du frottement, je formai le projet d’examiner, à l’aide d’un balancier, 
les effets de la compression des métaux […] je priai MM. Pictet et Biot de concourir avec moi à 
ces experiences”. (Berthollet, 1809, p. 441) 
59 “Je ﬁs préparer des ﬂaons d’or, d’argent, de cuivre, de fer et de bronze, tous de même dimension, 
pour les soumettre à l’action du balancier […] Pour déterminer la chaleur que les pièces de métal 
acquéroient par le choc du balancier […] on préféra bientôt de jeter promptement la pièce dans une 
quantité d’eau sufﬁsante pour la recouvrir […] On soumettoit une pièce aux coups d’un balancier 
mis en mouvement par deux hommes forts et habitués à ce travail; on déterminoit la chaleur acquise; 
on laissoit reprendre à la pièce une température exactement semblable à celle du balancier; on lui 
faisoit subir un nouveau coup, et […]”. (ibid. pp. 442–3) 
60 “Il résulte de ce qui précède, que la chaleur qui est produite par le choc et la compression dans 
les corps qui n’éprouvent pas de changement chimique est uniquement due aux changemens de 
dimension qu’éprouvent ces corps, et lorsque les dimensions ne peuvent plus être diminuées, le 
choc quelque violent qu’il soit ne cause point de chaleur”. (ibid. p. 447)

Newton and the Conservation of Energy 
Peter Tait wrote: 
“so far as experimental facts were known in Newton’s time, he had the Conservation of Energy 
complete; the cases of apparent loss by impact, friction, & c. were not then understood”. 
(Tait, 1865, p. 57)61 
Let us consider the interpretation at that time of the ‘apparent loss by impact’ 
case: 
“Two bodies void of elasticity, meeting together with equal contrary forces, both lose their 
motion”. (Clarke’s 4th fourth Reply, § 38, Alexander, 1956, p. 52) 
This passage appears in the Leibniz-Clarke Correspondence (1715–16), where 
the latter represented Newton (Koyré & Cohen, 1962, pp. 64–7). Clarke argues that 
the bodies in that collision come to rest and need a new force to move. Therefore, he 
concludes, the amount of force has been lost. 
Leibniz answered: 
“The author objects, that two soft or un-elastic bodies meeting together, lose some of their 
force. I answer, no. ‘Tis true, that their wholes lose it with respect to their total motion; but 
their parts receive it, being shaken [internally] by the force of the concourse. And therefore 
that loss of force, is only in appearance. The forces are not destroyed but scattered among 
the small parts. The bodies do not lose their forces; but the case here is the same, as when 
men change great money into small”. (Leibniz 5th paper, § 99, Alexander, 1956, pp. 87–88) 
With this interpretation of the inelastic collision, Leibniz answers an objection 
that contradicted his general law of conservation of living force (Appendix B). In 
contrast, Clarke not only argues that motion disappears in the case at stake, but 
he also denies any law of conservation. This radical opposition to a general law 
of conservation appears clearly in the discussion between both Leibniz and Clarke 
about natural theology.

At that time, it was necessary to show that a thesis about nature was in accordance 
with the theology. In this context, Leibniz argues that God is a perfect artiﬁcer. He 
created the world as a perfect clock, which works by itself since its creation. Clarke 
counter-argues: to admit that the world works for itself is to put God outside the 
government of the world. In that case, God would be like a nominal monarch. He 
would be king in name, but without inﬂuence in the kingdom. But there is more. 
Clarke argues that there are no natural powers. A spring, for example, oscillates 
because God makes it oscillate. It does not oscillate by itself. The planets gravitate 
around the sun because God or an invisible created power performs these movements, 
still according to Clarke.62 Now, if there are no natural powers,63 then nature cannot 
function on its own. 
Conclusion. In the Leibniz-Clarke controversy, we have two opposite theses 
concerning a conservation law. On one side, there is a law of conservation, that 
is, nature works by itself, independent of God (dependent at Creation, but not after-
wards); and on the other, there is no law of conservation, as nature does not work 
by itself but depends completely on God. This latter view represents Newton’s 
viewpoint. Thus, there is no reason to attribute the law of energy conservation to 
Newton.

Appendix M 
On the Discovery of Energy 
According to some physicists, we do not know what energy is (Sect. 1.1). Others 
deﬁne energy, but this deﬁnition has been criticized (Sect. 5.2). Since there is no clear 
concept of what it is, it becomes difﬁcult to search the past for what concerns energy. 
What historians have done is to place in the history of energy what concerns the past 
of what they connect to the concept of energy. As the concept varies, depending on 
the author, it is not surprising that historiographical results about the energy concept 
differ from each other.64 Such a divergence is illustrated below with a recurrent theme 
in the literature, the discovery of energy. 
Mach defended the thesis that energy was an “almost simultaneous” discovery 
(Mach, 1896, p. 227). The period of discovery would have started with Carnot’s 
manuscripts, which are prior to 1833. Mach explained the almost simultaneity 
through a set of trigger factors. These would have been the conviction of the 
impossibility of perpetuum mobile and the meaning of work (ibid. p. 226). 
Mach’s thesis has not been followed by other historians of energy.65 The idea of 
the simultaneous discovery of energy reappears, however, in Kuhn’s paper ‘Energy 
conservation as an example of simultaneous discovery’. Mach spoke of ‘almost 
simultaneous’ because there was a time interval. Kuhn speaks of ‘simultaneous 
discovery’, but also presupposes a time interval. This goes from Carnot’s manuscripts 
to 1854. Kuhn’s paper was criticized for a variety of reasons.66 He had, however, an 
appreciable repercussion.67 
Kuhn presented 12 energy discoverers, which he systematizes into three groups 
of four authors:
64 This divergence becomes specially clear if the history of the historiography of energy is considered 
(Mach 1872, Berthold 1875, Weyrauch 1885, etc. Chap. 1, Footnote 3).

2. Sadi Carnot, Séguin, Holtzmann and Hirn (before 1833–54) 
3. Mohr, Grove, Faraday and Liebig (1837–44). (Kuhn, 1959, p. 321). 
The 1st group gathers the generality of formulation and concrete quantitative 
applications.68 The 2nd group admits that heat and work are quantitatively inter-
changeable and computed an equivalent. The 3rd group sees the world of phenomena 
as manifesting a single force that could appear in many forms but never created or 
destroyed in all its transformations. 
Mohr (group 3) is regarded as a discoverer of energy because he claimed that in 
addition to the 54 elements of chemistry, there was an agent in nature that was the 
force (Appendix G). How can one justify the inclusion of Mohr for this reason? If 
we admit that energy is an entity that acts in nature, it is understandable that Mohr 
appears in the history of energy. Now, according to Ostwald, energy is an agent. It is 
the cause of events (Sect. 4.3). Therefore, following Ostwald, we can admit energy as 
an entity. However, according to Feynman et al., (1963), Duit (1987), Hecht (2000), 
among others energy is not an entity. Following these authors, we have no reason to 
take Mohr as a discoverer for having argued that there is such a force. The historian’s 
point of view is thus decisive in relation to the question of whether an author is a 
discoverer. 
Let us continue with Holtzmann, who appears in group 2. He is considered a 
discoverer of energy because he calculated the unit of heat in terms of work. The 
value obtained coincides with Mayer’s mechanical equivalent of heat (Appendix F). 
He did not say, however, that there was an entity that is an agent in nature, like Mohr. 
On the contrary, he admitted that the calculation of the mechanical value of the unit 
of heat was based on the expansion of heat. Therefore, Holtzmann did not discover 
a necessary characteristic of energy, which is the one for which Mohr is credited as 
a discoverer. 
Thus, if Mohr is taken as a discoverer, the characteristic that he found for force 
must be a characteristic of energy. However, if this is a characteristic of energy, 
then one cannot attribute the discovery to Holtzmann, who found no agent. For 
the same reason, in order to give Holtzmann the merit of energy discoverer, it is 
necessary that the value of the mechanical equivalent of heat is a characteristic of 
energy. Nevertheless, if the calculation of the mechanical value of work is a necessary 
characteristic of energy, then we cannot attribute the discovery to Mohr, who did not 
calculate this value. 
What is at issue here is the following. If one admits that energy has certain charac-
teristics and states that A is a discoverer of energy, we expect that A had discovered 
that which has these characteristics. If we take A as a discoverer because he discov-
ered only one of the characteristics, then we will have to say that he was not a 
discoverer of energy, but he discovered one of the characteristics of energy. Never-
theless, for this to have historical meaning, it is necessary that this characteristic was
68 With regard ‘quantitative applications’ of this group, we have the following: Mayer and Joule 
determined the mechanical equivalent of heat; Colding did not calculate it; Helmholtz used it to 
make predictions.

subsequently used by someone else to discover the others. In the case at stake, it 
would be as follows: Mohr discovered the agent on the basis of which, for instance, 
the mechanical value of heat was arrived at. In such a situation, Mohr did not discover 
the mechanical value of heat, but is in a chain of events that led to that value. In that 
case, there were a reason to include him in the history of the discovery of energy. 
This was not, however, the case: neither Mayer nor Joule nor Holtzmann relied on 
Mohr’s agent. 
Of course, it could have happened that a third person had used Mohr’s agent, 
Holtzmann’s mechanical value of the unit of work and reached the conservation of 
energy. In this case, the two would be in a chain of events in the history of energy. 
However, this did not happen either. In sum, neither Mohr nor Holtzmann are in the 
chain of events that led to the conservation of energy. There is, therefore, no reason 
to take them as discoverers of energy. 
Let us return brieﬂy to the history of energy to continue the analysis. According 
to Mayer’s axiom, the quantity of force in phenomena remains constant. Therefore, 
in a phenomenon of heat and work, there will have to be an equivalent between the 
two. (Otherwise, there were no conservation of force.) Joule admitted that heat was 
motion. Thus, he looked for a constant of proportionality between the two types of 
motion. In this search, he determined the mechanical value of heat (Joule 1843). 
Holtzmann calculated the work done by heat (as a substance) and determined the 
unit value of heat in terms of work. Let us add the values obtained in 1845: the 
mechanical equivalent of heat determined by Mayer was 367 kg m (3.60 J); by Joule, 
798 lb ft (4.29 J); the value of the unit of heat in terms of work was 374 kg m (3.67 J). 
So far, we have seen that different ways led to the calculation of a value, which 
is now called the ‘mechanical equivalent of heat’. Since different means led to a 
value, we cannot say that all those who had determined the value by then, discovered 
energy. Let us look at this in detail. 
Mayer’s logical sequence can be given as follows: the conservation of force (his 
axiom) implies that there is a mechanical equivalent of heat. The search for this 
equivalent led to a given value. Therefore, the conservation of force led to the value.

Since the premises are true, the conclusion holds, that is, (conservation of force 
= > MEHvalue). 
Let us now use this conclusion as a premise in the following syllogism: 
1. conservation of force = > MEHvalue. 
2. Now, Joule and Holtzmann arrived at this value. (This is true.) 
3. Therefore, they discovered the conservation of force. 
This reasoning is fallacious.

188
Appendix M: On the Discovery of Energy
If one could only arrive at that value by conservation of force, then whoever 
arrived at the value had used conservation of force. Nevertheless, this is not the case. 
One arrived at the value from different premises, driven by different ideas. 
This allows us to understand what happened in Kuhn’s paper. Kuhn established 
the characteristics of energy. By discovering one of them, the author would enter the 
history of energy. The logic of this is as exposed earlier: 
1. conservation of energy leads to the mechanical equivalent of heat; 
2. some discovered the value of the equivalent; 
3. then they discovered energy. 
The reasoning is fallacious. (It is because of this fallacy that Holtzmann appears 
as the discoverer of energy, even though he admitted a principle (heat is substance) 
that was annihilated by the admission of energy.) 
Like Mach, Kuhn also presents a set of factors to explain the simultaneity of the 
discovery. The trigger factors are, however, different. Kuhn’s are: 
• conversion processes, 
• the concern with engines 
• German philosophy of nature (Naturphilosophie).69 
Several authors have criticized these factors. There is, however, a preliminary 
point to keep in mind. According to Kuhn, there was no simultaneous discovery. 
There was not because “no two of our men even said the same thing” (Kuhn, 1959, 
p. 322). “What we see in their works is not really the simultaneous discovery of 
energy conservation” (ibid. 323). So we have the following. The 3 factors serve to 
explain the simultaneity of the discovery. The discovery was not really simultaneous. 
Therefore, the factors are meant to explain what did not really happen. Therefore, 
Kuhn’s factors have no historical relevance. 
While Kuhn (1959), Brush (1970), Rutherford et al. (1981) spoke of 12 energy 
discoverers, other authors advocated lower numbers.70 At the other end of the spec-
trum, there are theses with only one author. For some authors it was Mayer, for 
others, Joule and some argue that it was Helmholtz. This last thesis, which will be 
considered next, is from the twentieth century. 
According to Elkana, “Helmholtz has proved correctly and generally the law of 
conservation of energy, at the time (1847)” (Elkana, 1974, p. 16). Some years later, 
Harman wrote: “Helmholtz’s work on the conservation of energy was important 
not only in providing a mathematical formulation of the energy principle, but also 
[…]” (Harman, 1982, p. 44). In Torretti’s Philosophy of Physics, Helmholtz was the 
ﬁrst who clearly and precisely exposed energy as a fundamental physics principle 
(Torretti, 1999, p. 183). It is true that among the texts in Chap. 2, Helmholtz’s paper 
is the one that makes the most use of mathematics. It is, however, important to see 
what he did with it.
69 Brush (1970) added a fourth factor, the wave theory.

He expresses the conservation of force for the case of falling bodies, 
one half m v squared equals m g h
one ha lf m 
v squared equals m g h
What follows is based on this. The ﬁrst step of this generalization leads to the 
assumption of central forces (Sect. 2.4.1). In the case of electric and electromagnetic 
phenomena with current, it is not the previous equation but an equation of the form
normal upp er Del ta l i v i  n g f o r c e equals normal upper Delta t e n s i o n f o r c e
that he used. Indeed, the calculation of force, distance and velocity (Eq. M.1) in the  
case of phenomena that are not completely observable does not take place. Helmholtz 
looks at an electric circuit and takes one part as tension force and another part as 
living force. The advantage he points out in this procedure is heuristic. This leads 
to new results. Helmholtz’s prediction was correct in some cases (Bevilacqua, 1993, 
p. 331). In conclusion, the ideas about Helmholtz’s formulation of the conservation 
principle mentioned above are unfounded.71 
The sense of discovery 
When one speaks of ‘discovery of energy’ one presupposes that energy was hidden 
and is no longer.72 If by discovery is meant bringing to light what was hidden in 
nature, then there is no discovery of energy, because, as we have seen, such an entity 
was never discovered (Chap. 6). What came from experiments and was new was the 
mechanical equivalent of heat. 
The mechanical equivalent of heat not only served the thesis of the conservation of 
energy, but also justiﬁed the principle of equivalence, which did not use the concept 
of energy (Sect. 5.1.1). Therefore, the interpretation of the experiments through 
energy is not the only possible one. Thus, the question of the discovery of energy is 
ultimately the discovery of a given way of interpreting phenomena.

On Energy Teaching 
We have seen that there is no clear idea of what energy is (Sect. 5.2). Therefore, it is 
understandable that it is difﬁcult to explain what it is. If it is difﬁcult to expose the 
concept, we cannot expect students to understand it. This sequence of propositions 
reﬂects what research in science education has taught us. 
For decades, explanations of energy in high-school and university textbooks 
have been criticized by science teaching experts,73 which denotes the difﬁculty in 
explaining the concept. Research literature on student misconceptions and reasons 
for the misunderstandings is ample, which accounts for the students’ difﬁculties.74 
Teaching methods have been developed in order to avoid misconceptions.75 Never-
theless, if there is a problem with the concept to be taught, pedagogy can hardly 
overcome it. 
Let us move on to the content of what has been taught. The explicit deﬁnition of 
energy that appears in textbooks tells us that energy is the capacity of doing work 
(Sect. 5.2.3). This deﬁnition has been criticized.76 Beyond this deﬁnition, there is an 
implicit deﬁnition of energy, which is the one that emerges from the conservation 
principle: energy is something that can neither be destroyed nor created, but only 
transformed (Sect. 5.2.1). Duit (1987) pointed out, however, some inconveniences 
of the concept that takes energy as something quasi material. According to Beynon, 
there is so much confusion with energy “because it is not treated as an abstract 
physical quantity but something real, just like a piece of cheese” (Beynon, 1990, 
p. 315). Empirical educational research shows alternative ideas, such as ‘Energy is

fuel’ or ‘Energy is stored within objects’ (Nicholls & Ogborn, 1993, p. 73; Prideaux, 
1995, p. 278). Doménech et al. deconstruct ideas which could lead to an interpretation 
of energy as something possessed by the objects themselves (Doménech et al., 2007, 
pp. 51–53). All criticized topics concern the concept of energy as a real thing. 
Some physics teaching experts prefer Feynman’s concept: energy is not a concrete 
thing and energy conservation is a mathematical principle.77 According to Feynman, 
the law of conservation of energy 
“states that there is a certain quantity, which we call energy, that does not change in the 
manifold changes which nature undergoes. That is a most abstract idea, because it is a 
mathematical principle; it says that there is a numerical quantity which does not change 
when something happens”. (Feynman et al., 1963, Sect. 4.1) 
This is in accordance with Mayer’s axiom: the magnitude force, now ‘energy’, 
remains constant in physical and chemical phenomena. Mayer’s axiom is based on 
the mechanical equivalent of heat, which comes from experiments (Sect. 2.1.2). 
Therefore, it is not necessary to resort to Feynman’s idea to approach the energy 
concept. We can, however, understand the use of ‘mathematical principle’. Mayer’s 
original idea, which I have just used, is gone. The contemporary principle of energy 
conservation justiﬁes conservation through an entity, which can neither be destroyed 
nor created (Sect. 2.1.2.1) Now, Feynman argued that such an entity does not exist. 
Moreover, he taught that it is not known what energy is. Thus, there remained the 
mathematical part of the principle, the conservation of quantity. According to the 
present study, it is not necessary to change the status of the principle—from a physical 
to a mathematical principle—to talk about the conservation of energy (Chap. 6). 
Duit (1987, p. 145) pointed out that Feynman’s concept is too abstract for teaching 
at basic level. It is understandable that this approach is difﬁcult for those starting out, 
just as the concept of energy from Mayer’s axiom can also be difﬁcult for them. 
There is, however, a way out of this problem that consists of using the phylogenetic 
development for ontogenetic purposes. To introduce energy, we can use Mayer’s ﬁrst 
experiment, the agitation of water (Sect. 2.1.1). He did not give precise indications 
about the set up used, but it is possible to recreate it. A test tube containing 10 ml of 
water that was isolated and shaken for three minutes, showed a temperature increase 
of about half a degree Celsius. What Mayer read from the experiment was: motion 
transformed into heat. This reﬂects the common observation: I stirred the water, and it 
got warmer. The student will certainly understand what is meant by ‘transformation’. 
So far, we have had a qualitative approach. If you want to move on to a quantitative 
one (probably at a later stage), you can use Joule’s paddle wheel experiment. When 
we show this experiment, the student already knows that stirring water gives heat. 
Now in Joule’s experiment, the water is agitated, as the glass calorimeter experiment 
clearly shows. Therefore, there must be heat. What we need to know is how much 
heat was obtained by the falling bodies in Joule’s experiment. For this, we will have 
to go on to measurements. 
If we ﬁnally measure the work done and the heat produced, then we can put them 
into an equation based on an idea like ‘cause = effect’. If we want to move on to

energy, we will have to tell the students that we call two different things energy: 
weights at a certain height and the heat developed.78 
One might object that by this I am not saying what energy is, but what I call energy. 
In fact, this is exactly what Mayer said could be done.79 The reader might rightly think 
that textbooks also teach what is called energy. It is shown there that this is potential 
energy and that is kinetic energy, etc. There is, however, a difference: textbooks tell 
us what is called energy, but they do not tell us that energy is an assigned name, a 
homogenization term (Chap. 6). Without this information, it is left open what energy 
is. (It is, therefore, understandable that at the end of some explanations, students ask, 
‘but what is energy anyway?’80 ) If they know, however, that ‘energy’ is an assigned 
name and how that term was assigned, the doubt disappears. What needed to be said 
has been said. Of course, the student could, however, ask: ‘if the name is given, then 
could it have been any other?’ The answer is yes. Not only could it have had another 
name, but it also had another name at the beginning. If the student still asks, ‘would 
it be possible not to name it at all?’ the answer is also positive. The example comes 
to us from the authors who used the equivalence principle instead of the energy 
conservation principle. 
In our century, there has been a widespread attempt to use energy as if it were a 
substance, even though the authors know that it is not. Brewe writes: 
“Treating energy with a conceptual metaphor of a substancelike quantity that can be stored 
and transferred provides students and instructors conceptual resources that contribute to the 
development of useful energy conceptions. 
However, simply including this metaphor for energy is not sufﬁcient to promote energy 
as a viable way of modeling physical systems. The curriculum needs to be reorganized 
and refocused on energy as a central, coherent theme […] Examples of student reasoning 
using energy to address common conceptions and to solve problems captures the power of 
the reasoning tools available with implementation of the energy-as-substance framework”. 
(Brewe, 2011, p. 13) 
The metaphor is a literary ﬁgure. It insinuates but does not deﬁne. If we want 
scientiﬁc language to be precise, we cannot use metaphors. The reason for the use of 
the energy-as-substance is the following: with this metaphor the student does what 
he is supposed to do. We can now achieve this same goal without the metaphor. The 
student does what he is intended to do because he understands what it is about, since 
this can be clearly exposed. (The teacher is expecting more indications and empirical 
work with students, but all this is beyond the scope of this book.)
78 The steps in this sequence will naturally have to be adapted by the teacher. 
79 “was insbesondere die Kräftefrage anbelangt, so handelt es sich ja zunächst nicht darum, was ein 
“Kraft” für ein Ding ist, sonder darum, welches Ding wir “Kraft” nennen wollen.” (Mayer, 1851, 
p. 35).
