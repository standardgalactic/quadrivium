Using Text Models
•
In order to use text models we need to deploy them
•
After deployment we can test them and use the API
•
Deployment is done in Azure OpenAI Studio

Azure OpenAI Studio
•
A visual tool for working with OpenAI models
•
Allows:
Model deployment
Testing with Playground
Fine tuning
Setting up Content Filters

Azure OpenAI Studio
•
Most of the work with OpenAI is done in OpenAI Studio
•
Accessible from the portal

Content Filters
•
AI can be abused to respond in harmful ways
•
Azure OpenAI includes a built-in service to guard against that
•
Uses the Azure AI Content Safety engine 
•
We’ll discuss it later
•
You can define the content filter levels you want for your models
•
Use them later in the API

Quotas
•
When creating a new deployment you’re assigned a Quota
•
Sets the maximum Tokens-Per-Minute (TPM) you can consume
•
Per model, per region
•
The goal is to avoid loading the OpenAI API
•
You can adjust the quota to distribute it between models

Plugins and Extensibility
•
In the future, additional functionality will be added to the Azure 
OpenAI Service
•
Main planned functionalities are:
•
At the time of this recording, neither is available
Plugins
Work with your data

Plugins
•
Allow deep integration with Microsoft and external services
•
Integrate GPT functionality into (at first):
•
Bing Search
•
Cognitive Search
•
Azure SQL
•
Cosmos DB
•
Microsoft Translator

Work With Your Data
•
Enable GPT models to access organizational data
•
For example: GPT will be able to access organizational SQL Server 
to pull data and include it in the response
